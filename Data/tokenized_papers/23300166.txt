reactive oxygen species have been characterized as both important signaling molecules and universal stressors that mediate many developmental and physiological responses . so far details of the transcriptional mechanism of ros responsive genes are largely unknown . in the study reported here we identified seven potential ros responsive cis acting elements from the promoters of genes up regulated by ros in arabidopsis . we also found that the responsive element binding _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ could bind specifically to the box . coexpression of _LOCATION_ enhanced luciferase activity driven by . the deficient mutants of _LOCATION_ showed growth retardation and higher sensitivity to photodamage . _LOCATION_ interacted physically with mitogen activated protein _PROTEIN_ and also served as a substrate of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mediated _LOCATION_ phosphorylation at both serine and serine affected the dynamic alternation of the _LOCATION_ protein which resulted in changes in ros responsive gene transcription . these data might provide new insight into the _METHOD_ that regulate ros responsive gene transcription via a complex of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and the box under oxidative stress or a fluctuating light environment .
to identify ros responsive elements a bioinformatic strategy was used to search for motifs that were conserved in the promoters of ros responsive genes . on the basis of our microarray data and the results of other recent similar studies ros responsive genes were clustered into three groups cluster i includes genes that are highly induced by treatment and named hih cluster ii contains _METHOD_ mutant ozone and methyl viologen induced genes which are named fom cluster iii only contains six genes that are induced by aminotriazole _PROTEIN_ treatment in catalase deficient mutant plants . genes from cluster iii were not used for the promoter analysis in this study in order to avoid obtaining misleading results from similar random sequences . promoters from the hih and fom clusters were selected for analysis with the program meme to identify potential transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites . then the present frequencies of each motif in hih and fom cluster pools were calculated against a whole genome set by the mast program . only those motifs with significantly higher enrichment in the test pool than the whole genome set were selected as potential roses . as a result a total of seven roses were identified in the hih and fom clusters . table i provides detailed information about the seven roses including homologous sequences examples of ros responsive genes in whose promoters they were found et cetera . several rose motifs matched known cis acting elements for example the aba responsive element _PROTEIN_ brassinosteroid responsive element w box and gcc box . however and were found to be novel putative ros responsive elements because they did not match any known cis acting elements exactly . to determine whether the putative roses were sufficient to regulate the transcription of ros responsive genes transient _PROTEIN_ assays were carried out using the luciferase reporter system following treatment with different ros reagents which included mv and _PROTEIN_ . for the reporter constructs four repeats of the core rose sequences were cloned upstream of the minimal promoter region of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the reporter genes were delivered into arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment . under the control of luciferase activity in the presence of increased fold relative to control luciferase activity in the absence of . in response to mv and fold increases in luciferase activity were observed with the reporter constructs that contained and respectively . meanwhile _PROTEIN_ only activated luc transcription significantly . as mentioned above the well characterized gcc box cis acting element was found to be a novel putative ros responsive element . the application of exogenous induced the _PROTEIN_ of genes of the _PROTEIN_ family which included _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis seedlings . members of the _PROTEIN_ family are known to bind the gcc box . the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ was also increased by the application of singlet oxygen . the results of our quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis also showed that _LOCATION_ transcription was induced strongly by _PROTEIN_ and mv . after treatment of arabidopsis seedlings for h with _PROTEIN_ or a or fold increase in _LOCATION_ transcription was observed respectively as compared with untreated seedlings . we also measured the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ after cold drought and high light _PROTEIN_ treatments . both cold and _PROTEIN_ stresses enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ significantly . on the basis of our results and previous reports we hypothesized that _LOCATION_ and the gcc box are involved in the regulation of ros responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we first analyzed the ability of _LOCATION_ to bind to the gcc box by electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . we _PROTEIN_ recombinant his tagged _LOCATION_ protein in e. coli . although the majority of the recombinant _LOCATION_ was present in inclusion bodies a small proportion of soluble _LOCATION_ bound strongly to the box . when the box fragment was used as the probe binding of _LOCATION_ to the box fragment was competed efficiently by unlabeled box . the mutant gcc box which contained two point mutations could neither bind to _LOCATION_ nor compete with the binding of the wild type gcc box which indicated that _LOCATION_ bound specifically to the gcc box . to see whether _LOCATION_ also binds these promoters in planta and that this binding is affected by ros stress in vivo we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ for the chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assay . western blot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ abundance was significantly increased in d old seedlings treated with _PROTEIN_ ros or aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid whereas the amount of _LOCATION_ protein was relatively low or undetectable under normal growth conditions . thus the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ transgenic plants treated for h by _PROTEIN_ were selected for further analysis . the _PROTEIN_ assay was performed for the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ protein using a _PROTEIN_ specific monoclonal antibody . after immunoprecipitation of dna/protein complexes the dna was recovered and analyzed by pcr . previous reports show that significant changes of gene _PROTEIN_ occur in response to oxidative stress including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peroxidase and _PROTEIN_ which are well known oxidative signaling components . we attempted to identify box in the upstream regions of these genes by performing a scan with mast . the bioinformatics data indicated that out of genes contain typical box in the promoters . the _PROTEIN_ of several genes _PROTEIN_ induced by ros was also examined by qrt pcr . the results show that the _PROTEIN_ of these gene was were indeed induced by _PROTEIN_ . thus primer combinations were chosen that amplify fragments of approximately bp within the promoter of the ros responsive genes that encompass the box . the promoters of ros responsive genes tested were all enriched in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ seedlings . representative qrt pcr results of ros responsive genes are shown in figure . promoters from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ exhibited significant enrichments of pcr products after _PROTEIN_ treatment whereas the negative control from the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence was not enriched by _PROTEIN_ in the same samples . these results confirmed the in vivo binding of _LOCATION_ to the promoters of ros responsive genes containing the cis element . to determine further whether _LOCATION_ mediated the ros induced transcriptional activity of the box motif transient _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed in which luc as the reporter and _LOCATION_ as the effector were cotransformed into arabidopsis leaves . the data obtained indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of the reporter construct increased significantly in the presence of _LOCATION_ which suggests that _LOCATION_ is an activator of gcc box mediated transcription . furthermore when was applied the luciferase activity was increased fold in the presence of _LOCATION_ as compared with the control which indicates that could also activate _LOCATION_ via an unknown transcription independent mechanism . to further investigate the role of the _LOCATION_ gene in the transcription of ros responsive genes we identified transfer dna insertion mutants _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the positions of the transfer dna insertions for the alleles are nucleotides and respectively . the qrt pcr results showed that _LOCATION_ is a null mutant and _LOCATION_ is a knockdown allele . under our normal growth conditions in soil adult _LOCATION_ mutant plants were smaller than wild type plants displaying an approximately reduction of fresh weight compared with the wild type . the young leaves turned a darker brown in _LOCATION_ than that in the wild type when treated with diaminobenzidine suggesting that there is more accumulation of in _LOCATION_ mutants . since we found that _LOCATION_ accumulation was stimulated by _PROTEIN_ and ros in cells it was reasonable to assume that the _LOCATION_ gene functions in photooxidative damage . thus we measured the chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameter fv/fm the maximal quantum yield of psii in wild type and mutant plants exposed to _PROTEIN_ . the treatment protocol and times at which _METHOD_ parameters were imaged are shown in figure d and e . before exposure to _PROTEIN_ treatment wild type and _LOCATION_ plants showed no difference in _PROTEIN_ fv/fm under light inside the growth chamber . however after treatment with _PROTEIN_ within and h leaves of _LOCATION_ had a lower fv/fm value than the corresponding wild type leaves . consistent with this finding type genes lost their activation under _PROTEIN_ treatment in _LOCATION_ mutants . however some of these genes did not lose their differential activation under _PROTEIN_ which might be due to the _LOCATION_ family s redundant role . these results suggest that the mutation of _LOCATION_ renders mutants more sensitive to photoinhibition possibly as a result of a _PROTEIN_ ability to regulate the _PROTEIN_ of oxidative stress responsive genes . it is well documented that application of ros can activate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . amino acid sequence analysis has also indicated that _LOCATION_ contains two putative mapk phosphorylation sites at its c terminus and a typical mapk docking sequence . thus we anticipated that _LOCATION_ might interact with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the oxidative stress response in arabidopsis . to test this hypothesis yeast two hybrid experiments were performed using arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as baits and _LOCATION_ as prey . saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that had been transformed with _LOCATION_ together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were grown on synthetic dextrose medium . the combination of _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yielded strong galactosidase _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the control combination _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ did not result in detectable galactosidase activity . these results show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted physically with _LOCATION_ in the yeast two hybrid system . to confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ we monitored the association of transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ in protoplasts of arabidopsis leaves using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . in our bifc system _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned into pspyce and _LOCATION_ was cloned into pspyne to give constructs that encoded the fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ yce _PROTEIN_ yce and _LOCATION_ yne respectively . when _PROTEIN_ yce and _LOCATION_ yne were coexpressed in protoplasts of arabidopsis leaves _METHOD_ from reconstituted yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ . however coexpression of _PROTEIN_ yce and _LOCATION_ yne did not result in _METHOD_ . in addition no _METHOD_ signal was detected with the combinations of _PROTEIN_ yce and pspyne or pspyce and _LOCATION_ yne . consistent with the localization of the interaction signal confocal microscopy of protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ fused with _METHOD_ showed that all three fusion proteins were localized in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . these results confirmed that _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ could interact in planta but _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ could not . the observations that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins was emitted from both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ and that the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ association only occurred in the _LOCATION_ prompted us to carefully examine compartments of the protein interactions by coimmunoprecipitation . to this end we isolated the _LOCATION_ from a _LOCATION_ plant and investigated _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ localization and interaction in planta . under untreated conditions both _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins could be detected in total cell extracts but not in the _LOCATION_ . interestingly after exposure of arabidopsis seedlings to _PROTEIN_ for h they could be detected by immunobloting from _LOCATION_ extracts . the coimmunoprecipitation assays also indicated that the interaction between _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurred in the _LOCATION_ after _PROTEIN_ treatment . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ protein could indeed be detected in the complex that contained _PROTEIN_ tagged _LOCATION_ protein both in the whole cell extracts and in _LOCATION_ extracts of seedlings treated with _PROTEIN_ but not in the _LOCATION_ from control experiments . consistent with this observation we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in the cytoplasm or _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ transgenic plants treated with mm . as expected in total cell extracts _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was detected in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was almost not present in the _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ transgenic plants without treatment . these results suggest that or _PROTEIN_ treatment triggers the shuttling of _LOCATION_ protein from the cytoplasm to the _LOCATION_ as well as increases _LOCATION_ accumulation in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate further whether _LOCATION_ is a substrate of _PROTEIN_ a phosphorylation assay was performed with recombinant _LOCATION_ . unfortunately the recombinant _LOCATION_ protein purified from e. coli was not suitable for the phosphorylation assay because the majority of the recombinant protein was present in inclusion bodies . therefore transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ tagged _LOCATION_ were generated . native _LOCATION_ protein from these transgenic arabidopsis seedlings was immunoprecipitated and used in an in vitro phosphorylation assay with _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure activated _PROTEIN_ could phosphorylate _LOCATION_ . no _PROTEIN_ tagged protein was immunoprecipitated from nontransgenic plants and no phosphorylation band was observed . these results indicate that _LOCATION_ is a substrate of _PROTEIN_ . as mentioned above _LOCATION_ contains two putative mapk phosphorylation sites . these sites are located within the _LOCATION_ export signal at the c terminus . to test whether both ser residues are _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites the recombinant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged c terminal peptides of _LOCATION_ were generated by mutating the ser residues to ala by site directed mutagenesis . _PROTEIN_ was able to phosphorylate the and but not the mutant proteins . the single mutation pepas or pepsa showed reduced phosphorylation as compared with that of pepwt . this suggests that both ser and ser of _LOCATION_ are independent phosphorylation sites for _PROTEIN_ . recently it has been reported that the mapk cascade activates transcription _PROTEIN_ by evoking a change in the stability of the transcription _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . we first assayed the _PROTEIN_ kinase activity induced by or _PROTEIN_ by measuring the levels of phosphorylation in wild type plants that were exposed to mm or _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure exogenous application of or _PROTEIN_ promoted the kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ in a time dependent manner . in contrast to that of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ activity was relatively weak and remained nearly unaltered by or _PROTEIN_ under the same experimental conditions . importantly in the conditional gain of function _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants dex treatment caused the constitutive accumulation of the activation form _PROTEIN_ and increased the activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a time dependent manner . interestingly _LOCATION_ protein accumulated rapidly after dex treatment with the maximum level of accumulation occurring h after the addition of dex and then _PROTEIN_ to its basal level within h . _PROTEIN_ on the other hand remained quite high and continued to rise . alternatively we determined the dynamic changes of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . as expected an increase in the activities of _PROTEIN_ was not observed after dex treatment and _LOCATION_ accumulation was not found in the null allele of _PROTEIN_ . to confirm whether the dynamic changes of _LOCATION_ are related to the phosphorylation of _LOCATION_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and its mutants _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis and then analyzed the levels of _LOCATION_ protein in the nonphosphorylated form _LOCATION_ and a phosphor mimicking mutation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . under _PROTEIN_ treatment the _LOCATION_ protein levels were increased in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ transgenic plants . consistent with the above observation _LOCATION_ plants accumulated a much lower amount of _LOCATION_ protein than plants that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . these data imply that there might be a feedback control mechanism to ensure that the _PROTEIN_ of ros responsive genes or protein levels is tightly and transiently controlled . next we employed immunoprecipitation to analyze the stability of _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex . _PROTEIN_ tagged _LOCATION_ proteins were immunoprecipitated from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ transgenic plants and the resultant protein agarose complexes were immunoblotted with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . consistent with the above analysis _PROTEIN_ protein could be detected in the complex that contained _LOCATION_ protein . importantly the binding affinity of _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ was much stronger when the complexes were isolated from cells that had been treated with as compared with untreated cells which was probably due to the phosphorylation of _LOCATION_ by activated _PROTEIN_ . in accordance with this observation the binding of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ which mimicked the _LOCATION_ phosphorylated at ser and ser was found to be stronger than the binding of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . however no clear band was observed for _LOCATION_ which mimicked the unphosphorylated form of _LOCATION_ . amino acid sequence analysis of _LOCATION_ indicated that the _LOCATION_ localization signal of _LOCATION_ overlapped with the mapk docking sequence and the leu rich nes overlapped with two independent phosphorylation sites of _LOCATION_ . activated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was localized _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . in contrast mutation of the phosphorylation sites of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ resulted in the accumulation of _METHOD_ in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . this result was not surprising because of the regulation of the _LOCATION_ feedback control mechanism that results in its dynamic changes . taken together these results showed that _PROTEIN_ controlled both the localization and activation of _LOCATION_ by phosphorylation . next we used a transient _PROTEIN_ assay to examine whether the phosphorylation of _LOCATION_ by _PROTEIN_ affected the transcriptional activity of target genes . as shown in figure a and b coexpression of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ with the luc reporter dramatically increased the luciferase activity produced . _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ the constitutively active form of _LOCATION_ increased luc _PROTEIN_ by and fold as compared with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . as expected after the leaves were transformed with _LOCATION_ induced the _PROTEIN_ of luc significantly which resulted in a fold increase as compared with leaves that transiently _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ but had not been treated with . surprisingly luciferase activity in the presence of was inhibited in leaves that transiently _PROTEIN_ either _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . it is likely that this effect was due to feedback control by the high level of _LOCATION_ protein present and the inability of _LOCATION_ to be phosphorylated by activated _PROTEIN_ respectively . importantly the transcription was not enhanced by coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and the luc reporter in the absence of _LOCATION_ . in addition coexpression of the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ effectors enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of luc by more than fold in the presence of as compared with control conditions where no effectors were present . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _LOCATION_ induced luciferase activity was dramatically inhibited by the deficiency of _PROTEIN_ even under treatment . this suggests that the effect of _LOCATION_ on transcription activation is dependent on _PROTEIN_ . we also used qrt pcr to analyze the _PROTEIN_ of some induced genes that contain a gcc box in their promoter in wild type _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ transgenic plants . as shown in figure a _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ was increased by and fold in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ plants respectively as compared with wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes was also enhanced dramatically by treatment with or overexpression of _LOCATION_ . for example the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcription were greatly increased in _LOCATION_ transgenic plants with increases of more than and fold respectively as compared with levels in wild type plants . application of also resulted in a further increase in the transcription of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ transgenic plants . the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a ros induced gene that contains a gcc box in its promoter . when was applied to _LOCATION_ lines the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was increased fold as compared with untreated plants . in addition the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna in _LOCATION_ plants was increased significantly . however treatment with had almost no effect on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ plants . similar results were obtained for other genes which included _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however the transcription levels of all the checked genes in _LOCATION_ mutants were not significantly affected even under treatment . to determine whether the increased _PROTEIN_ of the ros responsive genes in _LOCATION_ plants is dependent on _PROTEIN_ we conducted qrt pcr experiments by using _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . impressively the _PROTEIN_ of nearly all the ros responsive genes examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in both _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ compared with the _LOCATION_ transgenic plants with or without treatments . for example _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance under mm treatment in _LOCATION_ transgenic plants was or times higher than that in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ respectively . meanwhile the low basal level of this gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ did not differ much from that of _LOCATION_ mutant plants . we noticed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were still induced by treatment in _PROTEIN_ . the reason might be that other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been shown to be activated in the _PROTEIN_ module in the presence of which is involved in the regulation of the _PROTEIN_ of these genes . these data clearly indicate that _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation of _LOCATION_ is involved in the regulation of ros responsive gene _PROTEIN_ .
