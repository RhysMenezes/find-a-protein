we are studying a galacturonosyltransferase like _PROTEIN_ gene family in arabidopsis that was identified bioinformatically as being closely related to a group of genes _PROTEIN_ one of which _PROTEIN_ has been shown to encode a functional galacturonosyltransferase . here we describe the phylogeny gene structure evolutionary history genomic organization protein topology and _PROTEIN_ pattern of this gene family in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ studies demonstrate that all atgatl genes are transcribed albeit to varying degrees in arabidopsis tissues . promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ studies show that individual atgatl gene family members have both overlapping and unique _PROTEIN_ patterns . nine of the atgatl genes are _PROTEIN_ in all major plant organs although not always in all cell types of those organs . _PROTEIN_ appears to be confined to pollen grains . most of the atgatl genes are _PROTEIN_ strongly in vascular tissue in both the stem and hypocotyl . subcellular localization studies of several _PROTEIN_ proteins using yellow _METHOD_ protein tagging provide evidence supporting the _LOCATION_ localization of these proteins . plants carrying t dna insertions in three atgatl genes have reduced amounts of gala in their stem cell walls . the xylose content increased in and stem walls . glycome profiling of cell wall fractions from these mutants using a toolkit of diverse plant glycan directed monoclonal antibodies showed that the mutations affect both pectins and hemicelluloses and alter overall wall structure as indicated by altered epitope extractability patterns . the data presented suggest that the atgatl genes encode proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis but their precise roles in wall biosynthesis remain to be substantiated .
a previous study had identified _PROTEIN_ genes within the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ related gene family that have high sequence similarity . pairwise comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the whole coding regions of these proteins showed between and identity and between and similarity . the initial analysis of the _PROTEIN_ phylogeny in arabidopsis did not yield a statistically robust subclade structure for this _PROTEIN_ subfamily . subsequent inclusion of additional _PROTEIN_ protein sequences from eight additional fully sequenced plant genomes resolved the _PROTEIN_ subfamily into six subclades with robust statistical support . this substructure of the _PROTEIN_ tree remains largely unchanged by the addition of sequences from three additional sequenced plant genomes . in this analysis an additional clade _PROTEIN_ that contains only monocot genes was resolved with high statistical support . the phylogram shows a basal clade _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorfii and six clades of angiosperm _PROTEIN_ . the functional significance of the _PROTEIN_ subclades remains to be determined . all but one of the angiosperm _PROTEIN_ subclades have both monocot and dicot representatives suggesting that the divergence of the _PROTEIN_ family occurred before the evolutionary split between monocots and dicots . pairwise blast alignments were done to obtain the identities/similarities as percentages over the alignment lengths . as several of the atgatl proteins appeared as pairs of paralogs in the phylogenetic tree we investigated whether traceable genome duplication events contributed to the complexity of the _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis . the chromosomal locations of atgatl genes in relation to the segmental duplication history of these regions were analyzed . the resulting chromosome map shows that atgatl genes are only present on chromosomes i iii and iv . according to the map and constitute pairs of paralogous genes evolved from recent segmental duplication events . the _PROTEIN_ and pairs evolved from older segmental duplication events with good statistical significance . the duplication history of atgatl genes supports the observed close phylogenetic associations between some members of the atgatl family . for and no traceable duplication history could be found even though their genome positions are close to duplicated blocks . the atgatl genes are similar not only in _METHOD_ of their primary sequence and the size of their encoded proteins but also in their intron/exon organization . of the atgatl genes only and which appear as paralogs contain one intron at the same position in their untranslated region . no introns are present in any of the other atgatls . the common intron/exon organization shared by these atgatl genes supports the results from the phylogenetic analysis and the duplication history . to understand the roles of the atgatl genes in plant development we conducted semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns for all atgatl genes in different tissues taken from week old plants . analyzing different parts of the inflorescence stem makes it possible to monitor primary cell wall and secondary cell wall synthesis in a single stem simply by sectioning at different distances from the apical meristem because secondary cell wall formation increases from the top to the base of the stem . an actin gene served as a positive control because it is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all organs . all atgatl genes are _PROTEIN_ but at different levels and with different tissue distribution patterns . the majority of the atgatl genes are _PROTEIN_ at various levels in all of the different organs analyzed . however is _PROTEIN_ only in flowers . _PROTEIN_ is primarily limited to leaves upper and lower _METHOD_ and at a low level in roots . is highly _PROTEIN_ in upper and middle _METHOD_ but not in lower _METHOD_ suggesting that this gene may be involved in primary cell wall synthesis or the initiation of secondary cell wall synthesis . to extend the observations made with the rt pcr analyses we generated promoter gus reporter lines in a wild type columbia background for each of the atgatl genes by fusing the gus gene to upstream and downstream sequences of each of the atgatl genes . histochemical staining analyses of gus activity in the transgenic plants revealed _PROTEIN_ patterns that were consistent with the outcome of the rt pcr analyses done at the whole tissue level but with higher resolution . for example _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter driven by the promoter was restricted to flowers in agreement with the rt pcr analysis but was confined to pollen grains and elongating pollen tubes . the tissue/organ specific gus _PROTEIN_ profiles of all atgatls are summarized below . _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene constructs in d old seedlings was detected in the cotyledons primary leaves shoot apices and roots depending on the atgatl gene examined although frequently only in specific cell types within those tissues . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and primary leaves whereas and are only detected in primary leaves . a close examination of primary leaves shows that _PROTEIN_ and are only _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature of primary leaves . most atgatls except for and are also _PROTEIN_ in the trichomes which form complex secondary walls . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and are also _PROTEIN_ in the shoot meristem where only primary wall synthesis would be expected . all atgatl reporters with the exception of are _PROTEIN_ in roots but with distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns for each gene . is _PROTEIN_ in root tips developing _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ and at the base of extended _PROTEIN_ roots . _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in root tips and portions of older roots . the restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern of these two _PROTEIN_ might explain why no _PROTEIN_ of these genes could be detected in rt pcr analyses of whole roots . both and are only _PROTEIN_ in root tips . in addition and are strongly _PROTEIN_ throughout the root but only and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in root hairs . quite diverse patterns of _PROTEIN_ were observed in developing flowers among the various atgatl gene family members . all atgatl family members except for are _PROTEIN_ in a variety of floral organs which is consistent with the rt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ in flowers can be detected only in filaments where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can also be detected . _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in the anthers . _PROTEIN_ of was also observed in elongating pollen tubes . carpel tissue _PROTEIN_ and in the stigma and in the style . and are _PROTEIN_ in the sepals of the flower whereas _PROTEIN_ of the and genes is detected in _PROTEIN_ . all atgatl genes except and are _PROTEIN_ in senescing siliques . many atgatl members such as _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in the abscission zone and and are _PROTEIN_ in stigmatic tissue . shows a unique _PROTEIN_ pattern being _PROTEIN_ in the pedicel of the silique . the overall _PROTEIN_ patterns in young seedlings and flowers are summarized in supplemental table . the rt pcr data documented that all atgatl gene family members except for are highly _PROTEIN_ in inflorescence _METHOD_ . to determine in which cells within the _METHOD_ these genes are _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls and upper middle and lower parts of inflorescence _METHOD_ were sectioned stained and analyzed . overall atgatls show overlapping but not identical _PROTEIN_ patterns in stem and hypocotyl . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ of many of the atgatl genes is restricted primarily to the vascular tissues although the patterns of _PROTEIN_ vary depending on the atgatl gene . the simplest _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed for and _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ could be detected only in xylem and phloem respectively in different parts of _METHOD_ and hypocotyls . is _PROTEIN_ in the phloem of the upper stem and in the phloem and developing secondary xylem of the hypocotyl . in contrast _PROTEIN_ varies a lot in different parts of _METHOD_ and is _PROTEIN_ in almost all vascular tissues except for fibers and secondary xylem . it is noteworthy that _PROTEIN_ was specifically _PROTEIN_ in cells undergoing secondary wall _PROTEIN_ including interfascicular fibers and metaxylem in _METHOD_ and secondary xylem in hypocotyls . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern observed here is consistent with the finding that this gene is specifically associated with secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in fibers and vessels . interestingly shows an overlapping _PROTEIN_ pattern with _PROTEIN_ in all parts of the stem except that there is no _PROTEIN_ in fibers . in hypocotyls can only be detected in the developing secondary xylem . is specifically _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis cortex and phloem of _METHOD_ and hypocotyls . is detected in the phloem of lower _METHOD_ the cortex of hypocotyls upper and middle _METHOD_ and the epidermis of upper and middle _METHOD_ . finally is highly _PROTEIN_ in the protoxylem of all parts of the stem and the cortex of upper _METHOD_ and hypocotyls . the overall _PROTEIN_ patterns in young seedlings are summarized in supplemental table . the topology of atgatl proteins was analyzed using the plant _LOCATION_ protein database aramemnon . the overall results of these analyses are shown in supplemental table . all atgatls were predicted to be soluble proteins by this analysis . however the aramemnon database strongly predicts that all _PROTEIN_ proteins are targeted to the secretory pathway with at least half of the _METHOD_ used in aramemnon predicting an n terminal hydrophobic signal peptide domain for all of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . to establish the subcellular localization of the atgatl proteins experimentally we chose four atgatl _METHOD_ and belonging to four different _PROTEIN_ subclades _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and generated _METHOD_ tagged fusion proteins by fusing enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the c terminus of the full length atgatl proteins . the recombinant constructs were transiently coexpressed in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells with gmct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ hdel _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ constructs respectively . confocal microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of the recombinant atgatls . _METHOD_ tagged showed a punctate localization pattern when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . colocalization experiments revealed that the localization pattern of _METHOD_ is identical to that of gmct _METHOD_ which was previously shown to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . together these results demonstrate that is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . similar subcellular localizations were also observed for and proteins . the _LOCATION_ localization of the atgatl proteins is consistent with their possible role in the biosynthesis of noncellulosic polysaccharides which occurs in the _LOCATION_ . to obtain homozygous mutant plants with disruptions in the atgatl genes we screened t dna insertion lines available from the salk institute through the arabidopsis biological resource center . homozygous lines with an insertion in the exon or within the or noncoding regions were obtained for and . rt pcr of total rnas isolated from homozygous atgatl mutant lines allowed us to identify four knockout mutants and one knockdown mutant . no discernible phenotypic changes were observed in the growth or morphology of any of the mutant plants compared with the wild type under normal growth conditions . the amino acid sequences of the atgatls contain domains characteristic of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that these proteins may be involved in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis . to determine whether disruptions of the five atgatl genes caused alterations in the monosaccharide composition of total cell wall material the relative amounts of neutral monosaccharides and gala were determined for wide type and five atgatl mutant plants . _METHOD_ from week old plants were chosen for this analysis because this tissue can be harvested in large quantities and all four of the disrupted atgatl genes are highly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ based both on rt pcr and promoter gus results . compared with wide type plants and mutants showed and reduction in gala content respectively which was counterbalanced by increases in xyl in and . the _PROTEIN_ in gala content of and supports the argument that like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two other members of the _PROTEIN_ family the three atgatl genes function as putative galacturonosyl transferases involved in pectin synthesis . for and no significant changes in sugar content were observed relative to wild type plants . the glycosyl residue compositions are for cell walls isolated from inflorescence _METHOD_ of week old arabidopsis plants as determined by gc _METHOD_ of trimethyl silyl derivatives as described in materials and methods. data are mol se of three independent analyses . glycosyl residues are abbreviated as ara rha fuc xyl man gal glc and galua . to obtain a more complete picture of possible changes in cell wall composition and structure resulting from mutations in the five _PROTEIN_ genes we analyzed stem cell walls from the mutants using glycome profiling . this method involves elisa based screening of sequential extracts prepared from the plant cell walls using a toolkit of approximately plant cell wall glycan directed monoclonal antibodies that recognize diverse epitopes present on most major classes of plant cell wall polysaccharides including xyloglucans xylans pectins and arabinogalactans . glycome profiling gives information about changes both in the nature of the epitopes present in the cell walls and in the extractability of those epitopes from the walls the latter providing some information about larger scale changes in wall structure . glycome profiles of the five atgatl mutant walls show subtle differences primarily in epitope extractability patterns when compared with the glycome profile of wild type cell walls . for example the oxalate extracts of and _METHOD_ contain easily detectable levels of xyloglucan epitopes whereas the oxalate extract of wild type walls show no detectable xyloglucan . there are also subtle differences in the levels of arabinogalactan epitopes in the m koh extracts of and stem walls compared with the equivalent extract of wild type stem walls . lastly subtle differences in the extractability patterns of xylan epitopes are observable in the glycome profiles of all five atgatl mutant stem walls compared with the profile of wild type stem walls .

with suc ph at in constant white light . approximately mg of tissue samples was ground in liquid nitrogen and total rnas were extracted with the rneasy plant mini kit and treated with rnase free dnase to remove contaminating genomic dna . one microgram of total rna was reverse transcribed using superscript iii reverse transcriptase in a rt first strand synthesis reaction that contained oligo primers . rt pcr products were generated using primer sequences unique to each of the atgatl genes . semiquantitative rt pcr was performed using the following program for min to cycles of s at s at and min at then hold at for min . to determine whether comparable amounts of rna had been used for rt pcr from the different tissues the gene was used as a control . to determine atgatl transcript levels in their respective homozygous mutant lines total rnas were isolated from _METHOD_ of week old wild type and homozygous atgatl mutant lines and the gene transcript levels were analyzed according to the method described above . knockouts were defined as mutants with rt pcr reactions that yielded no detectable pcr product using gene specific primers . knockdown mutants were those that yielded significantly less but detectable pcr product compared with the wild type plants . the cell specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of the atgatl genes was studied using the gus reporter gene . for each atgatl promoter gus reporter gene construct approximately kb upstream of the predicted _PROTEIN_ start codons and to kb downstream of the predicted stop codons were pcr amplified using taq polymerase
