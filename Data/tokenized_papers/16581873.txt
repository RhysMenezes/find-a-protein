the _LOCATION_ is the _PROTEIN_ cellular storage pool where sucrose accumulates to high concentrations . while a limited number of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as v type h _PROTEIN_ and h pyrophosphatases are well characterized the majority of _LOCATION_ transporters are still unidentified among them the transporter responsible for _LOCATION_ suc uptake and release . in search of novel tonoplast transporters we used a proteomic approach analyzing the tonoplast fraction of highly purified mesophyll _LOCATION_ of the crop plant barley . we identified proteins including _LOCATION_ and putative _LOCATION_ proteins . the suc transporter was discovered among the _LOCATION_ proteins which were previously not reported in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteomic studies . to confirm the tonoplast localization of this suc transporter we constructed and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins with and its closest arabidopsis homolog _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis leaves and onion epidermal cells resulted in green _METHOD_ at the tonoplast indicating that these suc transporters are indeed located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . using a microcapillary we selected mesophyll protoplasts from a leaf protoplast preparation and demonstrated unequivocally that in contrast to the companion cell specific _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts suggesting that and _PROTEIN_ are involved in transport and _LOCATION_ storage of photosynthetically derived suc .
to understand the function of the _LOCATION_ and the interactions between the _LOCATION_ and the metabolic pathways occurring in the cytoplasm it is important to identify _LOCATION_ transporters that are involved in the export of solutes from the _LOCATION_ and the reimport in case of metabolically relevant compounds such as sugars organic acids nitrate or phosphate . to date a range of transporters have been identified but as can be deduced from _LOCATION_ localization and transport studies a large number remain uncharacterized . to identify novel tonoplast proteins we isolated highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from barley mesophyll cells . barley is an important crop plant closely related to wheat and rice . it contains only one type of mesophyll cells whereas arabidopsis has two types of mesophyll cells spongy and palisade cells . we could overcome the limiting _PROTEIN_ of tonoplast proteomic projects the requirement of highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in sufficient amounts by improving a previously described method for the isolation of _LOCATION_ from barley leaves . intact _LOCATION_ were stained with neutral red and the purity was visually checked by bright field microscopy . no obvious chloroplast or protoplast contaminations were observed . as described by citation the purity of the _LOCATION_ preparations was analyzed by the measurement of marker enzymes found in cytoplasm mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and chloroplast . contamination with these organelles was less than except for the _LOCATION_ . activities of marker enzymes in the _LOCATION_ preparations of barley mesophyll protoplasts marker enzyme activities for mitochondria chloroplasts _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ were measured in protoplast and _LOCATION_ fractions . the percentage of contamination was calculated assuming an exclusive localization of mannosidase in the _LOCATION_ . the purity of the tonoplast fractions was further confirmed by western blots . the mitochondrial marker alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ the subunit of the chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker luminal binding protein and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ were only detectable in the total _LOCATION_ protein fraction of protoplasts and not in the tonoplast fraction providing a reliable indicator of the purity of the extraction . the tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ was highly concentrated in the tonoplast fraction . an untreated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction as well as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions washed with either m naoh or m ki were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . alkaline and saline treatment reduced the proportion of bound peripheral proteins from in the untreated fraction to in the ki treated fraction and in the naoh treated fraction . cumulatively we identified proteins proteins with at least one transmembrane domain and proteins with no transmembrane domain . characterization of the identified _LOCATION_ proteins accession numbers are from ncbi . fractions are indicated by x in which each identified protein was present . the number of transmembrane domains is according to the prediction by sosui . mw predicted mr cov. sequence coverage in percent seq. sequence similarity of the closest arabidopsis homologs ref. arabidopsis

proteins accession numbers are from ncbi . fractions are indicated by x in which each identified protein was present . seq. sequence similarity of the closest arabidopsis homologs ref. indicates arabidopsis homolog found by citation a citation b citation c and citation d . all eight subunits of the sector and three subunits of the sector of the well characterized v type h _PROTEIN_ were detected as well as two _METHOD_ of the v type h pyrophosphatase indicating the high coverage of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . only one aquaporin a _PROTEIN_ like protein was identified . we additionally identified the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and homologs of the _PROTEIN_ the sodium/proton antiporter nhx and the _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter _PROTEIN_ which have been previously shown to reside in the tonoplast . we identified of subunits of the v type h _PROTEIN_ . in comparison with published arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteomic projects only citation and citation obtained such a complete set of subunits for the v type h _PROTEIN_ . despite this our proteomic analysis resulted in a limited number of known _LOCATION_ proteins . this discrepancy may be explained by the absence of some known _LOCATION_ transporters in barley mesophyll cells or barley proteins are not similar enough to permit an unequivocal attribution of peptides during the database searches . in our investigation of the tonoplast we found proteins with no transmembrane domain . most of these putative _LOCATION_ associated proteins are involved in stress response or in _LOCATION_ fusion and remodeling . we identified a few known nonvacuolar proteins including four _LOCATION_ proteins and nine soluble proteins . soluble proteins can associate with _LOCATION_ which might explain their detection in the tonoplast preparation . the view that these proteins were peripherally associated with the _LOCATION_ is supported by the _PROTEIN_ that the proportion of soluble known nonvacuolar proteins was the highest in the nontreated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction . however since the _LOCATION_ is a lytic organelle a proportion of these apparent contaminants may be a result of the ongoing degradation processes . interestingly only one _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein aquaporin was detected demonstrating the high purity of our preparations . most of the known nonvacuolar proteins were previously reported in one of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteomic studies . besides well known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins a large number of annotated _LOCATION_ proteins with an unknown subcellular localization were identified including several sugar transporters and abc proteins an amino acid transporter a peptide transporter an organic anion transporter a putative calcium translocating p type _PROTEIN_ and a putative chloride channel of the clc family . moreover there were also nine proteins with at least one transmembrane helix for which a function has yet not been elucidated . the closest arabidopsis homolog of the identified peptide transporter is _PROTEIN_ b which transports dipeptides and tripeptides and is constitutively _PROTEIN_ in all plant organs . _PROTEIN_ b was also found by citation and citation during their arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteome analysis . _PROTEIN_ another peptide transporter of the gene family has been localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results indicate that in a multigene family different members may not be localized at the same _LOCATION_ . this has also been demonstrated in studies on the subfamily of the mrp type abc transporters . one of the identified sugar transporters is a close homolog of a hexose transporter in sugar beet which has previously been postulated to catalyze facilitated diffusion of glc across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of sugar beet . facilitated diffusion of glc has also been reported to occur in barley _LOCATION_ . therefore it is highly likely that this hexose transporter is indeed localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly an additional sugar transporter identified in our proteomic approach was . was previously _PROTEIN_ in yeast and shown to catalyze suc uptake in intact yeast cells . the facilitated diffusion of suc across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of barley has already been demonstrated in earlier studies . although suc accumulation is one of the key functions of mesophyll _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ transporters responsible for suc uptake and release are as yet unidentified . the _LOCATION_ possesses specialized functions in different cell types and in different plant species . for example in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ accumulate _PROTEIN_ monosaccharides whereas in barley fructans may be synthesized and stored in _LOCATION_ . to identify proteins that are particular for the _LOCATION_ function in barley we compared the _LOCATION_ proteins found in barley to proteins identified in the four arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteomic approaches . we searched the identified _LOCATION_ proteins for the closest homologs in the arabidopsis genome . if a similarity of is used as a cutoff six proteins including the putative gag pol precursor and five hypothetical proteins have no homolog in arabidopsis . although to _LOCATION_ proteins were detected in the four arabidopsis proteomic studies only identified barley _LOCATION_ proteins have also been identified in at least one of the arabidopsis studies . the highest overlap was found with citation proteins and citation proteins . however proteins of detected barley _LOCATION_ proteins were not reported in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteomic studies suggesting a higher relative abundance of these proteins in barley leaf mesophyll _LOCATION_ compared to arabidopsis leaf mesophyll and cell culture _LOCATION_ . eighteen of these proteins are _LOCATION_ proteins including three abc transporters one amino acid transporter one putative clc type chloride channel six _LOCATION_ proteins with an unknown function and the suc transporter . the detection of in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction indicates a high _PROTEIN_ of this suc transporter in barley mesophyll cells . this can be explained by the _PROTEIN_ that barley mesophyll cells accumulate large amounts of suc during the day and that fructan synthesis in barley mesophyll _LOCATION_ requires suc . the small number of nonvacuolar proteins that we detected in comparison to the published proteomic approaches using arabidopsis _LOCATION_ reveals that the purity of our barley tonoplast fractions is clearly higher . however since the protein content of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ constitutes less than of the total cellular protein small contaminations in the range of to have a strong impact on the detected proteins . it should also be taken into account that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ contains about double the amount of protein compared to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . furthermore in mesophyll cells the surface area of chloroplastic _LOCATION_ by far exceeds that of the _LOCATION_ . consequently a contamination of with chloroplasts would result in about _LOCATION_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ fraction . _METHOD_ localization of the newly identified _LOCATION_ proteins is therefore a prerequisite to confirm their putative localization obtained with a proteomic approach . this effort has not been undertaken in the _LOCATION_ proteomic reports published so far . among the potentially novel _LOCATION_ transporters we were particularly interested in since the _LOCATION_ suc transporter which plays a central role in plant metabolism still awaits identification . as aforementioned exhibited suc transport activity over the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . however heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast does not necessarily provide information about the intracellular localization of the protein in planta . the high purity of our _LOCATION_ preparation encouraged us to test whether and its arabidopsis counterpart _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ suc transporters despite the _PROTEIN_ that the closest homologs of found in tomato and potato have been immunolocalized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of sieve elements . to confirm the tonoplast localization of and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaves and onion epidermal cells . for both transporters _METHOD_ was detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis and onion epidermal cells . as a control we cloned _PROTEIN_ a well known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suc transporter of the companion cells as a _METHOD_ fusion protein . based on _METHOD_ intensity _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . however unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast to this localization study and the closest homologs of and _PROTEIN_ were immunolocalized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of enucleate sieve elements a cell type that does not contain _LOCATION_ . thus far _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis has not been localized at the subcellular level . however promoter _PROTEIN_ studies showed high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in companion cells . high _PROTEIN_ in phloem companion cells does not exclude _LOCATION_ localization since these cells contain many small _LOCATION_ . these _LOCATION_ may play a role in temporary storage of suc that can be used at night as an energy reserve in these energy demanding cells . the results of our localization study pose the question of whether orthologs might be differently localized or whether the unusual cell structure of sieve elements cells without _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ribosomes and _LOCATION_ might entail another subcellular localization of the same protein . citation detected in their arabidopsis tonoplast proteomic analysis the suc transporter _PROTEIN_ which is strongly _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis flowers . _PROTEIN_ was also identified in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomic approach of citation . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ is localized like _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis leaves and onion epidermal cells . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as _PROTEIN_ . this observation stresses on the necessity to confirm the localization of novel candidates obtained in proteomic approaches by _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion plants exhibited a strong _PROTEIN_ in companion cells . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ exclusively in companion cells or if transcripts are also present in mesophyll cells where photosynthetic suc is stored inside the _LOCATION_ we performed a reverse transcription pcr analysis with isolated leaf mesophyll protoplasts . thirty to mesophyll protoplasts of source leaves were discriminated from smaller companion cell protoplasts chloroplast free sieve element protoplasts and large epidermal protoplasts by bright field microscopy and collected in a microcapillary . rt pcr was conducted with primers specific for the amplification of and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was used as a marker gene for companion cell contaminations . as illustrated in figure only _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in the mesophyll protoplast preparation . while in a typical leaf protoplast mixture both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were present . transcripts were detected in mesophyll cells . these results prove that and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ suc transporters of leaf mesophyll cells .
barley var . baraka was grown in soil in a controlled environment chamber and arabidopsis ecotype columbia was cultivated in soil in a controlled environment chamber . barley mesophyll _LOCATION_ were isolated from d old plants according to citation omitting bovine serum albumin in the isolation medium . tonoplast vesicles were isolated by sonication of _LOCATION_ and subsequent ultracentrifugation for h at . the supernatant was removed and the tonoplast fraction was resuspended in mm hepes koh ph at a concentration of approximately protein/ml . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were either analyzed directly or treated by washing with m ki or m naoh . proteins were quantified according to citation using the bio rad protein assay . tonoplast proteins were separated using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with acrylamide gels . the _PROTEIN_ gels were cut into sections and gel slices were immediately subjected to in gel tryptic digestion . tryptic peptides were further fractionated by reverse phase chromatography coupled online to an lcq deca xp ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer . the peptides were analyzed by _METHOD_ full scan and _METHOD_ scans of the three most intense parent ions . _METHOD_ data sets were interpreted according to the standards of citation . the _PROTEIN_ software was used to search the national center for biotechnology information protein database of the liliopsida _PROTEIN_ including proteins . dta files were created by the _PROTEIN_ software for every _METHOD_ scan with a total ion count of at least minimal peak count of and a precursor ion _METHOD_ in the range of to _METHOD_ to charge ratio . data were searched against the database restricted to tryptic peptides without modifications _PROTEIN_ allowing a parent _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ tolerance of d and daughter ion _LOCATION_ tolerance of d. all _PROTEIN_ data were analyzed by peptide and protein prophet . protein prophet is based on a statistical model that allows one to assess the reliability of protein identifications on the basis of _METHOD_ data . the protein prophet score gives a probability estimate for the protein identification . we accepted scores above at this cutoff the rate of false positive protein identifications is less than . mostly we identified the same protein from different biochemical fractions further compounding the reliability of the identification . for the identification of arabidopsis homologs we used the blast search of the munich information center for protein sequences database . in tables ii iii and iv the closest arabidopsis homologs are listed as well as the second and third homologs if the similarity differed not more than from the closest homolog . western blotting was carried out using antibodies for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luminal bip _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . secondary antibodies _PROTEIN_ were diluted or in tbst . ap detection mixture was prepared by adding of nitroblue tetrazolium and of bromo chloro indolyl phosphate to ml of ap buffer . the activity of hrp was detected using a chemiluminescence blotting substrate kit according to manufacturer 's instructions . to localize _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the respective cdnas were cloned in frame to the n terminus of _METHOD_ into the vector _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct was cloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector . _METHOD_ fusion constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion and arabidopsis epidermal cells using a helium biolistic particle delivery system . cell walls and _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis epidermal cells were stained with mm propidium iodide . _METHOD_ cells were imaged by confocal microscopy . the epidermis of arabidopsis rosette leaves was rubbed off with glass paper p . leaves were transferred into digestion buffer ph containing cellulase yc and pectolyase and incubated for h at . after digestion protoplasts were recovered by centrifugation and purified by a percoll gradient . the protoplasts were mixed with percoll ph overlaid with percoll ph and betaine buffer ph followed by centrifugation at for min . protoplasts from the interface between percoll ph and betaine buffer were recovered . the leaf protoplast suspension was visualized by bright field microscopy to distinguish between mesophyll protoplasts and other protoplasts . thirty to mesophyll protoplasts were drawn up into a microcapillary with a tip opening of approximately . total rna was extracted from the protoplasts using the picopure rna isolation kit . first strand cdna was prepared with the dna free total rna using the first strand cdna synthesis kit . the following primers were used for rt pcr _PROTEIN_ gtc atc cca cag gta att gtg tct gtt ggc _PROTEIN_ gcg gcc gct cat ggg aga ggg atg gg _PROTEIN_ cat tgt cgt ccc tca gat ggt aat atc tg _PROTEIN_ ctc gag atg aaa tcc cat agt agc ttt gaa g actin gga aca gtg tga ctc aca cca tc actin aag ctg ttc ttt ccc tct acg c cac aat ctt agg agc acc tct gtc gat cac g and cat ggg tac ctc gtt ggg tgg ttt tct tct tc .
