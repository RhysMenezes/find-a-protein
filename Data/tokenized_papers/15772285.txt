the arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of _PROTEIN_ constitutive _PROTEIN_ mutant contains a gain of function mutation in a toll receptor nucleotide binding leu rich repeat type resistance gene which leads to constitutive activation of disease resistance response against pathogens . in a screen for suppressors of _PROTEIN_ a recessive mutation designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to suppress the constitutive pathogenesis related gene _PROTEIN_ and resistance to virulent pseudomonas syringae maculicola and peronospora parasitica in _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ is also compromised in resistance mediated by resistance to peronospora parasitica _PROTEIN_ resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola _PROTEIN_ and resistance to pseudomonas syringae _PROTEIN_ . single mutant _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited enhanced disease susceptibility to p. s. pv maculicola suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for basal resistance to pathogens as well . _PROTEIN_ was identified by map based cloning and it encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to human nucleoporin . localization of the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion to the _LOCATION_ envelope further indicates that _PROTEIN_ may encode a nucleoporin suggesting that _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic trafficking plays an important role in both r gene mediated and basal disease resistance .
mutants that lost the _PROTEIN_ morphological phenotypes of small stature and curly dark green leaves were identified in the population of fast neutron mutagenized _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the progeny of these plants were further analyzed for the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene in the generation . approximately recessive mutants with no constitutive gus staining were obtained and subsequently named mos _PROTEIN_ . among them three are mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ a gene that was previously shown to be required for _PROTEIN_ signaling . the rest fall into complementation groups mapped to loci that contain no known essential components of r gene signaling . here we report the characterization and cloning of _PROTEIN_ . the isolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants are of intermediate size . the leaves of these plants are lighter green and no longer curly and the _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers slightly earlier than wild type plants . real time rt pcr was used to compare the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and no significant difference was observed . the constitutive gus reporter gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was completely suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . rt pcr analysis showed that endogenous pr _PROTEIN_ was no longer constitutively _PROTEIN_ . the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of pr in _PROTEIN_ was suppressed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was backcrossed with _PROTEIN_ the progeny exhibited _PROTEIN_ morphology indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a recessive mutation . among the progeny had gus staining suggesting that the suppression of gus _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is caused by a single recessive mutation . previously _PROTEIN_ was shown to accumulate high levels of sa . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ affects the sa level in _PROTEIN_ total sa and free sa in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were determined . as shown in figure the free sa in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is approximately fourfold lower than that in _PROTEIN_ whereas the total sa in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is fold lower indicating that the signal leading to increased sa synthesis in _PROTEIN_ is absent or dramatically reduced by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the sa level in the single mutant was similar to that in the wild type plants . to test whether the constitutive pathogen resistance in _PROTEIN_ was affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were inoculated with the virulent bacterial pathogen p.s.m . or oomycete pathogen p.p . . whereas _PROTEIN_ plants were resistant to these two pathogens the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant lost the resistance completely . the bacterial growth in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than that in wild type plants but considerably lower than the bacterial growth in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ single mutant is more susceptible to the virulent bacterial pathogen p.s.m . bacterial growth in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and columbia wild type plants was compared . as shown in figure bacterial growth in _PROTEIN_ is fold higher than that in the wild type plants . in _PROTEIN_ plants the bacterial growth is one order of magnitude higher compared with the _PROTEIN_ plants . to test whether _PROTEIN_ affects functions of genetically defined r genes _PROTEIN_ plants were inoculated with p. parasitica . in the columbia ecotype wild type plants are resistant to p.p . and the resistance is mediated by _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ nb lrr type r gene closely related to _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ was more susceptible than the wild type but less susceptible than the _PROTEIN_ control plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance to p.p . is partially compromised by _PROTEIN_ mutation . p.p . infected _PROTEIN_ leaves also displayed trailing necrosis which is a phenotype often associated with partial loss of r gene mediated resistance . in addition _PROTEIN_ supports significantly higher growth of bacterial strains carrying either or avrb suggesting that _PROTEIN_ partially affects the resistance mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well . to map the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was crossed with landsberg _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ to generate a segregating population . for crude mapping plants homozygous at the _PROTEIN_ locus were identified in the progeny on the basis of lack of _PROTEIN_ morphology . linkage was found on the bottom of chromosome . when the marker on chromosome was used two recombinants were found whereas when the marker was used no recombinant was found indicating _PROTEIN_ is south of and closely linked to . because is the last bac clone on the south end of chromosome _PROTEIN_ is most likely to be flanked by these two markers . for fine mapping randomly chosen plants derived from plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and carrying the homozygous gus reporter gene were genotyped with the markers and . a total of recombinants between these two markers were found and their seeds were collected . the phenotypes of the recombinants were subsequently determined by assessing the segregation of gus staining and the _PROTEIN_ morphological phenotype in their progeny . the phenotypes of all recombinants were perfectly correlated with the genotypes at marker suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is tightly linked to this marker . further analysis of the recombinants with additional markers indicated that _PROTEIN_ was positioned to the south of located at position kb of the bac clone . the distance between marker and the south end of chromosome is kb . this region in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr and sequenced . a single a to c point mutation was found in _GENE_ . the cdna of the gene was then obtained by sequencing three overlapping rt pcr fragments covering the gene and found to be consistent with the annotation of _GENE_ . the genbank accession number for _PROTEIN_ is . _GENE_ is identical to _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be allelic to pre which was reported at the arabidopsis conference to have an early flowering phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . microarray analysis of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants indicated that there is no significant difference in the _PROTEIN_ level of _GENE_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . comparison of the cdna sequence and the genomic sequence revealed that _GENE_ consists of six exons . the a to c mutation in _PROTEIN_ occurs at the intron acceptor site at the junction between the fifth intron and the sixth exon . this mutation results in a deletion of nucleotides in the cdna . blast analysis of _GENE_ shows that it encodes a protein with high similarity to the human nucleoporin _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal part of the yeast nucleoporin _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _GENE_ a plasmid _PROTEIN_ the cdna of _GENE_ driven by the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus was transformed into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among transgenic plants obtained displayed _PROTEIN_ morphology . _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene was also restored in the transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ morphology suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is _GENE_ . furthermore progeny of two independent transgenic lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ transgene were tested for resistance against p.p . . as shown in figure constitutive resistance to p.p . was restored in the transgenic plants . at the same time we obtained two additional mutant alleles of _GENE_ from the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in the fifth exon and _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in the second intron of _GENE_ . because the _PROTEIN_ single mutant is more susceptible to the virulent bacterial pathogen p.s.m . we tested _PROTEIN_ for enhanced disease susceptibility to this pathogen . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ supports fold more bacterial growth than wild type plants to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are allelic to _PROTEIN_ the homozygous lines were crossed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because morphology of _PROTEIN_ is recessive plus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located on different chromosomes if _PROTEIN_ is not allelic to _PROTEIN_ then of the progeny is expected to have _PROTEIN_ morphology . among plants from the cross between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ none has the _PROTEIN_ morphology suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is allelic to _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained from the cross between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore five independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were obtained from the and the morphology of these lines is indistinguishable from that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ further suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is _GENE_ . to determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . in wild type transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed predominantly on the _LOCATION_ rim suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ envelope . by comparison _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ control plants was present in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with the pbi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . as shown in figure transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein displayed _PROTEIN_ morphology suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation and the fusion protein is correctly localized in arabidopsis plants .
all plants were grown at under h h dark cycles . the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were treated with fast neutron at a dose of gy by andrea kodym . in the primary screen plants representing families were grown on soil and screened for loss of the _PROTEIN_ morphological phenotype . seeds from the putative mutants were subsequently plated on _METHOD_ medium and tested for loss of the constitutive gus reporter gene _PROTEIN_ by gus staining . mutants with no constitutive gus staining were backcrossed with _PROTEIN_ and the morphology of the plants was analyzed to determine whether the mutation is dominant or recessive . rna used for gene _PROTEIN_ analysis was extracted from d old plants grown on _METHOD_ medium using the totally rna kit from ambion . reverse transcription was performed using the rt for pcr kit from clontech . real time pcr was performed using the quantitect sybr green pcr kit from qiagen . the primers used for amplification of pr pr and _PROTEIN_ were described previously . infection of wild type and mutant arabidopsis thaliana with pseudomonas syringae maculicola was performed on week old plants and infection of peronospora parasitica was performed on week old seedlings as described . sa was extracted and measured using a previously described procedure . to introgress the columbia _PROTEIN_ mutation into the landsberg ecotype background _PROTEIN_ was backcrossed with wild type landsberg plants six times . a single line homozygous for _PROTEIN_ was selected from the population of the sixth backcross and designated ler _PROTEIN_ . this line was confirmed to contain homozygous landsberg sequences at each arm of the five chromosomes . to map the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ was crossed with ler _PROTEIN_ . crude mapping was performed on the plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and fine mapping was performed on plants derived from plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ while carrying the homozygous gus reporter gene . both morphology and gus staining of the progeny were used to confirm the phenotypes of the mapping lines . the markers used for mapping were designed according to the monsanto arabidopsis polymorphism and landsberg sequence collections . marker was amplified with primers cttaataaagttggttcaaccg and _PROTEIN_ and the columbia fragment was bp shorter than the landsberg fragment . marker was amplified with primers aagttttcgagatgcgctgc and caccttttgctttggccgtc and the columbia fragment was bp shorter than the landsberg fragment . marker was amplified with primers aactatacaggccgcattaac and _PROTEIN_ and the columbia fragment was bp shorter than the landsberg fragment . marker was amplified with primers cgtgacagcgctggctgag and cgttctggtttcgtctggag and the single nucleotide polymorphism was detected by sequencing the pcr fragments . to confirm that the mutation identified in _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was amplified by rt pcr cloned into and transformed into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants by the floral dipping method . transgenic plants were selected on _METHOD_ plates containing of kanamycin . the t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for the t dna insertions were identified by pcr using primers gggatttgttgcacagcttc and actcattcacgcttctaagg which flank the insertions . to identify the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was crossed with wild type plants containing gus . plants were genotyped for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations by pcr . lines homozygous for _PROTEIN_ with no _PROTEIN_ mutation were kept as _PROTEIN_ single mutants and used for further analysis . to fuse _PROTEIN_ to the _METHOD_ gene full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr and cloned into the pbs _METHOD_ vector . the resulting plasmid was sequenced to confirm that the fusion was in frame without pcr mistakes . the fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was subsequently excised and cloned into to obtain pbi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . pbi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used to transform _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the wild type plants transgenic plants were selected on _METHOD_ medium containing of kanamycin . roots of the transgenic seedlings were examined for _METHOD_ by confocal microscopy as described previously . sequence data from this article have been deposited with the embl/genbank data libraries under accession number .
