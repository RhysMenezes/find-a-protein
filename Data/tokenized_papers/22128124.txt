compartmentation of the eukaryotic cell requires a complex set of subcellular messages including multiple retrograde signals from the chloroplast and mitochondria to the _LOCATION_ to regulate gene _PROTEIN_ . here we propose that one such signal is a phosphonucleotide _PROTEIN_ which accumulates in arabidopsis thaliana in response to drought and high light _PROTEIN_ stress and that the enzyme _PROTEIN_ regulates its levels by dephosphorylating _PROTEIN_ to amp . _PROTEIN_ accumulates in chloroplasts and mitochondria but not in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate fold more _PROTEIN_ without a marked change in inositol phosphate levels demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is a primary in vivo substrate . significantly transgenic targeting of _PROTEIN_ to either the _LOCATION_ or chloroplast of _PROTEIN_ mutants lowers the total _PROTEIN_ levels and _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ inducible ascorbate gene . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ must be able to move between cellular compartments . the mode of action for _PROTEIN_ could be inhibition of to exoribonucleases as _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ xrns modulate the _PROTEIN_ of a similar subset of _PROTEIN_ and drought inducible genes _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate xrn substrates and _PROTEIN_ can inhibit yeast xrns . we propose a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ retrograde pathway that can alter _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ and drought stress .
we previously showed that the lack of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant promotes constitutive _PROTEIN_ luciferase _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue . here we investigated the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in mature leaf tissue by reporter gene analyses . _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was stronger in the vascular tissue than in the mesophyll tissue of the leaf . the vascular tissue is the primary site of production of especially after _PROTEIN_ stress . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ induction of in _PROTEIN_ vascular tissue was much lower and the total foliar level of plants grown under normal conditions was half of that in the wild type . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ luc activity with the loss of _PROTEIN_ leading to increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reduced levels in the vasculature . furthermore it demonstrates that the elevated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ regulated genes is not due to elevated levels of . in vitro _PROTEIN_ has a dual phosphatase activity against both polyphosphoinositols such as and biphosphate nucleotides such as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and have been reported to be in vivo substrates _PROTEIN_ has been suggested as a substrate based on work with transgenic plants . we used two different approaches to investigate if the _PROTEIN_ phosphatase activity against _PROTEIN_ regulated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and thus ros levels . first we tested the hypothesis that accumulation of _PROTEIN_ could upregulate the _PROTEIN_ promoter and induce the _PROTEIN_ phenotype by feeding _PROTEIN_ to columbia plants transformed with the reporter gene _PROTEIN_ luc . however no significant change in _PROTEIN_ luc activity was observed when feeding increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ to d old plants via the roots under either low light or _PROTEIN_ . failed root substrate uptake or impaired vasculature transport import into leaf cells or perception are possible explanations for the negative results of the feeding experiment . next we directly measured inositol phosphates in the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant harbors a point mutation in _PROTEIN_ that renders the recombinant protein enzymatically inactive whereas the _PROTEIN_ allele is a t dna insertion mutant . both mutants in the col background lacked detectable _PROTEIN_ protein and showed very similar rosette morphology . the third mutant _PROTEIN_ previously described in the _PROTEIN_ background was reported to have increased and increased by to fold was recently reported in another _PROTEIN_ mutant as measured by displacement bioassays . it was not revealed whether other ip compounds could be affected . to test this we grew young seedlings in the presence of radiolabeled myo inositol and showed that all the ip pools were similar in col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . finally we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is the in vivo substrate of _PROTEIN_ and developed a highly sensitive and specific _METHOD_ labeling based hplc method for quantification of these nucleotides . using this technique we could clearly quantify _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ based on the _METHOD_ of plant extracts with adenosines derivatized to enable their detection by _METHOD_ spectroscopy . we found that _PROTEIN_ accumulated fold in three _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and compared with wild type plants . there was also a significant but minor increase in _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and no significant changes in adenosine phosphosulfate the sole precursor of _PROTEIN_ and an intermediate in the synthesis of cys . nor was there any change in gsh the storage form of cys . the specific and substantial increase of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants provides the first direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ has in vivo nucleotidase activity preferentially against _PROTEIN_ . quantification of nucleotide phosphates and glutathione related metabolites the correlation between higher _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ and drought tolerance led us to investigate a role for this metabolite during abiotic stress responses . thus we analyzed _PROTEIN_ levels in response to drought and _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ levels increased fold in leaves of drought stressed wild type plants coincident with a substantial _PROTEIN_ in plant relative water content after to d of drought . analysis of variance _PROTEIN_ two _PROTEIN_ analyses indicated strong interaction between day and genotype for rwc and _PROTEIN_ being significantly higher for _PROTEIN_ relative to col . this increase did not occur in the early phase of drought and was observed only when there was a decline in rwc . a similar trend was observed for _PROTEIN_ but it was delayed again with _PROTEIN_ only rising as rwc declined . similarly exposure of col plants to _PROTEIN_ for just h resulted in significantly higher _PROTEIN_ levels than in plants kept at ll _PROTEIN_ although this increase was much smaller than that observed during drought . taken together these results revealed that the level of the sulfur related metabolite _PROTEIN_ was elevated in mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ and increased in response to at least two abiotic stresses . contrasting results have been obtained _PROTEIN_ the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . to resolve this debate we used three different methods to investigate _PROTEIN_ location . first a full length _PROTEIN_ fused at the c terminus to _METHOD_ accumulated in both chloroplasts and mitochondria of transiently transformed arabidopsis cells . the chloroplasts and mitochondria were visualized by red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to either the small subunit _PROTEIN_ of ribulose bis phosphate _PROTEIN_ transit peptide or to the targeting domain of the alternative _PROTEIN_ respectively . second to verify that this _PROTEIN_ pattern was not an artifact due to the use of transitory _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we generated stable transgenic lines . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the native promoter showed _PROTEIN_ in both organelles in mesophyll protoplasts isolated from stably transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . the chloroplasts were visualized by chlorophyll _METHOD_ and the mitochondria by mitored . effectively all compartmentalized _METHOD_ could be attributed to either mitochondria or chloroplasts not _LOCATION_ . third we developed a new chloroplast and _LOCATION_ fractionation method that allowed us to detect _PROTEIN_ unequivocally as an kd band in purified chloroplast and mitochondria fractions of col leaves by immunological methods . the molecular _METHOD_ of this band matches that of the recombinant protein lacking the deduced amino acid chloroplast transit peptide . the relative purity of the fractions was demonstrated by probing with antibodies against chloroplastic lhcb mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was enriched in the _LOCATION_ fraction and although there was a band in the chloroplast fraction it is of lower molecular _METHOD_ than _PROTEIN_ and as it is the same size as rubisco it is likely that this is a cross reaction to rubisco . significantly neither lhcb _PROTEIN_ nor the unprocessed or mature _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . we attempted to assay _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ fractions used for the protein purification but we observed that _PROTEIN_ is labile in tissue extracts and as a consequence it was not detected after the lengthy purification procedure . however analyses of phosphonucleotides from col chloroplasts prepared by a different more rapid protocol identified a peak that matched that of the _PROTEIN_ standard suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is present in the chloroplasts of arabidopsis . all this evidence supports the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in mitochondria and chloroplasts and that _PROTEIN_ can be detected in chloroplasts . having demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is required for the catabolism of _PROTEIN_ we sought to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ could act as a mobile signal within the cell capable of entering the _LOCATION_ and regulating gene _PROTEIN_ . due to the aforementioned technical difficulties of measuring adenosines in different cellular compartments we used a genetic approach to test the hypothesis of _PROTEIN_ movement by the analysis of plant lines with _PROTEIN_ targeted to different subcellular compartments kindly provided by citation and citation . in these earlier studies the authors reported on partial complementation of morphological phenotypes but neither _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ retrograde signaling nor stress tolerance was measured in these studies . first does the chloroplast localized _PROTEIN_ regulate _PROTEIN_ concentration ? given the unexpected dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast and mitochondria it was necessary to determine if chloroplast localized _PROTEIN_ can modulate _PROTEIN_ levels . targeting the yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast using the transit peptide of the rubisco _PROTEIN_ resulted in a significant lowering of _PROTEIN_ levels and _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation demonstrating that chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ functions in regulating _PROTEIN_ content and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels . second can _PROTEIN_ move between cellular compartments ? targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ resulted in complete complementation of _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance in ll and drought stressed leaves _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance in ll and _PROTEIN_ treated leaves and the viability of plants in response to terminal drought . the combined results of the targeting experiments indicate that the degree of complementation of _PROTEIN_ levels is somewhat proportional to the degree of complementation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . more importantly they show that _PROTEIN_ can be catabolized by either _LOCATION_ or chloroplastic targeting of _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ can move between subcellular compartments . survival of and _PROTEIN_ levels of stress inducible genes in col _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ complemented with _PROTEIN_ directed to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ compartment given that _PROTEIN_ levels are elevated in _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ is known to inhibit the activity of the yeast xrns we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ could regulate the _PROTEIN_ of stress responsive genes via attenuation of xrn mediated rna catabolism . although the arabidopsis xrns are less well characterized than their s. cerevisiae counterparts they play key roles in multiple rna processing pathways and as posttranscriptional gene silencing suppressors . the xrns belong to a small gene family in arabidopsis with three members . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are homologs of _PROTEIN_ and are _LOCATION_ localized . by contrast the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is a functional homolog of s. cerevisiae . identified substrates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are excised hairpin loops that form part of precursor mirna transcripts which also accumulate in _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ is involved in mrna decay by degrading the resulting cleavage products of microrna targets . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ transcriptome revealed that transcripts for genes that are confirmed targets of mirnas were increased by at least threefold . as probes for affymetrix arrays are biased toward the region of genes we tested whether this reflected increased abundance of full length mrna or accumulation of cleaved transcripts due to inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by increased _PROTEIN_ levels . we undertook quantitative real time pcr of four mirna targets using primers specific for sequences or spanning the mirna cleavage site . the uncleaved transcripts did not increase rather the cleavage products for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated to higher levels in both _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type with _PROTEIN_ showing the highest increase . the accumulation of cleavage products in _PROTEIN_ that should otherwise be degraded by xrns is consistent with xrns being inhibited in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to determine if xrns and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ regulate a common set of genes we undertook gene _PROTEIN_ profiling in the _PROTEIN_ accumulating _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we used affymetrix genechip arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genome arrays to analyze global changes in transcript abundance between col and the mutant genotypes . whole rosettes of seedlings at the true leaf stage of development were used for analysis of each genotype . we found that for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ there were and transcripts respectively that showed a significant change in transcript abundance _PROTEIN_ relative to col . by contrast only transcripts were significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ compared with col . this low level of transcriptome change in _PROTEIN_ is consistent with previous transcriptome profiling data of _PROTEIN_ . more importantly there was a large and significant overlap between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript profiles . of the genes upregulated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also upregulated in _PROTEIN_ which is a significantly greater overlap than would be expected by random chance while only transcripts showed an antagonistic response _PROTEIN_ which is statistically fewer than would be expected by chance . similarly in the downregulated transcript set there was a significant overlap of between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcriptome and that of _PROTEIN_ again with lower levels of antagonistic change than would be expected by random chance . additionally coexpression of four highly upregulated transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ microarray in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by qrt pcr . furthermore the fold change of all genes upregulated by more than fivefold was also comparable for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transcripts encoding transferases transporters hormone related transcription _PROTEIN_ and starch synthase were coexpressed in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the same extent . a subset of coregulated genes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are fivefold up or downregulated compared to col finally comparison of all coexpressed genes up or downregulated by more than threefold against a series of microarray experiments revealed a high degree of coexpression under _PROTEIN_ aba drought stress and a combined moderate _PROTEIN_ and mild drought on a plant with a defective mitochondrial stress inducible protein _PROTEIN_ . this same set of genes was not differentially _PROTEIN_ in ll or under different light quality and wavelengths nor was the set similarly coexpressed upon treatment with the _LOCATION_ translational inhibitor lincomycin that suppresses gun regulated genes . both known to induce some _PROTEIN_ responsive genes and the mitochondrial respiratory complex i inhibitor rotenone resulted in increased _PROTEIN_ of some of the upregulated genes but the converse was observed for the downregulated genes . this suggests the coexpressed set of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ regulated genes respond to specific organelle signals such as _PROTEIN_ but not translational inhibitors such as lincomycin . to investigate further the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in stress signal transduction pathways we focused on the _PROTEIN_ of the model chloroplast stress responsive genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the xrn mutants . our analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcriptome data revealed that neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ is upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . thus we focused on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we aimed to mimic _PROTEIN_ inhibition of the _LOCATION_ xrns by comparing the induction of stress responsive genes between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutants under both ll and _PROTEIN_ conditions . indeed mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ were remarkably similar in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants for nonstressed leaves with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ being induced in all three mutants but less so in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . overall all the mutants exhibited around fold higher levels of _PROTEIN_ and to fold increased _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . under _PROTEIN_ stress _PROTEIN_ was hyperinduced to the same extent in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and again this was not substantially different between the three mutants yet it was fold higher than the induction in col . the results were comparable for _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ being of a similar order of magnitude to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants although attenuated . this is consistent with the observations that _PROTEIN_ is regulated by multiple signaling pathways in response to _PROTEIN_ stress including aba glutathione metabolism and plastoquinone redox state as well as _PROTEIN_ . the results presented above clearly indicate that _LOCATION_ xrns are negative regulators of stress inducible genes . significantly a triple mutant in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ xrns was better able to survive drought when compared with the wild type in a soil based experiment indicating that xrns are regulators of the drought response . to elucidate whether _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ xrns mediate the drought response we investigated the degree of drought tolerance of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and we also included a second _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ mutants survived the drought almost longer compared with the wild type as previously shown . interestingly plants with impaired _LOCATION_ xrn activity _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not those in which the _LOCATION_ homolog was mutated _PROTEIN_ survived longer than the wild type but not as long as the _PROTEIN_ mutants . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ can stimulate gene _PROTEIN_ by repressing the activity of the _LOCATION_ xrns . that is _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ negatively regulate the _PROTEIN_ of the stress responsive genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the drought response most likely via the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway .

function in the partek genomics suite and in all cases r . the values of gene _PROTEIN_ after normalization with gc content background robust multi array average were analyzed to identify differentially _PROTEIN_ genes by a regularized t test based on a bayesian statistical framework using the software program cyber t . cyber t employs a mixture model based method described by citation

in transcript abundance were considered significant with a _PROTEIN_ > and a fold change > fold . overlaps in the transcript abundance responses for the different genotypes were plotted on venn
