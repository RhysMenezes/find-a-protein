plants have large families of proteins sharing a conserved eight cysteine motif domain . the biological functions of these proteins are largely unknown . _PROTEIN_ is a cold responsive arabidopsis gene that encodes a hybrid proline rich protein with a three domain architecture a putative signal peptide at the n terminus a proline rich domain in the middle and an domain at the c terminus . we report here that yeast cells _PROTEIN_ different _PROTEIN_ genes had significantly higher rates of freezing survival than empty vector transformed controls . arabidopsis plants with knocked down _PROTEIN_ genes had an increased tendency for freezing induced cellular damage . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transgenic plants and immunoblot analyses using protoplasts suggested cell wall localization for _PROTEIN_ proteins . immunoblot analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ proteins form higher order complexes in plants and that the prd is a soluble and the an insoluble protein domain . we propose that _PROTEIN_ proteins have a bimodular architecture in which the prd may interact with the cell wall and the domain with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to protect the cells during freezing stress .
_PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is controlled by a multitude of environmental cues . among those signals cold was previously shown to highly upregulate and then persistently _PROTEIN_ the steady state transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna . it was previously shown that when stressed by freezing temperatures non acclimated plant lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ from the strong and constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter leaked fewer electrolytes compared to the wild type plants suggesting that the gene may play a role in protecting plant cells by stabilizing cell _LOCATION_ structures . to further investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ a plant line in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was knocked down by the rna interference mechanism was analyzed . the rnai construct was designed to target the eight cysteine motif region of _PROTEIN_ with strong similarity to the other three closely related _PROTEIN_ like genes which might have affected their _PROTEIN_ levels as well . to confirm this transcript levels in the rnai and wild type lines were compared by rna gel blot analysis . as shown in fig . transcript levels of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and were all lower in cold acclimated rnai knockdown than in wild type plants although all genes most visibly _GENE_ were still cold inducible in the knockdown plants . however cold acclimated rnai plants had a tendency to leak more electrolytes at freezing temperatures than wild type plants suggesting that their cold acclimation response was at least partially affected by the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ genes . to determine the potential contribution of individual _PROTEIN_ genes in protecting cells against freezing damage _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and were individually _PROTEIN_ in the budding yeast s. cerevisiae and survival of cells was tested after a h freezing period . compared to yeast cells containing only empty pesc ura plasmids cells harboring either _PROTEIN_ or had a statistically significant increase in survival rates after a h freezing period . while not significant yeast cells containing _GENE_ also had a tendency to improve freezing survival rates . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ and at least two of its paralogs protect heterologous yeast cells against freezing death . to determine whether the myc tagged _PROTEIN_ and myc tagged _PROTEIN_ like recombinant proteins were _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae immunoblot analyses using anti myc antibodies and anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum were done . as shown in fig . each recombinant protein was detectable by anti myc antiserum indicating that the proteins were produced at various levels in the yeast cells subjected to freezing stress . when the same protein fractions were incubated with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ but not or were recognized by the antiserum . this suggested that the polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies crossreacted with the more closely related paralog _GENE_ but not with and which are more closely related to each other than to _PROTEIN_ or _GENE_ . to begin characterizing native _PROTEIN_ proteins polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used to analyze proteins isolated from arabidopsis plants . anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum recognized a single band when proteins from cold acclimated wild type or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using loading buffer with the reducing agent mercaptoethanol . however when the reducing agent was omitted from the loading buffer both apparent monomers and higher order complexes were recognized by the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum in proteins from cold acclimated wild type or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants but not in proteins from rnai plants . thus the abundance of the monomers and higher order protein complexes recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum was depended on the genetic background and temperature treatment of different arabidopsis lines and correlated well with rna transcript levels in those lines . as shown in fig . higher molecular weight bands were still detectable in proteins from cold acclimated plants probed with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum that was affinity purified using _PROTEIN_ monomers cut out from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . a protein band of approximately twice the size of an _PROTEIN_ monomer was the most abundant band seen in immunoblots probed with the affinity purified antiserum . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis possibly interacts with itself and/or other proteins such as _GENE_ to form larger protein complexes . because it was reported that green tissues such as leaves and petioles are more competent to cold acclimate than roots the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ was determined . there was indeed a higher amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in green tissues than in roots . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously but preferentially in cold acclimation competent tissues . to further study the _PROTEIN_ protein at the molecular level a his tagged _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . a majority of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was always found in insoluble fractions presumably as a result of sequestration into inclusion bodies . considering that formation of inclusion bodies might result from the absence of proper disulfide bond formation of proteins in the e. coli cytoplasm different strategies were used to either direct the recombinant protein to the periplasmic region or to promote the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm by using an e. coli strain with a more oxidizing cytoplasmic environment . however neither of these strategies helped to improve the solubility of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that different redox environments did not affect its solubility . together with the hydropathy profile of _PROTEIN_ these experimental results suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a hydrophobic protein or prone to form insoluble aggregates . as shown in fig . when the proline rich domain and the region of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ separately as his tagged recombinant proteins in e. coli the solubility of the two domains became distinct . while the prd was completely soluble the domain was almost exclusively found in the insoluble fraction suggesting that this region is either highly hydrophobic or aggregates easily in solution . _PROTEIN_ of the solubility besides apparent monomers higher order complexes were detected for both _PROTEIN_ peptide domains in the immunoblot analyses . when protein samples were treated with the reducing agent me the prd complexes were resolved into apparent monomers while the region was largely unaffected by the treatment . the presence of a signal peptide in the conceptual amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ suggests that it is a secreted protein which would correlate well with _PROTEIN_ s hypothetical role of protecting the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or cell wall structures . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is a secreted protein the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found at peripheral regions in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ root cells but not in wild type plants . a similar cell peripheral localization pattern was observed in root hair cells of cold acclimated plants using anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum and immunohistochemical analysis . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ localized to the plant cell wall or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell walls were removed from cold acclimated wild type leaves and protoplasts were isolated . when equal amounts of proteins from whole cells and protoplasts were incubated with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum only a small amount of _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in protoplasts . taken together this suggested that _PROTEIN_ is secreted into the cell wall but may also have some affinity for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
