ypt/rab _PROTEIN_ act as key regulators of intracellular traffic through the conformational differences exhibited by their _PROTEIN_ or gdp bound _METHOD_ . in this paper two arabidopsis homologues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were characterized and compared . using a live cell imaging approach it is shown that yellow _METHOD_ protein fusions _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ locate to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ in both nicotiana tabacum and in arabidopsis thaliana . in addition _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ targets an as yet unknown compartment not labelled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ markers . it is also shown that the subcellular location of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is affected by the state of _PROTEIN_ binding and that _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant results in increased apoplastic _METHOD_ of a secretory form of _METHOD_ .
to investigate the location of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plants green or yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this construction has proved successful with several rab _PROTEIN_ as the fusion does not seem to obstruct the location of the protein of interest although function can be compromised . tobacco leaves were inoculated with serial dilutions of agrobacterium containing either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the abaxial epidermis was imaged h post inoculation . at of or less _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in mobile punctate structures approximately in apparent diameter and also as diffuse cytoplasmic _METHOD_ . co _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ in this system . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also labelled a second subpopulation of mobile punctate structures with a smaller apparent diameter than the _LOCATION_ that were not labelled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these smaller structures were not observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating a possible difference in targeting of the two _PROTEIN_ h _METHOD_ . these smaller structures were also present when _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ and they did not co locate with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labels a separate compartment . similar sized structures have been observed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently transformed into tobacco leaf epidermal cells . these were interpreted as artefacts of over _PROTEIN_ although here they were found at varying _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to investigate if these structures are the same as those labelled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the two constructs were co _PROTEIN_ and confocal images were acquired d after infiltration . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co located with the larger sized structures labelled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which were earlier identified as _LOCATION_ stacks . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in most instances did not co locate with the subpopulation of smaller structures labelled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to investigate if the small punctate structures labelled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ would co locate with a marker of the prevacuolar compartment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . little co location was observed with this marker . residual labelling of a reticulate network was apparent when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco . to confirm the background labelling as _LOCATION_ and not _LOCATION_ the constructs were co _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel which marked as expected the polygonal network of short interconnecting tubules and various shaped cisternae was observed . however the _METHOD_ seen from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was more diffuse and did not co locate with the _LOCATION_ . transgenic a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated . _METHOD_ from stably transformed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thaliana seedlings was observed throughout the plant in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenics and both fusion constructs were seen to target punctate structures which were highly mobile in the _PROTEIN_ root root hairs and in leaves . in addition _LOCATION_ labelling was also observed as seen in transiently transformed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tobacco leaves . punctate structures labelled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ extensively co localized with the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker nag _METHOD_ in root tips . to confirm that the labelled structures were _LOCATION_ transgenic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . thaliana were high pressure frozen freeze substituted and immunogold labelled with _METHOD_ anti serum . low levels of gold labelling of both constructs were observed on the _LOCATION_ . on average three gold particles were found to be evenly distributed over the _LOCATION_ stacks but were not found on other organelles . when brefeldin a was applied to arabidopsis root tips _PROTEIN_ nag _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a portion of the _METHOD_ signal apparently dissociated from the _LOCATION_ marker and accumulated in the core of the bfa body that contains endosomal and tgn markers . the partial relocation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the bfa bodies was confirmed by labelling the endosomes and tgn with . as shown in fig . prior to bfa treatment labelled compartments showed limited co localization with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but were often in close proximity as reported before for _LOCATION_ markers . after a min treatment with bfa _METHOD_ co localized partially with in the core of the bfa body . significant quantities of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were excluded from the bfa bodies or remained associated with their periphery where _LOCATION_ stacks accumulated . thus a portion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ may exist on bfa sensitive _LOCATION_ associated tgn or endosomal _LOCATION_ . rab _PROTEIN_ cycle between an active _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ bound form and an inactive _LOCATION_ gdp bound form . to investigate the nucleotide dependency of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelling pattern mutants were generated that were predicted to be deficient in _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis or nucleotide binding . exchanging the serine or threonine of the end of the region _PROTEIN_ the affinity for both _PROTEIN_ and gdp but the affinity for gdp has been shown to be higher than for _PROTEIN_ . to determine the effect of gdp binding on the location of the two rab h _METHOD_ mutants of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . two to three days after _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mobile structures of approximately were apparent together with diffuse labelling of the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled punctate structures co located with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however introduction of the mutation appeared to eliminate targeting to the smaller structures labelled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently transformed into tobacco leaf epidermal cells at the same _PROTEIN_ level as the wild type only the _LOCATION_ network was labelled . no other structures in the cell were observed to be targeted by this construct irrespective of the _PROTEIN_ level or the time of confocal analysis . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ hdel little or no accumulation on the _LOCATION_ could be detected . thus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is apparently _LOCATION_ in contrast to the _LOCATION_ labelling observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants of several small _PROTEIN_ have been generated by altering glutamate of the region to leucine . to investigate the effect of this mutation on the subcellular location of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . at h post inoculation both mutants targeted _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . as with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled a subpopulation of smaller punctate structures that were not targeted by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that changing glutamate to leucine at position did not markedly change the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . similarly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ located like its wild type counterpart to the _LOCATION_ but not to the second population of smaller structures labelled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in mammalian cells over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causes _LOCATION_ located proteins to relocate to the _LOCATION_ in a microtubule dependent manner . to determine if the same would occur in plants agrobacterium strains harbouring the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were infiltrated at increased titres and co _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . no effect was observed on the _LOCATION_ location of any of these marker proteins for either rabh construct . mutation of asparagine to isoleucine in the _PROTEIN_ motif is predicted to reduce the affinity of the protein for both gdp and _PROTEIN_ . two days post inoculation of tobacco leaves with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ each protein exhibited purely _LOCATION_ labelling irrespective of the relative _PROTEIN_ level or the time of analysis . however compared to the wild type and other mutants only a few cells were observed to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that these mutants might be unstable when transiently _PROTEIN_ . most rab proteins are tightly associated with _LOCATION_ through the post translational addition of two geranylgeranyl _PROTEIN_ groups to two conserved cysteines in the extreme c terminus . . these two cysteines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were replaced with serine creating _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be completely _LOCATION_ d after infiltration . this result is consistent with the lack of insertion into a _LOCATION_ owing to the absence of isoprenyl groups . to investigate the stability of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the mutants protein extracts were isolated after d and d from agrobacterium transformed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tobacco plants . the extracts were probed with anti _METHOD_ antibodies to determine the stability of the _METHOD_ fusions . in all cases except for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a single band of full length protein including the _METHOD_ fusion was detected indicating that each fusion construct was stable and that _LOCATION_ labelling did not reflect free _METHOD_ . by contrast little or no cross reacting protein was detected in extracts of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells consistent with the general lack of _METHOD_ similar results were observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ wild type and mutants . citation showed that both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were able to bind _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ overlay assay . interestingly it is shown here that the putatively gdp bound mutant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is able to bind to the _LOCATION_ while the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was completely _LOCATION_ . these results could indicate that the two rab h _METHOD_ bind to the _LOCATION_ in a different manner where _PROTEIN_ is able to bind the _LOCATION_ also in a gdp bound state . alternatively _PROTEIN_ may retain normal _PROTEIN_ binding activity . to establish whether _PROTEIN_ is indeed compromised in its ability to bind _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and analysed in a _PROTEIN_ overlay assay . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to bind detectable amounts of _PROTEIN_ . no binding of _PROTEIN_ was observed for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that the specific mutations introduced into the proteins had indeed reduced their _PROTEIN_ binding activities in this assay . as an initial attempt to identify the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plants the two constructs were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells in both a _METHOD_ tagged form and untagged in case the tag inhibited or altered the function of the proteins . the constructs in either their wild type or mutant _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ along with a number of _METHOD_ markers locating to different organelles in the cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bobtip _METHOD_ aleurain _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and sporamin _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed no observable effect in over _PROTEIN_ experiments on the distribution of markers targeted to the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ the prevacuolar compartment the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the effect of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on biosynthetic _LOCATION_ traffic was investigated using a transport assay based on the transport of a secreted _METHOD_ n _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ to the apoplast where it accumulates poorly and exhibits weak _METHOD_ . this assay is similar to a transport assay using secreted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which has previously been used to characterize mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when an untagged form of _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with a plasmid that _PROTEIN_ both a secreted _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ hdel from the same t dna _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a significant increase in _METHOD_ of n _METHOD_ was observed . clear apoplastic _METHOD_ was observed at higher magnification . when the marker construct was _PROTEIN_ alone most cells accumulated little or no detectable n _METHOD_ as expected even though _METHOD_ hdel was readily detected . by contrast co _PROTEIN_ of n _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increase in intracellular n _METHOD_ _METHOD_ owing to the accumulation of n _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . a similar result was obtained with the secreted _METHOD_ . no increase in n _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ hdel/n _METHOD_ plasmid .
to isolate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas from a. thaliana total rna was extracted from leaves using the rneasy plant mini kit and was used in a reverse transcription pcr procedure with the primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cgcggatccgagctcctaacgtgaggacattttttag and _PROTEIN_ cgcggatccgagctcctaacgtgatcccttttgtttgct . cdna of _PROTEIN_ was amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ggatccgcgtcgacagccatggctccggtctcggcactc adding the restriction sites bamhi and saci respectively . cdna of _PROTEIN_ was amplified using the primers and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a similar manner as described for _PROTEIN_ . both cdnas were cloned into the binary vector with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . mutations in functionally important regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were created with site directed mutagenesis using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as templates . _PROTEIN_ was designed using the primers caa tccgtcggcaagaattccatcattactcgatcc and _PROTEIN_ gaatcgagtaatgatggaattcttgccgacggattg and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was designed with the following primers _PROTEIN_ caatctgtcggaaagaattccatcatcactcgtttc and _PROTEIN_ gaaacgagtgatgatggaattctttccgacagattg and . _PROTEIN_ was designed using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ actcctgaatcgctctaggcctgctgtatcccacaa and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was designed with the following primers ctatgggatactgcaggcctagaaagattcaggagt and actcctgaatctttctaggcctgcagt _PROTEIN_ and . _PROTEIN_ was designed with the primers _PROTEIN_ actgatctagtg and _PROTEIN_ cactagatcagttttgattcccactagtacgactatgac and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ was designed with the following primers _PROTEIN_ and caacaagatcagttttgattccaactagtacgatgataac and . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as templates . the primers _PROTEIN_ cgg _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cgcggatcc ctc gagacaagagcatcctcctgattgctgctgagc were used including the restriction sites bamhi and xhoi respectively . the amplified products were subcloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector containing a c terminal his tag sequence . the constructs were transformed into e. coli strain . two hours after induction with iptg proteins were extracted from the soluble and insoluble fractions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found both in the soluble fraction and also deposited into inclusion bodies in an approximate ratio . in contrast to the expected _PROTEIN_ binding of recombinant proteins the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were only found in the insoluble fraction . since the inclusion body fractions were only partially enriched in the _PROTEIN_ protein the recombinant proteins were purified before further analysis . the inclusion body fractions were solubilized in m guanidinium hydrochloride and loaded onto ni _PROTEIN_ agarose spin columns . equal amounts of purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were loaded onto a _PROTEIN_ gel . bsa was added as a control for the unspecific binding of _PROTEIN_ . the purified recombinant proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ before incubation with radiolabelled _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ binding assay was performed according to the procedure of celis et al . . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has previously been described in citation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a construct where _METHOD_ is fused to the transmembrane and the _LOCATION_ sequence of pea _PROTEIN_ . the construct is identical to _PROTEIN_ described in citation except that all the _LOCATION_ amino acids are present . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has been shown to target the prevacuolar compartment when transiently transformed into tobacco leaf epidermal cells . fm was added to arabidopsis roots at for min prior to observation with bfa treatment at for min .
