to characterize the mechanism through which myosin xi k attaches to its principal endomembrane cargo a yeast two hybrid library of arabidopsis thaliana cdnas was screened using the myosin cargo binding domain as bait . this screen identified two previously uncharacterized transmembrane proteins that share a myosin binding conserved domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . additional screens revealed that also bind myosin xi whereas myosin xi i interacts with the distantly related . the in vivo interactions of with myosin xi k were confirmed by immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses . in epidermal cells the yellow _METHOD_ protein tagged localize to vesicles that traffic in a myosin xi dependent manner . similar to myosin xi k accumulate in the tip growing domain of elongating root hairs . gene knockout analysis demonstrated that functional cooperation between myosin xi k and myob proteins is required for proper plant development . unexpectedly the containing vesicles did not correspond to brefeldin a sensitive _LOCATION_ and post _LOCATION_ or prevacuolar compartments and did not colocalize with known exocytic or endosomal compartments . phylogenomic analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ emerged in primitive land plants and founded a multigene family that is conserved in all flowering plants . collectively these findings indicate that myob are _LOCATION_ anchored myosin receptors that define a distinct plant specific transport vesicle compartment .
to characterize the mechanism of myosin xi k attachment to its principal cargo we performed a yeast two hybrid screen using the universal arabidopsis normalized library and myosin xi k _PROTEIN_ as the bait . diploids were selected on amino triazole containing medium lacking leu trp and his . the resulting colonies were streaked on minus leu/trp/his/ade plates with x gal to select for the metabolic gene activity and activation of the galactosidase reporter . growth competent blue clones were analyzed by pcr and sequencing . a total of clones were identified by screening under these relatively stringent conditions . intriguingly clones contained various cdna fragments of the same gene _PROTEIN_ encoding a previously uncharacterized kd protein . preliminary bioinformatic analysis identified an n terminal transmembrane domain and a highly conserved coiled coil domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . as is common for cdna library screens all positive clones lacked the part of the open reading frame encoding tm thus allowing for _LOCATION_ import that is required for the screen . among the remaining clones eight corresponded to two genes that were paralogs of _PROTEIN_ and encoded related tm and _PROTEIN_ containing proteins of and kd respectively . given the high representation of the three paralogous genes in the screen and the presence of a predicted _LOCATION_ anchoring domain and the _PROTEIN_ domain that is highly conserved in plants and is predicted to adopt a coiled coil structure we considered these genes to be strong candidates for encoding the myosin xi k receptor . accordingly the and kd proteins mentioned above were dubbed myosin binding proteins or myob respectively . to validate the physical interaction between full size myob and myosin xi k we used the pull down assays with escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ myosin xi k _PROTEIN_ fused to maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ and or that were fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ transiently in nicotiana benthamiana . the mbp or _METHOD_ fused bacterial _PROTEIN_ variants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were used as controls for binding specificity . as shown in figure both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ bound mbp _PROTEIN_ but not mbp gus whereas as expected _METHOD_ gus bound only mbp gus due to the known ability of gus to dimerize . to determine whether interacts with full size myosin xi k in vivo we coexpressed arabidopsis _METHOD_ and myosin xi k in n. benthamiana and performed coimmunoprecipitation assays using _METHOD_ specific antibody immobilized on agarose beads . as shown in figure myosin xi k specifically coimmunoprecipitated with but not with free _METHOD_ . our analysis of the interaction positive clones isolated in the screen revealed terminal fragments of of various sizes all of which encoded the _PROTEIN_ domain suggesting that this domain is responsible for binding the myosin xi k _PROTEIN_ . to test this prediction we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ domain of fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and used an n terminal fragment of of a similar molecular _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as specificity control . as shown in figure these pull down assays with mbp _PROTEIN_ confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was sufficient for myosin binding . to investigate the ability of myob to interact with other arabidopsis myosins xi we performed a screen using the arabidopsis cdna library and the _PROTEIN_ of myosin xi a closely related myosin xi k paralog as bait . this screen yielded interaction positive clones of which harbored various fragments of and cdnas suggesting that interaction with myob is a common property of plant myosins xi . this inference was strongly supported by an additional screen in which the bait was a _PROTEIN_ of myosin xi i that is divergent from both myosin xi k and xi . strikingly this screen also yielded a _PROTEIN_ containing protein that is encoded by and is distantly related to this protein was designated . the pairwise assays using xi i _PROTEIN_ detected interactions with but not . taken together the results of these experiments show that distinct myob proteins are capable of interacting with the specific subsets of myosins xi in vitro and in vivo via direct binding between _PROTEIN_ and the myosin _PROTEIN_ . because myob proteins also contain a predicted tm region they are strong candidates for the core vesicular myosin xi receptors . to characterize the pattern of subcellular localization of and we tagged each of these proteins by fusing _METHOD_ to their c termini . the modified genomic clones of _PROTEIN_ and including their native promoters were transformed into the arabidopsis and gene knockout backgrounds respectively in order to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ to levels similar to those of wild type and . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ using plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ revealed motile beads on a string structures in elongated leaf epidermal cells that closely resembled those described for myosin xi k _METHOD_ . this pattern was observed in over of the imaged cells . because the tm of is located at the c terminus of the protein the genomic clone of was modified to accommodate a _METHOD_ tag downstream of the translation initiation codon . the resulting _METHOD_ clone was transformed into arabidopsis and _METHOD_ localization in the leaf epidermal cells was examined by _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure and supplemental movie online this reporter tagged motile bodies whose appearance was similar to those tagged by _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . interestingly these bodies were much more sparse compared with the denser flow of the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ tagged bodies . this outcome suggested that the cargoes driven by interactions between myosins xi k/xi and and on one hand and those driven by the interaction between myosin xi i and on the other hand might perform distinct functions . further analysis of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ distribution revealed essentially identical localization patterns in root epidermal cells . notably both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ concentrated in the tip growing domains of rapidly elongating but not mature root hairs again a pattern similar to that of myosin xi k _METHOD_ and other proteins involved in _PROTEIN_ cell growth . the close resemblance of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localization patterns to those of myosin xi k _METHOD_ in distinct cell types implies that each of these candidate myosin receptors is associated with the cargoes whose trafficking is driven by this myosin . to further validate the endomembrane nature of the round structures labeled with _METHOD_ we performed subcellular fractionation and found that > of _METHOD_ was present in the microsomal pellet . treatment of this pellet with triton x resulted in solubilization of _METHOD_ as is expected for a _LOCATION_ associated protein and in complete accordance with the results obtained for myosin xi k . to determine whether the targeting of myob to _LOCATION_ depended on the predicted transmembrane region of this protein we transgenically _PROTEIN_ the n terminal portion of in arabidopsis columbia plants as a _METHOD_ fusion . the observed subcellular distribution pattern was similar to that of full size _METHOD_ which led us to conclude that the tm region was sufficient for the _LOCATION_ targeting of . to determine whether the trafficking of _METHOD_ tagged cargo was myosin dependent the _METHOD_ gene was transformed into plants with three distinct genetic backgrounds columbia xi k and xi k xi xi . as shown previously the mean velocities of organelle trafficking in the xi k gene knockout are reduced whereas in the triple myosin gene knockout the entire intracellular endomembrane transport is nearly halted . as seen in figure inactivation of myosin xi k resulted in a partial redistribution of _METHOD_ that was no longer limited to linear tracks as well as in a slower motion of the marker tagged material . an even more dramatic picture was observed in a triple gene knockout where _METHOD_ was distributed more diffusively and was essentially immotile . we assume that in the latter case _METHOD_ remained associated with the _LOCATION_ although this assumption was not validated experimentally . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching was used to further characterize and quantify the effects observed in the triple myosin knockout plants . the frap measurements showed nearly complete recovery of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in s after photobleaching in the columbia plants . the velocity with which the front of the _METHOD_ material was moving into the photobleached area was a value very close to the velocity that has been reported for plant myosin xi in vitro . strikingly no statistically significant recovery of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in xi plants over the observation period indicating that inactivation of the three highly _PROTEIN_ myosins xi arrested the trafficking of _METHOD_ tagged cargo . collectively these results demonstrated that and are associated with endomembranes that presumably form vesicles and are rapidly transported in a myosin xi dependent manner . for the sake of brevity hereinafter we will refer to the associated membranous cargoes of myosin xi k as vesicles although their size and morphology are yet to be determined by ultrastructural analysis . to validate the association of and myosin xi k in arabidopsis cells we used dual fluorophore real time imaging and subcellular gradient fractionation . _METHOD_ and myosin xi k mcherry were coexpressed in the xi k xi xi triple knockout background _METHOD_ rather than _METHOD_ was used in these experiments to ensure confident separation of the spectra of the two fluorophores . as shown previously fluorophore tagged myosin xi k is fully functional and rescues the defective growth phenotype in the triple knockout plants . strikingly we found that the beads on a string labeled by either _METHOD_ or myosin xi k mcherry colocalized in of the imaged cells . isopycnic suc gradient fractionation of arabidopsis leaf extracts described previously revealed comigration of myosin xi k with some endomembrane markers including an _LOCATION_ marker . we performed a similar fractionation analysis with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and analyzed individual fractions by immunoblotting using _METHOD_ myosin xi k _LOCATION_ and prevacuolar compartment specific antibodies . the observed coincidence of the _METHOD_ and myosin xi k peaks was fully compatible with a physical interaction between these two proteins . as expected these peaks closely corresponded to the _LOCATION_ peak but were well separated from pvc . we concluded that both the colocalization and gradient fractionation experiments corroborated an in vivo association of and myosin xi k. taken together with the myosin dependent trafficking of the containing vesicles these data strongly support a role of myob as functional _LOCATION_ anchored receptors for the myosins xi in arabidopsis . we found previously that the myosin xi k decorated vesicles are transported along f actin filaments and exhibit only limited overlap with _LOCATION_ stacks or post _LOCATION_ vesicle clusters containing _PROTEIN_ carrier _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . to gain further insight into the nature of these transport vesicles defined by the myob myosin interactions we employed a pharmacological approach complemented by colocalization analyses using several endomembrane compartment specific markers . brefeldin a is a potent inhibitor of secretory transport affecting the formation of _PROTEIN_ vesicles that is critical for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface dynamics and causes fusion of _LOCATION_ stacks with the _LOCATION_ network . accordingly in control experiments with bfa we observed absorption of _LOCATION_ by the _LOCATION_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ marker alone or in combination with a spectrally distinct _LOCATION_ marker . furthermore bfa treatment caused redistribution of the trans _LOCATION_ network compartment marked by the small rab _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . instead of the relatively small vesicular bodies that were observed in untreated cells in the bfa treated cells this marker localized primarily to large cistern like bodies . surprisingly bfa treatment had no observable effect on the vesicles tagged by _METHOD_ . this result indicated that the containing vesicles do not belong to the bfa sensitive secretory compartment . to further decipher the relationships between exocytic and decorated vesicles we coexpressed _METHOD_ with the exocytic vesicle marker mcherry _PROTEIN_ one of the plant v snares . as shown in figure the two markers did not colocalize even those few mcherry _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles that were present along the string of _METHOD_ labeled vesicles did not coincide with the latter but rather were located between them . thus the containing vesicles do not appear to belong to a major secretory trafficking pathway . to investigate the potential relationship between and myosin xi k decorated vesicles and endocytic pathways we analyzed the relative localization of _METHOD_ and the endocytic compartments defined by clathrin and flotillin . little spatial overlap was observed between the marker of clathrin coated vesicles mcherry tagged clathrin light chain _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . only a few _PROTEIN_ mcherry labeled bodies localized within the strings of the _METHOD_ bodies but even these did not correspond in size and shape to the adjacent _METHOD_ bodies . an even lesser degree of colocalization was found between _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ a marker of the clathrin independent exocytic pathway . thus there was no significant overlap between the _METHOD_ decorated motile vesicles and at least two distinct endocytic compartments . in conclusion the presented data indicate that the motile vesicles decorated by myosin xi k and its putative transmembrane receptor do not correspond to several major exocytic and endocytic compartments and most likely represent a distinct class of transport vesicles that was not described previously . previously a _PROTEIN_ containing protein was identified as the product of the gene involved in zein protein body formation in maize endosperm and a large family of homologous _PROTEIN_ containing proteins was identified in rice and arabidopsis . given the recent vast expansion in the number of sequenced plant genomes we sought to gain a broader insight into the origin and evolution of this group of proteins . a psi blast search in the refseq database identified _PROTEIN_ containing proteins in all sequenced genomes of land plants including the nonvascular moss physcomitrella patens the vascular _PROTEIN_ selaginella moellendorffii and flowering plants both monocots and dicots . all of these plants encompass multiple paralogous _PROTEIN_ encoding genes . specifically in arabidopsis genes encode a complete _PROTEIN_ domain and one gene encodes an apparently incomplete one . we constructed a multiple alignment of all identified _PROTEIN_ domains and used it to generate a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree . the resulting tree topology implies that after the divergence from the common ancestor with the mosses at least three families of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins each represented in most monocots and dicots evolved in the stem phase of the evolution of the flowering plants . the monophyly of each of these three families is supported either by a very high bootstrap value or by a moderate bootstrap value and was also reproduced using the fasttree method of phylogenetic tree construction . moreover each family further split into at least two subfamilies that are present in the major groups of both dicots and monocots and probably are ancestral as well . we further analyzed the sequences of the _PROTEIN_ containing proteins to identify additional domains transmembrane helices and coiled coil regions . these proteins show notable variability of domain architectures but also share common structural features at least at the level of the six subfamilies . the _PROTEIN_ itself is confidently predicted to adopt a coiled coil structure thus representing a rare case of a coiled coil domain that _PROTEIN_ a strong identity over hundreds of millions years of evolution rather than showing generic similarity to numerous other structures of this type . in addition many proteins in the _PROTEIN_ superfamily contain other strongly predicted coiled coil regions typically near the c terminus . the majority of the proteins in this superfamily also contain a single strongly predicted transmembrane helix that in most cases is located near the n terminus but in a minority of the proteins resides near the c terminus . the confident prediction of transmembrane helices but not signal peptides in the majority of the _PROTEIN_ superfamily proteins is compatible with their localization in intracellular _LOCATION_ distinct from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . finally the majority of the _PROTEIN_ containing proteins possess distinct regions with specific patterns of cys residues that are conserved within the families or subfamilies . three such patterns were detected mbr i motif c x c x c x h x c x c x c x c mbr ii motif cc x c x c x c and mbr iii motif c x c p c x c. these patterns of conserved cys residues resemble those in known metal binding domains such as zinc fingers and could be implicated in the chelation of transitional cations such as . however the mbr regions in the _PROTEIN_ proteins are predicted to adopt helical structures and so are unrelated to zn fingers that form hairpins . if the prediction of metal binding is experimentally validated the mbrs will comprise a distinct class of metal binding protein modules . thus and belong to the families i ii and iii respectively of the large superfamily of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins that apparently emerged in land plants . given the high level of _PROTEIN_ sequence conservation it _METHOD_ likely that the myosin binding described here is a common property of this domain whereas the ability of to bind maize specific zeins is a specific feature of this _LOCATION_ associated protein . this hypothesis is in agreement with the recently described roles of the encoded myosin xi in _LOCATION_ motility and maize protein body formation which suggest cooperation between and myosin in this process . furthermore the interaction between myosin xi i and a family ii member described here provides further evidence in support of the functional partnership between myosins xi and the entire superfamily of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins . bioinformatics analysis of the _PROTEIN_ superfamily suggested both functional specialization and a degree of functional redundancy among the superfamily members . to determine the functions of myob proteins in plant development we focused on the family i members of which at least interact with the principal arabidopsis myosin xi k. this analysis also included a closely related paralog of designated . analogously to myosins xi the analysis of the growth phenotypes of the four single gene knockout lines and as well as of the double gene knockout revealed no statistically significant differences with the columbia control . however the triple knockout and the quadruple knockout plants exhibited a statistically significant height reduction compared with the columbia control . interestingly the but not mutant showed a modest reduction in rosette diameter . because a physical interaction between and myosin xi k implies that they function in the same transport pathway and might interact genetically we characterized synthetic knockout mutants in which both myosin xi k and subsets of myob proteins were inactivated . strikingly the xi k xi k and xi k mutants showed highly significant progressive defects in stem growth their height was reduced by and respectively relative to the corresponding controls . however no statistically significant differences in leaf rosette diameter were found in each of the three synthetic knockout mutants indicating that cooperation between myosin xi k and is more important for the growth of _METHOD_ than it is for the growth of leaves . further analysis of the mutant plants revealed significant delays in the onset of flowering . as shown in figure and plants as well as the xi k plant line each exhibited an d flowering delay compared with the columbia control . examination of the synthetic mutants revealed additional flowering delays of and d for the xi k and xi k lines compared with their respective and controls and a dramatic week delay relative to columbia plants . therefore simultaneous inactivation of myosin xi k and three or four of its myob interaction partners resulted in progressive defects in plant growth and flowering onset implying shared functions of these proteins in plant development . it should be stressed that the phenotypes of the multiple knockout mutants and synthetic multiple myosin xi k knockout mutants partially phenocopy those of the triple and quadruple myosin xi mutants further supporting the functional interdependence of myosins xi and their myob receptors .
