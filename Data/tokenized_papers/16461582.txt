in eukaryotic cells compartments of the highly dynamic endomembrane system are acidified to varying degrees by the activity of _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the arabidopsis thaliana genome most v _PROTEIN_ subunits are encoded by small gene families thus offering potential for a multitude of enzyme complexes with different kinetic properties and localizations . we have determined the subcellular localization of the three arabidopsis _METHOD_ of the _LOCATION_ integral v _PROTEIN_ subunit vha a. colocalization experiments as well as immunogold labeling showed that vha is preferentially found in the trans _LOCATION_ network the _PROTEIN_ sorting compartment of the secretory pathway . uptake experiments with the endocytic tracer revealed rapid colocalization with vha indicating that the tgn may act as an early endosomal compartment . concanamycin a a specific v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor blocks the endocytic transport of to the tonoplast causes the accumulation of together with newly synthesized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and interferes with the formation of brefeldin a compartments . furthermore nascent cell plates are rapidly stained by indicating that endocytosed material is redirected into the secretory flow after reaching the tgn . together our results suggest the convergence of the early endocytic and secretory trafficking pathways in the tgn .
to determine the subcellular localization of the three arabidopsis vha a _METHOD_ vha vha and vha we constructed translational fusions between their genomic sequences and the reporter gene green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the genomic dna fragments included promoter regions of kb kb and kb and _METHOD_ was fused to the last exon . based on the prediction of six transmembrane spanning domains for all arabidopsis vha a _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ location of _METHOD_ is assumed . homozygous lines with a single t dna insertion site were established and rt pcr was used to identify lines in which the _PROTEIN_ level of the transgene was comparable to that of the endogenous gene . furthermore we performed coimmunoprecipitations of vha _METHOD_ and vha a to demonstrate that at least a substantial fraction of v _PROTEIN_ complexes contain vha _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ that vha _METHOD_ is integrated into the v _PROTEIN_ holocomplex suggests that it is functional because the integration of a nonfunctional subunit into the complex likely would have had dominant negative effects . however all lines _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ were indistinguishable from the wild type . in seedlings _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was detectable in all cells and their localization in cells of the root elongation zone was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . a mobile punctate staining pattern was observed in seedlings of all lines _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ whereas seedlings _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ or vha _METHOD_ displayed _METHOD_ preferentially at the tonoplast . to exclude the possibility that the observed localization of vha was an artifact caused by the fusion of _METHOD_ to its c terminus we constructed a chimeric protein consisting of the n terminal part of vha and the c terminus of vha fused to _METHOD_ . in transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ a similar pattern as for vha _METHOD_ was observed therefore we assume that the c terminal _METHOD_ fusion does not cause the mislocalization of vha . this result further indicates that the first amino acids of the _LOCATION_ n terminal domain contain the targeting information necessary for the specific localization of vha . the fungal toxin brefeldin a inhibits certain adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ and is widely used as a vesicle trafficking inhibitor . after bfa treatment both vha _METHOD_ and vha _METHOD_ signals rapidly aggregated and were found throughout the vesicle agglomerations known as bfa compartments together with the endocytic tracer . early endosomal compartments accumulate in the core of bfa compartments whereas trans _LOCATION_ markers tend to be found more in the periphery of bfa compartments . the presence of vha _METHOD_ in bfa compartments suggests that it is localized either in endosomes or in a trans _LOCATION_ compartment therefore we performed colocalization experiments with appropriate marker proteins fused to monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis the plant unique homolog _PROTEIN_ and the homolog _PROTEIN_ are localized on two distinct but partially overlapping populations of endosomes . in transgenic seedlings coexpressing vha _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ little overlap was detected . quantification of _PROTEIN_ images revealed that < of the pixels with signal intensities above the chosen threshold overlapped between the red and green channels and line scans confirmed that the intensity maxima did not colocalize . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the qa snare group localized at the tgn in a complex with at _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a fusion of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ but not with _LOCATION_ and prevacuolar compartment markers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had not been described previously therefore we confirmed that it showed the same localization as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transiently _PROTEIN_ protoplasts indicating that the presence of _METHOD_ did not affect the targeting of _PROTEIN_ . in transgenic seedlings coexpressing vha _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the punctate staining patterns were almost identical indicating colocalization of the two proteins . quantification of _PROTEIN_ images revealed that > of the pixels with signal intensities above the chosen threshold overlapped between the red and green channels and line scans confirmed that the intensity maxima did colocalize . immunogold electron microscopy was performed to confirm the colocalization results . in ultrathin cryosections of root tissue from vha _METHOD_ seedlings incubated with a _METHOD_ antibody gold particles specifically labeled tubulovesicular _LOCATION_ in the vicinity of the trans site of _LOCATION_ stacks that we interpret to be the tgn . both the density of gold particles and their distance from the _LOCATION_ stack showed some variation however ultrastructural analysis showed that the extension of the tgn and its position relative to the _LOCATION_ stack are similarly variable . labeling of the tgn was observed in seedlings in which transgene _PROTEIN_ matched the level of the endogenous gene and in seedlings that overexpressed vha _METHOD_ . unfortunately colabeling with a _PROTEIN_ antibody was not possible because of a lack of specific _PROTEIN_ signals . labeling of the tgn was also observed in cells _PROTEIN_ the chimeric vha _METHOD_ confirming that the targeting information resides in the n terminal domain of vha . in cells _PROTEIN_ the trans _LOCATION_ marker n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gold particles were located at the trans most _LOCATION_ cisternae and in cells with high _PROTEIN_ levels also often in the tgn . no labeling above background was detected in wild type cells . to provide further evidence that the observed localization of vha _METHOD_ reflects the localization of the endogenous protein we analyzed the distribution of the v _PROTEIN_ in wild type root cells . immunogold labeling using an antibody against vha e resulted in the expected labeling of the tonoplast but labeling in the tgn was also observed . in _PROTEIN_ embryos lacking vha the vha e antibody did not yield staining above background thus confirming the specificity of the observed signals at the tgn and the tonoplast . our results show that in arabidopsis root cells the tgn and the tonoplast are the endomembranes with the highest v _PROTEIN_ density and provide evidence that vha _METHOD_ reflects the preferential localization of the endogenous protein in the tgn . after bfa treatment vha _METHOD_ was found to colocalize with raising the possibility that it resides in an endosomal compartment . although concerns have been raised is now widely accepted as a reliable tracer for endocytic trafficking therefore we used to determine the position of vha _METHOD_ in the endocytic pathway . the uptake of into arabidopsis root tip cells can be blocked either by cold pretreatment or by treatment with wortmannin thus it can be assumed that is internalized exclusively via endocytosis and follows the endocytic pathway from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the tonoplast . colocalization of and _METHOD_ was observed in root cells _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ after uptake for min . in _PROTEIN_ the first detectable intracellular _METHOD_ observed after only min coincided with vha _METHOD_ labeled compartments . in agreement with this observation the first intracellular _METHOD_ was often found adjacent to or overlapping with n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . uptake experiments were also performed with seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no colocalization of with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed after min . after min partial overlap was detected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . together these results indicate that vha _METHOD_ resides in an early endosomal compartment distinct from the endosomes marked by either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the results presented to this point suggest that vha _METHOD_ labels a compartment that may be part of both the endocytic and the secretory pathways . to determine whether v _PROTEIN_ activity is necessary for the biological functions of this compartment we next analyzed the effects of the v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor conca on endocytic trafficking . to determine whether conca blocks the transport of to the tonoplast we first analyzed the time course of trafficking in untreated root tip cells . after h staining distinct from that of the vha _METHOD_ labeled compartment was observed which can be interpreted as a _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartment through which the dye has to pass on its way to the tonoplast . staining of the tonoplast was clearly detectable after h . pretreatment with conca for h and subsequent staining with revealed that the internalization of the dye is at least not strongly affected . however after h neither signals clearly distinct from vha _METHOD_ nor staining of the tonoplast was observed . weak tonoplast staining was seen only after prolonged incubation . comparable results were obtained using arabidopsis suspension cultured cells which were either untreated or pretreated with conca for h stained with at for min and washed before incubation in inhibitor free medium or in conca medium . based on the results that vha _METHOD_ is localized in the first compartment stained after uptake and that conca interferes with transport from this compartment to the _LOCATION_ we conclude that conca inhibits transport from an early to a _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartment . conca not only blocked transport it also affected the appearance of the vha _METHOD_ staining pattern . compared with untreated cells diffuse and enlarged intracellular _METHOD_ signals were observed . ultrastructural images of high pressure frozen and freeze substituted conca treated root cells showed changes in _LOCATION_ morphology and aggregations of swollen vesicles as described previously for tobacco cells and lily pollen tubes . the effects of conca include bending of _LOCATION_ cisternae swelling of their ends fragmentation of _LOCATION_ stacks and the accumulation of large vesicles . immunogold labeling using _METHOD_ antibodies confirmed the presence of vha _METHOD_ in conca induced vesicle aggregates indicating that they are derived from the tgn . having shown that v _PROTEIN_ activity is necessary for endocytic trafficking and that vha _METHOD_ is present in bfa compartments we next asked whether v _PROTEIN_ function is also necessary for the formation of bfa compartments . the ultrastructure of a typical bfa compartment is shown in figure and immunogold labeling using _METHOD_ antibodies confirmed that vha _METHOD_ is evenly distributed in bfa compartments . when seedlings were pretreated with conca for h before bfa treatment the typical large bfa compartments were never observed by _PROTEIN_ . electron microscopy images show a mixture of conca like and small bfa like aggregations . the observed effects of bfa and conca on vha _METHOD_ were reversible by incubation of seedlings without inhibitors for h . together these results show that the tgn is a core component of bfa compartments and that v _PROTEIN_ function is required for their formation . the tgn is the _PROTEIN_ sorting station of the secretory pathway therefore conca should interfere not only with endocytic trafficking but also with secretory trafficking . root cells of seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ steroid receptor _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ show detectable intracellular _METHOD_ . the majority of intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were costained with in < min suggesting that they could be derived from tgn localized molecules . after conca treatment many cells showed increased intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in irregular patches . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ patches were only partly stained by suggesting that conca may cause the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ not only in the tgn but also either in _LOCATION_ stacks if conca causes the accumulation of newly synthesized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins or in a _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartment if conca interferes with the recycling of internalized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . to determine whether the intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was caused by internalized or newly synthesized molecules protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide . in both untreated and conca treated seedlings intracellular _METHOD_ was strongly reduced by chx treatment indicating that a substantial fraction of the intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal is derived from secretory cargo . the intracellular signals remaining after chx treatment did not show rapid colocalization with suggesting that they might be derived from _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartments . after conca treatment these compartments seem to be associated with but still separated from the stained _LOCATION_ . our findings suggest that after conca treatment secretory and endocytic cargos accumulate together in tgn derived structures . because it could be argued that the observed coaccumulation of endocytic and secretory cargos in the tgn is based on an artificial fusion of the tgn and endosomes caused by conca we next addressed the question of whether early convergence of endocytic and secretory trafficking can be demonstrated in undisturbed cells . transport to the plane of division is assumed to be the default pathway for _LOCATION_ derived vesicles in dividing cells . it has been shown previously that enters the secretory pathway and stains cell plates in dividing fucus and cells but to date rapid entry into the secretory pathway has only been described in pollen tubes . based on the results presented here developing cell plates in arabidopsis root tips should be rapidly stained by if the dye is redirected into the secretory vesicle flow after reaching the tgn . indeed in seedlings _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ staining of cell plates was observed within to min after staining of the tgn was detected . three dimensional reconstruction of z scans showed that cell plates stained by were not yet connected with the cortical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these findings strongly suggest that early endocytic and secretory trafficking converge in the tgn of arabidopsis root tip cells .
