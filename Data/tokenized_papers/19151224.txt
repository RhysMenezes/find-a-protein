early endosperm development involves a series of rapid _LOCATION_ divisions in the absence of cytokinesis thus many endosperm mutants reveal genes whose functions are essential for mitosis . this work finds that the endosperm of arabidopsis thaliana endosperm _PROTEIN_ mutants never cellularizes contains a reduced number of enlarged polyploid _LOCATION_ and features an aberrant microtubule _LOCATION_ where the specialized radial microtubule _METHOD_ and cytokinetic phragmoplasts are absent . early embryo development is substantially normal although occasional cytokinesis defects are observed . the _PROTEIN_ gene was cloned using a map based approach and represents the pioneer member of a conserved plant specific family of genes of previously unknown function . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm and embryo of developing seeds and its _PROTEIN_ is tightly regulated during cell cycle progression . _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates in _LOCATION_ caps in premitotic cells colocalizes along microtubules of the spindle and phragmoplast and binds microtubules in vitro . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a novel plant specific microtubule associated protein essential for microtubule function during the mitotic and cytokinetic stages that generate the arabidopsis endosperm and embryo .
a microscopy screen of a collection of wrinkled seed mutants identified the first allele _PROTEIN_ as defective in seed development . the mutation leads to seed abortion in homozygous _PROTEIN_ siliques while mature plants showed no other obvious phenotype and were indistinguishable from the wild type . aborted seeds fall into two categories brown shrunken seeds which indicate _PROTEIN_ abortion and small white desiccated seeds indicating early abortion . no aborted seeds were observed in crosses of _PROTEIN_ wild type and of wild type _PROTEIN_ confirming that _PROTEIN_ is a recessive mutation . analysis of feulgen stained _PROTEIN_ endosperm at d after pollination revealed a dramatically reduced number of enlarged endosperm _LOCATION_ that contained multiple oversized nucleoli compared with the wild type . staining with diamidino phenylindole confirmed that the increased _LOCATION_ volume was accompanied by a rise in dna content . the amount of dna in each _LOCATION_ at dap estimated from the intensity of dapi staining was more than threefold greater in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ compared with the wild type _LOCATION_ . the nucleoli from _PROTEIN_ were also > times larger than those from the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutation leads to a range of seed phenotypes from mild to severe within a single homozygous _PROTEIN_ silique . in the mild phenotypes the endosperm contained approximately one tenth of the number of ncds in the peripheral endosperm compared with the wild type at equivalent stages of development and both micropylar and _PROTEIN_ endosperm had formed . in _PROTEIN_ seeds displaying a moderate effect the ncds of the central peripheral endosperm were very large and multinucleate and the embryo had associated endosperm . in the most extreme examples only one highly stretched ncd containing connected _LOCATION_ was present . despite the variable number of ncds cellularization of _PROTEIN_ endosperm was not observed . to identify the developmental stage at which the endosperm defect first arises in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we examined mutant and wild type seed development with nomarski optics . up to dap _PROTEIN_ seeds were indistinguishable from the wild type . enlarged mutant _LOCATION_ started to be visible from dap onwards . at dap the mutant endosperm displayed on average between and enlarged _LOCATION_ whereas the wild type endosperm contained an excess of normal _LOCATION_ . an extreme example is shown in figure where at dap only one _LOCATION_ is visible in the mutant endosperm . _PROTEIN_ embryos develop normally up to dap and at a rate similar to that of the wild type and show no obvious morphological defects . beyond the heart stage of embryo development seed shrinkage and collapse were observed in the _PROTEIN_ aborted _PROTEIN_ seeds . the _LOCATION_ division defect in _PROTEIN_ endosperm suggested a possible defect in cytoskeletal organization . to evaluate this developing mutant and wild type seeds were analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . immunolabeling with antitubulin and counterstaining with dapi demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ endosperm lacks the organized microtubule arrays typical of wild type endosperm . in wild type endosperm the _LOCATION_ of the syncitium are evenly spaced by _METHOD_ that radiate from each _LOCATION_ and define the ncds . by contrast in early _PROTEIN_ endosperm only a few enlarged and unevenly spaced _LOCATION_ lacking associated microtubule structures are present . _PROTEIN_ in development giant _PROTEIN_ endosperm _LOCATION_ displayed several enlarged nucleoli lacked associated _METHOD_ and failed to cellularize . despite a careful analysis of the mutant and wild type _PROTEIN_ we never observed chromatin condensation mitotic spindles and cytokinetic phragmoplasts in the mutant . by contrast mitotic figures such as spindles and phragmoplasts were observed at a frequency of in in wild type endosperm indicating at least a fold _PROTEIN_ in the mitotic index of the _PROTEIN_ mutant endosperm . the _PROTEIN_ gene was identified by positional cloning using a population created from a cross between the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant and landsberg _LOCATION_ . the mapping revealed that the mutation lies on bac and sequencing of the nonrecombinant region revealed a g to a single base transition at the boundary in gene _GENE_ . the gene is bp long from the start _PROTEIN_ to the stop codon and consists of six exons defining a amino acid protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd and a calculated pi of . rt pcr using rna purified from young siliques of homozygous _PROTEIN_ and the wild type showed that mrna from the gene is present in the mutant but is smaller than the wild type . cloning and sequencing of the rt pcr products showed that the mutant uses a cryptic splice site that is bases after the of the boundary . this results in a small deletion during processing of the mrna that leaves the reading frame intact but is predicted to code for a protein that is amino acid residues shorter than the wild type and missing the residues between arg and gln . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was complemented using a binary construct containing the full length genomic sequence of the wild type gene _GENE_ . endosperm from mature seeds of independent _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants that were homozygous for the transgene had a wild type appearance confirming that _GENE_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ protein . a search of the salk t dna insertion mutant collection identified two further _PROTEIN_ alleles that have insertions in the first exon and second intron respectively and were called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene by t dna insertion appears to be lethal we were unable to identify any plants that were homozygous for the insertion from progeny derived from selfing hemizygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . hemizygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have siliques containing and abnormal seeds respectively . of these abnormal seeds aborted early and to aborted _PROTEIN_ at the heart torpedo embryo stage . the _PROTEIN_ aborting seeds failed to germinate and displayed defects similar to those described for _PROTEIN_ . similar to what was observed in _PROTEIN_ seeds embryo development in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proceeds up to at least the heart stage . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles display defects associated with aberrant mitosis or cytokinesis we examined histochemically stained sections of mutant embryos from globular to heart stage by light microscopy . enlarged _LOCATION_ containing multiple nucleoli and occasional cell wall stubs were observed in mutant embryos in association with the previously described endosperm defects . to determine whether the maternal or paternal sporophytes are implicated in the _PROTEIN_ mutation we conducted reciprocal crosses between heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . in a cross between a heterozygous female _PROTEIN_ and a wild type male _PROTEIN_ of the seed aborted at a heart torpedo stage while in a cross between a wild type female _PROTEIN_ and a heterozygous male _PROTEIN_ only seed abortion was observed similar to wild type values . in neither case were early aborted seeds observed . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays incomplete maternal effect seed lethality . alternatively but not exclusively the paternal allele could suppress of the lethality expected in case of maternal effect only . seed phenotype of reciprocal crosses between heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and col wild type plants finally plants with the genotype _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ have a similar seed phenotype to homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that the different mutants belong to the same complementation group and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are recessive to _PROTEIN_ . live and total aborted seeds from crosses between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant genotypes . sequence analysis identified the _PROTEIN_ protein as a member of a family of related plant specific proteins all containing the interpro domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . a blast search revealed six similar proteins in arabidopsis one of which shares amino acid sequence identity . seven similar proteins were identified in oryza sativa and four in the moss . sequence alignments of all _PROTEIN_ like proteins revealed that the highest similarity is located at the c terminal half of the protein suggesting that important and conserved functional domains exist in this region . phylogenetic analysis of the c terminal sequences of all members of the _PROTEIN_ family identified four types one of which is confined to moss . _PROTEIN_ together with _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and a rice protein fall into the same type suggesting that could be the ortholog of _PROTEIN_ . searches of the chlamydomonas genomic sequence revealed no significant similarities and no similar sequences were identified in any bacterial fungal or animal genomes indicating that the _PROTEIN_ family is specific to land plants . the developmentally restricted phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles suggested that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene might be specific to young proliferating tissues and to the reproductive phase . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene was determined using rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ was found to be strongest in young siliques d old seedlings flower buds and open flowers . the _PROTEIN_ was weaker in roots and below the detection level in older siliques and in mature leaves . this pattern of gene _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by analyzing the large number of _PROTEIN_ microarray experiments currently available which also shows that the strongest _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ occurs in the inflorescence although _PROTEIN_ could also be detected in the shoot apices cotyledons and radicles of embryos at globular and heart stages of development . otherwise the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ at very low levels in mature tissues . the pattern of gene _PROTEIN_ during development was confirmed in transgenic plants containing _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ constructs . analysis of independent lines showed that _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter was detected in the embryo sac in prefertilization ovules and in seeds following fertilization . gus _PROTEIN_ occurred in both embryo and endosperm throughout most of the syncytial phase of endosperm development but became undetectable in the cellularized endosperm when cell division had ceased . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the embryo up to heart stage . because gus is a stable protein it can not provide accurate information on highly dynamic changes in gene _PROTEIN_ . we therefore confirmed and extended these observations by mrna in situ hybridization analysis . hybridization of an antisense _PROTEIN_ probe to sections of floral _METHOD_ indicated that the level of _PROTEIN_ was strongest in unfertilized ovules and weaker in embryo and endosperm _LOCATION_ in developing seeds . when cyclin b was used as a control probe in similar sections the signal in endosperm _LOCATION_ was comparable to that obtained with _PROTEIN_ as a probe . by contrast the signal in the embryo was much stronger with cyclin b than with _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ signal was not restricted to embryonic tissues per se but could be detected in other actively proliferating tissues such as young unfertilized ovules . this produced a spotty pattern in which some cells displayed high levels of signal and neighboring cells did not a pattern consistent with the accumulation of mrna in a cell cycle dependent manner . when sections of unfertilized ovules were counterstained with the dna specific dye dapi to reveal the stage of the cell cycle the cells containing the strongest _PROTEIN_ signal were all in interphase . prophase cells contained only a weak signal and metaphase cells had no detectable signal . these results are consistent with a _PROTEIN_ phase specific _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . to gain further insight into the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we interrogated the arabidopsis coresponse database to find those genes that show similar patterns of _PROTEIN_ . this resource compiles microarray _PROTEIN_ data from numerous experiments and can provide clues to gene function by association with genes of known function . eighteen from the top genes whose _PROTEIN_ most closely corresponded with _PROTEIN_ over a range of experimental conditions are either known or predicted to be involved in mitosis and cytokinesis . these include _PROTEIN_ and several cyclins with predicted mitotic function . notably two microtubule associated proteins a homolog of end binding protein and a mitotic kinesin _PROTEIN_ are also among the top along with the chromosomal protein . many of these coexpressed genes contain one or more m specific activator _METHOD_ elements that are believed to enhance gene _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ and m phase . sequence analysis identified two _METHOD_ elements in the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence and putative anaphase promoting complex target motifs within the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . moreover a study to identify genes that are coregulated during the cell cycle in arabidopsis cell suspension cultures revealed that _PROTEIN_ is one of genes that peak in their _PROTEIN_ during the _PROTEIN_ phase of the cell cycle . our _PROTEIN_ studies together with the tight coresponse of _PROTEIN_ with many genes that show transcriptional upregulation during _PROTEIN_ strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highly regulated during the cell cycle . to gain insight into the cellular role of _PROTEIN_ we fused the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence with a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter gene . the functionality of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was demonstrated by _PROTEIN_ it under the _PROTEIN_ promoter in homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants where full complementation was observed in eight out of eight independent transgenic lines . although the _METHOD_ fusion confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm of developing ovules the complexity of the tissue interfered with high quality imaging . therefore we studied the dynamic localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cell suspensions . in arabidopsis cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal was associated with spindles and phragmoplasts . to test if the association depended on microtubules we treated arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with taxol or oryzalin drugs that are specific for the stabilization or destabilization of microtubules respectively . oryzalin treatment caused a loss of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ whereas the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in taxol treated cells remained fibrillar . to examine the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ redistribution during the cell cycle we stably transformed tobacco by cells with the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in proliferating transgenic tobacco by lines was virtually undetectable during interphase but at the onset of mitosis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ began to accumulate into opposing _PROTEIN_ caps in the perinuclear region from which the microtubule arrays radiate toward the cell cortex . as cells progressed into mitosis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ decorated microtubules of the spindle and spindle poles at metaphase and anaphase . in anaphase a clear gap developed in the central zone of the spindle and _METHOD_ was largely restricted to the region between the chromatids and each pole suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ decorates pole to chromatid kinetochore microtubules at this stage . at the anaphase/telophase transition and during telophase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ strongly associated with midzone microtubules out of which the phragmoplast emerges and remained associated with the phragmoplast throughout cell plate formation . at the end of cell division _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was no longer detectable . notably _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected on cortical microtubules either in the interphase array or the preprophase band . the above observations indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein associates with microtubules during cell division . to further verify this association we performed costaining experiments using antitubulin antibodies to visualize the microtubules in by tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . tubulin colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a fibrous pattern on mitotic structures . colocalization could not be observed in interphase cells because _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ at detectable levels during interphase . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with tubulin could result either from direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to microtubules or from indirect binding via other microtubule associated proteins . we tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind directly to microtubules by an in vitro cosedimentation experiment . in vitro translated methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ was incubated with or without taxol polymerized mammalian brain microtubules . microtubules were pelleted through a sucrose cushion and both supernatants and pellets were analyzed by autoradiography . _PROTEIN_ was significantly enriched in the tubulin pellet compared with a nonmicrotubule binding control indicating that in vitro _PROTEIN_ binds directly to microtubules .

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . the results showed unambiguously that _PROTEIN_ was linked with on the lower arm of chromosome ii since none of the plants showing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype were ler for . fine mapping using the caps markers ml athuique and and the simple sequence length polymorphic marker nga showed that the locus lay between and ml . single nucleotide polymorphism and indel markers were
