ubiquinone is the generic name of a class of lipid soluble electron carriers formed of a redox active benzoquinone _PROTEIN_ attached to a prenyl side chain . the length of the latter varies among species and depends upon the product specificity of a trans long chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that elongates an allylic diphosphate precursor . in arabidopsis this enzyme is assumed to correspond to an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located solanesyl diphosphate synthase although direct genetic evidence was lacking . in this study the reconstruction of the functional network of arabidopsis genes linked to ubiquinone biosynthesis singled out an unsuspected solanesyl diphosphate synthase candidate product of gene _GENE_ that extraordinarily had been shown previously to be targeted to _LOCATION_ and to contribute to the biosynthesis of gibberellins . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion experiments in tobacco and arabidopsis and complementation of a yeast knockout lacking mitochondrial hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase demonstrated that _GENE_ is also targeted to mitochondria . _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ if not sole contributor to solanesyl diphosphate synthase activity required for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone as demonstrated by the dramatic reduction of the ubiquinone pool size in corresponding rnai lines . overexpression of _GENE_ gave up to a increase in ubiquinone content compared to wild type plants . none of the silenced or overexpressing lines in contrast displayed altered levels of plastoquinone . phylogenetic analyses revealed that _GENE_ is the only arabidopsis trans long chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that clusters with the orthologs involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone in other eukaryotes .
using the microarray co response module of the golm comprehensive _METHOD_ biology database to explo re the functional network of the arabidopsis coq/ubi orthologs four terpene biosynthetic genes were identified . three of them _GENE_ _GENE_ and encode for enzymes involved in the formation of mevalonic acid namely hydroxy methylglutaryl co enzyme a synthase and hydroxy methylglutaryl coa reductase and respectively _PROTEIN_ . the fourth gene _GENE_ encodes for a member of the trans prenyl diphosphate synthase family . a recombinant version of the corresponding enzyme was recently shown to generate medium and long chain allylic diphosphate as reaction products in vitro . transcript profiles deduced from microarray data _METHOD_ indicated that _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitous in the tissues investigated and peaks in seeds and shoot apical _METHOD_ . mining the microarray elements of the _PROTEIN_ ii database with the _GENE_ gene as query detected an overwhelming proportion of mitochondrial proteins in the most significant co _PROTEIN_ including the and orthologs and components of the respiratory chain _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ copper chaperone _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ cytochrome c . the remainder of these top co _PROTEIN_ is split between genes encoding proteins targeted to the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . that _GENE_ s functional network is predominated by genes linked to mitochondrial metabolism is a priori surprising for the _GENE_ protein had been previously detected in _LOCATION_ and proposed to participate in the biosynthesis of gibberellic acid . to clarify the apparent discrepancy between the pre existing evidence for the compartmentalization of _GENE_ into _LOCATION_ and co _PROTEIN_ data we re investigated the subcellular targeting of this protein using _METHOD_ reporters and confocal laser scanning microscopy . for that an approximately kb genomic fragment comprised of _GENE_ sequence its utr and its native promoter were cloned in frame to the end of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of the _GENE_ _METHOD_ fused construct in tobacco leaf tissues resulted in a punctate pattern of green _METHOD_ some of which clearly co localized with the _METHOD_ of chlorophyll into _LOCATION_ . however the _METHOD_ associated _METHOD_ was also observed in much smaller structures quickly streaming along strands of _LOCATION_ and which were reminiscent of mitochondria . to investigate this point _METHOD_ tagged _GENE_ was co infiltrated with a mitochondrial marker consisting of the n terminal region of isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase fused to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . co _PROTEIN_ of these constructs showed that the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ co localized with the red pseudocolor of _METHOD_ in mitochondria . to confirm these findings the _GENE_ _METHOD_ construct was introduced into arabidopsis for stable _PROTEIN_ . imaging of the leaves of transgenics demonstrated that here again the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was associated with small and highly mobile punctate structures distinctive of mitochondria . as observed in tobacco the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was also found in much larger structures that co localized with the _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . these data demonstrate that when either transiently or stably _PROTEIN_ under the control of its native promoter the _GENE_ protein is dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . having shown that _GENE_ co _PROTEIN_ with known and predicted ubiquinone biosynthetic genes and that its cognate protein occurs in the _LOCATION_ as well as in _LOCATION_ we inferred that _GENE_ was a good candidate gene for the trans long chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that makes the side chain of ubiquinone in arabidopsis . to investigate this point _GENE_ full length cdna was subcloned into yeast _PROTEIN_ vector pyes and the resulting construct was introduced into a s. cerevisiae knockout . this strain which lacks mitochondrial hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase activity is devoid of ubiquinone and can not grow on non fermentable _PROTEIN_ substrates . _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis protein restored the ability of the mutant cells to use glycerol and ethanol as sole _PROTEIN_ sources and the growth of these cells was indistinguishable from that of the knockout strain after re introduction of the gene . no functional rescue was seen when the mutant cells were transformed with the vector alone control . to corroborate this result the ubiquinone content of each strain was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography . as expected no ubiquinone was detected in the vector alone control while the extract of cells complemented with the gene contained ubiquinone and _METHOD_ with shorter side chains . in contrast the extract of cells harboring the plant construct displayed ubiquinone versions with longer side chain namely ubiquinone and and traces of ubiquinone . the relative quantities of various ubiquinone _METHOD_ were equally distributed between ubiquinone and those with shorter side chains in the complemented cells and between ubiquinone and in cells _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis protein . the total ubiquinone content of these two complemented strains was virtually identical . taken together these data indicate that _GENE_ is imported into yeast mitochondria where it functionally replaces the protein and confers trans long chain prenyl diphosphate synthase activity including solanesyl diphosphate synthase but still say nothing about its function in plants . extracts of wild type and of knockout yeast cells transformed with empty vector or harboring yeast or arabidopsis _GENE_ cdnas were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography . ubiquinone was quantified by diode array spectrophotometry . ubiquinone _METHOD_ with side chains shorter than and for which external standards were not available were identified by their absorption spectra . dashes indicate that no ubiquinone was detected . data are means standard _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of three replicates . as homozygous t dna knockouts corresponding to _GENE_ are embryo lethal an alternative silencing approach was used to directly investigate the function of this gene in arabidopsis . using previously generated rnai lines we selected three lines with severe silencing of _GENE_ and as control two lines with no significant change in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type level . consistent with these _PROTEIN_ profiles hplc analyses showed that the ubiquinone content in lines was reduced by compared with that of wild type plants but was not altered in lines and . in a complementary strategy to deregulate the _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ we generated stable arabidopsis lines overexpressing the gene s full length cdna under the control of the constitutive promoter . here again transformants were selected to cover a wide range of _PROTEIN_ levels of the transgene line displayed marginal overexpression compared with that of the wild type control while lines and showed _METHOD_ accumulation of the transcript . as observed with the rnai lines the ubiquinone content of the transgenics paralleled transcript levels showing a increase in line and a increase in lines and . as _GENE_ co occurs in _LOCATION_ and displays solanesyl diphosphate synthase activity we also investigated whether the enzyme could also participate in the biosynthesis of plastoquinone which like ubiquinone is made up of a benzoquinone _PROTEIN_ attached to a solanesyl side chain . hplc analyses showed no significant differences between the plastoquinone content of rnai lines overexpressing lines and and wild type plants . that _GENE_ participates in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone prompted us to revisit the evolutionary relationships of arabidopsis trans long chain prenyl diphosphate synthases with their homologues in selected prokaryotic and eukaryotic _METHOD_ . once populated a maximum likelihood tree segregated the plant enzymes into two phylogenetic clusters . the first clade which contains _GENE_ encompasses the yeast protein and its metazoan orthologs . the second one in contrast is made up exclusively of enzymes from oxygenic photosynthetic _METHOD_ . it includes _GENE_ the solanesyl diphosphate synthase previously thought to be involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis and a _LOCATION_ targeted paralog _GENE_ . notably these plant enzymes are monophyletic with trans long chain prenyl diphosphate synthases encoded in the _LOCATION_ genomes of rhodophytes glaucophytes and euglyphidae signaling their ancestry as remnants of cyanobacterial endosymbionts .

fusion under the control of _GENE_ s native promoter a bp genomic dna fragment including _GENE_ sequence up to a portion of the upstream gene was amplified using primers ccacattcttatccacgaaac and gaagatctcttgtttctggtgatgactct the latter containing a bglii restriction site . the amplified product was cut with bglii and ligated into ecori /bglii digested pcambia effectively replacing the vector own promoter and resulting in an in frame fusion with the n terminal end of _METHOD_ . this construct was electroporated into agrobacterium tumefaciens and the transformed cells were co infiltrated into the leaves of nicotiana benthamiana with an a. tumefaciens strain harboring that allowed _PROTEIN_ of the n terminal region of isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase fused to _METHOD_ as a marker of mitochondria . tobacco epidermal cells were imaged by confocal microscopy days _PROTEIN_ . for imaging in arabidopsis the pcambia _GENE_ _METHOD_ construct was stably introduced into arabidopsis

at in synthetic minimal medium containing yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and appropriate amino acid supplements . for complementation analyses similar number of cells of transformants and of their parent strain were plated on appropriately supplemented synthetic minimal media that contained d galactose as an inducer and either _PROTEIN_ or ethanol as

evaporated to dryness with gaseous nitrogen and resuspended in ml of methanol dichloromethane . due to the higher pigment complexity of the arabidopsis extracts it was not possible to fully resolve
