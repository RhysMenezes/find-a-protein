many fungal pathogens must enter plant cells for successful colonization . barley mildew resistance locus o is required for host cell invasion upon attack by the ascomycete powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f.sp . hordei and encodes the founder of a family of heptahelical integral _LOCATION_ proteins unique to plants . recessively inherited loss of function mutant alleles result in effective penetration resistance to all isolates of the biotrophic parasite . we used noninvasive _METHOD_ based imaging to show that _METHOD_ tagged mlo protein becomes redistributed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and accumulates beneath fungal appressoria coincident with the initiation of pathogen entry into host cells . _PROTEIN_ mlo accumulation occurs once upon attack and appears to be independent of actin _LOCATION_ function . likewise barley syntaxin a genetically defined component of penetration resistance to b. graminis f.sp . hordei and a subset of predicted pm resident proteins become redistributed to fungal entry sites . we previously identified calmodulin a cytoplasmic calcium sensor as an interactor and positive regulator of mlo activity and demonstrate here by fret microscopy an increase in mlo/calmodulin fret around penetration sites coincident with successful host cell entry . our data provide evidence for the formation of a pathogen triggered pm microdomain that is reminiscent of _LOCATION_ microdomains induced upon attempted entry of pathogenic bacteria in animal cells .
to examine a potential pathogen triggered subcellular compartmentalization of mlo we translationally fused the cytoplasmic c terminus of the protein with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in an mlo null mutant background we examined the subcellular localization of this functional fusion protein after ballistic transformation of barley leaf epidermal cells in the absence or presence of bgh sporelings by using confocal laser scanning microscopy . in the absence of the pathogen most of the mlo _METHOD_ fusion protein localized at the cellular periphery . consistent with biosynthesis of pm resident proteins at the _LOCATION_ and subsequent transport via the secretory pathway we detected some protein also in presumptive endomembranes and at the _LOCATION_ envelope . upon _PROTEIN_ with bgh conidiospores we observed a striking focal accumulation of the fusion protein beneath fungal appressoria at hpi . similar to fluorophore tagged mlo fusions we found that n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ also accumulates beneath attempted fungal penetration sites at hpi . furthermore accumulation of _METHOD_ occurred independent of mlo because an indistinguishable accumulation pattern was seen in an mlo null mutant background . next we analyzed transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ a functional fusion of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ or by native upstream sequences . in accordance with an independent study we found that in both lines pm resident _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated beneath fungal appressoria indicating that the subcellular relocalization is independent of gene _PROTEIN_ levels . in addition this finding suggests that pathogen triggered focal accumulation of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and barley syntaxins is a conserved feature in dicot and monocot epidermal cells . interestingly of the two germ tubes formed by bgh accumulation of mlo _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was seen exclusively beneath appressorial but not below primary germ tubes . to distinguish whether focal protein accumulation upon fungal _PROTEIN_ is a general phenomenon of integral pm polypeptides or is restricted to a subset of these proteins we selected six barley genes encoding predicted pm proteins known to be _PROTEIN_ in the leaf epidermis for further analysis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we fused the c terminus _PROTEIN_ of the respective genes with _METHOD_ transiently _PROTEIN_ the resulting constructs in barley epidermal cells and inoculated the leaves with bgh conidiospores . although each of the tested fusion proteins accumulated as expected in the periphery of leaf epidermal cells in the absence of the pathogen we failed to detect evidence for pathogen triggered focal accumulation upon _PROTEIN_ of either of the two aquaporin _METHOD_ the like receptor kinase or the lipid transfer protein . likewise neither cytoplasmic _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ nor an anonymous pm localized fluorophore tagged tobacco protein accumulated beneath fungal appressoria . unlike this finding cytochrome and the _PROTEIN_ related syntaxin were redistributed beneath attempted invasion sites . thus a subset of integral pm proteins becomes recruited to sites of pathogen entry indicating the formation of a pathogen triggered microdomain in the host pm . the formation of pm microdomains in animals and yeast is known to be often associated with a _PROTEIN_ of sterol rich domains and this can be visualized by using the fluorochrome filipin . we detected a striking accumulation of filipin mediated _METHOD_ at opposite poles of nongerminated bgh conidiospores . after spore germination filipin staining became diffuse in the spore body but concentrated in appressoria the tip of appressorial germ tubes _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _LOCATION_ sterols become _PROTEIN_ to the leading edge of fungal growth . filipin staining was also enriched at the septum which is known to separate the spore body from the _PROTEIN_ . collectively this pattern is essentially identical to the one described recently for candida albicans a human pathogenic ascomycete fungus . at hpi circular filipin mediated _METHOD_ was also detectable beneath appressoria in epidermal cells possibly indicating redistribution and _PROTEIN_ of plant sterols in the epidermal pm . we examined whether the accumulation of proteins beneath appressoria results from _PROTEIN_ concentration processes of preformed pm resident proteins or from de novo synthesized protein transported via secretory pathway . because the latter is thought to require actin filament guided vesicle trafficking we disrupted actin _LOCATION_ function in epidermal cells by overexpression of a barley actin depolymerizing _PROTEIN_ which leads to a complete arrest of actin dependent transport processes _LOCATION_ . coexpression of a _LOCATION_ targeted dsred variant and mlo _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ showed in most inspected cells focal accumulation at attempted penetration sites despite immotile and aggregated _LOCATION_ . we conclude that formation of the bgh triggered microdomain is unlikely to involve actin filament mediated transport processes . next we asked whether pathogen triggered _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation is a continuous process or is triggered once in response to the intruder . we performed frap experiments by using bgh _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at hpi . upon bleaching of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at focal accumulation sites there was no significant _METHOD_ recovery during a h recovery period . in contrast we found a rapid recovery of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after bleaching of pm resident _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at a distance from entry sites . these data suggest that the process of protein _PROTEIN_ is triggered only once after bgh attack whereas replenishment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at a distance occurs rapidly and continuously . because we could not resolve whether the accumulation of barley mlo _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ occurs in the pm in cell wall appositions or in both we inoculated leaves of arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with bgh conidiospores and at hpi plasmolysed the cells to retract the protoplast from the cell wall . after plasmolysis focally accumulated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was completely retracted beneath fungal appressoria in of inspected cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ accumulation sites are physically separable from cell wall appositions . pathogen triggered focal mlo accumulation prompted us to examine the spatiotemporal interaction dynamics with calmodulin known to be required for full mlo activity . an helical amphiphilic stretch in the cytoplasmic c terminal tail of mlo functions as cam binding domain and single amino acid substitutions in the cambd abolish cam binding both in vitro and in vivo . fusion constructs of barley mlo and cam were generated by using genes encoding _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ cam was found to localize in the cytoplasm the _LOCATION_ and at the cell periphery . upon coexpression of mlo _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ cam we detected colocalization at the cell periphery at endomembranes and around the _LOCATION_ thereby revealing potential interaction sites . to directly study the physical interaction between mlo and cam the respective _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were first used as donor acceptor pairs in fret studies in the absence of the fungus . apb and flim were applied to record fret . for each pair of constructs tested data were recorded from at least sample sites in at least transformed epidermal cells . mean fret efficiencies of were obtained for energy transfer between mlo _METHOD_ as an acceptor and _METHOD_ cam as a donor . we also swapped acceptor and donor fluorophores and recorded an almost identical fret efficiency of . importantly energy transfer between mlo _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ cam was significantly reduced when mutant variants of mlo bearing either a single or a double amino acid substitution in the cambd were used for apb experiments . similar low level fret signals were recorded in control experiments involving combinations of mlo _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or mock fret _METHOD_ . the background fret signal seen upon _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is likely due to an intrinsic affinity of the two fluorochromes to form dimers at elevated concentrations . collectively the data demonstrate that the _METHOD_ cam fusion protein retains the ability to bind to the authentic cambd and shows the requirement of an intact cambd for efficient fret between mlo and cam . the findings further suggest that despite nonphysiological _PROTEIN_ levels the fret signal reflects bona fide mlo/cam interactions in living cells in the absence of bgh . we noted that fret efficiencies varied from cell to cell and from region to region within the same cell possibly reflecting the dynamic nature of this protein protein interaction in living cells . to obtain spatial information about the mlo/cam interaction in horizontal sections of a whole epidermal cell we used time correlated single photon counting flim as an additional fret sensor . fret flim allows the direct study of protein protein interactions by monitoring _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor _METHOD_ molecule . whereas epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ cam or a combination of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed donor life times of ns there was a marked reduction in _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor when _METHOD_ cam was coexpressed with mlo _METHOD_ . this reduction was _PROTEIN_ confined to the cellular periphery and the perinuclear region where the two fusion proteins colocalize . notably the reduction in _METHOD_ cam lifetime varied in different regions probably indicating a highly dynamic nature of the mlo/cam interaction . coexpression of the mlo cambd mutant fused to _METHOD_ with cam fused to _METHOD_ resulted in _METHOD_ lifetimes close to ns . taken together the flim analysis provides additional support for the existence of constitutive and dynamic interactions between mlo and cam in the absence of the pathogen . we recorded in a time course experiment the mlo/cam interaction in pathogen _PROTEIN_ host cells . whereas fret apb efficiency was essentially unaltered hpi as compared with the noninoculated control a significant increase was detected hpi . this increase was not seen uniformly throughout the cell showing peak fret efficiency at the cell periphery around fungal penetration sites . because ectopic _PROTEIN_ of mlo permits pathogen entry in of attacked host cells the increase in fret efficiency correlates with the switch from surface to invasive fungal growth . at _PROTEIN_ time points fret efficiency _PROTEIN_ to levels that were similar to those seen in nonchallenged cells . to examine the correlation between pathogen entry and the increase of the mlo/cam interaction at hpi we determined fret between cam and nonfunctional mlo mutant variants . resistant barley mutants mlo and mlo encode mlo variants that either lack two amino acids in the second cytoplasmic loop or possess a single amino acid replacement in the third cytoplasmic loop respectively . both mutant proteins accumulate in the pm to indistinguishable levels in comparison with wild type mlo . upon transient _PROTEIN_ in a mlo null mutant background the two variants exhibit drastically reduced functionality . coexpression of _METHOD_ cam and _METHOD_ fusion constructs encoding the two nonfunctional mlo variants yielded fret efficiencies of and at hpi . this finding is comparable with the level seen with wild type mlo at the prepenetration stage . thus the two mutant mlo proteins each harboring an intact cambd appear to retain the ability to interact with cam but do not exhibit the increase in fret efficiency seen in the presence of wild type mlo that is coincident with fungal invasion . because the two tested nonfunctional mlo variants do not permit host cell entry of bgh to significant levels the amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic loops might either inhibit at a distance altered cam interactions in the c terminal tail of mlo or the fret efficiency enhancement requires successful fungal entry . to test the latter hypothesis we measured fret between wild type mlo _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ cam upon inoculation with the wheat powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f.sp . tritici . after inoculation with this inappropriate fungus that fails to invade barley epidermal cells at most interaction sites even in the presence of wild type mlo we observed a fret efficiency similar to mlo mlo and the noninoculated control . this finding strongly suggests that the pathogen triggered increase in mlo/cam fret efficiency requires successful fungal invasion into plant cells .
