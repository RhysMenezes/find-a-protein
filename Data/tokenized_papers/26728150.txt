the plant _LOCATION_ pore complex has strongly attracted the attention of the scientific community during the past few years in particular because of its involvement in hormonal and pathogen/symbiotic signalling . in arabidopsis thaliana more than nucleoporins have been identified but only a few of them have been characterized . among these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been reported to modulate auxin signalling since corresponding mutants are suppressors of the auxin resistance conferred by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the present work is focused on _PROTEIN_ which is essential for embryo and plant development . this protein is one of the three nucleoporins of the central channel of the _LOCATION_ pore complex . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in many organs and particularly in the embryo sac young germinating seedlings and at the adult stage in _PROTEIN_ of cauline leaves . the _PROTEIN_ mutant harbouring a t dna insertion in intron was identified as a knock down mutant . it displayed developmental phenotypes that suggested defects in auxin transport or responsiveness . _PROTEIN_ mutant plantlets were found to be hypersensitive to auxin at the cotyledon and root levels . the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing line further supported the existence of a link between _PROTEIN_ and auxin signalling . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ mutation led to an increase in the activity of the auxin responsive promoter and suppressed the auxin resistant root growth and leaf serration phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ appears to be a major negative regulator of auxin signalling . auxin hypersensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant reminding that of is in agreement with the reported interaction between _PROTEIN_ and proteins and suggests closely related functions . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on auxin signalling likely occurs in relation to scaffold proteins of the _LOCATION_ pore complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users .
_PROTEIN_ is not present on the arabidopsis microarray _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and we have therefore not been able to obtain traditional microarray data . however there are a few tilling array data indicating that the gene is _PROTEIN_ in flowers seedlings and juvenile leaves and to a lesser extent in adult leaves . in order to get more precisely the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the gene transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion were created . the gene contains small introns all located in the last third of the orf at a minimum distance of kb from the _PROTEIN_ . this distance together with the negative _PROTEIN_ scores of these introns make it unlikely that they might have a transcriptional activation function . the activity of the gus gene under the control of _PROTEIN_ promoter region allowed detecting a specific _PROTEIN_ pattern . indeed in adult plants gus staining was generally low except in _PROTEIN_ at the base of cauline leaves below flower buds . in other tissues it was diffuse and preferably localized in developing organs such as young leaves flowers and root tips . in young plantlets a low level _PROTEIN_ could be detected in the area of veins at the cotyledon tip . at early stages _PROTEIN_ could be found in the embryo sac . the highest gus activity was observed during germination at the junction between the hypocotyl and cotyledons . at the subcellular level the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was distributed at the _LOCATION_ periphery as expected with a clear punctuate pattern not previously observed . the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct allowed detecting a broad _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ which might be due to overexpression.fig . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity and protein distribution . tissue specific

_PROTEIN_ gene displays a specific organization with two completely different zones . the first zone is intronless represents the initial two thirds of the orf and encodes the _PROTEIN_ repeat domain

both displaying a t dna insertion in the intron . we were able to isolate viable homozygous seeds only from _PROTEIN_ in agreement with the previously observed lethal effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the third mutant or _PROTEIN_ displaying a amino acid deletion has a less visible phenotype compared to _PROTEIN_ and was not used in this study . rt pcr and quantitative real time pcr results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is not a bona fide knock out plant but a mutant with reduced transcript levels . sequencing pcr products at the exon exon junction region revealed no difference in sequence between the wild type and the mutant . thus in the mutant plant the intron that contains the t dna can be spliced exactly as the intron of the wild type gene albeit with _PROTEIN_ efficiency . real time quantitative pcr results allowed concluding that the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a strong reduction of the spliced transcript . previous analyses of a suppressive mutant and two t dna insertion mutants revealed the same phenotypic defects . all plants impaired in _PROTEIN_ function were small with reduced leaf blades and bolting occurred earlier than in the wild type . we examined _PROTEIN_ plants at different growth stages . in vitro grown mutant seedlings _METHOD_ displayed small cotyledons and frequent abnormalities such as cotyledon malformations fused cotyledons and polycotyly cotyledons fig . and table . this change in cotyledon number is exceptional in wild type col plants . cotyledons of mutant plantlets also became epinastic . in the greenhouse on compost at the rosette and subsequent stages mutant plants had smaller leaf blades than wild type plants and flowering occurred earlier as described previously . besides other anomalies were also detected . flowers were often abnormal and siliques much smaller than in wild type plants with a longer desiccation time . we harvested mg of wild type seeds per plant vs mg of mutant seeds from plants grown in parallel in individual pots . the _PROTEIN_ cdna under control of _PROTEIN_ gene promoter complemented the germination and adult plant phenotypes as well as the cotyledon phenotypes.table of plants

interestingly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed plant displayed a high level of _PROTEIN_ transcript a marked phenotype of reduced growth at the adult stage and an intermediate phenotype in cotyledons . auxin sensitivity of wild type and mutant plants was examined by growth on dinitrophenoxyacetic acid a stable auxin analogue . on and nm d aerial parts of wild type and complemented plants were moderately affected by the treatment which mostly inhibited root growth .fig . hypersensitivity of the different _PROTEIN_ genotypes . a growth on vertical plates on different

growth on vertical agar plates was compared at the different concentrations of hormone . whereas roots of col _PROTEIN_ complemented and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were all affected in the presence of d the effect was stronger in the mutant and in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ genotypes whose residual primary root growth on nm d was only about and of that on control medium compared to about for the other two genotypes . a phenotype was also observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in cotyledons . these organs already reduced and epinastic in the absence of auxin analogue treatment became tiny and severely distorted on nm d . despite their root phenotype similar to that of the mutant the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plantlets did not display the phenotype of small epinastic cotyledons . this paradox can be explained by the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein which appears to be almost absent in cotyledons both on _METHOD_ and d containing media . the synthetic promoter is commonly used to detect auxin activity . in a wild type genetic background gus _PROTEIN_ under the control of can be detected in root tips hydathodes and leaf margins . in cotyledons intense blue staining was always restricted to leaf margins . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings harbouring the gus construct compared to isogenic gus seedlings displayed a higher gus activity in cotyledons in which the staining extended towards the centre of these organs . this suggested altered auxin activity in the _PROTEIN_ plants . in young germinating seedlings gus activity was restricted to the cotyledons the root tip and the inner edge of the hypocotyl alongside the cotyledons in agreement with previous reports . the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted in an extension of the staining to the external upper part of the hypocotyl where _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a subunit of the rub activating enzyme necessary for the auxin dependent degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional repressors . _PROTEIN_ mutants are resistant to auxin and also display a specific phenotype under standard growth conditions . this consists in a reduced height defect in root gravitropism abnormal inflorescences low fertility and serrated leaves . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutation conferred sensitivity to auxin . we therefore created the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . this mutant had lost the phenotype of leaf serrations . leaves were also frequently embossed and misshaped suggesting additional developmental _METHOD_ that were not present in the parent lines . most importantly the auxin resistance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was reversed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . indeed _PROTEIN_ plants had no apparent growth defect on nm d whereas double mutant plants were sensitive to the auxin analogue treatment . the restoration of root sensitivity was partial on nm d but complete on nm . q pcr analyses also revealed that the double mutant had a less reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ transcript compared to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant .fig . of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . a plants grown in the greenhouse . the lower

ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the aux/iaa repressors of auxin response for ubiquitination and degradation . in the auxin signalling cascade this scf complex is composed of _PROTEIN_ the cullin _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ f box protein that specifically recognizes the aux/iaa proteins to be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome . a two hybrid screening with one of the other two _PROTEIN_ nucleoporins of the central channel of the npc resulted in the identification of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one of its homologues _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was found times in that screening always in frame with the activation domain of from different positions in its sequence . we therefore tested the hypothesis of an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in both bait/prey combinations . _PROTEIN_ displayed a strong intrinsic transcriptional activity leading to growth on medium lacking histidine . the presence of _PROTEIN_ fused to the activator domain did not increase the signal . in the reciprocal test _PROTEIN_ displayed a weak transcriptional activity which was not enhanced by _PROTEIN_ .
the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock center _PROTEIN_ . homozygotes were selected by pcr for insertion of t dna _PROTEIN_ and for disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is _PROTEIN_ . for the complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr using oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ and

extraction and subsequent steps a completely independent repeat of rna/dna extractions and rt /genomic dna pcrs was done and results were identical . total rnas were extracted from plantlets grown on
