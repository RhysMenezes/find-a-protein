in land plants _PROTEIN_ auxin transport is one of the substantial processes guiding whole plant _PROTEIN_ and morphogenesis . directional auxin fluxes are mediated by _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carriers _PROTEIN_ localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ of exocytosis in yeast and animals is assisted by the exocyst an octameric vesicle tethering complex and an effector of rab and rho _PROTEIN_ . here we show that rootward _PROTEIN_ auxin transport is compromised in roots of arabidopsis thaliana loss of function mutants in the _PROTEIN_ exocyst subunit . the recycling of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins from brefeldin a compartments is delayed after the brefeldin a washout in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exocyst mutants . relocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins after prolonged brefeldin a treatment is largely impaired in these mutants . at the same time however _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the other exocyst subunits studied _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is resistant to brefeldin a treatment . in root cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant a portion of _PROTEIN_ is internalized and retained in specific abnormally enlarged endomembrane compartments that are distinct from vha labelled early endosomes or the trans _LOCATION_ network but are _PROTEIN_ positive . we conclude that the exocyst is involved in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recycling and thus in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport regulation .
we previously described _METHOD_ of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant pointing to possible changes in auxin homeostasis or signalling . further analysis revealed new deviations supporting such a notion . we observed a loss of root waving and a skewing to the opposite side compared with the wild type in plants cultivated on agar plates inclined at . also distinctly larger root caps caused by accumulation of border like cell layers were obvious in day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings . microscopic inspection of the root columella cells revealed a reduced level of statolite starch as evaluated by image analysis after lugol 's staining _PROTEIN_ . however root gravitropism was unaffected as the only root gravitropic defect observed in _PROTEIN_ plants was transient primary root disorientation during seed germination . whereas only of wt primary roots started to grow in a direction differing by more than from the gravity vector as many as of _PROTEIN_ roots showed such disorientation . normal root growth direction however was established in those seedlings in the days after germination . the gus auxin response reporter was used to reveal defects of _PROTEIN_ roots in auxin metabolism transport or signalling . the gus signal was weaker in the root tips of day old light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings than in the wt _PROTEIN_ . furthermore rootward transport of indole acetic acid from the shoot root transition zone was assayed and was found to be _PROTEIN_ by in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wt . a comparable _PROTEIN_ in auxin transport was also detected for _PROTEIN_ another _PROTEIN_ mutant allele but not for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . subsequent analyses of gus _PROTEIN_ after external application of iaa locally on the shoot root transition zone confirmed our previous observation . in wt plants iaa was transported towards the root tip and induced gus _PROTEIN_ along the vascular tissue within h thereby reporting efficient iaa canalization into the stele and transport to the root tip . in _PROTEIN_ on the contrary iaa was accumulated around the region of application was improperly canalized and the gus signal along most of the vascular tissue length was still absent h after application indicating that the rootward auxin transport was retarded . the observed _PROTEIN_ in rootward auxin transport is more consistent with what has been reported for loss of _PROTEIN_ function rather than the greater _PROTEIN_ seen in abcb mutants . consistent with an impact primarily on _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin transport the _PROTEIN_ inhibitor gravacin inhibited the rootward transport in _PROTEIN_ only more than in the wt and the _PROTEIN_ auxin uptake inhibitor noa had no less effect on transport in _PROTEIN_ when applied to seedlings h after auxin application . we conclude that rootward _PROTEIN_ is severely affected in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants possibly in a _PROTEIN_ dependent way . the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulates a portion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in abnormally expanded endomembrane compartments that can be visualized with dye min after application and that are absent in the wt . these compartments were observed in all _PROTEIN_ seedlings analysed with an average incidence of of root cells per plant . we did not detect such compartments in any wt plant analysed . in the case of _PROTEIN_ we detected the abnormal compartments with an average incidence of in all mutant seedlings studied . again no such compartment was detected in wt plants . the difference in the incidence of these abnormal compartments between wt and mutant plants was tested using the generalized linear models with binomial distribution of _LOCATION_ . the weight of each individual plant in the model was proportional to the number of cells analysed . the significance of glmbinom was tested through the test and found to be highly significant . these abnormal endomembrane compartments are positive for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a marker of recycling endosomes but are clearly distinct from the early endosome/trans _LOCATION_ network marked by the vha _METHOD_ marker . a significant difference between wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant cells was also observed in the re establishment of the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the pm after bfa induced internalization and subsequent bfa removal . a h bfa treatment resulted in the internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both wt and _PROTEIN_ plants . washout of bfa resulted in the re establishment of pm localization of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after min in the wt . in contrast bfa compartments containing _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ were still present in cells even min after the washout in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . to exclude that the disaggregation of bfa compartments after bfa washout was affected by different accumulation of bfa compartments after h of bfa treatment we compared the proportion of affected cells after h of bfa treatment in both wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we found no difference between both genotypes . we observed the relocalization of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins from bfa compartments to the apical pm domain after a prolonged h of bfa treatment in wt cells which is consistent with a previous report by kleine vehn et al . . in contrast such relocalization was significantly impaired in _PROTEIN_ mutants where _PROTEIN_ proteins remained accumulated _PROTEIN_ in bfa compartments pointing strongly to the _PROTEIN_ function in the recycling of _PROTEIN_ between endomembrane compartments and the pm . although we observed the partial relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from basal to apical pm referred to as transcytosis in the wt it was not so pronounced in _PROTEIN_ cells . despite the _PROTEIN_ that bfa compartments were still present after prolonged bfa treatment partial _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ super apicalization i.e . the relocalization of _PROTEIN_ to the middle of the apical _LOCATION_ was documented in _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells . to confirm results from both transient and prolonged chronic bfa treatment and to eliminate possible artefacts caused by _METHOD_ fusions we also visualized the effect of bfa using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies as well as . these experiments provided data identical to results obtained with _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and fully proved our observations . similar defects in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recycling after both transient and prolonged bfa treatment were also observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant partially complemented by _PROTEIN_ . again the difference between wt and mutant plants was highly significant . loss of _PROTEIN_ function also affected the trafficking of the brassinosteroid receptor _PROTEIN_ a transmembrane protein that constitutively cycles between endomembrane compartments and the pm through bfa sensitive trafficking . bfa treatment of wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in the formation of _PROTEIN_ positive bfa compartments recycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ back to the pm was significantly delayed after the washout and relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from bfa compartments to the pm after prolonged bfa treatment was blocked in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in both cases the difference between wt and mutant plants was highly significant . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ exocyst subunit is required for a more general recycling of pm proteins . after transformation of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the restoration of wt phenotypes was observed in _PROTEIN_ homozygotes . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized evenly at the pm partially in the cytoplasm and at post cytokinetic cross walls in both transformed mutant plants and wt . we also recorded a similar localization for other exocyst subunits _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the pm localization of all exocyst subunits tested was resistant to treatment with bfa for h .
mutant arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been described previously as well as lines _PROTEIN_ gus vha _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the preparation of col lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was described in fendrych et al . . the _PROTEIN_ cds was cloned into a modified pvkh vector using spei and sali sites to yield the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion and the construct was used for agrobacterium mediated transformation of col plants . arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and dispersed onto agar plates with growing medium half strength _METHOD_ salts supplemented with sucrose vitamins plant agar buffered to ph . stratification was performed at for days . seedlings were either grown vertically or grown on an inclined agar surface in a climate chamber held at under long day conditions . rootward auxin transport was measured in day old seedlings as described in blakeslee et al . with the following modifications a nl droplet of mm iaa was applied to the root shoot transition zone . the noa inhibitor was applied h after the initiation of assays by pipetting droplets in agarose at the root shoot transition zone . gravacin was applied after h as droplets on the surface of each primary root with the solution restricted to the chromatography paper strip supporting this section of the root . as roots of light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings are on average about shorter than wt roots only _PROTEIN_ and wt seedlings with comparable root length were used for the measurements . auxin transport was visualized in day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus similarly as described in rashotte et al . . plantlets were treated with an application of iaa in a agar cylinder on the root shoot junction for or h. for gus staining seedlings were vacuum infiltrated with staining solution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_
