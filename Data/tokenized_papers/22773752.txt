constitutive endocytic recycling is a crucial mechanism allowing regulation of the activity of proteins at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and for rapid changes in their localization as demonstrated in plants for _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ proteins the auxin transporters . to identify novel molecular components of endocytic recycling _PROTEIN_ exocytosis we designed a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ imaging based forward genetic screen for arabidopsis thaliana mutants that showed increased intracellular accumulation of cargos in response to the trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a . we identified _PROTEIN_ a novel dominant mutant carrying a missense mutation that disrupts a conserved sequence motif of the small _PROTEIN_ ras genes from rat . _PROTEIN_ displays defects such as enhanced protein accumulation in abnormal bfa compartments aberrant endosomes and defective exocytosis and transcytosis . _PROTEIN_ localizes to trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosomes and acts on distinct trafficking processes like those regulated by _PROTEIN_ exchange _PROTEIN_ on adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hopm visualized endocytic trafficking _PROTEIN_ which regulate trafficking at the _LOCATION_ apparatus and tgn/ee respectively . all together this study identifies arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ as a novel regulator of protein trafficking from a tgn/ee compartment to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
to understand the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ endocytic recycling and to identify molecular components that regulate this process we used a forward genetic approach . complete inhibition of protein cycling might be lethal therefore a typical morphology based screen for the identification of mutants defective in the endocytic recycling of the proteins might be ineffective . to overcome this limitation we designed a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ imaging based screen and looked for mutants that showed subcellular defects in the brefeldin a induced intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the fungal toxin bfa has proven to be an excellent tool to investigate protein trafficking as it inhibits intracellular trafficking _PROTEIN_ secretion and causes the accumulation of pm proteins such as basal localized _PROTEIN_ into large aggregates known as bfa compartments or bfa bodies . nonetheless long term bfa treatment leads to the gradual disappearance of _PROTEIN_ from the bfa compartment and its relocation to the apical pm . hence we screened for mutants that in contrast with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ control line showed abnormal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intracellular accumulation after a h treatment with bfa indicating defective exocytosis . this approach is distinct from the previously reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ screens that were focused on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregations in the absence of any treatments or on short term bfa treatments . by screening the progeny of ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ individuals we obtained five nonallelic mutants that were named to . here we identify and characterize the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the wild type endogenous _PROTEIN_ or transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins showed intracellular endosomal agglomerations after a h treatment with bfa . these bfa induced _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerations were enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . similar to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins displayed enhanced intracellular aggregation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant following bfa treatment . interestingly other proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and nonpolar pm proteins such as aquaporin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or pm _PROTEIN_ also showed enhanced bfa induced intracellular accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results show that the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhances bfa induced protein accumulation indicating a more general defect in protein trafficking . to further investigate the cause of _PROTEIN_ hypersensitivity to bfa we analyzed the cell ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ roots a h treatment with bfa caused the heterogeneous aggregation of vesicle like structures that became surrounded at their periphery by _LOCATION_ stacks as reported previously . we named this characteristic endosomal agglomeration a typical bfa compartment as of the total bfa compartments counted in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ roots had this morphology . in contrast in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant bfa induced a different aggregation pattern . only of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bfa induced aggregates displayed the typical bfa compartment morphology while the others looked more enlarged abnormally shaped and less compact and the vesicles from their composition displayed an altered morphology such as abnormal size shape and composition . to test whether the impaired protein trafficking caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects overall plant development we investigated the morphology of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings had smaller cotyledons and shorter roots than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein is important for plant growth and development . previous studies have shown that bfa also affects root growth . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displays a different root growth sensitivity to bfa we germinated and grew the mutant on medium supplemented with bfa . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings on bfa had shorter roots than control seedlings indicating that not only at the subcellular level but also at the plant level _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is hypersensitive to bfa . together these findings support the hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in some bfa sensitive trafficking processes . to test if the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in exocytosis we performed a min treatment with bfa followed by a min wash out in murashige and skoog _METHOD_ liquid medium . the intracellular agglomeration of _PROTEIN_ proteins caused by bfa treatment is reversible hence we could observe almost complete disappearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the bfa compartments in the control cells treated with bfa followed by wash out . in contrast strong bfa induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ agglomerations persisted in the _PROTEIN_ mutant after bfa removal . this result suggests that exocytosis is defective in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant and indicates that _PROTEIN_ acts as a regulator of protein trafficking to the pm . during the long term bfa treatment pm proteins with a basal localization such as _PROTEIN_ first agglomerate in the bfa compartments and then subsequently disappear from the bfa compartment and relocalize to the apical pm . this process involves protein translocation from the basal to the apical side of a _PROTEIN_ cell and is called transcytosis . no or very little _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerations could be observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ root cells treated for h with bfa . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed strong intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation . the bfa treated seedlings were briefly stained with propidium iodide to determine their cell viability . the observed impaired transcytosis indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ trafficking from the bfa compartment to the apical side of the pm which supports the hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects protein trafficking to the pm . defective protein trafficking to the pm in the _PROTEIN_ mutant may impair secretion and/or recycling . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed bfa hypersensitivity also when we performed the bfa treatment in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in the enlarged bfa bodies comes from a recycled but not newly synthesized pool of proteins . to examine if the degradation pathway is impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we performed a dark treatment experiment that allows the visualization of the _LOCATION_ targeting of _METHOD_ tagged proteins . a h dark treatment followed by the observation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed that in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated into the _LOCATION_ . furthermore a min staining with followed by a h treatment with bfa showed the expected overaccumulation of and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into abnormal bfa bodies in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . moreover in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings also labeled the tonoplast . these two findings show that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not interfere with the trafficking of proteins from the tgn/ee to the _LOCATION_ and support the hypothesis that recycling is defective in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to gain further insight into trafficking defects in _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . live imaging of untreated _PROTEIN_ mutant roots revealed an increased endosomal and pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ endosomes in the mutant cells were enlarged brighter and sometimes appeared in aggregates . similarly the uptake of the _LOCATION_ selective _METHOD_ dye commonly used to investigate endocytosis and vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells revealed slightly abnormal endosomal compartments in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these findings together with the abnormal morphology of the bfa compartment indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects endosomal compartments that are sensitive to bfa such as the _LOCATION_ and/or the tgn/ee . thus we investigated the localization of the _LOCATION_ marker . by performing immunolocalization experiments we found that did not show altered localization in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that the ga morphology may not be affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . as the tgn/ee is another endosomal compartment that is a target of bfa we investigated the localization of commonly used tgn/ee markers such as clathrin light chain and . live imaging of _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed no dramatic or quantifiable defects in the localization of these proteins although sometimes _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ endosomes appeared slightly enlarged and brighter . notably we found that _PROTEIN_ a protein defining a tgn compartment that contributes to cell plate formation displayed an impaired localization in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is impaired in a process that takes place at a tgn/ee compartment . tem performed on roots of untreated seedlings confirmed that _PROTEIN_ endosomes have a defective morphology . the typical morphology of the ga tgn/ee complex observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ root cells was impaired in the root cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the predominant defect in the mutant was characterized by endosomal/vesicle like clusters present in the neighborhood of ga tgn/ee _PROTEIN_ at one of its sides . the vesicles had a more heterogeneous size and generally larger size and were often fused and abnormally shaped . the abnormal accumulation of aberrant vesicles in the vicinity of the tgn/ee suggests that _PROTEIN_ is defective in vesicle budding and/or trafficking and supports a role of _PROTEIN_ in protein/vesicle trafficking from a tgn/ee compartment to the pm . next we investigated the site of _PROTEIN_ action in protein trafficking . for this purpose we analyzed the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a mutant defective in protein trafficking from the tgn/ee to the re and _PROTEIN_ a mutant impaired at the ga . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are distinct from _PROTEIN_ as they showed a dramatically reduced intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ following a h treatment with bfa a phenotype largely opposite to that of _PROTEIN_ . when crossed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background _PROTEIN_ showed complete and _PROTEIN_ showed partial epistasis to _PROTEIN_ . thus the root cells of the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed less bfa induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ protein than the single _PROTEIN_ mutant . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ and the large arf gefs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act at different steps along the intracellular trafficking pathway and that in a subcellular _LOCATION_ flow _PROTEIN_ acts after _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . however both double mutants showed additive effects _PROTEIN_ the root length and overall plant growth and development of the aerial part consistent with the notion that combined partial defects at two instances of the protein trafficking pathways have a greater impact on plant growth than a single defect . overall these results are consistent with the finding that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disrupt intracellular protein trafficking at distinct steps with _PROTEIN_ impairing protein trafficking in the post tgn/ee pathway . we identified _PROTEIN_ as a dominant mutant . using recombinants selected for the wild type subcellular phenotype we cloned _PROTEIN_ by map based cloning to a region of kb on the left arm of chromosome . because of a low recombination rate in this chromosome region we chose not to further narrow down the interval but to use a candidate approach for gene identification . we sequenced several candidates and identified a point mutation that causes amino acid substitution in a conserved _PROTEIN_ binding site in the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the mutation in _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the defective protein trafficking we analyzed two knockout t dna insertion alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these mutants did not show similar phenotypes to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the root growth hypersensitivity to bfa or exocytosis defects although the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed mild defects in subcellular bfa sensitivity . these results suggest functional redundancy with other _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ from the raba class . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the observed protein trafficking defects we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ dominant mutation _PROTEIN_ under the control of both the native and the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and subsequently transformed these constructs into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line . similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed high intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerations after a h treatment with bfa . in contrast week and sporadic bfa compartments could be observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ control . similar retention of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into abnormal bfa bodies in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes the observed protein trafficking defects . surprisingly overexpression of the wild type clone _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background also resembles the _PROTEIN_ subcellular phenotype . this indicates that wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ does not suppress the _PROTEIN_ phenotype but generates a dominant phenotype . to investigate the nature of the _PROTEIN_ mutation we generated _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis _PROTEIN_ mutants by creating mutations in the conserved sequence motifs that are well known to either stabilize the gdp bound or _PROTEIN_ bound form . thus we generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutants known to act as dn and ca versions respectively . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the roots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ treated for h with bfa showed that dn _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not ca _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed bfa oversensitivity similarly to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results show that _PROTEIN_ carrying the mutation in the etsal conserved sequence motif of _PROTEIN_ small _PROTEIN_ acts as a dn mutant and identifies this mutation as a potential target of dn manipulations in small _PROTEIN_ . next we investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by generating transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background . both transgenic constructs showed the same pattern of localization throughout the root with higher occurrence in the root meristem specifically in the root cap _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . at the subcellular level red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled punctate structures resembling endosomes that were sensitive to bfa . in addition _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed faint localization at the pm and notably they strongly labeled the cell plates during cell division . to address the identity of the _PROTEIN_ compartments we performed colocalization experiments and found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ endosomes showed partial colocalization with early accumulation of the lipophilic styryl dye . it has been shown that labels endosomal compartments of the endocytic pathway and that the early site of accumulation corresponds to the tgn/ee . the partial colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ endosomes with early labeled endosomes indicates that _PROTEIN_ localizes at a tgn/ee compartment . moreover _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed partial or complete colocalization with other known tgn/ee markers such as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize with _LOCATION_ markers and n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ although it often showed localization in their immediate proximity . together these results show that _PROTEIN_ localizes at a tgn/ee compartment and further support the notion that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in protein trafficking from this compartment to the pm .
