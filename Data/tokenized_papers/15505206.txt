the arabidopsis tandem pore k channels displaying four transmembrane domains and two pore regions share structural homologies with their animal counterparts of the kcnk family . in contrast to the shaker like arabidopsis channels the functional properties and the biological role of plant tpk channels have not been elucidated yet . here we show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in pollen . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resembles the electrical properties of a voltage independent k channel after _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes and yeast . hyperpolarizing as well as depolarizing _LOCATION_ voltages elicited instantaneous k currents which were blocked by _LOCATION_ calcium and cytoplasmic protons . functional complementation assays using a k transport deficient yeast confirmed the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the _PROTEIN_ channel . the features of _PROTEIN_ point toward a role in potassium homeostasis and _LOCATION_ voltage control of the growing pollen tube . thus _PROTEIN_ represents a member of plant tandem pore k channels resembling the characteristics of its animal counterparts as well as plant specific features with respect to modulation of channel activity by acidosis and calcium .
members of the arabidopsis tpk family _PROTEIN_ share a common topology and exhibit a predicted binding motif at their amino terminus together with a putative binding domain at their _PROTEIN_ terminus . _PROTEIN_ represents a structurally unique member within this family because it lacks both regulatory sites . to gain insights into the biological function of _PROTEIN_ we localized and functionally _PROTEIN_ this arabidopsis channel and characterized a corresponding knockout mutant . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in pollen and localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a combination of rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ techniques were used to amplify the predicted _PROTEIN_ cdna from flowers . by using quantitative real time rt pcr very low transcript numbers were detected in leaves roots pods and _METHOD_ . flowers in general and pollen in particular however represented the sites of highest _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance . in addition pollen _PROTEIN_ the shaker like inward rectifiers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the so far uncharacterized _PROTEIN_ channel . both arabidopsis k efflux channels the root stelar outward rectifier stelar k outward rectifier _PROTEIN_ and the guard cell outward rectifier guard cell outward rectifying k channel _PROTEIN_ were found to be _PROTEIN_ in pollen too . in addition to _PROTEIN_ all other members of the tpk family are _PROTEIN_ in flowers . to study the cellular specificity of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity throughout plant development a upstream sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene was translationally fused to the e. coli _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and transferred to the _LOCATION_ genome of a. thaliana . transgenic plants harboring the fusion construct _PROTEIN_ gus exhibited gus activity in root tips hypocotyls and pollen grains . when _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ as a translational fusion with the _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells h after ballistic bombardment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in compartments of the secretory pathway . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit altered electrical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ properties . to elucidate the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ we isolated a homozygous t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ mutants the t dna insertion site was verified by sequencing to be bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon . remarkably the t dna was inserted twice with left border sequences oriented toward the _PROTEIN_ gene . as a result of the insertion _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable in _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants indicating a knockout situation . according to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in pollen and possibly hypocotyls and root tips _PROTEIN_ plants were analyzed for phenotypic changes in a number of growth assays . no impairment of pollen germination rate and growth as well as hypocotyl or root growth was detectable in knockout plants . using the double barreled impalement technique we characterized the electrophysiological properties of wt and mutant pollen tubes in more detail . when impaling intact pollen tubes derived from wt plants we found the electrical properties of the pollen tube _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to be dominated by three major conductances . at depolarizing _LOCATION_ voltages slowly activating voltage dependent outward rectifying currents were activated whereas hyperpolarizing voltage pulses elicited time and voltage dependent inward currents . in addition an instantaneously activating voltage independent conductance superimposed the two rectifiers . this instantaneous current however was significantly reduced in pollen tubes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . thus the ratio of the instantaneous and time dependent currents between to mv was lower in _PROTEIN_ than in wt plants . this finding indicates that _PROTEIN_ contributes to the voltage independent background currents of the pollen tube _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is a k selective open rectifier. to gain insights into the biophysical properties of _PROTEIN_ this two pore channel was functionally _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes and analyzed by using the two electrode voltage clamp technique . after pulses to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltages instantaneous k selective currents were recorded . the current voltage curve showed a strong asymmetry under nearly symmetrical k concentrations with ohmic behavior at voltages negative to the potassium reversal voltage . positive to ek saturation followed by a negative slope conductance was observed . the oocyte _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed nearly nernstian voltage shifts upon changes in external k concentrations with a shift of mv per fold change in external k concentration . in accordance with the properties of a k selective channel the relative permeability of _PROTEIN_ for monovalent cations was _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mediated inward currents were almost completely blocked by mm external cs whereas a voltage dependent block of the inward currents at high external became evident at voltages more negative than mv . in cell attached as well as inside out patches from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes single to ps channels could be resolved . the open channel i v curve of a single _PROTEIN_ channel showed an asymmetrical shape very similar to that of the whole cell i v curve indicating that the weak inward rectification results from a fast open channel block rather than from a lower open probability at positive voltages . single channel properties in response to voltage steps and ramps were in agreement with the macroscopic _PROTEIN_ currents . _PROTEIN_ complements growth of a yeast mutant . to further elucidate the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ this channel in a k transport deficient mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae . in accordance with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized k channel growth assays under k limiting conditions demonstrated the capability of _PROTEIN_ to complement growth of the yeast mutant . after yeast growth at different external calcium concentrations we found _PROTEIN_ mediated growth rescue at potassium when calcium concentration was low . at mm calcium in the medium yeast growth was inhibited already at times higher potassium supply . patch clamp analyses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells confirmed the electrophysiological properties of this k channel recognized in xenopus oocytes . single channel recordings on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast allowed us to deduce a slope conductance of ps . the time averaged i v relationship exhibited the typical features of an open rectifier . these data clearly demonstrate that in both eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ xenopus oocytes and yeast cells the _PROTEIN_ channel is translocated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ failed to restore growth of the k transport deficient yeast mutant . _PROTEIN_ translationally fused to _METHOD_ associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of yeast cells only consistent with its targeting in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ is sensitive to acidosis . modulation of animal tpk channels has been shown to be mediated by various stimuli such as mechanical stress and temperature or protons . in contrast to plant shaker like channels and members of the animal tandem pore k channels of the tandem pore acid sensing k channel family . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was not sensitive to changes in _LOCATION_ ph . cytoplasmic acidosis in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes in response to acetate treatment however suppressed _PROTEIN_ mediated whole cell currents completely a behavior that distinguishes the arabidopsis channel from e.g. twik related k channel an acid activated k channel . the mechanism of acid mediated current reduction was analyzed during ph changes from ph to at the cytoplasmic side of an inside out patch . although the open channel current amplitudes did not change during bath perfusion with buffers of different ph _LOCATION_ acidification drastically reduced the open probability of _PROTEIN_ . thus the reversible modulation of channel activity by cytoplasmic protons points to an intrinsic ph sensor in the _PROTEIN_ channel a feature reminiscent of the human two pore channels two p domain weak inwardly rectifying k channel and twik and of the yeast two pore channel two p domain outwardly rectifying k channel . to test the mechano sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ channel we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ with the samanea aquaporin _PROTEIN_ and applied osmotic stress . unlike twik related k channel _PROTEIN_ was only moderately sensitive to _LOCATION_ stretch . hypoosmotic steps from to mosmol increased _PROTEIN_ mediated whole cell inward currents in xenopus oocytes up to in a reversible manner . like trek _PROTEIN_ was heat activated and from an arrhenius plot of the maximal _PROTEIN_ conductance a of for temperatures > and a of for temperatures < could be determined . these data implicate future studies toward the mechano and temperature dependence of wt and mutant pollen tube growth .
