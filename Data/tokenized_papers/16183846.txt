aquaporins facilitate the uptake of soil water and mediate the regulation of root hydraulic conductivity in response to a large variety of environmental stresses . here we use arabidopsis plants to dissect the effects of salt on both lpr and aquaporin _PROTEIN_ and investigate possible molecular and cellular _METHOD_ of aquaporin regulation in plant roots under stress . treatment of plants by mm nacl was perceived as an osmotic stimulus and induced a rapid and significant _PROTEIN_ in lpr which was _PROTEIN_ for at least h. macroarray experiments with gene specific tags were performed to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of all genes of the arabidopsis aquaporin family . transcripts from individual aquaporin genes most of which encoded members of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ and tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ subfamilies were detected in nontreated roots . all _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aquaporin transcripts with a strong _PROTEIN_ signal showed a to _PROTEIN_ in their abundance between and h following exposure to salt . the use of antipeptide antibodies that cross reacted with _METHOD_ of specific aquaporin subclasses revealed that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by as early as min after salt exposure whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologs showed a to _PROTEIN_ in abundance after h of treatment . _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants of aquaporins fused to the green _METHOD_ protein revealed that the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologs was unchanged after min of exposure to salt whereas a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion was relocalized into intracellular spherical structures tentatively identified as intravacuolar invaginations . the appearance of intracellular structures containing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologs was occasionally observed after h of salt treatment . in conclusion this work shows that exposure of roots to salt induces changes in aquaporin _PROTEIN_ at multiple levels . these changes include a coordinated transcriptional down regulation and subcellular relocalization of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these _METHOD_ may act in concert to regulate root water transport mostly in the long term .
hydroponically grown arabidopsis plants were transferred to a fresh nutrient solution with or without salt concentrations up to mm . after h entire root _METHOD_ were excised and inserted into a pressure chamber with a bathing solution similar to that initially applied to the intact root . all roots showed a linear relationship between exuded sap flow rate and applied pressure for _PROTEIN_ < p < _PROTEIN_ . was defined as the linearly extrapolated x intercept of the jv curve . provides an estimate of the balancing pressure required to counteract possible osmotic driving forces present across the root . control roots _PROTEIN_ in a standard nutrient solution without salt exhibited reduced spontaneous exudation and was close to zero . in salt treated roots was positive and increased with the strength of the saline solution up to _PROTEIN_ at mm nacl . these data suggest that salt exposure results in a strong negative osmotic pressure gradient between the xylem vessels and the root bathing solution . can be experimentally determined from the difference in osmolality between exuded sap and root bathing solution . figure was derived from data obtained on individual roots as shown in figure . it shows that was linearly related to with a slope coefficient . can be interpreted as the root reflection coefficient whereby represents the osmotic driving force across the root . a value below unity suggests that the arabidopsis root functions as an imperfect osmometer . this idea was corroborated by the observation that linearly increased with the externally applied salt concentration . collectively these results establish the physical basis of osmotically and hydrostatically driven water transport in the arabidopsis root . they also show that for plants exposed to varying salt concentrations the slope of the jv curve reported to root dry weight can be used as an estimate of lpr . control plants _PROTEIN_ in a standard nutrient solution had a mean lpr value of ml _PROTEIN_ . data as exemplified in figure indicated that treatment of plants by the same solution but complemented with or mm nacl induced after h a reduction in lpr by and respectively . because of its marked effects on lpr treatment with mm nacl was chosen as a standard salt treatment for further studies . a similar osmotic _PROTEIN_ as induced by treatment with mm mannitol resulted in a similar reduction in lpr by . this suggests that hyperosmolarity rather than ion toxicity is responsible for early salt induced inhibition of lpr . the kinetic effects of salt exposure on lpr were characterized in closer detail . in control experiments we observed that transfer of intact plants into a different container but containing the same standard nutrient solution induced a significant fluctuation in lpr over time . in particular lpr was increased by from reference values after h and min of transfer . a similar fluctuation has been observed by citation and tentatively explained as a spontaneous diurnal variation of lpr . in our experiments a similar increase in lpr was reproduced at whatever time of day that plant transfer was performed . in contrast to control plants plants treated with mm nacl showed as early as min after treatment a significantly reduced lpr with respect to control plants . lpr was maximally inhibited after to h of treatment to to of values in control conditions . inhibition was _PROTEIN_ for to h of treatment . an exponential fit of these data from an average control value at initial time indicated a half time for inhibition of min . the responsiveness of plants to salt is controlled in part by the salt overly sensitive _PROTEIN_ pathway and its possible role in salt induced inhibition of lpr was investigated . mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene results in a fold increased sensitivity of roots to growth inhibition by salt . water transport measurements as exemplified in figure showed that wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited similar dose dependent inhibition of lpr with in both cases inhibition of lpr by salt concentrations between and mm . in addition treatment of _PROTEIN_ plants by mm nacl induced a _PROTEIN_ in lpr down to to of control values with min . because of the limited accuracy of determination we interpret these kinetic data to mean that the lpr response of _PROTEIN_ plants to salt was qualitatively similar to that of wild type plants . similar to wild type _PROTEIN_ plants also showed a marked inhibition of lpr by a mm mannitol treatment . sequence tags specific for each of the arabidopsis aquaporin genes were searched by multiple nucleotide sequence alignments and eventually refined by pairwise comparisons . all selected tags were mostly comprised in the untranslated transcribed region had a minimal length of bp and shared less than overall sequence identity with any other tag . to further reduce possible cross hybridization no conserved stretch greater than bp was admitted with the exception of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tags which shared identity over a bp sequence . using these criteria we were able to identify gene specific tags _PROTEIN_ corresponding to individual genes and three pairs of close homologs _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in which no marked divergence in sequence could be distinguished . _PROTEIN_ of the whole complement of aquaporin genes was followed by hybridizing macroarray _LOCATION_ carrying the _PROTEIN_ with a complex labeled probe prepared from root cdna . _PROTEIN_ for members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily and five members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily showed hybridization signals that were significantly above the background signal determined from negative control genes . although these signals can not be compared on a quantitative basis they point to certain genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as being highly _PROTEIN_ in roots . it is also noteworthy that some very close homologs of highly _PROTEIN_ genes showed very weak hybridization signals _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that reduced cross hybridization if any occurred between _PROTEIN_ . in the same experiments aquaporin _PROTEIN_ yielded weak nonsignificant hybridization signals suggesting that the corresponding genes were not or lowly _PROTEIN_ in roots . however using rt pcr it was possible to detect transcripts for four of these genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ level of aquaporin _METHOD_ in roots of d old arabidopsis plants grown in standard hydroponic culture conditions a.u. arbitrary units rt pcr no significant _PROTEIN_ signal was measured by macroarrays but _PROTEIN_ could be detected by rt pcr n.d. _PROTEIN_ was detectable neither by macroarrays nor by rt pcr . to test further the specificity of the macroarray signals we used an arabidopsis line with a t dna insertion within the _PROTEIN_ gene and therefore a completely disrupted _PROTEIN_ mrna transcription . accordingly the _PROTEIN_ signal was reduced to a basal level whereas the hybridization signals corresponding to the other _PROTEIN_ genes were not significantly altered . altogether these results establish that macroarrays carrying aquaporin _PROTEIN_ provide reproducible and specific signals for _PROTEIN_ profiling of individual _METHOD_ . we also showed that a minimum of aquaporin transcripts were present in roots of plants grown in standard hydroponic conditions . the kinetic variations of aquaporin transcript abundance in roots were studied over the first h following salt treatment with a special focus on early effects of salt until h of treatment . figure represents pooled data from three independent mm nacl treatments each being analyzed in two complete probe labeling and hybridization experiments . our analyses were also supported by the study of several control genes in parallel . the hybridization signal of the salt responsive _PROTEIN_ gene was around background at initial time points but rose to times background level after to h of treatment . in contrast the signals for _PROTEIN_ and circadian clock regulated _PROTEIN_ transcripts showed a steady _PROTEIN_ over time whereas _PROTEIN_ of elongation _PROTEIN_ was fairly stable throughout the treatment . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aquaporin genes was remarkably stable over the h following salt exposure with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which showed a punctual increase in hybridization signal at h by and respectively . by contrast a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in signal for the most prevalent aquaporin transcripts was observed between and h of treatment . signals were maximally reduced at h of treatment by _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for most of these genes _PROTEIN_ remained low until h of treatment whereas for a few others _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a tendency for increase in signal toward initial values was observed after h. by contrast most of the lowly _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a distinct pattern with a stable signal over the first h followed in some cases by a significant _PROTEIN_ at h . finally no significant change in hybridization signals for nip and small basic intrinsic protein genes was observed . to test further the specificity of salt dependent aquaporin gene regulation a set of independently chosen arabidopsis cdnas was taken as a supposedly invariable reference and used to normalize the kinetic data shown in figure . this procedure yielded results that were qualitatively similar to those from nonnormalized data indicating in particular a significant down regulation of all abundant aquaporin transcripts after h of salt treatment . it was also critical for the macroarray data to be validated by an independent technique . rna samples pooled from three independent salt treatments were analyzed by northern blots using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as probes . although slight discrepancies were observed at certain time points these analyses qualitatively reproduced the gene _PROTEIN_ patterns revealed by macroarrays . for instance a marked _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ hybridization signal was observed after to h of salt exposure whereas a peak in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was revealed at h of treatment . altogether these results indicate a well defined kinetic pattern of aquaporin gene _PROTEIN_ in roots exposed to salt treatment . in particular our study revealed that the highly _PROTEIN_ aquaporin genes showed coordinated reduction of _PROTEIN_ by salt consistent with the long term inhibition of lpr . the kinetics of aquaporin _PROTEIN_ in roots was also investigated using immunodetection methods . for this we used antibodies raised against peptides derived from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a radish _PROTEIN_ homolog . because of sequence conservation between aquaporin homologs these antibodies are predicted to cross react with several arabidopsis _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . immunoblot analyses of total root protein extracts revealed major bands at approximately _PROTEIN_ and kd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with detection of full length aquaporin peptides migrating as monomeric or dimeric _METHOD_ . to better resolve possible kinetic differences in abundance of aquaporins following exposure of roots to salinity the extracts were also analyzed by elisa tests . figure shows that the signal from the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody was significantly _PROTEIN_ by to as soon as min after salt exposure and then remained constant for up to h of treatment . in contrast the signal from the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody was not altered after up to h of treatment but a marked drop in intensity by was observed after h. similarly the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody yielded a signal that was fairly constant after exposure to salt with the exception of a h treatment where a slight but significant _PROTEIN_ by was observed . in conclusion the data show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aquaporins all exhibited a reduced abundance after h of salt exposure but there was no coordinated change in abundance of these three aquaporin classes in the early phase of the treatment . transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a green florescent protein _METHOD_ fused with either the n or the c terminus of representative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aquaporins were observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy . root cortical cells and apical cells of plants grown in standard hydroponic conditions revealed a consistent _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ on the pm that paralleled the pattern of a _METHOD_ low temperature inducible protein _PROTEIN_ fusion taken here as a reference marker for this _LOCATION_ . treatment of roots with mm nacl for min altered neither the intensity of emitted _METHOD_ nor the subcellular staining pattern of fusions between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however we observed after h of salt treatment in a restricted number of cells the appearance of intracellular structures containing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ homologs or _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . the localization in the tp of untreated control plants of fusions of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ was established from peripheral cell staining with intracellular invaginations that skirted the _LOCATION_ and by comparison to the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ used here as a reference marker of the tp . salt treatment of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants induced as early as min the labeling of small spherical intracellular bodies tentatively identified as double _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ invaginations . this labeling coexisted with labeling of adjacent tp regions that delimit the overall _LOCATION_ lumen . this pattern was consistently observed in salt treated plants and was never observed in untreated plants . bulb structures were initially described in expanding cotyledon and hypocotyl cells of arabidopsis plantlets but in the absence of any external stimulus . these structures were revealed by labeling with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion similar to the one used in this work . by contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not label the bulbs but only adjacent tp regions in salt treated arabidopsis roots . overall salt exposure had no quantitative or qualitative effect on the labeling pattern of these two tp fusion proteins . altogether these data show that salt treatment can induce although in a restricted number of cells the partial subcellular relocalization of aquaporins in the arabidopsis root . these effects were isoform specific in the case of _PROTEIN_ .
for determining the specificity of macroarray hybridizations we used arabidopsis plants that were either wild type or carried an agrobacterium tumefaciens transferred dna insertion within the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the effects of salt were characterized in wild type and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis . seedlings were cultured in vitro for d and further transplanted into hydroponic culture as previously described . briefly plantlets were mounted on cm polystyrene rafts floating in a basin with l of aerated culture solution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_

units superscript ii or units rt moloney murine leukemia virus in its running buffer in a total volume of . the rna template was then hydrolyzed in the presence of n naoh for min at . the mixture was then neutralized with n hcl m tris cl ph ethanol precipitated in the presence of mg sonicated fish sperm dna or purified on a sephacryl column . incorporation of dctp was determined by scintillation counting . after denaturation for min at in the presence of oligo the probe was used for hybridization at a final concentration of to cpm . _LOCATION_ were hybridized overnight at in a hybridization buffer _PROTEIN_ containing cdna complex probes labeled as described above . _LOCATION_ were then washed at successively for min in ssc _PROTEIN_ for min in ssc _PROTEIN_ and for min in ssc _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate the homogeneity of target dna spotting _LOCATION_ were subsequently hybridized to a labeled oligonucleotide probe _PROTEIN_ . this bp sequence located in the amplified vector linker is common to all target dna fragments . filters were hybridized at to in a solution containing ssc _PROTEIN_ denhardt and denatured sonicated fish sperm dna . after hybridization _LOCATION_ were washed as described above except that the last wash was at room temperature . _LOCATION_ were exposed to the imaging plate of a kodak storage phosphor screen gp or a fuji _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for varying periods . hybridization signals were captured using a storm phosphorimager with a resolution of . identification and quantification of the hybridization signals as well as the subtraction of local background values were carried out using imagemaster array . for each _LOCATION_ spot the signal intensity of hybridization to a complex probe was reported to the signal intensity of hybridization to the oligonucleotide probe yielding a normalized signal i icdna/ioligo . background signal was calculated as the mean signal from all negative control genes . a hybridization signal was considered as significantly over background for i > ineg sd . for each individual kinetic experiment manipulations corresponding to all time points _LOCATION_ were run in parallel . this provided a high reproducibility between independent _LOCATION_ for a given time point and high consistency between distinct time points . we also used a set of independently chosen arabidopsis cdnas as a supposedly invariable reference for comparison of data between time points . in practice a correction _PROTEIN_ between two time points was deduced from a linear regression on a log log representation of hybridization signals of the reference cdnas in the two time points . for comparison of two independent kinetic experiments we determined a normalization _PROTEIN_ based on comparison of initial time points of the two experiments . this _PROTEIN_ was deduced from a linear regression on a log log representation of hybridization signals of all aquaporins in the two initial time points . the _PROTEIN_ was then converted for a linear representation of data and used to normalize all time points of the same kinetic experiment . roots were harvested from arabidopsis plants grown in a nutrient solution as indicated and ground in liquid nitrogen . the resulting powder was incubated with ml of trichloroacetic acid mercaptoethanol in acetone for min at and centrifuged at for min at . the pellet was washed twice with acetone mercaptoethanol and resuspended in ml/mg fw of a lysis buffer . after min under agitation the extract was centrifuged for min at and the supernatant containing total proteins recovered . protein concentrations were measured using a modified bradford procedure . antibodies were raised in rabbit against a amino acid n terminal peptide of _PROTEIN_ a amino acid c terminal peptide of _PROTEIN_ or a amino acid c terminal peptide of a radish _PROTEIN_ homolog . western blotting was performed as described . for elisa assays serial fold dilutions in a _PROTEIN_ buffer of of total protein extracts were loaded in duplicate on immunoplates . after overnight incubation at the plates were rinsed once with phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ and incubated for h with _PROTEIN_ tb _PROTEIN_ at . the plates were then rinsed three times with _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ and incubated with a dilution of a primary antiaquaporin antibody . after h at the plates were washed five times with _PROTEIN_ t and further incubated for h at in the presence of a dilution of a secondary peroxidase coupled anti rabbit antibody . after five washes in _PROTEIN_ a peroxidase reaction was initiated by addition of mm diammonium azino bis ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonate m citric acid ph . a linear regression between the absorbance signal as read with a multiplate reader and the amount of total proteins was obtained for each sample and used for relative comparison between samples . all constructs were made using gateway cloning technology according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the cdnas of all arabidopsis aquaporins were pcr amplified with primers allowing the addition of attb recombination sites and cloned into a pdonr vector using a gateway _PROTEIN_ clonase enzyme mix . the cdnas were then transferred into the binary destination vectors and by using a gateway lr clonase enzyme mix . the and vectors allow fusion of _METHOD_ with the aquaporin c terminus _METHOD_ or n terminus _METHOD_ respectively and _PROTEIN_ of the resulting cdna is placed under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and of the untranslated transcribed region of a nos gene . all constructs were checked by dna sequencing _PROTEIN_ . a. tumefaciens strain was transformed with the pgwb constructs selected for rifampicin and kanamycin resistance and used for transformation of arabidopsis col by the floral dip method . to select for transformed plants seeds were surface sterilized and germinated on cleared polystyrene culture boxes containing a half strength murashige and skoog medium complemented with g agar mg hygromycin ph in a controlled environment at under h of light/d . after to d hygromycin resistant seedlings were transplanted into potting soil and grown to maturity . plants containing the following constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were obtained using the procedure in this work . transgenics plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were those described by citation . transgenic arabidopsis plantlets grown on half strength murashige and skoog medium without any antibiotic selection were screened for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using an olympus microscope equipped with an _METHOD_ condenser and a fluorescein isothiocyanate/enhanced _METHOD_ filter set . observations of transgenic root cells treated or not with salt were conducted on hydroponically grown plants with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope . the argon laser excitation wavelength was nm _METHOD_ emission was detected with the filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate _PROTEIN_ . plants were transferred into a nutrient solution complemented or not by mm nacl and the _METHOD_ signal was examined after or min of treatment on a sample of root tissue under a glass coverslip . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion or a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as references for _METHOD_ signal localization in the pm and tp respectively . depending on treatments and genotypes the number of individual plants analyzed was between and . sequence data from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under accession numbers as described by citation
