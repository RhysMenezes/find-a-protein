arabidopsis plants possess a family of nine gene homologues of the yeast autophagy associated gene . to gain insight into how these genes function in plants first the _PROTEIN_ patterns of five homologues were analysed in young arabidopsis plants grown under favourable growth conditions or following exposure to prolonged darkness or sugar starvation . promoters plus the entire coding regions of the genes were fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and transformed into arabidopsis plants . in all plants grown under favourable growth conditions _PROTEIN_ staining was much more significant in roots than in shoots . different genes showed distinct spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns in roots . in some transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ staining in leaves was induced by prolonged darkness or sugar starvation . next arabidopsis plants were transformed with chimeric gene encoding _PROTEIN_ protein fused to n terminal green _METHOD_ protein and c terminal haemagglutinin epitope tags . analysis of these plants showed that under favourable growth conditions the _PROTEIN_ protein is efficiently processed and is localized to autophagosome resembling structures both in the _LOCATION_ and in the central _LOCATION_ in a similar manner to its processing and localization under starvation stresses . moreover treatment with a cocktail of proteasome inhibitors did not prevent the turnover of this protein implying that its turnover takes place in the _LOCATION_ as occurs in yeasts . the results suggest that in plants the cellular processes involving the genes function efficiently in young non senescing tissues both under favourable growth conditions and under starvation stresses .
by contrast to the single autophagy related gene in yeast arabidopsis plants possess nine homologues suggesting multiple functions of gene members . moreover the nine arabidopsis proteins although relatively highly conserved exhibit distinct differences in the sequence of amino acids . as shown in the evolutionary tree the nine arabidopsis _METHOD_ can be divided into three distinct subgroups according to their amino acid sequence similarities . the first subgroup includes four proteins the second three proteins _PROTEIN_ and the third two proteins . to elucidate the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the various arabidopsis genes in young non senescing tissues five representatives were selected out of the nine members _PROTEIN_ . the promoters _PROTEIN_ plus the entire coding regions of these genes were fused in frame with the reporter gus gene and the various chimeric genes were introduced into arabidopsis plants . independently transformed lines _PROTEIN_ a given isoform showed comparable gus staining patterns and therefore photographs derived from different lines of each genotype are presented . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the five different gus constructs were grown under favourable growth conditions and young seedlings were stained for gus . in these young seedlings gus staining generally appeared preferentially in the roots as depicted by the line _PROTEIN_ the gus construct . yet a lower level of gus staining also appeared in the shoots this staining could be enhanced upon longer incubation of the gus staining . gus fusions of some of the different genes yielded different spatial gus staining patterns particularly along the distal region of the roots . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ gus construct generated significant gus staining in the vascular tissue of the maturation zone as well as in the root cap but only trace staining in the root meristem and root elongation zone . the gus and gus constructs generated similar staining patterns to _PROTEIN_ gus but gus was more abundant in the maturation zone . the gus construct produced significant gus staining in the elongation and maturation zones but only trace staining in the root cap or in the apical meristem . the gus construct generated gus staining along the entire root but exhibited a higher intensity adjacent to the elongation zone the apical meristem and the root cap . however the gus staining in the distal root regions of the gus _PROTEIN_ plants appeared more intense and with a different pattern compared with the staining in plants _PROTEIN_ the other gus genes . cross sectioning of the highly stained root region in plants _PROTEIN_ gus revealed that staining was confined to the outer cell layers . the yeast gene is known to be involved in starvation induced autophagy and a similar function has been indirectly attributed to this gene family in plants . since gus staining suggested that the genes are weakly _PROTEIN_ in shoots a test was done to find out if the _PROTEIN_ of any of the five selected gus genes was stimulated by prolonged exposure to darkness which inhibits photosynthesis causing sucrose starvation . gus staining in two out of the five constructs was extensively stimulated by this treatment while the other three constructs showed a significantly lower response . also tested was the response of the five gus constructs to direct sugar starvation . arabidopsis seedlings were transferred to complete liquid medium for d after which they were transferred to a new medium either complete or lacking sucrose for an additional d. as shown in fig . gus staining of and was also extensively induced upon exposure to sugar starvation compared with the control while the other constructs showed a significantly lower response . these experiments can not show however if the stimulated gus staining after dark treatment or sugar starvation is due to increased synthesis or to _PROTEIN_ turnover of either the mrna or proteins encoded by the gus constructs . the operation of proteins in stress associated autophagy in yeast and mammals generally requires a processing step that removes a c terminal portion from these proteins and enables their lipidation into _LOCATION_ and the formation of autophagosomes . the fate of the proteins following the delivery and subsequent degradation of the autophagosomes in the _LOCATION_ is still unknown . these proteins may either penetrate together with the autophagosomes into the _LOCATION_ and be degraded inside the organelle or stick to the outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and then be removed from the outside _LOCATION_ by an unknown processing event that may use _PROTEIN_ . to find out if the proteins follow similar processing events in young non senescing plants grown under favourable growth conditions the coding sequence of was fused to _METHOD_ at its n terminus and to an ha epitope tag at its c terminus . this chimeric construct was fused to the promoter and transformed into arabidopsis plants . independently transformed lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha generally showed very similar polypeptide patterns and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and therefore will be presented in the following examples derived from different independently transformed lines . the processing of the _METHOD_ ha polypeptide was studied by germinating the seeds under favourable growth conditions for increasing time periods and analysing proteins in western blots with either anti ha or anti _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in fig . panel a the anti ha antibodies recognized the full length _METHOD_ ha which was not detected in mature seeds . this full length protein was first detected d after the initiation of germination and its intensity was progressively reduced from to d after the initiation of germination . the _METHOD_ antibodies recognized only a faint band of the full length _METHOD_ ha as well as two additional smaller polypeptide bands not detected by the anti ha antibodies . the upper band of these two smaller polypeptides corresponded in size to the expected c terminal processed implying that the protein was processed in its c terminus similar to the processing of its yeast and mammalian counterparts . the size of the lower band corresponded approximately to the size of the _METHOD_ domain alone implying further processing of the protein . as antibodies against the proteins were not available it was not possible to distinguish whether the appearance of this smaller band corresponding to _METHOD_ alone represents a cleavage of the domain from the _METHOD_ domain or that it represents a complete degradation of the domain . yet it is believed that the appearance of the smaller band signifies the degradation of the protein leaving the relatively stable _METHOD_ protein quite intact . notably only the full length _METHOD_ ha band and that corresponding to the c terminal processed _METHOD_ ha protein were clearly detected d after the initiation of germination while the lower band corresponding in size to the _METHOD_ domain alone was detected only d after the initiation of germination . this implies that processing of the c terminal region precedes the second processing step of the polypeptide during seed germination . in addition the intensity of the c terminal processed _METHOD_ ha band was progressively reduced while that of the _METHOD_ band was progressively increased with the progression of seed germination implying that the c terminal processed form but not the full length _METHOD_ ha is converted into the _METHOD_ domain alone . the band corresponding to the _METHOD_ protein was also detected in mature seeds implying that proteins are also synthesized and processed during seed development . tests were also carried out to see if germination in the dark would affect the timing of appearance of the various protein bands associated with _METHOD_ ha . similar to germination in the light upon germination in the dark the full length _METHOD_ ha as well as its c terminal processed intermediate _METHOD_ first appeared at around d after the initiation of germination and then gradually reduced as the germination progressed . by contrast upon germination in the dark the _METHOD_ domain started accumulating alone d after the initiation of germination significantly before its appearance in seeds germinated in the light . since the _METHOD_ ha construct was driven by the constitutive promoter it was possible to use the _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants to test whether the machinery needed for the two processing events of the proteins is active in both roots and shoots . to address this d old seedlings grown under favourable growth conditions were separated into roots and shoots and proteins were reacted with the anti _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in fig . the c terminal processed form of _METHOD_ ha as well as the _METHOD_ domain alone was detected in both roots and shoots implying that the _METHOD_ ha was processed in a similar manner both in roots and shoots . although the function of the proteins is generally associated with stress their abundant _PROTEIN_ particularly in roots of young non senescing plants grown under favourable growth conditions prompted tests to find out if the proteins are also associated with structures resembling autophagosomes under favourable growth conditions . this was analysed by in planta _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . individual plants of a given line showed variable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which varied from no _METHOD_ to intense _METHOD_ . moreover despite the _PROTEIN_ that the _METHOD_ ha was produced at comparable levels in roots and shoots _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was mostly detected in roots . also in some cases _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed only in some _PROTEIN_ roots but not in others of the same plant while in others as demonstrated in fig . and b it was detected in the entire root . the same kind of variable _METHOD_ was also detected upon exposure to starvation stresses indicating that it was not related to stress conditions . the reason for this variable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern is not clear but comparing the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data with those obtained from the western blots suggests that the variable _METHOD_ may be related to the _METHOD_ itself and not to its attached polypeptides . it is possible that the apparent second processing step of the may in some cases trim portions from the n terminus of the _METHOD_ which is essential for its activity . indeed in some experiments the _METHOD_ related band migrated slightly more rapidly than the intact _METHOD_ . therefore in the following only higher magnifications derived from root sections that showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ will be considered . higher magnification analyses of root tip cells showed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is mostly associated with autophagosome resembling spots which are most abundant in the cytoplasm surrounding the central _LOCATION_ . such structures were not observed in roots of control plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ polypeptide alone implying that they were specific to the polypeptide . similar appearance of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in autophagosome resembling spots located mostly in the _LOCATION_ surrounding the central _LOCATION_ was also observed in larger epidermal cells above the root tips which contain large central _LOCATION_ occupying most of the cell volume . although not clearly seen in fig . some _METHOD_ fluorescing spots were also detected inside the central _LOCATION_ of these large epidermal cells . in some experiments involving plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared more dispersed in the _LOCATION_ and apparently localized to much smaller spots than those shown in fig . . whether this reflects biological variation or technical variation associated with the preparation of the plants for analysis in the confocal microscope is not known . since in yeast the proteins deliver autophagosome into the _LOCATION_ it was of interest to verify further whether the very weak _METHOD_ _METHOD_ inside the central _LOCATION_ was due to the acidic ph of the _LOCATION_ that may interfere with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to address these issues root cells of the _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ plants were incubated for h with concanamycin a which inhibits the activities of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and hence slows down the acidification of the _LOCATION_ sap . as shown in fig . concanamycin a treatment caused a general enhancement of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells above the root tips _METHOD_ . moreover following the concanamycin a treatment a large number of fluorescing spots was also present inside the _LOCATION_ . a similar concanamycin a treatment did not cause any significant internalization of a control _METHOD_ polypeptide into the _LOCATION_ implying that the containing structures are specifically and efficiently internalized into the central _LOCATION_ in root cells of plants grown under favourable growth conditions . notably the control _METHOD_ polypeptide but not _METHOD_ ha was also localized to the _LOCATION_ . in a few concanamycin a treated root sections of plants _PROTEIN_ the control _METHOD_ polypeptide a few cells appeared in which a low amount of _METHOD_ was also present in the _LOCATION_ . yet no _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ in other cells near them in the same section . in addition the intensity of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of these cells was significantly lower then that in root cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ polypeptide . the reason for this is not yet clear . concanamycin a had no effect on the steady state levels of the processing products of the _METHOD_ ha polypeptides as determined in western blots with anti _METHOD_ and anti ha antibodies implying that the concanamycin a effect was largely due to increased _LOCATION_ ph rather then the stability of the _METHOD_ ha polypeptides . since the proteins were efficiently processed and transported to _LOCATION_ under favourable growth conditions it was of interest to determine whether the proteasome machinery is involved in the processing of the protein particularly the removal of the protein leaving the _METHOD_ alone band shown in figs and . to address this d old seedlings of the _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ plants grown under favourable conditions were treated with a cocktail of proteasome inhibitors for h and proteins were reacted in a western blot with the anti _METHOD_ antibodies . this cocktail affected neither the pattern nor the actual levels of the various _METHOD_ ha associated polypeptides .
the promoters plus the entire coding regions of five genes were extracted from arabidopsis genomic dna by polymerase chain reaction using primers whose sequences are given in table . the end primers were designed so that the endogenous stop codons were abolished and replaced by a smai restriction enzyme site and the end primers included a sali or xbai restriction enzyme site for further manipulation . the pcr fragments were then inserted into the ti plasmid using smai and sali/xbai enzymes . the gus coding region was amplified out of the ti plasmid using the appropriate and end primers that added smai and kpni restriction enzymes sites into the and ends respectively . constructs were cut with smai and kpni and the gus fragment was inserted downstream to the coding region to generate the gus chimera . the chimeric _METHOD_ ha gene was constructed as follows . the full length coding sequence of the lacking its initiator _PROTEIN_ and stop codons was first amplified with primers shown in table . the pcr product was then subcloned into another cassette of a ti plasmid to generate a chimeric gene containing a single open reading frame which included fused _METHOD_ ha from its to its end connected to an upstream promoter and downstream ocs terminator . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was transformed with each of the gus and _METHOD_ ha plasmids and then used to transform arabidopsis thaliana plants as previously described . kanamycin resistant plants were selected and selfed to obtain plants homozygous for the transgenes . wild type and transgenic seeds of arabidopsis were surface sterilized in bleach and selected on solid nitsch medium containing of kanamycin and incubated for d at . the plates were then incubated in a growth chamber under a regime of h h dark cycle at . all media were _PROTEIN_ from duchefa . for the dark treatment week old seedlings were exposed to darkness for d. for the starvation treatment d old seedlings were transferred to gamborg liquid medium supplemented with sucrose for d then washed with deionized water and transfered to a gamborg medium lacking sucrose for an additional d. different plant organs were collected and submerged for h in the following staining solution mm ph mm ferricyanide mm ferrocyanide dimethyl sulphoxide _METHOD_ triton x and mg final concentration of bromo chloro indolyl _PROTEIN_ dissolved in dimethyl formamide . plants were washed once in water and destained twice in ethanol and observed in the light microscope . roots of d old arabidopsis plants transformed with _METHOD_ ha construct grown on solid nitsch medium with kanamycin were cut and incubated in liquid nitsch medium containing concanamycin a for h at under agitation at rpm . after the treatment the roots were washed in water and observed in a confocal microscope . concanamycin a was prepared as a stock solution in absolute _METHOD_ . for the control roots were incubated in liquid nitsch medium containing an equal amount of _METHOD_ as in the treatment . the treatment was carried out as described previously . briefly d old plants grown on solid nitsch medium with kanamycin were covered with deionized water containing a cocktail of proteasome inhibitors and incubated for h at . proteasome inhibitors were diluted in absolute _METHOD_ and each used at a final concentration of . for a control the plants were covered with water containing an equal amount of _METHOD_ as in the treatments . after the treatments the plants were harvested immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at before protein extraction . protein extraction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analyses were performed as previously described . monoclonal anti haemagglutinin and anti _METHOD_ antibodies were _PROTEIN_ from sigma . for light and _METHOD_ imaging an olympus microscope with a df plfl lens equipped with a _METHOD_ filter and an olympus u digital camera was used . images were processed with olympus dp controller software and adobe photoshop me software . to obtain confocal and differential interference contrast images an olympus ix microscope with a uplapo na lens equipped with laser scanning fluoview confocal unit nm argon laser and a _METHOD_ filter was used . images were processed with fluoview software and adobe photoshop me software .
