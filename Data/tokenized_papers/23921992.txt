brassinosteroids activate the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ receptor complex which leads to a wide range of changes in gene _PROTEIN_ plant growth and development . as an initial step to elucidate additional roles of _PROTEIN_ we cloned a _PROTEIN_ binding protein _PROTEIN_ associating receptor like kinase and characterized its gene _PROTEIN_ and root phenotypes . is a putative _LOCATION_ lrr _PROTEIN_ protein that specifically binds to _PROTEIN_ and its homologs . careful examination of _PROTEIN_ using transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter under the control of the native promoter _METHOD_ revealed that this gene is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in most plant tissues and shows especially strong _PROTEIN_ in the xylem vasculature of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots as well as in mature pollen . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of the gene was increased in the br biosynthetic loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ and a loss of function mutant of br signaling _PROTEIN_ . in contrast this gene was down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ plant which is a br signal gain of function mutant . overexpressing transgenic plants clearly enhanced primary root growth in a dose dependent manner and their roots were hypersensitive to br induced root growth inhibition . in addition both the number and density of _PROTEIN_ roots were dramatically increased in the transgenic plants in a dose dependent manner . together with observations that arf _PROTEIN_ genes are up regulated in the overexpressor we suggest that the overexpressor phenotype with more _PROTEIN_ roots is partly due to the increased _PROTEIN_ of arf genes in this genetic background . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ interacting protein may be involved in br mediated plant growth and development such as in _PROTEIN_ roots via auxin regulation .
to elucidate additional roles of _PROTEIN_ in plant growth and development we screened an arabidopsis cdna library to identify potential _PROTEIN_ binding proteins using the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain _PROTEIN_ as bait in a yeast two hybrid assay . among the positive clones pulled out there were nine overlapping cdna clones encoding an lrr _PROTEIN_ protein kinase _PROTEIN_ and we named it _PROTEIN_ associating receptor like kinase . after yeast two hybrid analyses of the binding of to other known br signaling components such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we found that interacts specifically with _PROTEIN_ and its known homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the specific interaction of with _PROTEIN_ was also confirmed in tobacco leaves by showing that transient co _PROTEIN_ of the n terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ and the c terminal _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in the epidermal cell _LOCATION_ . in contrast negative control pairs such as _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gave no _METHOD_ signal whereas the positive control pair _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed a similar _METHOD_ signal . genomic dna is composed of two exons and one intron and it encodes a protein composed of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda and a pi of . the deduced protein sequence of shows a typical structure of an lrr _PROTEIN_ protein kinase it has a long stretch of _LOCATION_ domain connected to a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain in order . the _LOCATION_ domain contains a signal peptide at the n terminus seven lrrs four plant specific lrr profiles and a glycine rich region . an active protein kinase _PROTEIN_ binding region signature and a serine/threonine protein kinase active site signature at the cytoplasmic domain predict that is an active serine/threonine kinase . database searches revealed that three lrr _PROTEIN_ proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are most similar to the in arabidopsis and they show and identity to the full length sequence of respectively . the cytoplasmic kinase domain _METHOD_ to be more conserved than the _LOCATION_ domain so that their identity at the c terminal kinase domain exceeds . it has been reported that and the three blk proteins belong to a small group of lrr protein kinases _PROTEIN_ lrr ix and they form a monophyletic gene family with _PROTEIN_ as an _PROTEIN_ . we compared the domain/motif structure of _PROTEIN_ and its known binding proteins and found that not only _PROTEIN_ but also most _PROTEIN_ binding proteins share domains and motifs similar to a typical _PROTEIN_ except that _PROTEIN_ apparently lacks the transmembrane domain and _PROTEIN_ does not carry both the transmembrane and kinase domains . nonetheless _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ associated proteins and inferred cladistic relationships among protein sequences obtained from species . we found that a group of dicots monocots lycopodiophyta and bryophyta formed a monophyletic group with statistical support . the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii has an outgroup relationship with this monophyletic group . this monophyletic group was divided into two clades the first clade covering dicots and monocots and the second clade covering lycopodiophyta and bryophyta . we confirmed that the two clades have a sister group relationship with each other . within the first clade there are two subclades which are strongly supported by statistics . the first subgroup is a group of dicots that have > sequence similarity to . the second subgroup was a mixed group of dicots and monocots that have < sequence similarity . based on this cladistic analysis we concluded that the gene family evolved before the separation of dicots and monocots . as an initial step to understanding mediated plant development we examined the general _PROTEIN_ pattern of the gene in diverse plant tissues by performing semi quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis . was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined with relatively high _PROTEIN_ in the stem and roots . to clarify the detailed tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the gene we have generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ reporter under the control of the native promoter _METHOD_ and examined its _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots and anthers . was moderately _PROTEIN_ in floral buds and flowers . the _PROTEIN_ mediated br signaling pathway controls male sterility by regulating the _PROTEIN_ of key genes involved in anther and pollen development . thus br related deficient or insensitive mutants are defective in the production of microspore mother cells microspores and pollen as well as in pollen release after anther dehiscence . we found that the gene was also highly _PROTEIN_ in mature anther especially in pollen grains but weakly _PROTEIN_ in filament and was not _PROTEIN_ in other maternal tissues such as tapetum and the outer wall layers . this _PROTEIN_ pattern is partly consistent with our bioinformatic analysis performed using the plantpan database which predicts that transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in floral determination and development bind to the promoter region of . these observations imply that may be specifically involved in microspore and pollen development . roots are a major source of brs and thus these steroid hormones may play important roles in root growth and development . we found that was _PROTEIN_ in the periclinally dividing pericycle cells of lrs which implies that may contribute to lr initiation at an early stage . was then redundantly _PROTEIN_ longitudinally from the meristematic zone to differentiating cells of the emerging and elongating lrs . in _METHOD_ of radial pattern it was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ across the tissue layers from the epidermis to the vascular cells . interestingly _PROTEIN_ disappeared in the meristematic zone of older roots and was restricted to the stele tissues of the differentiation zone including the protoxylem xylem and pericycle cells but was excluded from the phloem cells . this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are specifically _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues and drive vascular differentiation and growth in arabidopsis . the similar restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern of in the stele tissues was also found in the primary roots as early as d after germination . we are not certain at this point whether the gene had been _PROTEIN_ in all root tissues before d post germination as seen in the case of the early lrs . it has been reported that br biosynthesis and its signaling pathways are jointly controlled by a _PROTEIN_ mediated negative feedback regulation on br biosynthetic genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ br homeostasis and growth responses . we then addressed the question of whether the component of the br signal transduction pathway influences the _PROTEIN_ of to evaluate br responsive regulation of gene function . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of the gene was increased in the br biosynthetic loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ and a loss of function mutant of br signaling _PROTEIN_ . in contrast this gene was down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ plant which is a br signal gain of function mutant . it is probable that as noted by citation the _PROTEIN_ of the gene is coordinately regulated by the strength of br signaling pathways . that is low or moderate br signaling induces up regulation of the gene and very strong signaling down regulates the gene by a negative feedback control . indeed a treatment with exogenous br initially increased gene _PROTEIN_ but down regulated it after a prolonged treatment with bl . notably br induced and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ showed a typical oscillating pattern in which gene _PROTEIN_ fluctuated in a timely manner . the first peak was observed at min _PROTEIN_ or min after epi bl treatment followed by a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . however there was a second peak of _PROTEIN_ at min after epi bl treatment . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ started to increase min after epi bl treatment and remained at a relatively high level until min after treatment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reached a high peak at min after the br treatment and then rapidly _PROTEIN_ . other plant hormones also showed hormone specific regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ . as described epi bl increased gene _PROTEIN_ > fold in a time dependent oscillation manner . d showed a similar induction effect on gene _PROTEIN_ but its stimulation was < fold . in contrast treatment with exogenous aba gibberellic acid _PROTEIN_ or cytokinin steadily _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of immediately after the initial slight increase . these results imply that gene _PROTEIN_ and probably its functions are differentially regulated by hormones and brs and auxins work together in a positively coordinate manner while aba gibberellin and cytokinins are antagonizing agents . to evaluate the possible involvement of in br responsive plant growth and development we generated transgenic plants ectopically _PROTEIN_ fused to the n terminal region of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and investigated their root phenotypes . based on western blot analysis performed using anti _METHOD_ antibodies we determined that and lines overexpressed fused transgenic proteins ranging from moderate to high levels compared with the columbia control . there were no strikingly different aerial phenotypes of light grown overexpressor plants compared with the col plants except that transgenic plants were slightly larger . for dark grown plants their hypocotyls were longer . brassinazole a br biosynthesis inhibitor inhibited growth of hypocotyls in arabidopsis and this retarded growth was recovered by treatment with exogenous brs . transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more sensitive to br compared with the wild type and both show resistance against brz treatment . we found that transgenic plants overexpressing showed no significant difference in the brz induced inhibition of hypocotyl growth compared with the col wild type . this result implies that the longer hypocotyl phenotype may not be due to the overexpression of the protein and its involvement in the br signaling pathway downstream of br perception . in contrast to the hypocotyl phenotype different levels of overexpression clearly enhanced primary root growth in a dose dependent manner . a > increase in root growth was observed in the line while about statistically insignificant root growth was observed in the line which _PROTEIN_ the transgenic protein at a relatively low level . brs regulate root growth in a concentration dependent manner they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations . our root growth inhibition assay showed that growing columbia plants in a medium containing m epi bl increased the length of primary roots by . as expected there was a gradual inhibition of root growth for plants grown in a medium containing > m epi bl in a concentration dependent manner . notably for transgenic plants this root growth inhibition can be seen already in plants grown in medium with m epi bl . our results indicate that overexpression of renders the roots of plants more sensitive to br inhibition . in this report we revealed that the promoter activity of the _METHOD_ transgenic plants was high during lr formation especially in xylem and pericycle cells . consistent with this _PROTEIN_ pattern both the number and density of lrs were dramatically increased in transgenic plants in a dose dependent manner . for example the line had > fold more lrs compared with the col plants and their density along the primary root was also more than four times higher . these results indicate that may be involved in the growth and development of lrs . the establishment of the auxin response maximum by _PROTEIN_ roots a regulator of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carriers is a major trigger of lr initiation and development . it is well known that downstream components of the auxin signaling pathway such as aux/iaa and arfs are actively involved in the control of this root development . therefore we examined whether the br and regulated lr phenotype is accompanied by a transcriptional modulation of any aux/iaa and arf genes . as expected from fig . and c was highly up regulated by the br treatment . at the same time the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was greatly _PROTEIN_ while that of _PROTEIN_ a module partner in the regulation of lr initiation was dramatically increased by > fold by treatment with m exogenous bl . a similar but far less extensive regulation was observed in gene _PROTEIN_ of the lr controlling modular proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among other arf proteins involved in the regulation of lr development _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes was moderately increased to fold compared with the mock control while that of the _PROTEIN_ gene was not significantly changed or slightly _PROTEIN_ by the bl treatment . interestingly the overexpressor showed a similar up regulated _PROTEIN_ pattern of arf genes ranging from to times . in this transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also enhanced . it was previously shown that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased the number of lrs . in contrast the loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ showed a _PROTEIN_ number of lrs . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ null mutant exhibited a dramatically _PROTEIN_ number of lrs and its defective lr phenotype was rescued by the introduction of their direct transcriptional downstream targets such as _PROTEIN_ organ _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . based on these reports we suggest that the overexpressor phenotype with enhanced lr number is partly due to the increased _PROTEIN_ of arf genes in this genetic background . unfortunately we were not able to confirm opposite root phenotypes in knock out plants as we have failed to isolate homozygous progeny from several lines of t dna tagged heterozygote plants . it will be of value in the future to clarify the molecular _METHOD_ that block the production of the homozygous knock out plants .
