in a previous study on arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells transiently infected with the microtubule end binding protein _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ we reported that interphase microtubules grow from multiple sites dispersed over the cortex with plus ends forming the characteristic comet like pattern . in this study _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used to study the transitions of microtubule arrays throughout the division cycle of cells lacking a defined centrosome . during division the dispersed origin of microtubules was replaced by a more focused pattern with the plus end comets growing away from sites associated with the _LOCATION_ periphery . the mitotic spindle then evolved in two quite distinct ways depending on the presence or absence of the preprophase band _PROTEIN_ the cells displaying outside in as well as inside out mitotic pathways . in those cells possessing a _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein labeled material at the _LOCATION_ periphery that segregated into two _PROTEIN_ caps perpendicular to the _PROTEIN_ before _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown . these _PROTEIN_ caps then marked the spindle poles upon nebd . however in the population of cells without _PROTEIN_ there was no prepolarization of material at the _LOCATION_ envelope before nebd and the bipolar spindle only emerged clearly after nebd . such cells had variable spindle orientations and enhanced phragmoplast mobility suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ is involved in a _PROTEIN_ event that promotes early spindle pole morphogenesis and subsequent positional stability during division . astral like microtubules are not usually prominent in plant cells but they are clearly seen in these arabidopsis cells and we hypothesize that they may be involved in orienting the division plane particularly where the plane is not determined before division .
time lapse microscopy was used to follow the direction of plus end comet growth and the general staining pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ around the cell cycle . a brief overview of the changing patterns of _METHOD_ is presented before focusing on phases of particular interest . as previously shown during interphase plus end comets arose at multiple dispersed sites around the cortex but with the onset of division the _LOCATION_ periphery became a prominent site for microtubule outgrowth . plus end comets were observed to grow out from the perinuclear region toward the cell cortex to form a radial array in contrast with the interphase array in which the microtubule ends are dispersed over the cortex . prophase cells were also readily distinguishable from interphase cells by accumulations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ around the periphery of their _LOCATION_ envelopes . metaphase spindles were characterized by general labeling of the microtubules with heavy concentrations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at their spindle poles . double labeling with antitubulin confirmed that the _METHOD_ signal was concentrated at the spindle poles forming annular structures in favorably presented spindles . time lapse movies showed that the dynamic ends of spindle microtubules were distal to these accumulations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at spindle poles . during telophase and cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in two _PROTEIN_ locations around the daughter _LOCATION_ and in the midzone of the phragmoplast . the relationship of these locations to microtubules was confirmed by double labeling fixed cells with antitubulin antibodies . time lapse movies established that plus end comets grow away from the opposing faces of the daughter _LOCATION_ during telophase and cytokinesis . this places the plus ends of microtubules at the midline of the phragmoplast distal to the forming _LOCATION_ surfaces in agreement with the hook decoration studies of citation . in favorably presented cells the comets appeared to originate from foci of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ periphery multiple comets emerged from a single focus . these foci were also highly dynamic capable of circumferential and radial movement at the _LOCATION_ periphery concomitant with the microtubule polymerization events . in some cases the foci exhibited a reduced intensity of _METHOD_ or disappeared after the emergence of the comets . time lapse movies of anaphase and cytokinesis also showed that the plus end comets contribute to the midline location of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the phragmoplast . supplemental movie online demonstrates that this labeling arose from the plus end comets of microtubules that grew from the opposing faces of the daughter _LOCATION_ meeting at the midline . in actively expanding cells this midline labeling was limited to the leading edge of the phragmoplast resulting in a _PROTEIN_ shaped labeling pattern during symmetrical growth of the phragmoplast however less regular patterns were formed during _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of phragmoplast growth . no evidence was found for the contrary outgrowth of microtubules from the phragmoplast midline toward the daughter _LOCATION_ . these data therefore indicate that the plus ends of growing microtubules are orientated toward the midzone of the phragmoplast . by observing microtubule arrays in dividing arabidopsis cells we were able to identify a subpopulation of cells that divided without a _PROTEIN_ . despite the absence of the predictive band of microtubules the accumulation of label around the _LOCATION_ envelope marked these cells as premitotic and allowed them to be followed as they entered mitosis . time lapse studies revealed that there were two pathways for spindle pole development depending on whether a _PROTEIN_ was present or not . in this cell line of cells in prophase did not have a _PROTEIN_ even after the images were contrast stretched using an inverted grayscale image to visualize the cortex more clearly . all images presented in subsequent parts of the study were taken from cells that were tracked successfully through division . in cells without a _PROTEIN_ the premitotic _LOCATION_ was associated with radial microtubule arrays . an important characteristic of mitosis in such cells was that spindle bipolarity always developed during prometaphase after _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown . this is exemplified in figures to where it can be seen that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became diffusely distributed in the vicinity of the condensed chromosomes upon nebd . spindle bipolarity was then _PROTEIN_ during prometaphase with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ becoming concentrated at the spindle poles by metaphase/anaphase . these data therefore show that cells proceeding into cell division without a _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit distinct bipolar staining patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ until the bipolar axis of the spindle had been established after nebd . by contrast in those cells that did display a _PROTEIN_ spindle bipolarity was established much earlier at preprophase/prophase . in these cases spindle poles developed from sites at opposite sides of the premitotic _LOCATION_ so that the interpolar axis was perpendicular to the _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ arrangement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at prophase differed significantly from the nonpolarized form seen in cells without a _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ caps of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coexisted with the _PROTEIN_ suggested that the _LOCATION_ envelope was still intact during spindle morphogenesis . this was confirmed in arabidopsis suspension cells _PROTEIN_ hdel yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and immunostained with antitubulin antibodies . this showed that the _LOCATION_ envelope was intact when the _PROTEIN_ was present indicating that the development of spindle bipolarity is flexible in that it can occur both before and after nebd . in addition to differences in spindle pole development we also found that the orientations of spindles were different in the two subpopulations of cells . in all of the seven cells with a _PROTEIN_ that were tracked through division the spindle formed in a predictable orientation perpendicular to the long axis of the cell . this differed significantly to mitosis in the absence of a _PROTEIN_ in which the premitotic _LOCATION_ was asymmetrically disposed and the equatorial plane of the spindle was variable . of the prophase cells observed by time lapse to undergo spindle formation in the absence of a _PROTEIN_ eight spindles formed with equatorial planes parallel to the cell 's long axis and two formed with equatorial planes perpendicular to the cell 's long axis . the orientation of the remaining spindle was unknown because the cell was spherical in shape . it would therefore appear that in the absence of a _PROTEIN_ the orientation of the spindle is indeterminate . although two _METHOD_ of early mitosis were seen in arabidopsis suspension cells the genesis of the phragmoplast proceeded by a single occurring from the central spindle region . during the anaphase telophase transition the pronounced labeling at the poles declined and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocated diffusely to the region of the central spindle and then became more focused again around the reformed _LOCATION_ . as demonstrated in the movies of telophase cells we observed microtubule outgrowth to occur from the _LOCATION_ periphery during the early stages of phragmoplast morphogenesis . during _PROTEIN_ stages when the phragmoplast was expanding we observed that _LOCATION_ associated strands of cytoplasm continued to contribute to the growing edge of the cytokinetic apparatus . however in some cells the _LOCATION_ becomes less tightly associated with the phragmoplast and its growing front with the cytokinetic apparatus appearing to break away during subsequent stages . this can be seen by comparing the relative positions of the lower _LOCATION_ in panel with of figure . in this case a _METHOD_ labeled locus _METHOD_ independently of the _LOCATION_ surface with filaments radiating from it toward the midzone of the leading edge of the phragmoplast this could provide a potential means of expanding the phragmoplast as it grows beyond the corridor between the daughter _LOCATION_ . the process of centrifugal outgrowth also showed some variability in its behavior . we were able to follow by time lapse both symmetrical and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of expansion in arabidopsis suspension cells . the daughter _LOCATION_ of these arabidopsis suspension cells often remained stationary during cytokinesis . by contrast we encountered cases where the _LOCATION_ moved . figure shows a different kind of _PROTEIN_ cytokinesis in which phragmoplast expansion began symmetrically but switched to _PROTEIN_ growth after contact of the cell plate with one side of the cell cortex . instead of remaining static the daughter _LOCATION_ then migrated toward the opposite side of the cell in the wake of the outgrowing phragmoplast . microtubular _METHOD_ was then diminished at the side of the phragmoplast that had made first contact with the cell wall and became biased toward the leading edge of the phragmoplast giving rise to a c shaped array of microtubules _LOCATION_ . the final positioning of the cell plate also involved phragmoplast reorientation . figure shows an actively expanding phragmoplast rotate through before selection of the division plane . note that this rotation occurred in the same cell as illustrated in figures to underlining the _PROTEIN_ that phragmoplast rotations were only observed in cells undergoing mitosis in the absence of a _PROTEIN_ . in these cases the phragmoplast reorientation resulted in division occurring along the shortest axis of the cell _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure a general and notable feature of mobile daughter _LOCATION_ was a subset of microtubules that emanated from _PROTEIN_ caps of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ around the _LOCATION_ surfaces distal to the phragmoplast . these microtubules interacted with the cell cortex . the appearance of these microtubules which were reminiscent of the astral microtubules of animal cell division was cell cycle regulated . they gradually increased in length and number as cells progressed from metaphase to anaphase and telophase during which numerous microtubules were observed radiating from the outer surfaces of the reforming daughter _LOCATION_ . like astral microtubules the average growth rate of these _LOCATION_ associated microtubules was faster than reported for interphase rates of cortical microtubule polymerization .
suspension cultures of arabidopsis thaliana were _PROTEIN_ as described in citation . arabidopsis seedlings were grown on plates containing phytagel sucrose and _METHOD_ powdered medium with macro and micro elements . plates were incubated for d at and then transferred to the growth room at under continuous lighting . seedlings were used for confocal microscopy after to d. cells were transformed with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or hdel _METHOD_ as described by citation except that of the agrobacterium tumefaciens suspension was used to transform cells and that suspension cultures were supplemented with of acetosyringone before transformation . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible within d after which cells were subcultured to encourage division . the hdel _METHOD_ construct was obtained from chris hawes . the _PROTEIN_ gene plus kb of sequence upstream of the open reading frame was amplified from genomic dna and inserted into the pgem t easy vector according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the primers used for the pcr reaction were as follows aaggtacctaaccgattagacttgcagg _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which amplified a product of bp . these primers also flanked the genomic dna fragment with sali and kpni restriction enzyme sites . these sites were then used to cut the pcr product from the pgem t easy vector and ligate it into the plasmid which contains a c terminal _METHOD_ tag . the native promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was checked by sequencing and transformed into arabidopsis plants by transformation with agrobacterium using the floral dip technique . to select for transformants generation seeds were harvested and sown on _METHOD_ powdered medium containing of kanamycin . resistant seedlings were transplanted to soil and the seeds analyzed for the segregation of kanamycin resistance . the test was used to predict lines containing a single copy of the transgene . homozygous lines were then identified in the generation and used for microscopic analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transformed into plants as described above . transformed cells were fixed for h in pme buffer plus m sorbitol containing formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde . after three washes in pmes the cells were stuck to poly l lys coated slides and extracted in pmes containing onozuka r cellulase pectolyase y and triton x . cells were labeled with rat antitubulin and rabbit anti _METHOD_ diluted in pmes containing bsa . primary antibody binding was then detected after three washes in pmes by applying anti rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated and anti rat conjugated antibodies _PROTEIN_ diluted as described above . the cells were washed four more times stained with diamidino phenylindole and then mounted in citifluor antifade mountant . dna was visualized by adding of triton x and of dapi to ml of suspension cells . images were acquired using a bio rad mrc confocal microscope . cells were _PROTEIN_ in a modified chamber fitted with a gas permeable _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . images were taken at to s intervals . both _METHOD_ and hdel _METHOD_ were excited at nm and visualized using a nm long pass filter . microtubule growth rates were measured in the time lapse images using the line and reslice tools of imagej . for quantification experiments single transgenic lines of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under control of either or native promoter were selected . in both cases _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was uniformly _PROTEIN_ and cells were phenotypically indistinguishable from those in control plants . nonsaturated images of spindles labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were collected using a visitech spinning disc confocal microscope fitted with a oil objective lens . _METHOD_ was excited using the nm line of an argon ion laser and the emitted light filtered through a to nm band pass filter . spindle _METHOD_ was detected using a hamamatsu orca _LOCATION_ cooled ccd camera with binning set at s exposure time and z step intervals . images were analyzed using imagej z sections were projected and the average intensities of entire spindles calculated using the measure tool . max z projections ensured that the calculations were performed on complete spindles . sequence data from this article have been deposited with the embl/genbank data libraries under accession numbers _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ .
