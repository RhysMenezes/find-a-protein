a new type of protein was found in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ which is rich in glutamate and lysine residues . the protein bound even in the presence of a high concentration of . real time polymerase chain reaction and histochemical analysis of promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in most organs . the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected immunochemically in these organs . treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with sorbitol or flagellin oligopeptide enhanced the transcription . on the other hand other sugars abscisic acid gibberellic acid dehydration and low temperature had little or no effect on _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance . the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis cells and the subcellular fractionation of tissue homogenate showed that _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ although _PROTEIN_ has no predicted transmembrane domain . _PROTEIN_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under natural conditions and was released from the _LOCATION_ at high concentrations of or in vitro . these results suggest that the hydrophilic protein _PROTEIN_ binds and other cations and is stably associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
new cabps have been examined to elucidate their role in signalling and calcium homeostasis in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ has been found as a protein with some sequence similarity to rvcab in a search of the arabidopsis database . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to consist of amino acid residues . lack of cysteine and histidine residues and high contents of glutamate lysine and valine residues are common properties between _PROTEIN_ and rvcab . charged residues make up of _PROTEIN_ . the estimated pi value of _PROTEIN_ is . _PROTEIN_ and rvcab contain four or nine repeats respectively of a motif veekk including variations . _PROTEIN_ was suggested to have two possible myristoylation sites at the n terminus and the internal part by sequence analysis by the the mendel site and scanprosite . the internal site is not likely to be used biologically even though its residues were predicted because of the nature of the myristoylation reaction mechanism . myristate might be linked to a glycine residue at the n terminus . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind was tested by overlay analysis . in the present experiment recombinant _PROTEIN_ was examined because of the difficulty in obtaining purified native _PROTEIN_ due to the low abundance of the protein in planta . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells was completely purified as shown in fig . . _LOCATION_ sheets blotted with purified _PROTEIN_ were incubated in in the presence of mm and mm kcl and then rinsed with ethanol . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ reproducibly gave a clear positive signal of . purified _PROTEIN_ heated to also gave the same level of signal . thus _PROTEIN_ retained binding activity even after heat treatment . calmodulin showed a positive signal in this assay but immunoglobulin a negative control gave no signal . the amount of _PROTEIN_ could not be determined because _PROTEIN_ was partially trapped on the _LOCATION_ filter like rvcab . the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ was examined by promoter gus analysis of _PROTEIN_ . the putative promoter region was fused in frame with the gus gene and transformed into arabidopsis . three week old plants were stained for gus . there was strong gus activity for _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant including roots and rosette leaves . the promoter gus analysis is consistent with the results of mrna quantification and taken together these assays show that the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ in all organs . in the cross section of root all of the tissues including epidermis and cortex endodermis and root hairs were strongly stained . the epidermis and leaf veins also showed strong gus activity in the section of leaf . in flower organ pistils and anthers showed gus activity . the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ was quantified by real time pcr and compared in several organs . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in both shoots and roots with relatively low mrna levels in flowers and siliques . this result was in agreement with the transcript levels obtained by dna microchip analysis indicating the reliability of the present analysis . recent proteomic and genomic analyses revealed that a set of genes is regulated by temperature drought and salt stress under the control of intracellular signalling . as demonstrated above since _PROTEIN_ has binding capacity the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ is changed in response to . the effects of and other metals were first examined to investigate the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ . figure shows the mrna level in whole plantlets after treatment with nacl kcl or . the plants grew normally under these conditions . the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was relatively constant after treatment with all salts except for after treatment with mm _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transiently by at h but then increased fold at h. the effect of long term supply of metal ions was also examined . the _PROTEIN_ mrna level increased > fold after treatment with mm nacl mm kcl mm or mm for d . the effect of deficiency of metal ions on the mrna levels was examined by changing the growth medium from the salt containing medium to _METHOD_ medium which contains low concentrations of salts such as mm and . suppression of concentration caused a moderate increase in the mrna level after h . in the presence of other ions the mrna levels were relatively constant . _PROTEIN_ source nutrients are known to affect the _PROTEIN_ of a large number of genes . the effect of four different sugars at a concentration of mm was examined . mannitol and sorbitol increased the mrna level fold and fold respectively . on the other hand sucrose and _PROTEIN_ showed no effect on _PROTEIN_ . the effect of salicylic acid abscisic acid and gibberellic acid on the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ was examined . these hormone treatments did not affect the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ . the flagellin oligopeptide which is the most highly conserved region in the n terminus of eubacterial flagellin induces pathological responses in arabidopsis and other plants . in this experiment week old plantlets were incubated in a _METHOD_ sucrose medium containing flagellin peptide . treatment with the peptide increased the transcript amount fold . this observation suggests the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the response to microbial pathogens . to examine the effect of temperature week old plantlets grown at were kept for h at or . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was not changed under either temperature . dehydration partially suppressed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . a polyclonal antibody was prepared against the conjugate of keyhole limpet haemocyanin and the internal sequence of _PROTEIN_ . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody reacted specifically with the antigen in crude _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis . the corresponding authentic peptide completely inhibited the immunochemical reaction indicating the specificity of the antibody . the antibody recognized a recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . therefore this antibody was used to probe the _PROTEIN_ protein in the following experiments . crude _LOCATION_ fractions prepared from cauline leaves rosette leaves and _METHOD_ showed clear immunostained bands at kda . on the other hand the fraction of flowers and siliques showed only a slight immunostained band . judging from the intensity of immunostaining the relative content of _PROTEIN_ on the basis of the weight of _LOCATION_ protein in leaves was similar to that in _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ purified from crude _LOCATION_ gave an intense immunostained band at kda which suggested that _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . most of the _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered in the crude _LOCATION_ fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction . the specific content of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ was estimated to be < of that in the crude _LOCATION_ fraction . thus it was estimated that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly located in the _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ two dna constructs encoding a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ which was at the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and c termini of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were prepared and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . more than cells were observed for each construct and typical images are shown in fig . . the green _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of suspension cultured cells . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed in arabidopsis roots . some _METHOD_ could be seen in the _LOCATION_ but none was seen in _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . the difference in the _METHOD_ images between the two constructs may be related to the function of the n and c terminal parts of _PROTEIN_ in intracellular localization as discussed _PROTEIN_ . for the control experiment the _METHOD_ of the cells _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ of suspension cultured cells . in contrast to the control experiment the green _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not observed in _LOCATION_ suggesting that the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not from the free _METHOD_ cleaved from the fusion protein . to test the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein under natural conditions the crude _LOCATION_ fraction prepared from the homogenate of week old plantlets was subjected to equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation . _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered in fractions together with the aha . vha a and the _LOCATION_ luminal protein bip were recovered in lighter fractions . thus these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is a highly charged protein and has no predicted transmembrane domain or hydrophobic segment in its sequence this is inconsistent with its _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . the conditions for stimulating the dissociation of the protein from the _LOCATION_ were examined . _PROTEIN_ was released from _LOCATION_ by treatment with mm but not by sonication in mm kcl . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not bound to the _LOCATION_ by an electrostatic interaction . the effects of various ions on the association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ were examined . treatment with edta nacl or kcl did not release _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ even at mm or mm . however addition of and/or stimulated the release of _PROTEIN_ at concentrations > mm . and co exist in the _LOCATION_ of living cells under physiological concentrations of mm and respectively . under the conditions of mm and mm most _PROTEIN_ was retained in the _LOCATION_ . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ tightly associates with the _LOCATION_ under physiological concentrations of and . the result is consistent with the observation of _METHOD_ linked _PROTEIN_ and the cell fractionation experiment . to examine the reversibility of the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ free _PROTEIN_ was incubated with the _PROTEIN_ depleted _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was completely removed from the _LOCATION_ by incubation with mm . the _PROTEIN_ depleted _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with the _PROTEIN_ containing supernatant . when the mixture was treated with edta to remove free and other metal ions _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the precipitate . when the was re centrifuged without mixing with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recovered in . these results clearly indicate re association of the released _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ .
