ascorbate peroxidase exists as several _METHOD_ that are found in various compartments in plant cells . the _LOCATION_ and chloroplast apxs appear to play important roles in antioxidation metabolism in plant cells yet the function of peroxisomal apx is not well studied . in this study the localization of a putative peroxisomal _LOCATION_ bound ascorbate peroxidase _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis was confirmed by studying the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in transgenic plants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to co localize with a reporter protein that was targeted to _LOCATION_ by the peroxisomal targeting signal . the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was investigated by analysing an _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant under normal and several stress conditions . it was found that loss of function in _PROTEIN_ does not affect arabidopsis growth and development suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may not be an important antioxidant enzyme in arabidopsis at least under the conditions that were tested or the function of _PROTEIN_ could be compensated by other antioxidant enzymes in plant cells .
although _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis shows the highest sequence similarity to the cotton papx and pumpkin papx throughout its entire length including the transmembrane domain at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ was never experimentally determined to be localized to glyoxysomal or peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . the cotton papx is localized to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and the sequence that targets cotton papx to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ is composed of a c terminal transmembrane domain followed by a few basic amino acid residues . this sequence was defined as mpts _LOCATION_ . since the c terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ resembles the mpts from cotton papx it is predicted that _PROTEIN_ is peroxisomal _LOCATION_ bound . compared with other arabidopsis apxs _PROTEIN_ is most similar to _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also has a c terminal transmembrane domain followed by a few positively charged amino acid residues . it appears that there are only two apxs in arabidopsis that are likely to be peroxisomal _LOCATION_ bound . the third apx that contains a c terminal transmembrane is the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound apx in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . the other five apx _METHOD_ in arabidopsis do not have transmembrane domains . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ may be a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ protein or a chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ may be a _LOCATION_ protein and finally the stromal apx _PROTEIN_ can also be targeted to mitochondria . in addition two more apxs were found in the arabidopsis genome and an unknown apx . is a very small apx and its subcellular localization is not known . the unknown apx has no _PROTEIN_ sequence tag sequences associated with it therefore it might be a pseudogene . in order to localize _PROTEIN_ it was fused to the c terminal side of the _METHOD_ and the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was studied . more than transgenic plants were created and it was found that most of them _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion transcript at high levels . the steady state levels of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were then studied by western blot analysis in lines that contained high levels of the transgene transcript . as expected all high _PROTEIN_ lines at the transcript level also _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was analysed in those high _PROTEIN_ lines . _METHOD_ microscopy was used to observe the green _METHOD_ signal in protoplasts made from high _PROTEIN_ lines . the data clearly indicated that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was found in the _LOCATION_ of organelles that appeared to be _LOCATION_ . to prove that the organelles to which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was targeted were indeed _LOCATION_ a reference marker line was used that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that was tagged with _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was previously shown to be targeted to _LOCATION_ by citation . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were crossed to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines to obtain plants that _PROTEIN_ both fusion proteins and then the localization of these two fusion proteins was determined using _METHOD_ microscopy . to avoid the red _METHOD_ signal coming from chlorophylls cells that did not contain chloroplasts were used . it was found that the two fusion proteins co localized to the same organelles namely _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ cells or glyoxysomes in root cells . based on these data it was concluded that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the peroxisomal/glyoxysomal _LOCATION_ . previously it was demonstrated that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ increases photosynthetic tolerance to drought stress and oxidative stress in transgenic plants . therefore it ws thought that _PROTEIN_ might play an important role in plant cellular metabolism . to explore the function of _PROTEIN_ further an _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant was studied that was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ at ohio state university . this mutant was due to a t dna insertion in the seventh exon which leads to a null phenotype at the transcript and protein level . the size of the t dna insert is larger than kb which might result in highly unstable transcripts and disrupt the translation process . despite several trials no _PROTEIN_ transcript was ever detected from this mutant . consequently no _PROTEIN_ protein could be detected by western blot analysis . the phenotypes and growth behaviours of the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant were examined under normal and temperature stress conditions . no major morphological and _METHOD_ differences were detected between _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants under these conditions . since is produced from _LOCATION_ during lipid mobilization in seed germination the seed germination rates of _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants were compared under salt stress conditions . again no significant differences were observed between _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants . the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is dispensable for arabidopsis under normal growth conditions and the stress conditions tested . since peroxisomal apx is probably involved in scavenging produced during photorespiratory metabolism the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant may behave differently from wild type plants under conditions where photorespiration is increased . therefore chlorophyll _METHOD_ analysis was used to study the photosynthetic electron transport in _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants under two different conditions that could enhance photorespiration heat stress and elevated oxygen levels . dark acclimated detached leaves were initially illuminated at a photon flux density of and . the level of which is used to estimate the quantum efficiency of electron transport in psii complexes stabilized after min of illumination . no statistically significant differences between genotypes were found at this time . then the leaf temperature was elevated from to within min without changes in the light intensity . a temporary increase in presumably due to temporary enhancement of the activity of the enzymes in the calvin cycle was followed by a decline in the level of this parameter . this decline represented the damage to the photosynthetic apparatus caused by the high temperature treatment . the _PROTEIN_ in occurred earlier for the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant when compared with wild type plants although the differences were statistically significant only at the beginning of the decline . interestingly this subtle difference in photosynthetic electron transport between _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants did not occur at . the values did not differ significantly between _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants under photorespiratory or non photorespiratory conditions . the data indicate that there might be a threshold of stress tolerance for which the role of _PROTEIN_ could be reflected .
