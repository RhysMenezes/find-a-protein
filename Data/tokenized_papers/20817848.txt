recently a number of two lim domain containing proteins _METHOD_ have been reported to trigger the formation of actin bundles a major higher order cytoskeletal assembly . here we analyzed the six arabidopsis thaliana lim proteins . promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter studies revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are widely _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predominantly _PROTEIN_ in pollen . lim green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions all decorated the actin _LOCATION_ and increased actin bundle _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants and in vitro although with different affinities and efficiencies . remarkably the activities of _METHOD_ were calcium and ph independent whereas those of _METHOD_ were inhibited by high ph and in the case of _PROTEIN_ by high . domain analysis showed that the c terminal domain is key for the responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ to ph and calcium . regulation of lim by ph was further analyzed in vivo by tracking _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during intracellular ph modifications . cytoplasmic alkalinization specifically promoted release of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from filamentous actin . consistent with these data _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ decorated long actin bundles in the pollen tube shank a region of relatively low ph . together our data support a prominent role of arabidopsis lim proteins in the regulation of actin _LOCATION_ organization and dynamics in sporophytic tissues and pollen .
according to a recent wide range phylogenetic analysis the six arabidopsis lim genes have been renamed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the possibility that individual arabidopsis _METHOD_ have specific functions in specific tissues or cell types due to nonoverlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns was examined in arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the gus reporter gene under the control of individual lim gene sequences . preliminary rna gel blot analysis shows _PROTEIN_ of all three _METHOD_ in a wide range of organs including roots leaves stem flowers and siliques . by contrast plim transcripts were predominantly detected in flowers . gus histochemical assays confirmed and refined these data . indeed gus and gus _PROTEIN_ was high in virtually all organs and tissues including root stem leaf and apical bud tissues . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was also strong in roots and leaf vasculature but resulted in rather weak staining in other leaf tissues . significant _PROTEIN_ of the three prowlim gus fusions was detected in floral tissues including peduncle pedicels pistils and stamen filaments . however no or only a faint signal could be detected in pollen grains even after long staining periods . by contrast the three proplim gus fusions exhibited prominent _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . particularly high _PROTEIN_ levels of _METHOD_ were indicated by a fast and intense staining . gus _PROTEIN_ exclusively appeared in pollen . a weak gus staining was sometimes observed in leaves for pro _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was regularly detected in roots and leaf vasculature . together these results are in good agreement with the analysis of publicly available microarray data . indeed much higher signal intensities were detected for _METHOD_ than for _METHOD_ in vegetative tissues whereas the situation was inverted in pollen . in addition _PROTEIN_ was the plim subfamily member exhibiting the highest _PROTEIN_ level in vegetative tissues . the strong upregulation of the three _METHOD_ in tricellular and mature pollen grains suggests that plim activity is required during the _PROTEIN_ stages of pollen development and during pollen germination . in conclusion our data provide strong evidence for the separation of arabidopsis _METHOD_ into two subfamilies with different to some extent complementary _PROTEIN_ patterns . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are widely _PROTEIN_ in most sporophytic tissues with no or very weak _PROTEIN_ in pollen whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predominantly and abundantly _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . two tobacco and one lily lim have been previously reported to interact with the actin _LOCATION_ in live cells . the possibility that all six members of the arabidopsis lim family display a similar activity was examined in transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ individual _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . figure shows typical confocal microscopy images obtained for different cell types including leaf epidermal root and root hair cells . all six _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with a cytoplasmic filamentous network similar to the one revealed by the fimbrin derived actin _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this network was confirmed to be the actin _LOCATION_ by both rhodamine phalloidin colabeling and latrunculin b depolymerizing experiments . comparison of confocal images suggested that _METHOD_ interact less efficiently with the _LOCATION_ than _METHOD_ . indeed most of _METHOD_ plim _PROTEIN_ cells exhibited a relatively high level of diffuse cytoplasmic _METHOD_ whereas _METHOD_ _METHOD_ more sharply decorated the _LOCATION_ . differences in the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were further characterized by quantifying the fraction of cytoplasmic _METHOD_ associated with the _LOCATION_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . in primary root cells of the _METHOD_ signal due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ concentrated on the _LOCATION_ . in root hairs the fcfac dropped to indicating that roughly of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ population was unbound in the cytoplasm . by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ predominantly associated with the _LOCATION_ as indicated by fcfac values of roughly and in both types of cells respectively . immunoblot analysis performed with an anti _METHOD_ antibody confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ at similar levels in the arabidopsis lines used in the above analyses ruling out that results were due to differences in transgene _PROTEIN_ levels . remarkably no obvious developmental or morphological phenotype was noticed in lim overexpressing transgenic plants . however confocal microscopy images revealed substantial modifications of the actin _LOCATION_ organization . indeed actin bundles were usually _PROTEIN_ and less abundant than in control cells . these observations are consistent with those previously reported in the case of tobacco _PROTEIN_ overexpression and support that all six _METHOD_ promote cross linking of afs into _PROTEIN_ bundles . although this study focuses on the cytoplasmic functions of plant _METHOD_ it is noteworthy that contrary to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also accumulated within the _LOCATION_ suggesting potential _LOCATION_ functions for _METHOD_ . to date actin regulatory activities have been biochemically demonstrated for only two plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . here we assessed the actin binding stabilizing and bundling activities of the whole arabidopsis lim family . citation recently reported that preferentially binds afs under low ph and low . we therefore initiated biochemical investigations using similar conditions . the ability of _METHOD_ to directly bind to afs was evaluated by high speed cosedimentation assays . recombinant _METHOD_ were produced in escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography . afs were copolymerized with individual _METHOD_ and centrifuged at and the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . control experiments showed that recombinant _METHOD_ do not sediment significantly when centrifuged alone . in the presence of afs the six _METHOD_ accumulated in the pellet fraction indicating that they directly interact with afs . however the relative amount of pelleted lim was slightly lower in the case of the three _METHOD_ suggesting differences in affinity for afs . this possibility was further investigated by conducting additional high speed cosedimentation assays with increasing concentrations of lim proteins and calculating apparent equilibrium dissociation constant values as previously described by citation citation . in the conditions used the three _METHOD_ displayed relatively high and similar affinities for afs as indicated by apparent kd values of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . noticeably these values were significantly lower than those calculated for _METHOD_ which ranged from _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . affinities of the six arabidopsis lim proteins for afs the effect of lim binding on af stability was examined in depolymerization assays . pyrene labeled afs were copolymerized with individual _METHOD_ and subsequently subjected to depolymerization by diluting the samples to an actin concentration below the critical concentration . depolymerization kinetics were recorded by monitoring _METHOD_ intensity over time . in the absence of _METHOD_ afs promptly depolymerized as shown by the rapid decline of _METHOD_ . by contrast in the presence of individual _METHOD_ the af depolymerization rate was markedly _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the kd values calculated above the two lim subfamilies exhibited different stabilization capabilities . whereas _METHOD_ fully stabilized afs as indicated by stable _METHOD_ curves _METHOD_ only reduced the af depolymerization rate . remarkably the three members of each lim subfamily displayed roughly identical stabilizing capabilities . finally the ability of each lim to cross link afs was assessed using low speed cosedimentation assays . afs were copolymerized with individual _METHOD_ and centrifuged at and the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the absence of lim most of the actin was detected in the supernatant fraction . by contrast in the presence of individual _METHOD_ actin _METHOD_ sedimented indicating the presence of high order actin structures . the latter were directly examined by _METHOD_ light microscopy after rhodamine phalloidin labeling and identified as actin bundles . in conclusion all six arabidopsis _METHOD_ function as true _PROTEIN_ . in addition they display autonomous actin stabilizing and bundling activities . however differences are also pointed out by data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the potential regulation of lim activities by ph and were assessed by focusing on one member of each lim subfamily namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both proteins were first subjected to a series of actin depolymerization assays conducted at three different ph conditions and and in the presence of low or high amounts of free corresponding to nm and respectively . for each ph and condition different concentrations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been tested whereas the concentration of actin before dilution was set at . under low ph and low both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stabilized afs in a concentration dependent manner . data confirmed the higher stabilizing capability of _PROTEIN_ . indeed of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to slow down the af depolymerization rate whereas of _PROTEIN_ were required to produce a significant effect . in addition full stabilization of afs was achieved for _PROTEIN_ concentrations whereas it required > of _PROTEIN_ . increasing ph from to or caused the loss of _PROTEIN_ stabilizing activity as indicated by depolymerization curves similar to the controls . at higher ph even the highest _PROTEIN_ concentrations failed to slow down af depolymerization indicating a strong ph dependent inhibition . by contrast _PROTEIN_ preserved prominent activity at both intermediate and high ph values . furthermore its stabilizing efficiency appeared unmodified by ph increase since in all ph conditions maximal af stabilization was observed for _PROTEIN_ concentrations . to check whether high ph values can also inhibit the actin stabilizing activity of af bound _PROTEIN_ afs were first copolymerized with _PROTEIN_ in optimal conditions and the ph was subsequently shifted by the addition of alkalizing buffers of increasing strength . supplemental figure online shows that the rate of depolymerization increased proportionally to the shift of ph applied indicating that ph can inactivate _PROTEIN_ when the latter is associated with afs . by contrast the ability of _PROTEIN_ to stabilize afs was preserved whatever the shift of ph applied . additional depolymerization experiments were performed at high levels . at ph the high significantly reduced the actin stabilizing capability of _PROTEIN_ . however this inhibition was less strong than that of ph as indicated by the weak but significant levels of stabilization observed for the highest concentrations of _PROTEIN_ . in higher ph conditions high showed no visible effect since _PROTEIN_ activity remained turned off . the depolymerization curves obtained for _PROTEIN_ were similar to those obtained at low indicating that _PROTEIN_ was not responsive to . lim induced stabilization most likely results from the cross linking of afs . thus from the above data one might anticipate that _PROTEIN_ bundling activity is negatively regulated by high ph and/or high whereas the one of _PROTEIN_ is not . to confirm these assumptions low speed cosedimentation assays were conducted in different ph and conditions using a fixed concentration of actin and increasing concentrations of lim . to make comparisons easier _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels were scanned after staining and the respective amounts of actin in the pellet and in supernatant fractions were quantified using imagej software . as expected _PROTEIN_ induced actin sedimentation in a concentration dependent manner in all tested ph and combinations . lack of responsiveness to ph and was further demonstrated by the _PROTEIN_ that maximal sedimentation was invariably achieved for _PROTEIN_ concentrations . _PROTEIN_ also induced efficient cross linking of afs under low ph and conditions . however maximal sedimentation required of _PROTEIN_ confirming its weaker activity compared with _PROTEIN_ . higher ph values fully inhibited _PROTEIN_ cross linking activity as shown by the relative amounts of actin in the pellet similar to those measured in controls . consistent with the depolymerization data high partially inhibited _PROTEIN_ activity at ph as shown by the reduced but significant amounts of actin sedimented in the presence of high _PROTEIN_ concentrations . direct observation of afs polymerized alone or in the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ confirmed the above data . indeed _PROTEIN_ triggered the formation of actin bundles in all ph and combinations tested whereas _PROTEIN_ only induced similar structures under both low ph and low . as expected _PROTEIN_ bundling activity was partially inhibited by high as shown by the rare bundles observed at ph and . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respond differently to ph and in vitro . _PROTEIN_ actin regulatory activities are not regulated by ph and whereas those of _PROTEIN_ are inhibited by ph values and/or high . to test whether responsiveness to ph and is a specific property of arabidopsis plim subfamily members additional low speed cosedimentation assays were performed using actin and each arabidopsis lim . similarly to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ induced actin sedimentation in a ph and independent manner . indeed of actin were pelleted in all the combinations of ph and tested . similarly to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were unable to promote actin sedimentation at relatively high ph values . however both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ efficiently cross linked afs at low ph whatever the indicating that they are not responsive to . in summary the three wlim subfamily members cross link afs in a ph and independent manner . by contrast the cross linking activity of the three plim subfamily members is inhibited by ph values . finally _PROTEIN_ is the only arabidopsis lim to clearly respond to its activity being downregulated by high . the most divergent domain in size and in amino acid sequence between wlim and plim family members is the c terminal domain . noticeably this domain is longer and contains a significantly higher number of acidic residues in _METHOD_ than in _METHOD_ . to test whether the c terminal domain is involved in the specific responsiveness of _METHOD_ to ph _PROTEIN_ we generated c terminal deleted versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and studied their actin stabilizing and bundling activities in different conditions of ph and . our data indicate that in contrast with _PROTEIN_ whose activities are inhibited by high ph and/or high _PROTEIN_ efficiently stabilized and cross linked afs in all the conditions tested . indeed the deletion of the c terminal domain is sufficient to abolish the ability of _PROTEIN_ to respond to ph and calcium variations . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed strong and nearly identical activities whatever the ph and supporting that the deletion of the c terminal domain is not detrimental to the basal activity of wlim proteins . the above biochemical data strongly suggest that cytoplasmic ph acts as a regulator of plim activities . this hypothesis is consistent with the existence of intracellular ph gradients in growing pollen tubes and the concept that ph variations regulate the actin _LOCATION_ organization and dynamics through the in/activation of different classes of _PROTEIN_ . however ph specific monitoring of plim actin regulatory activities in the context of live cells requires direct demonstration . in that attempt we artificially modulated the cytoplasmic ph of arabidopsis cells and analyzed the resulting effect of such manipulations on the ability of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins to interact with the actin _LOCATION_ . briefly cell culture lines were produced from transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the actin _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . prior to ph treatment cells were immobilized on polylysine coated cover slips and incubated in standard culture medium supplemented with the ratiometric ph sensitive dye snarf . both concentration and incubation time of the dye were optimized for arabidopsis cells to and min respectively . the ph dye most frequently diffused in a relatively homogenous manner into the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . the average cytoplasmic ph was estimated to be . occasionally the dye also penetrated the central _LOCATION_ . as expected the _LOCATION_ was found to be the most acidic cellular compartment with ph values . to _PROTEIN_ or increase the cytoplasmic ph cells were incubated in buffers containing the cell permeant weak acid sodium propionate or the cell permeant weak base ammonium chloride . confocal acquisitions of the ph sensitive dye and of the _METHOD_ fused proteins were collected just before and min after the application of ph buffers . it should be noted that after longer incubation times in ph buffers the evolution of ph frequently reversed although the recovery was much slower than the initial shift . figure presents typical results obtained with the three cell lines of interest . successful modifications of ph were confirmed by pseudocolored ratio images and the cytoplasmic ph was found to reach values close to those of ph buffers . the effect of ph modifications on the ability of each _METHOD_ fusion protein to interact with the actin _LOCATION_ was carefully analyzed by quantifying the fcfac and by comparing this value before and after ph treatment . lowering the ph had no significant effects on the actin binding activity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as indicated by direct comparison of confocal images and rfcfac values close to . by contrast ph increase dramatically weakened the binding of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ as shown by prominent diffuse _METHOD_ signal . _METHOD_ release of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the actin network upon ph elevation is supported by a calculated rfcfac value of indicating that of the _METHOD_ initially associated with the _LOCATION_ has been displaced toward the cytoplasmic diffuse pool . contrary to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained largely associated with the actin _LOCATION_ upon cytoplasmic ph elevation . however quantitative analyses revealed a slight modification in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ subcellular distribution . indeed we calculated a rfcfac value of indicating an _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ bound _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ population upon ph elevation . by contrast the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was unaffected as indicated by rfcfac . however considering the relatively weak effect of high ph on _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization its biological significance remains uncertain . importantly rhodamine phalloidin colabeling experiments confirmed the persistence of a filamentous actin _LOCATION_ after increase of cytoplasmic ph in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . the reversibility of the process was assessed by successive treatments of cells with the alkalizing and acidifying buffers . as shown in figures to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ efficiently dissociated and reassociated with the _LOCATION_ indicating that its actin binding ability was not irreversibly damaged by elevated ph conditions . a control experiment conducted with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells confirmed that the predominant cytoskeletal localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is not significantly affected during similar ph treatment . to examine the cellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ in live growing pollen tubes of arabidopsis we produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . analyses performed on heterozygous plants revealed that transgenic and wild type _METHOD_ pollen grains germinate and elongate with very similar rates indicating that the recombinant protein does not significantly disturb pollen tube physiology . figure shows that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ interacted with a population of long actin bundles running along the pollen tube shank . time lapse imaging revealed that these bundles are highly dynamic and do not penetrate subapical and apical regions . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ occasionally decorates a structure in the subapical region resembling the cortical actin fringe which has been described by several studies .
transgenic arabidopsis thaliana lines described in this study were produced in landsberg _LOCATION_ for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and in columbia ecotype for all other lines . plants were greenhouse cultivated and propagated on soil under h h dark cycles . transformations were performed with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain using the floral dip method . for selection seeds were surface sterilized and plated onto half strength murashige and skoog agar medium _METHOD_ ph supplemented with sucrose and with mg/l of kanamycin or mg/l of hygromycin . after a d stratification at in the dark seeds were incubated in a growth chamber at under h h dark cycles . arabidopsis cell suspension cultures were generated by transferring d old seedlings onto a callus inducing medium . plates were wrapped in foil and kept in the dark at for to weeks . calli were transferred to ml liquid callus inducing medium and _PROTEIN_ in the dark at with gentle agitation . cells were propagated once a week by transferring ml of d old suspension to ml of fresh medium . arabidopsis lim coding sequences were amplified from clones obtained from the _PROTEIN_ and institut national de la recherche agronomique centre national de ressources or from a homemade seedling cdna library and cloned in the pentr vector . binary vectors harboring _METHOD_ lim fusions were constructed by transferring lim cds from pentr lim vectors by gateway cloning into . for each arabidopsis lim gene a promoter region consisting of a minimal sequence of bp upstream the translational start site was amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna and subsequently cloned into the binary vector pgptvii.kan to obtain prolim gus . lim coding sequences were cloned into to obtain _METHOD_ lim . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ termnos cassette was assembled in and transferred in the binary vector pgptvii.bar . detailed cloning procedures and primer sequences can be found in supplemental methods online and table respectively . the f actin reporter line _PROTEIN_ the actin binding domain of arabidopsis fimbrin fused to _METHOD_ at both c and n termini with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was kindly provided by the group of elison blancaflor . gus histochemical analyses of each reporter gene were performed on at least nine independent transgenic lines . staining for gus activity was performed for to h according to citation and on samples of various stages of development including d old seedlings and week old seedlings and inflorescences . in the case of inflorescences additional shorter staining periods were applied to confirm the high _PROTEIN_ level of plim genes . after staining samples were dehydrated by a series of ethanol washes and stored in ethanol until observation at the binocular and light microscope . plants and cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion proteins were imaged using a zeiss _PROTEIN_ meta confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a plan neofluar oil immersion objective . _METHOD_ was detected by exciting samples at a wavelength of nm and using a to nm band pass emission filter . for rhodamine phalloidin labeling experiments a nm excitation wavelength and a to nm band pass emission filter were used . confocal images were deconvolved using huygens essential image processing software package and are shown as stacks of neighboring sections reconstructed in imagej . snarf ratio imaging was performed in the meta channel using a nm excitation wavelength and a laser power of . emitted light was simultaneously collected with a dual channel of to nm and to nm bandwidth . to optimize signal detection the photomultiplier gain was set over the range to . ratio images were generated by dividing using the physiology module of _PROTEIN_ acquisition software . a pixel median filter was applied to improve image quality and final images were displayed with a rainbow look up table . quantification of the fcfac in _METHOD_ lim and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells was performed using metamorph software by adjusting the image threshold to eliminate most of the diffuse cytoplasmic _METHOD_ . the threshold has to be adjusted for each cell because the actin _LOCATION_ organization and the associated intensity of _METHOD_ can slightly vary from one cell to another . the remaining integrated _METHOD_ signal was quantified and _PROTEIN_ as a percentage of the total cellular _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . to avoid under or overexposure problem during acquisition the image intensity histogram was systematically checked and acquisition settings were adjusted so that the _METHOD_ signal distributes within the to range . to estimate how artificial modifications of cytoplasmic ph influence _METHOD_ lim and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ interaction with the actin _LOCATION_ fcfac values were measured before and after min ph treatment and fcfac ratios were calculated . in the in vivo actin depolymerization experiments arabidopsis cells were mounted in an open observation chamber and imaged before and h after addition of cytoskeletal inhibitor latrunculin b . rhodamine phalloidin labeling was performed in pme buffer _PROTEIN_ . for confocal analyses conducted with pollen pollen grains were placed on microscope slides by dipping freshly dehiscent anthers onto pollen germination medium solidified with low melting agarose . pollen germination medium was modified from citation and consisted of boric acid mm mm ca mm mm kcl and sucrose ph to . pollen of plants were used for pollen germination studies . approximately of arabidopsis cell suspension culture was plated on a poly l lysine coated cover slip . after removing the culture medium cells were incubated in ml of diluted ratiometric ph sensitive dye snarf _PROTEIN_ acid acetoxymethyl ester acetate for min in the dark at . modification of the intracellular ph was achieved by incubating cells in ml of callus inducing medium supplemented with mm ammonium chloride and mm hepes ph or with mm sodium propionate and mm mes ph . confocal microscopy observations were performed just before ph buffer application and after and min of treatment . in situ calibration was performed as recommended by citation using a combination of nigericin and valinomycin and in the presence of a high concentration of potassium ions . reference ph buffers were adjusted to a final ph of and . cells were incubated min in each ph buffer before imaging the snarf probe . a calibration curve was generated by calculating ratio values in cytoplasmic volumes of using metamorph software . this curve was used to estimate the ph in nontreated cells and to control ph modifications induced by the alkalizing and acidifying buffers . arabidopsis lim cds were subcloned into the bacterial _PROTEIN_ vector pqe . due to relatively low levels of _PROTEIN_ in bacteria escherichia coli codon optimized sequences have been generated for the three _METHOD_ . this did not result in any modification of the predicted amino acid sequences for _METHOD_ . the deletion of the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for production of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins has been achieved by pcr using the specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . tagged _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in bacteria and purified using a ni _PROTEIN_ resin following procedures described by the manufacturer . purified proteins were concentrated in a centrifugal filter buffer exchanged using a k molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette and stored on ice . prior to an experiment proteins were preclarified at and checked for correct molecular weight by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis and their concentration was determined by bradford assay using bsa as standard . high and low speed cosedimentation assays were used to assess the actin binding and crosslinking activities of arabidopsis _METHOD_ respectively . in both cases rabbit muscle actin _LOCATION_ was copolymerized with various concentrations of individual _METHOD_ for h in mm kcl mm mm _PROTEIN_ and mm dtt . depending on the ph and conditions tested the reaction medium was buffered with either mes and _PROTEIN_ ph or _PROTEIN_ and tris ph and and was supplemented with either egta or . supplemental table online indicates the concentration of mes _PROTEIN_ tris egta and for each of the copolymerization conditions used . in high speed experiments samples were centrifuged at for min to pellet afs . the presence of lim in the resulting supernatants and pellets was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ brillant blue r staining . in low speed experiments samples were centrifuged at for min in a microcentrifuge to pellet high order f actin structures . the presence of actin in the resulting supernatants and pellets was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ brillant blue r staining . in some experiments the respective amounts of actin in pellet and supernatant fractions were quantified using imagej software . the presence of actin bundles in samples was checked by direct visualization using _METHOD_ microscopy . an aliquot of the copolymerized actin samples was labeled with rhodamine phalloidin . one micromolar of sample was diluted in one drop of cityfluor and applied to a cover slip coated with poly l lysine . images were recorded via confocal microscope using a pinhole set to produce _PROTEIN_ optical sections . pyrene labeled actin _LOCATION_ was copolymerized with individual arabidopsis _METHOD_ in the same conditions as in cosedimentation assays . depolymerization was induced by diluting samples to a final actin concentration of . the _PROTEIN_ in pyrene _METHOD_ accompanying actin depolymerization was recorded over s using a _PROTEIN_ qm quantamaster fluorimeter . sequence data from this article can be found in the
