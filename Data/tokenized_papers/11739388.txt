we have identified a detoxifying efflux carrier from arabidopsis using a functional cloning strategy . a bacterial mutant is deficient in multidrug resistance and does not survive on medium containing norfloxacin . after transformation of cells with an arabidopsis cdna library transformants were selected for restored growth on the toxic medium . one cdna clone that complemented encodes a novel protein with twelve putative transmembrane domains and contains limited sequence homology to a multidrug and toxin efflux carrier from bacteria . we named this arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ . a large gene family of at least members encoding related proteins was identified from the arabidopsis genome . further functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein in mutant demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ serves as an efflux carrier for plant derived alkaloids antibiotics and other toxic compounds . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was also capable of detoxifying a heavy metal . further experiments suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in plant cells thereby mediating the efflux of plant derived or exogenous toxic compounds from the cytoplasm .
we designed a functional cloning strategy to identify putative multidrug efflux carriers from arabidopsis . an e. colimutant strain lacks acrab _METHOD_ that are multidrug efflux carriers required for multidrug resistance . as a result cells do not grow on medium containing norfloxacin a substrate of acrab efflux _METHOD_ . we transformed by an _PROTEIN_ cdna library of arabidopsis plants and isolated those cdna clones that restored the growth of mutant on the medium supplemented with norfloxacin . among the sequenced cdna clones one showed limited homology to the mate family efflux transporters in bacteria . we referred to this cdna clone as _PROTEIN_ . others encoded proteins without significant similarity to any known proteins in the data base . this study focused on the functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ cdna indeed complemented mutant we measured _PROTEIN_ mediated drug resistance with the strain as a negative control . as shown in containing empty vector did not grow on medium containing norfloxacin and ampicillin . in contrast transformed with _PROTEIN_ grew well . both strains grew normally on lb medium containing ampicillin . this result shows that _PROTEIN_ protein is capable of detoxifying norfloxacin . a search for sequences with homology to the _PROTEIN_ gene led to the identification of a large family of genes in thearabidopsis genome . at least distinct genes were identified that encode proteins with significant sequence similarity . we refer to these genes as _PROTEIN_ . phylogenetic analysis of this family revealed that members can be further divided into at least five clusters or subfamilies . the first cluster includes _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ the second cluster includes through and the third cluster includes through . the fourth cluster may include through . the fifth group contains only . the putative proteins in this family range in size from to residues and hydropathy analyses revealed that they all possess putative transmembrane domains except for the third cluster of genes which encode proteins with tmds . sequence alignments among the genes in different clusters indicated that the most conserved sequences are cgqa located between and and rvsnxlga located in . concerning the location of atdtxgenes in the arabidopsis genome members are located on chromosome members on chromosome members on chromosome members on chromosome and members on chromosome . thearabidopsis genome initiative numbers showed their chromosome location as listed in fig . a . some of these genes are present as tandem arrangements on the chromosomes . the genes in the same tandem array often show higher homology and are grouped in the same cluster/subfamily suggesting that they may be derived from gene duplication . _PROTEIN_ also showed limited homology to several genes in other _METHOD_ including norm ydhe and dinf from bacteria and _LOCATION_ from yeast . as discussed earlier norm and ydhe are mate family multidrug extrusion transporters . it is not known whether dinf protein functions as an efflux transporter in bacteria . its _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be induced by dna damage confers ethionine resistance in yeast although a direct transport function of _LOCATION_ protein has not been addressed . the phylogenetic relationship of _PROTEIN_ and these mate related proteins is presented in fig . d. according to this phylogeny tree _PROTEIN_ shares the highest similarity with norm gene and its homologues . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ appeared to be ubiquitous . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ rna was detected in all organs examined . its mrna accumulated in flowers and _METHOD_ at higher levels as compared with those in leaves and roots . _PROTEIN_ complemented norfloxacin sensitive mutant of e. coli and showed sequence similarity to mate efflux transporters from bacteria suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may function as a norfloxacin transport protein . to further determine the functional properties of _PROTEIN_ we measured norfloxacin accumulation in the mutant cells and cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ serves as an efflux carrier it is expected that cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ would accumulate less norfloxacin . as shown in a a high level of norfloxacin accumulation was observed with the mutant cells harboring the empty vector . in contrast transformed by a plasmid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed much lower levels of norfloxacin accumulation . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is capable of reducing the net accumulation of the drug by inhibiting norfloxacin influx or increasing efflux . because efflux through secondary transporters often depends on the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of proton or ions we measured norfloxacin accumulation in the presence of cccp a de coupler of the _LOCATION_ proton gradient . after addition of cccp to the assay solution accumulation level of norfloxacin increased dramatically in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells implying that _PROTEIN_ function is inhibited by cccp . this result is consistent with the possibility that _PROTEIN_ functions as a norfloxacin efflux transporter that requires a proton motive force . function of _PROTEIN_ as a multidrug transporter was examined further by assaying accumulation of ethidium bromide another putative substrate for mate transporters . fig . b indicates that _PROTEIN_ transformed cells accumulated much less ethidium bromide as compared with cells transformed by empty vector . after cccp was added to the assay mixture the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ transformants was rapidly increased to the similar level in cells suggesting that ethidium bromide like norfloxacin was likely to be extruded from cells by _PROTEIN_ protein . to further support that _PROTEIN_ mediates the efflux of the drugs we performed ethidium bromide efflux assay according to a previously described procedure . cells were first loaded with ethidium bromide under de energized conditions in the presence of cccp . after removing external ethidium bromide and cccp from the cells potassium lactate an energy donor was added to the efflux buffer to initiate drug efflux process . transformed by vector did not show significant efflux of ethidium bromide whereas _PROTEIN_ cells displayed rapid efflux in the same buffer . it was recently reported that bacterial norm protein functions as a na /drug antiporter . we tested whether _PROTEIN_ also depends on external na for drug transport . our results showed that external sodium does not affect _PROTEIN_ function . in both bacteria and higher plants h is a common currency for energizing secondary transport processes . the _PROTEIN_ that cccp inhibited efflux process revealed a requirement for proton motive force in _PROTEIN_ mediated transport . proton dependent transport is often regulated by external ph values . we assayed ethidium bromide efflux at various _LOCATION_ ph values . from ph to activity of _PROTEIN_ increased significantly . when the external ph increased to the efflux activity sharply _PROTEIN_ . the ph regulation observed with _PROTEIN_ is very similar to regulation of emre a multidrug efflux carrier that mediates proton/drug antiport in bacteria . if an inward proton gradient is the only parameter that is altered by _LOCATION_ ph values increasing _LOCATION_ ph values would _PROTEIN_ such a gradient thereby inhibiting drug efflux . our results on _PROTEIN_ and from emre studies are exactly opposite to this prediction . clearly a more complicated mechanism is involved in the ph regulation of _PROTEIN_ or emre mediated efflux . a model interpreting this ph effect has been proposed with emre . in particular studies on emre suggest that proton and drug substrates share a common binding site in the emre protein . _LOCATION_ ph not only changes the proton gradient but also regulates the charge state of the drug the affinity of the drug and proton to the common binding site of emre and _LOCATION_ potential . the combination of these effects determines a net result on the regulation of emre mediated drug efflux by _LOCATION_ ph . more studies are required to determine if _PROTEIN_ regulation by ph follows a similar model . the reversal of ph effect at ph has been reported earlier by hsiehet al . with a different multidrug transporter that depends on proton gradient . at alkaline ph an electrogenic na /h antiporter in bacteria leads to the acidification of the cytoplasm to _PROTEIN_ the ph homeostasis . hence at ph the ph gradient is inverted . the inverted ph gradient will act to increase the accumulation of weak base and strongly inhibit efflux activity . berberine and palmatine are common alkaloids produced in plants . both exhibit antibiotic properties and serve as substrates for the multidrug resistance pump . recent studies also show that plant alkaloids such as berberine are common substrates for mate family efflux carriers such as norm and ydhe . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ shares sequence similarity with norm protein suggests that _PROTEIN_ may transport plant alkaloids as well . if _PROTEIN_ mediates efflux of plant alkaloids these compounds may competitively inhibit the efflux of ethidium bromide . we tested this possibility by using berberine and palmatine . as shown in fig . a several concentrations including of berberine were added to the efflux assay mixture . when berberine concentration increased to it significantly inhibited the efflux of ethidium bromide through _PROTEIN_ . palmatine also inhibited efflux although it was less effective as compared with berberine . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ utilizes plant alkaloids as substrates we examined alkaloid efflux directly using a similar procedure for ethidium bromide efflux assay . berberine is a planar cationic molecule that resembles ethidium bromide and binds to dna . similar to ethidium bromide dna bound berberine has enhanced _METHOD_ . this property of berberine was used to examine berberine efflux as was done with ethidium bromide efflux . the _METHOD_ was measured with excitation at nm and emission at nm as described earlier . cells were first loaded with berberine by adding cccp in loading mixture . washed cells were resuspended and efflux was initiated by adding cells into _METHOD_ assay buffer . as shown in c transformed by _PROTEIN_ showed significantly more efflux as compared with cells transformed by vector under the same conditions . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ mediates efflux of plant alkaloids . heavy metals are toxic to plant growth and relatively little is understood on the mechanism of heavy metal detoxification in plants . in bacteria several studies suggest that some multidrug resistance proteins are involved in heavy metal resistance . for example disruption of mdrl a multidrug efflux carrier in listeria monocytogenes was associated with reduction in heavy metal resistance . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in heavy metal detoxification we cultured and _PROTEIN_ strains on the media supplemented with different heavy metals including and respectively . the two strains grew differently on the medium containing but not on media containing other heavy metals . the mutant strain did not grow on the medium containing higher concentrations of . in contrast transformed with _PROTEIN_ tolerated up to . more analysis using liquid cultures further confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ strain is significantly more tolerant to as compared with strain . during a h culture period and _PROTEIN_ cells grew similarly in the absence of . however and almost completely inhibited the growth of the strain . in contrast had little effect on the overall growth of _PROTEIN_ cells . at inhibited early growth of _PROTEIN_ cells but these cells recovered dramatically and nearly reach the density of the control at the end of a h culture . when concentration reached mm growth of _PROTEIN_ cells was inhibited . this result clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ confers tolerance to cells . the functional analyses of _PROTEIN_ in a bacterial model demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ serves as an efflux carrier that extrude a number of toxic compounds and possibly heavy metals from cells . to perform the similar cellular function in plants _PROTEIN_ protein must be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we fused _PROTEIN_ cdna to a gene coding for green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in a binary vector and introduced the construct into arabidopsis plants . we determined the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusion protein in the transgenic plants by laser confocal microscopy . in all cell types examined _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . fig . presents confocal images of root tip and elongated root cells from the controls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . for the background controls wild type non transformed plants and plants transformed with _METHOD_ alone were analyzed . background signals associated with the root tip region are shown in fig . a. localization of _METHOD_ only is shown in indicating a ubiquitous localization pattern in plant cells . as a positive control for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization plants transformed with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker fused to _METHOD_ were examined . fig . c shows a defined periphery localization pattern of this fusion protein . as in the positive control the _METHOD_ detected in cells of root tip region and elongation zone shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion is also localized to the cell periphery region _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ not the _LOCATION_ or other intracellular compartments . because elongated root cells contain a large central _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tonoplasts are closely located and may not be distinguishable by our procedure . however cells in the root tip region do not contain large central _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ pattern indicates _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or cell wall association . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is localized to the cell wall or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a plasmolysis experiment was performed . when roots from transgenic seedlings were placed in m mannitol _METHOD_ in both the positive control and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed plants was internalized with the cytoplasm . this localization pattern indicates that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the cell wall consistent with the presence of putative transmembrane domains in the protein sequence .
e. coli mutant strain harbors a deletion in the chromosomal acrab genes of strain and was sensitive to many drugs that are known as substrates of the acrab system . this mutant strain does not grow on medium containing norfloxacin . we _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsiscdna library in the mutant and selected transformants on the norfloxacin containing medium . the cdna clones that supported growth of mutant on the toxic medium were sequenced and subcloned into vector . we focused on one cdna _PROTEIN_ for further analyses . the cdna sequence of _PROTEIN_ encodes the same protein as annotated under the accession in the arabidopsis genomic sequence data base . for confirmation of complementation _PROTEIN_ cdna was constructed into vector and transformed into cells by electroporation . transformants were selected on the lb medium supplemented with ampicillin . individual transformants were grown in lb liquid medium containing the same concentration of antibiotics and mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside for induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the cultures were adjusted to diluted to fold gradient series and spotted onto lb solid medium supplemented with norfloxacin or different concentrations of heavy metal or antibiotics . the growth of different strains was scored after incubation at for h. the mutant transformed with was used as a control . assay of norfloxacin and

_PROTEIN_ exponential phase of growth under aerobic condition at harvested and washed with m mops tris buffer containing and suspended in the same buffer to mg /ml . the assay mixture contained cells /ml in the same buffer and mm potassium lactate . after incubation at for min norfloxacin was added to initiate the assay . samples were taken at intervals centrifuged at rpm for s at and washed once with the same buffer . after min of initiating _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone was added to the assay mixture at to disrupt the proton gradient across the _LOCATION_ . the pellet was suspended in ml of mm glycine hcl . the suspension was shaken vigorously for h at room temperature to release their _METHOD_ contents and then centrifuged at rpm for min at room temperature . the _METHOD_ of supernatants was measured with a hitachi f _METHOD_ spectrophotometer . the amount of _METHOD_ was normalized against total protein concentration that was measured by using the bio rad protein assay kit . cells used in ethidium bromide accumulation assay were prepared similarly as described above . after cells were washed and suspended in m tris hcl to a of and placed in the fluorometer cuvette with dilution in the same buffer . ethidium bromide was added at to the cell suspension to initiate the assay . samples were taken at different time points . cccp was added at at the min time point . the _METHOD_ of the sample mixture was measured with excitation and emission wavelength of and respectively . because ethidium bromide _METHOD_ results from binding to intracellular components especially to _LOCATION_ acids the increase in _METHOD_ intensity reflected the accumulation of the dye in the cell . the amount of maximum _METHOD_ was normalized to . for determining ethidium bromide efflux cells from an overnight culture were pelleted and washed twice with mm mops tris buffer . to load cells with ethidium bromide the cells were incubated in the same buffer supplemented with ethidium bromide and cccp by incubation at for min as previously described . cells were pelleted washed twice and resuspended at the same ice cold buffer . suspension was placed into a fluorometer cuvette and diluted fold with solutions indicated in each figure legend . because only _LOCATION_ acid bound ethidium bromide gives significant _METHOD_ efflux of ethidium bromide from the cells was determined as a _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ . measurement of berberine efflux was performed by a similar procedure with excitation at nm and emission at nm . the concentration of berberine for cell loading was . minimal inhibitory concentrations of heavy metals and drugs were determined by culturing cells in the lb broth containing a particular heavy metal or drug at various concentrations . aliquots of the culture were taken at different time points to measure the growth rates that were used to make a growth curve as indicated in figure legends . total rna was isolated fromarabidopsis seedlings by using the _PROTEIN_ reagent . of total rna was separated on denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel transferred to a hybond n nylon _LOCATION_ and hybridized with probes that were made from full length _PROTEIN_ cdna by random priming . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein was addressed by _METHOD_ fusion and confocal microscopy . the coding region of was fused to _METHOD_ coding region in binary vector _PROTEIN_ that contains the promoter followed by a short polylinker _METHOD_ coding region and the nopaline opine synthase terminator region . the _PROTEIN_ cdna without a stop codon was inserted into the polylinker region to form an in frame fusion with the _METHOD_ coding region . this construct was used to transform wild typearabidopsis plants by floral dip method . transformants were selected on murashige skoog medium containing sucrose agar and kanamycin and were propagated in the soil . seedlings were used to localize _METHOD_
