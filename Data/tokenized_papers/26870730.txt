boron is a metalloid that is essential for plant growth but is toxic when present in excess . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a borate exporter facilitating b translocation from root to shoot under limited b conditions . _PROTEIN_ shows stele side _PROTEIN_ localization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of various root cells presumably to support b translocation toward the stele . _PROTEIN_ is degraded under high b supply through _LOCATION_ sorting via ubiquitination at the residue to prevent the accumulation of b to a toxic level in shoots . a previous study showed that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus rna promoter improved the growth of arabidopsis under limited b conditions without affecting the growth under sufficient to excess b conditions . in this study we unexpectedly found that ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of a stabilized _PROTEIN_ variant improved tolerance to excess b in arabidopsis . we established transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused with hygromycin phosphotransferase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the ubiquitin promoter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in various cell types in leaves and roots and showed weak _PROTEIN_ localization in root tip cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was degraded through an endocytic pathway under high b conditions . transgenic plants with the stabilized variant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed improved root and shoot growth under excess b conditions . the concentration of b was greater in the shoots of plants with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ than in those of untransformed wild type plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ confers tolerance to excess b by excluding b from the _LOCATION_ of shoot cells . results from this study indicate the potential for engineering the trafficking properties of a transporter to produce plants that are tolerant to mineral stress .
in our attempt to develop a high throughput screening assay of mutants defective in _PROTEIN_ degradation we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused with hygromycin phosphotransferase _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus under control of the ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as a control we also established lines with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which the ubiquitination site required for b dependent _LOCATION_ sorting was substituted with alanine . to test whether these lines would be useful for screening based on hygromycin resistance we tested the growth of lines in solution culture with various concentrations of hygromycin and boric acid . our initial hypothesis was that the stabilized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant would show hygromycin resistance under high b conditions . we indeed observed hygromycin resistance of the transgenic lines compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however we unexpectedly found more drastic effects of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on plant tolerance to excess b conditions . therefore we decided to investigate the nature of the high b tolerance occurring as a result of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose we established three homozygous lines for each of the variants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to compare the pattern and the level of _PROTEIN_ among independent transgenic lines we performed imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using laser scanning confocal microscopy . in the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the epidermal cells of leaves and in the root hair zone and root tips in all cell types . these ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ patterns were similar to the previously reported _PROTEIN_ patterns of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . the intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were comparable in each established line . comparison of _PROTEIN_ levels and patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were grown on solid medium containing boric acid for days . the images were obtained by a laser scanning confocal microscopy at the same settings for the same tissues of independent lines . the intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of leaves the root hair zone and the root tips are shown as color coded heat maps . scale bars represent . we analyzed the intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ variants in more detail . compared to the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ toward the stele side _PROTEIN_ localizations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were less evident in epidermal cells in the meristem zone . to confirm the weak _PROTEIN_ localization of the variants the degree of _PROTEIN_ localization in the radial direction in roots was quantified by comparing the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ and which stain the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in transverse _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ domains of epidermal cells in the meristem zone . theoretically a _PROTEIN_ index > represents _PROTEIN_ localization toward the stele side while an index < represents _PROTEIN_ localization toward the soil side . in our previous study investigating the contribution of the evolutionarily conserved trafficking signals of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ index for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was while those for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were . these results indicate a weaker _PROTEIN_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ variants containing mutations in the tyrosine and dileucine based trafficking signals . in the cases of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ indexes in each of the two independent lines were _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localize on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with weak _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were grown on solid medium containing boric acid for days . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of the meristem zone . _METHOD_ and a merged image are shown . in the merged images the _METHOD_ and overlapping _METHOD_ signals appear in yellow . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in endodermal cells of the differential zone . _METHOD_ propidium iodide and a merged image are shown . ep epidermis co cortex en endodermis st stele . scale bars represent . we then examined the localization in the endodermis of the root hair zone where the _PROTEIN_ strip is developed . the _PROTEIN_ strip is a diffusion barrier of apoplasts that blocks free diffusion of solutes from the soil into the stele . the _PROTEIN_ strip also functions as a _LOCATION_ diffusion barrier to separate two domains of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the endodermis _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the weak _PROTEIN_ localization in other cell types _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was exclusively localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the stele side domain in the mature endodermis as was shown for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this was evidenced by the absence of _METHOD_ staining in the outer halves of transverse _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast propidium iodide a _LOCATION_ impermeable dye stained only the soil side of endodermal cells when applied from outside the roots . taken together _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed weak stele side _PROTEIN_ in the root tip cells but clear _PROTEIN_ in mature endodermal cells . we then examined the effect of the _PROTEIN_ fusion on the b dependent degradation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the endocytic pathway . transgenic plants were transferred from a low to sufficient boric acid condition for h and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in root epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ disappeared while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stably accumulated in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the and lines _PROTEIN_ to and respectively whereas those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the and lines remained at and respectively . dotty structures containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were detected after sufficient b supply for h . the dots co localized with which stains the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in the endocytic pathway . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was internalized into endosomes from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under high b conditions dependent on similar to the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we also grew transgenic plants on a medium containing boric acid for days . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detectable weakly in root tips and scarcely in leaf epidermis under this excess b condition while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was stably accumulated on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root cells and leaf epidermal cells . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ undergoes normal degradation by b dependent endocytosis while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stably accumulates in various cells under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . b dependent _LOCATION_ sorting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were grown on solid medium containing boric acid for days and then transferred to solid medium containing boric acid . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_

_PROTEIN_ lines were grown on solid media under low sufficient and excess b supply . the representative pictures of days old plants are shown in figure . the lengths of _PROTEIN_ roots and areas of shoots of days old plants and the fresh weights of shoots of days old plants were measured . at b supply the root growths of all transgenic plants were comparable to those of the untransformed wild type plants . however except for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line the fresh weights of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were significantly larger than wild type plants . these results indicate that ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ variants contributes to shoot growth under a low b condition . at b supply the primary root lengths and shoot fresh weights of all transgenic plants were comparable to those of the wild type . at and b supply the primary root lengths and shoot fresh weights of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were comparable to those of wild type plants while those of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were significantly longer and heavier respectively than those of wild type plants . the root lengths of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were more than two fold longer than those of the wild type plants . the fresh weights of shoots were more than three and five fold heavier than those of the wild type at and b supply respectively . consistently the shoot areas of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were more than two and four fold larger at and b supply respectively than those of the wild type plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ greatly improves the tolerance of both root and shoot growth under excess b conditions . growth of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under a range of boric acid concentrations . wild type and

determined . means sd are shown . asterisks indicate a significant difference compared with wild type col under the same conditions by student 's t test . to investigate the _METHOD_ underlying the low and excess b tolerance of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ variants we quantified the concentration of b in roots and shoots of plants grown with and boric acid . at and b the concentration of b in the shoots of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly greater than that in the wild type col plants . however the concentration of b in the roots was not largely different among the wild type and transgenic plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ promotes b translocation toward the shoot under low to excess b conditions . under the excess b condition the order of the shoot b concentration from highest to lowest was as follows _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines and the wild type . this tendency was associated with the accumulation levels of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ variant proteins in roots under the excess b condition . the higher rate of b translocation in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines than in the wild type was likely due to the detectable accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the root cells in spite of the down regulation by endocytosis and degradation . taken together ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ variants resulted in higher b translocation into shoots and also rendered an ability to withstand high b concentrations . it is likely that the stable accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ prevented b accumulation in the sensitive _LOCATION_ by b exclusion to the leaf apoplast thereby supporting the growth of shoots under excess b conditions . b concentrations in roots and shoots of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . b concentrations in the roots and aerial portion of the plants were determined after growth on solid media

col wild type arabidopsis thaliana heynh . was obtained from our laboratory stock . plants were grown on vertically placed solid media in which the boric acid concentrations were adjusted . the solid media contained sucrose and gellan gum . surface sterilized seeds were sown on solid media and incubated for days at and then at under a h h dark cycle in a growth chamber . the shoot area was measured on the pictures using the color range selection tool in photoshop . fragments of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ nost were amplified by pcr using a plasmid containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively as templates . the primers used were as follows for atgattacgaattcgagtctagctcaacagagctt and aaaagtctcttccatggctgttaatcagaaaaactc for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atgattacgaattcgcacgacgttgtaaaacgacg and ttcaggctttttcatctt gtacagctcgtccatgc for _PROTEIN_ nost gacgagctgtac aagatgaaaaagcctgaactcac and ggccagtgccaagct ctattcctttgccctcgg . the pcr products containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ nost were cloned into the saci and hindiii sites of using an in fusion hd cloning kit resulting in and respectively . the inserted dna fragments were confirmed by sequencing . to generate transgenic arabidopsis the plasmids were used for transformation of col by the agrobacterium mediated floral dip method _PROTEIN_ . for selection of transformants the solid media contained half strength murashige skoog salt sucrose agar and mg bialaphos . transgenic plants were selected by resistance to bialaphos . the bialaphos resistant plants were transferred onto solid media supplemented with boric acid and grown for days . we then observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in roots and shoots under an _METHOD_ microscope and selected and plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ respectively with relatively strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities . in the progenies of the plants segregation of hygromycin resistance was examined and six lines each that were expected to carry a single t dna insertion were selected . in the progenies of the plants segregation of hygromycin resistance was examined and three lines each were established as homozygous plants . three lines of each variant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were used for _PROTEIN_ and growth analyses and two lines of each variant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with good germination rates in the generation were used for determination of b concentrations . laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a leica tcs _METHOD_ equipped with an hcpl apo water immersion lens with the following excitation and emission wavelengths nm and nm for _METHOD_ nm and nm for and nm and nm for propidium iodide . was prepared as a mm stock solution in water . propidium iodide was prepared as a mg stock solution in water . plants were transferred from solid to liquid medium containing the dye or inhibitors and incubated at room temperature . the _PROTEIN_ localizations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were determined by a method described previously . the _PROTEIN_ index is a ratio of _METHOD_ intensity at the stele side and soil side halves of transverse _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the root epidermis . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were obtained using laser scanning confocal microscopy . was used to stain the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ index was calculated as the ratio of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity to that of _METHOD_ at the stele side divided by that at the soil side . the b dependent degradation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was examined by quantification of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were obtained using laser scanning confocal microscopy . the intensity of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stained by was measured . image j and metamorph software were used to quantify the _PROTEIN_ localization and b dependent degradation respectively . plants were grown on solid media . the shoots and roots of plants were harvested and directly transferred into polypropylene tubes . the tissues were dried in an air incubator at for more than h and the dry weights were measured . the tissues were digested with ml of nitric acid in a tube at in a degiprep apparatus _PROTEIN_ until complete dryness . the residues were dissolved in nitric acid and filtered before analysis . concentrations in the samples were determined by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . total b concentrations in the sample were calculated based on natural abundance of b isotopes . previous studies indicated that the ratio of b isotopes does not change during the transport in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . binary comparisons between the wild type and the transgenic lines were performed using student 's t test .
