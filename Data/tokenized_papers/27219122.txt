the small molecule _METHOD_ piperidine ylmethanethione was recently shown to trigger signal transduction via early effector triggered immunity signaling genes including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana accession col . chemical genetic analyses of a. thaliana natural variants identified the plant resistance protein like receptor _PROTEIN_ nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat protein _PROTEIN_ as required for _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest . here a chemical genetic screen for mutants which disrupt _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest in the col accession identified new mutant alleles of the _PROTEIN_ nb lrr gene _PROTEIN_ . one allele _PROTEIN_ carries a _PROTEIN_ to asp mutation in the walker a domain supporting an important function of the _PROTEIN_ nucleotide binding domain in _METHOD_ responses consistent with _PROTEIN_ acting as a canonical resistance protein . the essential nucleo cytoplasmic regulator of _PROTEIN_ nb lrr mediated effector triggered immunity _PROTEIN_ was reported to have both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic actions in pathogen resistance . _METHOD_ was used to investigate the requirements for subcellular _PROTEIN_ localization in _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions engineered to localize _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm or the _LOCATION_ by tagging with a _LOCATION_ export signal or a _LOCATION_ localization signal respectively were tested . we found that wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and both the nes and nls tagged _PROTEIN_ variants were induced by _METHOD_ treatments and fully complemented _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in root responses to _METHOD_ suggesting that enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in either compartment could confer _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest . we further found that a light and dependent modification of _METHOD_ is necessary to mediate _METHOD_ signaling in roots . chemical analyses including liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and high resolution atmospheric pressure chemical ionization _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identified a _METHOD_ modification product that is likely responsible for bioactivity mediating root growth arrest . we propose a chemical structure of this product and a possible reaction mechanism for _METHOD_ modification .
natural variation in the _PROTEIN_ locus and t dna insertion mutants were used initially to identify and characterize functions of _PROTEIN_ . although t dna insertion lines represent a powerful tool to study full gene loss of function defects they rarely contribute to a better understanding of the protein structure . approximately individuals from different parental groups of an _METHOD_ mutagenized population were screened using the _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest as a readout . in the initial screen _METHOD_ insensitive individuals were isolated . the identified _METHOD_ insensitive mutants were backcrossed to the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line and subsequently investigated for allelism in the generation using the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest assay . three mutants that fell into the same _PROTEIN_ linked complementation group were backcrossed to col wild type plants and investigated in detail by sequencing the entire _PROTEIN_ locus of the resulting individuals to test for functionally crucial amino acids in _PROTEIN_ . as shown in a _PROTEIN_ protein schematic three independent point mutations in the _PROTEIN_ gene were identified and characterized . the first _METHOD_ mutant _PROTEIN_ carries a glycine to aspartic acid mutation in the conserved nucleotide binding site of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nb lrr protein . gly is part of the walker a motif or p loop that has the general consensus sequence . since the adjacent lysine residue in the walker a motif is needed to coordinate and phosphates of the bound ntp and indispensible for activation of resistance proteins the loss of this highly conserved glycine in _PROTEIN_ is predicted to diminish adp/atp binding to the nb domain and hydrolysis . a overview and amino acid changes in three newly isolated _METHOD_ mutants in the _PROTEIN_ locus . b _METHOD_ point mutants in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed insensitivity to _METHOD_ similarly to t dna mutant _PROTEIN_ whereas the wild type col control was fully arrested in root growth assays . the black horizontal bars mark the root tip position when plants were exposed to _METHOD_ . the vertical grey bars separate the indicated genotypes grown on the same plate for clarity . c quantitative analyses of root growth assays shown in b . with _METHOD_ all three _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ point mutants and _PROTEIN_ showed a similar _METHOD_ insensitivity compared to the their growth in _METHOD_ . wild type col showed a strong inhibition in root growth upon _METHOD_ treatment . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively the mutations were in a non conserved portion of the protein c terminal to the lrr domain . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations were located at two of the few positions which vary between _PROTEIN_ and its closest homologue _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ valine is replaced by leucine which is the amino acid at the same position in _PROTEIN_ . the third _METHOD_ mutagenized line _PROTEIN_ had a mutation close to the end of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . this mutation results in an arginine to histidine exchange . in our earlier studies we documented protein protein interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and that _METHOD_ triggered _PROTEIN_ mediated root growth arrest requires _PROTEIN_ function . in line with this finding _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibit _METHOD_ insensitivity in roots and leaves . to expand on these results showing interdependency we tested _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type controls . interestingly we found that full induction of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ requires _PROTEIN_ . however significant residual _PROTEIN_ transcript induction was detectable in _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ induction does not exclusively depend on _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a nucleo cytoplasmic protein . experiments employing the pseudomonas syringae bacterial pathogen as a trigger of _PROTEIN_ dependent eti or basal immunity suggested that nucleo cytoplasmic trafficking through the _LOCATION_ pore complex is important for full pathogen resistance in leaves . we utilized _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines nes and nes that _PROTEIN_ functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to a c terminal _LOCATION_ export sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this fusion caused _PROTEIN_ to accumulate _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm of leaf cells and produced intermediate pathogen resistance in leaves . as controls a line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to a mutated inactive nes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also tested . these conferred full pathogen resistance in leaf assays . in a complementary approach _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines nls and nls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ high and low amounts respectively of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to a c terminal _LOCATION_ localization signal which targets _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ were examined . all transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ under the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . with these transgenic materials we investigated whether cytoplasmic or _LOCATION_ enrichment of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alters the efficiency of the _METHOD_ triggered root growth arrest response . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the cytoplasm or the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was observed previously in confocal live cell _METHOD_ imaging and biochemical fractionation experiments performed on leaf tissues . because _METHOD_ triggers growth arrest in roots we performed _METHOD_ imaging of root cells to verify the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs . notably a _METHOD_ signal for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was barely detectable in untreated roots . application of _METHOD_ for h led to a strong increase in the _METHOD_ signal in roots including meristematic and elongation zones _METHOD_ . this observation is consistent with _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation upon _METHOD_ exposure found in whole seelings and the same _METHOD_ induction was seen in all tested _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mislocalized lines . to verify the _METHOD_ based results on _METHOD_ induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root tissues we carried out qpcr analyses and confirmed that _PROTEIN_ gene transcription is increased by _METHOD_ treatments in a dose dependent fashion . _PROTEIN_ was also found to be upregulated in shoot tissues in response to _METHOD_ . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in the root of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls in _PROTEIN_ . all transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals increased after hours of _METHOD_ application compared to the non treated controls . scale bar applies to all images . confocal gain and pinhole parameters were identical in all six images . at least plants were observed for _METHOD_ treated condition . b c both nes or nls tagged _PROTEIN_ protein versions _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ were capable of complementing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in _METHOD_ mediated primary root growth arrest . seven day old seedlings were exposed to _METHOD_ . three days after treatment two independent lines of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls showed the same _METHOD_ sensitivity as wild type col and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ control . a mutated control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes also showed a similar sensitivity to _METHOD_ . means with different letters are grouped based on two way _PROTEIN_ and tukey s test p < . _LOCATION_ bars represent sd _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . representative plants are shown in . the black horizontal bars mark the root tip position when plants were exposed to _METHOD_ . the vertical black bars separate the indicated genotypes grown on the same plate for clarity . wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ of root cells . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in line nes exhibited _METHOD_ signals predominatly in the cytoplasm . a clear reduction in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ from root cells including the root meristemic zone elongation zone and differentiation zone of nes . an opposite pattern was observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in nls lines and _PROTEIN_ in which _METHOD_ was detected in _LOCATION_ of root cells . as expected the control line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes exhibited _METHOD_ signals in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ of root cells . together these findings suggest that subcellular localization of _METHOD_ induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be modulated in roots . we found that both nes tagged and nls tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins fully complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant in response to _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes lines and _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest responses were equivalent to those of wild type col and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing significant root growth arrest at d after exposure to _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes control line also exhibited root growth arrest in response to _METHOD_ treatment . as observed in earlier studies the _PROTEIN_ mutant without _PROTEIN_ transgenes was insensitive to _METHOD_ treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also showed a wild type like response . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ can trigger effectively _METHOD_ triggered root growth arrest when directed to the cytoplasmic or _LOCATION_ compartments of root cells . previously _METHOD_ was shown to cause a rapid root growth arrest of primary roots in col wild type plants . this effect is dependent on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are also needed to regulate cell death at pathogen infection sites . to obtain further insights into the _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest root cell viability of _METHOD_ treated tissues was investigated using fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ staining . the green _METHOD_ signal of fluorescein an _PROTEIN_ metabolite is a positive indicator for cell viability . when day old col wild type seedlings were exposed to _METHOD_ containing media with increasing concentrations from to for hours _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals from root tip tissues _PROTEIN_ in a _METHOD_ concentration dependent manner compared to non treated controls . _METHOD_ concentrations above led to a strong _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal reduction . a root cell viability of col root tissues _PROTEIN_ as concentrations of _METHOD_ increased . wild type seedlings were exposed to the indicated concentrations of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ for hours and cell viability was visualized by staining with fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ dye . b _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ was measured in root tips exposed to different concentrations of _METHOD_ from to . _LOCATION_ c roots of the _METHOD_ insensitive ler accession and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings exhibited a marginal _PROTEIN_ in cell viability staining after exposure to _METHOD_ for hours . constant gain and pinhole parameters were used for all images . _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient for _METHOD_ triggered primary root growth arrest . because of the absence of a functional _PROTEIN_ allele in the landsberg _LOCATION_ accession ler accession seedlings showed _METHOD_ insensitivity to a similar extent to the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant . ler seedlings exposed to _METHOD_ exhibited a marginal _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ signal compared to mock treated wild type ler control . similarly in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signals were mildly reduced after exposure to _METHOD_ . these results suggest that in the presence of a functional _PROTEIN_ locus _METHOD_ application causes reduced cell viability which correlates with _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest . similar to many other compounds from commercial chemical libraries _METHOD_ represents a colored sparingly aqueous soluble nonpolar substance that is solubilized in a _METHOD_ stock solution . research on storing conditions of screening compounds has revealed that prolonged storage of organic substances even in _METHOD_ may result in a partial chemical degradation of the substance . this effect is _PROTEIN_ due to _METHOD_ slowly reacting with certain classes of chemical compounds or slowly decomposing in the presence of water organic or inorganic acids and strong oxidizing agents . inevitably these effects are not limited to the storage process but might also occur during bioassays when the _METHOD_ dissolved screening compounds are mixed with aqueous solutions . at concentrations higher than in aqueous buffers _METHOD_ is insoluble and can be detected by the occurrence of scatter and yellow cloudiness in the dilution . moreover in analyses of the stability of _METHOD_ we found that after hours at room temperature our freshly prepared working dilutions in water lost their typical yellow color . interestingly if an aliquot from the same original dilution was protected from light a less pronounced loss of color was detectable visually . a after hours in the light a clear loss of the yellow color can be detected in an aqueous _METHOD_ solution . b uv vis absorbance scans of _METHOD_ solution . the fresh solution exhibits a characteristic maximum peak at around nm . this peak was absent if the solution was kept in the light for hours . less pronounced decay was observed if the solution was protected from light . c the bioactivity of _METHOD_ is dependent on the presence of light . no growth arrest was found if roots were treated for hours with _METHOD_ in the dark while col wild type plants treated with _METHOD_ in the presence of light exhibited root growth arrest . after hours of _METHOD_ treatment seedlings were retransferred to _METHOD_ without _METHOD_ to recover and days after retransfer the image was taken . black horizontal bars indicate the primary root lengths at the time of retransfer . the black vertical bar separates two groups with different light treatments prior to retransferring to the same plate for recovery . d _PROTEIN_ staining of week old seedlings treated with _METHOD_ for hours . cell viability was significantly reduced only if light was present in combination with _METHOD_ . asterisk stands for p < . this observation was confirmed by ultraviolet visible spectral scans . in the case of a fresh _METHOD_ solution a characteristic maximum absorbance peak at around nm was detected . if the solution was exposed to light this peak disappeared and the solution turned colorless . less pronounced _PROTEIN_ in the absorbance and a broader peak were measured for dark stored samples . to test whether the light and solvent dependent conversion has an impact on the bioactivity of _METHOD_ independent experimental procedures were designed . first a rescue of root growth arrest assay was performed . as shown earlier a temporary exposure of col wild type seedlings to _METHOD_ for as little as hours is sufficient to induce a complete root growth arrest . intriguingly if plants were treated with _METHOD_ in the dark for h wild type roots did not show a root growth arrest . thus after rescue of seedlings to a _METHOD_ plate without _METHOD_ wild type roots that had been exposed to _METHOD_ in the dark continued to grow and were indistinguishable from _METHOD_ insensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . however if plants were exposed to _METHOD_ in the same condition but in the presence of light a significant root growth arrest was observed in wild type col . in addition a well plate reader assay was established to quantify the _METHOD_ induced _PROTEIN_ in cell viability . for this experiment day old col seedlings were treated with _METHOD_ for hours either in the presence or absence of light . afterwards an _PROTEIN_ staining was performed and _METHOD_ signals were analyzed . as shown in only when _METHOD_ was applied in combination with light a clear _PROTEIN_ in cell viability was detected . the cell viability in the presence of light was also lower compared to _METHOD_ incubation in the dark . the light dependent _METHOD_ conversion raised the question after _METHOD_ loses its yellow color in the presence of light whether this colorless _METHOD_ derived solution would _PROTEIN_ its bioactivity . to test this hypothesis col wild type arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to _METHOD_ containing plates in the light . after hours when the _METHOD_ growth medium became colorless one half of the seedlings were left on the same _METHOD_ medium plates and the other half was re transferred to a fresh _METHOD_ medium . re transfer was repeated every hours for four consecutive days . images were taken days after the first transfer for both re transfer and single transfer groups . the condition with the single transfer to the _METHOD_ medium reflects the previously used assay . while both _METHOD_ conditions mediated irreversible primary root growth arrest _PROTEIN_ root growth as well as shoot growth was further strongly compromised in the re transfer group . _METHOD_ tolerant _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ growth of primary roots in both experiments . these data indicate that although light exposure is required for _METHOD_ bioactivity in root tissues prolonged exposure to light in _METHOD_ containing _METHOD_ growth media _METHOD_ to reduce _METHOD_ bioactivity eventually . a transfer of wild type col plants to _METHOD_ medium one time inhibited primary root growth while _PROTEIN_ roots could elongate further . images were taken days after the first transfer . _METHOD_ insensitive _PROTEIN_ was used as a control . b prolonged exposure to fresh _METHOD_ by re transferring seedlings daily for days resulted in further inhibition of growth in _PROTEIN_ roots and leaves in wild type . wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ control medium one time or every hours for days . the black horizontal bars indicate the primary root lengths at the time of first transfer to _METHOD_ . primary and _PROTEIN_ roots of _PROTEIN_ grew normally in all cases similarly to non treated controls . c lengths of col and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots in b were measured and shown as frequency distribution . n plants per experiment . d _PROTEIN_ roots of col plants in were swollen and bent similar to typical _METHOD_ for primary roots treated with _METHOD_ . scale bar applies for both images . as previously described under the single _METHOD_ treatment _METHOD_ triggered growth arrest is observed in primary roots of col wild type seedlings while _PROTEIN_ roots elongated even longer than arrested primary roots . however when seedlings were re transferred to a fresh _METHOD_ plate every hours for days secondary root growth was also severely inhibited as well as the primary root growth . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants did not show growth arrest of either primary or _PROTEIN_ roots under all conditions of _METHOD_ application . the tips of compromised col _PROTEIN_ roots in became swollen and bent into a hook shaped structure resembling primary roots exposed to _METHOD_ . these observations suggest that _METHOD_ effects are not limited to primary root growth arrest as assumed earlier but also inhibit _PROTEIN_ root growth . in an effort to gain insights into the observed _METHOD_ modification process the components of an aqueous _METHOD_ solution were monitored by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after being exposed to light over a period of and min . in general _METHOD_ ionized well in electrospray ionization and exhibited a distinct relative absorption peak with the retention time of around min where the wavelength of maximum absorption observed was nm . this distinct peak allowed for relative quantification of _METHOD_ at defined time points . consistent with earlier uv vis spectra after incubation in the light condition at room temperature for only minutes a significant reduction in the characteristic peak of _METHOD_ was detected . after incubation for min the _METHOD_ peak both in the uv and extracted ion chromatogram was completely absent . interestingly as the characteristic peak of _METHOD_ disappeared from the solution a corresponding new peak appeared at a much shorter retention time of around min indicating the formation of a new compound with increased _PROTEIN_ . this new peak whose is nm exhibited poor ionization in esi and also had a different uv chromatogram compared to _METHOD_ . however when the _METHOD_ working solution was stored in the dark no noticeable _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ peak was observed after incubation for min and the aforementioned more _PROTEIN_ peak was not detected even after incubation times as long as minutes . _METHOD_ in aqueous solutions gave a distinct absorption peak in non treated control sample . a this peak declined after and min _METHOD_ solution incubation in the light . at the same time a second peak was detected which accumulated over time in the light . b if the same solution was incubated in the dark the _METHOD_ peak continued to decline but more slowly over time . no secondary metabolite was detected in the absence of light . the effect of molecular oxygen on the modification process of _METHOD_ was evaluated by creating oxygen enriched and depleted environments in aqueous solutions of _METHOD_ . in the samples enriched in acceleration in the degradation of _METHOD_ was observed as well as the production of the unknown _PROTEIN_ metabolite . _METHOD_ was at the detection limit of the lc _METHOD_ after only min and undetectable at min . in dark treated samples that were also enriched with no strong _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ peak or production of the _PROTEIN_ metabolite was observed after min . however due to the low solubility of _METHOD_ in aqueous buffers _METHOD_ precipitated from the solution over time also explaining the loss in absorbance in the uv vis spectrum . these results suggest that both light and are necessary for the modification of _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ represents a closely related _METHOD_ derivative that completely lacks bioactivity . the chlorination pattern on the phenyl _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ is different from _METHOD_ where _METHOD_ has a dichlorophenyl versus the dichlorophenyl in _METHOD_ . a shifted position of chlorine compared to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ critical to the lack of ability of _METHOD_ to elicit root growth arrest . therefore _METHOD_ was included as a control to evaluate the stability of _METHOD_ under the same conditions . although _METHOD_ decomposed in aqueous solution and lost its yellow color on a similar time scale as _METHOD_ there was no detectable accumulation of a derived product . as observed for _METHOD_ also dark treated _METHOD_ was found to be stable as revealed by its persistent hplc peak . the absence of a derived product both in the _METHOD_ solution that was incubated in the dark and in the _METHOD_ solutions prompted additional investigations to identify the unknown substance as it may be responsible for the observed bioactivity in the root growth assay . high resolution atmospheric pressure chemical ionization _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses of the modified product of _METHOD_ gave a at m/z indicating a molecular formula of . interestingly it only varies from _METHOD_ by the addition of and loss of sulfur . furthermore comparison of the uv data for _METHOD_ and this modified product revealed significant modification in the conjugated double bond system of _METHOD_ as there was a shift in absorption from to nm respectively . based on these findings and the increased _PROTEIN_ of the modified product compared to _METHOD_ we propose a potential structure and mechanism for this modified product . according to our model molecular oxygen reacts with the furan _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ in a light induced diels alder type reaction forming an endoperoxide . this peroxide may then degrade similarly to that involved in ozonolysis of an olefin forming the compound presented in . all attempts to isolate and enrich this modified product to test its bioactivity by pursuing root bioassays on plant seedlings failed likely as a result of the compound s inherent instability .
