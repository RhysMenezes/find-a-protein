the plant hormone auxin is a key regulator of plant growth and development . auxin levels are sensed and interpreted by distinct receptor _METHOD_ that activate a broad range of cellular responses . the auxin binding _PROTEIN_ that has been identified based on its ability to bind auxin with high affinity is a prime candidate for the _LOCATION_ receptor responsible for mediating a range of auxin effects in particular the fast non transcriptional ones . contradictory genetic studies suggested prominent or no importance of _PROTEIN_ in many developmental processes . however how crucial the role of auxin binding to _PROTEIN_ is for its functions has not been addressed . here we show that the auxin binding pocket of _PROTEIN_ is essential for its gain of function cellular and developmental roles . in total different _PROTEIN_ mutants were prepared that possessed substitutions in the metal core or in the hydrophobic amino acids of the auxin binding pocket as well as neutral mutations . their analysis revealed that an intact auxin binding pocket is a prerequisite for _PROTEIN_ to activate downstream components of the _PROTEIN_ signalling pathway such as rho of plants and to mediate the clathrin association with _LOCATION_ for endocytosis regulation . in planta analyses demonstrated the importance of the auxin binding pocket for all known _PROTEIN_ mediated postembryonic developmental processes including morphology of leaf epidermal cells root growth and root meristem activity and vascular tissue differentiation . taken together these findings suggest that auxin binding to _PROTEIN_ is central to its function supporting the role of _PROTEIN_ as auxin receptor .
the auxin binding protein _PROTEIN_ was identified decades ago in different plant species with subsequent characterization of its structure by crystallization and detection of the auxin binding pocket . nevertheless little is known about the significance of the auxin binding for the cellular functions and developmental roles of _PROTEIN_ . to address this question a series of mutations were generated . single amino acids important for the formation of the auxin binding pocket were mutated based on the known crystal structure . given the conserved stability of the barrel fold and the selected amino acid substitutions the overall protein structure would probably not be compromised . as the metal core _METHOD_ to be most important for the auxin binding two disrupting _PROTEIN_ variants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were prepared . the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ variant targets the same amino acid as that already described in the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . additionally we mutagenized seven largely hydrophobic amino acids that play a role in the stabilization of the indole or aromatic _PROTEIN_ of the auxin molecule . seven single and three double mutants were generated to evaluate their role in the _PROTEIN_ activity and to test the hypothesis that auxin binding is necessary for the _PROTEIN_ activity . as a negative control four random amino acids outside the binding pocket were chosen and mutation variants were prepared _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these _PROTEIN_ mutant variants were then evaluated for their impact on the cellular and developmental roles of _PROTEIN_ . next we tested the ability of the auxin binding pocket mutants to activate downstream signalling processes . as the rho _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to be activated within a few minutes by the _PROTEIN_ dependent auxin signalling leading to translocation of the interacting partners _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the pm arabidopsis protoplasts were cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and with the corresponding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs possessing different mutations . of the protoplasts transfected with the wild type _PROTEIN_ showed no _PROTEIN_ activation manifested by the _METHOD_ signal remaining predominantly intracellular . however after short auxin treatment _PROTEIN_ was activated and translocated to the pm . in the _PROTEIN_ auxin binding mutant variants _PROTEIN_ activation was highly reduced particularly in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ variants in which up to and of the cells for and respectively still had a _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization . in the other _PROTEIN_ mutant variants with mutations in hydrophobic amino acids that are responsible for the interaction with indole or aromatic _PROTEIN_ of auxin molecules we observed a slight increase of in the proportion of cells with a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ localization but never as high as in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the neutral mutant variants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not differ in the _PROTEIN_ translocation when compared to wild type _PROTEIN_ protein . hence the mutations in the auxin binding pocket interfere with the _PROTEIN_ capability to activate/translocate the _PROTEIN_ protein . the most important amino acid residues are those that reside in the metal core . seven mostly hydrophobic amino acids interacting with indole or aromatic _PROTEIN_ of auxin molecules play a rather minor role in this process . regulation of the clathrin mediated endocytosis is one of the rapid auxin effects ascribed to the _PROTEIN_ function . auxin via _PROTEIN_ inhibits endocytosis of some pm residing proteins including internalization of _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carriers . by this mechanism auxin is supposed to regulate its own transport out of cells . for evaluation of the effect of the _PROTEIN_ auxin binding mutations on _PROTEIN_ internalization we cotransfected bright yellow tobacco suspension cultured cells with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs containing different mutations and analysed the amount of cells showing _PROTEIN_ internalization . wild type _PROTEIN_ promotes endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ from the pm and consistently more than of cells had severely internalized _PROTEIN_ . this process was largely inhibited by addition of auxin when over of cells showed no or very weak internalization . when by cells were cotransfected with the _PROTEIN_ construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization was promoted to the same extent as with wild type _PROTEIN_ construct however auxin treatment was completely ineffective in inhibiting _PROTEIN_ internalization . similarly we analysed other _PROTEIN_ variants such as _PROTEIN_ or versions bearing mutations in the hydrophobic residues . all these mutant variants promoted _PROTEIN_ internalization but showed _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to the inhibitory auxin effect albeit not complete auxin resistance as observed for the _PROTEIN_ construct . in contrast none of the neutral mutations outside the binding pocket showed changes in the _PROTEIN_ internalization rate after auxin treatment when compared to the control . notably only a very small amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was internalized in the absence of the _PROTEIN_ cotransfection suggesting the importance of both auxin bound and auxin unbound _PROTEIN_ for endocytosis . altogether the _PROTEIN_ with or without the intact auxin binding pocket was crucial for _PROTEIN_ internalization but the auxin mediated inhibitory effect on this process required the intact auxin binding pocket the metal core being the most critical part . next we planned to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant variants in arabidopsis to complement the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant allele which has been reported to cause slow proliferation reduced cell elongation cell division and embryo lethality . the phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were reported to be rescued by the _PROTEIN_ overexpression construct . we used the same approach and via agrobacterium mediated transformation we introduced several different constructs into the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutant . however we did not achieve an _PROTEIN_ complementation with any of our constructs i.e . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ since by genotyping we still confirmed the presence of a functional wild type _PROTEIN_ allele in all progenies . in our subsequent attempt the native _PROTEIN_ promoter was used to bring the _PROTEIN_ to a level similar to that in planta . we used two versions of the native promoter a long one _PROTEIN_ and a short one . we screened more than three independent lines with an _PROTEIN_ lower than higher than or equal to that of the wild type . none of these variants were able to rescue the mutant phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ allele . the same negative result was observed when the native promoter with the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence and the untranslated region were cloned together in one piece and transformed into the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous line . taken together we were unable to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes with any prepared construct which precluded us to analyse the importance of auxin binding pocket for the _PROTEIN_ developmental roles in planta in the absence of the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele . to test the effect of auxin binding mutations on endocytosis in arabidopsis we introduced all the above mentioned constructs into the arabidopsis col background via agrobacterium mediated transformation . most experiments were carried out with the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line because this construct showed the most severe auxin insensitivity in protoplast and by assays . three independent lines with _PROTEIN_ levels similar to that of _PROTEIN_ were chosen for the analysis . as a control the _PROTEIN_ line was used with the corresponding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level with phenotypes similar to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . the fungal toxin brefeldin a is a useful tool to investigate _PROTEIN_ trafficking and endocytosis . bfa treatments lead to the accumulation of internalized _PROTEIN_ proteins in pronounced intracellular called bfa bodies because bfa inhibits preferentially the recycling of _PROTEIN_ proteins to the pm . _PROTEIN_ protein immunodetection in the wild type treated with bfa led to accumulation of _PROTEIN_ proteins in bfa bodies . auxin can inhibit this internalization and stabilizes _PROTEIN_ proteins at the pm . in _PROTEIN_ roots the bfa induced _PROTEIN_ internalization was slightly higher than of the wild type . this difference was less pronounced as compared to previous work because a different quantification method was used . instead of counting the number of bfa bodies per cell the signal at the pm and in the intracellular part was measured . as shown before internalization of _PROTEIN_ to bfa bodies was almost completely inhibited by auxin in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ line . in contrast the inhibitory effect of auxin on the bfa body formation was much less pronounced in the _PROTEIN_ line as manifested by the presence of pronounced _PROTEIN_ containing bfa bodies . in addition we tested peo iaa an auxin analogue that inhibits endocytosis but does not activate auxin mediated transcriptional responses . _PROTEIN_ immunodetection in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpression seedlings cotreated with peo iaa and bfa inhibited _PROTEIN_ internalization similarly to auxin . in contrast _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed a persistent presence of bfa bodies after cotreatment with peo iaa and bfa . similar observations were made when seedlings were cotreated with bfa and auxinole which is an auxin analogue with structure and function similar to those of peo iaa . these results revealed that wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant variant are much less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of auxin and its analogues on _PROTEIN_ internalization . _PROTEIN_ proteins are internalized by the endocytic machinery that involves the coating protein clathrin . _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator in clathrin recruitment and association with the pm and thus promotes endocytosis . we investigated the auxin effect on levels of the _LOCATION_ associated clathrin heavy chains by using anti chc antibodies . in the wild type trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosomes and pm associated chc signals increased after auxin treatment . the intensity of the chc signal at the pm and tgn/ee was higher than that of the mock controls . interestingly the chc signal at the pm and tgn/ee increased in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line already without auxin treatment and the increase after the auxin treatment was not as pronounced as in the wild type . in contrast in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line the chc signal did not increase and the line was also resistant to auxin treatments . altogether our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulates the clathrin heavy chain association with the pm and tgn/ees and that the _PROTEIN_ auxin binding site is important for this role . another prominent cellular auxin effect is the change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ to require both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signalling as manifested by the basal to outer _PROTEIN_ relocation of _PROTEIN_ in the cortex and basal to inner _PROTEIN_ relocation of _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis of arabidopsis roots after auxin treatment . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ proteins occurred after of auxin treatment the _PROTEIN_ to basal signal ratio of _PROTEIN_ in endodermis increased up to and up to for _PROTEIN_ in the cortical cell layer . the _PROTEIN_ involvement is noticeable by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line already without any auxin treatment . this phenotype could not be enhanced by additional auxin treatments . in contrast overexpression of _PROTEIN_ did not cause any _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that occurred only after auxin treatment possibly due to the presence of the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele in the col background and also due to the involvement of the second auxin signalling pathway . hence the auxin mediated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ and the ability of auxin to bind the _PROTEIN_ molecule is a crucial part of this regulation . it has been proposed that _PROTEIN_ takes part in many important developmental processes . among others it mediates the auxin dependent pavement cell interdigitation . the number of lobes in pavement cells increased up to after auxin treatment in the wild type or in seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line . in contrast in the _PROTEIN_ auxin binding mutant _PROTEIN_ the number of lobes in pavement cells did not change even after auxin treatment . seedlings overexpressing the wild type _PROTEIN_ had a reduced root length _PROTEIN_ root meristem size increased _PROTEIN_ root number and defects in cotyledon vasculature when compared to the wild type . these lines also showed a _PROTEIN_ in apical dominance resulting in more branching . all these aberrant phenotypes were significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . altogether these observations suggest that the _PROTEIN_ auxin binding pocket is crucial for performing its gain of function developmental roles .
