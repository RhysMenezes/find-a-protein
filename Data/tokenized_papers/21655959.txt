in plants the mevalonic acid pathway provides precursors for the formation of triterpenes sesquiterpenes phytosterols and primary metabolites important for cell integrity . here we have cloned the cdna encoding enzymes catalysing the final three steps of the mva pathway from madagascar periwinkle mevalonate kinase _PROTEIN_ phosphomevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase . these cdna were shown to functionally complement mva pathway deletion mutants in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae . transient transformations of c. roseus cells with yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused constructs reveal that pmk and mvd are localised to the _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ was _LOCATION_ . these compartmentalisation results were confirmed using the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ pmk and mvd sequences fused to _METHOD_ . based on these observations and the arguments raised here we conclude that the final steps of the plant mva pathway are localised to the _LOCATION_ .
until now the c. roseus cdna sequences encoding _PROTEIN_ pmk and mvd have not been isolated and characterised . thus partial cdna encoding mva pathway candidate genes were isolated from c. roseus cdna using degenerate primers as described in supplementary methods . the sequences of the and extremities were determined by pcr and genomewalker . the full length cdna sequences were named crmvk crpmk and crmvd . the crmvk cdna encoded a protein of amino acids in length with a calculated _METHOD_ of kda . crmvk possesses strong similarity with _PROTEIN_ from dicotyledons such as hevea brasiliensis and a. thaliana . the similarity with _PROTEIN_ from monocotyledons such as oryza sativa and zea mays is lower and identity respectively . furthermore crmvk possesses identity with the ortholog present in the moss physcomitrella patens subsp . patens and identity with the yeast _PROTEIN_ and identity with the human and rat _PROTEIN_ . the crpmk cdna encoded a protein of amino acids in length with a calculated _METHOD_ of kda . as with crmvk crpmk possesses strong similarity with orthologs from h. brasiliensis and a. thaliana . the protein also shows lower similarity with orthologs from maize rice p. patens and from s. cerevisiae . however plant pmks are very different from mammalian pmks and can not be considered orthologs . the crmvd cdna encoded a protein of amino acids in length with a calculated _METHOD_ of kda . in plants several _METHOD_ of mvd exists including two in a. thaliana . crmvd has identity with and identity with _PROTEIN_ . crmvd has strong similarity with orthologs from h. brasiliensis maize rice and p. patens . finally lower similarities are observed with yeast mvd and the mammalian mvds . the similarity of the deduced amino acid sequence of the three identified cdnas with the amino acid sequences from the plant orthologs of the mva pathway can be seen in supplementary fig . and . yeast complementation method was previously used to characterise several cdnas from the mevalonate pathway . first riou et al . functionally characterised _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana and cordier et al . characterised the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . more recently the same technique was used to functionally characterise aact _PROTEIN_ and pmk from h. brasiliensis . it is now well characterised that in the yeast s. cerevisiae the mva pathway remains the unique source of the ipp precursor for the biosynthesis of _LOCATION_ an essential fungal terpenoid . gene disruption of enzymes involved in mva branch is thus lethal in yeast . as a consequence a complementation assay was performed using a haploid strain lacking a single allele of each target gene to validate the function of the cloned c. roseus cdnas . in this study we used the full length coding sequences of crmvk crpmk and crmvd . it remains unknown at this time if the enzymes of the mva pathway in yeast are peroxisomal . however it should be noted that the _PROTEIN_ pmk and mvd of s. cerevisiae contain _PROTEIN_ related nonapeptides . diploid heterozygous s. cerevisiae colonies carrying mva plasmids or empty vector were plated onto sporulation medium and haploid colonies were recovered . no haploid cells harbouring both the disrupted allele and the empty control plasmid were obtained suggesting that the empty is unable to complement the saccharomyces _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ disrupted alleles . a yeast strain carrying both _LOCATION_ disrupted allele and the plasmid crmvk _LOCATION_ could grow on ypg _PROTEIN_ medium but not on the non _PROTEIN_ medium ypd . this indicated the crmvk had mevalonate kinase activity and could complement the _LOCATION_ disrupted allele . the activities of crpmk and crmvd were determined in the same way . a yeast strain carrying both _LOCATION_ disrupted allele and plasmid crpmk _LOCATION_ and a yeast strain carrying both _PROTEIN_ disrupted allele and plasmid crmvd _PROTEIN_ could grow on ypg medium but not on ypd medium showing that these two c. roseus cdnas were able to complement their respective s. cerevisiae alleles . moreover all haploid transformed strains harbouring both a wild type allele and the plasmid borne c. roseus cdna _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were able to grow on both ypg and ypd medium . finally haploid transformed cells were plated onto foa containing medium to test the ability of each strain to lose their plasmid . none of the haploid disrupted strains harbouring the plasmid borne c. roseus cdna _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ could grow on a foa containing medium confirming that these strains were not able to lose their plasmid . in contrast all haploid transformed strains harbouring both a wild type allele and the plasmid borne c. roseus cdna _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were able to grow on foa containing medium confirming that they were able to lose their plasmid . all these results clearly indicate that crmvk crpmk and crmvd display _PROTEIN_ pmk and mvd activity respectively . the deduced amino acid sequences of crmvk and atmvk _PROTEIN_ were analysed for the existence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ motifs . the n terminus of crmvk and of atmvk was shown to contain the sequence kiilageha which _METHOD_ to the _PROTEIN_ consensus sequence . crmvk and atmvk were cloned into psca cassette _METHOD_ vector to create _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ contructs . in vivo localisation of crmvk and atmvk was determined through a biolistic mediated transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fused protein in c. roseus cells according to guirimand et al . . in transiently transformed cells crmvk _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ crmvk showed a diffuse pattern of _METHOD_ coinciding perfectly with the _METHOD_ signal of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ gus marker arguing thus for a _LOCATION_ localisation . similarly atmvk _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ atmvk were also exclusively localised in the _LOCATION_ . it has previously been postulated that the human pmk is predominantly localised in the _LOCATION_ . this peroxisomal targeting is dependent on the presence of a _PROTEIN_ located at the c terminal end of mammalian pmks . on the contrary no such _PROTEIN_ could be found within the amino acid sequences of crpmk or atpmk as well as no _PROTEIN_ consensus sequences . however the _PROTEIN_ related nonapeptide dvk _PROTEIN_ was identified in several plant pmks including crpmk and atpmk although its role in peroxisomal targeting has yet to be determined . this prompted us to engage the study of the subcellular localisation of both crpmk and atpmk . in c. roseus cells the _METHOD_ crpmk fusion protein showed a diffuse pattern of _METHOD_ characteristic of the _LOCATION_ as revealed by the merging with the _METHOD_ signal of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ gus marker . however in the opposite orientation leaving the crpmk n terminal end accessible crpmk _METHOD_ displayed a punctuated _METHOD_ pattern which perfectly co localised with the _METHOD_ pattern of the peroxisomal marker . _LOCATION_ appear as round or elongated particles distributed randomly in the cytoplasm . the peroxisomal localisation of crpmk was confirmed using atpmk _METHOD_ which was also shown to co localise with the peroxisomal marker . these results indicate that the crpmk and atpmk proteins contain a putative _PROTEIN_ that could mediate their targeting to _LOCATION_ . the n terminal end of numerous plant mvds also contains a _PROTEIN_ related nonapeptide which can be found in crmvd and in the two a. thaliana mvd _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and . this nine amino acid sequence is similar to the amino acid motif svtlhqdql previously identified in the mammalian mvd and required to target the protein to _LOCATION_ . as a consequence we have also investigated the subcellular localisation of crmvd and _PROTEIN_ in c. roseus cells . the fusion protein engaging the n terminal end of mvd displayed a _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal whilst the fusion proteins crmvd _METHOD_ and atmvd _METHOD_ which leave the n terminal extremity accessible showed a punctuate _METHOD_ distribution superimposable over that of the peroxisomal marker . these results reveal that crmvd and _PROTEIN_ are also targeted to _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that a diffuse pattern of _METHOD_ is also apparent in figs . i i suggesting that a portion of the pmk _METHOD_ and mvd _METHOD_ fusion proteins remained in the _LOCATION_ . similar observations could be made for the localisation of the short version of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ enzyme since transfected tobacco protoplasts display a strong punctuate peroxisomal pattern and a weakly diffuse pattern that could be associated with the _LOCATION_ .
