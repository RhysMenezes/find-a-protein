the exoribonucleases and _PROTEIN_ function in the degradation and processing of several classes of rna in saccharomyces cerevisiae . is the _PROTEIN_ enzyme catalyzing cytoplasmic mrna degradation in multiple decay pathways whereas _PROTEIN_ functions in the processing of rrnas and small nucleolar rnas in the _LOCATION_ . much less is known about the xrn like proteins of multicellular eukaryotes however differences in their activities could explain differences in mrna degradation between multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes . one such difference is the lack in plants and animals of mrna decay intermediates like those generated in yeast when is blocked by poly tracts that are inserted within mrnas . we investigated the xrn family in arabidopsis thaliana and found it to have several novel features . first the arabidopsis genome contains three xrn like genes that are structurally similar to _PROTEIN_ a characteristic unique to plants . furthermore our experimental results and sequence database searches indicate that orthologs may be absent from higher plants . second the lack of poly mrna decay intermediates in plants can not be explained by the activity of the atxrns because they are blocked by poly tracts . finally complementation of yeast mutants and localization studies indicate that two of the atxrns likely function in the _LOCATION_ whereas the third acts in the cytoplasm . thus the xrn family in plants is more complex than in other eukaryotes and if an xrn like enzyme plays a role in mrna decay in plants the likely participant is a cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ ortholog rather than an ortholog .
to identify xrn like sequences of arabidopsis we conducted a search of the genbank database for sequences similar to . portions of three chromosomal sequences tac bac bac and two ests and contained sequences highly similar to . the two ests correspond to the xrn like gene present on tac . analysis of the entire sequence of the est revealed an orf highly similar to as well as to _PROTEIN_ . due to its greater similarity to _PROTEIN_ the protein encoded by was designated _PROTEIN_ . cdnas corresponding to the remaining xrn like sequences were obtained by cdna library screening and rt pcr as described in materials and methods . the protein encoded by the cdna corresponding to the xrn like gene on bac was designated _PROTEIN_ and the protein encoded by the cdna corresponding to the xrn like gene on bac was designated _PROTEIN_ . by comparing amino acid sequences it is possible to distinguish between like and _PROTEIN_ like proteins because members of the like class have a _PROTEIN_ terminal domain specific to this class . the atxrns lack this _PROTEIN_ terminal domain . an additional characteristic of like class is the closer spacing of the four n terminal most conserved regions relative to that of the _PROTEIN_ like class . the spacing of these n terminal conserved regions in the atxrns is most like members of the _PROTEIN_ like class . based on these sequence features we classified the atxrns as _PROTEIN_ orthologs . additional experiments were carried out to identify sequences from arabidopsis and other plant species that were more similar to than to _PROTEIN_ however no evidence for like sequences in plants was obtained . low stringency southern blots using the _PROTEIN_ cdna as a probe did not indicate the presence of additional xrn like genes in arabidopsis other than those reported here . because is highly _PROTEIN_ in yeast we anticipated that an ortholog from arabidopsis might also be highly _PROTEIN_ and be abundant in a cdna library . however the screening of the _PROTEIN_ library used to clone the _PROTEIN_ cdna did not result in the isolation of any like sequences . furthermore anti antibodies did not indicate that an ortholog is present in arabidopsis . similarly heyer et al . reported that anti antibodies did not crossreact with protein extracts from cauliflower whereas such antibodies crossreacted with proteins from schizosaccharomyces pombe and mus musculus _METHOD_ known to have like proteins . finally extensive searches of sequence databases have not yielded evidence for an like gene in arabidopsis or any other plant species . the absence of like sequences from the arabidopsis genome over of which has been sequenced and from the variety of sequences available from other plant species makes it unlikely that orthologs are present in higher plants . the ends of the atxrn cdnas including a portion of the orfs and untranslated regions are not conserved and were used to generate gene specific probes to study the _PROTEIN_ of the atxrns using northern blots . these probes were able to specifically recognize the individual atxrn genes on southern blots . as seen in fig . fig ref all three atxrn transcripts were detected in roots leaves _METHOD_ and flowers . the levels of the atxrn transcripts were similar to each other relative to the control . the enzymatic activity of the atxrns could explain the absence of poly stabilized mrna decay intermediates in plants . the simplest explanation could be that the xrn like enzymes of plants can progress directly through poly tracts degrading poly containing mrnas to completion . to examine this possibility and to determine whether the atxrns were functional as exoribonucleases the activity of each of the atxrns on poly mrnas was tested through heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ from a multicopy plasmid in wild type and yeast strains . these strains _PROTEIN_ two poly containing mrnas _PROTEIN_ and under the control of the _PROTEIN_ upstream activating sequence . for each gene two transcripts full length and poly intermediate were readily detected in rna gel blots from wild type yeast . in contrast little or no poly intermediate accumulated for either reporter transcript in cells as previously observed . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the cells resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in the abundance of the full length reporter mrnas and in an increase in the accumulation of the poly intermediates for both reporter transcripts . this result indicates that all three atxrns function as exoribonucleases which are able to degrade mrnas and that they are blocked by poly tracts when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . therefore the absence of poly stabilized mrna decay intermediates in plant cells is unlikely due solely to an atxrn progressing through poly tracts . all three of the atxrns are structurally more similar to _PROTEIN_ than to indicating that they may have a _LOCATION_ function as does _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is encoded by an essential gene and cells harboring a temperature sensitive allele rapidly arrest growth at the nonpermissive temperature . the function of _PROTEIN_ required for cell viability is unknown but is thought to be exoribonuclease activity within the _LOCATION_ . coupled with our observation that the atxrns have exoribonuclease activity when _PROTEIN_ in yeast successful complementation of would imply _LOCATION_ localization in yeast cells . the atxrn yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmids were introduced into the strain and the growth of the transformants on solid medium was monitored . _PROTEIN_ of the atxrns did not alter the growth of the strain at the permissive temperature . at the nonpermissive temperature _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the strain restored growth albeit to a lesser extent than the _PROTEIN_ control . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ likely entered the _LOCATION_ and replaced the essential function of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ did not rescue the growth arrest of the strain indicating that it likely did not enter the yeast _LOCATION_ . complementation of indicated that the atxrns likely differ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ targeting and therefore might differ with respect to _LOCATION_ localization sequences . the atxrns are about identical to each other in the regions encompassing the xrn family conserved domains however _PROTEIN_ lacks about amino acids present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain an obvious bipartite nls beginning at amino acid . the bipartite nls is a well characterized motif that targets proteins to the _LOCATION_ in plants and other eukaryotes and consists of two basic regions separated by a variable spacer . the n terminal domain of the nls in also conserved in _PROTEIN_ but as a result of the sequence deletion the c terminal region of this nls is absent . if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ was not this localization would explain the atxrns differential ability to complement and could indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a cytoplasmic function . to examine this possibility an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ and characterized first in yeast and subsequently in plant cells . the rnase activity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was confirmed by its ability to generate a poly stabilized mrna decay intermediate when _PROTEIN_ in cells and like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not complement . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited two _PROTEIN_ patterns uniform cytoplasmic _METHOD_ and spots that varied in both size and number . the uniform _METHOD_ was distributed evenly across the yeast cells but appeared to be excluded from the _LOCATION_ . exclusion from the _LOCATION_ is illustrated by the cells within the box where a region without _METHOD_ corresponds to dapi stained _LOCATION_ dna . similarly the spots did not correspond to the _LOCATION_ . although we can not rule out that some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may enter the _LOCATION_ these results indicate that the most likely reason for the inability of _PROTEIN_ to complement is due to its exclusion from the _LOCATION_ . to examine the intracellular location of the atxrns in plant cells atxrn _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment . as expected based on successful complementation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed high _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ an _PROTEIN_ pattern similar to the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ nia protein . in addition to a general _LOCATION_ localization _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in bright spots within the _LOCATION_ which may represent the nucleoli . as an ortholog of _PROTEIN_ of yeast _PROTEIN_ may also function in rrna processing and could be targeted to this subnuclear region . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells revealed a _LOCATION_ localization . in contrast to the intense _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared more similar to _METHOD_ gus a protein known to accumulate in the cytoplasm . in addition similar to its _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated as both uniform _METHOD_ and as spots that were not detected within the _LOCATION_ . because the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spots may have been cytoplasmic inclusions we tested whether lowering _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ would diminish the number of spots . as seen in fig . fig refb _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reducing the amount of dna used in the bombardment resulted in a reduction in the number and size of the spots . a higher magnification shows uniform _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the reduction in the number of spots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus reducing the amount of dna _PROTEIN_ the number and size of the spots while not effecting the cytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
the _PROTEIN_ sequence tag which contained the entire _PROTEIN_ orf was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _METHOD_ . the end of a cdna clone for _PROTEIN_ was isolated by using the internal saci to clai fragment of as a probe to screen the _PROTEIN_ library . the end of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained by rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ using as a template cdnas generated from day old arabidopsis seedlings grown on plates containing murashiga and skoog medium and sucrose . these template cdnas were produced with a marathon _PROTEIN_ kit _PROTEIN_ . the primers used for amplification were the marathon _PROTEIN_ primer and an _PROTEIN_ cdna specific primer _PROTEIN_ . the full length _PROTEIN_ sequence was constructed by ligation of _PROTEIN_ product and partial cdna . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was generated by reverse transcription pcr and _PROTEIN_ using the above described seedling cdnas as template . the end of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained with _PROTEIN_ and cccgaagccgcaccagtagagga the end with cccataccattatgctcc and _PROTEIN_ . the full length _PROTEIN_ sequence was constructed by ligation of and rt pcr products into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ to generate . the sequences of all pcr products were determined and matched the corresponding genomic sequences . all of the studies in yeast used derivatives of the shuttle vector with the atxrn cdnas inserted between the bamhi and sali sites . these plasmids were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . yeast strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ generously provided by dr. roy parker were used to study the activity of the atxrns on poly mrnas as described . yeast strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ generously provided by dr. charles cole _METHOD_ were used to study complementation . over night liquid cultures of transformants were diluted to a similar and streaked on duplicate plates one plate was incubated at and the other at for days . total rna from most tissues was isolated as described in from arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia grown in soil for days under standard conditions . the root tissue was harvested from seedlings grown on murashiga and skoog medium for days . the gene specific probes used were the xhoi to noti fragment of _PROTEIN_ the xbai to noti fragment of _PROTEIN_ and the xhoi to noti fragment of _PROTEIN_ . the orfs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr and inserted into the ncoi site of for studies in onion epidermal cells . the correct sequence of all pcr products was verified . the primers used were ccatggaactgttttgggagg and ccatgggtgtaccgtcgtttt for _PROTEIN_ and ggaatccgccatgggagtaccggc and ccatggacaagtttgcacctgc for _PROTEIN_ . for localization studies in yeast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ in from a derivative containing an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . transformed cells were grown overnight at the permissive temperature diluted to an similar to that used for complementation and photographed with a kodak camera and a zeis axiophot _METHOD_ microscope using appropriate filters . treatment with ethanol was used to facilitate diamidino phenylindole staining and did not effect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . bombardment of onion epidermal cell layers was carried out as described with the exception that gold particles were used and the amounts of dna were as indicated in fig . fig ref . the plasmids used were _METHOD_ gus and pava _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transformed onion epidermal layers were incubated on plates containing murashiga and skoog medium and sucrose for h in the dark and then photographed as described above .
