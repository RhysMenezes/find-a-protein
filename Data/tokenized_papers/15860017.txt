autophagy is a process that is thought to occur in all eukaryotes in which cells recycle cytoplasmic contents when subjected to environmental stress conditions or during certain stages of development . upon induction of autophagy double _LOCATION_ bound structures called autophagosomes engulf portions of the cytoplasm and transfer them to the _LOCATION_ or lysosome for degradation . in this study we have characterized two potential markers for autophagy in plants the _METHOD_ dye monodansylcadaverine and a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and propose that they both label autophagosomes in arabidopsis . both markers label the same small apparently _LOCATION_ bound structures found in cells under conditions that are known to induce autophagy such as starvation and senescence . they are usually seen in the cytoplasm but occasionally can be observed within the _LOCATION_ consistent with a function in the transfer of cytoplasmic material into the _LOCATION_ for degradation . mdc staining and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein can now be used as very effective tools to complement biochemical and genetic approaches to the study of autophagy in plant _METHOD_ .
to analyze the potential for using mdc as a marker for autophagy in plants arabidopsis suspension cells were sucrose starved for or h to induce autophagy . starved cells or non starved controls were stained by incubation with mdc for min at room temperature followed by washing with phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ to remove excess dye and observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . in the control cells very little staining was observed with only weak staining of the cell wall and/or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at all time points . in contrast after h of starvation cells displayed strong staining of moving spherical structures within the cell . the size of the structures varied and often large and small stained structures could be seen within the same cell however their average size increased by h of starvation . most of the structures were seen in the cytoplasm but occasionally they appeared to be present within the _LOCATION_ suggesting that they may eventually be delivered to the _LOCATION_ . the number of cells with mdc staining _PROTEIN_ after h possibly due to an increase in cell death at _PROTEIN_ starvation time points although the cells that did stain frequently contained a large number of stained structures compared with the and h time points . small mdc stained structures were only occasionally seen in the control non starved cells and these structures were less intensely stained smaller and in much fewer number than in the starved samples . larger structures were never seen in the control cells . the presence of mdc stained structures predominantly in starved cells suggests that mdc stains autophagosomes in arabidopsis as it does in mammalian cells . autophagosomes are thought to be acidic compartments and mdc staining specificity in mammals is derived partly from this property . to further characterize the arabidopsis mdc stained structures sucrose starved suspension cells were pre incubated with mm ammonium chloride for min to neutralize the lumenal ph prior to mdc staining . this treatment significantly inhibited mdc staining with the average number of autophagosomes visible per cell cross section reduced approximately fold at and h starvation time points . ammonium chloride treatment does not prevent autophagosome formation as a _METHOD_ fusion with the homolog _PROTEIN_ still labels autophagosomes after treatment . this indicates that an acidic lumen is required for labeling with mdc providing further evidence that mdc specifically labels autophagosomes in arabidopsis . interestingly at h starvation ammonium chloride was less effective at inhibiting mdc staining . at this time point autophagosomes were still labeled with mdc in the presence of ammonium chloride although staining was much weaker than in its absence . extensive cell death occurs after h sucrose starvation of suspension cells potentially by autophagic or type ii programmed cell death . our results indicate that there may be a change in the structure or lipid composition of autophagosomes at this _PROTEIN_ stage concurrent with a switch from cell survival to cell death . _METHOD_ of mdc stained suspension cell samples was measured by uv _METHOD_ spectroscopy to determine if the difference in signal between starving and non starving cell samples could be used as a quantitative measure of autophagy . cells were stained and washed as described above and the _METHOD_ relative to control cells was determined per gram of fresh weight . the _METHOD_ intensity increased more than twofold after h of starvation . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ slightly after h of starvation and _PROTEIN_ again after h but remained significantly above the h levels . _METHOD_ levels in the non starvation control samples did not differ between the time points . the _METHOD_ intensity of the starving and control samples correlates with the number of mdc staining cells and intensity of mdc staining as determined by microscopy . these data suggest that _METHOD_ spectroscopy measurement of mdc stained cells can be used as a rapid semiquantitative assay to determine the extent of autophagy in plant suspension cells . the mdc stained structures in starved suspension cells varied in size and movement . smaller structures showed a rapid and apparently directional movement around the cell while larger structures moved much more slowly typically vibrating in place . the speed of the smaller mdc stained structures in h sucrose starved suspension cells was measured by determining distance traveled over a period of time . these small spheres moved across the cell with an average speed of approximately comparable in speed with the movement of organelles such as _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . previous yeast and mammalian studies have shown that and its orthologs specifically localize to autophagosomes and therefore make excellent markers for autophagosomes . the arabidopsis genome encodes nine potential orthologs at least seven of which are _PROTEIN_ . one of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ shows increased _PROTEIN_ by affymetrix genechip analysis during sucrose starvation making it a good candidate for an autophagosomal marker in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ increase was verified in suspension cells after and h of sucrose starvation by rt pcr and by northern blot hybridization using a gene specific probe . _PROTEIN_ showed an increase in transcript level after and h of sucrose starvation compared with low rna levels in the and h control samples . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were also determined for whole arabidopsis plants . one week old seedlings were subjected to either nitrogen or _PROTEIN_ starvation . seedlings were harvested after or days of starvation and total rna was extracted for northern blot analysis . in control seedlings _PROTEIN_ transcript levels remained low . transcript levels increased slightly after or days of nitrogen starvation whereas a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ was seen upon sucrose starvation . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct was used to transiently transform protoplasts made from arabidopsis suspension cells . protein was extracted from transformed cells after incubation in the presence or absence of sucrose and the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein between insoluble and soluble fractions was determined as yeast is associated with the autophagosome _LOCATION_ . insoluble protein was separated from soluble protein by centrifugation and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ of whether the protoplasts were starved or not the majority of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was found in the insoluble fraction while only a small amount was in the soluble fraction indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ may be _LOCATION_ associated . in contrast _METHOD_ alone was found mostly in the soluble fraction under the same conditions . to further confirm the _LOCATION_ association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were incubated for days in the presence or absence of sucrose . lysed protoplast extracts were loaded onto a sucrose step on top of a sucrose cushion and _LOCATION_ separated by centrifugation onto the cushion . immunoblotting using _METHOD_ antibodies revealed that in the starved samples the majority of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present at the top of the sucrose cushion indicating that it is likely to be _LOCATION_ associated . in contrast in the presence of sucrose some _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was seen at the cushion but the majority of the protein was found above the cushion in the load and upper sucrose fraction . little protein was found below the sucrose interface in either case . as a control an integral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was found almost entirely on top of the sucrose cushion . these results demonstrate that at least a portion of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with _LOCATION_ and that a larger fraction is _LOCATION_ bound in starved cells than in non starved cells . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy after h of sucrose starvation . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with moving spherical structures of varying size and speed similar to the structures found during mdc staining of protoplasts and suspension cells . at very high levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ these structures could not be seen and instead the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found throughout the cytoplasm the amount of plasmid was therefore adjusted to allow moderate _PROTEIN_ levels . in non starved cells non motile aggregates of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and distinct structures were not visible . these results indicate that in arabidopsis as in other _METHOD_ the homolog _PROTEIN_ can be used as a marker for autophagy . to confirm that mdc specifically stains autophagosomes in arabidopsis as it does in mammalian cells protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were sucrose starved for h followed by staining with mdc . in suspension cell and leaf protoplasts _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mdc staining colocalized to small moving structures that were absent in non starved controls . single labeling controls confirmed that there is no bleed through of signal between filters . the rapid movement of the autophagosomes was problematic for imaging in many cases the autophagosomes moved slightly while changing filters . however observation of many different protoplasts with double labeling confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mdc do in _PROTEIN_ label the same structures . we conclude that the mdc stained vesicles are likely to be autophagosomes and that both mdc and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ can be used as markers for autophagy in arabidopsis . to clarify the location of the autophagosomes within the cell protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were starved of sucrose for h followed by staining with the _METHOD_ dye . binds to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is taken up into cells by endocytosis eventually reaching the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after several hours of incubation . it can therefore be used as a _METHOD_ marker for the tonoplast . starved protoplasts internalized the more slowly than non starved protoplasts presumably because of a _PROTEIN_ rate of endocytosis . however after h of incubation staining of the tonoplast could be seen by confocal microscopy . to confirm that the was taken up by endocytosis rather than non specific staining of dying cells starved cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also stained with for h on ice to prevent uptake . the stained the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these cells but no internal staining was observed indicating that internalization in the starved protoplasts is an active _LOCATION_ trafficking process and the cells are still viable at this time . while most of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled structures were present in the cytoplasm occasionally they were seen inside the _LOCATION_ this was confirmed by taking a z series through the protoplast . this suggests that the autophagosomes present in the cytoplasm are eventually delivered to the _LOCATION_ for degradation . interestingly the autophagosomes within the _LOCATION_ were labeled with in addition to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whereas those in the cytoplasm were not . it appears that prior to or upon uptake into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived from endosomes or the tonoplast is incorporated into the autophagosomes . in mammalian cells autophagosomes can fuse with endosomes prior to their final fusion with lysosomes and it is possible that this also occurs in plant protoplasts . ideally for an autophagosome marker to be most useful it should work as a reporter for autophagy in intact plants as well as suspension cells and protoplasts . to determine whether mdc can be used to stain autophagosomes in whole plants day old arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to nutrient starvation . seedlings were transferred to medium lacking sucrose and grown in the dark to induce sucrose starvation followed by staining with mdc . roots were observed using _METHOD_ microscopy after or days of starvation . the day roots displayed only weak staining of the cell wall and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after days of sucrose starvation mdc _METHOD_ signal increased and mdc stained motile structures were visible in the cytoplasm of cells along the length of the root except for the cells of the root tip . after days of sucrose starvation mdc staining was more intense . the size and _METHOD_ intensity of the moving structures increased and the structures were more abundant throughout the root including the root tip . control seedlings grown in the light or on sucrose containing plates did not contain mdc stained vesicles . alternatively seedlings were transferred to medium lacking nitrogen and stained with mdc after or days . similar results were seen as for sucrose starved seedlings indicating that autophagy can be induced in arabidopsis roots by either sucrose or nitrogen starvation . the autophagy genes and _PROTEIN_ are both required for the proper timing of senescence in arabidopsis as knockout mutants show a premature senescence phenotype . however the cellular basis for this phenotype is unclear and the extent to which autophagy is involved in the senescence process is not known . to provide insight into the role of autophagy in leaf senescence detached arabidopsis leaves were incubated in the dark for days to initiate senescence and protoplasts were isolated from this senescing tissue . the induction of senescence was confirmed by the increase in _PROTEIN_ of two senescence associated genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after days of dark incubation . the protoplasts were stained with mdc and viewed using _METHOD_ microscopy . a similar pattern of mdc staining was observed in the senescent protoplasts as in protoplasts after starvation with motile stained autophagosomes visible that were absent in protoplasts from freshly detached leaves . these data suggest that autophagy is induced in detached senescing leaves at an early time point before visible signs of senescence such as loss of chlorophyll are evident .
