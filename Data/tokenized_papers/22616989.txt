comparative phosphoproteomics of arabidopsis chloroplasts . serine phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is independent of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kinases . phosphorylation of thr in the _PROTEIN_ protein is strictly _PROTEIN_ dependent . _PROTEIN_ is distributed between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and chloroplast nucleoid . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated at thr is excluded from the nucleoid .
to make a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis we isolated chloroplasts from the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants of arabidopsis and extracted proteins by acid . the proteins were digested by trypsin phosphorylated peptides were enriched by tio chromatography and analyzed using lc _METHOD_ we isolated chloroplasts from leaves harvested during the middle of the day as well as in the end of the dark phase of the photoperiod . in four biological replicas of the wild type plants we found phosphopeptides from chloroplastic proteins listed in . the largest group of the identified peptides originated from proteins located within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ but we also found phosphorylated peripheral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ stroma proteins as well as proteins predicted to be located in the envelope _PROTEIN_ . the major difference between the samples from the leaves harvested during day and night was in the _PROTEIN_ that the n terminal peptide ac rktvakpk from lhcii proteins was phosphorylated only during the day while rubisco activase was found phosphorylated only during the night . all phosphorylated peptides listed in have been identified from the wild type arabidopsis leaves in the earlier studies . however our comparative phosphoproteomic analysis revealed two previously unknown _PROTEIN_ . first we found that a serine phosphorylation of several lhcii proteins was not dependent on either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and it was found from both day and night harvested leaves . second phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ dependent . finding of lhcii phosphorylation that does not depend on either light or the _PROTEIN_ protein kinase was really surprising . the well described phosphorylation of lhcii at the threonine residues see also does not occur in darkness or in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . bioinformatics analysis identifies phosphorylated serine residue in several _METHOD_ of lhcb proteins . in the _PROTEIN_ proteins this residue is situated at the position of the initial translation product . in the _PROTEIN_ and in the _PROTEIN_ proteins this serine residue correspond to amino acid and respectively . in the mature lhcii proteins this serine residue is located amino acid residues downstream from the phosphorylated threonine . notably in several experiments we also found alternative phosphorylation of other serine residues in the same peptide while phosphorylation of ser was predominant . the function of this phosphorylation is unknown as well as the nature of the responsible protein kinase . at present we can state that the serine phosphorylation of lhcii does not depend on the _LOCATION_ kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the sequence around this residue does not correspond to the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation motif . in the mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ we did not find five phosphorylated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ dependent phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ has been known only from in vitro study and we provide the evidence for similar in vivo phosphorylation of this protein . _PROTEIN_ dependent phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has also been reported . however our finding of the _PROTEIN_ protein phosphorylation exclusively in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is novel . the sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ peptide maps the phosphorylated threonine to position in the initial translation product of this protein . extensive lc _METHOD_ analyses of the samples from the four different genotypes identified pronounced signals corresponding to this phosphorylated peptide only in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ . the phosphorylated thr had earlier been found in the large scale phosphoproteomic analysis of arabidopsis which also identified additional phosphorylated sites in _PROTEIN_ . however phosphorylated ser ser thr and thr had been detected only in out of biological replicas analyzed in this original study and we did not detect them in our preparations as well . bioinformatics analysis of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ predicts a kda protein with a residues long chloroplast transit peptide . the n terminal part of the mature protein contains a rossmann fold motif _PROTEIN_ which could be found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins with nucleotide binding abilities . the c terminal half of the protein is however specific to plant _PROTEIN_ polypeptides . this plant specific domain of _PROTEIN_ also harbors the phosphorylated thr that is well conserved among different plants . comparison of the amino acid sequences containing threonine residues phosphorylated in _PROTEIN_ dependent manner reveals a valine residue present in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this is the only exact sequence identity found in the vicinity of phosphorylation sites of these four proteins which are not phosphorylated in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ had been found in preparations of transcriptionally active chromosomes . it also co migrated with the _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ after size exclusion chromatography of megadalton complexes from the chloroplast stroma of arabidopsis . however the study of _PROTEIN_ protein composition did not find _PROTEIN_ as a core _PROTEIN_ subunit and recent proteomic analyses of maize chloroplasts identified _PROTEIN_ in both nucleoid and _LOCATION_ of mesophyll chloroplasts and proplastids . its distribution pattern was similar to the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins believed to anchor dna to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the authors proposed a similar role for _PROTEIN_ . to examine the localization of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts we generated an antibody specific to this protein . immunoblotting analysis with this antibody identifies a kda band in the crude preparation of arabidopsis chloroplasts . after fractionation of chloroplasts into soluble stroma and initial _LOCATION_ pellet _PROTEIN_ was found only in the pellet . since _PROTEIN_ does not have any predicted transmembrane domains we tried to wash away the protein from the initial _LOCATION_ fraction using increasing concentrations of nabr . however even after the treatment with m nabr and centrifugation a significant amount of _PROTEIN_ was still found in the _LOCATION_ fraction . at the next step we made solubilization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by a detergent nonidet p . this treatment of the initial _LOCATION_ pellet resulted in complete solubilization of _LOCATION_ confirmed by _PROTEIN_ specific antibody . nevertheless of _PROTEIN_ was still present in the white pellet suggesting an interaction of this protein with something else besides the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a potential nucleotide binding domain and it was also found associated with transcriptionally active chromosome . thus we decided to treat the initial _LOCATION_ pellet with dnase . treatment with only dnase was not enough to release _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ fraction . however when dnase treatment was combined with nonidet p solubilization we were finally able to release all _PROTEIN_ from the pellet fraction . the combined set of immunoblotting data shown in suggests distribution of _PROTEIN_ between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and chloroplast nucleoid . we isolated two arabidopsis mutant lines with t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . neither of these lines had visible phenotypic difference from wild type when grown under normal conditions . we also isolated chloroplast nucleoids from the wild type and one of the mutants using the earlier described procedure . the proteins from these nucleoid preparations were then separated on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ after in gel digestion with trypsin . the nucleoid proteins including _PROTEIN_ identified in our analysis are indicated in a . the list of the sequenced peptides from these proteins is presented in . at the difference from the wild type nucleoids from the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not contain _PROTEIN_ . this was the only difference observed from the _METHOD_ stained gel indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not essential for nucleoid formation and composition . immunoblotting analyses with the _PROTEIN_ specific antibody also confirmed the absence of this protein in the mutant . treatment of the isolated nucleoid from the wild type with dnase resulted in almost complete removal of both dna detected by etidium bromide staining and _PROTEIN_ detected with immunoblotting from the final pellet after the second ultracentrifugation . our experimental data provide evidence for distribution of _PROTEIN_ between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and chloroplast nucleoid . in order to investigate the distribution of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ between these fractions we analyzed phosphoproteome of the nucleoid isolated in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor naf . the nucleoid proteins were digested by trypsin phosphorylated peptides were enriched by tio chromatography and analyzed using lc _METHOD_ . surprisingly we did not detected phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ in any of the three biological replicas of isolated nucleoid while it was detected in all four biological replicas in the phosphoproteomic analysis of the chloroplast proteins extracted by acetic acid . spectral counts analysis presented in c show the absence of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ in the nucleoid fraction although _PROTEIN_ was an abundant protein in this sample . in all biological replicas of the nucleoid fraction we found phosphorylated peptides from two nucleoid associated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these proteins were found phosphorylated only in one and two biological replicas of the acetic acid extracts respectively indicating lower abundance in these preparations . on the contrary the phosphorylated peptide gpsgspwygsdr from _PROTEIN_ the marker of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was found exclusively in the acetic acid extracts like the phosphorylated peptide from _PROTEIN_ . a recent mapping of nucleoid associated proteins found that _PROTEIN_ had a similar distribution pattern as the dna anchoring protein _METHOD_ . the dna binding ability of _METHOD_ is inhibited by phosphorylation of _METHOD_ by _PROTEIN_ . our finding that phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ is excluded from the nucleoid fraction suggests a possible similar inhibition of _PROTEIN_ binding to dna upon the _PROTEIN_ dependent phosphorylation . isolation of nucleoids from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed a small but reproducible relative increase in the amount of immunodetected _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ nucleoids . these results are in line with the data presented in c which show that the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated peptide was not found in the nucleoid of the wild type . our comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of arabidopsis chloroplasts from the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed that phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ protein at thr depends on the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein kinase . _PROTEIN_ is the light regulated enzyme activated by reducing compounds in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and it is also involved in regulation of chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ . our data support the earlier suggestion that _PROTEIN_ could anchor dna to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and we propose that _PROTEIN_ dependent phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ may affect the _LOCATION_ interaction of nucleoid .
