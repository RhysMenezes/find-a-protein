the higher plant shoot apical meristem is a dynamic structure continuously producing cells that become incorporated into new leaves _METHOD_ and flowers . the _PROTEIN_ of a constant flow of cells through the meristem depends on coordination of two antagonistic processes self renewal of the stem cell population and initiation of the _PROTEIN_ organs . this coordination is stringently controlled by gene networks that contain both positive and negative components . we have previously defined the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene as a key negative regulator of cell accumulation in arabidopsis shoot and floral _METHOD_ because mutations in _PROTEIN_ cause the enlargement of inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ the production of supernumerary flowers and floral organs and a delay in floral meristem termination . here we show that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates the size of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ organizing center in inflorescence _METHOD_ . we have cloned the _PROTEIN_ gene and find that it encodes a small protein containing a b box like motif and a sand domain a dna binding motif previously reported only in animal transcription _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and its arabidopsis paralog _PROTEIN_ define a novel small gene family in plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ coordinately in embryonic shoot apical _METHOD_ in inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ and in developing stamens carpels and ovules . additionally _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in vegetative _METHOD_ and leaf primordia . _PROTEIN_ protein can compensate for mutant _PROTEIN_ protein when overexpressed in an _PROTEIN_ background indicating that the two genes may regulate a common set of targets during plant development . downregulation of both _PROTEIN_ genes can lead to shoot apical meristem arrest shortly after germination revealing a requirement for _PROTEIN_ activity in early development .
previous analysis of the _METHOD_ induced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles revealed an increase in inflorescence and floral meristem size leading to the production of supernumerary flowers and floral organs . to determine the molecular basis of the _PROTEIN_ meristem enlargement we performed in situ experiments to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ as a marker for inflorescence meristem fate . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout wild type inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ and is absent from the flanking region that corresponds to the incipient flower and floral organ primordia . we did not detect any major changes in the overall pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inflorescence _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is visible in the central part of the inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ and absent from the peripheral region . however the domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is more extensive in _PROTEIN_ mutant _METHOD_ than in wild type _METHOD_ . this result shows that the supernumerary cells present in _PROTEIN_ mutant _METHOD_ correspond to meristem cells rather than to _PROTEIN_ organ primordia cells . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ meristem enlargement occurs uniformly across the shoot apex or is confined to one area we examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of molecular markers for specific meristematic regions in _PROTEIN_ inflorescences . we have previously reported that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain which corresponds to the most central cells of the sam is significantly broader in _PROTEIN_ inflorescence _METHOD_ than in wild type . this result suggested a function for _PROTEIN_ in restricting cell accumulation in the interior central region of the meristem . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in the and layers of the central zone appeared to be unchanged in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ either because the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain is not affected by the mutation or because its enlargement across such a small group of cells is too slight to be noticed by in situ hybridization . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ in the interior deeper layers of shoot and floral _METHOD_ overlapping the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain . mutations in _PROTEIN_ result in the _PROTEIN_ expansion of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain without altering its layer specificity . counting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells confirmed that the organizing center is significantly larger in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ than in wild type _METHOD_ . in wild type inflorescence _METHOD_ the mean size of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain corresponds to cells in width cells in height and cells in total . in _PROTEIN_ inflorescence central sections the _PROTEIN_ domain expands to cells in width cells in height and cells in total while in _PROTEIN_ inflorescence central sections the _PROTEIN_ domain is cells in width cells in height and cells in total . this result shows that the size of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ organizing center is negatively regulated by _PROTEIN_ activity . as _PROTEIN_ plants have larger inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ than do _PROTEIN_ plants and produce more floral _METHOD_ and floral organs our results suggest that the size of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ organizing center may directly affect these traits . finally we used a pstm uida reporter line as a marker to examine the size of the peripheral zone of the meristem in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . this reporter construct does not recapitulate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in the meristem instead it is _PROTEIN_ at the boundary between the proper inflorescence meristem and the incipient floral primordia . the pstm uida _PROTEIN_ pattern is unaltered in _PROTEIN_ inflorescences indicating that the peripheral region of the mutant _METHOD_ is not significantly enlarged . altogether our _PROTEIN_ analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ restricts the _PROTEIN_ expansion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells in the interior of inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ . to isolate the _PROTEIN_ gene we used caps based mapping of recombination breakpoints in meiotic events among the progeny of _PROTEIN_ wild type . we had previously shown that the _PROTEIN_ mutations mapped between the visible markers ag and on chromosome . using the caps markers throughout this interval we established that _PROTEIN_ was flanked by markers _PROTEIN_ and . thirty one plants with recombination events between _PROTEIN_ and were identified from the mapping population and used to refine the position of the _PROTEIN_ recombination breakpoints to the ends of bac . we sequenced candidate genes annotated on the bac and identified a single gene that was mutated in both _PROTEIN_ alleles . to confirm the identity of _GENE_ as the _PROTEIN_ gene a genomic clone _PROTEIN_ containing the _GENE_ coding region along with kb of upstream and kb of downstream sequence was introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants and this clone partially or fully complemented the mutant phenotypes . and _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ genomic construct produced _METHOD_ and flowers similar to those of wild type plants . in addition _PROTEIN_ plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ transgene flowered at the same time as did wild type plants while untransformed _PROTEIN_ plants flowered week _PROTEIN_ on average . these data confirm that _GENE_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ gene . the complete _PROTEIN_ coding region was determined by est and cdna analysis rt pcr and . this region is bp in length and consists of three exons and two introns encoding a predicted protein of amino acids with a _METHOD_ of kda . genomic sequence analysis indicated the presence of a _PROTEIN_ box a ccaat box and a gc box as well as an in frame stop codon upstream of the transcription start site . ceres cdna and the sequencing of rt pcr products support the annotation of this gene . we have identified a missense mutation in the second exon of this gene in the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ alleles . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is caused by a g to a transition that changes a cysteine residue to a threonine residue at position relative to the translational initiation site . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is due to a c to t transition that replaces a serine residue with a phenylalanine residue at position . database searches revealed the presence of a sequence on arabidopsis chromosome that is highly similar to _PROTEIN_ at the nucleotide level . this paralogous gene _GENE_ consists of two exons and a single intron . because overexpression of this gene can rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype we refer to this locus as _PROTEIN_ . conceptual translation of _PROTEIN_ gives a putative protein of amino acids with identity and similarity to _PROTEIN_ over the full length of the proteins . twenty one of the cysteine residues present in _PROTEIN_ including which is mutated in the _PROTEIN_ allele are conserved in the _PROTEIN_ protein . the serine residue that is mutated in the _PROTEIN_ allele is also conserved in _PROTEIN_ . notably _PROTEIN_ contains five amino acids at the n terminus and six amino acids in the middle of the protein that are not present in the putative _PROTEIN_ protein . we have identified sequences corresponding to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like genes in a number of other plant species including tomato maize cotton rice soybean and wheat . so far only a single _PROTEIN_ like gene has been identified in these species compared with two in arabidopsis . an amino acid alignment of the putative _PROTEIN_ like proteins for which full length or nearly full length genomic and/or est sequences are available is shown in fig . . the overall identity between the proteins ranges from to across the length of the protein . no functions have yet been assigned to any of these _PROTEIN_ like proteins . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations both occur in amino acids that are invariant among all nine of the plant species examined suggesting that these residues are crucial for protein function . two domains can be recognized in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein sequences that have been found in transcription _PROTEIN_ . the prosite program revealed a significant structural homology between the n terminal region of the _PROTEIN_ proteins and a conserved sand domain found in animal proteins . the sand domain is an evolutionarily conserved amino acid dna binding motif that takes its name from the aire and deaf proteins found in humans and drosophila melanogaster . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins as well as the other _PROTEIN_ like plant sequences identity within the sand domain . the three dimensional structures of several sand domains have been determined by nmr and x ray crystallography . the sand domain is a compact strongly twisted fold consisting of five antiparallel sheets alternating with four helices . however the primary sequence of the sand domain is poorly conserved between family members . the highest degree of amino acid conservation is found between two otherwise unrelated proteins from c. elegans and which share identity within the sand domain . most of the animal proteins share less than identity within the sand domain and the pair wise comparison score can be as low as identity as shown for the human aire and _PROTEIN_ proteins . thus the similarity between animal sand domains instead resides at the secondary and consequent _PROTEIN_ structure level . similarly the major conservation of the _PROTEIN_ sand domains is at the level of the secondary structure the psipred program predicts the and strands as well as the and helices in the _PROTEIN_ proteins . the program did not detect the and helices or the sheet probably because of their extremely small size . only two conserved cores are highlighted by multiple alignment of the sand domains the tpxxfe and the kdwk motifs . the tpxxfe motif is perfectly conserved among all the putative _PROTEIN_ like proteins in plants . the kdwk core is not conserved in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nor in the mouse and human aire proteins at the primary sequence level but the secondary structure is conserved . the _PROTEIN_ mutation which causes a null mutant phenotype lies within the helix of the sand domain . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are highly cysteine rich with cysteine residues accounting for of the total amino acid content of each protein . one particular arrangement of cysteine residues near the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins is highly similar to that of a b box motif found in many eukaryotes . in these _METHOD_ the b box domain has been proposed to function in protein protein and in protein rna interactions . b box domains are associated with cysteine rich zinc binding motifs in otherwise unrelated proteins many of them transcription _PROTEIN_ that participate in a wide range of cellular processes . the putative b box region is more highly conserved between _PROTEIN_ and the homologous sequences than the rest of the protein . in animals sand domain containing proteins are found in the _LOCATION_ in the cytoplasm or in both compartments . similarly eukaryotic proteins containing b box domains have been localized to either the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ . the computer _METHOD_ prosite psort signalp and nlsdb each predict the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins to be localized to the _LOCATION_ based on the absence of any sorting or signal peptide . however both _PROTEIN_ proteins are small enough to diffuse passively into the _LOCATION_ through the _LOCATION_ pores . subcellular localization experiments using enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as a marker showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs transiently transformed into onion epidermal cells are localized in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ compartments . to determine the relevance of this localization pattern in vivo we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants stably _PROTEIN_ either the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the promoter . transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein with the _METHOD_ moiety attached to either the n terminus or the c terminus had a wild type appearance indicating that the fusion proteins are functional in either orientation and can rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . visualizing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the roots or _PROTEIN_ of the transgenic plants we observed signal in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . immunoblotting of extracts from the transgenic plant using an anti _METHOD_ antibody showed that the observed localization pattern is not an artifact due to the cleavage of the fusion protein . the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in combination with a _LOCATION_ localization signal or a _LOCATION_ export signal also complement the mutant phenotype when _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ background . however as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are still smaller than the _LOCATION_ pore exclusion size they may enter or exit the _LOCATION_ passively especially when _PROTEIN_ at high levels under the promoter . to prevent passive entry into or exit from the _LOCATION_ we fused each _PROTEIN_ protein to a combined gus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . when bombarded into onion epidermal cells the constructs gave a _METHOD_ and a gus signal primarily in the _LOCATION_ for some cells and equivalently in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ for others . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins have a dual localization in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ and may function in both compartments . we used rt pcr to determine the distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna transcripts in wild type tissues . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be amplified from all tissues tested roots day old seedlings mature leaves _METHOD_ inflorescences pollen and siliques . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was specific to the reproductive developmental stage being detected only in inflorescences pollen and siliques . for both genes the highest level of _PROTEIN_ was observed in inflorescence tissues . we then performed in situ hybridization experiments to localize the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas more precisely in the tissues where they could be detected by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts can be detected throughout the inflorescence meristem and a weak signal can also be detected in the inflorescence vascular tissues . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ transcripts are detectable in stage flower _METHOD_ budding from the flanks of the inflorescence meristem but they reappear much stronger in _PROTEIN_ stage primordia . as soon as the sepal primordia initiate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is excluded from these organ primordia and becomes restricted to the floral meristem . as flower development continues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts become further restricted to stamen and carpel primordia . _PROTEIN_ in carpels was detected only in the adaxial domain corresponding to the region of ovule formation . hybridization to cross sections of mature flowers reveals specific signal throughout the ovules and in the tapetum tissue of the anthers . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns are coincident in inflorescence _METHOD_ floral _METHOD_ and developing flowers . next we determined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of both genes in seedlings and embryos . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the vegetative sam and in young leaf primordia . a stronger _PROTEIN_ signal is detected on the adaxial side of the leaf primordia as observed for the carpel primordia . the antisense _PROTEIN_ mrna probe did not hybridize to seedling tissues confirming that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ during the vegetative stage . in mature embryos both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are detected in the sam and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also observed in the ram . the _PROTEIN_ is detected in very restricted domains corresponding to meristematic cells localized at the apices . interestingly in all earlier analyzed stages from the eight cell stage to the bending cotyledon stage _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are localized throughout the embryo occasionally displaying a stronger signal between the developing cotyledons and in the vasculature . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ becomes tissue restricted only at the time when the embryo enters the maturation phase of development . no signal was detected in the suspensor or in the endosperm at any stage showing that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is embryo specific . because the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ patterns overlap in inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ we asked if _PROTEIN_ could mimic _PROTEIN_ function in these tissues . we transformed a _PROTEIN_ sense construct into _PROTEIN_ plants in order to increase the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in this mutant background . we analyzed the capacity of the _PROTEIN_ transgene to rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes and compared its effects with those of a _PROTEIN_ transgene by scoring floral organ number and flowering time . transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants display a gradient of phenotypes that correlates with the level of _PROTEIN_ gene overexpression . those plants _PROTEIN_ the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ show dramatic vegetative phenotypes as soon as a few days after germination . consequently we performed the complementation analysis on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines that had a wild type appearance at the vegetative stage . as expected rt pcr experiments showed that these lines display a more moderate increase in _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ than the dramatically affected overexpression lines . by analyzing these moderate overexpression lines we found that the _PROTEIN_ transgene complements the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes to the same extent as the _PROTEIN_ transgene . indeed _PROTEIN_ plants containing either of these constructs display floral organ number and bolting time phenotypes close to those of the wild type . thus although the endogenous level of _PROTEIN_ is not sufficient to overcome the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation an increase in the amount of wild type _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ background allows complete rescue of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . these data indicate that when _PROTEIN_ at higher levels wild type _PROTEIN_ protein can functionally compensate for mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . in order to examine the full spectrum of biological functions for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we have obtained an insertion allele of each gene . the _PROTEIN_ allele contains a t dna insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ bp after the start codon . rt pcr experiments show that _PROTEIN_ plants do not accumulate _PROTEIN_ transcripts and place the _PROTEIN_ allele as a null allele . the inflorescence and flower phenotypes of plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation are indistinguishable from those of _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line is a phenotypic null allele probably because of the lack of functional _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ molecular marker analysis _METHOD_ that the _PROTEIN_ allele phenocopies the _PROTEIN_ allele . in _PROTEIN_ inflorescences the mean organizing center size is cells in width cells in height and cells in total . these values are not significantly different from _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutation has a more severe effect on inflorescence meristem size _PROTEIN_ domain expansion and floral organ number than either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ null mutations . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants flower only two days _PROTEIN_ than the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ plants are more dramatically affected flowering up to weeks _PROTEIN_ than wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ allele contains a t dna insertion in the intron of _PROTEIN_ bp after the start codon . because a weak band corresponding to correctly spliced _PROTEIN_ cdna could be amplified from inflorescence tissues from some homozygous mutant individuals after cycles of rt pcr we can not conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants do not display any inflorescence or flower phenotypes and are indistinguishable from wild type plants . determining whether the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein is required for proper reproductive meristem activity will rely on the identification and analysis of a true null allele for the _PROTEIN_ locus . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype is more dramatic than that of the _PROTEIN_ null mutant we analyzed the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the heterozygote state . _PROTEIN_ behaves as a slight semi dominant allele when heterozygous of _PROTEIN_ plants scored five had five sepals and/or _PROTEIN_ in the first one or two flowers and one had six _PROTEIN_ in the first flower . all _PROTEIN_ plants are wild type with respect to stamen and carpel number and floral determinacy indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is recessive with respect to these traits . to test whether the semi dominant effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein is altered in the absence of wild type _PROTEIN_ protein we compared the floral organ number and flowering time phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants with those of _PROTEIN_ plants . we found that _PROTEIN_ plants are more severely affected than either _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants or _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants with respect to sepal/petal number and also flowering time . thus eliminating wild type _PROTEIN_ protein enhances the effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on flowering time and on floral organ number in the outer two whorls . antisense plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ as construct generated in the ler wild type background show a dramatic reduction in the level of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts . some plants from the antisense lines fail to germinate while the rest display a range of shoot and floral meristem defects . the most strongly affected plants have severely disorganized _METHOD_ that resemble those of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants with highly aberrant _PROTEIN_ organ initiation . although ler wild type seedlings develop four true leaves after days of development _PROTEIN_ as seedlings have formed only two cotyledons two barely developed filamentous leaves or two to three stunted leaves after days of development . the wild type sam is a dome shaped structure that produces _PROTEIN_ organs in a regular _PROTEIN_ but no meristematic structure can be detected between the two cotyledons of class _PROTEIN_ as plants . class plants initiate leaf primordia at a greatly reduced rate and their _METHOD_ are very small and flat while class plants produce small leaf primordia around a reduced sam composed of few enlarged cells . comparison of sections through day old ler and day old _PROTEIN_ as seedlings shows that class and class as seedlings lack more than a few meristematic cells . sections through class _PROTEIN_ as shoot apices reveal a small group of enlarged cells that are not organized into layers as in the wild type . after the termination of the primary sam some _PROTEIN_ as plants initiate axillary _METHOD_ which generate one or more inflorescences much _PROTEIN_ than wild type plants . these axillary inflorescence _METHOD_ can also arrest precociously after the production of a couple of flowers . the least severely affected _PROTEIN_ as plants produce flowers that resemble those of _PROTEIN_ mutants . these plants form flowers with supernumerous floral organs when compared with wild type plants . five sepals and five _PROTEIN_ are observed in some flowers and others form up to four carpels . flowers from the _PROTEIN_ as lines also display a partial loss of determinacy in that supernumerous carpels can develop as fifth whorl structures within the fourth whorl gynoecium .
