ethylene is an important plant growth regulator perceived by _LOCATION_ bound ethylene receptors . the _PROTEIN_ ethylene receptor is positively regulated by a predicted _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ based on genetic studies in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ homologs exist in plants animals and protists but the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ is unknown . here we examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subcellular protein localization in order to gain a better understanding of _PROTEIN_ and its function in relation to _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ partly correlates with previously described sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or sites of ethylene response such as the seedling root root hairs and apical hook . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are also enhanced by ethylene treatment and reduced by the inhibition of ethylene signaling . for subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a functional _PROTEIN_ fusion to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . using _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ was observed primarily at the _LOCATION_ apparatus and partially at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in stably transformed arabidopsis protoplasts roots and root hairs . next a functional _PROTEIN_ fusion to a epitope tag was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . immunohistochemistry of root hairs not only showed _PROTEIN_ residing at the _LOCATION_ as previously reported but revealed substantial localization of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . lastly we demonstrated the subcellular co localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these findings support and enhance the genetic model that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in regulating _PROTEIN_ .
gene array data indicate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at detectable levels in most organs and stages and is up regulated by ethylene _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . based on gene arrays _PROTEIN_ is most highly _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds and young siliques with high _PROTEIN_ also seen in seedlings and the shoot apex . using a luciferase reporter citation observed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons leaves the rachis and flowers with lower _PROTEIN_ seen in the seedling root and hypocotyl . to further examine _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ we fused the _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and transformed the resulting construct into wild type arabidopsis plants by agrobacterium infiltration . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was observed by staining for gus activity in the transgenic lines . as shown in figure there is strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in day old seedlings in the apical hook cotyledons root vascular tissue root tip and root hairs with little or no _PROTEIN_ in the hypocotyl . the pattern of _PROTEIN_ was similar in dark and light grown seedlings . in light grown seedlings _PROTEIN_ could also be seen in the apex and young leaves and disappeared from the cotyledons by days . in mature plants _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in floral buds the style of mature flowers _METHOD_ and the rachis . to analyze the effect of ethylene treatment on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we examined the gus staining pattern of etiolated seedlings germinated in the presence of the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid . we also examined the effect of as well as the effect on _PROTEIN_ when the reporter construct was transformed into the ethylene insensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant background . etiolated seedlings responding to ethylene or acc treatment display the triple response phenotype which consists of shortening and radial swelling of the hypocotyl inhibition of root growth proliferation of root hairs and an exaggerated apical hook whereas seedlings treated with or in the _PROTEIN_ background have longer hypocotyls and roots . based on a qualitative assessment of gus staining _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in comparison to untreated seedlings were enhanced by acc and reduced by and _PROTEIN_ although the pattern itself was unaltered by the treatments . these results suggest that there is a negative feedback mechanism in ethylene signaling via regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of ethylene responses . using antiserum raised against an _PROTEIN_ peptide we detected _PROTEIN_ in the microsomal fraction of protein extracts from arabidopsis seedlings confirming the prediction that _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ . it was not feasible however to use this antiserum to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ because western blots showed cross reaction with numerous non specific bands . in order to detect the _PROTEIN_ protein we therefore created a reporter fusion to _PROTEIN_ . to construct the reporter the open reading frame of red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused in frame to the _PROTEIN_ sequence at the n or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . each fusion was placed under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the binary transformation vector pmlbart to create _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . to test the functionality of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in planta the constructs were stably transformed into the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to test for rescue of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . five independent transgenic lines of each construct were examined for the ability to restore ethylene insensitivity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct all five lines exhibited substantial rescue of the _PROTEIN_ mutation based on the seedling triple response indicating that _PROTEIN_ carrying an n terminal _METHOD_ tag retains substantial function . for the other construct none of the five lines rescued _PROTEIN_ to the same extent as the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . therefore all subsequent analyses of the _PROTEIN_ protein were performed using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which _METHOD_ is fused at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protoplasts were prepared from wild type plants that had been stably transformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct and then various _METHOD_ tagged organelle markers were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts to compare their localization patterns with those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the markers were _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ skl _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and cp targeting signal _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . using confocal laser scanning microscopy we examined at least protoplasts _PROTEIN_ each marker . substantial co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ markers was detected in addition to partial co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker . there was potentially some slight co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker . in contrast we did not detect co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ tagged markers for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts localizes primarily to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and partially to the _LOCATION_ . in order to confirm the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization we examined the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in planta . for this we stably transformed _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ into wild type arabidopsis and then crossed the resulting transformants to the above _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformants . the were allowed to self pollinate and several progeny were analyzed for the presence of both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ marker . we examined _METHOD_ in seedling root cells which were easy to access and because gus staining had been pronounced in the seedling root . confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized well with the _LOCATION_ marker in both root cells and root hair cells consistent with the _LOCATION_ apparatus localization in protoplasts . there also appeared to be partial co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker . the rfr _PROTEIN_ signal was more punctate _LOCATION_ than that of the _LOCATION_ marker . to test whether ethylene affects the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we compared the localization pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with that of the _METHOD_ hdel and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers in roots of day old etiolated seedlings germinated in the presence and absence of the ethylene precursor acc . no change was detected in the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulting from acc treatment . next we were interested in investigating whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share similar subcellular localization . to visualize the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we initially prepared protoplasts from the leaves of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and transfected the protoplasts with a construct that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to a c terminal _METHOD_ tag . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion yielded only weak _METHOD_ however . to increase the sensitivity for detection of _PROTEIN_ we switched to a epitope tag fused at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ . we determined that the _PROTEIN_ fusion construct possessed wild type _PROTEIN_ activity by transforming it into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple null mutant which has a constitutive ethylene response phenotype . we examined five independent transgenic lines and found that the triple null phenotype was rescued to the less severe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double null mutant phenotype . in all subsequent analyses with the _PROTEIN_ protein the _PROTEIN_ construct was stably transformed into either the _PROTEIN_ null mutant or wild type plants . to ensure that the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was intact in the transformed lines we isolated protein from the transformed plants and visualized the protein on a western blot using an anti myc antibody . the results consistently showed a single band of the correct monomer size on a western blot of a denaturing _PROTEIN_ gel . there was also a single band of the predicted molecular weight for the dimer under non denaturing conditions . occasionally a single non specific background band of smaller size was detected whether or not the samples carried the _PROTEIN_ protein . given that the anti myc antibody detected an intact fusion protein we proceeded with immunohistochemistry of root hair cells of plants that had been stably transformed with _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ hdel and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker constructs were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ lines to generate separate lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with each marker . notably substantial co localization of _PROTEIN_ was observed with the _LOCATION_ marker and partial co localization was also seen with the _LOCATION_ marker . no signal was observed in root hair cells of untransformed seedlings that were fixed and treated in parallel with the anti myc antibody indicating that the background band seen in the western blot was not detected by this method . finally we examined whether _PROTEIN_ co localizes with the _PROTEIN_ receptor . to obtain arabidopsis plants harboring both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we crossed the individual transformants together and allowed the resulting to self pollinate to produce seeds . whole roots from day old seedlings were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal anti myc antibody . the immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ as well as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was viewed in root hair cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy . as shown in figure co localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed . no antibody signal was detected in root hair cells of approximately one fourth of the segregating indicating the absence of non specific background signal for this method .
