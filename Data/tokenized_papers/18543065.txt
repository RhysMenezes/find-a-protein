rhomboid proteins comprise a class of serine proteases that are conserved in all _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ . they contain six or seven transmembrane helices and control a wide range of cellular functions and developmental processes by intramembrane proteolysis . this paper provides experimental evidence for the existence of rhomboid proteases in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts . among putative rhomboid like proteins in arabidopsis thaliana we selected five predicted as mitochondrially targeted . for these proteins we performed the _METHOD_ transient assay and identified two homologues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to be targeted into _LOCATION_ and mitochondria respectively . phylogenetic analysis reveals that _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ have only one clear orthologue in plant species with completely sequenced genomes . complementation of the yeast lacking a functional copy of mitochondrial rhomboid with _PROTEIN_ indicates that this plant protease in contrast to the human orthologue does not recognize the yeast substrates cytochrome c peroxidase _PROTEIN_ or dynamin like _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with this we did not observe processing of when labeled precursor of this protein was incubated in vitro with arabidopsis mitochondrial extract . our results imply that plant mitochondrial rhomboids function in a specific manner and thus differ from their yeast and mammal counterparts .
the _PROTEIN_ goal of this paper was to identify catalytically active rhomboid like proteases in plant mitochondria . our strategy described in materials and methods was based on two criteria . first we searched for physcomitrella patens oryza sativa arabidopsis thaliana and populus trichocarpa rhomboid like proteins containing at least six tmds as well as residues believed to be essential for catalysis . using this criterion we identified rhomboid like proteins in each plant species . second subcellular localization of the selected plant _PROTEIN_ was predicted using three organelle targeting _METHOD_ . we considered _PROTEIN_ as potentially mitochondrial when it was predicted by at least one algorithm . we found that eight of moss three of rice five of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and four of poplar putative catalytically active rhomboid like proteins may reside in mitochondria . to avoid any ambiguity in nomenclature we have termed rhomboid like genes from arabidopsis thaliana and populus trichocarpa according to proposed names in literature . in the case of physcomitrella patens and oryza sativa we proposed a nomenclature based on their closest homologues in arabidopsis . we have not named the rice and moss _PROTEIN_ which do not exhibit a clear orthological relationship with the arabidopsis rhomboids . searching for rice _PROTEIN_ we found that the gene at the locus encodes three proteins differing in n termini and all of them are most homologous to _PROTEIN_ . therefore we named them . the topology of the phylogenetic tree shown in fig . clearly indicates that the plant catalytically active rhomboid like proteins segregate into two groups . one of them contains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rhomboids experimentally localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis cell and have been designated as members of the rho subfamily . the second group includes plant rhomboid like proteins along with all known mitochondrial members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ rhomboid and which was characterized as the closest toxoplasma ghondii orthologue of the mitochondrial rhomboids . to verify the subcellular localization of the arabidopsis rhomboid like proteases predicted as mitochondrially targeted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we conducted the _METHOD_ transient _PROTEIN_ assay . in this analysis we also included _PROTEIN_ because based on the phylogenetic analysis this protease is closely related to other plant _PROTEIN_ predicted as mitochondrial . two types of constructs were used in our experiments . in the first set of constructs the _METHOD_ reporter was fused in frame to the c terminus of the full length coding sequences while the second set of constructs contained _METHOD_ attached to sequences coding for n terminal regions of proteins . these constructs were used for transfection of protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis mesophyll cells . based on the clustering of the phylogenetic analysis it became evident that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are most closely related to the non plant mitochondrial rhomboids . therefore we started our experiments by looking for sub cellular localization of these two enzymes . first we found that fl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in chloroplasts as the green _METHOD_ co localized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . sometimes dotted signals were seen as located on chloroplast envelope but they were never found in the _LOCATION_ . the chloroplast targeting was consistent when n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast protein . next localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined . in our assay however we were unable to obtain transformants _PROTEIN_ fl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . two possible reasons could be considered one inefficient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fused to fl _PROTEIN_ or alternatively that overexpression of the fusion protein was toxic so that very little or no transformants were visible . in contrast we obtained transformants using n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these transformants contained _METHOD_ signals that were globular or rod shaped similar to those obtained by the control _METHOD_ fused to a presequence from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a high magnification image of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ n _PROTEIN_ shows indeed the co localization of the _METHOD_ with mitotracker signals . however we could not completely rule out possibility that _PROTEIN_ might be also targeted into other cellular compartments since we only used its n terminal region . we also detected _METHOD_ signals when _METHOD_ fused to fl _PROTEIN_ and fl _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts . however the detected signals appear to correspond neither to chloroplast nor to mitochondria and were not co localized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ or mitotracker orange signals . although they co localized with some _LOCATION_ structures such as the _LOCATION_ apparatus the actual location of these _METHOD_ fusion proteins were undetermined in this study . therefore we considered that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were neither chloroplastic nor mitochondrial proteins . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we were unable to obtain transformants _PROTEIN_ of using fl or n _METHOD_ fusions . in summary our transient assay allowed us to identify two arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to be localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria respectively . given that _PROTEIN_ is the closest arabidopsis homologue of and is localized in mitochondria we wondered whether _PROTEIN_ might also share substrate specificity with the yeast mitochondrial rhomboid . to address this issue we tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ to cleave the substrates and _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells lacking a functional copy of the yeast mitochondrial rhomboid . in the first approach cells were transformed with plasmids containing the full open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ or sequence as a positive control . then mitochondrial fractions were isolated and subjected to western blot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ serum . as shown in fig . the band corresponding to the mature cytochrome c peroxidase is visible in mitochondrial fractions isolated from the wild type and cells transformed with the coding construct but not from the cells transformed with the construct containing the full open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ . at that time we assumed that lack of _PROTEIN_ processing by _PROTEIN_ might be because of an inefficient transport of plant protease into yeast mitochondria or an improper sub mitochondrial targeting . therefore we decided to replace the native signal peptide of _PROTEIN_ with putative mitochondrial targeting sequence of . due to the lack of an antibody directed against the plant rhomboid we tested mitochondrial targeting of a hybrid protein encoded by the construct b using two methods . firstly we performed an import into isolated yeast mitochondria of a radioactive labeled hybrid protein b . a protein band smaller than the precursor and resistant to proteinase k digestion was detected after the import suggesting that the hybrid protein b was targeted into mitochondria and that the import was accompanied by processing . no import was observed in the presence of valinomycin supporting an expectation that the import of _PROTEIN_ involves the protein translocation system of the inner _LOCATION_ . to further verify this finding yeast mitochondria were isolated and separated into the soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions using sodium _PROTEIN_ procedure which discriminates between peripheral and integral _LOCATION_ proteins . the purity of both fractions was monitored using antibodies directed against marker proteins . this experiment confirmed that the mature product of the hybrid b processing is an integral _LOCATION_ protein . in the second approach we fused the sequence coding for the hybrid protein b at its end to the _METHOD_ gene and the resulting construct f was used for yeast transformation . the fusion protein of expected size kd was detected exclusively with the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fraction by the anti _METHOD_ antibody . taken together these results demonstrate that the hybrid protein b is efficiently imported into mitochondria and it is totally located in the _LOCATION_ fraction . subsequently cells were transformed with the construct b . total protein extracts from the transformed cells and controls were subjected to western blot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ serum as well as antibodies against . it is known that the protease generates the short isoform of and the mature form of _PROTEIN_ respectively . as expected the large and the short _METHOD_ of and the mature form of _PROTEIN_ were observed in wild type cells and in the cells transformed with the yeast mitochondrial rhomboid . however plasmid borne _PROTEIN_ of the hybrid protein b did not rescue cleavage of either substrate and the observed patterns were the same as those in . both _PROTEIN_ and were processed only to the intermediate _METHOD_ . in the case of both substrates we also observed additional bands which were distinct in size from the _METHOD_ described above . the occurrence of additional bands in the cells as products of nonspecific degradation of or _PROTEIN_ has already been reported . the experiments described above imply that the plant mitochondrial rhomboid is not able to generate the mature form of either of the substrates in yeast cells . to identify regions responsible for apparently divergent functional properties of plant _PROTEIN_ and yeast several hybrids of and _PROTEIN_ were generated and _PROTEIN_ in cells . replacement of three n terminal tmds of or three c terminal tmds of by the corresponding domains of _PROTEIN_ resulted in loss of the processing activity towards its native substrate cytochrome c peroxidase . moreover the gene in which only the fourth tmd containing the catalytic serine was replaced by the respective _PROTEIN_ sequence did not display catalytic activity against _PROTEIN_ . using an anti antibody we confirmed that the hybrid protein e is integrated into the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fraction . this hybrid protein migrates slower than native . we think this may be due to the difference in hydrophobicity between these two proteins caused by the presence of four addition _PROTEIN_ residues in the exchanged fourth domain . below the band corresponding to or the hybrid protein e we detected additional bands which as we assume may result from degradation of these proteins . the above results suggest that the functional differences between _PROTEIN_ and appear to be at least caused by differences in their tm domains . in addition it is possible that other proteins not present in yeast cells are needed for activity of _PROTEIN_ . to _PROTEIN_ this assumption we decided to carry out in vitro processing of radio labeled precursors of and _PROTEIN_ using arabidopsis mitochondrial extract . to prove that the conditions used in the experiment do not prevent efficient and _PROTEIN_ maturation we used yeast mitochondrial extract as a positive control . as a negative control mitochondrial extract generated from the cells was also tested . both and _PROTEIN_ were processed by the yeast mitochondrial extract . in contrast after in vitro processing we did not receive the mature form of using arabidopsis extract . incubation of radio labeled precursor of _PROTEIN_ with plant extract resulted in a protein bands pattern different from the pattern observed with yeast extract but a form in size of the mature _PROTEIN_ was visible . rather different cleavage pattern suggests that the pathway connected with the appearance of a protein of mature _PROTEIN_ size is not the same in plants and yeast . moreover a form similar in size to the mature _PROTEIN_ was also present after processing with mitochondrial extract generated from the cells . this result indicates that in the absence of the rhomboid protease _PROTEIN_ precursor is cleaved by unknown peptidase/s to the form with electrophoretic mobility of the mature _PROTEIN_ . in this context interpretation of the proteolytic pattern obtained with arabidopsis extract is difficult . taken together results obtained in vitro using plant mitochondrial extract suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not recognize at least one yeast rhomboid substrate .
