chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and the biosynthesis of essential metabolites including amino acids fatty acids and secondary metabolites . it is known that many seedling lethal mutants are impaired in chloroplast function or development indicating the development of functional chloroplast is essential for plant growth and development . here we isolated a novel transfer dna insertion mutant dubbed _PROTEIN_ that exhibited a pigment defective and seedling lethal phenotype with a disrupted pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ gene . sequence analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a member of the _PROTEIN_ subgroup which is lacking known e/e or dyw domains at the c terminus in the _PROTEIN_ subfamily of the _PROTEIN_ protein family containing a putative n terminal transit peptide and putative _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like motifs . confocal microscopic analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein is localized in chloroplasts . transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is impaired in the etioplast as well as in chloroplast development . in _PROTEIN_ mutants _LOCATION_ encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis were rarely detected due to the lack of the corresponding transcripts . furthermore transcript profiles of _LOCATION_ genes revealed that in _PROTEIN_ mutants the transcript levels of _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase dependent genes were greatly reduced but those of _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase dependent genes were increased or not changed . additionally the rna editing of two editing sites of the acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ beta subunit gene transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was compromised though it is not directly connected with the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ required for normal chloroplast development .
we generated a collection of t dna insertion mutants in arabidopsis and isolated several seedling lethal mutants with pigment defective phenotypes such as albino pale green and pale yellow . among these mutants we characterized a novel pigment defective and seedling lethal mutant grown under normal growth conditions . this mutant was named _PROTEIN_ for the seedling lethal phenotype . the germinated homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant on normal murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium containing suc developed normally but failed to be pigmented . in the absence of suc the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not pigmented and halted at the cotyledon stage . when grown on soil the _PROTEIN_ mutant stalled beyond the cotyledon stage and subsequently died . pigment accumulations including total chlorophyll and carotenoids were compared between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . the contents of total chlorophylls and carotenoids of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were about and times lower respectively than those of the wild type . genetic analysis indicated that the pigment defective and seedling lethal phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was controlled by a recessive _LOCATION_ gene and cosegregated with the phosphinothricin resistance marker . sequence analysis of the thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr product revealed that the transfer dna was inserted bp downstream from the start codon of the _GENE_ gene . northern blot analysis confirmed that _GENE_ transcript was detected in the wild type but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that disruption of the _GENE_ gene leads to a pigment defective and seedling lethal phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was resulted from the t dna insertion in the _GENE_ gene we obtained two independent t dna insertion lines for the _GENE_ gene from the sail and salk collections . genotype and sequence analyses revealed that the position of the t dna insertion was bp and bp downstream from the start codon of the _GENE_ gene in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was identical to that of _PROTEIN_ . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed no _PROTEIN_ transcripts when using northern blot analysis . furthermore we confirmed that the pigment defective and seedling lethal phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants was associated with the t dna insertion into _GENE_ by molecular complementation . the genomic dna of the _GENE_ gene and its putative promoter region was introduced into a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant . the subsequent genotype phenotype and northern blot analyses confirmed that the introduction of _GENE_ genomic sequence restored the wild type phenotype in the complemented lines . in addition we generated complemented transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ complemented plants also grew normally like wild type plants . thus we used the _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ complemented plants for further studies . taken together these results revealed that the phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants are caused by a loss of function of the _GENE_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene does not have an intron and encodes a putative protein of amino acids with a predicted mr of kd . sequence analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ protein contains _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like motifs but does not contain any other known domains . the _PROTEIN_ protein is a member of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily and belongs to the _PROTEIN_ subgroup that does not have additional c terminal domains . furthermore _PROTEIN_ protein has been classified as _PROTEIN_ a member of the plant combinatorial modular protein subfamily and belongs to the pcmp a subgroup . in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ or pcmp a subgroup contains six members . amino acid sequence analysis shows that _PROTEIN_ protein has significant sequence identity with uncharacterized proteins identified in grape rice maize and moss . many _PROTEIN_ proteins are predicted to be localized in the chloroplasts and mitochondria . the chlorop program predicted that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to the chloroplast and the n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein are a putative transit peptide to the chloroplast . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein we made transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . when protoplasts were isolated and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy we observed the green _METHOD_ derived from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein exclusively in the chloroplasts . this green _METHOD_ was colocalized with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ . thus this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ protein is localized and functions in the chloroplasts . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ protein localization in the chloroplasts we examined the _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in the chloroplast subfractions using western blot analysis . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was detected only in the soluble fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction of the chloroplasts . therefore this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a soluble protein located in the chloroplasts . some _PROTEIN_ proteins are part of a high molecular protein complex that contains rna molecules . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a component of the rna protein complex in vivo we examined the position of _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in soluble fractions using sedimentation through a suc gradient and western blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was broadly distributed in suc gradient fractions and found predominantly in small mr complexes which are smaller than rubisco although small fractions of _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein were found in high mr complexes that are larger than rubisco . ribonuclease a treatment prior to sedimentation leads to a reduced level of _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in all fractions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ might be a part of a protein complex that is associated with rna . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene in planta we made transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the gus protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and examined the gus _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in germinating seeds and seedlings gus staining was observed in cotyledons but not in roots . in adult plants the gus activity was strongly detected in rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . in flowers gus staining was observed exclusively in green tissues such as sepals stamens and carpels but not in _PROTEIN_ . gus staining was also detected in all of the siliques but not in the stigma . interestingly gus staining was also detected in the cotyledons of d old etiolated seedlings that were grown under dark . therefore these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in green aerial tissues and functions under light as well as dark conditions . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant is pigment defective and _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the chloroplasts we examined the chloroplast morphology and ultrastructure in _PROTEIN_ mutant by transmission electron microscopy . under light conditions chloroplasts in the wild type were lens shaped and contained well organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ composed of stromal and granal _LOCATION_ . however the _LOCATION_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutants were small and abnormally shaped including round and amoeboid and did not have _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or any _LOCATION_ structures but contained a large number of small vesicles . in addition densely stained globule aggregates were frequently observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants . because _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledons of etiolated seedlings we also examined the etioplasts ultrastructure . etioplasts are defined by the presence of the paracrystalline prolamellar body . under dark conditions etioplasts in the wild type showed the typical structures i.e . spherical or ellipsoidal shape enclosing plbs and prothylakoid _LOCATION_ . however _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant did not have well developed plbs or prothylakoid _LOCATION_ . some _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a plb like but disorganized structure . taken together these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is impaired in the development of chloroplast as well as etioplasts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions in the early stage of chloroplast development . to compare the accumulation levels of chloroplast proteins of _PROTEIN_ mutant with those of the wild type protein amounts were evaluated comparably using western blot analysis . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not have detectable levels of subunits of photosynthetic protein complexes corresponding to the products of the ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ large subunit _PROTEIN_ psi chlorophyll a apoprotein _PROTEIN_ psii protein _PROTEIN_ and cytochrome f _PROTEIN_ genes . however _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ beta subunit _PROTEIN_ was slightly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant when compared with the wild type . the reduction of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins could be due to the impaired accumulation of _LOCATION_ transcripts . to determine whether reduced protein levels in _PROTEIN_ mutants result from transcriptional defects in the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genes we examined the _PROTEIN_ of corresponding genes encoding subunits of the photosynthetic protein complex in _PROTEIN_ mutants by northern blot analysis . compared with the wild type the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detected in _PROTEIN_ mutants . however transcript pattern of _PROTEIN_ gene in _PROTEIN_ mutant were different from those in the wild type . while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes belong to class i _LOCATION_ genes that are transcribed preferentially by _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene is a class ii _LOCATION_ gene which is transcribed by both nep and _PROTEIN_ . in the wild type there are two major _PROTEIN_ transcripts in which and kb transcripts are transcribed by _PROTEIN_ and nep respectively . however in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the _PROTEIN_ dependent transcript is strongly reduced and the nep dependent transcript is not changed . in addition the two long transcripts which do not exist in the wild type are accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is similar to that observed in _PROTEIN_ defective mutants such as _PROTEIN_ and sigma _PROTEIN_ mutants . this result suggests that the mutation of _PROTEIN_ may affect _PROTEIN_ activity but not nep activity . taken together the deficiencies of the photosynthetic protein complexes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are caused by a defect in the transcription of corresponding _LOCATION_ genes encoding subunits for photosynthetic protein complexes . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation specifically affects transcription by _PROTEIN_ but not nep we examined the transcript abundance of various _LOCATION_ genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant by quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis . as shown in figure there were significant differences in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . compared with the wild type the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genes that are transcribed by _PROTEIN_ including the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were strongly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition _LOCATION_ ribosomal rnas genes which are transcribed by both nep and _PROTEIN_ were also significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutant . however transcript levels of the _LOCATION_ genes including the _PROTEIN_ ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hypothetical chloroplast open reading and rpo genes which are transcribed by nep were increased or unchanged in _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for proper _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ genes . the impairment in rna editing has been reported in some _PROTEIN_ mutants such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and vanilla _PROTEIN_ leading to _PROTEIN_ defective transcription . these mutants showed the similar pigment defective and seedling lethal phenotype to _PROTEIN_ mutants . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ functions in rna editing we tested the rna editing sites of _LOCATION_ transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant using high resolution melting analysis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows altered editing extent at most of rna editing sites compared with the wild type although they were edited correctly as in the wild type . interestingly among rna editing sites known to be edited in the wild type chloroplast the rna editing of _PROTEIN_ was severely impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ as a member of the _PROTEIN_ subgroup might be required for rna editing of _PROTEIN_ site in arabidopsis . to confirm this defect we examined the rna editing of _PROTEIN_ transcript by direct sequencing of reverse transcription product and identified defects of rna editing of _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the rna editing of _PROTEIN_ is significantly reduced and that of _PROTEIN_ is completely abolished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we also evaluated the editing rates of these two editing sites in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . the editing rates of the two sites in the wild type were and respectively whereas they were and respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore in the _PROTEIN_ mutant rna editing of some _LOCATION_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is mildly enhanced relative to the wild type . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ might be required for rna editing of _LOCATION_ transcripts including most notably _PROTEIN_ transcripts . the editing rate was determined by analysis of approximately independent clones from rt pcr products including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . in mutants with defects in the _LOCATION_ ribosome pleiotropic effects in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ have been reported in which they could not translate _LOCATION_ encoded proteins including _PROTEIN_ core subunits . therefore the reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ dependent transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant might be caused by functional defects of the _LOCATION_ ribosome . to ensure the link of the less _PROTEIN_ activity to _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype the transcript levels and patterns of _LOCATION_ rrnas in _PROTEIN_ mutant were investigated using northern blot analysis . compared with the wild type the _PROTEIN_ levels of all _LOCATION_ rrnas were significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however the transcript patterns of _LOCATION_ rrnas in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were similar to those of the wild type . although the accumulation of _LOCATION_ rrnas is strongly reduced the function of the _LOCATION_ ribosome may not be impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to test this possibility we examined _LOCATION_ rrnas associated with the polysome in the _PROTEIN_ mutant by polysomal rna gel blot analysis . as shown in figure there was no difference in the distribution of _LOCATION_ rrnas between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant although the amount of _LOCATION_ rrnas associating with polysomes was reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant contains significantly fewer _LOCATION_ rrnas than the wild type this is likely a consequence of _LOCATION_ rrnas deficiency which could be either due to a lack of functional _PROTEIN_ activity or to an abnormal rrna metabolism . likewise the majority of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were associated with polysomes in the wild type but were not detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that in _PROTEIN_ mutant the functional _LOCATION_ ribosomes exist but the content of functional _LOCATION_ ribosomes is significantly reduced . because the visible and molecular phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant is similar to those of mutants that have a defect in _PROTEIN_ function it is likely that _PROTEIN_ mutant is a _PROTEIN_ defective mutant . _PROTEIN_ is composed of _LOCATION_ encoded core subunits and _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ . the core subunits of the _PROTEIN_ are encoded by the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes which are nep dependent genes . in _PROTEIN_ mutant the transcript levels for rpo genes showed multiple times greater than those of the wild type . to probe any possibility of abnormal rpo transcripts in _PROTEIN_ mutant the amount and pattern of rpo transcripts were compared with those of the wild type using northern blot analysis . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ is cotranscribed with several ribosomal protein genes as part of _PROTEIN_ operon whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are cotranscribed as part of _PROTEIN_ operon . in _PROTEIN_ mutant the transcript accumulation for all rpo genes were significantly increased compared with the wild type but the transcript patterns were similar in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a significant increase in the amount of rpo transcripts with no change of transcript patterns of rpo genes . to investigate whether the increased transcripts led to increase the corresponding proteins comparably _PROTEIN_ protein in _PROTEIN_ mutant was compared with that of the wild type using western blot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed similar level of _PROTEIN_ to the wild type though the _PROTEIN_ transcript level of _PROTEIN_ mutant is much higher than that of the wild type . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ mutant may have comparable _PROTEIN_ level to the wild type but _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ mutant is not parallel to the wild type . taken together these results suggest that the mutation of _PROTEIN_ disturbed the _PROTEIN_ function which _PROTEIN_ the overall level of functional rrnas in _LOCATION_ . eventually the nonoperational transcription and translation in _PROTEIN_ mutant impeded the proper chloroplast biogenesis resulting in seedling lethal phenotype .

grown in soil in a growth room at under continuous light . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated from t dna insertion mutant lines which are generated in ws background with simple t dna vector whereas seeds of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . for the complementation test of the _PROTEIN_ mutant the bp wild type genomic dna fragment of the _GENE_ gene containing bp of a putative promoter sequence and bp of untranslated region was amplified using pfu x polymerase and gene specific primers . after verification by sequencing the amplified
