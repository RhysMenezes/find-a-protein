to better understand the _METHOD_ governing cellular traffic storage of various metabolites and their ultimate degradation arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ proteomes were established . to this aim a procedure was developed to prepare highly purified _LOCATION_ from protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis cell cultures using ficoll density gradients . based on the specific activity of the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase the enrichment _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ was estimated at fold with an average yield of . absence of significant contamination by other cellular compartments was validated by western blot using antibodies raised against specific markers of chloroplasts mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . based on these results _LOCATION_ preparations showed the necessary degree of purity for proteomics study . therefore a proteomics approach was developed to identify the protein components present in both the _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions of the arabidopsis cell _LOCATION_ . this approach includes the following a mild oxidation step leading to the transformation of cysteine residues into cysteic acid and methionine to methionine sulfoxide an in solution proteolytic digestion of very hydrophobic proteins and a prefractionation of proteins by short migration by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this procedure allowed the identification of more than proteins two thirds of which copurify with the _LOCATION_ hydrophobic fraction and one third of which copurifies with the soluble fraction . among the proteins identified from the _LOCATION_ fraction were considered integral _LOCATION_ proteins based on the presence of one or more predicted transmembrane domains and transporters and related proteins were identified _PROTEIN_ . with _PROTEIN_ to function about of the proteins identified were known previously to be associated with _LOCATION_ activities . the proteins identified are involved in ion and metabolite transport stress response signal transduction and metabolism or have been described to be involved in typical _LOCATION_ activities such as protein and sugar hydrolysis . the subcellular localization of several putative _LOCATION_ proteins was confirmed by transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein fusion constructs .
_LOCATION_ from a. thaliana suspension cultures grown in the light were purified after protoplast preparation as described previously with some modifications . an average of of _LOCATION_ proteins could be obtained from g of day old arabidopsis cells . the specific activity of the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase was of proteins in purified _LOCATION_ . this represented an enrichment _PROTEIN_ of fold when compared with the specific activity of the same marker in crude protoplast extract and an average yield of based on this activity . to estimate cross contamination _LOCATION_ preparations were visually checked using _METHOD_ microscopy . in these conditions very few red fluorescing chloroplasts or protoplasts were seen among the blue _LOCATION_ . this low contamination by chloroplasts and protoplasts was confirmed by the absence of detectable chlorophyll when analyzed after acetone extraction . protoplast and _LOCATION_ proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blots were performed to analyze cross contaminations by other subcellular compartments including _LOCATION_ but also mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . western blotting experiments using antibodies raised against the tobacco _PROTEIN_ and the cauliflower _PROTEIN_ were also performed and showed that these _PROTEIN_ proteins were both highly enriched in purified _LOCATION_ compared with the protoplast protein extract in which they were hardly visible under our experimental conditions . in contrast the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ and the mitochondrial protein markers were not detectable in the _LOCATION_ protein extract . in the case of the _LOCATION_ marker a thin band of kda was detectable in the _LOCATION_ fraction reflecting minor _LOCATION_ contaminations . taken together these results showed that our _LOCATION_ preparations were of high quality and that contaminations by other organelle _LOCATION_ were very low allowing further proteomics investigation . we first undertook the identification of the most abundant _LOCATION_ proteins . the most intensely stained bands of the total _LOCATION_ proteins separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ presented in fig . were trypsin digested and peptide mixtures were submitted to nano lc esi _METHOD_ analysis . this proteomics analysis led essentially to the identification of soluble proteins . among them we identified the tripeptidyl peptidase ii the a and b subunits of the _LOCATION_ type h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a protein similar to the bacterial tolb protein a member of the tol system a putative leucine aminopeptidase a putative pectin methylesterase the glycosyl hydrolase family similar to the _PROTEIN_ endo _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ isoform from hevea brasiliensis three band family proteins bearing strong similarities to hypersensitive induced response protein from zea mays a basic endochitinase involved in the ethylene/jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway during systemic acquired resistance a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ induced by dehydration and a soul heme binding family protein . interestingly the latter protein which has never been described in plants is similar to the mammalian and _PROTEIN_ members of the family . a _LOCATION_ protein has been suggested to be involved in heme utilization for hemoprotein synthesis . to identify the major _LOCATION_ proteins present in the tonoplast _LOCATION_ were first frozen hawed as described under experimental procedures. the _LOCATION_ fraction was then separated from the soluble material by ultracentrifugation and salt washed to eliminate _LOCATION_ associated soluble proteins . at this step to prevent the use of detergent to solubilize hydrophobic proteins we used an alternative method that consists of an in solution trypsin digestion in the presence of methanol . _LOCATION_ proteins were first denatured at a high temperature followed by rapid cooling by the addition of cold meoh to final concentration and tryptic digestion was then carried out in this solution . the resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by nano lc esi _METHOD_ and proteins were identified from a very low amount of proteins . peptides identified with a mascot score sufficient for protein identification are listed in supplemental table i . this procedure allowed the identification of the most hydrophobic tonoplast proteins . thirty of the most abundant _LOCATION_ proteins identified in the tonoplast are presented in table i . this indicative classification is based on a simplified exponentially modified protein abundance index proposed by ishihama et al . . relative protein abundance was estimated by normalizing the number of peptides per protein by the theoretical number of peptides per protein . a caveat applies to this estimation as extremely abundant proteins may affect the efficiency of protein identification because of ionization suppression and detector saturation . highly hydrophobic proteins may also be under represented because they generate a limited number of peptides due to their sequence characteristics . despite these limitations approximate comparison of the relative abundance of tonoplastic _LOCATION_ proteins is possible because of the common characteristics they share . it is noteworthy that a total of of the proteins were identified by two peptide hits or more . the majority of the proteins identified are transporters and the most representative proteins as expected are _PROTEIN_ subunits of the _LOCATION_ h pumping _PROTEIN_ and the h pumping pyrophosphatase _PROTEIN_ . among the most abundant proteins there are also three abc transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ five multidrug and toxin extrusion efflux family proteins a sodium/calcium exchanger family protein and a calcium transporting _PROTEIN_ a peptide transporter _PROTEIN_ a copper transporter family protein _PROTEIN_ and a cationic amino acid transporter _PROTEIN_ . this preliminary proteomics work not only confirmed the quality of our _LOCATION_ preparations but also revealed the identification of several proteins that had never been identified before by classical approaches . on the other hand it also showed the lack of proteins such as the thioglucosidases that are known to be the _PROTEIN_ components of other _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . taken together these results indicated the need to extend the knowledge of the _LOCATION_ proteome of cultured arabidopsis cells . to increase the number of proteins identified in the tonoplast prefractionation of the _LOCATION_ and soluble proteins was performed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a short migration was carried out to obtain efficient separation and to avoid a diffusion effect across the gel and keep the total number of gel bands to be analyzed reasonable . the gel was cut into bands . a peroxide treatment was performed and proteins were then in gel digested with trypsin and identified by nano lc esi _METHOD_ analysis . extended coverage of the protein sequences was obtained using both dynamic exclusion during the _METHOD_ process and a second nano lc esi _METHOD_ analysis using an exclusion list to limit refragmentation of peptides fragmented during the first run . the peroxide treatment applied before trypsin digestion is a mild oxidation procedure that _METHOD_ the cysteinyl residues into cysteic acids . the advantage of this method lies not only in the increased peptide coverage but also in the speed of sample preparation compared with classical reduction/alkylation approaches . this treatment also converts all the methionines to the maximal oxidation state providing better quality _METHOD_ spectra and prevents the apparition of the intermediate fragmentation pattern of da that complicates the _METHOD_ attributions obtained with the mascot software . using this procedure proteins were identified from the _LOCATION_ fraction . using both the in gel and in solution digestion procedures a total of non redundant proteins were identified from the tonoplast . among them had been demonstrated previously to be localized to the _LOCATION_ were integral _LOCATION_ proteins based on the presence of one or more predicted transmembrane domains five had transmembrane barrel structures such as porins did not have any transmembrane domain but were known to be part of _LOCATION_ complexes such as h _PROTEIN_ and were predicted or known to have covalent lipid modifications leading to their insertion into the _LOCATION_ and psort ii . among the latter we found several band family proteins a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein a multicopper oxidase and ras related _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . the soluble proteins identified from the _LOCATION_ sap will not be discussed here . the whole proteomics work presented here represents the identification of more than non redundant proteins this is the most complete study done to date . the proteins found both in our study and in previously published studies are listed in tables i and ii and supplemental tables i and ii . the most complete study previously published identified proteins . in general our respective fractions are quite different and the overlap rate of the two studies is around . this weak overlap in _METHOD_ of identification is almost certainly related to differences in starting material . carter et al . used arabidopsis leaves whereas we used arabidopsis suspension cultures . it is noteworthy that in our study around of the proteins were identified by two or more peptide hits . contrary to the analysis of the total _LOCATION_ fraction by carter et al . our identification did not reveal the presence of a kda protein representing the bulk of _LOCATION_ protein content . this difference is probably due to the presence of myrosin cells in the arabidopsis leaves that accumulate the thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ . our _LOCATION_ protein data were much more complete because the transporters identified in the previous study were well overlapped and our analysis identified a larger number of transporters with better coverage rates . to be complete our _LOCATION_ protein tonoplastic set must be compared with the results of shimaoka et al . where proteins including well characterized tonoplast proteins such as v type h _PROTEIN_ and v type h _PROTEIN_ were identified . both identifications were obtained from suspension cultured arabidopsis cells . however the data of shimaoka et al . led to the identification of proteins of which were _LOCATION_ proteins . of these were predicted to have more than two transmembrane domains and are possible transporters . shimaoka et al . and szponarski et al . identified a large number of mostly soluble proteins within their _LOCATION_ fractions . this may be because of a lack of thorough washing of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or due to different lc or _METHOD_ analysis protocols . fig . shows the cross correlation of the different proteome analyses of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system . proteins were categorized into major groups transporters stress response signal transduction metabolism cellular transport protein synthesis and degradation _LOCATION_ glycosyl hydrolase rna degradation unclassified and contaminants . it is of note that the _PROTEIN_ contamination of our preparations _METHOD_ to be _LOCATION_ proteins in particular with ribosomal proteins . few possible contaminating mitochondrial or chloroplast proteins were detected . among the classes of proteins identified transporters are of particular interest because few _LOCATION_ transporters have been identified and fully characterized so far . import and export of metabolites and ions require their corresponding transport _METHOD_ across the tonoplast and many transporters and channels in this _LOCATION_ remain to be identified . in the present work we identified proteins with demonstrated or predicted transporter activities . in addition the two major components of the tonoplast the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ and the h _PROTEIN_ were identified . the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ is a large oligomeric protein complex composed of subunits that form a hydrophilic subdomain localized in the cytoplasm and an integral _LOCATION_ subdomain . in arabidopsis five subunits are encoded by alternative splicing of a single gene the others are encoded by multiple genes . among the possible subunits proteins were clearly identified . table ii summarizes the h _PROTEIN_ subunits identified in the present work alongside those identified in other published works . the high quality of the _LOCATION_ preparation and the analytical methods we used have allowed coverage of a high percentage of the protein sequences . corroborating this very high mascot score values reaching for example in the case of the vha a subunit identification were obtained . the identification of the other _LOCATION_ pump the h _PROTEIN_ was also achieved with a high mascot score value . the _PROTEIN_ representative superfamily of transporters that we identified was the abc transporter family . substrates assigned to members of this large family of transporters include compounds as diverse as peptides sugars lipids heavy metal chelates polysaccharides alkaloids steroids inorganic acids and glutathione conjugated compounds . the abc proteins encoded by the arabidopsis genome are classified into subfamilies based on their size orientation domain organization and resemblance to abc proteins from other _METHOD_ . in the present proteomics work different members belonging to five different subfamilies multidrug resistance protein multidrug resistance associated proteins pleiotropic drug resistance non intrinsic abc protein _PROTEIN_ and transporter associated with antigen processing were identified . ten were clearly identified as mrp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the degree of identities shared between these mrp subfamily members ranges from to making their unambiguous identification difficult unless a high protein coverage is obtained . only three of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been identified and localized to the tonoplast so far by classical methods . our data confirmed their presence in the tonoplast _LOCATION_ and six others were identified . table iii shows once again the high mascot score and coverage values obtained in our analyses even for these difficult to identify proteins . as an example _PROTEIN_ was identified with a mascot score of and sequence coverage . based on the protein coverage found in the in solution digestion protocol _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be the most abundant abc subclass transporter in cultured arabidopsis cells . analysis of _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ database predicts the presence of a strong chloroplast targeting signal and a weaker _LOCATION_ signal peptide . these predictions show that the in silico subcellular localization prediction _METHOD_ are probably not robust enough . surprisingly we also found _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast whereas klein et al . using confocal microscopy analysis of onion epidermal cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed _METHOD_ at the periphery of cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ protein was located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in support of our data previous proteomics studies confirm the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the purified _LOCATION_ fractions but both localizations could be possible . moreover in a recent study dunkley et al . have unambiguously assigned transporters to specific organelles by lopit technology . the authors have shown that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ class is dominated by proteins involved in _LOCATION_ transport including eight abc transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . four different tonoplast intrinsic proteins also known as aquaporins were identified on the tonoplast _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we thus demonstrated that aquaporins are well _PROTEIN_ on arabidopsis cultured cells and showed that one of the most abundant proteins present on the tonoplast is the . previous studies argued that plant cells have the ability to generate and _PROTEIN_ separate _LOCATION_ organelles with each being marked by a different _PROTEIN_ subtype . for example the fully differentiated cell types psvs are marked by _PROTEIN_ plus _PROTEIN_ and lytic _LOCATION_ are marked by _PROTEIN_ . the presence of both markers in our proteomics work could be explained by the presence of different kinds of _LOCATION_ in our samples or the presence of _LOCATION_ that come from fusion of storage and lytic _LOCATION_ combining properties of both _LOCATION_ as mentioned previously . other transporters identified in the tonoplast proteome are listed in table iv . among them transporters that mediate the efflux of a broad range of compounds have been identified for example members of detoxifying efflux transporters which include eight major facilitator superfamily members six mate family members three examples of drug/metabolite transporter superfamily proteins and one member of the resistance/nodulation/division superfamily . members of the mfs family are secondary transporters that represent the largest group of ion coupled transporters involved in the symport antiport or uniport of various substrates such as sugars krebs cycle intermediates phosphate esters oligosaccharides and antibiotics . members of the multidrug/oligosaccharidyl lipid/polysaccharide family were also identified here . these are interesting because arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ many members of this family not found in the animal kingdom . the mate family which is a mop subtype shows homologies with bacterial efflux transporters . the arabidopsis genome codes for at least members of this family and only a few members of the mate family are characterized functionally . their contribution to drug resistance has been shown only for a few isolated cases . hydropathy analysis suggests that proteins of the mate family have a common topology consisting of transmembrane domains . six different mate efflux transporters were characterized in the tonoplast fraction suggesting the potential contribution of the _LOCATION_ system to drug resistance . five peptide transporters were identified three members of the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter family and two oligopeptide transporters . interestingly one of the best characterized plant opt members is the maize yellow stripe transporter a phytosiderophore h symporter involved in uptake but also in the uptake of various other metal cations complexed with either phytosiderophores or nicotianamine . the two opt family members that we have identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast are classed as yellow stripe like transporters and present and similarity with . we also confirmed the presence of other metal transporters such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we did not identify the na /h antiporter _PROTEIN_ but found an isoform _PROTEIN_ which is also a member of the monovalent cation proton antiporter _PROTEIN_ family . a putative iron transporter _PROTEIN_ a member of the zinc iron permease family was also identified . the _LOCATION_ calmodulin regulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also found in the tonoplast . three k uptake permeases members of one of the five potassium transporter families were identified in the present work . the latter has recently been shown to be required for auxin transport in arabidopsis roots . the tonoplast contains at least seven amino acid transporters from the distinct amino acid transporter genes encoded by the arabidopsis genome . we identified four of the nine cationic amino acid transporters present in arabidopsis . interestingly a recent molecular and functional characterization of this family shows that is localized to the tonoplast whereas is present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . and were identified in the tonoplast in the study by carter et al . . we also found five amino acid/auxin permease family members in the tonoplast . moreover a few other unexpected proteins such as _PROTEIN_ protein similar to tolb protein precursor or niemann pick similar protein were found in the tonoplast _LOCATION_ . tolb a periplasmic protein found in most gram negative proteomes is one of the tol proteins of escherichia coli and is involved in the translocation of group a colicins . tolb also _METHOD_ a complex with pal an outer _LOCATION_ peptidoglycan associated lipoprotein anchored to the outer _LOCATION_ by its n terminal lipid moiety . the exact role of the tol system remains to be determined . its presence in the tonoplast is probably linked to _LOCATION_ biogenesis as supposed for the gram negative _METHOD_ . niemann pick protein is a large multitransmembrane glycoprotein that was shown to reside primarily in mammalian _PROTEIN_ endosomes . its cytoplasmic tail contains a dileucine endosome targeting motif and it transiently associates with lysosomes and the trans _LOCATION_ network . the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein is unclear . however a number of observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be related to a family of prokaryotic efflux pumps and thus it may also act as a molecular pump or cholesterol transporter or play a role in docking/fusion events . from our data we can pinpoint another important uncharacterized class of proteins the band protein family . twenty members of this family domain proteins are predicted from the arabidopsis genome of them were identified in the _LOCATION_ fraction . co fractionation with the tonoplastic _LOCATION_ in the presence of sodium _PROTEIN_ at ph followed by salt wash strongly suggests that the band proteins are true integral _LOCATION_ proteins . interestingly this observation is in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ that the band proteins are putatively myristoylated or have one tmd . in most cases this modification is essential for protein function to mediate _LOCATION_ association or protein protein interaction . the spfh protein domain is characteristic of the prohibitins and the stomatins which are putatively involved in cell cycle and ion channel control . multiple stomatin orthologues from bacteria plants and animals have been identified . in caenorhabditis elegans multifunctional _LOCATION_ protein a stomatin like protein is involved in mechanosensation . another example is the protein unc a close c. elegans homologue of the mammalian protein stomatin which may be involved in anesthetic sensitivity and could represent a molecular target for volatile anesthetics . cumulative evidence suggests that band stomatins may modulate _LOCATION_ functions especially those of detergent resistant microdomains or lipid rafts . the presence of this family in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ may play a crucial role in the regulation of either the biogenesis of the tonoplast _LOCATION_ or the regulation of transporters and metabolite flux across the tonoplast . consequently we confirmed the subcellular localization of one member of this family using a _METHOD_ fusion protein approach . in eukaryotes peptides derived from proteasomal degradation of intracellular proteins have been shown to translocate from the _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ via tap . tap is a macromolecular peptide loading machinery composed of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tapasin and several auxiliary _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . according to the proteins characterized in our tonoplastic fraction similar machinery for protein degradation and peptide import into the _LOCATION_ may be present in arabidopsis . indeed we have identified a _PROTEIN_ homologue a calreticulin _LOCATION_ and other members of the tap machinery and this could explain the number of proteasome subunits observed in our sample . the quality of the purified _LOCATION_ fraction as assessed by enzymatic and immunological assays was the first criterion for establishing the likelihood of _LOCATION_ localization of the proteins identified in this study . indeed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses did not reveal the presence of major proteins from other organelles . moreover several proteins identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were already known as _LOCATION_ proteins . to further characterize the _LOCATION_ system studied here the subcellular localization of several proteins was investigated by transient _PROTEIN_ in transfected tobacco plants and in arabidopsis protoplasts of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . we chose the following proteins from tables i and v and supplemental table ii the cell elongation protein a band family protein an integral _LOCATION_ protein a putative lipocalin and the cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscopy imaging was carried out on transfected tobacco plants or on protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis cell suspensions . as a positive control in accordance with previously published data we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and confirmed its _LOCATION_ cellular location in tobacco cell leaves . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was also used as _LOCATION_ protein control and is presented in fig . . inspection of the _METHOD_ transformed plant using _METHOD_ microscopy _METHOD_ its presence in the tonoplast compartment . analysis of the _GENE_ amino acid sequence predicts a transmembrane domain at the n terminus of the protein . it has been proposed that is a peripheral or an integral _LOCATION_ protein . the arabidopsis gene encodes a protein involved in steroid synthesis and a _LOCATION_ subcellular localization is in good agreement with the proposed role for the protein as a biosynthetic enzyme because sterols as well as steroid hormones are relatively hydrophobic moieties one would expect that synthesis may occur in a _LOCATION_ environment . the _GENE_ gene product is a band family protein presenting similarity to hypersensitive induced response protein with relatively high homology to regions of stomatin and prohibitin . its presence in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was also confirmed . according to _PROTEIN_ database prediction the _GENE_ gene product is an integral _LOCATION_ protein with transmembrane domains . among the biological processes to which this protein may contribute are phosphate transport oligopeptide transport cell adhesion _PROTEIN_ transport phospholipid biosynthesis and tissue regeneration . the _GENE_ gene product shows similarity to a putative sugar transporter from sugar beet that was cloned and localized to the _LOCATION_ in transgenic yeast and tobacco . this putative transporter is a member of a subgroup of a large gene family currently termed the mfs . fig . _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ localization of this transporter in tobacco cells . the _GENE_ gene product is a putative lipocalin family member or outer _LOCATION_ lipoprotein like . lipocalins are widely distributed among vertebrates and a few have been isolated from invertebrates and plants . predominantly lipocalins are small secreted proteins . some members of the family exhibit high affinity and selectivity for hydrophobic molecules such as cholesterol pheromones or fatty acids . others have been shown to bind to specific cell surface receptors and to form macromolecular complexes . the lipocalins have been classified as transport proteins . the non solubilization of the protein during our _LOCATION_ washing procedure indicated that this protein could be an anchor linked protein and the _METHOD_ microscopic analysis presented in fig . demonstrated the presence of lipocalin protein on the tonoplast _LOCATION_ . as the localization of these latter two proteins presented some heterogeneity in the leaf model we performed a transient _PROTEIN_ analysis in arabidopsis protoplasts . it is interesting to note that lipocalin _METHOD_ not to be exclusively localized on the tonoplast whereas its presence on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is confirmed by observing a _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ being released from a cell . inversely the putative sugar transporter is clearly exclusively targeted to the tonoplast . the last protein that we chose to study as a _METHOD_ fusion construct was the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ . apocarotenoids derived from the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids are involved in important metabolic and hormonal functions in diverse _METHOD_ . since the discovery of in maize the prototypic cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase several carotenoid cleavage enzymes have been characterized and grouped in different classes according to substrate specificities . class is represented by the nceds that are involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the class family catalyzing a dioxygenase reaction leading to the synthesis of ionone and dialdehyde . so far nine carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase genes have been identified in the complete arabidopsis genome and among them only five nceds have been shown to be targeted to _LOCATION_ . however no information was available concerning the localization of _PROTEIN_ as shown in fig . our analyses clearly identified _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as expected and taking into account the overall results presented previously the _LOCATION_ localization of all the _METHOD_ tagged proteins was confirmed . the analysis of a proteome at the level of subcellular structures represents an analytical strategy that combines traditional biochemical methods of fractionation and tools for protein identification . we have shown the strategy developed in this work to be very efficient to get a broader view of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome . we identified several new _LOCATION_ proteins such as channels and transporters that mediate the translocation of molecules and ions across tonoplast _LOCATION_ . we consider that most of the proteins identified in this study are genuine constituents of the tonoplast . this is based on the identification of key tonoplastic components the verification of _LOCATION_ localization for selected proteins using _METHOD_ fusion proteins and the low contamination of our preparations by other organelles . through our _LOCATION_ proteomics strategy it _METHOD_ clear that the tonoplast _LOCATION_ is a complex structure that receives _LOCATION_ and protein contributions from a variety of subcellular sources and pathways . the high degree of protein diversity of the tonoplast _LOCATION_ is indicative of a highly complex organelle . further validation of the results presented here by relevant functional studies should provide a better explanation for the biogenesis and _PROTEIN_ of these unique organelles .
a. thaliana cells were cultivated at under constant light and shaking in a murashige and skoog medium _METHOD_ containing mm sucrose and dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . every days ml of fresh medium were inoculated with an aliquot of the culture of day old cells . protoplasts were obtained after digestion of day old cells in m mannitol cellulase pectolyase mm mes ph . after h protoplasts were filtered through a nylon net and the suspension was centrifuged for min at g. the protoplast pellet was washed with a rinsing medium and adjusted to a final concentration of . _LOCATION_ were then purified

isolated using a three step gradient . the suspension of protoplasts was loaded at the bottom of a centrifuge tube and covered with volumes of a mixture and volume of medium b . the gradient was then centrifuged at g for min and _LOCATION_ were collected at the interface of the first and second layers corresponding to and ficoll . the _LOCATION_ were then concentrated by centrifugation . purification yield of _LOCATION_ preparations was followed by enzymatic assay of the _LOCATION_ specific marker mannosidase according to boller and kende . protein was added to a medium containing mm citric acid naoh and mm p nitrophenyl d mannopyranoside . after and min of incubation at the reaction was stopped by adding ml of m ml of assay medium . after centrifugation enzyme activity was evaluated by detecting the product p nitrophenol at nm . purity of the _LOCATION_ was controlled by western blot analyses . fifteen _METHOD_ of proteins from protoplast or _LOCATION_ extracts were loaded on a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel and after migration at v transferred to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the presence of different characteristic proteins was assessed using western blot analyses and primary polyclonal antibodies raised against the outer envelop protein and the light harvesting complex b _LOCATION_ the preprotein translocase of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ p type h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the hdel domain of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . antibodies raised against tonoplastic markers such as the tobacco _PROTEIN_ and the cauliflower _PROTEIN_ were used to control for _LOCATION_ enrichment . _LOCATION_ were disrupted by a freeze haw cycle in nitrogen . the suspension was then centrifuged for min at g. the pellet containing the _LOCATION_ was resuspended in of mm ammonium bicarbonate . the mixture was then adjusted to with m nacl and incubated at for min with constant shaking . for in gel digestion of proteins from either the soluble or the _LOCATION_ fractions were separated by a short electrophoresis by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after coloration with _METHOD_ blue the gel was cut into mm slices . each band was further cut and washed twice in of destaining solution at room temperature for min before dehydration with of pure acn . the solution was then removed and the gel pieces were dried in a speed vacuum and rehydrated in of at room temperature for min in the dark . the oxidizing solution was removed and the gel slices were rinsed in water as previously described above . after complete drying the bands were rehydrated in of digestion buffer containing ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin . after min of incubation at of digestion buffer were added and the digestion reaction was carried out at for h with constant shaking . the digestion solution was then collected and peptides were extracted from the gel by diffusion in of m urea for min with sonication . digestion and extraction solutions were pooled and dried in a speed vacuum . peptide mixtures were redissolved in of containing formic acid prior to lc _METHOD_ analysis . for in solution digestion the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was resuspended in of mm ph and heated at for min . denaturation was stopped by adding of cold methanol thus avoiding protein refolding which can occur during slow cooling . digestion was carried out overnight at with an enzyme/substrate ratio of . finally tris _PROTEIN_ phosphine hydrochloride was added to a final concentration of mm and reduction was carried out at for min . the digestion solution was then dried in a speed vacuum and peptide mixtures were redissolved in of containing fa prior to lc _METHOD_ analysis . injected samples from in gel digestion were first trapped and desalted isocratically on a pepmap mm precolumn cartridge . chromatographic separation was accomplished by loading peptide samples onto a cm fused silica column using an autosampler . sequential peptide elution was achieved using the following linear gradient from to solvent b containing fa for min and from to solvent b for min . the remaining percentage of the elution solvent was made of solvent a containing fa . flow rate through the nano lc column was set to nl/min . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was calibrated using the product ions generated from fragmentation of the doubly charged molecular ion of glu fibrinopeptide b . raw data were processed using peptideauto _METHOD_ using smooth savitzky golay . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was operated in the positive ion electrospray ionization mode with a resolution of full width half maximum . for automatic lc _METHOD_ analysis the q tof ultima instrument was run in data dependent mode with the following parameters s scan time and s interscan delay for _METHOD_ survey scans and m/z _METHOD_ ranges for the survey and the _METHOD_ scans respectively five components _METHOD_ to _METHOD_ switch after s switchback threshold counts/s include charge states and with the corresponding optimized collision energy profiles . a list of the m/z corresponding to the most intense peptides of trypsin was set as an exclude list . peptide identification from the resulting _METHOD_ dataset was achieved using an in house mascot server _PROTEIN_ . chromatographic separation of in solution digested proteins was accomplished by loading of peptide mixture on the column . sequential elution of peptides was performed using the following linear gradient from to solvent b for min and from to solvent b for min . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was set as described above . the acquired data were postprocessed to generate peak lists using peptideauto which is a part of proteinlynx from _METHOD_ . the following parameters were used quality assurance threshold smooth window centroid at minimum peak width at half height centroid top . the peak lists are appended as a single file . each sample was submitted to consecutive searches against the swiss prot trembl database and the specific a. thaliana database using mascot . mascot search parameters used with _METHOD_ data were database a. thaliana _LOCATION_ enzyme trypsin/proline one missed cleavage allowed peptide tolerance da _METHOD_ tolerance da peptide charge and variable modifications . for the in gel digestion procedure variable modifications were n terminal acetylation/oxidized methionine under sulfone and sulfoxide form/fma acid . for the in solution digestion procedure variable modifications were acetyl nter/oxidized methionine under sulfone form/fma . proteins identified by at least two peptides with a mascot mowse score higher than were automatically validated . when this criterion was not met the fragmentation spectrum from each peptide was manually interpreted using the conventional fragmentation rules . in particular we looked for a succession of at least five y and/or b ions specific immonium ions specific fragment ions and signatures of any modifications carried by the peptides . in cases where the protein was _PROTEIN_ identified by a single peptide match the _METHOD_ ions were manually examined for notable sequence tag and independently verified using the peaks studio program . the algorithm can efficiently choose the best amino acid sequence from all possible amino acid combinations to interpret the _METHOD_ spectrum according to the same chemical modifications defined in mascot . an additional search was carried out for the identification of the possible n terminal peptide of proteins using semitrypsin and n terminal acetylation as mascot parameters . specialized databases for arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis information resource database and transportdb were used to facilitate interpretation of protein sequence identified by the proteomics approach . complementary information was obtained using the psort ii prediction program . _METHOD_ protein fusions were generated using gateway technology . cdna encoding the protein to be tested for subcellular localization were provided in entry clones _PROTEIN_ by the arabidopsis biological resource center stock center . cloning reactions were performed following the manufacturer 's instructions using the destination vector which was kindly provided by the flanders interuniversity institute for biotechnology . the resulting _PROTEIN_ vectors were introduced in agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . for transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves a h old culture of a. tumefaciens was diluted five times in an induction medium as described previously . after h the bacterial suspension was adjusted to an of and leached into leaves of week old tobacco . in parallel and as a positive control for tonoplastic localization tobacco plants were also transformed with the vector containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construction . for transient protoplast transformation the smai drai cassettes from _PROTEIN_ vectors containing the cauliflower mosaic virus the _METHOD_ protein fusion and the nopaline synthase terminator were subcloned into pcr blunt ii topo for more efficient transformation . protoplasts were prepared as described for _LOCATION_ isolation except that the rinsing medium was replaced by medium _PROTEIN_ . in a microcentrifuge tube of protoplasts were added to of plasmid dna in of water . peg solution polyethylene glycol was added to the mixture . after min of incubation at room temperature protoplasts were diluted in of medium centrifuged for min at g resuspended in ml of buffer and incubated at for days before observation . subcellular localization was assessed by scanning confocal microscopy _METHOD_ was excited at a wavelength of nm and _METHOD_ measurements were collected between and nm .
