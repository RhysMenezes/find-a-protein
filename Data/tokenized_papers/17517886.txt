the functional capabilities of one of the smallest subfamilies of _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporters from arabidopsis thaliana the _METHOD_ are described . designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ these half molecule abc proteins are homologous to the yeast mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ which is clearly implicated in the export of mitochondrially synthesized iron/sulfur clusters . yeast _PROTEIN_ deficient _PROTEIN_ mutants grow very slowly are respiration deficient accumulate toxic levels of iron in their mitochondria and show enhanced compensatory high affinity iron uptake . of the three arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bears the closest functional resemblance to . heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not only able to complement the yeast _PROTEIN_ petite phenotype but is also able to suppress the constitutively high capacity for high affinity iron uptake associated with loss of the chromosomal copy of abrogate intra mitochondrial iron hyperaccumulation and restore mitochondrial respiratory function and cytochrome c levels . by comparison _PROTEIN_ only weakly suppresses the _PROTEIN_ phenotype and _PROTEIN_ exerts little or no suppressive action but instead is toxic when _PROTEIN_ in this system . the differences between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ after exchanging their target peptides and these proteins as well as _PROTEIN_ colocalize with the mitochondrial fluor mitotracker red when _PROTEIN_ in yeast as _METHOD_ fusions . although its toxicity when heterologously _PROTEIN_ in yeast except when fused with _METHOD_ precludes the functional analysis of native _PROTEIN_ a common function mitochondrial export of fe/s clusters or their precursors for the assembly of _LOCATION_ fe/s proteins is inferred for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
cloning and sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are three orfs designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the genome of arabidopsis capable of encoding proteins bearing a close similarity to s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ . two of these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ map to within bp of each other on chromosome iv . the other _PROTEIN_ maps to a portion of chromosome v that is otherwise devoid of abc protein orfs . for the investigations described here the coding sequences for all three of these genes were cloned by rt pcr of total rna isolated from day old arabidopsis seedlings grown in standard liquid _METHOD_ medium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ medium containing _PROTEIN_ . in the first instance all three pcr clones were subcloned into vector under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter for constitutive heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast . subsequently however because constitutively _PROTEIN_ borne _PROTEIN_ was found to be toxic in e. coli and yeast this pcr clone was subcloned into pbluescript for secondary cloning into vector for _PROTEIN_ from the galactose inducible yeast _PROTEIN_ promoter instead of the constitutive _PROTEIN_ promoter . phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the _METHOD_ against those of representative _PROTEIN_ subfamily members from yeast and mammals firmly establish their membership of a common subfamily but one in which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ group as a subcluster distinct from _PROTEIN_ and their homologs in yeast and mammals . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are sequence identical and sequence similar to each other but no more than sequence identical and sequence similar to their nearest equivalent _PROTEIN_ which in turn is no more than identical and sequence similar to the nearest equivalent of the _METHOD_ from a source other than arabidopsis . as detailed under discussion it is therefore conceivable in the light of the immediate proximity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to each other on chromosome iv that they arose through the direct tandem duplication of an ancestral _PROTEIN_ gene after their divergence from _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share only overall sequence similarity with their hydrophobicity profiles are nearly identical . moreover all three of the arabidopsis _METHOD_ possess putative n terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence cleavage sites arv/fff in _PROTEIN_ arv/mff in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . this further reinforces their equivalence with their half molecule homologs from other sources such as and which also localize to this organelle . the closest homolog to the _METHOD_ that does not localize to the _LOCATION_ is schizosaccharomyces pombe a half molecule abc transporter implicated in the transport of phytochelatins that localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in explore their intracellular distributions and determine if they indeed have a mitochondrial localization as indicated by their possession of putative mitochondrial targeting sequence cleavage sites the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused in frame and upstream of the _METHOD_ reporter gene and transformed into arabidopsis . _METHOD_ microscopy of the roots of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants yielded results consistent with a predominantly mitochondrial localization for all three _METHOD_ . in all cases the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was restricted to round or elliptical structures of between and diameter distributed throughout the cytoplasm . as would be expected if the structures visualized were mitochondria counterstaining of the same cells with the _LOCATION_ specific dye mitotracker red demonstrated colocalization of this reagent 's red _METHOD_ with the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ . where there was a difference between the three _METHOD_ was in _METHOD_ of the density and definition of the structures that fluoresced . whereas the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was punctate and well defined the corresponding _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were more diffuse especially for the latter despite the near equivalence of the mitotracker red associated _METHOD_ in all three classes of transformant . rt pcr analyses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the high sequence identity among _PROTEIN_ genes at the dna level especially between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose coding sequences are identical it was anticipated and indeed found that standard northern analyses of the steady state levels of gene specific transcripts would not be practicable . for this reason and because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in tandem on chromosome iv such that the untranslated region of the former might overlap with the untranslated region of the latter the _PROTEIN_ analyses were conducted by rt pcr using gene specific primers . in this way it was determined that the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the three genes were distinguishable . of the three classes of transcript those derived from _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ at the highest levels in all of the tissues examined particularly in flowers siliques _METHOD_ and roots . comparison of these results with the microarray data compiled at genevestigator disclosed the same basic _PROTEIN_ pattern for this gene . by contrast the rt pcrs with primers specific for _PROTEIN_ despite indications of a slight increase in _PROTEIN_ in flowers and roots yielded weak signals _PROTEIN_ of the tissue from which the rna samples were derived . an interesting feature of _PROTEIN_ was its susceptibility to increased _PROTEIN_ in the rosette leaves of plants after a day period of iron deprivation . the _PROTEIN_ patterns for _PROTEIN_ were generally intermediate between those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with relatively high levels in rosette leaves and roots and diminished levels in cauline leaves . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ functional properties of the arabidopsis _METHOD_ were probed through their heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant strain . yeast strain has four distinctive traits it grows very slowly when grown on minimal medium is deficient in respiration mediates constitutive high affinity iron uptake across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and accumulates high mitochondrial levels of iron . each of these properties was monitored in the _PROTEIN_ transformants of strain to assess the capacity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ to simulate the action of wild type yeast _PROTEIN_ . although a basic equivalence with some quantitative differences between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was discernible at all four levels _PROTEIN_ presented a number of _METHOD_ that complicated interpretation of its effects . transformation of strain with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ restored colony size of the _PROTEIN_ mutant on minimal medium to that of the wild type strain _PROTEIN_ indicating that both arabidopsis genes exert similar overall effects . however of the two the effects exerted by _PROTEIN_ were the more pronounced . colonies derived from the _PROTEIN_ transformants were consistently evident days earlier than those derived from the _PROTEIN_ transformants although thereafter the differences between the two classes of transformants diminished . in striking contrast the colonies derived from the _PROTEIN_ transformants _PROTEIN_ of whether they were grown on _PROTEIN_ or galactose medium were indistinguishable from those derived from empty vector transformed strain controls . in investigating this effect further heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was determined to be toxic for yeast . not only strain but also the wild type parental yeast strain _PROTEIN_ grew poorly when transformed with _PROTEIN_ and this effect was seen even when the _PROTEIN_ promoter of the _PROTEIN_ vector should be maximally repressed when _PROTEIN_ is the sole _PROTEIN_ source . exchange of putative targeting sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differential effects of at least two of the three arabidopsis _METHOD_ when heterologously _PROTEIN_ in yeast were not attributable to differences in their putative targeting sequences . after estimating the length of their putative tps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the coding sequences for both tps and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas lacking their endogenous tp coding sequences were amplified and ligated together into to yield constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . colony morphology after growth on minimal medium was then screened after transforming these constructs into yeast strain . as is evident from the results shown in fig . the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to suppress the petite phenotype of _PROTEIN_ yeast strain was similar _PROTEIN_ of whether it retained its endogenous tp or had had it replaced by . an equivalent pattern was seen for _PROTEIN_ it conferred partial suppression either with its own tp or that from _PROTEIN_ . the implication is that the differential effects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are attributable to their core structures rather than their tp sequences . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ after heterologous _PROTEIN_ in the properties of the arabidopsis _METHOD_ after heterologous _PROTEIN_ are to have a direct bearing on their physiological role it is crucial that they localize to the same subcellular structures in yeast as they do in plant cells . this was investigated by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins from the _PROTEIN_ promoter of in _PROTEIN_ mutant strain and the isogenic wild type strain _PROTEIN_ . by this approach it was determined that the activities of the fusions were similar to those of the corresponding native proteins except that the toxicity of _PROTEIN_ was alleviated . although heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suppressed the petite colony phenotype of strain as did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ albeit at lower efficacy _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not . however the c terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ abolished the former 's capacity to inhibit growth of the yeast transformants and yielded a polypeptide that like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ assumed a punctate intracellular localization coincident with that of mito tracker red . as was found for the in planta distribution of the same fusions the mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the yeast transformants was better defined than those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the latter of which had the most diffuse distribution . cellular iron comparison with those of wild type _PROTEIN_ yeast cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant mediated constitutive high affinity iron uptake which was suppressed by the _METHOD_ to extents commensurate with suppression of the _PROTEIN_ petite phenotype . high affinity iron uptake by the _PROTEIN_ transformants was diminished from a level times greater to a level only times greater than wild type . in contrast high affinity uptake by the _PROTEIN_ transformants was diminished by only versus untransformed or empty vector transformed controls . recovery of yeast mitochondrial participation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ in alleviation of the yeast _PROTEIN_ phenotype at the mitochondrial level was examined in three ways by assaying for mitochondrial respiratory function mitochondrial cytochrome levels and mitochondrial iron accumulation . mitochondrial respiratory function was assessed by the tetrazolium overlay technique . in this way it was determined that colonies derived from wild type controls or _PROTEIN_ transformants were competent in the reduction of tetrazolium and stained a deep red color . a similar pattern albeit less clear cut was determined for the colonies derived from _PROTEIN_ transformants . by contrast the majority of the colonies derived from _PROTEIN_ transformants and those from untransformed and empty vector transformed cells lacked this activity and failed to stain red . the origin of the few _PROTEIN_ strain colonies that stained red is not known but may be attributable to rho conversion and/or _LOCATION_ reversion two events that occur at relatively high frequency in this during the course of these investigations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ it was noted that although the mitochondria purified from wild type yeast and those from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transformants were pale brown in color those from untransformed strain were white . suspecting that this might be attributable to gross differences in cytochrome content these mitochondrial preparations were subjected to reduced minus oxidized difference spectrophotometry for cytochromes in general and western analysis for cytochrome c in particular . the results of these analyses are summarized in figs . and respectively . although the difference spectra of mitochondria purified from _PROTEIN_ mutant strain and the same strain after transformation with empty vector were devoid of cytochrome absorbance maxima the equivalent preparations from wild type strain _PROTEIN_ and from _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants and to a lesser extent from _PROTEIN_ transformants yielded clear absorbance maxima at nm characteristic of c type cytochromes . accordingly western blots of the same preparations after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ electrotransfer and immunoreaction with polyclonal antibody raised against yeast cytochrome c demonstrated near wild type levels of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial preparations from _PROTEIN_ cells and _PROTEIN_ cells and an attenuated but readily discernible cytochrome c signal in the preparations from _PROTEIN_ cells . western blots of the same preparations from untransformed or empty vector or _PROTEIN_ transformed cells by contrast lacked cytochrome c . these differences were not attributable to a diminution of the intracellular mitochondrial titer or differences in _LOCATION_ protein yield because the same blots when probed with monoclonal antibody raised against yeast mitochondrial porin yielded a band of similar intensity in all of the preparations . since excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation has been clearly implicated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype the capacity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ to suppress mitochondrial accumulation of this metal was investigated . for this purpose mitochondria were purified from yeast cells that had been incubated in media containing and subjected to liquid scintillation counting to determine their steady state levels of radioactive iron . the results of these analyses were highly instructive . they demonstrated that although the steady levels of in the mitochondrial fractions from empty vector or _PROTEIN_ transformed cells were high the corresponding values for the wild type strain _PROTEIN_ or for the _PROTEIN_ transformants were low . by comparison the steady state levels of mitochondrial established by the _PROTEIN_ transformants were intermediate in magnitude .
yeast strains and yeast . cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ mutants were selected from strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by screening for small colony size and constitutive high affinity cellular iron uptake as described by dancis et al . . after establishing a segregation ratio for the mutants in backcrosses a tetrad from one of these crosses designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was shown to be allelic to an _PROTEIN_ deletion strain provided by dr. jonathan leighton was employed for the experiments described here . this strain and its isogenic wild type _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in ypd liquid medium _PROTEIN_ bactopeptone and yeast extract . all yeast transformations were performed as described previously and the transformants were selected on complete synthetic drop out medium lacking uracil _PROTEIN_ or galactose yeast nitrogen base without amino acids csm ura _PROTEIN_ and agar . cloning of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned by pcr amplification . total rna was isolated from day old arabidopsis seedlings that had been grown in standard liquid _METHOD_ medium in the case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or in liquid _METHOD_ medium containing in the case of _PROTEIN_ using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . cdna was synthesized from the rna extracts using the superscript preamplification system . all of the pcr amplifications were performed using pfu turbo dna polymerase with proofreading activity . the gene specific primers were designed to add a noti restriction site at the end of the gene and a bamhi restriction site at the end . the primer combinations were _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ . the thermal profile used for pcr was as follows min at cycles of s at s at and min at . for heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast the amplified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were subcloned into the multiple cloning site between the constitutive _PROTEIN_ gene promoter and _PROTEIN_ termination sequences of the escherichia coli yeast shuttle vector . because of its toxicity in both e. coli and yeast when subcloned into the amplified cdna for _PROTEIN_ was first cloned into noti and bamhi double digested pbluescript and then into the equivalent of but containing the galactose inducible yeast _PROTEIN_ gene promoter instead of the _PROTEIN_ gene promoter . the fidelity of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs was established by sequencing . ectopic _PROTEIN_ and visualization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions in arabidopsis and the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ constructs described above as templates the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas excluding their stop codons were pcr amplified with pfu turbo dna polymerase . the primer combinations were as follows _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ . after double digestion with ncoi and bglii the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amplification products were cloned into double digested binary vector to generate an in frame c terminal _METHOD_ translational fusion . the corresponding amplification product of _PROTEIN_ was digested with ncoi and cloned into the ncoi site of . the fidelity of the constructs designated pcambia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pcam bia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pcambia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was confirmed by sequencing . for subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions the constructs were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and agrobacterium mediated transformation of arabidopsis by the floral dip method was performed as described by clough and bent . to select transformants harboring the appropriate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct seeds were germinated on _METHOD_ medium containing hygromycin . homozygous and plants were employed for all of the analyses reported here . the subcellular distributions of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions specifically their association with mitochondria was assessed by _METHOD_ microscopy of the transformants after infiltration with mitotracker red . mito tracker red is a cell permeant probe that is concentrated by active mitochondria and retained through interaction of its thiol reactive chloromethyl moiety with intramitochondrial proteins and peptides . ten day old seedlings were submerged in _METHOD_ medium containing nm mitotracker red for min rinsed three times in _METHOD_ medium minus stain and examined under a leica dm irb _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter and fluorescein filter for the visualization of the mitotracker red and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ respectively . the images collected were exported as tiff files and further processed using adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions in yeast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ insertions of the pcambia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pcambia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pcambia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were amplified by pcr using the forward primers _PROTEIN_ f _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ f respectively and the reverse primer _METHOD_ bam . after double digestion with noti and bamhi the amplification products were subcloned into and after confirmation of the fidelity of the constructs by sequencing transformed into yeast strain _PROTEIN_ for selection on csm ura solid medium . for _METHOD_ microscopy the transformants were inoculated into csm ura liquid medium grown at overnight at rpm pelleted by centrifugation at rpm for min and rinsed once with water . the cells were stained for min with nm mitotracker red dissolved in mm hepes buffer ph containing _PROTEIN_ and rinsed in the same medium minus dye for min before _METHOD_ microscopy as described above . rt pcr of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rt pcr analyses of the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ poly rna was isolated from fully expanded rosette leaves flowers roots _METHOD_ siliques and cauline leaves of day old arabidopsis plants using a micropoly pure kit . twenty ng aliquots of the poly samples were reverse transcribed and subjected to pcr as described by hansen et al . using the gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . to verify that equivalent amounts of rna had been amplified the same rna samples were also subjected to rt pcr using primers f and r for arabidopsis actin a constitutively _PROTEIN_ gene . the thermal profile used for pcr was as follows min at cycles for the _METHOD_ or cycles for actin of s at s at and min at . all of the rt pcrs were done in triplicate and the pcr products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis . the gels were documented using a kodak edak gel imager . exchange of putative targeting peptides of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences corresponding to the putative n terminal targeting peptides of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified using signalp and pcr amplified from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using pfu turbo dna polymerase and the primer combinations _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ sma and _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ sma respectively . after double digestion with noti and smai the pcr fragments were cloned into to yield the constructs and . to generate derivatives encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes lacking their endogenous putative targeting peptides were amplified by pcr using the primer combination _PROTEIN_ sma and _PROTEIN_ r and the combination _PROTEIN_ sma and _PROTEIN_ r respectively . the constructs designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were generated by double digesting the pcr products with smai and bamhi and cloning them into double digested or as appropriate . the fidelity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing . measurement of high affinity iron uptake by intact yeast the measurements of high affinity iron uptake by intact yeast cells well microtiter plates containing of ypd medium/well were inoculated with triplicate samples of pyes _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transformed yeast _PROTEIN_ strain or wild type strain _PROTEIN_ and grown at for h. the cultures were then diluted into of ypd in a fresh microtiter plate and incubated for a further h under the same conditions before initiating uptake by the addition of of a solution containing mg/ml sodium ascorbate _PROTEIN_ mm sodium citrate ph and radioactive iron . after uptake for h cell density was estimated by measuring the nm of each well in an microplate reader _PROTEIN_ and the suspensions were vacuum filtered using a phd harvester . the vacuum filters were washed four times with water and the radioactivity retained was determined by liquid scintillation counting . iron uptake was enumerated as accumulation in nm/h after calibration against standards of known radiospecific activity . measurement of yeast mitochondrial iron the measurements of mitochondrial iron uptake by yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant strain after transformation with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and wild type strain _PROTEIN_ after transformation with the transformants were grown in csm ura liquid medium containing copper sulfate and ferric ammonium sulfate at to an nm of before fold dilution of the cultures into the same medium containing the appropriate _PROTEIN_ source . _PROTEIN_ was the _PROTEIN_ source in all cases except for the _PROTEIN_ transformants which were grown in media containing raffinose and galactose instead of _PROTEIN_ . to initiate iron uptake was added to the media and the cultures were incubated at for h after which time the cells were harvested by centrifugation and their mitochondria were purified as described by murakami et al . . mitochondrial content was estimated by liquid scintillation counting . measurements of respiratory competence and mitochondrial cytochrome respiratory competence was assessed by the tetrazolium overlay technique for the identification of respiration deficient yeast . aliquots of liquid growth medium containing or cells from cultures of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transformed _PROTEIN_ cells or from transformed wild type _PROTEIN_ cells were spotted onto the appropriate selective medium grown for days at and overlaid with triphenyltetrazolium chloride . after incubation for h the overlays were photographed . mitochondrial cytochrome content was assessed by both difference spectrophotometry and western analysis . in the former case reduced minus oxidized difference spectra from aliquots of mitochondria purified from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transformed _PROTEIN_ cells or from transformed wild type _PROTEIN_ cells were recorded . the mitochondrial suspensions in mm tris hcl buffer ph containing triton x were first oxidized with potassium ferricyanide and then reduced with potassium dithionite for difference spectrophotometry . in the case of the western analyses the mitochondrial suspensions from the same controls and transformants were subjected to denaturation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ electrotransfer and reaction with polyclonal antibody raised against yeast cytochrome c or monoclonal antibody raised against yeast mitochondrial porin . the blots were probed with mitochondrial porin to verify that equivalent amounts of total mitochondrial protein had been loaded and electrotransferred in each case . immunoreactive bands were visualized by ecl using a supersignal system . of the general reagents were obtained from fisher research organics inc. and sigma .
