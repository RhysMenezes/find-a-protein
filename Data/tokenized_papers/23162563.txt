the permeation pore of k channels is formed by four copies of the pore domain . _PROTEIN_ is the only putative voltage independent k channel subunit of arabidopsis thaliana with a single pore domain . _PROTEIN_ like proteins recently emerged in evolution and to date have been found only in the genus arabidopsis . we show that the absence of _PROTEIN_ does not cause marked changes in growth under various conditions . only under osmotic stress we observed reduced root growth of the _PROTEIN_ null allele line . this phenotype was complemented by _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ mutant with an inactive pore indicating that the function of _PROTEIN_ under osmotic stress does not depend on its direct ability to transport ions . constitutively overexpressed _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are efficiently sorted to the tonoplast indicating that the protein is approved by the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ quality control . however _LOCATION_ isolated from transgenic plants do not have significant alterations in current density . consistently both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are detected as homodimers upon velocity gradient centrifugation an assembly state that would not allow for activity . we conclude that if _PROTEIN_ ever functions as a k channel active tetramers are held by particularly weak interactions are formed only in unknown specific conditions and may require partner proteins .
inactivation of the _PROTEIN_ gene could provide insights on the function of the protein . the t dna insertion mutant was analyzed using t dna left border primer and _PROTEIN_ specific forward and reverse primers . amplification was obtained with both primer sets and showed two head to head t dna insertions at position bp within _PROTEIN_ exon as shown schematically in figure . end point pcr with a couple of _PROTEIN_ specific primers performed on genomic dna from arabidopsis t dna insertion line did not give rise to any product _PROTEIN_ while a fragment of the correct length was obtained from wild type plant dna . the insertion line is therefore a full loss of function mutant and was termed _PROTEIN_ . col and _PROTEIN_ seeds were sown on _METHOD_ medium with sucrose . seven days after sowing the seedlings were grown for days on _METHOD_ medium under long day conditions . no significant differences were observed in root development leaf number and leaf size . the response to osmotic stress or salt stress was tested by supplementing the _METHOD_ medium with mm mannitol or mm nacl . mannitol caused a small but significant _PROTEIN_ of root growth in _PROTEIN_ plantlets with respect to col . this phenotype could be complemented by _PROTEIN_ a dominant negative _PROTEIN_ mutant under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ the dominant negative mutant in the wild type background had no beneficial effect for the plant . upon nacl treatment no difference was observed . the effect of oxidative stress was tested by growing plantlets for days in the presence of mm . both col and _PROTEIN_ showed similar _METHOD_ of bleaching and plant decay . finally growth in medium supplemented with k or mm k was analyzed . no significant differences were observed in the mean values for increase in root length . phenotypic analysis of _PROTEIN_ . growth on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose . the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant do not show significant differences in shoot development and root length . figure is representative of three independent experiments . osmotic stress . the figure is representative of three independent experiments . lower panel increase in root length after days . the values shown are mean of six repeats sd _LOCATION_ . data were analyzed using student s t test . the values obtained for _PROTEIN_ are significantly different from those of the wt control and _PROTEIN_ plants . salt stress . growth of col and _PROTEIN_ plants was severely hampered by the presence of nacl . the figure is representative for three independent experiments . right panel increase in root length after days . the values shown are mean of six repeats sd _LOCATION_ . student s t test revealed that col and _PROTEIN_ are not significantly different . oxidative stress . after five days of stress col and _PROTEIN_ plants showed _METHOD_ such as bleaching of leaves and plant decay . the figure is representative for two independent experiments . k deficient and k sufficient medium . lower panel increase in root length after days was plotted as means sd _LOCATION_ of six repeats . student s t test did not reveal any significant difference between col and _PROTEIN_ . altogether these analyses indicate that the absence of _PROTEIN_ causes small defects in the early stages of plant growth under osmotic stress . these defects could be complemented by a dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ . endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ are very low _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ hampering biochemical and cell biology studies . arabidopsis transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the constitutive camv promoter were therefore produced . transgenic lines selected on the basis of their kanamycin resistance were tested for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation by western blot analysis of leaf extracts using anti _METHOD_ antiserum . extracts from wild type plants did not react with the antiserum . a polypeptide with apparent molecular _METHOD_ around kda was specifically detected in the kanamycin resistant plants . this is in good agreement with the predicted _METHOD_ of the fusion between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ indicating that the kda polypeptide is intact or nearly intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . an additional polypeptide around kda was also detected in some of the transgenic plants often when accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was higher . its molecular _METHOD_ suggests that it corresponds to the entire or nearly entire _METHOD_ sequence released from fusion protein _METHOD_ . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in and generations was highly variable but it became stable in a number of plants and generations . these plants did not show evident morphological and developmental differences compared to the wild type . we reasoned that the detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using the anti _METHOD_ antiserum could limit our studies because this does not allow to follow the destiny of _PROTEIN_ once _METHOD_ has been released . we therefore produced a specific antiserum against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using as antigen amino acids near the n terminal end . to test the specificity of this antiserum equal amounts of total leaf homogenate from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic or control plants were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot with anti _METHOD_ or the immuno affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . no bands were visible in the control sample consistent with the known very low endogenous _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . in the transgenic extract the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum specifically recognized two polypeptides around and kda and as expected did not recognize the kda fragment . the kda polypeptide corresponds to the entire _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion also detected by anti _METHOD_ . at this stage of investigation the kda polypeptide was tentatively identified as a minor proportion of _PROTEIN_ polypeptides not completely denatured and still assembled into dimers . the ratio between these putative dimers and monomers was variable in different experiments . we tested different extraction and denaturation procedures but we were unable to determine conditions in which such a variability could be avoided . selection of arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . equal amounts of leaf extracts from wild type plants and independent transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analysis with anti _METHOD_ antiserum . the positions of the entire fusion protein and of free _METHOD_ are indicated . leaf extracts from one wild type plant and transgenic plant of panel a were analyzed by western blot using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the positions of monomers and putative dimers are indicated . equal amounts of leaf extracts from wild type or independent transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by western blot with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . the positions of _PROTEIN_ and an unspecific cross reacting polypeptide are indicated . in each panel numbers on the left indicate the position and size of molecular _METHOD_ markers . having confirmed the ability of the antiserum to detect _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the camv promoter were prepared . leaf homogenates were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot with the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . a polypeptide with apparent molecular _METHOD_ around kda consistent with the kda calculated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ was detected in the transgenic lines but not in control plants . a polypeptide around kda was also detected in both control and _PROTEIN_ plants however this was not related to _PROTEIN_ because it was also recognized by the pre immune serum . we propagated line from generation but also in the accumulation levels of _PROTEIN_ were variable . we were unable to obtain a line giving constant _PROTEIN_ levels in the progeny possibly because of transgene silencing . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy in leaf and hypocotyl tissues . in leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was clearly detected on the tonoplast . in different cells the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared either continuous or irregularly distributed on the tonoplast with several highly _METHOD_ spots. no colocalization with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed when the _METHOD_ and the brightfield images were superimposed . the tonoplast localization was also observed in hypocotyl cells . the results were confirmed by subcellular fractionation followed by western blot . total microsomes were prepared from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ leaf homogenates loaded onto a continuous sucrose gradient and subjected to isopycnic ultracentrifugation . the distributions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the tonoplast aquaporin were similar and they markedly differed from those of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . monomers have a calculated molecular _METHOD_ around kda but a relevant proportion of the protein is detected as oligomers most probably corresponding to dimers incomplete denaturation resulting in the detection of dimers and tetramers upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a common characteristic of aquaporins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it can be concluded that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ localize at the tonoplast when overexpressed in arabidopsis transgenic plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is located at the tonoplast . leaf epidermis or hypocotyl from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plant were analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ brightfield merge of _METHOD_ and brightfield . the arrow indicates the cell surface . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ co fractionate with a tonoplast marker in isopycnic gradients . young leaves from transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ were homogenized in the presence of sucrose and the absence of detergent . microsomes were pelleted and further separated by centrifugation on isopycnic sucrose gradient . proteins in each fraction were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or endoplasmin _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated at the right of each panel . top of each gradient is at left numbers on top or bottom of the figure indicate fraction density . in order to investigate the functional properties of _PROTEIN_ we performed patch clamp recordings on whole _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . experiments were designed in a way to minimize background currents . the activity of the major cationic ion channels at resting and elevated _LOCATION_ the fast _LOCATION_ and the slow _LOCATION_ channel respectively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced by divalent cations i.e. calcium _PROTEIN_ and magnesium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which were present in the pipette solution at mm concentration . preliminary experiments had revealed normal fv and sv type currents in _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . these data together with the presence of a k channel signature within the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence argue against a possible participation of _PROTEIN_ in the pore formation of these non selective cation channels . the k channel signature in the pore loop and two calcium binding ef hand motifs present in the _PROTEIN_ sequence are features shared by _PROTEIN_ which has been previously shown to encode a activated k selective conductance in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the activity of vk channels is stimulated by acidic _LOCATION_ ph _PROTEIN_ . consequently we probed _PROTEIN_ activity by recording _LOCATION_ currents from isolated _LOCATION_ successively exposed to four different experimental conditions varying the _LOCATION_ concentration at two _LOCATION_ ph values . as summarized in figure the current densities of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing _LOCATION_ were almost identical to those determined for wild type _LOCATION_ at either phcyt . increases of _LOCATION_ generally caused only minor changes in the current amplitudes the slight _PROTEIN_ at phcyt was possibly due to a further reduction of residual fv channel activity while the small increase at phcyt may correspond to the activation of a small population of vk channels . current density versus voltage characteristics recorded in different experimental conditions from _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . current density voltage relationships recorded in the whole _LOCATION_ configuration from _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . bath solutions of ph contained either low calcium or high calcium . the current density difference between high and low calcium conditions was calculated for individual _LOCATION_ and averaged . as in but in bath solutions of ph in low calcium in high calcium difference . in each panel the number of wt or _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ analyzed is given in brackets . in summary these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of overexpressing plants does not constitute a functional ion channel in our experimental conditions . the formation of a tetrameric complex is a prerequisite for ion channel activity in the case of the one p subunit _PROTEIN_ . we therefore investigated on the oligomerization state of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . total leaf homogenate from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants was fractionated by velocity sucrose gradient centrifugations in the presence of non ionic detergent . using this assay we have previously confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a dimer as expected _PROTEIN_ . equal volumes of fractions were analyzed by western blot with anti _METHOD_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antisera . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sedimented slightly slower than the kda marker indicating a dimer of the kda polypeptide . each gradient fraction contains a similar ratio between polypeptides that are fully denatured upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and polypeptides that remain assembled into putative dimers . the co migration of the two _METHOD_ along the gradient strongly suggests that the component around kda really represents dimers . no polypeptides recognized by anti _METHOD_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antisera peaked in the expected position of putative tetramers . free _METHOD_ released from the fusion protein migrated as a monomer and was recognized by the anti _METHOD_ antiserum . this strongly suggests that the _METHOD_ moiety does not have a role in the dimerization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the same behavior had been observed for free _METHOD_ released from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . partial proteolysis also _METHOD_ to occur as indicated by the additional bands detected below the major kda band . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ are dimers . leaves from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants were homogenized in the presence of non ionic detergent and either mm nacl or mm kcl . the homogenates were then subjected to sedimentation velocity centrifugation on a continuous sucrose gradient . one tenth of the total volume of each gradient fraction were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot using anti _METHOD_ antiserum to detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum to detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ anti . top of each gradient is at left . numbers on top indicate the position along the gradient and the molecular _METHOD_ of sedimentation markers . numbers at left indicate the positions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ molecular _METHOD_ markers . to exclude that _METHOD_ appended at the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ impaired tetramerization velocity gradient centrifugation analysis was performed on leaf extracts from _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . fractions were analyzed by western blot with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . _PROTEIN_ sedimented slightly slower than the kda marker indicating that also the wild type protein is a dimer in the conditions used in our analysis . we then tested whether the assembly grade of another multispanning tonoplast protein was preserved in our assay . western blots of gradient fractions were therefore visualized with anti antiserum which is a tetramer peaked as expected between the and kda markers . we conclude that our experimental conditions preserve the correct assembly of another multispanning tonoplast protein . it has been previously reported that tetramerization of the viral k channel kcv was perturbed in the presence of a high concentration of sodium ions but was _PROTEIN_ if mm kcl was used instead of mm nacl _PROTEIN_ . we therefore analyzed the assembly state substituting nacl with kcl in the homogenization and gradient buffers . neither tetramers or monomers of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ could be detected and the assembly state of was not altered as well . therefore stable _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ homodimers are detected in experimental conditions in which the related _PROTEIN_ protein and the other multispanning tonoplast protein _PROTEIN_ their correct assembly properties . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ tetramers are either held together by weaker or very transient interactions or are never formed .

primer sets . pcr was performed with the indicated gene specific primer pair . amplification can be observed in col wild type and _PROTEIN_ . no amplification product is detectable in the homozygous t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ . sacii restriction digestion of the pcr products obtained by amplification with the gene specific primer pair . pcr product from col wild type was not digested . the amplification product from the mutant was digested but some undigested product can also be seen . the pcr product from _PROTEIN_ shows complete digestion . to generate _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants homozygous lines of were crossed with _PROTEIN_ null allele mutant . the seeds obtained from the crossed plants were then screened to procure dominant negative knockout mutant plants of _PROTEIN_ . these _PROTEIN_ were grown again in the next generation under self fertilization condition . seeds thus inherited after self cross were screened by performing pcr reactions to obtain homozygous _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ cdna clones were isolated from cdna preparations of a. thaliana seedlings _PROTEIN_ using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . fragments corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ cdna were subcloned into ppcrii giving rise to the plasmid pcrii _PROTEIN_ . sequence determination was done for three clones as described above . plasmid _PROTEIN_ was generated by inserting the _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ into smai site of pbinar kan _PROTEIN_ . a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion construct was created using pbi _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and fused to _METHOD_ coding sequence via sali/xhoi/spei sites to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated by vacuum infiltration with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain transformed with the constructs _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . kanamycin resistant plants were identified . experiments were conducted using or plants . the following antibodies were used in this study rabbit polyclonal anti _METHOD_ rabbit polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ polyclonal anti raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the c terminal nine amino acids of arabidopsis . an anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ located at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and provided by covalab . the total igg fraction from immunized rabbit was then purified using protein a bead column . the affinity purified antibodies were then subjected to immuno affinity purification passing through a resin column containing the antigenic peptide . this affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ was used at dilution . mesophyll

bit ad/da board . a macintosh personal computer running the pulse program was used to generate the stimulation protocol and to acquire the current records . current records were low pass filtered at hz with a pole bessel filter kemo _PROTEIN_ and sampled at a frequency of khz . all patches with seal resistance lower than gohm were systematically discarded . _LOCATION_ capacitance and access resistance were estimated by using the compensation circuit of the amplifier ra varied from to mohm and was not corrected since the resulting voltage _LOCATION_ did not exceed mv . cm and ra were monitored throughout the experiment . no leak current subtraction procedure was applied . patch pipettes had resistance values of mohm when filled with pipette solution _LOCATION_ containing mm kcl mm

potentials . these currents gradually _PROTEIN_ at all _LOCATION_ potentials and finally stabilized at a slightly positive reversal potential after min in the whole _LOCATION_ configuration depending on the _LOCATION_ size . only _LOCATION_ which reached this point were considered for data analysis and successively exposed to other bath solutions by means of a gravity driven perfusion system coupled to a peristaltic pump . steady state current amplitudes were normalized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ capacitance which was on average ps . data are represented as mean values _PROTEIN_
