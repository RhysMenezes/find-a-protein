subcellular events of _LOCATION_ cichoracearum infections of epidermal cells were visualized in living tissues of arabidopsis plants carrying various green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged organelles via laser scanning confocal microscopy . early in the infection sequence cytoplasm and organelles moved towards penetration sites and accumulated near penetration pegs . _LOCATION_ appeared to accumulate preferentially relative to the cytoplasm at penetration sites . another early event which preceded haustorium formation was the aggregation of some _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker proteins into _PROTEIN_ around penetration sites which extended across cell wall boundaries into neighboring cells . this feature localized to sites where papillae were deposited . the extrahaustorial _LOCATION_ encases the fungal feeding structure the haustorium separating it from the host cytoplasm . eight _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers were excluded from the ehm and remained in a collar like formation around the haustorial neck . these observations support the suggestions that the ehm is a unique specialized _LOCATION_ and is different from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results suggested two possibilities for the origin of the ehm invagination of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ coupled with _LOCATION_ differentiation or de novo synthesis of the ehm by targeted vesicle trafficking .
to visualize the development of haustoria within epidermal cells as well as other fungal structures infected arabidopsis leaves were stained with trypan blue and observed by bright field light microscopy . by hai > of germinated conidia had formed appressoria and haustoria . generally a hypha had also emerged from the conidium opposite the appressorial germ tube suggesting the haustorium was functional and nutrient transfer to the fungus was successful . at dai three elongated fungal hyphae had formed from a single conidium . subsequently these hyphae extended across the leaf surface . conidiophores started to form at dai and by dai the leaves had a powdery appearance which was easily detected by the naked eye . as we were interested in the host subcellular processes that accompany haustorial complex formation we focused our studies on the first hai a period that encompasses the formation of the first haustorium of a developing colony . due to non synchronous conidium germination a wide range of infection stages were observed at a single sampling time . to aid comparisons among different infections of the various arabidopsis lines the infection sequence was divided into four stages based on the presence of host and fungal structures . in stage the conidium had germinated and the germ tube with its appressorium had developed but no penetration into the plant cell was observed . cytoplasmic aggregates often appeared in the host epidermal cell underneath appressoria at this stage . stage was defined as the period in which the appressorium developed a long thin penetration peg which subsequently penetrated the epidermal cell . no haustorium had developed by this stage . stage was defined as the period in which the haustorium first formed at the end of the penetration peg as a swollen elongated sac with a smooth surface . at this stage _LOCATION_ migration from the hypha on the leaf surface into the haustorium was complete and a septum separated the body from the neck . stage was the last stage of the early infection process and was characterized by the occurrence of a haustorium with distinct lobes emanating from the body . by stage a hypha had emerged from the conidium at the side opposite the appressorial germ tube . this sequence of events resembled the infection sequences for other powdery mildews with the exception that the cereal powdery mildews produce a vestigial primary germ tube prior to an appressorial germ tube . in uninfected epidermal leaf cells the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ appeared as a continuous smooth line on the cell periphery inside the cell wall as visualized with all eight _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker lines . during stage no distinguishable fungal structures developed within the plant cell and no invagination or vesiculation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was apparent in the eight _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker lines in infected plant cells . aalternative names in parentheses . bmore information about the markers _METHOD_ can be found at http //deepgreen.stanford.edu cdouble marker lines were created by genetic crossing . ddscs is a novel protein that co localizes with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . is a fusion to a novel protein that localizes to the _LOCATION_ . it contains a short sequence rich in lysine which may act as an _LOCATION_ retention signal . _METHOD_ is a plasmid that _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ gene from a promoter . it is a derivative of the pegad plasmid created by j. griffits and d. ehrhardt . pecad was introduced into col to create line ecad . one of the earliest events observed was the formation of a large _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ signal with several _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker lines prior to fungal penetration into the host epidermal cell . this structure was observed at of penetration sites depending on the marker line in stages and and the frequency of occurrence diminished over time . the diameter of the largest outer _PROTEIN_ corresponded in size roughly to the diameter of the papilla . often a series of one or more smaller _PROTEIN_ was observed arranged in a concentric fashion inside the largest _PROTEIN_ . as reported for the cytoplasmic aggregates and _METHOD_ halos the _PROTEIN_ could cross cell boundaries . anumber of penetration sites with one or more large _PROTEIN_ in stage or infections . btotal number of penetration sites observed . cpercentage of penetration sites with large _PROTEIN_ . in stage many small vesicle like structures were detected near penetration sites . pouch like structures formed near long thin penetration pegs during stages prior to the formation of haustorial bodies . these pouch like structures did not persist . by stages and only a collar of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ around the haustorial neck was observed . beginning in stage and persisting through stage a double annulus structure was observed using _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . this annulus featured two concentric _PROTEIN_ and was much smaller in diameter than the _PROTEIN_ like aggregations of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins observed in stage . from these confocal observations and by comparison with the tem we believe that the inner _PROTEIN_ of the annulus abuts the haustorial neck region . very active _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ dynamics were visible by lscm in infected host epidermal cells . during stages bubble like vesicular structures were observed adjacent to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ both at sites near and distal to the penetration site . smaller vesicular structures were also found at the boundary of the double annulus that encircled the haustorial neck . in stages and when haustorial complexes were present no _METHOD_ labeling of the ehm was observed with any of the eight _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker proteins . rather the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was restricted to a collar like structure encasing the upper part of the haustorial neck region . this labeling pattern was easiest to observe in one of the strongest _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker lines . lines leez and also showed clear labeling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not of the ehm . three additional _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tagged proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also formed a collar around the haustorial neck but were weakly _PROTEIN_ in mature rosette leaves and thus difficult to image . the _METHOD_ tagged marker proteins represent a diverse array of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . a majority of the proteins are tagged with _METHOD_ at the n terminus however the _PROTEIN_ protein is tagged with _METHOD_ at the c terminus . given both the number of protein markers tested and the diversity of their functions it _METHOD_ unlikely that the absence of labeling of the ehm is an anomaly . thus our observations are consistent with the idea that the ehm has characteristics distinct from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . with lscm small lobes extending from the body of mature haustoria of e. cichoracearum were observed . these haustorial lobes were also visible by tem and in isolated haustorial complexes . the lobes appeared to develop last in the mid zone of the haustorium and were more prominent near the neck region and at the base of the haustorium . previous tem studies reported that the e. pisi haustorium developed lobes when mature . most powdery mildew haustoria with the exception of b. graminis haustoria with their extended finger like lobes are round to pear shaped with compact lobes of varying size and number and e. cichoracearum fits this morphological pattern . tem images of e. cichoracearum infected arabidopsis leaves showed the presence of a haustorial neck band an electron dense area along the haustorial neck . the neck band is thought to form a seal between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or ehm and the fungal cell wall . the number of neck bands in e. cichoracearum was unclear from these images . _LOCATION_ pisi and b. graminis f. sp . hordei have at least two haustorial neckbands isolating the haustorial complex from the plant apoplastic space . the origin of these haustorial neckbands is unknown . in isolated haustorial complexes the ehm appeared to be connected to the haustorium only in the neck region above the fungal septum separating the haustorium from the penetration peg . this conclusion was supported by the observation that isolated haustoria either had an intact ehm or completely lacked the ehm . no haustoria with fragments of adhering ehm were recovered as might be expected if the ehm were attached to haustoria at multiple contact points . comparison between in vivo haustorial complexes visualized within an infected cell and isolated haustorial complexes suggested that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ collar encircling the haustorial neck and the haustorial neckbands were coincident . using cytoplasmic _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ we were able to observe movement of cytoplasm toward penetration sites in stages during the infection process . in addition the movements of the various host organelle types in powdery mildew attacked cells were compared individually in infected and uninfected cells using time lapse lscm images of a single focal plane that spanned a period of sec . _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ of an infected host epidermal cell appeared roughly twice as large as that of an uninfected cell . in previous studies this infection associated increase in _LOCATION_ volume was proposed to be due to active transcription and endo reduplication . in addition to increased size the _LOCATION_ moved from its typical position at the bottom of the epidermal cell adjacent to the underlying mesophyll cells closer to the penetration site and developing haustorial complex during the early infection stages as has been observed in compatible cowpea cowpea rust interactions . movement of the _LOCATION_ and of the _LOCATION_ occurred in a similar time frame . the _LOCATION_ appeared as a net like structure closely enveloping the developing haustorial complex with the majority of the _LOCATION_ in this region aggregated at the haustorial neck region . _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ bodies . as shown in figure large numbers of _LOCATION_ had already aggregated underneath appressoria by stage . long distance movement of _LOCATION_ towards penetration sites slowed in _PROTEIN_ stages and _LOCATION_ that had accumulated in the neck area of the haustorial complex remained localized in this region . the _LOCATION_ that had aggregated at penetration sites exhibited _LOCATION_ and short distance movements . aggregations of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ bodies around the haustorial complex neck region were also observed and their behavior was very similar to that of the _LOCATION_ . although organelles occurred at high density adjacent to the haustorial complex none of the _METHOD_ tagged marker proteins appeared in the ehm suggesting there was no transfer of markers between organelles and ehm . one possibility suggested by the accumulation of organelles and cytoplasm at penetration sites was that they were carried together . a prediction from this hypothesis is that the density of organelles per unit of cytoplasm would be similar at sites near and distal to penetration sites . the numbers of _LOCATION_ and amount of cytoplasm were quantified in four concentric zones emanating from a penetration site in a double marker line with _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ and soluble _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm as a means of testing this prediction . the distribution of cytoplasm was highest closest to penetration sites and _PROTEIN_ with increasing distance from penetration sites . similarly the occurrence of _LOCATION_ nearest penetration sites was roughly twice that at more distal sites . however the density of _LOCATION_ was also higher at penetration sites suggesting preferential accumulation of this organelle relative to cytoplasm . aproportion of area in zone occupied by cytoplasm . zones were centered on a fungal penetration site with zone closest to the penetration site . see figure for a description of each zone . bnumber of _LOCATION_ per cytoplasm . cmeasurements were made on five epidermal cells infected by _LOCATION_ cichoracearum . means and standard deviations are shown . data were analyzed by two way anova giving values of p and p _LOCATION_ for the parameter zone . values within a column followed by the same number in parentheses do not differ significantly from each other by fisher 's least significant difference test . _LOCATION_ . the arabidopsis epidermal cell is filled with a large central _LOCATION_ as well as with small _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ were variable in size and shape due to cytoplasmic streaming and vesicle fusions as shown by the line . in an infected cell the haustorial complex was closely surrounded by the tonoplast . tem images from previous studies show that the ehm is a separate _LOCATION_ from the tonoplast . in addition in the ecad double marker line a thin layer of cytoplasm separated the tonoplast from the haustorial complex showing that the tonoplast is a separate _LOCATION_ from the ehm and that the ehm does not contain the _METHOD_ marker .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds of lines carrying _METHOD_ tagged organelle markers were developed by d.e . and sean cutler . _METHOD_ versions of some markers were created by d.e . and r. kamyar carnegie institution . double marker lines ecad and ecad were newly generated in this study by genetic crossing . the list of single or double marker lines used in this study is presented in table . seeds were disinfested with ethanol rinsed with sterile water and air dried . seeds were then mixed with agar and planted on nutrient agar plates _METHOD_ . germinating seeds were cold treated at for days and then placed in a growth chamber . five to seven days post germination plants were screened for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using a dissecting microscope _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ equipped with a mercury lamp and the _METHOD_ filter set specifically designed for viewing _METHOD_ in plant tissues . plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were then transferred to soil and placed in a growth chamber with growth conditions as above . _METHOD_ seedlings were selected using the lscm with an he/cd laser . the powdery mildew fungus _LOCATION_ cichoracearum was _PROTEIN_ on compatible squash plants variety kuta in a growth chamber with the same light cycle as above . the inoculum was prepared by touching uninfected squash leaves with previously infected squash leaves days before use in arabidopsis inoculations . arabidopsis seedlings weeks old were infected by shaking e. cichoracearum infected squash leaves over pots containing the seedlings . the pots were placed in a high humidity chamber for h then moved to growth chambers . infected true leaves were then examined at different time points after inoculation using a leica stereoscope after staining the leaves with trypan blue solution . images were captured using a leica camera and processed using adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . arabidopsis seedlings weeks old were inoculated as described above . infected leaves were then examined at different time points after inoculation by staining leaves in either propidium iodide solution or fm solution to visualize the fungal structures . haustorial complexes in the epidermal cells were observed on a nikon diaphot inverted _METHOD_ microscope equipped with nikon numerical aperture water immersion objective and a bio rad mrc confocal head . the samples were excited with two lasers at the following wavelengths nm _METHOD_ nm _METHOD_ _METHOD_ nm . collected image data sets were subsequently analyzed with the digital image analyzing _METHOD_ imagej ver . volocity and adobe photoshop . detection of callose in papillae was done with an anti callose monoclonal antibody followed by a secondary antibody labeled with alexa . for the data presented in figure and table _LOCATION_ number and cytoplasm content were measured from single confocal sections in defined regions emanating from penetration sites by metamorph ver . . to do this four annulus shaped zones centered on a penetration site were created . the innermost zone was a circle with a diameter of . zone was an annulus in diameter zone an annulus in diameter and zone an annulus in diameter . a threshold signal intensity for the _METHOD_ from ecad was set when determining the proportion of the area of each zone occupied by cytoplasm . the marker protein tagged with _METHOD_ was used to mark _LOCATION_ and the number of _LOCATION_ per zone was counted . arabidopsis seedlings weeks old were inoculated as described above . at hai infected leaves were cut and fixed in glutaraldehyde for h. fixed tissues were rinsed in m potassium phosphate buffer and post fixed in for h. after rinsing in m potassium phosphate buffer samples were dehydrated in series of ethanol and embedded in spurr 's resin _PROTEIN_ . thin sections were stained in uranyl acetate followed by m lead citrate and viewed with a philips transmission electron microscope . intact haustorial complexes were isolated according to the protocol of citation from e. cichoracearum infected kuta squash leaves . isolated haustorial complexes were stained with fm solution or propidium iodide and visualized by lscm . collected z series image data sets were subsequently transferred to the digital image analyzing program volocity for volume rendering .
