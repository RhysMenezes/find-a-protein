n terminal fatty acylations _PROTEIN_ are crucial modifications affecting to of eukaryotic proteins . the role of these modifications is to target proteins to _LOCATION_ . predictive tools have revealed unexpected targets of these acylations in arabidopsis thaliana and other plants . however little is known about how n terminal lipidation governs _LOCATION_ compartmentalization of proteins in plants . we show here that h type thioredoxins cluster in four evolutionary subgroups displaying strictly conserved n terminal modifications . it was predicted that one subgroup undergoes only myr and another undergoes both myr and _PROTEIN_ . we used plant trxs as a model protein family to explore the effect of myr alone or myr and _PROTEIN_ in the same family of proteins . we used a high throughput biochemical strategy to assess myr of specific trxs . moreover various trx green _METHOD_ protein fusions revealed that myr localized protein to the endomembrane system and that partitioning between this _LOCATION_ compartment and the _LOCATION_ correlated with the catalytic efficiency of the n myristoyltransferase acting at the n terminus of the trxs . generalization of these results was obtained using several randomly selected arabidopsis proteins displaying a myr site only . finally we demonstrated that a palmitoylatable cys residue flanking the myr site is crucial to localize proteins to micropatching zones of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
by using a combination of predictive software with in vitro assays designed in our laboratory we predicted previously that > arabidopsis proteins could undergo myr . this number included certain plant h trxs of which only one had been found to be myred in vitro arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the h trx sequences identified in several plant genomes to uncover possible evolutionary clues about the origin of myr in the plant h trx family . all arabidopsis h trxs obtained from the last version of tair were used for alignment by blast with four other available complete genomes . we identified and unique open reading frames within these complete genomes respectively . in addition some classical h trxs already characterized in the literature were added to this h trx sequence corpus . a phylogenic tree built with those sequences showed that they clustered in four subgroups . all trx sequences were next submitted to the online prediction tool terminator a program that we designed to efficiently predict several n terminal modifications such as nme n acetylation myr and _PROTEIN_ . the result reveals that virtually all tested plant h trxs are predicted to undergo nme the first irreversible proteolytic modification affecting > of plant proteins . surprisingly we found a modification pattern associated with the subgrouping of h trxs that was not limited to nme but extended to n terminal acylations _PROTEIN_ . in depth analysis demonstrated that all h trxs from subgroups and are characterized by the presence of an n terminal extension . all h trxs of both subgroups showed a conserved gly residue in position a feature indispensable for myr . subgroup h trxs were predicted to undergo myr only . by contrast subgroup h trxs were predicted to undergo double acylation _PROTEIN_ of their n terminal extensions . indeed all h trxs of subgroup possess not only gly but also a conserved cys residue predicted by both terminator and css palm software to be palmitoylated _PROTEIN_ . unlike h trxs from subgroups and all h trxs of subgroup were predicted to undergo nac one of the most common protein modifications . interestingly all h trxs from subgroup showed a highly conserved ala residue in position . this suggests that nata one of the n acetyl transferases responsible for nac acts after nme to acetylate h trxs from subgroup . finally subgroup h trxs were predicted to be _PROTEIN_ n terminal acetylated and never acylated _PROTEIN_ . moreover a majority of these proteins was predicted to retain the initial met residue suggesting that n terminal acetylation is catalyzed by natb or natc complexes and not nata as is the case for subgroup h trxs . interestingly the trxs of subgroup do not contain a clear n terminal extension and consistently present an alternative monothiol active center . chlamydomonas reinhardtii was included in our predictive study because gly occurs in both of the h trxs in its genome however these open reading frames are predicted to be neither myred nor naced . our extensive analysis of the n terminal sequences of all plant h trxs allowed us to propose that modification of the n terminus is conserved in each subgroup across species . it is noteworthy that the lipidations predicted in the trx family are exclusively found within plant h trxs . no other trxs from plants or other _METHOD_ were predicted to be myred because these sequences do not possess the indispensable gly residue . the amino acid sequence at the n termini of h trxs substantially varies unlike the type of modification itself which indicates strong selective pressure caused by the crucial physiological role of the modification in plant h trxs . is a very accurate predictor of nme and nac but its reliability remains limited for myr . in order to confirm our predictions about possible myr of h trxs we measured the capacity of the n terminal octapeptides to undergo myr in vitro in a reconstituted myr assay . this assay has been described to more efficiently test n myr using peptides than using entire proteins most likely because this modification occurs very early during protein biosynthesis immediately after nme . for each peptide the catalytic efficiency of the nmt enzyme was determined . this value reflects the probability of myr for each protein . when s the sequence can not be modified in vitro or in vivo whereas when s > the corresponding sequence is myred in vitro and most likely in vivo also . the higher the s value the more likely myr occurs in vivo . we measured the s values for each of the peptides derived from the arabidopsis h trxs predicted to be myred . as negative controls we used versions of the peptides with the _PROTEIN_ mutation because it is well known that the lack of a terminal gly completely abolishes n myr . we also used a peptide derived from a well characterized non myred protein from arabidopsis that possesses the critical gly residue _PROTEIN_ . as positive controls we used several peptides derived from arabidopsis proteins previously shown to be myred _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the data in table show that all peptides derived from the arabidopsis trxs were efficiently myred in vitro . by contrast none of the corresponding _PROTEIN_ peptides were myred in vitro . several peptides derived from h trxs from different plants predicted to be myred by our prediction tool were also assayed . in line with the predictions all these peptides were efficiently myred in vitro . finally in vitro analysis of one of the two peptides derived from h trxs from the algae c. reinhardtii confirmed that they are not substrates of arabidopsis nmt . collectively these data indicate that all peptides from subgroup and h trxs clearly undergo myr in vitro . the efficiency of myr depended on the peptide with myr s scores in the range of to . together with the accuracy of predicting nme and nac in plants this study suggests that the tight correlation observed between the four subgroups and the modification is robust and relevant to the physiological role of each h trx type . plant h trxs have long been considered soluble proteins due to the lack of transit peptides . in the case of the subgroup members only a couple of localization experiments have been reported . these include arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and p. trichocarpa _PROTEIN_ which were described as soluble and mitochondrial proteins respectively . because we demonstrated that all peptides derived from the n termini of trxs of subgroup can be myred and n myr usually promotes _LOCATION_ interactions by enhancing the hydrophobicity of the protein we questioned whether myred arabidopsis trxs of subgroup exhibit a specific _LOCATION_ compartment distribution . full length trxs and were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ and the associated steady state subcellular localization was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy in epidermal onion cells . _METHOD_ alone is a soluble protein localized in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . using confocal laser scanning microscopy the _LOCATION_ fraction of epidermal cells is _PROTEIN_ seen as a cortical fraction near the pm due to the presence of a fully expanded cell _LOCATION_ . in addition the _METHOD_ signal can also be observed in the transvacuolar strands which represent cytoplasmic tunnels that traverse the lumen of the continuous _LOCATION_ that are perpetually remodeled . all full length arabidopsis trx _METHOD_ fusion proteins assayed showed very different subcellular localization patterns compared with that of _METHOD_ alone . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a pattern consisting of numerous spots . these spots were merged in a weak three dimensional network along the cortical cytoplasm that usually _METHOD_ a _PROTEIN_ structure around the _LOCATION_ . similar results were found with other trxs from subgroup arabidopsis and . both proteins were localized as spots around the _LOCATION_ . this specific subcellular localization of all trxs from subgroup was strictly dependent on the capacity of the protein to be myred as all _PROTEIN_ substitutions in the corresponding trx induced relocalization of the _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ with a pattern most similar to that obtained with _METHOD_ alone . these data suggest that the myr site on all h trxs from subgroup was necessary to target the protein to these specific subcellular localization sites . the morphology of the spots in which all subgroup h trxs were targeted strongly suggested targeting to the endomembrane compartment . indeed coexpression of each trx _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ marker protein _PROTEIN_ from soybean encoding the resident _LOCATION_ protein mannosidase i fused with the _METHOD_ protein mcherry showed clear colocalization of _METHOD_ and mcherry fusion proteins for all constructs . next we questioned whether the n terminal monolipidated protein sequences of all tested h trxs of subgroup were not only necessary but also sufficient to target the protein to the _LOCATION_ compartment . thus we fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ several fragments of different lengths for each n terminal extension . we then tested their ability to target _METHOD_ to the specific compartments observed with the full length trx versions . this progressive truncation analysis of the c terminus of subgroup h trxs revealed that the first amino acids from each trx were enough to target _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ apparatus in the same way as the full length proteins . this indicates that the n terminal amino acids alone determine in vivo targeting of h trxs fully mimicking the full length protein steady state location . it is noteworthy that this short residue stretch contains both nme and myr recognition patterns which respectively encompass residues to and to . both modifications are required to promote myr in vivo . we next studied the cellular localization of several variants with point mutations at each of the first residues of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . we ensured that these variants were still predicted to be n myred . all variants were clearly enriched in the endomembrane system . we also altered several positions of other arabidopsis subgroup h trxs with potential roles in localization . these included the negative charges displayed by at asp or _PROTEIN_ at ser which is highly conserved in almost all subgroup h trxs . electrostatic interactions have been shown to be effective in supporting _LOCATION_ links of myred proteins and ser residues can be involved in phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events that could also be indirectly involved in _LOCATION_ bonds . substitutions of ser of _PROTEIN_ and asp of both in the context of the first residues and the full length _METHOD_ fusion proteins were analyzed by confocal microscopy . the localization patterns were identical to those obtained with the respective wild type _METHOD_ . together the above data unambiguously indicate that myr alone is responsible for the specific _LOCATION_ localization of subgroup h trxs and that this effect is unrelated to the sequence itself but rather to its unique capacity to undergo myr in vivo . this explains why the first amino acids are necessary and sufficient to induce proper localization provided they are myred . whereas primarily _LOCATION_ compartment association has been detected for all h trxs of subgroup arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ yielded additionally a measurable soluble fraction which varied from one fusion to another . the extent of the distribution of the protein between the _LOCATION_ compartment and the _LOCATION_ was independent of the length of the fusion . this strongly suggested that the partitioning was only related to the myr signal . quantitative ratiometric analysis of the accumulation at the endomembrane system over the _LOCATION_ of the different trx _METHOD_ fusion proteins clearly showed that the partitioning between the two compartments depended only on the nature of the n terminal sequence of the subgroup h trx analyzed . this analysis showed that all constructs predominantly targeted _METHOD_ to the surface of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . nevertheless an increase of _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ when we used the n terminus of arabidopsis or compared with _PROTEIN_ in parallel with a concomitant _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ compartment or compared with _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ protein fractions of the above transfected cells confirmed that all subgroup h trxs predominantly retargeted _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ compartment with a distribution strongly correlating the in vivo results . intriguingly this different partitioning of the _METHOD_ between the _LOCATION_ compartment and the cytoplasm strongly correlates with the in vitro s score for myr of each h trx . a proportionally higher s value such as that found for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was associated with augmented _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ compartment whereas the low in vitro s value of and was associated with a more balanced _METHOD_ distribution between the _LOCATION_ compartment and the _LOCATION_ . this tight relationship between subcellular protein partitioning and the efficiency of _PROTEIN_ to myristoylate the h trxs of subgroup led us to question whether this could be generalized to other myred substrates unrelated to trxs . in order to investigate this issue we selected a set of six proteins unrelated to redoxins such as trxs from the arabidopsis n myristoylome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we were careful to select myred proteins that did not display any evident second signal including palmitoylation sites in the vicinity of the myr site similar to subgroup trxs . we confirmed that all six octapeptides derived from the n termini of the proteins were myred in vitro with efficiencies depending on the peptide . s values ranged from to . when fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells the six fusion proteins conferred steady state _LOCATION_ compartment localization of _METHOD_ . as already observed with the trxs of subgroup the degree of _LOCATION_ compartment enrichment was proportional to the efficiency of the nmt enzyme to myristoylate the given peptide . we concluded that this kinetic trapping of a myred sequence is an essential aspect of the spatial organization of myred substrates devoid of any apparent second signal in the n myristoylome of arabidopsis . we used _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments on cells transfected with subgroup h trxs to investigate quantify and _PROTEIN_ protein mobility and exchange between free _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bound trx protein pools in living cells . first to determine whether the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pools of h trxs of subgroup are in dynamic equilibrium we performed in vivo fluorochrome photobleaching on spherical _LOCATION_ stacks _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ treated for min prior to imaging with latrunculin b to disrupt _LOCATION_ movement . we monitored the recovery of _METHOD_ into the circular region of interest as a function of time by scanning the specimen at low laser intensity . the addition of latrunculin b changed neither the localization nor the partitioning of our constructs . using a nonlinear curve fitting approach we observed significant differences between constructs in the recovery kinetics recorded during to s at hz . extremely rapid initial recovery after photobleaching is observed in the cytoplasm due to fast diffusion and cytoplasmic streaming . however following photobleaching of _LOCATION_ associated signal we observed only a gradual and continuous _METHOD_ recovery in cells transfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . quantitative analysis of several independent frap experiments revealed an average half time of s for the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to restore the _LOCATION_ bleached area to a relatively high level . frap curves showed a two phase type recovery after bleaching resembling a diffusion uncoupled behavior . this diffusion uncoupled frap recovery curve consists of a small fast recovery attributed to peripheral diffusion and a medium/slow recovery due to exchange at binding sites . these data show that in s of the initial level of h trxs of subgroup can be restored to _LOCATION_ by traffic from _LOCATION_ suggesting that most of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ corresponds to myred protein _METHOD_ and that the corresponding _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ pools are in dynamic equilibrium as previously shown for other myred proteins . by contrast recovery kinetics from frap experiments involving arabidopsis _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ resembled one another but were different to those for _PROTEIN_ . the higher initial level of _METHOD_ occurring in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ gave rise to an apparent three phase recovery process in which an extremely rapid initial recovery most of which was due to cytoplasmic streaming is followed by a still rapid recovery and then a plateau at only for _METHOD_ and for _METHOD_ of the initial _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the mobile fraction for both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was slightly but significantly reduced compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this reduced protein mobility for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ indicates that the _LOCATION_ components of these two proteins were less efficiently targeted to the _LOCATION_ compartment compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . nevertheless the high recovery at the bleached _LOCATION_ for all h trxs of subgroup suggests that the _LOCATION_ pool of these proteins is composed mostly of myred proteins able to relocalize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ thanks to the myred portion and a variable amount of non myred counterpart unable to bind the _LOCATION_ . to verify this hypothesis we overexpressed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in cells transfected with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . a reduction of _METHOD_ was observed at the level of the _LOCATION_ with a relative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ partitioning being increased and becoming more similar to that observed with _PROTEIN_ . this is in agreement with a small proportion of the nmt targets being under modified or incorrectly modified in vivo as a result of too low myr catalytic efficiency . together our results strongly suggest that the _LOCATION_ fraction of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ consists of both a nondynamic pool of non myred _METHOD_ of these proteins resulting from their poor myr catalytic efficiency by nmt and a significant amount of myred proteins being fully available for dynamic exchange with the _LOCATION_ compartment . this _PROTEIN_ observation is fully in keeping with the low binding constant of the solely myr proteins to a _LOCATION_ compartment as measured previously in liposomes . as reported above subgroup h trxs are not only in vitro myred but also predicted to be _PROTEIN_ due to the presence of conserved cys residues in their n terminal extensions . the localization of both subgroup h trxs was analyzed by confocal microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ pattern was completely different from subgroup h trxs . the localization of both and _PROTEIN_ clearly showed strong enrichment at the pm . interestingly was also found at plasmodesmata which was never found with _PROTEIN_ or other trxs . even if the majority of was localized to the pm reduced fractions of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ were also located in spots similar to those observed with subgroup h trxs . indeed coexpression experiments with both and the mcherry labeled _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ showed colocalization at the level of the _LOCATION_ compartment _LOCATION_ . this enrichment likely occurred due to anterograde transport of _PROTEIN_ via the secretory pathway as recently shown for several double acylated proteins in mammals . impeding myr in both h trxs of subgroup with the _PROTEIN_ mutation restored the diffuse _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ distribution observed with _METHOD_ alone indicating that myr is a prerequisite for the subcellular localization . to assess whether the n terminal extensions containing both myr and _PROTEIN_ sites induced specific subcellular localization of these trxs at the pm we fused c terminally truncated versions of and _PROTEIN_ to the n terminus of _METHOD_ and we tested their ability to target _METHOD_ to the pm . as observed for the h trxs of subgroup the first n terminal amino acids alone faithfully mimicked full length protein localization . the first amino acids of targeted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the pm . in the case of _PROTEIN_ three cys residues are present at positions and and all are predicted to undergo _PROTEIN_ . the study of different n terminal fragments fused to _METHOD_ reveals that only the first residues gave the same pm localization of the full length protein . cotransfection of _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with an mcherry labeled pm marker based on the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ a pm aquaporin confirmed that _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ localized to the pm . in agreement with the above data immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy on ultrathin sections of epidermal onion cells transformed with _METHOD_ confirmed the presence of the protein at the pm . interestingly the gold particles were predominantly found in distinct patched areas regularly spaced in nm paths . this accumulation of the protein in defined sites of the pm may reflect enrichment of the myred and _PROTEIN_ in functional microdomains . finally frap experiments on small regions of pm of cells transfected with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ showed a relatively high mobility of these proteins with frap curves comparable to those recently reported for pm targeted myred and _PROTEIN_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ . all subgroup h trxs show conserved cys residues close to the myred gly and are predicted to be _PROTEIN_ by both terminator and css palm . we recently established that > of the n myristoylome shows conserved _PROTEIN_ cys residues close to the myristoylable gly . _PROTEIN_ is generally an n myr dependent acylation usually described as a reversible second signal in several myred proteins targeting the protein specifically to the pm . is a mono _PROTEIN_ protein showing a highly conserved cys residue at position next to the myristoylable gly . _PROTEIN_ together with displays a more complex pattern because of the occurrence of seven cys residues predicted as _PROTEIN_ in the n terminal extension . the cys to ser substitution is known to abolish _PROTEIN_ this modification only changes the sulfur atom of cys into oxygen abolishing _PROTEIN_ reactivity . to investigate whether the aforementioned cys residues corresponded to the second signals inducing pm localization of subgroup proteins we studied cys to ser substitution in the context of both the full length and the residue version of fused to _METHOD_ . pm trapping was blocked by replacement of the target cys with ser . remarkably both and mutants exhibited an enrichment in _LOCATION_ structures a pattern identical to that observed with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly myr of the octapeptide variant was confirmed using the terminator software and in vitro studies revealing an s value slightly increased compared to the wild type version . both single _PROTEIN_ or double variants _PROTEIN_ of the fusions showed only soluble _METHOD_ signal supporting the idea that myr was necessary but not sufficient to induce pm localization . similar results were observed with the mutated full length protein . to investigate the requirement of multiple n terminal palmitoylable cys residues close to the myristoylable site of _PROTEIN_ we substituted the different cys residues at positions and making single or triple substitutions . the mutant showed reduced pm localization and the appearance of a _LOCATION_ distribution . by contrast the triple variant showed no pm labeling and a distribution of the _METHOD_ between the _LOCATION_ compartment and the cytoplasm similar to that of non _PROTEIN_ myred proteins featuring low s values . the increase of non _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ is in agreement with the reduced s value observed upon substitution in the peptide compared with the wild type version . the _METHOD_ distribution induced by the double substitutions _PROTEIN_ did not show any preference for a particular _LOCATION_ compartment pointing out the critical importance of these two residues in protein localization . previous studied have demonstrated that the reducing agent dtt mimics the effect of depalmitoylation in which the palmitate is reversibly removed by dedicated enzymes . addition of dtt to protein extracts induces palmitate release from _PROTEIN_ proteins . this induces a faster migrating protein species in highly resolving _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ runs . to confirm s acylation of subgroup h trxs we analyzed the protein extracts corresponding to the cells used for confocal microscopy treated with mm dtt or a control prior to separating the proteins by high resolution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as previously reported for other myred and _PROTEIN_ proteins we observed a partial shift for both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ treated with mm dtt relative to that of _METHOD_ . in contrast with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from m or s fractions did not display any difference of its mobility after dtt treatment . this suggests that the cys to ser substituted version of the protein is no longer acylated unlike the wild type version . addition of dtt to living material was already shown to remove the s linked palmitates from _PROTEIN_ proteins in living cells and to result in loss of raft phase association . similar to the effect of the cys to ser substitution in _METHOD_ and cys cys and cys to ser substitutions in _METHOD_ we observed that in vivo dtt treatment induced immediate translocation of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins from the pm to the _LOCATION_ compartment . no alteration of protein localization pattern was observed when dtt was used on cells _PROTEIN_ non _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ versions including the cys substituted versions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the various subgroup h trxs the _LOCATION_ marker and _METHOD_ alone . this _METHOD_ that dtt only has a specific in vivo effect on the localization of palmitoylatable _METHOD_ fusions . our results are in strong agreement with very recent published data showing by an independent targeted proteomic approach that indeed belongs to the pool of identified _PROTEIN_ proteins of arabidopsis .
