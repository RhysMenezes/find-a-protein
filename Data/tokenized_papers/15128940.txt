helix hairpin helix dna glycosylases are typically small proteins that initiate repair of dna by excising damaged or mispaired bases . an invariant aspartic acid in the active site is involved in catalyzing the excision reaction . replacement of this critical residue with an asparagine severely reduces catalytic activity but preserves enzyme stability and structure . the arabidopsis demeter _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a large aa polypeptide with a aa dna glycosylase domain . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ primarily in the central cell of the female gametophyte . _PROTEIN_ activates maternal allele _PROTEIN_ of the imprinted medea _PROTEIN_ gene in the central cell and is required for seed viability . we mutated the invariant aspartic acid at position in _PROTEIN_ to asparagine to determine whether the catalytic activity of the dna glycosylase domain is required for _PROTEIN_ function in vivo . transgenes _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ in the central cell rescue seed abortion caused by a mutation in the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene and activate maternal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcription . however transgenes _PROTEIN_ the mutant _PROTEIN_ do not rescue seed abortion or activate maternal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcription . whereas ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the wild type _PROTEIN_ polypeptide in pollen is sufficient to activate ectopic paternal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ equivalent _PROTEIN_ of the mutant _PROTEIN_ in pollen failed to do so . these results show that the conserved aspartic acid residue is necessary for _PROTEIN_ to function in vivo and suggest that an active dna glycosylase domain normally associated with dna repair promotes gene transcription that is essential for gene imprinting .
the invariant aspartic acid is essential for seed viability . we mutated the conserved aspartic acid at position to asparagine to determine whether dna glycosylase activity is critical for _PROTEIN_ function . the full length cdna clone with the mutation _PROTEIN_ as well as the control wild type full length _PROTEIN_ cdna clone was ligated to kb of _PROTEIN_ flanking sequences that activate transcription in the central cell of the female gametophyte . we transformed arabidopsis plants with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and obtained four independently isolated transgenic lines designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . we also transformed arabidopsis plants with the control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene and obtained four independently isolated transgenic lines designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . transgenes were crossed into a dme heterozygous background so that we could compare the function of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins during seed development . wild type arabidopsis seeds rarely abort . self pollinated heterozygous _PROTEIN_ siliques display seed abortion because seed viability depends on the presence of a wild type maternal _PROTEIN_ allele . seeds that inherit a wild type maternal _PROTEIN_ allele are viable and seeds that inherit the mutant maternal dme allele abort . self pollinated heterozygous _PROTEIN_ siliques that are also hemizygous for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene show a reduced level of seed abortion . two transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed seed abortion . in these two lines inheritance of a mutant dme allele and a transgene produced a viable seed indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene had suppressed the dme allele and rescued seed viability . two other transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed seed abortion and therefore partially suppressed the dme mutation . by contrast four independent lines heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for a mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene had siliques with seed abortion indicating that seeds with a dme allele and the mutant transgene were not viable indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene had not suppressed the dme mutant allele . these results show that the conserved aspartic acid is essential for _PROTEIN_ function in developing seeds . transmission of a maternal mutant dme allele is a more sensitive assay to compare _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function during seed development . none of the viable progeny inherit the maternal mutant dme allele when a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plant is pollinated with wild type pollen confirming the importance of the wild type maternal _PROTEIN_ allele during seed development . when a plant that is heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene is pollinated with wild type pollen viable progeny are detected that inherit both the maternal mutant dme allele and the transgene indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene suppressed the dme mutant allele . however when a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ hemizygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant is pollinated with wild type pollen the frequency of progeny that inherit the maternal mutant dme allele and the transgene is reduced fold . these results suggest that the mutation severely reduces but does not completely abolish _PROTEIN_ activity during seed development . this is consistent with the finding that some glycosylases retain slight activity after mutation of the aspartic acid to asparagine . the invariant aspartic acid is required for activation of maternal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcription in the central cell . essentially all prefertilization ovules from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ homozygous plants showed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the central cell _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the transcription of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene in the central cell of the female gametophyte and plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ display a segregation ratio of _METHOD_ to _METHOD_ ovules . to determine whether dna glycosylase activity is critical for _PROTEIN_ gene activation we analyzed the effect of the mutation on transcription of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . in plants homozygous for a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene we detected a segregation ratio of _METHOD_ to _METHOD_ ovules . these results suggest that female gametophytes inheriting dme and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene transcribed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene suppressed the dme mutant allele . by contrast in plants homozygous for a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene we detected a segregation ratio of _METHOD_ to _METHOD_ ovules . this result suggests that the female gametophytes inheriting dme and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene did not transcribe the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not suppress the dme mutant allele . thus the conserved aspartic acid is essential for activation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcription by _PROTEIN_ . the invariant aspartic acid is required for ectopic paternal _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the leaf and endosperm is sufficient to induce _PROTEIN_ and paternal _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ respectively . these results suggest that restriction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the central cell of the female gametophyte is responsible at least in part for _PROTEIN_ imprinting in the endosperm . consistent with this model _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ paternal allele rna is not detected in the male gametophyte pollen and gus staining is not detected in _PROTEIN_ gus or _PROTEIN_ promoter ligated to gus cdna _PROTEIN_ transgenic pollen . thus the pollen provides an opportunity to compare the ectopic activation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a cellular environment that is free from endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we generated camv _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines where transcription of the wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna is under the control of the camv promoter . here we show that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnas were present in pollen from independently isolated camv _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ in pollen is sufficient to activate paternal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and supports the model that preventing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the male gametophyte is necessar y for _PROTEIN_ gene imprinting . by contrast _PROTEIN_ rna but not _PROTEIN_ rna was detected in pollen harvested from multiple independently isolated camv _PROTEIN_ lines that _PROTEIN_ the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . the level of mutant _PROTEIN_ and wild type _PROTEIN_ rnas were similar in pollen harvested from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines respectively suggesting that the failure to induce _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines is due to the replacement of aspartic acid by asparagine in the _PROTEIN_ dna glycosylase active site . we also crossed the camv _PROTEIN_ and camv _PROTEIN_ transgenes into a _PROTEIN_ gus genetic background . we detected gus staining in pollen grains from plants hemizygous for a camv _PROTEIN_ transgene and hemizygous for a _PROTEIN_ gus transgene . by contrast no gus staining was detected in plants hemizygous for camv _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus transgenes . these results suggest that active _PROTEIN_ dna glycosylase is essential for activation of _PROTEIN_ gene transcription in pollen .
