mutations in have been implicated in parkinson disease . _PROTEIN_ is a neuroprotective serine protease however little is known about how _PROTEIN_ confers stress protection and which protein targets are directly affected by _PROTEIN_ . we have reported that arabidopsis thaliana represents a complementary pd model and here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ similar to human _PROTEIN_ is a mitochondrial protease . we show that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are induced by heat stress but not by other stress conditions including oxidative stress and metals . our data show that elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ confer thermotolerance in a. thaliana . increased temperatures accelerate protein unfolding and we demonstrate that although _PROTEIN_ can act on native protein substrates unfolded proteins represent better _PROTEIN_ substrates . the results further show that _PROTEIN_ and can degrade the pd proteins synuclein and dj directly without autophagy involvement and that misfolded snca and dj represent better substrates than their native counterparts . comparative proteomic profiling revealed _PROTEIN_ mediated proteome changes and we identified four proteins that show altered abundance in response to _PROTEIN_ overexpression and elevated temperatures . our study not only suggests that _PROTEIN_ confers thermotolerance by degrading misfolded protein targets but it also provides new insight into possible roles of this protease in neurodegeneration .
to investigate the conservation of _PROTEIN_ across species we performed prediction analysis suggesting that the arabidopsis endopeptidase is similar to the human _PROTEIN_ . multiple sequence alignment analyses revealed however low sequence conservation beyond amino acid residue within the conserved pdz domain . we cloned the _GENE_ cdna _PROTEIN_ revealing an extension of exon by nucleotides and a shift in the reading frame leading to the conversion of intron into an exonic sequence effectively fusing exons and . the cloned full length _PROTEIN_ is similar to _PROTEIN_ from humans drosophila and zebrafish showing high similarity within the protease and pdz domains . to address the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we transfected an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene into tobacco leaves by particle bombardment . using confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis with a coxiv _METHOD_ transgene as a mitochondrial marker we found that _PROTEIN_ like its human counterpart localizes to mitochondria . to gain insight into the _PROTEIN_ dynamics of _PROTEIN_ we performed several _PROTEIN_ analyses . spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by semiquantitative rt pcr in different plant tissues . we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were significantly higher in aerial parts of the plant including flowers _METHOD_ and leaves as compared with roots . to further analyze possible stress induced regulation of _PROTEIN_ we performed semiquantitative rt pcr on wt plants exposed to elevated temperatures . from this analysis we found that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are significantly up regulated when plants are shifted from to for h . to test whether _PROTEIN_ levels were induced by other stress conditions we exposed week old wt plants to and methyl viologen/paraquat . no increase in _PROTEIN_ levels above baseline was observed in response to these stress treatments . additionally combining and heat stress had no additive effect on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also analyzed showing a rapid fold increase in transcript levels after exposure to for only h . interestingly after h at _PROTEIN_ transcript levels _PROTEIN_ to fold above baseline levels with a further reduction after h at . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were not affected by exposure to . _PROTEIN_ knock out mice show a parkinsonian phenotype whereas overexpression confers neuroprotection . we initially attempted to characterize two _PROTEIN_ t dna mutant lines however no homozygous lines could be recovered . we then generated gain of function _PROTEIN_ lines using the promoter and the estradiol xve inducible promoter _PROTEIN_ . two independent lines from each construct were selected showing high levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate potential protective roles of _PROTEIN_ two _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines were subjected to heat stress and compared with transgenic lines containing the empty vector and wt plants . we initially tested the effect on survival in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants in response to exposure for days . after and days at transgenic plants containing the empty vector showed clear bleaching whereas transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed thermotolerance . we then analyzed the phenotypes of the same transgenic plants in response to . after h of exposure to wt plants exhibited bleaching and cell death as compared with plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . further after and h of exposure to wt plants were completely bleached whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants showed clear cell survival . because the transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines selected exhibited higher _PROTEIN_ levels compared with the transgenic lines analyzed we tested whether the observed thermotolerance was dependent on _PROTEIN_ levels . as for the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants we observed clear thermotolerance in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines as compared with empty vector _PROTEIN_ plants . moreover the degree of thermotolerance appeared higher in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants compared with the plants suggesting a possible dose dependent effect . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ enzymatic activity we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified the protein under denaturing conditions using affinity chromatography . following refolding by stepwise dialysis protease activity assays using casein as a generic substrate demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is indeed a protease when compared with fractions purified from e. coli _PROTEIN_ alone . previous studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ activity increases with increasing temperature however _PROTEIN_ showed no significant increase in activity at as compared with . because proteases often recognize unfolded/misfolded proteins we then addressed whether denatured casein represented a better _PROTEIN_ substrate as compared with native casein . we found a significant increase in protease activity toward denatured casein as compared with non denatured casein substrate . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ preferentially acts on misfolded/unassembled proteins . we also analyzed the vmax and km in response to misfolded casein was obtained as and respectively . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ protease could degrade known pd associated proteins we exposed purified native snca to purified _PROTEIN_ . we found that _PROTEIN_ could degrade native snca as observed for casein . we further observed that misfolded snca represents a better target for _PROTEIN_ showing a fold reduction in snca levels . because human _PROTEIN_ is synthesized as a precursor that becomes processed into a mature _LOCATION_ form _LOCATION_ in response to apoptotic stimuli we tested whether a mature form of _PROTEIN_ showed altered protease activity . to this end we _PROTEIN_ and purified a truncated mature mimicked version of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ under denaturing conditions and the mature form of under non denaturing conditions . following refolding by stepwise dialysis casein degradation assays showed no significant difference in activity as compared with full length _PROTEIN_ . as expected was able to degrade casein . we then analyzed whether could degrade snca . we observed a fold reduction in both folded and unfolded snca in response to similar to the observations with _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ protein used for this study was purified from the insoluble fraction followed by refolding we sought to verify our findings using _PROTEIN_ purified from the soluble fraction in its native state . soluble _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and purified under native conditions in e. coli alongside an empty vector control showing a molecular weight reminiscent of the processed mature form . we next tested whether this mature form of _PROTEIN_ could act on casein as a generic substrate . we found as for full length _PROTEIN_ that native processed showed clear protease activity against non denatured and denatured casein . we also tested whether the native could act on snca and as with full length _PROTEIN_ we observed a clear reduction in snca . we also sought to analyze whether dj could act as a substrate for _PROTEIN_ . to this end we exposed purified wt dj to purified . from this analysis we found that dj levels were reduced by when incubated with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that dj is an _PROTEIN_ substrate in vitro . as with snca denatured dj appears to be a better substrate for . to further analyze this finding we also exposed the dj mutated variant to _PROTEIN_ . the dj mutation is presumed to render dj less stable by conformationally altering the three dimensional structure of the protein . from this analysis we observed a similar reduction in dj as for wt dj . interestingly denatured dj did not appear to act as a better substrate for . because the mature form of was able to degrade snca we also tested whether could also act on wt dj and dj . from these experiments we found that could act on both wt dj and on the dj variant but with no significant difference between the native and the denatured _METHOD_ . comparative two dimensional _PROTEIN_ was performed on extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the vectors and _PROTEIN_ alone and on plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at and . three biological replicates were used and proteins showing differential abundance were identified . the three biological replicas comprised extracts from transgenic plants containing the and the _PROTEIN_ vectors . from this analysis we identified four proteins that showed differential abundance that were then identified by maldi linear ion trap peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the number of unique peptides and percentage coverage for the four proteins are shown in table and in supplemental fig . . three proteins showed _PROTEIN_ abundance in response to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas one protein showed increased abundance . peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase was identified as a moderately down regulated protein in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . _PROTEIN_ overexpression also resulted in down regulation of photosystem ii subunit p and germin like protein . in response to _PROTEIN_ accumulation we identified glutathione transferase as being up regulated .
