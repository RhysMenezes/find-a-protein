plants can sense the direction of gravity and change the growth orientation of their organs . to elucidate the molecular _METHOD_ of gravity perception and the signal transduction of gravitropism we have characterized a number of shoot gravitropism mutants of arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows reduced gravitropism in the inflorescence stem but its root and hypocotyl have normal gravitropism . _PROTEIN_ encodes a zinc finger protein with a coiled coil motif . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis protoplasts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may act as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis the gravity sensing tissue in inflorescence _METHOD_ . furthermore the observation that endodermis specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant restores shoot gravitropism indicates that it could function in the gravity sensing endodermal cell layer . in contrast to other sgr mutants reported previously almost all amyloplasts in the endodermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant sedimented in the direction of gravity . taken together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in an early event in shoot gravitropism such as gravity perception and/or a signaling process subsequent to amyloplast sedimentation as a putative transcription _PROTEIN_ in gravity perceptive cells .
when wild type arabidopsis inflorescence _METHOD_ were gravi stimulated by horizontal placement primary shoots bent upwards and became vertical in approximately min at in the dark . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited weak gravitropic responses and the curvature did not reach even after h . the _PROTEIN_ allele derived from the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype also showed reduced shoot gravitropism compared with wild type l _LOCATION_ . hypocotyls and roots of _PROTEIN_ exhibited a normal gravitropic response . in addition both inflorescence _METHOD_ and hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ showed a positive phototropic response suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is capable of asymmetric growth as reported previously . wild type primary inflorescence _METHOD_ grow upright and their _PROTEIN_ shoots grow upwards although not upright . _PROTEIN_ shoots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant tended to grow in a horizontal direction similar to other sgr mutants . growth arrest at the primary shoot apex was observed at low frequency during production of flowers . the elongation rate of inflorescence _METHOD_ is however comparable to that of wild type at the earlier growth stage when the gravitropic response is examined as reported previously . thus the gravitropic response of _PROTEIN_ is unlikely to be influenced by the rare growth arrest observed . other obvious morphological phenotypes were not observed in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene was cloned based on its map position . the _PROTEIN_ locus mapped at the top region of chromosome . by analyzing approximately independent lines the locus was narrowed to a kb interval in the bacterial artificial chromosome clones and containing three predicted orfs . all three orfs in _PROTEIN_ genomic dna were sequenced and a single g to a substitution was found in one orf _GENE_ leading to the single amino acid substitution asp to asn at position . plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles which are t dna insertion mutations were tested by rt pcr to determine potential _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in both alleles a slight amount of transcript could be detected using primer sets that amplify the region downstream of the t dna insertion . the transcript from _PROTEIN_ was sequenced and deduced not to encode an in frame fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ at least is probably a null mutant . the kb wild type genomic fragment containing the _GENE_ orf and predicted promoter region was cloned and introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants for a complementation test . inflorescence _METHOD_ of the transgenic plants exhibited gravitropism with similar kinetics as the wild type and their _PROTEIN_ shoots grew upwards . taken together these results lead us to conclude that _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene . _GENE_ was annotated in the arabidopsis information resource as a _PROTEIN_ type zinc finger family protein similar to the putative zinc finger protein _PROTEIN_ . sixteen arabidopsis genes including _PROTEIN_ show sequence similarity with maize in their zinc finger domains . in addition to the predicted four zinc finger motifs these genes have a conserved sequence at the n terminal region containing an r/k rich stretch that could be a _LOCATION_ localization signal . three genes _PROTEIN_ show high similarity to one another and are less similar to than the other genes are . also the three genes contain a highly conserved domain in addition to the zinc finger domain at their c terminal region . thus the three genes probably comprise a small sub family . an amino acid substitution was found at the highly conserved amino acid in the third zinc finger in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the third zinc finger is important for the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ and probably for that of other family members . we tested whether the sub family members including _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ using semi quantitative rt pcr analysis . all three genes were detected in almost all organs examined with significant organ specificity for levels of _PROTEIN_ . for example the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were most abundant in the stem and the flower while those of other two genes were most abundant in the flower . the results suggest that each sub family member may have specific function . as the _PROTEIN_ protein was predicted to have a _LOCATION_ localization signal we sought more direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . a _METHOD_ gene was fused at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ cdna and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in arabidopsis protoplasts . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ while that of _METHOD_ alone was observed both in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ under the control of an authentic promoter in arabidopsis the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized in one large organelle in each cell of the inflorescence stem endodermis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ restored the gravitropic response to _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein retains the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . based on rt pcr analysis results the _PROTEIN_ gene appeared to be _PROTEIN_ throughout the whole plant . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we constructed an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter gene and introduced it into wild type plants . the gus _PROTEIN_ pattern regulated by the _PROTEIN_ promoter is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of authentic mrna detected by rt pcr . gus activity was detected in seedlings hypocotyls roots floral organs and _METHOD_ . strong gus activity was detected at the shoot apical meristem but not at the root apical meristem . gus activity appeared to gradually _PROTEIN_ with ageing in both the shoot and root vasculature . it is noteworthy that the most striking _PROTEIN_ was observed in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem although a weak gus signal was also found in the vasculature . consistently _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was observed within the _LOCATION_ of endodermal cells as described above . in addition the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts significantly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants lacking a normal endodermis . the endodermis is the gravity perceptive tissue of arabidopsis inflorescence _METHOD_ . to test whether endodermal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for a gravitropic response _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the endodermis specific scarecrow _PROTEIN_ gene promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . transgenic plants showed almost a normal gravitropic response suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in an early process in gravitropism that takes place in the gravi perceptive cells . amyloplasts within the endodermal cells sedimented in the direction of gravity in wild type plants . the movement of amyloplasts towards a gravitational force is thought to trigger the gravitropic response . in some sgr mutants amyloplasts are dispersed within the cell and do not sediment in the direction of gravity . although one or two amyloplasts were occasionally found in the middle part of the cell in _PROTEIN_ almost all amyloplasts sedimented in the direction of gravity in endodermal cells of _PROTEIN_ . the result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a novel type of gene involved in a process after amyloplast sedimentation but that takes place in the gravi perceptive cells .
