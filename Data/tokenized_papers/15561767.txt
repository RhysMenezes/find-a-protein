rab _PROTEIN_ are universal key regulators of intracellular secretory trafficking events . in particular rab homologues have been implicated in endocytic events and in the _LOCATION_ pathway . in this study we investigate the location and function of a member of this family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells using a live cell imaging approach . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ localized to the prevacuolar compartment and _LOCATION_ apparatus as determined by coexpression studies with _METHOD_ markers for these compartments . mutations that impair _PROTEIN_ function also alter the subcellular location of the _PROTEIN_ . in addition coexpression studies of the protein with the _LOCATION_ targeted aleurain green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and rescue experiments with wild type _PROTEIN_ indicate that the dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ causes the _LOCATION_ marker to be secreted to the apoplast . our results indicate a clear role of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway .
as important regulators in _LOCATION_ traffic many rab proteins are known to cycle on and off specific _LOCATION_ in a nucleotide dependent manner . to investigate the location of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ or yellow _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein was fused to the n terminus of the rab . to investigate the nucleotide dependency of _PROTEIN_ mutations were introduced in functionally important regions responsible for _PROTEIN_ binding and hydrolysis activities . the resulting mutants were analysed for altered location and function . two to three days after agrobacterium mediated transformation the fusion protein was analysed in vivo in tobacco leaf epidermal cells by confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in punctate mobile organelles less than in diameter and also in the _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled spherical structures and a _LOCATION_ close to the periphery of the cell . to determine the nature of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ positive punctate structures which resemble the pattern described for the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled two populations of structure one that colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and one that did not . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ protein is resident on the _LOCATION_ and at least one other organelle . tagged _PROTEIN_ was created by substituting for asparagine within the conserved motif . this protein is predicted to have a higher affinity to gdp resulting in an inactive form of the protein . when _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled punctate structures and the _LOCATION_ . the punctate structures observed completely colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . tagged _PROTEIN_ was created by changing to leucine . this mutation within the conserved motif is predicted to have lower intrinsic _PROTEIN_ activity therefore promoting the _PROTEIN_ bound state . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled larger spherical structures and a _LOCATION_ close to the boundaries of the cell . the spherical structures did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulate within the spheres . when the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was coexpressed with _METHOD_ previously shown to label the tonoplast the fusion proteins colocalized on the same _LOCATION_ . when _METHOD_ was infiltrated alone into tobacco leaf epidermal cells as _PROTEIN_ level increased spheres similar to those shown in fig . green channel were observed . these structures were not apparent in tobacco protoplasts and suspension cells singly _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ construct . additionally the number of spheres normally observed in cells _PROTEIN_ the tagged _PROTEIN_ alone compared to when coexpressed with _METHOD_ appeared to increase . the absence of labelling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by the _METHOD_ mutant was verified upon coexpression with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as tagged _PROTEIN_ did not localize with the _METHOD_ aquaporin . a nucleotide free form of _PROTEIN_ was created by mutations within the conserved guanine base binding motif _PROTEIN_ changing to isoleucine . this mutation reduces the affinity of the protein to both gdp and _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was entirely _LOCATION_ . cysteine motif isoprenylation on the variable c terminus is essential for specific attachment of rab _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ and for their recognition by rab gdp dissociation inhibitor _PROTEIN_ . to eliminate the isoprenylation site at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ the cysteine residues at positions and were mutated to serines . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was entirely _LOCATION_ . these results are consistent with the lack of insertion into _LOCATION_ because of the absence of a functional isoprenylation motif . nucleotide free rab mutants have been shown to be unstable . to investigate the stability of the mutated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and to determine whether the _LOCATION_ labelling pattern of the _PROTEIN_ fusion resulted from loss of its _PROTEIN_ moiety immunoblot analysis of extracts from transformed leaves was performed . equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane and the amount of epitope recognized by the anti _METHOD_ antibody in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not appear to be significantly lower than the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein and other mutants . degradation products were not observed for the wild type protein or any of the mutants confirming that the fusion proteins were stable . the prevacuole marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used as a control protein to ensure specific binding of the antibody . the anti _METHOD_ antibody did not recognize epitopes within the untransformed negative control sample . to investigate the location of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctate structures that are not distributed to the _LOCATION_ apparatus coexpression studies were performed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a fusion created from pea _PROTEIN_ . specifically _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is the fusion protein between _METHOD_ and the transmembrane and _LOCATION_ domains of _PROTEIN_ the pea _LOCATION_ sorting receptor that localizes to the pvc and the trans _LOCATION_ network . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ alone it localized to punctate structures that were _PROTEIN_ distinct from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ representing the pvc . in another study using a very similar marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which was distinct from the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase colocalized with vsr antibodies . additionally _METHOD_ experiments on root tip cells stably _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is located in organelles containing _PROTEIN_ homologues and that these rarely colocalize with the _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether the population of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that did not distribute to the _LOCATION_ apparatus colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we coexpressed the two proteins and found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein is indeed located at the pvc . in addition when these two fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ together aggregates containing both proteins were formed . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ spheres normally observed in tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells disappeared and were replaced with large _METHOD_ structures . by contrast when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with either the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was normally distributed . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized with a subpopulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . there was however always some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that did not colocalize with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which may represent the pvc . this indicates that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not prevent all the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from reaching this compartment . to rule out the possibility that the _METHOD_ tag attached to the _PROTEIN_ protein interfered with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ this experiment was repeated using the untagged versions of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ aggregates were also observed in coexpression experiments of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the untagged _PROTEIN_ . these aggregates are similar to those seen when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ with untagged _PROTEIN_ . interestingly in cells that formed aggregates when coexpressed with the untagged constructs the aggregates appeared more spherical and mobile than those observed when _PROTEIN_ with the tagged version . cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and untagged _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not form these large accumulations . the localization of _PROTEIN_ protein to the pvc determined by coexpression with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway . as tagged _PROTEIN_ and tagged _PROTEIN_ disrupt the normal distribution of the _LOCATION_ bound pvc marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we asked whether _PROTEIN_ and its mutant _METHOD_ also affect soluble proteins that localize to the pvc . aleurain _METHOD_ has a sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting determinant from petunia aleurain and is transported to the lytic _LOCATION_ . when aleu _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells it was only faintly detectable in the _LOCATION_ . this is consistent with the known instability of _METHOD_ in tobacco leaf _LOCATION_ . in addition to faint _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ aleu _METHOD_ also labelled punctate mobile structures . upon coexpression of aleu _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we verified that these punctate structures colocalized with the pvc marker . this _METHOD_ that aleu _METHOD_ is targeted to the lytic _LOCATION_ via the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled pvc . we therefore used this protein as a marker to analyse the effect of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimaeras on _LOCATION_ trafficking . to investigate the location and function of _PROTEIN_ and mutants in the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway the proteins were coexpressed with _METHOD_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with aleu _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled structures colocalized with the aleu _METHOD_ positive pvcs . faint _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ structures can occasionally be observed . the size and distribution of the pvc compartments labelled by aleu _METHOD_ was not affected by the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein unlike the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled pvc . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with aleu _METHOD_ the bright punctate aleurain containing pvcs did not colocalize with the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with aleu _METHOD_ revealed that many of the spherical compartments labelled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated the soluble marker aleu _METHOD_ suggesting that these represent aberrant pvc . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with aleu _METHOD_ the aleu _METHOD_ punctate structures were not affected . to investigate the effect of untagged mutant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ on the destination of aleu _METHOD_ images of transformed epidermal cells were taken at low magnification . when _PROTEIN_ alone aleu _METHOD_ appeared faintly in the _LOCATION_ . when untagged _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ with aleu _METHOD_ there was only a slight alteration in the distribution of the aleu _METHOD_ . many cells still showed faint _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ with some cells exhibiting _METHOD_ in the apoplast presumably because of saturation of the _LOCATION_ sorting mechanism . however the targeting of the aleu _METHOD_ was drastically influenced by the _PROTEIN_ of untagged _PROTEIN_ . rather than a weak _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ aleu _METHOD_ was secreted resulting in clearly visible _METHOD_ in the apoplastic space . to exclude the possibility that increased apoplastic _METHOD_ resulted from alterations of the apoplastic environment a secretory form of _METHOD_ was coexpressed with untagged _PROTEIN_ and mutants but no increase in apoplastic _METHOD_ was observed . importantly the aleu _METHOD_ secretion phenotype induced by _PROTEIN_ was reversed by the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ protein along with _PROTEIN_ and aleu _METHOD_ . this effect appeared to be specific to the _PROTEIN_ subclass as no rescue was observed when a member of a different subclass the related _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and aleu _METHOD_ . to quantify these results we counted the number of cells in which at least half the apoplast was visibly decorated with aleu _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . data was collected from three independent experiments and cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the apoplast in eight fields of view per construct were counted . _PROTEIN_ indicated that the number of cells with aleu _METHOD_ visible in the apoplast when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ was significantly different to the number obtained with aleu _METHOD_ alone aleu _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and when the dominant negative effect was rescued by coexpression with the _PROTEIN_ protein . fig . also indicates that the rescue of the dominant negative phenotype by coexpression with wild type protein was effective . efficient rescue of the dominant negative phenotype by _PROTEIN_ suggests that secretion of aleu _METHOD_ to the apoplast results from loss of _PROTEIN_ function in these cells . to investigate the effect of the _METHOD_ tag on the function of the _PROTEIN_ low magnification images were taken of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coexpressed with aleu _METHOD_ . the addition of the _METHOD_ protein to _PROTEIN_ caused increased secretion of aleu _METHOD_ to the apoplast compared to the untagged version . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not appear to cause as much secretion as the untagged version . interestingly when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which lacks a functional isoprenylation motif was _PROTEIN_ with aleu _METHOD_ it did not affect the transport of the aleu _METHOD_ indicating that _LOCATION_ association or association with an interactor such as rabgdi is essential for tagged _PROTEIN_ to alter trafficking of aleu _METHOD_ .
standard molecular techniques were used as described . the cdna of wild type _PROTEIN_ was amplified using primers _PROTEIN_ and ccggccgagctcctaagcacaacacgatgaactcac adding bamhi and saci restriction sites respectively . the resulting pcr product was cloned into with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . mutations in functionally important regions of _PROTEIN_ were created using site directed mutagenesis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was generated from _PROTEIN_ with primers _PROTEIN_ and and ccgtaacacaagactgttttttccagcaccaac . _PROTEIN_ was generated with the following primers using _PROTEIN_ as a template _PROTEIN_ and and caaactatggtaccgttcgagacctgcagtatcccaaatctcaaacttcac . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was introduced into _PROTEIN_ using ggtaaccctaatatggtcatggcgctagctggaatcaaatctgatttattagatg and and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was created from _PROTEIN_ using the primers and ccggccgagctcctaagcagaagacgatgaactcactgccctatc . untagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and mutants were generated by pcr from the _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ inserting xbai at the region using caggacctctagatggctgcagctggaaacaagagc . the resulting pcr product was subcloned into lacking the _METHOD_ tag . nicotiana tabacum plants were grown in a greenhouse at with natural day length illumination . for experimental use plants were transferred to a plant growth chamber at with a hour light and hour dark regime . each construct was mobilized in agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by freeze thawing followed by selection on yeb plates containing the appropriate antibiotics . agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells was conducted as previously described . for _PROTEIN_ of each construct alone or in combination the level of inoculum was adjusted as specified for each experiment . the secreted _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ targeted markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have been previously described . aleurain _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were constructed as described . to label the prevacuolar compartment _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was fused to the transmembrane and _LOCATION_ sequence of pea _PROTEIN_ . the construct called _PROTEIN_ is identical to _PROTEIN_ described except that all of the _LOCATION_ amino acids are present . _PROTEIN_ contains the coding sequence of _METHOD_ which has two mutations and followed by the coding sequence of the transmembrane domain of the and the first five amino acids of the _LOCATION_ region of . in _PROTEIN_ the pea _PROTEIN_ nucleotide sequence is flanked by a sali site at the end and by a saci site at the end . a new fragment was made by polymerase chain reaction of sequence to generate a sali site at amino acids and and a saci site at the original stop codon position . the sali saci fragment was confirmed by sequencing and inserted into _PROTEIN_ in place of the truncated version . for the _METHOD_ version of _PROTEIN_ a sali site was added at the end of the _METHOD_ coding sequence at the same position as _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ sequence from _PROTEIN_ was replaced by the _METHOD_ . finally both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ versions of _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into the binary vector into the restriction sites xbai and saci . unless otherwise stated infected cells of the lower epidermis of transformed leaves were analysed hours after inoculation . confocal imaging was performed using an upright or inverted zeiss lsm laser scanning microscope with a n.a . oil immersion lens . for multi track imaging _METHOD_ was excited with a nm wavelength of an argon line the emission was collected using a nm band pass filter and _METHOD_ was excited with a nm wavelength of an argon line the emission was collected using a nm band pass filter . _METHOD_ quantification was done from low magnification bits images using lsm software . post acquisition processing of images was done using the zeiss lsm software and adobe photoshop software . proteins were extracted from tobacco leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ fusions and gel electrophoresis and blotting was carried out as described . the blot was probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against _METHOD_ followed by an alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody . the results were determined with the bcip/nbt colour development substrate according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
