clade a protein phosphatases type _PROTEIN_ are negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling that are inhibited in an aba dependent manner by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ /regulatory _PROTEIN_ of aba receptors _PROTEIN_ intracellular receptors . we provide genetic evidence that a previously uncharacterized member of this _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis _GENE_ is a negative regulator of osmotic stress and aba signaling and that this function was only apparent when double loss of function mutants with _PROTEIN_ were generated . _GENE_ green _METHOD_ protein and its close relative _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein showed a predominant _LOCATION_ localization however hemagglutinin tagged versions were also localized to _LOCATION_ and microsomal pellets . _GENE_ was selectively inhibited by some _PROTEIN_ aba receptors and close relatives of this _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ hypersensitive _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a contrasting sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ inhibition . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was resistant to inhibition by the _PROTEIN_ receptors tested which suggests that this seed specific phosphatase is still able to regulate aba signaling in the presence of aba and _PROTEIN_ receptors and therefore to control the highly active aba signaling pathway that operates during seed development . moreover the differential sensitivity of the phosphatases _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ to inhibition by aba receptors reveals a functional specialization of _PROTEIN_ aba receptors to preferentially inhibit certain _PROTEIN_ .
_GENE_ is not _PROTEIN_ in seeds but it is _PROTEIN_ in seedlings or different tissues of adult plants according to public microarray data . basal transcript levels of _GENE_ are lower than those reported for other clade a _PROTEIN_ however its _PROTEIN_ is highly induced by aba or osmotic stress and this induction was dramatically impaired in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . in order to investigate the relative contribution of _GENE_ to aba signaling we analyzed the aba response of the _GENE_ loss of function mutant which we have named _PROTEIN_ . aba mediated inhibition of seedling establishment was similar in the single _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type and a double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show an enhanced response to aba compared with _PROTEIN_ even at low aba concentrations . however a double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was more sensitive to glc or mannitol mediated inhibition of seedling establishment than single parental mutants . we also generated arabidopsis transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ hemagglutinin tagged versions of the _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter . with respect to _PROTEIN_ we confirmed previous results obtained by citation which showed that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ leads to an aba insensitive phenotype . likewise _GENE_ lines showed diminished sensitivity to aba mediated inhibition of seedling establishment and root growth enhanced water loss and diminished _PROTEIN_ of aba inducible genes compared with the wild type . conversely a characteristic feature of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was an enhanced sensitivity to aba mediated inhibition of growth compared with single mutants which suggests that _GENE_ attenuates aba signaling in vegetative tissue . therefore the very moderate aba hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ in root assays described by citation is likely explained by partial redundancy with _GENE_ or other _PROTEIN_ . we also analyzed the transcriptional regulation of aba responsive genes in the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type and single parental mutants . aba mediated induction of the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was more than twofold higher in the double mutant compared with the other genetic backgrounds . _PROTEIN_ of these genes in the single parental mutants showed a less than twofold difference with respect to the wild type . finally by measuring the loss of fresh weight of detached leaves we could observe a reduced water loss of the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type and single parental mutants . while the catalytic core of _GENE_ is closely related to _PROTEIN_ the n terminal sequence shows a clear divergence . several clusters rich in arg residues are present at the n terminal sequence of _GENE_ . different _METHOD_ for the prediction of subcellular localization reveal the presence of _LOCATION_ targeting signals in this region indeed two _LOCATION_ localization patterns are present both the pattern of four basic residues and the bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signal . instead _PROTEIN_ only displays the pattern of four basic residues which is localized at the c terminus of the protein . in experiments where _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells both _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ appeared to be predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ although some _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was also observed . deletion of the n terminal region of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ led to a subcellular localization of the catalytic phosphatase core similar to _METHOD_ whereas the fusion of residues to of _GENE_ to _METHOD_ rendered a _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ protein . proper elucidation of the subcellular localization of clade a _PROTEIN_ is an important goal to better understand their role in plant physiology however biochemical fractionation studies have only been reported for _PROTEIN_ . since interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has been reported and interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ with was localized to both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ we further investigated the subcellular localization of both _PROTEIN_ by fractionation studies . to this end we used the arabidopsis transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ ha tagged versions of the _PROTEIN_ . both ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _GENE_ proteins appeared to be functional with respect to aba signaling since their constitutive _PROTEIN_ led to reduced sensitivity to aba . both proteins showed _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization and interestingly part of the protein pool was localized to either the microsomal or _LOCATION_ insoluble fraction . a relative quantification of the subcellular distribution of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _GENE_ indicated that most of the protein was localized at the _LOCATION_ although these data also confirmed that a significant fraction of the protein and for ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _GENE_ respectively was localized in the _LOCATION_ . the apparently predominant _LOCATION_ localization of transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ might be explained because the lower volume of the _LOCATION_ compared with the _LOCATION_ leads to a higher concentration of _METHOD_ fusion proteins enhancing the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal . since both _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate different aspects of aba signaling we analyzed its possible regulation by _PROTEIN_ aba receptors . coexpression of these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in seedlings roots or guard cells could be documented in public microarray databases . thus we analyzed the phosphatase activity of _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ in the presence of seven _PROTEIN_ receptors which represent the dimeric class _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the monomeric class _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using a ratio of receptor _PROTEIN_ between and of aba independent inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by some monomeric receptors was recently reported . however in our hands using either a ratio in phosphopeptide based activity assays or a ratio in _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylation assays we did not detect such aba independent inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ receptors tested . in the best case only a to aba independent inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was found . in the presence of aba _PROTEIN_ was inhibited by all the receptors although important differences could be observed depending on the receptor considered . for instance _PROTEIN_ inhibition by _PROTEIN_ was much more effective than by _PROTEIN_ whereas values for the other receptors ranged between and aba . such differences were not noted previously but it is likely that they were masked by the high concentration of receptor with respect to the _PROTEIN_ used by citation . _GENE_ was relatively resistant to inhibition by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and for dimeric receptors such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was approximately aba whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ where the most effective inhibitors . indeed both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were the most effective inhibitors of _PROTEIN_ as well . structural and genetic studies have shown the importance for the locking mechanism of the ternary receptor aba _PROTEIN_ complex of a conserved trp residue of clade a _PROTEIN_ which establishes a water mediated hydrogen bond with the ketone group of aba in ternary complexes . interestingly _PROTEIN_ is the only clade a _PROTEIN_ that lacks this conserved trp . therefore we wondered whether this seed specific _PROTEIN_ would be subjected to _PROTEIN_ regulation . as can be observed in figure _PROTEIN_ phosphatase activity was not significantly affected by _PROTEIN_ receptors even at aba . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ could negatively regulate aba signaling even in the presence of high levels of aba and _PROTEIN_ receptors . to gain additional evidence for the biochemical regulation of the above described _PROTEIN_ we also performed in vitro reconstitution of the aba signaling cascade and tested the protection of _PROTEIN_ activity by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the presence of the different _PROTEIN_ and aba . both _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ efficiently dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ was less effective . coincubation of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of aba either with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or of _GENE_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ notably protected _PROTEIN_ activity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only modestly recovered _PROTEIN_ activity when coincubated with _GENE_ in the presence of aba . in agreement with the phosphatase assays described in figure coincubation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ receptors did not prevent _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylation . finally we used _PROTEIN_ as a substrate of _PROTEIN_ and after generation of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ we incubated it with _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ . both _PROTEIN_ efficiently dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ whereas coincubation with _PROTEIN_ in the presence of aba abolished their activity against the transcription _PROTEIN_ . taking into account that a significant portion of _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ these results suggest that abfs might also be substrates of these _PROTEIN_ .
