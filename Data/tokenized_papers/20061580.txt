recent advances in the proteomics field have allowed a series of high throughput experiments to be conducted on chloroplast samples and the data are available in several public databases . however the accurate localization of many chloroplast proteins often remains hypothetical . this is especially true for envelope proteins . we went a step further into the knowledge of the chloroplast proteome by focusing in the same set of experiments on the localization of proteins in the stroma the _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ . lc _METHOD_ based analyses first allowed building the _PROTEIN_ database a comprehensive repertoire of the proteins identified by unique peptide sequences present in highly purified chloroplasts and their subfractions prepared from arabidopsis thaliana leaves . this database also provides extensive proteomics information _METHOD_ for a unique chloroplast protein accurate _METHOD_ and time tag database gathering identified peptides with their respective and precise analytical coordinates molecular weight and retention time . we assessed the partitioning of each protein in the three chloroplast compartments by using a semiquantitative proteomics approach . these data together with an in depth investigation of the literature were compiled to provide accurate subplastidial localization of previously known and newly identified proteins . a unique knowledge base containing extensive information on the proteins identified in envelope fractions was thus obtained allowing new insights into this _LOCATION_ system to be revealed . altogether the data we obtained provide unexpected information about _LOCATION_ or subplastidial localization of some proteins that were not suspected to be associated to this _LOCATION_ system . the spectral counting based strategy was further validated as the compartmentation of well known pathways within chloroplasts could be dissected . it also allowed revisiting the compartmentation of the chloroplast metabolism and functions .
chloroplasts from a. thaliana leaves were purified on percoll density gradients . the _LOCATION_ subfractions _LOCATION_ were purified on a sucrose gradient as described previously . as each compartment represents complex fractions with respect to protein content and dynamic range the three purified subfractions were fractionated by different procedures . with the objective to obtain the most comprehensive chloroplast protein database fractionation was set up so that proteins from different subplastidial compartments and present in different copy numbers could be identified . the whole envelope stroma or _LOCATION_ samples were first separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or directly digested in solution before analyses . rubisco represents about of the stroma protein content making very difficult the analysis of minor proteins . to partially remove this protein from stroma fractions we precipitated proteins using different concentrations of ammonium sulfate . rubisco was essentially recovered in the supernatant obtained by precipitation with ammonium sulfate whereas the corresponding pellet was partially devoid of rubisco . a total of different samples derived from the stroma were obtained each of them was analyzed at least twice leading to lc _METHOD_ analyses . _LOCATION_ proteins were also separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or directly digested in solution . the purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were also treated using alkaline extraction or organic solvent extractions using previously described protocols . these different washing and extraction procedures allowed _LOCATION_ proteins with a wide range of hydrophobic properties to be recovered . altogether different samples were obtained from _LOCATION_ leading to lc _METHOD_ analyses . the purified envelope fractions were also separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or directly digested in solution before analyses . ltq _PROTEIN_ data were obtained from envelope _LOCATION_ preparations that were not pretreated thus increasing the risk of detecting more soluble contaminants from the stroma but potentially allowing identification of genuine peripheral proteins that interact with the inner side of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ or with the _LOCATION_ outer surface . fifty nine lc _METHOD_ analyses were performed on corresponding envelope samples . q tof data were also obtained from naoh treated envelope _LOCATION_ to enrich the preparations with hydrophobic proteins . still with the same aim we performed analyses on envelope _LOCATION_ extracted from the mutant . the protein is a component of the inner chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . its function remains to be identified . interestingly this protein was one of the few envelope proteins to be under represented in leaves and roots of arabidopsis when plants were grown in a medium containing a limiting phosphate concentration . analyzing this arabidopsis mutant in the laboratory we observed a reproducible under representation of a major protein _PROTEIN_ in envelope fractions extracted from this mutant . we had the idea that lowering the level of a major component of the envelope fraction may give access to minor proteins present in the analyzed fraction and thus we chose to also analyze envelope fractions from this mutant . altogether lc _METHOD_ analyses were performed on envelope samples extracted from both plants . finally a whole chloroplast fraction was also analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus a total of samples were obtained from separating and stacking gels and from in solution digestions . because each of these samples was analyzed at least twice lc _METHOD_ analyses were thus performed from which database searching results were stored in the _PROTEIN_ database . from all these analyses non redundant proteins could be identified . as our objective was to get precise data about subplastidial localization of the identified proteins great caution was taken to assess purity of the arabidopsis chloroplast subfractions . cross contamination was checked using specific antibodies . western blot data indicated a low level of cross contamination . these data demonstrate that _LOCATION_ fractions contained less than stromal proteins and about envelope proteins . stroma fractions contained less than envelope and _LOCATION_ proteins . envelope _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis chloroplasts were somewhat less pure as they contained about and proteins derived from the _LOCATION_ or the stroma respectively . however as stroma and _LOCATION_ were highly purified it was straightforward to discriminate whether a protein is actually a stroma a _LOCATION_ or an envelope component or presents dual localization . furthermore proteomics investigations also provided further evidence for protein distribution among chloroplast compartments . to estimate the depth of the present proteomics analysis we used a combination of recombinant proteins and antibodies to quantify three independent envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ ceqorh and . as presented in supplemental data we were able to identify proteins representing less than of the chloroplast envelope proteins . when considering the enrichment obtained with chloroplast envelope purification such minor proteins represent of the chloroplast proteins . it is thus expected that some of the minor proteins that we identified here would not have been identified in a proteomics study performed from crude chloroplasts or crude chloroplast _LOCATION_ . this was actually the case because many envelope proteins we detected here were far below the detection level when starting from crude chloroplast . as indicated above all gel fractions and in solution digests were analyzed at last twice using an _PROTEIN_ icr instrument . several criteria were applied to filter the mascot database searching results . first automatic filtering parameters were applied based on the mascot p values for both proteins and peptides . results obtained from this automatic filtering process were stored in an identification database . to refine the results an additional validation step was performed from results stored in the identification database . while manually inspecting _METHOD_ spectra we noticed that some of the spectra correlated by mascot to peptides bearing less than amino acids were not sufficiently informative to guarantee protein identification . moreover some peptide sequences of less than amino acids were shown to match both a reverse and a forward protein . this suggested that _METHOD_ spectra correlated to small peptides are more prone to random identification than longer peptides . thus we decided to use the length of identified peptides as an additional validation criterion . when rejecting peptides with less than amino acids about of reverse peptides were rejected whereas most of the forward peptides were kept . eventually peptides satisfying two criteria mascot p values < and peptide length amino acids were kept . this filtering step allowed us to identify proteins with an _PROTEIN_ of at the peptide level . then a protein grouping procedure ensuring the clustering of proteins sharing a subset or a same set of peptides was applied . in most cases protein groups are characterized by at least one peptide sequence named unique peptide that can not be found in another protein group . however six protein groups do not have any unique peptide but can not be classified in another protein group as they share peptides with different protein groups . from the so generated protein groups protein groups identified by at least two peptides were automatically validated . for proteins identified by a single peptide sequence we set a mascot score threshold above which no reverse protein could be identified . considering our data set this threshold was fixed to . overall the _PROTEIN_ for proteins was below . the final results were stored in the _PROTEIN_ database . early _METHOD_ studies indicated that the total number of peptide hits for a specific protein semiquantitatively reflects its abundance in the analyzed protein mixture . these results have been corroborated by many reports to date and it is commonly accepted that semiquantitative information can be extracted from spectral count data . in the present study as we used extensive prefractionation to access the most exhaustive chloroplast proteome we generated a tremendous amount of _METHOD_ data which could be associated to each subchloroplastic compartment . on the basis that a protein should exhibit higher spectral count in analyses of its original subcompartment we decided to use spectral count data to determine protein subchloroplastic localization . to assess the relevance of spectral counts for predicting protein localization we first elaborated a statistical model . for this purpose we selected the subset of analyses corresponding to one dimensional gel separations of the three subchloroplastic fractions without any prior treatments . in selecting only this subset of the whole experimental design we ensured that all three samples were comparable as they were treated in the same way . in each subcompartment the spectral counts for all the detected proteins were retrieved . in total a set of proteins identified in duplicate analyses of the three raw chloroplast subfractions _LOCATION_ was considered . results from replicate experiments showed that spectral counts were repeatable . spectral counts for proteins in the initial set were thus averaged across duplicate analyses for each subcompartment . a training set of proteins with well characterized localization was used to set up the logistic model . altogether of the proteins in the training set were correctly assigned to their subcompartment by the model indicating that spectral counts indeed contain information about protein localization . to test the model another subset of proteins distinct from the training set was selected based on their _PROTEIN_ curated localization . the logistic model was applied to this test set and in total of the proteins were assigned to the same localization as in _PROTEIN_ . all envelope proteins were correctly assigned and contradictory assignments were obtained for only stroma and _LOCATION_ proteins . it is worth noting that some localizations indicated in _PROTEIN_ could be questionable and the _LOCATION_ rate of the model could be overestimated based on this test set . the statistical analysis thus demonstrated the predictive power of spectral count data for the determination of the subplastidial localization of chloroplast proteins . to fully take into account the wealth of information contained in the database we collected spectral counts from all analyses _PROTEIN_ of the sample treatment . moreover because spectral counting is a semiquantitative approach significant ratios and thresholds are generally high . we therefore decided to take into account only proteins identified with at least spectral counts . for each protein and each chloroplast subfraction _LOCATION_ the number of associated spectra was retrieved from the identification database . as each subfraction was characterized by a different number of _METHOD_ spectra spectral counts were normalized with respect to the number of assigned _METHOD_ spectra in each fraction . based on relative spectral counts across the three chloroplast subfractions a percentage of occurrence in each subfraction was calculated for all proteins . taking cross contamination into consideration based on the western blot data proteins were attributed a single dual or mixed subplastidial localization . a single localization was thus assigned to proteins for which the percentages of occurrence in the two other subfractions were below a threshold level we arbitrarily fixed at . dual localization was assigned to proteins with a major localization and a secondary localization . the remaining proteins were considered to be localized in any of the three subplastidial compartments . eventually proteins were considered with respect to their subplastidial localization based on spectral count measurements . we subsequently verified that the localization given by normalized spectral counts agreed with the most likely localization estimated by the logistic regression model . only proteins had a contradictory localization and the localization given by normalized spectral counts was always the one most in agreement with the literature . to further assess the reliability of our spectral count derived localizations we compared them with annotations found in _PROTEIN_ and in tair . fig . shows that about of the selected proteins were actually annotated to be _LOCATION_ whereas only were annotated as being localized in other cellular compartments . among proteins annotated as being _LOCATION_ the subplastidial proteomic localization of of them was in agreement with the information found in _PROTEIN_ and/or tair . overall these data indicate that about of the protein data set were properly localized when compared with their annotated subplastidial localization . only of these proteins showed a spectral counting based localization that did not correspond to annotations . in summary both statistics and comparisons with literature data indicated that the spectral counting approach used in the present study proved to be efficient in assigning subplastidial localization . this information is essential to further investigate the function and localization of the proteins for which no subplastidial localization information could be found in either _PROTEIN_ or tair at the time when our data were compiled . cross contamination evaluated using spectral counting was in good agreement with western blot data . for instance spectral counting estimated the contamination of purified envelope fractions by _LOCATION_ proteins to be about whereas it was estimated to be about by western blot experiments . contamination of purified envelope fraction by stroma proteins was estimated to be about by spectral counting in good agreement with the found by western blot . however such quantifications might be biased if the purified _LOCATION_ or stroma fractions were significantly contaminated with envelope _LOCATION_ proteins . as deduced from reverse experiments this was not the case as envelope markers were poorly detected in the stroma or the _LOCATION_ respectively . although mitochondria are generally expected to be a major source of contamination of the purified chloroplast we only detected five genuine mitochondrial proteins that were not previously demonstrated to be dually targeted to both the _LOCATION_ and the mitochondria . indeed some proteins identified during chloroplast envelope proteomics analyses were also detected during proteomics analyses of mitochondrial preparations . some of these proteins are already known to be dually targeted to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . this phenomenon was recently reviewed and proteins were shown to be targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ of which were present in our _PROTEIN_ database . considering envelope samples contamination with mitochondria represents only when considering spectral counting . this value is in good agreement with previous demonstration of the low if any contamination of the envelope fraction with mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . this is also true for other cell compartments like _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tonoplast or _LOCATION_ . some contaminants stem from the _LOCATION_ and belong to machineries or macromolecular complexes reported to be associated to the outer surface of mitochondria such as the s ribosome in yeast human and algae . by similarity we can not exclude that the _LOCATION_ translation machinery is interacting with the outer surface of the chloroplast . however it is important to note that the number of spectra corresponding to these _LOCATION_ ribosomal subunits is very low representing altogether less than of the value obtained for all proteins detected in purified envelope fractions . the same is true for _LOCATION_ proteins _METHOD_ that were also detected in the purified envelope fraction . recently oikawa et al . isolated an a. thaliana mutant in which light induced relocalization of chloroplasts was defective and pointed out the _PROTEIN_ protein . this protein contains an actin binding domain and is localized in the outer envelope of chloroplasts thus supporting the idea that chloroplasts can interact with actin filaments . other data have also recently provided evidence for the interaction of members of these protein families with the outer surface of _LOCATION_ . accordingly these proteins were classified as proteins potentially interacting with the outer surface of the chloroplast rather than as _LOCATION_ contaminants . another possible source of contamination concerns the _LOCATION_ . however the chloroplast is known to interact with the _LOCATION_ for chloroplast protein and lipid trafficking . in support of this we found a few proteins that are known or suspected to interact with or colocalize with the _LOCATION_ and therefore could also interact with the outer surface of the chloroplast . finally the estimate of contamination with non _LOCATION_ proteins was about when considering the number of proteins but less than when considering their actual amount as estimated by spectral counting . the current validated _PROTEIN_ database gathers proteins identified by unique peptide sequences . these figures come very close to results obtained by zybailov et al . who identified proteins in high throughput analyses of soluble and _LOCATION_ chloroplast fractions . our data taken together with those results show that almost chloroplast proteins or proteins associated to the chloroplast are amenable to proteomics investigations . the _PROTEIN_ database also provides detailed proteomics information _METHOD_ as we gathered all the information about the identified unique peptide sequences . an access database is available containing all protein identifications and analytical coordinates to be used with the chloroplast protein amt database http //www.grenoble.prabi.fr/protehome/grenoble plant proteomics/ and protein subplastidial localization deduced from spectral counting . although the information on chloroplast proteins presently available in public databases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highly reliable for proteins from _LOCATION_ and stroma these databases contain less information about the envelope proteome . we therefore decided to pay special attention to this unique _LOCATION_ system by combining our proteomics results together with a thorough survey of the literature . half of the _PROTEIN_ proteins were actually identified from an envelope fraction . these data together with additional identifications and manual validation allowed us to identify about proteins in envelope fractions . such a number is quite remarkable as the envelope represents about of the total protein content of the chloroplast . in addition to the present proteomics data we present in supplemental data all the publicly available information retrieved from the literature about the proteins identified in purified envelope fractions . we therefore compiled information about the present proteomics data results of predictions by bioinformatics tools information retrieved from different protein databanks _PROTEIN_ appropriate literature and other proteomics studies targeted to the chloroplast but also to other cell compartments whose proteins are likely to be contaminants . all this information was used and evaluated to provide curated descriptions functions and localizations for all proteins identified from proteomics investigations of the chloroplast envelope . the present protein repertoire is organized in several categories according to the expected or experimental subcellular localization of the proteins in various compartments i.e. inner envelope _LOCATION_ outer envelope _LOCATION_ envelope ? stroma _LOCATION_ and any combinations of the three subplastidial compartments _LOCATION_ when the proteins where recovered in more than one _LOCATION_ compartment . taking into consideration the present study and previously published proteomes targeted to the chloroplast envelope a total number of proteins has been detected in purified envelope fractions among which were only identified in this work and were only identified in the work by froehlich et al . . compared with the data published by zybailov et al . of the proteins identified in this work in purified envelope fractions were previously detected in the chloroplast . from the proteins identified for the first time in purified envelope fractions proteins were previously identified in the chloroplast whereas proteins were not . with respect to envelope specific analyses this work allowed us to identify proteins absent from the chloroplast proteome from zybailov et al . . this suggests that these proteins could not be detected in complex chloroplast subfractions . alternatively some of these proteins might also be non _LOCATION_ contaminants specifically enriched in chloroplast envelope preparations _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and that were too poorly represented in more complex chloroplast fractions . however of the new proteins identified during this work almost likely reside at the envelope could be classified as inner envelope _LOCATION_ components six could be classified as outer envelope components and could be classified as envelope proteins shared with the stroma or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . on the contrary one third of these proteins correspond to minor proteins mostly of unknown function and lacking a predictable _LOCATION_ targeting peptide . these proteins might thus be so far unknown outer envelope components proteins interacting with the outer surface of the chloroplast inner envelope proteins with _LOCATION_ primary sequences lacking correct n termini or finally proteins lacking canonical and thus predictable targeting sequences . supplemental data also describes previously known or expected functional categories assigned to the proteins detected in the purified envelope fractions in the present work . importantly clear cut data from the literature were first considered as the primary criterion to classify the identified proteins within functional categories . when available functional classification was also deduced from mapmanbin data or pfam predictions . proteins were classified as unknown protein when no functional category could be assigned . these analyses are summarized in the curated function column of supplemental data . this functional classification provided an overview of the _PROTEIN_ functions carried out by envelope _LOCATION_ . when considering the whole envelope proteome i.e . the proteins that were detected in purified envelope fractions the three _PROTEIN_ functional categories were unknown metabolism and transporters . as expected numerous envelope proteins still require functional characterization and for of them no functional information could be deduced or even predicted from the analysis of their primary sequence . when considering the more specific envelope proteome i.e . the proteins that were more abundant in purified envelope fractions when compared with levels in other _LOCATION_ subcompartments these three _PROTEIN_ categories still represent and respectively . it is also clear that the two categories chaperone and protease and translation stroma are reduced within this group of proteins suggesting that members of these two categories are mostly shared between envelope _LOCATION_ and the two other _LOCATION_ subcompartments . within these envelope proteins chaperone and protease and protein targeting stand for and respectively . in other words the five above cited _PROTEIN_ categories comprise more than of the chloroplast envelope proteins . in the present work chloroplast envelope proteins were identified at an unprecedented level of sensitivity . several parameters explain this progress the improved sensitivity of recent _METHOD_ based technologies the lack of physical or chemical treatments of purified _LOCATION_ fractions which interestingly remove most soluble contaminants derived from other cell compartments but also eliminate peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins loosely bound to the inner or outer surface of the envelope _LOCATION_ system and the simultaneous analysis of the three chloroplast subcompartments which allows identification of genuine envelope proteins that were previously suspected to reside at the stroma or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . finally of the proteins identified in envelope fractions proteins were shown to actually reside at the envelope and of these proteins were demonstrated to be only or mostly detected in purified envelope fractions when compared with other _LOCATION_ subcompartments . prior to the present study the subplastidial localization of most envelope proteins remained unknown unclear or _LOCATION_ as can be seen from supplemental data . this was especially true for the envelope proteins that were only or mostly detected in purified envelope fractions . to evaluate the progress provided by our experimental data we compared our information with three independent studies or reference databases . fewer than of these proteins were described to be associated with the envelope in at least one study or database and fewer than were assigned to envelope localization by at least two of these three studies . more than of the genuine envelope proteins that are shared with the stroma or the _LOCATION_ fractions were previously identified and their precise subplastidial localization was determined . however it is important to note that for of the envelope proteins shared with the stroma and for of the envelope proteins shared with the _LOCATION_ the alternative localization _LOCATION_ was the only proposed localization . some databases like _PROTEIN_ contain rigorous information about subcellular localization of proteins that is not based on prediction and only provide it if sufficient information is available . consequently our experimental data will be helpful to implement these databases . the presence of low but significant levels of _LOCATION_ proteins in purified envelope fractions raises the question of the relevance of such a dual localization . in _PROTEIN_ dual localization in envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of some enzymes can result from either the actual compartmentation of chloroplast metabolism or contamination . many proteins belonging to major protein complexes involved in the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis _PROTEIN_ were identified during this study . we analyzed the localization of their subunits that were identified by more than spectral counts . as expected most of these proteins were localized in the _LOCATION_ . with a closer look at the localization data noticeable differences appeared . indeed most subunits of the psi and of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ complex were detected in the envelope fraction in significant proportion _LOCATION_ but it was not the case for psii subunits or lhc proteins . questions about the half life of synthesis and probability of accumulation within the envelope of _LOCATION_ encoded precursors were excluded because this enrichment also concerns chloroplast encoded subunits of both the _PROTEIN_ and psi . another option was the specific contamination of purified envelope fractions with specific _LOCATION_ vesicles during the subplastidial fractionation process . the _PROTEIN_ distribution of the _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll protein complexes between appressed and non appressed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is a well described process that participates in _PROTEIN_ of photosynthesis to changeable environmental conditions . psi and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ synthase complexes are almost exclusively localized in unstacked regions whereas psii is mostly present in the stacked regions of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus the subplastidial localization of psi and _PROTEIN_ synthase partly in the envelope proteins could be explained by two phenomena either the unstacked regions of _LOCATION_ being lighter than grana are co purified with envelope _LOCATION_ or the unstacked regions of the _LOCATION_ really interact with the envelope . in any case the partial localization of _LOCATION_ proteins in the envelope could indicate an actual localization in the unstacked region of _LOCATION_ . according to spectral count data many proteins appear to be shared by the envelope and the stroma . this represents of the proteins found to be more abundant in purified envelope fractions and of the envelope proteins shown to actually reside at the envelope . some specific classes of proteins seem to be specifically affected by this phenomenon . of the ribosomal or ribosome binding proteins identified in the present study were shared by envelope and stroma fractions . seven proteins were _PROTEIN_ recovered in the envelope fraction and were _PROTEIN_ recovered in the stroma with an average envelope representation of thus far above the expected representation of stroma contaminants in the envelope fraction . on the other hand proteins were only detected in the stroma and one _LOCATION_ encoded protein _PROTEIN_ was even found to be more abundant in the _LOCATION_ than in the stroma . this might indicate that the _LOCATION_ ribosomal complexes are dynamic structures that are highly mobile within the chloroplast to be recruited at a precise localization for protein synthesis . proteases are critical regulatory _PROTEIN_ for many metabolic and degradation processes within the cell but also within the _LOCATION_ . according to their localization in the chloroplast proteases have different roles . we extracted from the _PROTEIN_ database proteins classified as proteases by mapmanbin and examined the spectral count based suborganellar localization . strikingly major protease classes have specific subplastidial localization . it is currently acknowledged that clp proteases are localized in the stroma . however some of the clp proteases identified here were more abundant in the envelope . some ftsh proteins have been shown to be anchored to the stromal surface of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and are involved in degradation of unassembled proteins and in the turnover of the protein of the psii reaction center . among the identified ftsh proteins seven were only detected in the envelope . this finding addresses the question of the specific role of ftsh proteins in the envelope . two subunits and of accase were previously shown to strongly interact with the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . in good agreement with these data _PROTEIN_ and the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ subunits were only detected in the envelope . on the contrary the two other members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the same accase complex were found to be more enriched in the stroma in good agreement with other previously published data localizing the accase complex within the stroma . one explanation for the different localization of members of the same protein complex would be that during chloroplast breakage some subunits are released in the stroma because of a weak interaction within the complex . another explanation would be related to the regulation of the accase complex function through interaction . this last hypothesis strengthens previous data demonstrating that the chloroplast accase complex can dissociate and reassociate accase is at least partially associated to the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope and the biotin carrier subunit is more susceptible than the other subunits to solubilization during extraction . the chloroplast genomes of most higher plants contain two giant open reading frames designated as and . although their function is unknown these chloroplast genes are essential for cell life as homoplasmic mutant plants could not be obtained from attempts to disrupt these genes . surprisingly the two chloroplast gene products _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were almost exclusively found in chloroplast envelope fractions . _PROTEIN_ contains several predicted helices and was thus suspected to be associated to the _LOCATION_ however it was never detected within _LOCATION_ by proteomics . _PROTEIN_ protein does not contain predicted transmembrane helices and was previously suspected to be associated to the stroma but it was not detected in the stroma . therefore the present data clearly demonstrate that these two proteins reside at the chloroplast envelope . these data allow unambiguously upgrading the list of chloroplast encoded and envelope localized proteins . the lack of detectable _PROTEIN_ protein which was previously associated to the chloroplast envelope in any of the chloroplast subfractions suggests that this protein might either be too poorly _PROTEIN_ to be detected or only transiently _PROTEIN_ . only proteins could be unambiguously associated to the outer envelope _LOCATION_ due to availability of previously published data . these proteins could be classified into four categories . the first category included a series of five proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ one identified for the first time one identified previously and two more identified recently were demonstrated to act as solute or ion channels . the second category included six members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family with four of them being previously known envelope proteins . there is still some controversy about the exact role of these proteins which have been proposed as either amino acid or specific preprotein transporters . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ which was not previously detected in envelope fractions but was shown to be only targeted to mitochondria was also identified during this work . however because this protein is one of the rare proteins detected in the envelope fraction with only one peptide this result should be considered with caution . the third category included seven components of the toc translocon . again the almost certainly less abundant protein _PROTEIN_ was the only protein not to have been identified during earlier proteomics works . it is interesting to note that only one isoform of the family was identified here in good agreement with the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial localization of i and v respectively . finally if one excludes proteins recently associated to the outer envelope _LOCATION_ through targeted biochemical studies e.g . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ very few identified proteins could be associated to this _LOCATION_ system during this work . this limit directly results from the _PROTEIN_ that about of these proteins lack a predicted chloroplast transit peptide . as a consequence it is expected that several proteins identified during this work and classified in the envelope ? category might be new components of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ . about proteins present in the _PROTEIN_ database have no chlorop predictable transit peptides and therefore could have various origins . some of them can be encoded by the chloroplast genome indeed this was the case for of them i.e . of the total proteome . other possibilities exist for the remaining proteins . they can reside at the outer envelope as most of them are expected not to bear a predictable chloroplast transit peptide . they can also be derived from extraplastidial contamination . however in several cases the chlorop prediction could be wrong . for instance chlorop does not predict any transit peptide for the phosphate/triose phosphate translocator a major envelope protein known to be cleaved to its mature form during import to the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . furthermore some genes are not properly predicted and this can lead to _LOCATION_ chlorop predictions for the actual targeting of the deduced protein . in addition some chloroplast proteins do not have any canonical transit peptide and utilize alternatives routes for protein import into the chloroplast . we therefore performed complementary experiments to address these questions for some of the proteins identified here . we first wanted to validate the subcellular localization of proteins recently associated to the chloroplast but lacking a predictable transit peptide . two proteins _PROTEIN_ and were fused to cyan _METHOD_ protein and their subcellular localization was analyzed in a transgenic arabidopsis plant by _METHOD_ microscopy . in good agreement with recently published data we obtained evidence for _LOCATION_ targeting of both _PROTEIN_ which behaves as an outer envelope _LOCATION_ protein and which was previously demonstrated through subcellular fractionation and antibody detection to behave as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . altogether these data demonstrate that these two proteins are genuine chloroplast proteins . the conclusion was very different for the two proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we detected in envelope fractions . having been predicted as potassium transporters one would expect that they contain a classical transit peptide like most inner envelope _LOCATION_ proteins and especially transporters . searching for experimental information about their n termini we could not find any ests in arabidopsis databases . these two proteins were of similar size to orthologues in bacteria algae and other plants . however we detected rice orthologues containing a huge additional n terminus . searching for sequences similar to this additional n terminus within the arabidopsis genome we detected two unknown arabidopsis proteins . the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ was identified as that was also detected in the envelope during this work . the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ was identified as an like protein _PROTEIN_ . performing pcr amplification of cdnas using primers selected within the and kea sequences we demonstrated that these two predicted proteins are in _PROTEIN_ two parts of the same large envelope protein . in other words the n terminal regions of kea proteins are not predicted to contain _LOCATION_ targeting peptides because these predicted n termini are in _PROTEIN_ central parts of a genuine chloroplast envelope protein . because of the huge size of the expected cdnas the n terminus of the proteins was not covered by existing est sequences . however the n terminus of the like protein is predicted to contain a classical _LOCATION_ targeting peptide in good agreement with its localization within the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . furthermore rapid amplification of cdna end pcr experiments are required to validate these predicted n terminal sequences and it is expected that the correct n terminus of should also contain such a classical _LOCATION_ targeting peptide . we also detected the _PROTEIN_ anhydrases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the envelope and the stroma . however if _PROTEIN_ is effectively expected to be localized within the stroma _PROTEIN_ was recently demonstrated to be exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ . as discussed above the envelope is poorly contaminated with _LOCATION_ proteins . trying to understand the presence of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ we found that the tair database contains five predicted structures of the _PROTEIN_ protein . one model has a short n terminus that is not predicted to contain a _LOCATION_ targeting sequence . the four other models contain an identical additional n terminal sequence that is predicted as a chloroplast transit peptide . checking the sequence of the primer used previously to amplify the end of the _PROTEIN_ cdna before _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions in planta confirmed that the shortest model was chosen . in other words previous experiments performed to associate _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ might have led to this conclusion due to the use of a truncated version of the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein . alternative splicing might explain the dual localization of the protein in the _LOCATION_ and the chloroplast . however if the present data clearly demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is at least associated to _LOCATION_ alternative splicing leading to the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ remains to be demonstrated . chloroplast envelope fractions were found to be contaminated with abundant markers from the tonoplast . indeed subunits of the same complex the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were detected in the purified envelope fraction . these abundant tonoplast proteins were only seen in envelope _LOCATION_ and never detected in the stroma or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ thus suggesting that envelope is the only _LOCATION_ compartment contaminated with abundant tonoplast proteins . surprisingly two _PROTEIN_ type aquaporins were specifically detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction one of them was even enriched in the _LOCATION_ when compared with its content in the envelope . as none of the abundant tonoplast markers could be detected in purified envelope fractions this suggests that the association of these _PROTEIN_ proteins with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ might be real . the presence of aquaporins in the chloroplast has recently been suggested . in good agreement with these data we also detected in envelope preparations _LOCATION_ four members of the _PROTEIN_ family during this study . again these four proteins were classified as putative contaminants but the genuine envelope localization of one or several _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ family can not be excluded . the present work produced some data that are in conflict with previously published studies . recent data described the identification _PROTEIN_ and functional analyses of _PROTEIN_ a novel _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ carrier from arabidopsis . in _PROTEIN_ proteomics provides a strikingly different view as this protein was detected in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ but never in extensive proteome analyses targeted to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore a number of proteomics studies favor the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a genuine envelope protein . another recent study described the identification _PROTEIN_ and functional _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ na dependent phosphate transporter from arabidopsis . in this report _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the _LOCATION_ and not detected in purified envelope _LOCATION_ . again in our study _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the envelope and not detected during extensive proteomics analyses targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we thus raised specific polyclonal antibodies against the _PROTEIN_ protein . in good agreement with the proteomics data the _PROTEIN_ protein was only detected within the purified envelope _LOCATION_ and not detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as detection of this signal in the envelope _LOCATION_ might have resulted from cross hybridization of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies with another envelope protein the _PROTEIN_ protein was overexpressed in arabidopsis and envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from two independent overexpressing plants were purified . altogether these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a genuine envelope protein and does not reside at the _LOCATION_ . chloroplast metabolism is highly compartmentalized and spectral counting provided an interesting view of the interacting roles of envelope stroma and _LOCATION_ . as expected protein localization and compartmentation of well known chloroplast functions were strongly correlated . for instance transport functions are _PROTEIN_ localized in the envelope . the case of proteins involved in amino acid metabolism is also remarkable as most of the proteins of this functional class were exclusively identified in stroma fractions . among the numerous chloroplast pathways essential for _PROTEIN_ fixation lipid metabolism and starch and amino acid biosynthesis we will emphasize here on only two examples lipid and terpenoid metabolism because they involve the three _PROTEIN_ chloroplast compartments . about a hundred proteins involved in lipid metabolism have been identified in chloroplasts by proteomics and we know now which genes are actually _PROTEIN_ in mature chloroplasts . for instance several key proteins are clearly missing from the chloroplast protein repertoire a conspicuous example concerns several galactolipid synthesizing enzymes as only the major _PROTEIN_ was identified . in _PROTEIN_ this is not so surprising as the missing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are mostly _PROTEIN_ in non green tissues and therefore only very minor amounts should be present in leaves whereas _PROTEIN_ of the genes encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is induced when plants are subjected to phosphate deprivation . spectral counting provides further molecular evidence for two _PROTEIN_ chloroplast compartments playing a major role in lipid biosynthesis . the initial steps of fatty acid biosynthesis take place in the stroma with some interaction with the envelope at key steps . then the envelope _LOCATION_ concentrate most of the proteins involved in chloroplast glycerolipid metabolism fatty acid desaturation and formation of fatty acid derived signaling molecules . furthermore proteomics also provides some clues on the complex dialogue which is essential to produce prokaryotic and eukaryotic chloroplast lipids that takes place between the envelope _LOCATION_ and the endomembranes as the whole set of tgd proteins was identified by proteomics in envelope _LOCATION_ . targeted proteomics also helped draw a picture of the tight metabolic network for terpenoid metabolism involving about a hundred of proteins residing within all chloroplast compartments . supplemental data demonstrates that almost all enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of soluble precursors for chlorophyll carotenoids or prenylquinones were identified unambiguously in the stroma fraction . then protoporphyrin ix is formed within the chloroplast _LOCATION_ and is channeled into different pathways the ferrochelatase involved in heme biosynthesis is tightly linked to _LOCATION_ whereas chlorophyll biosynthesis takes place in both _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ . in contrast proteomics revealed that the biosynthesis of hydrophobic carotenoids and prenylquinones is almost restricted to envelope _LOCATION_ . although our understanding of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants has been advanced greatly in the past decade primarily as a result of molecular genetic and biochemical genomics based approaches very little was known about its precise localization within chloroplasts mostly because these enzymes have historically proven to be extremely difficult to purify and analyze . indeed the present data allowed careful examination of the subplastidial localization of proteins of carotenoid metabolism and led to the conclusion that enzymes involved in phytoene desaturation and cyclization of lycopene reside tat the envelope _LOCATION_ that are responsible for generating carotenoid diversity as these pathways mark a branch point to two major cyclic carotenoid groups the carotenoids and carotenoids . zeaxanthin is then converted to the epoxycarotenoid violaxanthin by an epoxidase whereas the reverse reaction is catalyzed by a de epoxidase . here the enzymes involved show a unique distribution among the chloroplast _LOCATION_ that is related to the function of xanthophylls within these two _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . whereas the epoxidase is present in both envelope _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ the de epoxidase is restricted to _LOCATION_ . the envelope _LOCATION_ which are devoid of de epoxidase activity are therefore involved in violaxanthin synthesis whereas in _LOCATION_ both epoxidase and de epoxidase catalyze the reactions of the so called xanthophyll cycle responsible for non photochemical quenching of singlet excited chlorophyll during photosynthesis . this suggests that envelope _LOCATION_ because of carotenoids and prenylquinones have a safeguarding function in chloroplasts especially against oxidative stress . this investigation concerns chloroplasts the organelles of the plant cell that harbor the chemical process by which green plants synthesize organic compounds from _PROTEIN_ dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight . analyzing the chloroplast proteome not only helps understanding how plants efficiently harvest light energy but will also lead to a better understanding of the multitude of functions of the chloroplast as the chloroplast is essential for _PROTEIN_ fixation lipid metabolism and starch and amino acid biosynthesis . this constitutes an important economic issue not only from the plant biotechnology standpoint but also for the production of highly energetic compounds via cultivation of microalgae such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii . the present work can also provide a strong basis to carry out differential proteomics in other physiologically and economically important _LOCATION_ such as amyloplasts and chromoplasts . the present work is the first study designed to address the accurate proteomics based localization of chloroplast proteins with respect to the three major chloroplast compartments stroma _LOCATION_ and envelope . we identified proteins thus matching previous results obtained in a comparable high throughput experiment . as a whole the data currently available indicate that almost chloroplast proteins are amenable to proteomics investigations with current _METHOD_ technologies and conventional fractionation techniques . this only represents one third to one half of the total proteins that are estimated to be localized within the chloroplast . as mentioned above several key proteins are still clearly missing from the chloroplast protein repertoire . to get a more exhaustive repertoire of the arabidopsis chloroplast forthcoming generations of _METHOD_ spectrometers will probably be more sensitive and will help to increase this repertoire . nevertheless getting a better overview of the chloroplast proteome will _PROTEIN_ rely on more targeted strategies . first sample preparation and fractionation of _LOCATION_ subfractions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ could be improved to gain access to minor chloroplast proteins . those types of fractions will be worth revisiting with current _METHOD_ instrumentations and bioinformatics tools . also other types of _LOCATION_ could be analyzed to identify proteins that are more abundant in those types of _LOCATION_ . unfortunately not all plants species can be used for purifying specialized _LOCATION_ . second _METHOD_ targeted approaches can be used to check whether proteins that are suspected to be chloroplast localized are actually localized in the chloroplast . to do so selected reaction monitoring could be used to detect proteins of interest . with the use of internal standards an assessment of the amount of the targeted proteins within the a given fraction could also be given . another interesting extension of our work would be through the use of a top down analytical strategy to study full length envelope proteins from their native environment to access information about protein processing and post translational modifications . the present report also represents a unique resource for _LOCATION_ envelope proteins with respect to both functional and localization issues . highly curated information on proteins identified in the envelope fraction revealed new insight and ascertained some hypotheses about the different _METHOD_ associated to the envelope . these data provide unexpected localization information for many chloroplast proteins that were often either not known to reside within the envelope _LOCATION_ or incorrectly associated to the wrong subplastidial compartment . forthcoming review articles targeted to specific chloroplast _METHOD_ are required to delve deeper into the wealth of information contained in our experimental data and to compare these results with previously known or suspected subplastidial localization of the corresponding proteins . the information derived from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ database will thus be of valuable interest for the plant community . this is particularly true for the envelope compartment as the envelope _LOCATION_ are the only _LOCATION_ structure common to all types of _LOCATION_ and present at all stages of _LOCATION_ differentiation . finally the present work also provides the first amt database dedicated to plant and usable for label free quantification experiments . thus it now becomes possible to identify and quantify thousands of chloroplast peptides via high throughput nano lc _METHOD_ experiments . such experiments are currently being carried out to screen the impact of different environmental conditions or of knock out mutations at the chloroplast level . moreover such an _PROTEIN_ database is usable by any laboratory having a high resolution _METHOD_ spectrometer _PROTEIN_ provided that standardization of the retention times is achieved and that tools dedicated to the amt strategy are used .
arabidopsis plants wassilewskija background were grown in culture chambers at with a light intensity of in standard conditions . all operations were carried out at . percoll purified chloroplasts were obtained from g of a. thaliana leaves with a yield approaching . several replicates of chloroplast preparation were obtained . purified intact chloroplasts were then lysed in hypotonic medium and envelope _LOCATION_ and stroma subfractions were purified on a sucrose gradient and stored as described previously . analyses of the purity of chloroplast envelope preparations were performed as described previously . they were found to be slightly contaminated by other cell _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . analyses of the cross contamination of the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_

blot analyses gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the proteins were detected using the polyclonal antibodies using either alkaline phosphatase or ecl detection . to validate purity of the purified envelope _LOCATION_ fractions we used rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against the chloroplast envelope ceqorh protein at a dilution the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ at a dilution the mitochondria _PROTEIN_ protein at a dilution and the _LOCATION_ light harvesting complex proteins at a dilution . chlorophyll content was also determined by spectrophotometry in acetone solutions . to quantify the cross contamination of the purified envelope _LOCATION_ fractions with proteins derived from other chloroplast subfractions we used rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against the envelope ceqorh protein the envelope _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ lhcps the stroma kari protein and the _PROTEIN_ protein . to quantify the natural abundance of three identified envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ ceqorh and _PROTEIN_ antibodies used were directed against the envelope _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ceqorh and the his recombinant protein . to validate the arabidopsis mutant antibodies used were directed against the inner envelope _LOCATION_ protein at a dilution the ceqorh protein at a dilution and the protein at a dilution . to validate the subplastidial localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the his recombinant protein was used . prior to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis different sample preparation procedures were used for whole chloroplast stroma _LOCATION_ and envelope fractions . before in gel or in solution digestion specific treatments were undertaken . some _LOCATION_ fractions were treated using chloroform/methanol extraction or _LOCATION_ washing with m naoh . the stromal fraction rich in rubisco protein was submitted to ammonium acetate precipitation to precipitate this highly abundant protein with or without a strataclean purification step for protein concentration . some chloroplast envelope proteins were extracted using alkaline conditions as already described . to solubilize _LOCATION_ proteins present in both the outer and the inner surfaces of the envelope vesicles sonication of the _LOCATION_ preparations was also performed during this treatment . the resulting mixtures were stored for min on ice before centrifugation . insoluble proteins were recovered as white pellets and further analyzed . following these purification steps most of the samples were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ either in the conventional separating mode or in the stacking mode . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analyses were performed as described . after _METHOD_ blue staining to reveal proteins the gel was cut into discrete bands . in gel digestion with trypsin was carried out as described previously with the following modification after washing and drying gel pieces were rehydrated in of at room temperature for min in the dark . this step led to cysteine oxidation and conversion of the methionine residues into sulfone . gel pieces were then extracted with formic acid solution . additionally some samples were also digested in solution without prior _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation as described . for all experiments tryptic peptides were resuspended in aqueous trifluoroacetic acid . approximately ng of digested sample was injected for each analysis . for experiments carried out using a q tof type instrument the samples were injected into a caplc nano lc system and first preconcentrated on a mm pepmap precolumn . the peptides were then eluted onto a column . the chromatographic separation used a gradient from solution a to solution b over min at a flow rate of nl/min . the lc system was directly coupled to a q tof ultima _METHOD_ spectrometer . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data were acquired automatically using the _METHOD_ software . the _METHOD_ data were automatically processed using the mascot distiller software to generate mgf files . for each set of samples the q tof mgf files were concatenated with mascot daemon _PROTEIN_ for further database searching . other experiments were performed on a tesla hybrid linear ion trap fourier transform _METHOD_ spectrometer _PROTEIN_ . the experimental sequence consisted of one high resolution _METHOD_ acquisition in the icr cell and three _METHOD_ scans in the linear ion trap in parallel with the _METHOD_ acquisition . dynamic exclusion was activated for ions within ppm of a selected peak and eluting in a min window and one repeat scan was allowed within s. an ultimate nano hplc system _METHOD_ equipped with a dynamic flow control and a pepmap column was coupled to the _PROTEIN_ icr instrument . mobile phases a and b . the gradient was b over min followed by a min ramp to b. _METHOD_ data were acquired in the _METHOD_ detection mode of operation on a m/z range . the automated gain control target was set to accumulated charges and the maximum allowable accumulation time was set to _METHOD_ . the ltq _PROTEIN_ raw data were converted into mgf files using mascot distiller and mascot daemon _PROTEIN_ for further database searching . database searching was carried out using the mascot program _PROTEIN_ available by intranet . two databases were compiled a home made list of well known contaminants and an updated compilation of the a. thaliana protein database provided by tair _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the variable modifications allowed were acetyl methionine oxidation methionine sulfone and cysteic acid . one missed trypsin cleavage was allowed and trypsin/p was used as the enzyme . the _METHOD_ tolerances were ppm for precursor ions and da for fragment ions . for the ltq _PROTEIN_ data to assess false positive rate the corresponding reverse sequences of all entries were added to the compiled database as described by peng et al . . a target _PROTEIN_ database search was then performed . validation and false positive rate assessment were performed using the irma software . automatic data validation was carried out using the following parameters . the number of report hits was fixed automatically to retrieve proteins with a p value as defined by mascot such as p < . only peptides ranked first and with an identity threshold such as the p value as defined by mascot corresponding to p < were kept . considering those validation parameters the false discovery rate _PROTEIN_ as described by peng et al . was estimated to be for the overall identification database . identifications were automatically consolidated to a _METHOD_ spectral identification database _METHOD_ using a software developed in our laboratory . additionally short peptides were removed . the filtering based on peptide length resulted in a drop in _PROTEIN_ to . we subsequently removed peptides pointing to the reverse database . using a home made script protein redundancy was eliminated on the basis of proteins being identified by a same set or a subset of peptides . from the so generated protein groups an additional validation step was added . protein groups represented by more than one peptide were automatically kept and protein groups identified by a single peptide were kept only if the corresponding peptide had a mascot score above . _METHOD_ queries characterizing single hit proteins and the corresponding identifications are available as supplementary material . an amt database was created by extracting each unique sequence calculated molecular weight pair in the identification database and computing the average retention time observed over all occurrences of the corresponding peptide . the maximum score with which a peptide was identified in all analyses was also included in the amt database as a measure of confidence in this identification . for q tof data validation was carried out using the following parameters . the number of report hits was fixed automatically to retrieve proteins with a p value as defined by mascot such as p < . a peptide score cutoff was applied so that the _PROTEIN_ was about . proteins identified with at least two peptides were automatically validated . _METHOD_ spectra corresponding to proteins identified by one peptide were validated manually . protein names and/or associated functions were retrieved from ncbi _PROTEIN_ or tair . _PROTEIN_ molecular weight pi and targetp annotations were retrieved from _PROTEIN_ . predictions of _LOCATION_ spanning regions were collected from the _PROTEIN_ database . the hmmtop program was also used for transmembrane domain predictions . chloroplast transit peptides were predicted using the chlorop algorithm . spectral counting was used to compare protein amounts in subplastidial fractions . to assess the significance of spectral counts for localization assignment a logistic regression model was developed . a training set was defined by selecting proteins whose function allowed confident assignment to a specific subcompartment . we selected as representative of the envelope compartment proteins whose functions were determined to be transporter but not electron transporter or protein targeting or . for the stroma proteins annotated as taking part in the calvin cycle or in amino acid and metabolism were selected . for the _LOCATION_ proteins with the keyword photosystem in their annotation were chosen . a mixture model multinomial logistic regression was used to predict localization based on spectral count data for each subcompartment . all calculations were performed using jmp . a model was built based on the training set described above . for each protein the model evaluated the probabilities that it belonged to each subcompartment where xi is the spectral count value from each subcompartment for protein i and is the estimate of the model coefficient . based on these three probabilities the model then assigned a most likely localization to each protein . to test the model another subset of proteins distinct from the training set was selected based on their _PROTEIN_ curated localization . in total envelope proteins were selected based on the _METHOD_ envelope inner envelope inner integral envelope intermembrane space envelope outer or envelope outer integral in their _PROTEIN_ localization . for the stroma proteins having the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ stroma in their _PROTEIN_ localization were chosen . for the _LOCATION_ proteins having the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integral or _LOCATION_ peripheral lumenal side in their _PROTEIN_ localization were picked . logistic fits of protein localization versus spectral count values for proteins in the test set also indicated a predictive value of the spectral count data . to fully exploit the wealth of information provided by our identification database we decided to include all experimental data to carry out the localization prediction not only those from the analyses of the one dimensional gels of each fraction . using sql queries the number of spectra corresponding to each identified protein was extracted from each series of analyses obtained on chloroplast subfractions envelope _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and stroma _METHOD_ . for each series of lc _METHOD_ experiments the spectral count for protein i in subcompartment n was normalized based on the total number of spectra identified in this subcompartment . finally the percentage of occurrence for each protein i in a given subcompartment n was estimated by the normalized spectral counts in subcompartment n divided by the sum of normalized spectral counts in all three compartments _LOCATION_ .
