abscisic acid regulates stomatal closure in response to water loss . here we examined the competence of guard cells to synthesize aba using two arabidopsis aba biosynthetic enzymes . pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into guard cells of broad bean leaves . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected at the chloroplasts whereas green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were in the _LOCATION_ . the stomatal aperture was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed guard cells . this indicated that aba biosynthesis is stimulated by heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase _PROTEIN_ proteins which both seem to be regulatory enzymes for aba biosynthesis in these cells . furthermore stomatal closure by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that the substrates of the enzymes are present and native aba biosynthesis enzymes are active in guard cells .
before the experiment was started the plant samples for gene introduction were surveyed using a _METHOD_ construct . as arabidopsis leaves are severely damaged by particle bombardment and as the guard cells from arabidopsis leaves are too small for precise measurement of the stomatal aperture we used broad bean leaves for introducing the _METHOD_ constructs into guard cells . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was detected at guard cells per leaf at p.s.i . and cm distance between the gun and sample which was the most efficient combination of pressure and distance tested . we concluded that broad bean leaves are suitable for gene introduction into guard cells by a particle gun . using this system we introduced the promoter derived _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric gene constructs into the guard cells and we investigated the cellular localization of their gene products by monitoring _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals . figure shows confocal laser scanning microscopy images of an exemplary pair of guard cells of which the gene was _PROTEIN_ in one . signals of the _METHOD_ control and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ region while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected at chloroplasts the green signals were merged with the red signal of _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . these results supported the notion that nced is localized in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ indicating that these fusion proteins were correctly _PROTEIN_ in broad bean guard cells . because the lag times for the appearance of the _METHOD_ signal were different among the introduced gene constructs we investigated the timing of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after the introduction of these genes concomitant with stomatal behaviour . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was the fastest among these and about h after bombardment relatively strong green _METHOD_ was detected and a large number of transformed cells with strong _METHOD_ was observed about h after gene introduction . almost all the stomata of which the introduced gene was _PROTEIN_ in one guard cell only showed no difference in half aperture size between un transformed and transformed sides as described in the methods . _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared slower than the _METHOD_ control and were detected continuously about h after introduction . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was the slowest among the three occurring about h after bombardment . the efficiency of the introduction and _PROTEIN_ of these fusion proteins was also much lower than that of the _METHOD_ control and only weak _METHOD_ was detected in cells . however the clear stimulation of stomatal closure was observed with those stomata of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the relationship between the strength of the _METHOD_ signal and stomatal aperture during the time after the introduction we investigated the half aperture size of stomata at different times after bombardment . the results are shown in fig . . during days of the experimental period about a _PROTEIN_ in the half aperture size was observed in the transformed cell side . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was relatively stable once they had been _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the effect of the _PROTEIN_ of the introduced genes on stomatal behaviour and stomata which had had _METHOD_ _METHOD_ detected in one of the pair of guard cells were photographed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . half stomatal apertures of both sides of a pair of guard cells were measured precisely . the aperture values of _METHOD_ gene introduced at and an guard cells were similar and respectively . as a control the values of intact leaves were also measured and these were similar to those of the _METHOD_ introduced stomata . therefore no effect of bombardment was found on the stomatal aperture size . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stomata had an an value of and an at value of . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in an an value of and an at value of . these results showed that the aperture size _PROTEIN_ in gene introduced guard cells when compared to those of non introduced cells . when the at value of the _METHOD_ control was set to at values of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells were and respectively . when the an value of the _METHOD_ control was set to an values of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells were and respectively . the results not only indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was more efficient in stimulating stomatal closure than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was but also that aba synthesized by _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ in one guard cell influenced the adjacent non transformed guard cell . taken together this suggests that aba biosynthetic enzymes translated from the chimera genes possessed their original enzymatic activity and thus promoted aba synthesis and stomatal closure . this also indicated the occurrence of the aba precursors and intermediates such as epoxycarotenoid and abscisic aldehyde in guard cells . interestingly compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ not only caused the stronger closure of at _METHOD_ but also of an _METHOD_ suggesting that nced induced higher levels of aba production than _PROTEIN_ and that the synthesized aba might be transported to the adjacent guard cell . these results further support the finding that _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ activity may be limiting for aba biosynthesis .
arabidopsis plants were grown at under light conditions and fully expanded rosette leaves were used for the bombardment experiments . broad bean cv . otafuku seeds that had been left in water overnight were sown and germinated at in a h light h dark regime . the leaves used for the bombardment were new and fully expanded third or newer leaves of to week old plants . for gene constructs for bombardment see supplementary fig . . the _METHOD_ cdna and the nopaline synthase transcription terminator _PROTEIN_ under promoter were inserted into the _METHOD_ vector in order to generate a _METHOD_ control construct . to form _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a ncoi restriction site was added in front of the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene by polymerase chain reaction and this fragment was cloned into a pgem t easy vector . the _PROTEIN_ gene of pgem t easy was sub cloned into the ncoi site of _METHOD_ . to yield _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into the pgem t easy vector . the fragment of the _PROTEIN_ cdna in the pgem t easy vector was transferred into the sphi ncoi site of pbluescript _METHOD_ nos _PROTEIN_ vector . a ncoi restriction site was added in front of the stop codon of the fragment of the _PROTEIN_ cdna by pcr and this fragment was cloned into the topo vector . subsequently the fragment of _PROTEIN_ was inserted into the ncoi site of pbluescript _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nos _PROTEIN_ . the promoter of _METHOD_ was inserted into the sali site of pbluescript _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nos _PROTEIN_ . gold particles coated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced with a particle gun _PROTEIN_ into broad bean leaves placed upside down on agar plates . the _PROTEIN_ efficiency of the _METHOD_ gene was checked . the greatest number of transformed guard cells per leaf was achieved at p.s.i . and cm distance between the gun and sample . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the broad bean guard cells was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . excitation and emission wavelengths for _METHOD_ were nm and nm respectively . chlorophyll self _METHOD_ was detected with a nm long pass filter . the leaves in which the genes had been inserted by the particle gun were floated back side down on stomatal opening solution in the light and cultured under no osmotic stress . the culture time was h for _METHOD_ h for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and h for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at which time the _PROTEIN_ was found to be the most efficient . after culturing epidermal peels were observed by _METHOD_ microscopy using a filter unit . images of stomata with relatively strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were recorded and the half aperture sizes of un transformed and transformed guard cells were measured .
