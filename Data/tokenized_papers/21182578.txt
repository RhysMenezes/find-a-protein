_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic proteins _PROTEIN_ are aquaporins that mediate water transport across the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the present work addresses using arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ as a model the _METHOD_ and significance of trafficking of newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . a functional diacidic export motif _PROTEIN_ was identified in the tail of _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis of mutants tagged with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . confocal _METHOD_ imaging and a novel _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching application based on the distinct diffusion of pm and intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed a retention in the _LOCATION_ of diacidic mutated _METHOD_ but with quantitative differences . thus the individual role of the two acidic _PROTEIN_ and residues was established . in addition _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs reduced the root hydraulic conductivity . of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs suggested that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may interact with other _PROTEIN_ to hamper their trafficking to the pm thereby contributing to inhibition of root cell hydraulic conductivity .
amino acid sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ predicts a potential diacidic motif dve at position in the tail . to address its trafficking _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the resulting construct was _PROTEIN_ constitutively in a. thaliana plants under the control of a double enhanced promoter . a series of mutations was conducted to investigate the role of the dve motif in the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . substitutions of _PROTEIN_ or/and by ala neutralize the dve diacidic motif to ave dva and ava sequences respectively . substitutions of _PROTEIN_ or by glu or asp respectively alter the primary amino acid sequence but _PROTEIN_ the diacidic properties of the sequence . in an attempt to check the _PROTEIN_ of constructs total proteins of transgenic plantlets were subjected to western blot analysis with an _METHOD_ antibody . the calculated molecular weight of the constructs is about kd . as shown in figure we detected a double band with apparent _METHOD_ of and kd that probably indicates a partial proteolysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . protein extraction performed in the absence of cocktail resulted in a severe degradation indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteolysis observed in western blots occurred at the protein extraction step . nevertheless in figure no free _METHOD_ was detected . this result suggested that confocal microscopy observations of _METHOD_ signals described _PROTEIN_ are associated with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a homogeneous signal located mostly at the periphery of the cell consistent with the expected localization of this construct at the pm . in marked contrast constructs with any mutation at _PROTEIN_ or/and positions showed a strong _METHOD_ of intracellular compartments _PROTEIN_ observed as a reticulated network in epidermal cells of roots and hypocotyls as well as leaves . we also noticed _METHOD_ labelling of fusiform bodies citation . such a reticulate network and fusiform body labelling have been extensively described and are associated with the _LOCATION_ compartment citation citation . _LOCATION_ dye was previously used as a selective marker for this compartment citation . we found that in the root epidermal cells the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and the _LOCATION_ dye showed only a partial colocalization whereas an extensive with the dye was observed for the whole set of diacidic mutants . of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs with _METHOD_ another marker of the _LOCATION_ citation were performed to confirm the nature of the compartment labelled by diacidic mutants of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . in root epidermal cells _METHOD_ labelled a perinuclear area and a reticulate network corresponding to the _LOCATION_ but also motile dots tentatively identified as _LOCATION_ apparatus . whereas the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct did not colocalize with _METHOD_ the whole set of diacidic mutant constructs showed an overlapping localization pattern . the possible localization of the diacidic mutant constructs in the _LOCATION_ apparatus was investigated by means of a _METHOD_ marker citation . observation of plants this and the diacidic mutant constructs revealed no _LOCATION_ colocalization . as _METHOD_ labels both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus whereas _METHOD_ specifically labels the _LOCATION_ apparatus mutant constructs appear to be strictly localized in the _LOCATION_ . similar results were also observed for epidermal leaf cells . in an attempt to estimate the ratio of diacidic mutant constructs between the intracellular compartments and the pm we made use of the _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching technique . using this technique it was demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ k channel the _PROTEIN_ h the _PROTEIN_ boric acid/borate exporter and the boric acid channel all tagged with _METHOD_ markers did not show any evidence for _PROTEIN_ movement or dispersion within the plane of the pm citation citation . similar to this we observed a low rate of _PROTEIN_ mobility for _METHOD_ constructs at the pm . interestingly _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs marking the _LOCATION_ allowed us to visualize the high mobility of this organelle citation citation . we therefore took advantage of this difference in mobility between _METHOD_ protein fusions in the pm and in the _LOCATION_ . a region of interest was identified in the tangential optical section of epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ wt or mutated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this roi was bleached and recovery of _METHOD_ was monitored after min . in cells _PROTEIN_ the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ recovery in the roi was almost not detectable in the roi . by contrast a more pronounced _METHOD_ recovery was observed in cells _PROTEIN_ diacidic mutant constructs . the ratio of _METHOD_ intensity of bleached roi to the neighbouring nonbleached region was used as an estimate of the relative intracellular labelling . comparison of the _METHOD_ intensity ratios showed that the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct had significantly lower values than its mutant counterparts . for instance ratio values of two independent lines were or higher than that of the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . of the _METHOD_ ratios of two lines only one was different from the control . the ratios of _METHOD_ of and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were similar and higher than the ratio of either or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . taken together these results suggested that independent and mutations provoked similar and marked intracellular retention of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs and also that the or mutants showed a lesser intracellular accumulation . this issue was addressed by using cycloheximide a protein synthesis inhibitor . as a positive control for the effect of cycloheximide we treated leaves of arabidopsis plantlets _PROTEIN_ an _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ citation citation . after h of cycloheximide treatment the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ in epidermal cells had almost completely vanished . by contrast the signal of the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct at the periphery of the epidermal cells previously identified as the pm compartment was not significantly reduced after either or h treatment . likewise the whole set of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ diacidic mutants did not show any _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ even after h of cycloheximide treatment . yet _LOCATION_ streaming was observed after such a long treatment suggesting that the cells were still viable . similar results were also observed in mature root epidermal cells . the peripheral or intracellular labelling observed with the wt or mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs after h of cycloheximide treatment suggested that wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are highly stable at the cell surface and in the _LOCATION_ respectively . data from the literature indicate possible interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during trafficking to the pm citation citation citation . as more than of the arabidopsis root hydraulic conductivity is mediated by _PROTEIN_ aquaporins citation citation any major localization faults of _PROTEIN_ should impact this parameter . this prompted us to study the effect of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs on root water transport . arabidopsis plants either untransformed or _PROTEIN_ wt or a mutated form of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were grown hydroponically and their lpr was determined by pressure chamber techniques . no significant difference in lpr was found between untransformed plants and plants _PROTEIN_ wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast plants _PROTEIN_ diacidic mutated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited lpr reduction when compared to that of the wt form . to investigate a possible physical interaction between _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs and endogenous _PROTEIN_ we studied the effect of these constructs on the trafficking of selected aquaporin _METHOD_ . for this we wt or diacidic mutant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed to colocalize with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ at the periphery of the cells . this subcellular localization was attributed to the pm . when with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized in intracellular compartments . this suggested that the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants induced the intracellular retention of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . next the specificity of these changes in subcellular localization pattern was checked in similar experiments with plants either wt or mutated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but with the tonoplastic aquaporin fused to mcherry . fusion to _METHOD_ proteins localizes to the tonoplast citation citation citation . a similar tonoplast localization was established for from peripheral staining of the cell with intracellular invaginations that skirted the _LOCATION_ . when was with wt or the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant the same localization was observed . in particular did not colocalize in perinuclear area with the mutant . to summarize this set of data suggested that the _PROTEIN_ of an _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct disturbed the trafficking to the pm of fusions of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ proteins .
