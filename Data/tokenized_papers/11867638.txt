transcription _PROTEIN_ are major regulators of cell proliferation and each _PROTEIN_ contributes differently to cell cycle control . arabidopsis contains six homologs of which three are proteins that exhibit an overall similarity to animal and interact with dpa and dpb to stimulate dna binding . here we describe the other three like proteins fromarabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which have two copies of a domain with a limited similarity only to the dna binding domain of . unlike known the three proteins failed to interact with dpa and dpb and could efficiently bind sites in a monomeric form through the dual type domain . transfection assays revealed that repress the transcription of reporter genes under the control of regulated promoters indicating that function to antagonize transactivation mediated by . when fused to green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ was detected in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . because the transcripts of were abundant in meristematic rather than fully differentiated tissues may balance the activities of and play a role in restraining cell proliferation .
thearabidopsis genome encodes three proteins that exhibit an overall similarity to animal proteins . surveying thearabidopsis genome sequence has revealed that the genome contains more three like genes exhibiting a limited similarity to . we isolated the cdna encoding the three like proteins designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr based on the open reading frames predicted from the genome sequence . the _PROTEIN_ cdnas encoded proteins with and amino acids respectively which exhibited and amino acid identity between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . strikingly homologous regions among these proteins and are homologous to the dna binding domain of animal and plant . the and domains of _PROTEIN_ share and identical amino acids respectively with the dna binding domain of human . no other region of the exhibited similarity to conserved domains of including the dimerization domain marked box and rb binding domain . the similarity of to the dna binding domain of suggests the ability of to bind dna . we analyzed the dna binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays _METHOD_ using recombinant thioredoxin proteins fused with and double stranded oligonucleotide probes containing sites . all the fusion proteins bound to a probe which contains an site present in the tobacco _PROTEIN_ promoter but not to an probe a mutant of . a probe which contains another class of binding site conserved among potential regulated genes in arabidopsis as well as the site also bound these proteins with a slightly _PROTEIN_ activity . the observed dna binding specificity of was the same as that of rice proteins and an complex . furthermore appeared to be efficient in binding dna at low concentrations suggesting no requirement of other _PROTEIN_ for the activity . to determine the role of the conserved domains of in dna binding we tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind dna by _METHOD_ using recombinant trx _PROTEIN_ proteins with a deletion . _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ mutant with a deletion of the c terminal amino acid residues retained the ability to bind the probe with no apparent loss of activity . incidentally the mobilities of these shifted bands were similar partly due to a c terminally fused portion derived from the vector sequence in the pet construct . when either the or domain was deleted from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a complete loss of the activity was observed . similarly the dna binding domain from _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis protein had no ability to bind the dna probe . the trx _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins did not bind to the probe even at a higher concentration . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ requires both and to bind the site . proteins interact with dp proteins to bind dna whereas appear to efficiently bind dna by _METHOD_ . to determine whether interact with dp proteins and the dna binding activity is affected by the interaction we first measured the activity of _PROTEIN_ for the interaction with arabidopsis dp proteins dpa and dpb by the yeast two hybrid assay . when _PROTEIN_ was used as prey it did not activate an lacz reporter gene by the coexpression of dpa and dpb used as bait indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts with neither dpa nor dpb . moreover the _PROTEIN_ constructs as prey and bait did not interact with each other indicating no ability to form a homodimer . in contrast _PROTEIN_ used as prey had the ability to interact with both dpa and dpb as demonstrated by high levels of galactosidase activity . but _PROTEIN_ as prey did not interact with _PROTEIN_ used as bait . similarly when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as prey no galactosidase activity was observed for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ used as bait indicating that _PROTEIN_ also can not interact with _PROTEIN_ . by _METHOD_ with in vitro translation products of _PROTEIN_ andarabidopsis and dps we next examined a possible change in the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ . an in vitro translation product of _PROTEIN_ efficiently bound to the probe whereas no other related proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited activity to bind the probe . cotranslation products of _PROTEIN_ exhibited neither changes in dna binding activity for _PROTEIN_ nor any newly shifted bands other than the original band of _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ formed a complex with dpa to bind the probe as shown by a low mobility shift band in the last lane this complex did not appear to cause a significant change in the high mobility band of _PROTEIN_ . it is noted that the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ complex roughly corresponds to a homodimeric form of _PROTEIN_ indicating that the high mobility band of the _PROTEIN_ complex is derived from the monomeric _PROTEIN_ bound to dna but not the dimeric protein . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ does not interact with dp and proteins and bind to dna in a monomeric form . to examine the transcriptional regulatory function of we carried out transfection assays by microprojectile bombardment of suspension cultured tobacco cells . reporter constructs containing the bacterial _PROTEIN_ gene fused with the tobacco or rice _PROTEIN_ promoter which contain functional sites exhibited a moderate gus _PROTEIN_ in transfected tobacco cells . when either _PROTEIN_ construct containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the promoter was transfected with the reporter gene the _PROTEIN_ of the reporter genes especially from the rice promoter was substantially _PROTEIN_ although _PROTEIN_ did not affect the tobacco promoter . in contrast the promoter or its truncated core promoter was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ of . a rice _PROTEIN_ promoter truncated to which retained the site was also repressed to an extent comparable to the full length promoter by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the repression is mediated by the site . these reporter constructs were transactivated by coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and dpa . _PROTEIN_ of either protein antagonized the transactivation . _PROTEIN_ appeared to have the greatest ability to repress the promoter activated by exogenously _PROTEIN_ as well as by endogenous _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the proteins act as repressors of regulated promoters probably by competing for sites . we then examined the subcellular localization of using proteins fused with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . when the fusion proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in cultured tobacco cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ although _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . the incomplete _LOCATION_ localization correlate with a less effective repression of the _PROTEIN_ promoters compared with _PROTEIN_ and as shown in fig . . in contrast _METHOD_ fused with the bacterial _PROTEIN_ which is a cytoplasmic protein in plant cells was detected _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . these results suggest that the proteins are _LOCATION_ and carry an intrinsic _LOCATION_ localization signal . consistently there is a potential bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signal in the c terminal region which is conserved in all the proteins . finally we performed rt pcr analysis to examine the cell specificity of the accumulation of transcripts . first strand cdnas were synthesized with total rna extracted from mature leaves at a stage before flower initiation young immature leaves containing leaf primordia and _METHOD_ young developing stalks located under immature inflorescence mature grown stalks _METHOD_ young developing flower buds and mature open flowers . cdna synthesis was assessed by rt pcr with primers specific for the s rrna gene . rt pcr analysis using primer sets specific for the cdnas showed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was abundant in young developing organs and tissues such as the meristematic leaves young stalks and immature flower buds whereas it was less common in mature organs such as adult leaves and stalks as shown by the amplified fragments . similar patterns were observed for the accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts indicating that the three transcripts are preferentially _PROTEIN_ in growing tissues . unlike the _PROTEIN_ transcript however the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were less _PROTEIN_ at the developing stages in stalk and abundant at both stages of flower development indicating that both the _PROTEIN_ genes are regulated in a manner different from gene .
