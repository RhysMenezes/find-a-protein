formins actin nucleating proteins that stimulate the de novo polymerization of actin filaments are important for diverse cellular and developmental processes especially those dependent on _PROTEIN_ establishment . a subset of plant formins referred to as group i is distinct from formins from other species in having evolved a unique n terminal structure with a signal peptide a pro rich potentially glycosylated _LOCATION_ domain and a transmembrane domain . we show here that overexpression of the arabidopsis formin _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes induces the formation of arrays of actin cables that project into the cytoplasm from the cell _LOCATION_ and that its n terminal structure targets _PROTEIN_ to the cell _LOCATION_ . pollen tube elongation is a _PROTEIN_ cell growth process dependent on an active and tightly regulated actin _LOCATION_ . slight increases in _PROTEIN_ stimulate growth but its overexpression induces tube broadening growth depolarization and growth arrest in transformed pollen tubes . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulated actin polymerization is important for the _PROTEIN_ pollen cell growth process . moreover severe _LOCATION_ deformation was observed in the apical region of tip expanded _PROTEIN_ overexpressing pollen tubes in which an abundance of _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ associated actin cables was evident . these observations suggest that regulated _PROTEIN_ activity at the cell surface is important for _PROTEIN_ tip focused cell _LOCATION_ expansion for the _PROTEIN_ extension of pollen tubes . the cell surface located group i formins may play the integrin analogous role as mediators of external stimuli to the actin _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ could be important for mediating _LOCATION_ signals from female tissues to elicit the proper pollen tube growth response during pollination .
the promoter of the ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was active in elongating pollen tubes and full length _PROTEIN_ cdnas were recovered readily by reverse transcriptase mediated pcr from arabidopsis pollen mrna suggesting the relative prevalence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the male gametophyte . the _PROTEIN_ domain in _PROTEIN_ is similar to the same domain in formins from yeast and human . its _PROTEIN_ domain is similar to other formins in being pro rich including a stretch of nine pro residues . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains in _PROTEIN_ are similar to their analogous domains in yeast formins in stimulating actin cable formation the _PROTEIN_ n terminal half deleted mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in transformed tobacco pollen tubes . because a functional green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ labeled actin protein is not available for imaging the actin _LOCATION_ in live plant cells the pollen tube actin _LOCATION_ was imaged by cotransformation with one of two actin binding protein genes the pollen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mtalin and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ mtalin typically reveals an extensive array of long actin cables in the tube shank that terminate in the subapical region . _METHOD_ most prominently decorates a subapical actin mesh and when _PROTEIN_ level is higher also binds to long actin cables in the shank . _METHOD_ has little effect on pollen tube growth when _PROTEIN_ at moderate levels and serves as a good alternative actin marker to _METHOD_ mtalin for which the pollen tube actin _LOCATION_ and growth have less tolerance . both _METHOD_ mtalin and _METHOD_ revealed increased levels of actin cables in pollen tubes that coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the supernumerary actin cables were especially evident in the apical and subapical regions . control pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ either of the actin marker proteins never displayed actin _LOCATION_ phenotypes like those induced by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the number of actin cables seen in single optical sections of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing tubes was to times to > times that observed in control actin marker _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also induced growth related phenotypes in the form of tube broadening tip expansion and ultimately growth arrest indicating that regulated formin activity is important for the _PROTEIN_ cell growth process . overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains of yeast formins also resulted in defects in _PROTEIN_ increased levels of actin cables and growth arrest . therefore our observations in pollen tubes suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is functionally analogous to its counterparts in yeast formins . moreover the _PROTEIN_ domain alone was considerably less active than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in stimulating actin cable formation . this finding suggests that the _PROTEIN_ domain positively regulates the activity of _PROTEIN_ probably via interactions with endogenous profilin similar to what has been observed for the yeast formins . an actin cable inducing activity coupled with cell _LOCATION_ localization would have significant implications for the biological role of _PROTEIN_ . to explore this possibility the coding regions for full length _PROTEIN_ its variable domain deleted mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal half deleted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were fused at their c termini with _METHOD_ . transformed pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins showed strong green _METHOD_ signals along the cell surface . by contrast pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ the n terminal half deleted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed an even distribution of green _METHOD_ throughout the transformed tube consistent with its being a _LOCATION_ protein . together these observations indicate that the n terminal region preceding the variable domain is necessary to target _PROTEIN_ to the secretory pathway and localize it to the cell _LOCATION_ . these _METHOD_ fusion proteins were biologically active and induced tube broadening tip expansion and other defects as did their nontagged counterparts . moreover the degree of induced tube broadening correlated with the _METHOD_ levels in the transformed cells suggesting a correlation between _PROTEIN_ levels from the transgenes and the induced pollen tube phenotype . to determine if _PROTEIN_ induces actin cables from the cell _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the variable domain deleted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed in pollen tubes . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced an abundance of _METHOD_ labeled or _METHOD_ mtalin labeled actin along the periphery of cotransformed pollen tubes . when images from the entire tube were projected _LOCATION_ actin cables often were more randomly organized or they were not as evident as in control tubes but their presence was evident in single optical sections . serial optical sectioning of pollen tubes cotransformed by the actin marker genes in particular _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed striking arrays of punctate actin structures . the punctate actin structures in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing pollen tubes were detected first in tangential sections across the lower surface of these tubes . they appeared to extend to from the cell _LOCATION_ because they faded as imaging approached the internal cytoplasm . they reappeared as imaging reached the top surface of these tubes . these punctate structures most likely represented actin cables that project from the cell _LOCATION_ into the cytoplasm almost perpendicular to the long axis of the tube . in some tubes the _METHOD_ labeled punctate actin structures remained obvious along the cell periphery even in the median sections . in others short actin cables could be seen from the cell periphery projecting into the cytoplasm in sections that were farther from the tube surface . similar tube surface associated punctate structures were not observed in control pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ only the actin marker proteins or along with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ stimulates the assembly of actin filaments from the cell _LOCATION_ and that its n terminal extension is necessary to target this protein to the pollen tube cell surface . as is evident from the images shown in figures to a majority of transformed pollen tubes that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ its mutant variants or their _METHOD_ tagged counterparts developed a broader shank . some especially those in which supernumerary cables were evident developed a ballooned tip . when individual pollen tubes were examined those with a broader girth usually were growth retarded relative to control tubes and those with a ballooned tip were growth arrested . however cumulative growth over a period of time among populations of pollen tubes transformed by increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ revealed that low levels of transgene input actually stimulated growth especially during the early hours after germination . when pollen tubes were transformed by < of _PROTEIN_ the pollen tube morphology and observable actin _LOCATION_ structure remained comparable to those in control pollen tubes transformed only by an actin marker gene . many of them especially those cotransformed by or of _PROTEIN_ were longer than pollen tubes in control cultures . when examined individually many of them elongated at rates slightly higher than in control tubes . pollen tubes transformed by or of _PROTEIN_ began to show the growth inhibitory effect of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ toward to h after culturing . although supernumerary actin cables were not yet evident in most of these tubes tip _LOCATION_ associated actin filaments became prevalent in some and these tubes elongated at rates slower than that in control tubes when monitored individually . in some images the tip arisen actin cables were intimately linked to the actin cables in the subapical region . although some individuals among pollen tubes transformed by or of _PROTEIN_ began to show _PROTEIN_ induced actin _LOCATION_ and morphological defects as early as to h after culturing the cumulative growth among these transformed tubes was reduced only moderately even over more prolonged culturing times . by h after culturing most of these tubes had developed supernumerary actin cables ballooned and were growth arrested . therefore it is likely that growth stimulation by low levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the input transgene had occurred during the initial hours of growth possibly even before to h after culturing when marker gene _PROTEIN_ was still too low for the detection of these transformed tubes . growth then was inhibited during the _PROTEIN_ hours when _PROTEIN_ levels became too high for normal _PROTEIN_ tube growth to continue . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes often showed uneven edges along the pollen tube apical zone as did many of the transformed pollen tubes overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an actin marker protein . the surface undulations seen in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tubes which were not observed in any control pollen tubes already suggested cell _LOCATION_ deformation . to confirm this _METHOD_ labeled cell _LOCATION_ proteins _METHOD_ were coexpressed with unlabeled _PROTEIN_ to mark the pollen tube _LOCATION_ . the normal cell _LOCATION_ labeling pattern and the tip concentration of green _METHOD_ were obliterated in these tubes . instead severe cell surface invaginations occurred often with large _PROTEIN_ observed in tangential sections across the bottom of the tube and uneven edges in midplane images . in actin marker protein and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coexpressing pollen tubes the accumulation of actin cables was evident along the convoluted cell periphery . only mild _LOCATION_ deformation was observed and that very rarely among pollen tubes overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with _LOCATION_ associated actin cable assembly being a contributing _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ invagination observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing tubes .
