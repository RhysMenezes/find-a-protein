in a recent bioinformatic analysis we predicted the presence of multiple families of cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins in arabidopsis . a number of publications have since demonstrated the importance of predicted gaps in diverse physiological processes including root development cell wall integrity and adhesion . however direct experimental evidence for their gpi anchoring is mostly lacking . here we present the first to our knowledge large scale proteomic identification of plant gaps . triton x phase partitioning and sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase c were used to prepare gap rich fractions from arabidopsis callus cells . two dimensional _METHOD_ difference gel electrophoresis and one dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the existence of a large number of phospholipase c sensitive arabidopsis proteins . using liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gaps were identified including six _PROTEIN_ five phytocyanins four fasciclin like arabinogalactan proteins four receptor like proteins two hedgehog interacting like proteins two putative glycerophosphodiesterases a lipid transfer like protein a _PROTEIN_ like protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results validate our previous bioinformatic analysis of the arabidopsis protein database . using the confirmed gaps from the proteomic analysis to train the search algorithm as well as improved genomic annotation an updated in silico screen yielded new candidates raising the total to predicted gaps in arabidopsis .
in our previous genomic analysis of arabidopsis we identified more than protein families comprising putative gaps . to validate these predictions a proteomics approach was taken to identify bona fide gaps . treatment with pi plc in conjunction with triton x detergent phase partitioning is an established method to determine gpi anchoring of proteins . it relies on the partitioning of _LOCATION_ proteins based on their hydrophobicities in a two phase system . gaps can be identified by a characteristic shift from the hydrophobic detergent rich phase to the hydrophilic aqueous phase upon cleavage of the gpi anchor with pi plc . using this method gaps were prepared from arabidopsis callus _LOCATION_ . to identify any abundant non gaps that contaminate the gap rich aqueous phase a control experiment was performed . preparations of gaps were first analyzed by dige . the pi plc treated and control aqueous phases were labeled with different _METHOD_ cydyes and pooled before isoelectric focusing and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a single gel . proteins were detected with a dual channel _METHOD_ scanner . this revealed the presence of many proteins specifically enriched in the pi plc treated fraction and some background proteins present in both fractions . because the samples were separated in a single gel dige allowed unambiguous matching of spots and thus demonstrated a clear distinction between these two populations . the large number of pi plc sensitive proteins is in agreement with the results obtained by sherrier et al . . proteins clearly enriched in the pi plc treated fraction were excised digested with trypsin and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . eleven proteins were identified . analysis of their predicted protein sequences indicated that they all have the structural components necessary for gpi anchoring and that eight were predicted by borner et al . . thus the preparation and analysis method allowed identification of gaps from arabidopsis . confirmed gpi anchored proteins from arabidopsis callus proteins were separated by two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . proteins sensitive to pi plc were identified by lc _METHOD_ . letters indicate experiments that yielded identification of a protein . uppercase letters indicate identifications with greater than confidence based on mascot scores . the most likely cleavage sites are indicated . the hydrophobic domain of each c terminal signal peptide is underlined . confirmations have been submitted to the munich information center for protein sequences . the most abundant pi plc sensitive proteins focused in a narrow ph range . to increase the resolution in this area of the gel gaps were analyzed by dige using a zoom strip during ief . the spot pattern obtained was comparable with the one observed with a broader ph range but revealed numerous previously merged or undetectable proteins . as before pi plc sensitive proteins were excised digested with trypsin and subjected to lc _METHOD_ . in addition to confirming several of the previous identifications one further gap _PROTEIN_ was identified . several of the protein spots were of too low abundance to yield sufficient peptides for lc _METHOD_ analysis . cydye labeling is a highly sensitive detection method and allows visualization of very low protein quantities . to identify further pi plc sensitive proteins that were not recovered from gels preparations of gaps were analyzed by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . pi plc treated and untreated fractions were separated in parallel lanes in the same gel . proteins were stained with _METHOD_ blue . bands clearly enriched in the pi plc treated fraction were excised digested with trypsin and the peptides were subjected to lc _METHOD_ . to identify proteins not visible with _METHOD_ blue both treated and control lanes were excised completely cut into sections digested with trypsin and peptides analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . twenty three arabidopsis gaps were found specifically enriched in the pi plc treated fraction . only one protein that has a sequence not predicted to confer gpi anchoring copartitioned with the gaps . the proteomic analysis identified proteins in total that were sensitive to pi plc and have sequence features expected of gaps indicating that they are gpi anchored . furthermore of them had been predicted in the genomic analysis . eight of the novel gaps were not correctly annotated in the protein database used by borner et al . therefore it was not possible to predict them at that time . the ninth has a charge in the c terminal signal peptide . however all the novel gaps belong to the families previously predicted . because the first genomic prediction was very effective but limited by apparently incomplete or incorrect annotation of the genome in august the mips arabidopsis data set was analyzed according to borner et al . . of the proteins in the database gaps were predicted including new candidates . one hundred eighty four proteins described in the previous analysis were confirmed whereas were no longer predicted to become gpi anchored in their present annotation . candidate gaps were sorted into families based on sequence similarity to known proteins . a single new protein family consisting of three pectate lyases not correctly annotated in the august database was added to the previously described list . unknown and hypothetical proteins were also grouped on the basis of sequence similarity . the results are summarized in table ii . predicted and confirmed gpi anchored proteins in arabidopsis confirmed gpi anchored proteins are marked by superscript nos . . bold indicates the presence of probable _PROTEIN_ glycomodules . entries in parentheses are candidates that have weak predictions for n or c terminal peptides . families of homologous unknown/hypothetical proteins are separated by semicolons . predictions have been submitted to mips . the new set of predictions included of the gaps confirmed by proteomic methods . the two missing proteins _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ have all the structural hallmarks of gaps but are unusual in that they have very hydrophilic or charged residues in their hydrophobic c termini . to investigate the possible occurrence of further such gaps in arabidopsis we modified the c terminal hydrophobic segment requirements of our search algorithm _PROTEIN_ . the algorithm was permitted to ignore two hydrophilic or charged residues while the minimum summed hydrophobicity was significantly increased . we trained this new version of _PROTEIN_ on the set of confirmed arabidopsis gaps shown in table i . analysis of the mips protein database resulted in the identification of nine novel candidate gaps . in addition to the two unusual confirmed gaps from the proteomic analysis these included a classical _PROTEIN_ a phytocyanin a further _PROTEIN_ and a gapep all strong candidates for gpi anchoring . the new sequences were added to table ii resulting in a total of predicted or confirmed arabidopsis gaps . the gap predictions and confirmations are available at mips . one of the most unexpected predictions of borner et al . was that of gaps have pro rich _PROTEIN_ type glycosylation modules . in the updated analysis we still predict that of gaps have putative _PROTEIN_ glycomodules of which only are classical _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ peptides .
the annotated arabidopsis protein database was retrieved from mips http //mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html . where necessary gene entries from mips were re annotated using genbank ests or cdna information found in mips . bioinformatic analysis of the arabidopsis protein database was carried out as described by borner et al . . in brief our own algorithm _PROTEIN_ was used to generate a list
