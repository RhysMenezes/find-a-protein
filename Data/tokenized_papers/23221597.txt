in yeast and animals sm like proteins typically exist as heptameric complexes and are involved in different aspects of rna metabolism . eight lsm proteins to are highly conserved and form two distinct heteroheptameric complexes and _PROTEIN_ that function in mrna decay and splicing respectively . a search of the arabidopsis thaliana genome identifies genes encoding proteins related to the eight conserved _METHOD_ the genes encoding the putative and proteins being duplicated . here we report the molecular and functional characterization of the arabidopsis lsm gene family . our results show that the lsm genes are active and encode proteins that are also organized in two different heptameric complexes . the complex is cytoplasmic and is involved in p body formation and mrna decay by promoting decapping . the _PROTEIN_ complex is _LOCATION_ and is required for precursor mrna splicing through small _LOCATION_ rna stabilization . more importantly our results also reveal that these complexes are essential for the correct turnover and splicing of selected development related mrnas and for the normal development of arabidopsis . we propose that _METHOD_ play a critical role in arabidopsis development by ensuring the appropriate development related gene _PROTEIN_ through the regulation of mrna splicing and decay .
sequence comparisons and motif searches allowed the identification of genes in the arabidopsis genome encoding proteins related to the eight highly conserved proteins that in yeast and animals constitute the heptameric lsm complexes and _PROTEIN_ with three of them the putative and being duplicated . the predicted arabidopsis proteins contain the and motifs that are separated by a nonconserved linker region of variable length and conform the sm bipartite domain typical of lsm proteins . lsm proteins have also been found in the genomes of different plant species . a phylogenetic analysis was performed with the lsm proteins from arabidopsis and other representative plant species including soybean poplar rice and maize . results revealed that all plant genomes analyzed contain genes encoding _METHOD_ related to the eight conserved proteins from yeast and animals and that many of them are present in more than one copy as in the case of arabidopsis and . the human lsm proteins were also included in the analysis as an internal control . rna gel blot analysis revealed that the arabidopsis lsm genes are _PROTEIN_ in all organs tested including leaves roots flowers and _METHOD_ . each pair of duplicated genes exhibited the same _PROTEIN_ pattern . to determine the _PROTEIN_ of lsm genes at the tissue level transgenic arabidopsis plants containing fusions between all lsm promoters and the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene were generated and assayed for gus activity . consistent with the results obtained from the rna gel blot experiments nearly constitutive gus activity was observed in all cases . in leaves and cotyledons gus staining was preferentially detected in the vascular tissues . as representative examples the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus is shown . these results demonstrate that the arabidopsis lsm genes are active and ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the subcellular localization of arabidopsis lsm proteins transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genomic lsm green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions driven by the corresponding lsmpro were obtained and analyzed . we first examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis putative homologs of yeast and animal lsm proteins that differentiate the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ complexes respectively . in root cells from seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ suggested a cytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . conversely in seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion green _METHOD_ was specifically localized in _LOCATION_ . we also investigated the subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose related yeast and animal proteins participate in both cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ lsm complexes . in root cells from seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ was detected in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins simultaneously localize to these subcellular compartments . similar results were obtained when studying the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these data strongly suggest that arabidopsis lsm proteins have subcellular localizations similar to the lsm proteins from other eukaryotes . yeast and human proteins have been described to accumulate in p bodies . we therefore examined whether arabidopsis lsm proteins belonging to the cytoplasmic complex also localized in these cytoplasmic foci . p bodies are rarely observed in plants growing under control conditions whereas their number and size markedly increase under conditions that are associated with high levels of mrna turnover such as hypoxic or heat stress . when seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were exposed to heat stress _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were largely localized to discrete cytoplasmic spots . under heat stress conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins also localized to cytoplasmic foci in root cells from seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . following cycloheximide treatment which in yeast and humans results in the loss of p bodies no cytoplasmic foci were observed in any case suggesting that the detected cytoplasmic spots of lsm _METHOD_ fusion proteins corresponded to p bodies . consistent with its specific _LOCATION_ localization _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not accumulate in cytoplasmic spots in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings exposed to heat stress or to heat stress plus cycloheximide . to confirm that the foci defined by arabidopsis cytoplasmic lsm proteins corresponded to p bodies we further analyzed their colocalization with _PROTEIN_ a protein that belongs to the arabidopsis decapping complex and accumulates in p bodies . the examination of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cotransformed with a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion revealed that in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root cells grown at room temperature or exposed to . taken together these observations demonstrate that arabidopsis cytoplasmic lsm proteins accumulate in p bodies . _PROTEIN_ and varicose _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ also belong to the arabidopsis decapping complex and accumulate in p bodies . accordingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins localized to p bodies within the cytoplasm of root cells from wild type seedlings containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs respectively exposed to heat stress . when these constructs were introduced into an arabidopsis mutant defective in proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the same stress conditions the p bodies were lost and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were mostly dispersed in the _LOCATION_ . from these results we conclude that in addition to accumulating in p bodies proteins are required for p body formation in arabidopsis . as mentioned above yeast and animal lsm proteins typically exist as highly organized _PROTEIN_ shaped heptameric complexes . having established that arabidopsis lsm proteins subcellularly localize as in other eukaryotes we decided to study how they are organized . for this we assayed in vivo lsm lsm interactions by means of bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . in yeast and animal lsm complexes and _PROTEIN_ are flanked by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our experiments revealed that a significant proportion of cells cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed green _METHOD_ . identical results were obtained cotransforming _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are capable of interacting in vivo with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the typical cytoplasmic localization of proteins in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interactions _PROTEIN_ appeared in the cytoplasm of the n. benthamiana cells . conversely interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were essentially detected in the _LOCATION_ which is consistent with the characteristic _LOCATION_ localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . the specificity of all these interactions was demonstrated by the _PROTEIN_ that as expected from their different subcellular localization we did not observe interaction between proteins and _PROTEIN_ . interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were not found either in agreement with what has been proposed for yeast and animal lsm complexes . however we detected interactions between _PROTEIN_ and and and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these interactions parallel those proposed for lsm complexes from other eukaryotes and were observed simultaneously in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ consistent with the subcellular localization of the corresponding _METHOD_ . in addition also according to the interactions assumed in other lsm complexes we did not detect interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and . all of these data indicate that arabidopsis _METHOD_ are organized in two heptameric _PROTEIN_ complexes localized in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . in yeast and animals cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ lsm complexes are determined by the presence of and _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively . the occurrence of a similar structural requirement in arabidopsis complexes was examined by analyzing the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ a protein marker of both arabidopsis cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ lsm complexes in plants deficient in and _PROTEIN_ proteins . as described above in root cells from arabidopsis seedlings containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was simultaneously detected in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . interestingly however in mutant seedlings for and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bearing the same construct the fusion protein preferentially localized in _LOCATION_ or cytoplasm respectively . these observations strongly support the notion that and _PROTEIN_ proteins are essential for the formation of the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ lsm complexes respectively in arabidopsis . the results described above indicated that arabidopsis _METHOD_ are also organized in cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ complexes determined by the presence of and _PROTEIN_ and suggested similar functions as the complexes from yeast and animals . to test this assumption we first searched for t dna insertion mutants in and _PROTEIN_ genes . plants containing single t dna insertions located in the fourth exon of _PROTEIN_ or in the second intron of _PROTEIN_ were identified . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mrnas were undetectable in plants homozygous for the insertions revealing that these new _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were null or highly hypomorphic . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants did not present any obvious morphological or developmental abnormality being indistinguishable from their corresponding wild type plants nossen and columbia ecotypes respectively . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical they might be functionally redundant which would explain the wild type phenotypes exhibited by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants . therefore we decided to obtain the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant that was subsequently backcrossed four times with col to have both mutations within this genetic background . as expected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not accumulate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas . remarkably in contrast with single mutants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed severe developmental alterations . seed germination in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was delayed compared with the wild type and disturbed producing epinastic chlorotic and small cotyledons . cotyledonary veins were disorganized with disruptions preventing the formation of closed loops as in wild type veins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rosette and cauline leaves were smaller than wild type leaves more serrated and presented an abnormal venation phenotype and smaller petioles . the root system was also altered in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with the root length and the number of secondary roots being reduced . on the other hand the elongation of primary and secondary inflorescences ceased prematurely in the double mutant altering plant architecture and given rise dwarf plants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants flowered earlier than wild type plants under both long and short day photoperiods though this phenotype was much more pronounced under noninductive photoperiodic conditions . finally mutant plants produced few siliques that were shorter and contained less seeds than those of wild type plants . moreover these seeds were small and frequently presented morphological alterations . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were rescued for all of the above phenotypes confirming that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in _PROTEIN_ functionally redundant and that the mutant phenotypes displayed by the double mutant were due to the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition two transgenic lines were identified that contained single t dna insertions located in the fifth exon of _PROTEIN_ . in homozygous plants for the insertions _PROTEIN_ mrna was undetectable indicating that these new _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were null or highly hypomorphic . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants also exhibited developmental defects . both of them showed the same phenotypes but they were more pronounced in _PROTEIN_ . seeds from _PROTEIN_ mutants germinated as wild type seeds although a significant percentage of mutant seedlings exhibited alterations in the shape and number of their cotyledons and veins formed more closed loops in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type cotyledons . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves had short petioles and were smaller and flatter than wild type leaves but their vasculature and margins were normal . _PROTEIN_ the radicular system the root length and the number of secondary roots were reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type . the length of primary and secondary inflorescences was not affected in the mutants . nonetheless they flowered significantly earlier than wild type plants under short day photoperiods . although the number of siliques produced in _PROTEIN_ mutants was as in the wild type they were shorter and contained fewer seeds that frequently aborted . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants transformed with the construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited wild type phenotypes confirming that their mutant phenotypes were due to the lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . altogether these data provide direct evidence that and _PROTEIN_ proteins are required to ensure correct developmental transitions in arabidopsis from germination to flowering and also in seed formation . the possibility that the arabidopsis cytoplasmic complex functions in mrna degradation as described in yeast and animals was tested by analyzing the decay rates of several mrnas that have been reported to be unstable transcripts such as expansin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ortholog of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ jasmonate _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nitrate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and related to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . as a control we also analyzed the turnover of eukaryotic traslation initiation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna which is considered a stable transcript . decay rates were assayed by comparing relative levels of mrnas following cordycepin induced transcriptional arrest . our results confirmed the instability of the former mrnas and the stability of the latter in the wild type . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ however the steady state levels of all unstable transcripts analyzed were higher than in wild type plants and their rates of decay clearly reduced their estimated half lives being at least two times longer . as expected the steady state levels and the decay rate of _PROTEIN_ rna were similar in mutant and wild type plants . the analysis of the stability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in c _PROTEIN_ and c _PROTEIN_ plants confirmed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant and demonstrated that the increased mrna stability noticed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was caused by the simultaneous absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the stability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . as presumed all mrnas showed similar turnover in cordycepin treated wild type and mutant plants confirming again the functional redundancy of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and establishing that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex does not play a role in cytoplasmic mrna degradation . we next assessed whether the reduction of mrna decay observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be due to a deficiency in its mrna decapping capacity . for this rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ pcr that allows detection of capped _METHOD_ of specific mrnas was used . pcr experiments with low and high number of cycles were performed . in both cases we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas accumulated in their capped form in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . these effects were corrected by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenes in c _PROTEIN_ and c _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . the capped _METHOD_ of mrnas corresponding to the above genes were found not to be changed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results indicated that the arabidopsis complex operates in cytoplasmic mrna degradation by promoting decapping . in yeast and animals the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex acts in pre mrna splicing by stabilizing the spliceosomal snrna . to determine whether the arabidopsis lsm _LOCATION_ complex has a similar function we first analyzed the effects of _PROTEIN_ on pre mrna splicing at the genome wide level using tiling arrays and total rnas from wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . two week old plants were selected for these experiments as they represent an intermediate stage of development . we searched for introns with significantly higher hybridization signals in mutant than in wild type plants . thus we identified introns belonging to genes with increased hybridization signals in _PROTEIN_ . the increased hybridization signals detected in _PROTEIN_ should reflect intron retention since hybridization signals in other introns and exons of the genes did not differ between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . these results were validated by rt pcr for a subset of genes appertaining to different ontology categories including protein metabolism _PROTEIN_ intracellular transport _PROTEIN_ developmental processes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or signal transduction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . however the intron retention events in these genes were not detected in c _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants confirming that the splicing defects unveiled in _PROTEIN_ mutants were specifically due to the loss of _PROTEIN_ function and that the arabidopsis cytoplasmic complex is not involved in pre mrna splicing . as a control tiling array data were also validated by analyzing the retention of an intron of actin related _PROTEIN_ a gene that did not display any intron retention event in the array in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . as expected the intron was not retained in these plants . next we investigated the possible role of the arabidopsis lsm _LOCATION_ complex in snrna stability by assessing the levels of this snrna in cordycepin treated _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants . results revealed that the steady state levels of snrna were lower in mutants than in wild type plants and that after cordycepin treatment these levels were _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants but _PROTEIN_ rapidly in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . therefore the stability of snrna is dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ and consequently on the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on snrna stability _METHOD_ to be highly specific since the levels of small nucleolar rna which is transcribed by rna polymerase iii like the snrna and snrna which is synthesized by rna polymerase ii did not _PROTEIN_ in cordycepin treated _PROTEIN_ mutants . as expected c _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants showed similar levels of snrna snorna and snrna as the wild type before and after cordycepin treatment . therefore it was concluded that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex is essential for accurate splicing of selected mrnas through the stabilization of the spliceosomal snrna . in an attempt to understand the function of lsm complexes in arabidopsis development we studied the global impact of and _PROTEIN_ mutations on gene _PROTEIN_ . the comparison of mrna profiles from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the wild type was performed using agilent arabidopsis oligo microarrays and total rnas extracted from week old plants . transcript levels of genes were found to be higher by at least twofold in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . on the other hand transcripts corresponding to genes were reduced by more than twofold in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . gene ontology analysis of deregulated genes in the double mutant unveiled that of them were implicated in developmental processes including seed germination root and leaf development inflorescence development flowering and embryogenesis which is consistent with its severe mutant phenotype . the microarray data were validated confirming the altered _PROTEIN_ of several overexpressed and underexpressed genes related to different developmental processes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants by quantitative rt pcr . on the other hand c _PROTEIN_ and c _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited wild type _PROTEIN_ patterns for all validated genes demonstrating that the cytoplasmic complex is required for the accurate _PROTEIN_ of development related genes in arabidopsis . since the arabidopsis lsm cytoplasmic complex functions in mrna degradation by promoting decapping the high levels of some development related mrnas detected in the absence of proteins might be due to a selective stabilization of the corresponding transcripts as a result of the retention of their cap . this possibility was first examined by measuring the degradation rates of five development related mrnas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whose levels were elevated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant in cordycepin treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly the decay of all transcripts except _PROTEIN_ was significantly slower in the mutant than in wild type plants . in addition all transcripts but not _PROTEIN_ retained their cap in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ providing evidence that in _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis cytoplasmic complex is essential for correct developmental gene _PROTEIN_ by regulating the decapping and therefore the stabilization of specific development related transcripts . accordingly the degradation rates and cap levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in c _PROTEIN_ and c _PROTEIN_ plants were as in the wild type . the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutations on gene _PROTEIN_ at a genome wide level was determined analyzing the above mentioned tiling arrays which in addition to allowing splicing analysis constitute a robust platform for detection of transcriptional activity . compared with the wild type and annotated genes were found to be at least twofold up and downregulated respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . gene ontology categorization of these deregulated genes revealed that a considerable number were related to developmental processes throughout the arabidopsis life cycle which could explain the mutant phenotypes exhibited by _PROTEIN_ mutants . microarray results were validated by assaying the _PROTEIN_ of a group of deregulated genes implicated in different developmental processes in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and c _PROTEIN_ plants by quantitative rt pcr . these data demonstrated that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex is also crucial for appropriate development related gene _PROTEIN_ . considering that the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex regulates development related gene _PROTEIN_ and functions in pre mrna splicing it was presumed that a number of genes involved in development might display splicing defects . remarkably out of the genes that showed intron retention events were found to be related to different developmental processes . the inefficient splicing of some of these genes including abnormal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ embryo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ embryo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by rt pcr analysis with appropriate primers . as expected the splicing of other developmental related genes such as aintegumenta _PROTEIN_ was not affected . these findings indicate that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex ensures the accurate splicing of specific development related mrnas allowing correct developmental gene _PROTEIN_ .
