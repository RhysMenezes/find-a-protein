analyzing highly hydrophobic proteins is a _PROTEIN_ for identification protocols based on gel separation and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we combined blue native and tricine gel electrophoresis to allow separation and identification of respiratory complex subunits from arabidopsis mitochondria . we identified many of the highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ encoded subunits _PROTEIN_ and also found a number of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins associated with complex i for the first time in plants .
separation of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein complexes by bn _PROTEIN_ allows the resolution of intact electron transport chain complexes based on their apparent molecular _METHOD_ . a subsequent second dimension using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ facilitates separation and analysis of the subunits composition of each complex.citation a separation of arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins by bn _PROTEIN_ reveals several complexes . the identification of the three abundant high molecular _METHOD_ complexes was confirmed by analysis of in gel trypsin digestions of each by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the largest complex correspond to the nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i. eighteen bands are detected in the second dimension _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the second major complex corresponds to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ synthase which separates into visible bands on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the third major complex is the ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase which resolves into bands on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to further resolve these complexes mitochondrial extracts were again separated by bn _PROTEIN_ and the bands corresponding to complexes i v and iii were excised . after denaturation the proteins present in these bands were then separated on diagonal gels as describe by rais et al.citation these bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ gels further separated the subunits of complexes i iii and v and in each case we visualized more spots than were apparent on bn/sds _PROTEIN_ . a total of spots were observed on bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ of complex i compared to only distinguishable bands in our bn/sds _PROTEIN_ previous reports have resolved bands from potato complex i on bn/sds _PROTEIN_ the spots from arabidopsis complex i were excised from the gel digested by trypsin and analyzed by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we identified different proteins which represented different complex i subunits and included seven of the nine mitochondrial encoded subunits and _LOCATION_ encoded subunits . five of the highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ encoded subunits were identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the annotation of complex i components in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ and mitochondria genomes has been undertaken by homology searches to known complex i components in other _METHOD_ a significant number of them were previously identified in analysis of complex i preparations separated by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ here we have confirmed these and also provide experimental evidence for the presence of a number of subunits annotated by homology as complex i subunits but not directly identified by heazlewood et al.citation these were the _LOCATION_ encoded subunits and and the _LOCATION_ encoded proteins homologous to _PROTEIN_ subunit _PROTEIN_ subunit ashi subunit and _PROTEIN_ subunit . the identification of by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is especially interesting because the orthologue of this protein could not be identified by a variety of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ studies of the mammalian complex i.citation a detailed comparison of the amino acid sequences of from a variety of _METHOD_ reveals the arabidopsis contains a significant c terminal extension compared to mammalian orthologues . this extension contains several arginine and lysine residues and several peptides are predicted from a tryptic digestion . moreover the arabidopsis loop contains several basic amino acids not present in the mammal sequences . in our analysis we identified two peptides specific to one in loop and one in the c terminal extension . no equivalent of these peptides would be produced from trypsin digestion of the human or bovine . when analyzing spot no protein matches were identified using the standard protein database for arabidopsis derived from the genome annotation . however a match was obtained to an entry in genbank _PROTEIN_ for a theoretical open reading frame from chromosome of arabidopsis . this entry represents a predicted amino acid protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda which matches the location of the spot on the gel . further analysis revealed this orf is now annotated as the gene _GENE_ but that the current protein set shows this sequence translated in frame whereas both peptides identified are from translation in frame . this strongly suggests the current tair annotation of protein sequence is in _LOCATION_ . we identified three proteins encoded by _LOCATION_ genes that were not annotated as complex i subunits and have not previously been found in plant complex i preparations . two of these proteins appear to be new plant specific proteins associated with complex i as no homologues can be identified in mammals or fungal genomes . these new identifications increase the number of plant specific proteins associated with complex i to . the third protein has a low level of homology with the _PROTEIN_ subunit of bovine complex i and the kda subunit of chlamydomonas reinhardtii complex i . as a homologue of this subunit was previously found in rice complex i citation this protein can now be considered the arabidopsis orthologue of the _PROTEIN_ subunit of mammalian complex i . we were unable to identify the protein corresponding to two spots present on our gel . these spots are located above the diagonal indicating that the corresponding proteins are likely to be hydrophobic . they might correspond to and respectively . these subunits are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and are highly hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ . we have attempted several different protocols for the identification of these proteins . we have tried to digest these gel plugs with trypsin prepared in acetonitrile and combined trypsin/pepsin digestion in order to reduce the possible binding of tryptic peptides and produce different peptides for analysis . we have tried to directly load digestion products onto the column online to the _METHOD_ spectrometer to avoid concentration of peptides by evaporation that might lead to peptide insolubility . we have also altered our _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis to determine if microspray versus nanospray flow rates might increase the sensitivity of the detection of these peptides . we also prepared samples for analysis using maldi tof tof in attempts to find peptides that are not apparent during electrospray ionization . unfortunately all of these methods were unsuccessful and thus these spots can be visualized but can not be identified to date . among all of the proteins currently annotated in arabidopsis as complex i subunits based on sequence similarity only four subunits were not found in our gels of complex i the acyl carrier protein the kda subunit the _PROTEIN_ subunit and a putative plant specific component .citation the first three subunits have been previously identified as proteins present in arabidopsis mitochondria by complex mixture _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but have not been localized within the _LOCATION_ . we demonstrated recently that arabidopsis complex i does not appear to contain the mtacps but they are soluble proteins in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ the location of the kda and the _PROTEIN_ subunit proteins in arabidopsis mitochondria remains unknown . the _GENE_ protein was identified in a gel spot excised from a kda band containing other complex i subunits that was present on a bn _PROTEIN_ gel after destabilization of complex i by dodecylmaltoside.citation we have not currently been able to confirm this finding . in our gels two spots corresponded to prohibitins mitochondrial proteins that form a large complex very close to the size of complex i however these proteins are not part of complex i and are present here as contaminants due to their abundance . in our hands different proteins spots can be separated from complex v compared to the bands observed on bn/sds _PROTEIN_ . spot was clearly above the diagonal suggesting it is likely to be a hydrophobic component of the complex . compared to the previously published composition of complex v from arabidopsis citation we have experimentally identified more arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kda subunit . _PROTEIN_ is annotated as a subunit of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ synthase according to its sequence similarity to the f subunit of mammal _PROTEIN_ synthase but has not previously been experimentally shown to be a component of the complex in plants . _PROTEIN_ is the only _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit that has not previously been shown experimentally to be present in the complex by direct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis in plants . previous attempts to find this protein in preparations of the _PROTEIN_ synthase complex from arabidopsis failed citation and it was only revealed here by its deviation from the diagonal and a single high quality spectrum of a peptide from the loop between the first and second transmembrane domain . _GENE_ and _GENE_ are predicted to encode kda _PROTEIN_ proteins which contain a aa hydrophilic n terminal presequence region followed by transmembrane domains.citation the mature _PROTEIN_ protein is thus predicted to be kda and highly hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ and is a subunit of the fo portion of complex v. the _PROTEIN_ protein appears to be only kda on this gel separation consistent with the proposed removal of a large n terminal presequence.citation the plant specific _PROTEIN_ kda subunit was previously identified in the _PROTEIN_ synthase of potatocitation and rice.citation here we have found the arabidopsis homologue of this protein in the same respiratory complex . this protein may be analogous to one of the small peripheral _PROTEIN_ synthase proteins in yeast although sequence similarity searches fail to define which one it is likely that protein structure may be more important than sequence in these small subunits . yeast mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ synthases also contain a g subunit.citation in arabidopsis three _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are annotated as encoding homologues for this g subunit . none of these gene products were identified in our gel of complex v and no unidentified spots could be assigned to a putative g subunit . interestingly _PROTEIN_ subunit was also not identified in complex v in previous studies in arabidopsiscitation or rice citation but _PROTEIN_ was previously identified on a bn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detached from complex v.citation this indicates that either complex v does not contain a g subunit in plants or these g subunit like proteins are released during the solubilization procedure . as it now appears the g subunit may be specific for the dimeric _PROTEIN_ synthase citation it makes sense that it is absent from the monomeric _PROTEIN_ synthase separated in our blue native gels . a total of spots were observed on bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ of complex iii . on the bn/sds _PROTEIN_ bands are observed and some of these bands could correspond to degradation products . the analysis of complex iii composition _METHOD_ the presence of subunits . we did not find evidence for the hinge protein _PROTEIN_ a predicted subunit of complex iii in arabidopsis based on the presence of a homologue of this protein in the potato complex iii.citation the hydrophobic mitochondrial encoded _PROTEIN_ subunit is the only highly hydrophobic subunit of this complex and the only subunit to move off the diagonal in the analysis of this complex . we also found the _PROTEIN_ synthase kda protein in spot which would appear to be a contamination from complex v. a number of the subunits of these three respiratory complexes are encoded by multiple genes in arabidopsis giving rise to distinct but highly similar proteins . there are six subunits in complex i encoded in two gene copies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ along with the five _METHOD_ of the plant specific _PROTEIN_ anhydrase like proteins . six of the ten complex iii subunits are encoded in two gene copies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . there are also four subunits of complex v encoded by multiple genes in arabidopsis namely the tandem triplicated _PROTEIN_ beta subunit genes on chromosome three copies of the putative _PROTEIN_ like proteins two copies of the plant specific _PROTEIN_ kda subunit and two copies of the mitochondrial encoded _PROTEIN_ . as the stoichiometry of most of these subunits in each complex is established the presence of multiple _METHOD_ of a subunit would suggest that a heterogeneous collection of respiratory complexes was present . in some cases we have clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ evidence for multiple _METHOD_ while in others the spectra do not distinguish the _METHOD_ present . therefore a more detailed examination of the evidence for the presence of multiple _METHOD_ is presented in table citation . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ are encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ they are identical at the protein sequence level and differ by only amino acid residues . we found a series of spectra in spot that matched to both of these proteins but also high scoring spectra to the peptides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that specifically differentiate them . these peptides differ in _METHOD_ by amu as a result of the serine to alanine substititution and the amu difference can be clearly seen both in the parent _METHOD_ of the doubly charged ions and also in the extended y ion series in both spectra . the _METHOD_ of encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ are identical at the protein sequence level and differ by amino acid residues . each isoform was identified by three independent spectral matches . in one case these matches were gene specific identifying the peptides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the amu difference between them due to an alanine to proline substitution can be a seen in the parent _METHOD_ but also in the y ion series in the tandem spectra . in both spectra an identical y series up to is observed then it diverges by amu with good singly and doubly charged to series ions in each case . genevestigator datacitation show that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ at higher levels than _GENE_ in most arabidopsis tissues . despite low _PROTEIN_ levels _GENE_ is the dominant _METHOD_ in stamen and pollen where _GENE_ transcripts are not detected . the _METHOD_ of cytochrome encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ are identical and contain amino acid differences . each isoform was present in spot as evidenced by high scoring spectra matching to gene specific spectra for each product . genevestigator datacitation show that both _METHOD_ are _PROTEIN_ in most arabidopsis tissues at relatively similar levels . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ are identical and contain amino acid differences . both _METHOD_ were shown to be present in spot by six gene specific matches to _GENE_ and four gene specific matches to _GENE_ . genevestigator datacitation show that _GENE_ is the dominant transcript in most tissues . _GENE_ is normally present at lower levels in most tissues but is induced and can equal or exceed _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ during biotic and abiotic stress in dry seeds and during the early stages of seed imbibition . the different subunits of each complex appear to be dispersed from the diagonal line of the gels according to their relative hydrophobicity . plotting separation from the diagonal against _PROTEIN_ score shows that proteins with _PROTEIN_ scores above are significantly separated from the diagonal . the only highly hydrophobic protein whose migration did not appear to be affected was _PROTEIN_ . using this approach we can obtain a better separation of these subunits compared to standard methods such as bn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this has aided the definition of the composition of the tested complexes using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as proteins having the same molecular weight can be separated from each other according to their relative hydrophobicity using this approach . in our analysis over of spots corresponded to a single protein indicating the degree of resolution achieved by the three gel dimensions . having a spot that contains only one protein provides low complexity for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis leading to a higher sequence coverage and aids in the hunting through unassigned spectra for identification of putative peptide modifications . also as extremely hydrophobic proteins separate from the diagonal in a predictable manner this behavior can be used to focus the extra effort and use of modified protocols that are normally required to identify these proteins . because this technique displays a wider range of subunits and would allow quantitation of individual subunit abundance on gels it can also be applied to analyze the composition of subcomplexes the behavior of a complex under different physical conditions and modifications of the subunit composition in a mutant background or after a specific treatment .
