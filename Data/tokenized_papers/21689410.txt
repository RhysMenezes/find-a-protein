the translocator protein kda _PROTEIN_ previously known as the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor _PROTEIN_ is important for many cellular functions in mammals and bacteria such as steroid biosynthesis cellular respiration cell proliferation apoptosis immunomodulation transport of porphyrins and anions . arabidopsis thaliana contains a single _PROTEIN_ related gene with a amino acid n terminal extension compared to its homologs in bacteria or mammals suggesting it might be chloroplast or mitochondrial localized . to test if the _PROTEIN_ n terminal extension targets it to organelles we fused three potential translational start sites in the _PROTEIN_ cdna to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the location of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was found to depend on the translational start position and the conditions under which plants were grown . full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in vesicles of unknown identity when plants were grown in standard conditions . however full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to chloroplasts when grown in the presence of mm nacl conditions of salt stress . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was truncated to the second or third start codon at amino acid position or the fusion protein co localized with a mitochondrial marker in standard conditions . using promoter gus fusions qrt pcr _METHOD_ protein tagging and chloroplast fractionation approaches we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ levels are regulated at the transcriptional post transcriptional and post translational levels in response to abiotic stress conditions . salt responsive genes are increased in a _PROTEIN_ knock down mutant compared to wild type under conditions of salt stress while they are _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ is overexpressed . mutations in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes and the application of chlorophyll or carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors also affect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the response of arabidopsis to high salt stress . salt stress leads to re localization of the _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to chloroplasts through its n terminal extension . in addition our results show that _PROTEIN_ is regulated at the transcriptional level in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic mutants . thus we propose that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in transporting tetrapyrrole intermediates during salt stress and other conditions in which tetrapyrrole metabolism is compromised .
in physcomitrella patens the _PROTEIN_ of pptspo is induced by salt stress and abscisic acid _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is also induced by salt stress in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ as well as in arabidopsis cell cultures _PROTEIN_ . we further defined the transcript abundance of _PROTEIN_ in day old seedlings treated with nacl mannitol aba and methyl viologen by extracting total rna from these plants and performing quantitative real time pcr . compared to untreated plants mm nacl mm mannitol aba and methyl viologen resulted in increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ induction by nacl and aba stress were similar peaking hours after treatment and slowly _PROTEIN_ between h . addition of mannitol resulted in peak _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between h and then slowly _PROTEIN_ in abundance . however mannitol treatment showed a two fold induction compared to treatment with nacl for h which suggests that _PROTEIN_ is induced by osmotic stress rather than salt stress . _PROTEIN_ is rapidly induced by mv treatment showing induction at h peaking by h and then falling to basal levels within before increasing between h . induction of _PROTEIN_ mrna by abiotic stresses . quantitative real time pcr analyses of _PROTEIN_ transcripts upon treatment of different stresses mm nacl aba mm mannitol and methyl viologen . relative _PROTEIN_ levels were calculated and actin and rrna here used as reference genes . gus _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ gus and lhcb gus lines in day old transgenic arabidopsis plants either untreated or treated with mm nacl . to determine if _PROTEIN_ accumulation was a transcriptional response to nacl stress a construct containing bp upstream the putative translational start site of the _PROTEIN_ gene was fused to the uida reporter gene _PROTEIN_ and transformed into plants allowing in vivo analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcriptional response to stress conditions . _PROTEIN_ gus was found to be induced by mm nacl within h of treatment which is similar to qrt pcr results of the endogenous gene . in control experiments mm nacl resulted in a small _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ of lhcb gus . together these results suggest that the bp region of _PROTEIN_ promoter is sufficient for transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the function of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we obtained a t dna insertional mutant _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . this line _PROTEIN_ was found to have two tandem t dna insertions bp upstream from the translational initiation codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . homozygous lines were then confirmed to be knock down mutants by quantitative real time pcr analysis . in this mutant _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are about of wild type . phenotype of mutants with different levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . schematic representation of isolated insertional mutant of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . two copies of the t dna were inserted in tandem bp upstream from the translational initiation codon of _PROTEIN_ . total rna was isolated from day old seedlings reverse transcribed and subjected to qrt pcr . data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions and biological replicates . bars represent the standard _LOCATION_ of biological replicates . root lengths of at least individual day old seedlings grown in h photoperiods . chlorophyll concentrations in day old in vitro grown plants of the indicated genotypes were determined spectrophotometrically . values shown are means derived from three independent samples each sample containing mg of fresh weight . units are of chlorophyll a b per g of fresh weight . _PROTEIN_ fused or not to the n terminus of _METHOD_ was constitutively overexpressed from the camv promoter in transgenic arabidopsis lines _METHOD_ . we obtained over _PROTEIN_ lines but focused on the two homozygous lines that exhibited fold over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and wild type lines were grown side by side on either murashige skoog _METHOD_ agar medium or soil and were monitored for possible abnormal phenotypes . the knock down plants had longer roots compared to the wild type and the over _PROTEIN_ lines . moreover _PROTEIN_ accumulated less chlorophyll than either the wild type or the overexpression lines in the presence of mm nacl . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to be regulated by osmotic stress in germination and seedling growth assays _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ of photosynthetic genes in r. sphaeroides _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ mutants might have an impaired salt stress response . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of some well known salt stress regulated genes _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as expected stress marker genes were induced by mm nacl in wild type plants . in _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were lower but no significant change _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was observed . stress response genes are up regulated in _PROTEIN_ during salt stress . stress induced gene _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ lines compared to wild type plants by qpcr . day old seedlings grown under standard conditions and transferred for hours to plates containing mm nacl . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ mrna levels were determined by quantitative qrt pcr . relative amounts were calculated and normalized relative to col non treated . the actin and rrna were used as reference genes . actin rna _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions and biological replicates . relative _PROTEIN_ levels were calculated . bars represent the standard _LOCATION_ of biological replicates . in _PROTEIN_ mutants h of mm nacl treatment resulted in the increased _PROTEIN_ of all three stress marker genes . taken together these results show that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in regulating the _PROTEIN_ of stress response genes . consistent with _PROTEIN_ transporting tetrapyrroles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated less chlorophyll than wild type plants . because we found that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the salt stress response and because _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates photosynthetic genes in r. sphaeroides _PROTEIN_ . we next analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of a few key chlorophyll biosynthesis genes in _PROTEIN_ plants . initially we determined the mrna levels of most of the key genes in the tetrapyrrole pathway in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ encodes the h subunit of chloroplastic mg chelatase which is involved in the perception of altered levels of tetrapyrrolic intermediates _PROTEIN_ . all tetrapyrrole biosynthetic genes known to be light dependent _PROTEIN_ were found to be down regulated in _PROTEIN_ as well as in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ of the two light independent genes were unaffected in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes in _PROTEIN_ mutant . qrt pcr analyses of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes in col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ days old seedlings grown in constant light . relative amounts were calculated and normalized relative to col non treated . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all the genes have been show to be regulated by light . the data are presented following the enzymes order in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis . the actin and rrna genes were used as control . actin rrna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions and biological replicates . relative _PROTEIN_ levels were calculated . bars represent the standard _LOCATION_ of biological replicates . _PROTEIN_ mutants present reduced levels of light regulated tetrapyrrole metabolism genes and also have low chlorophyll content . in order to investigate if _PROTEIN_ flux of tetrapyrrole intermediates would affect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants we used two different drugs that interfere with tetrapyrrole biosynthesis gabaculine and norflurazon . gabaculine acts as a tetrapyrrole biosynthesis inhibitor by blocking the glutamate semi aldehyde aminotransferase activity . the herbicide norflurazon inhibits carotenoid biosynthesis and indirectly affects enzymes in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels increased fold in plants treated with of gabaculine and up to fold after nm norflurazon treatment . relationship between tetrapyrrole flux and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants germinated in of gabaculine or nm of norflurazon compared to untreated plants . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in different mutants of the tetrapyrrole pathway . relative amounts were calculated and normalized relative to col non treated . the actin and rrna genes were used as control . actin rna . data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions and biological replicates . relative _PROTEIN_ levels were calculated . bars represent the standard _LOCATION_ of biological replicates . to explore if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is affected by genetic alterations of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in different mutant backgrounds . we found that _PROTEIN_ levels are differently altered in various tetrapyrrole pathway mutants . _PROTEIN_ steady state levels were increased in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and lin . the increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in these mutants with reduced tetrapyrrole levels is consistent with _PROTEIN_ transporting tetrapyrroles for roles in other compartments . the only biosynthetic mutant that resulted in reduced _PROTEIN_ levels was _PROTEIN_ . all these mutations in exception of _PROTEIN_ inhibit somehow ala synthesis suggesting that disturbances in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis or accumulation affect _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of kda . this protein has three possible in frame _PROTEIN_ start codons in its n terminal extension region _PROTEIN_ . since reports of plant _PROTEIN_ localization have resulted in different findings subcellular localization of plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we re examined the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ and evaluated the roles of the n terminal extension in targeting _PROTEIN_ within the cell . past studies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have utilized n terminal _METHOD_ fusions that might block potential organellar targeting of _PROTEIN_ particularly mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ localization . to allow proper targeting of _PROTEIN_ fusions to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was placed on the n terminus of _METHOD_ . three constructs were made representing each of the potential start codons _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ from the camv promoter in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ subcellular localization was observed in root hypocotyls and cotyledons of these lines by confocal microscopy . full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the root tip and cotyledons in five day old seedlings . however in the hypocotyls of these plants the fusion protein was found in the _LOCATION_ and in vesicles of unknown identity . when _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were used the fusion proteins always co localized with mitotracker indicating a mitochondrial localization . these results corroborate the previous observations of mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ in d. lanata leaves by immunogold staining and in arabidopsis by western blot experiments _PROTEIN_ as well as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located protein _PROTEIN_ indicating that the alternative use of three initiation codons could be important for _PROTEIN_ localization and its post translational control . _PROTEIN_ has different sub cellular location depending on the translational start site used . confocal images of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localization . _METHOD_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ and vesicles of unknown function in the root hypocotyl and cotyledon . _METHOD_ localizes in the mitochondria of root hypocotyl and cotyledon . _METHOD_ show mitochondria localization in root hypocotyls and cotyledons . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is represented by green and chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ in red . the samples were incubated with mitotracker to identify mitochondria . homozygous transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type background were used for the analysis . scale bars . having established a key role for _PROTEIN_ in response to abiotic stress we next examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in plants subjected to various stress conditions . day old seedlings were treated with mm mannitol aba mv and mm nacl . after hours of treatment _METHOD_ became localized to the _LOCATION_ while neither _METHOD_ nor _METHOD_ had altered localization even with day extended nacl treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization did not change when plants were treated with mannitol aba or mv . _METHOD_ localizes in chloroplasts upon salt stress . confocal analyses show _METHOD_ localization in the _LOCATION_ and vesicles of unknown function in hypocotyls of day old seedlings grown in the standard conditions . confocal analyses show _METHOD_ chloroplast localization in hypocotyls of day old seedlings grown in the presence of mm nacl . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ channel is represented in green and chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ channel is represented in red . homozygous transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type background were used for the analysis . scale bars . to verify the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ during salt stress total protein from each lines was immunoblotted with antibodies to _METHOD_ . in all cases _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was found to increase significantly after of salt treatment . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ because empty vector controls using camv or ubiquitin promoters to drive the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ did not change in response to salt stress . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ accumulation is regulated at the transcriptional post transcriptional and post translational levels . _PROTEIN_ accumulation and chloroplast localization upon salt stress . immunoblot analysis of oxattspo _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins detected in plants with an antibody to _METHOD_ . plants were untreated or treated with mm nacl . as a control wild type plants and plants over _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ seedlings were used . anti _METHOD_ immunoblot of trypsinized chloroplasts from arabidopsis plants either untreated or treated with mm nacl . control immunoblots were probed with antibodies chloroplast proteins rubisco and and to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . each lane represents equal amounts of chloroplasts . to confirm the location of _PROTEIN_ we performed protease protection assays on isolated chloroplasts from _METHOD_ lines that were grown with or without mm nacl treatment . following chloroplast isolation and protease protection equal quantities of chloroplasts were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies to _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was detected in chloroplast fractions near its predicted monomeric molecular _METHOD_ in plants treated hours with mm nacl but not in untreated plants . chloroplasts prepared from oxtspo _METHOD_ lines occasionally displayed a lower molecular _METHOD_ band that is approximately the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ . this band probably results from proteolysis between _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ tag during sample preparation although we can not rule out other possibilities since we do not have an antibody to _PROTEIN_ protein itself . antibodies to rubisco and confirmed the integrity and presence of chloroplasts following protease protection . antibodies to the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ also verified these fractions were free of cytoplasmic contamination . these data together with confocal microscopy indicate that the region between the and is important for targeting _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts during salt stress . since _PROTEIN_ was protected from trypsin digestion _PROTEIN_ may be integral to the chloroplast outer envelope .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds ecotype col were surface sterilized and plated on _METHOD_ medium with or without mm kanamycin . seedlings were _PROTEIN_ for three days at and than grown under hours light/dark cycles at in growth chambers . root length measurements were conducted using plants grown on vertically oriented in standard conditions for days . for abiotic stress treatment mm nacl mm mannitol aba or paraquat was added to _METHOD_ agar plates and the day old seedlings were incubated under normal growth condition . for norflurazon or gabaculine experiments seeds were plated on _METHOD_ containing or sucrose with or without norflurazon or of gabaculine . all experiments were repeated three times independently and the average was calculated . total rna was isolated using plant total rna kit _PROTEIN_ according to manufacturer 's instructions . one microgram of total rna was added to each cdna synthesis reaction using the first strand cdna synthesis kit . for qrt pcr dna amplification was performed in the presence of green qpcr detection in a single color real time pcr detection system using the primer pairs at table . the cycle use was c min and sec c min c min and . the relative mrna levels were determined by normalizing the pcr threshold cycle number with actin and rna . all experiments were repeated three times independently and the average was calculated . primers used for quantitative real time pcr the _PROTEIN_ t dna mutant was obtained from the salk collection _PROTEIN_ . homozygous mutants were isolated by pcr based genotyping using gene specific pcr primers _PROTEIN_ lp and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ . only homozygous lines were used for the phenotypic investigation . primers used for cloning and genotyping the bp upstream of the translational star site of the _PROTEIN_ gene was translational fused into uida gene in vector by and introduced into arabidopsis via agrobacterium mediated transformation . for cloning primers and constructs information see tables and respectively . for histochemical gus _PROTEIN_ plant samples were soaked at for hours in gus assay solution _PROTEIN_ mm _PROTEIN_ triton x methanol and mm inorganic phosphate buffered saline . the reaction was further conducted at in the dark for a maximum of hours . constructs information for the _METHOD_ fusion constructs clones containing the coding region of _PROTEIN_ as well as fusions starting at methionine and were generated and cloned into according to the manufacturer 's instructions . primers used were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis thaliana was observed in a confocal laser scanning microscope leica dm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for the mitochondrial specific staining arabidopsis seedlings were incubated in red cmxros according to manufactures instructions . excitation and emission wavelengths were and nm _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ and and nm _PROTEIN_ for respectively . all images were processed on leica dm _PROTEIN_ image browser program _METHOD_ . seedlings at days after germination were weighted frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in acetone . ground tissue was centrifuged at g for min to pellet any insoluble material . the absorbance of the extracted chlorophyll at and nm was then determined . chlorophyll contents of the samples were determined according to lichtenthaler . isolation of chloroplasts from plate grown arabidopsis seedlings was performed as described previously . final resuspension of chloroplast was in buffer at a concentration of mg chlorophyll ml . total protein was extracted from day old seedlings by adding protein extraction buffer triton mm dtt . ground tissue was centrifuged at g for min to pellet the tissue and proteins were quantify by bradford assay . samples were boiled for min in mm tris hcl ph _PROTEIN_ glycerol mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was performed using standard procedures . chloroplast protein samples were normalized loaded by equal amounts of total chlorophyll . following _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ . for immunodetection _LOCATION_ were incubated with antibody against _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rubisco _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . with the exception of _METHOD_ detection that uses mouse secondary antibody all the immunoreactive proteins were detected by using rabbit secondary antibody . the immunoreaction was detected by chemiluminescence kit according to manufacturer 's instructions .
