iron acquisition in arabidopsis depends _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ a transporter in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root cells . however substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ is low leading to an excess accumulation of other transition metals in iron deficient plants . in the present study we describe _PROTEIN_ as a nickel transporter at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that counterbalances the low substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ and possibly other iron transport _METHOD_ in iron deficient root cells . _PROTEIN_ is co regulated with _PROTEIN_ by the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a _LOCATION_ protein which has putative transmembrane domains and shares homology with vertebrate exporters . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in various yeast mutants however did not demonstrate an iron transport function . instead _PROTEIN_ in wild type and nickel sensitive yeast cells conferred enhanced tolerance to elevated concentrations of nickel at acidic ph . a role in _LOCATION_ substrate transport was further supported by localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins to the tonoplast in arabidopsis suspension cells and root cells of intact plants . transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed an increased tolerance to elevated concentrations of nickel whereas t dna insertion lines lacking _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were more sensitive to nickel particularly under iron deficiency and accumulated less nickel in roots . we therefore propose a role of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ loading of nickel under iron deficiency and thus identify it as a novel component in the iron deficiency stress response .
_PROTEIN_ encodes an iron regulated _LOCATION_ protein related to vertebrate phylogenetic analysis of eukaryote and prokaryote sequences with the highest similarity to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ clearly pointed to a separation of a plant cluster from an animal cluster with particular high sequence conservation among mammalian sequences . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which share sequence similarity fell into a first and _PROTEIN_ into a second clade both of these clades harboring an additional sequence from rice . to verify an iron dependent regulation of _PROTEIN_ a northern analysis was conducted with hydroponically grown arabidopsis plants cultured under different iron regimes . transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ in roots were up regulated under iron deficiency and down regulated after resupply of iron similar to the transporter gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ increases nickel tolerance in of its homology with vertebrate iron exporters we assumed a iron export function and tested in heterologous _METHOD_ whether _PROTEIN_ might alleviate iron toxicity in iron sensitive yeast strains . neither the _PROTEIN_ strain which exhibits a constitutive overexpression of genes involved in iron acquisition nor _PROTEIN_ a mutant suffering from a lower capacity to transport iron into the _LOCATION_ showed different growth on medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of iron when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test an iron import function _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the iron uptake defective yeast mutant for a growth complementation test on fe . growth of _PROTEIN_ transformants however did not differ significantly from that of control transformants . in general plant iron transporters such as _PROTEIN_ or atnramps discriminate poorly between iron manganese zinc cobalt and cadmium . we therefore decided to screen for a heavy metal transport function of _PROTEIN_ employing yeast mutants with increased heavy metal sensitivities like and at increasing concentrations of different transition metals . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a deletion strain reversed its nickel sensitivity . remarkably _PROTEIN_ mediated tolerance to nickel was only observed at ph but could not be observed at ph or higher . this ph dependent contribution of _PROTEIN_ to nickel tolerance pointed to a putative function of _PROTEIN_ in proton dependent heavy metal export from the cytoplasm into the _LOCATION_ . intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in examine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in planta a _METHOD_ cdna was fused to the end of _PROTEIN_ and the fusion construct was placed under control of a promoter for transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts derived from a suspension cell culture . as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ dependent green _METHOD_ appeared as _PROTEIN_ shaped structures . a comparison to the transmission view and merging both images allowed identification of these globular compartments as _LOCATION_ . even in fully differentiated cells with large _LOCATION_ a small cytoplasmic region including organellar structures separated the _PROTEIN_ dependent _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ clearly indicating tonoplast localization . in contrast _METHOD_ derived from _METHOD_ alone localized to the cytoplasm and to the _LOCATION_ . in an independent approach transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under control of a kb fragment of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter were analyzed . in root cortex cells green _METHOD_ derived from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized internal of red _METHOD_ derived from the lipophilic dye which labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after short term incubation . these observations indicated that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and suggested a role of _PROTEIN_ in substrate transport across the tonoplast . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ results in enhanced nickel on the enhanced tolerance to nickel of yeast cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ we investigated whether overexpression of _PROTEIN_ also increases tolerance to elevated concentrations of this metal in planta . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the constitutive promoter were generated and four independent homozygous lines were examined in the generation . rna gel blot analysis using plants grown under iron sufficient conditions showed that _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in roots of the lines and while mrna levels in line were only slightly increased relative to the wild type _PROTEIN_ level . when seeds were germinated and grown for days on agar plates supplemented with or nickel wild type seedlings experienced a severe loss of _METHOD_ . in contrast the gain of fresh weight by the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor lines and was unaffected even at . in agreement with its lower _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ line showed an intermediate response with higher fresh weight than the wild type at nickel but a similar reduction in fresh weight as wild type plants at nickel . this differential growth response was also reflected by visible signs of plant health . wild type plants developed chlorosis at nickel and germinated poorly above nickel whereas lines and developed cotyledons even up to . to assess whether increased nickel tolerance was restricted to germination non stressed seedlings were subjected to different concentrations of nickel for days . at root growth was completely arrested in wild type plants and in line whereas root growth of the overexpressor lines and was not impaired . a phenotypic analysis of the same lines on agar with elevated concentrations of cadmium cobalt manganese zinc or iron did not yield any significant differences related to the level of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ levels in roots of wild type plants were not increased after supply of cobalt cadmium or nickel . to assess the nickel accumulation arabidopsis lines were precultured on nutrient solution for weeks and then continued to grow on nutrient solution supplemented with nickel . after days of nickel treatment line and wild type plants started to show a slight growth depression but nickel accumulation in roots of lines and were approx . higher indicating that a higher nickel tolerance in transgenic lines was related to an enhanced capacity for nickel accumulation in roots . _PROTEIN_ plants accumulate less nickel in roots and show an increased nickel sensitivity under iron lines were obtained from the salk collection that carry t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . in homozygous progenies from the generation verified by segregation and pcr analyses iron deficiency induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not detected but plants did not exhibit any visible phenotypes in soil culture . we then grew plants hydroponically for weeks before supplementing the nutrient solution with nickel for days . a subsequent analysis of transition metals in shoots yielded no significant differences in accumulation of any measured metal but in roots of both _PROTEIN_ insertion lines nickel concentrations were only half of those of wild type plants . all other metal concentrations in _PROTEIN_ roots were similar to wild type plants . in contrast overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to a significantly higher accumulation in roots of nickel but also of manganese copper and zinc . to confirm that the observed phenotype is indeed caused by loss of function of _PROTEIN_ we retransformed _PROTEIN_ plants with an _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct resulting in high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna and grew homozygous plants from the generation on nickel supplied agar under different iron regimes . the _PROTEIN_ insertion lines grew similar to the wild type under iron sufficient medium supplemented with up to nickel while greater than nickel supplied _PROTEIN_ plants produced significantly less _METHOD_ or root growth . under irondeficient growth conditions however growth repression of the _PROTEIN_ insertion line was severe in as little as nickel emphasizing that nickel sensitivity increases with iron deficiency . in comparison complemented _PROTEIN_ insertion lines were less sensitive to nickel and at high nickel supplies the complemented lines were even less sensitive than the wild type . to exclude the possibility that higher nickel tolerance of iron sufficient plants was caused by the presence of edta in the growth medium wild type arabidopsis plants were precultured for days under iron deficiency and then exposed to for min in the absence of any chelator . nickel uptake rates clearly increased with iron deficiency emphasizing that nickel uptake relates to the iron nutritional status of the plants . consistent with its up regulation under iron deficiency a potential function of _PROTEIN_ in iron deficiency induced nickel uptake was indicated by a higher nickel sensitivity of yeast cells ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
