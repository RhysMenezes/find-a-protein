higher plant sulfite and nitrite reductases contain siroheme as a prosthetic group . siroheme is synthesized from the tetrapyrrole primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii in three steps involving methylation oxidation and ferrochelation reactions . in this paper we report on the arabidopsis thaliana sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase at _PROTEIN_ . the complete precursor protein of amino acids and shorter constructs in which the first or residues had been removed were shown to complement a defined escherichia coli sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase mutant . the mature form of the protein appeared to consist of only amino acids making it much smaller than previously characterized ferrochelatases . green _METHOD_ protein tagging revealed that it is located in the chloroplast . the enzyme was easily produced in e. coli as a recombinant protein and the isolated enzyme was found to have a specific activity of nmol/min/mg . significantly the protein purified as a brown colored solution with a uv visible spectrum containing maxima at and nm suggestive of an fe s center . epr analysis of the recombinant protein produced a rhombic spectrum with g values of and and with temperature dependence consistent with a center . redox titration demonstrated that the fe s center is highly unstable with an apparent midpoint reduction potential of about mv . this is the first fe s center to be reported in a higher plant ferrochelatase . the implications of the fe s center in an enzyme that is so closely associated with the metabolism of sulfur and iron are discussed .
identification of a putative a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ transformation of uro'gen iii into siroheme requires the action of up to three enzymes a uro'gen iii methyltransferase a dehydrogenase and a ferrochelatase . in e. coli a single enzyme encoded by cysg catalyzes all three reactions . in yeast this transformation requires two enzymes called _PROTEIN_ and . however in other bacteria such as bacillus megaterium these activities are housed within three separate enzymes called sira sirc and _PROTEIN_ . we had already shown that arabidopsis contains a functional sira orthologue _PROTEIN_ . using the blast algorithm we were unable to identify orthologues in the arabidopsis genome or in any plant est data base of sirc . however a hypothetical protein encoded by _GENE_ displayed similarity to _PROTEIN_ . the gene is predicted to encode a protein of amino acids with identity to b. megaterium _PROTEIN_ . primers were designed to the predicted and ends of the gene and used to amplify the sequence by pcr from a cdna library . the amplified product was cloned into _PROTEIN_ and the resulting plasmid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was introduced into e. coli strain laciq pdcoba which is a sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase mutant and therefore unable to grow in the absence of exogenous cysteine . the _GENE_ cdna was able to complement the mutant phenotype . previous work has shown that some cobaltochelatases can also complement sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase deficiency . however cobaltochelatases can be differentiated from ferrochelatases on the basis that complementation of ferrochelatase activity by cobaltochelatases is inhibited in the presence of exogenous cobalt in the medium presumably due to competitive inhibition of the metal binding site within the chelatase . _GENE_ was still able to complement the e. coli sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase deficient strain in the presence of exogenous cobalt indicating that it is specific as a ferrochelatase and can thus be assigned as the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . subsequently further data base searching has revealed the presence of orthologues of _PROTEIN_ in rice and several other plants . subcellular location of at _PROTEIN_ alignment of the at _PROTEIN_ sequence against a range of different bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins and the highly related cobaltochelatase cbix revealed that significant similarity between the proteins started only at amino acid . furthermore the n terminus of the arabidopsis protein was predicted to be a chloroplast transit using the program chlorop with a hypothetical cleavage site at amino acid . other _METHOD_ predicted cleavage between amino acid and . given the _PROTEIN_ that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ it seemed likely that at _PROTEIN_ would be too and so we investigated the role of this putative transit peptide by cloning the cdna into _METHOD_ such that the protein would be _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus . the construct was introduced by biolistic transformation into week old tobacco leaves as described previously . transformed cells were identified by _METHOD_ h after transformation and then confocal _METHOD_ microscopy was used to determine the subcellular location . fig . panel a shows _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in a tobacco guard cell . if the at _PROTEIN_ protein had no targeting information then the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ would be present in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . instead the _METHOD_ is found in large round organelles which correspond to chloroplasts identified by chlorophyll _METHOD_ superimposition of the two images _METHOD_ this . targeting of _METHOD_ to the chloroplasts is also observed in a tobacco epidermal cell . because chlorophyll _PROTEIN_ is low in epidermal cells the red channel has been enhanced so chlorophyll _METHOD_ that appears to be inside the perimeter of the cell is probably from underlying mesophyll cells in the same plane . from these data it can be concluded that the protein encoded by _GENE_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ and the n terminus is a functional chloroplast transit peptide . however from the _PROTEIN_ sequence alignments it is difficult to judge the exact length of the transit peptide so two putative mature protein constructs were generated . at _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein that starts from amino acid the cleavage site predicted by chlorop whereas at _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the position that aligns with the start of similar bacterial proteins . both of these constructs cloned into _PROTEIN_ vector were tested for their ability to complement the e. coli sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase mutant . both were able to do so and again were not affected by the presence of cobalt in the medium . the mature form of at _PROTEIN_ is predicted therefore to contain between and amino acids . all the plant homologues identified in the databases are of similar length to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . this protein is only about half the size of the bacterial _PROTEIN_ orthologues and closer in size to the recently identified short cbix enzymes . as with the cbixs sequences the plant _PROTEIN_ aligns against both the n and c terminal halves of bacterial _PROTEIN_ sequences highlighting the _PROTEIN_ that these bacterial proteins had evolved as a result of a gene duplication and fusion event . in this respect the plant _PROTEIN_ can be considered a short version of _PROTEIN_ and should be referred to as _PROTEIN_ to differentiate it from the longer versions of _PROTEIN_ . production of at _PROTEIN_ as recombinant protein in e. recombinant _METHOD_ of at _PROTEIN_ containing and amino acids were produced in e. coli after transforming competent cells with the plasmids _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the recombinant protein _METHOD_ were produced with n terminal histidine tags to allow the proteins to be purified by metal chelate chromatography . analysis of protein isolated from strains harboring these constructs revealed that the full length protein _PROTEIN_ is highly unstable and is rapidly broken down into a number of smaller peptides . the middle sized construct is much more stable and is only partially degraded whereas the smallest construct produces the most stable protein of all with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . uv visible spectra and production of his tagged recombinant at _PROTEIN_ in e. coli allowed the protein to be rapidly purified by metal chelate chromatography . the recombinant at _PROTEIN_ purified as a brown colored solution suggesting that it might contain some bound prosthetic group or redox center . indeed toward the c terminus of the protein there is a short sequence containing four cysteine residues between amino acids and which would have the potential of binding such an fe s center . a uv visible spectrum of the protein revealed that it has absorption peaks at and nm a spectrum consistent with the presence of a center . to verify that the chromophore was due to the presence of an fe s center the shortest version of the protein was further characterized by epr . however the addition of excess sodium dithionite as a reductant yielded a weak spectrum that suggested that excess dithionite was destroying the iron sulfur center and leading to the disruption of the binding of the fe s center to the protein . the protein was therefore reduced with stoichiometric amounts of sodium dithionite and the epr spectrum shown in fig . was obtained . this is a rhombic spectrum with g values at of and . this spectrum was observable at k that together with the g anisotropy provides further support for the presence of a center . the form of the epr spectrum is however not exactly comparable with those previously reported for centers which may be indicative of reductant induced damage or of a new cluster structure that is susceptible to such damage . redox determine the midpoint reduction potential of the at _PROTEIN_ iron sulfur cluster a spectroelectrochemical potentiometric titration was performed as described previously . anaerobic reductive titration of at _PROTEIN_ with sodium dithionite resulted in significant spectral changes observed as bleaching of the absorption features by a _PROTEIN_ of as the enzyme is converted between the and _METHOD_ . although the protein remained stable during the reductive titration and showed no significant degree of aggregation during the h required to reduce the iron sulfur cluster fully subsequent attempts to restore the starting spectrum by oxidation with ferricyanide were unsuccessful . the fully reduced spectrum was not significantly affected by additions of the powerful oxidant . this again suggested that the redox center was unstable during the reduction process . a further reductive titration was undertaken this time terminating the reduction at the stage at which of the absorption of the at _PROTEIN_ iron sulfur cluster was bleached . thereafter ferricyanide was added to assess whether the partially reduced cluster could be reoxidized . however the at _PROTEIN_ spectrum was again almost completely unaffected by the addition of the oxidant indicating that the cluster was unstable to reduction by dithionite . notwithstanding the irreversible nature of the reductive titration plots of absorption change at various wavelengths across the visible range versus applied potential were sigmoidal and gave reasonable fits to the nernst equation producing consistent apparent midpoint potentials . fig . shows the spectra collected during the anaerobic reductive titration of at _PROTEIN_ from oxidized to reduced illustrating the absorption _PROTEIN_ across the entire visible range . the inset shows a fit of absorption data at nm to a single electron nernst function . the data fit produces an apparent midpoint reduction potential of mv . although this may be a reasonable estimate of the potential of the cluster in at _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ that the titration is not reversible suggests that the true potential may actually be rather more negative than this value . in vitro analysis of at _PROTEIN_ chelatase activity of the at _PROTEIN_ was investigated by assaying the activity of the purified at _PROTEIN_ in the presence of sirohydrochlorin and either cobalt or ferrous iron . the smallest form of the enzyme was found to have a specific activity of nmol/min/mg with cobalt as substrate and nmol/min/mg with ferrous iron as substrate . thus the enzyme has a higher rate of activity with cobalt rather than iron . it was not possible to measure an accurate km value for the metals as at low concentrations of metal the assay was not sensitive enough whereas at higher metal ion concentrations the enzyme was inactivated .
