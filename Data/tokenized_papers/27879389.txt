most eukaryotic cells target ubiquitinated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins for _LOCATION_ degradation in response to environmental and developmental cues . this process involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport _PROTEIN_ . however little is known about the cellular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in plants . here we studied the function of one _PROTEIN_ ii component which shows ubiquitin binding activity and may form a putative _PROTEIN_ ii with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . recessive mutation of the ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ causes multiple defects including delayed embryogenesis defective root elongation and limited expansion of cotyledons and these effects can be complemented by its genomic dna . abnormal intracellular compartments containing several _LOCATION_ transporters including members of the _PROTEIN_ formeds auxin resistant and _PROTEIN_ families were found in plants . employing a genetic approach to cross with transgenic plants harboring various _METHOD_ protein tagged organelle markers as well as _METHOD_ probe and ultrastructural approaches revealed pm proteins in microsomal fractions from seedlings and demonstrated that is critical for forming multivesicular bodies and _LOCATION_ biogenesis for protein degradation . our study shows that functional is essential for a proper endosomal sorting pathway and for _LOCATION_ biogenesis in arabidopsis .
an in silico forward genetic screen of the salk homozygote t dna collection for arabidopsis t dna insertional mutants with only nonhomozygous progeny identified several mutants defective in gametophytic or embryonic development . one mutant carrying a t dna insertion in the first exon of arabidopsis showed no mature homozygous progeny . among the segregating progeny of heterozygotes only a few miniature seedlings appeared to be homozygotes as evidenced by no _PROTEIN_ transcript . one quarter of the progeny had germination defects or growth arrest suggesting that is a recessive mutant . in addition to the first mutant another allele with the t dna inserted in the second intron was identified . similar to the progeny one quarter of the progeny appeared abnormal as shown in supplemental table . both homozygous mutants showed seedling lethal phenotypes and died before the emergence of true leaves . all these results suggest that the phenotypes of these lines were specifically disrupted by the t dna insertion in and was chosen for further characterization in this study . in cotyledon developmental defects in seedlings were widespread including the absence of the typical jigsaw puzzle pattern in pavement cells a lack of guard cells and the presence of unsealed cell wall stubs between two adjacent cells . mutant seedlings also showed defects in the organization and development of the root apical meristem . the seedling growth defects observed in could be complemented by either genomic dna or _METHOD_ fused driven by the promoter . thus the growth defects found in mutant are indeed caused by the t dna disruption in . results from rt pcr and gus assays using gus transgenic plants revealed that is _PROTEIN_ throughout all tissues and developmental stages including embryogenesis . however the failed germination of of the seeds implied defective embryogenesis and seed development . next we examined embryo development in siliques . the total seed numbers were similar between and wild type siliques but one quarter of the seeds showed an abnormal pale green color . microscopic imaging of developing embryos from siliques at the globular heart and torpedo stages revealed that developed uniformly up to the heart or torpedo stage while one quarter showed impeded development at the transition or heart stage . this segregation ratio clearly indicated a recessive mutation of leading to retarded embryo development . may be essential across multiple growth and developmental processes after the heart stage of embryogenesis . in fungi and metazoans _PROTEIN_ ii consists of _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ molecules forming a y shaped structure . to determine whether can form a putative _PROTEIN_ ii with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we used several tagged recombinant proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for in vitro protein pull down assays . glutathione sepharose beads bound to _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins could more efficiently pull down the recombinant proteins _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ than the glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ control as revealed by western blot analysis with his antisera . thus may interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to form a putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ ii complex . in yeast and mammals must bind to and transfer ubiquitinated _LOCATION_ cargo through its glue domain between different _PROTEIN_ complexes . to examine the potential ubiquitin binding activity of arabidopsis we used ubiquitin agarose as bait for a pull down assay of the glue domain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins and we found that all of these proteins were more enriched in the ubiquitin agarose than in the _PROTEIN_ control . these results showed that could bind to ubiquitin through the conserved glue domain . however we also found that from arabidopsis but not from yeast could interact with ubiquitin agarose . these results suggest that the ubiquitin binding mechanism of in arabidopsis is quite different from that in yeast and mammals whose interacts with ubiquitin through the glue domain . in general is composed of two major domains the glue domain for ubiquitin binding and the domain for interacting with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in yeast interacts with ubiquitin through an nzf motif that is absent from the proteins in both animals and plants . additionally the glue domain of animal binds both phosphoinositides and ubiquitin and the deletion of glue in leads to the loss of ubiquitin binding . in arabidopsis the glue domain has been identified as showing ubiquitin binding ability nevertheless additional ubiquitin binding motifs may be present in because the lacking the glue domain still showed ubiquitin affinity . compared to yeast and animal proteins the region between the glue and domains of shows less conservation . in addition has a longer c terminus than the yeast and animal homologs . this region might be the potential ubiquitin binding domain in . it will be interesting to identify and characterize these unknown motifs in the near future . despite these differences arabidopsis may form a functionally conserved _PROTEIN_ ii with its corresponding partners _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibiting an evolutionarily conserved ability to bind to its ubiquitinated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targets . pm localized auxin carriers are responsible for the _PROTEIN_ flow and the creation of local concentration maxima of auxin to trigger diverse developmental processes including embryogenesis . at the heart stage of developing embryos auxin accumulates at the tips of both rudimentary cotyledons and roots where it begins to regulate further development in a stoichiometric manner . these auxin carriers may be the targets of a putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ ii . to track the distribution and accumulation of auxin during embryogenesis we crossed plants with plants harboring _METHOD_ driven by the promoter which is up regulated by synthetic auxin . the self pollinated siliques at the torpedo stage were collected and analyzed . as shown in figure most of these embryos showed strong _METHOD_ signals in both apical and basal tips where auxin accumulated similar to wild type embryos thereafter all of them are described as the control as in figure . compared to wild type like embryos with detectable apical and basal tip localized auxin approximately one quarter of the development retarded embryos in the same siliques showed impaired _PROTEIN_ flow of auxin in rudimentary cotyledons as reported in a previous analysis which suggested that they were homozygotes . to clarify the defective distribution of auxin in embryos we crossed plants with transgenic plants harboring _METHOD_ protein tagged auxin efflux and influx carriers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . embryos from transgenic seedlings carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the background developed similarly to those from mutants which showed abnormal progeny . after the heart stage the control embryos showed a restricted accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the primary vascular tissue to mediate both intercellular movement and the local accumulation of auxin . after the early torpedo stage when vascular tissues differentiate and branch out the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals remained restricted to vascular tissues however in growth retarded embryos _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vascular tissues expanded all the way up to the rudimentary cotyledons but did not branch out . this difference in the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may be caused by defects in the development of vascular tissues or by the misexpression of _PROTEIN_ in embryos . moreover unlike the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in rudimentary cotyledons in wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was aberrantly accumulated in intracellular compartments in embryos . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ did not differ substantially between the control and plants . nevertheless in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the intracellular compartment of the root cap rather than in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as in the control . the _PROTEIN_ mediated degradation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be impaired in embryos . the marked growth defect in roots indicates that the local auxin accumulation might not persist long after germination . to test this hypothesis we observed the distribution of _METHOD_ driven by the promoter and we found it to be up regulated by auxin in roots of wild type and seedlings . in wild type seedlings auxin accumulated in the stem cell niche especially at the quiescent center where it peaked in level while in the signal significantly accumulated in cells of the columella . the _PROTEIN_ transport and accumulation of auxin may be impaired in seedlings . next we investigated the _PROTEIN_ patterns and subcellular localizations of three auxin transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the roots of both wild type and seedlings obtained from crossing plants with transgenic plants carrying the constructs . in wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ specifically localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the vascular tissue . in seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed significant accumulation in the _LOCATION_ of the vascular tissue . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of protophloem columella _PROTEIN_ root cap and epidermal cells in the arabidopsis root tip . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was mislocalized to the intracellular compartments in the roots of seedlings . moreover the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ was selected for testing whether auxin independent _LOCATION_ proteins accumulate in intracellular compartments similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in . similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the aberrant accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in was observed suggesting that the defects caused by in _LOCATION_ protein trafficking are not restricted to auxin related _LOCATION_ proteins . the _PROTEIN_ machinery mediated recycling/degradation process may be critical for the _LOCATION_ degradation of these _LOCATION_ proteins . indeed the abnormal accumulation of these auxin relative carriers in the cytoplasm of root tips may alter the distribution of auxin thereby resulting in defective root development in seedlings . we observed the intracellular compartments of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the root tips of seedlings . _PROTEIN_ is known to _PROTEIN_ localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the basal side of cortical cells and at the apical side of epidermal cells and the latter is more convenient for tracking the dynamic endomembrane trafficking . next we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a tracking cargo of _PROTEIN_ to clarify the trafficking defects in . as with the aberrant aggregation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in intracellular compartments in . to identify endomembrane compartments with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulations we crossed plants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ the early endosome/trans _LOCATION_ network marker red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and examined progeny carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under wild type and genetic backgrounds . in wild type root tips _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the ee/tgn or _PROTEIN_ respectively . however in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially colocalized with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to quantify the colocalization results the linear pearson and nonlinear spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the pixels representing the _METHOD_ signals in both the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ channels was used to assess the colocalization . the psc calculation showed that compared to the wild type exhibited higher levels of colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in both the ee/tgn and the _PROTEIN_ . moreover in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated less in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled ee/tgn than in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ suggesting differential accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in ee/tgn and _PROTEIN_ . the pronounced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the ee/tgn suggests that participates in _PROTEIN_ formation from the ee/tgn . moreover the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ predominantly in the _PROTEIN_ compartment suggests that is essential for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ targeting from _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ for degradation . is a component of the _PROTEIN_ ii complex that is responsible for targeting proteins to the _LOCATION_ . the accumulation of auxin carriers within the ee/tgn and _PROTEIN_ may result from a defective _LOCATION_ targeting pathway . to test this hypothesis both wild type and root tips stained with for h were used to track the trafficking of from endosomes to _LOCATION_ . . in the wild type labeled tonoplasts were observed within epidermal cells but in signals remained punctate foci and colocalized well with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ compartments . a functional _PROTEIN_ ii complex may be critical for _LOCATION_ targeting and probably for _LOCATION_ biogenesis . we further investigated the findings of a blocked _LOCATION_ targeting pathway in and the absence of labeled tonoplasts in roots . the maturation of a lytic _LOCATION_ relies on the transport of tonoplast and _LOCATION_ resident proteins from the ee/tgn to the _LOCATION_ through the pvc/mvb . as shown in the above results the targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ is impaired in plants . to visualize _LOCATION_ targeting in the roots we introduced an _METHOD_ tagged tonoplast specific syntaxin protein vesicle associated _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ into plants . wild type root cells showed many typical _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated _LOCATION_ moreover cells showed intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapping with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the magnified images obtained from thin optical sections clarified the details of the fragmented _LOCATION_ . almost all the small and aggregated circular compartments with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated contours strongly colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . next we investigated the cell ultrastructure using transmission electronic microscopy . in contrast with wild type cells which contain typical large lytic _LOCATION_ root tip cells showed many small and aggregated compartments but no typical _LOCATION_ . moreover lytic _LOCATION_ indicated by labeling with lysotracker red were less abundant in . additionally we examined the morphologic features of protein storage _LOCATION_ in the maturing seeds of siliques . of the embryos examined showed typical large psvs while the remainder showed only numerous small psvs demonstrating mendelian segregation . in plants the presence of abnormal lytic _LOCATION_ in the root and abnormal storage _LOCATION_ in mature embryos indicated that is essential for _LOCATION_ biogenesis . _PROTEIN_ ii is required for sorting cargo and recruiting _PROTEIN_ iii to indentation sites for the formation of ilvs and for the maturation of ilvs into mvbs . ultrastructural observations of epidermal cells revealed typical and to nm diameter mvbs with ilvs in wild type cells but again no typical mvbs in instead cells showed many _LOCATION_ compartments similar in size to wild type mvbs but with one or no ilvs . to further confirm the identity of the mvbs we used an antibody for the mvb marker _PROTEIN_ for an immunogold study . unlike wild type cells with _PROTEIN_ localized on the _LOCATION_ of typical mvbs in cells the _PROTEIN_ labeled membranous compartments did not contain typical ilvs . the mean number of ilvs was for wild type and for mvbs . this finding is consistent with the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the membranous compartments of cells . therefore we conclude that contributes to ilv formation and to the subsequent sequestering of _LOCATION_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ to ilvs . the primary function of the _PROTEIN_ pathway is targeting _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins toward the _LOCATION_ for degradation . because can bind monoubiquitin in vitro and is involved in targeting several auxin carriers to _LOCATION_ seedlings might show significant accumulation of ubiquitinated _LOCATION_ proteins . fractionation revealed only small amounts of ubiquitinated _LOCATION_ proteins in crude extracts and in supernatant and microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions of wild type seedlings . in seedlings the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was comparable between the crude extract and the soluble fraction but increased in the microsomal _LOCATION_ fraction . moreover western blotting with anti _PROTEIN_ serum showed an additional band that was larger by approximately kd in but not in wild type suggesting that ubiquitinated _PROTEIN_ is present in . thus plays important roles in the formation of functional mvbs and in the degradation of ubiquitinated _LOCATION_ proteins in _LOCATION_ . to evaluate the subcellular localization of in vivo we crossed _METHOD_ transgenic plants with plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . notably most of the _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in comparison with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed very few puncta . instead of good colocalization with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the punctate signals of were either adjacent to or partially overlapping with these proteins suggesting that associates with the specific domain of the ee/tgn or _PROTEIN_ where _PROTEIN_ occurs rather than occupying the entire _LOCATION_ of the ee/tgn or the _PROTEIN_ .
