phototropins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant specific blue light receptor kinases mediate a range of physiological responses in arabidopsis including phototropism chloroplast photorelocation movement stomatal opening and leaf flattening . phototropins consist of two photoreceptive domains at their n terminus _PROTEIN_ and and a serine/threonine kinase domain at their c terminus . here we determined the molecular moiety for the _LOCATION_ association of phototropins using the yeast cytotrap and arabidopsis protoplast _METHOD_ . we then examined the physiological significance of the _LOCATION_ association of phototropins . this detailed study with serial deletions narrowed down the association domain to a relatively small part of the c terminal domain of phototropin . the functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants in the _PROTEIN_ deficient adiantum and arabidopsis mutants revealed that the ability to mediate the chloroplast avoidance response correlated well with _PROTEIN_ s _LOCATION_ association especially with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . taken together our data suggest that a small part of the c terminal domain of phototropins is necessary not only for _LOCATION_ association but also for the physiological activities that elicit phototropin specific responses .
to examine the biochemical properties of the phototropin _LOCATION_ association we first compared the solubility of _LOCATION_ localized phototropins in various buffers with different concentrations of detergents such as triton x chaps and octyl _PROTEIN_ . the pelleted fractions which were recovered by high speed ultracentrifugation of the extract in the absence of detergent contained most _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we then treated the p fractions with different concentrations of triton x and subjected them to high speed ultracentrifugation . consequently the amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recovered in the solubilized fraction gradually increased as the concentration of triton x increased . with triton x the majority of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was solubilized into the ps fraction . in contrast a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ spanning proton pump p type h _PROTEIN_ was primarily detected in the pellet _PROTEIN_ even after treatment with triton x . we also confirmed that phototropins were easily solubilized by treatment with chaps and mm og . next we examined whether ionic interactions contributed to the _LOCATION_ association of phototropins . protein extracts were prepared in extraction buffer containing various concentrations of nacl and then subjected to protein fractionation by high speed ultracentrifugation . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected only in the p fraction even at the highest nacl concentration . as expected the h _PROTEIN_ did not dissociate from the _LOCATION_ fraction due to nacl treatment . these results indicate that electrostatic interactions do not contribute greatly to the association between phototropins and _LOCATION_ . collectively these data essentially confirm previous findings for _PROTEIN_ in oat and pea seedlings . the cytotrap yeast two hybrid system is a conventional system used to detect protein protein interactions in the _LOCATION_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ . namely the human sos protein when fused to a bait protein can complement the _PROTEIN_ induced growth defect only when it is recruited to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through a _LOCATION_ interaction with a _LOCATION_ anchored prey protein or a direct interaction with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or yeast _LOCATION_ proteins . if such conditions are met hsos allows yeast cell growth at a restrictive temperature . when yeast cells _PROTEIN_ the hsos phototropin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were subjected to normal and restrictive temperatures the cells grew normally even in the absence of the interacting prey protein indicating that phototropins exhibited _LOCATION_ localization activity in yeast cells . as expected when phototropins were _PROTEIN_ without hsos they failed to allow cell growth at the restrictive temperature . thus the _LOCATION_ recruitment of hsos occurred only when it was fused to phototropins . in summary the cytotrap system was successfully adopted to examine the _LOCATION_ association activity of phototropins in yeast . it should be noted that we can not discriminate the direct interaction of phototropins with the _LOCATION_ from a direct interaction with a yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . taking advantage of the modified cytotrap assay we systematically examined the _LOCATION_ association activity of various phototropin derivatives . because full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ allowed yeast growth at the restrictive temperature we first examined the activity of the n and c terminal fragments of those phototropins . the c terminal but not the n terminal fragments exhibited _LOCATION_ association activity in yeast . essentially identical results were also obtained with crphot . collectively these data are essentially consistent with the previous findings that is necessary and sufficient for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . we then examined a series of c terminal deletion mutants of _PROTEIN_ for their _LOCATION_ association activity . as shown in fig . c terminal deletions shorter than amino acids did not affect the _LOCATION_ association activity . in contrast _PROTEIN_ with deletions longer than amino acids failed to exhibit _LOCATION_ association activity . similarly the deletion of amino acids in _PROTEIN_ resulted in the complete loss of the _LOCATION_ association activity . these results indicate that a short amino acid stretch of amino acid residues residing at the very c terminal end of the phototropins is important for the _LOCATION_ association activity . to address whether a lack of protein stability accounted for the lack of _LOCATION_ association activity we evaluated protein levels of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ deletion mutant proteins in yeast using confocal microscopy . the intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the c terminal deletion mutants were comparable with hsos _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and hsos _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ association activity . interestingly hsos and hsos as well as the deletion mutants exhibited both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and punctate localizations . in contrast the c terminal deletion mutants were observed exclusively in a part of the cytoplasm with a faint uniform signal throughout the cytoplasm although hsos was observed uniformly in the cytoplasm . hence the loss of _LOCATION_ association activity in the c terminal deletion mutants in the yeast cells is strongly correlated with the intracellular localization rather than a lack of protein stability . _PROTEIN_ was chosen for further analysis of the _LOCATION_ association activity of the c terminal kinase fragment . the n terminal deletion experiments revealed that the amino acid deletion abolished the _LOCATION_ association activity indicating the positive contribution of this region to _LOCATION_ association . however the intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were significantly reduced in the c terminal fragments of _PROTEIN_ compared with that of hsos although punctate stains were consistently observed . more importantly relatively short c terminal fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited _LOCATION_ association activity by _METHOD_ although the intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were faintly observed in the cytoplasm without any punctate staining . similarly _PROTEIN_ which is a counterpart of _PROTEIN_ also retained the _LOCATION_ association activity . furthermore a similar fragment of the _PROTEIN_ protein kinase which is another member of the _PROTEIN_ viii protein kinase subfamily exhibited _LOCATION_ association activity as well . taken together a relatively small region within the c terminal kinase domain _PROTEIN_ was indicated to be important for not only the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association but also punctate staining distribution . interestingly this region is highly conserved in the _PROTEIN_ viii serine/threonine kinase family although no known _LOCATION_ association/interaction motif is found in this region . to confirm the results obtained in the yeast cells we examined the _LOCATION_ association activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ crphot and their derivatives in the arabidopsis leaf protoplast . first full length phototropins fused to _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts by polyethylene glycol transformation . consequently strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed exclusively in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region as is the case with h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . furthermore the _METHOD_ fused phototropins were detected at the proper molecular sizes in the immunoblot analysis of the microsomal fractions prepared from the protoplasts . the modified cytotrap results were confirmed for full length phototropins in plant cells . the intracellular localizations of the c terminal _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants were then examined in the mesophyll protoplasts . although the deletion of and amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region did not affect localization compared with deletions of and amino acids substantially reduced the _LOCATION_ association activity . the deletion of amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region abolished the _LOCATION_ association activity and accumulated strongly in the cytoplasm . to clarify the _LOCATION_ association activity of in comparison with in the protoplast cell we carried out protein fractionation . an amount of was also found in the p fraction but the ratio of the s to the p fraction in increased compared with that of . we obtained a similar result for _PROTEIN_ the mutant containing a deletion of amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region accumulated mostly in the cytoplasm and less on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it remains unclear why _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells and in the protoplasts exhibited different localization patterns . the deletion of amino acids might only partially reduce the activity . in such a situation the apparent localization patterns obtained in different experimental _METHOD_ might be more difficult to compare . in the yeast cytotrap system the and c terminal fragments of _PROTEIN_ exhibited _LOCATION_ association activity . therefore we examined whether the same fragment was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region in protoplasts . consequently _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of was uniformly observed on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ as with the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone . this was somewhat contradictory to the result of the modified cytotrap assay . therefore we quantitatively analyzed the localization of in the protoplast cell by protein fractionation . was recovered similarly in the p and s fractions whereas _METHOD_ was found primarily in the soluble fraction and much less in the microsomal fraction . thus significant _LOCATION_ association activity of was demonstrated in protoplasts although the activity was not high enough to localize exclusively to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it is noted here that the _PROTEIN_ levels in the transient _PROTEIN_ system are relatively high . hence it is plausible that overproduced proteins could be localized to the cytoplasm rather than exclusively to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _LOCATION_ recruitment is saturated . we then examined the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ with c terminal deletions in transgenic arabidopsis . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ g g or g were established in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity and immunoblot analysis indicated that the level of g _PROTEIN_ was comparable with that of in . in darkness and g was localized strongly to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and weakly in the cytoplasm . although the _PROTEIN_ was lower than that of and g g exhibited a reduced signal in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but a relative signal in the cytoplasm . the protein fractionation confirmed that g was recovered in similar amounts in the p fraction and the s fraction but larger amounts of the wild type and g were recovered in the p fraction compared with the s fraction . thus the c terminal amino acid residues retain some activity _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants although they were necessary for _LOCATION_ association in the yeast cells as well as in the protoplasts . in addition g exhibited a similar fractionation pattern to g but the _PROTEIN_ level was too low to determine the intracellular localization pattern using confocal microscopy . in contrast to the dark condition the intracellular localization patterns of g were somewhat different from that of full length _PROTEIN_ . namely punctate distribution patterns presumably representing the association with the _LOCATION_ apparatus were observed after several passes of the confocal laser in the transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ and g . in contrast no clear punctate _METHOD_ was observed for g in response to multiple confocal laser scanning or actinic blue light . we further confirmed that g never exhibited a punctate distribution in protoplasts in which the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible as punctate _METHOD_ . thus we concluded that the amino acids of the c terminus were necessary for the _LOCATION_ specific localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . citation reported that the c terminal amino acid residues of were necessary for the chloroplast avoidance response in the fern adiantum capillus veneris l. these amino acid residues correspond to the c terminal amino acid residues in _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal amino acid residues in _PROTEIN_ were important for _LOCATION_ localization but were possibly not very important for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization in transgenic arabidopsis . therefore we examined the physiological activity of g in typical phototropin responses such as chloroplast photorelocation phototropism and leaf flattening . to assess the physiological activity of a series of c terminal deletion mutants we employed the adiantum transient _PROTEIN_ system in which the chloroplast avoidance response can be conventionally tested . we first examined whether complemented the defective avoidance response of the bhc mutant which is deficient in _PROTEIN_ . consequently full complementation of the mutant phenotype was observed . similarly and exhibited clear responses to microbeam irradiation with strong blue light . however the activity appeared to be gradually _PROTEIN_ as the c terminal amino acid residues were removed . finally and completely failed to elicit the chloroplast avoidance response which was consistent with the loss of the _LOCATION_ association activity in these derivatives . we next examined the g _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis for chloroplast accumulation and avoidance responses . the chloroplasts in g in low light conditions were sparsely distributed on the upper surface of the cell which resembled the _PROTEIN_ cells indicating that g was deficient in the low light induced accumulation response as well . however the accumulation response was unexpectedly retained in the g transgenic arabidopsis . namely chloroplasts were in the accumulation position rather than the avoidance position under the high light condition which means that g failed to elicit the avoidance response in this condition in arabidopsis as was observed in adiantum cells . notably the chloroplasts exhibited the accumulation position under high light indicating that g retained partial activity and was able to elicit the accumulation response . to examine the biological activities of the c terminal deletion mutants in other _PROTEIN_ responses the g g and g transgenic lines were tested for the phototropic response and leaf flattening . interestingly g complemented the deficiency in the phototropic response in response to high intensity blue light and leaf flattening . because the _PROTEIN_ level of g was relatively low in these lines g appeared to be as active as the authentic _PROTEIN_ for these responses . in contrast to g g was totally incapable of mediating the phototropic and leaf flattening response although the _PROTEIN_ level was quite low in this transgenic line . conversely g was fully functional for both responses as expected .
the gl mutant as the wild type control and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were described previously . seeds were planted on agar plates containing half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with sucrose at ph . plants were grown in a plant growth chamber or a growth room controlled at h . for phototropic analysis sterilized seeds were sown on agar medium containing half strength _METHOD_ salts without sucrose at ph cdnas of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and chlamydomonas phot were used for vector construction . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and crphot were translationally fused at their and/or coding end to the _METHOD_ gene and the genes were inserted between the promoter and the nos terminator in the _METHOD_ transient vector . the deletion derivatives were generated by pcr amplification . oligonucleotides containing the specific restriction sites were used to clone the pcr products that were subsequently subcloned into the corresponding sites of their respective vectors . for transgenic plants plasmids were constructed by replacing their respective genes with the _PROTEIN_ gene of the binary vector . the resulting binary vectors were transformed into _PROTEIN_ double mutants as previously described . kanamycin resistant plants were selected on _METHOD_ agar containing mg kanamycin and mg claforan . the kanamycin resistance co segregated tightly with the _METHOD_ of the fusion proteins in every line . all analyses were performed using independent transformants from the generation . the _LOCATION_ recruitment test of phototropins in yeast was performed using the yeast cytotrap system with the guidance of the manufacturer s instructions . temperature sensitive tests were performed at and in the dark . protein fractionation was carried out using the methods described previously . immunoblot analysis of _METHOD_ fusion proteins was performed using an anti _METHOD_ monoclonal antibody as previously described . the microsomal fractions were collected by centrifugation at for h resuspended in a buffer containing chaotropic agents sodium salt or triton x and incubated on ice for min . the solutions were further fractionated into the supernatant and the pellet by centrifugation at for h. the resultant fractions were separated on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels transferred onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and probed with an anti _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ and anti h _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibodies respectively . phototropic responses were examined by measuring the hypocotyl curvature in response to unilateral blue light as previously described . for chloroplast positioning the mesophyll cells were inspected on the adaxial side of the rosette leaves . for leaf flattening the pictures of rosette leaves were taken of plants grown in soil in cm diameter plastic pots for weeks as previously described . to examine whether the clones showing loss and/or retention of _LOCATION_ recruitment activity complemented the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ the clones were introduced transiently into the _PROTEIN_ deficient adiantum gametophytes by particle bombardment as previously descried . the gametophytes were incubated overnight at and the transformed prothalial cells were selected by screening the cellular _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the prothalial cells were mounted on an agarose filled glass slide . the chloroplast avoidance response induced by high fluence blue light was analyzed by microbeam irradiation using the indicated light intensities . _METHOD_ fusion proteins were employed to test the intracellular localization of crphot _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and their fragmented domains which had already been tested for _LOCATION_ recruitment in yeast and underwent functional analysis in adiantum . the respective plasmid constructs were used for transient _PROTEIN_ . the protoplast was prepared from the rosette leaves of week old _PROTEIN_ double mutants and the fusion gene constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts using peg mediated transformation as previously described . an aliquot of of plasmid dna was used for protoplasts and observation was performed h after dark incubation using confocal microscopy . confocal laser scanning microscopy and image analysis were performed as previously described . the filter sets were nm for _METHOD_ nm for _METHOD_ and nm for chlorophyll _METHOD_ .
