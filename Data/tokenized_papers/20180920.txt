arabidopsis transparent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ like protein that is involved in the accumulation of proanthocyanidins _PROTEIN_ in the seed coat . _PROTEIN_ accumulation sites in _PROTEIN_ immature seeds were observed as small _LOCATION_ like structures whereas those in _PROTEIN_ a mutant of the tonoplast bound transporter of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were observed at peripheral regions of small _LOCATION_ . we found that _PROTEIN_ immature seeds had small spherical structures showing unique _PROTEIN_ morphology by differential interference contrast microscopy . the distribution pattern of the _PROTEIN_ structures overlapped the location of _PROTEIN_ accumulation sites and the _PROTEIN_ structures were outlined with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ analysis showed higher levels of solvent insoluble _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ immature seeds compared with the wild type . metabolic profiling of the solvent soluble fraction by lc _METHOD_ demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ derivatives such as epicatechins and epicatechin oligomers although highly accumulated in the wild type were absent in _PROTEIN_ . we also revealed that _PROTEIN_ specifically accumulated glycosylated epicatechins the putative transport substrates for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a similar metabolic profile to _PROTEIN_ . given the _LOCATION_ localization of functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ which acts prior to _PROTEIN_ functions in the _LOCATION_ to _PROTEIN_ the regular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ precursors such as epicatechin and glycosylated epicatechin in the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ pathway in the arabidopsis seed coat is discussed in relation to the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ metabolites .
we first prepared the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ construct under the control of the _PROTEIN_ authentic promoter . when this construct was introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutants anthocyanin accumulation in seedlings and _PROTEIN_ accumulation in mature seeds were completely restored to the wild type level . this indicated that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins are functional in planta . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ in subepidermal cells of hypocotyls where anthocyanins specifically accumulate at the seedling stage . in immature seeds the fusion proteins were found only in endothelial cells where _PROTEIN_ specifically accumulate . this indicated that the _PROTEIN_ promoter restricts _PROTEIN_ to anthocyanin and _PROTEIN_ accumulating cells in arabidopsis implying a correlation between _PROTEIN_ function and anthocyanins and _PROTEIN_ . our attention then turned towards the investigation of _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis and the accumulation pathway in the seed coat . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in _PROTEIN_ accumulating cells immature seeds from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformants were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins showed no specific organelle like localization and were dispersed in the _LOCATION_ . a similar _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins was observed in _PROTEIN_ the knock out mutant for a _PROTEIN_ transporter gene as well as arabidopsis suspension cultured cells transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . to characterize the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins biochemically total protein from young siliques of transformants was differentially centrifuged to obtain microsomal and soluble fractions and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . strong signals showing the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were found in the soluble fraction whereas only negligible signals were detected in the microsomal fraction . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ proteins function in the _LOCATION_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ bound form in immature seeds . vanillin which reacts with _PROTEIN_ derivatives such as flavan ols and the terminal units of _PROTEIN_ polymers has been used to detect the distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ derivatives in arabidopsis seeds . as previously reported immature seeds of _PROTEIN_ showed strong vanillin signals in small _LOCATION_ like structures . our observations under high magnification showed that vanillin signals in immature seeds of _PROTEIN_ seem to be localized around small _LOCATION_ . this phenotype differed somewhat from a previous report where _PROTEIN_ showed a dispersed phenotype for _PROTEIN_ derivatives . this difference may result from differences in the background of each _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the vanillin reaction was only restricted outside the _LOCATION_ . in an effort to determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ derivatives more precisely immature seeds were fixed sectioned into _PROTEIN_ slices and then stained with toluidine blue o . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ derivatives was clearly detected within the endothelial cells in each genotype confirming the results of the vanillin staining . in _PROTEIN_ tbo signals were observed within small _LOCATION_ like structures . in _PROTEIN_ tbo signals were _PROTEIN_ detected at peripheral regions of _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tbo signals were also detected outside the small _LOCATION_ . in immature seeds of the flavonoid less mutant the absence of red vanillin signals and blue tbo signals in endothelial cells has previously been reported . to further characterize the _PROTEIN_ phenotype with respect to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells immature seeds were observed by differential interference contrast microscopy . the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds showed unique _LOCATION_ like _PROTEIN_ structures in their endothelial cells . these structures were not detected in immature seeds of the wild type columbia or in other tt mutants such as and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ structures seemed to be similar in size and number to the _PROTEIN_ containing structures detected by vanillin staining . to confirm this _PROTEIN_ immature seeds were sequentially observed using a phase contrast microscope without staining and then observed following vanillin treatment . the patterns of the _PROTEIN_ structures and the vanillin staining were identical . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ structures in _PROTEIN_ accumulate _PROTEIN_ derivatives . in order to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ structures in _PROTEIN_ are surrounded by a _LOCATION_ a fusion of _METHOD_ with the _PROTEIN_ transporter _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was ectopically _PROTEIN_ by the camv promoter . it was confirmed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were localized in endomembranes like tonoplasts in roots of the transformants and could complement the _PROTEIN_ less phenotype of _PROTEIN_ endothelial cells . however it was difficult to determine the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in endothelial cells when immature seeds were observed on whole mounts . then immature seeds were dissected and the exposed endothelial cells were observed with _PROTEIN_ . we found that the _PROTEIN_ structures in _PROTEIN_ were outlined with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to obtain further evidence _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ promoter which makes it possible to trace specifically the tonoplast of the endothelial cells in immature seeds . by releasing the _PROTEIN_ structures gently from immature seeds of the transformants clear _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected at the perimeter of the _PROTEIN_ structures in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ structure in _PROTEIN_ is a small _LOCATION_ harboring _PROTEIN_ derivatives and is surrounded with _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ proteins . the _LOCATION_ like _PROTEIN_ structures harboring _PROTEIN_ derivatives in _PROTEIN_ immature seeds were quite marked and were only detected in endothelial cells . these findings prompted us to speculate that the composition and/or conformation of the _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ differed between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . to investigate this _PROTEIN_ were extracted from immature seeds and then analyzed by acid hydrolysis . generally most _PROTEIN_ are solvent soluble at the immature stage of seed development and are gradually insolubilized with the progression of maturation . in immature seeds _PROTEIN_ of the col ecotype the quantity of solvent soluble _PROTEIN_ was quite high compared with that of insoluble _PROTEIN_ consistent with a previous report on the ws ecotype . in contrast _PROTEIN_ immature seeds showed specific characteristics solvent insoluble _PROTEIN_ were markedly higher compared with col . by introducing a mutation of the _PROTEIN_ structural genes such as leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background we confirmed that this high level of solvent insoluble _PROTEIN_ was absent . immature seeds of _PROTEIN_ possessed small quantities of solvent soluble and insoluble _PROTEIN_ . the levels of solvent insoluble _PROTEIN_ were markedly lower in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant whereas slightly higher but significant levels of insoluble _PROTEIN_ were found in the double mutant compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . in an effort to characterize the metabolites in greater detail solvent soluble extracts from immature seeds were analyzed by lc _METHOD_ and comprehensive metabolic profiles were obtained . principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis with about peaks showed clear similarities among triplicate samples for each genotype . of these peaks that could be assigned as representing known compounds or which could be detected as different values for the content among the genotypes were selected . there were no marked differences in the metabolic profiles between mature seeds of col and _PROTEIN_ . however with immature seeds _PROTEIN_ differences in metabolic profiles among the genotypes were detected as described below . with respect to _PROTEIN_ derivatives col contains high levels of _PROTEIN_ precursors such as epicatechins and their oligomers . in _PROTEIN_ only reduced levels of epicatechin monomers and short oligomers were detected with no longer oligomers being detected . previously unknown _PROTEIN_ derivatives such as epicatechin hexosides were detected in _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ there are no known _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ precursors such as epicatechin epicatechin hexoside or procyanidin _PROTEIN_ . the metabolic profile of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . five metabolites without annotation information showed differences in the content among the genotypes . unknown and were uniquely detected in immature col whereas unknown and were found in immature _PROTEIN_ . the latter two compounds were also found in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . for other flavonoid subclasses such as flavonols there were no differences in the content among each genotype . information about the metabolites represented in figure is shown in table .
