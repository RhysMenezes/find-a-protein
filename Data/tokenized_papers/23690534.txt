plant nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat proteins serve as intracellular sensors to detect pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses . transcription of the nb lrr encoding resistance genes needs to be tightly controlled to avoid inappropriate defense activation . how the _PROTEIN_ of the nb lrr r genes is regulated is poorly understood . the arabidopsis suppressor of _PROTEIN_ constitutive _PROTEIN_ mutant carries a gain of function mutation in a receptor like _PROTEIN_ nb lrr encoding gene resulting in the constitutive activation of plant defense responses . a _PROTEIN_ suppressor screen identified modifier of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . positional cloning revealed that _PROTEIN_ encodes a plant specific protein of unknown function . _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is required for the full _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ nb lrr protein encoding recognition of peronospora _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both of which reside in the _PROTEIN_ cluster . coimmunoprecipitation and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ associates with the _PROTEIN_ class lysine of histone methyltransferase arabidopsis trithorax _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also required for the full _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and the autoimmune phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is similarly reduced and resistance against hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis is compromised . consistent with the attenuated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ trimethylated marks are reduced around the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants . our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions together with _PROTEIN_ to regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ through methylation which plays an important role in fine tuning their transcription levels and functions in plant defense .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified from a suppressor screen of _PROTEIN_ single mutant . the size of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plant is much bigger than that of _PROTEIN_ but still exhibits _PROTEIN_ like twisted leaves . quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that the elevated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is largely reduced by _PROTEIN_ although not to wild type levels . the free and total salicylic acid content in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants was lower when compared with that of _PROTEIN_ plants but still higher than those of the wild type . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants were _PROTEIN_ with the virulent oomycete pathogen ha or the bacterial pathogen psm they produced more spores and supported more bacterial growth than _PROTEIN_ plants but not to the level of the wild type . taken together _PROTEIN_ partially suppresses all autoimmune phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . to identify the molecular lesion in _PROTEIN_ that leads to the suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was crossed with ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ introgressed _PROTEIN_ . linkage analysis on plants that had lost the _PROTEIN_ morphology revealed that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located on the top arm of chromosome between markers and . further mapping with over plants narrowed the _PROTEIN_ mutation to the region between markers and . unfortunately with this population we could not narrow the region beyond this kb region . to further resolve the position of the _PROTEIN_ mutation we transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with a set of overlapping transformation competent artificial chromosome clones covering the kb region . only one clone complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . by subtracting the regions covered by the noncomplementing clones from the _PROTEIN_ lesion could be confined to a small region containing six candidate genes . because _PROTEIN_ was identified from a fast neutron mutagenized population and fast neutron induces deletion mutations the coding sequences of these candidate genes were amplified from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to test whether any of them has been deleted in the mutant . two genes _GENE_ and _GENE_ could not be pcr amplified from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ contains a deletion mutation affecting both genes . direct transgenic complementation using the genomic region of _GENE_ or _GENE_ driven by their native promoter was used to test which gene is _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure d and e only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants carrying _GENE_ exhibited _PROTEIN_ like morphology and enhanced resistance against ha . of transgenic lines carrying _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ like morphology indicating that _GENE_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ defects . together with the complementation data from clone we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is _GENE_ . sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ revealed that it encodes a plant specific protein of amino acids with no discernible motifs or domains . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has a remote paralog . _PROTEIN_ and seem to be evolving independently and at different rates with _PROTEIN_ evolving faster than . _PROTEIN_ homologs in other plant species including arabidopsis lyrata are more divergent while those of are highly conserved . a survey of coding regions of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis accessions revealed that there are at least alleles present in the population containing polymorphic sites of which are nonsynonymous changes resulting in amino acid substitutions . by contrast shows seven alleles with six polymorphic sites only two of which lead to amino acid substitutions . codeml analysis indicates that two of the individual amino acid residues in _PROTEIN_ could be positively selected under positive selection model with posterior probabilities and respectively . however there was no indication of positive selection in . to obtain the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was crossed with wild type col plants . lines homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and the wild type for _PROTEIN_ were selected as the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ is morphologically indistinguishable from wild type plants . to test whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to basal defense against virulent pathogens _PROTEIN_ plants were _PROTEIN_ with psm at a concentration of optical density at nm of . wild type plants usually develop no disease _METHOD_ at this low dose d after infiltration . like wild type plants _PROTEIN_ plants support similar bacterial growth d after inoculation whereas the susceptible control col _PROTEIN_ carries times more bacteria . therefore _PROTEIN_ does not seem to contribute to basal resistance . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is required for resistance mediated by other _PROTEIN_ type r proteins we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants with ha isolates and and pseudomonas syringae pv tomato carrying that can be recognized by _PROTEIN_ type nlrs _PROTEIN_ and resistance to p.s.t . _PROTEIN_ respectively . resistance mediated by _PROTEIN_ is compromised in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ supported growth of approximately spores per seedling while less than spores were observed on the wild type . however resistance mediated by _PROTEIN_ and is not affected in _PROTEIN_ plants . another large class of plant nlrs is the cc type . to test whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to resistance mediated by cc type nlrs we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants with p.s.t . carrying the avirulent effectors avrpphb or that can be recognized by plant cc type nlrs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . as shown in supplemental figure b to d _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants were as resistant as wild type col plants when _PROTEIN_ with bacterial pathogens carrying these avirulent effectors . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not contribute to resistance mediated by these cc type nlr proteins . because _PROTEIN_ only affects resistance responses mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . as shown in figure the steady state _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ is reduced in _PROTEIN_ single mutant whereas that of _PROTEIN_ is about in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant as that in _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ single mutant remains lower than that in wild type plants even after pathogen _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ the steady state and the induced _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are also reduced in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants . these data suggest that mutation in _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . alternatively the steady state and the pathogen induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ are similar to that of wild type plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ has no effect on the transcription of these r genes . because protein sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ yielded very little information we first investigated its subcellular localization . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ by its native promoter and with _METHOD_ fused to its c terminus . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully complemented mutant phenotypes associated with the _PROTEIN_ mutation and _PROTEIN_ plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct restored resistance against ha . this suggests that the construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes and functions as the wild type _PROTEIN_ in planta . whereas _METHOD_ alone under constitutive promoter control was localized everywhere inside the cell weak _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was mostly detected inside the _LOCATION_ in both root cells guard cells and leaf pavement cells . because we could not exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ also localizes to other cellular compartments we also carried out subcellular fractionation on complementing _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal can be detected in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ depleted fractions . taken together _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be a protein predominantly localizing to the _LOCATION_ . to better understand how _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we searched for _PROTEIN_ associating proteins by affinity purification and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . because a large portion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is located inside the _LOCATION_ the affinity purification experiment was carried out on the _LOCATION_ fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants using anti _METHOD_ microbeads . a _LOCATION_ fraction of wild type plants was used as negative control . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by silver staining showed that two proteins one about kd and the other about kd copurified with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bait protein . _METHOD_ analysis showed that the large protein is _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ class methylase of kd and the smaller protein is high chlorophyll _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a protein with weak similarities to the short chain dehydrogenases/reductases . both proteins were not detected in the wild type control sample . because _PROTEIN_ localizes to the chloroplasts it is likely a false positive interactor from chloroplast contamination . we therefore focused our further analysis on _PROTEIN_ . methyltransferases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for proper activation of _PROTEIN_ through methylation . the identification of _PROTEIN_ as a protein associated with _PROTEIN_ prompted us to test whether _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . we first introduced _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ to determine whether a mutation in _PROTEIN_ can suppress _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ not only partially suppresses the stunted growth morphology of _PROTEIN_ but also suppresses the enhanced disease resistance of _PROTEIN_ against the virulent oomycete pathogen ha . the suppression of enhanced disease resistance of _PROTEIN_ is also reflected by reduced _PROTEIN_ and pr gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ paralog _PROTEIN_ can not suppress the stunted growth morphology or the autoimmune phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for full _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated autoimmunity . consistent with reduced transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels were reduced in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds when compared with that of _PROTEIN_ plants . similar reduction in _PROTEIN_ protein level was also observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . we further tested whether _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ mediated disease resistance against ha . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ mutant plants supported much higher growth of ha than the wild type . the susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ is similar to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . the growth of ha is similar to that in _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly when the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants were _PROTEIN_ with ha no additive effect is observed the growth of the oomycete is similar to that in the single mutants . these data suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the same biological process relating to immunity . this is consistent with the earlier biochemical data that _PROTEIN_ is able to pull down _PROTEIN_ and they seem to function together in a protein complex . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is also reduced in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ results in compromised resistance to ha in _PROTEIN_ . suppression of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ and similar susceptibility to ha in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant when compared with that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function together in the same genetic pathway in regulating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance . because methylation is correlated with transcriptional activation and _PROTEIN_ functions as a trimethyltransferase we further investigated whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the regulation of levels in the promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assays using an antibody that specifically recognizes marks . real time pcr was carried out on the dna samples from the _PROTEIN_ assays using primers specific to dna close to the start codon of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the amount of the housekeeping gene is similarly pulled down in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants in chromatin immunoprecipitated samples using both and antibodies indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not affect general marks . however with _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reduced marks were observed in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with that of the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ contributes to the level of trimethylation at these loci .
all plants were grown at under a h h night regime . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified from a fast neutron treated _PROTEIN_ mutant population previously described . in brief the population of fast neutron treated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was first screened for suppression of _PROTEIN_ s dwarf and stunted growth morphology . these putative mutants were further tested for suppression of constitutive defense phenotype of _PROTEIN_ by carrying out gus staining . mutants that showed reduced or no gus staining were studied further . gene _PROTEIN_ analysis was carried out by extracting rna from week
