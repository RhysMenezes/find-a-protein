serine/arginine rich _PROTEIN_ proteins constitute an important class of splicing regulators in higher eukaryotes that share a modular structure consisting of one or two n terminal rna recognition motif domains and a c terminal rs rich domain . herein we have investigated the in vivo functional distribution of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . agrobacterium mediated transient transformation revealed _LOCATION_ speckled distribution and the overall colocalization of _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both tobacco and arabidopsis cells . their overall colocalization in larger nucleoplasmic domains was further observed after transcriptional and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation inhibition indicating a close functional association between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ independent of their phosphorylation state . furthermore we demonstrated in vivo the conserved role of the rs and rrm domains in the efficient targeting of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins to _LOCATION_ speckles by using a series of structural domain deleted mutants of _PROTEIN_ and . we suggest additional roles of rs domain such as the shuttling of between nucleoplasm and nucleolus through its phosphorylation level . the coexpression of deletion mutants with wild type _PROTEIN_ proteins revealed potential complex associations between them . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching demonstrated similar dynamic properties of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both tobacco transiently _PROTEIN_ cells and arabidopsis transgenics . cell cycle phase dependent organization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins was observed in living tobacco by cells . we showed that _PROTEIN_ is degraded at metaphase by _METHOD_ quantification . _PROTEIN_ proteins also localized within small foci at anaphase . these results demonstrate interesting related features as well as potentially important differences between plant and animal _PROTEIN_ proteins .

arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum seeds were sown on soil in a culture chamber and allowed to germinate and grow under long day conditions at approximately . arabidopsis plants with well developed leaf rosette and cm high tobacco plants were used for agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ . tobacco by cells were grown at by weekly dilution in fresh by medium consisting of of murashige and skoog _METHOD_ salts supplemented with sucrose mg myo inositol thiamine hcl dichlorophenoxy acetic acid adjusted to ph with m koh . by cells were _PROTEIN_ in the dark with continuous shaking . extraction of total rna was carried out by the hot phenol method and licl precipitation as described previously . the rna pellet was dissolved in mm tris hcl ph and mm edta after ethanol precipitation . poly mrna was purified with the oligotex mrna kit . rt pcr amplification was performed on either of total rna or of poly mrna by using powerscript with oligo d primer . the resulting cdnas were used as templates for pcr amplification with gene specific primers or modified primers for subsequent cloning in binary vectors . the construction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was described in a previous report . for all constructs coding sequences were amplified from the appropriate source by pcr using the proofreading pfu polymerase _METHOD_ fusions with different deletions in the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence were constructed as follows . the coding sequences of the chimeric mutants _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were amplified directly from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the blunt ended smai binary vector carrying the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter/terminator . the coding sequences of and were amplified from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the coding sequence of _METHOD_ was amplified from _METHOD_ with the primer gaagatctatggtgagcaagggcgaggag containing a bglii site and the primer ttacttgtacagctcgtccatgc . the resulting pcr fragments were digested with bglii and ligated . the chimeric gene was then amplified and cloned into . as selection of by cell transformants could not be performed based on glufosinate ammonium resistance the vector was subsequently used for further transformations . plasmid carrying a camv _PROTEIN_ nopaline synthase _PROTEIN_ cassette with a kanamycin resistance gene as a selectable marker for plant cell transformation was first digested with bamhi and ssti to remove the gus coding sequence generating . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was cloned into pbi yielding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to study the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ multiple _METHOD_ imaging was performed by using m _METHOD_ . for the construction of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was amplified using the primer _PROTEIN_ containing a kpni site and the primer containing an ssti site and for _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ coding sequence was amplified from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . was amplified by rt pcr using the primer containing a bamhi site and the primer _PROTEIN_ containing a kpni site . the amplified fragments were then digested with kpni and ligated . the chimeric gene was then pcr amplified and cloned into pbi . we followed the same approach for the construction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by using the _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by using the _PROTEIN_ specific primers . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ sequence was amplified by rt pcr _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ sequence was amplified with _PROTEIN_ containing an xbai site and _PROTEIN_ containing a kpni site . the resulting pcr products were digested with kpni and ligated . the chimeric sequence was then amplified digested with xbai and cloned into pbi . in the resulting vector designated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is fused to the c terminal end of _METHOD_ . the resultant plasmids were electroporated into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and subsequently used for transformations . independent clones were sequenced to detect any mutation caused by pcr . the smart prediction program was used for domain prediction and their precise location . transient transformation in tobacco and arabidopsis leaves was performed essentially as described previously . briefly a. tumefaciens bearing the appropriate binary vector was grown at overnight in ml yeb liquid medium supplemented with gentamycin rifampicin and kanamycin . after centrifugation the bacteria were washed with infiltration medium _PROTEIN_ and then resuspended in the same medium at the desired final . leaves were infiltrated using a ml syringe by applying gentle pressure through the stomata of the abaxial epidermis . for coexpression various co inoculation experiments and agrobacterium densities were tested on tobacco . the most efficient cell cotransformation was obtained with inocula of ranging between and high inoculum densities prevented transformation . inoculated plants were then incubated under normal growth conditions . the infiltrated areas were cut at h after inoculation and further processed for imaging or inhibitor treatments . arabidopsis plant transformation was performed as described previously . transgenic plants were selected on plates containing sterile solidified _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose and glufosinate ammonium . after days of growth transformants were planted directly into soil at the two leaf stage to obtain and progeny . stable transformation and synchronization of by cells was performed essentially as described previously . briefly ml of a day old cell culture were distributed into a petri dish and ml of an overnight agrobacterium culture containing the binary vector of interest was added . after days of coincubation at by cells were washed three times with ml of by medium and plated onto sterile solidified by medium supplemented with kanamycin and _PROTEIN_ . plates were incubated for weeks at until transformed calli were visible . transgenic calli were screened for their _PROTEIN_ using confocal microscopy and selected cell colonies were further transferred onto new selective plates . fragments of transiently transformed leaves were used for inhibitor treatments as described previously . leaf tissues were floated in amanitin nm okadaic acid staurosporine or water as control for various time periods . the subcellular localization of phosphorylated rnap ii c terminal domain was determined using mouse monoclonal antibodies . the antibodies mark the rnap ii phosphorylated at serine of the ctd of the largest rnap ii subunit . for _METHOD_ analysis fragments of arabidopsis and tobacco leaf cells were fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde in pem buffer _PROTEIN_ and washed two times with pem supplemented with triton x . the cells were incubated in driselase cellulase and pectinase for h at room temperature . after washing in triton x pem cells were then incubated for h with a blocking solution consisting of bsa normal goat serum in _PROTEIN_ at room temperature . fixed cells were incubated overnight with antibodies at a dilution of . after washing primary antibodies were detected using fitc or alexa conjugated goat anti mouse antibody at dilution of and respectively with an incubation time of at least h. _LOCATION_ were counterstained with dapi . for _METHOD_ microscopy images were captured with a nikon coolpix digital camera . for confocal imaging images were acquired using a leica tcs inverted confocal laser microscope _METHOD_ equipped with one argon and two helium neon lasers . digitized images were acquired using a plan apo water immersion objective at pixel resolution . the diameter of the pinhole was set up equal to the airy unit . series of optical sections were carried out to analyse the spatial distribution of _METHOD_ and for each _LOCATION_ they were recorded with a z step ranging between and . images were acquired under identical conditions and we ensured that the maximal _METHOD_ signal was not saturating the photomultiplier tubes . for multicolour imaging _METHOD_ was visualized by using an excitation wavelength of nm and the emission light was dispersed and recorded at nm . _METHOD_ was detected by using an excitation wavelength of and the dichroic mirror and the _METHOD_ emission was dispersed and recorded at nm . the acquisition was set up to avoid any crosstalk of the two _METHOD_ emissions . to quantify the _METHOD_ lines were drawn through the _LOCATION_ by using leica software . the _METHOD_ intensities along this line represented by a graph profile provide data on the relative concentration of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the subnuclear compartments . after a period of observation of over h abnormal localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins was observed possibly due to experimental stress such as hypoxia followed by _PROTEIN_ depletion and/or cold temperature . our system does not bear a temperature control unit or objective heaters and as well known the objective and the optical coupling medium act as a thermal conductive object/medium sinking heat away from the specimen . to perform frap experiments transgenics arabidopsis seedlings and tobacco leaf fragments stably and transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively were mounted in water and observed using the nm line of the argon laser in conjunction with a plan apo na oil immersion objective . _LOCATION_ were imaged at medium resolution of pixels . using the extended time lapse function pre bleach images were acquired by sequentially scanning the same optical section through the _LOCATION_ at low laser power . next the laser was zoomed in square areas with power increased to and the area was scanned four to six times until the _METHOD_ was significantly reduced . the laser was zoomed out and its power reduced to pre bleach settings . recovery of _METHOD_ intensity was monitored by scanning the _LOCATION_ until the recovery reached a steady plateau . _LOCATION_ areas ranging from to corresponding approximately to of the surface of the _LOCATION_ were bleached and recovery rates did not appear to be dependent on the size of the bleached region . we ensure that post bleach imaging did not result in significant loss of _METHOD_ over time . the values of the bleached areas were then normalized and further analysed by using graphpad prism and non linear sigmoidal regression . for quantification of _METHOD_ in by cells the maximum _METHOD_ intensity was first determined by scanning different stages of the cell cycle and we ensured that this maximal _METHOD_ signal was not saturating the pmt . z series of _LOCATION_ and metaphase cells were then collected keeping constant all parameters . the _METHOD_ intensities of individual optical sections were quantified by delineating the _LOCATION_ or the cytoplasm using leica software . on the basis of the collected image stacks _METHOD_ intensities were averaged to produce a mean _METHOD_ intensity for each cell and the pixel value per unit area was calculated . these values were averaged within groups for the various mitotic stages and standard _LOCATION_ were calculated in microsoft excel . the average value calculated for the interphase cells was set as and the other values were _PROTEIN_ relative to this . for comparison quantification was also performed on an average projection for each of the series collected . the average pixel intensity of confocal reconstructions of either the entire _LOCATION_ or the entire metaphase cell was measured using leica software and the pixel values per were averaged for each stage of the cell cycle . captured images were exported as tiff format files and further processed using adobe photoshop for figure mounting and labelling purposes .
