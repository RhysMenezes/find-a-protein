phytohormone salicylic acid is a crucial component of plant induced defense against biotrophic pathogens . although the key players of the sa pathway are known there are still gaps in the understanding of the molecular mechanism and the regulation of particular steps . in our previous research we showed in arabidopsis suspension cells that n butanol which specifically modulates phospholipase d activity significantly suppresses the transcription of the pathogenesis related gene which is generally accepted as the sa pathway marker . in the presented study we have investigated the site of n butanol action in the sa pathway . we were able to show in arabidopsis plants treated with sa that n butanol inhibits the transcription of defense genes _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ microscopy of arabidopsis thaliana mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed significantly _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of n butanol . on the other hand n butanol did not _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ monomers . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of plant extracts showed that n butanol significantly changes the metabolic fingerprinting while t butanol had no effect . we found groups of the plant metabolites influenced differently by sa and n butanol treatment . thus we proposed several metabolites as markers for n butanol action .
the increased levels of sa or exogenous treatment with this phytohormone activates the signaling pathway resulting in the transcription of defense related genes . the generally accepted marker of sa signaling is the pr gene . in order to examine possible role of _PROTEIN_ in this process we co treated day old seedlings of a. thaliana with both sa and increasing concentrations of n butanol . the sa induced pr transcription was _PROTEIN_ in the presence of n butanol in a strongly dose dependent manner . contrarily the t butanol showed no effect on the pr transcription . effect of n butanol on sa related genes transcription . ten day old a. thaliana seedlings were treated for h with nasa and n butanol . day old a. thaliana seedlings were treated for h with n butanol and t butanol or with nasa together with the above mentioned alcohols . pure _METHOD_ was used as a control . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ from three biological repeats . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to nasa treated plants without n butanol for . different letters indicate significant differences and were calculated with one way _PROTEIN_ and fisher 's lsd test . transcription was normalized to a reference gene sand . we also examined the effect of both alcohols on the transcription of other sa related genes _PROTEIN_ and both encoding proteins with different functions . while the pr protein is responsible for a direct antimicrobial effect as the end product of sa pathway _PROTEIN_ is a transcription _PROTEIN_ which negatively regulates pr transcription but it is _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ . is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of sa to a less biologically active compound gentisic acid . _PROTEIN_ and transcriptions were not as significantly blocked as pr transcription . the relative transcription of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only two times and even less in the case of . also the dose dependence of the n butanol effect on the transcription of these two genes was far less apparent . we further intended to take a closer look at the site of n butanol action in the sa signaling pathway . to decipher we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a. thaliana transgenic plants . it was confirmed earlier that the treatment of these mutants with dichloroisonicotinic acid a functional analog of sa causes monomerization of _PROTEIN_ which is afterwards accumulated in the plant cell _LOCATION_ . we treated day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a. thaliana seedlings with nasa and observed a significant increase of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ the same effect was described for ina treatment . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ in the presence of nasa _PROTEIN_ after addition of n butanol . when t butanol was applied as a negative control no effect on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in the _LOCATION_ was observed . n butanol alone _PROTEIN_ the basal accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in the control plants while no effect was observed for t butanol . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was verified by dapi staining . all these results correlate with the aforementioned pr transcription analysis . consequently we wanted to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ amount of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ caused by n butanol is due to the higher actvity of proteasomes in _PROTEIN_ degradation . for this experiment we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ constitutively monomerized _PROTEIN_ which is overaccumulated in the _LOCATION_ . the treatment of these mutants with and n butanol did not _PROTEIN_ the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . this experiment also provides evidence that n butanol does not influence _METHOD_ intensity . effect of sa and n butanol on the localization of _PROTEIN_ . ten day old seedlings of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants were treated for h with fresh _METHOD_ medium n butanol t butanol nasa nasa and n butanol or t butanol . representative micrographs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a. thaliana seedlings h after treatment image analysis of relative _METHOD_ using aps assess software . the values represent means _PROTEIN_ from images . different letters indicate significant differences and were calculated with one way _PROTEIN_ and fisher 's lsd test . the experiment was performed in three biological replicates with similar results . effects of n butanol on the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis thaliana mutants constitutively _PROTEIN_ monomers of _PROTEIN_ . ten day old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a. thaliana mutants were treated h with fresh _METHOD_ medium n butanol and n butanol . representative images of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a. thaliana seedlings h after treatment image analysis of relative _METHOD_ using aps assess software . the values represent means _PROTEIN_ from images . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control non treated plants . the experiment was performed in two biological replicates with similar results . zhang et al . showed that _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is required for sa accumulation _PROTEIN_ transcription and sa tolerance . when _PROTEIN_ was retained in the cytoplasm plants accumulated higher levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts compared to the wild type . based on this we measured the transcription of _PROTEIN_ upon the addition of the n butanol treatment and as expected n butanol induced _PROTEIN_ transcription in a dose dependent manner while t butanol had no effect . these results support our suggestion that n butanol inhibits the translocation of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ . accordingly we also found that the _PROTEIN_ transcription in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants were significantly _PROTEIN_ but n butanol treatment partially reverted this effect . transcription of _PROTEIN_ and pr in wild type and mutants of arabidopsis thaliana constitutively _PROTEIN_ monomeric _PROTEIN_ in the presence of n butanol . ten day old a. thaliana seedlings were treated for h with nasa and n butanol . ten day old a. thaliana seedlings were treated for h with n butanol and t butanol or with nasa together with the above mentioned alcohols . ten day old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana mutants were treated for h with fresh _METHOD_ medium or _METHOD_ with n butanol . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ from three independent repeats . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to control non treated plants for . different letters indicate significant differences and were calculated with one way _PROTEIN_ and fisher 's lsd test for . the _PROTEIN_ and pr transcription was normalized to a reference gene sand . as the accumulation of sa leads to the _METHOD_ reprogramming of the plant transcriptome it was obviously accompanied by significant changes in the whole metabolome . we investigated these changes in plants treated with sa and n butanol to test if we could reveal compounds involved in the sa/phospholipid signaling pathway . the principle component analysis represents a highly useful and widely employed tool for the interpretation of complex data sets generated by several modern instruments including _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in our study pca was employed to explore alterations in the metabolomes of differently treated a. thaliana samples measured by lc _METHOD_ as shown in figure there was a significant difference in the metabolomic fingerprints of samples treated with n butanol and untreated ones . the samples treated with sa were clearly differentiated from the untreated samples . the list of the most distinct markers _METHOD_ is summarized in table . obviously sa and its metabolite sa hexoside are typical markers for the samples treated with sa . unfortunately the identification of markers present in n butanol treated plants was mostly unsuccessful _PROTEIN_ due to their high m/z values resulting in many possible elemental formulas and also due to the limited information about the changes induced by n butanol in the metabolism . important observations were that the t butanol treated samples did not differentiate from the untreated samples and also that t butanol had no effect on the sa treated samples . pca
