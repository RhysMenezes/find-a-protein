in arabidopsis monogalactosyldiacylglycerol is synthesized by a multigenic family of mgdg synthases consisting of two types of enzymes differing in their n terminal portion type a and type b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the present paper compares type b _METHOD_ with the enzymes of type a that are known to sit in the inner _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ envelope . the occurrence of types a and b in and plants shows that both types are not specialized _METHOD_ for the prokaryotic and eukaryotic glycerolipid biosynthetic pathways . type a gene is abundantly _PROTEIN_ in green tissues and along plant development and encodes the most active enzyme . its mature polypeptide is immunodetected in the envelope of chloroplasts from arabidopsis leaves after cleavage of its transit peptide . is therefore likely devoted to the _METHOD_ production of mgdg required to expand the inner envelope _LOCATION_ and build up the _LOCATION_ network . transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein fusions in arabidopsis leaves and in vitro import experiments show that type b precursors are targeted to _LOCATION_ owing to a different mechanism . noncanonical addressing peptides whose processing could not be assessed are involved in the targeting of type b precursors possibly to the outer envelope _LOCATION_ where they might contribute to _LOCATION_ expansion . _PROTEIN_ of type b enzymes was higher in nongreen tissues i.e. in inflorescence _PROTEIN_ and roots _PROTEIN_ where they conceivably influence the eukaryotic structure prominence in mgdg . in addition their _PROTEIN_ of type b enzymes is enhanced under phosphate deprivation .
both and _PROTEIN_ sequences were identified from arabidopsis genome sequencing _METHOD_ in chromosomes iv and ii respectively . in addition we screened arabidopsis cdna and genomic libraries and identified a third gene _PROTEIN_ held by chromosome v. unexpectedly long untranslated regions were detected by primer extension analyzes of and _PROTEIN_ respectively at the level of uridine and guanosine upstream to the start codon whereas the _PROTEIN_ end was mapped at the level of adenosine . the positional organization of the eight exons from and _PROTEIN_ are similar . interestingly _PROTEIN_ lacks two introns suggesting that the ancestral sequences for and _PROTEIN_ originated from an early divergence marked by a deep modification of the n terminal region and that _PROTEIN_ likely originated from the duplication of an _PROTEIN_ ancestral sequence . we inserted the cdna fragments corresponding to the mature form of i.e. truncated from its aa chloroplastic transit peptide and the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the pet _PROTEIN_ vector . fig . shows that the e. coli extracts _PROTEIN_ the atmgd cdnas exhibit a galactosylation activity when provided with sn dioleoylglycerol . we checked that the reaction product was mgdg by two dimensional tlc as described . enzymological comparisons require a purification of the properly folded enzymes . in addition mgdg synthases must be extracted from the bacterial lipids to monitor the supply of dag . recombinant e. coli _LOCATION_ were therefore solubilized by mm chaps under conditions defined . the specific activity increased after solubilization by the detergent the enrichment _PROTEIN_ for was whereas it was more than times lower for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and . solubilized fractions were subsequently chromatographed on a hydroxyapatite column under experimental conditions used for the purification of the spinach chloroplast envelope activity . most of the activity loaded on the column was recovered in a sharp peak eluted at mm phosphate with a yield of and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and was used for enzymological comparisons . the two dag molecular species used to compare the specificity of the three mgdg synthases i.e. sn palmitoyl glycerol and sn dilinoleoyl glycerol were chosen as physiologically relevant prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecular species . using the surface dilution model double reciprocal plots drawn for each dag molecular species were linear and used to calculate kinetic constants . the three enzymes are capable of synthesizing both prokaryotic and eukaryotic mgdg . type b enzymes exhibit a higher affinity for eukaryotic dag possibly generated from extraplastidial glycerolipids than for the molecular species abundantly produced inside the _LOCATION_ . by contrast the purified recombinant does not select the given substrates . considering vmax and km values of the purified recombinant proteins was the most active . vmax value is about five times higher than the values calculated for purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in addition used its substrates with the highest affinity km values were about mol fraction for all substrates and were therefore lower than the best km values measured with for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the enzymatic properties of the three _METHOD_ may reflect a functional specialization to the dag molecular species available in the _LOCATION_ where the enzymes sit . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit any canonical chloroplastic transit peptide we first investigated whether the full length polypeptides contained functional addressing signals . fig . fig ref shows the green _METHOD_ emitted by _METHOD_ fusion proteins transiently _PROTEIN_ in cells of arabidopsis leaves observed by a confocal microscope . chloroplasts were visualized by chlorophyll _METHOD_ and appear in red at the periphery of cells . without any fusion _METHOD_ was localized randomly in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ whereas the n terminal fusion to the transit peptide of the rubisco small subunit led to an accumulated _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . the full length fused to the _METHOD_ is addressed to the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as expected from the presence of a aa n terminal region similar to the cleaved chloroplastic transit peptide of and . likewise the transient _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric cdnas led to an accumulated green _METHOD_ in chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . together these results indicate that the primary sequences of all three mgdg synthase precursors are sufficient to be addressed to _LOCATION_ . in addition when incubated with chloroplasts isolated from pea leaves radiolabeled precursors from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bound to chloroplasts . the precursor was processed into a polypeptide of kda and was subsequently protected from proteolytic treatment with thermolysin . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the precursor binding to chloroplasts was strong and we could not detect any cleavage product . after thermolysin treatment when the full length precursor of was completely hydrolyzed a slight part of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labeled proteins was found resistant to proteolysis . these results indicated that precursors of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were imported into chloroplasts confirming _METHOD_ fusion experiments . to localize the various mgdg synthases in cell subfractions we prepared antibodies against each isoform . fig . fig ref a and b shows western blot analyses made to estimate the cross reactivity of the polyclonal antibodies . very surprisingly although the three proteins are very similar polyclonal antibodies proved to be specific of the mgdg synthase against which it was produced suggesting that immunogenic epitopes occurred mostly in nonconserved regions . western blot analyzes carried out on total protein extract of different tissues of arabidopsis did not allow any detection of mgdg synthases . we sought whether any mgdg synthase could be detected in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ purified from arabidopsis and developed to that purpose a procedure yielding of purified chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ proteins by using g of fresh arabidopsis leaves . fig . fig ref c and d shows a western blot analysis of the polypeptides of arabidopsis chloroplast envelope stroma and _LOCATION_ . accuracy of the subcellular fractionation was assessed by detection of _PROTEIN_ a marker for the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . a polypeptide whose apparent molecular _METHOD_ corresponds to the predicted mature was detected in the envelope . by contrast fig . fig refd does not show any immunodetection of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . these results show that occurs abundantly in the envelope from leaf chloroplasts whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are either very minor or completely absent in this tissue . we analyzed the mrna _PROTEIN_ levels of the three genes in major organs from arabidopsis adult plants . nonsaturated conditions for rt pcr were set to achieve quantitative assays . as shown in fig . fig refa transcripts were dominantly detected in all organs examined with little variations besides a lesser _PROTEIN_ in siliques and a bare detection in seeds . by contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were lower and detected especially in floral buds and roots respectively . distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns were noticed along arabidopsis seedling development . on one hand _PROTEIN_ was detected dominantly throughout whole developmental stages whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was low and continuous . on the other hand mrna _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was most abundant in early stages being quantitatively equal to that of . interestingly under conditions of lowest _PROTEIN_ of i.e. in roots and day plants the level of _PROTEIN_ of type a is rather almost equal to that of type b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . recently et al . described the accumulation of dgdg in extrachloroplast _LOCATION_ in response to phosphate deprivation . assuming that dgdg synthesis by this pathway requires mgdg synthesis we compared _PROTEIN_ of each mgd gene in plants grown under various phosphate concentrations . we observed that _PROTEIN_ remained almost constant whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ increased under phosphate deprivation . these results indicate that type b enzymes could be devoted to a mgdg synthesis during phosphate deprivation and feed the dgdg synthesis presumed to replace missing phospholipids in extrachloroplast _LOCATION_ . the data collected in this study suggest that in arabidopsis both type a and b enzymes can monitor mgdg synthesis from dag originated either from the prokaryotic or eukaryotic pathways being partially influential on the mgdg molecular species produced . we wondered whether the existence of type b was unique to arabidopsis especially if this type was also found in plants . a basic blast screening _PROTEIN_ of the genbank _PROTEIN_ sequence tag database dbest using _PROTEIN_ as a probe shows that members of type b mgdg synthases exist in numerous plant species . fig . fig refa shows a multalin local alignment of aa portions of the presently cloned full length mgdg synthase sequences with screened ests . the corresponding phenogram shows that the identified type a and b enzymes cluster in two distinct groups . assuming that conserved amino acids in type a mgdg synthases which are not conserved in type b are signatures of type a this analysis shows an occurrence of type a in soybean tomato and barley . vice versa type b specific amino acids appear in soybean and lotus . soybean is an example of a plant harboring both types of mgdg synthases . therefore occurrence of both types a and b does not correlate with the classification according to the glycerolipid metabolism i.e. coexistence of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways in plants and loss of the prokaryotic pathway in plants . fig . fig refc shows the compiled results of local alignments of mgdg synthase ests exhibiting signatures of types a and b . having found ests for mgdg synthases of types a and b in corn the origin of both types precedes at least the monocotyledon divergence .
