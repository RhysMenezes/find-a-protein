phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate _PROTEIN_ is the high energy sulfate donor for sulfation reactions . plants produce some _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ but it is predominantly produced in _LOCATION_ . accordingly _PROTEIN_ has to be provided by _LOCATION_ to serve as a substrate for sulfotransferase reactions in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . we present several lines of evidence that the recently described arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ adp/atp carrier _PROTEIN_ transports _PROTEIN_ across the _LOCATION_ envelope and thus fulfills an additional function of high physiological relevance . transport studies using the recombinant protein revealed that it favors _PROTEIN_ phosphoadenosine phosphate and _PROTEIN_ as substrates thus we named it _PROTEIN_ . the protein could be detected both in the _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ and it is present in _LOCATION_ of autotrophic and heterotrophic tissues . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family in contrast with the known animal _PROTEIN_ transporters which are members of the nucleotide sugar transporter family . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene is regulated by the same myb transcription _PROTEIN_ also regulating the biosynthesis of sulfated secondary metabolites _PROTEIN_ . molecular and physiological analyses of mutant plants indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in several aspects of sulfur metabolism including the biosynthesis of thiols _PROTEIN_ and phytosulfokines .
investigations of the _PROTEIN_ gene family and the observation that _LOCATION_ are the _PROTEIN_ site of _PROTEIN_ synthesis clearly revealed the need for a specific transporter to enable the export of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . such a transporter is important for the provision of _PROTEIN_ for the synthesis of gs and is thus most probably part of gs synthesis network . in search for such a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ exporter in arabidopsis we searched publically available transcriptome profiles for genes coexpressed with genes associated with gs biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . additionally we searched for putative transporters among genes upregulated in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant as almost all genes of the gs biosynthetic network were induced in this mutant . using this approach we identified genes involved in sulfate assimilation _PROTEIN_ metabolism and other gs synthesis related genes but also two candidate transporters . these transporters and their closest homologs were considered as promising candidates due to their properties therefore we tested them for their involvement in gs biosynthesis and potential to transport _PROTEIN_ . the phosphometabolite transporters and are structurally related to _LOCATION_ resident _PROTEIN_ transporters from animals and thus might mediate a similar transport in arabidopsis . both proteins which are named according to their amino acid composition at the putative substrate binding site kvag belong to the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily which also includes the nucleotide sugar transporter family . _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ adp/atp carrier exhibits distinct homology with carriers transporting diverse adenine nucleotides and _PROTEIN_ or aps and thus also represents an interesting _PROTEIN_ transporter candidate . first we analyzed whether or not the steady state mrna levels of these candidate genes were affected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . these two myb transcription _PROTEIN_ are the _PROTEIN_ regulators of indolic and aliphatic gs biosynthesis respectively . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ steady state transcript level was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines compared with the wild type . this was not the case for the phosphometabolite transporters and and the _PROTEIN_ homolog _GENE_ . furthermore the ability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to trans activate candidate promoters was analyzed in cotransformation assays . cultured arabidopsis columbia cells were infiltrated with an agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carrying the regulators of gs biosynthesis as effector and different reporter constructs containing the uida _PROTEIN_ reporter gene driven by two different lengths of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . arabidopsis cells transiently _PROTEIN_ both reporter and effector constructs showed significantly increased gus activity for both promoter constructs demonstrating the ability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to trans activate the _PROTEIN_ gene . as a positive control the promoter of the _PROTEIN_ gene was used which has been recently shown to represent a target for _PROTEIN_ . conversely the promoters of the phosphometabolite transporters and and _GENE_ do not seem to be targeted by these transcription _PROTEIN_ . as a negative control the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used which is not involved in the control of biosynthesis of sulfated compounds and which was unable to trans activate both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . together these experiments which have been statistically confirmed in independent biological and technical replicates demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is controlled by gs related transcription _PROTEIN_ and therefore makes it the best candidate to test for function as a _PROTEIN_ transporter . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family and was previously characterized as an adp/atp carrier by _PROTEIN_ and adp transport measurements . for this intact escherichia coli cells were used that _PROTEIN_ the recombinant protein without the n terminal _LOCATION_ targeting sequence . we performed a detailed biochemical investigation of a similarly truncated _PROTEIN_ in the liposomal system to test its ability to transport _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and structurally related molecules . functional reconstitution was performed according to the protocol used for characterization of the adenylate carrier _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis . this involved _PROTEIN_ of the transporter in e. coli cells enrichment and solubilization of inclusion bodies and their functional refolding in presence of lipid/detergent micelles . the _PROTEIN_ protein aggregates were isolated from heterologous host cells solubilized and reconstituted into liposomes . transport studies using radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ revealed significant _PROTEIN_ uptake into _PROTEIN_ and adp preloaded _PROTEIN_ liposomes but no import was measurable with non preloaded proteoliposomes . notably _PROTEIN_ homo exchange _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exceeded the rates of _PROTEIN_ uptake into adp preloaded vesicles . this verifies that _PROTEIN_ is functionally inserted into the lipid vesicles and that it catalyzes a counter exchange of adenine nucleotides . moreover corresponding import of adp was low often instable or hardly detectable therefore adp represents an inferior substrate . this is generally consistent with the results obtained in intact e. coli cells also exhibiting higher rates for _PROTEIN_ than for adp import . it was previously documented that the recombinant _PROTEIN_ is specific for _PROTEIN_ and adp because very high concentrations of these adenine nucleotides but not of adp glc amp _PROTEIN_ or gdp competed with the radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ for uptake . to investigate the substrate spectrum of _PROTEIN_ in more detail and to test whether it can transport _PROTEIN_ we conducted _PROTEIN_ import studies in the presence of moderate excess of different nonlabeled adenine and guanine nucleotides adenine nucleotide derivatives precursors and cofactors . apart from nonlabeled _PROTEIN_ and adp also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and datp significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ uptake into _PROTEIN_ liposomes whereas other molecules like _PROTEIN_ amp or aps did not or only marginally compete with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ import into differently loaded vesicles was analyzed to investigate whether apart from _PROTEIN_ and adp other internally applied molecules can also drive _PROTEIN_ import and thus act as _PROTEIN_ substrates . indeed _PROTEIN_ import was also measurable into _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ preloaded vesicles . highest _PROTEIN_ uptake occurred in exchange with internal _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ followed by _PROTEIN_ whereas internal adp caused only minor transport . aps was unable to drive _PROTEIN_ import as shown by corresponding rates that were in the same range as those observed with nonloaded vesicles . the assays showed apparent ki values for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of to inhibit _PROTEIN_ uptake compared with km values of for _PROTEIN_ and for adp a low affinity substrate . addition of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was required to reduce _PROTEIN_ uptake to _PROTEIN_ . moreover adp apparently is transported with lower maximal velocity when compared with the other substrates . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ preferentially transports _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to extend these observations _PROTEIN_ was heterologously _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . total yeast _LOCATION_ were isolated and reconstituted into liposomes to assess _PROTEIN_ transport characteristics using radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ instead of _PROTEIN_ for import measurements . as shown in table the transport of _PROTEIN_ into the proteoliposomes was absolutely dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ on the opposite side of the _LOCATION_ . table also shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the best transported counter exchange substrates and that adp is accepted with lower efficiency whereas amp does not serve as a _PROTEIN_ substrate . furthermore the kinetic constants for _PROTEIN_ transport were determined in the reconstituted yeast system . the apparent km for _PROTEIN_ was determined to be . the apparent ki values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for the transport of _PROTEIN_ were determined to be similar with values of to . this indicates again that _PROTEIN_ is the preferred substrate of _PROTEIN_ . in accordance with the substrate specificities shown in table the apparent ki value for adp is times higher again demonstrating that adp does not serve as a preferred substrate . taken together we conclude from transport experiments using radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represent the most efficient substrates of _PROTEIN_ whereas adp plays a comparably minor role and aps and amp are not transported . thus _PROTEIN_ can be characterized as a _PROTEIN_ transporter . from now on therefore the _PROTEIN_ is additionally termed _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ for the sake of simplicity hereinafter preferentially referred to as _PROTEIN_ . like typical mcf proteins _PROTEIN_ exhibits six hydrophobic helical regions clearly indicating its localization in a _LOCATION_ environment . the identified substrate preferences particularly the capacity for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transport suggest that _PROTEIN_ not only acts as an adp/atp exchanger in _LOCATION_ as shown previously but might also play a role in the transport of _PROTEIN_ across the envelope _LOCATION_ . the protein possesses an n terminal extension predicted to act as a _LOCATION_ targeting signal . previous studies with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions verified a localization of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts . more detailed immunolocalization studies detected the protein prevalently in _LOCATION_ but to some extent also in the envelope . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was identified as a chloroplast envelope protein in several independent proteome studies . to assess if _PROTEIN_ is indeed localized in chloroplast envelopes we performed targeting analyses of full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions under control of either the endogenous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the cauliflower mosaic virus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ promoter . the constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in cultured arabidopsis root cells arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts and arabidopsis leaves . _METHOD_ was targeted to the _LOCATION_ independent of the used system or promoter . due to the lack of _LOCATION_ structures _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was solely detectable in _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in cultured arabidopsis root cells but was detectable in the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ and presumably also in _LOCATION_ in the assay with mesophyll protoplasts and transfected leaves . the _LOCATION_ triose phosphate/phosphate translocator _PROTEIN_ fused to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ which was used as a positive control for envelope localization was detected in _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ in cultured arabidopsis root cells mesophyll protoplasts and transfected leaves . thus both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed a comparable pattern of _METHOD_ protein distribution in chloroplast envelopes . furthermore the imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll protoplasts and leaves of arabidopsis revealed an overlap of chlorophyll _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ supporting a dual localization of _PROTEIN_ within a chloroplast . altogether our experiments demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is located in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ consistent with its role as a _PROTEIN_ transporter . to allow a more detailed investigation of the organ and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ we performed a _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter gene analysis using three different dna fragments for _PROTEIN_ analysis . two sequences included the first two exons and introns and varied in the putative promoter lengths upstream of the translation initiation codon whereas the third construct comprised the full length genomic dna sequence a bp promoter fragment upstream of the translation initiation codon and the untranslated region region . corresponding sequences were fused with the uida gene plants were stably transformed with the different constructs and gus activity was subsequently analyzed . the intensity of blue staining differed from construct to construct however all plants exhibited similar tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns . highest gus activity resulted from the third construct containing not only the promoter but also the full length _PROTEIN_ gene and the utr region . interestingly considerable promoter activity occurred in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organs of young seedlings and mature plants but was also present in growing tissues like in the shoot apical meristem flower meristem or in root tips . investigation of seed development revealed that in early embryogenesis gus staining was equally distributed in the endosperm and the plant embryo . at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages gus synthesis became relocated and restricted to the embryo and adjacent cells . promoter activity remained high in the embryo during _PROTEIN_ maturation stages and in young seedlings . it should be mentioned that the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ profile generally reflects the pattern of mrna accumulation and _METHOD_ data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . accordingly our analyses further support the assumption that _PROTEIN_ function is not restricted to chloroplasts with fully developed _LOCATION_ but is also required in nondifferentiated or _LOCATION_ free heterotrophic _LOCATION_ present in flowers seeds and roots . after confirming that _PROTEIN_ is capable of _PROTEIN_ transport we were interested whether its disruption affects synthesis of sulfated metabolites . we hypothesized that the consequences of a disruption of the transporter should resemble the effects of low _PROTEIN_ synthesis in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . for the analysis we exploited the homozygous t dna insertion line harboring a t dna insertion in the first intron which showed drastically reduced mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ knockout line _PROTEIN_ in the wassilewskija background . t dna insertions in these homozygous mutant plants named and _PROTEIN_ are depicted in figure . under ambient conditions both mutant lines were slightly retarded in growth compared with corresponding wild type plants . this growth phenotype resembles that of plants lacking the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for gs analysis gs were extracted from freeze dried rosette leaves of week old plants and the levels of _PROTEIN_ aliphatic and indolic gs were determined . both mutant lines exhibited reduced levels of total gs . the line contained and only of met derived gs compared with corresponding wild type plants . however the levels of indolic gs remained almost unaffected . the reduction of gs levels is not as pronounced as in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants in which both aliphatic and indolic gs are affected and total gs levels reach only of wild type levels . mutants of two other candidate _PROTEIN_ transporters and which were rejected based on their _PROTEIN_ pattern and absence in chloroplasts indeed did not show any alteration in gs content . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ connects _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ production with _LOCATION_ gs sulfation reduced _PROTEIN_ supply from the _LOCATION_ differentially affects aliphatic and indolic gs biosynthesis and synthesis of indolic gs is _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ limitation . to gain deeper insights into alterations of gs production we also monitored levels of the desulfo precursors . in wild type plants both aliphatic and indolic desulfo gs were at the detection limit but showed a dramatic accumulation in both mutants . again the levels of desulfo gs in were lower than those in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while desulfo gs could not be detected in and mutants . note that the amounts of gs were much higher in ws than corresponding gs in col which is in agreement with differences in gs profiles of both ecotypes as reported previously . exemplarily the composition of aliphatic gs in ws and col is known to result from different alleles at the mam locus determining the production of various aliphatic gs with different _PROTEIN_ chain lengths interestingly and plants accumulated desulfo precursors of indolic gs despite no differences in the levels of mature metabolites . the observed amount of desulfo gs precursors in the mutant plants was severalfold higher than would correspond to unused substrates and is thus indicative for stimulated gs biosynthesis . indeed similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants quantitative rt pcr analysis revealed that plants lacking _PROTEIN_ exhibited increased _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding gs biosynthetic genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent sulfotransferases and when compared with wild type plants . interestingly disruption of _PROTEIN_ resulted also in a strong increase in mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in yeast fungi and some bacteria _PROTEIN_ is an important intermediate in reductive sulfate assimilation . in plants however aps represents the activated precursor for reduction by aps reductase to sulfite which is then used for synthesis of cys and other sulfur containing compounds including gsh . recent analyses demonstrated that reduced _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants caused a stimulation of sulfate reduction and accumulation of thiols . this indicates that phosphorylation of aps redirects activated sulfate from the reductive pathway into sulfation . it can be hypothesized that an impaired _PROTEIN_ export may lead to accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and hence to a reverse redirection of sulfur from sulfations into primary assimilation . indeed analyses of thiols in rosette leaves revealed that knockout plants contained elevated levels of cys glutamylcysteine and glutathione . apart from synthesis of secondary metabolites sulfation is an important and prevalent posttranslational modification of many secreted proteins and certain _LOCATION_ proteins . posttranslational tyr sulfation occurs also in small secreted peptides that act as signal molecules regulating growth development and differentiation in multicellular _METHOD_ . tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases mediate the sulfate transfer from _PROTEIN_ to tyr residues in propeptides that are finally processed to the active _METHOD_ small secreted peptides . a prominent example is the disulfated pentapeptide phytosulfokine psk . to analyze whether the _PROTEIN_ of psks is affected in the mutant qrt pcr analyses of genes encoding psk precursors were performed . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ levels of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly increased in in comparison to the wild type . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ of these genes is stimulated by a reduced availability of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . furthermore both psk genes were upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacking tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity in the _LOCATION_ apparatus and in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . based on this observation we assume that the increased _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is caused by the reduced accumulation of sulfated peptides rather than the reduced _PROTEIN_ availability .
