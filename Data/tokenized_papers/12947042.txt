malate plays a central role in plant metabolism . it is an intermediate in the krebs and glyoxylate cycles it is the store for _PROTEIN_ in and crassulacean acid metabolism plants it protects plants from aluminum toxicity it is essential for _PROTEIN_ the osmotic pressure and charge balance and it is therefore involved in regulation of stomatal aperture . to fulfil many of these roles malate has to be accumulated within the large central _LOCATION_ . many unsuccessful efforts have been made in the past to identify the _LOCATION_ malate transporter here we describe the identification of the _LOCATION_ malate transporter _PROTEIN_ . this transporter exhibits highest sequence similarity to the human sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter . independent t dna arabidopsis mutants exhibit substantially reduced levels of leaf malate but respire exogenously applied malate faster than the wt . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ isolated from arabidopsis wt leaves exhibited _PROTEIN_ m chlorophenylhydrazone and citrate inhibitable malate transport which was not stimulated by sodium . _LOCATION_ isolated from mutant plants import malate at strongly reduced rates confirming that this protein is the _LOCATION_ malate transporter .
up to now all attempts have failed to identify the molecular nature of the plant _LOCATION_ dicarbonic acid transporter . a biochemical approach to isolate the corresponding protein is extremely hampered by the low number of tonoplast _LOCATION_ usually enriched from plant tissues . interestingly the a. thaliana genome contains on chromosome a single copy of an orf encoding a highly hydrophobic protein that exhibits highest sequence similarity to hsnadc . the putative protein comprises aa in length is predicted to contain transmembrane domains and possesses a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the n terminal domain which extends the arabidopsis protein in comparison with the human homolog does not exhibit signatures typically required for mitochondrial or chloroplastic targeting . the arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ does not exhibit considerable amino acid sequence homology to the dicarbonic acid transport proteins recently identified in plant mitochondria and chloroplast respectively . a northern blot analysis confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding transcript predominantly accumulates in fully developed source leaves followed by sink leaves and stem and flower tissue but it is hardly _PROTEIN_ in roots . this _PROTEIN_ pattern indicates that _PROTEIN_ has a major function in tissues harboring photosynthetically active cells . to obtain a first indication of a physiological function of _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis seedlings were grown for days on agar medium supplemented with increasing malate concentrations and the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were determined . malate caused a strong increase in the _PROTEIN_ mrna in leaves a mm concentration being most effective . this observation gave an experimental indication of a physiological relationship between _PROTEIN_ and dicarboxylic acids . two independent _PROTEIN_ t dna knockout lines were identified in arabidopsis and used to gain insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ in leaves . knockout lines _PROTEIN_ tdna and _PROTEIN_ tdna harbor a t dna insertion at positions and respectively of chromosome . the combination of the _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ allowed amplification of a corresponding pcr product on genomic dna from wt but not on dna from homozygous _PROTEIN_ knockout plants from lines and . a bp junction sequence was amplified in reactions containing the t dna left border primers and _PROTEIN_ on dna from homozygous _PROTEIN_ knockout line but not on dna extracted from wt plants . similarly we screened the second _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant line . the gene specific primer _PROTEIN_ and the left border primer led to the amplification of a pcr product of bp from genomic knockout dna but not in dna from wt plant . the amplified pcr fragments were sequenced to confirm the presence of an _PROTEIN_ sequence and to determine the t dna insertion site . pcr analysis of genomic dna revealed that in both cases homozygous t dna lines had been generated by backcrossing of the heterozygous lines and both homozygous knockout lines lack the _PROTEIN_ transcript as revealed by northern blot analysis and rt pcr . we quantified the total malate levels in leaves from wt and knockout plants . these plants were grown under ambient conditions and were phenotypically indistinguishable . however the malate levels in wt leaves were up to four times higher compared with leaves of the knockout lines . at the beginning of the light period the malate content in leaves was and of malate per gfw in wt and _PROTEIN_ tdna plants respectively . a similar difference was observed during the entire day . at the end of the light period leaf malate content was slightly increased i.e. in wt and of malate per gfw in _PROTEIN_ tdna plants . for _PROTEIN_ tdna essentially similar results were obtained . despite the _PROTEIN_ that wt and _PROTEIN_ knockout lines exhibit essentially the same morphological phenotype under standardized growing conditions they showed a markedly different biochemical phenotype when grown on high sodium chloride concentrations . the application of mm nacl for wk corresponds to significantly increased leaf malate levels . during the day in wt plants the malate concentration of of malate per gfw is twice as high as in water controls and significantly higher than in corresponding _PROTEIN_ tdna plants . these results indicate that leaf malate levels in arabidopsis increase on salt stress probably to compensate for the charge difference between sodium and chloride taken up by the plant . in addition these results further reveal a biochemical difference between wt and _PROTEIN_ knockout plants . in leaves from various plant species the _LOCATION_ fills of the mesophyll cell volume . furthermore the _LOCATION_ malate concentration was found to be constant at a concentration of mm . therefore excess malate is transported to and stored within the central _LOCATION_ . thus the observation of large differences in the malate content in leaves of wt and knockout plants strongly suggests that the absence of _PROTEIN_ results in a substantially _PROTEIN_ malate content in the _LOCATION_ . to obtain information on the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we fed radioactively labeled malate to leaf discs prepared from either wt or _PROTEIN_ tdna plants . within the first h of incubation leaf discs from _PROTEIN_ tdna plants respired exogenously applied malate only slightly faster than corresponding wt leaves . however within h of incubation discs from _PROTEIN_ tdna leaves respired malate at a rate of whereas the wt tissue respired only pmol of malate per . again leaf discs prepared from the second knockout line _PROTEIN_ tdna behaved similarly . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not an import protein located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ because the absence of this carrier protein does obviously not prevent the entry of labeled malate into the cells of knockout plants . on the other hand to our knowledge facilitated export of malate from mesophyll cells into the apoplast has never been reported . therefore the increased respiratory use of exogenously provided malate by the knockout lines is in accordance with the presumed tonoplastic localization of _PROTEIN_ . in knockout cells it can be assumed that the _LOCATION_ compartmentation of newly imported malate is impaired resulting in higher _LOCATION_ malate levels compared with the situation in wt cells . this change results in an increased mitochondrial use of malate in the knockout cells . taken together these results further indicate that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to provide further independent evidence for a _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we transfected tobacco protoplasts with a plasmid construct directing the synthesis of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and analyzed its localization . as an internal control we also analyzed the localization of a _METHOD_ protein carrying at its n terminus the sucrose transporter from tomato which is known to reside in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ protein in tobacco protoplasts results in green _METHOD_ exclusively in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein results in green _METHOD_ of internal _LOCATION_ structures especially visible between the chloroplasts and around the large _LOCATION_ clearly indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is present in the tonoplast . the tonoplastic localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein has finally been demonstrated by analysis of the green _METHOD_ of intact _LOCATION_ enriched from arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with the plasmid allowing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig ref several of the single _LOCATION_ exhibited strong green _METHOD_ and the number of fluorescing _LOCATION_ reflects the transformation efficiency . atdt _METHOD_ always accumulated in the major and not in small _LOCATION_ . for direct and unequivocal confirmation that _PROTEIN_ is indeed the _LOCATION_ malate transporter we isolated intact _LOCATION_ from wt and knockout leaves and performed flux analyses by using malate . _LOCATION_ from wt leaves imported malate at a rate of pmol of malate per of _LOCATION_ per min whereas the rate for _LOCATION_ from the knockout _PROTEIN_ tdna was times smaller _LOCATION_ . this result provides the proof that _PROTEIN_ is indeed the _LOCATION_ malate transporter . it is tempting to speculate that the low residual malate transport observed in the _LOCATION_ of the knockout plants corresponds to the activity of the malate channel reported in the literature . we performed inhibitor studies to further underline that the arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the _LOCATION_ malate carrier previously characterized by transport studies on intact _LOCATION_ . the import of malate into wt _LOCATION_ is strongly inhibited by the addition of citrate . citrate in fold excess _PROTEIN_ malate uptake by wt _LOCATION_ to of the control . it has been reported that citrate is a competitive inhibitor of the _LOCATION_ malate transporter and exhibits a higher affinity than malate . in contrast the residual malate transport activity observed for the knockout plants was not inhibited by citrate . similarly uptake of malate by wt _LOCATION_ is strongly reduced by the uncoupler _PROTEIN_ m chlorophenylhydrazone but less in _LOCATION_ isolated from the knockout plants . in contrast to the dependence of the human dicarboxylate carrier on sodium no stimulating effect of sodium could be observed .
