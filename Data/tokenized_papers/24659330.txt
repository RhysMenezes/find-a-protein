the salt overly sensitive pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in plants . until recently little was known about the _METHOD_ that inhibit the sos pathway when plants are grown in the absence of salt stress . in this study we report that the arabidopsis thaliana proteins and interact with _PROTEIN_ and repress its kinase activity . growth in the presence of salt _PROTEIN_ the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the proteins leading to kinase activation in planta . interacts with the _PROTEIN_ junction domain which is important for its kinase activity . a phosphorylation site is identified within this domain by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . mutation of ser to ala or asp does not affect _PROTEIN_ kinase activity in the absence of the proteins . however in the presence of proteins the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ activity is _PROTEIN_ by the ser to ala mutation and enhanced by the ser to asp exchange . these results identify and as important regulators of salt tolerance . the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ mediated by the binding of proteins represents a novel mechanism that confers basal repression of the sos pathway in the absence of salt stress .
we previously reported that salt stress induces the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ kinase activity is regulated by salt stress _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background were left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h. myc _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with anti myc antibody conjugated agarose and then used for in vitro kinase assays with recombinant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ as the substrate . _PROTEIN_ kinase activity was low in the control treated sample but was induced upon exposure to nacl . to elucidate the mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ kinase activity is regulated we used flag ha _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins . a homozygous line was germinated and grown on murashige and skoog medium using normal nutrients or isotopic nutrients . ten day old plants labeled with were treated with mm nacl for h and plants labeled with were treated with water . an equal amount of total protein from both treatments was combined and flag hemagglutinin _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with anti flag antibody conjugated agarose . the flag epitope was then cleaved off and anti ha antibody conjugated agarose was used for ha _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitation from the resulting supernatant . agarose bound ha _PROTEIN_ was eluted from ha agarose using an ha peptide . after this two step purification _PROTEIN_ and its interacting proteins were enriched and analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . one putative _PROTEIN_ interacting protein exhibited higher tandem _METHOD_ read values without nacl compared with those with nacl treatment . to verify this interaction _PROTEIN_ and flag ha individually or in combination were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose and was detected using immunoblot assays with anti flag antibody . these experiments revealed that was immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ . when and the flag ha _PROTEIN_ c terminus were coexpressed in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts for coimmunoprecipitation analysis did not immunoprecipitate the _PROTEIN_ c terminus or vice versa . these data support the specificity of the observed interaction of _PROTEIN_ and . to further confirm this interaction in planta specific antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ polyhistidine tagged . to evaluate the specificity of the antibodies columbia and the and knockdown mutants were used for immunoblot analysis . total proteins were extracted from d old wild type and single and double mutant seedlings and analyzed by immunoblots with antibodies . strong cross reaction was detected in col and the mutant weak cross reaction was detected in the mutant and no cross reaction was detected in the double mutant . subsequently flag ha _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h and then flag ha _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody conjugated agarose . the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti antibodies . consistent with the tandem _METHOD_ results _PROTEIN_ pulled down in vivo and this interaction was reduced with salt treatment suggesting that salt stress _PROTEIN_ the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and . finally binary constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were generated for bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analysis in nicotiana benthamiana . plasmids of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ vector were cotransformed into n. benthamiana leaves by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . four days after transformation the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was detected in leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ constructs but not in leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or the _METHOD_ vector . together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and interact in planta and that this interaction is reduced by salt stress . salt stress leads to an increase in _PROTEIN_ kinase activity and simultaneously to a reduction in the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and . therefore we reasoned that may repress _PROTEIN_ activity in the absence of salt stress and that the addition of sodium may induce disassociation of from _PROTEIN_ and allow for _PROTEIN_ kinase activation . since among the members of the family in arabidopsis and share the highest sequence similarity we also included in our experiments to investigate the potential regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity by proteins . _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and polyhistidine tagged and were purified from e. coli and used in in vitro kinase assays . both and partially repressed the _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation activity of myelin basic protein while autophosphorylation was not altered . this reduction in transphosphorylation activity was enhanced with increasing amounts of added protein . to confirm that the observed repression is caused by and not simply by an increase in the total amount of protein in the assay or by substances derived from the polyhistidine tagged protein purification process we tested the effect of the unrelated cytoplasm located polyhistidine tagged arabidopsis actin depolymerizing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ . this protein did not repress _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation activity in vitro . a previous study showed that _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ during salt stress in vivo and _PROTEIN_ is activated by nacl treatment . to determine if recombinant proteins can also repress _PROTEIN_ activity when _PROTEIN_ is immunoprecipitated from plants we conducted kinase assays using immunoprecipitated myc tagged _PROTEIN_ and polyhistidine tagged phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by myc _PROTEIN_ was repressed by and this repression was protein concentration dependent . to investigate whether proteins modulate the regulation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ we first performed comparative in vitro phosphorylation assays using the _PROTEIN_ c terminus as a substrate for _PROTEIN_ . in kinase assays using recombinant maltose binding protein tagged _PROTEIN_ c terminus purified from e. coli we observed efficient phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ . however the addition of either or significantly reduced the phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus by _PROTEIN_ while the autophosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was not affected . also the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation by proteins appeared to be dose dependent since increasing amounts of added proteins further reduced phosphorylation . these results indicate that and function as modulators of the sos pathway by directly repressing _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation activity . to investigate the function of proteins in the sos pathway and determine how salt stress affects the interaction of and _PROTEIN_ in vivo we performed a series of experiments that monitored the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ at different time points during salt stress exposure . flag ha _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were left untreated or treated with mm nacl for or h and then flag ha _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody conjugated agarose and coimmunoprecipitating proteins were probed with anti antibodies . this experiment revealed a time dependent reduction in the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ during salt stress . to determine if the disassociation of proteins from _PROTEIN_ correlates with the activation of _PROTEIN_ during salt stress in planta antibodies for _PROTEIN_ phosphoserine were used to monitor the phosphorylation status of _PROTEIN_ as a measure of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . the _PROTEIN_ construct was transformed into col and the double mutant in which no accumulation of was detected . ten day old transgenic seedlings were left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h and myc _PROTEIN_ proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose . the resulting myc _PROTEIN_ proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti c myc or anti phosphoserine _PROTEIN_ antibodies . consistent with previous results phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was induced in col by salt stress however the degree of phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant was much higher than that in the wild type before nacl treatment and salt treatment did not further enhance this phosphorylation . to further evaluate the effect of the proteins on _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo _PROTEIN_ was transformed into the double mutant background . ten day old transgenic seedlings were left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h and myc _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated . the resulting proteins were incubated in an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ as substrate . in the wild type background _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation activity was very low in control conditions and induced by nacl treatment . however in the double mutant _PROTEIN_ was significantly activated even without salt treatment . these results indicate that proteins interact with _PROTEIN_ in vivo in the absence of salt thereby repressing _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation activity that would otherwise be constitutively activated . upon exposure of plants to salt stress the proteins disassociate from _PROTEIN_ and release the suppression of _PROTEIN_ activity . together these results identify an important regulatory mechanism in which the binding of proteins in nonstressed conditions keeps _PROTEIN_ activity at a basal level but allows for activation by dissociation upon exposure to stress . to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of in arabidopsis a bp dna fragment upstream of the translation start site _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . the resulting construct was transformed into the col background . twenty independent transgenic lines were analyzed for gus staining . gus _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter was detected throughout the plant . the root tip displayed enhanced gus _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the previously reported _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with the promoter gus results when total proteins were extracted from roots _METHOD_ rosette leaves cauline leaves flowers and siliques of wild type plants and analyzed by immunoblots using antibodies protein accumulation was ubiquitously detected in all tissues . to determine the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were generated . as reported previously _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ exhibited the same localization pattern . we next determined whether loss of function of or affects salt tolerance in arabidopsis plants . three week old col and double mutant seedlings grown in soil under short day conditions were treated with mm nacl for weeks . leaves of the salt treated double mutant were greener than those of col and chlorophyll content in the double mutant was also significantly higher while no significant growth difference was observed between wild type and double mutant seedlings grown under control conditions . we next generated flag ha transgenic plants in the col background to overexpress . two transgenic lines that exhibited readily detectable _PROTEIN_ of flag ha were used for further studies . when d old seedlings were transferred to murashige and skoog medium containing mm nacl the transgenic plants displayed significantly enhanced growth inhibition in both the root and shoot compared with the growth of col . primary root lengths of oe and oe lines were reduced by when compared with those of col while the fresh weight was reduced by relative to that of col seedlings . to further evaluate whether the salt sensitive phenotype of the overexpression lines was due to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity during salt stress d old _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings were left untreated and myc _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated . an equal amount of myc _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated with total protein extracts prepared from col or a transgenic overexpression line which had been left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h. the resulting _PROTEIN_ proteins were used for in vitro kinase assays with recombinant mbp or _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ as substrate . consistent with previous results _PROTEIN_ activity was hardly detectable when myc _PROTEIN_ was incubated with protein extracts from control col but transphosphorylation activity increased significantly when myc _PROTEIN_ was incubated with protein extracts prepared from col treated with mm nacl . by contrast compared with protein extract from col the activation of _PROTEIN_ was reduced when myc _PROTEIN_ was incubated with protein extracts from the overexpression line treated with mm nacl . moreover immunoblot analysis revealed that more flag protein was associated with myc _PROTEIN_ when myc _PROTEIN_ was incubated with the protein extracts from the overexpression line than with protein extracts from col . together these results indicate that and negatively regulate salt tolerance in arabidopsis . to further elucidate the mechanism underlying mediated repression of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity we mapped the interaction region in the _PROTEIN_ protein . previously we identified four domains in _PROTEIN_ the n terminal kinase domain the junction domain and the fisl/naf motif and _PROTEIN_ domains in the c terminus . we generated various truncated variants of the _PROTEIN_ protein including kd jd plus the c terminus the c terminus alone and a c terminal domain without the fisl domain . all of these truncated proteins were fused with a myc tag and transiently coexpressed in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with flag ha truncated versions of myc tagged _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose and was detected with an anti flag antibody . the jd ct peptide but not the c terminal peptide pulled down suggesting that only the junction domain of _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the interaction with . the junction domain in _PROTEIN_ is essential for its kinase activity since deletion of the domain results in the loss of kinase activity . we then determined whether the junction domain is sufficient for this interaction using multiple approaches . first the junction domain was fused to a myc tag and the resulting construct was coexpressed with flag ha in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kd were used as controls . consistent with previous results _PROTEIN_ interacted with while _PROTEIN_ kd did not . _PROTEIN_ jd alone interacted with . second yeast two hybrid analyses were also used to further verify whether _PROTEIN_ jd interacts with coding regions of _PROTEIN_ fl _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ jd were cloned into the vector while was cloned into the vector . the resulting _PROTEIN_ fl kd or jd was cotransformed with into yeast strain . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ jd interacted with however no interaction was detected between sos kd and . third in vitro pull down analysis was also used to determine whether sos jd is sufficient for _PROTEIN_ interaction . recombinant _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ jd or _PROTEIN_ tag alone was coexpressed with polyhistidine tagged in e. coli and then _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged recombinant proteins were purified by glutathione sepharose . recombinant proteins were detected using _METHOD_ blue staining and polyhistidine tagged associated with _PROTEIN_ jd was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti his or anti antibody . consistent with previous results _PROTEIN_ tagged sos jd but not the _PROTEIN_ tag pulled down . these results demonstrate that the junction domain of _PROTEIN_ is both necessary and sufficient to mediate interaction with . proteins have been shown to associate with phosphoproteins by recognizing phosphoserine or phosphothreonine within conserved binding motifs . binds to the junction domain of _PROTEIN_ however this domain does not include any of the typical binding consensus motifs and only one ser and no thr residues are present in this domain . we next performed assays to identify autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ in an in vitro plant system . for this purpose _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system based on wheat germ extracts and analyzed by _METHOD_ . using this approach we identified the peptide avfdgiegsyvaenver to be phosphorylated and determined that the predicted phosphorylated amino acid corresponds to _PROTEIN_ . we subsequently analyzed by _METHOD_ wheat germ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a mutant that does not autophosphorylate due to its lack of kinase activity . after translation of this mutated version of _PROTEIN_ in wheat germ extracts we again identified the peptide containing ser as being phosphorylated . the detection of ser phosphorylation in both the active and kinase dead variants of _PROTEIN_ indicates that phosphorylation of this residue is not due to autophosphorylation but results from transphosphorylation by a putative upstream kinase . to determine whether ser is required for the recognition of we generated two mutated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ with ser changed to ala _PROTEIN_ which can not be phosphorylated or asp _PROTEIN_ a putative phosphorylation mimic substitution . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed with flag ha in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . transiently _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ and its mutated _METHOD_ were immunoprecipitated with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose and was detected with anti flag antibody . the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ interaction with while the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhanced this interaction under these experimental conditions . we further tested these interactions in yeast . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the vector and different combinations of _PROTEIN_ and empty vectors were coexpressed in yeast strain . as observed in the immunoprecipitation assays the _PROTEIN_ mutation reduced the _PROTEIN_ interaction with however the _PROTEIN_ mutation had no significant effect on the interaction with in yeast . also in vitro pull down analysis was used to determine the effect of the ser mutation on the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with recombinant _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ tag alone were coexpressed with polyhistidine tagged in e. coli cells and then _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged recombinant proteins were purified by glutathione sepharose . recombinant proteins were detected using _METHOD_ blue staining while polyhistidine tagged associated with _PROTEIN_ or its mutated versions was detected through immunoblot analysis with anti his or anti antibody . _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pulled down _PROTEIN_ displayed a slightly stronger interaction with than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . together with the in vivo results our data suggest that the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ enhances but is not absolutely essential for _PROTEIN_ interaction with proteins in in vitro or overexpression conditions . to further determine whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with proteins in planta firefly luciferase complementation experiments were used to quantitatively analyze their interaction . consistent with our previous data _PROTEIN_ interacted with and this interaction was reduced by the mutation but increased by the mutation . these results support the conclusion that phosphorylation of ser enhances the stability of a _PROTEIN_ protein complex and thereby shifts the cellular balance of active and inactive _PROTEIN_ kinase toward its inactive form . we next determined whether autophosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ has an effect on the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and . the two variants of _PROTEIN_ with mutated ser _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were generated in a _PROTEIN_ kinase dead background _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ and its variants were subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose and coimmunoprecipitating proteins were probed with anti antibodies . further supporting the result presented in figure the _PROTEIN_ mutation reduced the _PROTEIN_ association with and the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhanced the interaction between these two proteins . together these results suggest that transphosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ enhances but is not absolutely essential for the _PROTEIN_ interaction with proteins . we next determined whether ser is phosphorylated in arabidopsis and whether it is required for the repression of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity by myc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and immunoprecipitated with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose . the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine signal was analyzed using antiphosphoserine/antiphosphothreonine polyclonal antibodies . the phosphorylation signal was slightly lower in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than that in _PROTEIN_ . these data together with the previous _METHOD_ result indicate that _PROTEIN_ is transphosphorylated in planta . to determine if represses _PROTEIN_ activity through ser in _PROTEIN_ we first excluded the possibility that mutations at ser affect _PROTEIN_ kinase activity toward its substrate _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were purified from e. coli . in vitro kinase assays using _PROTEIN_ as substrate revealed similar transphosphorylation activities for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . next we investigated the influence of proteins on the activity of different versions of _PROTEIN_ . recombinant polyhistidine tagged was purified from e. coli and incubated with _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for in vitro kinase assays with _PROTEIN_ as substrate . did not repress the transphosphorylation activity of the _PROTEIN_ protein but partially repressed the activity of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . in contrast _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation activity was not altered by . these results suggest that a potentially phosphorylatable ser in _PROTEIN_ is important for enabling proteins to repress _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . finally we determined if the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ repression by in planta . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were generated in the col background and seedlings were treated with mm nacl for h. myc tagged wild type and mutated _PROTEIN_ proteins were purified with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose and used in in vitro kinase assays with _PROTEIN_ as substrate . consistent with previous in vitro results _PROTEIN_ kinase activity was repressed by polyhistidine tagged recombinant protein did not affect the activity of _PROTEIN_ while the activity of _PROTEIN_ was repressed more than that of wild type _PROTEIN_ by . we also generated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in the background . seedlings were left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h. myc tagged wild type and mutated _PROTEIN_ proteins were purified with anti c myc antibody conjugated agarose and used in in vitro kinase assays with _PROTEIN_ as substrate . the kinase activities of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar with and without salt . taken together these results indicate that ser is required for the repression of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity by the proteins and that transphosphorylation of ser enhances the inhibitory effect of the proteins . to examine if ser is important for _PROTEIN_ function in plant salt tolerance d old transgenic plants containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background as well as the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant were transferred to murashige and skoog medium without or with or mm nacl . at least three transgenic lines were used for the analysis of salt sensitivity and one representative line for each transgenic plant is presented in figures and . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ salt sensitive phenotype to wild type levels . however _PROTEIN_ only partially rescued the phenotype . protein levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar . furthermore immunoblot analysis revealed that myc _PROTEIN_ bound more proteins than myc _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ during salt stress . these data suggest that the regulated phosphorylation of ser in _PROTEIN_ is required for a proper response to salt stress in arabidopsis . taken together our results indicate that proteins function in salt tolerance in plants by modulating _PROTEIN_ activity through ser in _PROTEIN_ .

tag alone was coexpressed with polyhistidine tagged in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged recombinant proteins were purified by glutathione sepharose according to the manufacturer s protocol and detected by _METHOD_ brilliant blue r staining while associated polyhistidine tagged was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti his or anti antibody . polyhistidine tagged was purified from these coexpressing e. coli strains and used as a loading control . the generation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been described previously and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was generated based on this construct by site directed mutagenesis with the _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r primers as described . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ using the rts wheat germ cecf kit as described recently . for _METHOD_ analysis unpurified protein samples were run on an _PROTEIN_ gel and stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r . the stained protein bands corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ protein were excised and subsequently fragmented using the endoproteinase trypsin as described . no reduction or alkylation steps were performed . phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using tips . separation of peptides was conducted on the ultimate nanoflow hplc system coupled to the nanospray source of an ltq orbitrap xl _METHOD_ spectrometer . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode . _METHOD_ full scans were acquired by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance _METHOD_ in the orbitrap at a resolution of with internal lock _METHOD_ calibration on m/z . the five most intense ions of each full scan were fragmented in the linear ion trap by collision induced dissociation . fragment ions exhibiting a neutral loss of and d corresponding to the neutral loss of phosphoric acid were activated further while the remaining _METHOD_ ions were stored in the ion trap . after the second activation step _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ ions were simultaneously analyzed in the _METHOD_ analyzer of the ion trap . for the identification of peptides multistage activation spectra were matched against the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptide sequences using _METHOD_ x ! tandem cyclone and sequest . phosphopeptide identifications and phosphorylation site localizations were validated by manual inspection of fragmentation spectra . sequence data from this article can be found in the
