we have characterized the requirements to inhibit the function of the plant _LOCATION_ sorting receptor _PROTEIN_ in vivo and gained insight into the crucial role of receptor recycling between the prevacuolar compartment and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the drug wortmannin interferes with the _PROTEIN_ mediated route to the _LOCATION_ and induces hypersecretion of a soluble _PROTEIN_ ligand . wortmannin does not prevent receptor ligand binding itself but causes _PROTEIN_ levels to be limiting . consequently overexpression of _PROTEIN_ partially restores _LOCATION_ cargo transport . to simulate receptor traffic we tested a truncated _PROTEIN_ derivative in which the entire lumenal domain of _PROTEIN_ has been replaced by the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the resulting chimeric protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the prevacuolar compartment as expected but a soluble _METHOD_ fragment can also be detected in purified _LOCATION_ . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coexpression interferes with the correct sorting of a _PROTEIN_ ligand and causes hypersecretion that is reversible by _PROTEIN_ a fold excess of full length _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ competes with endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the retrograde transport route that rescues receptors from the prevacuolar compartment . treatment with wortmannin causes further leakage of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the prevacuolar compartment to the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ ligands are secreted . we propose that recycling of the _LOCATION_ sorting receptor from the prevacuolar compartment to the _LOCATION_ apparatus is an essential process that is saturable and wortmannin sensitive .
it has been shown previously that wortmannin causes hypersecretion of soluble cargo molecules carrying a sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting signal . because this deviated substantially from previous findings we have systematically compared the effects of an increasing concentration of wortmannin on _LOCATION_ sorting . the secretory protein amylase was compared with an amy fusion protein carrying the sequence specific sorting signal of sweet potato sporamin . the latter fusion has been extensively tested and described previously and the sequence specific nature has been further confirmed by a control experiment in which addition of two glycin residues to the c terminus does not affect its functionality . to test the effect of the drug on the cargo molecules tobacco leaf protoplasts were transfected pooled and split into equal portions and incubated either without the drug or with increasing concentrations of wortmannin as indicated below each lane . after analyzing cells and medium the ratio between the _LOCATION_ and intracellular enzyme activity was calculated and is shown as the secretion index . the results show that hardly any effect of the drug was observed for the secretory marker amy as reported before . by contrast wortmannin caused a substantially induced secretion for amy spo in a dosage dependent fashion . to test if the drug exhibits a different effect in different cell types we analyzed cells that were stably transformed with amy spo . figure shows that cells exhibited a similar if not higher sensitivity to the drug as visualized by a drastically induced secretion index of amy spo . again the effect is dosage dependent and the sorting of amy spo can not be _PROTEIN_ as insensitive or resistant to wortmannin at any of the concentrations used . this is in contrast with a previous report on the effect of the drug on sweet potato sporamin in cells . to confirm amy spo as a _PROTEIN_ ligand we took advantage of the _PROTEIN_ that a soluble luminal portion of _PROTEIN_ fused to a c terminal hdel motif was shown to retard _LOCATION_ delivery of soluble ligands . chimeric genes were constructed encoding soluble derivatives devoid of the transmembrane domain and _LOCATION_ tail of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ . this gene family member was chosen because it is the arabidopsis isoform most related to pea _PROTEIN_ . the chimeric constructs included a c terminal myc tag for detection and transient _PROTEIN_ confirmed that the hdel tagged _PROTEIN_ is efficiently retained in the cells in contrast with the secreted soluble _PROTEIN_ . to test the effect of _PROTEIN_ hdel rapidly and quantitatively transfected cells were fractionated into soluble proteins released by osmotic shock and proteins released after sonicating the pellet . the first fraction is enriched in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ solutes whereas the second is enriched in microsomes derived from the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the endosomes . figure shows that coexpression of hdel causes a dosage dependent shift of the intracellular partitioning of amy spo from to whereas a control cargo containing a mutagenized sorting signal failed to exhibit such a redistribution . this result provides positive evidence that amy spo is a _PROTEIN_ ligand and illustrates the use of the engineered _PROTEIN_ derivative . to investigate how wortmannin causes hypersecretion of _PROTEIN_ ligands we first tested if the drug interferes with the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and its ligands . therefore we used the simple hdel mediated in vivo receptor binding assay with wortmannin treated cells . if receptor ligand interactions still occur in wortmannin treated cells coexpression of hdel should reduce the secretion of amy spo . figure shows that wortmannin induced secretion of amy spo is indeed inhibited by hdel . importantly no effect on secretion was observed with the secretory control cargo amy . therefore the drug does not seem to interfere with ligand binding directly . to further explore how wortmannin targets the _PROTEIN_ route we tested if full length _PROTEIN_ overexpression could cause a degree of resistance to the drug . figure shows that it was possible to overexpress and detect _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts as illustrated by an increase in the _PROTEIN_ signal in microsomal fractions . the control marker calnexin confirmed that equal levels of microsomes were loaded . we then tested the effect of increasing amounts of full length _PROTEIN_ in wortmannin treated tobacco protoplasts _PROTEIN_ either amy or amy spo . figure shows the relative effect of cotransfected full length _PROTEIN_ in a constant background of wortmannin . the result demonstrates that increasing concentrations of full length _PROTEIN_ significantly reduces the secretion of amy spo the predicted _PROTEIN_ ligand . by contrast no meaningful effect is observed with the secretory cargo amy . as in figure this is an important control because it highlights the specificity of the in vivo assay and demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ overexpression does not cause a general inhibition of anterograde traffic . to test if overexpressed full length _PROTEIN_ promotes _LOCATION_ sorting and not just cell retention in wortmannin treated cells we analyzed and fractions . the results show that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ leads to an increased amy spo level in both cell fractions . thus additional _PROTEIN_ molecules are not merely trapping amy spo in the early secretory pathway but a large proportion proceeds to the _LOCATION_ . the results suggest that higher numbers of _PROTEIN_ molecules reverse the wortmannin induced secretion of _PROTEIN_ ligand amy spo . we postulate that the drug causes _PROTEIN_ molecules to be the limiting _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ sorting rather than interfering with ligand binding directly . to study _PROTEIN_ dependent transport further _PROTEIN_ derivatives were constructed in which the entire lumenal ligand binding domains were replaced by green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . we have used the arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also known as _PROTEIN_ which has been studied most in recent years _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as classified previously . it was shown previously that the transmembrane domain and _LOCATION_ tail of pea _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to transport aleurain to a lytic compartment in which propeptide processing occurs . moreover the same domains target yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the pvc and colocalizes with endogenous _PROTEIN_ . it could thus be predicted that the new _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions would compete with endogenous _PROTEIN_ for sorting machinery . moreover because of its inability to bind ligands the fusion protein would occupy limiting sites within transport vesicles and thus compromise _LOCATION_ sorting . to test that any effect observed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions was specifically because of the _PROTEIN_ domains present in the fusion protein a control construct was created in which the transmembrane domain and _LOCATION_ tail of _PROTEIN_ were replaced by the equivalent portion of calnexin . the resulting chimeric gene _METHOD_ has the same topology and almost identical dimensions to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions . further controls included secreted _METHOD_ and a _METHOD_ fusion with the sweet potato sporamin propeptide _METHOD_ . the various constructs were cotransfected with amy spo and the culture medium and cells were harvested after h. we first tested the effect of coexpressed _METHOD_ fusions on the sorting of amy spo . figure shows that the two _PROTEIN_ fusions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ strongly induced the secretion of amy spo similar to the drug wortmannin . the same was observed for the other fusions carrying the equivalent domains of _METHOD_ d and f . the induced secretion of amy spo is not because of a general effect of overexpressing a type i _LOCATION_ protein because _METHOD_ calnexin does not influence the sorting of amy spo . also the two soluble _METHOD_ cargo molecules did not significantly affect amy spo sorting . to analyze the _METHOD_ fusions cells were fractionated into extracts enriched in soluble proteins and _LOCATION_ proteins to test intracellular partitioning . as in figure soluble proteins were partitioned into those released by osmotic shock and those released after sonicating the first pellet . in addition the second pellet was enriched in _LOCATION_ spanning proteins and was analyzed as well . figure shows that all _METHOD_ fusions produce multiple bands . this is partially because of the use of a glycosylated _METHOD_ derivative but also because of proteolysis . secreted _METHOD_ was found to be soluble and secreted whereas _METHOD_ spo was hardly detected in the medium and _PROTEIN_ fractionated with the first soluble fraction . interestingly a lower molecular weight degradation fragment was seen identical to a band previously described and hereafter termed the _METHOD_ core . the _METHOD_ core is never detected in the culture medium and is much more intense for _METHOD_ spo compared with _METHOD_ alone . the results confirm that a small proportion of secreted _METHOD_ reaches a lytic compartment but this is greatly increased by the addition of a _LOCATION_ sorting signal . interestingly all the _LOCATION_ spanning _METHOD_ fusions also exhibited substantial levels of this degradation product except for the calnexin fusion . in each case the _METHOD_ core has the same molecular weight and partitions exclusively to the fraction which contains _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ lumen and only minor portions of microsomes . as expected the full length molecules also strongly partition into the microsomal fraction which contains not only microsomal lumen but also sonicated _LOCATION_ fragments that failed to sediment . however only the three _LOCATION_ spanning proteins partition into the final _LOCATION_ enriched pellet . the results suggest that unlike the calnexin fusion _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions reach a lytic compartment in which processing to the _METHOD_ core can occur supporting previous observations with another reporter . none of the _METHOD_ bands of the _LOCATION_ fusions were detected in the culture medium which suggests that the soluble degradation product of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ must be generated after the compartment from which export to the cell surface occurs . a control experiment using the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin _METHOD_ the upper two bands as glycosylated and unglycosylated full length fragments . the results obtained so far show that overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions leads to their missorting to the _LOCATION_ and causes induced secretion of amy spo . to confirm a specific effect on _LOCATION_ transport of soluble ligands we have compared the influence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coexpression for three soluble cargo molecules amy amy hdel and amy spo . in addition a construct _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was used to test for increased cell mortality . cells were transfected with a constant amount of plasmid encoding each of the cargos with a dilution series of the effector _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that the chimeric construct strongly inhibits the _LOCATION_ sorting of the _PROTEIN_ ligand as indicated by an approximate fold increase in the secretion index at the highest concentration of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the case of the secretory control hardly any effect was seen . the secretion index of amy hdel was slightly reduced and the _LOCATION_ protein gus was tested and found to be present at to of the total activity in the medium _PROTEIN_ of the concentration of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these two additional controls indicate that increased cell mortality can be ruled out as a cause for induced secretion of amy spo . to confirm that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ competes with endogenous tobacco _PROTEIN_ for transport machinery we tested if coexpression of full length _PROTEIN_ could alleviate the effect . for this purpose an intermediate level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was electroporated with a constant amount of cargo encoding plasmid together with a dilution series of plasmid encoding full length _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that coexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ counteracts the effect of truncated _PROTEIN_ in a dosage dependent manner . a fold excess of wild type _PROTEIN_ almost completely alleviated the inhibition by the chimera . the control cargo amy was not influenced by coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and increasing concentrations of wild type _PROTEIN_ did not cause any change either . this shows that only _PROTEIN_ ligands are influenced by this in vivo assay . increasing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ neither affected the total cargo levels nor the quantity of the effector molecule _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ produced . this indicates that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and full length _PROTEIN_ specifically compete with each other . this is quite distinct from the dominant negative poisoning of the pathway observed for mutants of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for instance . our data suggest that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions compete with tobacco _PROTEIN_ for sorting machinery needed to sustain traffic between the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the pvc . the reconstitution of _LOCATION_ sorting by full length _PROTEIN_ as well as the presence of the soluble _METHOD_ core suggest that the limiting _PROTEIN_ is likely to be the rescue from the pvc . endogenous _PROTEIN_ molecules could thus be lost when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is coexpressed . to test this we studied the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the influence of wortmannin on this fusion protein . protoplasts were transfected with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions and as a _LOCATION_ marker a chimeric construct was cotransfected which carries the spectral variant _METHOD_ fused to the transmembrane domain of sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in vivo imaging revealed that all _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions labeled punctate structures of more variable size and often smaller than the typical _LOCATION_ bodies highlighted by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled structures are often _LOCATION_ associated but clearly physically separated . hardly any colocalization was seen between the two markers which corresponds with observations that _PROTEIN_ accumulates predominantly in the pvc . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ structures were equally mobile as _LOCATION_ bodies but moved independently when observed over long periods of time . only at very high _PROTEIN_ levels could some colocalization with the _LOCATION_ marker be observed but the predominant signals still arise from extra _LOCATION_ structures . this strongly suggests that anterograde transport is not the limiting _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of _LOCATION_ sorting and considering the current state of the art in the field we have defined the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ structures as pvc . we have obtained the same results with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the two other fusions carrying the domains from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . detailed investigations to test if the various domains from the _METHOD_ carry differential sorting information failed to reveal any difference so far and all fusions exhibit the same effect on the control cargo amy spo . a weak _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ lumen was also detected for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions but is not easily seen with optical sections of intact protoplasts . however upon treatment with wortmannin the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ increased noticeably whereas the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled pvc structures _PROTEIN_ in number and intensity . this was observed for all fusion proteins and all further experiments were conducted with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in purified _LOCATION_ preparations from wortmannin treated cells _METHOD_ was easily seen and was absent in _LOCATION_ from untransfected cells . the presence of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ originating from untransfected protoplasts rules out that wortmannin induces a general green _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ . we conclude that the drug specifically causes a redistribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the pvc toward the _LOCATION_ in transfected protoplasts . to strengthen the experimental evidence further we tested if wortmannin induced missorting to the _LOCATION_ could also be observed biochemically by an increase in the level of the soluble _METHOD_ core . protoplasts were transfected with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and incubated for h to reach a steady state distribution after which the population was split into equal portions and incubated with wortmannin for different times . the protein gel blot shows that wortmannin causes a rapid decline of the full length precursor form and a simultaneous increase in the soluble _METHOD_ core . a control experiment without wortmannin did not show any redistribution in the same time frame confirming that steady state levels were reached after h. a second control experiment with _METHOD_ calnexin failed to yield any form of degradation product even in the presence of wortmannin . in addition the amount of the full length _METHOD_ calnexin fusion protein in the _LOCATION_ fraction did not decline over time . this shows that _PROTEIN_ sequences either in the transmembrane domain or the _LOCATION_ tail are required to yield wortmannin induced missorting to the _LOCATION_ . to test if the wortmannin induced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ degradation product was actually localized in the _LOCATION_ we compared the signals from total cells with those of purified _LOCATION_ . the data clearly demonstrate that the _METHOD_ core copurifies with _LOCATION_ in contrast with the higher molecular weight precursors . _METHOD_ core is present in _LOCATION_ before the treatment but its levels increase steadily with time after adding wortmannin . the pvc has previously been shown to exhibit a higher density than _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in sucrose gradients and would pellet together with the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ through a sucrose cushion after ultracentrifugation . thus obtained microsomal preparations from cells incubated with or without wortmannin for h failed to yield detectable levels of the _METHOD_ core fragment . this suggests that premature processing in the pvc is unlikely to occur _PROTEIN_ of the presence of the drug . large quantities of microsomes were loaded and even if transport from the endosomes is rapid a portion of the _METHOD_ core should have been detectable if it existed in this fraction . endogenous calnexin did not copurify with the _LOCATION_ illustrating the purity of the _LOCATION_ fraction . likewise calnexin levels were identical in the three microsomal preparations confirming loading of equivalent fractions . to exclude that increased levels of _LOCATION_ degradation products are because of a wortmannin induced change in the _LOCATION_ ph a control experiment was performed in which a _METHOD_ sporamin fusion which yields an identical _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ core fragment was tested . figure shows that _METHOD_ spo _PROTEIN_ protoplasts at steady state show a rapid reduction of the _METHOD_ core level upon treatment with the drug for h. statistical analysis of purified _LOCATION_ from either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ spo _PROTEIN_ cells revealed that wortmannin reduced the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ derived from _METHOD_ spo and increased the _METHOD_ derived from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the result illustrates that ph changes are unlikely to cause the wortmannin induced differential effect on _METHOD_ spo and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ derived _METHOD_ core fragments in the _LOCATION_ . the experiments in the previous section were conducted with protoplasts exhibiting steady state levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins which predominantly localized to the pvc but redistributed rapidly to the _LOCATION_ . to test the opposite behavior of _METHOD_ spo and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon wortmannin treatment further a pulse chase analysis was performed . unlike observing the change in cellular steady state levels this technique allows us to measure protein traffic on de novo synthesized cargo . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ ligand _METHOD_ spo chases rapidly into the soluble _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ core fragment with more than half of the precursor being converted into the lower molecular weight fragment after h of chase . wortmannin drastically inhibits this transport as observed by a reduction of the chased _LOCATION_ degradation product and a noticeable accumulation of full length _METHOD_ spo in the medium . in contrast with the ligand the receptor fusion protein chases much more slowly to the soluble _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ core fragment and after h only a small portion of the precursor has been degraded into the core fragment . line scanning of phosphor imaging data and subsequent quantification via aida software revealed that after h of chase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ derived _METHOD_ core fragment levels were comparable to those derived from _METHOD_ spo after just h of chase . likewise the h chase point for _METHOD_ spo and the h chase point for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yielded a comparable percentage of _METHOD_ core fragments . thus the receptor construct is transported at an approximately fourfold lower rate compared with the ligand construct . most importantly wortmannin treatment had completely opposite effects on ligand and receptor constructs . _METHOD_ spo processing was slowed down and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ processing was accelerated at all chase points . together with the results on the steady state levels this result suggests that wortmannin inhibits the retrograde transport of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ between the pvc and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . for this reason receptors are depleted from the _LOCATION_ apparatus leading to the secretion of their ligands .
all dna manipulations were done according to established procedures . the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ strain was used for the amplification of all plasmids . previously established plasmids were used encoding amy amy hdel amy spo and amy spom . it was shown previously that the mutation of npirl to npgrg in amy spom drastically increased the secretion of the fusion protein expected for a sequence specific sorting signal . to further confirm the sequence specific nature of the signal in amy spo we have also tested the effect of a double gly to the c terminus . this construct was generated by inserting annealed oligonucleotide pairs between the bglii and xbai sites of the amy encoding plasmid that overlap with the last codon and the stop codon as described previously . the following oligonucleotide pairs were used to generate the c terminally fused peptide encoding regions spogg sense _PROTEIN_ and spogg antisense . underlined areas represent the additional double codons for the double glycin motif added at the c terminus of the sporamin sorting signal . the new construct was verified by sequencing analysis . as expected this extended fusion exhibited properties indistinguishable from those reported for amy spo . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ was created by amplification of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sequence from _METHOD_ described earlier using a forward primer and a reverse primer using clai and bamhi restriction sites in _PROTEIN_ . a glycosylated _METHOD_ variant was recreated from published instructions but with the following modifications instead of the chitinase signal peptide the signal peptide of sweet potato sporamin was used amplified with the oligos _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cut with clai and sali for insertion into _PROTEIN_ . the clai site gives rise to the fusion with and sali provides the link with the glycosylation peptide that was recreated using two oligonucleotides composing the published sequence . secondly a bglii site was engineered at the c terminus of the modified _METHOD_ to permit c terminal extensions between bglii and xbai the latter of which overlaps with the stop codon . this was accomplished with the oligo _METHOD_ bglii that was used in conjunction with _PROTEIN_ to amplify the entire coding region of the n glycosylated variant of _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ cargo molecule _METHOD_ spo was synthesized with the same oligonucleotides as described for amy spo . the transmembrane domain and _LOCATION_ tail of arabidopsis thaliana calnexin was amplified using sense oligo accgagatctcggaactgattgagaaagcc and antisense oligo _PROTEIN_ from first strand cdna prepared from d old seedlings of arabidopsis according to established procedures . the underlined regions refer to engineered restriction sites for insertion between bglii and xbai for insertion between the coding region of the n glycosylated variant of _METHOD_ and its stop codon to create a c terminal fusion yielding the plasmid . the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr from first strand cdna prepared from d old seedlings of arabidopsis using the following oligonucleotide pairs _PROTEIN_ sense and _PROTEIN_ antisense _PROTEIN_ sense and _PROTEIN_ antisense _PROTEIN_ sense and _PROTEIN_ antisense _PROTEIN_ sense and _PROTEIN_ antisense _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ pcr amplification product was digested with bamhi the _PROTEIN_ fragment with xbai and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were digested with both bglii and xbai for vector insertion . the fragment encoding the promoter and _METHOD_ fused to the signal peptide of sweet potato sporamin was extracted from the plasmid by digestion with bglii filling in by using the klenow fragment and digestion with ecori . this fragment and the digested _PROTEIN_ fragment were gel purified and inserted into _PROTEIN_ previously cut with ecori/bamhi and dephosphorylated with calf intestine phosphatase . this resulted in fusion of the truncated _PROTEIN_ downstream and in frame with the _METHOD_ sequence yielding the plasmid _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was constructed similarly except for the use of xbai before the sequence in _PROTEIN_ and yielded _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were constructed by replacing the calnexin transmembrane domain and _LOCATION_ tail of by straightforward swapping of the bglii xbai fragment with the amplified and digested _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments yielding and . full length _PROTEIN_ was amplified from the same cdna using the oligos _PROTEIN_ sense and _PROTEIN_ antisense and cloned in pamy between the blunted ncoi site and the sticky bamhi site effectively replacing the amy coding region by the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ yielding plasmid . soluble _PROTEIN_ fragments with and without hdel motifs and supplemented by c terminal myc tags were constructed in the same way except that the following antisense oligonucleotide was used _PROTEIN_ . the pcr fragment was cut with nhei and cloned between blunted ncoi and sticky nhei in or yielding and . all constructions were verified by sequencing analysis . tobacco plants were grown in _METHOD_ medium and sucrose in a controlled room at with a h day length at the light irradiance of . preparation of tobacco leaf protoplasts and transfection via electroporation were done as described previously and plasmid concentrations used are given in the figure legends . all incubations were performed for h unless otherwise indicated . the harvesting of cells and culture medium was described previously . wortmannin was dissolved as a mm stock solution in _METHOD_ and subsequently diluted in transient _PROTEIN_ buffer as appropriate . the final concentration and incubation time in the presence of the drug are as described in results and in the figure legends . to ensure constant background parameters for drug dosage experiments a slightly modified electroporation protocol was used . six hundred microliter batches of electroporated protoplast suspensions were initially diluted with of tex medium and then pooled . the protoplasts were then split into equal portions of and supplemented with another of tex medium that contains twice the final concentration of the drug indicated in the figure legends . this ensured minimal variation between the samples except for the concentration of the drug . individual samples were then harvested as described previously . _LOCATION_ were isolated from protoplasts h after electroporation in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments as described except for the following modifications the cellulose synthesis inhibitor dichlorobenzonitrile was omitted as it proved unnecessary . moreover both the pelleted _LOCATION_ and the total protoplast pellet were resuspended in of _LOCATION_ buffer of which were immediately frozen after mixing with of _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . an identical aliquot of was diluted with of mannosidase extraction buffer sonicated and spun for min in a refrigerated eppendorf centrifuge to yield a clear supernatant for mannosidase assays . the total and _LOCATION_ samples for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were adjusted to the appropriate dilution via obtained marker values using a _LOCATION_ buffer/sds sample buffer mix . equal mannosidase levels for cells and _LOCATION_ were then loaded on _PROTEIN_ gels for further analysis . cell partitioning through osmotic shock treatment was performed using an established procedure except that amy extraction buffer was used . cells pelleted with mm nacl were gently resuspended in a fourfold volume of amy extraction buffer and incubated on ice for min . centrifugation of the samples at for min yields osmotically released soluble proteins in the supernatant that are _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ whereas microsomes formed the pellet . the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of amy extraction buffer as sonicated and pelleted at for min . this yields all remaining soluble microsomal proteins and some _LOCATION_ proteins . the resulting pellet is highly enriched in _LOCATION_ and was resuspended in the same volume of amy extraction buffer as or sonicated and left in suspension until analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for standard amy assays the cells were extracted in amy extraction buffer via sonication for s. this corresponds to the combined and fractions described in the previous paragraph . the extracts were centrifuged for min at at and the clean soluble supernatant was recovered . the culture medium was also spun for min at at to remove residual cell debris . the amy assays and calculation of the secretion index as the ratio between the _LOCATION_ and intracellular activity were described previously . in figure soluble amy extract and pellet were used for protein gel blotting to assess the level of effector molecule in the _PROTEIN_ rescue experiment . the mannosidase assays for _LOCATION_ partioning experiments were performed as described previously . the amount of mannosidase activity was used to equalize the loading of cells and purified _LOCATION_ on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels . the levels of calnexin were analyzed by protein gel blots as a control for _LOCATION_ contamination in the _LOCATION_ preparations . protein analysis of culture medium was performed after concentration with aqueous ammonium sulfate solution for h on ice using bsa at mg/ml as a carrier . the protein precipitate was obtained by min centrifugation at in a refrigerated eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed then resuspended in amy extraction buffer to obtain a fold higher concentration compared with the original volume of cell suspension . cellular proteins were analyzed separately as soluble proteins and _LOCATION_ proteins . the cell pellet was resuspended in a fold lower volume of amy extraction buffer and soluble cell proteins were extracted by sonication and centrifugation for min at at . the supernatant containing the soluble proteins was recovered . the pellet containing _LOCATION_ proteins was resuspended in an equal volume of amy extraction buffer followed by brief sonication to obtain a homogeneous solution _LOCATION_ . protein cell extracts enriched in soluble or _LOCATION_ proteins as well as the concentrated medium were loaded in equal volumes after twofold dilution with _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and brief boiling . proteins in _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and then blocked with _PROTEIN_ tween and milk powder for h. after gel blotting immunodetections were performed using enhanced chemiluminescence using rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or calnexin . the polyclonal antiserum prepared against a conserved _PROTEIN_ domain proved to contain high background staining of our protein gel blots . to reduce the background g of tobacco plants were extracted with ml of mm tris mm edta with mortar and pestle and spun for min at to remove debris and then h at to remove _LOCATION_ . the supernatant was diluted to ml with _PROTEIN_ and incubated with of nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ for h. these _LOCATION_ were then blocked with milk washed with _PROTEIN_ tween and then used as solid state subtractor for incubation with ml of fold diluted serum in _PROTEIN_ supplemented with bsa sodium azide . after overnight incubation the diluted and subtracted antibody was kept at and used for routine protein gel blots . to detect transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts it was necessary to prepare microsomes . microsomes were also prepared to rule out the presence of the soluble _METHOD_ core fragment in this fraction . protoplasts from five batches of transfections were pooled and incubated for h after which cells were separated from the medium and debris via floatation in tex medium . after removing the majority of underlying solution floating cells were washed in ml of mm nacl and pelleted . the pellets were resuspended in ml homogenization buffer supplemented with of sucrose passed through a syringe needle five times and then centrifuged for min at in a swing out rotor . two milliliters of turbid supernatant was carefully layered onto a ml sucrose cushion and centrifuged through the cushion onto a second sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation . microsomes were collected in from the to interface and mixed with of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer and boiled and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or calnexin was monitored by protein gel blots . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were harvested h after dna transfer and embedded in low melting agarose in tex medium on a slide to prevent vibrations . confocal imaging was performed using an inverted zeiss lsm meta laser scanning microscope with a plan neofluar oil differential interference contrast objective . for imaging _PROTEIN_ of either _METHOD_ constructs alone or in combination with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ excitation lines of an argon laser of nm for _METHOD_ and nm for _METHOD_ were used alternately with line switching using the multitrack facility of the microscope . the _METHOD_ was detected using a dichroic beam splitter and to nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ and to nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ . appropriate controls have been performed to exclude the possibility of cross talk between the two fluorochromes before the experiments . postacquisition image processing was with the lsm image browser and adobe photoshop elements software . to quantify _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with arbitrary units identical detector gains were used for all measurements . for pulse chase analysis of _METHOD_ spo and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ standard electroporations were pooled washed and concentrated in of tex buffer supplemented with pro mix _METHOD_ . after pulse labeling for h protoplasts were diluted with chase buffer in the presence or absence of wortmannin . the protoplast suspensions were split into equal portions and incubated at for an appropriate period of time . medium and cells were harvested as described above . the immunoprecipitations were performed on ice using ice cold buffers . the cellular fractions were extracted in homogenization buffer . the homogenate was centrifuged for min at in an eppendorf refrigerated centrifuge . the supernatant was isolated and stored at . culture medium was frozen immediately after harvesting . media and cell extracts were precipitated in net gel buffer containing anti _METHOD_ antiserum . after h incubation on ice and centrifugation to remove aggregates the supernatant was transferred to another eppendendorf tube containing mg of hydrated protein a sepharose in net buffer . the samples were incubated for h at with slow rotation . protein a sepharose was then pelleted by centrifugation for s at and the supernatant was discarded . the pellet was washed four times with net buffer and a fifth wash with _PROTEIN_ . thirty microliters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer were added to the final pellet and the suspension was incubated at for min and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . labeled proteins were detected by phosphor imaging _PROTEIN_ and aida software to allow quantification . exposures on x ray _METHOD_ were used to obtain higher resolution images for visual display . the percentage of processing was determined for each lane by dividing the peak surface area of the _METHOD_ core band by the total surface area of all peaks and multiplication by to yield percentages .
