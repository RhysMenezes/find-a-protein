although plants continually produce different organs throughout their life cycle little is known about the _PROTEIN_ that regulate the timing of a given developmental program . here we report that the restricted _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to the epidermis is sufficient to control foliar organ identity in arabidopsis by regulating the synthesis of two hormones abscisic acid and gibberellin . these hormones in turn regulate the rates of cell cycling during organ formation to determine whether an embryonic or adult leaf will emerge . we also show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is influenced by the patterning hormone auxin and therefore acts as a nexus of hormone action during embryogenesis . the identification of lipophillic hormones downstream of a heterochronic regulator in arabidopsis has parallels to _METHOD_ of developmental timing in animals and suggests a common logic for temporal control of developmental _METHOD_ between these two _METHOD_ .
we investigated the localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ protein during embryogenesis using a reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion under the control of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this translational fusion was fully functional in that it rescued all loss of function _PROTEIN_ embryonic phenotypes . up to the triangular stage of embryo development _METHOD_ was detected in most cells but was more strongly visible in the apical part of the embryo and the suspensor . by the _PROTEIN_ heart and torpedo stages the _METHOD_ signal became predominantly confined to the epidermis citation . at these _PROTEIN_ stages _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was most pronounced at the cotyledon and root tips with some signal being detected in the vascular tissue within the embryonic root citation . by the walking stick stage the _METHOD_ signal clearly marked the root tip and the epidermal tissues of the cotyledon citation . closer inspection of the root tip of walking stick embryos revealed weak _METHOD_ in inner cell layers adjacent to the epidermis while the cotyledons still showed epidermal specific _METHOD_ citation . after this stage the _METHOD_ signal began to dissipate and was completely absent by the time the embryo reached maturity citation . these _METHOD_ _METHOD_ patterns support the previously published _PROTEIN_ transcription patterns citation . the embryonic patterns of _PROTEIN_ accumulation are similar to those reported for the auxin responsive reporter citation which suggests that the embryonic patterns of _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation may reflect differential auxin concentrations . this was tested by dissecting embryos from a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plant and placing the embryos on iaa a naturally occurring auxin . by hr iaa imbibed embryos showed an increase in the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ signal in the root cap cells versus untreated controls citation . because the _METHOD_ signal can be induced by exogenous auxin in dissected embryos we tested the possibility of inducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ outside of the embryo in an auxin dependent manner by monitoring the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene using a _PROTEIN_ gus transcriptional reporter . in the absence of exogenous auxin the _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic line normally shows gus activity in its roots for a duration of approximately days after germination citation . after this time the blue staining dissipated and was only marginally present by days citation . after day old seedlings grown on minimal media were transferred to media containing iaa for a hr period strong gus activity was observed in the root tip versus roots grown on minimal media . a similar incubation on media containing aba or ga showed little or no increase in blue staining indicating that the increased gus activity is auxin specific citation . hence the patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein accumulation in the embryo may reflect the sites of the auxin maxima such as the root and cotyledon tips . because the _PROTEIN_ promoter restricts _PROTEIN_ to the layer of the shoot apical meristem throughout vegetative and floral development it allows the misexpression of _PROTEIN_ to be _PROTEIN_ postembryonically citation . homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings developed into dark green dwarfed plants that were often semisterile citation . after germination homozygous lines produce foliar leaves that are more similar to cotyledons citation . as _PROTEIN_ organs emerge from the meristem they are yellow but as they develop take on a rounder shape and a glossy glabrous surface reminiscent of a cotyledon citation . in strong lines the production of cotyledons occurred throughout development even after the plant has switched to a reproductive meristem . for example cotyledonary like organs appeared from the floral meristem in the same _PROTEIN_ arrangement as that observed for flower organs citation . as the plants age however the organs that initially emerged as cotyledonary like leaves slowly take on features that are more characteristic of vegetative leaves such as an oblong leaf shape and elongated petioles resulting in a christmas tree like appearance citation . as young vegetative leaves emerge from the meristem of misexpressed _PROTEIN_ lines they accumulate seed storage proteins throughout the leaf which is consistent with their embryonic identity citation . this accumulation is surprising since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants only show _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the epidermal layer . this result suggests that a downstream component of _PROTEIN_ that regulates seed storage accumulation most likely functions in a cell nonautonomous manner . aba has been implicated as a positive regulator of many _PROTEIN_ regulated embryonic functions including storage reserve accumulation desiccation tolerance and dormancy establishment citation . to test the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and aba an aba auxotrophic mutation _PROTEIN_ was genetically introduced into a _PROTEIN_ loss of function line that has been complemented with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . because severe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines do not produce functional flowers for crossing a phenotypically weak _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line was used in this experiment . cotyledon like leaves produced in weaker lines are mostly lacking in trichome hairs but occasionally produce trichomes at the tip or margins of the leaves . flower development is affected to some extent in weak lines in that the sepals open much earlier than wild type and growth of the _PROTEIN_ and the filament of the stamens is delayed compared to the growth of the carpel citation . these flower defects often result in reduced fertilization which consequently produces a large proportion of short siliques citation . when the _PROTEIN_ mutation was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ misexpressing line trichome production was restored on rosette and cauline leaves citation floral defects were rescued citation and plants produced normal elongated siliques citation . these results indicate that aba is necessary for _PROTEIN_ function and that this hormone works at or downstream of _PROTEIN_ . to more clearly determine the relationship between aba and _PROTEIN_ we measured the concentrations of aba throughout embryogenesis in a _PROTEIN_ loss of function line citation . in wild type seeds aba concentrations were relatively low until days after flowering _PROTEIN_ at which time levels began to increase and reached a peak _PROTEIN_ . after this time they started to _PROTEIN_ again . by contrast aba levels in the _PROTEIN_ seed showed a similar accumulation pattern to wild type up to _PROTEIN_ but from then on failed to accumulate aba to the levels observed in wild type seeds citation . although these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of the aba biosynthesis to directly address this we constructed a _PROTEIN_ inducible system in which the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ from mammalian _METHOD_ was translationally fused to _PROTEIN_ citation . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants . in the absence of the synthetic hormone dexamethasone transgenic seedlings were indistinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ parent but when germinated and grown in the presence of dex transgenic plants produced cotyledonary like vegetative leaves that are characteristic of _PROTEIN_ misexpression . transfer of and day old transgenic seedlings from minimal media to low concentrations of dex for hr immediately increased aba concentrations in two independent seedling samples citation . coupled with the observation that loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutations reduce aba levels these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of aba synthesis . the germination of seed from three independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines all showed increased sensitivity to exogenous aba versus wild type which is consistent with the increased synthesis of aba in misexpressing lines citation . many of the adult _PROTEIN_ misexpression phenotypes are reminiscent of a plant defective in ga synthesis or action . furthermore ga is important in trichome formation in vegetative arabidopsis leaves and _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants have ectopic trichomes on their cotyledons citation . to explore the role of ga on _PROTEIN_ dependent functions a mutation that _PROTEIN_ ga synthesis was introduced into a _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant . double mutants still produced red seeds that were desiccation intolerant indicating that these _PROTEIN_ phenotypes are ga independent . however ectopic trichome production on cotyledons was reduced and many times absent in double mutants indicating that this phenotype does require ga . consistent with this when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were sprayed twice a week with ga the development was more similar to wild type plants citation . plants showed a normal stature bolted on time and both the flower and silique defects were rescued by ga application citation . ga dependent rescue of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines was studied in more detail by following the time of rescue after ga application citation . in contrast to an untreated misexpression line citation addition of ga caused a gradual rescue of the leaf phenotypes such as shape size venation pattern and absence of trichomes citation . the first vegetative leaf of a seedling grown and germinated on ga often resembled an embryonic cotyledon but occasionally developed as a chimeric leaf showing both embryonic and vegetative venation patterns and shapes citation . indeed one half of the leaf did not bear trichomes had a simple venation pattern and was small in size thereby resembling embryonic cotyledons whereas the other half of the leaf was larger possessed several trichomes and showed a more complex venation system . leaf three and successive leaves displayed full rescue of leaf morphology citation . the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and ga is most easily explained by _PROTEIN_ exerting a negative regulation on ga synthesis or action . to test this the levels of transcripts of two key steps in ga biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were assayed using dex inducible _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ misexpression lines . within hr after dex application transcript levels of the _PROTEIN_ showed a slight _PROTEIN_ and by hr the signal was highly reduced as measured by rt pcr citation . the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels also showed a reduction after dex application but the kinetics of reduction were much slower as a clear cut _PROTEIN_ in transcript levels only resulted after days on dex citation . these results clearly indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of ga biosynthesis and explain the prevalence of _PROTEIN_ dependent ga related phenotypes . the ability of ga and aba levels to modulate _PROTEIN_ misexpression phenotypes is unexpected since these two hormones are not usually associated with specifying organ and cellular morphogenesis . however both hormones have been suggested to have roles in speeding up or slowing down various aspects of the plant life cycle . consistent with this as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines continued to develop over a longer period of time the same leaves that started out resembling cotyledons began to develop features that are more characteristic of a vegetative leaf citation . for example before flowering leaves have a cotyledonary shape and venation pattern but after having flowered they have developed a more vegetative venation pattern and leaf shape . the conversion of a cotyledonary leaf into a vegetative leaf over time suggests that the scale of leaf development in a _PROTEIN_ misexpression line is slower than normal . one _PROTEIN_ that determines the size shape and venation patterns of leaves is the rate of cell divisions during leaf primordial expansion citation . to determine if the spatial and temporal patterns of cell cycling in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines are altered a cyclin _PROTEIN_ fusion reporter _PROTEIN_ was introduced into a _PROTEIN_ misexpression line . this construct has been used extensively to characterize patterns of cell divisions in arabidopsis developing leaves citation . as expected in wild type a gradient of punctate gus staining which marks single cell divisions was detected in young leaves emerging from the apical meristem citation . by contrast in similarly aged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines blue staining was highly reduced in emerging foliar organs suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of cell cycling in arabidopsis citation .on this note the ability of ga to rescue _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ phenotypes suggests that application of ga may function to increase the cycling of cells in _PROTEIN_ misexpressing lines . as expected increased gus staining was observed when ga was applied to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ citation . it therefore appears that the ga rescue of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ phenotypes is due to the ability of this hormone to increase cell cycling . in the past few years a number of studies have indicated the role of plant hormones as regulators of the turnover of key proteins involved in hormone signaling citation . to explore a possible role of aba and ga on _PROTEIN_ protein stability we monitored the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vegetative leaves after exposure to aba ga and an inhibitor of ga biosynthesis uniconazole p. in the presence of aba _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is stabilized compared to untreated controls suggesting that the upregulation of aba biosynthesis by _PROTEIN_ may in turn stabilize the _PROTEIN_ protein in vivo . in contrast a day exposure to ga slowly _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal versus control samples citation . consistent with this observation _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was strongly localized to the _LOCATION_ in the presence of uniconazole citation . the ability of aba to stabilize _PROTEIN_ protein explains why _PROTEIN_ aba concentrations using an aba deficient mutant suppressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ phenotypes . similarly the _PROTEIN_ stability of _PROTEIN_ protein in the presence of ga explains why exogenous application of ga suppressed _PROTEIN_ misexpression phenotypes .
all seeds used in this study were of the columbia ecotype . arabidopsis seeds were imbibed for days at and seedlings were grown at under constant light on x _METHOD_ plates supplied with the appropriate hormones or inhibitor . soil grown plants were also grown under constant light . dexamethasone was dissolved in _METHOD_ and used in a final concentration of while ga aba and uniconazole p were dissolved in ethanol and used in a final concentration of . for external ga application plants grown on soil were sprayed three times a week with ga . iaa was dissolved in water and used in a final concentration of . for the construction of the _METHOD_ fusions restriction sites were introduced at the stop and start codon of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ respectively by using oligonucleotide primers and a proofreading polymerase vent for pcr amplification . the resulting pcr product was subcloned into pbluescript and sequenced . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragments were cut from pbluescript using kpni and saci and then assembled into the vector under the control of the kb fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter citation to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or under the control of the kb fragment of _PROTEIN_ promoter to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was constructed by replacing _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor hormone binding domain citation . these constructs were transformed into arabidopsis by the floral dip procedure citation and transgenic plants were selected on x _METHOD_ medium supplemented with kanamycin . primer sequences used to amplify the various pcr fragments were as follows aaggtaccatgatggttgatgaaaatg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tttcccgggcaatggtgagcaagggcgaggag

pcr analysis of total rna that had been extracted using trizol reagent _PROTEIN_ was performed using one step rt pcr kit . pcr cycles were performed with ng of total rna to amplify bp of _PROTEIN_ and bp of _PROTEIN_ using primers described in citation . the amplification of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was used as an _PROTEIN_ standard using primers described in citation . experiments were conducted three times with similar results . to generate the _PROTEIN_ double mutant the mutation from a lansberg ecotype was introgressed seven times into a col genetic background and then crossed to the _PROTEIN_ to obtain population . seed was screened for seeds that were unable to germinate in the absence of ga a common phenotype . seed from individual seedlings were grown and screened for the _PROTEIN_ purple red seed color phenotype . a caps marker of the _PROTEIN_ polymorphism citation was used to confirm the _PROTEIN_ genotype . _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and kanamycin resistant plants were propagated . _PROTEIN_ plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene were crossed to _PROTEIN_ and allowed to self fertilize . seedlings that were resistant to kanamycin were then transferred to soil . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants produce black seeds plants were screened for those segregating black seeds in the citation . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can rescue _PROTEIN_ seed color these plants were expected to be homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ triple homozygous plants expected to produce only a wild type seed color were selected . seedlings homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation were confirmed by a caps marker and the _PROTEIN_ mutation was detected by diagnostic pcr as follows . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primers amplify a kb fragment of the _PROTEIN_ gene using wild type genomic dna as template but fail to amplify a pcr product using _PROTEIN_ genomic dna . the _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines have been previously described citation . detection of gus activity and sectioning was performed as described in citation . leaf tissues were cleared in ethanol and and mounted in the same solution on microscope slides . for confocal analysis embryos at different

microscope equipped with a nikon water immersion objective and a bio rad radiance confocal head . images were processed in adobe photoshop . the extraction and quantitative analyses of aba by gc _METHOD_ were carried out as described previously citation . aba was used as an internal standard citation . siliques and and day old whole seedlings were used for aba measurement . for seed storage
