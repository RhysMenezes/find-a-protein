the biogenesis of _LOCATION_ is mediated by peroxins . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ receptor that imports peroxisomal targeting signal type _PROTEIN_ containing proteins . although _PROTEIN_ is important for protein transport the _METHOD_ that mediate its function are unknown . in this study we performed proteomic analysis to identify _PROTEIN_ binding proteins using transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . our analysis identified _PROTEIN_ a small _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ binding partner . in vivo analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ binds to _PROTEIN_ and that a subset of _PROTEIN_ localizes to _LOCATION_ and interacts with _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . unlike endogenous _PROTEIN_ which is predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates abnormally on the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and induces degradation of endogenous _PROTEIN_ concomitant with a reduction in import of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins and _PROTEIN_ peroxisomal oxidation activity . thus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ exerts a dominant negative effect . mutation of _PROTEIN_ restored endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and import of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins as well as peroxisomal oxidation activity . treatment with proteasome inhibitors also restored endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein levels in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . based on these findings we conclude that _PROTEIN_ binds _PROTEIN_ and facilitates _PROTEIN_ degradation in the presence of immobile _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated at the _LOCATION_ .
to further our understanding of the molecular mechanism that mediates _PROTEIN_ translocation we conducted proteomic analysis to identify _PROTEIN_ binding proteins using transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ results in localization of _METHOD_ to the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is an integral peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to localize to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were used as a reference in order to identify nonspecific contaminating proteins present in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ samples . seedlings of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were homogenized in buffer containing ddm or digitonin and incubated with anti _METHOD_ antibody conjugated microbeads prior to immunoprecipitation . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was efficiently affinity purified as determined by its presence in the purified fraction . in parallel the purified fraction from each sample was subjected to separation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by silver staining to visualize the proteins in purified fractions . in addition to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ itself whose molecular _METHOD_ is about kda a number of protein bands were detected in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ samples . bands that were not present in the purified fractions from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were presumed to represent proteins that purified specifically with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the eluted fractions were subjected to _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis to identify the purified proteins . the results revealed that proteins were co immunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of digitonin and proteins were co immunoprecipitated in the presence of ddm . then we presumed that the proteins that purified with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both the digitonin and ddm experiments stably interact with _PROTEIN_ and we therefore selected these proteins as candidate _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . a total of such proteins were identified each with a protein score higher than as calculated by the mascot search engine . of these proteins purified only with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and not with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that those proteins specifically bound to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . some of the proteins identified in this manner have been previously reported to bind to _PROTEIN_ . for example _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ receptor and directly binds to _PROTEIN_ in plants . we also identified eight subunits of the t complex which are homologs of the components of the mouse _PROTEIN_ complex a _LOCATION_ chaperonin . the t complex binds to the repeat of _PROTEIN_ in yeast and animal cells . two small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were newly identified in our experiment . we examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in leek epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed predominantly in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and unidentified particles . the punctate structures distinct from the _LOCATION_ might represent the _LOCATION_ complex because another member of the family is localized to the _LOCATION_ complex and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ and to particulate structures distinct from _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ . to confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo we performed a bifc assay . to this end we constructed two chimeric genes one encoding the n terminal half of _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the other encoding the c terminal half of _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these proteins along with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ a peroxisomal marker were transiently _PROTEIN_ in leek epidermal cells . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed exclusively on _LOCATION_ as identified by the red _METHOD_ signal of tdtomato _PROTEIN_ . no signal was detected in control cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically interact with each other on _LOCATION_ in vivo . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ binding is crucial for the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ we generated three mutant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ containing amino acid substitutions ser to asn _PROTEIN_ gln to leu _PROTEIN_ and asn to ile _PROTEIN_ . in many rab and ras like _PROTEIN_ these amino acid substitutions correspond to _PROTEIN_ mutations that alter nucleotide affinity resulting in either a gdp bound dominant negative form or a _PROTEIN_ bound constitutively active form . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predicted to be the gdp bound dominant negative _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ should produce the _PROTEIN_ bound constitutively active form . each construct was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in leek epidermal cells along with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . a punctate _METHOD_ signal was observed only in cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the observed green punctate structures were the same as the structures identified as _LOCATION_ in cells _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . no signal was detected in cells _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ but not gdp bound _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is involved in various functions related to peroxisomal protein transport . therefore we assessed the involvement of the _PROTEIN_ binding protein _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ function . to analyze the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ we used an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant . peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation is the _PROTEIN_ pathway for the catabolism of seed reserved lipids . this pathway also converts db to d which inhibits root elongation at an early stage of seedling growth in arabidopsis . therefore mutants with deficient peroxisomal oxidation are resistant to db but sensitive to d . db sensitivity was evaluated by monitoring the seedling growth of _PROTEIN_ knock out plants . the root growth of _PROTEIN_ seedlings during germination was sensitive to db to an extent similar to that of wild type plants . peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation is responsible for the mobilization of seed reserved lipid into sucrose in seedlings . therefore mutants with deficient peroxisomal oxidation require exogenously applied sucrose for successful establishment of seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ seedlings grew without sucrose as well as wild type seedlings did . these findings indicate that peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation is not impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . next we examined the growth of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition we crossed _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants to generate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and the growth of these plants was examined under the same conditions . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were resistant to db and required exogenous sucrose for germination indicating that the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ results in reduced peroxisomal oxidation activity . this finding suggests that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has a negative effect on _LOCATION_ biogenesis . however this phenotype was rescued by the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants as demonstrated by the observation that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were db sensitive and sucrose independent to a degree similar to wild type plants . this result shows that defective peroxisomal oxidation in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings can be restored by the loss of _PROTEIN_ function . because defective peroxisomal oxidation is often attributed to reduced transport of peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ enzymes we measured the peroxisomal import of ketoacyl coa thiolase a _PROTEIN_ containing protein that catalyzes the last step of oxidation . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ containing proteins are synthesized in the _LOCATION_ as longer precursor peptides . after entry into _LOCATION_ they are processed into their mature _METHOD_ via the removal of their _PROTEIN_ sequences by the peroxisomal protease _PROTEIN_ endopeptidase . accumulation of the ketoacyl coa thiolase precursor was detected in _PROTEIN_ knockdown plants as previously reported . this thiolase precursor was not detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings indicating that the import of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins occurs normally in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast a significant amount of thiolase precursor was detected in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings suggesting that the import of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins is reduced in these plants . these results were consistent with the defect in peroxisomal oxidation observed in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . by contrast almost no thiolase precursor was detected in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation diminished the effect of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this result was consistent with the rescue of peroxisomal oxidation in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants observed during germination . because _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the import of _PROTEIN_ proteins we measured the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in wild type and mutant plants . the amount of endogenous _PROTEIN_ was the same in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants but the level was reduced in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein reduces the level of endogenous _PROTEIN_ leading to reduced import of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins . however endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein was restored to wild type levels in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced reduction of _PROTEIN_ . no significant difference in the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was observed between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the reduction in _PROTEIN_ accumulation in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants occurs in the _LOCATION_ homogenates prepared from day old dark grown seedlings were separated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by centrifugation at g. these fractions were then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to immunoblot analysis . two peroxisomal proteins thiolase and _PROTEIN_ were used as markers of soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions respectively . as expected thiolase and _PROTEIN_ were recovered in the soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions respectively confirming that the fractionation technique was effective . in wild type plants the majority of _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the soluble fraction . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited a similar _PROTEIN_ level and accumulation pattern to that of wild type plants . in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants however the _PROTEIN_ level was significantly reduced in the soluble fraction whereas its level in the _LOCATION_ fraction remained similar to that of wild type plants indicating a reduction in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the level of soluble _PROTEIN_ was restored to that of wild type plants in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plant indicating that loss of _PROTEIN_ activity increased the _LOCATION_ proportion of _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . surprisingly in contrast to endogenous _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was abundant in the insoluble _LOCATION_ fraction in both the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels were identical in these two types of seedlings in both the soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . these findings suggest that unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is stacked on the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and is not dislocated to the _LOCATION_ by its defective release from the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ and then dislocated into the _LOCATION_ in yeast and mammals . in yeast _LOCATION_ binding of _PROTEIN_ requires the auxiliary proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these auxiliary proteins are polyubiquitinated at the last step of dislocation a modification that destines them for degradation via the s proteasome . however it is not known whether _PROTEIN_ is degraded by the proteasome . to determine whether the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ involves proteasome mediated degradation in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants we examined the effect of two proteasome inhibitors and lactacystin . seedlings were treated with either inhibitor for h and homogenized and _PROTEIN_ protein levels were determined by immunoblot analysis . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ protein level was significantly increased in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants after proteasome inhibitor treatment to a level comparable with that in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . neither inhibitor had any effect on the level of _PROTEIN_ in wild type or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is degraded by the proteasome in the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .
arabidopsis thaliana wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ knockdown and transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were used . the _PROTEIN_ knockdown and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were described previously . a _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the presence of a t dna insertion was confirmed by pcr with a _PROTEIN_ specific primer conjugated with at the end and the t dna specific primer salk _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to generate a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plant . these plants were grown on germination medium containing agar half strength murashige skoog salts myo inositol thiamine hcl pyridoxine nicotinic acid mes koh and sucrose . in some experiments dichlorophenoxybutyric acid was added or sucrose was removed from the growth medium as indicated . germination was induced under

incubated for min on ice with magnetic beads conjugated to an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the mixtures were then applied to columns and beads were recovered in a magnetic field . the columns were washed three times with homogenization buffer followed by elution of the protein complexes with the provided elution buffer . in gel digestion was performed to digest the isolated protein complex into peptides . the fractions eluted from the immunoprecipitations were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the gel was washed twice with distilled water _METHOD_ three times with acetonitrile for h and once with acetonitrile for min and then dried in vacuum . the dried gel was incubated with reduction buffer at for h and then in alkylation buffer at for min and then washed twice with mm ammonium bicarbonate . the samples were dehydrated by two min incubations in dehydration buffer acetonitrile and mm ammonium bicarbonate and one min incubation with acetonitrile and then digested with mg/ml trypsin in mm ammonium bicarbonate at for h. the digested peptides were recovered with formic acid and acetonitrile and with acetic acid and acetonitrile respectively . the extracted peptides were combined and filtered through a filter by centrifugation at g for min to remove any debris . the samples were then subjected to _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis using an ltq orbitrap xl htc _PROTEIN_ system . to generate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs cdna fragments of each gene with and attached at their and ends respectively were amplified by rt pcr using gene specific primer sets _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the entry vector using the gateway _PROTEIN_ recombination method . subsequently the vectors were transferred into the destination vector using the gateway lr recombination method . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were cloned into the vector and subsequently transferred into the destination vectors pgwcy and pnygw respectively to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ and lr recombination methods as described above . the _PROTEIN_ vector ptdgw harboring the tdtomato gene was used as a marker for transformation and the vector ptdtomato _PROTEIN_ harboring the td tomato _PROTEIN_ gene was used as a marker for _LOCATION_ . standard procedures for transient _PROTEIN_ experiments were described previously . mixtures of the appropriate combinations of plasmids were coated on gold particles in diameter and bombarded into leek epidermal cells using the _PROTEIN_ biolistic particle delivery system resulting in coexpression of these proteins in the same cells after a h incubation in the dark at room temperature . imaging analysis of transfected cells was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the leek epidermis was observed using a zeiss lsm confocal laser scanning microscope . lasers with wavelengths of and nm were used for excitation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively . for detection of emission the following filters were used nm band pass for _METHOD_ nm band pass for _METHOD_ and nm band pass for _METHOD_ . total proteins were extracted from each plant by homogenization in sample buffer glycerol mercaptoethanol and _PROTEIN_ . protein concentration was measured using the bio rad protein assay with bovine albumin as the
