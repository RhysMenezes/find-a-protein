zea mays and arabidopsis thaliana brittle _PROTEIN_ are members of the mitochondrial carrier family . although they are presumed to be exclusively localized in the envelope _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ confocal _METHOD_ microscopy analyses of potato arabidopsis and maize plants stably _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions of and _PROTEIN_ revealed that the two proteins have dual localization to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . the patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distribution observed in plants stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions of and _PROTEIN_ n terminal extensions were fully congruent with that of plants _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ marker fused to _METHOD_ . furthermore the patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distribution and motility observed in plants _PROTEIN_ the mature proteins fused to _METHOD_ were identical to those observed in plants _PROTEIN_ a mitochondrial marker fused to _METHOD_ . electron microscopic immunocytochemical analyses of maize _METHOD_ using anti antibodies further confirmed that occurs in both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . the overall data showed that and _PROTEIN_ are dually targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and n terminal extensions comprise targeting sequences exclusively recognized by the _LOCATION_ compartment and targeting sequences to mitochondria are localized within the mature part of the _PROTEIN_ proteins .
we produced and characterized arabidopsis potato and maize plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . these plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ translationally fused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ encoding genes under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the ubiquitin promoter . _PROTEIN_ of these constructs was confirmed by immunoblot analyses using antisera raised against and _METHOD_ . as it is possible that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of genes may cause mislocalization of the encoded proteins we analyzed plants from independent lines per construct to ensure the attainment of reliable data . confocal microscopy analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants revealed that consistent with previous studies showing the _LOCATION_ localization of strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ co localized with the red _METHOD_ of maize arabidopsis and potato _PROTEIN_ mesophyll chloroplasts . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also observed in chl deficient or chl lacking _LOCATION_ of epidermal cells . these analyses also revealed that _METHOD_ clearly localized in the periphery and poles of large starch granules containing amyloplasts of potato tuber cells . most important however was the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ also occurred in organelles whose size shape and motility patterns clearly resembled those of mitochondria . to investigate further the possible mitochondrial localization of _METHOD_ we carried out confocal microscopy analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ potato tubers that had previously been incubated with mito tracker red a specific mitochondrial probe . these analyses revealed that the distribution and motility of mito tracker red and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ unmistakably overlapped with small non _LOCATION_ highly motile structures . the overall data thus showed that has a dual cellular localization to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . confocal microscopy analyses of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized in the _LOCATION_ compartment of arabidopsis mesophyll cells and potato mesophyll _PROTEIN_ and tuber cells which is consistent with previous studies showing the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . however rigorous analyses also showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly co localized in organelles whose size shape and motility patterns resembled those of mitochondria . subsequent confocal microscopy analyses of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ potato tubers that had previously been incubated with mito tracker red clearly revealed that the distribution and motility of mito tracker red and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ completely overlapped in small non _LOCATION_ highly motile structures . the overall data thus showed that _PROTEIN_ has a dual localization to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . we hypothesized that the dual localization of _PROTEIN_ and would result from the presence in the pre mature _PROTEIN_ and of n terminal extensions acting as ambiguous targeting sequences that are recognized as import signals by both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . to test this hypothesis we carried out confocal _METHOD_ microscopy analyses of plants _PROTEIN_ the n terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ and fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . furthermore we analyzed the _METHOD_ distribution in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions of and _PROTEIN_ lacking the n terminal region _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as a control for _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial localization we used plants _PROTEIN_ the tp of _LOCATION_ fused to _METHOD_ and a mitochondria targeting pre sequence _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these analyses revealed that the _METHOD_ distribution of tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tp _METHOD_ was fully congruent with that of tp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ being exclusively localized in _LOCATION_ . it is noteworthy that these analyses also showed that the patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distribution and motility observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were identical to those observed in mittpr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ targeting sequences are located in the n terminal extension of the protein whereas mitochondria targeting sequences are located within the mature protein . to investigate this possibility further we carried out confocal _METHOD_ microscopy analyses of plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions of proteins obtained upon replacement of the n terminal extension of and _PROTEIN_ by the tp of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions of proteins obtained upon replacement of the n terminal extension of and _PROTEIN_ by the mitochondria targeting pre sequence of the _PROTEIN_ subunit _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these analyses revealed that similarly to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tp _METHOD_ and tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized in both the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial compartments . in clear contrast mittpr _METHOD_ and mittpr _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were exclusively localized to mitochondria . the overall data thus strongly indicated that the n terminal extensions of _PROTEIN_ and comprise targeting sequences recognized by the _LOCATION_ compartment but not by mitochondria and targeting sequences to mitochondria are localized within the mature part of _PROTEIN_ and proteins . citation and citation showed that and _PROTEIN_ are exclusively localized at the inner envelope _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ . intriguingly however the _METHOD_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants presented in figs . and supplementary fig . were markedly different from that of other proteins exclusively localized in _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ and suggested that _PROTEIN_ and are also localized in the interior part of _LOCATION_ . this is in agreement with previous em immunocytochemical analyses showing that a large amount of occurs inside the amyloplast in maize endosperm cells . furthermore our observations are consistent with recent reports showing the presence of and rice _PROTEIN_ in internal starch granule channels . the occurrence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the interior part of _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants is also consistent with the _METHOD_ localization pattern in _LOCATION_ of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to investigate this phenomenon further we carried out em immunocytochemical analyses of in young endosperm cells . because of the difficulty in sectioning and analyzing _LOCATION_ with large starch granules these analyses were carried out with _METHOD_ at early stages of starch accumulation . at this developmental stage endosperm cells exhibited large _LOCATION_ and amyloplasts containing starch grains of different sizes when analyzed by light microscopy . to preserve antigenicity and ultrastructure for appropriate immunogold assays endosperm samples were processed and resin embedded at low temperature . em analyses of dap endosperm cells showed mitochondria and numerous _LOCATION_ of different shapes and sizes corresponding to immature amyloplasts accumulating small starch granules some of them having transverse/radial denser regions corresponding to channels that connect the interior cavity of the starch granule with the outside surface . confirming the occurrence of the dual localization of em immunocytochemical analyses revealed that anti immunogold labeling was localized at the periphery of amyloplasts and mitochondria the cytoplasm and other subcellular compartments being essentially free of labeling . consistent with our _METHOD_ confocal microscopy analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants presented in fig . and supplementary figs . a large amount of the anti immunogold labeling was also found over internal regions of amyloplasts and mitochondria . since low temperature resins normally provide low electron density and contrast to subcellular structures a modification of the processing was performed by adding a contrasting agent during dehydration resulting in a general increase in the electron density of most subcellular structures . as shown in fig . the pattern of distribution of immunogold labeling was similar to that of fig . being localized at both internal and peripheral regions of _LOCATION_ and mitochondria and being absent in other subcellular compartments such as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles and _LOCATION_ . controls avoiding the primary antibody did not provide significant labeling on any subcellular structure .
