actin filaments are thought to play an important role in intracellular trafficking in various eukaryotic cells . however their involvement in intracellular trafficking in plant cells has not been clearly demonstrated . here we investigated the roles actin filaments play in intracellular trafficking in plant cells using latrunculin b an inhibitor of actin filament assembly or actin mutants that disrupt actin filaments when overexpressed . lat b and mutant overexpression inhibited the trafficking of two _LOCATION_ reporter proteins sporamin green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and arabidopsis thaliana aleurain like protein _METHOD_ to the central _LOCATION_ instead a punctate staining pattern was observed . colocalization experiments with various marker proteins indicated that these punctate stains corresponded to the _LOCATION_ complex . the a. thaliana _LOCATION_ sorting receptor vsr at which _PROTEIN_ localizes to the prevacuolar compartment also accumulated at the _LOCATION_ complex in the presence of lat b . however lat b had no effect on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking of sialyltransferase or retrograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking . lat b also failed to influence the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ trafficking of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the secretion of invertase _METHOD_ . based on these observations we propose that actin filaments play a critical role in the trafficking of proteins from the _LOCATION_ complex to the central _LOCATION_ .
to investigate the roles played by actin filaments during intracellular trafficking we examined the effect of lat b an agent known to disassemble the actin filaments on the trafficking of _LOCATION_ cargo proteins . as an experimental system we used protoplasts derived from arabidopsis leaf tissues . first we determined the effective concentration of lat b needed to disassemble the actin filaments in these protoplasts because the lat b concentrations used in previous studies with plant cells varied greatly from a few nanomoles per liter to several hundred micromoles per liter . thus protoplasts were treated with varying lat b concentrations after which protein extracts were prepared and fractionated by low speed centrifugation into pellet and soluble fractions which contain the filamentous and soluble _METHOD_ of actin respectively . the actin in these fractions was detected by protein gel blot analysis using an anti actin antibody . in the absence of lat b the majority of actin was detected in the pellet fraction . in the presence of up to lat b the majority of actin was still detected in the pellet fraction although the amount of the soluble form did gradually increase as the lat b concentration rose . by contrast at lat b of the actin was detected in the soluble fraction which indicates that lat b may be the appropriate concentration to use with arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . as a control for the fractionation we detected the _LOCATION_ localized chaperonine binding protein by protein gel blot analysis using an anti bip antibody . the majority of bip was detected in the soluble fraction indicating that bip is not pelleted by this low speed centrifugation and this fractionation pattern of bip was not affected by up to lat b . to obtain independent evidence that the actin filaments are disassembled by lat b we visualized the actin filaments by transforming the protoplasts with _METHOD_ talin which _PROTEIN_ a chimeric protein consisting of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the actin binding domain of talin . _METHOD_ microscopy of the protoplasts showed that in the absence of lat b _METHOD_ talin revealed numerous networks that indicate actin networks . by contrast at lat b _METHOD_ talin showed a diffuse pattern indicating that the actin filaments are disassembled . previous studies have shown that lat b in a nanomolar concentration is sufficient to disassemble the actin filaments in pollen tubes whereas and were used with tobacco leaf and by cells respectively . thus although the lat b concentration needed to disassemble the actin filaments in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts is much higher than that used with pollen tubes it is similar to that used with tobacco leaf cells . next we examined whether two _LOCATION_ reporter proteins namely _METHOD_ fused sporamin _METHOD_ and arabidopsis aleurain like protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are targeted to the central _LOCATION_ in the presence of lat b. sporamin is a tuber protein of sweet potato whereas _PROTEIN_ is a cys protease homologous to barley aleurain both have been shown to be targeted to the central _LOCATION_ in both their native form and as part of a _METHOD_ fusion protein . protoplasts transformed with spo _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were incubated with lat b and the localization of the _METHOD_ signal was examined at various time points after transformation . in the absence of lat b both reporter proteins were targeted to the central _LOCATION_ . we also observed spo _METHOD_ distributed in an _LOCATION_ pattern which suggests that the spo _METHOD_ in a fraction of the transformed protoplasts had not yet been transported to the central _LOCATION_ at this time point . in the presence of lat b however the majority of protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a novel punctate staining pattern and the number of protoplasts with a _METHOD_ positive central _LOCATION_ was significantly reduced . this also was true for the spo _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts . in the presence of lat b notably the spo _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts showed three new patterns namely a punctate staining pattern alone a punctate staining pattern together with the _LOCATION_ pattern and a punctate staining pattern together with the _LOCATION_ pattern in addition to the two typical _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ patterns . furthermore when we examined the effect of lat b on the trafficking of spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco leaf cell protoplasts we obtained similar results which indicates that lat b may have a similar effect on _LOCATION_ trafficking in other plant cells . we next determined how many spo _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts had _LOCATION_ versus punctate _METHOD_ staining patterns . as shown in figure in the absence of lat b and of the spo _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts had _METHOD_ positive central _LOCATION_ at and h respectively . by contrast in the presence of lat b and of protoplasts had the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ staining pattern at and h respectively indicating significantly reduced _LOCATION_ trafficking of spo _METHOD_ . moreover in the presence of lat b and of the protoplasts had a punctate _METHOD_ staining pattern at and h respectively whereas this staining pattern was absent in the control protoplasts . in the presence of lat b the _LOCATION_ staining pattern of spo _METHOD_ was reduced to from . the reason for this reduction is not clearly understood at the moment . at the least this is in part because of the way by which we counted the protoplasts a small fraction of protoplasts that has the punctate staining pattern together with the _LOCATION_ pattern was counted as the punctate staining pattern . these results strongly suggest that lat b inhibits the _LOCATION_ trafficking of spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . while the above results suggest that lat b interferes with _LOCATION_ trafficking this method suffers from the possibility that prolonged exposure to lat b may have had a side effect on various cellular processes in protoplasts that indirectly affect the _LOCATION_ trafficking of cargo proteins . to obtain independent evidence for actin filament involvement in _LOCATION_ trafficking we sought to interfere with the normal function of actin filaments by overexpressing actin mutants . in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ of or results in a dominant lethal phenotype . the residue in yeast is surface exposed and is thought to interact with divalent metal ions or nucleotides . arabidopsis is the most abundant actin isoform in arabidopsis vegetative tissues residue of arabidopsis with lys or gln to generate mutants equivalent to yeast or . in addition the proteins were tagged with the small epitope hemagglutinin to distinguish the introduced molecules from the endogenous actins . first we examined the effect of overexpressing ha ha or wild type ha on the morphology of actin filaments in protoplasts . the actin filaments were visualized by cotransforming the cells with _METHOD_ talin . as shown in figure protoplasts transformed with wild type showed numerous actin filaments in a staining pattern that was nearly identical to that of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ talin alone . thus overexpression of wild type does not affect morphology of actin filaments . by contrast overexpression of or in the protoplasts resulted in a diffuse staining pattern of _METHOD_ talin which strongly suggests that transiently _PROTEIN_ and disrupt endogenous actin filaments . approximately of the protoplasts transformed with showed a diffuse staining pattern of _METHOD_ talin . the _PROTEIN_ of the introduced proteins was confirmed by protein gel blot analysis using a monoclonal anti ha antibody . thus or overexpression may be used in place of lat b to disrupt actin filaments . we next examined the _LOCATION_ trafficking of spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of or overexpression . as expected overexpression of wild type did not affect the staining pattern of spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the percentage of wild type transformed protoplasts that showed the _LOCATION_ staining pattern which indicates the _LOCATION_ trafficking efficiency of spo _METHOD_ was and at and h after transformation respectively which was nearly the same as when the protoplasts were only transformed with spo _METHOD_ . however or overexpression produced a punctate staining pattern for spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ trafficking efficiency of spo _METHOD_ was greatly reduced . furthermore the degree to which the mutants inhibited _LOCATION_ trafficking was nearly comparable to that of lat b . this was rather unexpected because the percentage of protoplasts showing the diffuse actin pattern in the presence of an mutant was approximately half of that observed upon lat b treatment . one possible explanation is that mutants may be incorporated into actin filaments as actin subunits and these actin filaments with the mutants may not be functional even though they are morphologically filamentous _METHOD_ . to examine this possibility protoplasts were transformed with ha or ha after which protein extracts were prepared and fractionated by low speed centrifugation into pellet and soluble fractions which contain the filamentous and soluble _METHOD_ of actin respectively . the mutants in these fractions were detected by protein gel blot analysis using an anti ha antibody . approximately of mutants was detected in the pellet fraction which indicates that a portion of mutants may be incorporated into the actin filaments . together these results further support the notion that actin filaments play a critical role in the trafficking of _LOCATION_ proteins in plant cells . next we performed colocalization experiments with marker proteins to identify the organelle in which _LOCATION_ cargo proteins accumulate in the presence of lat b . because _LOCATION_ proteins are transported to the central _LOCATION_ through the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the pvc we reasoned that the punctate staining pattern may correspond to either of these organelles . first we examined the colocalization in lat b treated protoplasts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and rat sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ tagged with ha because _PROTEIN_ has been shown to localize to the _LOCATION_ complex in plant cells . the majority of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the punctate stains colocalized with the _PROTEIN_ ha signals at the _LOCATION_ complex . interestingly however a portion of the punctate stains of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not exactly overlap the _PROTEIN_ ha molecules rather they colocalized side by side . this indicates that in the presence of lat b _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may localize at the _LOCATION_ complex but at a slightly different location within the _LOCATION_ complex than that of _PROTEIN_ ha which is thought to _PROTEIN_ localize at the trans _LOCATION_ . to examine the localization further we compared the localization in lat b treated protoplasts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with that of _PROTEIN_ tagged with ha _PROTEIN_ . a previous study showed that _PROTEIN_ a v snare and its tagged form localize at the tgn and the pvc and are thought to travel from the tgn to the pvc together with vesicles . unlike when _PROTEIN_ ha was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the green punctate staining pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ more closely overlapped the red punctate staining pattern of _PROTEIN_ ha that was detected by an anti ha antibody . thus these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates at the _LOCATION_ complex and quite possibly at the tgn . furthermore > of _PROTEIN_ positive punctate stains closely overlapped with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals which was rather unexpected because _PROTEIN_ is distributed in equal measure to both the tgn and the pvc . one possible reason for this is that like spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ha may not travel to the pvc in the presence of lat b . to obtain additional evidence for localization of _LOCATION_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ complex in the presence of lat b we compared the localization in lat b treated protoplasts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endogenous _LOCATION_ sorting receptor /a . thaliana epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ receptor like protein at _PROTEIN_ . vsr at _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ sorting receptor of arabidopsis localizes to both the tgn and the pvc although its primary residence is the pvc . surprisingly the majority of the green punctate stains also overlapped the red punctate stains of endogenous vsr at _PROTEIN_ that was detected with an anti vsr at antibody . that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalizes with both _PROTEIN_ ha and vsr at _PROTEIN_ is rather contradictory because _PROTEIN_ ha localizes to the _LOCATION_ complex whereas vsr at localizes primarily to the pvc . vsr is thought to travel to the pvc from the tgn . thus one possible explanation for this is that like _PROTEIN_ ha vsr at _PROTEIN_ may not travel to the pvc from the tgn in the presence of lat b . to address this possibility we first examined the distribution of vsr at in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts in the absence of lat b . we used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as another pvc marker and compared the localization of vsr at with ha tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ localizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . as shown in figure the majority of the vsr at positive speckles overlapped the _PROTEIN_ ha positive punctate stains whereas a minor portion overlapped the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive punctate stains . when these colocalization patterns were quantified of the vsr at positive speckles overlapped _PROTEIN_ ha and overlapped with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus the majority of vsr at normally localizes at the pvc similar to what has been observed in root cells albeit to a lesser degree . next we examined the degree to which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and vsr at overlap in the presence of lat b . as shown in figure the majority of vsr at colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with only a minor portion of vsr at positive speckles failing to colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . when the overlap was quantified of the vsr at positive speckles closely overlapped the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles in the presence of lat b in contrast with in the absence of lat b . thus in the presence of lat b the overlap between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and vsr at increased by approximately twofold indicating that lat b also affects the localization of vsr at . these results suggest that in the presence of lat b vsr at may not be able to leave the tgn similar to _PROTEIN_ ha which in turn results in the accumulation of both vsr at and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the tgn . to confirm the specificity of the antibodies we used to detect endogenous vsr at and transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha we performed protein gel blot analysis using proteins extracts prepared from _PROTEIN_ ha transformed protoplasts . as shown in figure the anti vsr and anti ha antibodies were highly specific for vsr at and _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ respectively . to obtain additional evidence for the inhibition of _LOCATION_ trafficking by lat b we analyzed the localization of the reporter proteins after fractionation of the transformed and lat b treated cells . a previous study demonstrated that _LOCATION_ can be separated from the nonvacuolar fraction by ultracentrifugation using a ficoll step gradient . thus lat b treated and untreated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts were loaded on top of a step gradient consisting of and ficoll and fractionated by ultracentrifugation . when the lat b untreated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts were fractionated the proteolytically processed form of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is thought to be generated in the _LOCATION_ or post _LOCATION_ compartments was detected in the _LOCATION_ containing top fraction whereas the unprocessed form was present in the pellet fraction . however lat b treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts gave the same fractionation pattern although lat b treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts showed different _METHOD_ staining patterns from that of untreated samples . this suggests that the ficoll step gradient can not separate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive lat b induced speckles from the _LOCATION_ . because the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctate staining compartment appeared to cofractionate with the _LOCATION_ in the top fraction we modified the gradient to include and ficoll layers on top of the layer . the lat b treated and untreated protoplasts were loaded on top of the modified gradient and fractionated by ultracentrifugation . using a hemocytometer we determined the number of _LOCATION_ in each fraction and found that of the _LOCATION_ were present in the top fraction with this percentage gradually _PROTEIN_ with increasing ficoll concentrations . lat b treatment did not affect the distribution of the _LOCATION_ in the gradient . next we examined the distribution of endogenous vsr at in lat b treated and untreated untransformed protoplasts . in the absence of lat b vsr at was broadly distributed from the top to the fraction with a slightly higher amount in the fraction . however the distribution pattern of vsr at in the presence of lat b was quite different because of the vsr at had accumulated in the fraction . this result _METHOD_ that lat b alters the subcellular distribution of vsr at . furthermore these results suggest that the fraction may contain the lat b induced speckles . we then used protein gel blot analysis to assess the respective presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and spo _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and spo _METHOD_ transformed protoplast fractions that were obtained using the modified gradient . as shown in figures and in the absence of lat b and of the processed _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and spo _METHOD_ respectively were present in the top fraction and gradually _PROTEIN_ as the ficoll concentration increased indicating that these reporter proteins were transported to the central _LOCATION_ . by contrast in the presence of lat b the amounts of the proteolytically processed _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and spo _METHOD_ in the top fraction were reduced to and respectively whereas the fraction contained of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of the spo _METHOD_ suggesting that lat b inhibits the transport of these proteins to the central _LOCATION_ . next we examined the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in untransformed lat b treated and untreated protoplasts . in the absence of lat b of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ was found in the top fraction and this amount gradually _PROTEIN_ as the ficoll concentration increased as was observed with the _METHOD_ reporter proteins . by contrast in the presence of lat b the highest amount of _PROTEIN_ was found in the fraction but not in the top fraction which indicates that lat b also affects the trafficking of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ that the amount of _PROTEIN_ present in the fraction is higher than that present in the _LOCATION_ was rather surprising because endogenous _PROTEIN_ is likely present in the _LOCATION_ even before lat b treatment . to explain the lower level of _PROTEIN_ in the top fraction than that in the fraction upon lat b treatment we postulated that the amount of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ is rapidly reduced without continuous supply of newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ . to address this question we examined the turnover rate of endogenous _PROTEIN_ by measuring the endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels in the presence and absence of cycloheximide an inhibitor of protein synthesis . after treating protoplasts with cycloheximide for h the amount of _PROTEIN_ was reduced to of that in the control protoplasts which indicates that _PROTEIN_ has to be continually supplied to the _LOCATION_ to _PROTEIN_ its levels there . these results clearly demonstrate that in the presence of lat b the majority of _LOCATION_ proteins are not transported to the central _LOCATION_ rather they accumulate in the fraction even though they are processed into smaller _METHOD_ . in addition these results demonstrate that in the presence of lat b proteins destined to go to the central _LOCATION_ cofractionate with the _LOCATION_ sorting receptor vsr at in the gradient which further _METHOD_ the immunohistochemistry result that showed the majority of vsr at colocalizes with spo _METHOD_ in a punctate staining pattern . we examined the effects of lat b on other trafficking pathways using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as reporter proteins for the trafficking to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared in a punctate staining pattern in the presence and absence of lat b indicating that lat b does not affect its trafficking from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to unequivocally demonstrate that this punctate staining pattern represents the _LOCATION_ apparatus the protoplasts displaying this pattern were treated with bfa a chemical agent known to disrupt the _LOCATION_ apparatus . as shown in figure both in the presence and absence of lat b bfa treatment generated a network pattern of the green _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that closely overlapped the red _METHOD_ signal of bip red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ a marker protein that localizes to the _LOCATION_ . this result indicates that bfa induces the relocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ both in the presence and absence of lat b . this is consistent with the results from a previous study that showed that trafficking of cargo proteins from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ or from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ is not inhibited by lat b . in addition because bfa treatment can induce the relocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ actin filaments may not be required for retrograde trafficking in plant cells . this contrasts with what has been observed in animal cells namely that lat b inhibits retrograde trafficking from the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ . next we investigated the trafficking of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the presence of lat b. h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is thought to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through the _LOCATION_ apparatus because bfa treatment inhibits this targeting . as shown in figure the h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution pattern was the same in the presence or absence of lat b which indicates that lat b treatment does not affect the trafficking of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to confirm this we estimated the percentage of transformed protoplasts showing the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . more than of the h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts showed _METHOD_ signals at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the presence or absence of lat b confirming that lat b does not affect this trafficking . together these results suggest that actin filaments may not play a role in the trafficking from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus or from the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in leaf protoplasts . to further understand the roles actin filaments play in intracellular trafficking we examined the effect of lat b and on the secretory pathway . as a reporter protein for the secretory pathway we selected a secreted form of invertase and tagged it with _METHOD_ at its c terminus . protoplasts were transformed with invertase _METHOD_ together with _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ protein that was included as a control for the secretion . the localization of the green and red _METHOD_ signals was examined at various time points after transformation . in both the presence and absence of lat b the transformed protoplasts did not show detectable levels of green _METHOD_ signals although strong red _METHOD_ signals were readily observed . however the green _METHOD_ signals of invertase _METHOD_ were readily detected in the protoplasts when the trafficking of invertase _METHOD_ was inhibited by coexpressing _PROTEIN_ a dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ that is known to inhibit anterograde trafficking from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ complex . thus the lack of green _METHOD_ signals is likely to be as a result of the efficient secretion of invertase _METHOD_ into the medium . to confirm this proteins were obtained separately from protoplasts and the incubation medium at different time points after transformation and analyzed by protein gel blot analysis with anti _METHOD_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . in the control lat b untreated protoplasts invertase _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in the medium proteins and not in the protoplast proteins . indeed to detect any invertase _METHOD_ signals in the protoplast protein preparation an identical protein gel blot had to be greatly overexposed . by contrast _METHOD_ was detected only in the proteins prepared from the protoplasts . thus the localization of invertase _METHOD_ in the medium is likely as a result of secretion rather than breakage of protoplasts . next we examined the effect of lat b and on the secretion of invertase _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ of was confirmed by protein gel blot analysis using an anti actin antibody . in the presence of both lat b and the amount of invertase _METHOD_ that accumulated in the medium was nearly the same as that obtained in the absence of either treatment at both time points . this indicates that the secretion of invertase _METHOD_ in the presence of lat b occurs as efficiently as in the absence of lat b . furthermore even in the presence of lat b and the amount of _METHOD_ in the protoplast proteins and the amount of invertase _METHOD_ in the medium were continuously increased up to h after transformation . moreover the levels to which these proteins increased were nearly the same as those in the absence of lat b or which strongly suggests that protoplasts in the presence of both lat b and are still active in the translation of proteins as well as their secretion . these results strongly suggest that actin filaments may not be required for the secretion of invertase _METHOD_ .
arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco plants were grown on plates in a growth chamber . leaf tissues were harvested from the plants and immediately used for protoplast isolation as described previously . cdna was pcr amplified from a cdna library using the primers act and act . and also were generated by pcr using the specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to tag the wild type and mutant _METHOD_ of with ha at the c terminus the pcr products were digested with sali and and ligated into a puc based ha tagging vector digested with sali and . the puc based ha tagging vector consists of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus a multicloning site the ha epitope and the nos terminator . to construct _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified from a cdna library using the primers cacaaagagtaaagaagaacaatgagtgacgcgtttgatg and ggatcccttggtgagtttgaagtacaa . the nucleotide sequence was confirmed and ligated into the ha tagging vector . _METHOD_ talin was constructed exactly as described previously . to construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged with ha _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified from an arabidopsis cdna library using two specific primers tcgagagaagagacgatg and gaccaagacaacgatgat . the pcr product was confirmed and ligated to the ha tagging vector . protoplasts were treated with varying concentrations of lat b for h and then lysed gently in a buffer by repeated freeze and thaw cycles . the lysates were then fractionated into soluble and pellet fractions by centrifugation at at for min . the pellet fractions were resuspended to the original volume of the lysis buffer . these soluble and pellet fractions were analyzed by protein gel blot using anti actin and anti bip antibodies . to prepare cell extracts from protoplasts transformed protoplasts were subjected to repeated freeze and thaw cycles in lysis buffer and then centrifuged at at for min in a microfuge . to obtain the proteins in the culture medium cold tca was added to the medium and protein aggregates were precipitated by centrifugation at at for min . the protein aggregates were dissolved in the lysis buffer in a volume that corresponds to the volume used to prepare total protoplast proteins . protein gel blot analysis was performed using anti _METHOD_ and anti ha antibodies as described previously . to determine the turnover rate of endogenous aleurain protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide a protein translation inhibitor . protein extracts were prepared from the protoplasts at various time points and analyzed by protein gel blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ and anti aleurain antibodies . the turnover rate of endogenous aleurain was determined by measuring the amount of endogenous aleurain detected by the anti aleurain antibody in the presence of cyclohexamide . the inhibition of translation by cycloheximide was confirmed by measuring the amount of newly synthesized _METHOD_ . the central _LOCATION_ was purified according to the method described by citation . briefly the transformed protoplasts were loaded onto a ficoll step gradient consisting of and ficoll and subjected to ultracentrifugation at for h. the top and pellet fractions which contain the intact _LOCATION_ and nonvacuolar endomembrane compartments respectively were collected separately from the gradient . in addition protoplasts were fractionated using a much finer step gradient consisting of and ficoll . fractions were separately collected from these steps and proteins from these fractions were concentrated by tca precipitation and analyzed by protein gel blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ anti vsr and anti aleurain antibodies . plasmids were introduced by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation of arabidopsis protoplasts that had been prepared from leaf tissues . to observe the effects of various chemicals on trafficking they were added to the incubation medium immediately after transformation except when indicated otherwise . the _PROTEIN_ of the fusion constructs was monitored at various time points after transformation and images were captured with a cooled ccd camera and a zeiss axioplan _METHOD_ microscope . the filter sets used were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ respectively . the data were then processed using adobe photoshop software and the images were rendered in pseudocolor . the images of transformed protoplasts were randomly selected and captured on a cooled ccd camera equipped with a _METHOD_ microscope . the images stored in the computer were _PROTEIN_ displayed on the computer screen and scored on the basis of the _METHOD_ patterns generated by the reporter proteins in the transformed protoplasts . spo _METHOD_ gave two patterns a network pattern _LOCATION_ and a _LOCATION_ pattern in the absence of inhibitor . however in the presence of lat b or overexpressed actin mutants spo _METHOD_ gave three additional patterns a punctate staining pattern _LOCATION_ alone an _LOCATION_ plus _LOCATION_ pattern and a _LOCATION_ plus _LOCATION_ pattern . when trafficking efficiency of spo _METHOD_ to the central _LOCATION_ was estimated in the presence of lat b or overexpressed mutants both the _LOCATION_ plus _LOCATION_ pattern and the _LOCATION_ plus _LOCATION_ pattern which were a minor portion of transformed protoplasts were included with the _LOCATION_ pattern . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced the _LOCATION_ pattern alone the _LOCATION_ plus _LOCATION_ patterns and the _LOCATION_ pattern alone in the presence of lat b or overexpressed actin mutants . again the _LOCATION_ plus _LOCATION_ pattern was included with the _LOCATION_ pattern when the staining patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were scored . for immunohistochemistry transformed protoplasts were placed onto poly l lys coated glass slides and fixed with paraformaldehyde in a fixing buffer for h at room temperature . the fixed cells were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies such as rat monoclonal anti ha or rabbit anti vsr antibodies in _PROTEIN_ buffer _PROTEIN_ at overnight and then washed with _PROTEIN_ buffer three times . subsequently the cells were incubated with conjugated goat anti rabbit igg or conjugated anti rat igg secondary antibodies in _PROTEIN_ buffer and then washed three times with _PROTEIN_ buffer . the images were captured using a ccd camera and a zeiss axioplan _METHOD_ microscope as described above .
