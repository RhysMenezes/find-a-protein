morphological plasticity of root _METHOD_ is critically important for plant survival because it allows plants to optimize their capacity to take up water and nutrients from the soil environment . here we show that a signaling module composed of nitrogen responsive cle _PROTEIN_ peptides and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase is _PROTEIN_ in the root vasculature in arabidopsis thaliana and plays a crucial role in regulating the expansion of the root system under n deficient conditions . _PROTEIN_ and were induced by n deficiency in roots predominantly _PROTEIN_ in root pericycle cells and their overexpression repressed the growth of _PROTEIN_ root primordia and their emergence from the primary root . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mutants showed progressive outgrowth of _PROTEIN_ root primordia into _PROTEIN_ roots under n deficient conditions . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was reverted by introducing a _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in phloem companion cells of roots . the overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggested the amplitude of the cle peptide signals being feedback regulated by _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed under its own promoter in wild type plants the length of _PROTEIN_ roots was negatively correlated with increasing _PROTEIN_ mrna levels however this inhibitory action of _PROTEIN_ was abrogated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . our findings identify the n responsive cle _PROTEIN_ signaling module as an essential mechanism restrictively controlling the expansion of the _PROTEIN_ root system in n deficient environments .
to investigate the n responses of cle peptides and their involvement in root development we conducted a gene _PROTEIN_ survey of cle gene family members in arabidopsis transcriptome data . datasets of n starved roots n starved and n supplied young seedlings and n resupplied roots were analyzed . in this initial survey _PROTEIN_ was found to be induced by n deprivation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also found to show positive responses to resupply of n . based on these observations we conducted real time pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ and in roots of d old wild type arabidopsis seedlings grown with various supplies . a detailed analysis of _PROTEIN_ was not conducted because _PROTEIN_ mrna was not detectable in roots under our experimental conditions . in this experiment we found a significantly higher accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and transcripts under n deficient conditions . to investigate the roles of n deficiency responsive cle peptides and their homologs in root development _PROTEIN_ and were constitutively overexpressed under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter which led to high _PROTEIN_ levels of cle genes in these transgenic lines . in agreement with a previous study the overexpressors for _PROTEIN_ and showed a delay in flowering . a subsequent analysis of root phenotypes showed that primary root growth was not affected but total _PROTEIN_ root length was significantly shorter in any of the cle overexpressors than in the wild type . the effect of cle transgenes on _PROTEIN_ root growth inhibition was more significant under conditions of moderate to high nitrate supply where endogenous cles were repressed . we further conducted microscopic analysis to determine the number of _PROTEIN_ root primordia and emerged _PROTEIN_ roots . for this purpose the total number of _PROTEIN_ root initiation events was counted and _PROTEIN_ root primordia and emerged _PROTEIN_ roots were classified according to the developmental stages i iv v vii and viii . although the total _PROTEIN_ root density _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not different between the overexpressors and the wild type the density of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots at stage viii was dramatically _PROTEIN_ by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and . this finding was also evident from a _PROTEIN_ frequency of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots and a proportionally increased frequency of unemerged _PROTEIN_ root primordia at stages i iv in the overexpressors relative to the wild type . these results indicated that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and can repress the outgrowth of _PROTEIN_ root primordia and their emergence from the primary root but do not affect _PROTEIN_ root initiation . in promoter _METHOD_ lines _PROTEIN_ and promoter activities were predominantly localized in pericycle cells of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots similar to the results shown by promoter gus analyses . in _PROTEIN_ and promoter _METHOD_ lines _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of the primary root tip . these partly overlapping spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns suggested a functional redundancy among _PROTEIN_ and consistent with our finding that overexpression of any of the corresponding genes is sufficient to inhibit _PROTEIN_ root development . the peptide sequences of the n responsive cle homologs _PROTEIN_ to are highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ which binds to the receptor _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the signaling pathways associated with _PROTEIN_ to in roots the knockout mutants of type xi lrr _PROTEIN_ including phylogenetically close members of _PROTEIN_ were collected and their root phenotypes were examined under low n conditions . among these mutants only _PROTEIN_ showed a significant extension of _PROTEIN_ roots which was opposite to the short _PROTEIN_ root phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ to overexpressors . we further investigated the root developmental traits of arabidopsis seedlings under various n conditions using the _PROTEIN_ mutant obtained from the ds transposon inserted line collection and ler as the wild type . the wild type seedlings showed a significant _PROTEIN_ in total or average _PROTEIN_ root length under severe n deficiency . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ was grown under the same condition total and average lengths of _PROTEIN_ roots were significantly longer than those in the wild type . the primary roots of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ showed similar lengths and trends to _PROTEIN_ under n deficiency . from these results _PROTEIN_ was suggested to mediate the n responsive cle peptide signaling pathways controlling _PROTEIN_ root development under n deficient conditions . a repressive action of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ root development was further supported by the analysis of root traits in allelic mutants of _PROTEIN_ and in transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene in the _PROTEIN_ background . on low n medium five allelic mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited significantly elongated _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ reverted these root phenotypes . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was capable of restoring the root phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ root length was significantly altered primary root length was not consistently affected in _PROTEIN_ mutants or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . microscopic analysis indicated that the density of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants relative to wild type plants . this result was _PROTEIN_ by an increased frequency of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots and a proportional _PROTEIN_ in unemerged _PROTEIN_ root primordia at stages i iv . subsequent analysis of two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with their background line _PROTEIN_ showed that the density of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots was substantially _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this result was also shown by a _PROTEIN_ frequency of these emerged _PROTEIN_ roots and an increased frequency of unemerged _PROTEIN_ root primordia at stages i iv in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines relative to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . total _PROTEIN_ root densities were slightly increased in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines however these changes were mostly projected on the number of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots indicating the effect on stage progression . taken together this set of experiments indicated a repressive role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating the growth of _PROTEIN_ root primordia and their emergence from the primary root . confocal microscopy revealed localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the phloem companion cells of both primary and _PROTEIN_ roots indicating their spatial separation from pericycle cells where _PROTEIN_ and promoter activities were predominantly localized . in shoots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in the shoot apical meristem and restored the silique defective phenotype of _PROTEIN_ indicating its ability to fulfill a similar function as the _PROTEIN_ double _METHOD_ fusion protein . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to were localized in different cell types in roots although they both conferred an inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root development under n deficient conditions . to further investigate their relationship in roots we analyzed _PROTEIN_ to transcript levels in wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots and observed a significant overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels accumulated to a lower extent in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggested feedback regulation of _PROTEIN_ and by _PROTEIN_ in wild type roots as observed for _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apical meristem . based on results obtained from analysis of cle overexpressors and _PROTEIN_ mutants we hypothesized that overexpression of n responsive induction of cles in roots should cause inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root development in wild type but not in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants if the cle _PROTEIN_ signaling module is functional in roots . to test this hypothesis transgenic lines were prepared to overexpress _PROTEIN_ under control of its native promoter in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant background . _PROTEIN_ was chosen for this experiment because it was among the most up regulated cle genes under n deficiency . to enhance transcriptional/translational efficiency yet conserving the original _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in roots we inserted a cauliflower mosaic virus gene minimal promoter and a tobacco mosaic virus derived sequence between the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and the coding region . the resulting _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion construct was introduced into wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and root phenotypes were analyzed . in _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ lines a strong promoter activity was found in the central cylinder of roots and in primary and _PROTEIN_ root tips . unlike transgenic lines that constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ lines in wild type background did not show any phenotypic defects in shoots and the shoot apical meristem . _PROTEIN_ lines were then subjected to a quantitative assessment of _PROTEIN_ root phenotypes . root lengths and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were examined in individual seedlings from the generation by collecting individuals from seven independent transgenic lines each from the ler or _PROTEIN_ background . root lengths of individual seedlings were normalized by values of their backgrounds _PROTEIN_ to compare the relative effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression in these two different populations . these normalized root length values were then plotted against _PROTEIN_ mrna levels . the slope of the regression line indicates the quantitative extent of root growth inhibition caused by increasing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . the results indicated that primary root length was not altered by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in either background . in contrast total _PROTEIN_ root length was substantially _PROTEIN_ with increasing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in ler but only slightly in _PROTEIN_ . as revealed by the top three lines showing the highest _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in either background root specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ inhibited _PROTEIN_ root development in wild type but not in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the slope of the regression line was for the ler but only for the _PROTEIN_ background demonstrating that an almost fourfold greater reduction of total _PROTEIN_ root length occurred in wild type relative to _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the significant difference in _PROTEIN_ dependent inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root development between ler and _PROTEIN_ was supported by an analysis of covariance .
for root phenotypic analysis arabidopsis plants were grown vertically on nutrient media containing agar and sucrose under a diurnal cycle of h light and h dark at . to modify concentrations in the medium ca or _PROTEIN_ were replaced with or kcl respectively . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are ler background mutants reported previously . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was obtained from the ds transposon inserted line collection . the lrr _PROTEIN_ type xi knockout mutants are in col background . transgenic arabidopsis plants were constructed as described in si materials and methods . plants grown on vertical plates were scanned and the images of roots were traced using photoshop _METHOD_ . root lengths were measured from traced images using winrhizo . for the determination of _PROTEIN_ root numbers plants were grown on agar medium for d and roots were cleared with hydroxylamine hydrochloride . _PROTEIN_ root number was counted under a microscope and _PROTEIN_ root initials and emerged _PROTEIN_ roots were classified to stages i iv v vii and viii for separate calculation of their densities _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the primary root length was measured from the scanned images using winrhizo as described above . total rna was extracted from roots using rneasy plant mini kit . first strand cdna was synthesized from ng of total rna using omniscript reverse transcriptase and oligo d primer and was used for quantitative real time pcr . real time rt pcr was performed by using sybr premix ex taq ii and fast real time pcr system _METHOD_ . relative transcript levels were calculated by comparative cycle threshold method . ubiquitin was used as an internal control . the primer sequences for real time pcr are listed in table . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was analyzed with the laser scanning confocal microscopy system fluoview . roots of _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and plants were counter stained with propidium iodide .
