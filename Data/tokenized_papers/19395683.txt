the specification of cell fates during development requires precise regulatory _METHOD_ to ensure robust cell type patterns . theoretical models of pattern formation suggest that a combination of negative and positive feedback _METHOD_ are necessary for efficient specification of distinct fates in a field of differentiating cells . here we examine the role of the myb transcription _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the establishment of the root epidermal cell type pattern in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ is closely related to and is positively regulated by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myb gene during root epidermis development . furthermore _PROTEIN_ is able to substitute for the function of _PROTEIN_ and to induce its own _PROTEIN_ when controlled by _PROTEIN_ regulatory sequences . we also show that the _PROTEIN_ protein binds to its own promoter suggesting a _PROTEIN_ positive feedback loop . the localization of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein as well as the effect of a chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ repressor construct links _PROTEIN_ function to the developing non hair cell type . using mutational analyses we find that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for precise establishment of the root epidermal pattern particularly under conditions that compromise the cell specification process . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ participates in a positive feedback loop to reinforce cell fate decisions and ensure robust establishment of the cell type pattern in the arabidopsis root epidermis .
to begin to understand the role of _PROTEIN_ in root epidermis development we examined its _PROTEIN_ by performing rna in situ hybridization and reporter gene fusion experiments . the in situ rna hybridization was performed using a digoxigenin labeled _PROTEIN_ gene specific antisense probe applied to transverse sections from the developing root . we detected the strongest signal in the n position cells in the root epidermis . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ rna preferentially accumulates in the differentiating non hair cells a pattern similar to that seen for the transcript accumulation of epidermal patterning genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to define the spatial pattern of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity plants harboring a _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter transgene were examined . this line was previously reported to exhibit gus _PROTEIN_ in the cell division and differentiation zones of the root but it was not analyzed in detail . we discovered that gus is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the n position cells in the developing root epidermis resulting in a non hair cell file pattern . this _PROTEIN_ profile which displays maximal gus activity in epidermal cells in the _PROTEIN_ meristematic zone is most similar to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this pattern is distinct from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern because it initiates slightly _PROTEIN_ in development than _PROTEIN_ it is limited to the epidermis and it is not detectable in the h cell position . together these results show that the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity and _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation patterns are similar and occur preferentially in cells destined to adopt the non hair cell fate in the root epidermis . the _PROTEIN_ myb protein is known to be a positive regulator of several genes _PROTEIN_ in the developing non hair cells including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ also influences _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ we examined _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation and gus activity in roots of the wer mutant . quantitative real time pcr analysis showed that the steady state level of _PROTEIN_ rna in the wer mutant root is reduced to of the wild type root level . _PROTEIN_ of the gus transgene was nearly undetectable in the wer mutant roots . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ induces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the developing root epidermis . to examine _PROTEIN_ regulation more broadly we analyzed _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation and gus _PROTEIN_ in various mutants defective in root epidermal cell specification . we discovered that like wer the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots accumulate a significantly lower level of _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots display a reduced amount of gus _PROTEIN_ although the n cell _PROTEIN_ pattern was retained . by contrast the cpc mutant exhibited an increased level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . this higher level of _PROTEIN_ rna _METHOD_ to be due to _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in some of the h position epidermal cells of cpc . to further assess the involvement of _PROTEIN_ a line overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed for its effect on gus and it was found to lack _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . in the roots of the mutant the _PROTEIN_ transcript level and gus _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable from those in the wild type root . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ gene is positively regulated by the non hair cell promoting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex negatively regulated by the hair cell promoting _PROTEIN_ protein and unaffected by the downstream _PROTEIN_ homeodomain protein . recently we and others have shown that the _PROTEIN_ protein directly regulates _PROTEIN_ transcription through its binding to three sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter designated wbsi wbsii/cpcmbsi and _PROTEIN_ . the core sequence of wbsi is _PROTEIN_ and the core sequence of wbsii/cpcmbsi and _PROTEIN_ is caac . to explore the possibility that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ by binding directly to its promoter we searched for wbsi like or wbsii like sequences in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . a total of nine wbsi ls and seven wbsii ls were identified within the kb flanking region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and these were tested for _PROTEIN_ binding in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . using dna fragments generated from each of these sites we detected binding of the _PROTEIN_ protein to four sites . these are designated wbsi wbsi/ii wbsii and wbsii and are located and bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ translation start site respectively . _METHOD_ competition experiments were conducted to assess the importance of the core sequences for _PROTEIN_ binding to these fragments . for the wbsi _PROTEIN_ binding was not greatly reduced in the presence of competitor dna fragments with a mutated core sequence as compared with the effect of wild type competitor fragments which indicates sequence specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to this site . for wbsii the mutated fragment was able to compete with the probe dna but much less efficiently than the wild type competitor perhaps indicating that flanking sequences may also function in efficient binding of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the wbsi/ii site contains the core sequence of wbsi _PROTEIN_ and the core sequence of wbsii juxtaposed to each other . thus we tested two mutated versions of this site and found that did not compete with the wild type fragment while could compete with the wild type fragment . this suggests that only the wbsii like sequence in this region is important for _PROTEIN_ binding . the wbsii site contains three closely linked caac core sequences . to define the core sequence important for _PROTEIN_ binding we mutated each of these and used them in _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ binding to the wild type wbsii site was not affected by the and fragments but the fragment significantly reduced the _PROTEIN_ wbsii binding indicating that the second and third core sequences are required for effective _PROTEIN_ protein binding to this site while the first core sequence is less important . to further validate these _PROTEIN_ binding sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter we made stable transgenic lines containing the gus reporter gene fused to the wild type version or mutated versions of the kb long _PROTEIN_ promoter . while the wild type version showed strong gus activity in the n position epidermal cells the reporter gene mutated at the wbsi site showed very low activity . the reporter genes mutated at the other three sites individually by contrast did not show a significant difference in their gus activities compared with the wild type version . however when all four mutations were combined the reporter gene activity was lower than the activity of the gus . these results show that the wbsi plays an important role in the proper _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and that wbsi/ii wbsii and wbsii exert a minor combined role . as a predicted transcription _PROTEIN_ protein produced from n cell specific transcripts _PROTEIN_ may be expected to localize and act within the _LOCATION_ of cells in the n position of the root epidermis . on the other hand some transcription _PROTEIN_ participating in root epidermal cell specification _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are able to move from cell to cell . to define the location of the _PROTEIN_ protein we generated and analyzed a transgenic line bearing an in frame _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reporter translational fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this transgene was _PROTEIN_ under the control of _PROTEIN_ regulatory sequences previously determined to be sufficient in genomic complementation experiments to rescue the trichome branching defect in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we found that this translational fusion was able to rescue the branching defect in the _PROTEIN_ mutant trichomes indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein functions like the native _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants showed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present in the _LOCATION_ of the developing root epidermal cells located in the n position . as a negative control we generated a _METHOD_ transcriptional fusion driven by the same regulatory sequences that were used for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construction _METHOD_ which exhibited _METHOD_ generally distributed throughout the cells . this overall distribution _METHOD_ to be caused by the nonspecific diffusion of the _METHOD_ which is _PROTEIN_ in the n position cells based on the _PROTEIN_ that the _METHOD_ signal from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ driven by the same regulatory sequences is found only in the n position cells . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates in the _LOCATION_ of the developing non hair cells and does not move from cell to cell . the _PROTEIN_ protein is structurally similar to _PROTEIN_ exhibiting amino acid sequence identity overall as well as identity in their n terminal myb domains and identity in their c terminal transcriptional activation domains . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein is functionally similar to _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cell specification we tested the ability of the _PROTEIN_ coding region driven by the _PROTEIN_ regulatory sequences to complement the wer mutant . based on our prior study of _PROTEIN_ regulation we knew that a kb fragment to the start codon and a kb fragment to the stop codon together represented the cis regulatory sequences sufficient to direct normal _PROTEIN_ gene function . these same and _PROTEIN_ regulatory sequences were fused to the _PROTEIN_ coding sequences to generate the pwer _PROTEIN_ construct . when this construct was introduced into a wer mutant background the resulting pwer _PROTEIN_ wer plants showed normal position dependent cell type patterning in the root epidermis in contrast with the excessive hair cell specification in the wer mutant . specification of cell types in the root epidermis to further define the molecular basis of this complementation we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter gene in these lines . _PROTEIN_ is well known to be required for the position dependent _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ so that gus activity was hardly detected in the wer mutant roots harboring _PROTEIN_ gus . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ gus was completely restored in the pwer _PROTEIN_ wer line as well as in the pwer _PROTEIN_ wer line which is consistent with the normal cell type patterning in these two lines . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is biochemically similar to _PROTEIN_ for regulating cell fate in the root epidermis . the ability of the _PROTEIN_ protein to substitute for the _PROTEIN_ protein in root epidermal cell specification implies that _PROTEIN_ is able to regulate the same set of genes as _PROTEIN_ regulates such as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . to examine this in a different manner we converted the _PROTEIN_ protein into a transcriptional repressor by fusing the modified repressor domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in frame to the end of the _PROTEIN_ coding region . this _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was placed under the control of the _PROTEIN_ regulatory sequences as defined above to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct . plants harboring this construct exhibited excessive root hair cell specification due to root hair cells produced in the n position . this result is consistent with the previously reported effect of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct which causes essentially all root epidermal cells to adopt the hair cell fate and also affects root elongation . to determine whether this phenotypic effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is caused by a change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we analyzed _PROTEIN_ promoter activity by incorporating the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter into this line . we found a significant reduction in the level of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots as compared with the wild type . to further determine the effect of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on specific gene _PROTEIN_ in root epidermis development we examined _PROTEIN_ of the transcriptional reporters pwer _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gus pcpc gus and gus in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line as compared with the wild type . although pwer _METHOD_ reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was not altered in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line the _PROTEIN_ gus pcpc gus and gus lines exhibited a _PROTEIN_ in reporter _PROTEIN_ in the developing non hair cells even though the basic _PROTEIN_ patterns were not changed . together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active early enough to be involved in cell fate specification in the arabidopsis root epidermis even though its _PROTEIN_ starts somewhat _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ normally participates in the regulation of its own gene _PROTEIN_ as well as the regulation of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . our results here show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is promoted by _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ is able to function in a similar manner as _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cell specification which implies that _PROTEIN_ participates in a positive feedback loop in the root epidermis regulatory network . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ might also participate in a positive feedback loop whereby it promotes the transcription of its own gene we analyzed _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation and pwer _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the wer mutant background . real time pcr analysis showed that the steady state level of _METHOD_ transcripts in the wer mutant root tip was not significantly different from that in the wild type . also the pwer _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in the root tip was not altered in the wer mutant . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate its own gene _PROTEIN_ . to test the biological significance of _PROTEIN_ and its positive feedback loop in root epidermis development we analyzed two _PROTEIN_ mutant lines from the salk t dna insertion collection _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ allele has a t dna insertion in its second intron and has been previously reported to have no detectable _PROTEIN_ transcripts . the _PROTEIN_ allele has an insertion in its promoter region bp upstream to the start codon and we found that it has reduced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ rna in its roots . these _PROTEIN_ mutant lines appear to have a normal root hair density but a quantitative analysis shows that both of the mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a small but statistically significant increase in hair cell production in the n position . to analyze _PROTEIN_ further we introduced the _PROTEIN_ gus pwer _METHOD_ gus and pcpc gus transcriptional reporters into the _PROTEIN_ mutant by genetic crosses . we did not observe any significant difference in the pattern of _PROTEIN_ for any of these transcriptional reporters in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as compared with the wild type . furthermore the steady state rna levels of the known transcriptional regulators were not significantly changed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant roots except for a slight reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcripts . lastly we tested the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant using the gus reporter and discovered no difference from the wild type pattern . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ gene function plays a minor role in the normal establishment of the cell pattern and gene regulatory activities in the developing root epidermis . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant has relatively minor defects we next considered the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and its positive feedback loop might help reinforce the existing cell fate determination _METHOD_ so that a greater effect of _PROTEIN_ might be observed under conditions where the cell specification process is compromised . we tested this possibility in two ways . first we examined cell specification in epidermal clones in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type . epidermal clones result from rare longitudinal divisions usually in the h position cells that effectively cause one of the epidermal daughter cells to change their position relative to the underlying cortical cells at a relatively _PROTEIN_ stage in epidermis development . in the wild type the cells in the epidermal clones are able to accurately respecify their fates in a normal position dependent manner . however we discovered that epidermal clones in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are less able to respecify their fates properly because approximately five times more _PROTEIN_ clones possess misspecified cells than do wild type clones . these misspecified cells from _PROTEIN_ clones preferentially occur in the n cell files implying that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is less able to direct the non hair fate in cells that have switched their position from the h to the n cell position . unlike fate specification in the early stage which involves a gradual establishment of epidermal cell pattern through several cell divisions fate specification in these epidermal clones requires rapid establishment of the cell fate . this could explain why the positive feedback regulation via _PROTEIN_ is more important in these epidermal clones . cell patterning within epidermal clones from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ as a second method to impose suboptimal cell specification conditions we analyzed homozygous double mutant combinations that included _PROTEIN_ and a second mutation in one of the cell specification genes . we found that the wer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a similar root epidermis phenotype as each mutant in the absence of the _PROTEIN_ mutation which was expected given these strong single mutant phenotypes and the presumed role of _PROTEIN_ in the same pathway . however the root epidermis phenotype of the cpc _PROTEIN_ double mutant was intermediate between the cpc single mutant and the wild type pattern showing that the _PROTEIN_ defect partially rescued the cpc mutant . specifically in the cpc _PROTEIN_ double mutant of its h position cells adopted the hair cell fate while only of the h position cells adopted the hair cell fate in the cpc mutant . to test whether this change is associated with a change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we analyzed _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in the cpc _PROTEIN_ line . the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ can be detected in the h position cells _PROTEIN_ as well as in the n position cells in the cpc mutant root but in the cpc _PROTEIN_ double mutant many of the h position cells do not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus . this implies that _PROTEIN_ is required for non hair cell specification in the h cell position of the cpc mutant root . to further clarify the _PROTEIN_ positive feedback loop in cell fate specification we examined the effect of overexpression of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . since _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is much greater than cauliflower mosaic virus promoter activity in the root we used the pwer _PROTEIN_ construct and introduced it into the wer _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ line . as mentioned above the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is undetectable in the wer mutant root . however when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the wer mutant root epidermis by the _PROTEIN_ promoter the _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ was much higher indicating that the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is positively regulated by the _PROTEIN_ protein . next we directly tested whether the _PROTEIN_ protein is able to bind to its own promoter . for this purpose the _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ and purified from escherichia coli and used in _METHOD_ experiments . these competition experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ specifically binds to all four of the _PROTEIN_ binding sites in the same manner as _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results show that _PROTEIN_ is able to induce its own _PROTEIN_ by directly binding to its promoter .
