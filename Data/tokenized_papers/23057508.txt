to identify the fsd genes responsible for detectable fesod activity we analysed the sod activity profile in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . fesod activity was absent in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but present in _PROTEIN_ . subsequent immunoblotting revealed _PROTEIN_ protein at the position of the fesod activity band . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activities were undetectable and _PROTEIN_ conferred the only detectable fesod activity . the _PROTEIN_ plant growth was arrested after germination . therefore we used _PROTEIN_ in further analyses . although _PROTEIN_ has been reported to be located in different cellular compartments of chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ we showed its localization in chloroplasts using a _METHOD_ fusion product . when the residues at the of _PROTEIN_ were deleted based on a sequence alignment from different species the resulting was present in cytoplasm and was still active . through the analysis of the activation of _PROTEIN_ proteins in vitro we screened the _PROTEIN_ involved in fesod activation . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were active whereas the apo form of _PROTEIN_ was inactive because of the absence of the cofactor fe . on treatment with fe without _PROTEIN_ cellular extract activity increased by with the cellular extract without fe the activity was enhanced by . with both cellular extract and fe present the activity was enhanced . activation showed a similar profile however activity was recovered with only fe and the cellular extract combined . was unable to use fe for activation at concentrations of up to mm . activity was increased by with mm fe but the activity was not proportional to the increase in fe concentration . therefore the activity enhancement may reach the limit for _PROTEIN_ activation through spontaneous unaided acquisition of the cofactor fe . moreover desalting of the cellular extract before the activation assay had no effect on the ability to enhance _PROTEIN_ activity which ruled out the effects of ions in the extract . the total fe in arabidopsis leaf is about dry weight . however the labile fe pool of embryonic axes of sorghum is c. nmol fresh weight which is equivalent to a concentration much lower than that of the fe supplied on a millimolar scale in our in vitro experiments . therefore the efficiency of fe incorporation by _PROTEIN_ itself may be negligible in vivo . hence we suggest the requirement for a _PROTEIN_ assisting _PROTEIN_ activation . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cellular extracts from supernatant heated at for min to remove most of the cellular proteins still retained the ability to recover and enhance the activity of and . hence to identify the _PROTEIN_ assisting _PROTEIN_ activation we used the heated supernatant with hplc gel filtration chromatography and _METHOD_ analyses . fractions eluted at min of hplc could restore activity but the ability was lost when the fractions were treated with proteinase k this suggests that the assisting _PROTEIN_ is heat stable and proteinaceous . these fractions were combined and subjected to gel filtration chromatography . fractions eluting at min of gel filtration retain the ability to assist in _PROTEIN_ activation . we then subjected the hplc fractions at min and the gel filtration fractions at min to _METHOD_ analysis . the _METHOD_ data revealed proteins which are consistently present in these fractions . we found four chloroplast proteins two photosynthetic complex subunits one chloroplast ribosomal protein and _PROTEIN_ we then focused on _PROTEIN_ for further analysis because of its heat stability and consistently high score on _METHOD_ data . _PROTEIN_ is a and assists chaperonin in protein folding . an additional role for _PROTEIN_ unrelated to its function has not been reported . the use of _METHOD_ fusion proteins and immunogold labelling has shown that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized to chloroplasts . to investigate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we performed yeast assay with _PROTEIN_ fused to the dna bd and _PROTEIN_ fused to the ad of . _PROTEIN_ showed specific interaction with _PROTEIN_ and none of the protein interacted with _PROTEIN_ a control for cytoplasmic cuznsod . in addition we performed fret assay to confirm the interaction of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts . we also constructed a control for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the fret result revealed an interaction between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ which indicates a specific interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts . to determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ activity we measured the activity of incubated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . activity was increased significantly by incubation with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ and but not _PROTEIN_ without fe . the enhanced activity reached and on incubation with _PROTEIN_ and respectively . tris grinding buffer various ph buffers and ions commonly found in cells did not enhance significantly _PROTEIN_ activity in this system which rules out the artifactual effects in these buffer components . the activity was also enhanced by incubation with suggesting that and share a similar trend in the activity assay in vitro . we also tested the cellular extract prepared from _METHOD_ protoplasts and found that it induced significantly activity . when the extract was heated to for min _METHOD_ protein was no longer present in the supernatant possibly because of the _METHOD_ tag and the _PROTEIN_ enhancement effect was lost . of note the endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the supernatant remained soluble after heating with a slight _PROTEIN_ in level . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ lines generated under the control of the promoter _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels were both increased and the _PROTEIN_ protein and activity levels were enhanced by and respectively . however the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels did not increase accordingly . of note the increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not affect protein levels as determined by the use of a antibody that with all the chloroplast subtypes . screening for a _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant in arabidopsis failed . interference with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been successful only with the use of vigs in tobacco and tomato . the silencing of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a phenotype and poorly developed mesophylls with a reduced number of chloroplasts which suggests a role for _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast development . moreover specific silencing of _PROTEIN_ in tomato fruit resulted in seedless tomatoes . _PROTEIN_ may play a role in seed abortion which might explain the failure to obtain a stable knockout mutant in arabidopsis . to confirm the function of _PROTEIN_ in fesod activation tomato _PROTEIN_ silencing by vigs was conducted . both _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels were reduced in vigs plants and fesod activity was also _PROTEIN_ accordingly . therefore the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was accompanied by reduced fesod activity in vivo . the vigs plants also showed similar results with a phenotype . _PROTEIN_ may have similar effects on the activation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however the _PROTEIN_ lines were not suitable for the evaluation of this possibility because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activities were still undetectable in these plants . we used the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as shown in fig . . the activities of _PROTEIN_ and on incubation with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were analysed and were found to be increased significantly with _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . thus the activating role of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was similar to that for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ consists of two homologous _PROTEIN_ domains joined by a short chain of amino acids . each domain contains a mobile loop known to be important for binding to chaperonins . the ivl motif within the mobile loop is primarily responsible for the binding affinity whereas the preceding amino acids of gg allow for the formation of the hairpin structure that is adopted on binding to chaperonins . the role of the mobile loops of _PROTEIN_ binding to chaperonins was tested previously with proteins mutated in one of the highly conserved leu residues in the ivl motif _PROTEIN_ or at the conserved gly position _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among these mutations _PROTEIN_ and gdm completely lost their activity . we used the same _PROTEIN_ and its mutants provided by one of the authors in _PROTEIN_ activation analysis in vitro . although all of the mutants exhibited diminished assisting ability when compared with _PROTEIN_ the mutants completely lacking activity _PROTEIN_ could still enhance significantly _PROTEIN_ activity . to determine whether the mobile loop was involved in _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo we _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ or its mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in arabidopsis protoplasts the _METHOD_ activity and protein levels with _PROTEIN_ mutants were increased to a similar extent as _PROTEIN_ . such enhancement was not observed on of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ a control for cuznsod . thus _PROTEIN_ had a specific effect on _PROTEIN_ activity independent of its activity .
