the arabidopsis acyl coenzyme a desaturase like gene family contains nine genes encoding fatty acid desaturase like proteins . the biological function of only one member of the family fatty acid _PROTEIN_ is known and this gene encodes the _LOCATION_ palmitoyl monogalactosyldiacylglycerol desaturase . we cloned seven members of the gene family that are predicted not to have a chloroplast transit peptide and _PROTEIN_ them in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae . all seven have previously undescribed desaturase activity on very long chain fatty acid substrates and exhibit diverse regiospecificity catalyzing introduction of double bonds relative to the methyl end of the molecule at n _PROTEIN_ n _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ n _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ positions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . through forward and reverse genetics it was shown that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the synthesis of the and components of seed lipids sphingolipids and the _LOCATION_ phospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine . plants deficient in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed no obvious phenotype when grown under normal growing conditions but showed an almost complete loss of phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine dihydroxy monohexosylceramide trihydroxy monohexosylceramide and trihydroxy glycosylinositolphosphoceramide lipid species that contain the vlcfa and trihydroxy glycosylinositolphosphoceramide a lipid containing . acyl coa profiling of these plants revealed a major reduction in coa and a small reduction in coa . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a substantial increase in the percentage of glycerolipid and sphingolipids species containing and a dramatic increase in the percentage of very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids in the acyl coa pool . plants deficient in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had reduced levels of in seed lipids but no significant changes in leaf phospholipids or sphingolipids were observed . these findings indicate that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ monounsaturated vlcfas of arabidopsis result primarily from vlcfa desaturation rather than by elongation of long chain monounsaturated fatty acids .
comparison of deduced amino acid sequences showed that all of the arabidopsis ads proteins contained the putative fad like conserved domain featuring the his box motifs characteristic of fatty acid desaturases . phylogenetic analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were the most highly conserved members of the ads family with amino acid identity followed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with identity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shared identity . all ads proteins are designated as multipass _LOCATION_ proteins located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a search for potential hydrophobic _LOCATION_ spanning regions using on line analysis tools including tmhmm and predictprotein gave a consensus of four major transmembrane helices in each protein with both n and c termini located in the _LOCATION_ . none of the seven proteins contained a putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide and a search for _LOCATION_ localization signals using signalp version did not reveal any obvious signal peptides . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appeared to contain a putative di arg _LOCATION_ retention/retrieval motif close to the c terminus . in the other five ads proteins this motif was replaced with lys residues . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ as yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions in nicotiana benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration . examination of leaves by confocal microscopy revealed very low level diffuse _METHOD_ florescence when _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . fusion proteins composed of _METHOD_ fused at the c terminus colocalized with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker suggesting that these proteins are components of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system . for characterization by _PROTEIN_ in yeast the ads cdnas were each cloned into an _PROTEIN_ vector under control of a constitutive promoter . the vectors were used to transform a standard laboratory yeast strain . analysis by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters prepared from total yeast lipids revealed a small amount of a fatty acid identified by gc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to be a monounsaturated _PROTEIN_ fatty acid in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all vectors were subsequently used to transform a second yeast line that was known to accumulate vlcfas . cells transformed with each the seven different vectors all showed the accumulation of vlcfas that were not present in cells transformed with the empty vector . gc _METHOD_ conducted on the fames confirmed that the new vlcfas were monounsaturated and double bond positions were determined by gc _METHOD_ of the dimethyl disulfide fame adducts _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ produced as the predominant new fatty acid with a very low amount of also detected . cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ produced both and . these results suggested n desaturase activity for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the novel vlcmufas in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified as and suggesting that these enzymes were able to catalyze desaturation at the position . the novel vlcfas in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were and whereas those in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were and suggesting n and n desaturase activity for these enzymes respectively . desaturation at the n position was also observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that when _PROTEIN_ in yeast the ads proteins could catalyze the formation of vlcmufas . mild saponification of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that the vlcmufas were largely associated with the glycerolipid/free fatty acid fraction and were not present in significant amounts in the yeast sphingolipids . no hydroxylated _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ vlcmufas were observed and when fames were prepared from yeast by base catalyzed transesterification only very low levels of vlcfas were observed suggesting that these fatty acids were largely present as free fatty acids . to determine whether the arabidopsis ads proteins could catalyze the synthesis of vlcmufas in a plant arabidopsis plants were transformed with a vector containing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ under control of the seed specific brassica napus napin promoter . presence of the transgene cassette was verified by pcr and transformants were grown to maturity . seed fatty acid composition was determined by gc of fames prepared from total seed lipids . in wild type arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fatty acids accounted for between and of total seed fatty acids with and being present in approximately equal amounts . the _PROTEIN_ fatty acids were present at levels too low for accurate quantification . plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cdnas appeared to show on average very similar total levels of _PROTEIN_ fatty acids to the wild type . the ratios of to in lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were however dramatically changed compared with the wild type lines with becoming the predominant _PROTEIN_ fatty acid . lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed a smaller change in the ratio of _PROTEIN_ fatty acids but for most lines there was a clear increase in and a reduction in . close scrutiny of fatty acid profiles showed that in many lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ levels also appeared to be increased with a corresponding _PROTEIN_ in . fatty acids with chain length less than _PROTEIN_ were not significantly different between the lines . arabidopsis plants were also transformed with a construct containing _PROTEIN_ under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _PROTEIN_ of the transgene was verified by reverse transcription pcr . analysis of seed fatty acid profiles showed changes in and levels similar to those when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under control of the seed specific promoter . seed fatty acid composition of line used for further study is given in table ii . data are presented as percentage sd . wild type plants and oe lines were grown together but in separate pots . the ads t dna insertion lines and wild type plants were grown as mixed plants in randomized pots to reduce the effect of pot to pot variation . to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by a reverse genetics approach transfer dna insertion lines were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . homozygous plants were identified by pcr and t dna insertion positions were verified by sequencing . for _PROTEIN_ the t dna insertion position was approximately bp downstream of the start codon and was located in the second intron . the second allele _PROTEIN_ appeared to contain a concatemeric t dna insert in the fifth exon between and bp downstream of the start codon . two of the three _PROTEIN_ alleles also appeared to contain reversed concatemeric t dna insertions allowing pcr products to be generated using the primer and gene specific primers designed to bind on either side of the t dna insertion site . for _PROTEIN_ the insertion site was located at approximately bp downstream of the start codon in the fourth intron . the _PROTEIN_ allele contained an insertion toward the end of the third exon between and bp downstream of the start codon . insertion allele _PROTEIN_ contained a t dna insertion in the untranslated region approximately bp downstream of the stop codon . to determine whether the t dna insertion lines lacked ads transcript of the correct length rt pcr was conducted using cdna generated from seedling leaf total rna . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be amplified from cdna prepared from wild type material indicating that the genes were _PROTEIN_ in this tissue under normal growing conditions . using primer pairs designed to amplify the entire coding region no _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in the two _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . similarly _PROTEIN_ transcript could not be detected in plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ allele was not a knockout allele because transcript was easily detected in the homozygous plants . in rt pcr using primer pairs that preceded the t dna insertion sites a fragment could be amplified from all of the _PROTEIN_ alleles but no significant product was observed in the _PROTEIN_ alleles . to further characterize the _PROTEIN_ alleles we therefore conducted northern blot analysis using rna extracted from plants homozygous for the individual _PROTEIN_ alleles . results indicated that transcript was not present at significant levels in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles and also suggested that _PROTEIN_ transcript level in the _PROTEIN_ plants was likely higher than in wild type plants . no obvious growth phenotype was seen for the t dna insertion lines when grown under continuous light at . we observed overall size and appearance of the plants and also time to flowering and maturity . plants homozygous for each mutant allele were grown to maturity and seed fatty acid composition was determined . as shown in detail in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants had lower levels of in their seeds compared with control lines with being the predominant _PROTEIN_ fatty acid . seeds from _PROTEIN_ plants appeared to have slightly increased levels . examination of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines showed little difference in the levels or ratios of and compared with wild type lines . small differences were however observed in the _PROTEIN_ fatty acids with the mutant lines and a change in the ratio of and was evident with becoming the predominant _PROTEIN_ fatty acid . other seed fatty acids were not significantly different between the lines with the exception of in _PROTEIN_ which showed a slight increase compared with the wild type . these results further implicated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ monounsaturated fatty acids in the seed . for a comparative examination of arabidopsis leaf lipids quantitative lipidomic analysis was conducted on total lipid extracts prepared from young rosettes . data were collected from two separate sets of plants grown at different times . although in experiment lipids were extracted using a protocol not optimized for sphingolipid extraction this lipid class was detected in significant amounts and data were collected and are presented . comparison of the phospholipid molecular species in wild type and experimental lines within data from experiment revealed significant differences in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyl ser species containing _PROTEIN_ vlcfas in the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines and the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line . no significant differences between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines were observed . total pe content in wild type plants was close to of leaf phospholipids with pe molecular species totaling and pe and pe being most abundant . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants contained pe as the major species with significantly reduced levels of pe and almost no pe . compared with the wild type the _PROTEIN_ lines showed an increase in pe and pe with lower levels of pe . a dramatic increase in the more unsaturated pe species was seen in the _PROTEIN_ oe line with pe and pe becoming the dominant molecular species . this line also showed a relative increase in pe with these species accounting for of total leaf phospholipids and a slight _PROTEIN_ in pe corresponding to a reduction in pe . a similar trend was seen when ps species were examined . ps is a low abundance lipid in arabidopsis leaf accounting for only of total leaf phospholipids in wild type lines with the dominant molecular species being ps and ps . no significant increase in total ps content was seen in any of the lines examined however the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines showed significantly increased levels of ps and an almost complete loss of ps . in the _PROTEIN_ plants there was an increase in the relative amount of ps and a corresponding _PROTEIN_ in percentage of ps . the _PROTEIN_ oe line contained ps as the dominant ps species with very much reduced ps levels . ps composition of the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines resembled that of the wild type plants . data from the second experiment comparing the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ lines showed similar trends . changes in ps species that contain _PROTEIN_ fatty acid ps and ps were observed but due to the very low abundance of these lipids significance could not be demonstrated . data were also collected for the major anionic and neutral sphingolipid classes the glycosylinositolphosphoceramides _PROTEIN_ and monohexosylceramides respectively . experiment included the wild type both _PROTEIN_ alleles three _PROTEIN_ alleles and the _PROTEIN_ line whereas experiment was limited to the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . because the extraction procedure for experiment was not optimized for sphingolipid recovery we compared relative extraction of sphingolipids between the two experiments . comparison revealed that substantial recovery of sphingolipids had been achieved in experiment . hexcer for example was measured at normalized signal mg dry weight in wild type tissue in the first extraction compared with normalized signal mg dry weight in experiment and _PROTEIN_ was and normalized signal mg dry weight respectively . as data from experiment can not be considered quantitative particularly for the less easily extracted _PROTEIN_ results are _PROTEIN_ as percentages for each lipid class . results from the sphingolipid analysis revealed a dramatic difference in the composition of the and hexcers and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ alleles and in the _PROTEIN_ oe line . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ lines did not differ significantly from the wild type . for the trihydroxy and hexcer classes the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants showed a shift toward more saturated species with hexcer and hexcer being very much reduced and hexcer and hexcer showing corresponding increases . the _PROTEIN_ line had a composition similar to the wild type plants but with a slightly higher percentage of . _PROTEIN_ oe plants showed a shift toward a higher level of unsaturation with an increase in the percentage of species . compared with the trihydroxy and hexcers the dihydroxy species appeared enriched in fully saturated species . for the hexcer _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed an almost complete absence of a slight increase in and a substantial increase in . the _PROTEIN_ plants showed a slight increase in whereas in the over _PROTEIN_ line hexcer was the most abundant lipid in the dihydroxy class comprising almost of total hexcer compared with in the wild type . the increase in saturated species was more obvious in the hexcer class with both and being reduced and increasing from close to to over in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . for the _PROTEIN_ the more abundant trihydroxy classes showed almost complete loss of and species and corresponding increases in and in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ oe line both showed an increase in and and _PROTEIN_ in and with the changes being more pronounced in the _PROTEIN_ oe line . data from the less abundant dihydroxy _PROTEIN_ contained a large amount of variability . clear trends in sphingolipid composition could be seen but statistical significance could not be demonstrated . for the dihydroxy _PROTEIN_ class a virtually complete loss of was seen in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ material . this was accompanied by a large increase in . for the _PROTEIN_ oe line a substantial increase in was seen . the trends seen in the data from experiment were confirmed by data from the second experiment . oe or loss of _PROTEIN_ activity clearly had a profound effect on the levels of _PROTEIN_ monounsaturated fatty acids in arabidopsis leaf . lipidomic studies conducted on leaf glycerolipids and sphingolipids were complemented by acyl coa profiling using young rosettes collected d after germination . in wild type plants acyl coas with chain lengths from to _PROTEIN_ were detected with coa and coa being the most abundant and saturated vlcfas dominating the vlcfa acyl coa profile . although some variation was apparent in coa and coa the most dramatic differences were observed in the vlcmufas with chain lengths of _PROTEIN_ to . these fatty acids were relatively minor components of the acyl coa pool in wild type material each present at levels of around or less . compared with the wild type control the _PROTEIN_ oe line showed a fold increase in coa with levels approaching of total measured leaf acyl coas . a fold increase in coa and increases in coa and coa of and fold respectively were also seen . the percentage of below in the wild type was also increased in this line . the percentage of vlcsfas in the oe line showed little correlation to the pattern observed in the vlcmufa profile with only showing a modest but significant reduction . examination of the vlcmufa composition of the acyl coas from the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines showed no significant change in the percentage of coa or coa . levels of and were slightly reduced compared with the wild type in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants but not in the _PROTEIN_ line . percentage of coa in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants was reduced from to and respectively whereas in the _PROTEIN_ plants the average coa content was increased to . in this study the _PROTEIN_ plants appeared to show a small increase in levels of saturated vlcfa coas when compared with the other lines .
