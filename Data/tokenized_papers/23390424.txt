high throughput protein localization studies require multiple strategies . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of defined cellular fractions is one of the complementary approaches to a diverse array of cell biological methods . in recent years the protein content of different cellular compartments was approached . despite of all the efforts made the analysis of _LOCATION_ fractions remains difficult in that the dissection of the proteomes of the envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts or mitochondria is often not reliable because sample purity is not always warranted . moreover proteomic studies are often restricted to single species and therefore limited in respect to differential individual evolution . in this study we analyzed the chloroplast envelope proteomes of different plant species namely the individual proteomes of inner and outer envelope _LOCATION_ of pisum sativum and the mixed envelope proteomes of arabidopsis thaliana and medicago sativa . the analysis of all three species yielded identified proteins in total of them being unique . proteins were genuine envelope proteins found in at least two species . based on this and previous envelope studies we defined the core envelope proteome of chloroplasts . comparing the general overlap of the available six independent studies revealed only a number of envelope proteins . depending on the stringency of applied selection criteria we found envelope proteins while less stringent criteria increases this number to putative envelope proteins . based on the latter we provide a map of the outer and inner envelope core proteome which includes many yet uncharacterized proteins predicted to be involved in transport signaling and response . furthermore a foundation for the functional characterization of yet unidentified functions of the inner and oe for further analyses is provided .
we analyzed the chloroplast proteomes with focus on the envelope _LOCATION_ from three model plant species namely a. thaliana p. sativum and m. sativa . we chose a. thaliana because of the availability of a comprehensive genome and many existing transcriptome data . thus the well annotated genome of arabidopsis provides a solid base for the assignment of the identified inner and oe proteins . in turn the legumes p. sativum and m. sativa are model plants for biochemical analyses of chloroplast function _PROTEIN_ as well as crop plants . using envelopes of different plant species allows the detection of proteins with different abundances . the varying achievable purity of the samples allows the detection of an additional different set of peptides . we isolated and subfractionated chloroplasts to analyze the envelope proteomes . the enrichment of the obtained fractions was assessed by western blotting using specific antibodies . the analysis confirmed the enrichment of inner and outer _LOCATION_ proteins in the mixed envelope fractions of a. thaliana and m. sativa the mixed envelope fractions could not be further separated . in contrast separation of envelope _LOCATION_ in the ie and oe from p. sativum chloroplasts has been established previously . subsequently the distinct fractions were analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the proteome analysis . schematic representation of which fractions were isolated and analyzed . the different species are indicated for the envelope fraction results of six independent replicates three after trypsin and three after elastase digestion were combined . the fractions of mixed envelope of a. thaliana and m. sativa as well as the outer and inner envelope _LOCATION_ of p. sativum were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis followed by _METHOD_ blue staining . the migration of the molecular weight standard is indicated on the left . the purity of the fractions in was assessed by western blotting using indicated antibodies . numbers of proteins identified in the according fractions by maldi nano lc _METHOD_ and the two digestion methods indicated . gray indicates the portion for which more than one _PROTEIN_ was assigned for one protein family in white the portion where more than one isoform was specifically identified for one protein black indicates the portion for which one _PROTEIN_ was assigned . numbers of peptides not assigned by maldi nano lc _METHOD_ and blast assignment . gray indicates the portion of peptides which were assigned to one amino acid sequence only whereas white indicates the portion of peptides which were assigned to various proteins black indicates the portion of peptides which were not assigned at all . the proteomes of all envelope _LOCATION_ were analyzed by maldi nlc _METHOD_ yielding in total proteins in a. thaliana . in parallel we identified proteins in m. sativa and different proteins in both _LOCATION_ of p. sativum . our peptide based assignment relies on a stringent blast search where an identity > and no mismatch or gap was allowed . only a single amino acid substitution with a residue of similar properties or a single undefined amino acid position was accepted . the blast search was combined with a bidirectional best blast hit search to assign the homologous sequences in a. thaliana to the proteins identified in p. sativum or m. sativa to render the assignment from different species comparable . to confirm that the peptide based assignment is consistent with the expected chloroplast localization we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the corresponding genes with respect to leaves and roots . indeed almost all genes coding for the identified proteins including those identified by a single peptide only are highly _PROTEIN_ in leaf tissue . _PROTEIN_ is the only exception identified by more than one peptide with an _PROTEIN_ value smaller than in leaves . however this gene is annotated as a transposable element . furthermore almost all genes are equally high or higher _PROTEIN_ in leaves in comparison to roots . the only gene with a significantly higher _PROTEIN_ in roots than in leaves is _PROTEIN_ identified in a. thaliana . it encodes a _PROTEIN_ annotated as _PROTEIN_ which was identified in _LOCATION_ bodies . although the protein most likely represents a contamination of the sample its overall _PROTEIN_ pattern supports the peptide based protein assignment approach . while analyzing the data a large number of the obtained peptides did not lead to an identification of a protein . about of these peptides mapped uniquely to a single sequence while few peptides mapped to multiple sequences . the large portion of peptides which remained unassigned might have three different reasons the choice of too stringent search parameters contaminations of the samples or the existence of natural variances of sequences in form of unknown splice variants or nucleotide _METHOD_ of genes leading to alternative amino acid sequences . the analysis of this phenomenon however goes beyond the scope of this work . to establish a core envelope proteome we unified results of our and previous studies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for that we first assigned the arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ number of the closest homolog of a. thaliana to each of the proteins found in m. sativa and p. sativum . combining our four data sets we obtained different proteins in total . the globally unified protein pool contains a total of different proteins . ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ assigned their identified proteins according to the suborganellar _LOCATION_ localization which we have used to assess the quality of our data _LOCATION_ . we defined four different categories category i are proteins that were found in at least two studies but not in the stroma and _LOCATION_ according to ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ . category ii unites proteins which were found in at least three studies but also in the stroma or _LOCATION_ . category iii are proteins found in one study only but exclusively in the envelope and category iv are proteins found in less than three studies but also in the stroma or _LOCATION_ . the selection of three independent studies for category ii as criterion takes into account that two studies each come from et al . and weber and ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for better visualization of the impact of our study we have marked the identified proteins of the categories as identified in here or in previous studies . categories for the classification of envelope _LOCATION_ proteins . given is the category defined in the text protein identification by us or by any other proteomic study identification in the _LOCATION_ or stroma _PROTEIN_ and the number of proteins identified in or study as well as the number of proteins in each category and the number of proteins which have been identified in other cellular fractions than chloroplasts as well based on _PROTEIN_ /subaii _PROTEIN_ . from our point of view the list of proteins of category i is most reliable because there are no cross contaminations via _LOCATION_ and stroma and they are supported by previous studies . proteins of categories ii and iii have to be confirmed experimentally first and proteins of category iv are considered to be not reliably assigned . we noticed that only proteins were identified in all six studies of which three have been identified in the stroma or _LOCATION_ as well . in total we found proteins of category i. additionally we found proteins of category iii according to ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ which are not cross contaminations of the stroma or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . hence they might represent envelope proteins as well . however as stated above this conclusion should be _PROTEIN_ by biochemical approaches . the latter holds true for particularly proteins of category ii which have been identified in envelope and in stroma or _LOCATION_ . however proteins have been assigned to category iv . based on the _PROTEIN_ and subaii databases we next analyzed whether proteins have been previously assigned to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and not to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . accordingly proteins of category i were assigned to other cellular localizations according to _PROTEIN_ respectively . in category ii we found proteins and in category iii proteins respectively which have been identified in cellular compartments other than chloroplasts . thus about and of the proteins assigned to category i or category iii are found in other cellular compartments than the chloroplast . the low abundance of mislocalized proteins in category ii might reflect that the proteome of the stroma and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ has been established quite well . nevertheless the assignment of proteins in other organellar fractions does not necessarily mark them as false positive chloroplast proteins as chloroplasts are the major organelles of plant cells and thus contaminations of other fractions might exist and an increasing number of proteins are found to be dually localized . next we compared our envelope proteomes obtained for the different analyzed plants with focus on proteins assigned to categories i iii . the of total proteins assigned included proteins identified in m. truncatula proteins in a. thaliana and proteins in p. sativum . thirty nine proteins were identified in at least two plant species of which were found in all three . dissecting the protein set of p. sativum into oe and ie localized revealed a total of oe and ie proteins . twenty one proteins were found in both fractions . we compared the oe and ie proteins separately with the identified envelope proteins of the other two plants . this analysis shows that all proteins identified in all species were also found in the ie while of them are also found in the oe . similarly all proteins found in the overlap between p. sativum and a. thaliana are found in the ie fraction while the overlap with the m. sativa envelope contains four proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specifically found in the oe of p. sativum . analysis of the different proteomes with respect to the putative localization . the overlap of the proteome determined for a. thaliana m. sativa and p. sativum mixed envelope was analyzed by maldi nano lc _METHOD_ . the overlap is displayed by the shared regions of the circles in the venn diagram . the overlap of the proteome determined for a. thaliana m. sativa mixed envelope and p. sativum inner and outer envelope was analyzed and the color code is taken from . proteins in the envelope fraction of at least two species . given is the arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ number the short name and aliases the identification in a. thaliana mixed envelope m. sativa mixed envelope p. sativum outer envelope inner envelope or mixed envelope . identification of the protein is marked by an x in the column . the set of proteins found in all three species include amongst others solute transporters like lptd and _PROTEIN_ and as part of the ie/oe preprotein translocases iii _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ii . remarkably only a single protein with unknown function was identified in all envelope fractions namely . additionally seven proteins of category ii are detected in all species including the photosynthesis proteins _PROTEIN_ psad and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore three proteins involved in signaling and response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of the lipid biosynthesis are identified . remarkably we could identify only one protein of category i in the envelope fractions of a. thaliana and m. sativa which is the dually targeted s adenosylmethionine carrier _PROTEIN_ . the category i proteins involved in transport _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ preprotein import _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and signaling _PROTEIN_ could be detected in the envelope fractions of a. thaliana and p. sativum . it appears that subfractionation of ie and oe _LOCATION_ in case of the samples from p. sativum lead to an increased detection of preprotein import _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . for the envelope fractions of a. thaliana and m. sativa only the preprotein import protein v and the transport proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana and _PROTEIN_ in m. sativa could be identified . next we inspected the individual proteomes of the oe and ie _LOCATION_ of p. sativum respectively . we only assigned proteins of categories i and iii which have been identified by at least two peptides . due to the high uncertainty proteins of category ii were omitted . taking these criteria into account we could assign proteins of known function to the oe and proteins to the ie _LOCATION_ and additional proteins could not be clearly assigned . in addition we assigned proteins of unknown function of them to the ie to the oe and to the envelope in general . thus in total we were able to clearly assign oe and ie proteins and will explain them in detail in the following sections . outer envelope proteins with known function . given is the functional pathway or the organellar compartment the _PROTEIN_ number the short name the function the transmembrane anchor architecture other localization by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the number of studies where the protein was identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the category from our study . lipid biosynthesis . inner envelope proteins with known function . given is the functional pathway or the organellar compartment the _PROTEIN_ number the short name the function the transmembrane anchor architecture other localization by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the number of studies where the protein was identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the category from our study . lipid biosynthesis signaling and response _PROTEIN_ embryonic development . mixed envelope proteins with known function . given is the functional pathway or the organellar compartment the _PROTEIN_ number the short name the function the transmembrane anchor architecture other localization by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the number of studies where the protein was identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the category from our study . signaling and response _PROTEIN_ . proteins from category i and iii with unknown function . given is the fraction the protein was localized in _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ number putative function or functional domain indicated by a or closest homolog indicated by b or function annotated in geneontology c the transmembrane architecture the number of studies where the protein was identified with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the category . functional categorization of detected outer or inner envelope proteins . shown are all proteins clustered by their known functions . the proteins of each cluster are sorted by the localization in the inner or in the outer envelope fraction . proteins with an unclear localization are listed in a separated cluster . also proteins with unknown function are listed in a separated cluster . black boxes indicate proteins of category i and white boxes proteins of category iii . indicates not found in env but clearly localized to ie or oe known from literature . localized to ie or oe but only detected with one peptide . we identified homologs to known oe proteins such as components of the toc complex like iii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and iii which have been previously reported . the latter three were exclusively found in the oe _LOCATION_ . remarkably we were not able to detect v except in the envelope fraction of m. sativa . further identified proteins with confirmed oe localization were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to freezing protein _PROTEIN_ a galactolipid remodeling enzyme _PROTEIN_ and crumpled _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ which are both involved in _LOCATION_ division _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . additionally we included proteins for which significantly more peptides were found in the oe than in the ie fraction albeit their exact localization is unclear . the long chain acyl coa synthetase _PROTEIN_ the abc type transporter _PROTEIN_ and the paralog of _PROTEIN_ encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were shown to be localized in the envelope _LOCATION_ before _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similarly the kinase coae was identified in the chloroplast proteome but experimental data on the localization does not exist . the protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ is annotated as prefold in chaperone subunit family protein and was predicted to be localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . likewise ascorbate peroxidase _PROTEIN_ was previously assigned to peroxisomal _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was described as a protein of the microsomal electron transfer system . remarkably both proteins were identified as substrates of the _PROTEIN_ dependent transport _PROTEIN_ which is also involved in the transport of _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast oe _LOCATION_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was previously identified in the chloroplast proteome . although unclear these proteins are most likely dually localized to both _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts . in contrast we identified a couple of proteins which indicate a slight impurity of the sample namely _PROTEIN_ which was clearly assigned to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are _LOCATION_ proteins the mitochondrial proteins and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ protein ava and ie protein _PROTEIN_ the mgdg synthase . further _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unknown while for the protein kinase encoded by _PROTEIN_ a stromal localization was proposed _PROTEIN_ . analyzing the ie proteome of p. sativum we realized that it was in contrast to the oe fraction heavily contaminated with proteins of the stroma and the oe . first with clearly annotated oe proteins like iii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . second with stromal proteins like the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ dependent rubisco activase _PROTEIN_ the malate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and subunit _PROTEIN_ of photosystem i complex as prominent stromal contaminations . for _PROTEIN_ psad the beta subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the geranyl reductase _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ localization was determined . as expected we identified proteins of the preprotein translocon of the inner _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ii _PROTEIN_ iv _PROTEIN_ and ivb as major components of the ie fraction . although assigned to category ii we identified ie _LOCATION_ associated and _PROTEIN_ which were two chaperones previously discussed to be involved in preprotein import . we also detected two peptides for intermembrane space localized iv . remarkably the chloroplast targeted ferredoxin nadp oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ which was found to be associated with the ie via interaction with _PROTEIN_ before was clearly detected whereas _PROTEIN_ was identified by only one peptide . similarly for _PROTEIN_ we found only a single peptide as well . the absence or the low coverage of the _LOCATION_ inserted _PROTEIN_ proteins might reflect the _METHOD_ of analyzing _LOCATION_ proteins in general _PROTEIN_ . besides the _PROTEIN_ components we identified _PROTEIN_ which is described as an ie protein involved in polyquinone biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ . similarly the cell growth defect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is able to induce apoptosis when _PROTEIN_ in yeast was found to be localized in the ie of chloroplasts . sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol synthesis occurs in envelope _LOCATION_ and here identified sqdg synthase _PROTEIN_ was localized in chloroplasts . similarly we detected the stromal _PROTEIN_ involved in lipid desaturation and _PROTEIN_ involved in transport of lipids from the _LOCATION_ to chloroplasts . further we detected the _PROTEIN_ antiporter of the ie _PROTEIN_ the preprotein and amino acid transporter family protein and the potassium cation efflux antiporter _PROTEIN_ with at least four peptides . in addition one peptide each was found for the putative magnesium cation transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator _PROTEIN_ for the mitoferrin like carrier _PROTEIN_ for the _LOCATION_ sodium dependent pyruvate transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two peptides for the _LOCATION_ glutamate/malate translocator the putative sugar transporter encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as three peptides for the _LOCATION_ oxoglutarate/malate translocator _PROTEIN_ and for the maltose transporter _PROTEIN_ . the beta _PROTEIN_ anhydrase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of category ii and the three metalloproteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detected in the ie fraction were previously allocated to the stroma but they might be associated with the ie as well as suggested for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the same holds true for the dnaj like _LOCATION_ protein of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . the tocopherol cyclase is chloroplast localized and is involved in tocopherol synthesis which takes place in the ie _LOCATION_ . thus it is most likely that these six proteins are _LOCATION_ associated and correctly assigned to the ie _LOCATION_ . the proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are assigned as envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but their function remains to be explored . we further confirmed the ie localization of the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ . the latter might be inserted by the recently identified sec translocon . next to the proteins with known functions that could be clearly assigned to the oe/ie _LOCATION_ in p. sativum we identified two additional classes of proteins . the first are proteins that have a known function but could not clearly be allocated to either of the _LOCATION_ because these proteins were found only in the mixed envelope of a. thaliana and/or m. sativa . most of these proteins function as transporters like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or signaling and response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . v was the only preprotein import protein which could be identified in the mixed envelope fraction but not in the oe or ie _LOCATION_ of p. sativum . the second are proteins of which neither function nor localizations are known yet . these proteins were assigned concerning their identification in oe or ie _LOCATION_ of p. sativum . two of ie assigned proteins of unknown function were only detected in our study whereas of oe assigned unknown proteins are of category iii . to characterize the unknown proteins of the two groups and support them as potential new ie/oe envelope proteins we used topcons single _PROTEIN_ and aramemnon for secondary structure prediction . eighty five percent of the unknown ie proteins possess at least one predicted transmembrane helix and might therefore be anchored or embedded into the ie _LOCATION_ . none of the unknown oe proteins are found to be barrel structures which would have been an argument for an oe localization however it has to be taken into account the prediction of eukaryotic barrel proteins is not as reliable as of helical proteins . also the putative function via pfam _PROTEIN_ and cdd and the closest homolog via reciprocal best blast hit search were predicted to allocate the proteins correctly . interestingly most of the unknown proteins assigned to the ie are localized via _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ except of and whereas most of the oe assigned proteins are not determined at least by one database and only six proteins are localized in the _LOCATION_ .

pellet was gently resuspended in methanol . sample reduction with dtt was performed at for min and of a mm iodoacetamide in mm solution was used for sulfhydryl alkylation . following a min period of sonication the methanol was diluted to using mm buffer . the proteolytic digestion was performed by adding either of trypsin or of elastase for h at . prior to storing at the peptide containing sample was centrifuged at g for min in order to remove all undigested _LOCATION_ and finally the supernatant was concentrated to . extracted peptides were subjected to maldi nlc _METHOD_ . specifically extracted peptides were injected into an easy nlc from proxeon _METHOD_ using solvent a . separation was performed on a thermostatic custom made column at a flow rate of nl/min with increasing acetonitrile concentrations . the linear gradient profile was used for tryptic peptide digests started with solvent b in min a stagnation at this level for min followed by a quick decline to in min and finally an additional min at for column equilibration . in the case of elastase generated peptide mixtures the linear gradient profile duration was increased to min . the separated peptides were then mixed on a tee with _PROTEIN_ solution supplied by an auxiliary pump . this solution contained mg/ml cyano hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in acetonitrile and trifluoric acid . the final mixture was directly spotted every s on a blank mm mm opti lc/maldi insert metal target . subsequent maldi tof/tof measurements were carried out using the tof/tof analyzer _METHOD_ . all peptides used for calibration were taken from the peptide _METHOD_ standards kit _METHOD_ . spectra were acquired in the positive reflector mode between and m/z with fixed laser intensity . a total of laser shots per spot were accumulated . the precursor selection for _METHOD_ was carried out via the software of the instrument to avoid unnecessary multiple selections of identical precursor peptides . up to precursors per spot were selected for fragmentation each requiring a minimum signal to noise ratio of . the fragmentation of the selected precursors was performed at collision energy of kv using air as collision gas at a pressure of torr . depending on the spectral quality laser shots were recorded . potential _PROTEIN_ cluster signals were removed from precursor selection by excluding all _METHOD_ in the range from to m/z having values of m/z as well as the internal calibrant _METHOD_ . mascot generic format files were retrieved from each nlc maldi _METHOD_ run using the built in feature exporting up to peaks per _METHOD_ spectrum each requiring a minimum signal to noise of . _METHOD_ queries were processed using the mascot database search engine _PROTEIN_ . data were analyzed using the following settings below ppm _METHOD_ precursor _METHOD_ tolerance and below da _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tolerance for maldi tof/tof . for all database searches the post translational modifications _PROTEIN_ of cysteins and oxidation of methionines were both selected as variable . when tryptic searches were performed up to three missed cleavages were taken into consideration in combination with a specific cleavage after k and r and not before p. in all elastase searches the number of missed cleavages was set to the maximum value of and enzyme specificity was set to a v l i s and t but not before p. for all samples a custom viridiplantae database was generated from uniprotkb containing entries as of march . additionally for p. sativum and m. sativa samples customized databases containing and sequences were provided by the est library _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ respectively . false discovery rates _PROTEIN_ given are those originating from the internal mascot _PROTEIN_ database search function . for each nlc maldi _METHOD_ run and each sample the ions score cut off was calculated individually as log with p . the mascot analyses were described in the paper of rietschel et al . . for multiple fragmentations of identical precursors due to the reappearance in repetitions only data from the highest scoring peptide were kept . significant proteins present in all three triplicates were taken and summarized in one table for each type of experiment . afterward these tables of elastase and trypsin treatments containing non identical hits and peptides were fused . depending on the source the peptides identified by mascot or sequest were afterward aligned either to the protein database of the protein database of mips or the data file of contigs und singlets _PROTEIN_ using a standalone version of blast from ncbi _PROTEIN_ . following criteria were applied peptides were only assigned to proteins in the database if they were aligned with an identity of > they had no gaps or mismatches except for a single substitution with amino acid residues with similar qualities _PROTEIN_ or a single undefined amino acid position . short peptides which were already covered by assigned peptides were not subject to the previously mentioned criteria . those short peptides were assigned to the protein although they were not aligned with blast which is insufficiently accurate _PROTEIN_ the assignment of peptides shorter than amino acids . this method was used to reduce redundancy and as a more stringent criterion for the detection of proteins via the predicted peptides of mascot . also we used a single method to assign the different species and databases in the same way under the same parameter settings of blast . additionally we searched in parallel for the closest homolog of a. thaliana in the other species . the peptides allocated to p. sativum or m. truncatula are also allocated to the possible orthologs in a. thaliana . on the basis of the a. thaliana gene identifiers and their allocated peptides the splice variants of the proteins were merged to a single gene identifier . the next step to reduce the abundance was connecting all gene identifiers with exactly the same allocated peptides . these gene identifiers were summed up and given the name of the gene identifier with the most allocated peptides or the shortest amino acid sequence by identity . in the end gene identifiers with an overlap of allocated peptides were also combined to one gene identifier . the name of the gene identifier was chosen on the basis of the number of uniquely allocated peptides or the length of the amino acid sequence . all proteins with only one allocated peptide were handled as not significant and are listed in tables in supplementary material . all gene identifiers including splice variants and proteins which could be identified with the allocated peptides were used to predict the envelope _LOCATION_ proteins . two different experimental approaches were applied for p. sativum . the first approach for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses contained purified oe proteins . the other approach contained purified ie proteins . the peptides detected by _METHOD_ were blasted against a database of contigs and singlets of p. sativum . for classification of the detected contigs and singlets to outer or ie proteins we first had to find orthologs in a. thaliana . the contigs of the p. sativum database were blasted against the a. thaliana protein database and subsequently the best hit was reblasted against the p. sativum contigs database to verify the a. thaliana protein . the dedicated a. thaliana gene identifiers were used for the prediction of the oe and ie _LOCATION_ proteins . all gene identifiers with at least four assigned peptides were used for the analysis of the _LOCATION_ protein prediction . also the identified gene identifiers were allocated to the sub compartments in the chloroplasts . for this the plant proteome database was used which includes the experimentally annotated localizations of the a. thaliana gene identifiers . in the end the amino acid sequences of the identified proteins in the envelope pools were used to predict transmembrane helices via topcons _PROTEIN_ . the proteins of the three different _METHOD_ detected in our envelope studies were compared to previous envelope studies including proteomic data for the _LOCATION_ envelope of _LOCATION_ by et al . and weber ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and froehlich et al . _PROTEIN_ . also the detected proteins are categorized concerning their occurrence in the different studies and stroma or _LOCATION_ in this study or the study of ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ . first the function and the name of the protein represented by the gene identifiers of tables were looked up in aramemnon rel . . afterwards the predicted transmembrane fold was annotated . if aramemnon predicts transmembrane barrel structures the sequences of the gene identifiers were used to build models of respective amino acid sequence with the help of alignments to known protein structures via the protein fold recognition server . for the gene identifiers of unknown function the putative domains were searched using the protein families database _PROTEIN_ and the conserved domain database .
