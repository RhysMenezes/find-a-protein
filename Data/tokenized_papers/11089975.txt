light is a crucial environmental signal that controls many photomorphogenic and circadian responses in plants . perception and transduction of light is achieved by at least two principal groups of photoreceptors phytochromes and cryptochromes . phytochromes are red/far red light absorbing receptors encoded by a gene family of five members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . cryptochrome _PROTEIN_ cryptochrome _PROTEIN_ and phototropin are the blue/ultraviolet a light receptors that have been characterized in . previous studies showed that modulation of many physiological responses in plants is achieved by genetic interactions between different photoreceptors however little is known about the nature of these interactions and their roles in the signal transduction pathway . here we show the genetic interaction that occurs between the arabidopsis photoreceptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the control of flowering time hypocotyl elongation and circadian period by the clock . _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with _PROTEIN_ as observed in co immunoprecipitation experiments with transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . using _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer microscopy we show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in _LOCATION_ speckles that are formed in a light dependent fashion .
light signals markedly affect the pace of the clock by activating different photoreceptors . in response to increasing light intensity the period length of the circadian _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luciferase gene _PROTEIN_ . here _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings displayed a deficiency in the perception of white light as shown by a longer period length of _PROTEIN_ luciferase _PROTEIN_ at intermediate fluence rates . this effect was not observed in red light whereas in blue light only a small increment was observed at high fluence rates . these results indicate that full _PROTEIN_ function is only apparent on simultaneous illumination with multiple wavelengths of light and suggests that it has a requirement for phytochrome activation . the significance of the shorter period length in _PROTEIN_ mutants at the lowest red or blue fluence rates remains unclear . light with a reduced red/far red ratio that mimics light reflected from neighbouring vegetation causes the conversion of phytochrome from the active pfr form to the inactive pr form and results in a shade avoidance response including promotion of elongation growth and accelerated flowering . _PROTEIN_ deficient arabidopsis plants have a delayed flowering phenotype in response to extended photoperiods and regulation of floral induction is mediated by the antagonistic actions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . here the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in white light was no longer apparent under a low r/fr ratio showing a marked acceleration of flowering time . these results indicate that the active pfr form of phytochrome is required for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ phenotype . thus either _PROTEIN_ suppresses _PROTEIN_ signalling or removal of pfr overrides other pathways in which _PROTEIN_ regulates flowering . furthermore although _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed a wild type hypocotyl length in white light they displayed a long hypocotyl phenotype in white fr light . we propose that long hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is not apparent in white light because it is negated by increased _PROTEIN_ action in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with this _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed a greater promotion of elongation growth than wild type seedlings . these results are consistent with a suppression of _PROTEIN_ signalling by _PROTEIN_ . alternatively a conditional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and phytochrome signalling may also be possible . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ directly interacts with _PROTEIN_ we performed co immunoprecipitation assays with arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . immunoprecipitation with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and subsequent detection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a band with a relative molecular _METHOD_ of about _PROTEIN_ coincident with the size of the band observed in total protein extracts not subjected to immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ . the absence of signal in _PROTEIN_ deficient arabidopsis mutant plants _PROTEIN_ or in samples processed without anti _PROTEIN_ antibody _PROTEIN_ indicated the specificity of the interaction . reprobing the same blot with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody _PROTEIN_ confirmed _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ and the absence of signals in negative controls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results are consistent with a direct physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . previous reports described the _LOCATION_ localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . both human and mouse _PROTEIN_ also localize in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the _LOCATION_ localization is important for _PROTEIN_ function . we therefore examined the effects of light in _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization using a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in transfected by protoplasts _PROTEIN_ in the dark _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared homogeneously distributed within the _LOCATION_ . rapid scanning with the blue laser line of the confocal microscope or irradiation with blue light induced the formation of _LOCATION_ speckles . superimposition of bright field and _METHOD_ images clearly revealed the _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not induce speckles in cells _PROTEIN_ in the dark indicating that light may be responsible for the formation of these speckles . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein also localized in _LOCATION_ speckles indicating that these speckles were not due to artefactual _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in plants . _METHOD_ speckles were never observed when protoplasts were transfected with non fused _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fused with _PROTEIN_ . previous studies reported that _PROTEIN_ translocates to _LOCATION_ speckles under continuous red light . to examine the subcellular relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we co transfected by protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and examined the _METHOD_ signal by confocal microscopy . co transfected protoplasts were _PROTEIN_ h in the dark followed by irradiation with continuous red light for accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ speckles . these cells were then irradiated with blue light or scanned with the blue laser of the confocal microscope to induce _PROTEIN_ speckles . superimposing both images revealed that some of the speckles where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated perfectly colocalized in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize in some but not all of these _LOCATION_ speckles . it is possible that both photoreceptors might also have independent functions and that they recruit in these speckles other _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ involved in light responses . we next investigated the changes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution over time in protoplasts immobilized in agarose and examined by confocal microscopy at s intervals . figure i depicts an optical section of a _LOCATION_ showing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in speckles that did not colocalize . scanning at s intervals the same cell revealed that some or most of _PROTEIN_ speckles did colocalize with _PROTEIN_ . together these results demonstrate the light dependent colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in specific _LOCATION_ speckles . we next used _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer microscopy to determine whether the _LOCATION_ speckles are the sites where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact . fret is a quantum mechanical process by which a _METHOD_ molecule the donor transfers energy by a non radiative mechanism to an appropriately positioned chromophore the acceptor . successful methods for the detection of intramolecular fret signals in living plant cells have been developed using chromophore mutants of _METHOD_ . we report for the first time to our knowledge the use of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ combination for intermolecular detection of fret signals in living cells . before fret analysis we calculated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spectral overlap and distance to show that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ combination is a suitable donor acceptor pair for fret . the rationale of our experiments resides in the _PROTEIN_ that fret would be detected only when the fluorophores are directly interacting and not simply colocalizing . we first calibrated the microscope system using cells transfected only with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the samples were used to subtract the background and to adjust appropriately the threshold settings . this control verified that the signals obtained in fret were not due to channel overlap . to measure fret we excited cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the nm laser line and observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emission using a fvx filter . significant fret emission of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in speckles that colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate the direct molecular interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ speckles and confirm the previous results obtained in co immunoprecipitation experiments . fret measurement as described above can lead to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ owing to differences in the concentration of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or to the direct excitation of _METHOD_ at the _METHOD_ excitation wavelength . furthermore background subtraction to minimum _METHOD_ values might mask less strong fret signals and eliminate the possibility of obtaining fret efficiency maps . we therefore evaluated fret using a different method that is based on the increase of the donor _METHOD_ after photochemical destruction of the acceptor . cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in continuous red light and imaged first with the nm laser line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ with the nm laser line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we chose one of the speckles where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized and measured the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a region roughly in diameter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was subsequently photobleached by repeated scanning with the nm laser line until no signal was detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we then measured the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and compared it with that obtained in the same region before bleaching . a clear increase of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed . this effect was not detected in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles that did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in those cases the levels of _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bleaching remained the same or slightly _PROTEIN_ as compared with those observed before bleaching . to verify that fret signals were not due to fluorophore colocalization we carried out an additional negative control with cells co _PROTEIN_ non fused _METHOD_ and non fused _METHOD_ constructs . bleaching _METHOD_ that colocalized with _METHOD_ did not increase _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity relative to its _METHOD_ before bleaching . our results show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ increased at sites where fret was occurring confirming the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ speckles . the light induced _LOCATION_ compartmentalization of phytochromes the discovery that they possess kinase activity and the identification of some of their interacting partners have provided crucial understanding of how phytochromes transmit light signals . these findings suggest that regulation of protein _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation and subcellular compartmentalization may have key roles in mediating light induced physiological responses in plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are phosphorylated by the kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ . our results show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in specific _LOCATION_ speckles . it is possible that these speckles act as transcriptosomes similarly to some _PROTEIN_ described in animal cells that accumulate in a characteristic speckled pattern and are involved in processing and transcription of rna . light induced responses are also mediated by alteration of protein stability . _PROTEIN_ is strongly downregulated by blue light so the _LOCATION_ speckles could represent sites where _PROTEIN_ is degraded . recent studies have suggested that novel clock associated components contain domains involved in targeting specific substrates for proteolytic degradation . further experiments need to clarify whether these clock components are involved in _PROTEIN_ degradation and whether _PROTEIN_ has a role in this process .
wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds were grown for d in constant white light at before being either _PROTEIN_ in constant white light or transferred to white light supplemented with fr . a low r/fr ratio light was generated by supplementing white light with fr light from two _PROTEIN_ light sources . light measurements were made using an li spectroradiometer . flowering time was measured as the number of rosette leaves at bolting . data represent the mean of plants for each treatment . hypocotyl length was measured after d in the treatments using scion image software . data represent the mean of seedlings for each treatment . wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ luciferase reporter construct were grown in h white h dark cycles for d before being transferred to constant red light blue light or white light at the intensities indicated . the rhythm of bioluminescence representing _PROTEIN_ transcription was followed as described and period length was calculated by fitting a cosine wave function to the time series for each seedling . data represent the mean of seedlings representative of independent experiments . _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants were grown in h white h dark cycles and processed for co immunoprecipitation in the first min of the light cycle . _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitation was performed at for h using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody in a buffer containing mm hepes ph glycerol mm nacl triton x mm edta and mm dithiothreitol with a mixture of protease inhibitors . gammabind plus sepharose beads were used to precipitate the immunoprotein complexes . _PROTEIN_ detection was performed using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding region was obtained from the vector . _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was obtained from c. lin . the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was cloned into the vector which contains a camv promoter . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined in by protoplasts prepared and transfected as described . protoplasts were _PROTEIN_ h in the dark followed by irradiation with continuous red light for h. _PROTEIN_ speckle formation was induced after irradiation with blue light for min or after successive scanning with the nm laser of a confocal laser scanning microscope . to examine _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we scanned samples with a nm argon laser line using a nm barrierfilter and na planapo oil immersion objective . _METHOD_ signal was examined with a nm krypton laser using an fvx filter . normalized _METHOD_ emission spectrum of _METHOD_ and absorption spectrum of _METHOD_ were used to calculate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spectral overlap and distance according to the equations and where is the molar extinction coefficient of _METHOD_ is the quantum yield for _METHOD_ n is the refractive index and is the dipole orientation _PROTEIN_ . fret signals were examined by excitation with the nm argon laser and subsequent detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using a fvx filter . single fluorophore imaging allowed adjustments of the threshold settings and background subtractions to reduce the levels of crosstalk between the channels . to measure fret signals by acceptor photobleaching a pre bleached _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ image was acquired and the _METHOD_ intensity in a region of interest of in diameter was recorded using the software provided by the manufacturer . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was then photodestroyed by repeated scanning with the nm laser line . a second post bleach image of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the same region of interest was acquired . after corrections for changes in image registration the _METHOD_ intensities of the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ images were compared . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles that did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and colocalization of non fused _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were similarly processed .
