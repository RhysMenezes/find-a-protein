the genome of arabidopsis thaliana contains six genes _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which form a distinct subfamily within the large family of more than monosaccharide transporter like _METHOD_ genes . so far only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been characterized and was shown to be a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized h symporter with broad substrate specificity . the characterization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two other almost identical members of this transporter subfamily are presented here . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas in baker 's yeast revealed that these proteins catalyse the energy dependent high capacity transport of fructose and xylitol and the transport of several other compounds with lower rates . _PROTEIN_ of their crnas in xenopus laevis oocytes showed that both proteins are voltage dependent and catalyse the symport of their substrates with protons . fusions of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localized to arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . analyses of reporter genes performed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoter sequences showed _PROTEIN_ in mature _PROTEIN_ or germinating _PROTEIN_ pollen grains as well as in growing pollen tubes hydathodes and young xylem cells . the _PROTEIN_ was confirmed with an anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum raised against peptides conserved in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the physiological roles of the proteins are discussed and related to plant cell wall modifications .
in silico analyses of the arabidopsis genome revealed five open reading frames for transporters with significant homology to the previously characterized arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ polyol transporter _PROTEIN_ . two of these genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located on chromosome with their start _PROTEIN_ being separated by nucleotides . both genes are interrupted by introns and in both genes these introns are inserted at identical positions yielding exons that encode identical numbers of amino acids . the first of these two introns is conserved in all atpmt genes the second only in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the high degree of similarity in the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is conserved also within their intron sequences that are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and identical _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . moreover the first nucleotides of the flanking sequences share identity . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the result of a gene duplication in the recent history of arabidopsis evolution . as a result of this high degree of sequence similarity microarrays do not discriminate between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . they do show however that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the pmt genes with the lowest _PROTEIN_ levels in arabidopsis . comparison of the six arabidopsis pmt proteins . schematic alignment of the deduced protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ based on the intron positions in the respective genes . grey vertical bars indicate the positions of the predicted transmembrane helices thin lines show two small gaps in the sequence . numbers of amino acids encoded by the different exons are indicated . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were obtained from whole plant rna preparations by rt pcr . the resulting protein sequences confirmed predicted protein sequences _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the proteins have similar molecular _METHOD_ and isoelectric points _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and these values are in the same range as those of three other atpmts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine the functional properties of the two transporters their cdnas were cloned into the unique noti site of the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ n . constructs harbouring the cdnas in sense or antisense orientation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used to transform yeast strain eby.vw that has no background of monosaccharide transporter activity . the resulting strains were named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in a first approach and cells were used for competition analyses . to this end the transport of sorbitol was tested first and as sorbitol was transported by both cell lines the uptake rates for sorbitol in the presence of several potential competitors all at a fold molar excess were determined . in both strains uptake of sorbitol was strongly reduced in the presence of xylitol several pentoses inositol _LOCATION_ inositol and unlabelled sorbitol with xylitol being the best competitor in both cases . fructose was also an excellent competitor of _PROTEIN_ driven sorbitol uptake mannitol and several other compounds were only poor or no competitors . this result suggested that like _PROTEIN_ and pmt type transporters from polyol translocating species _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are broad spectrum sugar/polyol transporters with a preference for xylitol and fructose . functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the monosaccharide transport deficient yeast strain eby.vw . _PROTEIN_ driven or _PROTEIN_ driven uptake of sorbitol into transgenic baker 's yeast in the presence of different potential competitors that were added at a fold molar excess . transport of the indicated compounds into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain and into the strain that _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna in antisense orientation . transport of the indicated compounds into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain and into the strain that _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna in antisense orientation . ph dependence and sensitivity to the uncoupler cccp of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . direct transport assays were performed next with a selected set of radiolabelled substrates including sorbitol _PROTEIN_ galactose fructose xylose and xylitol ribose and inositol . all transport tests were performed at an initial substrate concentration of mm . although the maximal transport rates determined for _PROTEIN_ in cells were about lower than those of _PROTEIN_ in cells the relative transport rates were quite similar for both transporters . the relative permeability sequence _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that xylitol and fructose represented the preferred substrates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . uptake of the different substrates was also studied in the antisense yeast strains and . the rates determined in these strains were negligible . ph dependence and uncoupler sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appeared similar . transport rates increased with _PROTEIN_ ph values but the ph dependence was steeper for _PROTEIN_ than for _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with this a strong sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone an uncoupler of proton gradients was found for both transporters . the cccp effect on _PROTEIN_ was more pronounced than on _PROTEIN_ . both sets of experiments suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as h symporters . when determining the km values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for their putatively best substrate xylitol almost identical affinities were obtained with for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ . in addition the km of _PROTEIN_ was determined for sorbitol and the km of _PROTEIN_ was determined for _PROTEIN_ . these results confirm that xylitol is the best substrate of both transporters . determination of the km values for xylitol for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . michaelis menten type kinetics for xylitol uptake were determined in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells . inserts show lineweaver burke plots of the same data sets . xenopus laevis oocytes had been used for the successful _PROTEIN_ of crna of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h symporter _PROTEIN_ and of several other h symporters . therefore this system was used to analyse the putatively electrogenic transport _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . following the injection of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ crnas into xenopus oocytes xylitol dependent ion currents were monitored . these currents were not affected by k na or n methylglucamine ions in the bath medium pointing to protons as the symported ion species . no xylitol induced currents were detected in water injected controls . characterization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in crna injected xenopus oocytes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes mediate h inward currents in response to xylitol application . the presence of kcl and nacl or of n methylglucamine chloride in the external bath solution did not effect the characteristics of xylitol induced currents . measurements were recorded at a _LOCATION_ potential of mv and ph . h currents elicited by xylitol were recorded at the indicated _LOCATION_ potentials . the external solution contained mm kcl and mm nacl and was adjusted to ph . experimental design as in but with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes . same conditions as in but with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes . currents induced by the polyol appeared strongly voltage dependent . steps in _LOCATION_ potentials from mv to mv and mv elicited gradually increasing inward currents . thereby _LOCATION_ hyperpolarization increased the electrochemical force for protons to enter the transporter and together with the polyol released the co transported solutes into the cytoplasm . together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyse the electrogenic voltage dependent symport of protons with xylitol . although the transport activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast and xenopus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ provided indirect evidence that these proteins might be transporters of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to other _LOCATION_ in planta can not be excluded . to identify the subcellular localization of both transporters in arabidopsis the open reading frame for green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was attached to the ends of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cdnas and the resulting constructs were used for transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts or in intact arabidopsis epidermal cells . all cells transformed with these constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed strong and specific labelling of their cell surfaces . chloroplasts _METHOD_ are clearly located inside this labelled structure . this localization supports the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as the origin of the signal rather than the tonoplast or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct in an arabidopsis protoplast after chemical transformation . arabidopsis epidermis cell transformed by particle bombarded with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ of an _METHOD_ fusion construct in an arabidopsis protoplast after chemical transformation . arrows show localization of chloroplasts _METHOD_ inside the _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . all images show single confocal sections . bars are . for each gene two separate reporter gene constructs with the orfs of gus _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ were generated . promoter fragments were obtained from pcr amplifications that introduced hindiii cloning sites at the ends and ncoi cloning sites at the transcriptional start sites . promoter/reporter cassettes were generated inserted into _PROTEIN_ and used to transform arabidopsis plants . for each construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transformants were analysed . during the analysis of plants gus staining was found in the hydathodes and in pollen grains germinating on stylar papillae or on agar medium in seven plants . no staining was detected in pollen grains inside the anthers or in released but yet ungerminated pollen grains . one plant showed weak staining in the vasculature of its flower stalks . analysis of embedded cross sections showed that this staining resulted from very low gus activity in the cambium and from slightly stronger gus activity in young xylem cells . gus stainings of plants . anther of a plant with no gus activity . closed and just opening pollen grains on agar medium . ungerminated and germinated pollen grains the latter with a well developed pollen tube . cross section through a flower stalk showing gus histochemical staining in the centre of two vascular bundles . higher magnifications of cross sections from flower stalk vascular bundles . arrows show regions with the typical stacks of cambium and newly formed phloem and xylem vessels . bars are in in and in . analysis of plants confirmed the already described _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen . in contrast to the gus staining observed in pollen however this staining was much stronger and was detected in pollen grains of still closed anthers . moreover our analyses also revealed gus activity in hydathodes and in minor veins of several plants . finally one plant showed staining in the vasculature of the flower stalks . the latter signal resulted from low gus activity in the cambium and from stronger gus activity in young xylem cells . reporter gene analyses of _METHOD_ and plants . inflorescence of a plant with strong gus staining in the mature anthers . higher magnification of an anther with very strong gus staining in fully developed pollen grains and in germinated and ungerminated pollen on agar medium . staining of cells in the anther surface results from the diffusion of excess stain out of the pollen grains and can even reach the sepals and _PROTEIN_ of stained flowers . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in pollen grains on an opened anther from a _METHOD_ plants . no _METHOD_ is seen in wt anthers . strong gus staining in source leaf hydathodes and very weak gus staining in minor veins . cross section of a flower stalk with gus staining in young xylem cells . a bar indicates the region where the single celled row of cambial cells is located . the cambial cells _METHOD_ can not be identified . bars are mm . while _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could not be detected in any of the _METHOD_ plants of the _METHOD_ plants showed intense _METHOD_ in their mature pollen grains . this _METHOD_ was detected only during the _PROTEIN_ stages of pollen development i.e . in still closed anthers of just opening flowers . the signal increased further with ongoing anther dehiscence . no other sites of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were detected . this _METHOD_ signal was absent from wild type pollen . the observed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in pollen is supported by data from publicly accessible microarray analyses that show strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ exclusively in mature pollen . however as already mentioned these microarray data show identical data for _PROTEIN_ as they do not discriminate between these two almost identical genes _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . moreover the data presented do not show _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in any other tissue which could result from weak promoter activities in only a limited number of cells of a given organ for example in young xylem cells of the flower stalk . to test this possibility and to confirm or confute the gus stainings observed in flower stalks antisera were raised against a mixture of two peptides _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ predicted to represent immunogenic regions in _PROTEIN_ . these peptides corresponded to the regions and of _PROTEIN_ . the respective regions of _PROTEIN_ are either identical or very similar _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and resulting antibodies were therefore not expected to discriminate between these proteins . peptides for the production of potentially monospecific antibodies could not be identified . the quality of the antisera was first tested in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells . sera from two immunized rabbits _PROTEIN_ recognized _PROTEIN_ in detergent extracts of enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from yeast cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna . most importantly however immunolocalizations with sections from yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ either in a sense or in an antisense orientation labelled _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ equally well in sense but not in antisense sections and labelled the cell surface exclusively most likely the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these cells . this demonstrated that as expected the sera do not discriminate between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the sera however appeared to be suitable to detect these proteins in immunohistochemical analysis of plant tissue . characterization of the antisera in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells . western blot of _PROTEIN_ solubilized enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells or from cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna in antisense orientation . antisera from two rabbits _PROTEIN_ were used at dilutions of and yielded prominent signals only in extracts from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . decoration of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins at the cell surfaces of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells with _PROTEIN_ . an overview with many cells is shown for _PROTEIN_ a single cell is shown for _PROTEIN_ . no _METHOD_ was seen in antisense controls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . bars are for the _PROTEIN_ sections and for all _PROTEIN_ sections . based on these results immunohistochemical analyses of cross sections from arabidopsis wt flower stalks were performed with unpurified _PROTEIN_ antiserum . shows that this serum labelled the same cell layers that were stained by the gus histochemical stainings shown in and in . no _METHOD_ was detected when preimmune serum was used for these analyses . the use of affinity purified _PROTEIN_ improved the signal intensity but did not alter the specificity of the labelling . this confirmed the observed gus staining that pointed to and activities in young xylem cells although this staining was only seen in a very few transgenic plants . labelling of young xylem cells with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis wt plants . _METHOD_ image showing two vascular bundles of a flower stalk cross section from an arabidopsis wt plant _PROTEIN_ . vascular bundle of a similar section treated with preimmune serum . white light image and _METHOD_ image . white light merged with _METHOD_ image and _METHOD_ image alone of a similar image treated with affinity purified _PROTEIN_ . boxed regions in and show typical stacks of cells . _METHOD_ in and results from _METHOD_ of cell wall phenolics . bars are . in publicly available t dna insertion libraries mutants with t dna insertions in an exon or intron of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could not be found but four lines were identified that had insertions in the intergenic region between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ start _PROTEIN_ . in three of these lines the predicted insertions seemed to be too far upstream from the translational start sites to affect the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . therefore only one mutant that was predicted to carry an insertion near the translational start _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was analysed . demonstrates that the insertion in this _PROTEIN_ mutant was bp upstream from the _PROTEIN_ a distance that might still be long enough to allow _PROTEIN_ of the downstream _PROTEIN_ coding region . in _PROTEIN_ when the _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were compared in three wt and three _PROTEIN_ plants by rt pcr similar levels were found in all the plants analysed . characterization of t dna and antisense lines . genomic organization of the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele that carries a t dna insertion in the flanking region nucleotides upstream from the start _PROTEIN_ . arrows show the position of the primers used for the characterization of the mutant . the upper right corner shows rt pcr analyses with cdnas from three homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and from three wt plants . _PROTEIN_ bands can be amplified from the _PROTEIN_ and from the wt cdnas . amplified bands of _PROTEIN_ are shown as controls . representative rt pcr analysis of five independent _PROTEIN_ antisense lines and of a wt plant . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified with gene specific primers . only the _PROTEIN_ transcript is absent from all _PROTEIN_ antisense lines . in a second approach an rnai construct was used that was designed to reduce _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels simultaneously . this construct carried the region with the highest sequence conservation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in opposite directions under the control of the promoter . after transformation of arabidopsis plants with this construct a large number of independent transgenic lines was identified . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in these plants were then compared with the corresponding mrna levels in wt plants . thereby _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found down regulated or absent from most of these plants whereas that of _PROTEIN_ was not affected . therefore neither the _PROTEIN_ mutant nor the pmv plants were used for further analyses .
arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in growth chambers on potting soil under a h light/dark regime at and relative humidity or in the greenhouse under ambient conditions . for heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas in yeast strain eby.vw was used . escherichia coli strain was used for all basic cloning steps . transformation of arabidopsis was performed using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were amplified from whole plant total rna with gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding to the very ends _PROTEIN_ or the very ends of the cdnas . these pcr reactions added the nucleotide sequence aag ctt gta aaa gaa immediately upstream of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ from the start _PROTEIN_ as this sequence has repeatedly been shown to improve _PROTEIN_ of foreign genes in yeast . moreover they added noti cloning sites to both ends of the constructs . the resulting cdnas were cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ n sequenced and used for transformation of yeast cells . if not otherwise indicated uptake experiments were performed in mm sodium phosphate buffer as described by et al . . the uncoupler cccp was added to a final concentration of s before substrate addition . for functional analysis in x. laevis oocytes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were cloned into the plasmid _PROTEIN_ . crnas were prepared using the mmessage mmachine rna transcription kit . oocyte preparation and crna injection have been described elsewhere . in two electrode voltage clamp studies oocytes were perfused with a standard solution containing mm kcl mm nacl mm mm adjusted to ph with mes/tris buffers . the standard solution was replaced with mm nmgcl as indicated in the figures . currents in the absence of substrates were subtracted for leak correction . promoter fragments of bp _PROTEIN_ and bp _PROTEIN_ were pcr amplified from arabidopsis col genomic dna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the primer pairs introduced an n terminal hindiii site and a c terminal ncoi site that were used to clone the resulting fragments in front of the orf of gus in a based plasmid . from there _PROTEIN_ yielding the plasmids pmv and pmv . for the generation of _METHOD_ fusions the same pcr derived promoter fragments were cloned in front of the orf of _METHOD_ in a based plasmid and then also cloned as hindiii/saci fragments into _PROTEIN_ yielding the plasmids pmv _METHOD_ and pmv _METHOD_ . the different constructs were used for transformation of arabidopsis . for transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion constructs the plasmid was used . the coding sequences were pcr amplified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these primers introduced ncoi sites in font of the respective start _PROTEIN_ and a second ncoi site after the last amino acid of the respective orf . these second ncoi sites replaced the stop codons of the original sequences . these modified orfs were inserted into the unique ncoi cloning site representing the start _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ orf in the plasmid . the continuous orfs were confirmed by sequencing . the resulting constructs were used for transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts or in tobacco epidermis cells . the position of the t dna insertion in was determined using the left border specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and with the _PROTEIN_ specific primer _PROTEIN_ . for production of an rnai construct in phannibal a bp fragment corresponding to the region from to in the _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ was amplified with the primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that added two restriction sites to each end . the fragment was cloned between the xbai and hindiii sites of phannibal and between the kpni and xhoi sites of phannibal . the rnai construct was then inserted into _PROTEIN_ yielding . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were determined by rt pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for production of an anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum two _PROTEIN_ derived peptides that were identical or almost identical in the _PROTEIN_ protein were synthesized and used to immunize two rabbits . pre immune sera were taken from each rabbit prior to the first immunization . sera from bleedings performed d after the first immunization were used without further purification sera from bleedings performed d after the first immunization were affinity purified with column bound peptides . this purification was performed by pineda service . binding of or of preimmune serum to microtome sections of fixed and embedded yeast cells or plant material _METHOD_ was visualized after incubation with anti rabbit igg fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer conjugate as described by . microscopic slides were mounted in anti fading medium and viewed under appropriate excitation light . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells and protein extracts of these _LOCATION_ were enriched as described by separated on sodium dodecylsulphate _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters . _PROTEIN_ protein bands were detected by treatment of the filters with anti rabbit igg antiserum peroxidase conjugate followed by incubation with lumi light western blotting substrate . images of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were made with an _METHOD_ microscope with an excitation wavelength of nm . emitted _METHOD_ was monitored at detection wavelengths longer than nm . standard protocols were used for gus histochemical staining of plant tissues _PROTEIN_ . all stainings were performed for a minimum of h or longer . for analyses of flower stalk sections stained tissue was fixed for h at room temperature in glutaraldehyde washed with water cleared with ethanol dehydrated embedded in according to the manufacturers protocol and cut with razor blades .
