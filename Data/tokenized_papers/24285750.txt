recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns _PROTEIN_ induces multiple defense _METHOD_ to limit pathogen growth . here we show that the arabidopsis thaliana tandem zinc finger protein _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ responsive mitogen activated protein kinases and is required to trigger a full _PROTEIN_ triggered immune response . analysis of a mutant revealed attenuation in specific _PROTEIN_ triggered reactions such as reactive oxygen species accumulation mapk activation and partially the _PROTEIN_ of several _PROTEIN_ responsive genes . in accordance with these weaker _PROTEIN_ triggered responses mutant plants exhibit enhanced susceptibility to virulent pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato . visualization of _PROTEIN_ localization by fusion to green _METHOD_ protein revealed cytoplasmic foci that co localize with marker proteins of processing bodies . this localization pattern is affected by inhibitor treatments that limit mrna availability or block _LOCATION_ export . coupled with its ability to bind the ribohomopolymers poly and poly these results suggest involvement of _PROTEIN_ in post transcriptional regulation such as mrna processing or storage pathways to regulate plant innate immunity .
_PROTEIN_ was identified as a potential _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ substrate through an unbiased protein array screen . to re validate phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by mapks a full length _PROTEIN_ mbp protein was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli purified and used as a substrate for in vitro kinase assays by gluthathione s transferase tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the phosphorylation of the substrate was detected by staining with the _METHOD_ proq diamond phosphoprotein stain after running _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . increased _METHOD_ signals corresponding to _PROTEIN_ mbp were observed after incubation with recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ thus confirming _PROTEIN_ as an in vitro _PROTEIN_ substrate . in vivo interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were tested by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay in transiently transformed arabidopsis protoplasts . reconstitution of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggested interactions between _PROTEIN_ and the tested mapks in both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . occasionally _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ speckles were also observed _PROTEIN_ . no reconstituted _METHOD_ signals were seen in corresponding negative controls for the bifc assays and hence support the specificities of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions . in all cases protein bands of the expected sizes for the fusion were detected by western blot thus excluding that the bifc signals may be due to truncated protein fragments . hence _PROTEIN_ shows in vivo interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to validate the in vitro phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by mapks protoplasts _PROTEIN_ epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ were treated with _PROTEIN_ . a reduced mobility of the _PROTEIN_ band in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as a reduction in the _PROTEIN_ protein level was observed . in vitro phosphatase treatment of the proteins extracted from the treated protoplasts restored the protein mobility in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to that of the untreated or water treated protoplasts . hence taken together with the in vitro phosphorylation data these findings are indicative of an in vivo mapk mediated _PROTEIN_ phospho modification after treatment presumably leading to alteration of _PROTEIN_ protein stability . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ activated a mapk substrate such as _PROTEIN_ may contribute to cellular signaling induced by _PROTEIN_ . a reverse genetic approach was followed to address possible roles of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ signaling . various _PROTEIN_ dependent responses were analyzed in a knockout t dna insertion line . constant exposure to _PROTEIN_ arrests plant development and the root growth inhibition is a facile quantitative readout of such _PROTEIN_ mediated effects . wild type col and mutant plants were grown in medium supplemented with or . under these experimental conditions seedlings are partially sensitive to _PROTEIN_ with less root growth inhibition compared with the col seedlings . besides this root growth arrest aerial tissues of the treated seedlings remained partially green compared with the brown col seedlings . to exclude that the altered growth arrest might be due to second site mutation in the t dna insertion mutant line complementation with a genomic clone was performed . response to is restored in the complemented line corroborating that the phenotype is indeed caused by the mutation . treatment induces reactive oxygen species accumulation in leaf discs from week old plants with typically a peak of maximum ros production around min post elicitation . a statistically significant reduction in ros accumulation was detected in the mutant after treatment . the complemented line showed ros accumulation that is intermediate between the wild type and mutant plants suggesting a partial complementation . phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leading to activation of these four mapks is another early event elicited after recognition of _PROTEIN_ . in order to compare _PROTEIN_ induced mapk activation we elicited week old seedlings that were grown in liquid murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium . activated mapks were visualized by immunoblot using an anti ptepy antibody that recognizes phosphorylated _METHOD_ of mapks . compared with the seedlings from the wild type and the complemented line a reduction in mapk activation after treatment was detected in the mutant . collectively the mutant is attenuated in _PROTEIN_ induced early signaling events . _PROTEIN_ perception induces transcriptional reprogramming to mount corresponding defense responses necessary for restricting the progress of a potential pathogen . _PROTEIN_ of two _PROTEIN_ responsive genes that require mapk activation for a full response was compared between col and by real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in the mutant . this was partially restored in the complemented transgenic least for the _PROTEIN_ gene . thus _PROTEIN_ is partially required for a full induction of defense gene _PROTEIN_ . taken together besides _PROTEIN_ responses such as _PROTEIN_ induced growth arrest _PROTEIN_ is required for mounting a full response to several early _PROTEIN_ induced processes _PROTEIN_ . in order to test whether the partial insensitivity of the mutant to _PROTEIN_ also reflects an overall weaker resistance to pathogens col mutant and the complemented line were spray inoculated with virulent p. syringae pv . tomato . leaves were collected d after inoculation surface sterilized and the bacterial titer in the leaf intercellular spaces determined . bacterial growth was significantly higher in compared with col plants d post inoculation . the complemented line showed an intermediate level of bacterial susceptibility between the col and the mutant suggesting partial complementation . since similar levels of bacteria were observed on day the increased bacterial titer in plants is unlikely to be caused by enhanced initial entry through stomata . therefore partial insensitivity to _PROTEIN_ leading to attenuated defense reactions presumably led to enhanced susceptibility of the mutant to virulent bacteria . the _PROTEIN_ protein family of arabidopsis consists of members all of which were localized in cytoplasmic foci when _PROTEIN_ heterologously in maize mesophyll protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ co localizing with markers of p bodies . transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts was performed to investigate if _PROTEIN_ localizes into p bodies . initial experiments were performed using the cauliflower mosiac virus promoter to drive the _PROTEIN_ but to exclude overexpression artifacts an arabidopsis promoter of moderate _PROTEIN_ strength was subsequently used . in all cases signals for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were observed in the cytoplasm often as prominent cytoplasmic roundish structures . when co _PROTEIN_ with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins two well established components of p bodies most of the _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic foci co localized with these p body markers . assembly disassembly of p bodies is dependent on mrnas that are potentially delivered into them . cycloheximide is typically used as a protein translation inhibitor in eukaryotes but since the stalled translation traps mrna within polysomes mrna availability is reduced and p body formation limited . hence chx treatment to disrupt p body structures is hailed as a hallmark test for tracking p body associated proteins . indeed chx treatment _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals within cytoplasmic foci in transfected arabidopsis protoplasts with most of the signals relocated into the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . inhibition of transcription by actinomycin d is another alternative to suppress mrna accumulation and formation of p bodies . similar to the chx treatment actd disrupted the cytoplasmic foci of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leading to a cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously also been shown to accumulate in _LOCATION_ after treatment with leptomycin b an inhibitor of _LOCATION_ export suggesting shuttling between the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . when transfected protoplasts were incubated with lepb _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cytoplasmic foci signals were abolished . however there is no exclusive _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that the lepb effect is presumably indirect i.e . prevention of _LOCATION_ export of an unknown protein target is also required for _PROTEIN_ assembly into p bodies . note that for the above mentioned experiments immunoblot analysis verified that these chemical treatments altered the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization but not the accumulation of the intact protein . as a comparison the effects of chx actd and lepb on localization of the p body marker _PROTEIN_ were also analyzed . chx reduced the number of tdtomato _PROTEIN_ associated p body signals while actd and lepb had no apparent effects . this difference to the effects on _PROTEIN_ localization by the same chemical treatments highlights the dynamic nature of _PROTEIN_ shuttling within the cell . in particular the different effect of actd treatments on _PROTEIN_ vs. _PROTEIN_ redistribution suggests that there are different populations of p bodies . a possible implication of this would be that the target mrnas required for _PROTEIN_ assembly within p bodies are short lived as compared with mrnas in the other p bodies resistant to actd mediated disruption . all the above experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ localization in p bodies is dependent on the availability of the target mrnas . to gain insights in the potential relationship between mrna association and the localization of _PROTEIN_ in p bodies the putative rna binding ccch motifs of _PROTEIN_ were deleted . in most of the transiently transformed protoplasts the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein no longer localized to cytoplasmic foci . however it must also be pointed out that a few cytoplasmic foci are sporadically observed but at lower frequency . in contrast deletion of the putative protein protein interaction ankyrin repeat motif _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not compromise the _PROTEIN_ localization in cytoplasmic foci . western blot analysis was used to confirm the integrity of the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins indicating that the altered _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nucleocytoplasmic localization was not due to truncated or free _METHOD_ . the localization studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in post transcriptional processes possibly in coordination with components of p bodies . however the rna binding activity and potential rna targets of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins are still unknown . to confirm rna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ an rna electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ was performed using recombinant _PROTEIN_ mbp and the ribohomopolymers of a g c and u . we purified the _PROTEIN_ mbp through two affinity steps _PROTEIN_ since pilot experiments showed that unknown e. coli protein contaminants from the single ni _PROTEIN_ agarose purification step can bind poly . under our experimental conditions _PROTEIN_ mbp _METHOD_ rna complexes with poly and poly but not with the other two ribohomopolymers . the smeary radioactive signals presumably reflect the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ may bind to multiple sites on the poly or poly sequence used . additionally poly /poly are unlikely to be the ideal high affinity target of _PROTEIN_ so that dissociation of the complex may occur during separation on the _METHOD_ gels . some degradation of the free poly was also seen with wild type _PROTEIN_ but most importantly no high molecular weight smear was observed . a negative control with an equivalent volume of bacterial extracts that were purified through the two purification steps did not show any binding to any of the ribohomopolymers . interestingly deletion of ccch type motifs compromised the binding to poly and poly further supporting the hypothesis that the ccch motif mediates binding to rna .
full length _PROTEIN_ without a stop codon was amplified by pcr using the primer combination sd orf _GENE_ and sd _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and cloned into pentr/d for subsequent generation of c terminal fusions . deletion of ccch type motifs and ankyrin repeats was performed by whole plasmid amplification with turbopfu polymerase with the full length open reading frame as template and the primer combination _PROTEIN_ delccch r and _PROTEIN_ delccch l to generate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ l _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ r to generate _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ orf and domain deleted variants were transferred via gateway recombination methods into pdest mbp and pubc dest _METHOD_ for bacterial and protoplast _PROTEIN_ respectively . a mutant was obtained from the european arabidopsis stock centre and verified using standard pcr conditions with the primers listed in supplementary table . in order to complement the phenotype of mutant a genomic _PROTEIN_ fragment harboring the promoter and native utr was amplified by pcr by using the primers fwd and rev cloned into pcr blunt and subcloned into _PROTEIN_ via the bamhi and saci restriction sites . the construct was introduced into mutant plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . growth and treatment of a. thaliana plants were performed as previously described . briefly seeds of col wild type and the mutant were surface sterilized and stratified at for d. to determine root growth inhibition seeds were germinated on _PROTEIN_ agar plates . seedlings grown in liquid _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose and mm mes were used to analyse mapk activation and defense related gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ were supplemented at the indicated concentrations and the seedlings were harvested at the indicated time points . plants grown on soil in climate chambers under short day conditions were used to determine _PROTEIN_ induced ros accumulation and for preparing protoplasts . production of ros was assayed as described using mm leaf discs in well plates measured at min intervals . statistical significance of the differences was tested by kruskall wallis test . activated mapks were detected by western blot with anti ptepy _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as described in day old liquid grown seedlings elicited with _PROTEIN_ . for the dephosphorylation assay protoplasts were lysed directly in the phosphatase buffer provided by the supplier with mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mix p freshly added . phosphatase was added to of protoplast extracts incubated at inactivated by boiling in laemmli loading buffer and subjected to western blot analysis . two week old seedlings grown in _METHOD_ medium were stimulated with _PROTEIN_ and samples were collected at the indicated time points . as a negative control seedlings without stimulation were collected in parallel at the same time points . total rna was extracted using the conventional trizol method followed by dnase i treatment . dnase i treated rna was reverse transcribed with oligo and revert aid reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturers instructions . relative _PROTEIN_ of defense related genes was determined with primers and fam labeled taqman probes as listed in supplementary table . the reference gene _PROTEIN_ was used for the normalization of the _PROTEIN_ . three biological replicates were performed with replicate measurements for each time point . significance of the differences in gene _PROTEIN_ was tested with student s t test . arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated and transformed with the various versions of _PROTEIN_ cloned in pubc dest _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as well as the p body markers tdtomato _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ both in the prtds vector _PROTEIN_ . in vivo detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or tdtomato _PROTEIN_ was conducted with an _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope using a nm argon laser to excite _METHOD_ and a nm argon laser to excite _METHOD_ or tdtomato . images were captured and processed by using zen software . protoplasts were treated with ng chx ng actd and nm lepb around h after transformation . alterations in subcellular localization were assessed min after chx or actd treatments and h after lepb treatment . for the bifc assay protoplasts were transformed with puc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or pe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in combination with puc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after approximately h incubation in the dark confocal microscopy was used to visualize the _METHOD_ signals re constituted in the event of protein protein interactions . spectral properties of the _METHOD_ signals were confirmed with lambda scanning i.e . the observed signals were from _METHOD_ and not spectral bleed through of background _METHOD_ . leaves of week old col and plants were spray inoculated with a suspension of cfu of p. syringae pv . tomato . infected leaves were harvested h post inoculation and d after inoculation . bacterial growth was determined by colony counting of serial dilutions on lb plates supplemented with rifampicin . full length _PROTEIN_ mbp was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli krx which harbors a rhamnose inducible system for _PROTEIN_ proteins . the bacterial growth and induction of protein _PROTEIN_ were performed following the manufacturer s standard protocol . recombinant protein was purified under native conditions . mapk activation was performed by incubation of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ ortholog from parsley and re purified with glutathione sepharose . mapk assay was performed by incubating active _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mbp in substrate buffer _PROTEIN_ for min . proteins were afterwards separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and phospho _PROTEIN_ mbp was detected by diamond phosphoprotein gel stain . to test for potential rna binding activity recombinant _PROTEIN_ mbp and _PROTEIN_ mbp _PROTEIN_ in e. coli were purified by ni _PROTEIN_ agarose and amylose bead chromatography . note that the second affinity step was crucial in removal of unspecific rna binding e. coli contaminants . a negative control with extracts from untransformed e. coli cells which were also purified through the two step affinity purification was included . the four different ribo homopolymers were synthesized by mwg biotech . to remove synthesis contaminants or partial length

extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ with gentle shaking . acrylamide was removed by centrifugation and the eluted rna was precipitated with isopropanol washed with ethanol and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate _PROTEIN_ treated water . the ribohomopolymers were labeled with polynucleotide kinase and _PROTEIN_ according to citation . the unincorporated radioactivity was removed using mini quick spin oligo columns . rna labeling was assessed by analytic denaturing _PROTEIN_ and autoradiography . rna binding and separation of unbound probes on non denaturing _PROTEIN_ were performed according to citation . briefly recombinant proteins were pre incubated with binding buffer for min at room temperature and afterwards approximately nmol of labeled ribohomopolymers were added to the
