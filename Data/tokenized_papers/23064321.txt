salicylic acid signaling acts in defense and plant development . the only gene demonstrated to be required for the response to sa is arabidopsis thaliana non _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ related gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are insensitive to sa . by focusing on the effect of analogs of sa on plant development we identified mutants in additional genes acting in the sa response . in this work we describe a gene necessary for the sa non recognition of _PROTEIN_ . three _PROTEIN_ alleles recovered from the screen cause phenotypes similar to the wild type in the tested conditions except for sa related phenotypes . plants with _PROTEIN_ null alleles _PROTEIN_ profound insensitivity to sa even more than _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ null mutants are also sterile and their growth is compromised . plants carrying weaker _PROTEIN_ alleles are also insensitive to sa with some quantitative differences in some phenotypes like systemic acquired resistance or pathogen growth restriction . when weak alleles are used _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations produce an additive phenotype but we did not find evidence of a genetic interaction in nor biochemical interaction in yeast or in planta . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be a subunit of mediator the ortholog of in arabidopsis . mechanistically _PROTEIN_ functions downstream of _PROTEIN_ to regulate the sa response .
we previously performed a genetic screen for genes involved in the sa response the first locus we found was _PROTEIN_ with alleles . the fourth locus from this screen was named _PROTEIN_ and the rest of the loci will be described elsewhere . _PROTEIN_ is defined by three alleles which came from independent ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenesis events . the plants with these alleles were almost as insensitive to bth as _PROTEIN_ plants at least in _METHOD_ of diminished fresh weight when grown in the presence of bth . the _PROTEIN_ plants had a less severe phenotype than the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . the mutants were recessive although in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with columbia showed an effect on the sa response as happens with the with _PROTEIN_ . there was no genetic interaction with _PROTEIN_ in the and the between the _PROTEIN_ alleles were as insensitive to bth as their parents . the screen and the quantification of the fresh weight were performed with bth . it was possible that these _PROTEIN_ plants were impaired in response to bth but had no effect on the response to sa . to test this possibility _PROTEIN_ plants and controls were grown on murashige and skoog plates with sa . _PROTEIN_ plants are unable to grow on these plates likely because they are unable to detoxify sa . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants behaved as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was intermediate between col and _PROTEIN_ . this observation was quantified by measuring the amount of chlorophyll per plant for three different treatments . the quantification corroborated the intermediate phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants and showed no difference in chlorophyll in mock treatments . in _PROTEIN_ in the absence of treatment there were no observable developmental phenotypes in the plants carrying any of the _PROTEIN_ alleles they were indistinguishable from col in our growth conditions . the _PROTEIN_ plants like _PROTEIN_ were also affected in sa dependent defense . for example inoculation with pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strain after sa and bth treatments induced a strong resistance in col but not in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ plants showed some residual resistance but the difference with respect to col was always considerable . _PROTEIN_ is a pathogenesis related protein used as a marker for stress in plants so we produced a _PROTEIN_ immunoblot blot of plants treated with pto or bth . in both cases strong accumulation of _PROTEIN_ was observed only in col . therefore even if sa and bth induce a small amount of resistance in _PROTEIN_ plants this resistance does not result in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . the similarities between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants extended beyond the initial characterization . when tested for enhanced disease susceptibility phenotypes _PROTEIN_ plants were at least as susceptible as _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ plants were wild type for pathogen induced systemic acquired resistance but the plants with the other two alleles like all _PROTEIN_ plants were sar defective . since this was an important difference this experiment was repeated several times always with the same result . all _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants showed similar effector triggered immune responses and responses to nonhost pathogens . only in the case of resistance to pseudomonas syringae dependent effector triggered immunity triggered by pto did we observe a _PROTEIN_ in resistance in some plants these paralleled the responses to pto . other pathogens tested included pto and plectosphaerella cucumerina . in these cases the _PROTEIN_ plants were not different from the wild type . plants with _PROTEIN_ alleles differ in their response to meja induced resistance . _PROTEIN_ plants were wild type in their response to meja and also showed a wild type phenotype on meja plates and in growth of pto . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants shared most of the phenotypes related to sa dependent defense and/or response to biotrophic pathogens . thus we addressed whether the corresponding genes act in the same pathway by constructing the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these double mutant plants showed no additional change in fresh weight in response to bth . therefore another line was constructed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ since it was the weakest allele . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants showed additive phenotypes since these plants had a stronger phenotype than plants with either weak allele alone . similar results were obtained with respect to growth of pto in response to sa and bth treatment . this additive relationship implied that the genes were independent . mechanistically this could be translated into several models . _PROTEIN_ functions in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ could affect its localization and potentially that of other proteins acting with _PROTEIN_ . the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ can be manipulated with a transgenic line that overexpresses _PROTEIN_ fused to the steroid hormone binding domain of the rat _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ . upon application of the _PROTEIN_ dexamethasone _PROTEIN_ hbd is forced to the _LOCATION_ while in mock conditions it is excluded from the _LOCATION_ . the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hbd plant did not respond to bth when dexamethasone was applied . thus the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in the presence of bth was not enough to trigger the response . an alternative explanation for these results could be that _PROTEIN_ is a chaperone required for _PROTEIN_ stability . this explanation was ruled out with the help of a line that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in control conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ . the same localization was observed in this transgenic plant in an _PROTEIN_ background . upon bth application _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ both in _PROTEIN_ wild type and in _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . therefore _PROTEIN_ was not only stable in _PROTEIN_ plants but it is also localized in the _LOCATION_ . in spite of this wild type _PROTEIN_ behavior this line did not respond to bth . thus _PROTEIN_ functions downstream of _PROTEIN_ . conventional mapping showed that _PROTEIN_ is encoded by _GENE_ a gene labeled as unknown in the arabidopsis information resource . the predicted protein contains a kix domain at the very beginning and a gln rich region in the middle . the sequences of the three alleles revealed that each allele had a single point mutation in the kix domain . the mutations were not extreme in _METHOD_ of physiochemical distances . in _PROTEIN_ the mutations introduced did not change the prediction of an alpha helix structure . therefore mutations that introduced small changes in the protein produced plants with a considerable change in phenotype . three independent t dnas insertions in _PROTEIN_ were found in the databases two of them are in introns _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the case of the third t dna we did not find any insertion . one quarter of the progeny of plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ was smaller in size and more chlorotic than the wild type while heterozygous plants were wild type . the smaller plants were confirmed to be homozygous _PROTEIN_ by pcr and they grew very slowly in comparison with wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ plants did not seem to be affected in leaf anatomy but we did observe differences in the trichomes . wild type plants had trichomes with papillae on their surface and prominent cells at their base but _PROTEIN_ plants lacked these two elements . additionally the _METHOD_ of the trichomes were different irregular and chaotically arranged . several types of staining showed no difference in cell death or callose deposition but diamidino phenylindole staining revealed differences in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and the sa response are necessary for appropriate dna content in the _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ plants having more endoreplication than the wild type . the point mutations in _PROTEIN_ produced plants with normal endoreplication using this assay but _PROTEIN_ plants had the same or more dna per cell than _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share a role in controlling endoreplication of _LOCATION_ dna . when transferred to long day conditions to induce flowering _PROTEIN_ plants bolted but did not produce any seeds . in most plants there was no production of flowers at all but in a few plants some flowers did appear . these flowers did not have stamens and the carpels did not completely enclose the ovules . the growth habit of _PROTEIN_ plants was normal until several days after bolting . then several additional _METHOD_ appeared and afterwards a next generation of _METHOD_ appeared in the previous _METHOD_ in a pattern similar to a fractal . some plants kept growing up to weeks and when they died they did not seem to be following the normal program of senescence . the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants were reproduced by _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants . similarly the ratio of wild type versus no response to bth was in all cases of from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and any of the plants that were homozygous for an _METHOD_ allele while the plants with _METHOD_ alleles and the nulls were fully recessive . between heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants had a ratio of wild type versus no response to bth of . therefore the phenotypes observed in plants with the alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were caused only by the insertions of the t dnas in the _PROTEIN_ gene and one copy of the missense mutation was enough to complement the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants besides the response to bth . the _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants were easily distinguished at or weeks and some experiments could be performed or _PROTEIN_ to this _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ plants did not perceive bth either in _METHOD_ of fresh weight or pto growth . the levels of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ plants after inoculation with pto indicated that these lines were more susceptible than any other genotype but perhaps the growth of pto was already reaching a maximum . this extra susceptibility could be quantified with a weak pathogen p. syringae pv maculicola . thus p. syringae pv maculicola was unable to grow in col _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but grew two log units in _PROTEIN_ plants . since plants with _PROTEIN_ had an extreme susceptibility to pathogens we wondered if they had also an extreme phenotype with sa . the responses to sa/bth of the plants with null alleles were similar to the plants with _METHOD_ alleles so we searched for another phenotype . sa content was considered a promising one since it increases in plants under biotic stress like pto inoculation but it is also increased in _PROTEIN_ plants with respect to the wild type . _PROTEIN_ plants behaved like _PROTEIN_ accumulating roughly the same sa amounts as the wild type in control conditions and more than the wild type after pto inoculation . _PROTEIN_ plants behaved differently accumulating sa in both free and total form in control conditions . upon pto inoculation levels of both _METHOD_ of sa were strongly increased . it was possible to identify _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants in vitro and to test their growth on plates with sa . growth of these plants was severely affected on sa plates while heterozygous or wild type siblings were largely unaffected by sa . _PROTEIN_ was coimmunoprecipitated in arabidopsis with _PROTEIN_ a subunit of the mediator complex . due to its homology to subunits of mediator in other species it was labeled and an in silico search _METHOD_ that it is one of the three loci in arabidopsis . however the role of in plants may be divided among these three genes since the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in yeast lacking a functional _PROTEIN_ did not complement the mutant phenotypes . belongs to the tail module of the mediator a module that interacts with specific transcription _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ is a subunit of the mediator complex and the mediator complex is critical for global regulation of transcription it seemed logical to test the behavior of other mediator subunits in the sa response . the arabidopsis genome encodes additional potential mediator complex encoding genes and we tested the plants with t dnas insertions available . six genes had no insertion had one or more heterozygous insertions and had one or more homozygous insertions . these populations were tested in the same conditions that allowed the identification of _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants yet none of them produced a phenotype different from the wild type control . therefore the role of _PROTEIN_ in the sa response was unique among the mediator subunits . the additional phenotypes of the plants with null alleles compared with the _METHOD_ alleles of _PROTEIN_ were striking but they did not point to any obvious process that was altered besides the sa response . a transcriptomic analysis was performed in _PROTEIN_ plants to identify possible physiological processes affected by the null mutation . thus rnas from three biological replicates of _PROTEIN_ plants and col week old plants plus _PROTEIN_ of the same size were isolated and hybridized to a commercial oligonucleotide microarray . interestingly the molecular footprints of the two _PROTEIN_ plants were quite different . _PROTEIN_ plants had a very small impact on transcription with eight genes significantly downregulated and only one upregulated . by contrast _PROTEIN_ plants had genes significantly downregulated and upregulated . among the genes upregulated there were genes related to sa biosynthesis and to defense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ although the levels of induction of the defense genes were quite low in comparison to pathogen inoculation of wild type plants . this induction though significant was not strong enough to detect _PROTEIN_ protein by immunoblot . the software package mapman is able to identify groups of genes that are altered in one situation with respect to the control . in the case of _PROTEIN_ plants there were only two _PROTEIN_ groups strongly altered but in _PROTEIN_ there were up to _PROTEIN_ groups strongly altered thus reflecting the severity of the pleiotropic phenotype of the mutant plants . in spite of the _PROTEIN_ groups suggested by these and other analyses there was no evidence of specific processes being altered other than sa and defense . using the global footprint of the transcriptome we searched for other mutants or treatments that could give us any hint about other processes regulated by _PROTEIN_ . atcast is a software package that enables the identification of unknown relations among experiments to uncover the underlying biological relationships and with the default settings atcast indicated a weak correlation of the _PROTEIN_ transcriptome with the transcriptome of plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to put these correlations into perspective several transcriptomic experiments were clustered with cluster along the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcriptome and visualized with javatreeview . _PROTEIN_ data were closer to both _PROTEIN_ and nahg two mutations that produced a _PROTEIN_ in defense but _PROTEIN_ data were closer to the treatments that induced defenses and to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression . the correlations with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants although not very strong might indicate altered cytokinin signaling in _PROTEIN_ plants . when the _PROTEIN_ plants were grown in presence of trans zeatin there were no phenotypes of cytokinin insensitivity so even if the overexpression of genes involved in cytokinin signaling produced the data closest to _PROTEIN_ there was no visible cytokinin related phenotype caused by the _PROTEIN_ alleles . the application of high amounts of cytokinins has been reported to induce sa biosynthesis and therefore defenses . there is also a negative regulation of cytokinins by sa which may help to fine tune the amplitude of the defense output . we did not detect any difference between the plants with _METHOD_ alleles of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type in this _PROTEIN_ nor did the _PROTEIN_ plants show cytokinin related phenotypes . therefore there was no evidence for a role of _PROTEIN_ in cytokinin response or in any other specific process besides the sa response . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is apparently unaltered by stimuli covered in the available microarray data . we confirmed this using quantitative rt pcr to measure the levels of _PROTEIN_ after several treatments including pto inoculation and chemical treatments . there was a reproducible increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after several treatments but even in the best conditions it was quite low . we did not detect any interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid assays _PROTEIN_ of the presence of sa in the media . the _METHOD_ alleles did not produce a measurable instability in the mutated mrna but the _PROTEIN_ mutation rendered the mrna below the threshold of detection . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was unaltered in _PROTEIN_ plants and _PROTEIN_ was detectable in _PROTEIN_ at normal levels . although the mediator complex is described to act in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ did not contain any obvious _LOCATION_ localization signal . to determine the localization of the protein we transiently overexpressed the _PROTEIN_ cdna fused to the _METHOD_ coding sequence at the or terminus in nicotiana benthamiana . in both cases there was a strong localization in the _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulating also outside the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization did not change with the application of bth . the predicted size of _PROTEIN_ was kd well above the free diffusion limit into the _LOCATION_ of kd . these constructs were transformed into _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis none of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutants but the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants complemented the _METHOD_ alleles with some variation when the response to bth in _METHOD_ of fresh weight was considered . this variation was representative of the transgenic lines obtained _PROTEIN_ of the background . a version of _PROTEIN_ containing the first amino acids was also able to complement the mutations in some lines but the version of _PROTEIN_ containing only the first amino acids did not . in the complemented lines _METHOD_ was not detectable by means of confocal microscopy or immunoblot . however since there was detectable function we also transformed the wild type col to study the effects of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . in this experiment _PROTEIN_ was included as a control since it is more sensitive to sa . the transgenic lines that overexpressed both versions of _PROTEIN_ had an enhanced sa response as measured by fresh weight after bth applications . we additionally complemented the wild type restriction of pto growth after sa or bth application using these lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . note that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ did not produce a strong defense response under control conditions but when sa or bth was applied there was an enhanced response to sa . therefore the effect of _PROTEIN_ was specific and limited to sa response .
