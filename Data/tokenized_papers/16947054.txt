mrna _PROTEIN_ is transiently salinity and dehydration stress responsive . the enzyme also undergoes dynamic subcellular localization changes in response to these same stresses . using the yeast two hybrid system we have isolated and characterized a m. crystallinum _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ . we show that interacts with the c terminal coiled coil containing region of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system . this interaction was confirmed in vitro between the purified recombinant _METHOD_ of each of the proteins and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation experiments from plant extracts . _PROTEIN_ however was not a substrate for . computational threading analysis suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a member of a novel family of proteins with unknown function also found in rice and arabidopsis . these proteins contain coiled coil spectrin repeat domains present in the syntaxin superfamily that participate in vesicular and protein trafficking . consistent with the interaction data subcellular localization and fractionation studies showed that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with to vesicular structures located on the actin _LOCATION_ and within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in cells subjected to low humidity stress . _PROTEIN_ also colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis v snare _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ present in the trans _LOCATION_ network and prevacuolar compartments . both interaction and subcellular localization studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ may possibly serve as an _PROTEIN_ protein responsible for vesicle mediated trafficking of to or from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ along actin microfilaments of the _LOCATION_ .
the yeast strain was used to perform yeast two hybrid screens to isolate interacting proteins . this particular strain contains three different reporter constructs that are all driven by different promoters which eliminates many of the false positives commonly obtained in two hybrid screens . the constitutively active bait was used to screen a cdna library constructed from mrna isolated from salt stressed ice plant leaves . five million co transformants were screened . positively interacting clones of _PROTEIN_ were isolated and then tested with the five different bait constructs . the pattern of interaction produced on plates lacking leucine tryptophan and adenine was similar to that produced on plates lacking leucine tryptophan and histidine . _PROTEIN_ interacted positively with the kinase domain full length minus n terminal variable domain and the full length constructs . positive interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the variable plus kinase domain construct however was only observed on plates lacking adenine . all bait constructs failed to autoactivate the adenine nutritional reporter . we have previously reported that the mrna _PROTEIN_ is transiently induced by salinity and water deficit stress . to test whether the application of the same stresses would affect the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we performed semi quantitative rt pcr on mrna extracted from detached leaves that were subjected to these same conditions . unlike however _PROTEIN_ steady state transcripts did not change in abundance following dehydration and high salinity stress . as a control the transcript abundance of _PROTEIN_ was monitored using the same rna samples and remained unchanged following stress consistent with earlier observations . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were approximately fold more abundant than _PROTEIN_ transcripts . the complete _PROTEIN_ cdna encodes a predicted polypeptide consisting of amino acid residues . blast searches showed that _PROTEIN_ is related to an unknown protein from rice with amino acid sequence identity and a small family of three unknown arabidopsis proteins with a amino acid sequence identity . the most notable sequence conservation among these proteins is at their c termini . interpro scan searches failed to suggest a possible function for _PROTEIN_ . however using the heterologous rice protein and the more distantly heterologous arabidopsis protein as queries revealed that these proteins are related to a superfamily of v snare proteins which includes the syntaxins . syntaxins mediate the interaction of transport vesicles and their target _LOCATION_ in diverse vesicular transport processes along the exocytic and endocytic pathways in various endomembrane _METHOD_ . we next used the protein homology/analogy recognition engine threading algorithm which is an updated version of its predecessor the pssm algorithm to assess whether _PROTEIN_ has the potential to adopt a known three dimensional structure . this approach is capable of revealing structural similarities that are otherwise not obvious through conventional sequence based methods . pssm analysis showed that the c terminus region of _PROTEIN_ is related to a spectrin beta chain repeat protein domain although no significant amino acid homologies were apparent . the spectrin repeat domain which _METHOD_ coiled coil structures is reported to be involved in vesicle and protein transport . to test whether _PROTEIN_ has this motif coiled coil motif searches were performed using and multicoil software . multicoil and predict whether proteins are likely to have dimeric coiled coils whereas multicoil alone predicts the occurrence of trimeric coiled coils . both _METHOD_ predicted that _PROTEIN_ contains this motif at its n and c termini . finally the wolf protein subcellular localization prediction software was used to find potential cellular locations of _PROTEIN_ and its four heterologous proteins . results showed that all _PROTEIN_ related proteins were predicted to have _LOCATION_ localization . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ was predicted to have a peroxisomal destination based on the presence of a canonical peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ targeting sequence _PROTEIN_ element . _PROTEIN_ elements which are usually located within residues of the first amino acid of a protein are amino acids long and in most cases are cleaved during or shortly after translocation . however the _PROTEIN_ site within _PROTEIN_ was located between amino acids and and not at the n terminus suggesting that this signal might not be in a position to be recognized by the appropriate receptor and therefore it is unlikely that _PROTEIN_ localizes to _LOCATION_ . because _PROTEIN_ was predicted to have two coiled coil motifs at its n and c termini we employed the yeast two hybrid system to map the domain of _PROTEIN_ with which putatively interacts . full length was used as bait to test five different domains of _PROTEIN_ as prey . prey and bait constructs were cotransformed into the yeast host strain and plated on a medium lacking leucine and tryptophan to screen for yeast cells harboring both plasmids . to screen for interaction the same yeast cells were plated on a medium lacking adenine leucine and tryptophan or histidine leucine and tryptophan containing _PROTEIN_ . results show that only domain which includes the c terminal coiled coil domain retained partial binding with the . the adenine reporter/selection system produced the least background growth of the various reporters with this host strain . to confirm that full length _PROTEIN_ interacts with we performed an in vitro interaction assay . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a positive control _PROTEIN_ a bona fide interactor and substrate of were bound to glutathione agarose . his fusion protein was then added to the resin bound proteins separately in the presence of calcium . the entire interaction complex was resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ electroblotted onto a pvdf _LOCATION_ and the proteins were detected by western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody against the his tag . results show that his specifically associates with agarose beads containing either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the his fusion protein failed to bind to agarose beads containing _PROTEIN_ alone . to determine if _PROTEIN_ interacts with in vivo we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and his fusions under the control of camv promoter in leaves of stressed plants grown at relative humidity using a microprojectile bombardment based transient transfection system . after h of _PROTEIN_ epidermal peels of leaves _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were homogenized their soluble proteins extracted and subjected to immunoprecipitation either with or without anti his antibodies . the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was then determined by western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibodies . no band was detected when the anti his antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation experiment . a band corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected as a co immunoprecipitated product and also in the epidermal crude extract from bombarded leaves overexpressing both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and his confirming _PROTEIN_ of the former protein . _METHOD_ alone did not co immunoprecipitate with his thus confirming the latter s interaction with _PROTEIN_ and not with its fused _METHOD_ . these results corroborate our previous observations and suggest that _PROTEIN_ and interact in vivo . in vitro kinase assays were conducted to determine if _PROTEIN_ was a substrate . exhibited calcium dependent autophosphorylation activity and phosphorylated the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ a bona fide substrate for but failed to phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ even in the presence of calcium . this data suggests that _PROTEIN_ is not a substrate for . we have previously shown that _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and actin microfilaments in cells from stressed plants exposed to low humidity whereas it is present solely in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in cells from plants exposed to high humidity . to determine if and _PROTEIN_ colocalize in vivo we first compared localization patterns in plants grown under high relative humidity conditions . in these plants localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ localized to vesicle like structures . the same experiment was then performed on plants subjected to relative humidity . in these plants _PROTEIN_ localization remained unchanged compared to that under unstressed conditions . however and _PROTEIN_ exhibited colocalization to vesicular and actin microfilament structures as well as the _LOCATION_ but not the _LOCATION_ . this result is consistent with the in vitro and in vivo interaction data obtained for and _PROTEIN_ . to improve our identification of the subcellular structures to which _PROTEIN_ localizes we co bombarded _PROTEIN_ dsred fusions with the microfilament marker talin _METHOD_ . red _METHOD_ vesicles colocalized with the green _METHOD_ microfilaments . because microfilaments are known to be tightly associated with the _LOCATION_ we observed whether _PROTEIN_ also localizes to this endomembrane by testing the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ dsred with the _LOCATION_ marker bip _METHOD_ . results suggest that the vesicles to which _PROTEIN_ localize are also associated with the _LOCATION_ . to test if _PROTEIN_ localized to _LOCATION_ as suggested by psort predictions we cobombarded _PROTEIN_ dsred and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a modified _METHOD_ that is targeted to _LOCATION_ by the addition of the c terminal sequence _PROTEIN_ . green labeled peroxisomal vesicles moved rapidly in the cell in contrast to the red _METHOD_ vesicles of _PROTEIN_ dsred thus indicating no colocalization with the _LOCATION_ . to further corroborate the observation that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with at the actin microfilaments and the _LOCATION_ we surveyed the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ using subcellular fractionation and western blotting . _PROTEIN_ constructs coding for his _PROTEIN_ dha fusions and the peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were introduced via microprojectile bombardment into the leaf tissue of plants subjected to relative humidity . the leaves were allowed to _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins for h after which time the total proteins from epidermal tissues were extracted by tissue homogenization in the presence of either edta or and subsequently fractionated on a continuous sucrose gradient . protein fractions were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by western blotting . in the presence of edta the fractionation pattern of _PROTEIN_ dha detected by probing with anti ha antibodies and his detected with anti his antibodies were similar to each other as well as to the _LOCATION_ localized bip protein detected by anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . in the presence of the detection of _PROTEIN_ and bip shifted to higher density fractions a phenomenon typically observed for _LOCATION_ proteins . however probing the different fractions with anti _METHOD_ antibodies to detect _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ show that the peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ protein was detected in fractions . this fractionation pattern is distinct from that obtained for _PROTEIN_ as well as bip and in contrast with the gradient shift observed for these proteins the fraction position in which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected did not change in the presence or absence of . these results are consistent with _PROTEIN_ dsred s previously observed localization to the _LOCATION_ microfilaments and associated vesicular structures but not with _LOCATION_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ does not localize to the _LOCATION_ we cobombarded constructs for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ dha fusions into the leaf tissue of plants subjected to relative humidity . western blot analysis on total proteins isolated from the _LOCATION_ show the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _PROTEIN_ dha although both fusions are _PROTEIN_ in the bombarded leaf area . control antibody reactions with crude extracts from untransfected and transfected leaves confirm that the antibody signals were not derived from cross reactivity with endogenous proteins . to better identify the vesicular structures with which _PROTEIN_ localizes we co bombarded _PROTEIN_ dsred with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a v snare known to localize to the tgn and pvcs . the _PROTEIN_ dsred fusion colocalized with the green _METHOD_ vesicles . based on these results _PROTEIN_ might be part of the complex intracellular transport machinery involving the interaction of v snares on transport vesicles with t snares on target _LOCATION_ within various endomembrane _METHOD_ .
