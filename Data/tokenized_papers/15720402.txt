in several _METHOD_ desulfhydrase activity was measured this enzyme decomposes into pyruvate and . a gene encoding a putative protein was identified in arabidopsis thaliana heynh . based on high homology to an escherichia coli protein called yedo that has activity . the deduced arabidopsis protein consists of amino acids and has a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . it contains a binding site . the purified recombinant mature protein had a km for of mm . only but not was converted by to pyruvate and . the activity was inhibited by aminooxy acetic acid and hydroxylamine inhibitors specific for dependent proteins at low micromolar concentrations . the protein did not exhibit deaminase activity as homologous bacterial proteins . western blot analysis of isolated organelles and localization studies using fusion constructs with the green _METHOD_ protein indicated an intracellular localization of the _LOCATION_ encoded protein in the mitochondria . rna levels increased with proceeding development of arabidopsis but _PROTEIN_ in senescent plants protein levels remained almost unchanged in the same plants whereas specific activity was highest in senescent plants . in plants grown in a dark rhythm rna levels were highest in the dark whereas protein levels and enzyme activity were lower in the dark period than in the light indicating regulation . plants grown under low sulfate concentration showed an accumulation of rna and increased protein levels the activity was almost unchanged . putative in vivo functions of the protein are discussed .
