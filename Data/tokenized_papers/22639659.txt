myo inositol is a precursor for cell wall components is used as a backbone of myo inositol trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol phosphate signaling molecules and is debated about whether it is also a precursor in an alternate ascorbic acid synthesis pathway . plants control inositol homeostasis by regulation of key enzymes involved in myo inositol synthesis and catabolism . recent transcriptional profiling data indicate up regulation of the myo inositol oxygenase genes under conditions in which energy or nutrients are limited . to test whether the miox genes are required for responses to low energy we first examined _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ regulation by energy/nutrient conditions . we found that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are suppressed by exogenous _PROTEIN_ addition in the shoot but not in the root . both genes were abundantly _PROTEIN_ during low energy/nutrient conditions . loss of function mutants in miox genes contain alterations in myo inositol levels and growth changes in the root . _PROTEIN_ mutants can be complemented with a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion . further we show here that _PROTEIN_ is a cytoplasmic protein while _PROTEIN_ is present mostly in the cytoplasm but also occasionally in the _LOCATION_ . together these data suggest that miox catabolism in the shoot may influence root growth responses during low energy/nutrient conditions .
to examine the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ within tissues we examined previously characterized _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus lines _PROTEIN_ . we focused on the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes as published work has indicated a role for these genes in seedlings _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ is not abundantly _PROTEIN_ at any stage and _PROTEIN_ is restricted to flowers _PROTEIN_ . multiple lines of _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus seedlings were grown on no nutrients low nutrients _METHOD_ and optimal nutrients _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in low light for days . we found that _PROTEIN_ is abundantly _PROTEIN_ under the no nutrient conditions with intense staining found in the cotyledons hypocotyl and root . in contrast with no nutrients present there is no obvious staining in the _PROTEIN_ gus seedlings . under the low nutrient condition the intensity of _PROTEIN_ gus staining _PROTEIN_ with moderate _PROTEIN_ present in the cotyledons and root . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also present in cotyledons and roots in the low nutrient condition although overall there is less _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as compared to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in low nutrients . as expected from previous microarray profiling _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are greatly reduced when seedlings are grown with exogenous _PROTEIN_ . our use of the gus reporter however reveals that repression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by sugar is restricted to shoot tissues with portions of the roots still _PROTEIN_ both genes . specifically in _PROTEIN_ treated seedlings large areas of both _PROTEIN_ and the primary roots including the root tip retain _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ becomes restricted to the primary root tip in _PROTEIN_ treated seedlings . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ represses _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoot tissues of seedlings while areas of root tissues _PROTEIN_ miox _PROTEIN_ . these results are intriguing given that it has been speculated by others that myo inositol translocation from the shoot to the root via the phloem provides information on the shoot photosynthetic status to the root _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ varies with nutrient conditions . wt _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus to day seedlings were grown on no nutrient low nutrient or optimal nutrient conditions and gus activity was examined . pictures are representative of staining patterns observed in seedlings for each condition . wt samples showed no staining . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ impact sugar sensing we isolated t dna insertion mutants for these genes from the salk collection _PROTEIN_ obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by pcr using a t dna left border primer and gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this resulted resulting in the amplification of an bp fragment in _PROTEIN_ mutants . sequencing of the amplified fragment showed that the t dna insertion is at the border of the fifth intron and sixth exon . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by pcr using a t dna lb primer and _PROTEIN_ gene specific primers resulting in the amplification of a bp fragment in _PROTEIN_ mutants . sequencing of the amplified fragment showed that the t dna insertion was in the third intron for _PROTEIN_ . characterization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants . . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene maps showing locations of t dna insertions . black boxes represent exons black lines represent introns . lb t dna left border _PROTEIN_ t dna right border . arrows indicate primers . relative transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings as determined by quantitative pcr . primer sequences can be found in the table _PROTEIN_ in appendix . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is altered in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant lines we examined rna levels using quantitative pcr . we used rna isolated from seedlings grown under low nutrient conditions and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene specific primers to determine relative levels of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is fold higher than _PROTEIN_ in wt seedlings . we found almost no detectable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ mutants had elevated _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ indicating the possibility that _PROTEIN_ mutants up regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to compensate for loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mutants have a large reduction in _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and a smaller reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we also used semi quantitative pcr to examine _PROTEIN_ of both genes in leaves and flowers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . using this approach we found no detectable _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ leaves and reduced amounts of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ flowers as compared to wt . a second _PROTEIN_ allele named _PROTEIN_ containing a t dna insertion was also examined in our studies . as this mutant line had no reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings we do not include data for this mutant here . from these analyses we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are suitable for examining the consequences of eliminating or reducing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ are required for growth under various nutrient conditions we measured root lengths of wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown with no low and optimal nutrients over a period of days . we also included a _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ a camv promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene as a control for complementation _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein as measured by western blotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . root growth in different nutrient conditions . wt and mutant seeds were surface sterilized placed on agar with different nutrients stratified for days at then placed at room temperature under long day conditions . root length was measured every other day . no nutrients . low nutrients . optimal nutrients . bars represent the mean _PROTEIN_ where n with each replicate containing seedlings . indicates p value as compared to wt . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transgenic seedlings . denatured protein extracts from seedlings were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with either an anti _METHOD_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . recall that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highest in shoots and roots of seedlings grown with no nutrients . under these no nutrient conditions a trend for increased _PROTEIN_ mutant root growth as compared to wt over days is apparent . the increase in root growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants is statistically significant at day and at day . _PROTEIN_ root growth is similar to _PROTEIN_ root growth on day but does not differ from wt on day and day . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct complements the _PROTEIN_ mutant under these conditions . when grown under the low nutrients condition for days _PROTEIN_ roots grow longer than wt roots while _PROTEIN_ root growth appears to be more like wt root growth . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ mutants are grown on optimal nutrients a condition in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ becomes restricted to roots alone there are no differences in root growth between _PROTEIN_ mutants wt and _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is required for proper control of root growth in varying nutrient conditions . further these data suggest that under no or low nutrients _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the shoot is required to limit root growth . the data from _PROTEIN_ mutants also reveal a role for _PROTEIN_ in regulating root growth . we observed a trend for _PROTEIN_ root growth in _PROTEIN_ mutants as compared to wt roots grown with no nutrients . the _PROTEIN_ in root growth in _PROTEIN_ mutants was statistically significant at day and day . in contrast when grown on low nutrients _PROTEIN_ root growth was increased as compared to wt roots at all measured time points . this shift in growth suppression with no nutrients versus growth stimulation with low nutrients correlates with the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wt seedlings grown in these conditions . under optimal nutrient conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants have reduced root growth as compared to wt roots at day and day but no changes in root growth at _PROTEIN_ time points . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ gene is also required for proper control of root growth in varying nutrient conditions and that _PROTEIN_ may play a similar role as _PROTEIN_ in limiting root growth under low nutrient conditions . further the growth limiting role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in low nutrient conditions is correlated with miox _PROTEIN_ in the shoot suggesting that shoot miox oxidation of myo inositol may provide a signal for root growth regulation . alterations in nutrient status are known to impact time to flowering . while under standard laboratory conditions we noted no differences in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant growth and development we did find alterations in time to flowering . examination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves prior to inflorescence emergence indicated that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in soil grown plants at this stage . in particular _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in younger leaves hydathodes and _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ only in leaf _PROTEIN_ . overall the amount of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at this stage is much less than at the seedling stage and neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ was abundant in fully expanded rosette leaves . remarkably the small amount of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoot apices at this stage impacts time to flowering in opposite ways . under long day conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants flower _PROTEIN_ with an average of more leaves required to initiate flowering . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mutants flower early with an average of to less leaves upon flowering . we conclude that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are required to _PROTEIN_ time to flowering and the genes have opposing roles that correspond to different patterns of _PROTEIN_ at this stage . comparison of miox mutants in flowering time . wt _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus tissues were examined for gus activity . pictures are representative of staining patterns observed in samples . wt samples showed no staining . wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were sown on pre wetted soil stratified at for days and then placed in a growth chamber under long day conditions . the number of rosette leaves prior to flowering were counted . values represent the mean _PROTEIN_ where n plants . indicates p value as compared to wt . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also _PROTEIN_ in developing and mature flowers . both genes are _PROTEIN_ in male and female organs however _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all whorls _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ is only detectable in the inner two whorls . to determine how inositol metabolism is affected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants we quantified the miox substrate inositol and its product dglca in various tissues from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . as controls for this work we included transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a wt copy of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ gene driven by the camv promoter . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants accumulated miox _METHOD_ protein as measured by western blotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody and an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . reactivity with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody made against a recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein was stronger for _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . to measure inositol and dglca we grew wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants in soil and harvested leaves flowers and siliques . in addition we grew seedlings from these lines on low nutrients and harvested tissues from these samples . tissues were prepared for gc analyses using both conventional gc and gc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . standard curves for each metabolite were generated using commercially available standards . peaks within _METHOD_ were identified by comparison to the retention times of standards and by parallel gc _METHOD_ analysis . peak areas were quantified from _METHOD_ and normalized to the amount of sample material and internal standards . we found that _PROTEIN_ mutants contain significantly elevated inositol levels in seedlings leaves and flowers . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings leaves flowers and siliques all contain significantly reduced inositol levels suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants are metabolically similar to a gain of function in _PROTEIN_ . overall these data are consistent with reduced inositol oxidation in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings leaves and flowers and increased inositol oxidation in all tissues from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . metabolite levels in wt miox mutant and miox _METHOD_ tissues . seedlings were grown under low nutrient conditions while leaves flowers and siliques were harvested from soil grown plants . tissues were harvested ground in liquid nitrogen extracted reduced derivatized and analyzed by gc . amounts are given in microgram per gram fresh tissue . top panels are myo inositol bottom panels are dglca . bars represent the mean sd where n independent biological replicates with each seedling replicate containing hundreds of day old low nutrient grown seedlings each leaf replicate containing three to five week old leaves each flower replicate containing open flowers and each silique replicate containing green elongated siliques . indicates p value as compared to wt . despite the changes seen in inositol in most _PROTEIN_ tissues there are no changes in dglca levels in any _PROTEIN_ tissues examined . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tissues only have alterations in dglca levels in siliques where both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants have statistically significant elevations . we conclude that the growth increase in _PROTEIN_ mutant roots in the low nutrients condition is accompanied by elevated inositol levels suggesting that _PROTEIN_ oxidation of inositol plays a role in regulating seedling root growth when energy is limited . the loss of the _PROTEIN_ gene impacts inositol levels less dramatically than does loss of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ seedlings and flowers have a small increase in inositol while _PROTEIN_ siliques have a small _PROTEIN_ in inositol . the only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tissue with altered inositol is flowers with a small elevation in inositol apparent . there are no changes in dglca in _PROTEIN_ tissues . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ siliques contain elevated dglca with other tissues from these plants having no changes in dglca . to determine the site of inositol oxidation by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we examined the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings grown in the low nutrients condition . as these plants have _PROTEIN_ inositol levels this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is catalytically active thus it is likely that this fusion protein undergoes the same post translational modifications and subcellular localization as the native _PROTEIN_ protein . we analyzed progeny from two independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines with _METHOD_ deconvolution microscopy and found a similar pattern of location in both lines . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with the cytoplasm in all cells within the cotyledon epidermis hypocotyls seedling roots . to confirm the cytoplasmic localization we treated the seedlings with m nacl to plasmolyze the cells causing the cytoplasm to retract from the cell wall . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is located in the cytoplasm in seedlings . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged miox in arabidopsis seedlings . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and wt backgrounds respectively and imaged with _METHOD_ deconvolution microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedling _PROTEIN_ in cotyledon epidermis hypocotyl plasmolyzed roots treated with m nacl arrows denote plasmolyed cells . was taken with dic optics . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledon epidermis and root tips . bar . to investigate the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein we examined the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic seedlings grown in the low nutrients condition . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with the cytoplasm in cells in the cotyledon epidermis and root tips . to confirm the cytoplasmic localization we plasmolyzed cells with m nacl and found _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . in addition to its cytoplasmic location however small amounts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also located in _LOCATION_ from some but not all root tip cells . to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we stained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings with the _LOCATION_ dye diamidino phenylindole and imaged _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ simultaneously . in the region examined approximately of root _LOCATION_ exhibiting dapi _METHOD_ also had _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the cytoplasm and also within some root _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings .
