this study characterizes the phosphorylated pathway of ser biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana by targeting phosphoserine phosphatase _PROTEIN_ the last enzyme of the pathway . lack of _PROTEIN_ activity delayed embryo development leading to aborted embryos that could be classified as early curled cotyledons . the embryo lethal phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants could be complemented with _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of _PROTEIN_ . however this construct which was poorly _PROTEIN_ in the anther tapetum did not complement mutant fertility . microspore development in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arrested at the _PROTEIN_ stage . the tapetum from these lines displayed delayed and irregular development . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the tapetum at critical stages of microspore development suggests that _PROTEIN_ activity in this cell layer is essential in pollen development . in addition to embryo death and male sterility conditional _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a short root phenotype which was reverted in the presence of ser . a metabolomic study demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ plays a crucial role in plant metabolism by affecting glycolysis the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the biosynthesis of amino acids . we provide evidence of the crucial role of the _PROTEIN_ in embryo pollen and root development and suggest that this pathway is an important link connecting primary metabolism with development .
in the arabidopsis information resource database we found a single gene coding for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this gene was previously cloned and the encoded protein possesses in vitro _PROTEIN_ activity . however an exhaustive study of its _PROTEIN_ pattern which could give clues about its functions was lacking . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ promoter using the promomer tool revealed that the promoter regions were significantly enriched in consensus sequences present in important genes regulating anther development such as the floral homeotic genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . an in silico analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ based on microarray databases _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed a constitutive pattern of _PROTEIN_ through the _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis development stages . at the organ level _PROTEIN_ displayed a high _PROTEIN_ level in hypocotyls early stages of root flower seed and embryo development and in shoot apices . we assessed the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . at both seedling and adult stages _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs studied and no significant differences in _PROTEIN_ between organs were found . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was studied under different growth conditions an h exposure to darkness induced the gene _PROTEIN_ in the aerial parts but not in roots whereas longer exposures repressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on both roots and aerial parts . ser the product of _PROTEIN_ activity did not repress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the light but repressed it after h exposure to darkness in aerial parts . analysis of promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all organs studied but it displayed a highly specific cell tissue pattern . at the seedling stage _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative apex veins the distal zone of cotyledons and in stomata . in roots _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the transition zone between roots and shoots along the root vasculature in the proximal part of the _METHOD_ and in the root cap columella . at the adult stage _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all organs studied but once again a very specific cell tissue pattern was observed . in flowers gus activity was associated _PROTEIN_ with anthers stigma and pollen grains . in leaves _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the distal zone and veins . to further confirm and extend the analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern we stably _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein fusion construct under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ corroborated the cell tissue specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in the roots and reproductive organs . in seedling roots _PROTEIN_ was clearly _PROTEIN_ in the entire meristematic zone . in flowers _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in pollen anthers and carpels . in _PROTEIN_ developmental stages _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in silique valves and seeds especially in embryos . using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct citation demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ was localized in _LOCATION_ . our results employing the native _PROTEIN_ promoter for intracellular visualization of _PROTEIN_ corroborated that it is localized in both chloroplasts and nongreen _LOCATION_ in leaves . in roots _PROTEIN_ also displayed a _LOCATION_ localization . similar results were obtained when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . in order to shed light on the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis a reverse genetic approach was followed . two independent t dna insertion mutant lines affecting _PROTEIN_ were identified in the mutant collections _PROTEIN_ but only the salk line could be reconfirmed . this line was named _PROTEIN_ . the presence and genomic location of the t dna insertion was verified by pcr amplification of genomic dna and by sequencing of the pcr products . the t dna insertion was localized in the fourth intron nucleotides downstream of the start codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . genotyping plants from the original seed stock identified only wild type _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ individuals with no visual phenotype seen . an analysis of the segregation of the mutant _PROTEIN_ allele was conducted in a population of seeds obtained from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . no homozygous individuals _PROTEIN_ could be rescued based on pcr genotyping . the segregation analysis of the population displayed a ratio _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is typical of a mendelian segregation with a lethal phenotype for _PROTEIN_ individuals . to corroborate these results a second segregation analysis was conducted based on the kanamycin resistance conferred by the t dna insertion in the mutant allele . of seedlings produced from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were kanamycin resistant and were kanamycin sensitive . these results do not match the expected resistant individuals for viable _PROTEIN_ mutants . on the contrary the observed results match a segregation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating a lethal phenotype associated with the mutant _PROTEIN_ allele . _PROTEIN_ plants were visually indistinguishable from the wild type indicating the recessive nature of the mutant allele . further evidence for the role of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by analyzing point mutations in _PROTEIN_ alleles which were identified by the seattle arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ project . a new _PROTEIN_ allele was identified _PROTEIN_ which resulted in the substitution of ser for phe . according to sift software analysis this mutation is predicted to affect protein functions . specifically the ser phe mutation with the highest position specific scoring _PROTEIN_ score of all the putative mutants identified is situated in the _PROTEIN_ conserved active site at an essential position for catalytic activity suggesting that it could be lethal . in a population of individuals coming from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mother plants no homozygous _PROTEIN_ could be identified by genotyping . once again the segregation analysis matched a ratio _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ corroborating the essential role of _PROTEIN_ in early arabidopsis developmental stages . to investigate whether the lethality associated with _PROTEIN_ mutations is due to the male gametophyte female gametophyte or embryo defects reciprocal outcrosses of _PROTEIN_ plants as male/female parent and the wild type as female/male parent were performed and the segregation of the mutant allele was studied based on the antibiotic resistance conferred by the t dna insertion . the results indicate that the male and female mutant gametophytes were transmitted with an efficiency of and respectively which provides evidence that _PROTEIN_ triggers an embryo lethal phenotype . to further confirm this siliques from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were dissected at different developmental stages . from d after pollination we observed a population of abnormal seeds which was randomly distributed along the length of the silique . at dap mutant seeds were white and started to deflate . at dap mutant seeds turned dark brown and were completely deflated . segregation analysis of a population of seeds obtained from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants revealed a ratio . this ratio agrees with the expected ratio for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ calculated according to the transmission efficiency for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . to characterize the nature of the seed nonviability we examined the embryos in developing siliques of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . at dap all the embryos examined reached a similar developmental stage . however at dap some of the embryos showed delayed development . according to microarray databases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is maximal at the globular stage . the developmentally delayed embryos could be assigned to mutant seeds at dap and dap . the terminal aborted embryos were albino and could be classified as early curled cotyledons according to the seedgenes database . pcr based genotyping analysis revealed that the aborted embryos were _PROTEIN_ individuals . in order to corroborate the phenotype genotype correlation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation we transformed _PROTEIN_ plants with the construct propsp _PROTEIN_ . we were able to demonstrate complementation of the embryo lethal phenotype of _PROTEIN_ individuals by obtaining homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants in the segregating population . in the adult stage transgenic _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ plants were fertile and visually indistinguishable from the wild type . however when _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cdna under the control of the promoter _PROTEIN_ the resulting homozygous _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines in the segregating population were sterile producing small siliques with no seeds . a _PROTEIN_ overdose effect was not the cause of the observed sterility phenotype since the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fertile . as the promoter exhibits very low _PROTEIN_ or none in the arabidopsis tapetum we performed an ontogenic serial analysis of anther and pollen development from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ plants . for that purpose floral buds were classified from stages to according to the landmark events described by citation and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anthers tetrads of microspores were formed and progressed in their development till the _PROTEIN_ microspore stage . these initial steps of microspore development in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were similar to those observed in the wild type . however after the _PROTEIN_ microspore stage _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ microspores initiated a degeneration process characterized by detachment of microspore protoplasm from the cell wall . at the end of the maturation process most of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains showed partially shrunken or completely collapsed protoplasm . as in the wild type pollen from _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ anthers developed and maturated normally . as a consequence of the pollen degeneration anther locules from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were almost empty at the _PROTEIN_ stages of pollen development compared with those of the wild type or _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ . to confirm which step of gametophyte development was affected by _PROTEIN_ mutation we performed hoechst staining of microspore _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants at different developmental stages . for this experiment the most normally shaped microspores at the last stages of development were selected since most of them were seriously malformed . _LOCATION_ staining corroborated that tetrad and _PROTEIN_ microspore development in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anthers was normal but that subsequent to the _PROTEIN_ microspore stage development was arrested and no bicellular or tricellular pollen was found . these results indicate that microspores from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are unable to undergo the double mitosis necessary to reach the mature pollen stage . scanning electron microscopy revealed that mature pollen from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line was shrunken and collapsed and unable to germinate when cultured in vitro . analysis of anther development indicated that the tapetal cell layer was formed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anthers but tapetum cells displayed irregular development with partially shrunken protoplasm that was detached from the cell wall at critical stages of pollen development compared with wild type cells . this may indicate a loss of turgor in the tapetum cells . it is important to note that pollen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anthers initiated the degeneration process at those developmental stages . a delay in the programmed cell death of the tapetum layer was also observed since this layer was still present at developmental stage while it was absent in wild type or _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ anthers . the observed morphological alteration in the tapetum of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anthers correlated with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in this cell layer specifically at stage . _PROTEIN_ was also clearly _PROTEIN_ in pollen _PROTEIN_ in stage and beyond . we next conducted segregation analysis of self fertilized _PROTEIN_ plants that were homozygous for constructs _PROTEIN_ and propsp _PROTEIN_ . based on pcr genotyping and unlike the segregation of self fertilized _PROTEIN_ plants the segregation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed a typical mendelian ratio _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the same was true for the segregation of self fertilized _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ . assuming a hypothesis of male sterility associated with the _PROTEIN_ allele we should expect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ individuals to be sterile and _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ to be fertile . in both cases the observed results agreed with the expected calculations according to the transmission efficiency for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . for instance in the segregation analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we obtained sterile homozygous individuals which agreed with the expected . in the segregation analysis of _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ we obtained fertile homozygous individuals which almost perfectly matched the expected . based on kanamycin resistance the segregation analysis of both self fertilized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ propsp _PROTEIN_ matched the ratio unlike the ratio observed in the _PROTEIN_ segregation analysis . to study the function of _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative development we obtained six independent conditional _PROTEIN_ mutant lines from the segregating population of transformed _PROTEIN_ plants with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under the control of the inducible heat shock promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . based on the induction pattern two lines which showed the lowest protein background _PROTEIN_ level under noninduced conditions were selected for further analysis . in plates and under noninduced conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed no significant difference in fresh weight of the aerial parts of the plant but the root fw was drastically reduced compared with the wild type . this reduction in root fw was associated with a short root phenotype which corresponds well with the specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in root _METHOD_ . the root growth inhibition of the conditional _PROTEIN_ mutants was rescued by both heat shock induction of _PROTEIN_ and ser supply to the growth medium . consequently both treatments also recovered normal root fw values compared with controls . further evidence for the role of _PROTEIN_ in root development is provided by the phenotypic analysis of transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose we used artificial microrna lines . these lines phenocopied the short root phenotype and the ser rescue of root growth of conditional _PROTEIN_ mutants . at the adult stage the six conditional _PROTEIN_ mutant lines analyzed showed a sterile phenotype before induction and were fertile after heat shock treatment thus confirming the essentiality of _PROTEIN_ for embryo and/or anther development . however unlike the short root phenotype it was not possible to complement the sterile phenotype of these conditional _PROTEIN_ mutants by ser supply to the growth medium . in order to further test the function of _PROTEIN_ in embryo development ovules of noninduced conditional _PROTEIN_ mutants were cross pollinated with pollen from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . as in heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants a population of aborted seeds with abnormal embryo development could be observed . in this case the segregation analysis of seeds revealed a ratio as expected . _PROTEIN_ activity was increased by in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reduced by in amirna lines compared with controls . the root growth rate in the oex did not significantly differ from that of the wild type . however metabolomic analysis revealed a clearly altered metabolite content in both amirna and oex plants compared with the wild type . in the aerial part of both amirnas and oex plants total amino acid increased compared with the wild type but oex plants showed the greatest increase . in roots metabolite changes differed from those found in the aerial parts and even occasionally showed an inverse trend . in this organ amirna lines displayed a greater increase in total amino acid levels compared with the wild type . given that no perfect inverse correlation of metabolite levels between oex and amirna lines was found we focused on either those metabolites that significantly changed more than times in only one of the lines compared with the wild type or those changes in which the oex/amirna ratio was higher than or lower than . in aerial parts significant increases in pro and orn were noted in oex lines while trp increased in amirna lines compared with the wild type . a clear significant increase was also found in organic acids participating in either glycolysis or in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the amirna lines in comparison to the wild type . _PROTEIN_ sugars and sugar alcohols galactinol myoinositol maltose and raffinose were significantly increased in the oex lines compared with the wild type . by contrast o methyl _PROTEIN_ significantly increased in amirna lines compared with the wild type . in roots a change in the trp levels was observed being significantly increased in amirna but _PROTEIN_ in oex lines compared with the wild type . a drastic reduction in the glyceric acid level was found in the oex plants while the level of this metabolite was not significantly altered in the amirna plants . by contrast other glycolytic intermediates such as fru p and glc p increased in the oex lines . finally ser levels increased in both aerial parts and roots of both amirnas and oex plants . neither the total soluble protein and starch contents of roots and aerial parts of the oex lines nor the total soluble protein content of the amirna lines in roots and aerial parts were significantly altered in comparison to the wild type . however the starch content of amirna lines was increased by in the aerial parts in comparison to the wild type .

cdna at the c terminal position _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ giving the _PROTEIN_ vector . this vector was used to obtain constructs propsp _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the promoter of _PROTEIN_ was exchanged with
