coordination between cell proliferation and differentiation is essential to create organized and functional tissues . arabidopsis thaliana stomata are created through a stereotyped series of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions whose frequency and orientation are informed by cell cell interactions . receptor like proteins and a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase were previously identified as negative regulators of stomatal development here we present the characterization of a bona fide positive regulator . fama is a putative basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ whose activity is required to promote differentiation of stomatal guard cells and to halt proliferative divisions in their immediate precursors . ectopic fama _PROTEIN_ is also sufficient to confer stomatal character . physical and genetic interaction studies combined with functional characterization of fama domains suggest that stomatal development relies on regulatory complexes distinct from those used to specify other plant epidermal cells . fama behavior provides insights into the control of differentiation in cells produced through the activity of self renewing populations .
fama was identified through a genome wide survey of genes that were more highly _PROTEIN_ in plants with an enriched stomatal population than in plants lacking stomata . the fama gene encodes a amino acid protein similar to bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ . these transcriptional regulators have a conserved basic domain that may contact dna an _PROTEIN_ domain for homo or heterodimerization and additional motifs that mediate interactions with other proteins . at least bhlhs are predicted in the arabidopsis genome . other members of the bhlh family have been implicated in responses to light and hormones and in other epidermal cell fate decisions . fama is a member of a small subclass of bhlh proteins that contains a short conserved region preceding the bhlh domain and a longer highly conserved c terminal domain of unknown function . negligible fama transcript is produced in lines homozygous for the t dna insertion . fama plants completely lack recognizable stomata but instead produce clusters of small narrow epidermal cells in the normal location of stomata . these collections of cells will be referred to as fama tumors . the overall morphology of fama mutant embryos and seedlings is not dramatically different from the wild type however _PROTEIN_ development is compromised and fama mutants arrest as pale plants with small rosette leaves and bushy inflorescences topped by one to three sterile flowers . in fama epidermal tumors are found on all organs that normally make stomata including cotyledons rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ pedicles sepals and siliques . on cotyledons fama tumors are larger on the adaxial surface than on the abaxial surface . a second t dna insertion allele near the end of the fama gene results in healthy fertile plants that contain occasional three and four celled stomata similar to those in a flp mutant . _PROTEIN_ of the fama cdna preceded by kb of genomic sequence of the predicted translational start rescues the fama mutant phenotype . to examine the specific spatial and temporal patterns of gene _PROTEIN_ at cellular resolution a reporter construct consisting of this kb fama upstream region was fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ . profama _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is restricted to the stomatal lineages . it is not _PROTEIN_ in meristemoids but is strongly _PROTEIN_ in gmcs and in young guard cells . _PROTEIN_ of profama gus was observed in similar patterns . no gus _PROTEIN_ was seen in internal tissue layers or in primary or _PROTEIN_ roots . fama protein localization was assayed with _METHOD_ tagged fama constructs driven by the kb fama upstream region . these transgenes are capable of rescuing fama mutants . both n and c terminal fusions of _METHOD_ to fama were predominantly _LOCATION_ localized and were _PROTEIN_ in the same spatial and temporal pattern . profama _METHOD_ fama was more easily visualized and thus was used for subsequent analysis . the profama _METHOD_ fama reporter was strongly _PROTEIN_ in gmcs and young guard cells of aerial organs similar to the transcriptional fusion suggesting that fama protein does not traffic from its site of synthesis . the identity of cells in the fama tumors was determined by the analysis of several cell fate markers . as cells enter the stomatal development pathway they _PROTEIN_ the receptor like protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . reporters for the two cell cycle regulators gus and gus are _PROTEIN_ in dividing cells . in the leaf epidermis these markers are _PROTEIN_ strongly in meristemoids and gmcs moderately in young guard cells and weakly in mature guard cells . these three markers are normally downregulated upon a cell reaching its terminal differentiated state . cells in fama tumors _PROTEIN_ all of these markers and continue to _PROTEIN_ them into the stages of leaf development when they are normally turned off . conversely cells in fama tumors fail to _PROTEIN_ the gus and _METHOD_ markers that are normally _PROTEIN_ in mature guard cells . the _PROTEIN_ of proflp gus a marker of gmc cells in tumors suggests that fama tumor cells progress to at least the gmc stage . many transcription _PROTEIN_ are regulated by feedback loops in which they regulate their own _PROTEIN_ . upstream of fama are several consensus bhlh binding sites suggesting it was possible that fama also regulated its own transcription . many cells in the fama tumors _PROTEIN_ the profama _METHOD_ reporter . this indicates that fama is not absolutely required to promote its own _PROTEIN_ . because not all tumor cells _PROTEIN_ profama _METHOD_ however it is possible that fama has an autoregulatory role in promoting or _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ . lack of fama prevents cells from progressing to the guard cell stage suggesting that fama is necessary both to prevent cell division and to promote guard cell fate . to determine whether fama was sufficient to induce guard cell fate we ectopically _PROTEIN_ fama using an estrogen inducible system . induced overexpression of fama generated an epidermal phenotype that could easily be interpreted as opposite to the loss of function phenotype . in these plants the cotyledon epidermis consisted of cells that have the kidney shaped morphology of guard cells . these cells produce a cell wall _PROTEIN_ containing biorefringent material reminiscent of stomatal pore sites and some cells produce structures that morphologically resemble pores . the cells also _PROTEIN_ two molecular markers gus and _METHOD_ providing additional evidence that these cells posses guard cell identity . in contrast with guard cells of normal stomata however the cells resulting from fama overexpression are unpaired . fama overexpression is also able to convert nonstomatal lineage cells to guard cells . in strong proest fama lines germinated on estrogen induction caused guard cell transdifferentiation in almost all epidermal cells including cells in nonstomatal files of the hypocotyls and in roots . fama overexpression may also be able to induce partial transdifferentiation of nonepidermal tissues . cells presumed to be mesophyll by their location have altered cell shape and _PROTEIN_ guard cell markers _METHOD_ and gus . the change in cell morphology is visible within h after germination coincident with the time the first guard cells normally appear . seedlings that produce excess presumably nonfunctional unpaired guard cells in multiple cell layers were not viable . _PROTEIN_ of fama in wild type plants under the control of tissue specific promoters also promoted ectopic or premature guard cell formation . _PROTEIN_ of fama with the stomatal lineage specific promoter _PROTEIN_ led to the formation of unpaired guard cells in places where _PROTEIN_ is normally _PROTEIN_ . likewise some lines _PROTEIN_ fama in gmcs could also induce the production of some single guard cells in the epidermis . in these lines fama _METHOD_ was seen in the _LOCATION_ of morphologically normal gmcs and weak _PROTEIN_ was visible in _LOCATION_ of both normal and unpaired guard cells . despite possessing many characteristics of guard cells the cells created by fama overexpression are not correctly organized into pairs flanking a pore . one interpretation of this phenotype is that fama overexpression not only drives differentiation but inhibits cell division so that the gmc converts directly into a guard cell without undergoing cytokinesis . this possibility was tested in the profama _METHOD_ fama lines where the fate of individual _METHOD_ positive cells was followed over h . twelve _METHOD_ positive cells with the morphology of gmcs were identified in leaf of d old plants . two days _PROTEIN_ single guard cells were identified in the same locations as these gmcs . multiple guard cells or ambiguous cells were also occasionally observed . these data suggest that overexpression of fama can force gmcs to differentiate into guard cells without undergoing the normal symmetrical cell division . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of fama and its loss and gain of function phenotypes are all consistent with fama regulating the final stage in stomatal development . fama appears to be absolutely required for stomatal development in wild type plants . to determine whether this requirement could be overcome by generating a larger number of stomatal lineage cells loss of function mutations in the negative regulators _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yoda and the _LOCATION_ family _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were combined with a fama mutation . in no case were guard cells formed indicating that there is an absolute requirement for fama in guard cell differentiation . the number of tumors and their orientation and spacing relative to each other reflect the phenotype of the second mutation . in other epidermal cell fate decisions a complex of an type myb a bhlh and a wd repeat protein is at the top of a regulatory hierarchy that leads to cell fate specification . in stomatal development two type mybs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in gmcs and are required to regulate the transition from gmc to guard cell . because fama and _PROTEIN_ have overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns and similar mutant phenotypes genetic physical and regulatory relationships between them were tested . fama and flp form clusters of gmcs although gmcs in flp eventually become guard cells . the fama differentiation phenotype is epistatic in double mutants of flp fama but the proliferation phenotype is additive . _PROTEIN_ single mutants are indistinguishable from the wild type but enhance the flp mutant phenotype . double mutant combinations of _PROTEIN_ fama resemble fama . these genetic interactions argue against a model that fama and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ form obligate heterodimers . the fama phenotype is more severe than flp or flp _PROTEIN_ suggesting that fama acts prior to _PROTEIN_ or that it is required for a broader range of activities . to determine whether fama is required for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a proflp gus _METHOD_ reporter was examined in fama tumors . proflp gus is _PROTEIN_ in fama . the profama _METHOD_ reporter is _PROTEIN_ in flp suggesting that neither protein is required for the transcriptional activation of the other . neither _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ nor fama possess the domains known to promote myb/bhlh dimerization . nevertheless fama was tested for its ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid assays and with an in planta split _METHOD_ assay . fama failed to interact with _PROTEIN_ in these assays . taken together the evidence does not support a model that fama and _PROTEIN_ form a complex equivalent to that used in other epidermal cell fate decisions . fama acts as a major regulator of the decision to proliferate or differentiate . the _LOCATION_ localization and presence of conserved domains belonging to bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ suggest that it is likely that fama plays this role by regulating gene _PROTEIN_ . fama contains the conserved residues h e r in the putative dna binding domain . this triad is characteristic of proteins that bind dna at the g box motif . substituting noncharged residues at the h e r sites resulted in a protein that failed to rescue fama . attaching a repression domain to the c terminus of fama created a dominant negative phenotype also consistent with fama acting as a transcriptional regulator . plant bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ may act as transcriptional activators or transcriptional repressors . because the conversion from gmc to guard cells could conceivably involve both the repression and activation of targets fama was tested in a protoplast based transcriptional activation/repression assay . to test for transcriptional activation full length fama was fused to the yeast dna binding domain and transiently coexpressed with a reporter containing and lexa binding sites in front of gus . fama was a robust activator of gus activity indicating that it can act as a transcriptional activator . to test if fama has transcriptional repression activity fama db was cotransformed with a constitutive transcriptional activator lexa db and the lexa gus reporter . coexpression of with a known repressor can eliminate the activation however coexpression of fama and increased gus activity above the level achieved when either protein was _PROTEIN_ alone again suggesting that fama behaves primarily as a transcriptional activator . in addition to the bhlh domain the fama clade of bhlhs share previously uncharacterized c and n terminal domains . functional characterization of fama domains was assayed by _PROTEIN_ of deletion constructs under the control of an estrogen inducible promoter in columbia and in fama . _PROTEIN_ of the n terminus alone or the _PROTEIN_ domain alone neither rescued fama nor recapitulated the gain of function phenotype . _PROTEIN_ of the c terminal domain also failed to rescue fama but did lead to a slight increase in stomatal density and stomatal cluster formation in a wild type background . _PROTEIN_ of another variant of fama containing the _PROTEIN_ domain and c terminus produced an unexpected phenotype . in dag col plants proest induction caused the overproliferation of small cells in the epidermis . this phenotype is similar to the effect of overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or other positive regulators of cell division . in contrast with the cells produced by overexpressing cell cycle genes however the cells produced by proest all differentiated into stomata by dag . reexamination of the epidermis of proest famapgg col plants at dag revealed that induction of famapgg could also cause the entire leaf epidermis to form morphologically normal guard cells . this phenotype was dependent on a functional genomic copy of fama . in fama mutants proest and proest famapgg produced excess gmcs but no stomata . _PROTEIN_ of fama or famapgg with the estrogen or promoter converts all cotyledon epidermal cells into stomata . _PROTEIN_ of protmm famapgg also induces ectopic stomata but in smaller domains of the epidermis consistent with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . when _PROTEIN_ in gmcs under the fama promoter however famapgg had no effect suggesting that the altered fama protein exerts its stomata promoting effects by either interfering with proteins other than fama and/or acting before gmc formation . the behavior of fama suggested that fama might interfere with or mimic the activity of other stomatal regulators . to identify candidate partners of fama a yeast two hybrid screen was performed using an n terminal deleted version of fama that contained the full bhlh domain and c terminus . two bhlh proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified in multiple interacting clones . both proteins share significant sequence similarity with fama in the bhlh domain and _PROTEIN_ is in the same subgroup as fama . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation was used to test in planta protein protein interactions between these bhlhs and fama . fama _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a distantly related bhlh were tested for pairwise interactions fama interacted strongly with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and moderately with itself but not with the distantly related bhlh . to determine whether the neomorphic famapgg protein variant had altered dimerization qualities famapgg was also tested in this bifc assay . interactions of _PROTEIN_ fama _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with famapgg were comparable to their interactions with wild type fama suggesting that the altered version can dimerize with other bhlhs . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to be broadly _PROTEIN_ . their functional involvement in stomatal development was tested in both loss of function and gain of function assays . loss of function was assayed by the addition of a dominant repression domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and by characterizing the epidermis in plants homozygous for t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in none of these cases was an obvious defect in stomatal formation observed . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with the promoter resulted in a weak fama phenotype in a small fraction of the lines . the lack of strong phenotype of loss or gain of function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may indicate redundancy or may indicate that these proteins although capable of interacting with fama are not its normal partners . the strong physical interaction between fama and these bhlhs contrasts with the undetectable interaction between fama and the myb type transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strengthening the argument against a fama/flp complex and suggesting that if fama _METHOD_ heteromeric complexes it may do so with other bhlh proteins .
