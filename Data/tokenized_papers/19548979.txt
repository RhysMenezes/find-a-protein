the arabidopsis gene _GENE_ encodes a _LOCATION_ bound protein designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is related to the bacterial outer _LOCATION_ tryptophan rich sensory protein _PROTEIN_ and the mammalian mitochondrial kda translocator protein _PROTEIN_ members of the group of _PROTEIN_ domain containing _LOCATION_ proteins . in this study we show that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ detected in dry seeds but can be induced in vegetative tissues by osmotic or salt stress or abscisic acid treatment corroborating available transcriptome data . using subcellular fractionation immunocytochemistry and _METHOD_ protein tagging approaches we present evidence that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the secretory pathway in plants . induced or constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ stacks of plant cells . _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ protein in transgenic plants was _PROTEIN_ detected in the _LOCATION_ stacks of leaf epidermal cells . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased sensitivity to nacl but not to osmotic stress and in reduced greening of cultured arabidopsis cells under light growing conditions . transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were more sensitive to aba induced growth inhibition indicating that constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ may enhance aba sensitivity . _PROTEIN_ is rapidly downregulated during seed imbibition and the aba dependent induction in plant is transient . downregulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be boosted by treatment with aminolevulinic acid . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a highly regulated protein induced by abiotic stress to modulate at least in part transient intracellular aba dependent stress perception and/or signalling .
transcriptome analyses suggested that transcripts of the arabidopsis gene _GENE_ are induced by salt and water stress . as previously reported a database search for _PROTEIN_ related proteins and primary sequence analyses identified mammalian kda _PROTEIN_ bacterial _PROTEIN_ and related proteins having in common the so called _PROTEIN_ domain . the first members of this group of proteins to be identified were the r. sphaeroides _PROTEIN_ protein and the mammalian kda _PROTEIN_ which have been extensively characterized . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was found to be encoded by a single intronless gene and _PROTEIN_ sequence tag analyses suggested that this may be the case in other _METHOD_ . we first compared the primary sequence of _PROTEIN_ with those of other full length plant proteins containing the _PROTEIN_ domain and with that of human kda _PROTEIN_ protein . as shown in figure there is about amino acid identity between the plant proteins and between the plant proteins and the mammalian protein . it is worth mentioning that although r. sphaeroides _PROTEIN_ and mammalian kda _PROTEIN_ only show about identity rat _PROTEIN_ can functionally replace bacterial _PROTEIN_ . the plant proteins have an n terminal extension of about amino acids not found in the bacterial and mammalian proteins . the sequence of this extension is not conserved among plant proteins but is characterized as in _PROTEIN_ by a high frequency of charged residues _PROTEIN_ . query of arabidopsis transcriptome data from genevestigator and bar _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and other reported data suggested that under normal conditions _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ is highest in seeds but can be induced in vegetative tissues by salt osmotic stress and aba treatment . in silico analysis of the approximately bp intergenic region between _GENE_ and _GENE_ for known plant cis regulatory elements identified three aba responsive elements _PROTEIN_ . we also found a gbox and two iboxes both common in light regulated plant genes . another interesting motif in this region was the recently described _LOCATION_ responsive element _PROTEIN_ consensus cga n . to investigate where and when _PROTEIN_ function was required in the plant we generated polyclonal antibodies against the synthetic peptide and used the affinity purified antibodies to detect the protein by western blotting in various extracts . as shown in figure when a total protein extract from day old seedlings grown in half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium was compared with a protein extract from seeds a band of the expected size was detected in seeds but not in seedlings suggesting that as expected from the transcriptome data under normal growing conditions _PROTEIN_ accumulates in seeds but little if any in young vegetative tissues . _PROTEIN_ was not detected in rosette and cauline leaves from wild type plants grown in soil . however _PROTEIN_ was detected in day old seedlings pre incubated in the dark for h in liquid _METHOD_ medium containing or aba but not in the absence of aba and _PROTEIN_ levels increased with aba concentration . next we investigated the effects of mannitol and nacl . the final concentrations of the two chemicals in the _METHOD_ medium were chosen to give the same final osmolarity . as shown in figure mannitol or nacl treatment induced the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ increased with the osmolarity of the incubating medium . to verify that the generated antibodies were a reliable tool for measuring _PROTEIN_ levels in various tissues we used six independent arabidopsis transgenic lines developed by the _PROTEIN_ consortium _PROTEIN_ the rnai construct directed against _GENE_ transcripts . as recommended by the consortium we checked by pcr that the rnai construct was present in genomic dna extracted from three randomly selected seedlings of each rnai line . wild type seedlings and each of the rnai lines were incubated as described above in _METHOD_ liquid medium containing aba and the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies used to probe total protein extracts . as shown in figure variable levels of _PROTEIN_ were detected in the rnai lines suggesting different degrees of reduction in _GENE_ transcript levels . since little or no _PROTEIN_ was detected in vegetative tissues of lines and after aba treatment we examined _PROTEIN_ levels in protein extracts of dry seeds and found that they were almost undetectable . similar results were obtained with the offspring of the homozygous t dna insertional line . these results suggest that this gene is not essential for seed development as the knock down or knockout plants generated viable seeds confirming the specificity of the generated antibodies and strengthening the interpretation of aba as a regulator of the _PROTEIN_ of this protein in plant tissues . salinity and osmotic stress are known to increase aba levels in plant tissues and given the presence of _PROTEIN_ elements in the putative promoter region of _GENE_ the observed induction of _PROTEIN_ by abiotic stress may be due to aba . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants and cell lines constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . as shown in figure in the absence of aba _PROTEIN_ was detected in extracts from week old transgenic seedlings grown on a _METHOD_ plate and in the stably transformed cultured cell lines and . mammalian kda _PROTEIN_ is localized to the omm and most of its cellular activities are associated with mitochondrial functions . a recent study suggested that p. patens is a mitochondrial protein . as shown in figure under normal growing conditions _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues or in arabidopsis suspension cells . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells we first took advantage of the generated _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plant and cell lines . we used _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis cultured cells and sucrose gradient fractionation of total microsomes to investigate which cellular _LOCATION_ co sedimented with _PROTEIN_ . as markers we used the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proton pump _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the vesicle soluble _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ attachment receptor _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to shuttle between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity as a mitochondrial marker . figure shows representative results using line . figure shows the immunoblotting results for the odd numbered fractions from the gradient . the _PROTEIN_ peak was found in fraction . interestingly both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peaked in fraction with a minor peak in fraction . _PROTEIN_ peaks were clearly separate from that of cytochrome c oxidase showing that _PROTEIN_ enriched fractions did not co sediment with the optimal mitochondria enriched fraction . in addition _PROTEIN_ was not enriched in either purified fractions of mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . these results show that in plant cells _PROTEIN_ is not a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a mitochondrial or a chloroplastic protein raising the possibility that as a _LOCATION_ bound protein it may be targeted to a subcellular compartment of the secretory pathway as suggested by its co sedimentation with _PROTEIN_ in the sucrose gradient . to determine the in situ subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we performed an immunocytochemical study on leaf tissues of stable transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies covalently linked to fluorescein were used . we checked that no labelling was detectable in wild type and knockout plants . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ was detected in a tubular network reminiscent of the _LOCATION_ and in brighter punctate structures associated with the network . the latter were structurally similar to _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ stacks in leaf cells . a similar distribution of _PROTEIN_ was obtained after immunocytochemistry in seeds or after aba treatment of wild type seedlings . to further investigate the idea that _PROTEIN_ containing structures found in seeds or in leaf tissues might be organelles of the early secretory pathway _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we fused yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the n terminus or green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . each of these genetic constructs was used to stably transform arabidopsis and tobacco resulting in constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in the plant . no transgenic plants were recovered when the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ was tagged suggesting a counter selection event . selected plant lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analysed by confocal microscopy to localize the fusion protein . figure shows confocal z stack projections of optical sections from representative rosette leaves of transgenic arabidopsis . the fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in mobile punctate structures in the leaf epidermal cells reminiscent of _LOCATION_ stacks . in some cells _METHOD_ was also seen around the _LOCATION_ and connected tubules . similar observations were made with transgenic tobacco plants . to determine the nature of the punctate structures containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the same construct that was used to generate transgenic plants was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with the well described plant _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . figure shows a subset of still images from the movie presented as supporting information . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ perfectly co localized with the _LOCATION_ localized signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirming that the punctate structures containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were indeed _LOCATION_ stacks . in addition the mitochondrial dye mitotracker red stained organelles in transgenic plants which did not co localize with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures . we therefore concluded that _PROTEIN_ is an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _LOCATION_ protein in plant cells . arabidopsis suspension cultured cells are heterotrophic and if _PROTEIN_ in the dark stay yellowish and contain mostly proplastids but become green when exposed to light as a consequence of increased chlorophyll synthesis and the development of proplastids into chloroplasts . light induced synthesis of chlorophyll is coordinated with that of the major light harvesting antenna complex . synthesis of the proteinaceous components of the antenna scaffold increases several fold under light conditions as chlorophyll a/b binding proteins are required for the assembly and functionality of the antennae . wild type cells or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line were transferred to agar plates and incubated for up to weeks either in the dark or on a h light/dark regime and then the cells were scraped from the agar plate resuspended in homogenization buffer and pelleted by centrifugation . as shown by the plated cells and pelleted cells the colour of the wild type and overexpressing cells was comparable when the cells were grown in the dark and when subjected to a light/dark regime both types of cells showed greening the extent of which was affected by the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with the wild type cells being greener than _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells . immunoblotting of protein extracts showed that neither treatment induced detectable _PROTEIN_ in wild type cells but _PROTEIN_ was readily detectable in the overexpressing cells . figure also shows the relative content of some chloroplast proteins in these cells . as expected _PROTEIN_ was not detected when the cultures were _PROTEIN_ in the dark . however its amount was markedly reduced in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells compared with wild type cells grown in the light . relative levels of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ encoded by the chloroplast genome and of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both encoded by the _LOCATION_ genome were reduced in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells suggesting that constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ affected through an as yet unknown mechanism the accumulation of key components involved in chloroplast function in these non phototrophic cells . this was more striking for _PROTEIN_ as the mature form of the protein was not detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells after light induction . similar results were obtained with the second transgenic cell line . to correlate the variation in greening with pigment content we compared the chlorophyll content of wild type and cells grown under the light/dark regime . as shown in the bottom panel of figure the wild type cells had about more total chlorophyll than _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells with a approximately fold increase in chlorophyll a but only a marginal difference in chlorophyll b . these results indicate that the variation in greening between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells was _PROTEIN_ due to the chlorophyll a content and that the normally strictly regulated chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio in photosynthetic plant cells was drastically modified by constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in these cultured cells . _PROTEIN_ is transcriptionally regulated by abiotic stress . we checked whether constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ confers any advantage or disadvantage to cells in the presence of such stress . to this end suspension cultured arabidopsis cells were spotted on agar medium and allowed to grow into calli in the dark on culture medium containing increasing concentrations of nacl . osmotic stress alone was applied by incorporating increasing amounts of mannitol into agar containing culture medium the cells were spread on these plates and incubated under the light/dark regime described above . after weeks in the dark wild type cells were able to grow and form visible calli in the presence of up to mm nacl with substantially reduced growth at higher concentrations . in contrast the growth of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells was already drastically impaired at mm nacl . _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells did not survive in the presence of mm nacl or higher concentrations while some viable wild type cells could be seen in the presence of mm nacl . this shows that _PROTEIN_ overexpression increases the sensitivity of cultured cells to nacl . we found that on average _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells were larger than the wild type cells . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells were more sensitive to na toxicity or to the osmotic stress induced by salinity we checked their sensitivity to mannitol induced osmotic stress . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ appeared to attenuate the effect of a high concentration of mannitol on cell survival . the growth of cells was less impaired at or mm mannitol than that of wild type cells . these observations suggest that the increased sensitivity to nacl has more to do with na toxicity than the water stress generated by increasing nacl concentration in the culture medium . to confirm that the increased sensitivity to nacl as a consequence of overexpressing _PROTEIN_ was not a peculiarity of cultured cells we also compared the sensitivity to nacl of the knockout line the wild type and a homozygous _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line . ten day old seedlings were allowed to develop on increasing nacl concentrations . no striking growth difference was apparent between the three genotypes on control medium or at mm nacl . the overexpressing plants showed more sensitivity to nacl with reduced leaf development and root branching at mm with most of the plants dying after a week s exposure to mm nacl . another intriguing observation was the increased sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants to aba dependent growth inhibition as compared to knockout and wild type plants . taken together our results suggest that salinity and aba may induce _PROTEIN_ but paradoxically constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increases sensitivity to nacl and aba . this raises the possibility that _PROTEIN_ may only be temporarily required by the cells in vegetative tissues and hence possibly rapidly downregulated after induction . a time course experiment was conducted to investigate the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ induction by aba . after incubation of day old seedlings in half strength _METHOD_ medium supplemented with aba detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to peak around h and steadily decline thereafter to become almost undetectable after h. we observed substantial bleaching of the leaves during this aba treatment materialized by the degradation of the large subunit of rubisco . we checked by western blotting that these protein bands corresponded to the degradation products of rubisco large subunit . we wonder if degradation of _PROTEIN_ like that of rubisco was consecutive to aba induced bleaching of the tissues or a result of an additional regulatory mechanism to reduce _PROTEIN_ levels . we consistently found that when overexpressed _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the leaves were _PROTEIN_ detectable in the epidermis and hardly detected in mesophyll cells . this _METHOD_ evidence of possible cell type dependent stability of the protein and the published evidence that the endogenous ligand of _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins includes porphyrins prompted us to check whether boosting porphyrin metabolism had any effect on the stability of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . figure clearly shows that incubating arabidopsis cultured cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ with the porphyrin biosynthesis precursor aminolevulinic acid resulted in a reduction of detectable _PROTEIN_ of up to after h in the dark . we also followed the _PROTEIN_ content of wild type seeds imbibing in water or water supplemented with ala . here again we found that seed imbibition in the presence of ala significantly enhanced _PROTEIN_ degradation compared with seeds imbibing in water . these results suggest that porphyrins may be responsible for downregulating _PROTEIN_ levels in plant cells .
