the yeast and human mitochondrial sulfhydryl oxidases of the _LOCATION_ family have been shown to be essential for the biogenesis of mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ iron sulfur cluster assembly . in this study we identified a likely candidate for the first mitochondrial flavin linked sulfhydryl oxidase of the _LOCATION_ type from a photosynthetic organism . the central core of the plant enzyme _PROTEIN_ exhibits all of the characteristic features of the _LOCATION_ protein family including a redox active ypcxxc motif noncovalently bound fad and sulfhydryl oxidase activity . transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein in plant protoplasts showed that the plant enzyme preferentially localizes to the mitochondria . yet _PROTEIN_ has several unique features such as the presence of a cxxxxc motif in its _PROTEIN_ terminal domain and the absence of an amino terminally localized cysteine pair common to yeast and human _LOCATION_ proteins . in addition the dimerization of _PROTEIN_ is not mediated by its amino terminus but by its unique cxxxxc motif . in vitro assays with purified protein and artificial substrates demonstrate a preference of _PROTEIN_ for dithiols with a defined space between the thiol groups suggesting a thioredoxin like substrate .
cloning of the plant cdna for _PROTEIN_ first aim was to identify putative _LOCATION_ homologues in higher plants . screening of arabidopsis sequence data bases with the yeast _LOCATION_ protein sequence identified only one _LOCATION_ gene as a possible candidate . the most reliable sequence data were used to synthesize primers for the putative full length cdna . these primers were included in pcr experiments with an arabidopsis cdna library . dna fragments of about bp were amplified . three independent clones were isolated and subjected to dna sequencing . all three dna inserts exhibited identical dna sequences . the cdna _PROTEIN_ contained an open reading frame with the capacity to encode a protein of amino acids . the comparison of the putative plant protein with yeast _LOCATION_ and yeast and human _LOCATION_ is shown in fig . . the central domain with the catalytic core is highly conserved whereas the amino and _PROTEIN_ terminal regions reveal unique features . unique cxxxxc motif and highly conserved central comparing the sequences of yeast human and plant sulfhydryl oxidases identifies a _PROTEIN_ terminal cxxxxc motif as a unique feature of _PROTEIN_ . close inspection of the available data bases from the genome sequencing projects of higher plants identified several _LOCATION_ homologues . notably a _PROTEIN_ cysteine pair separated by exactly four amino acids is present in all putative plant _LOCATION_ homologues from dicots and monocots identified thus far arguing for the functional importance of the new cxxxxc motif in _LOCATION_ from higher plants . in contrast the highly conserved central core exhibits all features typical to members of the _LOCATION_ protein family . the available structural data from the conserved central domain of yeast _LOCATION_ the first crystallized member of the _LOCATION_ protein family allowed the comparative modeling of _PROTEIN_ . the modeled structure of the conserved core from amino acids to of plant _PROTEIN_ is presented in fig . . a four helix bundle _METHOD_ the putative fad binding site and the conserved catalytic cysteine pair ypcxxc is in close proximity to the isoalloxazine _PROTEIN_ . a structural disulfide bridge between a second cysteine pair that is separated by exactly amino acids in _LOCATION_ alrp and _LOCATION_ is also predicted for _PROTEIN_ . this disulfide bridge fixes the short fifth helix against the four helix bundle and is important for stabilizing the fad binding pocket . _PROTEIN_ and characterization of recombinant plant _PROTEIN_ define the functional characteristics of plant _PROTEIN_ two recombinant proteins with a tag were synthesized in e. coli . the putative full length protein of kda and the _PROTEIN_ terminal domain of kda were successfully _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the proteins on nonreducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that both fragments form dimers and multimers indicating that in contrast to the yeast protein the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ does not participate in dimerization . although the cause of multimerization of _PROTEIN_ is yet unknown it is not unique because it is typically observed for all _LOCATION_ proteins . in vitro experiments show that multimerization of all these proteins is dependent on the concentration and the number of cysteine residues in mutant proteins . for the kda protein degradation products were routinely found indicating increased instability of this gene product . the kda fragment did not show any prominent degradation products . therefore further characterization of _PROTEIN_ was performed with the kda fragment that contained both the redox active ypcxxc motif and the fad binding domain . the disappearance of _PROTEIN_ dimers upon reduction with dithiothreitol indicated that as in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ dimerization of _PROTEIN_ is mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bridge . the conservation of the _PROTEIN_ terminal cxxxxc motif in all plant homologues of _PROTEIN_ suggested that it functionally replaced the amino terminal cysteine pair of _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the cxxxxc motif participates in an interdisulfide bridge two mutant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ one lacking the _PROTEIN_ terminal member of the cysteine pair and a second missing the entire cxxxxc motif were produced and purified from e. coli . the disappearance of dimer formation in the mutant form lacking the plant conserved _PROTEIN_ terminal cysteine pair and the increased dimer and multimers formation in the single cysteine mutant protein strongly argue for the functional replacement of the amino terminal cysteine pair of _LOCATION_ by the _PROTEIN_ terminal cxxxxc motif in _PROTEIN_ . the presence of fad in the purified protein was verified by spectroscopy . the spectrum of the kda fragment exhibited the characteristic features of a protein bound fad moiety . assays for enzymatic activity using artificial in vitro substrates demonstrated sulfhydryl activities with turnover numbers comparable with those reported for the yeast mitochondrial enzyme . like the yeast protein the plant enzyme did not use mercaptoethanol or glutathione as a substrate . notably _PROTEIN_ exhibited a high preference for dithiol reductants and particularly for thioredoxin . complementation studies between yeast _LOCATION_ ts and the plant available mutants of yeast _LOCATION_ allowed in vivo complementation studies with plant _LOCATION_ . for this purpose the full length cdna for _PROTEIN_ was cloned into a yeast _PROTEIN_ vector . neither the _LOCATION_ ts mutant nor the deletion mutant could be rescued by the plant enzyme . to exclude any defects in the import of the plant enzyme into yeast mitochondria a new set of experiments was initiated where the yeast import sequence from was fused to the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ . this fusion protein also gave no detectable complementation activity in vivo . the presence of the tag which had been shown previously not to obstruct complementation with the yeast _LOCATION_ or human alrp proteins allowed us to readily confirm that the fusion protein is correctly _PROTEIN_ in yeast and imported into mitochondria . thus despite their sequence similarities the yeast and plant homologues are also functionally distinct . localization experiments in plant cells with fusion proteins of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ sequence with the current computer _METHOD_ for predicting subcellular localization identified no typical import sequence for mitochondria and even predicted a possible _LOCATION_ localization . therefore it was essential to confirm the subcellular localization of this protein in vivo . two constructs of _METHOD_ fused either to the _PROTEIN_ terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in plant protoplasts from arabidopsis or physcomitrella . confocal _METHOD_ microscopy of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct revealed the accumulation of _METHOD_ in distinct somewhat spherical bodies localized outside the chloroplasts in both plants . staining the protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct with the mitochondria specific dye mitotracker showed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the mitochondria . in contrast the _METHOD_ of the reverse orientation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins appeared diffuse and outside the mitochondria and chloroplasts suggesting that the amino terminal leader of _PROTEIN_ is required for efficient targeting to the mitochondria .
