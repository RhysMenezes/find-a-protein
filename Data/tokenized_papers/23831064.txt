recent studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ participate in the response to abiotic stress as either positive or negative regulators in arabidopsis . to further elucidate the cellular roles of _PROTEIN_ in stress responses their _PROTEIN_ profiles were investigated using publicly accessible in silico data . numerous _PROTEIN_ were induced or suppressed by abiotic stresses . _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced by low temperature treatment . to confirm the cold induction of _PROTEIN_ rt pcr analysis was conducted . _PROTEIN_ was markedly induced in day old arabidopsis seedlings after and h incubation at . the magnitude of cold induction of _PROTEIN_ was comparable to that of the known marker gene _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ were reduced in response to drought mm nacl and aba . these results raised the possibility of differential _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in response to cold and drought stress . a promoter gus assay showed that basal levels of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were detected in both leaf and root tissues including guard cells and root tip under normal growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity increased in response to cold treatment but _PROTEIN_ in response to drought salt and aba treatments in leaves and roots . however the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ remained unchanged in the root tip after stress treatments . overall the _PROTEIN_ studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ is differentially controlled at the transcriptional level by cold and drought stress in arabidopsis . the deduced _PROTEIN_ protein consists of amino acid residues with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . as found in other _PROTEIN_ family members _PROTEIN_ contains a single c h c type _PROTEIN_ motif putative trans _LOCATION_ domain basic amino acids rich region conserved gld tripeptide sequence and c terminal diverged region . to test whether _PROTEIN_ possesses an ub ligase activity the mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion construct was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . the full length mbp _PROTEIN_ was insoluble in bacterial cells probably due to an n terminal trans _LOCATION_ domain . mbp _PROTEIN_ in which the trans _LOCATION_ domain was removed was efficiently _PROTEIN_ as a soluble protein and used for an in vitro self ubiquitination assay . mbp _PROTEIN_ displayed in vitro ub ligase activity in the presence of ub _PROTEIN_ and which was detected by anti mbp and anti ub antibodies . by contrast mbp _PROTEIN_ in which the conserved cys residue in the _PROTEIN_ motif was replaced by ser failed to exhibit ub ligase activity . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves and _PROTEIN_ protein was visualized with a _METHOD_ microscope . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was barely detected in tobacco cells probably due to self ubiquitination . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which the _PROTEIN_ motif was deleted was strongly detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this localization pattern overlapped with staining of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein which lacks the trans _LOCATION_ domain was detected in the _LOCATION_ fractions . transient _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in tobacco cells were examined by immuno blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the results showed that full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was undetectable in tobacco cells . by contrast strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was detected . a weak but clearly detectable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed . these results raised the possibility that self ubiquitination and degradation of _PROTEIN_ may be correlated with its _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . overall it _METHOD_ highly likely that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ ub ligase . however since the biochemical and localization studies were done using the deleted versions of recombinant we can not rule out the possibility that full length _PROTEIN_ has different ub ligase activity and subcellular localization pattern in arabidopsis . to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ with respect to cold and drought stress responses a loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutant line was obtained . the _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant contained double t dna insertions after nucleotide in an antisense orientation . genotyping pcr identified homozygous _PROTEIN_ progeny . full length and partial _PROTEIN_ transcripts were undetectable by rt pcr indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a null mutant . because only a single allele of _PROTEIN_ was available rnai mediated knock down transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ were generated . the amount of _PROTEIN_ transcript was markedly down regulated in independent rnai _PROTEIN_ lines and . these knock out and knock down transgenic lines were used for phenotypic analyses . light grown day old wild type _PROTEIN_ knock out and rnai _PROTEIN_ knock down plants were subjected to cold stress . the survival of cold stressed plants was observed one week after transfer from low temperature to normal conditions . the results showed that of wild type plants survived after cold stress whereas of _PROTEIN_ mutant progeny were healthy and resumed growth after treatment with low temperature stress . the survival rates of rnai knock down lines were intermediate between those of wild type and knock out plants . consistently electrolyte leakage assays revealed that the _PROTEIN_ leaves displayed significantly lower electrolyte leakage compared with that of wild type leaves after low temperature treatments . the degree of electrolyte leakage of rnai lines was intermediate between that of wild type and knock out plants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are induced by cold stress in arabidopsis . cold stress induction of these genes was clearly up regulated in _PROTEIN_ mutant and to a lesser extent in rnai plants compared with that in wild type plants . these results indicate that suppression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased tolerance to cold stress . ros are crucial participants in plant stress responses . to determine the level of h o production in response to low temperature control and cold stressed leaves from wild type _PROTEIN_ and rnai plants were treated with dab which interacts with h o and produces a dark brown color . higher amounts of cold induced h o were detected in leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutant and rnai knock down rosette leaves compared with that in wild type leaves suggesting that _PROTEIN_ negatively participates in cold induced h o production . overall the phenotypic analyses of _PROTEIN_ and rnai _PROTEIN_ plants indicate that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ is inversely correlated with cold stress tolerance . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a negative _PROTEIN_ in the cold stress response in arabidopsis . the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and rnai _PROTEIN_ plants were examined in the drought stress response . wild type knock out and knock down plants were grown for days under normal growth conditions . they were grown for another days without irrigation and then irrigated normally . the survival rates of drought stressed plants were determined days after the resumption of irrigation . the results showed that of wild type plants survived after drought stress followed by re watering . however of the _PROTEIN_ mutants were able to resume growth after re watering . the survival rates of rnai _PROTEIN_ lines in response to dehydration and re watering were intermediate between those of wild type and knock out plants . therefore suppression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a severely _PROTEIN_ tolerance to drought stress . to corroborate the results for the drought stress response the crwl experiment was conducted . mature rosette leaves were detached from day old wild type mutant and rnai plants placed in open lid petri dishes and incubated for h at room temperature . reduction of the leaf fresh weights was monitored . the results demonstrated that wild type leaves retained their water content more efficiently than mutant or rnai leaves during dehydration . the fresh weight of wild type leaves was gradually reduced to approximately and of the initial weight after and min incubation respectively . during the same incubation period the fresh weight of both mutant and rnai leaves _PROTEIN_ to approximately and respectively . the drought induced marker genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were all down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and rnai _PROTEIN_ plants compared with those in wild type plant in response to drought stress . furthermore the level of drought induced h o production was significantly lower in mutant and rnai leaves compared with that in wild type leaves . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a positive _PROTEIN_ in water stress response in arabidopsis . overall the suppression of _PROTEIN_ exhibited opposite effects in response to cold and drought stress it increased tolerance to cold stress but _PROTEIN_ tolerance to drought stress . to further substantiate the opposite roles of _PROTEIN_ in cold and drought stress responses _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated . several independent transgenic progeny were identified by rt pcr and immuno blot analyses . in contrast to the responses to stress in knock out and knock down lines the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were highly susceptible to relatively mild cold stress . after cold treatment their survival rates were depending on the independent lines whereas survival of wild type plants was . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants displayed increased tolerance to drought . after severe dehydration stress of wild type plants survived whereas of overexpressing lines were still alive and continued to grow . therefore the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants were inversely related to those of mutant and rnai plants in response to cold and drought stress ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ tolerance to low temperature and increased tolerance to water deficit . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ ub ligase is a negative regulator of cold response and a positive regulator of drought response . this indicates opposite roles of _PROTEIN_ in cold and drought stress responses . we speculate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the negative cross talk between cold and drought responses . the cellular mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ participates in the converse regulation of cold and drought responses is currently unknown . additional experiments are required to identify the target protein of _PROTEIN_ and to decipher the links between cold and drought stress responses mediated by _PROTEIN_ .
