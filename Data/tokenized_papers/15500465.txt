for the efficient translocation of organic nitrogen small peptides of two to three amino acids are posited as an important alternative to amino acids . a new transporter mediating the uptake of di and tripeptides was isolated from arabidopsis thaliana by heterologous complementation of a peptide transport deficient saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant . _PROTEIN_ mediated growth of s. cerevisiae cells on different di and tripeptides and caused sensitivity to the phytotoxin phaseolotoxin . the spectrum of substrates recognized by _PROTEIN_ was determined in xenopus laevis oocytes injected with _PROTEIN_ crna under voltage clamp conditions . _PROTEIN_ not only recognized a broad spectrum of di and tripeptides but also substrates lacking a peptide bond . however amino acids amino fatty acids or peptides with more than three amino acid residues did not interact with _PROTEIN_ . at ph _PROTEIN_ had an apparent lower affinity for ala asp compared with ala ala and ala lys . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts showed that _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter demonstrated _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue throughout the plant indicative of a role in long distance transport of di and tripeptides .
