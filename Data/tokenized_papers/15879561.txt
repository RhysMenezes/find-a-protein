_PROTEIN_ a salt extractable kd wall associated protein that is associated with walls of etiolated maize seedlings and is recognized by an antiserum previously reported to label plasmodesmata and the _LOCATION_ was cloned sequenced and found to be a class reversibly glycosylated polypeptide . protein gel blot analysis of cell fractions with an antiserum against recombinant _PROTEIN_ showed it to be enriched in the wall fraction . rna gel blot analysis along the mesocotyl developmental axis and during deetiolation demonstrates that high _PROTEIN_ transcript levels correlate spatially and temporally with primary and secondary plasmodesmata formation . all four of the arabidopsis thaliana proteins when fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells display _METHOD_ patterns indicating they are _LOCATION_ and plasmodesmal associated proteins . localization to the _LOCATION_ apparatus was verified by colocalization of transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to cyan _METHOD_ protein together with a known _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ nucleotide sugar transporter fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in transgenic tobacco _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is punctate is present only in contact walls between cells and colocalizes with aniline blue stained callose present around pd . in plasmolyzed cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remains wall embedded whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can not be found embedded in cell walls . this result implies that the targeting to pd is not due to a default pathway for _LOCATION_ localized fusion proteins but is specific to . treatment with the _LOCATION_ disrupting drug brefeldin a inhibits pd labeling by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . integrating these data we conclude that are plasmodesmal associated proteins delivered to plasmodesmata via the _LOCATION_ apparatus .
previously we demonstrated that s immunolabeled pd and _LOCATION_ . because this antiserum was generated against a protein band from an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel it may recognize more than one protein that could be present in the band . furthermore this antiserum cross reacted with two additional proteins . a combination of experimental methods was used to molecularly characterize the protein or proteins recognized by s which targets to pd . in one approach we employed s to screen an _PROTEIN_ library generated using mrna obtained from meristematic tissues of d old maize seedlings . screening plaque forming units yielded clones recognized by s . hybridization experiments revealed that the isolated clones represent two hybridization groups termed and containing and clones respectively indicating that s identified two distinct proteins from the _PROTEIN_ library . in parallel purified _PROTEIN_ a salt extractable kd wap that was recognized by s was microsequenced yielding a amino acid sequence nldflgm ? rpffqpyhliivqdgdp . based on this sequence a degenerative primer was synthesized to allow identification of isolated clones encoding the _PROTEIN_ internal sequence . the degenerative primer was used in combination with a reverse primer from the library 's vector sequence in a pcr reaction to identify clones previously isolated employing the s antiserum and that encode a protein that contains the sequenced peptide . seven clones were identified all belonging to the hybridization group establishing that this hybridization group encodes the _PROTEIN_ protein . the insert lengths of the various clones belonging to were determined by an additional pcr reaction with primers complementary to vector sequences on both sides of the insert and the clone that had the longest insert was sequenced . the open reading frame of the insert encodes a protein containing amino acids with a calculated _METHOD_ of d matching the size of the kd wap . the predicted gene product contained the internal sequence previously obtained by _PROTEIN_ microsequencing confirming that the clone encoded _PROTEIN_ . the sequence of the maize gene encoding _PROTEIN_ protein was deposited in the embl and national center for biotechnology information data libraries . high sequence homology of _PROTEIN_ to members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family resulted in _PROTEIN_ annotation as an _PROTEIN_ protein . a representative of the hybridization group was sequenced and found to encode an aldolase protein . it remains to be seen whether this aldolase protein is pd associated or merely unspecifically identified by the s antiserum . work with clones in the group was not further pursued . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as a his tag fusion was used to immunize rabbits . the antiserum obtained from one rabbit termed _PROTEIN_ exhibited good immunogenic activity with the purified recombinant protein in protein gel blots . protein gel blot analysis with _PROTEIN_ of proteins from the soluble the membranal and the wall fractions demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is highly enriched in the wall fraction that contains embedded pd compared with the membranal and soluble fractions . the _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions are more weakly labeled suggesting lower levels of _PROTEIN_ association with these fractions . this protein gel blot analysis also verified that _PROTEIN_ antiserum recognizes the kd protein without recognizing the other major bands labeled by s . additionally _PROTEIN_ did not recognize aldolase . the formation of both simple primary and secondary pd and their modification to branched pd occurs primarily in meristematic tissues and in expanding and/or elongating tissues . if _PROTEIN_ is a pd associated protein it is expected that in etiolated maize seedlings its _PROTEIN_ should be highest in the mesocotyl node which is a meristem tissue and in a to cm region just below the node a region in which cells are undergoing extensive elongation . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ levels were compared in segments each cm in length along the mesocotyl developmental gradient . rna gel blot analysis using _PROTEIN_ cdna probe showed that _PROTEIN_ transcript level was highest in the region containing the mesocotyl node and the most extensively expanding cells and _PROTEIN_ along the mesocotyl developmental gradient . the correlation between cell division and mrna _PROTEIN_ level was further examined in a second experimental system . exposure of etiolated seedlings to light brings about a cessation of cell divisions in the mesocotyl meristem . rna gel blot analysis was used to examine the effect of light on _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ levels in mesocotyls of etiolated maize seedlings . after exposure to light _PROTEIN_ mrna levels _PROTEIN_ fold after h fold after h and fold after h . actin mrna levels displayed a similar _PROTEIN_ indicative of cell division cessation . further study was done with genes of arabidopsis because its genome has been fully sequenced and open reading frames annotated . the arabidopsis genome encodes four homologous genes termed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and which belong to . these arabidopsis proteins show high degrees of amino acid sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ . amino acid sequence analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ is the closest homolog of _PROTEIN_ sharing amino acid sequence identity . _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ to examine its intracellular localization . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells using agrobacterium tumefaciens leaf injection . confocal microscopy revealed _METHOD_ in several distinct sites inside epidermal cells . punctate paired _METHOD_ foci were detected on opposite sides of the cell pattern consistent with _PROTEIN_ being a plasmodesmal associated protein . _METHOD_ was also observed as small _METHOD_ foci throughout the cell cytoplasm which moved rapidly throughout the cytoplasm and along cytoplasmic strands through the _LOCATION_ in a manner characteristic of _LOCATION_ vesicles . _METHOD_ could also be seen in large amorphous areas inside cells apparently representing inclusion bodies resulting from the _METHOD_ quantities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced inside the cells during transient _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ was also detected in small areas inside cell _LOCATION_ . our supposition that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mobile foci represent _LOCATION_ bodies is supported by the report by citation in which it was shown that a pea that shares high sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ and atrgp proteins immunolocalizes to the trans _LOCATION_ apparatus . to verify that the mobile foci are indeed _LOCATION_ bodies _LOCATION_ nucleotide sugar transporter fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which has been shown to label _LOCATION_ bodies was employed . _PROTEIN_ when fused to cyan _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to examine whether plasmodesmal association is a general characteristic of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were constructed and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . these fusion proteins displayed _METHOD_ patterns identical to that presented by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in all respects except that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ levels were lower . these _METHOD_ patterns are consistent with _PROTEIN_ and being plasmodesmal associated proteins . the observation that all four arabidopsis appear to be plasmodesmal associated indicates that plasmodesmal association is a general characteristic of members of . transgenic tobacco plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of the promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus were generated . in these plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized in punctate _METHOD_ foci inside cell walls . this pattern is similar to that presented by transgenic tobacco plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fusion of a known pd marker the movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the cell wall at the base of a trichome is especially rich in pd . transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tobacco plants exhibit a characteristic dense punctate pattern where these pd are _METHOD_ marked . the same pattern is presented by the transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants supporting the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ localizes to pd . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen only in wall areas that contain pd where two cells are in contact whereas wall areas devoid of pd were unlabeled as demonstrated by trichome cells and spongy mesophyll cells . tobacco trichomes are hair like structures protruding from the epidermis surface consisting of a single file of several cells . therefore tobacco trichome cells have both pd containing walls those walls separating two cells and _PROTEIN_ walls that are only in contact with the air surrounding the trichome which are devoid of pd . spongy mesophyll cells likewise have regions with no cell cell contact where walls face an intercellular space and are devoid of pd and regions with cell cell contact where walls contain pd . _METHOD_ was detected only within cell wall regions where there is cell cell contact in both trichome cells and spongy mesophyll cells . this differentiating labeling of walls further indicates that _PROTEIN_ is associated with pd or with the wall sheath surrounding pd . to verify that the punctate _METHOD_ foci inside cell walls indeed represent pd we employed callose staining by aniline blue . callose has been widely used as a plasmodesmal marker . when leaves of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic tobacco were stained by aniline blue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly colocalized with the aniline blue stained callose present around pd . wild type tobacco not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when stained by aniline blue and photographed with _METHOD_ conditions displayed no _METHOD_ labeled pd . likewise transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic tobacco not stained by aniline blue but photographed with aniline blue conditions also displayed no _METHOD_ labeled pd . these negative control experiments verify that colocalization is not the result of _METHOD_ bleedthrough between _METHOD_ and aniline blue channels . in mature tobacco tissue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected in mobile bodies possibly because of the lower steady state levels present during stable _PROTEIN_ . plasmolysis of cells in leaves causes shrinkage of the cell protoplast and retraction of the pm from the wall with pd remaining embedded in the cell wall . plasmolysis was induced in leaves of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tobacco plants to learn about the association of _PROTEIN_ with pd . the _METHOD_ dye a cytoplasmic marker was used to allow better visualization of the receding cytoplasm and pm during plasmolysis . was transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells of transgenic tobacco plants stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ before they were plasmolyzed thus marking the cytoplasm of these cells . after plasmolysis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ clearly remained inside cell walls in regions where the cytoplasm became disassociated from both sides of the cell wall . this result demonstrates that the punctate sites are not within the cortical cytoplasm nor pm associated but are embedded in the cell wall . this is similar to the result obtained in plasmolyzed transgenic tobacco plants stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to examine if association with pd occurs for any stably _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ fusion protein through some default pathway _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic tobacco plants were generated . when these plants were plasmolyzed no _METHOD_ remained in cell walls . the presence of atrgp _METHOD_ fusions in both pd and the _LOCATION_ apparatus led us to hypothesize that are delivered to pd via the _LOCATION_ apparatus . brefeldin a a disruptor of the _LOCATION_ apparatus was used to examine this hypothesis . epidermal cells of tobacco leaves treated with bfa during transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were compared with cells not treated with bfa . bfa treated cells displayed a _PROTEIN_ in the numbers of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ bodies . _METHOD_ labeled foci containing labeled pd or clusters of pd in pit fields that are too close together to resolve individually were counted in five consecutive confocal sections representing the middle layer of each cell . on average bfa treated cells presented _METHOD_ labeled pd whereas mock treated cells presented _METHOD_ labeled pd . thus bfa treated cells displayed a _PROTEIN_ of approximately threefold in the average number of _METHOD_ labeled pd when compared with cells not treated with bfa . a paired sample t test showed results to be significantly different at p < . the _PROTEIN_ that the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled pd was lower in the presence of the _LOCATION_ disrupting bfa combined with the observation that _METHOD_ fusions of atrgps label the _LOCATION_ apparatus demonstrates that pass through the _LOCATION_ apparatus before their arrival at pd .
