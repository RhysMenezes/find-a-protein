in plant chloroplasts two superoxide dismutase activities occur fesod and cu/znsod with reciprocal regulation in response to copper availability . this system presents a unique model to study the regulation of metal cofactor delivery to an organelle . the arabidopsis thaliana gene _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional homolog to yeast a copper chaperone for sod . the _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to chloroplasts where it may supply copper to the stromal cu/znsod . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ levels are upregulated in response to cu feeding and senescence . we propose that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated to allow the most optimal use of cu for photosynthesis .
in analogy to the situation in yeast cu chaperones may exist which deliver cu to specific targets within the chloroplast . although the arabidopsis genome encodes many proteins with cys x x cys containing possible heavy metal binding domains our database searches revealed the presence of just two candidate genes encoding putative soluble proteins with a heavy metal binding domain and a putative chloroplast targeting sequence _PROTEIN_ . of these two genes one encodes a protein similar to the yeast cu chaperone for cu/znsod . earlier database searches suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be the only like sequence in arabidopsis and it has been speculated that the gene encodes gene products in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . the same protein had been identified as a potential homolog of however that clone lacked a significant portion of the n terminal sequence . we used rt pcr to obtain the full length protein coding sequence for _PROTEIN_ . sequence comparison of the cloned cdna and the published genomic sequence indicated the presence of exons and introns an organization that is shared with the potato homolog . the cdna sequence confirmed the exon assignment in the mips database and indicates that it encodes a protein of amino acids . a sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ with other predicted _PROTEIN_ proteins is shown in b . the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ includes a predicted amino acid cleavable chloroplast targeting sequence and similar sequences are found in the other plant _PROTEIN_ proteins . the predicted mature _PROTEIN_ protein shares a three domain structure typical of _PROTEIN_ proteins including a conserved _PROTEIN_ like domain with canonical mxcxxc binding motifs a central domain with similarity to a portion of cu/znsod and a c terminal region which includes two conserved cysteines . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ is a functional homolog of yeast the arabidopsis protein was _PROTEIN_ without its transit sequence in a yeast mutant . we tested for functional complementation by assaying the growth phenotype on media that lack lysine or contain the superoxide generator menadione and by assaying sod activity . an isogenic wild type strain and a mutant transformed with an empty vector were used as controls . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rescues both the growth defect phenotype and sod activity in the mutant . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is functional as a copper chaperone for sod in yeast . in order to investigate the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence for full length _PROTEIN_ protein was fused to the coding sequence for green _METHOD_ protein in a transient _PROTEIN_ vector under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus constitutive promoter . isolated arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed with this plasmid and analyzed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts transformed with control _METHOD_ exhibited _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ as shown in . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized in structures corresponding to chloroplasts when compared to red chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is imported along with the _METHOD_ passenger into chloroplasts . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using rna blots which indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ both in root and shoot tissues . a striking increase in _PROTEIN_ mrna levels was seen in shoots during natural senescence . to investigate the effects of cu feeding and _LOCATION_ cu levels we compared the mrna _PROTEIN_ in shoot tissue of wt and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under different conditions of cu supply . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are clearly induced by elevated cu levels . interestingly in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which accumulates cu in the stroma _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were induced at much lower cu concentrations compared to the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant . rt pcr experiments showed that treatment with other metal ions such as fe did not induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
