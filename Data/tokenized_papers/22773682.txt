a family of eight genes with homology to mammalian glutathione peroxidase isoenzymes designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been identified in arabidopsis thaliana . in this study we demonstrated the functional analysis of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with peroxidase activity toward and lipid hydroperoxides using thioredoxin as an electron donor . the transcript and protein levels of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis were up regulated coordinately in response to oxidative damage caused by high light _PROTEIN_ stress or treatment with paraquat . furthermore the knockout arabidopsis mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited increased sensitivity to oxidative damage caused by pq treatment in root elongation compared with the wild type plants . in contrast transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were less sensitive to oxidative damage than the wild type plants . the levels of oxidized proteins in the ko _PROTEIN_ and ox _PROTEIN_ lines were enhanced and suppressed respectively compared with the wild type plants under _PROTEIN_ stress or pq treatment . the fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ tagged with green protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ of onion epidermal cells . in addition the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions prepared from leaves of arabidopsis plants using the _PROTEIN_ antibody . oxidative dna damage under treatment with pq increased in the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants while it _PROTEIN_ in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the protection of cellular components including _LOCATION_ dna against oxidative stress .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of the soluble proteins from escherichia coli cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with the histidine tag showed _PROTEIN_ of a large amount of the recombinant proteins . the molecular _METHOD_ of this fusion protein was approximately kda which was in agreement with the molecular _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein plus the his tag predicted theoretically . by chelating hp column chromatography yielded the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein of apparent electrophoretic homogeneity . the purified protein was characterized by western blot analysis using a mouse antiserum raised against the _PROTEIN_ protein or the his tag . the _PROTEIN_ that the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ had homology with those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ led to the study of the cross reactivity of _PROTEIN_ antibody with other atgpxs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ antibody had a cross reactivity with the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein but not the other atgpxs suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ antibody recognizes an epitope specific for only _PROTEIN_ protein . the peroxidase activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ toward cumene hydroperoxide t buthylhydroperoxide linoleic acid hydroperoxide and linolenic acid hydroperoxide was not detected with gsh or nadph as a reducing agent . however _PROTEIN_ was able to reduce and hydroperoxides with the e. coli trx as a reducing agent . the vmax value of _PROTEIN_ for was nmol protein which was approximately higher than those for cumooh and linolenic acid hydroperoxide respectively . double reciprocal plots of vs. for were linear and reproducible for the _PROTEIN_ enzyme . the km value for trx of e. coli at a fixed concentration of mm was while the km value for at a fixed concentration of trx was . the steady state transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were detected in the leaves of arabidopsis plants grown for weeks under normal growth conditions . since the _PROTEIN_ of several plant gpx genes was up regulated under various stressful conditions we analyzed the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ as well as the other atgpxs in response to _PROTEIN_ stress or pq treatment under normal light . the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ were markedly increased and peaked at and h respectively after _PROTEIN_ stress and pq treatment . similarly the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were increased by stressful conditions . on the other hand the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were transiently or continuously _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ stress and pq treatment . in agreement with the change in the transcript level the levels of _PROTEIN_ protein were increased approximately and fold at h after pq treatment and at h after _PROTEIN_ stress respectively . as judged by targetp to predict the subcellular localization there was no transit peptide in the deduced amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ suggesting its _LOCATION_ localization . to verify the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ at the n terminus using the gateway _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . the transgenic cells introducing _METHOD_ were used as a control for the localization of _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was distributed in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of the onion epidermal cells . next we determined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves of arabidopsis plants by percoll gradient fractionation and western blotting using the _PROTEIN_ antibody . we used antibodies against histone and _PROTEIN_ as markers for the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ respectively . although a large amount of the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in the crude extract and the supernatant containing _LOCATION_ chloroplastic and mitochondrial fractions the protein was also detected in the precipitate containing the _LOCATION_ fraction . we isolated and characterized the knockout arabidopsis plants for _PROTEIN_ by a t dna insertion in the genes _PROTEIN_ from the signal project . sequencing of the t dna insertion sites of ko _PROTEIN_ revealed the t dna insertion in the fifth exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . by quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could not be detected in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants . subsequently western blot analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein of which the molecular weight was estimated to be kda was not present in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants . next we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and obtained its homozygous generations . by semi quantitative rt pcr analysis the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was found to be approximately fold higher in ox _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ protein in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants increased to approximately fold higher than those of the wild type plants . the ko _PROTEIN_ and ox _PROTEIN_ plants showed phenotypes similar to the wild type plants on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium or in soil throughout the growth period under normal conditions . to evaluate the effect of disruption or overexpression of _PROTEIN_ on oxidative stress tolerance we checked the tolerance of ko _PROTEIN_ and ox _PROTEIN_ plants to oxidative stress caused by pq treatments . as judged by the phenotypes and fresh weight the ko _PROTEIN_ and ox _PROTEIN_ plants showed _PROTEIN_ and increased tolerance respectively to pq treatments compared with the wild type plants . the root growth of ko _PROTEIN_ plants on _METHOD_ plates containing pq was severely inhibited compared with that of the wild type plants . on the other hand the inhibition of root growth of the ox _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly suppressed . a protein gel blot assay of oxidized proteins _PROTEIN_ was carried out to assess oxidative damage in the cells of ko _PROTEIN_ and ox _PROTEIN_ plants under _PROTEIN_ and pq stress conditions . the levels of oxidized proteins in the extracts from the ko _PROTEIN_ and ox _PROTEIN_ plants were higher and lower respectively compared with those of wild type plants . ros can cause dna strand breaks or to deoxyribose sugar and bases . formation of oxo dihydro guanosine is the most characteristic features of dna oxidation . thus the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the protection from oxidative dna damage in cells of arabidopsis plants was investigated by determining oxo dg contents in the dna . considering that _LOCATION_ dna constitutes the vast majority of dna isolated from the cells the levels of oxo dg detected here reflect _PROTEIN_ a status of _LOCATION_ dna oxidation . the levels of oxo dg in the wild type plants were increased by pq treatment . in the ko _PROTEIN_ mutants oxo dg was accumulated more than in the wild type plants even under normal conditions and was markedly increased by pq treatment . on the other hand the accumulation of oxo dg in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly suppressed under pq treatment .
