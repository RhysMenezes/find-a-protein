photosynthesis has shaped atmospheric and ocean chemistries and probably changed the climate as well as oxygen is released from water as part of the photosynthetic process . in photosynthetic eukaryotes this process occurs in the chloroplast an organelle containing the most abundant biological _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ of plants and some green algae are structurally inhomogeneous consisting of two _PROTEIN_ domains the grana which are piles of _LOCATION_ gathered by stacking forces and the stroma lamellae which are unstacked _LOCATION_ connecting the grana . the major photosynthetic complexes are unevenly distributed within these compartments because of steric and electrostatic constraints . although proteomic analysis of _LOCATION_ has been instrumental to define its protein components no extensive proteomic study of subthylakoid localization of proteins in the _PROTEIN_ and the stroma lamellae fractions has been achieved so far . to fill this gap we performed a complete survey of the protein composition of these _LOCATION_ subcompartments using _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractionations . we employed semiquantitative proteomics coupled with a data analysis pipeline and manual annotation to differentiate genuine _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae proteins from possible contaminants . about _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were shown to be enriched in either the _PROTEIN_ or the stroma lamellae fractions . overall present findings corroborate previous observations obtained for photosynthetic proteins that used nonproteomic approaches . the originality of the present proteomic relies in the identification of photosynthetic proteins whose differential distribution in the _LOCATION_ subcompartments might explain already observed phenomenon such as lhcii docking . besides from the present localization results we can suggest new molecular actors for photosynthesis linked activities . for instance most psbp like subunits being differently localized in stroma lamellae these proteins could be linked to the psi ndh complex in the context of cyclic electron flow around psi . in addition we could identify about a hundred new likely minor _LOCATION_ proteins some of them being potential regulators of the chloroplast physiology .
purification of _LOCATION_ subfractions started from percoll purified intact chloroplasts from a. thaliana leaves . the rationale for this approach was to minimize contamination by mitochondria which are largely removed from the sample during the isolation of intact chloroplasts . after chloroplast lysis in a hypotonic medium _LOCATION_ were solubilized with digitonin . after centrifugation at g the pellet was used for the purification of the inner grana fraction _PROTEIN_ following the protocol established by berthold et al . . the supernatant was washed and centrifuged at g to recover stroma lamellae . starting from g of arabidopsis leaves we obtained of chlorophyll for the stroma lamellae and of chlorophyll for the _PROTEIN_ . to obtain statistically reliable results three biological replicates were prepared and two technical replicates were generated for each chloroplast biological replicate . therefore six samples were produced for each of _PROTEIN_ stroma lamellae margin and _LOCATION_ fractions during the purification process . all the protein samples were concentrated on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between the stacking and the separating gels according to prior to lc _METHOD_ analyses that were performed using a ltq orbitrap velospro coupled to a nano lc system . as previously described in the context of the subchloroplastic localization of proteins spectral counting was used for relative quantification in order to determine the subthylakoid localization of identified proteins . different spectral counting measures can be obtained for a given identified protein group total number of _METHOD_ spectra corresponding to the identified peptides the number of _METHOD_ spectra corresponding to proteotypic peptides or weighted spectral counts . in order to accurately deal with peptides shared between different protein groups weighted spectral counts were used . indeed it was shown that distributing spectral counts of shared peptides based on the presence of unique peptides in a given protein group generated the best results . consequently we chose to calculate weighted spectral counts as suggested in abacus and used these metrics for subsequent statistical analysis . then both statistical and clustering analyses were performed in order to identify proteins that were significantly differentially distributed between the different subthylakoid fractions . in addition all identified proteins were thoroughly annotated with respect to their known or expected subcellular and subchloroplastic localizations and function for further data mining purposes . eventually proteins were identified from all the analyses performed . cross contaminations at the subcellular level was evaluated using analysis of the proteins identified from all the analyses performed and manual annotation or prediction of their subcellular localization . in good agreement with proteomic analyses previously performed on compartments derived from percoll purified chloroplasts spectral counting analysis of our data indicate that cross contamination with other subcellular compartments is very low . we also quantified the cross contamination of the subthylakoid fractions _PROTEIN_ using marker proteins associated to the stroma and envelope subcompartments the two other _PROTEIN_ subchloroplastic compartments . this was done using specific antibodies raised against marker proteins from the different subchloroplastic fractions _LOCATION_ . for each analysis three different biological replicates were tested . the level of cross contamination was qualitatively evaluated by direct comparison of the intensities of the signals arising from the fractions to be tested and those arising from a range of dilutions between and of purified fractions derived from other chloroplast compartments . data reported in supplemental fig . indicate an average level of cross contamination between and for all the purified fractions analyzed . overall stroma and envelope contaminations appeared to be lower than in the _PROTEIN_ fraction whereas a larger contamination by envelope proteins was detected in the stroma lamellae fraction . contamination of the stroma lamellae fraction with the marker from the stroma was found to be lower than . we next assessed the specific protein composition of subchloroplastic fractions using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analyses targeting known markers of the various purified subfractions . as shown in fig . a _METHOD_ blue staining of the proteins present in the different fractions and separated on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ identifies different polypeptide profiles when compared with that of intact chloroplasts or isolated _LOCATION_ . indeed as expected lhcii the major antenna complex of the psii was observed to be highly enriched in the _PROTEIN_ fraction while it was barely detectable in the stroma lamellae fraction . subunits of the _PROTEIN_ synthase complex _PROTEIN_ which are known to be present in the nonappressed regions of the _LOCATION_ could not be detected in corresponding lane of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with the absence of this complex in the grana stacks . both in _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae fractions we barely detected known abundant markers associated to other chloroplast subcompartments such as the rubisco _PROTEIN_ for the stroma or the phosphate/triose phosphate transporter _PROTEIN_ for the envelope . the enrichment of specific complexes in purified stroma lamellae and _PROTEIN_ fractions was further confirmed by western blot analyses using specific antibodies . fig . shows that a chlorophyll protein associated with psii was largely enriched in the _PROTEIN_ fraction when compared with the _LOCATION_ or the intact chloroplasts fractions . by contrast no could be detected in the stroma lamellae fraction . _PROTEIN_ and psad components of the _PROTEIN_ synthase fi and of psi respectively were found both in the _LOCATION_ and in the chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ and psad were enriched in the stroma lamellae while being largely diminished in the _PROTEIN_ fraction . as our objective was to obtain accurate data about subthylakoid localization we then assessed the presence of stroma lamellae enriched complexes in the _PROTEIN_ and vice versa using the same western blotting approach . we found that > of the psad subunit was localized in the _PROTEIN_ . however numbers became smaller in the case of another psi subunit _PROTEIN_ suggesting a possible heterogeneity at the level of this complex . on the other hand less than of the psii complexes were located in the stroma lamellae . this indicates that as expected from previous studies none of the major photosynthetic complexes were exclusively localized in a single compartment _PROTEIN_ . however a clear enrichment of the major complexes in one compartment is seen . this was further confirmed by measuring the _METHOD_ spectra of the different fractions at cryogenic temperatures . at variance with room temperature psi _METHOD_ becomes visible at . therefore three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emission peaks were detected in the red region of the visible spectrum upon excitation of purified _LOCATION_ with blue light . the first two peaks represent _METHOD_ emission from psii while the large _METHOD_ peak seen at nm _METHOD_ from psi . the two psii peaks were barely detectable in the purified stroma lamellae fraction and the psi _METHOD_ peak alone turned out to be extremely reduced in the purified _PROTEIN_ fractions when compared with the _LOCATION_ . in no case was emission from energetically uncoupled chlorophyll observed indicating that no damage to the two _METHOD_ was induced by our purification protocol . measurements of the chlorophyll a/b ratio and oxygen evolution capacity of the different fractions also confirmed the successful separation of the two fractions . the chlorophyll a/b ratio of _PROTEIN_ fraction turned out to be much lower than that of _LOCATION_ and stroma lamellae consistent with the well established notion that chlorophyll b is accumulated in the psii antenna because it is _PROTEIN_ contained in the lhcii complexes . measurements of oxygen evolution in presence of exogenous electron acceptors showed that our _PROTEIN_ preparation retained most of the evolution capacity of the starting material _LOCATION_ while no oxygen evolution was detectable in the stroma lamellae fraction . this confirmed the large enrichment of psii in the _PROTEIN_ preparations when compared with the stroma lamellae . in conclusion western blot cryogenic temperature _METHOD_ oxygen evolution and assessment of the chlorophyll a/b ratios analyses indicate that cross contaminations between stroma lamellae and _PROTEIN_ fractions or their contamination by other chloroplast compartments were low enough to justify a _METHOD_ based analysis of the subthylakoid localization of the proteins embedded in the photosynthetic _LOCATION_ . the present study allowed the identification of proteins . we first evaluated the coverage of the chloroplast _LOCATION_ proteome by combining present data with earlier large scale analyses targeted to the chloroplast . to this aim we compared proteins identified during this work with those previously reported by ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ and zybailov et al . that is two extensive studies performed at the whole chloroplast level where similar numbers of proteins were identified . these previous chloroplast data and present results were collated to obtain a total of nonredundant proteins . the overlap of the present study with the other data shows that the _PROTEIN_ database contained more than proteins that were not identified during the study of zybailov et al . . this could be easily explained by the specific enrichment _PROTEIN_ resulting from the purification of the envelope fraction that was specific to the study of ferro et al . and allowed detection of minor chloroplast envelope proteins . when compared with previous large scales proteomic analyses targeting the chloroplast of the proteins identified in the _LOCATION_ fractions novel proteins were identified in the present study . most of them were identified with some of the lowest spectral count measures and often detected in only one of the fraction . in order to estimate the proportion of the proteins that are genuine chloroplast proteins we analyzed their subcellular and subchloroplastic localization using data from the literature and targeting prediction tools . about proteins which are known to be major components of other cell compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were classified as cross contaminants . however more than one third of these proteins are either known or predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast and few more proteins while lacking a predicted targeting peptide are genuine chloroplast proteins . finally many other proteins while also lacking a predicted targeting peptide were never detected in another cell compartment using previous proteomic approaches targeting the other cell compartments cited above . thus some of these proteins may clearly be genuine chloroplast components that could be detected here thanks to the combination of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractionation and the improved sensitivity of state of the art _METHOD_ spectrometers . among those proteins only were previously identified in studies aimed at the characterization of _LOCATION_ proteomes . we next compiled the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ proteome studies which correspond to four types of investigations targeting different _LOCATION_ fractions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lumen whole _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ stroma lamellae . a set of proteins was collated . in order to determine what is the minimal _LOCATION_ proteome as defined from proteomics experiments successive different levels of curation were applied . based on present curated annotations we removed contaminant proteins _PROTEIN_ . referring to mapman classes we also removed proteins that belong to classes for which proteins are acknowledged to be localized either in other chloroplast compartments that is stroma and envelope or in other subcellular compartments . these mapman classes are the following ones calvin cycle dna envelope transporters glycolysis mitochondria electron transport mitochondria transporters protein aa activation protein synthesis rna processing rna transcription rna.rna binding starch metabolism and tca . proteins that belong to the class ps/light reaction were labeled as _LOCATION_ proteins . we also labeled as _LOCATION_ proteins those that were identified in the _LOCATION_ with a percentage of occurrence in our _PROTEIN_ database . in addition proteins that were annotated in supplemental table to be ch/th were labeled as being _LOCATION_ proteins . proteins being annotated to be located in either in the stroma or the envelope were referred as nonthylakoid proteins . remaining proteins were labeled unknown. thus from the present annotation of _LOCATION_ proteomes one can consider that proteins are true _LOCATION_ proteins . besides proteins are potentially _LOCATION_ proteins but for those proteins less biological evidences are available . therefore about half of the proteins collected can be considered to be contaminants either from other subcellular compartments or from other subchloroplastic fractions . although this number _METHOD_ important it has to be relativized with respect to the actual amount of each protein identified in a given fraction . moreover when considering those proteomic analyses of _LOCATION_ fractions it is obvious that some contaminants from the stroma are difficult to avoid . analysis of the compilation of major _LOCATION_ proteomes indicate that proteins were not identified in previous _LOCATION_ proteomics investigations . among those identified proteins were known to be located or partly located in _LOCATION_ and proteins were annotated for not having determined subchloroplastic localization . the latter class of proteins is particularly interesting as it potentially gathers new _LOCATION_ proteins . indeed cross contamination analysis suggests that these proteins are very likely to be new chloroplast proteins as contamination from other subcellular compartments is very low and results from abundant and well known proteins _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . however the actual localization of those chloroplast proteins at the subchloroplastic level needs additional information to be collected . thus from the comparison with chloroplast and _LOCATION_ proteome identified during previous studies we decided to extract potential new _LOCATION_ proteins . from the proteins specifically identified in the present study compared with chloroplast and _LOCATION_ proteomes we filtered out the most likely contaminants from other cell and chloroplast compartments . an eventual set of proteins was retrieved . we chose to perform a detailed analysis of those potentially new _LOCATION_ proteins that were identified during this work . most of these proteins were never detected using recent large scale proteomic analyses and are thus expected to be low abundant proteins in the chloroplast or in other cell compartments contaminating the purified _LOCATION_ fractions . to classify these proteins we first used targeting prediction tools and database annotations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for the analysis of their subcellular and subplastidial localization . we also screened the literature and other databases to extract information about the available protein descriptions and functions . out of these proteins were predicted to be targeted to _LOCATION_ using both chlorop and targetp targeting prediction tools most of them being thus also annotated as putative _LOCATION_ proteins in the _PROTEIN_ database . we thus considered that these proteins were indeed good candidates for new chloroplast and _LOCATION_ components . we then carefully analyzed the remaining proteins and selected an additional set of proteins that could also be associated to the list of these new chloroplast components these proteins being predicted to contain a chloroplast transit peptide using either chlorop or targetp or already classified as _LOCATION_ protein in _PROTEIN_ or for very few proteins experimentally associated to the chloroplast in more targeted studies . a detailed analysis of these proteins allowed supporting this classification . for instance the _PROTEIN_ is chloroplast encoded and thus does not contain a predictable chloroplast transit peptide . the dynamin like protein _PROTEIN_ an outer chloroplast envelope protein is according to the predictions also devoid of a chloroplast transit peptide like most outer envelope proteins . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ coordinates the division machineries of the inner and outer chloroplast _LOCATION_ through interaction with _PROTEIN_ in the intermembrane space . as another example a caax like protease did not appear in our list of chlorop positive proteins . however checking the other putative gene models in tair revealed that one of the caax like gene models is predicted to contain a chloroplast transit peptide using this chlorop software . consequently out of the new proteins identified here at least of them might be genuine _LOCATION_ proteins . very few of the remaining proteins could be further considered for a tentative chloroplast localization because most of them are either totally unknown proteins or only contain domains that allow to suspect or predict a putative function such as proteases phosphatases kinases transporters tpr or _PROTEIN_ proteins . in conclusion bioanalysis of the present results together with previous chloroplast and _LOCATION_ proteomic analyses indicate that a core of well characterized _LOCATION_ proteins have been identified in chloroplast or _LOCATION_ proteomic studies so far . in addition from this data collection we showed that we identified at least a hundred potential new _LOCATION_ proteins as discussed below . the present work is the first study aimed to specifically address the accurate proteomic based localization of _LOCATION_ proteins in the two major _LOCATION_ substructures _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae . the _PROTEIN_ goal of the present study was to provide reliable data for a better understanding of the respective role of these compartments especially with respect to ps protein complexes . the discovery of proteins that are more enriched in _PROTEIN_ compared with stroma lamellae raises the question of how it is possible to differentiate genuine grana and stroma lamellae proteins from possible contaminants . the issue of protein differential abundance is similar to the discovery of differentially _PROTEIN_ genes as revealed by microarray gene _PROTEIN_ analyses . from the plethora of hypothesis testing _METHOD_ proposed we decided to perform the differentially abundance analysis using limma of q . this results in a number of proteins that are differentially distributed between grana and stroma lamellae . among them the proteins with logfc > are more abundant in stroma lamellae whereas those with logfc < are more abundant in _PROTEIN_ . based on these results we could identify proteins more abundant in _PROTEIN_ compared with stroma lamellae and proteins more abundant in stroma lamellae than in _PROTEIN_ . the same approach was used to test an additional fraction that was purified in our samples that is the _PROTEIN_ margins and end _LOCATION_ . this fraction is defined as the portion of the appressed _LOCATION_ in contact with the stroma and according to previous studies represents an essential compartment for photosynthetic activity . when performing differentially abundance analysis between margin fraction samples and _PROTEIN_ samples we identified a number of differentially abundant proteins among which are more abundant in margins . however most of them proteins were also enriched in stroma lamellae when compared with _PROTEIN_ . the remaining differentially abundant proteins were more enriched in _PROTEIN_ samples and among those proteins of them are also found as being more abundant in _PROTEIN_ when compared with stroma lamellae samples . overall only proteins are found as being more abundant in margins compared with stroma lamellae samples from which only five appear not to be significantly distributed in _PROTEIN_ or stroma lamellae when _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae were compared . from these results we can conclude that the vast majority of proteins have similar representation in the stroma lamellae and in the margins samples . indeed the lists of differentially abundant proteins found as being more abundant in stroma lamellae and margins respectively when compared with _PROTEIN_ enriched proteins contain common proteins . in addition there are few proteins that are more abundant in margins than in stroma lamellae . two explanations can be proposed for this finding . first the purification of pure margin fraction is an extremely difficult task because of their physico chemical properties which are very similar to those of the stroma lamellae . second margins are likely to have a protein composition that strongly reminds that of the stroma lamellae . being nonappressed regions of the grana the margins are likely to host proteins that can not be retrieved in the stacks because of their bulky stromal exposed parts . therefore we concluded that the present study does not allow determining accurately the margin proteome . we further explored the proteins distribution among _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae in order to reveal groups of proteins with similar abundance in _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae . thus cluster analysis was performed on the _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae relative mean abundances calculated as the mean value across the samples in each group divided by the mean abundances across the _LOCATION_ samples . the decision upon the number of clusters was taken by analyzing both the goodness of fit as well as the stability of a wide range of clustering solutions . by doing so we ensured that the chosen solution would both find the data structures that best fit the actual data in _METHOD_ of intergroup separability and cohesion and would reveal the most stable data structures . finally we partitioned the proteins into seven clusters which are discussed in the following section . in addition the clustering algorithm its tuning and validation are thoroughly described in the materials and methods section . in conclusion an _PROTEIN_ statistical analysis showed that numerous proteins differentially distributed in either _PROTEIN_ or stroma lamellae fractions could be identified whereas the margin fraction was characterized by a very low number of significantly distributed proteins . as described above differential analysis between _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae samples allowed to point out proteins which were enriched either in _PROTEIN_ or stroma lamellae fractions . however a significant fraction represents contaminating proteins that were differentially found in the _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae because of differential contaminations of these two fractions by stroma or chloroplast envelope proteins . as discussed above this leads to a mixed list of proteins that are genuinely enriched either in the _PROTEIN_ or in the stroma lamellae fractions along with stroma or chloroplast envelope proteins that are differentially contaminating the purified _LOCATION_ fractions . in addition exploring the data by cluster analysis provides a complementary view on the way that the proteins group based on their relative abundance in _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae . cluster analysis has been performed for exploratory reasons and has been conducted in parallel with differentially abundance analysis in order to observe whether we could identify at first glance additional groups of proteins known to have the same chloroplastic localization . the _PROTEIN_ gain added by cluster analysis is to validate the results obtained by differentially abundance analysis in the sense that many proteins identified as being differentially abundant in one compartment were also found as grouping together in a natural way by cluster analysis . the partition of proteins based on cluster analysis is available in supplemental table and supplemental table column _PROTEIN_ cluster/thy proteins . in addition the composition of clusters can be visualized in supplemental fig . . thus cluster contains proteins with a high relative abundance both in stroma lamellae and _PROTEIN_ fractions meaning that it contains the major _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae proteins . as shown in fig . the proteins within this cluster are spread both on the left and the right hand side of the volcano plot . proteins of this cluster that are members of the psi and psii _METHOD_ the cytochrome and the _PROTEIN_ synthase complexes will be particularly discussed . on the contrary the proteins grouped within cluster exhibit low relative abundance both in _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae . therefore most of them could be considered minor proteins within these compartments . the proteins within clusters and appear to be stroma lamellae specific proteins which present low relative abundance in _PROTEIN_ the four clusters are separated according to their relative abundance in stroma lamellae the proteins in cluster exhibiting the highest relative abundance whereas the proteins in cluster the lowest . clusters and contain stroma lamellae specific proteins with medium relative abundance . note that in fig . the dots associated to the colors of these clusters are located on the right hand side which corresponds to proteins enriched in the stroma lamellae fraction as identified by the significance analysis of differentially abundance for _PROTEIN_ versus stroma lamellae case . an interesting cluster is cluster which concentrates _PROTEIN_ enriched proteins which were not or hardly detected in stroma lamellae . indeed in fig . these proteins are located in the left hand side which corresponds to _PROTEIN_ proteins . functional analysis of cluster proteins shows that most of them are proteins related to chloroplast transcription . all these proteins are annotated in the literature to be _PROTEIN_ located in the stroma . however the identification of nucleoid proteins in _PROTEIN_ fractions is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that nucleoids are known to be located at the center of the chloroplast in close vicinity to the _LOCATION_ in mature chloroplasts . in addition liu and rose showed that nucleoids co fractionate with the _LOCATION_ and that a region of the chloroplast dna is bound to the _LOCATION_ . the present study shows that nucleoids are specifically and exclusively bound to _PROTEIN_ domains . in order to be able to remove cross contaminants deriving from stroma and envelope compartments we performed a curated annotation of the proteins that show a differential localization in the _PROTEIN_ or the stroma lamellae fractions to provide a detailed analysis of their subchloroplastic localization . the protein names their function or presence in a specific protein complex were carefully determined as well as their subcellular and subchloroplastic localizations that were deduced from the screening of the literature using previously known published information _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or from predictions using bioinformatics tools . after removing proteins that are well known major components of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the tonoplast the _LOCATION_ or the mitochondria proteins that were previously associated to the stroma or the envelope compartments proteins from cluster and additional stromal ribosomal proteins proteins were identified as being differentially distributed in _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae fractions . thus and _LOCATION_ proteins were found to be more abundant in _PROTEIN_ and in stroma lamellae fractions respectively . these results both confirm current knowledge about localization of some classes of proteins and bring new insight over the protein content of _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae as discussed in the following sections . in order to get a better understanding on the differential subunits composition and distribution of the photosynthetic complexes in the fractions we analyzed further the results obtained from differential analysis . data obtained allowed us to corroborate the biochemical data concerning the differential localization of these complexes and to test possible differences in every complex between _LOCATION_ fractions analyzed here . in particular the logfc value could be associated to the enrichment of a given protein in either _PROTEIN_ or stroma lamellae fractions . we exploited this information to determine the relative subunit composition and abundance for four different photosynthetic maxi complexes . fig . presents the results obtained in the case of the major components of the photosynthetic chain . two different color gradations were used there to indicate enrichment in the _PROTEIN_ or in the stroma lamellae fractions respectively for the four major photosynthetic complexes _PROTEIN_ synthase cytochrome psii and psi ndh super complex . subunits of the photosynthetic complexes that did not show differential localization are marked in black . the overall picture emerging from the present proteomic study is consistent with previous description of the localization of the _PROTEIN_ photosynthetic complexes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ psi and the _PROTEIN_ synthase complexes are accumulated in the unstacked stroma lamellae whereas psii is mostly found in the _PROTEIN_ stacks . the cytochrome complex is more ubiquitous although slightly more concentrated in the stroma lamellae . however a closer look at these data reveals an unexpected heterogeneity in the subunit composition of the different complexes . in particular within a given complex the localization of different subunits between the _PROTEIN_ lamellae turned out to be variable as clearly evidenced by the case of psi . as expected this complex accumulates preferentially in the stroma lamellae fraction . however not all its subunits show the same ratio between the stroma lamellae and the _PROTEIN_ fractions . for example the _PROTEIN_ subunit had a higher score for stroma lamellae than other nearby core subunits . this finding was confirmed by western blot analysis using specific antibodies showing that the amount of _PROTEIN_ found in the _PROTEIN_ samples is lower than in the case of psad . in principle this finding could reflect a purification artifact . some peripheral psi subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which also share with _PROTEIN_ the property of being enriched in stroma lamellae could have been differentially extracted by the two types of detergents used to isolate the _PROTEIN_ and the stroma lamellae leading to an apparent enrichment in a specific fraction . to test this hypothesis we performed experiments to analyze the sensitivity of these proteins toward extraction by detergents . _LOCATION_ were incubated with increasing concentration of digitonin or triton and the amount of proteins present in the supernatant and the pellet was compared . we focused on three psi subunits an intrinsic one _PROTEIN_ and two more peripheral ones _PROTEIN_ and found that they were all similarly extracted by both types of detergents . thus it appears that the differential enrichment of some psi subunits in the _PROTEIN_ and stroma lamellae fractions is not caused by a different sensitivity to detergent suggesting instead that the psi subunit composition may vary depending on its location in the _LOCATION_ .

transferred to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ which was blocked with dried milk in tris buffered saline containing triton x . to assess the purity of the samples antibodies raised against proteins associated to specific chloroplast subcompartments were used _PROTEIN_ at a dilution psad at a dilution _PROTEIN_ at a dilution _PROTEIN_ at diluition _PROTEIN_ at a dilution _PROTEIN_ at a dilution at a dilution and kari at a dilution . proteins were detected by ecl . to measure _METHOD_ emission spectra at cryogenic temperatures a small aliquot of the purified fraction was taken and loaded in the cuvette of a ccd spectrophotometer to measure _METHOD_ emission at k. _METHOD_ was excited with a blue _PROTEIN_ peaking at nm and emission was recorded between and nm using a diode array . spectra were normalized to the maximum peak _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . for _METHOD_ analysis of sample were loaded on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein extracts were concentrated on a band between the stacking and the separating gels . . protein content varied between and for the stroma lamellae and for the _LOCATION_ and between and for the _PROTEIN_ . the gel bands were manually excised and cut in pieces before being washed by six successive incubations of min in mm and in mm containing acetonitrile using a freedom robotic platform . gel pieces were then dehydrated with acetonitrile and

biological triplicates and technical duplicates . the dried extracted peptides were resuspended in acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by online nanolc _METHOD_ . peptides were sampled on a x mm pepmap precolumn and separated on a x mm column . the nanolc method consisted in a min gradient at a flow rate of nl/min ranging from to acetronitrile in formic acid during min before reaching for the last min . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data were acquired using xcalibur _PROTEIN_ . spray voltage and heated capillary were respectively set at kv and . survey full scan _METHOD_ spectra

collision induced dissociation in the ltq after accumulation of ions _METHOD_ . peak lists were generated with the mascot distiller version software _PROTEIN_ from the lc _METHOD_ raw data . using the mascot search engine _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spectra were searched against a compilation of the a. thaliana protein database provided by tair _LOCATION_ and a homemade list of contaminants frequently observed in proteomics analyses . both databases were concatenated with the corresponding _PROTEIN_ database in order to calculate false discovery rate . one missed trypsin cleavage was allowed and

database searching results and raw files were exported in the pride format and deposited to the proteomexchange server with identifier and doi and pride accession . lists of proteins and peptides can also be found in the supplemental data file . database searching results with annotated spectra can be visualized using the freely available prideinspector tool . total spectral counts and spectral counts for proteotypic peptides were retrieved from the irma filtered results for each of the _METHOD_ analyses . weighted spectral counts were calculated as described in abacus and were imported in r which is an open source statistical analysis environment . the raw quantitative data were converted into a _METHOD_ class object from the r package _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ class is derived from the eset class and mimics the _PROTEIN_ class used for microarray data . an _METHOD_ object contains quantified _PROTEIN_ data for _METHOD_ proteomic data as well as the experimental meta data and allows the analysis of quantitative _METHOD_ based data using advanced statistical tools implemented in r and particularly that of the proloc r package which takes as input objects of the _METHOD_ classes . raw quantitative data were subjected to some pre processing steps including missing value imputation log transformation and sample normalization in order to render it compliant with the basic standards of good quality data . note that within the whole pipe line dedicated to the quantitative data analysis all type of replicates for a given group _PROTEIN_ have been treated equally . quantitative proteomics data are well known for high rates of missing values . this _PROTEIN_ requires deeper consideration when trying imputing them . in the present study proteins were identified in four groups of samples _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . however not all proteins were identified in each individual group . for such proteins the quantitation algorithm associated a na value to all samples where that protein was not identified . the actual missing values were recorded for proteins that had been identified in at least one sample in a particular group and they were also assigned with nas . the proteins concerned are unlikely to be absent in a particular biological compartment as they have already been identified in at least one sample . according to in quantitative proteomics mvs can be explained by several potential _METHOD_ the protein/peptide is present at abundance the instrument should detect it but it is not detected or incorrectly identified the protein/peptide is present at an abundance that the instrument can not detect them and the protein/peptide is not present at all . mvs recorded as a result of and are called censored missing values and it has been shown that their simple imputation based on observed values is not appropriate leading to an overestimate of peptides abundance and to biased results . conversely if the mvs are recorded according to one can use the observed values for their imputation . thus depending on the nature of the mvs different strategies should be employed for their imputations . for mcar data one can use simple mvs imputation methods which rely on the observed values whereas for the censored data one strategy is replace the mv with the minimum value observed . our strategy for mv imputation was based on the above considerations . although different probabilistic models are proposed to separate between mcar data and censored data our approach is based on a statistical investigation of the data in order to verify whether the missing values are abundance dependent or not . to do so in each group of samples and for each protein we estimated the mean value of the nonmissing values and we visualized the distribution for all proteins . this provided useful information that helped infer whether the missing values are abundance dependent or not and provided guidance in declaring the missing values as being censored or mcar . the mvs imputation strategy consisted of replacing the censored mvs by the minimum value observed while the mcar mvs they were imputed using a nearest neighbor strategy which was implemented as a routine preprocessing in _METHOD_ . for the samples corresponding to the biological groups _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ the distributions of the log transformed abundances were examined in order to investigate about the presence of technical bias . for each of the groups of samples quantiles normalization was performed after the imputation of missing values implemented in the _METHOD_ r package . we employed the r package limma which implements a robust method for differentially abundance assignment widely used for microarray data based on linear protein wise models as well as an empirical bayesian model for robust estimates of protein wise standard _LOCATION_ . as the _METHOD_ class mimics the _PROTEIN_ class used for microarray data and as this latter is used as input object for limma it appears that any proteomics dataset converted into the _METHOD_ format is compliant with a limma use . the method in limma is based on a modified version of student t test where the standard _LOCATION_ are reduced toward a common value using a simple bayesian model . this means that when estimating the variable wise standard _LOCATION_ the model borrows the information from the other genes which leads to more robust estimates . as a consequence the model is well suited to assess differentially abundance for datasets with few samples . in a recent comparison study on the significance testing for small microarray experiments limma has been found as being the method that balances the best the number of true positives and false positives . within this comparison study the authors used experiments with small sample size ranging from to samples per group . the approach consists in first fitting a linear model to each protein and second estimating the corresponding moderated t statistic using the empirical bayes procedure . p values were calculated using the moderated t statistic . multiple testing corrections were then performed by adjusting the p values for multiple testing using benjamini and hochberg 's method to control the false discovery rate . we set the adjusted p value threshold for declaring a protein differentially _PROTEIN_ to meaning that the expected proportion of false discoveries in the selected group of proteins is controlled to be less than . for each group of samples _PROTEIN_ we derived a representative sample as being the mean over the six available replicates divided by the mean abundance values across the six _LOCATION_ samples in order to take into account for the difference in abundance of _LOCATION_ proteins . working with such relative abundance values will homogenize low and high abundant proteins providing that proteins more abundant in _PROTEIN_ with respect to stroma lamellae will not be sensitive to the actual protein abundance . as a consequence a number of proteins which were not identified in the _LOCATION_ samples were not considered . cluster analysis was performed using _PROTEIN_ a particular implementation of the k medoids algorithm . k medoid is one of the numerous variations of the extremely well known k means algorithm . this latter is implemented in the r package proloc as well as numerous more sophisticated _METHOD_ such as kernel k means spectral clustering or hyperspherical clustering . as methods to automatically assess the right number of clusters are still under development for the next version of proloc this point was tackled as described in supplemental_material . information about identified proteins were retrieved and compiled from the literature using _PROTEIN_ numbers or protein names and screening for recently published data from uniprotkb tair _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the ontological tool mapman which was specifically designed to cover plant specific pathways and processes .
