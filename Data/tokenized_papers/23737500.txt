_LOCATION_ invertases are highly _PROTEIN_ in young tissues and organs . they may have a substantial regulatory influence on whole plant metabolism as well as on photosynthetic efficiency . therefore they are emerging as potentially interesting biotechnological targets to increase plant _METHOD_ production especially under stress . on the one hand vis are well known as soluble and extractable proteins . on the other hand they contain complex n terminal propeptide regions with a basic region and a transmembrane domain . here we analyzed in depth the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ntpp by mutagenesis . it was found that correct sorting to the lytic _LOCATION_ depends on the presence of intact dileucine br and tmd motifs . _PROTEIN_ remains inserted into _LOCATION_ on its way to the lv and the classical sorting pathway _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is followed . however our data suggest that vis might follow an alternative _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ dependent route as well . _LOCATION_ anchored transport and a direct recognition of the dileucine motif in the ntpp of vis might have evolved as a simple and more efficient sorting mechanism as compared with the _LOCATION_ sorting receptor protein of kda _PROTEIN_ dependent sorting mechanism followed by those proteins that travel to the _LOCATION_ as soluble proteins .
vis typically contain long complex ntpps containing a dileucine motif an motif a br and a tmd . the subcellular localizations of full length _PROTEIN_ and n terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins were determined in arabidopsis protoplasts . both fusion proteins reached the cv confirming that the is sufficient for _LOCATION_ targeting . _METHOD_ only constructs failed to reach the cv but localized in the _LOCATION_ . similarly and also reached the cv but at an earlier time point . after h most of the had not yet reached the cv and localized in punctate structures . in all cases _METHOD_ could only be detected in the _LOCATION_ lumen and not at the tonoplast . citation investigated protein trafficking to lvs and psvs by using distinct _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . in their work the c terminal vsd of tobacco chitinase a _METHOD_ was used as a psv marker and the ntpp of barley aleurain _METHOD_ was used as an lv marker . here the co _PROTEIN_ of the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein and aleu _METHOD_ showed partial co localization in some punctate structures . such co localization was not observed with _METHOD_ chi . again no specific higher _METHOD_ densities were detected at the tonoplast indicating immediate processing of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in the acidic environment of the lvs . to determine the path followed by the _METHOD_ fusion protein time course localization experiments were performed with _METHOD_ fusion proteins as markers for the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . at h post transformation most of the fusion protein appeared in the _LOCATION_ network as confirmed by co localization with _METHOD_ . in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ network small punctate structures with _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ were observed _METHOD_ . at h post transformation the fusion protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ apparatus as well as in the _LOCATION_ of associated punctate structures . as demonstrated before most of the fusion protein was localized in the cv at h post transformation . in some of the protoplasts at h post transformation _METHOD_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ of punctate structures with variable size . although the exact nature of all these above mentioned punctate structures remains unclear and requires further investigations the major point is that the _METHOD_ is clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ of these structures visualizing the _LOCATION_ anchored transport of the _METHOD_ fusion protein . it can be speculated that some of the larger structures represent pvcs _PROTEIN_ pvcs or fused pvcs also termed small _LOCATION_ in accordance with the previously determined presence of _PROTEIN_ in pvcs . wortmannin is a well known stimulator of the formation of such small _LOCATION_ . wortmannin treatment of protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ showed the presence of punctate structures with _METHOD_ in their _LOCATION_ . in contrast such clear _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was not observed in wortmannin treated protoplasts transformed with an aleu _METHOD_ construct . overall it can be concluded that _PROTEIN_ remains intact and inserted into _LOCATION_ via the tmd in its n terminus until it reaches the tonoplast . to examine whether and aleurain follow an identical sorting pathway _METHOD_ and aleu _METHOD_ were transformed into protoplasts isolated from two _PROTEIN_ lines and wild type plants respectively . while the fusion protein was correctly targeted to the cv both in _PROTEIN_ and in wt protoplasts aleu _METHOD_ did not reach the cv in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts while in wt protoplasts the _METHOD_ was still detected there . however it should be noted that only very few _PROTEIN_ protoplasts showed _METHOD_ of aleu _METHOD_ suggesting that the majority of the protoplasts may have exported their fusion protein into the medium . taken together with the wortmannin experiments these observations suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and aleurain are targeted to the lv through the same classic pathway but aleurain trafficking depends on _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ trafficking does not . further examination was performed on the possibility that _PROTEIN_ could also follow an alternative _PROTEIN_ dependent pathway . it is known that the _PROTEIN_ subunit recognizes an motif while the _PROTEIN_ subunit recognizes a dileucine motif in mammals and in yeast . similar _PROTEIN_ subunits have been found in plants . thus was transformed into protoplasts isolated from an line an line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and from wt plants . aleu _METHOD_ was used as a control . as expected aleu _METHOD_ was correctly sorted into the cv in the mutant and wt protoplasts demonstrating that it travels through the classical _PROTEIN_ independent pathway . intriguingly fusion proteins showed a variable behavior . was correctly sorted to the cv in both wt and protoplasts . however in protoplasts it was _PROTEIN_ in punctate structures in the cv or showed an apparent _LOCATION_ localization . as type ii transmembrane proteins vis are believed to take the nin/cout orientation as predicted by the tmpred program . to examine which ntpp amino acids are involved in sorting to the cv we designed an extended series of mutants in by site directed mutagenesis and recorded their localization at h post transformation . in each case protoplasts were examined . as expected the partial loss of the tmd resulted in a _LOCATION_ localization . deletion of the first amino acids retained the tmd and as expected led to localization in the _LOCATION_ . this amino acid region was further explored by an array of specific deletion mutants as listed in table . deletions in the n terminal region greatly affected protein sorting . single deletions of and and removal of the dileucine motif and the diserine motif blocked the protein in the _LOCATION_ network . deletion of only one l or s in the dileucine and diserine motif resulted in partial obstruction as did changing into an alanine . importantly deletion of and did not affect sorting to the cv . the correct sorting of the deletion mutant suggests that the presence of ssd and llp motifs is more important than their exact location relative to each other . in conclusion the explored sequence contains features that partially resemble the well known dxxll dileucine based sorting signals a conserved sequence derived from protein sorting studies in mammals and yeast in which the requirement for the d and ll were found to be strict and the presence of s was not essential . of particular importance deletion of a like motif which was first considered to be crucial for sorting to the _LOCATION_ did not lead to disrupted sorting of . a chain of positively charged amino acids termed the br immediately preceding the tmd is needed for correct delivery of alkaline phosphatase to the yeast _LOCATION_ . a similar br is observed in the ntpp of _PROTEIN_ . deletion of all four arginines led to accumulation of fusion proteins in the _LOCATION_ in the majority of protoplasts . deletion of two arginines led to a delay in protein sorting with _METHOD_ present in punctate structures in approximately of the protoplasts . mutagenesis of two arginines to alanines resulted in partial _LOCATION_ localization . similar effects were found when or both were mutated into alanine . mutation of both prolines showed an _LOCATION_ localization in the majority of the protoplasts while others showed a correct _LOCATION_ localization . it can be concluded that at least two arginines are needed for sorting to the _LOCATION_ and the presence of two neighboring prolines _METHOD_ to contribute to the sorting efficiency . the motifs ndeg tits rarl and lwkl downstream of the tmd were also found to be involved in _LOCATION_ sorting . deletion of these motifs partially slowed down the delivery of proteins to the cv with about of the protoplasts showing _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . other amino acid regions have been investigated as well but it was found that they are not involved in the sorting process . however one noticeable exception is the intriguing glutamate stretch upstream of the tmd . two extra glutamate residues were inserted in this motif resulting in an apparent delay of delivering punctate structures to the cv . however it can not be excluded that this result could arise from altered protein stability and this requires further investigations .
