chloroplast avoidance movements mediated by phototropin _PROTEIN_ are one of most important physiological events in the response to high fluence blue light which reduces damage to the photosynthetic machinery under excess light . protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ is an isoform of the catalytic subunit of _PROTEIN_ which regulates a number of developmental processes . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ was involved in high fluence bl induced chloroplast avoidance movements we first analyzed chloroplast migration in the leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in response to bl . the data showed that _PROTEIN_ might act as a positive regulator in _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast avoidance movements but not in _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast accumulation movements . then the effect of okadaic acid and cantharidin _PROTEIN_ on high fluence bl response was further investigated in arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cells . within a certain concentration range exogenously applied oa or cantharidin inhibited the high fluence bl induced chloroplast movements in a concentration dependent manner . actin depolymerizing _PROTEIN_ /cofilin phosphorylation assays demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ can activate/dephosphorylate adf/cofilin an actin binding protein in arabidopsis mesophyll cells . consistent with this observation the experiments showed that oa could inhibit _PROTEIN_ binding to the actin and suppress the reorganization of the actin _LOCATION_ after high fluence bl irradiation . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants also exhibited reduced high fluence bl induced chloroplast avoidance movements . in conclusion we identified that _PROTEIN_ regulated the activation of adf/cofilin which in turn regulated actin _LOCATION_ remodeling and was involved in _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast avoidance movements .
the role of _PROTEIN_ in bl induced chloroplast movements was investigated first . it was clear that after treatment with high fluence bl almost all chloroplasts in dark acclimated wild type arabidopsis leaves moved to anticlinal walls parallel to the incident light . although chloroplasts also migrated to the anticlinal walls in the leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in response to bl the extent of chloroplast movement was far less than that in the wt . quantitative analysis of the chloroplast population revealed that on exposure to bl for min approximately of chloroplasts were located along the anticlinal walls in the wt whereas only approximately of chloroplasts were along the anticlinal walls in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . after extending the exposure time to min only of chloroplasts were located along the periclinal walls in the wt but approximately of chloroplasts could still be observed along the periclinal walls in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . next differences in bl induced chloroplast movements between wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis were further examined according to the changes in leaf red light transmittance . the results demonstrated that rl transmittance in both the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a rapid increase after min of treatment with bl . importantly after irradiation for > min with bl the rl transmittance in the wt was higher than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however all progenies of a cross between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wt col showed similar chloroplast avoidance movements as the wt . with using knockout plants of other _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ catalytic subunits we found that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed the same chloroplast avoidance movement response as compared with the wt . rt pcr results showed that the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significant lower in leaves than those of _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the data from the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser suggesting that the difference in the gene _PROTEIN_ level might be the _PROTEIN_ reason for the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast avoidance movement among highly similar _PROTEIN_ catalytic subunits . further we also investigated whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which has been confirmed to play an important role in down regulating photoactivated _PROTEIN_ was involved in chloroplast movements induced by high fluence bl . the results showed enhanced chloroplast avoidance movement in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which corresponded with the previous observation that the phosphorylation level of _PROTEIN_ was higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wt . the difference in the low fluence bl induced chloroplast accumulation movements between wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis was also examined . clearly the wt and the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a consistent _PROTEIN_ in rl transmittance in response to bl irradiation . however upon exposure to bl the short term increase in rl transmittance disappeared in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and moreover the magnitude of the _PROTEIN_ was greater than in the wt . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ might act as a positive regulator in _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast avoidance movements but is not involved in _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast accumulation movements . taking into account the _PROTEIN_ that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were involved in chloroplast movements in response to bl at the enhancement of chloroplast accumulation movements observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant treated with bl of might be ascribed to the attenuation of chloroplast avoidance movements resulting from the absence of _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast avoidance movements induced by high fluence bl we examined the change in the percentage rl transmittance of wt leaves in the presence of oa . the results showed that oa greatly reduced the increase in the rl transmittance of leaves induced by high fluence bl of and the inhibitory effects reached a maximum when oa was increased to or . it should be pointed out that oa did not affect the rl transmittance of leaves in the dark . a detailed analysis of the dose dependency was also conducted . it seemed that exogenously applied oa inhibited the high fluence bl induced chloroplast movements in a concentration dependent manner within the concentration range of . further study showed that high concentrations of oa appeared to have toxic effects on normal cell function because neither changes in the rl transmittance under low bl nor full recovery after turning off bl and washout of oa could be found . moreover cantharidin _PROTEIN_ showed a similar inhibitory effect on chloroplast movement in wt leaves . further we examined the chloroplast movements of the _PROTEIN_ mutant treated with oa under high bl exposure . it was clear that _PROTEIN_ of the presence or absence of oa irradiation with or bl for h increased the rl transmittance through the _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves by about or compared with the dark acclimated phase respectively . this consistency of increased rl transmittance between oa treated and untreated _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves implied that the effect of oa on chloroplast avoidance movements was due to the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ inhibitors displayed a similar effect on the rl transmittance as the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the difference between the wt and the mutant in the chloroplast avoidance movement response induced by high fluence bl was also examined . clearly in response to high fluence bl the time course of the increase in the percentage rl transmittance of leaves in the and _PROTEIN_ mutants was in good accordance with that in the wt . by using the selective _PROTEIN_ inhibitor tautomycin it was shown that exogenously applied and tautomycin did not affect the chloroplast movements induced by high fluence bl . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ was perhaps not involved in chloroplast avoidance movements induced by high fluence bl and that the reduction of these movements by oa might be due to its inhibitory effects on _PROTEIN_ . phototropins were initially found as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated phosphorylated protein under blue light . however the phosphorylation levels of _PROTEIN_ were not significantly different in the and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with wt arabidopsis . previous studies have demonstrated that organelles can move along essentially static actin via myosin motor protein or migrate depending upon actin nucleation and polymerization regulated by a couple of actin binding proteins . among these proteins adf/cofilin a small phosphoinositide sensitive actin binding protein has been confirmed to play a vital role in actin dynamics . therefore we investigated whether serine phosphatases were responsible for the activation of adf/cofilin through dephosphorylation in protein phosphatase regulated chloroplast movements . first we detected the phosphorylation level of adf/cofilin in arabidopsis leaves acclimated in the dark for h. using oa to inhibit the serine phosphatases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the results demonstrated that the dephosphorylation of adf/cofilin could be significantly suppressed by oa . furthermore experiments performed in protein phosphatase mutants showed that the phosphorylation level of adf/cofilin was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wt . however there was no significant difference in the phosphorylation level of adf/cofilin in the and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wt . after high fluence bl irradiation the phosphorylation level of adf/cofilin was increased and was in good accordance with that in the dark group suggesting that adf/cofilin activity might be modulated by bl signaling and _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylated and activated adf/cofilin constitutively . western blot analysis demonstrated that oa blocked the dephosphorylation of adf/cofilin . we thus investigated further the configuration of actin filaments in wt leaf mesophyll cell changes in response to high fluence bl in the presence of oa . numerous studies have demonstrated that the actin based _LOCATION_ plays a major role in the positioning and movement of chloroplasts and other organelles . it was shown that chloroplasts were surrounded by basket like structures of actin filaments that were linked directly or indirectly to larger actin cables . as shown in fig . a typical set of f actin structures formed a meshwork of actin cables around chloroplasts when wt arabidopsis leaves were kept in the dark for a long time . the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein labeled actin _LOCATION_ in leaf cells revealed two types of actin filaments one type of actin filament partially or completely encircled the chloroplasts forming a basket like structure and the other formed a network of fine actin microfilaments which derived from the bundles and extended randomly into the cytoplasm . the bar graphs show that approximately of mesophyll cells have both basket like structures and actin filament networks . after irradiation with high intensity bl the chloroplasts relocated their positions to the anticlinal sides of the cell . the configuration of actin filaments on the periclinal side changed the network of fine actin microfilaments in of mesophyll cells disappeared and the basket like structure around the chloroplasts was revealed . in contrast after treatment with oa the network of fine actin microfilaments did not disappear and seemed to merge into a meshwork formed by a couple of _PROTEIN_ actin cables in each cell in the presence of high intensity bl irradiation . in addition the basket like structure encircling the chloroplasts disappeared . therefore it was suggested that oa might inhibit the actin _LOCATION_ dynamics induced by high intensity bl . having established that exogenous oa was involved in the phosphorylation level of adf/cofilin and high intensity bl induced actin structure reorganization we then examined whether high intensity bl induced chloroplast avoidance movements are weakened in the absence of adf . in this study the time course of the change in rl transmittance was measured in adf mutant leaves in response to bl . the results demonstrated that the rl transmittance through wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves increased by approximately but there was less of an increase in rl transmittance in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves after treatment with high fluence bl . when the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were cross pollinated with the parental wt col all progenies showed similar chloroplast avoidance movements as the wt . the change in the percentage rl transmittance in response to low bl was similar in the wt and adf mutants . further study showed that the rl transmittances changes in oa treated _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves were similar to oa untreated group suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be necessary for high fluence bl induced chloroplast avoidance movements . since the phosphorylation level of adf/cofilin was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wt it is suggested that _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast avoidance movements through regulating actin _LOCATION_ remodeling by dephosphorylation/activation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in order to verify that _PROTEIN_ could regulate _PROTEIN_ cellular localization in response to high fluence bl the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was fused to the _METHOD_ reporter gene and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein predominantly localized to a network of _PROTEIN_ and long cytoplasmic bundles in wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant mesophyll protoplasts . interestingly after high fluence bl irradiation the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was randomly distributed in the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ mutant mesophyll protoplasts instead of a network which was inconsistent with the _PROTEIN_ cellular localization in wt cell in response to high fluence bl . further following transient transfection of _METHOD_ arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct we found that the distribution of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was consistent with that of the _METHOD_ fusion protein labeled actin _LOCATION_ with or without high fluence bl exposure . however after treatment with oa the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was approximately localized randomly in the cytoplasm of mesophyll protoplasts which was practically distributed inconsistently with actin _LOCATION_ in the presence of high intensity bl irradiation . therefore these results suggested that oa or reduced _PROTEIN_ activity might inhibit _PROTEIN_ binding to the actin _LOCATION_ after high intensity bl .
