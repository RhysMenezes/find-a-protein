salicylic acid is central for the defense of plants to pathogens and abiotic stress . sa is synthesized in chloroplasts from _PROTEIN_ acid by an isochorismate synthase _PROTEIN_ sa biosynthesis is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory feedback at _PROTEIN_ . genetic studies indicated that the multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter enhanced disease _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis is necessary for sa accumulation after biotic and abiotic stress but so far it is not understood how _PROTEIN_ controls the biosynthesis of sa . here we show that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with a marker of the chloroplast envelope and that _PROTEIN_ functions as a multidrug and toxin extrusion like transporter in the export of sa from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm in arabidopsis where it controls the innate immune response . the location at the chloroplast envelope supports a model of the effect of _PROTEIN_ on sa biosynthesis in the _PROTEIN_ mutant stress induced sa is trapped in the chloroplast and inhibits its own accumulation by autoinhibitory feedback .
free and conjugated sa accumulate in the leaves of arabidopsis after stimulation with uv light as described previously . surprisingly the increase in free and conjugated sa is not measurable in the chloroplast fraction . this might be explained by rapid export of sa from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm . thus we predict that _PROTEIN_ is located at the chloroplast envelope mutants with impaired _PROTEIN_ function are unable to export sa and therefore in these mutants sa is trapped in the chloroplast and inhibits its synthesis by negative feedback . to test this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ was localized by the stable _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants that were cotransformed with the chloroplast marker reca _METHOD_ . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ of mesophyll protoplasts resulted in reca cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapping with the _METHOD_ of chlorophyll in _LOCATION_ . in contrast the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ periphery while chlorophyll _METHOD_ and reca _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared at the _LOCATION_ center . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ envelope . the envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by the transformation of mesophyll protoplasts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants with the chloroplast envelope marker construct _METHOD_ allowing for colocalization . the _METHOD_ of red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ overlapped perfectly with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating a localization of the latter to the chloroplast envelope . the functionality of _PROTEIN_ as an sa transporter was tested biochemically in transport assays and using a genetic approach . first we loaded isolated chloroplasts with radiolabeled sa followed by immediate quantification . as expected an increase in sa uptake could only be observed in plants _PROTEIN_ eds after uv exposure or in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . no accumulation of sa was observed in chloroplast from _PROTEIN_ mutants . second to further support this finding we quantified the simultaneous export of sa and indoleacetic acid the latter used here as an unspecific control from loaded entire mesophyll protoplasts . in agreement with the results obtained so far only uv treated or _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed reduced sa export over the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ most probably due to enhanced chloroplast trapping . interestingly no significant difference was found for the iaa control substrate indicating a high degree of transport specificity . further evidence for a direct transport activity was obtained by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in bakers yeast . like other transporters _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to punctate raft like structures surrounding the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was also confirmed by _LOCATION_ fractionation . a wide overlap with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker h _PROTEIN_ was observed in _LOCATION_ fractions separated on suc density gradients followed by western blot analysis . a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location for _PROTEIN_ made it possible to test the transport of sa in whole yeast cells . however in analogy to chloroplast experiments export experiments were hindered by the rapid efflux of loaded radioactive sa from yeast cells . therefore sa loading assays were used . vector control yeast cells showed a negative net retention of radiolabeled sa indicating a strong endogenous efflux activity on the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however both hemagglutinin and _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ exported less sa than the vector control although only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transport was significantly different from the vector control . this finding indicates that _PROTEIN_ functions as an sa transporter at the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but in an uptake direction . as shown for protoplast assays the usage of iaa as an unspecific control in the same transport assay demonstrated _PROTEIN_ specificity for sa in yeast . in contrast to sa iaa was loaded into yeast cells arguing for the absence of an efficient iaa export system at the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or a different _LOCATION_ permeability or a compartmentation of iaa . in order to characterize _PROTEIN_ as a mate like transporter that is known to be secondarily energized _PROTEIN_ by proton gradients we repeated sa loading assays in the absence and presence of the ionophores nigericin and _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenyl hydrazone known to destroy proton gradients but with different preferences for other monovalent cations . both nigericin and cccp strongly revert negative net sa retention in vector control and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yeast into a net loading supporting that sa export over the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depends on an electrochemical most likely proton gradient . however the strong yeast endogenous sa efflux activity hindered demonstration of a secondary active mate typic energization of _PROTEIN_ in yeast using ionophores . in summary chloroplast protoplast and yeast experiments demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a facilitator of sa transport . demonstration of _PROTEIN_ functionality in the extrusion of sa would require the quantification of labeled sa exported from chloroplasts . however it was not possible to measure the export of sa from loaded chloroplasts because the labeled sa was very rapidly released by the _LOCATION_ during the washing procedure . therefore we searched for an alternative strategy that allowed us to increase sa levels in the chloroplasts and bypass the negative feedback regulation of sa accumulation . to that end a genetic strategy was designed whereby a chloroplast targeted ethanol inducible gene encoding a chloroplast targeted bifunctional chimeric protein referred to as sa synthase was engineered into _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . psas consists of isochorismate synthase fused to isochorismate pyruvate lyase from pseudomonas aeruginosa . plants harboring psas were previously shown to produce high levels of sa in the absence of any stimulus . one day after induction by ethanol sa accumulated to similar levels in leaves of both _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ plants . however the subcellular distribution of the newly synthesized sa differed dramatically . the chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ mutants contained increased levels of sa whereas basal levels of sa were observed in the chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ plants . sa can not be exported from the chloroplasts in the absence of functional _PROTEIN_ demonstrating the function of this mate like transporter in this process . our finding that both free and conjugated sa accumulated in chloroplasts of uv treated leaves or in untreated _PROTEIN_ mutants deserves a comment . so far although various _PROTEIN_ have been described in chloroplasts no sa conjugating system has been reported for this organelle . most of the sa is presumably converted into sa o _PROTEIN_ by an sa _PROTEIN_ likely to be located in the _LOCATION_ . for the other reported _METHOD_ of sa conjugates including methyl sa methyl sa o _PROTEIN_ and salicyloyl glc ester the site of conjugation is unknown . our results clearly show the occurrence of a conjugated form of sa in chloroplasts but further work will now be needed to determine the chemical nature of the conjugated _METHOD_ as well as the conjugating enzyme . taken together our results support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a mate like sa transporter located at the chloroplast envelope where it functions in the export of the innate immune signal sa . the lack of sa synthesis in _PROTEIN_ mutants might be explained by a possible autoinhibitory feedback regulation of sa biosynthesis in the chloroplast but the details of this inhibition remain to be determined . this study provides a long awaited answer to the question of the hitherto unknown function of the mate like transporter _PROTEIN_ in the control of sa during the innate immune responses in plants . it is important to note that plants obviously have recruited proteins such as _PROTEIN_ for the control of innate immunity at the chloroplast that have structural homologs in prokaryotes archea and lower eukaryotes . the regulation of _PROTEIN_ in response to the perception of a wide number of biotic and abiotic stimuli all leading to sa accumulation now warrants further studies .
