to characterize mda sized macromolecular chloroplast stroma protein assemblies and to extend coverage of the chloroplast stroma proteome we fractionated soluble chloroplast stroma in the non denatured state by size exclusion chromatography with a size separation range up to mda . to maximize protein complex stability and resolution of megadalton complexes ionic strength and composition were optimized . subsequent high accuracy tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis identified proteins across the complete native _METHOD_ range . protein complexes and assembly states above mda were resolved using hierarchical clustering and protein heat maps were generated from normalized protein spectral counts for each of the size exclusion chromatography fractions this complemented previous analysis of stromal complexes up to mda the oligomeric stromal proteome of arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts . mol . cell . proteomics . this combined experimental and bioinformatics analyses resolved chloroplast ribosomes in different assembly and functional states which enabled the identification of _LOCATION_ homologues of prokaryotic ribosome assembly _PROTEIN_ as well as proteins involved in co translational modifications targeting and folding . the roles of these ribosome associating proteins will be discussed . known rna splice _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as uncharacterized proteins with rna binding domains rnases and dead box helicases were found in various sized complexes . chloroplast dna was found in association with the complete heteromeric _LOCATION_ encoded dna polymerase complex and a dozen other dna binding proteins e.g . dna _PROTEIN_ topoisomerase and various dna repair enzymes . the heteromeric mda pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the mda acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ complex associated with uncharacterized biotin _PROTEIN_ carrier domain proteins constitute the entry point to fatty acid metabolism in leaves we suggest that their large size relates to the need for metabolic channeling . protein annotations and identification data are available through the plant proteomics database and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data are available through proteomics identifications database .
this study aimed to extend the chloroplast proteome coverage and examine mda sized assemblies . a summary of the complete work flow of the experimental and computational analysis is shown in fig . . intact chloroplasts were isolated from mature arabidopsis leaf rosettes and were lysed under non denaturing conditions . the lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation to remove chloroplast _LOCATION_ bound proteomes from the soluble fraction . size separation of the non denatured stromal proteome was then performed by _PROTEIN_ using a column that resolved up to mda complexes followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . several lysis media and _PROTEIN_ elution conditions with varying concentration nacl concentration and flow rates were tested for optimization of resolution and complex stability . removal of in the lysis and elution buffers led to the destabilization of high molecular weight complexes such as s ribosomes . _METHOD_ for runs at various nacl concentrations revealed a slight shift to _PROTEIN_ elution times with increasing ionic strength suggesting partial destabilization of protein interactions . however similar overall peak profiles were observed suggesting that the core complexes remained intact but that transient and weak protein protein or protein rna associations were destabilized at higher salt concentrations . based on these optimizations _PROTEIN_ fractionation was performed at a flow rate of ml/min using either buffer a or buffer b . a typical _PROTEIN_ chromatogram of the stromal proteome under native conditions is shown in fig . . the highest peak at fraction corresponds to the ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ holocomplex at kda that comprises of the total stromal _METHOD_ . five fractions for the _PROTEIN_ run with buffer a covering the _METHOD_ range of to > mda were designated as hm a and the remainder of the fractions were assigned as lm a spanning a _METHOD_ range of up to mda . the lm fraction covers the same native _METHOD_ range as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stromal proteome analysis whereas the hm fraction is complementary to this _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis . for the _PROTEIN_ run with buffer b we only analyzed and discussed the hm fraction . the proteins in the _PROTEIN_ fractions were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . each gel lane was excised into slices followed by in gel trypsin digestion and nano lc ltq orbitrap analysis of the extracted peptides using data dependent acquisition and dynamic exclusion in a work flow previously optimized for identification and quantification by spectral counting . _METHOD_ runs were analyzed and the search results and relevant associated information _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ were uploaded in the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ provides an integrated platform for comparing our protein identifications with other in house _METHOD_ based proteomics experiments annotated properties and published information . all _METHOD_ spectral data were made available via pride at http //www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ . it has been shown for lc _METHOD_ based analyses of proteomes that the number of matching _METHOD_ spectra here assigned as spcs correlates well with protein abundance if there is a sufficient number of spcs obtained per protein . to correct for spcs derived from peptides shared between proteins adjspcs were calculated as the sum of unique spcs and a proportional distribution of shared spcs . in addition the relative concentration for each identified protein in the hm range was calculated as the nsaf derived from adjspc weighted for the number of theoretical tryptic peptides with a relevant length . to increase the confidence and significance of the data sets in this study proteins that were matched to only one amino acid sequence were excluded from further analysis _METHOD_ . in total we identified proteins in the hm a lm a and hm b fractions _PROTEIN_ of which were not identified in our comprehensive total chloroplast proteome analysis _LOCATION_ in which proteins were identified . for the purpose of the current study we imposed an additional stringency demanding at least two different matched amino acid sequences per protein and at least two adjspcs reducing the new data set to proteins . the reason for this extra stringency is that low abundance proteins were the focus in this study and this extra filter reduced identification of non chloroplast proteins and false positives even if several novel chloroplast proteins were removed _PROTEIN_ proteins . following the grouping of closely related homologues and removal of non chloroplast proteins and chloroplast _LOCATION_ proteins we identified stromal proteins of which had a targetp predicted chloroplast transit peptide . of these stromal proteins were not observed in our previous analysis of those were in the hm set and were dominated by chloroplast ribosomal proteins various splice _PROTEIN_ and proteins with unknown function such as _PROTEIN_ domain proteins and dna binding proteins . in contrast the new proteins in the lm fractions had a variety of functions . thus the analysis of mda sized assemblies revealed low abundance proteins mostly involved in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . fig . compares the identified stromal proteins in hm a and lm a fractions . importantly there was only an overlap between these two data sets showing that _PROTEIN_ effectively preserved and separated specific protein complexes above and below mda . this overlap consisted predominantly of highly abundant proteins involved in primary _PROTEIN_ metabolism such as rubisco components . comparison of the distribution of functions of the non overlapping protein fractions showed a > fold enrichment in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ in the hm fractions at the expense of all other functions except for protein homeostasis components . table i and supplemental table list annotated functions and relative abundance of proteins in the hm sets . moreover the heat maps show the distribution for each protein across the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ range . excluding the proteins that were also found in the lm data set of the most abundant proteins are ribosomal subunits further confirming that the hm fractions are highly enriched with proteins involved in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . this enrichment is consistent with the presence of _LOCATION_ rrnas and _LOCATION_ dna in the hm fraction . the average relative abundance of ribosomal proteins across the hm fractions is and this will be used to assess the accumulation levels of ribosome associated proteins . the _PROTEIN_ elution profiles of proteins derived from nadjspc values across the chromatogram reflect the size range of complexes in which they participate as well as their quantitative distribution over these complexes . to obtain a global view of _PROTEIN_ migration protein profiles and to facilitate the identification of putative interacting proteins hierarchical clustering was used to group proteins that exhibit similar _PROTEIN_ elution trends . several _METHOD_ from clustering with different minimum thresholds for total adjspcs were analyzed . based on these tests we chose a minimum threshold of total adjspcs per protein this threshold minimized noise that might skew the linkages among correlated proteins . the resulting dendrogram displayed three _PROTEIN_ clusters namely cluster i cluster ii and cluster iii . the first two clusters are linked and they are both dominated by ribosomal proteins and associated _PROTEIN_ as will be discussed in the following sections . cluster iii is subdivided into cluster iii containing several ribosomal proteins and cluster iii consisting _PROTEIN_ of proteins that are starting to elute below mda . cluster iii included components of the rubisco complex chaperone ferredoxin glutamine oxoglutarate amidotransferase and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase which were well resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . many of the proteins that were grouped by hierarchical clustering coincided with known assemblies such as _LOCATION_ pdc and s ribosomal particles and accase . for instance the maize mitochondrial pdc was found to have an estimated _METHOD_ of about mda . similarly to the mitochondria pdc the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ localized pdc components clustered in the _METHOD_ range greater than mda . as we will show in more detail below the clustering further confirmed that _PROTEIN_ effectively separated stromal complexes . the remainder of the results will discuss the composition organization and function of the observed mda sized macromolecular assemblies . the spinach _LOCATION_ s ribosome consists of ribosomal proteins with and components comprising the and s complexes respectively . the majority of these proteins are homologous to bacterial s ribosome components but several are unique to the chloroplast _LOCATION_ and they are proposed to perform _LOCATION_ specialized ribosomal functions . psrp and associate with the s subunit whereas psrp and psrp associate with the s subunit . psrp interacts with the s particle in chlamydomonas reinhardtii arabidopsis and rice but is missing in spinach . psrp is synthesized as a polyprotein consisting of the mature psrp and the elongation _PROTEIN_ ts which might be post translationally processed to render various fused or independent proteins . arabidopsis orthologues for all but three ribosomal proteins were identified in the hm fractions accounting for ribosomal proteins . about and of the and s ribosomal components in arabidopsis are _LOCATION_ encoded respectively consistent with that observed in spinach . interestingly _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ encoded in spinach but has two chloroplast encoded genes in arabidopsis suggesting evolutionary divergence . several arabidopsis chloroplast ribosomal proteins that were identified are encoded by multiple genes . five of these namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ comprise two or three identical gene products . four of these protein groups are chloroplast encoded suggesting a possible regulatory role or _PROTEIN_ to specific conditions in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . in addition two paralogues each were assigned to _PROTEIN_ and to _PROTEIN_ and these related proteins were distinguishable by _METHOD_ analysis . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was found to be times more abundant than _PROTEIN_ . in addition one chloroplast and two _LOCATION_ genes encode for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis but only one paralogue was detected in this study . the ribosomal components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and psrp were not detected in this study or in previous published chloroplast proteomics studies on arabidopsis . one reason might be that they are short lysine and arginine rich proteins yielding small tryptic peptides that were not amenable for lc _METHOD_ analysis . another possibility is the location and function of these proteins in the ribosome where they could easily be detached . _PROTEIN_ is found comprising the top of the head of the s region in prokaryotic ribosomes . psrp has been found to be loosely associated with the ribosome and is detected at lower amounts compared with other spinach ribosomal proteins . to explore the assembly state of the ribosome and to co localize ribosome associated _PROTEIN_ we carried out a separate hierarchical clustering of all assigned ribosomal proteins translational _PROTEIN_ and ribosome biogenesis _PROTEIN_ with or more adjspcs . the left hand panel shows the complete dendrogram in which three clusters were distinguished with cluster a representing the s particle cluster b representing the s particle and cluster c representing the translating s ribosome . close ups of these three clusters with protein names are shown in the three other panels of fig . . protein components and _PROTEIN_ known/expected to specifically associate with the s particle are in blue and those part of the s particle are in black . proteins that have a function in ribosome biogenesis or translation but that are not an integral part of the ribosome are listed in red and italics . the s particle peaked in the mda range and the s particle peaked in the mda range whereas the s ribosomes peaked in fraction . northern blot analyses of rrnas for and s particles extracted from these fractions were consistent with these profiles . overall the protein and rna profiles of these ribonucleoparticles correspond to and s subunits s ribosomes and polysomes . we note that the ribosome associated _PROTEIN_ are substoichiometric to the ribosomal proteins and many were quantified with fewer than total adjspcs and they were therefore excluded from the clustering in fig . . however to show the distribution of these proteins across the hm fractions we show a heat map of all proteins in fig . . in the next sections we will discuss these ribosome associated _PROTEIN_ in more detail . the translation machinery requires the participation of ribosome associating initiation elongation and termination _PROTEIN_ as well as proteins aiding in ribosome recycling . translation initiation proceeds with the binding of the mrna transcript to a free s subunit followed by association of the initiator trna and the initiation _PROTEIN_ and together forming a preinitiation complex . we observed all three ifs with and being fold more abundant than . elongation ensues after binding of the mature s subunit to the preinitiation complex and subsequent release of the three ifs . several rounds of elongation of the nascent peptide proceed by alternating actions of ef tu which introduces new aminoacyl trnas into the peptidyl transfer center in the s ribosome and ef g which translocates the peptidyl trna after spontaneous peptidyl transfer occurs . during each round ef tu dissociates from the peptidyl transfer center upon _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis with the help of ef ts its nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ . a point mutation in the chloroplast localized ef g protein leads to impairment of chloroplast development within cotyledons but not in true leaves . aside from its function in translation the ef tu orthologue in maize _LOCATION_ was suggested to also serve as a chaperone during heat stress . additional translation elongation _PROTEIN_ include the _PROTEIN_ lepa and typa/bipa proteins in bacteria both have been shown to bind to the s ribosomes at the same site as ef g . in escherichia coli lepa is proposed to recognize ribosomes with mistranslocated trnas and induce back translocation for corrective retranslocation . the bacterial and plant typa/bipa appear to be particularly important under stress conditions . the elongation _PROTEIN_ detected in the hm fractions are ef tu ef g ef ts lepa and typa/bipa . these elongation _PROTEIN_ have different _PROTEIN_ elution profiles but they were mostly found in the mda range and were most likely associated with s ribosomes or polysomes . the primary elongation _PROTEIN_ ef tu was an abundant protein and was seen as a broad peak across all five fractions . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of stroma showed ef tu migrating at multiple native _METHOD_ . typa/bipa lepa and psrp exhibited similar accumulation levels at about of the ribosome . the pets which harbors the ef ts domain fused to psrp peaked in the mda range . cryoelectron microscopy structure analysis and genetic and biochemical studies have shown that psrp is a translation _PROTEIN_ rather than an integral ribosomal protein . psrp contacts the space between the and s subunits thereby stabilizing the s ribosome and is proposed to be involved in translation regulation during stress . psrp clustered with the s particle and s ribosomes supporting its role as a translation _PROTEIN_ . translation termination occurs after release _PROTEIN_ which recognize the stop codon bind to the ribosome . ribosome recycling then occurs wherein a ribosome recycling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binds to post termination complexes and in coordination with ef g splits the s ribosomes for the next round of translation . no rfs and _PROTEIN_ were observed in the hm fraction but arabidopsis orthologues of and _PROTEIN_ were found in lm a fractions . during translation the nascent polypeptide chain that extends out of the peptidyl exit tunnel of the s ribosome is subjected to n terminal modifications as well as protein folding . proteins involved in such co translational activities were indeed found in fractions with s ribosomes . these include the enzymes peptide deformylase and methionine aminopeptidase the chloroplast signal recognition particle _PROTEIN_ and trigger _PROTEIN_ . pdf and map are hydrolytic enzymes that together perform co translational n terminal methionine removal . pdf removes all n formyl groups exposing the amino group of the first methionine a prerequisite for the subsequent action of map . two pdfs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been found in arabidopsis but only _PROTEIN_ shown to be dually targeted to the chloroplast and mitochondria in arabidopsis was observed in this study . several map proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exist in plants and the chloroplast localized _PROTEIN_ was found in this study . in co translational protein targeting nascent polypeptides with hydrophobic domains are recognized by the signal recognition particle and they are then targeted as a ribosome nascent chain complex to _LOCATION_ . the chloroplast sorting component _PROTEIN_ has a role in post translational targeting of _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ proteins and has also been implicated in co translational targeting and consistently was detected in this study peaking with ribosomes at the mda range . in addition polypeptides are being folded as they emerge from the peptide exit tunnel . the e. coli tf binds to the s exit tunnel and prevents misfolding and aggregation of emerging nascent proteins . a kda tf with conserved domains and a kda truncated form of tf were identified with the s ribosomal subunits . the kda full length tf protein was fold more abundant than the truncated form . chloroplasts contain two dominant protein chaperones _METHOD_ namely the and the _PROTEIN_ system . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are abundant proteins with a broad substrate pool and their abundance was constant across all the hm a fractions consistent with their wide range of substrates . the nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ grpe showed a similar distribution . based on information about e. coli homologues it is quite likely that _PROTEIN_ also functions in co translational folding thereby assisting the tf protein . the formation of a functional ribosome from more than proteins and four rrna molecules entails a complex series of coordinated processes including processing and modification of ribosomal components assembly and maturation . several arabidopsis orthologues of bacterial ribosome assembly _PROTEIN_ were identified in the hm a fractions . most of these proteins were initially annotated with unknown function but careful domain analysis observed homology to bacterial ribosome biogenesis _PROTEIN_ and their detection in the ribosomal fractions provided support for their involvement in ribosome biogenesis . several _PROTEIN_ have been implicated in ribosome assembly in bacteria . the bacterial obg co fractionates with the s subunit and the s subunit but not with the s ribosomes . it associates with and s rrnas in vitro and with an rna helicase . a chloroplast localized arabidopsis obg homologue _PROTEIN_ has been identified and its _PROTEIN_ activity has been demonstrated . knock out mutants of _PROTEIN_ are embryo lethal showing its crucial role in chloroplast development and studies on knockdown mutants have shown that _PROTEIN_ is essential for _LOCATION_ rrna processing . hflx a _PROTEIN_ that is related to obge associates with the s particle the s ribosomes and both and s rrnas . in this study both _PROTEIN_ and the hflx homologues were observed _PROTEIN_ at mda consistent with the results from bacterial studies . is another subclass of the obg family and exhibits altered nucleotide specificity by hydrolyzing _PROTEIN_ more efficiently than _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis protein migrated in the mda range . yqeh a circularly permuted _PROTEIN_ also co sediments with the s particle and is essential for s rrna maturation . two yqeh orthologues in arabidopsis were identified in the hm fractions and they behave similarly . one of these orthologues the _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits _PROTEIN_ activity in vitro . moreover the bacterial yqeh complements _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants providing further evidence that _PROTEIN_ functions as a chloroplast localized yqeh in plants . _LOCATION_ is another e. coli _PROTEIN_ that binds s rrna and is involved in s subunit maturation . we observed that the _LOCATION_ orthologue in arabidopsis was present in the s fractions rather than the s fraction . the e. coli enga has two contiguous _PROTEIN_ domains whose nucleotide occupancy modulates its binding to either s alone or to and s ribosomes . it co sediments with and s rrnas and is essential for bacterial growth . the arabidopsis orthologue of enga migrates at > mda range . two mutant alleles of the arabidopsis enga are arrested in embryogenesis at the globular stage consistent with an essential function in chloroplast development . additional ribosomal biogenesis _PROTEIN_ involved in s rrna processing and s ribosome maturation include rimm and the ribosome binding _PROTEIN_ a protein . the arabidopsis homologues of rimm peaked at the s fraction and rbfa peaked with the s ribosome . rrna modifications particularly base methylations are common to all _METHOD_ . among the bacterial rrna/trna methyltransferases are rsmd yrdc and spou . the arabidopsis orthologues of these rrna modifying enzymes migrated at different _METHOD_ with rsmd at mda yrdc at mda and spou at > mda . other maturation _PROTEIN_ include the dag like protein _PROTEIN_ and iojap . _PROTEIN_ eluted at the mda range and is involved in the maturation of rrnas and ribosome assembly . the iojap protein eluted at the mda fraction . in maize iojap deficient leaf tissues are ribosomeless and they lack and s rrnas and protein synthesis activity . three ribonucleases were observed in the hm fractions and various lines of evidence suggest their involvement in rrna maturation in various ribosomal assembly stages . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two related endoribonucleases with multiple roles in chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ co purified with preribosomal particles but not with mature ribosomes or polysomes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of stroma showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ migrated at the > mda range . consistently we observed only _PROTEIN_ mostly in fractions with s particles . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was identified in lm a fractions together with the remainder of _PROTEIN_ in agreement with previous observations . polynucleotide phosphorylase _PROTEIN_ is an exoribonuclease that is indispensable for end maturation of s rrna transcripts and the efficiency of the end processing and polyadenylation of mrnas as well as rna degradation . in e. coli _PROTEIN_ is part of a degradosome complex along with the endoribonuclease rnase e a dead box rna helicase and the glycolytic enzyme enolase . however the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ has been observed as a kda homo oligomer in spinach and as a kda tetramer in arabidopsis . interestingly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ fraction was observed to peak in mda suggesting interactions with rna containing complexes . rnase j is another endonuclease that is implicated in s rrna maturation and associates with both assembled s ribosomes and s particles suggesting a role in ribosome assembly . the arabidopsis orthologue was found to be essential for embryogenesis _PROTEIN_ . in this study it was found to elute at a wide range of _METHOD_ at relatively abundant levels suggesting interactions with rna bound to various ribonucleoprotein complexes . dead box proteins possess the characteristic asp glu ala asp sequence an rna binding motif and an _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzing domain and are _PROTEIN_ involved in _PROTEIN_ dependent rearrangement of inter and intramolecular rna structures or remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes . there are predicted genes for dead box proteins in arabidopsis nine of these are predicted by targetp to be _LOCATION_ localized . several dead box rna helicases were identified in this study and appeared in almost all fractions > mda suggesting associations with a variety of rna containing protein complexes . _PROTEIN_ which belongs to a subgroup of dead box proteins containing a gly/arg/ser rich c terminal extension was found to be the most abundant of these rhs . _PROTEIN_ was also identified in fractions above mda in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fractionation of stroma . an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant is embryo lethal _PROTEIN_ indicating a crucial role in plant development . has a long n terminal extension containing seven internal arg ser asp repeats . in addition deficient plants display a pale green leaf phenotype suggesting impairment in chloroplast development . is the arabidopsis orthologue of the rice which exhibits rna helicase activities in vitro and is involved in conferring plant resistance against various stresses . proteins involved in transcription and other functions involving dna association were observed in the hm fractions although at relatively low concentrations . the _PROTEIN_ complex is composed of four subunits namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and is the predominant transcription complex in mature chloroplasts . the tobacco _PROTEIN_ complex was affinity purified and was observed in a native gradient gel migrating at > kda . in the current study the _PROTEIN_ complex was observed to migrate at _METHOD_ > mda suggesting association with hm complexes most likely _LOCATION_ dna as part of the nucleoid . indeed pcr analysis confirmed the presence of _LOCATION_ dna particularly in fractions with _METHOD_ > mda . analysis of purified transcriptionally active chromosomes from arabidopsis chloroplasts revealed proteins involved in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ including the _PROTEIN_ complex and proteins that contain rna/dna binding domains . in the current analysis we found ptacs and eluting with the _PROTEIN_ fraction . moreover a dna _PROTEIN_ a thioredoxin protein and a pfkb type _PROTEIN_ kinase which were found in the tac preparations were also seen in the current study . in addition several dna binding proteins that were not observed in the tac analysis clearly co eluted with the _PROTEIN_ complex and ptac proteins in the current study . these include two proteins involved in dna damage repair namely dna mismatch repair muts and dna repair protein reca . a dna topoisomerase and a relatively high abundance dna helicase were observed peaking at mda . finally several proteins with dnaj domains were found in fractions > mda and the protein heat map suggested association with the nucleoid . proteins harboring single or multiple _PROTEIN_ yhby domains also called the chloroplast ribosome maturation domain participate in the assembly of catalytic ribonucleoprotein complexes namely group ii intron particles and the s ribosomal subunit . in arabidopsis proteins are predicted to have single or multiple crm domains . _PROTEIN_ has two crm domains and is involved in group ii intron rna splicing . aside from _PROTEIN_ two other crm domain proteins were identified in this study . these include _GENE_ and _GENE_ which have one and three crm domains respectively . two mutant alleles for the latter protein are embryo lethal _PROTEIN_ with embryo development arrested at the globular stage suggesting its importance in _LOCATION_ development . in maize chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ is found in group ii intron ribonucleoprotein complexes and cooperates with in promoting group ii intron splicing . _GENE_ and _GENE_ the respective arabidopsis orthologues of maize _PROTEIN_ and did not exhibit identical elution profiles in our _PROTEIN_ analysis but still indicated interactions with ribonucleoprotein complexes with _PROTEIN_ eluting at mda and eluting at mda . in addition a chloroplast encoded maturase k was observed at the mda region in this study . the rna binding properties and function of maturase k in other plants have been studied . about _PROTEIN_ proteins are predicted in arabidopsis and they are recognized as major mediators of organelle gene _PROTEIN_ although their specific functions remain poorly characterized . eight _PROTEIN_ were observed in the hm fractions . in maize the _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the translation of several chloroplast encoded transcripts . the arabidopsis orthologues of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ eluted at and mda respectively . in addition the rna binding was found at fractions > mda . three proteins with rna binding domains were found to elute at fractions > with _GENE_ being fold more abundant than the other two . plants deficient in _PROTEIN_ exhibit pale green cotyledons and leaves indicating a role in chloroplast development . another rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ was found in the mda fractions consistent with its detection in mrna containing hm complexes . chloroplast ribonucleoproteins are highly abundant proteins that associate with various rna species for rna processing and/or stabilization . in tobacco _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were mostly found as non ribosome bound ribonucleoprotein complexes but were also detected in fractions > kda . in this study _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ proteins were observed in the mda range with similar elution profiles . several cprnps are involved in rna editing although this has not yet been demonstrated for the cprnps identified in this study . aside from ribosomes and ribosome associated proteins the other function that is enriched in the hm data set is fatty acid synthesis . two hetero oligomeric complexes namely pdc and accase were observed . the pdc is composed of multiple copies of three enzymes . the component is a pyruvate dehydrogenase is a dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase and is a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase . pdcs form large complexes composed of a core complex of eight trimers or trimers of with with promoting substrate channeling across the three enzyme components . the maize mitochondrial pdc was found to have an estimated _METHOD_ of about mda due in part to the mda core . the _LOCATION_ localized pdc from pea chloroplasts dissociates rapidly in vitro making the estimation of its organization and composition difficult . the pdc components eluted at a _METHOD_ range > mda . all of the subunits of the _LOCATION_ localized pdc are _LOCATION_ encoded and all except the component are encoded by more than one gene . an subunit has been characterized previously and was observed in this experiment with unique peptides . _PROTEIN_ is an component and has been shown to exhibit dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase activity . the t dna insertion mutant for _PROTEIN_ is embryo lethal . another subunit was found in the genome database and a t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ for this gene is also embryo lethal . interestingly two elution peaks were observed for one at > mda and another at mda suggesting different oligomeric states for the core with or without bound and . the two _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are identical and were characterized previously . the presence of different paralogues for the three central components suggests that the _LOCATION_ pdc population is heterogeneous further experimentation is needed to determine the biological significance . the _LOCATION_ localized heteromeric accase catalyzes the first committed step in de novo fatty acid synthesis which occurs solely in _LOCATION_ . accase is composed of biotin _PROTEIN_ biotin _PROTEIN_ carrier protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits . the pea chloroplast accase was found to elute at about kda in gel filtration analysis . in this study the arabidopsis accase subunits were all found in the mda range . these include biotin _PROTEIN_ ct and the chloroplast encoded ct as well as four _PROTEIN_ that were identified with distinct peptides . _PROTEIN_ has been well characterized . the other three _PROTEIN_ namely _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ have similar molecular _METHOD_ but domain analysis revealed that they are missing the critical lysine residue for biotin attachment . nevertheless the observation that these _PROTEIN_ elute at the same size range as the accase suggests that they associate with the accase . this is further supported by the isolation of these _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ affinity chromatography where _PROTEIN_ is a signaling protein that modulates accase activity . nevertheless the functional roles of these _PROTEIN_ remain to be characterized . additional proteins involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway co eluted with accase . _PROTEIN_ an essential enzyme involved in the construction of unsaturated fatty acid _PROTEIN_ skeletons and acetyl coa synthetase were also found at the hm fractions peaking at and mda respectively . acyl carrier proteins _PROTEIN_ carry the acyl chains during the synthesis of and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids . several _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are found in arabidopsis and are _PROTEIN_ in a tissue specific manner . _PROTEIN_ the most abundant and most leaf specific isoform was the one observed in this study it peaked at mda .
a. thaliana was grown under h h dark cycles at in controlled growth chambers for about days and leaves were collected from mature rosettes about week prior to bolting . leaves were briefly homogenized in grinding medium and filtered through a nylon mesh . the crude _LOCATION_ were then collected by a min spin at g and further purified on percoll cushions by a min spin at g and one additional wash in the grinding medium without ascorbic acid cysteine and bsa . chloroplasts were subsequently lysed in mm hepes koh ph mm with a mixture of protease inhibitors under mild mechanical disruption . the lysate was then subjected to ultracentrifugation to pellet the _LOCATION_ components . the supernatant was then collected and concentrated using an amicon kda molecular _METHOD_ cutoff filter . protein amounts were determined using the bradford reagent or the bca protein assay kit . stroma was loaded in a superose gl column using an _METHOD_ system with a mercury lamp as a detector . absorbance was measured at nm . elution was performed with buffer a or buffer b at an optimal flow rate of ml/min . subfractions were initially collected . subfractions were pooled as follows three for fractions four for fractions and six for fraction _PROTEIN_ . proteins from pooled fractions were either concentrated using an amicon microcon ym filter or precipitated with acetone and were then separated further using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on t laemmli or t tricine minigels . protein bands were visualized using _METHOD_ sypro ruby for fractions of _PROTEIN_ separated sample from buffer a and the rest of the gels were stained with _METHOD_ blue . each gel lane was excised into four or five bands followed by reduction alkylation in gel digestion with trypsin and peptide extraction as described . peptide extracts were dried down and resuspended in of formic acid for _METHOD_ analysis . the resuspended peptide extracts were analyzed by data dependent _METHOD_ using an on line lc ltq orbitrap . peptide samples were automatically loaded on a guard column via an autosampler followed by separation on a pepmap reverse phase nanocolumn using min gradients with water acn formic acid and acn water formic acid at a flow rate of nl/min . two blanks were run after every sample for the gradient and sample injection scheme . the acquisition cycle consisted of a survey _METHOD_ scan in the orbitrap with a set _METHOD_ range from to m/z at the highest resolving power followed by five data dependent _METHOD_ scans acquired in the ltq . dynamic exclusion was used with the following parameters exclusion size repeat count repeat duration s exclusion time s exclusion window or ppm . target values were set at and for the survey and tandem _METHOD_ scans respectively . regular scans were used both for the precursor and tandem _METHOD_ . peak lists were generated using dtasupercharge software and searched with mascot _PROTEIN_ . for off line calibration first a preliminary search was conducted with the precursor tolerance window set at ppm . peptides with ion scores above were chosen as benchmarks to determine the offset for each lc _METHOD_ run . this particular ion score value was chosen in accordance with the results of the search against the target _PROTEIN_ database . this offset was then applied to adjust precursor _METHOD_ in the peak lists of the respective .mgf file for recalibration using a perl the recalibrated peak lists were searched against the arabidopsis information resource a. thaliana database including sequences for known contaminants with or without a concatenated _PROTEIN_ database where all the sequences were in reverse orientation . each of the peak lists were searched using mascot for fully tryptic peptides using a precursor ion tolerance window set at ppm variable methionine oxidation fixed cysteine _PROTEIN_ a minimal ion score threshold of and _METHOD_ range of da for precursor ions . to reduce the false identification rate of proteins identified by one peptide the mascot search results were further filtered as follows the ion score threshold was increased to and _METHOD_ accuracy on the precursor ion was required to be within ppm . overall this yielded a peptide false discovery rate of with peptide false positive rate calculated as _PROTEIN_ derived from searches against the target _PROTEIN_ database . the false protein identification rate of protein identified with two or more peptides was zero . all filtered results were uploaded into the _PROTEIN_ . all _METHOD_ spectral data were made available via the pride at http //www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ . to determine the relative protein abundance distribution by spectral counting the number of matched _METHOD_ spectra or spectral count for each protein was obtained . this was further classified as total spc unique spc and adjusted spc . the latter is the sum of unique spcs and spcs from shared peptides across accessions with spc distributed in proportion to their unique spcs if applicable . proteins that shared more than of their matched peptides with other proteins across the complete data set were grouped into families . for many arabidopsis genes more than one protein model is predicted . in this study protein models with the highest total adjspc across all experiments were used if the protein models did not differ in total adjspc protein model was selected . to increase the robustness and significance of the data set we removed all proteins that were identified with only one amino acid sequence irrespective of charge state post translational modifications or number of spcs . proteins that were quantified with two or fewer adjspcs were also removed . to generate protein elution heat maps for the high _METHOD_ data set the adjspc for each protein per _PROTEIN_ fraction was normalized to the highest adjspc across five hm fractions . to calculate the relative abundance for each protein across all hm fractions the total adjspc was divided by the number of observable tryptic peptides within the _METHOD_ range da yielding the spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ . the saf values were then normalized to the total saf in the whole data set yielding normalized spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ . to group proteins with similar elution profiles in the hm data set hierarchical clustering was utilized using the statistics toolbox of matlab version . the linear correlation between every pair of proteins with nadjspc distribution across the _PROTEIN_ hm fractionation range xn and yn where n was derived . this was then converted into a distance measure . protein pairs with similar elution profiles have higher correlations and in turn have smaller distance values . a linkage map based on the average distance among protein pairs was then constructed to yield a hierarchical cluster tree . dna and rna were isolated from _PROTEIN_ fractions by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation . briefly an aliquot from each fraction was combined with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol in a mixture together with _PROTEIN_ mm edta and glycoblue . _PROTEIN_ and edta were added to dissociate proteins from nucleoprotein complexes . glycoblue enhances _LOCATION_ acid recovery and increases visibility of the sample pellet . the aqueous phase was extracted after phase separation . to increase _LOCATION_ acid yield the organic phase was then back extracted with _PROTEIN_ buffer _PROTEIN_ . the collected aqueous phase was then combined with the initial extraction . after adjustment of salt concentration with m sodium acetate _LOCATION_ acid was precipitated with ethanol pelleted dried and resuspended in te buffer . an aliquot of the extracted dna/rna was treated with ribonuclease h to degrade rna from rna dna hybrids and _LOCATION_ dna was probed by pcr amplification of the gene for s rrna . pcr samples were then separated on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . the presence of and s rrna in the extracted dna/rna was determined by northern blot analysis through hybridization with digoxigenin dutp labeled rrna probes and subsequent detection with anti dig antibodies as described previously . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based information of all identified proteins was extracted from the mascot search pages and filtered for significance ambiguities and shared spectra as described previously . this information includes mowse scores number of matching peptides total spcs unique spcs adjspcs highest peptide score highest peptide _LOCATION_ lowest absolute _LOCATION_ sequence coverage and tryptic peptide sequences . all these are available in the _PROTEIN_ by using the search function proteome experiments and by selecting the desired output parameters . alternatively information for specific accessions can be extracted using the search function accessions and if desired this search can be limited to specific experiments . finally information for a particular accession can also be found on each protein report page. the mapman bin system was used for functional assignment and proteins were reassigned to other bins if needed .
