to date there have been no reports on screening for mutants defective in the _METHOD_ accumulation of rubisco in higher plants . here we describe a screening method based on the toxic accumulation of ammonia in the presence of methionine sulfoximine a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase during photorespiration initiated by the oxygenase reaction of rubisco in arabidopsis . five recessive mutants with _PROTEIN_ amounts of rubisco were identified and designated as nara mutants as they contained a mutation in genes necessary for the achievement of rubisco accumulation . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed markedly lower levels of _LOCATION_ encoded photosynthetic proteins including rubisco . map based cloning revealed that _PROTEIN_ encoded a chloroplast phosphofructokinase b type _PROTEIN_ kinase family protein of unknown function . the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to green _METHOD_ protein localized in chloroplasts . we conducted _PROTEIN_ analyses of photosynthetic genes during light induced greening of etiolated seedlings of _PROTEIN_ and the t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ . our results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is indispensable for hyperexpression of photosynthetic genes encoded in the _LOCATION_ genome particularly _PROTEIN_ .
it has been estimated that rubisco catalyzes the oxygenase reaction in photosynthesizing arabidopsis leaves at fresh weight . this corresponds to the release of at fresh weight at the gly decarboxylation step during photorespiration . this amount of far exceeds amounts released from other metabolic pathways in plant leaves . photorespiratory is _PROTEIN_ reassimilated by _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts . the herbicide _METHOD_ kills plants by inhibiting the gs reaction . its harmful effects on plant growth result from blocking of gln synthesis and accumulation of toxic . in this screening method the selection medium contained gln as the sole nitrogen source thus the inhibitory effect of _METHOD_ on plant growth is restricted to the accumulation of photorespiratory . accordingly mutants with lower levels of rubisco or strongly deactivated rubisco in the absence of rubisco activase are expected to survive in ambient air conditions because of their slower photorespiration rate . the wild type plants would survive in a _PROTEIN_ enriched atmosphere because photorespiration is suppressed . the wild type and the rca mutant of arabidopsis were grown in air supplemented with _PROTEIN_ at photons for weeks . the medium contained mm gln with or without _METHOD_ . the plants were then transferred to ambient air and grown at to photons . the rca mutant was used as the positive control in our screening experiments . this mutant lacks rubisco activase which promotes _PROTEIN_ of the rubisco active sites . there was no visible effect of _METHOD_ on the wild type and rca in the presence of _PROTEIN_ at both the low and high light intensities . after wild type plants were transferred to ambient air conditions with high light intensity plants grown on _METHOD_ containing medium died within h . at low light intensity however the wild type plants grown in ambient air conditions grew although slowly . the inhibitory effects of _METHOD_ on wild type plants indicate that the rubisco oxygenase reaction has a role in the observed growth inhibition . consistent with this the growth of the rca mutant which has little rubisco activity in air was not visibly affected by _METHOD_ . these results suggest that _METHOD_ resistant arabidopsis mutants screened under photorespiratory conditions have lower activities of the oxygenase reaction of rubisco . to examine the inhibitory effect of _METHOD_ on gs activity under these screening conditions we measured the amount of in plants grown in the presence of _METHOD_ under photorespiratory conditions . in wild type plants the level of was constantly low at approximately fresh weight in the presence of _PROTEIN_ at photons . in wild type plants this level increased to approximately fresh weight at illumination levels of to photons in ambient air but in rca mutants grown under the same conditions the level increased to only fresh weight . the rate of release from wild type plants was to fresh weight . the absence of _METHOD_ did not cause any increase in in these experiments . sterilized seeds of ethylmethanesulfonate _METHOD_ treated arabidopsis were germinated on agar plates to screen for mutants with lower levels of rubisco . seedlings were grown for d under nonphotorespiratory conditions then were grown under screening conditions for to h to select for mutants that survived the photorespiratory conditions . the frequency of _METHOD_ resistant plants was two to three per seeds but many failed to grow or were sterile after transplanting into soil . we collected seeds of _METHOD_ resistant mutants and assessed repeatability of resistance . five of the selected mutants showed the recessive phenotype . we measured fresh weight of aerial parts rubisco activity and amount of rubisco protein in d old mutant lines . compared with the wild type the mutants were smaller and had lower fresh weights . lines and contained and of the amount of rubisco in wild type plants respectively . accumulation of rubisco was moderately suppressed in lines and . although rca had a lower activation state of rubisco this was not the case in the mutant lines selected in this study . the observed lower initial and total activities of rubisco were due to _PROTEIN_ amounts of the rubisco protein in these mutants . these mutants were designated as nara mutants . to examine genetic dominance and genetic segregation of the mutated genes these mutants were crossed with the wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ . plants of all progeny showed no detectable growth phenotype but the mutant phenotype appeared in one third of plants of to _PROTEIN_ and in progeny . this result indicates that phenotypes in these mutants are due to recessive mutations at single genetic loci . segregation of the nara phenotype in seedlings we identified genetic loci by map based cloning of the mutations in the and mutants . we found a t to c substitution at of the _GENE_ coding sequence in . _GENE_ encodes chloroplast rna _PROTEIN_ which participates in splicing of the intron in _PROTEIN_ and protein translation in chloroplasts . this point mutation changed the codon for gln at position into a stop codon . other mutations of this gene have been reported previously a t dna insertion into the first exon of the genomic _PROTEIN_ results in an albino phenotype and a t dna insertion in the sixth exon of the another allele _PROTEIN_ results in variegated leaves . the leaves of the mutant showed less variegation compared with those of _PROTEIN_ . this nonsense mutation in the mutant suggests that deletion of the c terminal region containing amino acids of _PROTEIN_ weakens the function of _PROTEIN_ . it is likely that the _PROTEIN_ amounts of rubisco in the mutant are due to inhibition of chloroplast translation . nara mutations in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a severely impaired growth phenotype with a very low level of rubisco . map based cloning showed that the genetic locus of _PROTEIN_ was in a kb long genomic sequence located between two polymorphic markers on the two bacterial artificial chromosome clones and on chromosome iv . sequencing of genes with annotations and _LOCATION_ leading sequences in this region revealed a g to a substitution at of the _GENE_ coding sequence . this substitution changes gly at the residue to glu . we introduced the full length cdna of _GENE_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this resulted in complete recoveries in appearance and rubisco content to those of the wild type . thus we concluded that the phenotype observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was due to the point mutation in _GENE_ . _GENE_ encodes a amino acid pfkb type _PROTEIN_ kinase family protein with unknown function as described _PROTEIN_ . this newly found protein was named _PROTEIN_ . map based cloning of the mutant identified a g to a substitution at of the _GENE_ coding sequence . _GENE_ encodes alanine glyoxylate _PROTEIN_ which catalyzes the aminotransferase reaction between ser and glyoxylate in the photorespiratory pathway . growth inhibition of the mutant was completely removed by _PROTEIN_ as observed previously in an _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant . the mutation in _GENE_ caused to have thr in place of a highly conserved ala at the residue . the similar severe phenotypes of the mutant and _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants suggest that ala has a pervasive influence on _PROTEIN_ activity . the mutant had a c to t point mutation at in _GENE_ which encodes glutamyl trna synthetase . this mutation substituted phe for ser at the residue which is highly conserved among glurs enzymes of other _METHOD_ . the glurs is essential for protein synthesis in both chloroplasts and mitochondria and for chlorophyll synthesis in chloroplasts . a null mutant of this gene in arabidopsis shows an ovule abortion phenotype . of all the nara mutants _PROTEIN_ showed the greatest _PROTEIN_ in rubisco content therefore it was selected for further detailed analyses and characterization . to predict the function of _PROTEIN_ homologous genes were surveyed using the deduced whole amino acid sequence as the query in the national center for biotechnology information genome database . multiple alignments revealed that _PROTEIN_ showed and amino acid sequence identity to vitis vinifera hypothetical protein _PROTEIN_ oryza sativa hypothetical protein and physcomitrella patens predicted protein respectively . gly was completely conserved in these sequences . the sequences most homologous to _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome were a pfkb type _PROTEIN_ kinase family protein and adenosine kinase but their identities were only and respectively . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a single gene in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ had two conserved motifs the nxxe motif and the pfkb family of _PROTEIN_ kinases signature . both of these motifs are found in pfkb type _PROTEIN_ kinases including ribokinase adenosine kinase _PROTEIN_ and guanosine/inosine kinase in several _METHOD_ . the nxxe motif is involved in binding metal and phosphate ions and the signature motif is involved in transferring the phosphate group in the kinase reaction . however there were low identities of full length _PROTEIN_ to these kinases . we _PROTEIN_ a recombinant _PROTEIN_ conjugated to a his tag at the c terminus in escherichia coli but the recombinant protein did not show any of these activities . to define the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and these kinases a phylogenetic tree was constructed using amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ pfkb type _PROTEIN_ kinases and related proteins . the clade of _PROTEIN_ and its homologs was phylogenetically distant from the clades containing rk _PROTEIN_ and gsk . therefore the function of _PROTEIN_ may differ from those of these kinases . we analyzed another _PROTEIN_ mutant to understand the physiological significance of _PROTEIN_ . the gabi kat line was tagged by t dna in the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the tagged mutant was a null mutant of _PROTEIN_ . an allelism test by outcrossing the _PROTEIN_ homozygote and the heterozygote of the tagged mutant indicated that line was a mutant allele of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant was renamed _PROTEIN_ and the t dna insertion mutant was renamed _PROTEIN_ . compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was yellower and smaller when grown heterotrophically on suc and could not grow autotrophically on soil . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was recovered by introducing the full length _PROTEIN_ fused to a his tag and to synthetic _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the c terminus . thus _PROTEIN_ encodes a gene that is essential for autotrophic photosynthetic growth of arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ was a leaky mutant with a normal transcription level of _PROTEIN_ . in d old wild type plants the _PROTEIN_ mrna content was times higher in illuminated shoots than in roots . in shoots the mrna levels were highest in rosette leaves with lower levels in the cauline leaves and inflorescence tissues . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were lowest in the _METHOD_ . this _PROTEIN_ pattern is comparable to that of the rubisco gene transcripts in higher plants . the long n terminal nonconserved sequence of _PROTEIN_ and its function proposed in this study suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized in chloroplasts . indeed targetp predicted that the n terminal sequence was a chloroplast transit sequence . to analyze the localization of _PROTEIN_ we introduced a binary vector containing the _METHOD_ gene fused to the c terminus of the full length _PROTEIN_ sequence under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter into plants with the _PROTEIN_ alleles . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein completely complemented the phenotype and the rubisco content in the mutants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were visualized as green spots clearly superimposed on the red _METHOD_ from protochlorophyllide and chlorophyll . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized in chloroplasts . we compared chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameters between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . compared with the wild type the maximum quantum yield and the quantum efficiency of psii were severely reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the reduction level of the primary electron accepting plastoquinone of psii was increased . these results suggest that in addition to rubisco accumulation photochemical activities are also impaired in _PROTEIN_ . photosynthetic parameters of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ data represent means sd . western blotting of chloroplast proteins encoded by the chloroplast and chromosomal genomes in both alleles of _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure . compared with the wild type the levels of cytochrome and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ of rubisco all encoded by the _LOCATION_ genome were reduced by approximately in _PROTEIN_ and by up to in _PROTEIN_ . such severe reductions in levels of photosynthetic proteins other than rubisco were not observed in the _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant of tobacco . in addition to these _LOCATION_ encoded proteins the _LOCATION_ encoded subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase showed similarly reduced levels . in protein complexes such as _PROTEIN_ synthase which include subunits encoded by both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ genomes the _PROTEIN_ of the subunit gene in _LOCATION_ may have been affected by _PROTEIN_ of the partner gene in chloroplasts . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast proteins fru bisp aldolase _PROTEIN_ and ferredoxin nadp oxidoreductase was unaffected in these mutants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the synthesis and/or _PROTEIN_ of proteins coded by the _LOCATION_ genome . during greening of leaves large amounts of photosynthetic proteins including rubisco are synthesized in a relatively short time . we examined the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins during leaf greening of _PROTEIN_ mutants . accumulation of the rubisco _PROTEIN_ in etioplasts was strongly repressed during growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants in the dark . illumination of dark grown wild type seedlings caused _METHOD_ accumulation of _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ and cyt and _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ and fnr . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ mutants could not _METHOD_ accumulate _LOCATION_ encoded proteins during greening while the increase in _LOCATION_ encoded proteins was unaffected . to determine the mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ encoded photosynthetic genes is repressed in _PROTEIN_ mutants we measured transcript levels of these genes in dark grown and greening _PROTEIN_ mutants using real time pcr . since these photosynthetic genes are transcribed by _PROTEIN_ we also measured transcripts of clpp a _LOCATION_ encoded gene transcribed by _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase and _PROTEIN_ transcribed only by nep . _PROTEIN_ data are relative values and are compared with the level in dark grown wild type plants at time . the _PROTEIN_ of genes transcribed by _PROTEIN_ was more severely suppressed in _PROTEIN_ mutants than those transcribed by nep/pep and nep . among the genes examined the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was most severely suppressed in _PROTEIN_ alleles . the transcript level of the _LOCATION_ encoded rbcs in nara mutants was lowered after h of illumination compared with the wild type . this may have been caused by the suppression of _LOCATION_ gene transcription in the mutant as has been reported . the severe suppression of _PROTEIN_ transcription may have been a major cause of the _PROTEIN_ rubisco accumulation in _PROTEIN_ mutants . next we examined the effect of greening on _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . a basal level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was found in etiolated cotyledons but this level increased fold during greening under illumination for h. together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a role in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ transcribed photosynthetic genes particularly _PROTEIN_ .
we used arabidopsis as the wild type the mutant lines rca and nara and the gabi kat line _PROTEIN_ . all nara mutants were back crossed with wild type col at least three times except _PROTEIN_ which was back crossed twice . the plants were grown on murashige and skoog medium supplemented with suc g mes nicotinic acid pyridoxine hydrochloride thiamine hydrochloride myoinositol and agar with a h light h dark cycle at unless otherwise specified . we screened nara mutants by uniformly spreading to seeds of _METHOD_ mutagenized plants in the col genetic background on selective plates . the selection medium was and _PROTEIN_ free murashige and skoog medium supplemented with _METHOD_ mm gln suc mm kcl g mes nicotinic acid pyridoxine hydrochloride thiamine hydrochloride myoinositol and agar . plants were initially grown for to weeks in the presence of _PROTEIN_ under a h photoperiod h of dark at . plates were then transferred to continuous irradiation at to photons in ambient air .

were mapped with molecular markers based on simple sequence length polymorphism and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers . genomic sequences of candidate mutated genes were amplified by pcr using extaq dna polymerase and the pcr products were directly sequenced using a bigdye terminator version cycle sequencing kit and an abi prism sequencer . for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ his in plants with _PROTEIN_ alleles a series of gateway binary vectors were used as described by citation . we obtained the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ from cdna of d old arabidopsis seedlings by pcr using the primer pair aaaaagcaggctccatggcgttctccctcctctc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for fusion of _METHOD_ or his to _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ cdnas lacking the stop codon were amplified by pcr using the primer pair _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . recombination reactions _PROTEIN_ were used to clone cdna of _PROTEIN_ into . each _PROTEIN_ cdna was subsequently introduced into or by recombination reactions according to the manufacturer 's protocol . these binary vectors were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens _PROTEIN_ by electroporation and then into plants with _PROTEIN_ alleles by the floral dip method . shoots were homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and then dissolved in extraction buffer . rubisco activity was spectrophotometrically assayed by measuring the rate of nadh oxidation in the presence of phosphoglycerate kinase and glyceraldehyde p dehydrogenase with some modifications . the homogenate was centrifuged at for s at and aliquots of the supernatant were immediately used for assay for s to determine the initial activity of rubisco . the reaction mixture contained mm tris hcl mm edta mm dtt mm mm mm ribulose bisp mm nadh mm _PROTEIN_ mm creatine phosphate units of creatine kinase units of phosphoglycerate kinase and units of glyceraldehyde p dehydrogenase . rubisco in the crude extract was activated by mm and mm . after activation for min at room temperature rubisco was added to the reaction mixture to determine total activity . to determine rubisco content shoots were homogenized on ice with a mortar and pestle and dissolved in extraction buffer supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets . the homogenate was then centrifuged at for min at . total proteins in the supernatant were separated by native _PROTEIN_ on a to gradient gel _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at . gels were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r . the prominent band intensity corresponding to the rubisco holoenzyme was measured by a scanning densitometer and quantified using _PROTEIN_ image software . to compare the amount of rubisco among the mutants we constructed a calibration curve from the staining intensities of rubisco protein bands of wild type plants . for each mutant we calculated relative amounts of rubisco per of total soluble protein and then _PROTEIN_ the amount as a percentage of that in wild type plants . extraction of proteins from shoots was modified slightly depending on the localization of individual proteins in plant cells . plant shoots were homogenized and centrifuged as described above . soluble proteins in the supernatant were quantified as described by citation . insoluble proteins in pellets and total proteins of shoots were prepared and
