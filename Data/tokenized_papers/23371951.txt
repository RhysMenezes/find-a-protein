phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ is the primary photoreceptor mediating deetiolation under far red light whereas _PROTEIN_ predominantly regulates light responses in red light . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an ubiquitin ligase complex with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is responsible for the degradation of various photomorphogenesis promoting _PROTEIN_ resulting in desensitization to light signaling . however the role of _PROTEIN_ in fr light signaling and the regulatory pathway from light activated phytochromes to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex are largely unknown . here we confirm that _PROTEIN_ overexpression causes an etiolation response with reduced elongated _PROTEIN_ accumulation under fr light . notably _PROTEIN_ exerts its _LOCATION_ activities and promotes seedling etiolation in both the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ in response to fr light . _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ and is functionally dependent on it in fr light signaling . _PROTEIN_ interacts and _METHOD_ a protein complex with _PROTEIN_ enhancing its _LOCATION_ accumulation under fr light . during the dark to fr transition _PROTEIN_ is rapidly imported into the _LOCATION_ and facilitates _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation . these findings support the notion that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in repressing fr light signaling . activity modulation of the _PROTEIN_ spa complex by light activated phytochromes is an effective and pivotal regulatory step in light signaling .
previous studies have reported that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ promotes seedling etiolation under fr light . however the _METHOD_ behind these effects of _PROTEIN_ in fr light are largely unknown . to investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in fr light signaling we generated transgenic plants that overexpress the full length _PROTEIN_ gene fused with green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . this construct was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant a nonsense allele of _PROTEIN_ . when first grown under r light for d the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines possessed hypocotyls of similar lengths to those of wild type control plants in the dark and showed enhanced seedling photomorphogenesis with short hypocotyls and large cotyledons similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene was biologically functional . next the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines were grown in fr light for d to evaluate hypocotyl elongation . seedling hypocotyl lengths in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and _PROTEIN_ were all times the length of wild type seedlings whereas the hypocotyl length in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was only that of the wild type . in previous studies overexpression of _PROTEIN_ caused an approximately twofold increase in hypocotyl elongation compared with the respective wild type backgrounds under frc light whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutation significantly inhibited hypocotyl elongation . to provide further molecular and biochemical evidence for the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in fr light signaling we measured _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance and anthocyanin accumulation in _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . in response to fr light the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings was fold higher than in the col wild type seedlings whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ seedlings were of wild type levels . consequently seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated fold more anthocyanin than did col wild type seedlings whereas the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulated as much anthocyanin as their respective wild types . abo _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulate only as much anthocyanin as the wild type under frc light . collectively these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in repressing arabidopsis photomorphogenesis under fr light including promoting hypocotyl elongation affecting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and repressing anthocyanin accumulation . the presence of sugar has been found to interfere with the inhibitory effect of _PROTEIN_ under frc light . based upon that we investigated the effects of no sugar suc concentration fr light intensity and growth period on _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl elongation in response to fr light . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ repression of deetiolation under frc light occurs even in the absence of additional sugar although the presence of sugar measurably enhances the inhibitory effect . we chose moderate growth conditions to perform most further experiments including growth medium with suc seedlings grown in frc light for to d and fr light fluence rates of and . based on _METHOD_ observations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is regulated by r light whereas that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is controlled not only by fr light but also by r light with much faster kinetics . the high percentage of the active pfr form of _PROTEIN_ in response to high steady state r light leads to large _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ bodies . to determine whether fr light can activate _PROTEIN_ we first checked _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in response to fr light treatment . in dark grown seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was very weak h of fr light exposure produced diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ without any nbs . following h of fr exposure or in seedlings grown under frc light for d _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was seen in very small dim nbs . to confirm whether _PROTEIN_ was required for the _LOCATION_ activities of _PROTEIN_ we also checked _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in a _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ background in response to both r and fr light treatment . under rc light the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ exhibited large and bright nbs in both the col wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background displayed almost identical _METHOD_ patterns to those in the wild type background whether in the dark or under fr light exposure . note that the frequency of cells with small nbs in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background was higher than in the wild type background when seedlings were grown under fr for d . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in dark grown seedlings was too weak to be observed clearly immunoblot analysis revealed a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ fractions . the seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ grown in rc light accumulated much more _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein than those grown in the dark . to provide further evidence _PROTEIN_ whether the _LOCATION_ activities of _PROTEIN_ in response to fr light treatment required _PROTEIN_ we compared _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background with that in the wild type background . upon h of fr light treatment the _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein increased almost twofold compared with that in dark grown seedlings . unexpectedly _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background was higher than in the wild type background in the dark or after fr light treatment . over the same period cytoplasmic levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were lower than those in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings . _LOCATION_ import of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was notably higher than that in col in the dark or after fr light treatment . thus fr exposure promoted _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ even in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is thought to be the only active photoreceptor that promotes seedling photomorphogenesis under fr light . the first step to investigate the roles of _PROTEIN_ in fr light signaling is to understand the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line the hypocotyls were shorter or longer respectively than the wild type hypocotyls when grown under fr light . then we compared the hypocotyl lengths of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double mutants with that of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . although _PROTEIN_ exhibited a dominant effect on hypocotyl elongation the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings had less hypocotyl elongation compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant grown under fr light for d. by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double mutant seedlings had greater hypocotyl elongation compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . all differences in hypocotyl lengths between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were significant as assessed by student s t test . in previous studies the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant conferred to less unhooking than the _PROTEIN_ mutant under frc light . next we compared apical unhooking and cotyledon unfolding between the col wild type possessing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . minor differences were observed in the apical unhooking angles of seedlings grown in continuous dark for d seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant had larger apical unhooking angles compared with those of the col wild type or _PROTEIN_ single mutants . after growth in continuous dark for d followed by high intensity fr light for h the col wild type seedlings had a straight apical hook with unopened cotyledons whereas the _PROTEIN_ single mutant seedlings exhibited a cotyledon opening angle of . although the cotyledons of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were unopened after h of high intensity fr treatment their apical unhooking angles were larger than those of _PROTEIN_ single mutant seedlings . after growth in intense frc light for d the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings had open cotyledons whereas those of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant seedlings remained unopened . a previous study showed that the fr block of greening is _PROTEIN_ dependent . when grown under fr light for d and under w light for an additional d either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings had higher chlorophyll concentrations compared with those of col wild type or _PROTEIN_ mutants . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ inhibited the fr induced block of greening in subsequent w light in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . from these observations we conclude that _PROTEIN_ enhanced arabidopsis etiolation under frc light in both the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ . the negative effect of _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to occur early in the _PROTEIN_ specific signaling pathway which _METHOD_ the complex with _PROTEIN_ to mediate the degradation of various photomorphogenesis promoting _PROTEIN_ . another study showed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the _PROTEIN_ single mutant exhibit similar hypocotyl elongation under frc light . to confirm the epistatic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in fr light signaling we introduced _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line into the _PROTEIN_ mutant via genetic crosses constructing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . under different fr intensities _PROTEIN_ completely suppressed the deetiolation and etiolation phenotypes caused by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting not only that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ but also that its functions are dependent on _PROTEIN_ under fr light . overexpression of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in a hyperetiolation phenotype under r fr and b light conditions . to evaluate the effects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ function we introduced the myc _PROTEIN_ transgene into the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant to generate double or triple homozygous plants . overexpression of myc _PROTEIN_ leads to a cotyledon size much smaller than that of the col wild type . in this study the cotyledon size of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was fold that of col under fr illumination . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutant rescued the small cotyledon size caused by myc _PROTEIN_ overexpression . the _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed greater hypocotyl elongation than myc _PROTEIN_ under fr light its hypocotyl length was fold that of the parental line . the hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were shorter than those of the parental myc _PROTEIN_ line under high fr light . hypocotyl elongation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ triple mutant resembled that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with visibly shorter hypocotyls compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . taken together these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are necessary for the proper functioning of _PROTEIN_ under fr light . to investigate the role of light regulation in _PROTEIN_ activities we determined myc _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in the dark and under fr r b and w light conditions . figure demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ protein levels but not transcript abundance were tightly controlled in the dark and under fr r b and w light and that all light conditions led to greater myc _PROTEIN_ accumulation . elevated _PROTEIN_ abundance has been reported under frc and rc light conditions . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in light regulated _PROTEIN_ accumulation myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels were compared in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ backgrounds under fr light . myc _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were comparable in the col wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants under fr light . under fr light myc _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings was or respectively of that in seedlings of the parental line . the myc _PROTEIN_ protein level in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background was intermediate to those in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . notably myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ backgrounds were entirely consistent with their hypocotyl elongation under fr light . these data imply that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play a pivotal role in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ abundance and that _PROTEIN_ enhances _PROTEIN_ accumulation in both the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ was required for _PROTEIN_ activity under fr light we determined whether a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was involved in their functional regulation . we first used yeast two hybrid assays to determine their interaction and the domains responsible . _PROTEIN_ fl alone activated reporter gene _PROTEIN_ in our yeast two hybrid system so _PROTEIN_ was used to test the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the full length _PROTEIN_ protein as well as deletion derivatives including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cc and _PROTEIN_ were capable of interacting with _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ failed to interact with _PROTEIN_ fl or its deletion derivatives . these observations suggest that the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ including both coiled coil and domains is required for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . next we employed an _METHOD_ assay using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ double transgenic line to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . after growth in the dark or under r or fr light for d the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ seedlings were harvested and fixed and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or myc _METHOD_ of myc _PROTEIN_ was observed . in the dark the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and myc _PROTEIN_ proteins colocalized in the _LOCATION_ with diffuse _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . under r light they colocalized in large and bright nbs . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and myc _PROTEIN_ colocalized in both nbs and exhibited diffuse _METHOD_ under fr conditions _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . although the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and myc _PROTEIN_ proteins colocalized in the _LOCATION_ under all light conditions their different _METHOD_ patterns diffuse _METHOD_ small nbs and large nbs imply that they exist as various active _METHOD_ in the dark and under fr and r light conditions . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize in the same protein complex we conducted in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays . agrobacterium tumefaciens strains carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and myc _PROTEIN_ constructs were used to infect nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the plants were grown under fr light for d after which native protein was extracted from the leaves and subjected to co ip using antibodies against the myc epitope . myc tagged full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cc proteins copurified with _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ copurified with _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate whether the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the same protein complex is light dependent we compared the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by means of in vivo co ip assays using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ double transgenic line seedlings grown under fr or r light . the results suggested that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ interacted with myc _PROTEIN_ under both fr and r light . taken together these findings indicate not only that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize in the same protein complex under fr light but also that under fr light the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is important for their activities . fr exposure effectively promoted _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also enhanced _PROTEIN_ accumulation under fr light . to test whether _PROTEIN_ directly promotes _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ transport in response to fr light we compared the effect of different _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on _LOCATION_ transport of myc _PROTEIN_ during the transition from dark to fr light . in _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings _LOCATION_ transport of myc _PROTEIN_ increased by to over that of dark grown seedlings . relative _LOCATION_ myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels in col myc _PROTEIN_ seedlings were and that of dark grown _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ seedlings during the dark to fr light transition for and min respectively . over the same time course relative _LOCATION_ myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ seedlings were and compared with those of dark grown _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ facilitated the _LOCATION_ transport of _PROTEIN_ during the transition from dark to fr light . _PROTEIN_ which contains two putative _LOCATION_ localization sequences strongly localizes to the _LOCATION_ in both dark and light treated cells . our data demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ was involved in feedback regulation of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation under fr light and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed _LOCATION_ cotransport during the transition from dark to fr light . to determine whether synchronous _LOCATION_ accumulation of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is due to their direct interaction we tested their binding during the dark to fr transition using an in vivo co ip assay . at a comparable level of myc _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels evidently increased during the dark to fr transition compared with the dark control . note that _LOCATION_ accumulation of myc _PROTEIN_ was related to the amount bound to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during the dark to fr transition . thus we conclude that _PROTEIN_ promoted _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ through their direct interaction in response to fr light . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ acts as a repressor of seedling photomorphogenic development within the _LOCATION_ and light inactivation of _PROTEIN_ is accomplished by a reduction in its _LOCATION_ abundance . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally interdependent and _PROTEIN_ enhances _PROTEIN_ activation in the dark and under fr light . the enhanced etiolation phenotype conferred by a promoter driven gus _PROTEIN_ transgene is largely suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation under fr light but not in darkness . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the light regulated _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ we compared the _LOCATION_ abundance of gus _PROTEIN_ in the parental line and gus _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background both in the dark and under frc light . histochemical staining revealed that gus _PROTEIN_ was similarly enriched in the _LOCATION_ of hypocotyl cells in dark grown seedlings of the parental line and in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . however after an overnight incubation in gus staining solution _LOCATION_ gus _PROTEIN_ was clearly visible in the fr light grown seedlings of the parental line but was barely detectable in seedlings with the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . under fr light the cell frequency with _LOCATION_ enriched gus staining in the no wild type seedlings was fold higher than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings whereas no clear differences in the rate of _LOCATION_ enriched gus staining were observed between the seedlings of no gus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in the dark . immunoblot analysis showed that the _LOCATION_ gus _PROTEIN_ protein level in the no wild type background was or fold higher than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background in the dark or under fr light . these results matched the hypocotyl elongation and gus _LOCATION_ enriched staining results of no gus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ under fr light . the apparent reduction in the _LOCATION_ abundance of gus _PROTEIN_ was not due to reduced gus _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background as _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings showed stronger overall histochemical staining for gus _PROTEIN_ and accumulated much more cytoplasmic gus _PROTEIN_ protein than the parental plants . notably gus _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were comparable in the no wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds both in darkness and under fr light . these observations suggest that _LOCATION_ accumulation of gus _PROTEIN_ was impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background under fr light with a concomitant increase in its cytoplasmic accumulation . after demonstrating the functional deficiency of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in response to fr light we tested whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression enhanced the _LOCATION_ abundance of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . under fr light seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ double transgenic lines accumulated and fold more _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein respectively compared with seedlings of their parental line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ level of myc _PROTEIN_ in seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ double transgenic line was more than two times higher than that in its parental line _PROTEIN_ . additionally the _LOCATION_ protein level of gus _PROTEIN_ in seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ double transgenic line was higher than its parental line _PROTEIN_ . although the hypocotyl lengths of myc _PROTEIN_ and no gus _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were and times greater respectively than those of their wild types under fr light the hypocotyl lengths of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ double mutants remained and higher respectively than those of their parental lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . additionally _PROTEIN_ enhanced _LOCATION_ protein accumulation and hypocotyl elongation caused by myc _PROTEIN_ overexpression even in the absence of additional sugar under fr light . therefore _PROTEIN_ promotes seedling etiolation through enhancement of _LOCATION_ abundance of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ligase complex under fr light . previous studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an complex with _PROTEIN_ to mediate degradation of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ a basic domain/leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ that acts downstream of light signaling to promote photomorphogenesis . thus _PROTEIN_ abundance is correlated with not only the extent of photomorphogenic development but also the activity of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex . in the dark all col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings accumulated only almost undetectable amounts of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein . under rc light _PROTEIN_ promotes seedling deetiolation _PROTEIN_ abundance in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line seedlings was and respectively that of wild type seedlings . conversely _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line seedlings were and respectively compared with those of wild type seedlings under frc light . therefore we conclude that _PROTEIN_ enhances seedling etiolation under fr light via promoting activity of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex in the _LOCATION_ .
