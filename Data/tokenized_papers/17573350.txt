in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a _PROTEIN_ component of the root high affinity nitrate uptake system . its regulation has been thoroughly studied showing a strong correlation between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hats activity . despite its central role in plant nutrition nothing is known concerning localization and regulation of _PROTEIN_ at the protein level . by combining a green _METHOD_ protein fusion strategy and an immunological approach we show that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root cortical and epidermal cells and that several _METHOD_ of the protein _METHOD_ to co exist in cell _LOCATION_ . the monomer is the most abundant form of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ to be the one involved in transport . it strictly requires the protein to be _PROTEIN_ and addressed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . no rapid changes in _PROTEIN_ abundance were observed in response to light sucrose or nitrogen treatments that strongly affect both _PROTEIN_ mrna level and hats activity . this suggests the occurrence of post translational regulatory _METHOD_ . one such mechanism could correspond to the cleavage of _PROTEIN_ c terminus which results in the presence of both intact and truncated proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
tissular and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines were generated by _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ coding sequence was fused in frame to the end of the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of its own promoter . two transgenic lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ displayed both a correct regulation of the _PROTEIN_ of the transgene and a functional complementation of the mutant phenotype . in these lines the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was induced by both light and sucrose in the roots as it was the case for _PROTEIN_ in wt plants . the hats activity determined by root influx assays was also stimulated by the light/sucrose treatments in both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plants and restored at higher values than those measured in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . cell type specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was therefore studied by confocal microscopy in both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plants grown in vitro . in roots of _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ localized in the cortical cells along the primary and secondary roots except in the apical part of these roots where _METHOD_ was not present . no _METHOD_ was detected in the stele of the roots and in the leaves . these results were confirmed using the _METHOD_ line . in plants grown hydroponically _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also found in mature regions of the roots where in addition to the cortex it was also _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells and in root hairs . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was investigated in roots of plants grown in vitro using specific markers for cellular _LOCATION_ . the pm and the tonoplast were visualized after a short and a long incubation with the red _METHOD_ dye respectively . after a short incubation time _METHOD_ co localized with that recorded from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yielding a yellow staining of the pm in the overlaid image . after a prolonged incubation time _METHOD_ had entirely moved to the tonoplast and became clearly distinguishable from the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the overlaid image . finally to test the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ plants were treated with the vital _LOCATION_ tracker blue white dpx . images showed blue staining of the _LOCATION_ around the _LOCATION_ which co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the overlaid image . despite the _PROTEIN_ that the spatial resolution of these images may not be sufficient to allocate _PROTEIN_ to one specific _LOCATION_ they do show that _PROTEIN_ is not in the tonoplast and suggest that this protein is localized in both the pm and _LOCATION_ . immunochemical characterization of _PROTEIN_ in root cell _LOCATION_ further investigate _PROTEIN_ at the protein level two specific polyclonal antibodies called anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ were raised in rabbit against specific peptidic sequences within respectively an internal loop and the c terminus of the protein . the affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were tested on western blots with total microsomal _LOCATION_ purified from roots of hydroponically grown wt plants or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knock out mutants . as shown in fig . b and c both anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies revealed several bands at and kda . an additional band at kda was found with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody but not with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . these bands were all specific for _PROTEIN_ because they were absent in the microsomes from the two _PROTEIN_ knock out mutants . for all the bands the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody always gave the strongest signal and was thus preferentially used in most of the experiments . in pm enriched fractions only the bands at and kda were visible . with both antibodies the strong band observed at kda was by far the most abundant form of _PROTEIN_ in both microsomes and pm because it could be readily observed after a few minutes of exposure to film . by contrast several hours were required to get a visible signal for the other ones . it is likely that the band at kda corresponds to the monomeric isolated form of _PROTEIN_ . the apparent size of kda differs from its theoretical molecular _METHOD_ of kda . however this may be due to the hydrophobic nature of the protein as already seen with previously characterized sugar ammonium and nitrate transporters which all display in western blots an apparent lower molecular _METHOD_ than the theoretical one . the bands at and kda may reveal higher molecular _METHOD_ complexes incorporating _PROTEIN_ . for simplicity the highest molecular _METHOD_ band is referred to as the kda complex in the following text although its apparent size was found to vary between and kda depending on the blots . to make sure that the kda band corresponding to the isolated form of _PROTEIN_ is actually present in the native pm and is not a product resulting from the dissociation of the higher molecular _METHOD_ complexes we performed in vivo cross linking to stabilize protein complexes before pm extraction . cross linking was induced by adding formaldehyde to the nutrient solution min prior to harvesting for pm extraction . this markedly improved the detection of the band at kda . however this did not lead to the disappearance or a _PROTEIN_ in the intensity of the band at kda which remained strongly predominant in pm from plants treated with formaldehyde . as a control for the efficiency of protein protein cross linking the same blot was probed with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin that assembles in _LOCATION_ as tetramers . without cross linking only a monomer at kda and a dimer at kda of _PROTEIN_ were immunodetected on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . by contrast a trimer at kda and a tetramer at kda were clearly immunodetected upon in vivo cross linking . this last result validates the efficiency of formaldehyde induced cross linking . role of in the _PROTEIN_ and localization of _PROTEIN_ has been recently suggested that the hats in arabidopsis may actually be a dual component transport system involving both _PROTEIN_ and proteins . thus a possibility would be that the high molecular _METHOD_ bands at and kda correspond to _PROTEIN_ complexes . to investigate this hypothesis we used the knock out mutant for _PROTEIN_ to perform western blots on microsomes in comparison with the wild type wassilewskija . before extraction of microsomes plants were treated with formaldehyde during min to induce in vivo protein cross linking . the data obtained showed that the band at kda is only slightly affected in the mutant compared with the wt whereas the band at kda and surprisingly the major one at kda disappeared completely in the mutant microsomes . the absence of the major form of _PROTEIN_ in the mutant was also found using pm fractions and was not due to a defect in _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ because in our conditions the mutation did not affect _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation in the roots . furthermore the analysis of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene either in a wild type or in a background confirmed this result because despite ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the transgene mutation resulted in an almost complete loss of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with the pm . regulation of _PROTEIN_ abundance by light sugars and determine whether the abundance of _PROTEIN_ is regulated like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hats activity elisa and western blots were performed with pm or microsomes extracted from wt plants during a light/dark cycle and after various sugar or nitrogen treatments . to study the regulation of _PROTEIN_ in response to light and sugars pm were isolated from plants harvested at the end of a normal light period or after h into the night with or without sucrose supply . these treatments strongly affect both _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation and hats activity because both _PROTEIN_ more than after h of darkness but remain high when sucrose is supplied after the light/dark transition . surprisingly western blots did not reveal any significant changes in the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ form of _PROTEIN_ between the end of the light period and after h in the dark with or without sucrose . quantitative analysis by elisa confirmed this result showing that the total amount of _PROTEIN_ in the pm was not _PROTEIN_ after h of darkness and not increased by sugar supply in the dark . furthermore _PROTEIN_ abundance did not show any change at the beginning of the light period when plants were illuminated for h following the usual night period . sucrose supply also failed to increase the _PROTEIN_ level even during an extended h dark period after the h of normal night . concerning the band at kda it was detected in almost all pm extracts from plants in light or darkness with roughly the same intensity . these results obtained with both anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies are representative of several independent experiments leading to the conclusion that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ is neither regulated during the diurnal cycle nor by short term sucrose supply . nevertheless the amount of _PROTEIN_ in root pm did show a slight increase in response to light and sucrose supply following a h prolonged period of darkness . this increase remained however much lower than that observed at the mrna level . to further investigate the changes in _PROTEIN_ abundance in response to long term treatments down regulating both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hats activity we shifted to the study of the repressive effect of high nitrogen supply to the plants because we found this more physiologically relevant than several days of extended darkness . therefore we compared hydroponically grown plants provided with mm _PROTEIN_ as a nitrogen source or transferred either to nonrepressive moderately repressive or highly repressive media _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these treatments are known to strongly affect _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation within a few hours . a significant difference was observed in the abundance of both the _PROTEIN_ form of _PROTEIN_ at kda and the protein complex at kda in the root pm between plants supplied with mm _PROTEIN_ or mm for days . both bands were clearly more intense under mm _PROTEIN_ conditions suggesting regulation of the two _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ by the nitrogen status of the plant . this result was confirmed by elisa indicating a _PROTEIN_ in total _PROTEIN_ signal at mm compared with mm _PROTEIN_ . time course experiments however indicated that a significant decay of _PROTEIN_ in response to high nitrogen required several days of treatment . indeed transfer of the plants from mm to mm for h or days resulted in a and _PROTEIN_ in the total amount of _PROTEIN_ respectively . this repressive effect of high nitrogen supply was apparently not specifically due to the presence of in the nutrient solution because a moderate _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ abundance was also observed in response to the supply of mm as the sole nitrogen source . taken together these data indicate that unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ abundance is only slowly modified by light sugar or nitrogen treatments . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ protein is relatively stable in the pm and remains abundant for hours or days after transcription of the gene has been down regulated . this hypothesis is supported by the _PROTEIN_ that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide has only a slow effect on _PROTEIN_ abundance in the pm whereas it quickly reduced both _PROTEIN_ mrna level and influx . cleavage of the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ validate by another independent approach the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ abundance on pm is not regulated during the day/night cycle we used _METHOD_ transgenic plants to determine how the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein responds to light and sugar . _METHOD_ plants were grown for days on modified _METHOD_ medium containing mm _PROTEIN_ with or without sucrose . plants were pre treated for h in the light or dark before confocal imaging . under light conditions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was predominantly located in the pm and _LOCATION_ as described above independently on the presence of sucrose . plants pre treated for h in the dark with or without sucrose also showed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with pm/er . however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also surprisingly strongly observed inside the cortical cells filling a compartment that most likely is the _LOCATION_ . time course studies indicated that when plants were transferred in the dark after h of continuous light accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was observed after at least h of darkness and increased until h of darkness . in the reverse experiment where plants were transferred to the light after h of darkness _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which was observed both inside the _LOCATION_ and in the pm/er of cortical cells at the beginning of the experiment quickly disappeared from the inside of the cells after only h min of illumination and stayed only visible in the pm/er . the same results were found with _METHOD_ plants . to explain this observation western blots were performed with soluble proteins and pm fractions extracted from wt and _METHOD_ plants using both anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . as expected for a _LOCATION_ protein no signal was detected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody on the western blot performed with soluble proteins . however using the same extract a strong band was detected with the anti _METHOD_ antibody specifically in the _METHOD_ plants at kda which fits exactly the molecular _METHOD_ of free _METHOD_ . in agreement with the confocal microscopy data the _METHOD_ band was only recorded at night and quickly disappeared after light . this unexpected result suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is cleaved and that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ seen inside the _LOCATION_ in the dark is due to free _METHOD_ generated by this cleavage . this conclusion is fully supported by western blots performed with pm fractions of _METHOD_ plants using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in fig . three specific bands were detected in the pm of _METHOD_ plants a weak band at kda corresponding to the high molecular _METHOD_ complex observed in the wt a strong band at kda specific for _METHOD_ plants which approximately corresponds to the expected size of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and surprisingly a strong band at kda i.e . at the size of the native _PROTEIN_ protein in the wt . this last result was totally unexpected because no native _PROTEIN_ protein should be found in the pm from _METHOD_ plants as this line was obtained after transformation of the _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant . the simplest interpretation of these data is that the band found at kda in _METHOD_ pm is the portion of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein that remains after _METHOD_ has been cleaved off . interestingly free _METHOD_ was not found in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein with _METHOD_ fused at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and accordingly no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was recorded inside the root cortical _LOCATION_ when these plants were transferred for h in the dark . furthermore no _METHOD_ is observed in the root _LOCATION_ of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone under the control of the promoter .
