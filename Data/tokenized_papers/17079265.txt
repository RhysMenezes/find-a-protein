in flowering plants sperm cells develop in the pollen cytoplasm and are transported through floral tissues to an ovule by a pollen tube a highly _PROTEIN_ cellular extension . after targeting an ovule the pollen tube bursts releasing two sperm that fertilize an egg and a central cell . here we identified the gene encoding arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that it is allelic to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ only in the haploid sperm and is required for efficient pollen tube guidance to ovules . we identified an insertion _PROTEIN_ that disrupts the c terminal portion of the protein and tags mutant pollen grains with the _PROTEIN_ reporter . by monitoring reporter _PROTEIN_ we showed that _PROTEIN_ does not diminish pollen tube length in vitro or in the pistil but it reduces ovule targeting by twofold . in addition we show that the _PROTEIN_ sperm that are delivered to ovules fail to initiate fertilization . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein with an n terminal secretion signal a single transmembrane domain and a c terminal histidine rich domain . these results point to a dual role for _PROTEIN_ functioning in both pollen tube guidance and in fertilization . moreover our findings suggest that sperm long considered to be passive cargo are involved in directing the pollen tube to its target .
we used the gus pollen specific reporter gene which highlights the cytoplasm of every _PROTEIN_ pollen tube to refine our analysis of the _PROTEIN_ pollen tube growth and pollen tube guidance phenotype . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes have inherent growth defects we germinated _PROTEIN_ pollen in vitro and stained them for gus activity to differentiate between mutant and wild type pollen . _PROTEIN_ pollen tube germination was not affected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and after hours of growth in vitro _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were as long as those of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ stigmas were pollinated with _PROTEIN_ pollen to analyze pollen tube growth in the pistil . at hours after pollination the longest _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes had extended through of the ovary whereas the longest _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes had grown of the length of the ovary . at hours after pollination _PROTEIN_ and wild type tubes had traveled through and of the pistil respectively . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ does not limit pollen tube growth and that the inability to target ovules is attributable to a defect in the perception of pollen tube guidance cues . to define the stage at which _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes fail we monitored the path of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes in the ovary and determined the frequency with which _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes successfully enter a micropyle and burst . at hours after hand pollinating _METHOD_ pistils with control anthers heterozygous for the gus reporter gus activity was observed in the synergid cells of approximately half of the ovules as expected . by contrast when _PROTEIN_ anthers were used a smaller proportion of gus pollen tubes entered a micropyle and burst . furthermore _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were observed growing on portions of the ovule where wild type pollen tubes do not grow and also stalled on the funiculus . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes have a diminished capacity to enter the micropyle and burst within synergids because of defects in funicular and/or micropylar guidance . the _PROTEIN_ ovule targeting defect was not suppressed when competition from wild type pollen tubes was _PROTEIN_ . we pollinated wild type pistils with single _PROTEIN_ tetrads and after hours fixed and stained the pistils with aniline blue to follow the route of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . with a control tetrad donor of the pollen tubes that germinated were able to target and enter an ovule . by contrast of the pollen tubes from single _PROTEIN_ tetrads targeted an ovule a significant difference from wild type . these experiments indicate that only half of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes reached their target the same result as that obtained with excess pollinations . thus the observed _PROTEIN_ pollen tube guidance defect is not caused by an inability to compete with wild type pollen tubes for access to ovules but rather reflects an inherent pollen tube guidance defect . when _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ pollen were used to pollinate wild type pistils no mutant progeny were recovered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ completely blocks transmission of the mutant allele through the male . because _PROTEIN_ disrupts pollen tube guidance we addressed whether competition for available ovules from _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes masks rare _PROTEIN_ fertilization events by performing limiting pollinations of wild type pistils . we obtained seeds from ten crosses none inherited the _PROTEIN_ allele . this absolute block in transmission through pollen can not be explained by an approximately reduction in the ability of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes to target ovules . therefore _PROTEIN_ must also disrupt a step in reproduction that occurs after the contents of the pollen tube are released into the synergid cell of the _PROTEIN_ . we examined the development of seeds in self fertilized _PROTEIN_ flowers and found that _PROTEIN_ plants averaged seeds whereas _PROTEIN_ plants average seeds . _PROTEIN_ siliques had gaps where ovules failed to develop into seeds suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ in ovules targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes do not get fertilized . to test this hypothesis we pollinated wild type pistils with _PROTEIN_ pollen allowed hours for fertilization early embryo and endosperm development and then stained them for gus activity to identify ovules that had been targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . ovules targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes contained early globular embryos and obvious proliferation of endosperm _LOCATION_ . by contrast ovules targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes showed no indication of embryo or endosperm development . instead we consistently observed only the unfertilized central cell _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . we analyzed unstained ovules in wild type pistils pollinated with _PROTEIN_ pollen and found that contained only one central cell _LOCATION_ and that the remaining contained an embryo and several endosperm _LOCATION_ these values are consistent with the rate of _PROTEIN_ ovule targeting and when combined with the data from gus stained ovules suggest that when _PROTEIN_ sperm are released into the _PROTEIN_ they fail to fertilize the egg and central cell . one of the two synergid cells degenerates either just before or at the same time as the pollen tube enters the micropyle . in ovules targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes the central cell _LOCATION_ is the only _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ that remains hours after pollination . we hypothesized that in the absence of fertilization the egg _LOCATION_ degenerates and that the second synergid degenerates shortly after the pollen tube bursts . analysis of embryo and endosperm development at an earlier time point showed that both the egg and central cell remain in ovules targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes whereas an embryo and endosperm _LOCATION_ are clearly present in ovules targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ sperm are incapable of fertilizing the egg or central cell and suggest that in the absence of fertilization the egg cell degenerates following pollen tube reception . similarly mori et al . found that _PROTEIN_ sperm fail to fertilize and that they persist in the degenerating synergid hours after pollination whereas wild type sperm do not . presumably wild type sperm were not observed because they are rapidly transported to the egg and central cell where they bind these target cells and undergo plasmogamy . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ fertilization defect is due to a defect in sperm development or in migration of sperm within the pollen tube we analyzed _PROTEIN_ pollen grains and tubes throughout their development . dapi staining revealed morphologically normal sperm and vegetative _LOCATION_ . staining _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes either with aniline blue which binds callose _PROTEIN_ in the pollen tube walls or fm which becomes incorporated into the _LOCATION_ architecture of growing tubes showed that _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were indistinguishable from wild type . in newly germinated tubes the vegetative _LOCATION_ consistently exited the pollen grain before the two sperm _PROTEIN_ and as tubes elongated the sperm and vegetative _LOCATION_ were always in the subapical region of the tube _PROTEIN_ . within hour after pollination _PROTEIN_ vegetative _LOCATION_ emerged from the pollen grain ahead of the two sperm this normal male germ unit organization was _PROTEIN_ as the tubes migrated through the transmitting tract . these results indicate that defects of _PROTEIN_ pollen tube guidance and fertilization are not the result of aberrant pollen tube structure or sperm transport within the pollen tube . previously we used tail pcr to map the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion to the twelfth of exons in the single copy uncharacterized gene _GENE_ . no cdnas or ests corresponding to this gene were present in public databases so we used and _PROTEIN_ to generate a full length cdna and to annotate _GENE_ determining that the gene comprises exons instead of the predicted by the initial annotation of the arabidopsis genome . with pcr we confirmed both _PROTEIN_ t dna genome junctions as well as a bp genomic deletion at the insertion site . a second allele _PROTEIN_ with a t dna insertion in exon was identified from the signal collection this allele also caused distorted t dna segregation and completely blocked transmission through pollen . the location of the _PROTEIN_ allele is also indicated . to confirm that _GENE_ is indeed _PROTEIN_ we complemented the _PROTEIN_ defect by transforming plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ with a t dna carrying nptii and a wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ . the progeny of primary _PROTEIN_ transformants were collected and bastar and kanr were analyzed in ten transgenic families with a single locus insertion of _PROTEIN_ . the average rate of bastar among these families was and of kanr was . complementation of both ovule targeting and fertilization defects is expected to yield progeny that segregate bastar and kanr failure would lead to approximately bastar as observed in the progeny of self fertilizing _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicate that wild type _GENE_ rescues the _PROTEIN_ pollen tube guidance and fertilization defects . self fertilization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants yielded _PROTEIN_ homozygous progeny the progeny of which were bastar homozygous progeny were never observed when _PROTEIN_ is self fertilized . the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame is predicted to encode a amino acid protein with a n terminal signal sequence a single transmembrane domain and a c terminal histidine rich domain . _PROTEIN_ is not similar to any proteins with known functions and has no obvious functional motifs although several genes in flowering plants and in more distantly related _METHOD_ have been described . pair wise comparison of amino acid identity between the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from other flowering plants showed that the n terminal region is conserved whereas the c terminal region is more divergent . an alignment of the c terminal histidine rich regions showed that the presence of histidine is conserved among these proteins but that amino acid sequence is not . interestingly these histidine rich domains are present in _PROTEIN_ from _METHOD_ but not from other _METHOD_ . rt pcr and northern blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna is only detected in tissue samples that contain mature pollen . this specific _PROTEIN_ pattern is confirmed by hundreds of publicly available microarray experiments showing that _PROTEIN_ mrna only accumulates in pollen . to determine the precise location of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we fused a dna fragment corresponding to bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon to the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ this construct . accumulation of _METHOD_ was only observed in the two sperm cells contained within the cytoplasm of mature pollen grains _METHOD_ was not observed in uninucleate microspores or in bicellular pollen nor was it observed in other floral or vegetative cells . protein localization _METHOD_ predict that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine where _PROTEIN_ is localized within sperm we fused _METHOD_ to the penultimate codon of _PROTEIN_ exon _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ this construct . three independent transgenic lines were crossed with _PROTEIN_ plants and homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines were obtained in the generation of each cross indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented _PROTEIN_ pollen tube guidance and fertilization defects and suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a functional and properly localized protein . we detected the fusion protein only in the sperm cells . unlike the transcriptional fusion which produced _METHOD_ distributed throughout the elongated spindle shaped sperm cytoplasm the protein fusion was excluded from the _LOCATION_ and was predominantly perinuclear forming a _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ around sperm _LOCATION_ . however _METHOD_ was not limited to the perinuclear region and in many sperm cells _METHOD_ extended to the sperm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results in combination with protein localization predictions suggest that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly localized to sperm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ may also reside in other endomembranes including the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and control lines in the col background were grown at in hour e _METHOD_ lighting or in ambient greenhouse conditions . kanamycin resistance _PROTEIN_ was determined on _METHOD_ salts with kanamycin and bastar _PROTEIN_ was determined as by johnson et al . . plant transformation was performed as described selecting for growth on kanamycin or on soil with liberty herbicide . limiting pollinations were performed with male sterile _METHOD_ pistils and _PROTEIN_ anthers crosses producing or fewer seeds were analyzed . the _PROTEIN_ t dna gene junction was confirmed with the pcr primers _PROTEIN_ upstream and _PROTEIN_ downstream _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ t dna gene junction was confirmed with the pcr primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified from ng total pollen rna using primers f aaacaattttcaattcgcgtctccg and r aactcggatatatttttgc . for complementation a genomic _PROTEIN_ fragment was pcr amplified with f ggccctgcaggttctgatcctaacaacaacggcggc and r ccgcctgcaggatatcttcgagagaatcaccagtcgcc inserted into the sbfi site of sequenced introduced into agrobacterium and transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants selecting kanr . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ coding sequence guided annotation of the poplar ortholog from genomic sequence . other sequences were obtained from genbank lilium longiflorum oryza sativa _PROTEIN_ chlamydomonas reinhardtii cyanidioschyzon merolae plasmodium falciparum physarum polycephalum leishmania major . predicted proteins were aligned using clustalw and structure and subcellular localization was predicted with psort targetp genoplante predator prosite and tmhmm . pollen tube growth in pistils was analyzed as previously described . for in vitro analyses pollen from stage flowers was germinated for hours in an inverted drop of medium . pollen tubes or grains were transferred to polylysine coated slides and stained with dapi aniline blue fm or x _PROTEIN_ . all images were captured on a zeiss axioskop pollen tube lengths were measured using imagej . fertilization and embryo development was analyzed as previously described indicated samples were first stained for gus activity . northern blotting was performed on of total pollen rna probed with _PROTEIN_ cdna . rt pcr was performed on total pollen rna using the _PROTEIN_ primers f ttaatggcttgtatactcgccgg and r acgaaggcaatgcgcggtatttgcc and ef controls f gccccttcgtctcccacttc and r cacttcgcacccttcttgacg products were analyzed after and pcr cycles . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion contained bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon amplified using _PROTEIN_ ggcgagctcaatttccctgatacaatcccgaggc and _PROTEIN_ ggcggatcctttctctctcacggagacgcg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion contained the _PROTEIN_ promoter and all exons and introns and was amplified using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ggcccatggtactctcacgtagtctttgtttcctc . amplified products were digested with saci and bamhi or saci and ncoi respectively and introduced upstream of _METHOD_ followed by the camv polyadenylation sequence and incorporated into the binary vector . transgenic plants were analyzed using a zeiss axioplan equipped with a photometrics cooled ccd camera or a confocal _METHOD_ microscope _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed with openlab software . for analysis of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ during pollen development uninucleate bicellular and tricellular pollen grains were released from anthers and stained with dapi . they were then analyzed using a leica confocal microscope with a water objective using leica software . dapi was excited with a nm laser and detected at nm whereas the _METHOD_ was excited with a nm laser and detected at nm . pollen tubes were grown for up to hours in liquid media on an inverted microscope slide .
