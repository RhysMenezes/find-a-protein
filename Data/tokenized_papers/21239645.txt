flowering plant reproduction requires precise delivery of the sperm cells to the ovule by a pollen tube . guidance signals from female cells are being identified however how pollen responds to those cues is largely unknown . here we show that two predicted cation/proton exchangers in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are essential for pollen tube guidance . male fertility was unchanged in single _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . however fertility was impaired in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen . wild type pistils pollinated with a limited number of single and double mutant pollen producing fewer seeds than those pollinated with _PROTEIN_ single mutant pollen indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen is severely compromised . double mutant pollen grains germinated and grew tubes down the transmitting tract but the tubes failed to turn toward ovules . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes failed to enter the micropyle of excised ovules . green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ driven by its native promoter was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ mediated k transport as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli increased k uptake and growth in a ph dependent manner . we propose that by modifying localized cation balance and ph these transporters could affect steps in signal reception and/or transduction that are critical to shifting the axis of _PROTEIN_ and directing pollen growth toward the ovule .
to test whether chx genes _PROTEIN_ in pollen had a role in tube growth homozygous t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were first identified by pcr . total rna was extracted from pollen and seedlings and reverse transcribed . using three sets of primer pairs _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected specifically in pollen but not in the seedlings of wild type plants . however the _PROTEIN_ mutant contained a truncated transcript corresponding to a sequence upstream of the t dna insertion . no transcripts were detected using primer pairs corresponding to regions spanning or downstream of the t dna insertion site . the t dna is inserted in a region encoding transmembrane thus if transcribed a protein lacking transmembrane span and is probably not active . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in rna preparations of both seedlings and pollen . however there were no full length transcripts in seedlings or from pollen of either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant . partial transcripts corresponding to a region upstream of the t dna were also detected for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is unlikely to produce a functional protein as the t dna interrupted a region upstream of transmembrane region . however it is possible that protein produced from the _PROTEIN_ allele could be active as the transmembrane regions would be intact . it is unclear whether a t dna insertion at the hydrophilic region at the c tail would interfere with _PROTEIN_ activity . therefore we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are likely null alleles . although the effect of the _PROTEIN_ allele was less certain subsequent analysis of mutants demonstrated that it is a null mutant . we analyzed the segregation of progeny from self fertilized _PROTEIN_ mutants which harbored a _PROTEIN_ resistance cassette in the t dna insertion . the progeny yielded _PROTEIN_ resistant to _PROTEIN_ sensitive seedlings at a predicted ratio of . self fertilization of the plant _PROTEIN_ produced seedlings with the following phenotype wild type heterozygous and homozygous for _PROTEIN_ . this is near the expected ratio of . these results indicated that pollen carrying a single mutation in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was functional and fertile . furthermore in vitro germinated pollen from single mutant _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed tube lengths of or respectively similar to the wild type tube length of at h. thus pollen carrying a mutation in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed no defect in male fertility . disruption of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes causes defective male specific gene transmission bioinformatic analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resembled products of a gene duplication . the two genes are located on chromosomes i and ii in regions that underwent segmental duplication and their coding sequences are interrupted by two introns located at identical sites of the coding region although _PROTEIN_ has an extra intron . the n terminal region of both proteins is predicted to have transmembrane spans which share identity and the c terminal hydrophilic regions are identical . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant we investigated gene segregation in double mutants . first we identified plants that were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ examined their descendants after self fertilization . instead of the expected population of _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at a ratio of the observed result was close to . similarly the progeny of self fertilized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed segregation distortion . no double homozygous mutants were recovered in either experiment . the results indicated a defect in one or both gametophyte . to clarify whether the defect was due to male or female transmission reciprocal crosses with the wild type plant were made . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pistils were hand pollinated with wild type pollen the progeny produced the genotypes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ / and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at a ratio of . however when pistils of a male sterile wild type plant were pollinated with pollen from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant nearly all of the progeny produced was the single heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . mutant plants heterozygous for both genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were rarely encountered . wti flowers can not self fertilize as they are male impotent . similarly when wti pistils were pollinated with pollen from the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the progeny were single heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus gene transmission through double mutant pollen is severely compromised . as a mixture of single mutant and double mutant pollen are produced from either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants the genotypes of the surviving progeny indicated that pollen defective in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is functional while the pollen defective in both is not . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have redundant but essential functions in pollen . we examined whether a wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ could restore fertility to double mutant pollen . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with a construct that included the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame fused at its end to a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene . plants carrying the transgene were identified . in the generation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double homozygotes out of total plants were obtained . twenty eight of the remaining plants were wild type for _PROTEIN_ and were heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that wild type _PROTEIN_ alone was able to restore function to double mutant pollen . we concluded that the distorted gene segregation was indeed caused by mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to test whether a loss in male function in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen could be due to defective pollen development grains were examined by microscopy . pollen grains were collected from stage _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowers . this plant is expected to produce equal numbers of single and double mutant pollen . all the pollen grains were comparable to wild type grains as they contained three _LOCATION_ as shown by diamidino phenylindole staining and the grains turned purple after alexander staining . thus both single and double mutant pollen were viable and apparently had undergone normal pollen development . it is possible that the single mutant pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ would have a competitive advantage over double mutant pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in delivering the sperm to the ovule and that any growth of the double mutant pollen does not manifest due to excessive pollination . to test this possibility one pistil of a wti flower containing ovules was given a limited number of pollen grains . if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen is retarded in growth but still fertilization competent pollinating a wti pistil with a mixture of _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen would yield a similar amount of seeds as wti pistils pollinated by single mutant _PROTEIN_ pollen alone . seven days after pollination the seedpods were visibly long and mature seeds per pod were recovered in flowers pollinated with single mutant pollen . by contrast seedpods were small and contained approximately nine seeds per pod when pistils were pollinated with the same limited number of pollen grains containing a mixture of single and double mutants . despite ovules being in excess of pollen a reduction of seed set using a mixture of single and double mutant pollen suggested that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen was not merely slow or less competitive than single mutant pollen but that it was infertile . we next tested if the double mutant pollen might be impaired in germination or tube growth in vivo . after limited pollination using pollen grains the length and number of pollen tubes within the transmitting tract were examined h after pollination with aniline blue staining . the number of pollen tubes at a position mm below the stigma was or in single mutant or a mixture of single and double mutant pollen respectively . furthermore the lengths of the pollen tubes were similar for the single and double mutant pollen based on the number of tubes reaching the middle of the carpel hap . these results suggested that in vivo germination and tube elongation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen is comparable to that of single mutant pollen . a major _PROTEIN_ in studying the function of double mutant pollen from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ parent is the inability to separate the mixed population of male gametophytes with two genotypes in vivo . to help distinguish the double mutant pollen from single mutant pollen we generated a new mutant heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ harbors a t dna that contains the _PROTEIN_ reporter under the control of the pollen specific promoter . thus pollen carrying _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be distinguished from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after staining for gus activity . the mutant was generated by crossing homozygous _PROTEIN_ with homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . the plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was selfed and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ progeny were identified by _PROTEIN_ resistance and pcr . _PROTEIN_ single mutant pollen and a mixture of _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen were then tested for in vivo tube growth in wti pistils . at or hap the ovary was excised to remove the carpel wall and then stained for gus activity . at hap wild type pollen from plants _PROTEIN_ promoter gus had extended tubes more than half way in the transmitting tract . furthermore the ovules located in the top half of the ovary turned blue . this indicates that the soluble gus protein had been discharged along with sperm cells by the pollen tube at the ovule . pollen from the _PROTEIN_ single mutant was similar to that from wtgus pollen . by hap tubes had reached the bottom of the transmitting tract and all the ovules in the lower half of the carpel contained some blue coloring . the turning of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ single mutant pollen tubes at the funiculus and the presence of gus activity inside all of the ovules is striking indicating the discharge of pollen content into the embryo sacs . pistils that were not pollinated showed no gus activity in the transmitting tract or the ovules . interestingly we observed that the tubes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen which stained blue were inside the transmitting tract and were as long or longer as those of wild type tubes at hap . this result _METHOD_ the previous finding that double mutant pollen was competent in germination and tube extension in vivo . the tubes reached the bottom of the transmitting tract by hap . yet strikingly none of the ovules showed gus activity . the tubes stayed inside the transmitting tract and failed to reorient their growth to enter the funiculus which leads to the ovule . thus male infertility in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen is due to a failure to shift the direction of pollen tip growth at the funiculus and to target the ovule suggesting a failure in pollen tube guidance . we reasoned that the failure of double mutant pollen tubes to enter ovules could be a secondary consequence of defects experienced by pollen tubes in the ovarian transmitting tract . we tested this possibility by allowing double mutant pollen tubes to directly interact with ovules in a semi in vivo assay . in this assay we deployed a homogeneous population of double mutant pollen obtained from a rare _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plant . the mutant showed signs of sterility among the progeny of self fertilized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . vegetative growth bolting and the inflorescence in this mutant were indistinguishable from those of wild type plants however the siliques were reduced in size . over of the pods were barren and of the pods contained a single fully developed seed . these seeds germinated and the plants developed vegetative growth and flowers normally however like the parent they produced only five to seven seeds per plant . wti pistils were pollinated with wtgus or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen and then the ovary was severed at a site just below the junction between the style and the ovary and placed on pollen tube growth medium for h. wild type tubes emerging from the cut end of the ovary continued to grow on the medium and were competent to orient their growth toward the ovule . in experiments we found that out of total ovules were targeted by a blue wtgus pollen tube . discharge of gus into the ovule could be observed sometimes . however when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen was used only out of ovules were targeted by gus stained tubes . in addition we noticed that untargeted ovules would float away while targeted ovules stayed tethered to the tubes during enzyme reaction and buffer washes . apparently there is a tight physical association between the targeted ovule and the pollen tube . thus the attraction of pollen tubes to guidance cues from isolated ovules also depends on a functional _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . to understand the cellular role of the predicted _PROTEIN_ ion transporter _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ driven by the pollen specific promoter was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen after bombardment . we compared the _METHOD_ patterns of various markers with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and found that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was similar to that of an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and an _LOCATION_ lumen protein _METHOD_ hdel . to verify this possibility tobacco pollen was cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ hdel . merged signals from the _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ overlapped well in confocal images . moreover pollen from transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ native promoter also showed a similar reticulate pattern . thus _PROTEIN_ appears to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both transiently transfected tobacco pollen and stably transformed arabidopsis pollen . although most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal corresponded to reticulate _LOCATION_ the possibility that active _PROTEIN_ is localized to specific _LOCATION_ domains and to dynamic endomembranes that interact with the _LOCATION_ at the pollen tube tip remains to be examined . to test the predicted cation transport activity a cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ was cloned . we were unable to clone a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna that was not mutated . _PROTEIN_ cdnas consistently contained either a base deletion or substitution that would produce a truncated or an altered protein . _PROTEIN_ cdna was _PROTEIN_ in an escherichia coli mutant that grows poorly on low k medium due to defects in three k uptake _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ enhanced bacterial growth on yeast tryptone mannitol medium containing mm k . _PROTEIN_ restored growth similar to _PROTEIN_ which encodes an inward rectifying k channel . these results supported the idea that _PROTEIN_ has a role in k transport . using as a tracer for k we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ mediated k uptake . _PROTEIN_ dependent uptake was reduced by increasing the concentration of monovalent cations . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a monovalent cation transporter with a preference for cs k and rb relative to na or li . rb or k supplementation of medium containing mm k supported _PROTEIN_ dependent e. coli growth however cs or na supplementation did not . thus rb can partially substitute for k whereas cs or na can not . therefore k is the physiological substrate of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ enhanced cell growth was better at ph to than at ph or indicating that the transporter is ph sensitive . although the specific mode of k transport is unclear the results point to a potential role for _PROTEIN_ in regulating homeostasis of k h or both .

tested with gene specific primers of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes . finally it was confirmed that all of the _PROTEIN_ plants carried the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . as
