arabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase homolog d _PROTEIN_ functions as an essential regulator of reactive oxygen species . however our understanding of the regulation of _PROTEIN_ remains limited . by variable angle total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy we demonstrate that green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ organizes into dynamic spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these _PROTEIN_ spots have heterogeneous diffusion coefficients and oligomerization states as measured by photobleaching techniques . stimulation with ionomycin and calyculin a which activate the ros producing enzymatic activity of _PROTEIN_ increases the diffusion and oligomerization of _PROTEIN_ . abscisic acid and treatments also increase the diffusion coefficient and clustering of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . single particle analysis in clathrin heavy mutants and a artificial microrna line demonstrated that clathrin and microdomain dependent endocytic pathways cooperatively regulate _PROTEIN_ dynamics . under salt stress _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ assembles into clusters and then internalizes into the cytoplasm . dual color _METHOD_ cross correlation spectroscopy analysis further showed that salt stress stimulates _PROTEIN_ endocytosis via _LOCATION_ microdomains . we demonstrate that microdomain associated _PROTEIN_ spots diffuse at the _LOCATION_ with high heterogeneity and these dynamics closely relate to _PROTEIN_ activity . our results provide insight into the regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity by clustering and endocytosis which facilitate the activation of redox signaling pathways .
to examine the dynamic behavior of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an n terminal _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . we confirmed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein retains function by complementing the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype for plant growth and ros production . laser scanning confocal microscopy of the seedlings revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in most tissues consistent with previous reports and the available microarray data and with the proposed housekeeping role for _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of epidermal cells with high _PROTEIN_ in the leaves stomata hypocotyls and roots . we further analyzed the distribution of _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker . most _METHOD_ colocalized with the green _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . internalization increased with incubation time and we also observed some intracellular colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with . to determine whether _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ depends on vesicle trafficking we next used the vesicle transport inhibitor brefeldin a which can block vesicle transport from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ by interfering with _PROTEIN_ i vesicle formation resulting in the accumulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in bfa compartments . bfa treatment caused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to accumulate in the bfa compartment where it colocalized with . to rule out the possibility that the appearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the intracellular positive vesicles was due to newly synthesized protein we further investigated the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of the specific protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . after pretreatment with chx for min the transgenic seedlings were incubated with . we observed colocalization of and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . in addition and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ still accumulated in the bfa compartment in the presence of chx . these results indicate that constitutive endocytic turnover is likely an important process for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we then used va _PROTEIN_ to monitor the in vivo dynamics of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this technique allows us to image the plant cell cortex at high resolution and with a high signal to noise ratio . in the hypocotyl epidermal cells of the seedlings _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci formed discreet spots instead of distributing uniformly in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although we observed a few immobile spots most of the spots were mobile at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots exhibited various mobile behaviors in the focal plane of the cell cortex and most moved within the imaging plane before disappearing . some spots with high _METHOD_ intensity disappeared after long duration residence at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . other spots first appeared with low _METHOD_ intensity after reaching peak intensity their _METHOD_ then _PROTEIN_ and the spots disappeared . the kymograph also shows the turnover of single _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots . we further investigated the dynamic properties of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by determining the _PROTEIN_ mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using single particle tracking and a linear fit of mean square displacement _METHOD_ versus time plots . we used the rolling ball method to subtract the background of the images and plotted the diffusion coefficients on _METHOD_ and then fitted the data using the gaussian function in which we defined the gaussian peaks as the characteristic diffusion coefficients . in control seedlings we found that was with most of the diffusion coefficients ranging from to indicating a highly heterogeneous diffusion mobility for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition when we analyzed the raw images without subtracting the background we found that the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of the processed images . to evaluate the oligomerization state of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we performed calibration experiments examining purified _METHOD_ monomers by va _PROTEIN_ to determine the _METHOD_ intensity of a single _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecule . _METHOD_ intensities of the purified _METHOD_ monomers exhibited a unimodal distribution with a peak intensity of counts . furthermore we used va _PROTEIN_ to image the _METHOD_ intensity distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles in living cells . the _METHOD_ intensities were broadly distributed with most in the range of to counts which corresponds to one or two _METHOD_ molecules . to further investigate the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules in individual spots we used single molecule photobleaching as previously described . to reduce signal fluctuation due to the diffusion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in living cell _LOCATION_ we performed photobleaching in fixed seedlings . the number of bleaching steps ranged from one to two indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots include a mixture of monomers and dimers at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . binding and phosphorylation synergistically activate the enzymatic activity of _PROTEIN_ . thus we investigated whether these _PROTEIN_ also affect the _PROTEIN_ diffusion of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we first analyzed the effect of diphenyleneiodonium a well known nadph inhibitor on the _PROTEIN_ mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . dpi treatment caused a significant _PROTEIN_ in from in control conditions to in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in addition dpi caused the dimerization state of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ from in control to indicating that dpi may exert a specific effect on the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we then compared the dynamic behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the presence of dpi . like _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also formed distinct spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ ranged from to with a value of . we further examined the distribution of _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ which ranged from to counts . we found no significant change in the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ in cells treated with dpi and the value was indicating that dpi specifically affected the mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we also found that increasing influx through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using the ionophore ionomycin caused _METHOD_ intensities of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots to skew to higher values . in addition to the increase in the diffusion coefficient from in the control to increased intracellular levels also caused an increase in the dimerization state of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to . however in the presence of ionomycin both the diffusion coefficient and intensity of _METHOD_ spots showed no significant changes . we then investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using the ser/thr protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin a and the general kinase inhibitor k . calyculin a caused an increase in both the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to and its dimerization state to . by contrast the diffusion coefficient and intensity of _METHOD_ spots did not change significantly in seedlings treated with calyculin a . in contrast to calyculin a k caused a reduction in the diffusion coefficient to and the dimerization state to . however k had no significant effect on the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ . these results suggest that and phosphorylation the key regulators of nadph oxidase activity also affect the _PROTEIN_ mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating a close relationship between _PROTEIN_ enzymatic activity and protein dynamics at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in abscisic acid responses we used va _PROTEIN_ to examine the effects of aba on the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . aba induced an increase in the mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the diffusion coefficient increased to . the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein intensity also skewed to higher values which ranged from to counts and the number of dimers increased to . in addition increased the mobility and intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as compared with the control . in the presence of the diffusion coefficient increased to . the intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ranged from to counts supplemental figure and the number of dimers increased to . these results further indicated that both aba and can increase _PROTEIN_ mobility and induce its clustering at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . endocytosis plays an important role in controlling the internalization of nutrients and the composition of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . clathrin mediated endocytosis has been extensively characterized and clathrin coated pits facilitate the diffusion of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . tyrphostin which inhibits mammalian ap binding of endocytic cargo inhibits clathrin mediated endocytosis in mammalian and plant cells . thus we investigated whether affects _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics . the results showed that not only increased the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots but also caused an increase in the size and _METHOD_ intensity of the spots . in contrast the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots _PROTEIN_ mostly in the range to and was markedly lower than the control . to further examine the effects of the clathrin dependent pathway in the internalization of _PROTEIN_ we crossed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a clathrin heavy chain mutant . as shown in figure numerous _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots accumulated at the _LOCATION_ in the mutant and some of the spots clustered into large particles . additionally the _PROTEIN_ mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also _PROTEIN_ significantly to a of . we further analyzed the effects of tyrphostin the inactive analog of and found that had no significant effect on the distribution and dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in seedlings treated with the diffusion coefficients of _PROTEIN_ ranged from to with a value of . we also found that did not affect the size _METHOD_ intensity or density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots . to further address the role of clathrin in _PROTEIN_ trafficking in plant cells we generated transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ an mcherry tagged _PROTEIN_ translational fusion under the control of the native promoter and evaluated the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and clathrin . we used dual color va _PROTEIN_ to image seedlings coexpressing mcherry _PROTEIN_ and clc _METHOD_ . to investigate cortical mcherry _PROTEIN_ and clc _METHOD_ dynamics we chose spots in which both mcherry _PROTEIN_ and clc _METHOD_ were present and determined their codiffusion at the _LOCATION_ . for quantification we considered the particles to codiffuse when at least one pixel of their _METHOD_ signals overlapped during at least five frames with an interval of _METHOD_ as previously reported . we found that mcherry _PROTEIN_ colocalized with clc _METHOD_ and codiffused away from the focus gradually indicating that _PROTEIN_ internalization associates with the clathrin dependent pathway . we also made more precise calculations by tracking the trajectories of these spots according to the method reported previously . these spots codiffused at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for s and kept their distance within nm to each other . to quantify the degree of colocalization we calculated the protein proximity index _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a quantitative measure of the colocalization of proteins which can give a value between and . figure shows a plot of the cross correlation of mcherry _PROTEIN_ and clc _METHOD_ as a function of pixel shift . a sharp peak at the zero pixel shift that decays abruptly by moving the image in the x and y axes further supporting specific colocalization . the mean protein proximity value was which further confirmed the specific _PROTEIN_ and clc association in the cell cortex . sterol and sphingolipid enriched _LOCATION_ microdomains may modulate the localization and activity of certain _LOCATION_ proteins . for example _LOCATION_ microdomains affect nox dependent ros signaling in picea meyeri pollen tube growth . furthermore a previous plant proteomics analysis identified _PROTEIN_ in the detergent resistant _LOCATION_ fraction . therefore we investigated the role of _LOCATION_ microdomains in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics using the sterol disrupting agent methyl cyclodextrin . external application of resulted in redistribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into small clusters with larger sizes and an increased _METHOD_ intensity . interestingly treatment induced changes in the distribution of the diffusion coefficients into two subpopulations one of which exhibited a diffusion coefficient similar to control cells and the other with slower diffusion . these results imply that sterol based _LOCATION_ microdomains affect the localization and dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate the role of these microdomains in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ we performed parallel experiments by introducing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into the sterol deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a hypomorphic allele of squalene _PROTEIN_ which functions in the synthesis of sterols in plant development and shows very low ros production due to mislocalization of nadph oxidases . as previously reported _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ confined to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in control seedlings . however we observed faint and discontinuous _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . additionally some _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots were located near the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . these findings indicated a close relationship between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization and _LOCATION_ microdomains . we further examined the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ microdomains by analyzing the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ microdomain marker _PROTEIN_ which is involved in a clathrin independent endocytosis pathway in plant cells . under dual color va _PROTEIN_ we found that both mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci formed clear spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ some of which were overlaid when the two channels were merged suggesting partial colocalization . to evaluate the relative contribution of _LOCATION_ microdomains to the regulation of mobility of _PROTEIN_ we also analyzed the codiffusion of mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we found that mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalization disappeared gradually with increasing distance from the focus . this result eliminated the possibility that colocalization represented simple random overlap of highly dense spots at the _LOCATION_ . the trajectories of these spots further showed that mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ codiffused at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for s at a distance of within nm . we also evaluated the degree of colocalization using the _PROTEIN_ method . figure depicts a cross correlation plot of figure as a function of pixel shift a sharp peak at the zero pixel shift that decayed abruptly upon movement of the image in the x and y axes indicating their specific colocalization . the mean _PROTEIN_ was . we also detected _PROTEIN_ mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots in the _PROTEIN_ artificial microrna knockdown line which shows a reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcript level and growth defects . as shown in figure the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots shifted to lower values and was further confirming that the _PROTEIN_ diffusion of _PROTEIN_ depends on the _LOCATION_ microdomain . additionally to investigate the role of and phosphorylation in the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we treated seedlings coexpressing mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with ionomycin or calyculin a and then imaged them with va _PROTEIN_ . the results showed that the mean protein proximity value increased to and after ionomycin and calyculin a treatments respectively indicating that both and phosphorylation enhanced mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalization . _PROTEIN_ plays a key role in the response to salt stress and salt acclimation requires the ros generated by _PROTEIN_ . therefore we used to investigate the dynamics and endocytic pathways of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under salt stress . under control conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes homogenously with at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as assessed by confocal microscopy . treatment with mm nacl produced a change in the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the appearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in discrete intracellular patches labeled with suggesting that salt stress enhanced the endocytosis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we then assessed the changes in dynamic partitioning of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ caused by nacl treatment using va _PROTEIN_ . consistent with increased endocytosis nacl treatment induced a _PROTEIN_ in the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while the diffusion coefficient of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots increased ranging from to . also was after treatment with mm nacl versus under control conditions . in seedlings treated with nacl and or nacl and the of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to and respectively suggesting that nacl treatment increased the endocytosis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and that disruption of the _LOCATION_ microdomains and clathrin coated pits differentially inhibited the diffusion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore we analyzed the abundance of protein in the presence of salt stress using immunoblots . we found that nacl induced the degradation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to some extent . however wortmannin an efficient inhibitor of protein trafficking to the plant _LOCATION_ inhibited the degradation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compared with the control seedlings . to further investigate the relationship between _PROTEIN_ localization and recycling at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we measured the density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by fcs . this technique allows analysis of _METHOD_ intensity fluctuation within the focal volume of the laser beam . stable _METHOD_ fluctuation indicated that no significant photobleaching effects occurred during the detection time . the mean density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was in control seedlings . treatment with and caused an increase of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density to and respectively suggesting that clathrin dependent endocytosis is the _PROTEIN_ pathway for internalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of nacl _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density _PROTEIN_ to further supporting the nacl induced internalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however when seedlings were pretreated with or before nacl treatment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density increased to and respectively indicating that the disruption of these endocytic pathways differentially inhibited nacl induced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ internalization . to further evaluate whether the interactions of mcherry _PROTEIN_ with clathrin dependent endocytosis or _LOCATION_ microdomain protein _PROTEIN_ changed under different conditions we applied dual color fccs to seedlings coexpressing mcherry _PROTEIN_ and either clc _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . fccs facilitates quantitative investigation of protein interactions in live cells in which fluctuations of two different _METHOD_ signals are recorded simultaneously and analyzed using a cross correlation function . the relative cross correlation amplitude of seedlings coexpressing mcherry _PROTEIN_ and clc _METHOD_ was while that of seedlings coexpressing mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was . after nacl treatment the cross correlation of mcherry _PROTEIN_ with clc _METHOD_ increased to while that with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ increased to both showing significant differences . overall these results support the notion that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is internalized via both clathrin dependent and _LOCATION_ raft associated pathways .
