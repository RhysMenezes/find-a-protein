understanding how the _PROTEIN_ of transcription _PROTEIN_ genes is modulated is essential for reconstructing gene regulatory networks . there is increasing evidence that sequences other than upstream noncoding can contribute to modulating gene _PROTEIN_ but how frequently they do so remains unclear . here we investigated the regulation of tfs _PROTEIN_ in a tissue enriched manner in arabidopsis roots . for tfs we created _METHOD_ reporter constructs driven by each tf s upstream noncoding sequence fused to the _METHOD_ reporter gene alone or together with the tf s coding sequence . we compared the visually detectable _METHOD_ patterns with endogenous mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns as defined by a genome wide microarray root _PROTEIN_ map . an automated image analysis method for quantifying _METHOD_ signals in different tissues was developed and used to validate our visual comparison method . from these combined analyses we found that the upstream noncoding sequence was sufficient to recapitulate the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern for of the tfs and of the tfs undergo posttranscriptional regulation via microrna mediated mrna degradation or via intercellular protein movement . the results suggest that for arabidopsis tfs upstream noncoding sequences are major contributors to mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern establishment but modulation of transcription _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ pattern after transcription is relatively frequent . this study provides a systematic overview of regulation of tf _PROTEIN_ at a cellular level .
tfs _PROTEIN_ in a tissue enriched manner were identified from the published root mrna _PROTEIN_ map . the map was generated by using microarray profiling of _METHOD_ marked and sorted arabidopsis root tissues . it covered the quiescent center stele endodermis epidermis and _PROTEIN_ root cap . of the genes on the _PROTEIN_ array currently annotated as tfs are enriched > fold in one of these five tissues . we essentially randomly selected about one third of these tfs generating transcriptional fusions to _METHOD_ for and translational fusions for . the constructs were made with the versatile multisite gateway cloning system . the transcriptional fusions were constructed by using _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ driven by kb of upstream noncoding sequence or the entire upstream noncoding region whichever was shorter . we included the in our constructs because annotation of transcription start sites was not always available . the translational fusions were made by inserting the coding region of each tf in frame upstream of nontargeted _METHOD_ with the same upstream sequences as those used in the transcriptional fusions . at least tf proteins from various families have been shown to remain functional when fused in this fashion to _METHOD_ at their c terminus . these transcriptional and translational constructs were transformed into plants and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern generated in the root was imaged by using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the genes analyzed the length of the upstream sequence used and the number of lines analyzed for each construct can be found in table which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site . confocal images of roots for each construct are available in the arex database and in fig . which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site . several tissue specific _METHOD_ lines were produced specific to the endodermis quiescent center phloem or xylem and these lines can be used to further refine the root _PROTEIN_ map as well as for a wide range of other studies . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of these transcriptional and translational _METHOD_ fusions were compared with the in vivo mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern of each gene as derived from the root _PROTEIN_ map . root map _PROTEIN_ profiles have been shown to accurately reflect published mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns from in situ hybridization for of genes and thus provide a reliable estimation of mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns in vivo . to enhance the resolution of the _PROTEIN_ map we profiled three additional radial tissues in the root . combined with previously described profiles from six other tissues the resulting root _PROTEIN_ map covers nine nonoverlapping tissues and represents most of the cell populations found along the radial axis of the root and in the root cap . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ patterns were visually compared with the mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns estimated from the microarray data by using a ranking method the absolute microarray intensity values from the nine tissues of the _PROTEIN_ map were ranked and the two patterns were scored as being the same if the _METHOD_ signal was found only in tissues consecutively ranking at the top otherwise they were scored as different . in the cases where the transcriptional _METHOD_ and microarray _PROTEIN_ patterns were scored as being the same it was concluded that the upstream noncoding sequence was sufficient to recapitulate the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern . this visual rank based comparison is sensitive to our ability to detect _METHOD_ . to corroborate this method we developed an automated image analysis program by which the _METHOD_ signals in the different tissues are converted into numerical values . we trained the algorithm to identify four tissues of the root elongation zone for which we have direct microarray data . we were able to analyze images from transcriptional fusion constructs for which relative green _METHOD_ levels were quantified for the four cell types . pearson correlation coefficients between the relative _PROTEIN_ levels determined by the automated image analysis method and the microarray data were calculated and plotted for each image and each gene . among the genes analyzed had been found to have a different pattern with the visual rank based method . three of these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had the lowest average correlation coefficients . the other two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had high positive correlation coefficients but in both cases the difference in _PROTEIN_ patterns was based on _PROTEIN_ in tissues not identified by the automated imaging algorithm _PROTEIN_ . thus there were no false different calls by the visual nonparametric ranking method on this set of genes . the automated image analysis method confirmed that our visual approach reliably identifies differences between _METHOD_ and microarray _PROTEIN_ patterns . also digital images of rna in situ hybridizations or _METHOD_ reporter constructs are emerging as alternative data to assess tissue specific _PROTEIN_ at single cell resolution and have been used to reconstruct regulatory pathways in the development of drosophila and arabidopsis . the technique developed here to analyze root images is currently limited to analyzing _PROTEIN_ in the elongation zone but could be extended to the rest of the root . this development will constitute a valuable resource for transcription network reconstruction studies . as such it could also be used to study subtle changes in _PROTEIN_ patterns which are not visually detectable . the results of the visual rank based comparison of the _METHOD_ and microarray _PROTEIN_ patterns were used to assess the overall ability of upstream noncoding sequences to recapitulate mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns . among the transcriptional fusions generated we were not able to detect _METHOD_ visually in any root tissue for of them . it is possible that some of these transcriptional fusions did not generate detectable _METHOD_ because the mrna is naturally _PROTEIN_ at a low level . indeed for these genes the maximum microarray _PROTEIN_ value in the nine profiled tissues was significantly lower on average than for genes whose transcriptional fusion recapitulated the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern . in any case we excluded these fusions from further analysis because the ability of an upstream regulatory sequence to recapitulate an mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern can not be assessed without detectable _METHOD_ . we also excluded four other fusions with visible _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tissues not covered by the microarray _PROTEIN_ map . of the remaining transcriptional fusions were scored as having the same mrna and _METHOD_ transcriptional fusion _PROTEIN_ patterns . therefore our analysis suggests that the noncoding sequence within kb upstream of a tf is sufficient for driving the endogenous mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern in of the cases . summary comparison of transcriptional and translational fusion _PROTEIN_ patterns with mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns from the root _PROTEIN_ map nine of the tfs exhibited different transcriptional _METHOD_ and mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns based on the microarray data . these differences seem to reflect real discrepancies between the endogenous mrna pattern and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . indeed only one gene _PROTEIN_ exhibited a dramatic difference between its transcriptional _METHOD_ and mrna _PROTEIN_ domains from the root _PROTEIN_ map . all of the other genes showed differences among neighboring cell types and these differences are unlikely to be because of contamination of neighboring tissues in generating the microarray data because the _PROTEIN_ levels in the neighboring tissues are dramatically different . furthermore independent confirmation of the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern from in situ hybridization data has been published for one of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . an incomplete upstream noncoding sequence limited to kb had been used for four of these nine transcriptional fusions . however we think it is unlikely that this incomplete upstream noncoding sequence is the reason for the failure to recapitulate the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern because we find a similar proportion of incomplete noncoding sequences among the transcriptional fusions that gave the same _PROTEIN_ pattern . thus a more likely explanation is that regulatory elements downstream of the start site are necessary to modify the _PROTEIN_ pattern conferred by the upstream noncoding sequence . consistent with this hypothesis for one of these nine genes the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern was restored in the translational fusion probably mediated by microrna mediated mrna degradation as described in the next section . overall our results suggest that for of arabidopsis tfs regulatory regions sufficient for reconstituting mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns reside within kb of the upstream noncoding region . interestingly of known transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites in humans are found within kb upstream of the transcription start site . however for the remaining sequences not contained within our transcriptional fusions such as the introns or the coding region are probably required for modifying the mrna pattern conferred by the upstream sequence . this modification results in a modest expansion or reduction of the _PROTEIN_ domain in most cases . indeed a recent study in drosophila suggests that microrna mediated regulation is an important means of modulating the boundaries of the _PROTEIN_ domain . such effects might not have been easily recognized by using traditional rna in situ hybridization data . thus refining the microarray _PROTEIN_ map further is likely to reveal more genes regulated by sequences other than the upstream noncoding sequences . gene _PROTEIN_ patterns can be affected by various posttranscriptional events including rna degradation and intra and intercellular protein trafficking . from the tfs for which the transcriptional fusion yielded detectable _METHOD_ we obtained translational fusion data for . of these translational fusions yielded no visible _METHOD_ and had _PROTEIN_ that was inconsistent between independently transformed lines . we found notably different translational and transcriptional _PROTEIN_ patterns for of the remaining genes reduced in breadth in and expanded in cases . to estimate how often coding sequences affect _PROTEIN_ patterns we compared these pattern changes to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ pattern obtained from the microarray data . the translational pattern was reduced in breadth compared with the transcriptional pattern for phabulosa and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . phabulosa is a known target of microrna in shoots and the closest paralog of _PROTEIN_ was shown to be regulated by the same microrna . translational _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was suppressed in the quiescent center for both genes and in the endodermis and cortex for phabulosa matching the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern from the microarray data . therefore addition of the coding sequence for this gene allows the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern to be recapitulated . for _PROTEIN_ the transcriptional and mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns had been scored as the same . however this scoring is still consistent with mrna degradation occurring because the mrna _PROTEIN_ in the tissue where it is putatively suppressed ranked lower than in other tissues with visible _METHOD_ in the transcriptional fusion . in summary among the tfs for which the transcriptional fusion recapitulated the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern are likely to be posttranscriptionally regulated by microrna mediated mrna degradation . it is noteworthy that in both cases the effects take place in the quiescent center a tissue involved in suppressing differentiation of the surrounding initial cells . in an animal study stem cell differentiation was shown to be suppressed by the down regulation of genes inducing differentiation this effect partly taking place via micrornas . consistent with this finding _PROTEIN_ profiling also showed enrichment of genes involved in mrna silencing in the quiescent center . we found the translational pattern to be increased in breadth compared with the transcriptional pattern for eight tfs . movement between cell layers has been described as functional for other plant tfs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ based on differences in protein and mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns and _LOCATION_ localization in the tissues into which the protein has moved . here for six tfs _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ in the tissues in which the pattern was expanded . the transcriptional fusion recapitulated the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern for four of these six tfs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because the expansion in _PROTEIN_ pattern must occur after the establishment of the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern in these cases it is likely that it occurred via cell to cell protein movement as shown for _PROTEIN_ in ref . citation . therefore among the tfs for which the reporter mrna is _PROTEIN_ in the appropriate tissues are likely to undergo posttranscriptional modification via intercellular protein trafficking . for the other tfs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because the transcriptional and mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns were scored as different the protein might not be _PROTEIN_ in its native tissue . nevertheless because the mrna and translational _PROTEIN_ patterns are also different the expansion of their pattern is unlikely to be because of mrna movement . whether tf protein movement between cells is an active or passive process is still debated . our results are not consistent with a passive process based on three observations . first for passively moving proteins smaller proteins were shown to move more effectively than larger ones presumably dependent on the size exclusion limits of plasmodesmata . here the size distribution of moving and nonmoving tfs overlapped . second it has been suggested from studies of _PROTEIN_ movement that proteins move unless they are retained in a specific subcellular compartment . partially supporting this idea both cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization was found for translational _METHOD_ movement within the stele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however among all moving and nonmoving tfs a similar proportion of moving tfs was found for those that were not _LOCATION_ localized and those that were . our observation suggests that cytoplasmic localization is necessary but not sufficient for intercellular protein movement . third for the three genes for which the expansion occurred within the vasculature _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ expansion occurred throughout the entire tissue . in contrast in the cases where expansion occurred to nonvascular tissues _PROTEIN_ it only occurred to the adjacent cell layer . this observation provides further evidence that the ability of a tf to move can depend on the cell type in which it is _PROTEIN_ . in summary our results suggest that movement of tfs is more likely an actively regulated rather than a simple size dependent passive process . besides regulation of intercellular movement tf activity might also be regulated via modulation of subcellular localization as has been previously reported in plants and animals . for of the translational fusions that had detectable _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein was not found to be _LOCATION_ localized in any of the root tissues . because only two of these _METHOD_ fusion proteins had different transcriptional and mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns ectopic protein _PROTEIN_ is unlikely to be the reason for this lack of _LOCATION_ localization . assuming that the annotation of these ten genes as transcription _PROTEIN_ is correct it is thus possible that this regulatory mechanism is relatively common for transcription _PROTEIN_ . in summary by comparing mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns with transcriptional and translational reporter patterns we have obtained an estimate of the relative importance of transcriptional and posttranscriptional _METHOD_ in regulating tf _PROTEIN_ patterns in the arabidopsis root . we conclude that upstream noncoding sequences control the major patterns of transcription and that movement of tf proteins is relatively common . these data will provide valuable information for future gene regulatory network analyses .
a list of transcription _PROTEIN_ represented on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ array was compiled from three tf databases . this list was then used to search the microarray data for tfs with a two fold enrichment in one tissue as compared with all of the others . two fold enrichment was chosen based on _PROTEIN_ in experiments . also was set as the minimum level in the enriched tissue because of the genes with _PROTEIN_ levels below that value were called absent by the affymetrix software . all of the tfs found enriched in the endodermis stele and atrichoblasts were cloned whenever this cloning was successful and tfs of interest to our laboratory were selected for the quiescent center and the _PROTEIN_ root cap . since these tfs had been selected the total arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ list has been expanded to genes . among these tfs tfs were found enriched by using our query criteria . therefore this selection represents an essentially random subset of about one third of the tfs _PROTEIN_ in a tissue enriched manner in arabidopsis roots . microarray profiling of the phloem xylem and cortex was performed by using lines containing promoter _METHOD_ constructs from the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively with two biological replicates for the phloem and three for the other two . the plants were grown on sucrose nutrient agar and profiled as described in ref . citation . other microarray profiling data are from birnbaum et al . _PROTEIN_ nawy et al . and levesque et al . . all microarray data were globally normalized to of the average _PROTEIN_ value with software . transcriptional and translational _METHOD_ reporter fusion constructs were generated by using the multisite gateway three fragment vector construction system . upstream noncoding sequences were isolated by using nested pcr for the first reaction by using primers outside the region of interest and columbia ecotype genomic dna as template and for the second reaction by using nested primers with recombination sites and matching sequences to the region of interest and the first pcr product as template . these pcr products were then cloned by recombination into the appropriate vector . clones were sequenced and those with no more than one indel mutation per kilobase were selected . for translational fusion constructs for each gene a full length cdna without the stop codon was isolated by reverse transcription pcr _PROTEIN_ and directionally cloned into pentr/d topo by using the pentr directional topo cloning kit . to directly perform the final recombination into a plant transformation vector we cloned an ccdb cmr fragment from pdest into hindiii and xhoi sites of pgreenii and replaced the selection marker with spectinomycin resistance . this modified vector was then recombined with the upstream noncoding sequence clone and either _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ for the transcriptional fusions or the clone of a coding region and _METHOD_ with no localization signals for the translational fusions . the final constructs in agrobacterium were transformed into columbia ecotype plants by using the floral dip method . transformed plants were selected with basta on soil and to day old seedlings were grown and imaged by using confocal laser scanning microscopy as described in ref . citation . an average of six independently transformed lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed for each tf . images from transcriptional fusions showing _PROTEIN_ in the elongation zone of the root were selected and automatically analyzed to retrieve _METHOD_ signal values in the stele endodermis cortex and epidermis . these _METHOD_ signal values were then aligned to the microarray data values and both were normalized for contrast enhancement by subtracting and setting resulting negative values to zero . eighty four images remained after removal of those with no detectable _PROTEIN_ after this enhancement . the _METHOD_ signal and microarray data values were then converted to a relative intensity level and for each image a pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the microarray and the _METHOD_ signal values in the four tissues . the resulting correlation coefficients were plotted with respect to their gene . images with low correlation coefficients were investigated and of these outliers were found to be from incorrectly mapped tissue types derived from the image analysis and were removed from the analysis . the automated image analysis was performed as follows . after each _METHOD_ image was separated into red green _METHOD_ and a blank blue channel and analyzed in three phases noise removal on the green channel application of a series of morphological filters and partial subtraction of the red channel to remove refraction noise and cross talk of the red stain for cleaner separation of tissue layers and contrast enhancement labeling of the tissue types determination of the outer cell boundaries of the root by using a contour tracking algorithm and labeling the tissues by using a template reference image of a typical cross section quantification and normalization of the _PROTEIN_ values in each tissue type . first _METHOD_ intensity values for all pixels in each tissue were summed . the sum was divided by the total area of each tissue type to provide relative _PROTEIN_ values for the tissues similar to the gene _PROTEIN_ map data and to normalize variation in magnification . all image processing and analysis was performed by using the software program matlab image processing toolbox .
