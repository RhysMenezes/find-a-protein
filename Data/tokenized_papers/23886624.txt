the ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ is an integral component of the eukaryotic ribosome large subunit . besides being a constituent of ribosomes and participating in protein translation additional extraribosomal functions in the _LOCATION_ have been described for _PROTEIN_ in different _METHOD_ . previously we demonstrated that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes are involved in development and translation under ultraviolet b stress . in this work transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusions show that while and are _PROTEIN_ both in the female and male reproductive organs _PROTEIN_ is restricted to pollen grains . moreover the characterization of double _PROTEIN_ mutants indicates that the three differentially contribute to the total _PROTEIN_ activity in the male gametophyte . all three proteins _PROTEIN_ accumulate in the _LOCATION_ but also in the _LOCATION_ suggesting extraribosomal functions . after uv b treatment only localization increases in the _LOCATION_ . we also here demonstrate that the three genes can complement a yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant . finally the involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in uv b responses was analyzed by two dimensional gels followed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . overall our data provide new evidence about the nonredundant roles of _PROTEIN_ proteins in arabidopsis .
we have previously shown by reverse transcription quantitative pcr analysis that are _PROTEIN_ in leaves roots _METHOD_ and flowers . in order to analyze the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ of in more detail we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters as described in materials and methods. histochemical gus staining of d old seedlings reveals a high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in young leaves mostly in dividing cells and in the hydathodes while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in this organ . seven day old roots also showed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root tips and _PROTEIN_ root primordia while _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not detected . in d old plants similar _PROTEIN_ patterns to d old seedlings were detected with gus staining being present only for _PROTEIN_ . genes also show _PROTEIN_ differences in the female and male reproductive organs . _PROTEIN_ of and was detected in pistils anthers and pollen grains while was only detected in pollen grains . in immature siliques the _PROTEIN_ of the three genes was different . for gus staining was present in the valves septum and developing seeds while _PROTEIN_ was limited to developing seeds . also showed _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds but with a weaker intensity than and . we have previously shown that _PROTEIN_ is essential for the female gametophyte as the mutant alleles cause female gametophyte lethality while _PROTEIN_ has an important role during plant development . on the contrary under standard growth conditions _PROTEIN_ single mutants showed a phenotype that is indistinguishable from wild type plants both at the vegetative and reproductive stages suggesting functional redundancy within the _PROTEIN_ gene family alternatively it could have a role under different stress conditions . in order to analyze the functional redundancy between genes in more detail we generated double mutants by crossing the single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants _PROTEIN_ as the male parent . the resultant population of the _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cross produced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at a ratio indicating a distortion in the transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele through the male gametophyte when the _PROTEIN_ alleles are present . similarly when _PROTEIN_ plants were crossed with _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ of progeny had the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genotype while was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this deviation from the expected ratio in both crosses indicates that _PROTEIN_ has an effect in the transmission through the male gametophyte when the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ gene is mutated . on the contrary when _PROTEIN_ was crossed with _PROTEIN_ the resultant population was heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we further screened the resultant selfed progeny for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . again the _PROTEIN_ allele was transmitted to the progeny at a frequency lower than expected for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants of the progeny included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants while had _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genotypes . similarly for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants constituted of the total whereas was represented by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the expected frequencies were found for the selfed progeny from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . moreover reciprocal crosses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed unaffected transmission of the mutant alleles through the female and male gametes while reciprocal crosses using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants as a male parent yielded unexpected ratios in progeny confirming the impaired transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele through the male gametophyte . after genotyping more than plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were not found indicating that the presence of at least one functional _PROTEIN_ allele is essential for plant viability when one _PROTEIN_ allele is present . moreover to generate the _PROTEIN_ triple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were crossed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants as male and female parents respectively . siliques did not develop and all had aborted embryos indicating that the triple mutant is not viable . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were indistinguishable from their parent _PROTEIN_ single mutants . likewise _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants looked like wild type columbia plants . to confirm the absence of functional compensation in the _PROTEIN_ family by variations in their transcript levels we performed rt qpcr analysis using rna from the three double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and similar _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were detected in single mutants double mutants and wild type plants . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins exhibit to similarity and also share a high degree of primary sequence conservation with other eukaryotic orthologs for example they show similarity with s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ . based on this we investigated whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins can complement an s. cerevisiae conditional lethal mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene . the strain was used for these experiments in which the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ from its genomic locus but under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter consequently this strain is unviable under repressing conditions in the presence of glc while it grows similarly to the wild type strain with gal . we _PROTEIN_ the coding region of each under the control of the constitutive gdp promoter using the _PROTEIN_ vector as well as under the control of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter using the centromeric vector . in both cases the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ from the same plasmids as positive controls . serial dilutions of transformed yeast were plated on selective medium with glc and simultaneously in the same medium with gal to verify the homogenous growth in all cases . the _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins as well as the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein in transformed strains was verified by immunoblot assays showing an immunoreactive band in all cases . figure a and b shows yeast growth using the _PROTEIN_ vector . after incubation for and d at complementation was observed with either of the proteins however the rate of growth was lower than the one reached with the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein . when each was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter transformed yeast showed the formation of colonies with all the constructs but the rate of growth was slower than that observed using the _PROTEIN_ promoter . taken together these results demonstrate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins are functionally equivalent to the s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ the three proteins can rescue the lethality due to the absence of the endogenous protein . by coimmunoprecipitation studies using arabidopsis leaves we have previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ proteins associate with proteins localized in the _LOCATION_ and with proteins involved in cytoplasm _LOCATION_ traffic suggesting that at least one of the _METHOD_ may have extraribosomal functions in the _LOCATION_ . to examine the subcellular localization of each isoform we generated arabidopsis transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ each as a fusion protein to the n terminus of the _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _METHOD_ . transgenic plants were selected and examined by rt qpcr as described in materials and methods . it should be mentioned that it has been reported that _METHOD_ tagged ribosomal proteins are correctly incorporated into the ribosomes . here to verify that _METHOD_ fusion proteins are functional in arabidopsis plants we transformed the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants with a construct _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ driven by the promoter . as previously published these mutants exhibit an abnormal growth phenotype . progeny were indistinguishable from wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating the ability of the _METHOD_ fusion protein to complement mutant plants in the _PROTEIN_ gene and consequently the functionality of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis . thus given the high identity between _PROTEIN_ proteins from arabidopsis we assume that all _METHOD_ proteins are functional in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ fusions were _PROTEIN_ detected in the _LOCATION_ but _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ . all three fusion proteins exhibit a necklace appearance suggesting their association with rough _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ribosomes as described for the human _PROTEIN_ . in order to quantify the _METHOD_ localization in the _LOCATION_ we measured the percentage of _LOCATION_ stained with dapi that also showed detectable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as described by citation . for all three proteins approximately of the _LOCATION_ had detectable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ without significant differences between the three _PROTEIN_ proteins . we also analyzed _METHOD_ localization in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the promoter _METHOD_ in order to discard the presence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ as a result from the cleavage of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . in these transgenic plants _METHOD_ was only detected in the _LOCATION_ . previously we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ were uv b regulated and _PROTEIN_ were involved in translation under uv b stress . therefore we examined whether uv b radiation regulates _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization . after h of exposure with uv b radiation and did not show changes in their subcellular distribution however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ increased by about in the _LOCATION_ after the treatment . both and are regulated by uv b radiation is repressed while is induced after a h uv b radiation treatment . in addition we here show that _LOCATION_ localization of is increased after uv b irradiation . thus in order to investigate metabolic processes in which and _METHOD_ could be involved and their participation in responses under uv b stress we carried out gel electrophoresis to compare changes in the leaf proteome of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants under control conditions in the absence of uv b and after uv b irradiation with those in wild type plants as reported previously for _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutant plants . the differential proteomes were analyzed in two different ways the proteomes from the mutant plant leaves were compared with those from wild type plants under the same radiation conditions for each plant type we compared their proteomes under control conditions and after uv b irradiation and only proteins that were differentially uv b regulated in the wild type and mutant plants were selected . for _PROTEIN_ mutants a total of protein spots showed differential levels _PROTEIN_ in at least one of the comparisons and interpretable tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spectra were obtained for of the spots . of these spots were similarly changed as observed previously in the _PROTEIN_ mutants while spots were exclusively differential for the _PROTEIN_ mutants . under control conditions in the absence of uv b nine protein spots were increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants while eight protein spots were _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants however after a h uv b treatment the number of proteins that changed in _PROTEIN_ mutants was increased to _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation more severely affects protein _PROTEIN_ patterns after a uv b exposure than under control conditions . similarly when we compared the proteomes of both plants after the uv b treatment _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited a higher number of proteins that were _PROTEIN_ by uv b than those increased . also some proteins that were changed by uv b in wild type plants did not show any difference in the mutants after the same treatment . total identified proteins were classified according to their functions . the functional groups with the largest number of proteins differentially changed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants in comparison with the wild type plants after the uv b treatment are involved in photosynthesis stress and detoxification respiration protein biosynthesis and posttranslational _METHOD_ . other groups include proteins implicated in dna metabolism rna metabolism signaling and cell division and cycle . in summary general processes in plant metabolism and growth are affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant after uv b exposure as was observed previously for _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutant plants . thus although _PROTEIN_ mutants are not more sensitive to uv b radiation than wild type plants these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ may also be involved in translation under uv b conditions . for _PROTEIN_ mutants a total of protein spots showed differential levels _PROTEIN_ in at least one of the comparisons . supplemental figure shows a representative gel of the proteome of _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves after a h uv b treatment used in one set of comparisons . interpretable tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spectra were obtained for of the spots . these differential spots were not identified in the same analysis using the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . under control conditions in the absence of uv b nine protein spots were increased while eight protein spots were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with wild type plants however after a h uv b treatment the number of proteins that changed in _PROTEIN_ mutants was increased to _PROTEIN_ suggesting as observed for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants that the _PROTEIN_ mutation more severely disrupts the protein _PROTEIN_ pattern after a uv b exposure than under control conditions . in addition when we compared the proteomes of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants after the uv b treatment some proteins that changed by uv b in the wild type plants did not show any difference in the mutants after the same treatment . identified proteins were classified according to their functions . the major group of identified proteins corresponds to proteins involved in stress responses _PROTEIN_ biotic stress representing and of the total in control and uv b conditions respectively . some proteins can be grouped in more than one process for example spot is involved in rna metabolism and biotic stress while spot can be grouped with proteins involved in cell division and biotic stress . other important groups include proteins implicated in rna metabolism protein metabolism photosynthesis and signaling . it is noteworthy that a high percentage of proteins identified are predicted to be localized in the chloroplast with a lower proportion in the _LOCATION_ . networks of associations were generated for proteins that showed different levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in comparison with wild type plants under uv b stress . in particular when analyzing the enrichment of any particular biological process in each network _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a significantly larger number of proteins involved in stress responses . by contrast _PROTEIN_ mutants showed proteins involved in general biological and metabolic processes and a lower percentage of proteins involved in stress responses than _PROTEIN_ mutants . in general predicted interactions were found between proteins belonging to the same functional group although some proteins did not show any interaction with proteins in the networks for both mutants .
