leaves are reported to contain a secreted that accumulates during senescence or after biotic or abiotic stress however a gene encoding this enzyme has not been described . because a secreted amylase is isolated from _LOCATION_ starch the function of this enzyme is difficult to predict but _METHOD_ evidence suggests that it may degrade starch after cell death . the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three genes one of which _PROTEIN_ has a putative signal sequence suggesting that the protein may be secreted . two independent insertion mutants in _PROTEIN_ lacked an amylase band on starch _METHOD_ which was previously named . washed leaf protoplasts contained reduced activity suggesting that the enzyme is secreted . native _PROTEIN_ fused to a weakly _METHOD_ form of _METHOD_ was sensitive to proteinase k infiltrated into leaf apoplastic spaces while a _LOCATION_ form of _METHOD_ was unaffected until cell breakage confirming that the _PROTEIN_ protein is secreted . amylase was transcriptionally induced in senescing leaves and in leaves exposed to heat stress treated with abscisic acid or infected with pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato _PROTEIN_ . the amylase was also extremely heat resistant and its _PROTEIN_ was in _PROTEIN_ an activated defence response mutant .
arabidopsis contains three genes with strong similarity to previously characterized genes named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ the focus of this study encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted _METHOD_ of kda . it has a typical signal sequence as predicted by psort and targetp indicating that it likely enters the secretory pathway . _PROTEIN_ also encodes a kda protein but it contains no predicted targeting signals . _PROTEIN_ is considerably larger encoding a protein of about kda with a predicted chloroplast transit peptide . none of these proteins are more than identical to each other and are thus not likely to have arisen from recent gene duplications . the proteins are also not likely to be functionally redundant given their putative cellular localizations . in order to compare these three arabidopsis with those from other plants we aligned their amino acid sequences using clustalw and then constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree . as observed by stanley et al . the sequences clustered into three clades that correlate perfectly with their predicted molecular _METHOD_ and the presence or absence of specific targeting sequences . clade i includes _PROTEIN_ and contains sequences that range from to amino acids each with a putative signal sequence . clade ii includes _PROTEIN_ and consists of sequences that range in size from to amino acids with no predicted targeting signals while clade iii includes _PROTEIN_ and contains sequences that are all much larger than the others ranging from to amino acids . each member of clade iii contains a putative chloroplast transit peptide and aligns with the smaller in their halves . it is worth noting that the three sequenced plant genomes of arabidopsis rice and black cottonwood all contain at least one member in each of the three clades suggesting that each clade is important to plant function . stanley et al . also noted that the pinus taeda _PROTEIN_ sequence tag collection included sequences from each clade . two insertion mutants in _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the salk collection and named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pcr analysis confirmed that the insertions were in the _PROTEIN_ gene . segregation analysis revealed that the first mutant _PROTEIN_ had integration at only a single locus but _PROTEIN_ contained insertions at two independent loci . to eliminate the second insertion we crossed an _PROTEIN_ plant with a plant and isolated a line with the insert in _PROTEIN_ that yielded seeds with a ratio of to sensitive progeny indicating that it contained insertions at only a single locus . sequencing across the _PROTEIN_ insertion border confirmed that the inserts in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were in the third exon and the third intron respectively . for all subsequent experiments we used homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . leaf extracts from mutant and plants were subjected to native _PROTEIN_ and the mutants were found to lack a yellow to band previously identified by lin et al . as amylase while other activities remained largely unchanged . in order to visualize the difference between _PROTEIN_ mutant and extracts more clearly all of the protein extracts used in the gel illustrated in fig . were obtained from leaves by floating on aba for h which induces activity . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves always lacked with or without exogenous aba treatment indicating that the mutants were not simply unresponsive to aba . in starch _METHOD_ the colour of bands generated is indicative of the type of enzyme that acted on the starch and in this case the colour of the band is consistent with it being an . the red band below and several other starch hydrolases including a grey were present in both mutants and leaves as were several other unidentified minor bands . the presence of a putative signal peptide at the of _PROTEIN_ suggests that it enters the secretion pathway . vacuum infiltration followed by centrifugation has been used to extract apoplastic from pea _METHOD_ or tobacco leaves . however due to the small size of arabidopsis leaves and _METHOD_ we had only marginal success using this approach to isolate apoplastic fluids from arabidopsis . instead we attempted to localize the protein using two approaches analysing washed protoplasts for the presence of activity and localizing _METHOD_ in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _METHOD_ fusion protein . if activity is localized in the apoplast digestion of the cell wall during preparation of protoplasts should release activity into washing solutions . the analysis of broken protoplasts on native _PROTEIN_ should result in the absence of activity . crude leaf extracts from leaves contained and activity while washed protoplasts prepared from leaves of the same age contained amylase but lacked almost entirely indicating that it may be _LOCATION_ or loosely associated with the cell wall and/or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . additional activities observed in the protoplast lane were due to contaminating starch hydrolases present in the enzyme preparations used to make the protoplasts as seen by comparison to lane . to localize _PROTEIN_ using _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence with its native signal sequence was inserted into the vector between the promoter and _METHOD_ creating _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was then introduced into arabidopsis plants using floral transformation . control plants were transformed with unmodified containing _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ migrated at the predicted molecular _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ immunoblots and exhibited activity in native _PROTEIN_ . however the activity we detected in _METHOD_ transgenic lines migrated as a triplet of protein bands in about the same position as suggesting alternative folding or proteolytic processing had occurred . when _METHOD_ was inserted into the _PROTEIN_ background activity was restored confirming that activity is encoded by the _PROTEIN_ gene . unfortunately _METHOD_ microscopy failed to show a strong _METHOD_ signal above the autofluoresence normally observed in plants in either the _METHOD_ or the _METHOD_ plants . the lack of _METHOD_ was most likely due to the type of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ employed in this study . we therefore used an alternative strategy to determine if _METHOD_ was in the apoplast . we reasoned that cell _LOCATION_ should protect the _LOCATION_ control _METHOD_ from degradation by infiltrated proteinase k while _METHOD_ would be sensitive to degradation only if it was located in the apoplast . proteinase k by syringe into leaves of both types of transgenic plants resulted in the degradation of the _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein but had no effect on the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ after min . to expose intracellular _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ to degradation by proteinase k the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was solubilized by first infiltrating with triton and proteinase k and then heating the leaf discs to for min . after this treatment the _METHOD_ in both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was degraded . the results of the protoplasting experiments and the leaf infiltration experiments both indicate that _PROTEIN_ is located in the apoplast of leaves . young and mature leaves of arabidopsis plants contained amylase at low levels as determined by native _PROTEIN_ but the level was highly elevated with age and in senescing leaves . levels of the other starch hydrolases visible in this native gel system generally declined in older leaves . amylase a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in phloem tissue increased from to weeks and then declined in the plants . analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mrna level increased over between and plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated at the level of transcription . leaf senescence is an organized developmental programme influenced by plant age as well as environmental conditions such as nutrient supply shading or temperature . phytohormones such as aba ethylene or methyl jasmonate can also induce senescence . certain stresses and hormones such as aba are also able to induce genes that are directly responsive to those treatments . because many genes are regulated by aba we tested the effect of aba on the levels of activity and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels . when detached leaves were floated on aba for h the level of activity increased slightly after the first h of treatment and dramatically after d while the levels of other activities remained constant . in control leaves treated with the same level of ethanol used to dissolve the aba activity did not change over the d period . the aba effect could be observed with as little as aba but with and aba the induction was much stronger . revealed that h after spraying with aba the level of the _PROTEIN_ mrna increased almost in plants while in and plants the levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna increased and respectively . aba accumulates in plants in response to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses and in turn it regulates a large number of genes . we examined two such stresses that we reasoned would induce _PROTEIN_ and lead to cell death or _LOCATION_ leakage such that the secreted amylase might gain access to starch and influence cell survival infection by a bacterial pathogen and heat stress . leaves of plants were with or cfu ml of p. syringae pv . tomato _PROTEIN_ . this bacterial strain induces localized and systemic disease resistance in arabidopsis plants containing the _PROTEIN_ resistance protein . leaves were inoculated with p. syringae pv . tomato at a low inoculum to monitor any slow changes in amylase activity that might occur over time . in contrast leaves were inoculated with a high concentration of the bacteria to induce a rapid localized cell death response and systemic acquired resistance . in leaves infected with the low dose of bacteria was elevated d after inoculation as compared with leaves . leaves infiltrated with the high dose of bacteria exhibited hr within h. after d activity was induced in the uninfected leaves of the same plant indicating that disease resistance led to systemic induction . while inductions of activity were moderate they were consistently observed in repeated experiments . heat stress also led to elevated activity . after h in darkness at amylase was induced as compared with plants held in darkness at . in order to determine if the enzyme itself was heat stable we prepared a crude leaf extract in water to mimic the conditions in a dead cell milieu where no buffer no additional ions reductant or protease inhibitors would be found . when held at for up to min we could detect no major differences in the type or quantity of starch hydrolases in a native gel . at the red band was lost by min while and activities were unchanged after min . at only amylase activity was resistant to heat denaturation . because the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was induced both by senescence and by infection with avirulent p. syringae pv . tomato we decided to investigate the level of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis which constitutively _PROTEIN_ systemic acquired resistance and is hypersenescent . revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was in _PROTEIN_ plants relative to plants of the same age . despite numerous attempts we have not been able to observe consistent phenotypic differences between and _PROTEIN_ mutants in _METHOD_ of their starch levels throughout senescence in response to stress or aba treatment or in the growth of avirulent p. syringae pv . tomato in infected leaves .
