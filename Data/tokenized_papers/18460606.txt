xylogalacturonan is a class of pectic polysaccharide found in plant cell walls . the arabidopsis thaliana locus _GENE_ encodes a predicted type ii _LOCATION_ protein and insertion mutants of the _GENE_ locus had _PROTEIN_ cell wall xylose . immunological studies enzymatic extraction of polysaccharides monosaccharide linkage analysis and oligosaccharide _METHOD_ profiling were employed to identify the affected cell wall polymer . pectic xga was reduced to much lower levels in mutant than in wild type leaves indicating a role of _GENE_ in xga biosynthesis . the mutated gene was designated xylogalacturonan _PROTEIN_ . transformation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the wild type gene restored xga to wild type levels . _PROTEIN_ protein heterologously _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana catalyzed the transfer of xylose from udp xylose onto oligogalacturonides and endogenous acceptors . the products formed could be hydrolyzed with an xga specific hydrolase . these results confirm that the _PROTEIN_ protein is a xga xylosyltransferase . the protein was shown by _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ fusion protein in n. benthamiana to be localized in the _LOCATION_ vesicles as expected for a glycosyltransferase involved in pectin biosynthesis .
the locus of _GENE_ has an open reading frame made up of four exons . the gene structure is supported by isolation of full length cdna clones . the encoded protein of amino acid residues is calculated to have a polypeptide molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the protein is predicted to be targeted to the secretory pathway and to have a signal anchor with a single transmembrane helix from residues to . these features are typical for a type ii _LOCATION_ protein . sequence similarity to other cazy family proteins suggests that the protein is an inverting glycosyltransferase . inverting glycosyltransferases invert the configuration of the anomeric _PROTEIN_ in the nucleotide sugar substrate . the protein has four sites predicted by netnglyc to be n glycosylated . based on the data reported below we designate the protein xylogalacturonan _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . two independent t dna insertion lines in _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the syngenta sail collection and from salk . the two mutant lines are designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . homozygous lines were identified by pcr . for _PROTEIN_ pcr yielded a product of expected size consistent with location of the t dna as indicated in the database . however in the case of _PROTEIN_ the insert proved to be located bp downstream of the position reported by salk . consequently the t dna insertion of _PROTEIN_ was concluded to be located bp upstream of the stop codon of _PROTEIN_ as verified by sequencing . this insertion leads to substitution of the last amino acid residues of the _PROTEIN_ protein and hence alters the highly conserved c terminal region of the protein . the insertion lines were investigated using real time rt pcr . for _PROTEIN_ no transcript was detected but for _PROTEIN_ the disruption of the gene did not lead to any significant destabilization of the _PROTEIN_ mrna . relative transcript level of the _PROTEIN_ locus we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ adult leaves juvenile leaves and roots by real time rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ is most highly _PROTEIN_ in adult leaves and at twice the level found in juvenile leaves . in _METHOD_ and roots the transcript level is and respectively compared with the level in adult leaves . these findings are in good agreement with data from publicly available array experiments except that we found a lower _PROTEIN_ in roots than reported in other experiments . analysis of public array data showed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is highly increased by biotic stresses such as infection with botrytis and pseudomonas and abiotic stresses such as nutrient deficiency whereas infection with agrobacterium tumefaciens or nematodes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ is strongly increased by senescence and _PROTEIN_ by cytokinin . since family glycosyltransferases are likely to be involved in cell wall biosynthesis we determined the effect of insertional mutagenesis of _PROTEIN_ on the monosaccharide composition of cell wall material isolated from adult leaves obtained from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a reduction of in the xylose content was observed for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas no other monosaccharides were significantly altered . the reduction in xylose in the _PROTEIN_ mutants was consistently observed in all experiments performed and varied from to between experiments . neither the _PROTEIN_ plants nor the _PROTEIN_ plants displayed any visible difference in growth phenotypes compared with quartet and columbia respectively . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is like other mutants in the syngenta sail collection made in the qrt genetic background . recently qrt was shown to encode a pectin methylesterase but it is primarily _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains and is not _PROTEIN_ in leaves and _METHOD_ . the qrt and col lines were indistinguishable in monosaccharide composition in the tissues investigated in this study and also did not differ in growth phenotype . therefore qrt is considered the wild type in this study . several cell wall polymers contain xylose to varying degrees including xyloglucan xylan xga and rgii . a range of approaches were used to determine in which polymer xylose was reduced . immunomicrodot assays using cell wall specific antibodies were performed to probe the relative levels of galactan arabinan xyloglucan and xylan in a range of organs/tissues in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . this analysis did not reveal any significant differences in the levels of the investigated polymers in any of the samples tested . although not extensively characterized xga is another xylose containing polymer in arabidopsis cell walls . presently the amount of xga in the walls can not be accurately determined but the study by citation showed that up to of the pectin from leaves could be hydrolyzed by the specific enzyme xga hydrolase . to identify the affected polymer in the mutant we treated cell wall material from leaves with endopolygalacturonase and pectin methylesterase and analyzed the monosaccharide content in the extracted pectin fraction and in the remaining residue _METHOD_ . this analysis demonstrated that there was no difference in the xylose content in the residue between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the extraction of pectin was equally efficient in both genotypes with of the rhamnose and of the galacturonic acid released . the stochiometric rha/gala ratio in the pellets was near in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ indicating that a near to total extraction of hg and xga was achieved while approximately one third of the rgi remained in the pellet . to further investigate the pectin we purified the high molecular _METHOD_ fraction representing rgi and xga from the released material . the monosaccharide composition analysis of the isolated rgi/xga showed a substantial _PROTEIN_ from to mol of xylose in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type _METHOD_ . consistently a reduction of terminal xylose was observed in the same fraction clearly indicating a significant reduction of the xylose substituted hg . monosaccharide analysis also indicated a reduction in gala from to . this is in agreement with the reduced xylose assuming a xyl/gala ratio in xga of . notably the monosaccharide and linkage analyses confirmed the absence of xyl xyl and glc proving that the rgi/xga preparations did not contain any detectable hemicellulose contamination . to investigate linkage of uronic acids we conducted a separate linkage analysis after reduction of uronic acids _METHOD_ . the procedure is not optimal for determining content of neutral sugars therefore the results were obtained independently . to more easily compare the data they have been compounded into one table . the data showed a mol _PROTEIN_ in the content of branched gala residues gala in the mutant in agreement with the reduction in terminal xylose . interestingly the ratio of rha and rha was altered . in the wild type of rha was in the rha form indicating that on average approximately every third rhamnose residue had a side chain . in the mutant the rha constituted . hence rgi of _PROTEIN_ contains a more highly substituted rgi chain . this is consistent with an increase in galactose in the rgi/xga fraction and of gal and t gal in the linkage analysis suggesting an increase in pectic galactan in this enzyme solubilized fraction . monosaccharide composition and linkage analysis of rgi/xga isolated from adult leaves from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ the highly _PROTEIN_ content of terminal xylose residues in pectin isolated from _PROTEIN_ indicated that xga was the affected polymer . to specifically compare the presence of xga in the cell wall of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants we used xga hydrolase a highly specific enzyme that has no detectable activity with hg or any other pectic polysaccharide besides xga . xga hydrolase accepts xylosylated gala residues in both and positions hence the product of xga digestion with the enzyme is a mixture of xylogalacturonides and oligogalacturonides . a pectin enriched fraction from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants was treated with xga hydrolase and subsequently analyzed by hpaec _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . nine different oligosaccharides including the isomer could be identified in the enzymatically treated pectin fraction obtained from wild type plants whereas no oligosaccharides were detected from _PROTEIN_ . some xga could also be detected in the residue after pectin extraction in the wild type but no xga derived oligomers could be detected in _PROTEIN_ residue . as expected the _PROTEIN_ product from the wild type was followed by a significant formation of gala galaxyl and and a minor production of and . although it can not be excluded that xga that is resistant to xga hydrolase exists in _PROTEIN_ the xga content in _PROTEIN_ is clearly reduced compared with the wild type . a monoclonal antibody with specificity for xga was raised against a highly substituted form of xga and has previously been described . immunolabeling of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ was used to determine if this xga epitope was affected in _PROTEIN_ . the xga epitope has a highly restricted distribution in arabidopsis and was only detected in roots and siliques . binding was identical in these organs in qrt and _PROTEIN_ . our biochemical analysis indicated that xga is abundant in leaves and the lack of binding to this xga may be because the xga in leaves does not have a sufficient level of xylose substitution to be recognized by . labeling of leaves with the anti hg mab and calcofluor which stains linked _PROTEIN_ indicated that hg levels and overall cellular anatomy were not affected in _PROTEIN_ . together with biochemical analyses these data indicate that a less substituted form of xga that is abundant in leaves is a likely product of _PROTEIN_ but that the highly substituted xga epitope recognized by is not . the identical wall phenotype in the two independent alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ strongly indicates that the lack of functional _PROTEIN_ protein is directly responsible for the _PROTEIN_ xga content . to further substantiate this we performed a complementation experiment . in _PROTEIN_ plants that were transformed with a construct carrying _PROTEIN_ under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ the reduced xylose content of the cell wall material was restored to the wild type level . transformation of qrt plants with the same construct had no effect on the monosaccharide composition . these experiments show that the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence can complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . furthermore introduction of a construct _PROTEIN_ a recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein fused to a combined c myc affinity tag in its c terminal end adding a total of amino acids _PROTEIN_ also complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . by contrast complementation was not obtained when the _PROTEIN_ plants were _PROTEIN_ an n terminally truncated version of the _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the first amino acid residues comprising the signal anchor and part of the stem region _PROTEIN_ . the truncated version corresponds to cdna clones with genbank accession numbers and and the lack of complementation indicates that these clones are not full length . complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype the wall phenotype of the t dna mutants indicated that _PROTEIN_ is involved in xga biosynthesis . given that glycosyltransferase family is known to contain inverting glycosyltransferases the indication was that _PROTEIN_ would most likely be a xga xylosyltransferase . to investigate this possibility we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ myc his constructs in n. benthamiana leaves by agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ . the transient _PROTEIN_ leads to accumulation of substantial amounts of heterologous protein as shown by immunoblotting using anti his tag antibodies . microsomes were prepared from leaves d after infiltration and used for the glycosyltransferase assays . we tested activity using different ndp sugars as donor substrates and heat treated microsomes prepared from noninfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves as acceptors . microsomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed highly increased activity transferring xyl from udp xyl to polymeric products precipitated in ethanol compared with control microsomes whereas no significant change in activity was observed with udp glc udp gal or udp glcnac . with udp glca we observed a small increase in activity compared with the control . however the background activity from endogenous glycosyltransferases was very high with udp glca and this makes it difficult to conclude whether there is any increased incorporation of glca in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the same is true to some extent with udp gal . thus _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was actively _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana and showed xylosyltransferase activity transferring xylose onto endogenous oligosaccharides present in n. benthamiana microsomes . to investigate the nature of the products formed we treated the products obtained with udp xyl with xga hydrolase . as shown in figure the majority of the ethanol insoluble products that were synthesized using microsomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were released to an ethanol soluble supernatant after treatment with xga hydrolase . this indicates that the products synthesized by _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ xga . products synthesized by control microsomes also released some radioactivity into an ethanol soluble supernatant . this may be due to endogenous xga xylosyltransferase activity and to a minor extent may also be due to release of unrelated materials coprecipitated with xga but released together with xga after hydrolase treatment . under the same assay condition we also investigated whether pure oligogalacturonides with degree of polymerization of to could act as acceptors . microsomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred xyl from udp xyl to these acceptors and synthesized products precipitated in ethanol to a much higher extent than the control . analysis of the data by two way _PROTEIN_ shows a significant effect of adding oligogalacturonides and of _PROTEIN_ versus control . there was no significant effect of adding oligogalacturonides to the control reactions . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana also showed xylosyltransferase activity onto exogenous oligogalacturonide acceptors . an in frame fusion of _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was generated and transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves via agrobacterium infiltration . leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated the _METHOD_ signal in small moving oval dots while _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ without fusion accumulated uniformly in _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was coexpressed with known marker proteins . figures and show confocal images of a leaf coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively and figure shows the superimposition . it is noteworthy that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ hdel showed distinct distribution patterns the former showing an interspersed dot distribution and the latter showing a uniform distribution along the cell periphery with spiderweb like meshwork which is characteristic of _LOCATION_ . figures and show confocal images of a leaf coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ respectively and figure shows the superimposition of the two signals showing near perfect colocalization . the signals from the two proteins moved together providing further evidence that the proteins were colocalized . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes in the _LOCATION_ apparatus in n. benthamiana .

syngenta . for _PROTEIN_ the t dna insert was reported to be located in the last exon of _PROTEIN_ bp upstream from the stop codon according to the signal t dna _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis gene mapping tool . however when potential t dna mutant plants were screened by pcr using primers suggested by the salk institute _PROTEIN_ an unexpected large insert product was obtained using the forward gene specific primer for _PROTEIN_ in combination with the t dna insert specific primer _PROTEIN_ . this indicated that the true location of t dna insertion was in _PROTEIN_ much further downstream in the _PROTEIN_ gene than initially identified . this hypothesis was verified by sequencing of the pcr product generated by the forward primer and _PROTEIN_ using sequencing primer cattaccattcagtgatgtgc .

aspergillus niger and purified as described . pectin enriched fraction and residue from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ was subjected to digestion for h at with of xga hydrolase in mm naoac ph and the degradation products were analyzed by hpaec _PROTEIN_ and maldi tof _METHOD_ as previously described . leaf material and siliques from week old _PROTEIN_ and qrt plants were placed in fixative and placed under vacuum for min . the plant material was then left in fixative overnight at and washed twice in m phosphate buffer ph for min each time at . samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series

white resin and polymerized at for h. transverse sections of leaf and silique material for both _PROTEIN_ and qrt were cut at a _PROTEIN_ of with glass knives on a microtome and placed on diagnostic microscope slides _LOCATION_ that were coated in vectorbond reagent . resin embedded sections of siliques and leaves and d old root tips from _PROTEIN_ and qrt plants for surface labeling were blocked for h in milk powder in _PROTEIN_ and then incubated with fold dilutions of epitope specific for xga . in addition leaf resin embedded sections were incubated with fold dilution of antibody for partially methylesterified hg . after washing the sections the surface labeled roots were incubated with fold dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated secondary antibody and leaf sections were counterstained for min with calcofluor white fluorochrome _METHOD_ to detect the presence of cellulose . after washing with _PROTEIN_ the sections were mounted in a glycerol/pbs based antifade solution and observed on an _METHOD_ microscope . all constructs were generated on the basis of the _PROTEIN_ cdna clone _PROTEIN_ and by the use of phusion polymerase . the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified using forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer gacatgcatgcctatgtaccaagcctaagattaag . alternatively _GENE_ has been annotated to encode a soluble protein that is amino acids shorter than the n terminus compared with the above annotation . this version of the gene was amplified using forward primer _PROTEIN_ together with the same reverse primer as above . the pcr products were cloned as a saci/sphi fragment under control of the camv promoter and terminator in resulting in and respectively . a fusion protein was generated by adding a tag to the c terminal end of the

acetosyringone and allowed to stand at room temperature for to h. leaves of the wild type n. benthamiana were infiltrated with the bacterial cell suspensions using ml syringes . observations of sections of leaves were performed to h after infiltration . the confocal laser scanning microscope _METHOD_ was used to sequentially monitor _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals . the excitation and detection wavelengths for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were as follows and nm for excitation and to nm and to nm for detection respectively . leaves from week old wild type n. benthamiana were used for agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ of two versions of _PROTEIN_ constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to facilitate high _PROTEIN_ of recombinant protein strains carrying the _PROTEIN_ constructs were coinfiltrated with a strain carrying encoding protein a viral protein specifically inhibiting posttranscriptional gene silencing by the plant . agrobacterium strains carrying the plasmids were grown overnight in lb medium containing appropriate antibiotics _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the bacterial cells were suspended in a buffer as described above except that the concentration was higher . prior
