disruption of the _PROTEIN_ potassium transporter impairs root hair development and results in agravitropic root growth . in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the root hair length and density were reduced relative to the wassilewskija ecotype background from which the mutant was isolated . in addition the primary root growth was agravitropic . these morphological defects can be restored by exogenous application of auxin demonstrating a link between _PROTEIN_ activity and auxin transport . these experimental results raised the question of whether auxin transport is defective in _PROTEIN_ roots resulting in suboptimal auxin levels at the epidermal tissues spanning the root elongation and differentiation zone . to experimentally address this question we observed the accumulation of auxin in _PROTEIN_ plants by monitoring at cellular resolution the synthetic reporter gus . the seedlings were grown under the effect of the synthetic auxin naa . naa is capable of entering cells by diffusion but requires the active auxin efflux mechanism to be translocated . in the absence of naa the auxin response was restricted to the quiescent centre and to the initials or mature columella cells of the root tip whereas in _PROTEIN_ roots additional sites of auxin response were detected in protoxylem cell files . exogenous application of auxin for certain time points or under concentrations ranging from to nm revealed a completely different pattern of auxin distribution between the _PROTEIN_ and roots . apart from the quiescent centre and columella initials or mature columella cells roots showed enhanced auxin accumulation in cortical epidermal and _PROTEIN_ root cap cells at the meristematic region . however at the central cylinder _PROTEIN_ was observed in a narrow column of stellar cells . by contrast at the root tip of _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ was marginally detected at the cortical epidermal and _PROTEIN_ root cap cells only under the application of nm naa . likewise in the distal elongation zone the auxin response gradually expanded from the central cylinder to the root peripheral cell files as the duration of auxin application or the concentration of auxin increased . together these data demonstrate that in roots the pattern of auxin response as recorded by gus _PROTEIN_ coincides with the reported basipetal route of auxin whereas in _PROTEIN_ roots this pattern is distorted . furthermore the increased _PROTEIN_ of in the stele of the background reveals that auxin is acropetally directed to _PROTEIN_ root tips without being redistributed further . the malfunction of the basipetal auxin transport route in _PROTEIN_ roots leads to auxin imbalance which may perturb developmental processes such as the root response to gravity and root hair development . given the key role of directional auxin flow in plant developmental processes we performed endogenous iaa measurements to verify experimentally that auxin homeostasis is perturbed in the _PROTEIN_ root apex . in root tips the basipetal iaa concentration gradient is established just before the iaa pulse reaches the tip accompanied by a significant increase in iaa concentration in the first millimetre of the root tip . hence the levels of free iaa were measured and d after germination in sections of and _PROTEIN_ root tips . iaa levels were slightly higher in the first millimetre and marginally lower above the third millimetre of _PROTEIN_ root tips relative to the tips . within the central region of the root tips extending between the first and the third millimeter the content of auxin in _PROTEIN_ tips was similar to that of the . however the content of auxin was increased in _PROTEIN_ root tips . auxin concentration over the entire root tip of _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly higher than that of the plants . elevated auxin accumulation provides evidence to support the acropetal direction of auxin to _PROTEIN_ root tips as revealed previously by _PROTEIN_ in the stele of the _PROTEIN_ background but the active auxin efflux system mediating basipetal auxin distribution displays abnormal function creating auxin imbalance . as the auxin accumulation pattern and iaa quantitative analysis revealed auxin imbalance in the _PROTEIN_ root apex it is important to delineate its functional role in hormone transport . to track _PROTEIN_ localization the _METHOD_ reporter gene was fused at the of the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment including the promoter sequence . confocal microscopy live cell imaging revealed the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ at the cells of the epidermis cortex and endodermis in the meristematic zone . in the stele of the root elongation zone _PROTEIN_ was with the _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ on the basal cell side consistent with the role of _PROTEIN_ in auxin transport . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is localized in both the central cylinder at the elongation zone and in the peripheral root layers including the epidermis and cortex at the meristematic zone suggests that it could participate in both acropetal and basipetal auxin transport . consequently in _PROTEIN_ roots auxin imbalance is associated with developmental defects proximal and distal to the root apex . the proximal defect is the agravitropic root behaviour that most likely originates from the improper transport of auxin to the quiescent centre and columella region and/or from the hormonal gradient formed between the stele and the quiescent centre and columella region . the root hair phenotype is the distal defect attributed to the distorted basipetal auxin transport . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ is predominantly localized to internal compartments of the root epidermis . apart from the evident internal localization the dye that labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ is also partially localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . on brefeldin a application is internalized becoming a tool for the analysis of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking . this treatment indicated that _PROTEIN_ was not completely with . _PROTEIN_ localization at intracellular _LOCATION_ structures is reminiscent of the route of auxin translocation within the cell from the cytoplasm to the _LOCATION_ potentially through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . intracellular auxin transport has already been reported for the _PROTEIN_ subclass formed by the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family that is evolutionarily older than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ subclass . _PROTEIN_ auxin uptake into the _LOCATION_ lumen might have a relevant role in reducing auxin availability for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ auxin exporters and increasing the amount of auxin in the _LOCATION_ pool where enzymes of auxin metabolism are compartmentalized . as _PROTEIN_ plants showed an impaired auxin homeostasis pattern we hypothesized that the subcellular topology of the _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carriers might be modified . to test this hypothesis we determined the localization of the _PROTEIN_ auxin carriers . immunolocalization revealed that only _PROTEIN_ was ectopically _PROTEIN_ in specific cell types of the _PROTEIN_ meristematic zone . in the roots _PROTEIN_ is predominantly localized with a basal _PROTEIN_ to the bottom side of the stele and endodermis cells . furthermore _PROTEIN_ is detected at the quiescent centre and the cortex . at the meristematic zone surrounding the root initial cells the _PROTEIN_ localization signal fades out being restricted at the initials of the epidermis and _PROTEIN_ root cap whereas it is marginally identified at the two epidermal cells above the quiescent centre . in contrast with roots in _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ is detected at the epidermal cells of the entire meristematic zone and at the transition zone a border between the root meristem and elongation zone . _PROTEIN_ is localized on the apical side of the epidermal cells at the _PROTEIN_ position . the ectopic localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ is restored in _PROTEIN_ plants functionally complemented by the insertion of the _PROTEIN_ genomic locus generating normally elongated root hairs and having primary roots responding to gravity . together these results indicate that in _PROTEIN_ root tips the ectopic _PROTEIN_ arrangement of _PROTEIN_ results from auxin imbalance and hence is most likely a response to attenuate the defect in basipetal hormonal transport . auxin imbalance in _PROTEIN_ root tips caused developmental defects including agravitropic root growth and root hair phenotype and ectopic _PROTEIN_ mislocalization at the meristematic region . this raised the question of whether it also occurs in other auxin mutants . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes for an auxin efflux carrier that is predominantly found with apical _PROTEIN_ in the root epidermis and _PROTEIN_ root cap and basal _PROTEIN_ in the cortex . _PROTEIN_ is a major component for basipetal auxin transport being involved in root gravitropism . in addition to the agravitropic root growth phenotype _PROTEIN_ mutants also have a root hair phenotype with reduced root hair length and density . immunolocalization experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ is localized on the apical side of _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells at the meristematic zone . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ ectopic localization in _PROTEIN_ mutants is consistent with previous observations supporting the hypothesis of functional synergistic interactions within the _PROTEIN_ members for compensation of the redundant auxin distribution network . the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ was also investigated in the root tips of _PROTEIN_ auxin signalling and _PROTEIN_ auxin transport mutants . not only were the root hair length and density problematic in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds but also the growth of the primary root was agravitropic . _PROTEIN_ was ectopically localized on the apical side of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells at the meristematic zone as for the other mutant backgrounds . taken together the data demonstrate that auxin mutants with ectopic _PROTEIN_ localization at the meristematic zone have developmental defects including root gravitropism and root hair development . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ ectopic mislocalization is associated directly with the root developmental defects in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ gene was introduced in plants _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic overexpressor lines revealed that the auxin efflux carrier was ectopically localized at the apical side of epidermal cells at the meristematic region . furthermore _PROTEIN_ overexpressors showed pronounced defects in root gravitropism as reported previously by et al . but also impaired root hair development . these results are consistent with the data of mutants indicating that in _PROTEIN_ overexpressor lines the topology of the _PROTEIN_ protein at the apical side of epidermal cells at the meristematic region is associated with root agravitropism and the root hair phenotype . the fungal hypaphorine the betaine of tryptophan is an indole alkaloid that belongs in a class of iaa antagonists . hypaphorine is a signalling molecule released by the fungus during pisolithus tinctorius/eucalyptus globulus symbiotic association . hypaphorine shares structural similarities with iaa and the auxin precursor tryptophan . although auxin results in the inhibition of primary root elongation the application of hypaphorine counteracts the inhibitory effect of auxin restoring the primary root growth and hence acting as a natural auxin inhibitor . the application of hypaphorine on seedlings led to apical _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ on root epidermal cells at the meristematic zone . likewise hypaphorine had a dramatic effect on root hair morphogenesis whereas no effect was recorded in _METHOD_ of agravitropic root growth . interestingly the root hair length and density were strongly inhibited as the concentration shifted from to . the increased concentration of hypaphorine also had a slight effect on agravitropic root growth relative to a concentration of . this agravitropic root growth phenotype induced by hypaphorine when applied at relatively high concentration could be attributed to the inability of the compound to be transported within the root tissues . therefore the effect is strictly restricted during the uptake on the epidermal and cortical peripheral root cell layers inhibiting basipetal auxin transport . thus perturbation of auxin homeostastis results in ectopic _PROTEIN_ localization on the apical side of the epidermal cells at the meristematic zone causing the defect of root hair development distal to the root apex . unlike the other arabidopsis mutants _PROTEIN_ has the most severe root hair phenotype . _PROTEIN_ is required for the selection of the bulging site to initiate root hair elongation on the trichoblast and therefore _PROTEIN_ is almost hairless . _PROTEIN_ is an important downstream regulator of the _PROTEIN_ pathway and auxin or ethylene can restore the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype . hence hormones positively regulate root hair development independently of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly immunolocalization experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ is normally localized on the cells of the _PROTEIN_ root tips . furthermore the gravity response of _PROTEIN_ roots is not disturbed being similar to that of roots . these results are in agreement with previous genetic and physiological studies reported by cho cosgrove indicating that there are two independent pathways for root hair initiation . the first pathway is dependent on the external environmental stimuli that result in alterations in hormonal homeostasis in the arabidopsis root apex . the second pathway includes _PROTEIN_ as a downstream component of the intrinsic developmental _PROTEIN_ pathway that is involved in the initiation of root hair development . consequently _PROTEIN_ belongs to the developmental pathway that is independent of the environmental/hormonal pathway . the results indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not ectopically mislocalized in _PROTEIN_ root tips and _PROTEIN_ roots show no agravitropic growth support this model suggesting that the environmental/hormonal signalling pathway converges with the developmental intrinsic pathway downstream of _PROTEIN_ . the position of _PROTEIN_ in this developmental cascade explains why only the root hair morphogenesis is perturbed in _PROTEIN_ roots but not agravitropic root growth .
