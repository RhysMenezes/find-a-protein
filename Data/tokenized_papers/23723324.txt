_METHOD_ chlorophyll catabolites were described as products of chlorophyll breakdown in arabidopsis thaliana . nccs are formyloxobilin type catabolites derived from chlorophyll by oxygenolytic opening of the chlorin macrocycle . these linear tetrapyrroles are generated from their _METHOD_ chlorophyll catabolite precursors by a nonenzymatic isomerization inside the _LOCATION_ of senescing cells . here we identified a group of distinct dioxobilin type chlorophyll catabolites as the major breakdown products in wild type arabidopsis representing more than of the chlorophyll of green leaves . the molecular constitution of the most abundant _METHOD_ dcc at ndcc was determined . we further identified cytochrome monooxygenase _PROTEIN_ as being responsible for ndcc accumulation in wild type arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants that are deficient in _PROTEIN_ function were devoid of ndccs but accumulated proportionally higher amounts of nccs . _PROTEIN_ localized outside the chloroplasts implying that fccs occurring in the _LOCATION_ might be its natural substrate . using recombinant _PROTEIN_ we confirm fcc specificity and show that _METHOD_ dccs are the products of the _PROTEIN_ reaction . _METHOD_ dccs formed by this enzyme isomerize to the respective ndccs in weakly acidic medium as found in _LOCATION_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the formation of dioxobilin type catabolites of chlorophyll in arabidopsis .
nccs have been identified as breakdown products of chlorophyll that accumulate during leaf senescence in many _METHOD_ including annual species and deciduous trees . however in some cases ndccs were reported to represent products of chlorophyll breakdown . to explore the possibility that besides nccs ndccs might also accumulate in the model plant arabidopsis we used hplc to reanalyze extracts of senescent leaves . leaf senescence was induced by dark treatment of detached leaves a procedure that is well known to efficiently induce chlorophyll breakdown . like other nccs at nccs exhibit a characteristic absorption maximum at around nm and equally strong absorption at nm . when comparing arabidopsis leaf extracts with detection at these two wavelengths several fractions were identified that strongly absorbed at nm but only weekly at nm . at least five of these fractions showed absorption spectra that were described for the norway maple ndcc indicating that they could represent related ndccs in arabidopsis . the most _PROTEIN_ major ndcc from arabidopsis was thoroughly analyzed by spectroscopy methods . at ndcc was revealed to represent a _METHOD_ dioxobilane type catabolite as follows . the molecular formula of at ndcc was determined as by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by which the quasimolecular ion was observed at a _METHOD_ to charge ratio . in the nmr spectra of at ndcc signals of all exchange inert _PROTEIN_ bound hydrogen _METHOD_ were observed . a singlet near ppm was absent which is a characteristic of the formyl hydrogen atom of nccs . instead a multiplet at ppm and a double doublet at ppm indicated hydrogen _METHOD_ at positions and respectively as is typical for ndccs . both ndcc and ncc abundances increased during the course of leaf senescence however the amounts of ndccs exceeded nccs by a _PROTEIN_ of about . in addition after d of dark induced senescence ndccs accounted for more than of the degraded chlorophyll demonstrating them to represent the by far most abundant type of chlorophyll catabolite in arabidopsis . the identification of ndccs as the major chlorophyll catabolites in arabidopsis called for elucidating the mechanism of their formation . two possible pathways were addressed formation from a chlorin type substrate such as chlorophyll or pheophorbide whose macrocycle could be opened by a heme oxygenase like reaction _PROTEIN_ or oxidative deformylation of the formyl group present in fccs and nccs . we excluded the first possibility because _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant retains large quantities of chlorophyll during leaf senescence . if ndcc formation would involve an activity for chlorin _PROTEIN_ cleavage that is distinct from _PROTEIN_ degreening should not be blocked in _PROTEIN_ . alternatively _PROTEIN_ itself could exhibit a heme oxygenase like activity however in vitro activity studies clearly demonstrated a specificity of _PROTEIN_ toward fcc formation . to identify likely candidates for deformylation we tested whether cytochrome monooxygenases could be involved . have been shown to catalyze different types of reactions including deformylation of c bound formyl groups . we exploited the ability of _PROTEIN_ to effectively inhibit when senescence was induced in detached leaves in an atmosphere composed of a ratio of _PROTEIN_ and ambient air the ndcc to ncc ratio was shifted to higher amounts of nccs when compared with incubation at ambient air . this supported the idea that could catalyze ndcc formation . based on the _PROTEIN_ that several genes encoding chlorophyll catabolic enzymes are highly _PROTEIN_ in senescent rosette leaves cauline leaves and _PROTEIN_ and/or sepals we reasoned that the genes for involved in ndcc formation could be similarly induced . using the genes search tool of the genevestigator platform and the above mentioned tissues as targets we found two genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ among the first hundred genes that are similarly _PROTEIN_ . as expected this gene list also contained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nonyellow _PROTEIN_ and pheophytinase four senescence regulated chlorophyll catabolic genes . to analyze the potential role of the two candidate genes we characterized chlorophyll breakdown in t dna insertion mutants that fail to _PROTEIN_ the respective full length gene transcripts . these lines did not show any obvious visible phenotype during normal development and high light treatment and upon senescence induction chlorophyll was degraded like in the wild type . during senescence _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulated wild type patterns of catabolites and were not considered further . by contrast both investigated _PROTEIN_ mutants did not accumulate ndccs but had more than fold increased levels of nccs . in _PROTEIN_ nccs accumulated up to per g fresh weight which corresponded to more than of degraded chlorophyll . uv/vis and _METHOD_ analysis of the nccs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed them to be identical to the nccs found in the columbia wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is in the landsberg _LOCATION_ background and ler has been shown to be a natural _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ is responsible for demethylation of the _PROTEIN_ group of fccs . because of this the ndcc/ncc catabolite patterns differed between col and ler . in addition desmethyl fccs that accumulate in _PROTEIN_ mutants were shown to isomerize more slowly to the corresponding nccs . to confirm that the catabolite pattern seen in _PROTEIN_ is due to the absence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we crossed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in this line chlorophyll catabolite patterns were identical to _PROTEIN_ . the ndcc deficiency of _PROTEIN_ mutants indicated that _PROTEIN_ may catalyze their formation in wild type plants . to analyze this hypothesis we tested in vitro activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in insect cells . fccs were considered as likely substrates for _PROTEIN_ because when _PROTEIN_ as a fusion with green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts _PROTEIN_ localized outside chloroplasts and as shown for most extraplastidial enzymes most likely to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . activity requires a reductase therefore _PROTEIN_ thaliana _PROTEIN_ one of the two arabidopsis reductases was _PROTEIN_ in cells as well . using epi pfcc as substrate four fractions of _METHOD_ compounds were obtained in a time dependent manner in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . they exhibited identical spectra with a prominent absorption maximum at around nm . _METHOD_ analysis _METHOD_ demonstrated these compounds to be isomers of a constitutionally uniform _METHOD_ dioxobilin type chlorophyll catabolite _PROTEIN_ which we termed epi pfdccs because they derived from epi pfcc . they likely differ in the configuration at and however this was not further investigated . to test the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ assays were performed also with _PROTEIN_ fcc and the corresponding ncc _PROTEIN_ ncc . only the fcc but not the isomeric ncc was converted by _PROTEIN_ supporting the specificity of _PROTEIN_ for fccs . under acidic conditions the epi pfdccs isomerized into ndccs indicating that in vivo formation of ndccs from corresponding _PROTEIN_ might occur after their import into the _LOCATION_ . during our analysis of _PROTEIN_ substrate specificity in vitro it turned out that the enzyme did not convert demethylated epi pfcc to the respective _PROTEIN_ . this indicated that although both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in the _LOCATION_ and therefore could compete for the same substrate in vivo deformylation by _PROTEIN_ might precede catabolite demethylation by _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this in more detail we used a line _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the chloroplast _LOCATION_ . in this line the ndcc to ncc ratio was significantly shifted toward more nccs compared with col . this supports the idea that in col wild type plants _PROTEIN_ precedes _PROTEIN_ action to a large extent leading to the formation of ndccs while only a small fraction of catabolites may be first demethylated thus ending in the formation of nccs . further evidence for this was obtained by _PROTEIN_ complementation tests in _PROTEIN_ mutants . when analyzing the relative amounts of ndccs and nccs as a measure of complementation absence of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant resulted in more efficient complementation compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
