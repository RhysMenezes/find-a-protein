plant microtubules play essential roles in cell division anisotropic cell expansion and overall organ morphology . microtubule associated proteins bind to mts and regulate their dynamics stability and organization . identifying the full set of maps in plants would greatly enhance our understanding of how diverse mt arrays are formed and function however few proteomics studies have characterized plant maps . using liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we identified hundreds of proteins from map enriched preparations derived from cell suspension cultures of arabidopsis . previously reported maps mt regulators kinesins dynamins _LOCATION_ resident enzymes and proteins implicated in replication transcription and translation were highly enriched . dozens of proteins of unknown function were identified among which were tagged with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and examined for their ability to colocalize with mts when transiently _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . six proteins did indeed colocalize with cortical mts in planta . we further characterized one of these maps designated as _PROTEIN_ proline rich _PROTEIN_ which belongs to a seven member family in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated interphase and mitotic mt arrays in transgenic arabidopsis plants . a highly basic conserved region was responsible for the in vivo mt association . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stabilized mts caused right handed helical growth in rapidly elongating tissues promoted the formation of transverse mt arrays and resulted in the outgrowth of epidermal cells in light grown hypocotyls . our high quality proteome database of arabidopsis map enriched preparations is a useful resource for identifying novel mt regulators and evaluating potential mt associations of proteins known to have other cellular functions .
we modified an existing map preparation protocol which was developed for tobacco by cell suspension cultures to purify map enriched protein fractions from arabidopsis cell suspension cultures . protoplasts were prepared from cultured arabidopsis cells and the _LOCATION_ were removed by percoll density gradient centrifugation . soluble proteins extracted from the evacuolated miniprotoplasts were processed with two cycles of mt polymerization/depolymerization to enrich for proteins that have a high affinity for mt polymers . two concentrations of nacl were used in the mt depolymerization buffers . purified map containing preparations were then separated by anion exchange column chromatography and proteins in major elution fractions were analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . highly acidic proteins which were eluted from the column by high salt concentrations were mostly composed of tubulins and were not analyzed further . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ brilliant blue protein staining revealed that the two map enriched preparations contained tubulins as major proteins and had similar but distinct protein compositions . as a reference we also subjected a crude protein preparation from the arabidopsis miniprotoplasts to anion exchange column chromatography and analyzed the eluted proteins by lc _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis revealed that the protein composition of the reference preparation was distinct from that of the map enriched preparations . individual fractions or combined samples of three consecutive fractions which were eluted from the anion exchange column were analyzed by lc _METHOD_ and queried against the arabidopsis information resource release protein data set . as a rough estimate of the relative protein abundance we used the exponentially modified protein abundance index which is based on the number of observed peptides divided by the number of theoretically observable peptides per protein . the highest empai scores of a given protein among all fractions of the two map enriched preparations and the reference preparation were obtained and the identified proteins are listed in _PROTEIN_ order of their scores . for the list of map candidates the empai scores of the reference preparation are also given . the map enriched preparations and the reference preparation showed highly different protein compositions . the majority of proteins identified in the map enriched preparations had very low empai scores or were not identified in the reference preparation . tubulins were well represented on this list even though anion exchange column purified fractions containing large amounts of tubulins were excluded from the _METHOD_ analysis . this map candidate list contained previously reported maps and mt regulators including _PROTEIN_ clip associated protein end family proteins _PROTEIN_ family proteins family proteins wave family proteins movement protein auxin _PROTEIN_ in root runkel _PROTEIN_ microtubule _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tubulin _PROTEIN_ complex proteins . these maps were absent or had very low empai scores in the crude preparation indicating that they were significantly enriched by our map purification procedures . some mt regulators such as _PROTEIN_ family proteins and putative arabidopsis maps which had been shown to associate with mts in in vivo or in vitro experiments were absent or were not identified with confidence in our map preparations . these proteins may have weak or negligible mt binding activities under our map enrichment conditions . alternatively these proteins might have been absent in our crude cytoplasmic preparation from suspension cultured cells . in the map preparations we identified proteins belonging to kinesin subfamilies and and to the plant specific kinesin subfamily . kinesins belonging to subfamily are proposed to recruit the arabidopsis fused kinase two in one to the phragmoplast midzone . enrichment of tio in map preparation despite the absence of subfamily kinesins implies that tio might possess an intrinsic affinity for mts . the empai scores of known maps are shown . asterisks indicate the proteins reported in the map preparation by citation . the empai scores of kinesins are shown . asterisks indicate the proteins reported in the map preparation by citation . to classify other identified proteins on a functional basis we characterized the comprehensive data set according to the gene ontology annotations followed by additional manual data mining of recently published work . proteins with empai scores higher than in either map preparation or were subjected to the following analysis . tubulins maps mt regulators and kinesins constituted of the whole proteins . in the map enriched proteome database were annotated as being involved in rna transcription splicing and metabolism as having roles in dna replication repair and structure as being associated with the nucleolus which includes rna processing functions and as being involved in translation . proteins belonging to these functional categories have been identified in animal map preparations and in arabidopsis tubulin binding protein and map preparations . _LOCATION_ and nucleolus localized ribonucleoproteins have been reported to regulate the organization of mitotic spindles . the putative tobacco subunit of the transcription and mrna export _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ whose arabidopsis ortholog was highly enriched in our map preparations was shown to directly bind mts in vitro and to decorate cortical mts in tobacco by cells . eukaryotic elongation _PROTEIN_ ef and ef exhibit the biochemical properties of maps and are enriched in our map preparations . recent studies suggest that a large fraction of mrnas are localized to subcellular compartments in _PROTEIN_ asymmetric cells by _METHOD_ that involve the transport of rna granules by molecular motors along the mt and actin _LOCATION_ and result in spatially and temporally regulated translation . transcripts associated with cell division spindle formation and chromosome function copurify with mitotic mts in xenopus laevis egg extracts implicating these proteins in spindle localized translation . mts might also localize and spatially regulate translation in plant cells however this possibility remains to be explored . dynamins are large _PROTEIN_ belonging to a protein superfamily that in arabidopsis includes two classical dynamins and five phragmoplastin like proteins . dynamin was previously characterized as a _PROTEIN_ that can associate with mts in vitro and an arabidopsis phragmoplastin like protein was associated with mts when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells . indeed our map preparation contained seven arabidopsis dynamins of the dynamin and phragmoplastin subclasses with high empai scores . these arabidopsis dynamins appear to function in cell plate formation during cytokinesis but their interactions with phragmoplast mts remain to be fully characterized . furthermore we identified proteins associated with organelles endomembranes and vesicle trafficking . interestingly of the identified enzymes are involved in the metabolism of _LOCATION_ . many of these peroxisomal proteins were recovered in map preparation which presumably retained proteins with lower affinities for mts than those purified in preparation . these peroxisomal proteins might possess mt binding activities in addition to their well characterized enzymatic activities as demonstrated for the arabidopsis peroxisomal multifunctional protein . alternatively the outer _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ might bind to mts resulting in partial cosedimentation of some _LOCATION_ with mts during purification . although actin filaments support the long distance transport of _LOCATION_ in plant cells these motile organelles were frequently observed to pause at cortical mts . in humans the evolutionarily conserved is not only a central component of the peroxisomal protein translocation machinery but is also required for _LOCATION_ motility serving as a _LOCATION_ anchor for mts . the map enriched preparations contained several dozen proteins with functions that had not been characterized and could not be deduced from their primary structures . we selected such proteins that appeared to be highly enriched in the map preparations and transiently _PROTEIN_ them as n or c terminal fusions to _METHOD_ by particle bombardment in the pavement cells of arabidopsis leaves . of the map candidates six labeled cortical filamentous structures which appeared to be cortical mt arrays . the _GENE_ encoded protein contained a actinin domain and a _PROTEIN_ domain of unknown functions whereas the proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ are respectively annotated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which contain iq calmodulin binding regions . interestingly two other iqd proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also highly enriched in our map preparations and these four iqd proteins form a distinct subgroup among the iqd proteins in arabidopsis . the protein encoded by _GENE_ has an actinin binding domain with a coiled coil structure which is found for example in _METHOD_ of fission yeast where it is required for anchoring the minus end of spindle mts to the spindle pole body . the _GENE_ gene encodes a basic pro rich protein _PROTEIN_ but has no known domains . the protein encoded by _GENE_ possesses no particular features in _METHOD_ of amino acid composition or familiar domains . the patterns of the _METHOD_ labeled filaments varied somewhat possibly reflecting varying _PROTEIN_ levels of the _METHOD_ fusions ranging from dotted particles along the filaments to bright probably bundled filaments _PROTEIN_ . the remaining six proteins tested were broadly cytoplasmic or localized in patterns that did not resemble mts . candidate map proteins were fused to _METHOD_ at their n or c terminus and _PROTEIN_ transiently in onion epidermal cells . the proteins are listed according to the order of the empai scores with the highest scores in either preparation or at the top . we further characterized the cellular localization of these six putative mt binding proteins by transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions of these proteins in onion epidermal cells together with the red _METHOD_ mt marker _METHOD_ . merged images of the _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ protein signals indicated that these six proteins localized to cortical mts . when the bombarded onion cells were treated with oryzalin an mt depolymerizing drug for min the cortical mts were no longer labeled with the _METHOD_ fusions of these proteins . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ efficient depolymerization of mts required higher concentrations of oryzalin and even under such harsh drug treatment some mt remnants persisted indicating that transient overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stabilizes mts . taken together these results demonstrate that the six arabidopsis proteins enriched in the map preparations are previously uncharacterized maps . _PROTEIN_ a kd protein rich in pro and basic amino acids belongs to a protein family that has seven members in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a subclade that in addition to the basic region contains three conserved motifs . the basic regions of _PROTEIN_ contain no or few acidic amino acids and have average pi values higher than . a related arabidopsis protein in the _PROTEIN_ clade _PROTEIN_ is truncated at the c terminal region is less basic than the other _PROTEIN_ members and lacks one of the three motifs . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not identified with confidence in the map preparations peptide fragments of _PROTEIN_ are present in the map preparations . indeed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells the fusion protein labeled cortical mt like structures . when the internal basic region of _PROTEIN_ was deleted and _PROTEIN_ transiently as a _METHOD_ fusion in onion epidermal cells together with _METHOD_ the truncated protein was mostly localized to the cytoplasm . in contrast the isolated basic region fused to _METHOD_ showed robust localization on cortical mts . thus the highly basic regions of _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ responsible for mt binding activity . in vitro mt binding assays will demonstrate whether _PROTEIN_ family proteins directly bind mts . next we stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of _PROTEIN_ regulatory elements in arabidopsis plants . cortical mt arrays were decorated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the epidermal cells of leaves hypocotyls and roots . mitotic mt structures such as preprophase bands spindle mts and phragmoplasts were also labeled . _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at basal levels in many cell types with stronger _PROTEIN_ in meristematic regions and vasculature and during early trichome development . three transfer dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ yielded little or no _PROTEIN_ transcript . these mutant alleles were indistinguishable from the wild type in _METHOD_ of growth development and morphology possibly because of the functional redundancy of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constitutively overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter the transgenic arabidopsis seedlings displayed slight right handed helical twisting of the epidermal cell files in etiolated hypocotyls and petioles resulting in an anticlockwise arrangement of cotyledons and young leaves . when grown on hard agar plates that were placed vertically primary roots of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing seedlings grew toward the right side of the plates as viewed from the front . epidermal cells in the apical region of light grown hypocotyls often produced ectopic outgrowths that formed cone like protrusions . cortical mt arrays in leaf pavements cells that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were considerably ordered and aligned largely transverse to the long axis of the cells . in the upper region of the light grown hypocotyls of these plants epidermal cells exhibited highly ordered mt arrays that were remarkably transverse to the cell s long axis . epidermal protrusions were surrounded by concentric cortical mt arrays . quantification of mt distribution patterns in this cell type showed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled mts were widely distributed and did not align in particular patterns as reported previously whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled mts in two independent lines were aligned close to the transverse orientation . to examine mt stability we treated the transgenic arabidopsis seedlings with of an mt depolymerizing agent oryzalin for min . cortical mts in the epidermal cells of light grown seedlings that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were mostly depolymerized by the oryzalin treatment whereas mts labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were resistant to this treatment indicating that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stabilizes mts . the right handed helical growth and ectopic protrusions in hypocotyl epidermal cells have been observed in mutants in which cortical mts are proposed to be more stabilized than those of the wild type . in arabidopsis nima related mutants cortical mts are excessively stabilized and local outgrowth occurs in epidermal cells of the hypocotyls and petioles . right handed organ twisting has also been observed in mt stabilizing arabidopsis tubulin mutants and in transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing mt stabilizing maps . we suggest that abnormal cell expansion in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic arabidopsis plants is due to the excessive stabilization of cortical mts .
