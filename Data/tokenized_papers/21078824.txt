_PROTEIN_ are amino acid derived secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities dependent on chemical modifications of the side chain . five flavin monooxygenases _PROTEIN_ have recently been identified as aliphatic _PROTEIN_ side chain modification enzymes in arabidopsis thaliana that catalyse the generation of methylsulphinylalkyl _PROTEIN_ which can be hydrolysed to products with distinctive benefits for human health and plant defence . though the localization of most aliphatic _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic enzymes has been determined little is known about where the side chain modifications take place despite their importance . hence the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis was investigated by _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion genes controlled by _PROTEIN_ promoters . the cellular compartmentation of _PROTEIN_ was also detected by transiently _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in tobacco leaves . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ basically in vascular tissues especially in phloem cells like other _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic genes . they were also found in endodermis like cells in flower stalk and epidermal cells in leaf which is a location that has not been reported for other _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic genes . it is suggested that the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ determines the access of enzymes to their substrate and therefore affects the _PROTEIN_ profile . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein analysis identified _PROTEIN_ as a _LOCATION_ protein . together with the subcellular locations of the other biosynthetic enzymes an integrated map of the multicompartmentalized aliphatic _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic pathway is discussed .
to investigate the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants carrying the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ the fused _METHOD_ gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were generated . promoter activity was detected as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or as a gus signal in living plant material . in seedlings _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in vascular tissue throughout the radicle hypocotyl cotyledons and foliage leaves . in fully grown leaves _METHOD_ was found in the vascular tissue including the mid vein and some major side veins . a less intense signal was observed in epidermal cells . in flower stalks the _METHOD_ signal was found in part of the phloem and the xylem . _METHOD_ was observed at the junction between the flower bud and flower stalk but very little _METHOD_ was detected in _PROTEIN_ sepals stigma and anthers . dense _METHOD_ was detected in vascular tissue of silique walls and seed funicles which are the junctions between the silique septum and seed . because of the _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ signal in roots was ambiguous . however gus staining showed that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active in the junction between the _PROTEIN_ root and its primary root . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ by gus analysis was in full agreement with the results of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ detection . throughout the whole plant high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity was detected in almost all the nodes for example between the leaf and flower stalk flower and flower stalk or silique and flower stalk and also the seed funicles . in roots _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was restricted to the junction between the _PROTEIN_ root and its primary root . sections of fresh flower stalk tissue were examined by confocal microscopy . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed throughout most parts of the phloem which means that the _PROTEIN_ promoter might be active in all phloem cell types sieve elements companion cells and phloem parenchyma cells . in the xylem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the parenchyma cells . _METHOD_ was also observed in an endodermis like cell layer which is a single layer of cells between the outer cortex and the inner cylinder . within flower stalks between the endodermis like layer and the vascular bundles there are usually cells called s cells . this cell type appears very large in both cross sections and longitudinal sections . these cells have been suggested to be the predominant storage sites for _PROTEIN_ . in the present experiments no _METHOD_ was detected in these s cells which indicates that _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ in s cells . _PROTEIN_ was chosen as an example to identify the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ oxs . two constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ encoding the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the promoter and the _PROTEIN_ promoter respectively were transformed into tobacco leaf by the agrobacterium infiltration method . at the same time the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was subcloned and heterologously _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as described previously . in both the transgenic tobacco leaves and transgenic e. coli spheroplasts a protein of kda which is the predicted size of a fusion between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ was detected by western blot using anti _METHOD_ antibody . recombinant protein _PROTEIN_ in e. coli was detected to be active for s oxygenation . experiments proved that the _METHOD_ signal in the transgenic plants was from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and that _PROTEIN_ is still functional after fusion with _METHOD_ hence the _METHOD_ detected represented the localization of functional _PROTEIN_ . five days after infiltration _METHOD_ signals were detected in epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells transformed with the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed _METHOD_ signals located in the _LOCATION_ seen as a clear _METHOD_ network structure and those transformed with construct pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . comparing _PROTEIN_ controlled by the promoter with _PROTEIN_ controlled by the _PROTEIN_ promoter the latter should resemble native _PROTEIN_ protein . it is hypothesized that the _LOCATION_ located _METHOD_ signal in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic cells _METHOD_ from the newly synthesized protein being transported through the _LOCATION_ or it could simply be accumulated in the _LOCATION_ due to heavy overexpression . in order to confirm this hypothesis leaves transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with cycloheximide which is expected to inhibit de novo protein biosynthesis without affecting intercellular protein trafficking . at h after the treatment of the epidermal cells no longer showed _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . instead a more intensive signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ . this suggests that during the treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was relocated to the _LOCATION_ and therefore less or no _METHOD_ was left in the _LOCATION_ due to the inhibition of de novo protein synthesis . _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ became stronger by accumulation of the relocated protein . nine days after the infiltration _METHOD_ in leaves transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ instead of in the _LOCATION_ . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ may be stored in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ to be involved in biosynthesis or transportation of _PROTEIN_ . activity/localization analysis similar to that for _PROTEIN_ was performed for the _PROTEIN_ genes . comparable distribution patterns for these genes were found albeit with some small variations in the leaf and root . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues throughout the whole plant . _PROTEIN_ was only detectable in leaf and flower stalk but not in silique and root possibly due to its low _PROTEIN_ level . in flower stalks all _PROTEIN_ oxs showed an _PROTEIN_ pattern in the vascular bundles like that observed for _PROTEIN_ . no obvious spatial _PROTEIN_ difference among the _PROTEIN_ oxs was observed except for the level of gene _PROTEIN_ . most of the _PROTEIN_ variation was detected in leaves where _PROTEIN_ were all _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue but with different patterns .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia and tobacco were used throughout this study . plants were grown in a growth chamber at a photosynthetic flux of at and relative humidity with a h photoperiod . _PROTEIN_ promoters were amplified as following . a bp dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was pcr amplified from genomic dna with the primers ggcttaauggcgaagaaatggtcgttgc and ggtttaauttattttattaaatttctatgatatgtttgattttca . a kb dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was pcr amplified from genomic dna with the primers ggcttaaucaagggtaagggatgcttga and ggtttaauatatttgaactttatggtatggtgg . a kb dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was pcr amplified from genomic dna with the primers ggcttaautctcacgtcacgcctctaccctc and ggtttaauattttgtcaaatcttaataatagtag . a kb dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was pcr amplified from genomic dna with the primers ggcttaautccccctcataaatttcttcc and ggtttaauttttcaaagttttgaatg . a kb dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was pcr amplified from genomic dna with the primers ggcttaautgagcctcgtcttgctcata and ggtttaaucttttttgtgtgatgatgatgc . the _PROTEIN_ promoters were then individually ligated to the end of the fused _METHOD_ gus gene in the plant _PROTEIN_ vector pcambia nls _METHOD_ gus by the user method . pcambia nls _METHOD_ gus is generated from the original vector pcambia by adding the nls _LOCATION_ and coding sequence of the fusion gene _METHOD_ gus with user cloning sites for the promoters . in the resulting constructs the fused gene _METHOD_ gus is driven by the respective _PROTEIN_ promoters . to identify the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ two constructs were made . the first one is _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence without a stop codon was amplified from cdna with the gene specific primers ggcttaauatggcaccaactcaaaacacaatc and ggtttaautgattcgaggaaataagaag . total plant rna was isolated with trizol and the first strand cdna was synthesized using the cdna synthesis kit . the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was then cloned into the vector pcambia c _METHOD_ using the user method as previously described . the resulting construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can overexpress _PROTEIN_ tagged with a c terminal _METHOD_ . the second construct is pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . genomic dna of the _PROTEIN_ gene including the upstream sequence which is presumably the entire promoter and the untranslated region followed by the structural gene the _METHOD_ protein coding sequence and the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified . because genomic dna of _PROTEIN_ is too long it is divided into two pieces and amplified separately . the above four dna fragments were then fused and cloned to the targeting plant _PROTEIN_ vector pcambia u by the user fusion method . the resulting construct pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein with a c terminal _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ native promoter . the upstream sequence of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was amplified with the primers ggcttaau ggcgaagaaatggtcgttgcgct and acctcgtuattgaatggaccaggaactctg . the genomic structural gene of _PROTEIN_ was amplified with the primers aacgagguaatgttccattcaacttgaga and accattgatucgaggaaataagaaggatgagaact . the coding sequence of _METHOD_ was amplified with the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the untranslated region was amplified with the primers acaagtaaugatgatctgcgacaaatattgtccaa and ggtttaauatgaacataaataagagtatcaactttaagttactgga . to detect the fusion protein in transgenic plants with the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whole protein extracts from the two transgenic plants were subjected to western blot analysis . tobacco leaves were homogenized with extraction buffer comprising _PROTEIN_ mercaptoethanol mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and m _PROTEIN_ hcl ph followed by incubation at for min . the homogenate was centrifuged and the soluble fraction was concentrated . for western blot analysis the protein extracts were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ blotted onto a _LOCATION_ and detected with anti _METHOD_ antibody according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the coding sequence of the fusion gene _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was amplified from the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and then cloned into the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ vector pbad topo . the resulting construct and a negative control were transformed into the e. coli strain top . production of the fusion protein was performed according to the manufacturer 's recommendation it was induced with arabinose followed by growth at rpm for h. an e. coli spheroplast enzymatic assay was performed as previously described . protein western blot analysis was performed as described above . image acquisitions were conducted on a leica using either or dipping lenses . for _METHOD_ detection the nm laser was used for excitation and the photomultiplier was set to detect in the nm range . to detect _METHOD_ from the chloroplasts the nm laser was also used for excitation and detection was in the nm range . a uv laser was used to visualize supportive tissue and conductive tissue in the flower stalks detection was in the nm range . microscopy was carried out in xy mode with a line averaging of eight scans in order to lower the contribution of unspecific random noise seen as background . the pictures were acquired as sequential frame by frame scans meaning that the different laser channels were collected one by one where the frames alternated between nm excitation and nm excitation . laser power was minimized to lower the risk of photodamage and photobleaching to cells while still having a clear _METHOD_ signal . microscope data were processed using leica lite _METHOD_ and image j . the histochemical detection of gus _PROTEIN_ was performed essentially as described . plant materials were cut and incubated in substrate solution at for h followed by removal of chlorophyll by submerging the samples in ethanol . the samples were examined and photographed using a stereo microscope or a research microscope . gus stained flower stalk material was embedded in agarose as described . sections were made on an ultramicrotome and images were obtained using a research microscope .
