in arabidopsis thaliana a family of six genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes acyl coa binding proteins _PROTEIN_ . investigations on _PROTEIN_ reported here show its upregulation upon dark treatment and in senescing rosettes . transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed accelerated leaf senescence whereas an _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutant and _PROTEIN_ rna interference transgenic arabidopsis lines were delayed in dark induced leaf senescence . acyl coa and lipid profiling revealed that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to an increase in acyl coa and phosphatidylethanolamine levels whereas _PROTEIN_ downregulation reduced pe content . moreover significant losses in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol and gains in phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ lysophospholipids and oxylipin containing galactolipids were evident in week old dark treated and week old premature senescing _PROTEIN_ oes . such accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsides resulting from lipid peroxidation in _PROTEIN_ oes likely promoted leaf senescence . the n terminal signal sequence/transmembrane domain in _PROTEIN_ was shown to be essential in _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein targeting and in promoting senescence . observations that recombinant _PROTEIN_ binds pc pe and unsaturated acyl coas in vitro and that _PROTEIN_ overexpression enhances degradation of the autophagy _PROTEIN_ related protein _PROTEIN_ and disrupts autophagosome formation suggest a role for _PROTEIN_ as a phospholipid binding protein involved in the regulation of leaf senescence by modulating _LOCATION_ phospholipid metabolism and _PROTEIN_ stability in arabidopsis . accelerated senescence in _PROTEIN_ oes is dependent on salicylic acid but not jasmonic acid signaling .
on rna gel blot analysis _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ in week old rosettes stalks and roots and week old young seedlings with relatively lower abundance in flowers and siliques to d after fertilization . its _PROTEIN_ in to week old rosettes peaked at weeks and then _PROTEIN_ . subsequently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ again increased from week old fully expanded rosettes through early and mid senescence _METHOD_ . some mrnas encoding _PROTEIN_ are regulated by light _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in the light and was elevated following a dark period . to investigate the effect of continuous darkness and continuous light on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ grown rosettes were harvested every h under dd or ll . rna gel blot analysis confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in ll dampening off to a much reduced peak at h . by contrast plants transferred to dd displayed increased _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is downregulated in ll but upregulated in dd . its induced _PROTEIN_ during dd and senescence is consistent with microarray data on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results support a role for _PROTEIN_ in leaf senescence . to address the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on dark induced leaf senescence _PROTEIN_ overexpressor lines _PROTEIN_ were generated . three independent transgenic lines that accumulated _PROTEIN_ mrna were identified via rna gel blot analysis and their resultant stable transgenic plants were subsequently used . under normal growth conditions _PROTEIN_ week old independent _PROTEIN_ oes were similar to the wild type . when plants were transferred to dd all _PROTEIN_ oes showed enhanced sensitivity with leaf vitrification after d . following a d recovery under _PROTEIN_ differences in death rates between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ oes were significant . _LOCATION_ electrolyte leakage and _LOCATION_ lipid content two well established markers for assessment of _LOCATION_ integrity in senescent leaves were measured . a twofold increase in electrolyte leakage occurred only on day in dd treated wild type leaves . by contrast electrolyte leakage in _PROTEIN_ oes was significantly greater than the wild type and d following dd . the _LOCATION_ lipid content in rosettes d after dd treatment _PROTEIN_ significantly more in oe _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ and oe _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding senescence associated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ three widely used leaf senescence marker genes in arabidopsis was determined . the _PROTEIN_ of senescence associated _PROTEIN_ and four other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which are upregulated during age dependent or dark induced senescence was also tested . rt pcr analyses using total rna from week old wild type oe and oe showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were induced in all lines and d after dd treatment while _PROTEIN_ mrna was induced in d . whereas _PROTEIN_ was downregulated in the wild type after dd it was upregulated in _PROTEIN_ oe lines . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were more highly _PROTEIN_ on day than day in the wild type but were upregulated on both days in _PROTEIN_ oes . measured as a control the _PROTEIN_ mrna was dark induced on days and in the wild type and was constitutively _PROTEIN_ in the oe lines . elevation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas in _PROTEIN_ oes over the wild type likely caused accelerated dark induced senescence in the _PROTEIN_ oes . to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ during nutrient starvation week old _PROTEIN_ grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ oes on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium were transferred to either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ medium lacking nitrogen . after weeks of nitrogen starvation the cotyledons and the first true leaves of _PROTEIN_ oes were yellow whereas those of the wild type remained green . phenotypic differences were absent when grown on _METHOD_ medium . under nitrogen starvation conditions the relative chlorophyll contents of _PROTEIN_ oes were significantly lower than the wild type . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ overexpression promoted both dd and nitrogen starvation induced leaf senescence . when we investigated if _PROTEIN_ oes were altered in age dependent leaf senescence differences were absent between soil grown _PROTEIN_ oes and the wild type in the first weeks but bottom rosette leaves in all week old _PROTEIN_ oes but not the wild type had yellowed indicating the onset of leaf senescence . approximately of rosette leaves in week old _PROTEIN_ oes were yellow in comparison to the wild type of which the majority of leaves remained green . measurements of chlorophyll content of and week old rosettes from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ oes revealed a significant decline at weeks and in oes in comparison to the wild type . premature leaf senescence in _PROTEIN_ oe rosettes was accompanied by increased electrolyte leakage at weeks and and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ lipid content at week in comparison to the wild type . analysis of total rosette rna from and week old oes and the wild type showed _PROTEIN_ of senescence marker genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in week old oe plants but not in the wild type . also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were upregulated in these oes . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not vary between the wild type and oes . in week old plants the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in comparison to week old plants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were higher in the _PROTEIN_ oes . although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was downregulated in week old plants it was higher in the _PROTEIN_ oes . when premature leaf senescence was assessed in detached leaves leaves from week old oe showed accelerated senescence marked by yellowing d after detachment while those of the wild type remained dark green . a t dna insertional mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified to examine further the role of _PROTEIN_ in leaf senescence . pcr analysis followed by dna sequence analysis confirmed the t dna insertion in the mrna splicing site of the second intron of _PROTEIN_ . rna gel blot analysis indicated _PROTEIN_ of truncated _PROTEIN_ mrnas . rt pcr followed by dna sequencing analyses revealed a kb truncated mrna with the second exon deleted and a kb mrna inclusive of t dna sequences generated from splicing at the right border of the inserted t dna . subsequently the _PROTEIN_ mutant was complemented and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in three independent putative complemented transformants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by rt pcr analysis . when _PROTEIN_ grown week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were transferred to dd wild type leaves yellowed after d while most mutant leaves remained green . after recovery under _PROTEIN_ of the wild type died while of mutants survived . the complementation lines were similarly treated and a representative line shows reversal of the _PROTEIN_ delayed leaf senescence phenotype back to the wild type phenotype . when the chlorophyll content and electrolyte leakage of the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ before and after dd treatment were measured the relative chlorophyll content in the mutant was significantly higher than in either the wild type or _PROTEIN_ . electrolyte leakage in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was significantly lower at to d after dd than in the wild type while those of _PROTEIN_ were significantly greater than the wild type at to d . detection of truncated mrnas in the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutant prompted us to use an rna interference approach to generate _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic lines . rna gel blot analysis using total rna from week old rosettes of wild type and rnai lines before and h after dd treatment as well as from week old plants showed very low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both wild type and rnai lines noticeable downregulation in rnai lines h after dark treatment and marked downregulation in week old senescing rosettes . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not vary between wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines downregulation in the rnai lines was deemed _PROTEIN_ specific . similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant no obvious developmental abnormalities were observed in _PROTEIN_ grown rnai seedlings . we also failed to find any significant phenotypic difference in age dependent leaf senescence among wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and rnai lines . however d dd treated rnai and rnai lines exhibited a delay in leaf senescence with death rates significantly lower than that of the wild type suggesting that rnai of _PROTEIN_ arrested dark induced leaf senescence . _PROTEIN_ in rosette _LOCATION_ lipid content of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ rnai line d after dd treatment were significantly less than that of the wild type . taken together we conclude that _PROTEIN_ kos _PROTEIN_ inhibited the effects of dd induced leaf senescence . to correlate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ lipid composition total lipids were extracted from rosettes of week old _PROTEIN_ grown wild type _PROTEIN_ oe and _PROTEIN_ ko _PROTEIN_ plants followed by analysis of individual lipid molecular species using electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . here and throughout individual acyl chains for arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ lipid molecular species are indicated based on determination by citation . results showed that the phosphatidylethanolamine content of _PROTEIN_ grown rosette leaves from wild type _PROTEIN_ oe and _PROTEIN_ ko plants were in the order _PROTEIN_ oes > wild type > _PROTEIN_ kos . moreover particular pe molecular species were differentially affected by _PROTEIN_ overexpression and suppression _PROTEIN_ . in particular pe molecular species and pe were higher in the _PROTEIN_ oe plants and lower in the _PROTEIN_ ko plants relative to the wild type . differences in pe composition were further confirmed by calculation of pe composition _LOCATION_ as well as pe/pc ratios . by contrast few differences were observed between rosettes of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ oes or the wild type and _PROTEIN_ kos in other lipid species including digalactosyldiacylglycerol monogalactosyldiacylglycerol phosphatidylglycerol pc phosphatidylinositol _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylserine phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ lysopc lysope and lysopg . total amount of lipid in each head group class in week old leaves of the wild type _PROTEIN_ oes and _PROTEIN_ kos _PROTEIN_ grown under _PROTEIN_ subsequently lipid profiling was performed on lipids extracted from rosettes of week old dd treated wild type _PROTEIN_ oes and _PROTEIN_ kos as well as week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ oes . following dd treatment all wild type _PROTEIN_ oes and _PROTEIN_ kos showed _PROTEIN_ or a tendency toward _PROTEIN_ in galactolipids dgdg and mgdg this reflected changes in multiple molecular species . overall the _PROTEIN_ in dgdg and mgdg in _PROTEIN_ oes were greater than in the wild type while such _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ kos were less than in the wild type . lower levels of galactolipids compared with the wild type were also observed in week old rosettes of oes . total amount of lipid in each head group class in or week old leaves of the wild type _PROTEIN_ oes and _PROTEIN_ kos grown under _PROTEIN_ or dds among phospholipids both dd treated and week old _PROTEIN_ oes showed _PROTEIN_ in pe pc and _PROTEIN_ and increases in _PROTEIN_ but these changes were not observed in dd treated _PROTEIN_ kos . in particular dd treated oes exhibited significant loss in the phospholipid molecular species pe pc and _PROTEIN_ while the _PROTEIN_ molecular species and _PROTEIN_ were higher in the oes . significant increases in particular _PROTEIN_ species were accompanied by _PROTEIN_ in the corresponding pc species during dd treatment . similarly in week old oes higher levels of molecular species of and _PROTEIN_ occurred along with lower levels of and _PROTEIN_ while higher levels of and _PROTEIN_ were accompanied by lower levels of and in both pc and pe . these results suggest possible conversion of pc pe and _PROTEIN_ species to _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ oes . in addition pe was higher in week old oes . although the actual amount of pe species was lower in dd treated and week old oes than in the wild type the mole percentage of pe was significantly higher than in the wild type likewise the pe/pc ratio was increased in oes compared with the wild type in dd treatment and in week old oes . taken together the lipid profiling data indicate that _PROTEIN_ overexpression is correlated with relative increases in pe and _PROTEIN_ at the expense of other phospholipids particularly pc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suppression is associated with a relative _PROTEIN_ in pe levels . galactolipids that contain oxophytodienoic acid and dinor opda have been identified in arabidopsis . those species containing two or more opda or dnopda chains have been termed arabidopsides . to test whether the accelerated leaf senescence phenotype in _PROTEIN_ oe rosettes is related to arabidopsides we analyzed oxidized _LOCATION_ lipids including galactolipids and phospholipids in dd treated and week old _PROTEIN_ oe rosettes in comparison to the wild type . electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was employed to perform precursor scanning for detection of _LOCATION_ lipids containing oxidized acyl species . as shown in figure in arabidopsis rosettes oxidized mgdg and arabidopside e like species were significantly higher in week old dd treated and week old _PROTEIN_ grown oe rosettes than in the wild type of the same age and treatment . levels of arabidopsides a b and d were more than and fold higher respectively in week old dd treated _PROTEIN_ oes than in the wild type . all acylated mgdg species were higher in leaves of _PROTEIN_ oes than in those of the wild type after dd treatment . in week old _PROTEIN_ oes arabidopsides a b and d were and fold higher than in the wild type . among the six acylated mgdgs arabidopsides e and arabidopside g were significantly higher in rosettes of oe lines than in those of the wild type . in addition oxidized pg species identified as and displayed significant increases in week old dd treated but not in week old oe lines . furthermore analyses of acyl coa content of rosettes from both _PROTEIN_ and rnai leaves did not reveal any differences in acyl coa profiles in comparison to the wild type . however saturated and coa species as well as polyunsaturated coa significantly increased in the two _PROTEIN_ oes while other species such as and coa remained unchanged . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was reexamined by protein blot analysis using _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies and stable transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ because the previously reported transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dsred consisted of only the first of amino acids in _PROTEIN_ and lacked the acyl coa binding domain . _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies were observed to cross react with total protein from dd treated wild type but not with that from either _PROTEIN_ grown wild type or the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to demonstrate targeting of the _PROTEIN_ native protein within the apoplast the intercellular fluids which contain _LOCATION_ localized proteins in plant leaf cells were isolated from dd treated wild type arabidopsis and transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . protein blot analyses indicated that the kd _PROTEIN_ native protein and kd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were detected in the if preparations using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies respectively . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present in both soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . to investigate the significance of the _PROTEIN_ signal sequence /transmembrane domain in targeting stable transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which lacks the signal sequence were generated . these plants were phenotypically similar to the wild type when grown under _PROTEIN_ . dd treated week old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants showed _METHOD_ of accelerated leaf senescence similar to that of _PROTEIN_ oes while the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines behaved like the wild type . almost all rosettes of week old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines had yellowed whereas wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rosettes remained green suggesting that proper targeting is essential for _PROTEIN_ accelerated senescence . confocal microscopy showed that _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized at the cell periphery in the primary root cells . by contrast the _METHOD_ transformed control was _PROTEIN_ in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . the signal sequence/transmembrane domain is deemed essential in _PROTEIN_ targeting because _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed plants showed green _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . to confirm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization further the primary root cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were subjected to plasmolysis . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the apoplast and _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ root cells but not in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells . to verify the intracellular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hypocotyl cells of d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were stained with the _LOCATION_ labeling dye bodipy bfa which labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ /golgi complex in living cells . intracellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ predominantly colocalized and accumulated in the periphery of _LOCATION_ complex . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ signal sequence/transmembrane domain functions in targeting and that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ space intracellular _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ complex . we further performed in vitro filter binding assays to test the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and various phospholipids and galactolipids . recombinant proteins consisting of a his tag fused to the _PROTEIN_ acyl coa binding domain or to a his tagged deletion mutant lacking the acyl coa binding domain were _PROTEIN_ and purified . filter binding assays indicated that binds pc and pe and removal of the acyl coa binding domain in disrupted binding . by using an independent liposome binding assay was also shown to bind pc and pe liposomes but did not bind liposomes consisting of _PROTEIN_ and ps . since the buffers used for both filter binding and liposome binding assays were at neutral ph and _PROTEIN_ was localized to both the apoplast and the _LOCATION_ the effect of different ph values on _PROTEIN_ binding was examined . _PROTEIN_ was observed to bind to pc and pe at either acidic or alkaline ph . when binding of molecular species of pc or pe was subsequently tested was observed to bind all species of pc and pe tested . lipidex assays have shown that binds polyunsaturated coa and shows low affinities to either saturated or monounsaturated acyl coas . using similar assays also binds other two polyunsaturated acyl coas coa and coa with the dissociation constants of and respectively and removal of the acyl coa binding domain abrogated binding . lipidex competition assays were used to determine if pc and pe liposomes could compete with coa in binding . the binding of coa to _PROTEIN_ in the presence of both pc and pe liposomes implying that binding was displaced by the pc and pe liposomes . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ specifically binds pc pe and polyunsaturated acyl coa esters via the acyl coa binding domain . conjugation of the ubiquitin like protein _PROTEIN_ and pe produces an _PROTEIN_ pe complex that is essential for autophagosome formation . to investigate whether the senescence phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ oes and _PROTEIN_ kos _PROTEIN_ are related to changes in pe transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the autophagy marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion were generated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and crossed to _PROTEIN_ oe and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants to produce oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and rnai _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . when seedlings were grown on nitrogen lacking _METHOD_ medium for d the primary root lengths of oe were significantly shorter than the wild type while those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and rnai were longer . in comparison the root growth of oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to oe and rnai _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and rnai . dd treated and week old oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants also displayed an accelerated leaf senescence phenotype like oe . when roots of week old seedlings of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ grown on _METHOD_ medium were transferred to _METHOD_ under _PROTEIN_ or dd for d and then observed by confocal microscopy _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in many _PROTEIN_ shaped and punctuate structures representing the autophagosomes under _PROTEIN_ . these structures were more abundant in the root cells upon dd treatment . fewer of these autophagosome structures were detected in root cells of oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under either _PROTEIN_ or dd although some small dotted structures were evident . these results were further confirmed by analysis of similarly treated wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings following by staining with monodansylcadaverine a _METHOD_ dye labeling autophagosomes in arabidopsis cells . numerous mdc stained autophagosomes accumulated in root cells of wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings after d of dd treatment and autophagosome formation was disrupted in oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ root cells . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins are processed by removal of their c terminal portion to facilitate conjugation of the processed proteins with pe followed by a second processing event that may result in degradation of _PROTEIN_ . to understand further the possible role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating the _PROTEIN_ protein posttranslational analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as well as oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were conducted . protein blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibodies showed that under _PROTEIN_ conditions two bands were detected in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the upper band corresponds to the expected c terminal processed form of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the lower band to the _METHOD_ domain alone which likely represents a degraded form of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . dd treatment enhanced conversion to the degraded form . by contrast the c terminal processed bands of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in oe _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were much weaker than those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ and were undetectable under dd consistent with progressive degradation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the early senescence phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ oes is salicylic acid or jasmonic acid dependent we generated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double combinations by crossing the oe plant with mutants known to inactivate sa and ja signaling pathways respectively _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . age dependent early senescence in oe was completely suppressed following crosses with the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not with the _PROTEIN_ mutant in both whole plants and detached leaves of the oe line . when plants were subjected to dd treatment all oe plants died while oe survived better than oe and oe suggesting that early senescence in _PROTEIN_ oes is dependent on the sa but not the ja signaling pathway .

from _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the bamhi site of pbi _METHOD_ and orientations of the inserts were determined by enzyme digestion . to generate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ cdna was
