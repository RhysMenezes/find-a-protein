calcium signaling and dynamic reorganization of the _LOCATION_ are essential processes for the coordination and control of plant cell shape and cell growth . calmodulin and closely related calmodulin like polypeptides are principal sensors of signals . cam/cmls decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities . the plant specific domain family emerged as possibly the largest class of cam interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles . here we show that the members of the iqd family in arabidopsis differentially localize using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged proteins to multiple and distinct subcellular sites including microtubule arrays _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ subdomains and _LOCATION_ compartments . intriguingly the various iqd specific localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of iqd dependent recruitment of cam suggesting that the diverse iqd members sequester cam signaling modules to specific subcellular sites for precise regulation of dependent processes . because mt localization is a hallmark of most iqd family members we quantitatively analyzed _METHOD_ labeled mt arrays in nicotiana benthamiana cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iqd fusions and observed iqd specific mt patterns which point to a role of iqds in mt organization and dynamics . indeed stable overexpression of select iqd proteins in arabidopsis altered cellular mt orientation cell shape and organ morphology . because iqds share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins we propose that iqd families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating cam dependent signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function shape and growth .
to gain insights into the cellular sites of iqd function we studied the subcellular distribution of all arabidopsis iqd family members after transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves which is a convenient system in which to monitor protein localization . we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged iqds under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to facilitate their detection . the authentic _METHOD_ reporter was included as a reference which uniformly labeled the cytoplasm and cell _LOCATION_ with the exception of its nucleolus . we confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of all full length iqd fusion proteins by immunoblot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . n terminal _METHOD_ fusions of most iqd proteins were associated at least partially with cytoskeletal arrays . localization to the mt _LOCATION_ was confirmed by coexpression with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tubulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a marker for mts as shown for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . about half of the _METHOD_ tagged iqd family members labeled the pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ envelope _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition several _METHOD_ iqd fusions localized to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nucleolus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or distinct _LOCATION_ bodies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . their translocation into the _LOCATION_ is likely an active process because the size of most _METHOD_ iqd fusions exceeds the exclusion limit of _LOCATION_ pores and most _LOCATION_ localized iqd proteins contain predicted _LOCATION_ localization signals . the smallest family member _PROTEIN_ lacks a _LOCATION_ localization signal thus its _METHOD_ fusion is capable of passive diffusion into the _LOCATION_ . to validate the recorded subcellular localization patterns of n terminal _METHOD_ iqd fusion proteins we selected six iqd members for independent localization studies which represent the distinct localization patterns and the major phylogenetic clades of the arabidopsis iqd family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we obtained similar results in the n. benthamiana system for the six selected c terminal iqd _METHOD_ fusion proteins which we _PROTEIN_ under the control of either the camv promoter or the native iqd promoters . transfection of arabidopsis leaves with the corresponding pro _METHOD_ iqd constructs and analysis of subcellular _METHOD_ iqd localization further supported the localization results . thus the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged iqds is independent of _METHOD_ tag configuration _PROTEIN_ level and experimental system . _PROTEIN_ under the control of native iqd promoters however resulted in weak _METHOD_ signals . in combination with in silico analyses which indicate very low iqd mrna levels our data suggest that iqd gene _PROTEIN_ correlates with low iqd protein abundance . in conclusion our data provide solid support for the arabidopsis iqd family being a novel class of cambps with presumed functions at mts at the pm and in _LOCATION_ compartments . the targeting of several iqd proteins to mts as well as to the pm prompted us to study in more detail the distribution of select iqds displaying a prominent pm localization . imaging of the upper surface of transiently transformed n. benthamiana epidermis cells revealed a nonuniform distribution of _METHOD_ iqd proteins within the pm . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labeled filamentous structures that align along mts which is corroborated by coexpression with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in filamentous structures is abolished upon treatment with the mt depolymerizing drug oryzalin . in addition all four _METHOD_ iqd fusion proteins mark distinct punctate structures . these patterns are reminiscent of _LOCATION_ subdomains which are largely immobile compartments within the pm and thought to serve as _METHOD_ of signal transduction _PROTEIN_ . we observed similar localization patterns for two pm subdomain marker proteins of the plant specific remorin family and which we included as controls . the pattern of labeled pm domains differed and ranged from a more homogenous labeling _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the decoration of distinct circular structures _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with an average size between and . to assess the _PROTEIN_ stability of _METHOD_ iqd labeled pm domains we performed time lapse experiments and generated kymographs . as shown for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the labeled domains remained stationary for at least min . similarly pm domains labeled by the other _METHOD_ iqd fusions were temporally stable as indicated by continuous vertical lines in the kymographs . the high _PROTEIN_ stability of iqd labeled domains together with the pattern of pm localization suggest that iqd proteins are novel components of pm subdomains in planta . we generated transgenic pro _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines to confirm pm localization in arabidopsis . as observed in n. benthamiana leaf cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ decorated the periphery of root cells in a punctate pattern . our data are in agreement with work by citation who reported the formation of pm subdomains in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis . as expected _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized upon plasmolysis with the pm and not with the cell wall which were stained with and propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ respectively . pm localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was further corroborated by immunogold labeling using an anti _METHOD_ antibody which indicated enrichment of gold particles at the pm in tissue sections of root apices . interestingly the shape and size of the rosette leaves were altered in plants overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or untagged _PROTEIN_ when compared with wild type or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control lines respectively . the cotyledons of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants also showed significant alterations in the shape of epidermal pavement cells . however we did not notice visible morphological changes in _PROTEIN_ loss of function lines . _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detectable in the shoot apical meristem and in the youngest leaves but not in older parts of cotyledons and leaves . thus the observed phenotypes in pro _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and pro _PROTEIN_ might be a result of ectopic _PROTEIN_ . alternatively the lack of phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ mutants possibly points to a high degree of functional redundancy within the iqd family . because mt localization is a hallmark of the arabidopsis iqd family and iqd overexpression alters plant development we hypothesized that iqd proteins function in mt dependent processes . to quantitatively record mt patterns we _PROTEIN_ an approach used previously to measure actin structures in mammalian cells . we imaged epidermal cell outlines in the red channel by _PROTEIN_ staining or by the _PROTEIN_ of an _METHOD_ fused pm localized protein plasmodesmata located _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and traced _METHOD_ iqd decorated mt arrays in the green channel . two channel maximum projections of z stacks covering the upper half of the epidermal cell layer were analyzed texture feature vectors were extracted from square windows based on local binary patterns and groups of mt patterns were defined by cluster analysis . the relative distribution of windows belonging to each group was determined for each individual cell . pairwise distances between the most strongly mt associated _METHOD_ iqd fusions were visualized in a heat map . to validate our approach we tested the robustness and reliability of the tool using different window sizes and by applying sliding windows of sizes to . all samples showed the same trends irrespective of the window settings . thus we conclude that our computational pattern analysis tool is suitable to efficiently and robustly quantify mt array patterns . to assess mt patterns more broadly we generated a similarity network . our analysis revealed high similarity between mt networks labeled by iqd members of phylogenetic groups ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ iiib and iv with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a second cluster includes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in general we noticed a tendency of phylogenetically related iqds to decorate similar mt patterns . notably mt patterns observed by the overexpression of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differed from all others and potentially reflect specialized functions . to test our pattern analysis tool and study the functions of iqd proteins in arabidopsis we initially focused on _PROTEIN_ because our data indicated mt localization of _PROTEIN_ in a highly distinctive pattern . we did not observe phenotypic alterations for _PROTEIN_ t dna loss of function lines even after careful examination of tissues in which _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ is detectable . however plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ develop elongated aerial organs with significantly elongated cells and display left handed helical growth . phenotypic strength correlated with pro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and suggests _PROTEIN_ dosage dependent effects on plant growth . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines display similar phenotypes indicating the functionality of the fusion protein . helical growth aberrations and altered leaf shape were reported for tomato sun lines and often are associated with defects in mt functions . moreover the growth defects are reminiscent of plants overexpressing recruiting _PROTEIN_ which encodes a plant specific map . hence the observed phenotypes point to roles of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of mt arrays . to analyze mt organization we crossed the _METHOD_ marker into pro _PROTEIN_ lines . when compared with the parental wild type _METHOD_ line light grown plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed significantly elongated cells and the increased cell length of _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants correlated with an altered orientation of cortical mts . consistent with previous reports mts in wild type _METHOD_ hypocotyl cells were distributed randomly . however in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines mts decorated by the _METHOD_ reporter were aligned preferentially in oblique arrays with angles between and . thus our experiments show that _PROTEIN_ localizes to cortical mts in arabidopsis and impacts mt orientation and cell shape . we extended our analysis in arabidopsis to validate the roles of additional iqd proteins at mts . we selected _PROTEIN_ which labeled mt patterns highly similar to _PROTEIN_ in the n. benthamiana system and _PROTEIN_ which decorates mt arrays in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis in patterns different from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the high similarity of mt patterns upon overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana the phenotypes of transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resembled those of _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled mt arrays in patterns similar to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal hypocotyl cells of transgenic arabidopsis seedlings and overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced the elongation of epidermis pavement cells . we observed distinct phenotypes upon overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants displayed strongly induced organ twisting but no changes in leaf elongation . similar phenotypes were reported for tortifolia and spiral mutants . helical growth defects commonly correlate with an increased transverse alignment of mts which are visible upon the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed the mt specificity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by the treatment of transgenic arabidopsis seedlings with the mt depolymerizing drug oryzalin . we included transgenic _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lines as controls for the mt and actin _LOCATION_ respectively . oryzalin treatment efficiently disrupted mt networks but had no effect on the actin _LOCATION_ . analysis of _METHOD_ gus and _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ revealed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the hypocotyl cotyledons leaf tissues and petioles . thus the phenotypes in combination with the observed mt localization suggest that elevated levels of iqd proteins may have diverse effects on mt organization and cell growth control in tissues with endogenous iqd _PROTEIN_ . moreover our pattern analysis tool proves to be a useful resource for the study of mt organization in complex shaped cells and provides to our knowledge the first experimental evidence for roles of iqd proteins in the regulation of mt networks and cell shape . the differential subcellular localization of iqd family members prompted us to test whether iqd proteins recruit cam to diverse subcellular sites . we selected eight iqd proteins representing the phylogenetic clades and different localization patterns of the arabidopsis iqd family and performed bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays which detect protein protein interactions in planta with subcellular resolution . coexpression in n. benthamiana of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reconstitutes _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at mts and in the nucle us which is highly similar to the observed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization . similarly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ interacted with _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at mts . for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bifc signals were detected in distinct pm subdomains and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ interacted with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ served as a negative control and the recovery of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detectable with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which confirmed the specificity of the bifc assay . we independently verified the physical in vivo interactions of _PROTEIN_ and select iqds by coexpression studies which revealed _METHOD_ iqd fusion protein dependent relocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . when coexpressed with _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ whereas coexpression with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced the recruitment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to mts and the nucleolus as reported previously . in addition coexpression with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ caused the recruitment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to mts and relocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the pm was evident upon coexpression with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thus iqd proteins recruit _PROTEIN_ and possibly other cam/cmls to mts pm subdomains and _LOCATION_ compartments . interaction of iqd proteins with _PROTEIN_ did not abolish iqd localization to mts or the pm suggesting that subcellular targeting of iqd proteins is independent of cam recruitment .

_PROTEIN_ staining or by _PROTEIN_ pm localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in maximum projections cell outlines appear as thin vessel like structures with locally varying contrast . the contrast was optimized by smoothing of the image with a gaussian filter and applying a mexican hat filter in steps of to emphasize vessel like structures . the resulting images containing the maximal filter response for each pixel were binarized by local niblack thresholding as implemented in mitobo . subsequently postprocessing steps were applied to the binary images which allowed the extraction of large parts of the cell boundaries . remaining gaps were corrected by manual postprocessing and cells exceeding the image border were excluded manually . subsequently texture analysis techniques were applied to automatically characterize mt organization as stated in the result section of the _PROTEIN_ text . the feature vectors of all cells were jointly clustered applying k means . for each cell the ratio of windows belonging to the different k clusters was calculated which results in a k dimensional cluster distribution vector . each cluster refers to a specific structural pattern appearing in the cells hence each vector can be interpreted as a probability density distribution of these patterns appearing in the corresponding cell . from the set of vectors pairwise distances or distances between average vectors for each cell line were extracted and visualized in heat maps or adjacency networks . the plots shown in this study were generated by applying nonoverlapping windows with a

optical sections of epidermis pavement cells with fiji and margin roughness and eccentricity were calculated as measures of smoothness of the contour and cellular elongation respectively . as a measure of cell shape regularity first an average angle of tangent orientation changes is computed along the cell contour based on tangent orientations of pairs of adjacent contour points . next the deviation of the calculated angle from the angle expected for a perfect circle with an equal number of sampling points is calculated referred to as margin roughness . a higher margin roughness value corresponds to a higher degree of nonsmoothness and reflects the extent of cellular lobing . eccentricity is defined as the ratio between the extension of a region along its _PROTEIN_ axis and along the corresponding perpendicular axis . the extension along each axis is extracted from second order central moments of the cell region . an almost circular region has an eccentricity value of which increases with increasing elongation . for ultrastructural localization of _METHOD_ tagged proteins root tips were transferred into aluminum planchettes and high pressure frozen with an hpm apparatus

citrate in an em stain apparatus and subsequently observed with an em transmission electron microscope . micrographs were taken with the variospeed ssccd . statistical analysis was performed in r by
