the uv a/blue light photoreceptor _PROTEIN_ plays a fundamental role in the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in the facultative long day plant arabidopsis thaliana . the _PROTEIN_ protein level strongly _PROTEIN_ when etiolated seedlings are exposed to blue light _PROTEIN_ is first phosphorylated polyubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome . _PROTEIN_ is involved in _PROTEIN_ degradation but several _PROTEIN_ mutants show only reduced but not abolished _PROTEIN_ degradation . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ proteins are known to work in concert with _PROTEIN_ and recently direct physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated . thus we hypothesized that spa proteins could also play a role in _PROTEIN_ degradation . to this end we analyzed _PROTEIN_ protein levels in spa mutants . in all spa mutants analyzed _PROTEIN_ degradation under continuous blue light was alleviated in a fluence rate dependent manner . consistent with a role of spa proteins in phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ signaling a _PROTEIN_ mutant had enhanced _PROTEIN_ levels particularly under low fluence rate blue light . _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy studies showed a robust physical interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ of living cells . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ stability is controlled by spa and _PROTEIN_ thus providing more information on the molecular _METHOD_ of interaction between cryptochrome and phytochrome photoreceptors .
_PROTEIN_ is rapidly degraded in etiolated arabidopsis seedlings when exposed to continuous blue light . since _PROTEIN_ plays a role in _PROTEIN_ degradation spa proteins work in concert with _PROTEIN_ and both _PROTEIN_ and spas physically interact with _PROTEIN_ we questioned whether spa proteins have a function in _PROTEIN_ degradation . to this end we studied the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ degradation in etiolated columbia wild type and _PROTEIN_ triple mutant seedlings exposed to continuous blue light . _PROTEIN_ protein levels were quantified using a li cor odyssey infrared imaging system which allowed reliable detection of an infrared fluorophore labeled secondary antibody that recognizes the _PROTEIN_ specific antibody . _PROTEIN_ protein levels were normalized here and in subsequent experiments to the tubulin signal obtained from the same immunoblot the _PROTEIN_ protein levels were in the linear range for both the _PROTEIN_ and the tubulin signals . the specificity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody was again confirmed with extracts obtained from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants that showed no _PROTEIN_ signal on immunoblots . a very rapid and strong blue light induced _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels was observed in the wild type with essentially no detectable protein remaining after min of irradiation even though the applied fluence rate of blue light was only moderate . likewise _PROTEIN_ rapidly degraded in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings kept under the same light conditions but the extent of _PROTEIN_ degradation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was lower than in the wild type . this resulted in significantly higher _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type at and min after the onset of irradiation . albeit significant the differences in _PROTEIN_ protein levels between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant were not very great under the fluence rate of blue light used in this experiment . since _PROTEIN_ degradation is fluence rate dependent we analyzed the dose response of _PROTEIN_ degradation in the wild type and spa mutants . in these studies we included the _PROTEIN_ single mutant all combinations of spa triple mutants and the _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant that lacks all spa proteins . particularly under low fluence rates of blue light the degradation of _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced in all spa mutants tested . however under low fluence rates the reduction in _PROTEIN_ degradation in the _PROTEIN_ triple was less pronounced than in the other mutants and under higher fluence rates the _PROTEIN_ level was higher in the _PROTEIN_ triple than in the wild type and the other spa mutants . since the _PROTEIN_ levels in darkness when normalized to the tubulin signal as a loading control were essentially the same in the wild type and the spa mutants the higher level of _PROTEIN_ in the spa mutants is due to reduced degradation during irradiation and not to increased synthesis . the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels of blue light irradiated seedlings was previously shown to be caused by enhanced protein degradation and not by a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . to confirm that the same holds true under our experimental conditions we analyzed _PROTEIN_ transcript levels by quantitative rt pcr . there was no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels comparing dark grown and low fluence rate blue light treated wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . compared with dark grown seedlings when seedlings were treated for h with a higher fluence rate of blue light we observed some _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transcripts . however this _PROTEIN_ was again the same for all genotypes . we conclude from this result that neither spas nor _PROTEIN_ has an effect on the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . in line with the conclusion that the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ regulated at the protein level citation found that _PROTEIN_ degradation in the columbia ecotype is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor . using even higher doses of blue light and a combination of different proteasome inhibitors we found a similar reduction in _PROTEIN_ degradation by the proteasome inhibitors for all ecotypes applied in our study . this _METHOD_ again that the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels seen under blue light irradiation is the result of a proteolytic degradation occurring in all arabidopsis accessions tested here . in contrast with the effect of blue light irradiation of seedlings with red light has essentially no effect on _PROTEIN_ levels therefore it was concluded that _PROTEIN_ degradation depends exclusively on blue light . we found the same lack of effect of red light on _PROTEIN_ levels in an experiment using the same fluence rates of red light that we used for the blue light experiments . similarly far red light at high fluence rates did not result in any degradation of _PROTEIN_ . these results are also in line with previous data showing that activation of phytochromes alone has no effect on _PROTEIN_ levels independent of the phytochrome response modes analyzed . moreover our data are consistent with the point of view that photoactivation of _PROTEIN_ which occurs only with wavelengths below nm is required and sufficient for _PROTEIN_ degradation . spa proteins are involved in the signaling cascade of _PROTEIN_ during the deetiolation process . considering the above shown role of spas in _PROTEIN_ degradation we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ has a role in _PROTEIN_ degradation . surprisingly much less _PROTEIN_ was degraded in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under very low and low fluence rates of blue light . this effect was nearly as pronounced as that observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . at higher fluence rates the difference between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not significant the _PROTEIN_ mutant had higher but not significantly different _PROTEIN_ levels than the wild type under high fluence rates of blue light . our data show that there is a very low fluence response of _PROTEIN_ resulting in enhanced _PROTEIN_ degradation which occurs only when _PROTEIN_ itself is photoactivated by blue light . this finding provoked us to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ also promotes _PROTEIN_ degradation . however the observed _PROTEIN_ levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were not statistically different from those of the wild type . surprisingly the extent of _PROTEIN_ degradation under blue light fluence rates of up to was much lower in the landsberg _LOCATION_ wild type than in the col wild type . for example irradiation of the col wild type with blue light for h at resulted in about a lower amount of _PROTEIN_ protein compared with the dark level whereas the same irradiation of ler wild type caused only a lower amount . this generally weaker _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ levels in the ler ecotype under low fluence rates of blue light might explain the similarly less pronounced effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the ler background compared with the col background . _PROTEIN_ degradation under low fluence rates of blue light is even less pronounced in the rschew accession compared with col and ler accessions . likewise _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in the rld background behaved like the wild type in the dose dependent degradation of _PROTEIN_ . the reason for this discrepancy between different accessions is not clear yet . however the lower sensitivity of ler and rld accessions compared with col is not the result of different _METHOD_ of downregulation of _PROTEIN_ protein levels since plants of all accessions showed a qualitatively similar response to the proteasome inhibitors . moreover no significant difference was seen between col ler and rld accessions in their dose response curves of hypocotyl growth inhibition under blue light . thus the different sensitivities of these three arabidopsis accessions against blue light are not a general feature but could be specific for the degradation of _PROTEIN_ . recently it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ of fixed arabidopsis cells and in _LOCATION_ of onion epidermal cells . also these authors used coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two hybrid interaction techniques to show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . moreover it was demonstrated by yeast two hybrid studies that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also interact with _PROTEIN_ however _PROTEIN_ showed the most robust interaction among all four spa proteins . although these data clearly show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with all four spas it can not be excluded that in _LOCATION_ of living plant cells some of these interactions are mediated by _PROTEIN_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ . we therefore applied fret flim to analyze more rigorously direct interactions between _PROTEIN_ and all members of the spa quartet . as a positive control we used cryptochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loop _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which has been shown to bind to photoactivated _PROTEIN_ in living plant yeast and mammalian cells . to this end full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ either at the n or c terminus respectively . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ full length proteins were fused to the _METHOD_ proteins only at their n terminus since c terminal fusions are not tolerated by these proteins . genes encoding these fusions were introduced into light grown nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration . _PROTEIN_ of full length fusion proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and all four spas localized to _LOCATION_ as additionally verified using the mcherry nls reporter . moreover the pictures from the merged _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ channels showed that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ and all four spas . this supports previous findings for the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ but does not prove unambiguously a direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with all spas . to test this in greater detail we applied fret flim . this technique allows the detection of direct protein protein interactions of fluorophore labeled partners in living cells which results in shorter _METHOD_ lifetimes of the donor fluorophore depending on the rate of energy transfer to the acceptor fluorophore . the results of these measurements are shown in figure . as negative controls we used the _METHOD_ lifetimes of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ single transformant and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls double transformant which were in the same range of nano seconds . the positive controls _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed significantly shorter lifetimes compared with the negative controls between and ns . this result clearly _METHOD_ a direct physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of living plant cells . all three combinations tested for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed in comparison to the negative controls significantly reduced _METHOD_ lifetimes in the range between and ns . thus the rate of energy transfer in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ combination is nearly the same as in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . thus _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . since the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with all members of the spa quartet was demonstrated by yeast two hybrid interaction studies we were interested in applying fret flim to test whether these interactions also occur in _LOCATION_ of living plant cells . since in the fret flim assay there was robust interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ detectable independent from which _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was fused to _PROTEIN_ and whether this fusion was made at its n or c terminus we tested only the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ combinations . none of these combinations led to significantly shorter _METHOD_ lifetimes compared with the negative controls although all fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ to similar levels . thus these studies provided no proof for a direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells . to verify these data we conducted in vitro pull down experiments using in vitro transcribed and translated _PROTEIN_ proteins and recombinant affinity purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in insect cells . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in insect cells allows the production of photoactive photoreceptor . the _PROTEIN_ sample used in our studies had a correctly bound fad cofactor and showed a normal photocycle . as a negative control in our pull down experiments we used recombinant and functional escherichia coli dna photolyase as a bait because _PROTEIN_ and photolyase are structurally highly similar flavoproteins but with completely different biological functions . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ and e. coli dna photolyase baits carried a tag which allowed both proteins to be specifically and quantitatively immunoprecipitated with the same anti his tag antibody . the bait and prey proteins and all following steps were incubated either under white light or under safe red light to test whether the interaction is light dependent . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nearly identical signals were obtained in the white and red light assays independent of the presence of _PROTEIN_ . we interpret these signals obtained in the absence of _PROTEIN_ as unspecific binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the his tag antibody and/or the protein g magnetic beads . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ no unspecific signals were obtained for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the addition of _PROTEIN_ to the assays kept in white light resulted in clear signals which indicated that these two spa proteins bind to _PROTEIN_ . when the same assays were performed under red light the results were very similar . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seemed to interact with _PROTEIN_ in a light independent fashion . to confirm the significance of these results we performed control experiments with proteins already known to interact directly with _PROTEIN_ . as mentioned above _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ independent of light . the results of our co ip experiments with recombinant _PROTEIN_ and in vitro transcribed and translated _PROTEIN_ are in agreement with this finding . another protein that interacts with _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ a basic helix loop helix protein . indeed we detected _PROTEIN_ binding to _PROTEIN_ under white light but also under red light which suggested a light independent interaction . this result was unexpected since _PROTEIN_ was reported not to interact with _PROTEIN_ under red light . however closer analysis of our results indicated that the coprecipitated fraction of _PROTEIN_ was higher under white light than under red light which is indicative of a higher affinity of _PROTEIN_ to the lit state of _PROTEIN_ than to its dark state . the reliability of our co ip experiments was further confirmed in negative controls using e. coli dna photolyase as the bait protein which did not bind _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ .

was induced by exposing seeds to white light for h at . for analyzing _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels plates were kept after induction of germination for d in the dark at and exposed afterwards to continuous blue red or far red light or kept in darkness for h. plates for hypocotyl growth inhibition measurements were exposed directly after stratification to the dark or to blue red or blue plus red light for h. seedlings were exposed to light emitting diode sources _PROTEIN_ with emission maxima of nm nm and nm . fluence rates were determined using an optometer p spectroradiometer and light intensities were adjusted to the required fluence rates using a gray filter . for determination of _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels plant material was harvested under safe light and immediately shock frozen in liquid nitrogen . for quantification of hypocotyl growth inhibition seedlings were photographed using a nikon coolpix digital camera and hypocotyl lengths were determined using image j . for treatments with proteasome inhibitors seedlings kept in the dark for h after stratification were preincubated for h in the dark either in a mixture of proteasome inhibitors in _METHOD_ or in _METHOD_ as a mock control . afterwards seedlings were exposed for h to blue light or kept for the same time in the dark and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen . the mixture of proteasome inhibitors contained alln and _PROTEIN_ each at . plant material was pulverized in liquid nitrogen using an cell mill and the frozen powder was resuspended in extraction buffer . after three washing steps in acetone containing mercaptoethanol the pellets were resuspended in _PROTEIN_ sample buffer sonicated and boiled for min at . equal amounts of protein extracts were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . for immunodetection polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody raised in rabbits and monoclonal mouse anti tubulin antibody together with the secondary fluorophore labeled antibodies irdye goat anti mouse igg and irdye goat anti rabbit igg were applied using the odyssey infrared imaging system . signal intensities of _PROTEIN_ and tubulin were calculated by the odyssey software . the quantified signals were normalized to the mean background . the _PROTEIN_ signal was normalized against the tubulin signal in the same lane . the level of _PROTEIN_ in the dark sample of each genotype was set as . for quantitative real time pcr total rna was isolated from arabidopsis seedlings using the rneasy plant mini kit . prior to rt pcr isolated rna was treated with turbo dnase for elimination of genomic dna . cdna was synthesized using the first strand cdna kit . every cdna reaction was checked for contamination by residual genomic dna in an additional pcr reaction using the ubq real time primers . quantitative pcr was performed using the sensifast sybr no rox kit with a mastercycler ep realplex apparatus with the following program min s s s cycles . the primers used for _PROTEIN_ were forward _PROTEIN_ and reverse and for ubq forward and reverse . the relative _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were normalized against the ubq signals according to the method . design of full length open reading frame constructs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the gateway entry vector pentr/d topo has been described before . full length orf of _PROTEIN_ without stop codon was pcr amplified from a cdna plasmid with primers forward and reverse _PROTEIN_ . full length orf of _PROTEIN_ without stop codon was rt pcr amplified from total rna isolated from arabidopsis col wild type by primers forward and reverse . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pcr products were introduced in the entry pentr/d topo vector and correctness of the orfs verified by sequencing . transfer of these orfs from the entry to the destination vectors was done using gateway lr clonase ii enzyme mix . the following plant binary destination vectors were used c termini and n termini yielding in frame fusions of the orfs with _METHOD_ at their c _METHOD_ or n terminus _METHOD_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ in these vectors is driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . and yielded in frame fusions of the orfs with _METHOD_ at their c terminus _METHOD_ or n terminus _METHOD_ respectively . in pugt vectors _PROTEIN_ is driven by the arabidopsis ubiquitin promoter . for spas fusions with the _METHOD_ reporters were only made at the n termini of the spa proteins since previous studies showed that they do not tolerate c terminal fusions . after to weeks of cultivation in growth chambers leaves of n. benthamiana plants were transformed with agrobacterium strain . infiltration occurred in the adaxial sides of the leaves . the protein from tomato bushy stunt virus was used for suppression of transgene silencing . transformation of the different _PROTEIN_ vectors encoding the fusion proteins was accomplished as described . three days after infiltration the transient _PROTEIN_ and localization of the fusion proteins in plant epidermal leaf cells were detected using confocal laser scanning microscopy . afterwards some plant material was harvested followed by protein extraction for immunoblot analysis . in vivo interaction studies of the full length fusion proteins were measured by fret flim with a confocal stage scanning microscope according to citation . for each tested combination of fusion proteins three measurements of _METHOD_ lifetime decays were recorded and mean values estimated . some constructs used for in vitro transcription and translation have been described previously _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the construct encoding full length _PROTEIN_ in a modified pbs alarluc vector was available we removed the orf of rluc by restriction with noti and xbai and replaced it by a c myc epitope coding region containing a stop codon . the c myc epitope was generated by annealing of the two mers ggccgctgagcaaaagttgatttctgaggaggatctttagt and ctagactaaagatcctcctcagaaatcaacttttgctcagc which provided a double stranded c myc epitope coding region with a noti overhang at the end and an xbai overhang at the end for ligation into the noti xbai restricted pbs alarluc vector replacing rluc . _PROTEIN_ c myc was cut out of this modified pbs vector using ncoi and bamhi and inserted into the target vector pet . the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified with pfu dna polymerase from col o cdna using primers ccatggccatgaatggagctataggag and gcggccgcaactcctaaattgccatag which contained a restriction site for ncoi and noti respectively . after subcloning of the pcr product into the pgem t vector the pcr product was verified by sequencing . prey proteins were _PROTEIN_ from the promoters in the presence of met using the tnt reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer s instructions . the genes encoding the bait proteins his _PROTEIN_ and his phr were _PROTEIN_ and the proteins were purified as described . for co ip of dynabeads protein g was incubated
