the cell 's endomembranes comprise an intricate highly dynamic and well organized system . in plants the proteins that regulate function of the various endomembrane compartments and their cargo remain largely unknown . our aim was to dissect subcellular trafficking routes by enriching for partially overlapping subpopulations of endosomal proteomes associated with endomembrane markers . we selected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as markers for combinations of the _LOCATION_ trans _LOCATION_ network early endosomes secretory vesicles _PROTEIN_ endosomes _PROTEIN_ multivesicular bodies and the tonoplast . as comparisons we used _LOCATION_ transport which localizes to the _LOCATION_ clathrin light chain _PROTEIN_ labeling clathrin coated vesicles and pits and the vesicle associated _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ present at the tonoplast . we developed an easy to use method by refining published protocols based on affinity purification of _METHOD_ fusion constructs to these seven subcellular marker proteins in arabidopsis thaliana seedlings . we present a total of proteins only five of which were shared among all enrichments while many proteins were common between endomembrane compartments of the same trafficking route . approximately half proteins were assigned to one enrichment only . our dataset contains known regulators of endosome functions including small _PROTEIN_ snares and tethering complexes . we identify known cargo proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the recently defined _PROTEIN_ complex . the subcellular localization of two _PROTEIN_ regulators predicted from our enrichments was validated using live cell imaging . this is the first proteomic dataset to discriminate between such highly overlapping endomembrane compartments in plants and can be used as a general proteomic resource to predict the localization of proteins and identify the components of regulatory complexes and provides a useful tool for the identification of new protein markers of the endomembrane system .
to identify the proteomes of various endomembrane compartments we simplified published affinity purification methods for the enrichment of vesicle associated proteins by removing the sucrose density gradient step and extending the number of selected subcellular markers to create a large scale comparative proteomics approach . for this we used sterile grown a. thaliana seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to the monomeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and as controls seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ proteins only . all these markers were under the control of constitutive promoters ensuring sufficient _PROTEIN_ levels and are detected in seedling leaves at their assigned subcellular localizations . total seedlings were harvested after days of hydroponic growth homogenized and the proteins extracted in buffer followed by single low speed centrifugation . using the workflow outlined in fig . we affinity purified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the respective transgenic lines and assessed the enrichment for possible organelle contamination using western blotting . our approach greatly enriched the relevant bait proteins with no detectable contamination from the _LOCATION_ mitochondria chloroplasts and pm as revealed by our failure to detect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies respectively . no bands to either of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or the organelle markers were identified in affinity purifications from wild type seedlings indicating that abundant _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ associated proteins did not generally bind to the affinity beads . we then proceeded to identify and compare the proteomes of seven different subcellular marker lines . we affinity purified _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the respective transgenic a. thaliana seedlings using _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ beads . we refer to these affinity purifications as endosomal enriched proteomes and acknowledge that because we used liquid nitrogen to freeze plant material it is possible that larger compartments might not remain intact . in this manuscript we use the term compartment as a descriptive term for any _LOCATION_ bound structure that is not an organelle _PROTEIN_ of its size . the proteins from each affinity enrichment were separated by one dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the full dataset is available from the proteomics database pride . all affinity enrichments contained peptides from the corresponding bait protein except for _METHOD_ that was only identified by peptides from _METHOD_ . this is probably because is less amenable to tryptic digests with only two potential peptides between and amino acids in length . proteins were accepted as significantly enriched by a specific bait if their saintexpress score was or higher . the saint scores and spectrum counts for all proteins assigned to each affinity enrichment replicate and associated controls are summarized in table . after saint analysis proteins were accepted being significantly enriched with at least one bait and each affinity enrichment had a number of unique and shared proteins . most proteins were identified from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment of which were uniquely assigned to this bait . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits had the smallest number of proteins assigned to their enrichments with smaller proportions of uniquely assigned proteins . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ both had about proteins assigned to their enrichments but differed in the proportion of unique proteins assigned to each only nine were unique to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ while were unique to _METHOD_ . as several of our bait proteins have related biological functions it is not surprising that we assigned many proteins to more than one affinity enrichment . in addition to excluding proteins that were enriched with the _METHOD_ protein baits only our comparison of seven different baits provides a further measure of likely common contaminant proteins . only five proteins were significantly enriched in all affinity purifications and four proteins were enriched with six of the seven baits . these include chaperonin and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the abc type transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two arm repeat family proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . several chaperones and ribosomal components are considered to be contaminants in affinity purifications and we identified five heat shock proteins six additional proteins and four ribosomal proteins with some but not all of our baits . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments contained several of these proteins and it is possible that the abundance of proteins associated with protein _PROTEIN_ and folding are correlated with the _PROTEIN_ level of the bait protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which we tested for in our western blot assessment of contamination from organelles were not significantly enriched with any bait . however two _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were identified with specific baits and might represent contamination with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins or normal secretion turnover and recycling of these abundant proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with three baits . to determine if proteins with known functions in endomembrane trafficking were identified in our affinity enrichments we manually curated a set of endomembrane regulators from the literature and present the fold enrichment over controls with each of our seven baits . this set of established endomembrane proteins was differentially enriched with each of the seven baits and largely corresponds to the known biological functions of our bait proteins . to visualize the differences and commonalities in the seven affinity enrichments we used the sungear tool from virtual plant . on the sungear plot the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments appear to be distinct from the other enrichments but as discussed above of their assigned proteomes are shared with other baits . however there are few binary overlaps between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rather the shared proteins are common to many baits . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteomes have high numbers of uniquely assigned proteins and share a large binary overlap possibly representing the _PROTEIN_ compartments . there is also substantial pairwise and collective overlaps between the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichment has only nine unique proteins and is nearly a subset of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to compare the proteins we identified with published proteomic studies we complied a comprehensive dataset of proteins identified in the tgn/ee tgn _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria/plastid pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria/plastid/pm/vacuole . the _METHOD_ enrichment contained the highest proportion of previously identified proteins likely due to the greater focus on _LOCATION_ derived proteomes in these studies . to assist with comparisons between the sets of proteins associated with each of our baits and previously published proteomes we provide table . to identify possible cargo proteins from transient interactions of coat proteins and trafficking regulators we extended our bioinformatic analysis to include predicted transmembrane domains and _LOCATION_ associated modifications . in the proteins enriched by at least one of our affinity baits we identified proteins with one transmembrane domain and with multiple transmembrane domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ association lipid modifications and a diverse set of potentially s acylated proteins . the remaining of our dataset did not have any _LOCATION_ association motifs and are putative cargo proteins . the proportions of proteins in each proteome with _LOCATION_ association motifs varied across the enrichments _METHOD_ had the greatest at while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the smallest proportion of _LOCATION_ associated proteins and respectively . the proportion of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ associated proteins is remarkably similar to _LOCATION_ or tgn proteomic studies such as drakakaki et al . or parsons et al . . that our other affinity baits such as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ show lower proportions of _LOCATION_ associated proteins is likely to be a consequence of our choice of bait protein for affinity purification and the biological functions of these small _PROTEIN_ . by targeting _PROTEIN_ regulators of vesicle trafficking we identify more proteins with transient _LOCATION_ interactions such as vesicle coats _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ motor proteins and endomembrane tethers than previous proteomic studies . we included _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in this comparative proteomics study because we expected that the proteins associated with _PROTEIN_ would be substantially different to those enriched with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ baits . our clc _METHOD_ enrichment recovered established clathrin interacting proteins and provides the first independent supportive evidence for the recently defined association of _PROTEIN_ complex components with clathrin . as expected some of the most abundant proteins in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichments were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the bait _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . several accessory proteins involved in cme were also assigned to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichment including components from the _PROTEIN_ complex specifically two _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an epsin n terminal homology domain containing protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a protein _PROTEIN_ and a calcium binding ef hand protein _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ complex appears to persist at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after removal of _PROTEIN_ and possibly through scission . we identified _PROTEIN_ components and dynamin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ possibly capturing several different stages of interactions . interestingly we identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and other members of this complex with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . scission of vesicles from _LOCATION_ is mediated by large _PROTEIN_ such as dynamins and we note that several dynamins were abundantly represented in many of our enrichments including controls and therefore did not pass our significance threshold . only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ passed significance thresholds with three baits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . one of the less well characterized proteins assigned to our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichments was synaptotagmin a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that regulates endocytosis and plasmodesmatal viral movement . lewis et al . demonstrated the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the endocytic tracer dye and with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we identified _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits . a. thaliana has five homologues of synaptotagmin . and little is known about the functions of this family . _PROTEIN_ is the best characterized and functions in resealing _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after stress and _PROTEIN_ is required for unconventional secretion namely _LOCATION_ independent pathways and does not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ or other endosomal markers but only with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in all eukaryotes the _LOCATION_ is an essential organelle for protein secretion n linked protein glycosylation and in plants is essential for the biogenesis and secretion of cell wall polysaccharides . _METHOD_ is a marker for the _LOCATION_ and is homolog of yeast that localized to cis _LOCATION_ . little is known about the precise location and function of within the _LOCATION_ of a. thaliana . however as several _LOCATION_ proteomic studies have been performed we included _METHOD_ as an additional comparison for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ baits and expected it to be an outlier . we compared our _METHOD_ enrichment with published proteomic analyses of _LOCATION_ compartments . two thirds of proteins identified with our _METHOD_ bait were previously identified in _LOCATION_ proteomic analyses . in common with previously published _LOCATION_ proteomes _LOCATION_ localized enzymes were well represented in our _METHOD_ enrichment including galacturonosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xylose synthase _PROTEIN_ and xylose transferase _PROTEIN_ and a udp d _PROTEIN_ epimerase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the gaut proteins all have one tm domain are believed to be localized to discrete subcompartments within the _LOCATION_ additionally _PROTEIN_ is known to interact with _PROTEIN_ . we identified nine s adenosyl l methionine dependent methyltransferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . nikolovski et al . suggest that the sam enzymes are involved in methylation of glycans . four endomembrane family protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also identified in our _METHOD_ dataset . proteins contain nine transmembrane domains and their function is not known . our _METHOD_ enrichment also contained the cis _LOCATION_ localized glycosyltransferase alpha mannosidase ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that was not identified in previous _LOCATION_ proteomes . this protein is frequently used as a marker of the _LOCATION_ by western blotting . although most of the proteins assigned to our _METHOD_ enrichment have been identified in published _LOCATION_ studies our _METHOD_ enrichment contained fewer proteins than were obtained by parson et al . nikoloviski et al . or sadowski et al . . our _METHOD_ enrichment shows an overlap of only seven proteins with the proteins identified in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tgn/ee proteome and just four proteins with the tgn proteome . these differences suggest that _METHOD_ labels and enriches for a distinct area of the _LOCATION_ possibly on the cis _LOCATION_ side . to further test the specificity of our method we compared the _METHOD_ enrichment to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments . these two proteomes should be distinct due to their spatial and functional differentiation to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively and the data support this statement . as expected the _METHOD_ enrichment differed from the proteins identified with our _PROTEIN_ baits and most obviously in that few of the known endomembrane regulatory proteins were identified with this bait . however two _PROTEIN_ regulatory proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a qb snare and a dissociation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified with _METHOD_ and were also seen in previous studies . additionally the r snare _PROTEIN_ was identified with _METHOD_ but was not identified in previous proteomic studies of the _LOCATION_ and tgn . both of these snare proteins are known to localize to the _LOCATION_ and in yeast facilitates snare fusion . plants differ from animals in that they possess numerous highly mobile _LOCATION_ bodies that are tightly associated with the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles mediate traffic between the _LOCATION_ and the cis _LOCATION_ and might be expected to be enriched with our bait . however the _PROTEIN_ proteins we identified assigned to the small _PROTEIN_ baits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the structural roles of the proteins we selected as baits might explain this apparent discrepancy has four tm domains while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ associate transiently with _LOCATION_ . in yeast is packaged into _PROTEIN_ vesicles and cycles between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . it is possible that the _METHOD_ tag interfered with the role in _PROTEIN_ vesicles or that the tag was masked from the affinity _PROTEIN_ by coatmers . in yeast has a role in _LOCATION_ fusion and we identified a novel fusigenic protein with _METHOD_ the large dynamin like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has homology to atlastins and is proposed to mediate _LOCATION_ tubule formation and fusion . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cycle on and off _LOCATION_ and recruit proteins _PROTEIN_ such as coat proteins and tethers to establish a unique but transient _LOCATION_ identity . our objective in selecting several _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as baits for affinity purification was to capture some of the transient trafficking events associated with the tgn and not to characterize a steady state composition which has been established by groen et al . . of all our baits the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments showed the greatest similarity to the tgn proteomes identified using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ affinity purifications by . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized throughout the tgn and ee in punctate structures that are sensitive to bfa and is labeled with and colocalizes with vha . of the proteins we assigned to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments proteins were common to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and to vha _METHOD_ enrichments . we did not identify vha in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment but did identify another vha a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ this protein was also identified in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ affinity purifications . surprisingly there was substantial overlap between our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment did not contain _PROTEIN_ but did contain _PROTEIN_ possibly supporting separate roles for these two _PROTEIN_ proteins as reported by . our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments showed an overlap of proteins that were identified in vha _METHOD_ affinity enrichments by groen et al . including vha _PROTEIN_ . vha a was also identified in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments by drakakaki et al . and our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment had an overlap of with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteome . that we did not identify _PROTEIN_ in any of our seven affinity enrichments could suggest distinctness of the proteomes associated with each bait . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ associated proteins were the most numerous and diverse of any of our enrichments suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might have a general role in ee/tgn and _PROTEIN_ trafficking . we identified many proteins that regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ function in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments . all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have a hydrophobic _LOCATION_ association modification typically prenylation and as _LOCATION_ association is a prerequisite for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activation by exchange of gdp for _PROTEIN_ proteins that bind to this motif prevent the _PROTEIN_ from associating with the _LOCATION_ . therefore these regulatory proteins are known as gdp dissociation inhibitors _PROTEIN_ . we identified _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments . for a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to associate with a _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ must be removed by the action of a _PROTEIN_ dissociation _PROTEIN_ . the homologs of yeast gdfs in a. thaliana are the ypt interacting protein and prenylated rab _PROTEIN_ acceptor family . we identified _PROTEIN_ with both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not identified in either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or vha _METHOD_ proteomes as expected for a protein that associated with the cytoplasmic complex of a _PROTEIN_ . the and yip proteins were identified in previously characterized tgn proteomes . _PROTEIN_ are poor _PROTEIN_ and their activity at _LOCATION_ surfaces is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activating proteins that facilitate nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis . we identified _PROTEIN_ the activating gef for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is well characterized in yeast two hybrid assays and by coimmunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ proteins and the structure of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex has been solved . in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enriched proteins we identified one core transport protein particle subunit i component _PROTEIN_ . there are two distinct trapp complexes in animal cells trappi and trappii and in yeast the trappi complex is gef to the _PROTEIN_ homologue . due to their coenrichment we suggest that the trappi may also be a gef for _PROTEIN_ . trapp components were identified in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ proteomes but _PROTEIN_ was not . we identified four other gefs of the adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ family in both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments specifically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these four gefs can be all be inhibited by bfa and are associated with coated vesicle formation . the best known plant arf gef is _PROTEIN_ due to its regulation of auxin transporter _PROTEIN_ recycling and partial colocalization with and . _PROTEIN_ has recently been shown to be primarily localized to the _LOCATION_ and to regulate tgn structure . bfa treatment _METHOD_ to pull the _LOCATION_ into a body that is surrounded by tgn and this is consistent with recent work disambiguating tgn structure and suggests that _PROTEIN_ influence on _PROTEIN_ localization is indirect . less is known about the functions of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has a role in plant immunity and _PROTEIN_ trafficking at the tgn/ee . of these four arf gefs only _PROTEIN_ was previously identified in the vha _METHOD_ affinity purification . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ regulate compartment identity by recruiting intramembrane tethers and snare proteins which promote the direct fusion of _LOCATION_ once tethering _PROTEIN_ have brought them into close contact reviewed in . the combinations of _PROTEIN_ tethers and snare proteins dictate the interactions a compartment can make and are further regulated by snare attachment proteins and proteins . we identified tether proteins and complexes with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits including conserved oligomeric _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ associated retrograde protein and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and garp are both multisubunit complexes of the complex associated with tethering containing helical rods group of long tethers and are known to be effectors of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these complexes were not identified in previous proteomic analyses of the tgn . in yeast the _PROTEIN_ complex coordinates retrograde _LOCATION_ traffic and interacts with _PROTEIN_ snare and _LOCATION_ proteins . in plants homologues of the _PROTEIN_ complex have been predicted on the basis of sequence similarly but there is little experimental evidence for the function and location of this complex in a. thaliana . we identified five of the eight putative _PROTEIN_ subunits with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunit has recently been shown to recruit the exocyst subunit _PROTEIN_ to punctate structures at cortical microtubules during xylem formation . the putative _PROTEIN_ subunit _PROTEIN_ has also been annotated as a possible garp complex subunit . we have placed _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ group of table iii but it could equally belong to the garp complex . the primary role of the tetrameric garp complex is in the reception of endosome derived vesicles at the tgn . garp is a highly conserved complex consisting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunits . in yeast the subunit interacts with _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is the homologous group in a. thaliana . we identify the subunit with five of our affinity enrichments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whereas the other three garp components appear to have a more limited distribution . we suggest that might be the _PROTEIN_ interacting component of the garp complex in plants . has recently been shown to interact directly with and to colocalize with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a. thaliana contains three putative homologues and the identification of with the other three garp subunits in our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments further supports pahari et al . notably is not significantly enriched with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but another putative homologue _PROTEIN_ is . to the best of our knowledge there are no comparable published proteomes to our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichments . analysis of these proteomes should help elucidate the biological _METHOD_ of transition from _PROTEIN_ labeled _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ labeled _PROTEIN_ . furthermore proteins of our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments did not overlap with tgn associated proteomes . these four baits have many proteins in common and represent the _PROTEIN_ endosomes to the _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ . one striking observation is that the proteomes of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are very but not significantly similar with an overlap of proteins . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteome is much smaller than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with just proteins not seen in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and only eight proteins are unique to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these eight proteins are _PROTEIN_ two arm repeat family proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ two chloroplast associated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and three enzymes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ regulator _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified with both baits but only passed our significance test with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . an important difference between the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ endosomes is the presence of numerous tgn/ee localized proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and many long tether complexes in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichments . that the proteins identified with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are nearly a subset of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is in accordance with observations that _PROTEIN_ endosome populations mature into the _PROTEIN_ endosomes . despite the similarities in their associated proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labeled _PROTEIN_ are distinct . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are more susceptible to application of the drug bfa than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ colocalizes to a greater extent with the snare _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ colocalizes to a greater extent with the snares _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the bfa sensitive arf gefs and _PROTEIN_ were significantly enriched with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . an alternative explanation for some of the differences between our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enrichments might be due to the _PROTEIN_ level of these constructs or in their relative efficiency in binding to the affinity _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment contained proteins and has an overlap of proteins with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ identified proteins and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits share and proteins respectively with this enrichment . the greatest diversity of _PROTEIN_ proteins was identified with _PROTEIN_ enrichments but only two of the five arf gefs were identified in total . other _PROTEIN_ proteins identified with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ included members of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ families . the _PROTEIN_ dissociation inhibitors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were abundantly represented with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bait and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was the only bait to enrich for _PROTEIN_ . forty one other proteins were specific to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteome . the _PROTEIN_ is characterized by luminal vesicles that are formed by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport _PROTEIN_ complex . we did not identify any core _PROTEIN_ components with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments but the _PROTEIN_ that promotes the disassembly of the _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ was identified with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits . two components of the retromer complex were identified only with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the retromer recycles _LOCATION_ sorting receptors back to the _LOCATION_ . zelaznya et al . demonstrated that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . the retromer consist of two subcomplexes _PROTEIN_ and a sortin nexin . we did not identify or _PROTEIN_ in any enrichment but we did identify _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which is known to colocalize with them . in addition two cargo recognition _LOCATION_ sorting receptors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment only and _PROTEIN_ was identified with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ baits . these vsrs are involved with sorting cargo from the tgn to the lytic _LOCATION_ and to the seed protein storage _LOCATION_ . our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment contains proteins of which are unique to _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we identified only two snare proteins in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enrichment _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these three proteins can not form a partial snare complex as both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both r snares . _PROTEIN_ is however a known interaction partner of _PROTEIN_ and may function as an interfering snare . of particular interest is the identification of _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteome this gef has been implicated in regulating the exit of _LOCATION_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ . it may be that the _LOCATION_ represents another localization for _PROTEIN_ . to verify that copurifying proteins are present at the compartments affinity purified with our baits we monitored the subcellular localization of some of the identified proteins using confocal microscopy . we focused on the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteomes and selected proteins for further study as they are believed to regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ function through removing the inhibitory _PROTEIN_ although direct evidence is lacking in plants . in a. thaliana the family has expanded to include members and their subcellular localizations are thought be varied . we identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteomes whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in the _METHOD_ proteome only . by contrast no spectrum counts matching peptides for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified in any of our proteomes although it belongs to the same protein family as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these observations suggest distinct localization patterns among the proteins of the same family . using live cell imaging we observed partial colocalization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ with both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ respectively . additionally _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present at some compartments that were not positive for _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showing _PROTEIN_ has a wider subcellular localization to both _LOCATION_ and endosomes . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was predominantly colocalized with _METHOD_ in agreement with predictions from our proteomic analysis . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be closely associated with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive compartments while not exhibiting strong colocalization which is consistent that this protein was not identified in our endomembrane proteomes . all these observations corroborate the findings from our proteome analysis and demonstrate that our data can be used to predict the localization of a protein within the cell . in contradiction to our results that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not colocalize a previous study reports colocalization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this is likely to be due to the differences in the _METHOD_ used for _PROTEIN_ .
