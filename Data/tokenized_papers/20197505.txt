the nadh dehydrogenase complex of the respiratory chain has unique features in plants . it is the _PROTEIN_ entrance site for electrons into the respiratory electron transfer chain has a role in _PROTEIN_ the redox balance of the entire plant cell and additionally comprises enzymatic side activities essential for other metabolic pathways . here we present a proteomic investigation to elucidate its internal structure . arabidopsis thaliana complex i was purified by a gentle biochemical procedure that includes a cytochrome c mediated depletion of other respiratory protein complexes . to examine its internal subunit arrangement isolated complex i was dissected into subcomplexes . controlled disassembly of the holo complex by low concentration _PROTEIN_ treatment produced subcomplexes of and kd . systematic analyses of subunit composition by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gave insights into subunit arrangement within complex i . overall arabidopsis complex i includes at least subunits of which are unique to plants . subunits form subcomplexes analogous to the known functional modules of complex i from heterotrophic eukaryotes but also additional modules most notably an kd domain including type _PROTEIN_ anhydrases . based on topological information for many of its subunits we present a model of the internal architecture of plant complex i .
biochemical analysis of the subunit arrangement within complex i first requires its gentle purification in the native conformation . a new three step purification strategy was developed for complex i isolation based on purification of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ separation of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein complexes by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and finally cytochrome c affinity chromatography to remove complex iii and complex iii containing supercomplexes from complex i enriched fractions . the outcome of each purification step can be monitored by one dimensional bn _PROTEIN_ . the starting point for the complex i purification was mitochondria isolated from arabidopsis cell suspension cultures . the organelle fraction included all five oxphos complexes the i supercomplex and the part of complex v . since complex i is the largest enzyme of the oxphos system a size based separation by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was employed to separate the solubilized complexes of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . under the conditions applied complex i enriched fractions were located close the bottom of the centrifugation tube . the only visible contaminations within theses fractions were dimeric complex iii and the i supercomplex . finally cytochrome c affinity chromatography was applied to specifically remove complex and the i supercomplex from complex i enriched fractions . originally this procedure was developed to purify complex by the binding to its natural substrate cytochrome c . binding of complex is most efficient if cytochrome c is in the oxidized state . upon reduction of cytochrome c by ascorbate affinity _PROTEIN_ and allows elution of complex iii by a salt gradient of low ionic strength . no salt gradient is necessary to detach complex i from the cytochrome c sepharose because it simply passes through the column without interactions and therefore can be obtained in the flow through fraction . low salt conditions during purification ensure optimal integrity and native conformation of complex i . to obtain information on subunit localizations within complex i the isolated protein complex was destabilized using defined biochemical conditions to generate complex i subcomplexes and finally analyze their subunit composition . several destabilization conditions were tested such as temperature urea and detergent treatment or mild proteolysis . results of experiments were monitored by bn _PROTEIN_ . many conditions allowed dissecting complex i into a large _LOCATION_ arm of kd and a kd subcomplex that represents the peripheral arm . dissection of isolated complex i from arabidopsis into subcomplexes of similar sizes was previously reported by the use of two dimensional bn/bn _PROTEIN_ if digitonin used for solubilization is replaced by dodecylmaltoside during the electrophoresis run of the second native gel dimension . however slightly harsher conditions than these destabilization treatments consistently caused complete disassembly of complex i into its subunits . we finally tested destabilization of isolated complex i by treatment with _PROTEIN_ at very low concentrations . indeed several additional complex i subcomplexes became visible upon analysis by bn _PROTEIN_ and subsequent _METHOD_ blue or nadh activity staining . treatment of complex i with only _PROTEIN_ caused its partial dissociation into the and kd subcomplexes . also the molecular _METHOD_ of the holocomplex is slightly reduced by kd in the presence of _PROTEIN_ indicating loss of a few individual subunits . increase of the _PROTEIN_ concentration to and up to generates further subcomplexes of and kd all of which can oxidize nadh as monitored by an in gel activity assay . therefore they were considered to represent subcomplexes of the peripheral arm which is known to include the nadh oxidation domain of complex i . bn/sds _PROTEIN_ analyses were performed to further examine _PROTEIN_ induced subcomplex generation . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ the subunits of the complex i holoenzyme form a vertical row of spots in the kd gel region . treatment of intact complex i with _PROTEIN_ leads to its partial dissection into the and kd complexes which clearly are composed of distinct subunits . further increase of the _PROTEIN_ concentration to leads to the generation of several additional subcomplexes which are separated into vertical rows of subunits upon analysis by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ . besides the nadh oxidizing and kd subcomplexes detected on bn gels further subcomplexes are visible at and kd . subunits of complex i subcomplexes resolved by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ were systematically identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to determine the protein composition of the subcomplexes . overall gel spots were analyzed representing different complex i subunits and a few contaminating proteins like prohibitin the subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase ser hydroxymethyltransferase and lipoamide dehydrogenase . protein determinations revealed that the and kd subcomplexes are related to the _LOCATION_ arm and the and two kd subcomplexes to the peripheral arm . _METHOD_ based protein identifications gave insights into the subunit compositions of different complex i subcomplexes _LOCATION_ . proteins identified by _METHOD_ the kd subcomplex represents the entire peripheral arm . it includes at least subunits the so called kd kd kd kd kd tyky _PROTEIN_ psst and subunits the plant specific subunit _GENE_ and the previously not described arabidopsis complex i subunit _GENE_ which is homologous to the kd subunit of the bovine enzyme . the kd subcomplex represents the so called nadh oxidation module of the peripheral arm which previously was identified after ph and triton x induced destabilization of complex i isolated from e. coli . it is composed of at least four proteins the kd subunit which includes the nadh oxidation domain the kd subunit the kd subunit the subunit and/or the plant specific _GENE_ protein . the slightly smaller kd subcomplex comprises only the three core subunits of the n module namely the and kd subunits . and careful inspection of the gel in figure revealed that the kd subcomplex consists of two distinct comigrating subcomplexes termed and . assignment of subunits to the two subcomplexes is based on spot shape . subcomplex includes the and kd subunits . due to the presence of the nadh binding kd subunit it becomes visible upon in gel nadh staining like the and kd subcomplexes . the subcomplex includes subunits previously reported to form the so called q reduction module of the peripheral arm in e. coli . it is composed of the kd kd tyky psst and _PROTEIN_ subunits . the kd subcomplex represents the _LOCATION_ arm of arabidopsis complex i . it includes at least subunits of which are homologous to known subunits of the _LOCATION_ arm from bovine complex i _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . additionally the _LOCATION_ arm of arabidopsis complex i includes a bovine homolog known to be present in the peripheral arm the so called kd subunit _PROTEIN_ . thirteen further subunits of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ arm are plant specific proteins eight of which are rather small and hydrophobic . the five remaining plant specific subunits of the _LOCATION_ arm represent the ca subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the kd subcomplex is a subcomplex of the _LOCATION_ arm generated most efficiently at a slightly higher _PROTEIN_ concentration . the subunit composition resembles the one of the kd complex but it lacks all five ca subunits and some of the smaller subunits of the _LOCATION_ arm . and the and kd subcomplexes represent smaller _METHOD_ of the kd subcomplex that lack so far unknown subunits . the kd subcomplex includes the subunit the _PROTEIN_ subunit and/or _GENE_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ subunit and/or _GENE_ . finally an kd subcomplex includes the ca subunits present within plant complex i the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . slightly differing horizontal positions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins with respect to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits indicate that they might not be simultaneously present within individual ca subcomplexes . the _PROTEIN_ which is associated to complex i in plants and the so called kd subunit were identified as separate proteins on bn/sds gels which do not form part of complex i subcomplexes upon _PROTEIN_ treatment of any concentration and therefore are assumed to be either peripherically localized or at the interphase of the _LOCATION_ and the peripheral arm . elucidation of subunit compositions of complex i subcomplexes allows us to deduce a model of internal subunit arrangement within plant complex i as discussed below .
