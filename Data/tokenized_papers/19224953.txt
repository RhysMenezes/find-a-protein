the fragile _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene was previously shown to be required for the biosynthesis of the reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ a close homolog of _PROTEIN_ is a functional paralog of _PROTEIN_ involved in gx biosynthesis . the _PROTEIN_ gene is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in xylem cells in which the secondary walls contain an abundant amount of gx and the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to the _LOCATION_ where gx is synthesized . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant completely complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes including the secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of fibers and vessels vessel morphology gx content and the abundance of the reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence of gx indicating that _PROTEIN_ shares the same biochemical function as _PROTEIN_ . although the mutant alone did not show any detectable cell wall defects the double mutant exhibits an additional reduction in cell wall xylose level a more severe deformation of vessels and an extreme retardation in plant growth compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . together our findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functional paralogs and that they function redundantly in gx biosynthesis during secondary wall formation in the xylem .
it was previously reported that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene has three homologs i.e . _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ in the arabidopsis genome . _GENE_ and _GENE_ are close homologs of tobacco which is a putative pectin _PROTEIN_ that catalyzes the transfer of _PROTEIN_ acid onto rhamnogalacturonan ii . _GENE_ is the closest homolog of _PROTEIN_ and its deduced amino acid sequence shares similarity and identity with _PROTEIN_ therefore we designated it as _PROTEIN_ . to examine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene we first analyzed its _PROTEIN_ level in various organs and laser microdissected cells from the inflorescence _METHOD_ . real time quantitative pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined albeit at different levels and it was highly _PROTEIN_ in the xylem cells but not in the pith and interfascicular fiber cells in the _METHOD_ . we next used the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene to investigate the tissue level _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the seedlings and inflorescence _METHOD_ . to ensure that the _PROTEIN_ sequence used contains all the cis elements required for endogenous gene _PROTEIN_ a kb upstream sequence the entire exon and intron region and a kb downstream sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene were included . the gus reporter gene was inserted right before the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene in a binary vector to create the _PROTEIN_ gus construct . examination of the gus activity in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in vascular strands with close association with xylem cells in leaf blades petioles and roots . in elongating and non elongating inflorescence _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in xylem cells with little _PROTEIN_ in interfascicular fiber cells which is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ data in the dissected cells . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in xylem cells but not in interfascicular fibers . in addition to xylem cells _PROTEIN_ is also highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells which develop secondary walls during their maturation . sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ using the program for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a type ii _LOCATION_ protein containing a short cytoplasmic n terminus followed by a single transmembrane helix and a long non cytoplasmic c terminus . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we co _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ with a cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in carrot cells . it was found that although the _METHOD_ protein alone was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is a close homolog of _PROTEIN_ and it is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in xylem cells prompted us to test whether _PROTEIN_ is a functional paralog of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate its ability to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ under the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the presence of the _PROTEIN_ transgene and its overexpression was confirmed in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . it was previously shown that the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited a small plant size and weak stem strength which were accompanied by a reduction in secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ and a deformation of vessels . examination of the transgenic plants in their first generation revealed that among independent lines of them had a wild type plant size and their stem mechanical strength was similar to that of the wide type indicating that _PROTEIN_ can functionally complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we next examined the secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of vessels and fibers and the morphology of vessels in the transgenic lines . it was found that the wall _PROTEIN_ of interfascicular fibers xylary fibers and vessels in the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants was restored to a level similar to that of the wild type . the wall _PROTEIN_ of xylary fibers and vessels in the roots of the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants was also nearly identical to that of the wild type . in addition the vessels in the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants had regular shapes like those in the wild type . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ overexpression rescues the secondary wall defects caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation and thus restores the stem mechanical strength . the reduced secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and deformed vessel phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were a result of a reduction in the amount of gx and cellulose . to ascertain whether the rescue of the secondary wall defects by _PROTEIN_ overexpression is due to a restoration of the gx and cellulose content we analyzed the monosaccharide composition of cell walls isolated from the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . it was found that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ completely restored the amount of xylose and _PROTEIN_ to the wild type level . the restoration in the gx content was further confirmed by immunodetection of gx using a xylan monoclonal antibody showing that the gx signals in the walls of fibers and vessels in both _METHOD_ and roots of the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants are similar to those of the wild type . it was noted that although the vessels in the roots of the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants all showed strong gx signals some of them were still deformed indicating that the secondary wall strength in the root vessels is not completely restored . this lack of complete rescue of the root vessel morphology is probably due to a weak _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the camv promoter in root vessels . the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in a loss of the d glca side chains in gx and a severe reduction in the abundance of the gx reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence . the latter is considered to be the cause of the impaired gx biosynthesis in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression can complement the structural defects in gx caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation we analyzed the structure of gx isolated from the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . the koh solubilized gx was digested with endoxylanase and the acidic xylooligosaccharides produced by the digestion were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . it was found that although the acidic xylooligosacchrides from _PROTEIN_ contained only the ion peak at _METHOD_ to charge ratios of which is attributed to xylooligosaccharides with four xyl residues substituted with one o me d glca those from the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ showed an additional ion peak with an m/z of that is attributed to xylotetrasaccharides substituted with one non methylated d glca a spectrum identical to that of the wild type . the maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ overexpression rescues the loss of d glca side chains in gx caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the acidic xylooligosaccharides produced from the xylanase digestion of gx were further analyzed for the gx reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence using _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance _METHOD_ . the resonances that are assigned to the gx reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence d xyl l rha d gala d xyl include of d gala of l rha of linked d xyl of d gala and of l rha . it was found that although the resonances for the gx reducing end tetrasaccharide were nearly absent in the nmr spectrum of _PROTEIN_ gx they were restored to the wild type level in the gx from the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . consistent with the maldi tof _METHOD_ results showing that _PROTEIN_ overexpression restores the d glca side chains in gx the resonances assigned to and of d glca and of branched d xyl residues bearing an d glca residue which were absent in _PROTEIN_ were restored to the wild type level in the _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the same biochemical function as _PROTEIN_ in their involvement in gx biosynthesis . because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in xylem cells it is possible that they function redundantly in the biosynthesis of secondary walls in xylem cells . to test this hypothesis we generated a double mutant of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a t dna insertion mutation of _PROTEIN_ which disrupts the _PROTEIN_ signature motif of _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit any defects in plant stem strength and secondary wall _PROTEIN_ . however double mutations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ result in a severe retardation in plant growth . the rosette size of week old double mutant plants was much smaller than that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the double mutant plants did not bolt and remained the same size after weeks of growth when the wild type plants reached adult stage or even after months of growth . examination of xylem cells in the leaf petioles revealed that whereas the vessels in the wild type had regular shapes and those in _PROTEIN_ were deformed but clearly discernible the vessels in the double mutant were so severely collapsed that they were hardly recognizable . similarly the vessels in the roots of the double mutant were also severely collapsed . monosaccharide composition analysis of cell walls extracted from the leaves showed that the double mutant had a further reduction in xylose content compared with _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function redundantly in the biosynthesis of secondary walls in vessels .
