chloroplast division involves the tubulin related _PROTEIN_ ftsz that assembles into a _PROTEIN_ structure _PROTEIN_ at the mid chloroplast division site which is where invagination and constriction of the envelope _LOCATION_ occur . z _PROTEIN_ assembly is usually confined to the mid chloroplast site by a well balanced counteraction of the stromal proteins _PROTEIN_ and mine . the in vivo _METHOD_ by which ftsz nucleates at specific sites polymerises into a protofil ament and organises a closed _PROTEIN_ of filament bundles remain largely unknown . to clarify the dynamic aspects of ftsz we developed a living cell system for simultaneous visualisation of various ftsz configurations utilising the arabidopsis thaliana overexpressor and mutant of the mine _PROTEIN_ gene which were modified to weakly _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to . time lapse observation in the chloroplasts of both plants revealed disorderly movement of the dots and short filaments of ftsz . the short filaments often appeared to emanate from the dots and to converge with a long filament producing a _PROTEIN_ cable . in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor we also observed spirals along the longitudinal axis of the organelle that often rolled the closed _PROTEIN_ together . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we visualised the isolated _PROTEIN_ with a maximum diameter of that did not encircle the organelle periphery but appeared to be suspended in the stroma . our observations further demonstrated heterogeneity in chloroplast shapes and concurrently altered configurations of ftsz in the mutant .
whilst _METHOD_ labelling is generally advantageous in visualising the spatio temporal regulation of molecules of interest in living cells the overexpression of an ftsz _METHOD_ transgene causes an unwanted inhibitory effect on normal chloroplast division that is possibly due to a stoichiometric imbalance between ftsz and its interacting proteins and/or between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ staining of fixed plant cells was preferably used for ftsz intrachloro plastic localisation in most studies . in a recent study we generated transgenic a. thaliana plants which moderately _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene under the control of an upstream genomic sequence of but displayed sufficient _METHOD_ signals without an apparent inhibition of normal chloroplast division . we chose to make our observations in petioles because a gradient of chloroplast development can be readily observed along the elongation axis in petioles enabling us to associate chloroplast division with leaf development . in the current study we used a red shifted excitation/emission filter set which is normally used for yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ observation . we found that this modification reduced background _METHOD_ derived from chlorophyll and the cell wall . the time available for obtaining time lapse images upon _METHOD_ observation was extended at the cost of signal gain . under these conditions we observed chloroplast morphology and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation in the petioles of the transgenic lines that had moderately _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or strongly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox line was previously obtained during the screening process of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . in the cortical cells of the leaf petioles _METHOD_ signals appeared as _PROTEIN_ like formations at the midpoint of dividing chloroplasts in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line whilst in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox line the _METHOD_ signals appeared as unorganised networks or randomly oriented _PROTEIN_ bands within enlarged chloroplasts . a comparison of the signal intensities through the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ channel between the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line and the wild type plant suggested the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ diffusion signals throughout the chloroplasts in addition to the z _PROTEIN_ as noted previously . the z _PROTEIN_ were efficiently detected in the small sized _LOCATION_ or immature chloroplasts of the epidermal pavement cells in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line demonstrating the utility of this line for z _PROTEIN_ observation in various tissues . _LOCATION_ encircling distorted loops of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed with high _METHOD_ intensity in the trichomes of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox line . this suggests various cell specific effects from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression such as disorganised networks in the petiole cortex and pavement cells or _PROTEIN_ distorted loops in the trichomes . immunoblotting using the anti _METHOD_ antibody confirmed that the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox line was higher than in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . however the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may only differ slightly between the two lines according to the signal intensities of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bands which implies that the chloroplast division machinery only works properly when the _PROTEIN_ level is within a narrow permissible range . the results of immunoblotting also confirmed that the _METHOD_ signals from the two transgenic lines were derived from intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins and not from degraded _METHOD_ pieces of the fusions . _PROTEIN_ is an a. thaliana homologue of the eubacterial topological specificity _PROTEIN_ mine . previous studies demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is localised within chloroplasts and that either the overexpression repression or insertional mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene leads to the generation of enlarged chloroplasts and a _PROTEIN_ number of chloroplasts per cell although the chloroplast morphology is different amongst the three derived plant types . in taking advantage of the large sized chloroplasts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ and overexpressor _PROTEIN_ plants we intended to establish a cellular system suitable for live imaging of ftsz dynamics . we previously introduced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene into both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants by crossing them with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line and utilised the two resultant lines for the above mentioned purpose . in all of the experiments described below the chloroplasts in the first layer of the cortical cells on the adaxial side of the leaf petiole were observed in these lines unless otherwise specified . we newly found ftsz dots within multiple dividing chloroplasts in the _PROTEIN_ plant this was in addition to the multiple _PROTEIN_ and straying thin filaments that were previously reported . the ftsz dots appeared to be either separate or adjacent to the z _PROTEIN_ . individual ftsz dots moved around in an undirected manner but the movement seemed to be substantially different from typical brownian motion . distinct ftsz dots or somewhat amorphous structures were also frequently observed in the middle of the ftsz filaments . in addition ftsz dots were occasionally located at the end of ftsz filaments as if the filaments emanated from or terminated at the dots . we hypothesised that the terminal ftsz dots may be starting points for ftsz filament elongation but not ending points because we observed a short ftsz filament that originated from a terminal dot converge with a long ftsz filament and produce an obviously _PROTEIN_ bundled subregion within the long filament . it might be possible that such the dot like nucleators of ftsz filaments could be integrated but masked in the closed z _PROTEIN_ in wild type chloroplasts . the waggling motion of the terminal dot and the dot attached end of the short filament without movement of the bundled subregion of the filaments indicates that the dot was anchored by the bundled subregion of the ftsz filaments and that the short and long filaments were physically tied and not simply coaligned parallel to one another . although spiral like _METHOD_ of ftsz in chloroplasts have been reported for wild type plants transgenic plants and mutants no conclusive evidence has demonstrated that the observed ftsz structures were continuous spirals . the structures may be made up of a collection of multiple closed _PROTEIN_ and unclosed filaments . through careful observations on individual chloroplasts in the _PROTEIN_ plant with a shift in the focal plane along the z axis we reconstituted the bona fide continuous spirals of ftsz . the ftsz spirals often rolled the closed _PROTEIN_ together and a single chloroplast sometimes contained two or more spirals or a separate closed _PROTEIN_ and a spiral together . ftsz spirals that were similar to those observed in _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts also appeared in the chloroplasts of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant which is a loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutant . additionally multiple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dots and short filaments of ftsz were observed . the ftsz spirals in the _PROTEIN_ plant clearly differ from the spiral like _METHOD_ observed in the giant chloroplasts of the _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutants of a. thaliana . that is the spirals in _PROTEIN_ were regularly formed along and throughout the longitudinal axis of the chloroplasts with a relatively constant pitch surrounding the organelle periphery . this is in contrast to the relatively disorganised spirals in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants and the centrally biased spirals with narrower and less steady pitches in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutants . these differences between _PROTEIN_ and the other mutants/transgenics in the spiral configurations of ftsz might reflect site differences whereby normal chloroplast division control is disturbed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and all constitute the chloroplast division machinery in the stroma inner envelope _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ outer envelope _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ surface of the organelle _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is currently considered not to be a part of the division machinery but is involved in the confinement of the division machinery assembly site in the mid chloroplast in co operation with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore ftsz spirals in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant resemble those in _PROTEIN_ . this similarity in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ftsz configurations is consistent with the proposed model in which _PROTEIN_ counteracts _PROTEIN_ to specify a single midpoint at which z _PROTEIN_ are allowed to form . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or the dysfunction of _PROTEIN_ probably fails to compress the ftsz spiral into the mid chloroplast zone which might result in the formation of loosely expanded spirals instead of the centrally compressed spirals seen in division machinery protein mutants . vitha et al . observed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ filaments that spiralled off the central z _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ dividing chloroplasts of wild type a. thaliana by means of _METHOD_ microscopy . such ftsz filament spiralling likely represents an intrinsic intermediary state during the _PROTEIN_ stage of chloroplast division in which twisted ftsz filaments join with the central z _PROTEIN_ or excess ftsz filaments unwind from the shrinking z _PROTEIN_ . we favour the former explanation because of the bundling nature of ftsz filaments that we inferred from fig . . in addition the spiral like configurations of _LOCATION_ ftsz were observed in logarithmically proliferating cells from a tobacco by which further implies that the ftsz spiral is a transitional structure that is finally converted into functional closed z _PROTEIN_ . ftsz spirals that rolled the closed _PROTEIN_ together like in _PROTEIN_ might be explained by such a conversion process . next we observed ftsz distribution in the chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ plants . in the giant chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ we could visualise isolated _PROTEIN_ of ftsz in addition to the previously reported dots and short filaments . in contrast to the z _PROTEIN_ observed in wild type and _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts these isolated _PROTEIN_ did not encircle the organelle periphery but appeared to be suspended in the stroma . the diameter of the isolated _PROTEIN_ was not more than and they had no apparent location preference with _PROTEIN_ to neighbouring ftsz configurations and chloroplast morphology . recently et al . reported the presence of tiny ftsz _PROTEIN_ and dots which appeared not to be associated with the chloroplast _LOCATION_ during the cell cycle of the green alga scenedesmus quadricauda . this implies that the isolated _PROTEIN_ and the dots of ftsz might play a certain role in the normal process of z _PROTEIN_ assembly and consequently chloroplast division . moreover co occurrence of the isolated _PROTEIN_ and the dots highlights the possibility that the dot might be an isolated _PROTEIN_ of minimal size in _PROTEIN_ which would appear as a filled body due to the limit of resolution . interestingly srinivasan et al . observed similar _PROTEIN_ of heterologously _PROTEIN_ escherichia coli ftsz _METHOD_ which had a diameter comparable to those observed in _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe . time lapse microscopy of _METHOD_ fused to which is a mutant ecftsz with a much weaker _PROTEIN_ activity revealed that the tiny _PROTEIN_ were formed from the linear bundles of ftsz filaments through a spooling like mechanism . the striking resemblance of the tiny ftsz _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts to those in the yeast cytoplasm suggests that chloroplast ftsz _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants can also be formed by a spooling process of the linear bundles . additionally our present data provide new evidence that chloroplast ftsz can organise into closed _PROTEIN_ through the steep curvature of filaments in the absence of a chloroplast division initiation _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ . time lapse observation of ftsz in _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts revealed disorderly movement or rather fluctuation of the ftsz dots and short filaments within a certain area at higher resolutions than in the previous study . location and emergence of the dots and short filaments also looked disorderly we found no regularities and preferences in their intra organelle locations and varying degrees of dot/filament ratios within each chloroplast even within the same tissue . short filaments in _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts were found in two basic locations one was seemingly suspended in the stroma and the other ran along the chloroplast periphery as if it were stuck on the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . the latter structure might visually resemble the ftsz arc which grew bidirectionally from a putative nucleation point to finally become a complete z _PROTEIN_ surrounding the division plane of e. coli cells and cyanelles of the glaucocystophyte cyanophora paradoxa . as is the case with _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts the ftsz movement in _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts appears to be distinct from brownian motion . the maximum apparent velocity of the dots in the observational x y plane was as estimated by tracking the time lapse images whilst the maximum velocities of the ends and midpoints of the short filaments were and respectively . note also that we frequently observed motionless dots and filaments . as a general rule the dots moved more frequently than the short filaments and the shorter the filament the more frequently it moved . the velocity range of the dots in the _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts was comparable to _PROTEIN_ . however the velocity range for the short filament ends in _PROTEIN_ was greater than in _PROTEIN_ although short filaments in motion that had their ends unfixed were rarely observed in _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts . the mobility of ftsz dots and short filaments and the presence of faint diffusion signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ throughout the stromal region suggested that the assembled ftsz structures might actively turn over swiftly exchanging subunits with the soluble pool of stromal ftsz . nevertheless at present whether the motility of ftsz structures in chloroplasts actually involves the assembly and disassembly of ftsz monomers is unknown . chloroplast observations in the leaf epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ plants highlighted unexpected heterogeneity in the distribution patterns of ftsz even within the same tissue . we recognised two distinct types of chloroplast morphology and at the same time an altered distribution of ftsz . one type was a giant chloroplast containing short filaments and multiple dots similar to those observed in the petioles of _PROTEIN_ and another type was a comparatively small and thin chloroplast containing multiple _PROTEIN_ or possible spiral similar to those observed in _PROTEIN_ . note that the occurrence of the latter type of chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ unexpectedly implies that _PROTEIN_ is dispensable in z _PROTEIN_ formation in leaf epidermal chloroplasts but not in mesophyll and petiole chloroplasts and therefore the tissue dependent operation of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ system . isolated ftsz _PROTEIN_ were found in largely expanded chloroplasts of the petiole but were not observed in poorly expanded chloroplasts of the leaf epidermis . the heterogeneity of chloroplast shapes along with the altered configurations of ftsz in leaf epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ plants might imply that the simple application of the bacterial min system model is not sufficient when explaining the complex modes of chloroplast division . in our previous report we proposed a hypothesis stating that the excessive expansion of chloroplast _LOCATION_ might inhibit the completion of z _PROTEIN_ mediated chloroplast division while it might not necessarily prevent the z _PROTEIN_ assembly per se . our hypothesis predicts that a population of heterogeneously sized chloroplasts would tend to split into two subpopulations smaller and larger chloroplasts . our results _PROTEIN_ the leaf epidermal cells in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are at least partially in accordance with that prediction . it was previously reported that overexpression of or in a. thaliana results in chloroplast size heterogeneity even within one cell in the bundle sheath or the mesophyll although this phenomenon was infrequent and uniformly enlarged chloroplasts were typically observed in most plants . in addition jeong et al . reported the similar chloroplast phenotype in transgenic tobacco plants in which was overexpressed these plants occasionally contained one gigantic chloroplast with several normal sized chloroplasts in mature cells . taken together there might be a hidden threshold in chloroplast size which determines whether organelle division is successfully completed . in the future comprehensive examinations of ftsz configurations within the _LOCATION_ at various differentiation and developmental states should be carried out in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and other a. thaliana mutants transgenics and the wild type . these examinations should provide us with more information concerning the assembly of the functional z _PROTEIN_ and their intermediary structures which are presumably the ftsz dots short filaments and spirals upon _LOCATION_ division .
