arabidopsis thaliana possesses six branched chain aminotransferases . previous studies revealed that some members of this protein family are involved in the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids and/or in the met chain elongation pathway the initial steps towards the biosynthesis of met derived _PROTEIN_ . we now analyzed branched chain aminotransferase . in vivo _METHOD_ tagging experiments strongly suggest this enzyme to be localized to the _LOCATION_ . substrate specificity assays performed with recombinant enzyme revealed that transaminates val leu and ile as well as the corresponding oxo acids but also transaminates met and its cognate ketoacid methyl oxobutanoate . we established single double _PROTEIN_ and triple _PROTEIN_ mutants involving with the latter exhibiting a clear macroscopic phenotype with smaller plants and abnormal leaf morphology . metabolite profiling of these mutants demonstrated that can contribute to met chain elongation with the triple mutant line lacking _PROTEIN_ and showing a dramatic reduction of met derived _PROTEIN_ species down to and of wild type levels in plant foliage and seeds respectively . this drop in _PROTEIN_ levels is accompanied by a fold increase of free met demonstrating the important role of the three branched chain aminotransferases in converting met to its oxo acid for _PROTEIN_ chain elongation . in addition we determined the relative amounts of deoxy methylthioadenosine an intermediate of the met recycling pathway . this metabolite accumulated to relative high amounts in the absence of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and suggesting that _LOCATION_ met salvage also contributes to the biosynthesis of _PROTEIN_ .
the subcellular localization of has not been previously studied but the enzyme has been assumed to be localized in the _LOCATION_ since it lacks potential n terminal extensions . to address this localization experimentally the complete reading frame was cloned in frame upstream or downstream of the gene encoding the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . these constructs were established in the vector and used for transient transformation of tobacco protoplasts . as expected the yellow _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ particularly with the construct in which the reading frame was fused to the c terminus of the _METHOD_ gene . with located upstream of the _METHOD_ gene localization was also observed in the _LOCATION_ but the _METHOD_ fusion protein might also slightly accumulate in the _LOCATION_ . to substantiate these results we designed another construct in which was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . this chimeric gene was established in the vector which allowed a stable introduction of the transgene via agrobacterium into arabidopsis . after selection of transformants several different plant lines were established and investigated by _METHOD_ microscopy . to this end individual cells were released from the rosette leaf tissue of d old plants . inspection of the protoplasts again revealed a diffuse distribution of the green _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ which is consistent with the results observed with the transiently _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . in both approaches _METHOD_ was never seen in chloroplasts mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . collectively these data strongly suggest a localization of in the _LOCATION_ . thus arabidopsis contains two _LOCATION_ bcats _PROTEIN_ which catalyzes the committed step in the methionine chain elongation pathway of _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis and . to get information about the substrate spectrum of we performed kinetic studies with recombinant protein and the three bcaas and met as well as the corresponding oxo acids . for all substrates except for methylthio oxobutanoate plotting of the reaction velocities and the substrate concentration revealed michaelis menten kinetics . km and vmax were calculated by fitting the data into non linear regression . generally higher km values were calculated for amino acids in comparison to their cognate oxo acids . all km values were in a range found in previous studies of bcats in arabidopsis and tomato . consistent with previous results obtained by yeast complementation assays converts all bcaas and their corresponding oxo acids to their respective transamination products . this substrate range clearly differentiates from _PROTEIN_ which lacks substantial activities with val ile and the corresponding oxo acids methyl oxobutanoate and methyl oxopentanoate . the highest affinity of was seen with ile and its oxo acid methyl oxopentanoate . in contrast to all other substrates investigated the reaction velocities measured with mtob did not exhibit classical michaelis menten kinetics . here activities increased to a maximum at mm substrate concentration but further elevation of the mtob concentration led to a _PROTEIN_ of activity . in any case both met and mtob are substrates of consistent with the generally promiscuous character of branched chain aminotransferases in plants . to evaluate the biological role of in vivo we established three t dna knockout mutants . two of these mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were in the wassilewskija _LOCATION_ background whereas one t dna insertion line was generated in the accession columbia . by pcr analysis and sequencing of the corresponding products the localization of the t dna was confirmed at the end of the second exon or in intron . an rt pcr analysis with oligonucleotides flanking the insertion confirmed the knockout of in these lines . the macroscopic phenotypes of all of these mutants were indistinguishable from wild type plants . for comparability with previous studies of other bcats from arabidopsis which were done in the col background we concentrated our studies on the line . profiling of free amino acids in did not reveal any significant changes from the wild type control both in leaves and in seeds except for trp which was slightly increased in the seeds . since in arabidopsis bcats might also have functions in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis we also measured these compounds . in leaves only minor _PROTEIN_ of methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate _METHOD_ and methylsulfinyloctylglucosinolate _METHOD_ were measured . in seeds benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate was slightly _PROTEIN_ but in contrast to leaves methylthioheptylglucosinolate methylthiooctylglucosinolate and methylsulfinyloctylglucosinolate were found to be moderately increased . in summary the moderate changes of and _PROTEIN_ species both in leaves and seeds suggest a participation in or at least an indirect influence of on the met chain elongation pathway . to investigate the effects of the knockout of both _LOCATION_ bcats we crossed the plants with the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . like the single mutants the macroscopic phenotype of the double knockout plants was indistinguishable from that of the col wild type . on the other hand a number of differences were seen between the metabolite profile of the _PROTEIN_ dko and that of col wild type as well as the single mutants . in leaves met ser val and s methylmethionine were increased in the dko . smm is synthesized from met and sam in a met sam methyltransferase catalyzed reaction . smm serves a methyl donor for the formation of met from homocysteine a reaction catalyzed by homocysteine s methyltransferase . met sam methyltransferase and homocysteine s methyltransferase form the smm cycle which controls the met sam balance . for met and smm elevations could be _PROTEIN_ attributed to the knockout of _PROTEIN_ although they were stronger in the _PROTEIN_ dko . on the other hand the significantly higher levels of val and ser in the dko most likely arose from an additive effect of both gene knockouts since the single mutants exhibited only insignificant increases of these amino acids . in seeds such an additive effect was seen for met and asn . a strikingly different pattern of change was seen for smm . this storage form of met was undetectable in the mutant and in wild type accumulated to about seed in _PROTEIN_ and was found at an amount three times higher in the _PROTEIN_ dko . cumulative effects on the levels of _PROTEIN_ were seen in the _PROTEIN_ dko . in leaves the total amount of met derived _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ to of wild type level _PROTEIN_ due to the reduction of the major leaf _PROTEIN_ species methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate _METHOD_ which is lowered to of wild type level . both total met derived _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were reduced to only and of wild type respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrating the enhancing effect of the knockout and also confirming the major role of _PROTEIN_ in the met elongation pathway . an intriguing influence on _PROTEIN_ concentrations was also seen in seeds . in the _PROTEIN_ dko the total amount of met derived _PROTEIN_ was reduced to approximately of the wild type control which is a further reduction with respect to _PROTEIN_ where this _PROTEIN_ group was lowered to only of control . the strong reduction in the dko is linked _PROTEIN_ to a reduction in methylthiobutylglucosinolate the predominant _PROTEIN_ species in seeds but also to other _PROTEIN_ that show stronger reductions in the dko than in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant methylsulfinylhexylglucosinolate _METHOD_ methylthioheptylglucosinolate and methylsulfinyloctylglucosinolate . strikingly methylsulfinylethylglucosinolate _METHOD_ a _PROTEIN_ species synthesized directly from met without chain elongation and methylhexylglucosinolate which derives from val or leu and not from met accumulate in the _PROTEIN_ dko . while _METHOD_ was not seen in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant methylhexylglucosinolate was found at reduced levels also in seeds of such plants . we also established a triple knockout mutant which in addition to and _PROTEIN_ contains the _PROTEIN_ knockout allele . these plants _PROTEIN_ exhibited a clear macroscopic phenotype with smaller rosettes and inflorescences in comparison to wild type . in addition there were dent like cavities and chlorotic areas in the leaves . in this tissue free amino acid profiling revealed that ala arg his ile phe pro thr trp and tyr showed moderately increased levels in comparison to the _PROTEIN_ dko or to the _PROTEIN_ single mutants . leu was found to be increased about twofold in the tko whereas val was significantly reduced in the triple mutant which is linked to the knockout of _PROTEIN_ and its role in the biosynthesis of this amino acid . most striking is the extraordinary enhanced accumulation of met which is at fold higher levels than in wild type and about eightfold higher than in the _PROTEIN_ dko or in the _PROTEIN_ plants . substantial changes were also seen in seeds where total free amino acids were doubled in comparison to all other lines investigated . the increase affected all amino acids and was found to be particularly strong in comparison to wild type for his ile thr arg and was accompanied by a _METHOD_ enrichment of smm . clear alterations in _PROTEIN_ levels were observed in the leaves of the tko mutant . the total amount of met derived _PROTEIN_ is threefold _PROTEIN_ with the most dramatic reduction seen for the major leaf _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which was lowered to of the wild type level . in contrast the levels of leu derived _PROTEIN_ were strikingly enhanced with methylhexylglucosinolate being extraordinarily enriched _PROTEIN_ . likewise strong effects were measured in seeds . in this tissue the level of total met derived _PROTEIN_ was down to of the wild type control the two major _PROTEIN_ species methylthiobutylglucosinolate and benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate being reduced to and of wild type respectively . slightly increased or unchanged amounts were detected for methylsulfinylpentylglucosinolate _METHOD_ methylthiopentylglucosinolate and _METHOD_ . the opposing trend found in the levels of these _PROTEIN_ species might be due to distinct substrate preferences in reactions of the second and third phase of _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . in addition the substrate preference of _PROTEIN_ transporter might influence the levels of individual compound in seeds . similar to leaves methylhexylglucosinolate was almost doubled in comparison to the _PROTEIN_ and to the _PROTEIN_ dko mutants whereas methylpentylglucosinolate was undetectable in this tissue . collectively these metabolite profiling data revealed that the knockout of in conjunction with the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ caused a dramatic increase in met content coupled with clear reductions in met derived _PROTEIN_ both in leaves and seeds . these deviations suggested that contributes to the biosynthesis of met derived _PROTEIN_ . among the branched chain amino acids only val was distinctively increased in the dko while in the tko val was present at levels even lower than in wild type . apart from amino acid and _PROTEIN_ profiling we used a lc esi triplequad _METHOD_ method employing an lc esi iontrap to search for other compounds that differed among the single double and triple mutants . in leaves of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single and the dko and especially in the tko we detected elongated leu derivatives . these amino acids were detected in about three to tenfold higher amounts in the tko than in any other line and trihomoleucine was found in the range of leu . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also contained considerable amounts of homo dihomo and trihomoleucine but only trace amounts of trihomoleucine were found in _PROTEIN_ and in the _PROTEIN_ dko . none of these abnormal leu derivatives was detectable in seeds . the relative levels of deoxy methylthioadenosine an intermediate of the met recycling pathway were highest in the leaves of the _PROTEIN_ single and the _PROTEIN_ dko . in seeds the highest relative amounts of were found in the tko with a fold increase observed relative to wild type levels . the double mutant also exhibited sevenfold increase whereas only moderate elevation were found in all single mutants maximally fold in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast is reduced in leaves of the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . besides we also found extremely enhanced levels of amino benzoyloxypentane in seeds of the _PROTEIN_ the dko and the tko . only very moderate increases were found in the and in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . was not detected in green tissues . considering the potential role of in _PROTEIN_ metabolism we used previously established arabidopsis lines containing promoter gus constructs to reinvestigate _PROTEIN_ of in different developmental stages carrying out histological staining in the presence of silwet top for increased sensitivity . studies of seedlings now revealed promoter activity in the central cylinder throughout the root and the hypocotyl with particularly strong staining in the root tip and at the upper end of the hypocotyl at the basis of the petioles of cotyledons where promoter activity was previously detected . in _PROTEIN_ developmental stages staining was now seen at the basis of petioles and in _PROTEIN_ . consistent with former studies promoter activity was seen in anthers and root tips whereas no promoter activity was detected in other parts of the leaves even after wounding . furthermore no staining was detectable in imbibed seeds . taken together promoter activity is restricted to seedling stages and to small regions of the adult plants .
