_PROTEIN_ is an ammonium transporter that is only distantly related to the five members of the _PROTEIN_ family of high affinity ammonium transporters in arabidopsis . the short lived radioactive was used to show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast is a high affinity transporter with a k m for ammonium of about . changes in external ph between and had little effect on the k m for ammonium indicating that not is the substrate for _PROTEIN_ . gene was _PROTEIN_ in all organs of arabidopsis and was subject to nitrogen regulation at least in roots where _PROTEIN_ was partially repressed by high concentrations of ammonium nitrate and derepressed in the absence of external n. although _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in shoots responded little to changes in root n status transcript levels in leaves declined under high _PROTEIN_ conditions . transient _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein in arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells indicated a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location for the _PROTEIN_ protein . thus _PROTEIN_ is likely to play a significant role in moving ammonium between the apoplast and symplast of cells throughout the plant . however a dramatic reduction in the level transcript brought about by dsrna interference with gene _PROTEIN_ had no obvious effect on plant growth or development under the conditions tested .
previous work showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in both roots and shoots of arabidopsis . to obtain more information about _PROTEIN_ in different organs northern blot analysis was performed using total rna isolated from _METHOD_ rosette leaves cauline leaves flowers and siliques of plants grown in soil for weeks . root rna was isolated from plants grown in axenic cultures for transcripts were detected in all organs examined . transcript levels were greatest in roots leaves and _METHOD_ and somewhat lower in flowers and siliques . in addition to the full length transcript a second shorter transcript of kb was detected in both root and stem rna . as the arabidopsis genome contains no other sequences that are closely related to _PROTEIN_ we suspected that the shorter transcript was also derived from _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this further we hybridized northern blots of total rna from roots or shoots with antisense riboprobes complementary to either the end of the _PROTEIN_ transcript or its end . the end probe hybridized to both a and a kb rna from roots whereas the end probe hybridized to the larger full transcript only . both probes hybridized to only a single kb transcript from leaves . thus the kb fragment in total rna from roots appeared to lack the first bp of the full length transcript . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is subject to n regulation northern blot analysis of plants grown under different n regimes was performed . plants were grown in axenic culture for d in modified murashige and skoog medium containing mm ammonium nitrate and mm potassium nitrate or for d in this medium followed by transfer to a similar medium lacking n for d. after n deprivation plants were transferred to fresh medium supplemented with mm nitrate for min or h to test the influence of nitrate on _PROTEIN_ . the amount of _PROTEIN_ transcript increased in roots in response to n deprivation as observed before . addition of nitrate to n deprived plants resulted in a slight _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in roots at and min although levels did not fall to those observed in ammonium nitrate grown plants . no differences in _PROTEIN_ levels were detected in shoots of plants subjected to the various treatments . once again roots contained both and kb _PROTEIN_ transcripts whereas shoots contained only the larger transcripts . photorespiration results in significant ammonium production in photosynthetic tissues in plants but can be suppressed by increasing the ratio of _PROTEIN_ to in the atmosphere . to test whether _PROTEIN_ may play a role in recycling of photorespiratory ammonium we performed a northern blot analysis of plants grown in the presence of high _PROTEIN_ . plants were grown in soil under ambient atmospheric conditions for weeks before being transferred to high _PROTEIN_ for a further weeks whereas control plants were kept under ambient _PROTEIN_ conditions for the entire period . the high _PROTEIN_ treatment resulted in a slight decline in _PROTEIN_ transcript level in leaves . to analyze _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with greater resolution than was possible with northern blots transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated that _PROTEIN_ the gus reporter gene under the control of kb of promoter . individuals of more than transgenic lines were analyzed . seedlings were grown in vitro in magenta boxes for weeks in murashige and skoog medium and all organs were analyzed for gus activity . gus activity was detected in the vascular tissues of leaves _METHOD_ roots and flowers . gus activity was also detected in root tips and in the root cortex but not the root epidermis . no gus activity was detected in siliques . initial characterization of _PROTEIN_ showed it to be an ammonium transporter that unlike _PROTEIN_ transporters can not transport the ammonium analog ma . the inability of _PROTEIN_ to transport ma is unfortunate because it precludes studies of transport kinetics using ma . thus to determine the transport characteristics of _PROTEIN_ we resorted to the use ammonium which has a half life of only min . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the yeast ammonium transport mutant which is defective in all three of its known ammonium transporters and does not possess nadph dependent glu dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ the principle enzyme of ammonia assimilation in yeast . furthermore mm l methionine sulfoximine was added to the cultures before the uptake assays to inhibit gln synthetase activity . yeast cells transformed with constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were able to take ammonium from the external medium . the same was true for cells _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis transporter _PROTEIN_ which was included as a positive control . _PROTEIN_ facilitated rapid influx ammonium with an apparentk m of at ph . although _PROTEIN_ also exhibited a high affinity for ammonium its capacity for ammonium transport was at least an order of magnitude lower than that of _PROTEIN_ at ph and . interestingly the apparent v max of _PROTEIN_ increased with increasing external ph whereas that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ so that at ph the transport capacity of the two transporters appeared to be similar . the yeast mutant containing the vector alone was unable to ammonium at either ph or . however significant rates of ammonium uptake were exhibited by this strain at ph which may be attributable to the diffusion of into the cells . kinetic data for ammonium uptake by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast although _METHOD_ evidence points toward a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location for some _PROTEIN_ family members no direct evidence for this has been published . to determine the intracellular location of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ reporter protein green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaves under the control of a double cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . to test the efficacy of this approach a variety of positive controls were included in our experiments . the control constructs were _METHOD_ _METHOD_ rbcs _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cox _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of rbcs _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of arabidopsis led to accumulation of _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . the cox _METHOD_ fusion protein was found in mitochondria of transformed cells which were smaller and clearly distinct from chloroplasts . the _METHOD_ protein was observed in the _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ without a leader sequence was located in the cytoplasm . transient _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in leaf epidermal cells invariably led to green _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ envelope . labeling of the latter may simply reflect the _PROTEIN_ that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are delivered via the _LOCATION_ which is contiguous with the _LOCATION_ envelope . we have observed this phenomenon for other _METHOD_ fusions that are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to gain further insight into the possible physiological role of _PROTEIN_ we used a reverse genetics approach using rna interference . a binary vector containing the entire _PROTEIN_ sequence and a kb fragment from the end of the coding sequence in a head to tail configuration was constructed and transformed into arabidopsis . seeds from transformed plants were selected on murashige and skoog plates containing kanamycin and resistant seedlings were transferred to soil . four weeks after germination rosette leaves from independent lines were harvested for northern blot analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . an antisense riboprobe specific to the part of gene was used for hybridization . the wild type transcript of _PROTEIN_ was undetectable in most of the rnai lines . instead of the kb transcript present in the wild type rnai lines exhibited an abundant kb rna fragment that was thought to represent the loop connecting the two complementary parts of the rna hairpin structure . this was confirmed with two other riboprobes . a sense probe identical to the loop sequence did not hybridize to the kb band as expected whereas an antisense probe specific to the part of the wild type _PROTEIN_ transcript hybridized to much smaller apparently degraded fragments . despite the absence of detectable _PROTEIN_ transcript in many of the rnai lines none of them exhibited aberrant growth or development under a variety of different growth conditions .
arabidopsis ecotype _PROTEIN_ was grown either in soil in a phytotron with an h day/night cycle at and humidity or in a tissue culture room at with continuous light . a modified murashige and skoog medium was used for growing the plants in axenic culture . rna was isolated from leaves roots and flowers using trizol reagent . for the rna isolation from _METHOD_ and siliques a detergent based isolation method was used . after separation of the rna by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions the rna was transferred to nylon _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and uv cross linked to the _LOCATION_ . blots were probed with either single strand rna or a double stranded dna probes as follows nylon _LOCATION_ were prehybridized for at least h at and hybridized overnight at in a solution consisting of formamide m sodium phosphate buffer m nacl mm edta _PROTEIN_ and utp labeled rna probe which was produced by in vitro transcription from linearized plasmid containing the cdna of interest . _LOCATION_ were washed at room temperature for min in ssc twice in pse buffer _PROTEIN_ twice in pes buffer _PROTEIN_ and three times in ssc at room temperature . the filters were treated with a in ssc for min at room temperature before being washed in ssc and _PROTEIN_ for min at and subjected to autoradiography or nylon _LOCATION_ were prehybridized for at least h at and hybridized overnight at in mm sodium phosphate buffer containing _PROTEIN_ bovine serum albumin and mm edta . radioactively labeled probe was prepared using the rediprime kit _METHOD_ . after hybridization _LOCATION_ were washed at once in ssc and _PROTEIN_ and twice in ssc and _PROTEIN_ then subjected to autoradiography . yeast strain was produced from strain by homologous recombination of the wild type _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ . a uracil auxotroph of strain was produced by homologous recombination of the gene _PROTEIN_ with a dysfunctional form of the gene produced by apai digestion klenow fill in and religation of which generated a frame shift mutation . strain was selected on media containing mg fluoroorotic acid and and _PROTEIN_ tested on uracil minus medium to confirm the loss gene function . yeast plasmid or _PROTEIN_ was transformed into and selected for uracil prototrophy and subsequently the ability to complement growth under ammonium limiting conditions . standard molecular methods were used throughout and yeast strains were transformed using the lithium acetate method as described by citation . for uptake experiments yeast strains were grown overnight in liquid cultures at to in a uracil and ammonia free media containing per liter yeast minimal salts without amino acids and without ammonia g of gal of na glu g of mes buffer g of synthetic amino acid powder lacking uracil and ph adjusted to with naoh . yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at for min and resuspended in freshly prepared media to a final a of to . to start reactions of cells was added to ml eppendorf tubes containing a fixed amount of ammonium and a variable amount to give a final ammonium concentration between and . after mixing of cells was loaded above a silicon oil layer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a thin walled polyethylene tube and reactions were terminated at the appropriate times by centrifugation at rpm for s . the cell pellet was then cut from the end of the tube and immediately measured in a gamma counter . uptake was considered stopped at the commencement of centrifugation and the fastest reaction times were typically s. all uptake measurements were independent replicates and were typically repeated three to five times with different batches of cells . in figure the _LOCATION_ bars represent confidence intervals and linear regressions were performed using sigmaplot software _PROTEIN_ . the short lived radioisotope was produced by proton irradiation of water according to the reaction . the cyclotron of forschungszentrum gmbh provides a proton beam . the irradiation procedure generates and only traces . for the chemical conversion of to ammonia and online clean up of the ammonia generated a special apparatus was designed to handle small amounts of the radioactive solutions . the process was initiated by reduction of devarda 's alloy under alkaline conditions . _PROTEIN_ produced was flushed by a stream of gas into a trap containing a solution of adjacent to a radiation detector . the ammonia labeled trapping solution was finally adjusted to ph . the purity of each sample was checked by gamma spectroscopy and measurements of the gamma emission decay times . thus decay can be readily distinguished from the possible contaminant . one kilobase pair of sequence upstream of the start codon of _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified using primers that introduced psti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and smai _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ restriction sites into the product . the product was digested with psti andsmai and cloned into . after sequence verification the promoter was subcloned as a psti/smai fragment upstream of the gus reporter gene in the binary vector pcambia . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed using a floral dip method and seeds were selected on murashige and skoog medium with suc containing hygromycin a . about transgenic seedlings were grown to maturity in soil and seeds were harvested . plants were then grown in vitro for weeks in magenta boxes on murashige and skoog medium . plants were harvested and the different organs were assayed for gus activity . plant organs were transferred to wells of microtiter plates filled with gus buffer mm edta triton x tween mg _PROTEIN_ mg _PROTEIN_ and mg bromo chloro indolyl _PROTEIN_ acid vacuum infiltrated and then incubated in the dark at for several hours to overnight . tissue was then destained in ethanol . using the primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the first bp of the coding sequence was amplified using pfudna polymerase then digested with the restriction enzymes cutting at the incorporated sites . the dna fragment was cloned into the respective restriction sites of the vector _METHOD_ to form a translational fusion between the n terminal of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . vectors were then sequenced to confirm the identity of the constructs . _METHOD_ is a derivative with the _METHOD_ containing cassette from the binary vector pjh _METHOD_ . microprojectile bombardment of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ leaves was performed with a bio rad _PROTEIN_ as previously described . imaging of _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ was performed using a confocal scanner tcs _PROTEIN_ together with a dm irbe microscope to h after bombardment . _METHOD_ and chlorophyll were excited with light of wavelength nm . the pbluescript vector containing full cdna was digested with xbai/bamhi and fragment was subcloned in sense orientation into the binary vector pgptvkan downstream of the promoter to produce . nine hundred base pairs of the end of cdna was amplified with introducing akpni site _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the pcr product was digested with kpni and ecori and cloned into _PROTEIN_ before being subcloned into thekpni and ecori sites of . the resulting binary vector contained the bp fragment downstream of and in antisense orientation to the full cdna . arabidopsis ecotype _PROTEIN_ was transformed with this construct using a floral dip method . transgenic plants were selected on murashige and skoog medium containing before being transferred to soil . leaves of week old plants were harvested for rna analysis . plants were also monitored daily to detect any aberrant growth or development phenotypes .
