_PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporters are _LOCATION_ proteins responsible for cellular detoxification processes in plants and animals . recent evidence shows that this class of transporters may also be involved in many other cellular processes . because of their homology with human multidrug resistance associated proteins cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and sulfonylurea receptor some plant abc transporters have been implicated in the regulation of ion channel activities . this paper describes an investigation of the _PROTEIN_ gene and its role in stomatal regulation . reporter gene studies showed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in stomata and that the protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . stomatal aperture in three independent _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was larger than in wild type plants both in the light and in the dark resulting in increased water loss but no change in the photosynthetic rate . in baker 's yeast _PROTEIN_ shows _PROTEIN_ dependent vanadate sensitive transport of methotrexate an antifolate and a substrate of mammalian mrps . treatment with mtx reduced stomatal opening in wild type plants but had no effect in _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results indicate the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the complex regulation of stomatal aperture .
the longest _PROTEIN_ cdna insert isolated from a cdna library lacked the first bp . following gene predicitions by citation and our own structural alignments of the entire atmrp gene family we found no intron in the missing bp at the end . the sequence was therefore obtained by pcr amplification of genomic dna and inserted upstream of the _PROTEIN_ cdna such that the entire dna sequence was identical to genbank entry . the open reading frame of the _PROTEIN_ cdna encodes a protein of aa residues with a predicted molecular weight of kda . hydropathy profile consensus prediction using the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ protein database predicts transmembrane helices organized in three transmembrane domains . the two abcs of _PROTEIN_ resemble those typical for abc proteins . each consists of a c. aa domain comprising the walker a and walker b motifs of _PROTEIN_ binding sites and the abc signature . as found for most atmrps _PROTEIN_ also contains a perfect n terminal abc signature and a degenerated c terminal abc signature with matches in five of the eight conserved amino acid positions . rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in different tissues revealed that this abc transporter is _PROTEIN_ in low amounts in all tissues tested . in order to obtain a more detailed picture of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoter fusions between kbp of the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ and the uida gene encoding _PROTEIN_ were constructed and used to transform arabidopsis plants or for particle gun mediated transient _PROTEIN_ in vicia faba leaves . the promoter fragment corresponds to the entire utr between and _GENE_ . in seedlings grown in permanent light or darkness gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in primary roots and the basal region of hypocotyls close to the root shoot interphase . no gus activity was detected in root hairs . interestingly gus activity was generally absent from the root tips of light grown seedlings while high gus activity was observed in root tips of etiolated seedlings . for gus staining seedlings were exposed to bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ acid _PROTEIN_ for h. when incubation was allowed to continue for h the entire seedling showed gus specific staining confirming the rt pcr results . in different leaf types gus activity driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was variable . this was illustrated by different intensities of blue staining observed in cotyledons and three rosette leaves of independent transgenic lines which are representative of the staining patterns found in our transformants . in rosette leaves petioles were stained in several cases . in cotyledons and rosette leaves gus activity was often unevenly distributed . in some but not all cases the vascular tissue of cotyledons and rosette leaves exhibited higher gus activity than the surrounding tissue . irrespective of these irregular staining patterns high gus activity was always detected in the guard cells of cotyledons rosette leaves cauline leaves hypocotyls _METHOD_ and the fused carpel walls . in flowers high gus activity was found in the sepals _PROTEIN_ and in the filaments . young carpels generally stained strongly at the style while gus activity in the carpel walls increased during ripening of the silique . in order to verify the specificity of the high gus activity in guard cells epidermal strips of v. faba leaves were bombarded with particles coated with promoter gus fusion constructs . gus activity driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was unequivocally observed in the guard cells of v. faba leaves . in addition transgenic arabidopsis plants transformed with a t dna carrying a fusion of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ exhibited high _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in guard cells . analysis of _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ database predicts the presence of a chloroplast targeting signal with average to high probability . to determine precisely the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ an enhanced version of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was inserted into the _PROTEIN_ cdna within an intracellular loop separating the predicted transmembrane helices and . this particular location of _METHOD_ was chosen to minimize interference with the catalytic active cytoplasmic nucleotide binding folds of _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscope analysis of onion epidermal cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed _METHOD_ at the periphery of cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ protein is located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker _PROTEIN_ a component of the slow _LOCATION_ k channel was used as a control . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled the tonoplast surrounding the central _LOCATION_ but not the cytoplasm which is largely restricted to a region surrounding the _LOCATION_ . these labels clearly distinguish the tonoplast and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this also _METHOD_ the observation that _PROTEIN_ is localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in some onion cells bombarded with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dense vesicles filled with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were observed . these may have been caused by the high activity of the camv promoter used to drive the _METHOD_ fusion overloading the cells secretory pathway with excessive quantities of fusion protein . bombardment of onion epidermis with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a component of the outer envelope protein import machinery of chloroplasts assured the presence of _LOCATION_ in these cells . _METHOD_ signals were visible on a large amount of intracellular structures _PROTEIN_ close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and appeared clearly different from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not associated with _LOCATION_ . seedlings transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed high levels of _METHOD_ in both the root and the shoot . as observed in bombarded onion tissue _METHOD_ in the root epidermis and leaf stomata was restricted to the cells periphery . vector transformed control plants revealed no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to verify these data immunologically arabidopsis microsomes were separated by linear sucrose gradient density centrifugation and probed with monoclonal anti _METHOD_ antibodies . results showed a single band of the expected size in gradient fractions . _PROTEIN_ co localized with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound p type h _PROTEIN_ while markers for other _LOCATION_ such as the _LOCATION_ v type h _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ specific marker were found in other fractions . t dna insertion mutants were identified for the _PROTEIN_ gene in collections of t dna transformed arabidopsis lines obtained from arabidopsis stock centers _PROTEIN_ . sequence analysis of pcr fragments identified t dna insertions at positions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . only one t dna insertion was located within the coding region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a were found and bp downstream of the stop codon respectively . both t dna insertion sites were defined by sequence analysis of the appropriate pcr products . surprisingly the insertion in _PROTEIN_ caused a deletion of _PROTEIN_ sequence from to removing a significant portion of the putative promoter region as well as the entire and most of domains . database searches of cold spring harbor laboratory genetrap db resulted in identification of mutant line _PROTEIN_ which bears a dissociation element in the exon of _PROTEIN_ . upon integration of the ds element a duplication of _PROTEIN_ sequences to occurred at the insertion site . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants were backcrossed to the wild type . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ co segregated with insertions in _PROTEIN_ . the number and structure of t dna insertions or ds elements in single lines was confirmed by southern blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ was found to contain only a single t dna insert whereas _PROTEIN_ lines showed two independent t dna insertions . these t dnas could not be separated by backcrossing with the wild type thus revealing their close proximity . pcr and southern blot analysis as well as growth on media containing kanamycin as selection marker for the ds element inserted in _PROTEIN_ allowed the isolation and establishment of lines homozygous for the disrupted _PROTEIN_ gene . as the t dna insertion of _PROTEIN_ a did not show any phenotypic alteration possibly because of its location of more than bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ stop codon this line was not subjected to further analysis . rt pcr experiments performed on total rna extracted from aerial parts of soil grown arabidopsis showed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript did not accumulate in homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . this result suggests that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas are unstable when the insertion is either close to the stop codon _PROTEIN_ or right in front of the polyadenylation signal _PROTEIN_ . these findings concur with the observation that all _PROTEIN_ mutant lines display identical mutant phenotypes . the strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in guard cells prompted the question whether the absence of _PROTEIN_ leads to changes in stomatal movement . in a first experiment leaves were excised from dark _PROTEIN_ plants of all mutants and the corresponding wild types . the leaves were placed on mm kcl and mm in the light for h and subsequently incubated in the dark on the same medium for a further h. microscopic measurements of epidermal peels revealed that irrespective of the light conditions the stomatal aperture as well as the calculated width to length ratio of the stomatal pore was larger in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the corresponding wild types . in order to verify that the knockout in _PROTEIN_ does not affect the density or spacing of stomata in the abaxial epidermal layer the stomatal frequency based on more than stomata per genotype was calculated . the mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were compared with the respective wild types wassilewskija stomata and landsberg _LOCATION_ . results showed no significant difference between the stomatal density in the mutants and their corresponding wild types . interestingly the ler ecotype shows fewer stomata per unit surface area than ws . this is consistent with our observation that in drying experiments ler loses fresh weight more slowly than ws . stomatal pore width is controlled by a large number of endogenous and ecological parameters . one of the most prominent effectors of stomatal aperture is the water stress hormone aba which normally triggers stomatal closure and inhibits opening in the light . in order to investigate whether the increased stomatal aperture in _PROTEIN_ was caused by insensitivity to aba leaves from dark _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were incubated for h in the light in the presence of aba . mutant stomatal pore widths were measured and compared to the corresponding wild type . aba inhibited the opening of stomata in the light in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . in addition stomata of _PROTEIN_ mutants closed after application of aba in the light _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we concluded that the increased aperture of _PROTEIN_ mutants was not the result of changes in sensitivity to aba . in this respect _PROTEIN_ mutants behaved very differently to _PROTEIN_ mutants which are insensitive to aba . stomatal pore size was also investigated on the leaves of intact plants in a growth chamber . the width of ws and _PROTEIN_ stomatal apertures was compared before and after exposure to light under controlled conditions . leaves were detached from intact week old ws and _PROTEIN_ plants min before and min after exposure to light . leaves were examined and stomatal apertures measured immediately upon detachment . at the end of the dark period stomatal apertures in dark _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were clearly larger than in ws . likewise stomata of _PROTEIN_ were larger than those of ws after min of light irradiation . thus differences in stomatal pore width resulting from changes in light conditions occurred _PROTEIN_ of whether the leaves remained on the plant or were excised and exposed to kcl . it was therefore hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ mutants would experience increased water loss and that _PROTEIN_ mutants should exhibit lower values compared to ws plants . it is well established that ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ effectively discriminates between and . when stomata are open gas exchange between the leaf intercellular space and the atmosphere is optimal and rubisco preferentially fixes leading to a stronger discrimination . in contrast when stomata are closed diffusion of atmospheric _PROTEIN_ into the intercellular leaf space is restricted leading to a _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ concentration in the leave and the probability that rubisco fixes increases . stable _PROTEIN_ isotope ratios were analyzed in dry material collected from rosette leaves of single ws and _PROTEIN_ plants . leaves were separated into fractions of younger leaves and mature fully expanded leaves by counting from the top of the rosette . fully expanded leaves of _PROTEIN_ indeed exhibited a statistically not significant tendency to lower values when compared to the wild type while no difference was observed in younger rosette leaves . younger leaves are less likely to exhibit significant differences in values than mature leaves as the _PROTEIN_ isotope signature of bulk leaf material represents a time integrated signal and only a small fraction of the _PROTEIN_ of young leaves is derived by their own photosynthesis . therefore the observation that _PROTEIN_ exhibited increased stomatal pore sizes under growth chamber conditions was reflected by a _PROTEIN_ in the corresponding values . taken together these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ has an increased rate of stomatal transpiration and that _PROTEIN_ plants would be consequently less tolerant to drought stress conditions than wild type . as mutations in _PROTEIN_ affect the regulation of stomatal aperture one might expect the mutant plants to display a different rate of transpiration and water loss . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ plays an important role during drought stress response water loss was measured using two methods . firstly a time course of fw loss was measured in excised rosettes of soil grown plants . as expected for leaves with greater pore apertures _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants displayed increased water loss compared to the wild type . secondly water loss and wilting was analyzed over several days in intact mature plants as they desiccated after cessation of watering . figure shows plants after days of drought . all mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wilted earlier than the corresponding wild types . however the wilting phenotype in all _PROTEIN_ individuals was less severe than in the classical aba insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . single _PROTEIN_ plants grown in soil also displayed earlier wilting than the wild type . loss of water from individual plants in saran wrapped pots leaving only the foliage exposed to the atmosphere was also accelerated for _PROTEIN_ plants when compared to wild type plants . transpiration rates in intact wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were measured using gas exchange analysis of individual leaves under various environmental conditions . in the first set of experiments changes in the transpiration rate were investigated while shifting plants from darkness to light _PROTEIN_ and back to darkness . the experiment began with dark _PROTEIN_ plants at p.p.m . _PROTEIN_ . switching light on and off induced an increase and a _PROTEIN_ in transpiration rate respectively reflecting stomatal opening and closing respectively . analysis of steady state levels of transpiration revealed that _PROTEIN_ had significantly higher transpiration rates in the light as compared to the wild type . in the dark a slight though statistically insignificant increase in transpiration rate was observed in the mutant compared to the wild type . linear and exponential fitting with first order exponential functions was used to analyze the kinetics of transitions between steady states for each curve . the analysis showed that switching on the light induced a faster increase in transpiration rate in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type suggesting that stomatal opening in response to light occurs more quickly in the mutant . however no significant differences between the wild type and mutant were observed when the time constant for the closing reaction was calculated . this result suggested that the effect of the mutation in _PROTEIN_ is not restricted to absolute changes in stomatal pore size but also effects the kinetics of stomatal opening . as the aba response as discussed previously was not affected in _PROTEIN_ the capacity to close and open stomata in the light in response to increases or _PROTEIN_ in ca _PROTEIN_ was investigated . experiments were designed to include quick drastic changes in ca _PROTEIN_ as well as step by step changes . at high ca _PROTEIN_ no significant difference in the transpiration rate between the wild type and mutant was observed indicating that the capacity to close the stomata in response to high _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the mutation . in contrast at ca values of p.p.m . _PROTEIN_ or less _PROTEIN_ exhibited a clearly higher transpiration rate _PROTEIN_ than the wild type . therefore the absence of _PROTEIN_ did not alter stomatal closure in response to high ca but did enhance opening at low ca . using the patch clamp technique changes in stomatal aperture and transpiration rates were investigated in relation to alterations in the activities of known guard cell ion channels located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however although the inwardly and outwardly rectifying potassium channels as well as the slowly activating aba induced anion channel were detected no changes in their activities were observed between _PROTEIN_ and wild type guard cells . it was therefore concluded that _PROTEIN_ does not act independently as an ion channel nor does it directly control channel activities e.g . by physical interaction . however we can not exclude that the effects of _PROTEIN_ disruption on ion channel activities are too weak to be detected . mrps are known to be _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ transporters for diverse amphiphilic organic anions . in our hands heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under control of various promoters in the strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae which lacks detectable _LOCATION_ glutathione conjugate transport activity failed to produce measurable _PROTEIN_ dependent transport of the model organic anions dinitrobenzene glutathione and estradiol _PROTEIN_ . recently it was proposed that _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ could function as a high capacity pump for folates and the antifolate drug mtx . indeed _PROTEIN_ dependent uptake of tritiated mtx into microsomes isolated from yeasts transformed with full length _PROTEIN_ is fold higher than that into microsomes of empty vector transformed yeasts . vanadate is the classical inhibitor of abc type transport processes . in the presence of vanadate both the _PROTEIN_ transport and control transport activities were reduced to the same level arguing for the presence of additional transport _METHOD_ in yeasts which can not be attributed to abc proteins . the difference of the vanadate sensitive mtx transport activity between microsomes from _PROTEIN_ transformants and empty vector transformants is consequently even higher _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acts as a mtx transporter . mtx inhibits folate synthesis at the dihydrofolate reductase step . although no information is available as to why plants should pump folates across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ space the mutation in _PROTEIN_ was investigated to determine whether it could perturb folate homeostasis in guard cells leading ultimately to the stomatal phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ . the effects of increased concentrations of mtx on stomatal opening in the light were therefore investigated . light induced stomatal opening in wild type plants was significantly reduced in the presence of . in contrast light induced stomatal opening in _PROTEIN_ was not affected by mtx . furthermore the application of up to mtx in the dark did not alter stomatal pore size in ws or _PROTEIN_ . in contrast folic and folinic acid had no effect on light induced opening in wild type and mutant plants . it was therefore concluded that light induced stomatal opening was partially inhibited by the antifolate drug mtx and that this inhibition was dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ .

exchanged bp of _PROTEIN_ resulting in vector pbsc _PROTEIN_ full . an motif and a noti site were added to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ by exchanging the very last bp of its end with the insert of
