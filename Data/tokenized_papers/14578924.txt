here we show using the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion system that an arabidopsis thaliana is targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts . a deletion mutant lacking the residues with translation initiation at the second methionine residue was imported into chloroplasts only . however a mutated form of the targeting peptide in which the second methionine residue is changed to leucine was imported to both organelles . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected when a mutation was introduced between the first and second _PROTEIN_ codons of the _METHOD_ construct suggesting no alternative translational initiation . our results show that the dual targeting of the is due to an ambiguous targeting peptide . furthermore we show that the recombinant at degrades mitochondrial and chloroplastic targeting peptides indicating its function as a signal peptide degrading protease in both mitochondria and chloroplasts .
the protein of the arabidopsis thaliana is reported in the ncbi database to contain residues . the targeting peptide was predicted to be amino acids long and the mature part corresponds to amino acids as determined by both mitoprot and chlorop . the intracellular prediction program targetp indicated that the at could be localized both to mitochondria and chloroplasts whereas predotar predicted only the mitochondrial localization . to investigate targeting of the at the targeting peptide and residues from the mature part of the protein were fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the plant strong transcription promoter . the mitochondrial presequence of the _PROTEIN_ synthase from nicotiana plumbaginifolia fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was used to assay mitochondrial targeting . transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ constructs was performed in tobacco protoplasts . confocal microscopy analysis shows that in protoplasts transformed with the _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is localized to small punctuated structures which were also labelled by the _METHOD_ of mitotracker . colocalization is shown in yellow in the merged image in fig ref . _METHOD_ alone showed the characteristic _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . protoplasts transformed with the _METHOD_ construct showed _METHOD_ in two different locations the punctuated structures and large round structures . _METHOD_ in the punctuated structure colocalized with mitotracker . in contrast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the large round structures colocalized with the chloroplasts as shown by the superposition of _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the targeting peptide of the at contains a second methionine residue at position that might function as a second translational initiation site . we therefore used a deletion construct starting from the second methionine _METHOD_ and a mutant with the second methionine changed to leucine _METHOD_ . the truncated targeting peptide in the _METHOD_ construct targeted _METHOD_ to chloroplasts only as shown by the colocalization of green _METHOD_ with the red _METHOD_ of the chlorophyll . a few chloroplasts seem not to be labelled by _METHOD_ as has been shown for other proteins in a protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ system . the mutant construct _METHOD_ targeted _METHOD_ to both mitochondria and chloroplasts as revealed by the colocalization of _METHOD_ with mitotracker and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . we can therefore conclude that the second part of the targeting peptide is sufficient for chloroplast targeting but not for mitochondrial targeting . the same constructs that were used for protoplast transformation were cloned into a binary vector and transient _PROTEIN_ into tobacco leaves was performed . the leaf area infiltrated with the agrobacterium suspension carrying the control _METHOD_ construct showed green _METHOD_ in the characteristic mitochondrial structures of small punctuate morphology . the green _METHOD_ in the punctuated structures was colocalized with the immunostaining of a marker lipoamide dehydrogenase . with the _METHOD_ construct alone _METHOD_ was detected in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ surrounding the large central _LOCATION_ . the presence of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ has been also observed previously . the leaf area infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying the _METHOD_ construct again showed green _METHOD_ in mitochondria and chloroplasts . note that the mitochondrial labelling follows the border of the epidermal cell . note also that not all the cells are transformed in this transient _PROTEIN_ system . this results in the identification of chloroplasts of cells that are not labelled by _METHOD_ . these results further confirmed the dual targeting properties of the targeting peptide . when the leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying the truncated construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was targeted to the chloroplasts only . however _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ construct was targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts . furthermore no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected when a _METHOD_ construct that contained a frameshift mutation between the first and second _PROTEIN_ codon of the _METHOD_ construct was introduced into tobacco leaves . these results exclude the dual targeting of the as a result of alternative translational initiation in vivo . in conclusion the at harbours an ambiguous targeting signal which is recognized and transported by both mitochondrial and chloroplastic import machinery . to investigate whether the targeting fidelity of the at is influenced by its mature part and to verify the dual targeting of the targeting peptide in vitro import assays of the and were performed with isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts . incubation of the precursor with isolated mitochondria resulted in import and processing of the precursor protein detected as protection of the mature inside mitochondria after treatment with proteinase k . the truncated presequence could not target the into mitochondria . however incubation of the mutant precursor with isolated mitochondria resulted in import and partial processing of the precursor . import of the precursors into mitochondria was dependent on _LOCATION_ potential because no imported precursor or mature form was protected from degradation by pk in the presence of valinomycin . incubation of the precursor with isolated chloroplasts resulted in import and processing of the precursor protein to a protein identical to that in the mitochondrial import experiments . the mature protein was resistant to treatment with thermolysin . both the truncated and mutant precursor proteins were also imported and processed to a form after incubation with chloroplasts . incubation of the precursor simultaneously with isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts in a dual import system followed by of the organelles also resulted in import and processing of the precursor protein to a protein in both organelles . the protein was further resistant to treatment with thermolysin indicating import of the precursor into mitochondria and chloroplasts . these results further verified dual targeting of the . isolated spinach mitochondria and chloroplasts were probed with an antibody against at . a protein band with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda was detected in both mitochondria and chloroplasts . these results showed dual localization of in spinach . purity of the mitochondria and chloroplasts was tested by using antibodies raised against proteins there was less than . previous results from our laboratory showed that the mitochondrial presequences are degraded by a metalloprotease and that the protease was identified as the at . chloroplastic transit peptides were shown to be degraded by an _PROTEIN_ metalloprotease activity however the protease responsible for the degradation remains unknown . incubation of a nicotiana mitochondrial presequence from the _PROTEIN_ synthase citation and a pisum sativum chloroplast transit peptide of the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ with the recombinant mature part of the resulted in the complete degradation of both targeting peptides . no proteolytic activity was seen in the presence of a metal chelator . we therefore conclude that the degrades targeting peptides in both organelles . several techniques are available for studying organellar protein targeting not all of which are ideal for studying dual targeting . there are a few reports showing mistargeting of chloroplastic proteins to mitochondria with the use of in vitro import methods . however _METHOD_ as a marker in an in vivo _METHOD_ fusion system has been frequently used to study the subcellular localization of proteins with rare examples of mistargeting . the only published example in which _METHOD_ has given results that were in conflict with another technique was for arabidopsis mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase . we have confirmed our results of dual targeting with a combination of complementary techniques both in vivo and in vitro . in addition to the targeting and immunodetection studies the proteolytic activity of the recombinant against both the mitochondrial and chloroplastic targeting peptides strongly suggests that the functions as a protease in both organelles .
