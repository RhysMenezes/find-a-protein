phototropins and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ function as blue light photoreceptors for phototropism chloroplast relocation stomatal opening and leaf flattening in arabidopsis thaliana . phototropin consists of two functional domains the n terminal photosensory domain and the c terminal ser/thr kinase domain . however little is known about the signal transduction pathway that links the photoreceptors and the physiological responses downstream of bl perception . to understand the _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ initiates these responses we transformed the _PROTEIN_ double mutant of arabidopsis with constructs encoding translationally fused _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein . was fully functional for the _PROTEIN_ specific physiological responses in these transgenic plants . it localized strongly to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and weakly to the cytoplasm in the dark . upon illumination with bl punctate staining was formed within a few minutes in addition to the constitutive _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ staining . this punctate distribution pattern matched well with that of the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . brefeldin a an inhibitor of vesicle trafficking induced accumulation of around the perinuclear region even in darkness but the punctate pattern was not observed . after treatment of these cells with bl exhibited the punctate distribution pattern that matched with that of the _LOCATION_ marker . hence the light dependent association of with the _LOCATION_ apparatus was bfa insensitive . a structure/function analysis indicated that the kinase domain was essential for the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . the bl induced _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ may be one of important signaling steps in the _PROTEIN_ signal transduction pathway .
to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant background under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter or the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . using the _PROTEIN_ mutant as the host line for transformation we established and independent lines . of these the line that showed high _PROTEIN_ of and the line that _PROTEIN_ at the endogenous level were chosen as representative lines and used for the following experiments . these transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ at the expected size . no extra band was detected in the immunoblot analysis with an anti _METHOD_ antibody in lines ensuring that most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ observed below was not from fragmented proteins . observation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed that hypocotyl _PROTEIN_ of in was much higher than that in in dark grown seedlings . phototropin _METHOD_ accumulates in the apical and basal ends of the cortical cells of both hypocotyl and root . although we attempted to examine whether a similar pattern was observed for the _PROTEIN_ in the cortical cells of the lines was too low to be determined . in the lines we could detect the _METHOD_ but asymmetric distribution was less clear compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . next we tested whether complemented the _PROTEIN_ deficient phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . phototropism chloroplast relocation and leaf shape were examined in the above lines . the and the transgenic seedlings showed hypocotyl curvature in response to a high intensity of bl whereas no curvature was observed in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . in addition the transgenic plants showed a partial response towards lower intensities of bl . the photoaccumulation and photoavoidance responses of chloroplasts were examined . under a low intensity of bl chloroplasts accumulated in the irradiated area in the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the transgenic plant . the avoidance response from a high intensity of bl was also observed in this line . the rosette leaves of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant curled downwards as previously reported . flat leaves were clearly restored in the transgenic line . the complementation was also observed in the line . taken together we concluded that was fully functional in these transgenic plants . although data on representative lines only are shown below we confirmed the results in other lines . phototropin _METHOD_ fusion protein shows light dependent dissociation from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in response to confocal laser beam irradiation . we examined distribution in the cotyledon epidermal cells of the day old dark grown seedlings because they were less vacuolated and exhibited high _PROTEIN_ in both and . although it was ideal to examine the subcellular distribution of in we _PROTEIN_ used in the following experiments . this was because the latter provided a more convenient system for monitoring the subcellular distribution in _METHOD_ of signal strength . the seedlings were observed under a confocal microscope . to minimize the effects of actinic bl images taken only from the first confocal scan were _PROTEIN_ to represent the dark state . in those cells strong _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region but weak and uniform _METHOD_ was observed in the cytoplasm . we noticed that multiple scans of the samples induced a punctate pattern of distribution in addition to the constitutive _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . we further examined the localization of after light treatments . the seedlings were illuminated with bl or red light . the punctate pattern was clearly observed in the bl treated cells where a faint punctate pattern was observed as early as min after the onset of bl . by contrast punctate staining was not observed in the rl treated cells . we confirmed that treatment of these rl treated cells with laser actinic bl induced the punctate staining . although observation was more difficult because of lower _PROTEIN_ distribution of in both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm was observed in the dark grown seedlings . furthermore we could confirm the bl induced punctate staining of . therefore we concluded that the punctate distribution of observed in the transgenic plants was not due to ectopic _PROTEIN_ by the promoter . we then examined whether or not the response was cell autonomous . when a restricted area of the cotyledon of the seedlings was irradiated with bl the punctate staining was induced only in the irradiated area and its vicinity . the bl induced punctate distribution of was further confirmed in other cell types . the mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from the rosette leaves and then dark _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscopic observation revealed that punctate staining of was formed by bl treatment of these cells with either a confocal laser beam or light emitting diodes _PROTEIN_ . we observed guard cells of the rosette leaves of the dark _PROTEIN_ plants and hypocotyl epidermis of the dark grown seedlings in similar ways . as expected punctate staining was also observed in these cells after treatment with bl . the level of _PROTEIN_ protein is downregulated by bl . to address whether bl affects the level of _PROTEIN_ the dark grown wild type seedlings were treated with bl for various periods of time and subjected to the immunoblot analysis . the antibody which was raised against the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ reacted with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ signal _PROTEIN_ substantially in response to bl as described whereas that of _PROTEIN_ was barely affected by bl . subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ and was further examined by protein fractionation . the crude protein extracts of the wild type and the dark grown seedlings were fractionated into soluble and pellet fractions by high speed centrifugation . the _PROTEIN_ and signals were detected in the pelleted microsomal fraction but almost no signal was detected in the soluble fractions . furthermore neither _PROTEIN_ nor was detected in the soluble fraction even after bl irradiation for min . green _METHOD_ protein which is a typical soluble protein was detected in the soluble fraction in the _METHOD_ seedlings under the same condition . to address whether was associated with any particular structure we examined the co localization of with various subcellular markers such as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for the _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for mitochondria and dye for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or endosome in mesophyll protoplasts prepared from the leaves of the transgenic lines . the majority of punctate staining overlapped with the red _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and to some extent with that of but overlap was not observed for the other markers . to confirm bl dependent _LOCATION_ localization of we crossed the transgenic line with a transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and observed the seedlings . the was _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the dark grown seedlings whereas the red _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed only as punctate staining in the cytoplasm . after irradiation with bl punctate staining of appeared throughout the cytoplasm whereas the distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not affected . as expected about of punctate stains overlapped with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at min after bl illumination . prolonged bl illumination for min increased the overlapping ratio to . therefore we concluded that a fraction of was associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus in response to bl . brefeldin a is a vesicle trafficking inhibitor which induces _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fusion and formation of the bfa compartment . we examined the effects of bfa on the _LOCATION_ association of . brefeldin a affected the distribution patterns of both in darkness and under bl . in darkness the _METHOD_ was observed within a restricted region of the cytoplasm in addition to the intense _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ staining . however no punctate staining was recognized . in the same cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed large aggregates of punctate staining around . after illumination of the seedling the punctate staining of appeared within the region where accumulated . these bl induced punctate stains overlapped well with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we further examined whether or not accumulated in the _LOCATION_ in the presence of bfa . _LOCATION_ staining with propidium iodide revealed that the punctate stains of accumulated in the vicinity of but not inside the _LOCATION_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ is divided into two functional domains the n terminal photosensory domain and the c terminal kinase domain . we investigated which of these two domains was responsible for the _LOCATION_ localization of using the protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ system . as expected exhibited both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and punctate localization in the protoplasts treated with bl for min . the n terminal domain fused to _METHOD_ was observed uniformly in the cytoplasm whereas the c terminal domain fused to _METHOD_ exhibited intense punctate staining in the cytoplasm . furthermore the intensity in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region was significantly reduced for compared with that for . we then examined co localization of the above fragments with the _LOCATION_ marker . protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed . as expected the punctate stains of and overlapped well with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast no overlap was observed in the protoplast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we further examined whether kinase activity is required for the _LOCATION_ localization of . the asp residue in subdomain vii of the c terminal kinase domain of phototropins is required for kinase activity . we _PROTEIN_ with a point mutation at this residue in the protoplasts . as shown in figure both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and punctate _METHOD_ was observed for g. the pattern was similar to that of except that the extent of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was greater in some cases . we confirmed that the punctate stains overlapped well with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . hence kinase activity is not essential for the _LOCATION_ association in the absence of the n terminal domain . we produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ g under control of the promoter on the _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . the plants showed no complementation of the phototropic chloroplast movement and leaf shape phenotypes . in darkness strong g _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region and weak and uniform _METHOD_ was observed in the cytoplasm . this pattern was very similar to that of in darkness . nevertheless g failed to exhibit the punctate staining pattern even after prolonged bl irradiation . hence kinase activity appeared to be required for the _LOCATION_ association in the full length context .
