target of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase controls many cellular functions in eukaryotic cells in response to stress and nutrient availability and was shown to be essential for embryonic development in arabidopsis thaliana . we demonstrated that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacts with the heat repeats of _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ regulates the activity of kinase in response to osmotic stress . _PROTEIN_ also interacts in vivo with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a putative substrate for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein and immunoprecipitated from tobacco leaves after transient _PROTEIN_ was active in phosphorylating the arabidopsis ribosomal protein . the catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ could be phosphorylated by arabidopsis phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase _PROTEIN_ indicating the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of . the _PROTEIN_ activity was sensitive to osmotic stress while _PROTEIN_ activity was not affected . however _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to osmotic stress was relieved by co overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . overall these observations demonstrated the existence of a functional _PROTEIN_ kinase pathway in plants . however arabidopsis seedlings do not respond to normal physiological levels of rapamycin which appears to be due its inability to bind to the arabidopsis homolog of _PROTEIN_ a protein that is essential for the binding of rapamycin with _PROTEIN_ . replacement of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with the human _PROTEIN_ allowed rapamycin dependent interaction with _PROTEIN_ . since homozygous mutation in _PROTEIN_ is lethal it suggests that this pathway is essential for integrating the stress signals into the growth regulation .
the arabidopsis genome contains a single _PROTEIN_ homolog present on chromosome while there are two genes encoding _PROTEIN_ on chromosomes and as previously described . we obtained cdnas of _PROTEIN_ and one of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . both cdna sequences were confirmed to be identical to the genbank annotation and the _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence was also found to be identical to the one described by citation . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were found to be _PROTEIN_ constitutively in various tissues of arabidopsis at low levels and the _PROTEIN_ levels did not change significantly during different physiological conditions indicating that _PROTEIN_ may be regulated by some posttranscriptional/translational _METHOD_ . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in animals are known to interact with each other we examined whether plant _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _PROTEIN_ and if this interaction occurs via the heat repeat domain of _PROTEIN_ as in the case of animal _PROTEIN_ . to analyze this possible interaction in vivo we overexpressed glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused heat repeats of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs in tobacco leaves . the _PROTEIN_ was performed in the presence of the tomato bushy stunt virus protein a system that allows high levels of transient protein _PROTEIN_ in plants . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ heat protein _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves was immunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ antibody . following _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the proteins were transferred to _LOCATION_ and the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a coimmunoprecipitant was observed by protein gel blot analysis using _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in the immunoprecipitate with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ heat protein suggesting that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is also conserved in plants and that the _PROTEIN_ heat repeat motif is involved in the interaction . a construct carrying the _PROTEIN_ rapamycin binding and the kinase domains of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not show any interaction with _PROTEIN_ supporting the specificity of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the heat repeats of _PROTEIN_ . citation and citation suggested that _PROTEIN_ was the arabidopsis ortholog of the mammalian that has been known to be a downstream component of the mammalian _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway and phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ . in animals a closely related isoform is a product of the same gene using an alternative translational start site and contains an n terminal _LOCATION_ targeting signal . this protein is exclusively _LOCATION_ and has been suggested to phosphorylate the chromatin bound _LOCATION_ form of _PROTEIN_ whereas which is mostly cytoplasmic is involved in the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasmic ribosomes . protein motif analyses of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences by psort _METHOD_ and by pfscan predicted _PROTEIN_ to contain two putative bipartite _LOCATION_ targeting signals . subcellular localization results with transiently _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in cells were consistent with this prediction . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ confined to _LOCATION_ while the distribution pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of the _METHOD_ control but with more protein distributed toward cytoplasm suggesting that the two arabidopsis homologs may play distinct functional roles in different subcellular locations . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ localized suggests that it may be the functional equivalent of rather than . to explore the possibility of _PROTEIN_ being the cytoplasmic isoform of acting as a functional homolog of the mammalian we tested its interaction with _PROTEIN_ and its ability to phosphorylate the bona fide substrate _PROTEIN_ . to elucidate the possible link between and _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway in plants we examined the kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ using phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . in addition we determined a possible link between the _PROTEIN_ activity and its interaction with _PROTEIN_ by co overexpression of these proteins . if is under the control of the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway in plants and is a substrate of _PROTEIN_ kinase it is likely that would interact with _PROTEIN_ . to determine a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo we first isolated arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and coexpressed transiently the two constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves using the system . when the _PROTEIN_ levels were optimum as judged by a _METHOD_ control the leaf samples were analyzed and _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies . protein gel blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated fraction using _METHOD_ antibodies revealed a distinct band corresponding to the size of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ chimeric protein . the immunoprecipitate from the same fraction using _PROTEIN_ antibody followed by protein gel blot detection with the _PROTEIN_ antibody revealed the presence of a protein equivalent in _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo and this interaction appears to be stable . we repeated the coexpression experiments using alternate constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the immunoprecipitation was performed using _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in figure using _METHOD_ antibody we were able to detect in the immunoprecipitate a band that corresponds to the size of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . at the same time _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also detectable as shown in lane . in both figures and the control constructs _METHOD_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not show any interaction suggesting that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrated by transient coexpression in this study is highly specific . these two experiments provided conclusive evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do interact in vivo . finally we tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitate to phosphorylate its substrate _PROTEIN_ . for this experiment an escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ c terminal fragment of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a substrate for the kinase reaction . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitate using _METHOD_ antibody was found to be active and able to phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ . our data suggests that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is more likely to be a functional homolog of animal . we do not know if _PROTEIN_ also _METHOD_ a complex with _PROTEIN_ but the demonstration of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggests that is likely to be a downstream component of the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway in plants . to explore the effect of osmotic stress on _PROTEIN_ activity we _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in tobacco leaves by agroinfiltration and treated the leaves with different concentrations of mannitol . after homogenization of the leaves _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ antibody and was subjected to the kinase assay using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ct peptide as a substrate . with mannitol treatment the _PROTEIN_ activity showed a significant reduction although at this concentration leaf tissues did not undergo any plasmolysis . a quantitative analysis of this data showed that > reduction in the _PROTEIN_ activity occurred after the treatment with mannitol . this observation suggests that plant may mediate stress response in controlling the phosphorylation state of _PROTEIN_ which is known to affect the rate of translation . the osmotic stress signal may affect the _PROTEIN_ activity via the plant _PROTEIN_ kinase pathway . alternatively it may come through the _PROTEIN_ pathway which has also been known to regulate in animal cells . _PROTEIN_ is known to activate the _PROTEIN_ family of protein kinases to which belongs and several _PROTEIN_ substrates have been identified including pkb rsk sgk and pkc . it has been shown that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ can complement the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutation suggesting the existence of functional conservation of the _PROTEIN_ pathway in eukaryotes . we examined whether is also phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in plants . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains a putative _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation motif on the t activation loop consensus sequences in its catalytic domain . we _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct in tobacco leaves through agroinfiltration and immunoprecipitated the fusion protein with _METHOD_ antibody . the immunoprecipitate was then subjected to a kinase assay using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ catalytic domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as a substrate to determine the _PROTEIN_ activity . the observations from mammalian cells indicated that the phosphorylation of catalytic domain by _PROTEIN_ occurs only after a series of consecutive phosphorylations on the c terminus of mediated by _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitate was able to phosphorylate the _PROTEIN_ catalytic domain in a time dependent manner as shown in figure indicating that plant _PROTEIN_ is also involved in the activation of . we further determined if plant _PROTEIN_ activity is affected by osmotic stress rapamycin or wortmannin . wortmannin is a potent inhibitor of phosphoinositide kinase _PROTEIN_ and is known to inactivate _PROTEIN_ in mammalian cells an indication that _PROTEIN_ is a downstream component of the _PROTEIN_ pathway in animal cells . we overexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves and treated a set of leaves with rapamycin mannitol nacl or wortmannin . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ activity was not responsive to osmotic stress rapamycin or salt treatments but was very sensitive to wortmannin . these data showed that the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ activity upon osmotic stress is not mediated through inactivation of the _PROTEIN_ pathway . thus it suggests that the osmotic stress signal is most likely to affect the _PROTEIN_ pathway to regulate the activity in plants . our data showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in turn interacts with the heat repeats of _PROTEIN_ suggesting a functional link between these proteins in plants . our data also suggested that the osmotic stress signal is likely to affect activity through the _PROTEIN_ pathway in plants . osmotic stress may inhibit _PROTEIN_ kinase activity upstream in the signaling pathway resulting in the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ . alternatively the osmotic stress may regulate _PROTEIN_ activity downstream of the _PROTEIN_ kinase antagonizing the positive effect of _PROTEIN_ pathway on the _PROTEIN_ activity . in order to distinguish these two possibilities we co overexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves by agroinfiltration and treated the leaves with mannitol . the leaf tissues were then homogenized and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ antibody . the activity of _PROTEIN_ was measured by subjecting the immunoprecipitate to the kinase assay . as shown in figure osmotic stress treatment significantly reduced the activity of _PROTEIN_ . however the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ alleviated the osmotic stress effect on the activity of _PROTEIN_ . if osmotic stress regulates the _PROTEIN_ activity by inhibition of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity coexpression of _PROTEIN_ which is a downstream component of _PROTEIN_ would have a neutral or additive effect on the _PROTEIN_ inhibition . thus the data appear to suggest that the osmotic stress affects _PROTEIN_ activity downstream of the _PROTEIN_ kinase . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ probably brings endogenous _PROTEIN_ in closer proximity to its substrate alleviating the inhibition of under osmotic stress conditions . in order to verify that this effect is indeed _PROTEIN_ specific and requires the function of _PROTEIN_ we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ heat repeats together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and examined the possible effect of _PROTEIN_ heat repeats . as a nonfunctional fragment that can still interact with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ heat repeats coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ may abrogate the protective effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ activity under the osmotic stress condition . as shown in figure the co overexpression of _PROTEIN_ heat repeats restored the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to osmotic stress in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ heat repeats along with _PROTEIN_ appears to have diluted out the _PROTEIN_ effect on the _PROTEIN_ activity . this could have been further verified using the full length _PROTEIN_ where the kinase domain is present however we have not been successful in overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ yet . we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the promoter . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by rna gel blot analysis . these plants apparently exhibited no distinct phenotype as compared with the wild type or control transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the vector alone . however upon treatment with mannitol the transgenic seeds of the _PROTEIN_ transformed line were found to be overly sensitive to osmotic stress . this does not appear to be due to any germination problem because under normal conditions the germination of the untreated _PROTEIN_ transgenic line was similar to the control transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the vector construct alone . this observation supports the hypothesis that having activity slowed down under osmotic stress conditions is one of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ employed by the plants to sustain harsh environmental conditions . we observed that rapamycin does not inhibit the growth of arabidopsis seedlings at levels that are effective in yeast and mammalian cells . although we could not rule out the possibility that rapamycin has a lower permeability to the plant cells that is rather unlikely because rapamycin enters easily in all other eukaryotic cells so far tested . since the growth inhibitory effect of rapamycin on the cells is known to be due to the formation of an inhibitory complex involving the _PROTEIN_ frb domain rapamycin and _PROTEIN_ we tested if plant homolog of _PROTEIN_ associates with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ frb domain in a rapamycin dependent manner as is the case with mammalian _PROTEIN_ . for this we performed both a two hybrid interaction study and a direct binding assay with in vitro synthesized and labeled _PROTEIN_ frb peptide . the labeled peptide was incubated with either _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ human _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent with a previous observation made with a yeast two hybrid system neither the yeast two hybrid analysis nor the in vitro translation data could demonstrate a rapamycin dependent interaction between arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ frb domain . interestingly in the same experiment the _PROTEIN_ frb domain was able to form a complex with hs _PROTEIN_ . these results suggested that there might be some mutation in the amino acid sequence of the plant _PROTEIN_ rendering it insensitive to rapamycin and thus preventing it from forming an inhibitory complex with the plant _PROTEIN_ .
total rna was isolated from leaves of week old arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using trizol reagent following the manufacturer 's instructions . approximately of total rna prepared by the above method was used in each rt pcr reaction using the thermoscript rt pcr system following the standard amplification conditions . the full length cdna of the _PROTEIN_ gene on chromosome was cloned by rt pcr using the thermoscript rt pcr system following the manufacturer 's protocol . since this cdna is very long kb we attempted to amplify it in three overlapping fragments that were fused together upon cloning using specific restriction enzymes to generate the full length clone . the following three primer pairs were used to generate the three overlapping pcr fragments _PROTEIN_ gccctgcagcgatgtctacctcgtcgc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gcatcagctccggaatatattgtctc _PROTEIN_ caagagtgggtggcttggcaatgagac _PROTEIN_ acctcctctagttctgacagctgctg _PROTEIN_ tcagcagctgtcagaactagaggagg _PROTEIN_ tcaccagaaagggcaccacccaacatag . the initial pcr cloning and the subsequent fragment fusion were performed in _PROTEIN_ vector . the entire region of the obtained full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was sequenced and confirmed to be identical to the genbank database and the one described by citation . the _PROTEIN_ cdna consists of exons and predicts a protein product of kd which contains all the conserved domains found in the mammalian _PROTEIN_ including heat repeats fat domain frb domain kinase domain and the fatc domain . for downstream applications including protein _PROTEIN_ and mutagenesis the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna in _PROTEIN_ was subcloned into the gateway entry vector and subsequently moved in to appropriate destination vectors . cloning of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ was achieved by rt pcr amplification of _GENE_ cdna . as with the _PROTEIN_ cdna cloning its cdna was amplified as three overlapping fragments to be joined together by unique restriction enzyme sites . using the thermoscript rt pcr kit arabidopsis leaf rna was amplified with the following primer sets corresponding to the sequences surrounding the unique restriction enzyme sites in the deduced _PROTEIN_ exons gaattcatggcattaggagacttaatggt gaattcgctcttgtacttcttggaagatt gaattcaactacctgagtggattgagga ctcgtcgatgtccatccacaatgacagccagaac ggcggtaccatttaaatttgactagcatccgcacca cccgggaaatgcacccgagctatctaga . the products of these three independent reactions were cloned in _PROTEIN_ vector and subsequently joined together in the gateway entry vector . the identity of the full length clone was confirmed by sequencing . the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was then moved in to various gateway downstream vectors for protein _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as well as in tobacco leaves . arabidopsis ribosomal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdnas were cloned by pcr amplification from an arabidopsis leaf cdna library . the pcr primers were designed to cover and untranslated regions of the corresponding mrnas to ensure specificity of the pcr amplification because their coding regions are highly homologous to each other . the amplified pcr products were directly cloned into the gateway entry vector and the sequences were verified by dna sequencing . various fusion protein constructs of these clones were made either by transferring them to appropriate gateway destination vectors through lr recombination reaction or by restriction digestion based subcloning into the target vectors . the _PROTEIN_ human _PROTEIN_ fusion construct was a kind gift from jie chen . full length cdna clones of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ were obtained by pcr amplification of the corresponding cdna libraries . the

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was used in the kinase assay as bound to the beads without further purification . both _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hs _PROTEIN_ were subjected to further purification by elution with mm glutathione and dialysis before use in the in vitro binding assays . the _PROTEIN_ frb domain was subcloned by pcr into vector . using the in vitro tnt quick coupled transcription/translation system met labeled arabidopsis frb domain was prepared according to the manufacturer 's instructions . briefly of plasmid containing the arabidopsis frb cdna was incubated with tnt reticulocyte lysate and of met in a total volume of for min at . the labeling efficiency and the level of protein _PROTEIN_ were evaluated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and autoradiography . mutations in the frb domain of _PROTEIN_ were made using the quick change kit according to the manufacture 's instructions . the following two pairs of primers were used to generate two mutations in two sites and _PROTEIN_ wf f gccatactttggcatgaaatgtttcatgaagcactagaagaagc _PROTEIN_ wf r _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f gaagcactagaagaagctactcgcttgtattttggtgaac _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ r

subcloning into pegad vector via bamhi and smai restriction digestion and ligation . the _PROTEIN_ was constructed by first cloning _PROTEIN_ into pgex kg to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and then by subcloning the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ open reading frame into and lr recombination reaction with vector . agroinfiltration procedure for the transient protein _PROTEIN_ in tobacco

antibiotic selection and acetosyringone to stationary phase . bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at for min at room temperature and resuspended in mm and of acetosyringone . for cotransfections agrobacterium cultures carrying different constructs were mixed at equal ratio and left for h at room temperature before infiltration . leaves of week old nicotiana benthamiana plants were infiltrated with the bacterial cultures through abaxial air spaces . in all experiments agrobacterium carrying the construct was cotransfected to achieve maximum level of protein _PROTEIN_ . the treatments of osmotic stress and inhibitors in figures to were achieved by a similar manner as described by citation . briefly to d after the agroinfiltration of the dna constructs for transient protein _PROTEIN_ solutions containing a desired concentration of mannitol salt rapamycin wortmannin or control were infiltrated to the same leaves and protein extraction was performed after min .
