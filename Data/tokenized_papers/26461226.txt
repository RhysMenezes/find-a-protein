the involvement of rho of plants _PROTEIN_ in abscisic acid signalling in arabidopsis has been demonstrated in many studies . however the roles of ropgefs _PROTEIN_ which modulate rop activities in aba signalling are poorly understood . here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ may play a negative role in aba suppressed seed germination and post germination growth . we show that disruption of _PROTEIN_ enhances sensitivity to exogenous aba in seed germination assays and that _PROTEIN_ gus is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in developing embryos and germinating seeds . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is located in both the cytoplasmic region and in mitochondria . notably the domain of _PROTEIN_ is detected in mitochondria whereas the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ is shown to be in the _LOCATION_ . after aba treatment degradation of _PROTEIN_ is triggered in the _LOCATION_ through the ubiquitin proteasome system . the binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ which has been demonstrated to be involved in aba signalling not only alters the localization of _PROTEIN_ but also enables _PROTEIN_ to escape degradation in the cell . thus in this study we deduce a sophisticated mechanism of aba mediated _PROTEIN_ rop signalling which potentially implicates the inactivation of rops in responsiveness to aba .
to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in the response to aba we obtained and characterized the t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ ko . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was completely abolished in _PROTEIN_ ko plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ ko was likely a null mutant . we compared the seed germination and seedling growth of _PROTEIN_ ko with that of wild type plants grown in various concentrations of aba . for instance in the presence of aba of _PROTEIN_ ko plants had green cotyledons compared with of wt seedlings suggesting that _PROTEIN_ ko seedlings were more sensitive to aba . to further validate the role of _PROTEIN_ in the response to aba we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ in both the _PROTEIN_ ko background and in the wt background . we scored the cotyledon greening phenotype for each line in response to different concentrations of aba . the reduction in the cotyledon greening rate was obvious for _PROTEIN_ ko treated with and aba . therefore we further analysed the profiles of seed germination and post germination growth at aba . to compare the phenotypes of each of the tested lines we carefully measured the kinetics of emerged radicles and green cotyledons . we observed that seed germination and cotyledon greening were delayed for _PROTEIN_ ko . these results indicated that a lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caused hypersensitivity to aba in seed germination and post germination growth . we noticed that aba sensitivity was not obviously affected in radicle emergence and cotyledon greening in transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might exert its function via coupling with its partner . hence _PROTEIN_ overexpression alone might not be sufficient to increase _PROTEIN_ activity . this effect might be similar to that observed with _PROTEIN_ . in order to stimulate isotropic pollen tube growth the overexpression of both _PROTEIN_ and its partner _PROTEIN_ was required . because only one t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ ko mutant line was available we generated artificial microrna lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in the wt background . in total independent amir _PROTEIN_ lines were obtained and characterized in the generation . to determine the specificity of all the selected amir _PROTEIN_ lines the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ which shares the highest sequence homology to _PROTEIN_ was also examined in parallel . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not affected in the amir _PROTEIN_ lines . ten amir _PROTEIN_ lines with varying degrees of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were further analysed . six of amir _PROTEIN_ lines showed a reduction in cotyledon greening when grown in and aba . because lines and displayed a strong reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we chose to compare their radicle emergence and cotyledon greening with the wt as well as line which had only a fold reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of aba a significant delay in radicle emergence and cotyledon greening was observed in amir _PROTEIN_ lines and but not in line . collectively these results demonstrated that the reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the amir _PROTEIN_ plants may be responsible for the observed delay in seed germination and post germination growth in the presence of aba . to better understand the roles of _PROTEIN_ in responding to aba during seed germination and seedling growth we examined the _PROTEIN_ profiles of _PROTEIN_ in various arabidopsis tissues . first the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was analysed quantitatively . although _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detectable in all tissues tested _METHOD_ significant levels of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were detected in siliques and seeds . to determine the effects of aba on _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we also measured _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tissues that were treated with aba . despite treatment with aba the level of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not significantly affected suggesting that aba might not influence the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the tissues tested . next transgenic plants carrying _PROTEIN_ gus were generated and analysed . abundant gus signals were observed in developing embryos and mature seeds as well as in germinating seeds and seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ gus signal progressively declined during the process of seed germination . notably the _PROTEIN_ gus signal was restricted to the meristem and the vascular tissues of leaves and roots at day of germination . thus the preferential _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ gus in embryos and germinating seeds may suggest a specific function for _PROTEIN_ in seed germination and seedling growth . to better understand the function of _PROTEIN_ we characterized the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ko plants rescued the phenotype of cotyledon greening demonstrating that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was functional . subsequently the cellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was analysed in epidermal cells of day old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings . in addition to localization at the cell periphery scattered speckles of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also observed in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells in roots and leaves . to determine the nature of the speckles we tested several organelle markers which were transformed individually into the cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . our results indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized with the mitochondrial marker mito tracker red in protoplasts isolated from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants suggesting a possible mitochondrial localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to further clarify the cellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we analysed cellular fractions by immunoblotting . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was detected in purified fractions of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . furthermore the cellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also confirmed via _METHOD_ staining . in this experiment the signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marks the location of mitochondria . indeed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were observed to co localize in root epidermal cells . our results suggested that _PROTEIN_ associates with mitochondria in the cell . full length _PROTEIN_ contains an n terminal domain and a domain . to test the contribution of the n terminal and domains to the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we examined n terminal and domain truncations using transient _PROTEIN_ assays . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ n or _METHOD_ plasmid was delivered into arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells using the biolistic bombardment method . the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ n appeared in the cytoplasm and cell periphery . in parallel scattered speckles of _METHOD_ were observed in the cell which resembled the pattern seen in epidermal cells of full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . to distinguish the characteristics of the speckles we co transformed the _METHOD_ and mito dsred plasmids into the epidermal cells of onion peels using the biolistic bombardment method . as shown in figure _METHOD_ and mito dsred were observed to co localize in the transformed onion epidermal cells demonstrating that the domain is crucial for directing _PROTEIN_ to mitochondria . because shares the highest homology to we also examined the cellular distributions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . interestingly the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were detected near the cell periphery and in the _LOCATION_ but not in the mitochondria . taken together these results demonstrate that the distinctive mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ might reflect its unique function in arabidopsis . although numerous studies have reported essential roles for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in aba signalling the role of ropgefs in modulating the activity of rop during the aba response is poorly understood . therefore we decided to investigate the consequences of associating _PROTEIN_ with rops that are involved in aba signalling . we showed that _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ led _PROTEIN_ to localize near the cell periphery suggesting that binding of rop alters the localization of _PROTEIN_ . to validate this hypothesis we tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and introduced the tagged constructs into mesophyll protoplasts isolated from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . again no speckles were observed in the transformed protoplasts . instead the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cytoplasm and cell periphery . to further test this effect we generated hybrid lines by crossing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines . as shown in figure rather than the speckled _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was obviously distributed near the cell periphery in all the tested hybrid lines . similarly the speckled _METHOD_ signal was also diminished when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in onion peel epidermal cells . overall these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ translocation in cells might be essential for the modulation of rop activity . to explore the contribution of the domain to the aba response we also evaluated the influence of the domain on cotyledon greening . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the plasmid in the wt and _PROTEIN_ ko backgrounds were generated and characterized . interestingly overexpression in _PROTEIN_ ko mutants failed to rescue the cotyledon greening phenotype . it is likely that the domain is not sufficient to fulfil the function of _PROTEIN_ in planta . in general ropgef rops exert their functions by coupling with downstream effectors . we speculate that the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ may also play a role in mediating the activation of downstream effectors at least in the aba mediated suppression of seed germination and seedling growth . to investigate how _PROTEIN_ is affected in response to aba we evaluated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the mrna and protein levels . we found that _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was not greatly altered by aba treatment . however levels of _PROTEIN_ protein were significantly _PROTEIN_ in day old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings treated for h with various concentrations of aba . because the reduced _PROTEIN_ protein level was detectable at aba we used this concentration to track the kinetics of decline of _PROTEIN_ over time . significant _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels were observed within h of aba treatment and _PROTEIN_ protein was barely detectable h after treatment . to determine the degradation pathway of _PROTEIN_ protein triggered by aba we examined the effect of proteasome inhibition on the stability of _PROTEIN_ protein . prior to the aba treatment day old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings were pre treated with for h and then the level of _PROTEIN_ protein was examined at various time points . degradation of _PROTEIN_ protein was slowed by the addition of prior to the aba treatment . hence the contribution of the ubiquitin proteasome system to aba induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ was further evaluated . immunoprecipitation assays were performed to detect the ubiquitination of proteins using a specific anti ubiquitin antibody . as shown in figure aba was indeed able to trigger the ubiquitination of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . we hypothesize that aba triggers the degradation of _PROTEIN_ via the ubiquitin proteasome system to attenuate rop signalling . to investigate the correlation of _PROTEIN_ localization and its degradation in response to aba we purified and examined _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial fractions from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings that were treated with or without aba for h. we observed a marked _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ fraction . however detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ protein remained in the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial fractions . therefore aba triggered _PROTEIN_ degradation most likely took place in the _LOCATION_ . because the distribution of _PROTEIN_ could be altered upon binding to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ we sought to investigate the correlation between the stability of _PROTEIN_ and its binding to its target rops . to this end we analysed the behaviour of _PROTEIN_ protein in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ hybrid lines with or without aba treatment . notably the aba triggered degradation of _PROTEIN_ protein was eliminated in seedlings from the hybrid lines suggesting that co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and rop stabilized the _PROTEIN_ protein which was consistent with the phenomena observed for the translocation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rop hybrid lines . these results suggest that the degradation of _PROTEIN_ may be averted when _PROTEIN_ is bound by its target rops even in the presence of aba .
