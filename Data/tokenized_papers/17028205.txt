the centromeric histone _PROTEIN_ substitutes histone within the nucleosomes of active centromeres in all eukaryotes . _PROTEIN_ deposition at centromeres is needed to assemble the kinetochore a complex of conserved proteins responsible for correct chromosome segregation during _LOCATION_ division . histones of regular nucleosomes are loaded during replication in s phase while _PROTEIN_ deposition deviates from this pattern in yeast human and drosophila melanogaster cells . little is known about when and how _PROTEIN_ targets centromeric loci . therefore we determined the location and quantity of recombinant enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in mitotic root and endopolyploid leaf _LOCATION_ of transgenic arabidopsis thaliana cells . our data indicate significant loading of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ rather than during the s or m phase of the cell cycle . the histone fold domain of the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to target a. thaliana centromeres . a. thaliana _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ can recognize and target three different centromeric repeats of arabidopsis lyrata but not field bean centromeres .
a. thaliana plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed for incorporation of _PROTEIN_ into the centromeric regions of meristematic and endoreduplicated _LOCATION_ from roots and young and mature leaves respectively . flow cytometric analysis revealed almost of living leaf _LOCATION_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . most living root tip _LOCATION_ analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy displayed up to signal foci . during mitosis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized exclusively at the presumed centromeres suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of recombinant _PROTEIN_ in the selected transgenic lines is not above the physiological level . protein gel blot analysis revealed a single band of kd corresponding to endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the control and transgenic lines while no fusion protein was detectable . also with anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ that recognizes _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not detectable on protein gel blots . this indicates an _PROTEIN_ level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that is much lower than that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . since _METHOD_ _METHOD_ bleaches very fast we performed immunostaining experiments with anti _METHOD_ antibodies and found _METHOD_ signals at centromeres during interphase and mitosis . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ prophase and metaphase _LOCATION_ double signals with a distance between the single spots of up to appeared . immunosignals for _PROTEIN_ were observed in of root tip _LOCATION_ in most of them exclusively at chromocenters . immunosignals for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ occur at the edges of _METHOD_ in situ hybridization signals for centromeric bp repeats that in turn occupy part of the diamidino phenylindole positive chromocenters . in case of double immunosignals these are connected by centromere specific fish signals . within meiotic _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signals were localized at the core of bright dapi stained heterochromatic regions of leptotene pachytene and diakinesis chromosomes and occasionally less dense along the chromosome _METHOD_ . in leptotene up to separate signals were found while in pachytene the signals of homologous chromosomes were fused . during diakinesis five double signals were localized on centromeres . the intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunosignals per _LOCATION_ during meiotic prophase is comparable to that of mitotic prophase _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ isolated from fully developed leaves of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformants were sorted according to their ploidy level and immunostained using antibodies against _METHOD_ . compact _METHOD_ signals were observed in and most of _LOCATION_ while in _LOCATION_ the signals were often less compact and split into smaller foci . the total volume of all _METHOD_ signals per _LOCATION_ was measured on optical stacks of labeled _LOCATION_ by three dimensional microscopy . assuming that the total volume of immunosignals directly reflects the amount of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ within a _LOCATION_ no increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ content from to endopolyploidy level was found . the increase measured in _LOCATION_ could be due to _PROTEIN_ signal compaction . the average _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunosignal volume of randomly selected _LOCATION_ of different sizes from squashed leaves was similar as in flow sorted to _LOCATION_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was measured by flow cytometry the relative _METHOD_ intensity increased with ploidy level but reaches only of the value expected in _LOCATION_ if _PROTEIN_ content doubled along with the dna content . to exclude that during endocycles centromeric bp tandem repeats colocalizing with and binding to _PROTEIN_ remain underreplicated as in some polytene chromosomes and therefore that _PROTEIN_ loading is not required fish signal volumes were determined for isolated leaf _LOCATION_ of to level . in contrast with the _PROTEIN_ signal volumes the fish signal volumes in and _LOCATION_ were found to be proportionally increased with the dna content . surprisingly in repeated experiments from to level no proportional increase of centromeric fish signals could be detected . however when considering the histogram peak positions of to _LOCATION_ after dna staining no underreplication that could explain the low increase in _PROTEIN_ content was detectable . since _PROTEIN_ amounts do not increase proportionally with the c values and with the amounts of centromeric repeats in endoreplicated _LOCATION_ most of _PROTEIN_ is not loaded to centromeres during s phase of endoreduplicating _LOCATION_ . because no significant underreplication was detectable an obvious difference to mitotic s phase is not apparent . proportions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunosignals _METHOD_ and bp centromeric repeat fish signals within leaf _LOCATION_ isolated from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic a. thaliana and sorted according to their endopolyploidy level se to test whether loading of _PROTEIN_ may occur during mitosis the volumes of _PROTEIN_ specific signals were determined for prophase and telophase _LOCATION_ from root tips . no significant differences as to the relative amounts of _PROTEIN_ were detectable between prophase and telophase _LOCATION_ . this excludes a major tension mediated _PROTEIN_ deposition during mitosis . large _PROTEIN_ root tip _LOCATION_ with doubled _METHOD_ signals revealed similar total signal volumes as observed in prophase _LOCATION_ but much larger ones than found in _LOCATION_ . for some _LOCATION_ of these different types in parallel to signal volume measurement the intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals was determined and yielded a similar ratio . proportions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunosignals _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and prophase versus _PROTEIN_ and telophase _LOCATION_ of a. thaliana root tip _METHOD_ transgenic for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ se to confirm that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal ratios reflect the loading of _PROTEIN_ to centromeres indirect immunostaining using antibodies against a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ was applied to a. thaliana wild type _LOCATION_ . the signal volumes and signal intensities in presumed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ root tip _LOCATION_ with up to signals were nearly identical whereas in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ with signals both values were about doubled . thus our data indicate that most of _PROTEIN_ is loaded during _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rather than during s phase or mitosis . to test whether the highly variable n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ or rather the c terminal part which differs from _PROTEIN_ as to the composition of the so called loop region is responsible for recognition of centromere positions dna fragments encoding both parts were separately fused with _METHOD_ and used to transform a. thaliana . while the n terminal part yielded _METHOD_ equally distributed over the entire _LOCATION_ the c terminal part was targeted to chromocenters . thus the c terminal histone fold domain including the variable loop region is apparently sufficient to direct the _PROTEIN_ to centromeres even when its n terminal part is absent . since computer analysis of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ did not reveal any _LOCATION_ localization signal _PROTEIN_ might be transported to _LOCATION_ by a carrier . the _PROTEIN_ protein is highly conserved within the genus arabidopsis . a. thaliana and a. lyrata share of amino acid residues of the c terminal region and of the n terminal region . to test whether a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ can recognize the three different types of centromeric repeats of a. lyrata young seedlings of a. lyrata were transiently transformed with the corresponding construct of a. thaliana . transformed a. lyrata _LOCATION_ showed up to _METHOD_ signals . this indicates that all a. lyrata centromeres are recognized irrespective of their repeat composition . however a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ did not target the centromeres of a species as distantly related as vicia faba . after transformation of hairy roots with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found only within the cytoplasm .
the _METHOD_ dna sequence was amplified with the primer pair accactagtatggtgagcaagggcgaggag and actggatcccttgtacagctcgtccatgcc from the vector generating an spei linker sequence at the end and a bamhi linker sequence at the end . the stop codon of _METHOD_ was not included . the amplified fragment was inserted downstream the promoter in the unique spei and bamhi sites of the bam vector . to generate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct the _PROTEIN_ sequence _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was amplified from cdna obtained by reverse transcription of rna isolated from flower buds with the primer pair _PROTEIN_ and ccggtcgactcaccatggtctgccttttcc including an xmai restriction site at the end and a sali site at the end for cloning into the bam _METHOD_ vector in frame with _METHOD_ . the resulting _PROTEIN_ cassette including promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and nos terminator was subcloned into the vector containing the phosphinotricine resistance marker via the sfii restriction site . to generate constructs for only n or c terminal parts of _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ the same primers as for full length _PROTEIN_ and additional primers _PROTEIN_ were used . the resulting pcr fragments were cloned into the same vectors as above . plants of a. thaliana accession col were transformed according to the flower dip method . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_

mg gold particles using a _PROTEIN_ system according to manufacturer 's instructions . after bombardment seedlings were incubated for h under standard light/dark conditions prior to _METHOD_ localization via _METHOD_ microscopy . vicia faba hairy roots transgenic for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained as described except that the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carried the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ vector in addition to the wild type plasmid . the hairy roots originating from cells cotransformed by both plasmids were selected based on their continuous growth on hormone free medium supplemented with mg/l phosphinotricine . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was examined either in vivo or after fixation of root tips in formaldehyde for min at . for in vivo _METHOD_ analysis to d old seedlings

from roots and leaves seeds of a. thaliana wild type accession col and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were germinated in petri dishes on wet filter paper or on agar medium for to d at room temperature . for flow cytometric measurements of the relative _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were isolated from unfixed leaves or roots . flow cytometry was performed on the flow sorter facsaria equipped with a and nm laser for excitation of dapi and _METHOD_ respectively . dapi was measured at nm and _METHOD_ at nm . seeds of the wild type and transformed a. thaliana were
