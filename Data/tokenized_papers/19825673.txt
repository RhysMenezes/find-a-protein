proteomics allows the large scale study of protein _PROTEIN_ either in whole _METHOD_ or in purified organelles . in particular _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of gel separated proteins produces data not only for protein identification but for protein structure location and processing as well . an in depth analysis was performed on _METHOD_ data from etiolated hypocotyl cell wall proteomics of arabidopsis thaliana . these analyses show that highly homologous members of multigene families can be differentiated . two lectins presenting amino acid identity were identified using peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting . although the identification of structural proteins such as extensins or hydroxyproline/proline rich proteins is arduous different types of _METHOD_ spectra were exploited to identify and characterize an h/prp . maturation events in a couple of cell wall proteins were analyzed using site mapping . n glycosylation of cwps as well as the hydroxylation or oxidation of amino acids were also explored adding information to improve our understanding of cwp structure/function relationships . a bioinformatic tool was developed to locate by means of _METHOD_ the n terminus of mature secreted proteins and n glycosylation .
most plant genes including those encoding cwps belong to multigene families . these can be very large and they can include closely related members . for example in a. thaliana there are predicted peroxidase genes pectin methylesterase genes xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase genes and polygalacturonase genes . it is usually difficult to study the regulation of close members of these gene families at the protein level . classical approaches using immunology are not efficient because of high amino acid similarity but pmf using maldi tof _METHOD_ provides a powerful alternative . indeed subtle _METHOD_ differences between peptides can be measured the accuracy of _METHOD_ determination being as small as ppm . as an example the identification in the same sample of two closely related lectin homologs is reported in . and share amino acid identity . on _METHOD_ spectra seven peptides common to both proteins were found whereas four and three peptides were respectively specific to and . note that in one case the two versions of a peptide could be easily distinguished _PROTEIN_ namely a difference of da in _METHOD_ . in our study all cwps could be identified unambiguously but some intracellular contaminants of our cell wall preparation could not be discriminated because they belong to multigene families comprising closely related members . either there was not enough protein coverage to find specific peptides or the amino acid sequences of the proteins were too close such as malate dehydrogenase rubisco small subunit actin . the last case was that of proteins with repetitive domains such as polyubiquitins and ubiquitin extension proteins . to become biologically active some enzymes need to lose a pro sequence and are submitted to post translational maturation events . pmf can be used as a tool to show such events by mapping the identified peptides on the sequence of the proteins . to be reliable it must be carried out on several independent samples . two examples of possible cwp maturation events are shown in . in our proteomic study on etiolated a. thaliana hypocotyls six different putative pectin methylesterases were identified . five of them are type i pmes with both a predicted n terminal pectinesterase inhibitor domain and a c terminal pectinesterase domain . the cleavage of the pro sequence was shown to depend on the presence of one or two conserved basic tetrad motifs . in none of the cases did we find peptides in the pmei domains . in seven independent identifications of all the peptides were mapped to the predicted pme domain namely between amino acids and thus allowing a coverage of of this region . in addition the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of these pmes after e in denaturing conditions was around kda consistent with a maturation event of the protein . for a long time it was thought that there was no pmei domain in cell wall pmes . it was assumed that pmei domains of pmes could inhibit their enzyme activity thus preventing the premature de esterification of pectins before their secretion . however it was recently shown that maturation of pmes inside the secretory pathway is required for their secretion . our results are consistent with the single presence of mature pmes in cell walls . they strongly support the assumption that maturation occurs before protein secretion . however this must be confirmed by edman degradation sequencing to provide the actual n terminus of the processed protein . the second example of protein maturation is provided by xylosidase . in our samples xylosidase was repeatedly identified as the only component present in three wide _METHOD_ blue stained bands obtained after e in denaturing conditions . apparent molecular _METHOD_ were between and kda . cartography of identified peptides on independent fractions indicates that proteins in lack n terminal peptides . differences in molecular _METHOD_ between and are thus probably due either to the n terminal processing of the protein or to n glycosylations . in _PROTEIN_ there are eight predicted n glycosylation sites in the protein . we found that at least one of these sites is occupied . stars in point to n glycosylated _METHOD_ of the protein on the snhetlf _PROTEIN_ slvfk peptide located between amino acids and . in addition was identified in a previous proteomic study performed on a stem protein fraction retained on concanavalin a . we suspect that different states of n glycosylation may occur on the other predicted sites . furthermore our _METHOD_ data were compared to results of the n terminal sequencing of a cabbage xylosidase which is also a member of brassicaceae . this enzyme shows identity with and an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda after e in denaturing conditions . edman sequencing showed that this n terminal sequence was isgseltfsyttdpfsfavkrrl . it shares identity with an peptide located between amino acids and . the removal of the peptide upstream of this sequence would cause a _METHOD_ shift of kda which fits in with the difference observed between molecular _METHOD_ of and . altogether it suggests that is processed at its n terminus in cell walls . the processing of cell wall enzymes that act on polysaccharides was already shown . an l arabinofuranosidase _PROTEIN_ and a d xylosidase from barley are post translationally processed at their c terminus . such c terminal processing was also suggested for the d xylosidases _PROTEIN_ and . in this case not all the c termini of the proteins were covered by maldi tof _METHOD_ pmf . an endo xylanase of barley aleurone was shown to be processed both at its n and c termini . in addition cell wall proteomic studies have shown that proteases represent about of identified cwps none of which has known substrates . in conclusion our data support the hypotheses of an n terminal processing of the xylosidase in muro and of the presence of n glycans . in order to facilitate _METHOD_ data analysis and easily identify post translational maturation or modification events we developed a bioinformatic tool called proternyc which is freely accessible . this software predicts the location of the n terminus in mature secreted protein and the n glycosylated peptides using the data obtained by _METHOD_ . the n terminus is predicted by targetp . with this tool it is possible to overcome the limitations of searches in databases that do not take into account the signal peptide cut or peptide glycosylation . after running proternyc on a given protein sequence and on a _METHOD_ list generated by _METHOD_ experiments it can be seen that some observed peaks can be attributed to putative n terminal peptide and n glycopeptides . aside from all the pmf data used for the cartography of a protein sequence it is sometimes very instructive to go further into the _METHOD_ spectra . when exploring the _METHOD_ data for etiolated hypocotyl cwp fractions we observed some significant peaks not always used for protein identification . a detailed analysis of these data revealed that they are consistent with _METHOD_ such as n glycosylation or amino acid hydroxylation or oxidation . several peroxidases were found . shows the _METHOD_ spectrum allowing the identification of one of these peroxidases encoded by . among the major peaks displayed in this spectrum five were found to fit with non modified peptides of leading to its identification . other peaks in this spectrum were shown to belong to other proteins also identified in this sample except for four peaks of high m/z . since carries four putative n glycosylation sites we looked for possible glycopeptides . using the m/z of the four peaks listed above and those of canonical n glycans observed in plants we calculated that each of these four peaks may correspond to two modified peptides and . both peptides possess one n glycosylation consensus sequence and are supposed to carry two different complex motifs of n glycosylation . interestingly in their unmodified form and were absent from the spectrum suggesting that in our experimental conditions these glycosylation sites are always occupied . to confirm that these four peaks correspond to glycopeptides we analyzed a total protein extract after hydrogen fluoride deglycosylation . _METHOD_ analysis of the corresponding sample showed that all four peaks were absent . this suggests that glycosylations were removed during the hf treatment confirming the nature of these modifications . it has been reported that n glycans are asymmetrically distributed on soybean seed coat peroxidase whereas they are more uniformly distributed over horseradish peroxidase . in addition a study performed on cationic peanut peroxidase showed that n glycans are essential to attain full catalytic ability and thermostability and to influence protein folding . other examples demonstrate the importance of protein n glycosylation in plants . the presence of n glycans on the jack bean mannosidase was shown to influence the enzyme activity as well as its oligomerization . it was also proposed that n glycosylation motifs on a plant cell wall polygalacturonase inhibitor protein _PROTEIN_ may favor interaction with its fungal polygalacturonase target during host pathogen interaction . finally several studies on defective glycosylation mutants have shown that the n glycosylation pathway regulates protein quality control salt tolerance cell wall deposition development and plant pathogen interactions . our results show that _METHOD_ can be used to predict glycosylation and to gain new insight into the structural and functional characterization of proteins . however until now it was difficult to recognize n glycopeptides using a systematic proteomic approach . software such as proteinprospector and mascot provide a series of simple _PROTEIN_ options to search for peptides with modified _METHOD_ including modified amino acids . in depth _PROTEIN_ analysis such as glycosylations requires the use of specific tools since this information is not yet referenced in databases . for a given protein the proternyc tool described above can be used to calculate all putative n glycopeptides and to identify them in a _METHOD_ list obtained from _METHOD_ experiments . it should be noted that _METHOD_ tolerance for peptides with high m/z may need to be increased since accuracy of _METHOD_ determination _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ increases . this software will undoubtedly be a precious tool to search for glycopeptides . many cwps contain hydroxylated pro which can be o glycosylated . the polygalacturonase was identified by pmf using peptides among cwps from etiolated hypocotyls . among these peptides one was predicted to exist under several _METHOD_ . indeed the _METHOD_ spectrum displays an isotopic _METHOD_ with a monoisotopic peak at m/z associated with two isotopic _METHOD_ at a distance of and da respectively . such modifications may respectively correspond to the oxidation or hydroxylation of one or two amino acids . the p peptide has a theoretical monoisotopic _METHOD_ of da . we performed maldi tof tof _METHOD_ experiments on each of these peptides in order to confirm that these three isotopic _METHOD_ correspond to the same peptide and locate oxidations or hydroxylations of amino acids . a clear fragmentation pattern was obtained from the p peptide confirming the proposed sequence . both _METHOD_ spectra of the modified _METHOD_ present the two most abundant fragments previously observed for the p peptide . however one of these fragments differed by or da from the corresponding peaks found on the p peptide fragmentation pattern . these results confirmed the presence of oxidations or hydroxylations and allowed their localization in a region of five possible amino acid residues . the oxidized or hydroxylated amino acids in this sequence probably are the pro his trp and asp which respectively give rise to hyp oxohistidine hydroxytryptophan and hydroxyaspartate . hyp is widespread in the plant kingdom . pro hydroxylation is a _PROTEIN_ performed by prolyl hydroxylases in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a code based on primary sequences was proposed for pro hydroxylation and consecutive o glycosylation in hyp rich glycoproteins and in hyp/pro rich proteins . in the case of only one pro may be hydroxylated in the p peptide within the asp pro ser context which has never been described in plant proteins . in addition the presence of hyp in a cwp different from the well known hrgps and h/prps is noteworthy . a few cases have been reported in the literature such as that of the dodeca cle peptides involved in cell differentiation . hyp was found in the val pro ser and gly pro asn sequences . so far pro hydroxylation in the cle peptides _METHOD_ to have no effect on their biological activity . unlike hyp the presence of oxohistidine hydroxytryptophan and hydroxyaspartate in a plant protein has never been reported . several examples of metal catalyzed oxidation of his to oxohistidines were described for human proteins . hydroxytryptophan is described as a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin and as an intermediary in tryptophan metabolism . hydroxyaspartate residues were found in epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ domains of several mammalian proteins . it was proposed that this modification regulates negatively the fucosylation of these regions . in plants oxidative modifications are known to occur in the presence of reactive oxygen species and metals in particular in cell walls . in the case of suspected oxidized or hydroxylated amino acids do not belong to the active site according to bioinformatic prediction . we can note that in the closest plant homologs of the pentapeptide dpshw is conserved suggesting its importance for protein function . however since no structural data are available and no catalytic residues have been identified for any plant polygalacturonase it is still difficult to predict a role for these amino acids . in all the plant cell wall proteomes described so far structural cell wall glycoproteins such as extensins and h/prps represent only of the presently identified cwps and remain under represented . many reasons may explain this situation the extraction of structural proteins is difficult since they can be strongly bound to the cell wall the separation by electrophoresis in denaturing conditions can be disturbed by the presence of glycosylations digestion into peptides suitable for standard _METHOD_ experiments can be limited because of the low frequency of protease cut sites into repetitive sequences rendering protein identification by pmf difficult . alternative strategies must be used to identify and characterize these proteins such as peptide sequencing by tandem _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in linear mode . the h/prp also named was identified in etiolated hypocotyls and a smear was observed after e with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of between and kda . aside from the pro rich region covering most of the protein also contains a cleavable n terminal signal peptide and a c terminal sequence that shows homology with the gasa peptides previously described in plants . analysis of the primary sequence of the pro rich region indicates that it contains only two tryptic cut sites since this protease can not cleave lys pro linkages . altogether in the entire sequence only lys/arg residues can be used for tryptic digestion . in addition some cleavage sites are very close together generating peptides too small to be observed in the standard reflectron mode maldi tof m/z window between and da . instead the two tryptic cut sites in the pro rich region release two large tryptic peptides and which are also out of that m/z range . despite these sequence constraints three peptides from the c terminal sequence suitable for the standard reflectron mode maldi tof _METHOD_ were found in the previously obtained spectra . their sequences were confirmed by maldi tof tof _METHOD_ fragmentation . in addition n terminal sequencing by edman degradation enabled localizing the n terminus of the protein downstream of the n terminus predicted by bioinformatics revealing a possible n terminal processing or degradation . thus both tandem _METHOD_ and edman degradation results allowed correctly identifying . in order to find the and peptides in the pro rich region of we performed additional maldi tof _METHOD_ experiments this time in linear mode instead of the reflectron mode used in pmf standard conditions . the presence of consecutive pro in the pro rich region suggests that similarly to other cell wall h/prps some of them may be hydroxylated . up to and hyp residues can be expected on and respectively respectively increasing their _METHOD_ up to and da . this calculation excludes hyp in the leu pro and lys pro contexts according to previous work . the _METHOD_ spectrum for clearly shows two major peaks in the m/z range . the peak centered on the mean m/z possibly corresponds to . this m/z which is higher than the peptide theoretical _METHOD_ suggests the presence of o glycosylations in this region . in addition the width of the observed peak reflects _METHOD_ heterogeneity probably due to different states of o glycosylation . the di protonated form of is also observed . however the corresponding peak in the m/z range may also contain the signal of the mono protonated form of which can overlap with that of the di protonated . the spectrum obtained for has a peak at m/z namely within the m/z range corresponding to . interestingly for this peptide a shift of _METHOD_ of about da is observed between and indicating a lower level of o glycosylation in . in the di protonated form of is resolved from the mono protonated form of at m/z . the peak centered on m/z namely within the m/z range may be attributed to the mono protonated form of . this _METHOD_ range coincides with the expected _METHOD_ of calculated in the n terminus determined by edman degradation . considering the primary sequence of and the known codes for hydroxylation of pro and subsequent o glycosylations may be o gycosylated in different ways . the presence of the thr pro modules suggests the presence of arabinogalactans as in _PROTEIN_ . however the staining of the protein with the yariv reagent was negative . the presence of lys pro pro thr motifs as in the maize thrgp suggests the presence of arabinosylated hyp . however similar motifs are present in and in which were found to contain and of galactose respectively . staining of a fraction enriched in with a lectin specific for galactose was positive indicating the possible presence of galactose . finally the presence of both arabinose and galactose can not be excluded as for the chlamydomonas reinhardtii hrgp . the _METHOD_ results reported here suggest the presence of o glycosylation on an h/prp . as for and varying degrees of o glycosylation were observed for . the _PROTEIN_ content of is estimated to be as much as under that observed for and but much higher than that observed for soybean _PROTEIN_ . a functional study of glycosylations should prove interesting since the role of o glycosylation of h/prps has so far never been investigated . in the case of extensins o glycosylation was shown to keep proteins in an extended conformation . further work is necessary to elucidate the structure of the pro rich region and of its glycosylations . however other biochemical approaches should be considered since _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ alone will not fully reveal the structural features of this recalcitrant protein such as the location of hyp residues . the various examples presented in this article illustrate that _METHOD_ is a powerful tool to gain new insight into the structure of cwps in relation to their function . however _METHOD_ does not always allow the full coverage of a protein sequence the complete description of _METHOD_ and the identification of all the proteins in a complex protein mixture . it appears that some proteins or peptides present in a sample fail to be analyzed . in certain cases the _METHOD_ results should be confirmed with additional experiments . n or c terminal sequencing can be used to determine the location of the ends of a protein and consequently uphold biological processes such as maturation events . to go further into the three dimensional structure of proteins other methods can be used such as _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance or x ray crystal diffraction . however the amount of purified proteins required for these analyses can be limiting as compared to _METHOD_ chemical proteomics that consists of the analysis by _METHOD_ of proteins specifically tagged at their site of modification is an emerging field that offers striking insights into the functional biology of _METHOD_ . in conclusion _METHOD_ will increasingly be used as a diagnosis tool to address biological questions given its simple use high throughput capacity unequaled sensitivity and the continuous technical developments in the field .
