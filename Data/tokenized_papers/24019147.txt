brassinosteroids are essential phytohormones for plant growth and development . brs are perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ and downstream signal transduction through multiple components leads to activation of the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ activity is highly controlled by br through reversible phosphorylation protein degradation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling . to further understand the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ we performed tandem affinity purification of the _PROTEIN_ complex and identified _PROTEIN_ associated proteins using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these _PROTEIN_ associated proteins included several known br signaling components such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as a large number of proteins with previously unknown functions in br signal transduction including the kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ histone deacetylase cysteine proteinase inhibitor a dead box rna helicase cysteine endopeptidases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ calmodulin binding transcription activator ubiquitin protease cyclophilin and phospholipid binding protein synaptotagmin a . their interactions with _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by in vivo and in vitro assays . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was found to phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ in vitro . this study demonstrates an effective method for purifying proteins associated with low abundance transcription _PROTEIN_ and identifies new _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins with potentially important roles in br response .
previous studies have shown that a single amino acid change in _PROTEIN_ increased accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein and a phenotype of br activation . with the aim of identifying _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins in arabidopsis we first generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the epitope tagged fusion protein _PROTEIN_ mh . as expected the transgenic plants displayed a similar phenotype to that of _PROTEIN_ and control plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ including dark green and downward curving leaves in the light and reduced sensitivity to the br biosynthesis inhibitor propiconazole _PROTEIN_ in the dark . together these findings indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mh fusion protein functions in the same way as _PROTEIN_ does in planta and that the mh at the c terminus did not interfere with the function of the protein . we therefore generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mh in wild type col plants these plants had the same appearance as the untransformed wild type and transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . both _PROTEIN_ mh and _PROTEIN_ mh were detected in the extracts prepared from corresponding transgenic plants but not in extracts prepared from control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . altogether about mg of crude protein was applied to a ml settled ni column and around mg of protein was eluted and mixed with of settled anti c myc agarose . around mg was eluted after washing . a significant amount of the _PROTEIN_ mh and _PROTEIN_ mh proteins flowed through the beads suggesting that the binding capacity of the columns was saturated at both steps . when the purified proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ most of the bands were the same between the _PROTEIN_ mh and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or between the _PROTEIN_ mh and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ samples . nevertheless _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis identified proteins specifically in the _PROTEIN_ mh purification and proteins non specifically in both the sample and control . following _PROTEIN_ mh purification lc _METHOD_ analysis identified unique proteins that were not detected in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ control and nonspecific proteins present in both among them proteins were also detected in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ control . those proteins that specifically copurified with _PROTEIN_ mh or _PROTEIN_ mh included previously known br signaling components such as _PROTEIN_ and its homologs _PROTEIN_ related protein kinases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and several subunits of _PROTEIN_ . the role of _PROTEIN_ in dephosphorylating _PROTEIN_ and activating br signaling has been reported . the identification of several known _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins demonstrates that the purification of _PROTEIN_ mh was successful . the copurified proteins also included new putative _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the rna binding dead box protein _PROTEIN_ two ubiquitin specific proteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ two cysteine endopeptidases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and topless _PROTEIN_ . these proteins have not been previously shown to function in the br pathway . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were copurified with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as were _PROTEIN_ homologues and _PROTEIN_ members . those detected only in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ purification may have different binding abilities with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or were because of incomplete detection of the components of the complex . the spectra of specific proteins identified by only one peptide are shown in supplemental fig . . the nonspecific proteins pulled down in both the experimental samples and controls were mostly abundant metabolic enzymes and structural proteins . we also performed purification using transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ taph which displayed similar phenotype to the control plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with kinks at the base of the shoot branches . western blotting of the _PROTEIN_ taph purification revealed that the target protein was enriched by the ni charged resin but was partly cleaved the application of the protease actev led to _PROTEIN_ taph degradation such that the fusion protein was undetectable in gel blots by biotin cam many bands in the elution of ni column were strongly recognized by biotin cam but weakly by _PROTEIN_ suggesting that large amounts of protein were enriched through association with the cbp tag the purified _PROTEIN_ taph complex displayed more protein bands in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than the purified _PROTEIN_ mh complex . lc _METHOD_ of one of the obviously enriched bands in the _PROTEIN_ taph sample identified a heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ which was reported by other groups in classic tap tag purification in tobacco and rice and also appeared as a nonspecific protein in our mh tag purification . _PROTEIN_ was likely pulled down through its association with the tap tag or with other proteins but not with _PROTEIN_ because _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in elute . overall purification of _PROTEIN_ taph was unsuccessful . to confirm our affinity purification _METHOD_ spectrometric data we tested _PROTEIN_ interactions with selected proteins using combinations of several assays including yeast two hybrid in vitro pull down bi molecular florescence complementation and co immunoprecipitation assays . the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are components of the mapk module were analyzed further . first in vitro pull down assays showed that the mbp _PROTEIN_ protein strongly interacts with _PROTEIN_ but only weakly with _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ protein used as negative control showed no interaction with neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ . to further test the specificity of _PROTEIN_ interaction we tested the interactions with the two halves of _PROTEIN_ and the results showed that the n terminal domain interacts more strongly with _PROTEIN_ than the c terminal domain indicating specific _PROTEIN_ interaction with a particular domain of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein showed no interaction with _PROTEIN_ in this assay . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in bifc assays . however interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not detected in yeast or co ip assays suggesting that the interaction is weak or modulated in eukaryotic cells . on the other hand co ip assays using protoplasts showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was immunoprecipitated by _PROTEIN_ mh and that _PROTEIN_ mh was immunoprecipitated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a yeast two hybrid assay showed that _PROTEIN_ interacted with the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ but not the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ . in vitro kinase assay showed that _PROTEIN_ possesses autophosphorylation activity and can phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ whereas the kinase dead form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not . these results provide evidence for _PROTEIN_ regulation by a mapk pathway . the _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ a histone deacetylase also named _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by yeast two hybrid and bifc assays and by in vitro pull down assay . furthermore _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ in vitro . consistent with interaction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing substitution in the _PROTEIN_ region interacted with _PROTEIN_ in yeast . co ip assays were therefore carried out using _PROTEIN_ mh and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants because _PROTEIN_ is more stable than _PROTEIN_ . the result demonstrated the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to test the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ function we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ levels of several _PROTEIN_ target genes in response to br in the null allele mutant _PROTEIN_ . compared with wild type col the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ of saurac _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and surl before br treatment . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . saurac also showed higher fold change in response to br in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with wild type . these results suggest that the interaction with _PROTEIN_ is required for normal function of _PROTEIN_ in regulating target gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a cysteine protease inhibitor . its interaction with _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed through an in vitro pull down assay co immunoprecipitation in transgenic arabidopsis plants and bifc assays . although both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ were present in the input extracts only dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ was detected after immunoprecipitation indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ preferentially interacts with unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ . br treatment induced dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and increased the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the co immunoprecipitation assay bifc assay showed that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ where unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ is localized whereas a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized _PROTEIN_ to the cytoplasm . it _METHOD_ that interaction with _PROTEIN_ can retains a fraction of _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ . as a protease inhibitor _PROTEIN_ is likely to affect _PROTEIN_ proteolysis . we therefore analyzed _PROTEIN_ using immunoblots in the _PROTEIN_ loss of function and over _PROTEIN_ plants before or after h br treatment . the results showed that the accumulation level and phosphorylation status of _PROTEIN_ were not significantly different in the _PROTEIN_ null allele and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants compared with wild type . _PROTEIN_ is a member of gene family and it is possible that the lack of phenotype and effect on _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant is because of genetic redundancy . the function of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction remains to be elucidated in future studies . in addition to the above interacting proteins confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro assay _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also verified to interact with _PROTEIN_ by selected methods . the putative rna helicases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast . furthermore the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not met interacted with _PROTEIN_ in bifc assays . most of these putative interacting proteins were localized to the _LOCATION_ and the interactions with _PROTEIN_ were also detected by bifc in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is a phospholipid binding protein which did not interact with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid assay . however _PROTEIN_ was identified as an interacting protein of _PROTEIN_ subunit a in a split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid assay . thus it is likely that _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ through direct binding with _PROTEIN_ . together the confirmed and potential _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins are summarized in table i . these proteins identified in this study together with _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins characterized previously and their binding domains of _PROTEIN_ are shown in a diagram of _PROTEIN_ complex in fig . .
