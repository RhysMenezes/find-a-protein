fmn hydrolases catalyze dephosphorylation of fmn to riboflavin . although these enzymes have been described in many _METHOD_ few had their corresponding genes cloned and their recombinant proteins biochemically characterized and none had their physiological roles determined . we found previously that fmn hydrolase activity in pea chloroplasts is dependent suggesting an enzyme of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily . in this study a new fmn hydrolase was purified by multistep chromatography after ammonium sulfate precipitation . the molecular weight of the native protein was estimated at a dimer of about twice the predicted molecular weight of most had superfamily phosphatases . after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the partially purified material two separate protein bands within kda were extracted from the gel and analyzed by nanolc _METHOD_ . peptide sequence matching to the protein samples suggested the presence of three had like hydrolases . cdnas for sequence homologs from arabidopsis thaliana of these proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . activity screening of the encoded proteins showed that the _GENE_ gene encodes an fmn hydrolase _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed using _METHOD_ microscopy of a. thaliana protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ the n terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ to enhanced green _METHOD_ protein . phosphatase activity of _PROTEIN_ is fmn specific as assayed with potential substrates . kinetic parameters and ph and temperature optima for _PROTEIN_ were determined . a phylogenetic analysis of putative phosphatases of the had superfamily suggested distinct evolutionary origins for the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ fmn hydrolase characterized previously .
previous work showed the presence of fmn hydrolase activity in crude extracts of pea chloroplasts . we checked the dependence of this activity on to find out whether the responsible enzyme may belong to the had superfamily as does the _LOCATION_ fmn hydrolase from a. thaliana characterized previously . diminished fmn hydrolase activity in the extracts of pea chloroplasts when edta replaced in the assays suggested that the responsible enzyme is a member of the dependent had superfamily . we first attempted to identify a candidate enzyme for fmn hydrolase activity in _LOCATION_ using bioinformatic sequence analysis of predicted had superfamily proteins . by using the superfamily hmm library in the genome assignments server through the university of bristol a sequence search for had domain containing proteins returned potential candidates in a. thaliana . similarity searches of the a. thaliana protein and dna sequences in genbank with _PROTEIN_ as the query sequence identified protein sequences . a bioinformatic analysis of these sequences predicted that at least eight enzymes localize in _LOCATION_ . the predicted _LOCATION_ enzyme most similar to the _LOCATION_ fmn hydrolase was previously reported to be a glycerol phosphate phosphatase suggesting that the fmn hydrolases from _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ have divergent protein sequences . consistently analysis of had superfamily phosphatases from e. coli has shown that multiple enzymes with divergent protein sequences hydrolyze fmn as well as a variety of other substrates . the reported enzyme activity assays the bioinformatic analysis and the reference literature collectively suggested that the _LOCATION_ fmn hydrolase belongs to the had superfamily but may be too divergent from _PROTEIN_ to be readily identified by bioinformatic sequence analysis and screening candidate enzymes for activity considering the large number of predicted had superfamily enzymes in plants . we therefore pursued protein purification from chloroplasts to identify the target enzyme . purification of chloroplasts from a. thaliana was inefficient in our hands . as a result we sought to purify the fmn hydrolase from pea chloroplasts to determine its protein sequence and to identify homologous protein sequences in the a. thaliana genome . next we sought to clone and recombinantly _PROTEIN_ the corresponding gene from a. thaliana and to biochemically characterize the encoded recombinant enzyme . fmn hydrolase was purified from extracts of pea chloroplasts by a series of chromatography steps . purification steps comprised hydrophobic interaction on butyl sepharose hydroxyapatite on cht ceramic hydroxyapatite anion exchange on mono q and gel filtration on superdex . preliminary experiments used washed or percoll isolated chloroplasts to test purification strategies with a variety of chromatography columns . these tests showed that using percoll isolated chloroplasts provided no additional benefit to enriching the extracts in fmn hydrolase activity . therefore washed chloroplasts obtained from differential centrifugation were used instead during the final scaled up purification . adding m to the chloroplast extract at the beginning of the purification work resulted in a net loss in specific activity . however this step enabled binding of the target activity to the butyl sepharose column and produced a fold enrichment in fmn hydrolase activity . the next purification step using hydroxyapatite resulted in an fold enrichment . we were unable to calculate specific activity in subsequent purification steps anion exchange and gel filtration because the protein samples became too diluted to measure concentration . all active protein fractions obtained from the purification steps were analyzed by _METHOD_ blue stained gel electrophoresis . the molecular weight of the native fmn hydrolase was estimated at by gel filtration chromatography on superdex . the estimate suggests a dimer of about twice as much as the predicted molecular weight of most putative had superfamily phosphatases from a. thaliana . two separate protein bands within kda became visible after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the partially purified protein with fmn hydrolase activity . both protein bands were extracted from the gel digested with trypsin and analyzed by nanolc _METHOD_ . because no genome information on pea was available the nanolc _METHOD_ data were compared with a custom database made of sequences from the related plants of the tribe trifolieae . a comparative analysis of the lower protein band yielded three significant hits with probability scores over against the putative had superfamily phosphatases from the tribe trifolieae . after showing high sequence similarity to the candidate fmn hydrolases from the tribe trifolieae full length cdna clones for the three proteins from a. thaliana were overexpressed in e. coli and the encoded recombinant proteins were affinity purified . the purified his tagged enzymes were cleaved with recombinant enterokinase and further purified by gel filtration or affinity chromatography to produce tag free recombinant enzymes . activity assays of the three tag free recombinant proteins showed that only _GENE_ has significant fmn hydrolase activity . this enzyme was found to localize in the _LOCATION_ stroma by a proteomic approach . its _LOCATION_ localization was confirmed by _METHOD_ microscopy of _METHOD_ fused proteins transiently _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana protoplasts . this enzyme was accordingly named _PROTEIN_ . alignment of the deduced protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana with the nearest sequence homologs from other plant species is shown in supplemental fig . . predicted subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and its sequence homologs as determined by chlorop is presented in supplemental table . protein sequences of _GENE_ _GENE_ and are shown in supplemental fig . . recombinant _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed fmn most effectively at ph and at . a sharper decline in activity was observed for the acid range and for the high end temperatures . in comparison the _LOCATION_ fmn hydrolase we characterized previously has a relatively close ph optimum at ph and a higher temperature optimum at . the apparent kinetic parameters for recombinant _PROTEIN_ as found by a nonlinear best fit to the michaelis menten model were km and vmax with derived parameters kcat and kcat/km . the initial reaction rates used to determine the apparent kinetic parameters are depicted in fig . . the km value of _PROTEIN_ for fmn is fold higher the kcat value is fold lower and the kcat/km value is fold lower than that of the _LOCATION_ fmn hydrolase from a. thaliana characterized previously which also belongs to the had superfamily . we found that _PROTEIN_ does not hydrolyze any of the other potential substrates tested . substrates comprised phosphates of representative nucleotides _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sugars _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cofactors plus phosphoglyceric acid sodium pyrophosphate and nitrophenyl phosphate . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ has evolved high specificity
