using the tip growing pollen tube of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum as a model to investigate endocytosis _METHOD_ we show that phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase _PROTEIN_ regulates clathrin dependent endocytosis in pollen tubes . green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ was preferentially localized to the subapical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in pollen tubes where it apparently converts phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ . rna interference induced suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ impaired tip growth and inhibited clathrin dependent endocytosis in pollen tubes . by contrast _PROTEIN_ overexpression induced _METHOD_ aggregation of the pm in pollen tube tips . this pm abnormality was apparently due to excessive clathrin dependent _LOCATION_ invagination because this defect was suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ of a dominant negative mutant of clathrin heavy chain . these results support a role for _PROTEIN_ in promoting early stages of clathrin dependent endocytosis _LOCATION_ . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ overexpression induced pm abnormality was partially suppressed not only by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ which breaks down _PROTEIN_ but also by that of _PROTEIN_ which increases the pool of _PROTEIN_ . based on these observations we propose that a proper balance between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is required for clathrin dependent endocytosis in the tip of pollen tubes .
to investigate the role of the tip localized _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of pollen tube tip growth we sought to identify a _PROTEIN_ responsible for the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ for this particular _PROTEIN_ pool . three arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and are specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen . recent reports suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are preferentially localized to the subapical pm of pollen tubes . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also enriched at the subapical pm while _METHOD_ alone was only found in the _LOCATION_ . in growing pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was preferentially associated with the subapical pm . by contrast in tubes that had ceased elongation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was preferentially localized to the tip of the apical pm . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ is a functional _PROTEIN_ kinase in vivo we visualized pollen _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using _METHOD_ based markers _METHOD_ ph and _METHOD_ ph _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ marked by the _METHOD_ ph domain accumulated at the apical pm of pollen tubes consistent with previous reports in pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ marked by the _METHOD_ ph domain accumulated at the apical pm and in a vesicle like structure _LOCATION_ in control pollen tubes consistent with the _PROTEIN_ localization pattern in root hair cells . although considered as specific binding proteins for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro the phosphoinositide markers used in this study may compete with native proteins for binding with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as a result overexpression of these two markers might introduce some nonspecific effects on pollen tube growth . to minimize the unspecific effects caused by marker overexpression we only used low dosage dna for transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes . in addition we avoided pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ high levels of markers in our analyses . using these two markers we examined the effect of overexpressing _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localization pattern in tobacco pollen tubes . overexpression of the full length _PROTEIN_ significantly increased _METHOD_ ph distribution to the apical pm and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ph distribution to the apical pm . overexpression of a _PROTEIN_ dead mutant _PROTEIN_ in which the conserved residue required for the catalytic activity of _PROTEIN_ is mutated seemed to have no significant effect on the distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ markers to the apical pm . these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is an active enzyme locally keeping the balance between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the pm of pollen tubes . in the course of examining _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization we found that many _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing pollen tubes exhibited _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregates at the tip . similar phenotypes were observed in tobacco pollen tubes overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to assess whether these aggregates were due to pm deformation multiple scanning at different focal planes was conducted in the tip of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox tubes . as shown in figures and in these abnormal tips _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be associated with the pm which apparently retracted from the cell wall as a result of invagination causing the overall deformation of the cytoplasm in the tip region . to confirm whether the aggregates were indeed due to invagination of the pm we coexpressed untagged _PROTEIN_ with the pm marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and found that the apical pm containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a similar invagination as did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox pollen tubes exhibited different degrees of pm deformation . to better describe the severity of this phenotype we categorized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tubes into three groups those with the normal smooth pm those with moderate apical pm deformation in which the apical pm is still a distinguishable intact _LOCATION_ compartment but is retracted from the apical cell wall and those with severe apical pm deformation in which the apical pm becomes fragmented _LOCATION_ patches . at to h after bombardment the percentage of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tubes falling into these three groups was and respectively . however pm morphology was not altered by the overexpression of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ mutant . time lapse imaging showed that the pm invagination started after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization invaded the extreme tip and became more severe over time . these results suggest that excessive amount of _PROTEIN_ activity at the tip of pollen tubes caused the deformation of the pm . the pm deformation occurred in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox tubes that had already stopped elongating . at to h after bombardment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox tubes were shorter in length and wider in tips compared with control tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . the mean length _PROTEIN_ from in control tubes to in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox tubes . the mean width increased from in control tubes to in pollen tubes overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however pollen tube growth arrest induced by other treatments such as overexpression of a dominant negative form of _PROTEIN_ did not cause pm deformation suggesting that the pm deformation is a specific effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression which is further supported by the suppression of the pm deformation by the inhibition of the early stage of clathrin dependent endocytosis . we hypothesized that one or both of the following _LOCATION_ trafficking defects could contribute to the pm deformation induced by _PROTEIN_ ox an increase in exocytosis that was not coupled with an increase in endocytosis or cell wall expansion and a defect in a _PROTEIN_ stage of endocytosis in which the apical pm was invaginated but not pinched off as observed in the dysfunction of dynamin . to investigate the effect of _PROTEIN_ ox on exocytosis we visualized exocytosis at the tip of tobacco pollen tubes using the _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching method . in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pm marker we photobleached the apical pm region and tracked the recovery of the _METHOD_ signal . in control pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone the pm associated _METHOD_ signal quickly recovered after photobleaching . the pm signal recovered to of the original signal intensity within min after photobleaching . in pollen tubes coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ even at the early times when _PROTEIN_ ox had not caused pm deformation the recovery of the apical pm associated _METHOD_ signal was slower than in control tubes . at min after photobleaching the pm signal recovered to of the original signal intensity . this observation suggested that _PROTEIN_ ox did not enhance but might suppress exocytosis in pollen tubes . in further support of this conclusion we found that _PROTEIN_ ox did not change the localization of a marker for exocytic vesicles yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ as shown in supplemental figure online . we then investigated whether _PROTEIN_ ox altered endocytosis . fm dye is commonly used as a marker for endocytosis because it is incorporated in the pm and enters the cytoplasm only through endocytosis when applied to culture media . in normal elongating tobacco pollen tubes fm dye labeled the pm particular structures and the apical cytoplasm as an inverted cone pattern that is thought to contain both recycling and secretory vesicles . ten to fifteen minutes after fm was applied to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tubes fm strongly stained the pm region and weakly stained the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression inhibited pollen tube elongation . however inhibition of fm uptake in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing tubes was the direct specific effect of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overaccumulation because treatments with brefeldin a which also induced the arrest of pollen tube elongation did not inhibit fm entry into the pollen tubes . these observations are consistent with a previous report that _PROTEIN_ ox inhibited fm dye uptake and support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ ox overactivates the early stages _LOCATION_ but inhibits the _PROTEIN_ stage _LOCATION_ of endocytosis resulting in excessive accumulation of deformed _LOCATION_ at the tip of pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ is involved in recruiting clathrin and associated proteins that are required for the formation and invagination of coated pits in yeast and animal cells . thus a simple explanation for the _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ deformation phenotype is that overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ at the tip overactivated _LOCATION_ invagination but not closure and pinching of endocytic vesicles during clathrin dependent endocytosis . we tested this hypothesis using a dominant negative form of arabidopsis clathrin heavy chain which contains the c terminal part of the clathrin heavy chain that can bind to and trap the clathrin light chain . overexpression of hub alone in tobacco pollen tubes slightly inhibited growth . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co overexpressed with hub the pm invagination phenotype was greatly suppressed . five to six hours after bombardment the percentage of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing tobacco pollen tubes that displayed little moderate and severe pm invagination was and respectively . under the same condition of pollen tubes overexpressing both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and hub showed normal smooth pm while exhibited moderate pm invagination and none had severe pm invagination . to further test this hypothesis we used a marker for early stage of clathrin dependent endocytosis arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ protein responsible for clathrin cage assembly and thus participates in the initiation of clathrin mediated endocytosis . in control tobacco pollen tubes _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized to the subapical pm similar to clathrin localization pattern . in pollen tubes co overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated in both of the apex and the subapical pm especially the invaginated sites of pm . taken together these results strongly support the hypothesis that overinitiated but aborted clathrin dependent endocytosis accounted for the pm deformation in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ox pollen tubes . if the pm localized _PROTEIN_ indeed regulates the formation of coated pits by recruiting clathrin in pollen tubes as in yeast and animal cells the suppression of pm localized _PROTEIN_ is expected to inhibit clathrin dependent endocytosis . we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ rna interference construct under the control of promoter . _PROTEIN_ rnai lines exhibit reduced _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in pollen compared with wild type arabidopsis plants . two representative lines examined showed similar phenotypes that are correlated with the reduction of mrna levels in these lines . the _PROTEIN_ rnai pollen tubes were greatly shorter than wild type columbia pollen tubes similar to the previous findings with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we also found that fm dye uptake was greatly inhibited in _PROTEIN_ rnai pollen tubes . we then analyzed the localization of clathrin heavy chain in _PROTEIN_ rnai pollen tubes using an immunostaining method . in control pollen tubes anti chc antibody staining was _PROTEIN_ localized to the subapical pm . in _PROTEIN_ rnai pollen tubes chc antibody stained weakly at the pm . in _PROTEIN_ knockout pollen tubes chc localization to the apical pm was also greatly reduced . the relative pm associated chc signal was significantly _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ mutant tubes _LOCATION_ . thus the apparent deficiency in _PROTEIN_ dependent conversion of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ led to a defect in clathrin dependent endocytosis . these results together with _PROTEIN_ ox induced excessive clathrin dependent pm invagination suggest that _PROTEIN_ production via type b _PROTEIN_ is important for the activation of the early stages of clathrin mediated endocytosis in the apical pm of pollen tubes . since _PROTEIN_ ox not only caused apparent overaccumulation of its product _PROTEIN_ but also depletion of its substrate _PROTEIN_ in the apical pm _PROTEIN_ depletion and/or _PROTEIN_ overaccumulation could contribute to the observed pm invagination induced by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . to assess which of the _PROTEIN_ ox effects was responsible for the _PROTEIN_ ox phenotype we first co overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes . plc hydrolyzes _PROTEIN_ into the second messengers inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulates in pollen and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was localized to both apical and subapical pm of tobacco pollen tubes . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ suppressed the overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ marker caused by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes the pm invagination phenotype was partially suppressed . at to h after bombardment and of tobacco pollen tubes overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed smooth normal pm moderate pm invagination and severe pm invagination respectively . by contrast and of pollen tubes overexpressing both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited smooth pm moderate pm invagination and severe pm invagination respectively . thus the apparent removal of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ overexpression greatly but did not completely suppress _PROTEIN_ ox induced pm invagination . this result supports the notion that overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ contributed to but was not solely responsible for the pm invagination phenotype . consistent with this finding we found that _PROTEIN_ ox partially suppressed the growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ ox . since suppression of _PROTEIN_ overaccumulation did not completely restore normal pollen tube tips we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ ox induced depletion of _PROTEIN_ in the apical pm of pollen tubes also contributed to the _PROTEIN_ ox phenotype . to test this hypothesis we examined the effect of overexpressing arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which rescued the reduction of _PROTEIN_ marker localization caused by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . co overexpression of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ not only partially suppressed _PROTEIN_ ox growth phenotype but also partially suppressed the pm invagination phenotype induced by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression . at to h after bombardment the percentage of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ co overexpressing tobacco pollen tubes that displayed little moderate and severe pm deformation was and respectively . furthermore treatment of wild type pollen tubes with plc inhibitor which increased _PROTEIN_ level without _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level on the pm did not cause pm invagination . these results further support the notion that overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ at the apical pm alone was insufficient to cause the pm invagination phenotype induced by _PROTEIN_ ox . taken together our data suggest that the pm invagination phenotype in _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes was the result of simultaneous overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ and reduction of its precursor _PROTEIN_ .
