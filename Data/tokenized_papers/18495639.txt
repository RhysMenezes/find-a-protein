enzymes that reduce the aldehyde chemical grouping to its corresponding alcohol could be crucial in _PROTEIN_ plant health . recently recombinant _PROTEIN_ of a _LOCATION_ enzyme from arabidopsis thaliana heynh _PROTEIN_ revealed that it effectively catalyses the in vitro reduction of both glyoxylate and succinic semialdehyde _PROTEIN_ . in this paper web based bioinformatics tools revealed a second putative _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that is identical on an amino acid basis to _PROTEIN_ . sequence encoding a putative targeting signal was deleted from the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna and the resulting truncated gene was co _PROTEIN_ with the molecular chaperones groes/el in escherichia coli enabling production and purification of soluble recombinant protein . kinetic analysis revealed that recombinant _PROTEIN_ catalysed the conversion of glyoxylate to glycolate and _PROTEIN_ to hydroxybutyrate _PROTEIN_ via an essentially irreversible nadph based mechanism . _PROTEIN_ had a fold higher preference for glyoxylate than _PROTEIN_ based on the performance constants . _METHOD_ microscopic analysis of tobacco suspension cells transiently transformed with _PROTEIN_ linked to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ via targeting information contained within its n terminal amino acids . the identification and characterization of distinct _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ glyoxylate reductase _METHOD_ is discussed with respect to aldehyde detoxification and the plant stress response .
a search of the genbank database with _PROTEIN_ enabled identification of a full length arabidopsis cdna which encodes a amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda an isoelectric point of a net charge of at neutral ph and identity and similarity to _PROTEIN_ . thus the gene encoding the polypeptide has been designated as _PROTEIN_ for a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ possesses an additional n terminal amino acids compared to _PROTEIN_ and analysis of this region using targetp chlorop and psort predicted the existence of a transit peptide that varied in length from to amino acids although the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ was ambiguous with predator and targetp favouring a mitochondrial location and chlorop and psort favouring a _LOCATION_ location . as a compromise in this study the n terminal _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ amino acids were deleted from the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna . the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide has been tentatively identified as a phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the arabidopsis information resource but there is no published biochemical evidence to support such a function . clustalw comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences for the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . numbers indicate amino acid number . the first amino acids in _PROTEIN_ represent its putative targeting sequence and the arrows indicate peptide cleavage sites as predicted by three web based _METHOD_ for predicting subcellular localization . identical and similar amino acids are shown by black and grey shading respectively . both the full length and truncated _PROTEIN_ sequences were cloned into the vector which was then introduced into e. coli . only the recombinant truncated _PROTEIN_ was soluble and this was markedly improved by co _PROTEIN_ of the groes/groel chaperone . comparison of total protein from the lysates of cells transformed with the truncated gene insert or with an empty insert revealed a prominent band at approximately kda the predicted size of the recombinant protein . therefore soluble recombinant truncated _PROTEIN_ for biochemical analysis was isolated from cells co _PROTEIN_ the chaperone and subjected to affinity chromatography enabling purification to near homogeneity . immunoblot analysis of total protein insoluble soluble or purified protein using an antibody against the tag revealed a prominent band at approximately kda . _PROTEIN_ and purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ extracted from e. coli cells co _PROTEIN_ the groes/groel chaperone complex . the top row illustrates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of protein lysates from cells transformed with the truncated gene insert or the empty insert respectively whereas the bottom row illustrates _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis of protein lysates from cells transformed with the truncated gene insert . the gels were stained with _METHOD_ blue whereas the immunoblot was probed with an anti his antibody . the el subunit of the chaperone complex and the recombinant protein are indicated . enzyme activity was reasonably stable when the concentrated protein eluate from the affinity column was aliquoted and stored at for months or at for hours . for enzyme assays the protein eluate was diluted appropriately with elution buffer so that the initial rate of reaction could be readily determined . during the assays the diluted enzyme was stored at however activity began to _PROTEIN_ within min . therefore multiple aliquots were required for detailed studies of ph and substrate specificity . maximal enzyme activity which was determined with saturating glyoxylate and nadph was observed at ph to consequently all subsequent assays were performed at ph . preliminary assays of enzyme activity were conducted with presumably saturating concentrations of glyoxylate _PROTEIN_ glycolate ghb or phosphogluconate and nadph or nadp . the protein catalysed the reduction of both glyoxylate and _PROTEIN_ using either nadph or nadh as a cofactor however much greater activity was found with nadph . for example the reaction rate at glyoxylate and nadph was times faster than with glyoxylate and nadh at the same concentration . the enzyme also catalysed the reverse reaction involving ghb and nadp but at a lower rate than the forward reaction . for example the rate with mm ghb and nadp was times slower than the forward reaction with mm _PROTEIN_ and nadph . however the enzyme was ineffective in catalysing the reverse reaction utilizing either glycolate or phosphogluconate . thus this polypeptide appears to be primarily dependent on nadph and functions in an essentially irreversible manner . dependence of _PROTEIN_ activity on ph . activity was determined using saturating glyoxylate and nadph as substrates and morpholino ethanesulphonic acid hepes n tris methyl aminobutanesulphonic acid and propanesulphonic acid as buffers . data represent the mean . of triplicate measurements from a typical enzyme preparation . characterization of the forward reaction by varying the concentration of glyoxylate or _PROTEIN_ at saturating concentration of nadph and the concentration of nadph at a saturating concentration of glyoxylate or _PROTEIN_ resulted in hyperbolic saturation kinetics with lineweaver burke and eadie hofstee transformations of the data displaying linear dependence . data from three independent enzyme preparations revealed that vmax was similar for glyoxylate and _PROTEIN_ reduction whereas the affinity for the two substrates was very different with the km for glyoxylate being times lower than that for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the vmax and km values for nadph were similar in the presence of glyoxylate and _PROTEIN_ . overall the performance constants revealed that the recombinant _PROTEIN_ had a fold higher preference for glyoxylate than _PROTEIN_ but the preference for nadph was unaffected by the preference for glyoxylate and _PROTEIN_ . kinetic parameters for recombinant _PROTEIN_ kinetic data for varied substrate concentrations were best fit by non linear regression analysis . parameters represent the mean of three independent enzyme preparations . tobacco by cells were co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ consisting of _PROTEIN_ fused to the n terminus of the _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ and examined using _METHOD_ microscopy . as shown in the diffuse _METHOD_ pattern attributable to transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to the _METHOD_ attributable to co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which lacks any inherent subcellular targeting information indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized throughout the _LOCATION_ . on the other hand transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed that this fusion protein displayed a punctate and tubular like _METHOD_ pattern that was similar to the _METHOD_ pattern attributable to endogenous _PROTEIN_ a well characterized _LOCATION_ stromal enzyme . the co localization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ was also evident by the yellow colour in the merged image indicating that _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transformed by cells . images represent the localization of transiently _PROTEIN_ or endogenous proteins in transformed cells including _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . and represent the corresponding merged images of the same cells shown in and and and respectively . bar . as indicated above web based prediction analyses revealed the presence of a targeting signal peptide in the unique n terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ with the length of these predicted targeting peptides varying from to amino acids . as shown in the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ consisting of the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ displayed a punctate and tubular like _METHOD_ pattern that similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with the _METHOD_ pattern attributable to endogenous _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . deletion of the n terminal amino acids from _PROTEIN_ however resulted in the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizing throughout the _LOCATION_ and not to _LOCATION_ as shown by the lack of co localization of _PROTEIN_ with endogenous _PROTEIN_ . overall these data indicate that the n terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ contain targeting information that is both sufficient and necessary for sorting the protein to _LOCATION_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ was actually localized within _LOCATION_ and not simply adjacent to the outside of the organelle cells were differentially permeabilized with either triton x or digitonin and then processed for _METHOD_ microscopy as above . triton x permeabilizes all cellular _LOCATION_ in by cells allowing the immunodetection with applied antibodies of protein epitopes located within the _LOCATION_ and within subcellular compartments . digitonin however permeabilizes only the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ allowing for the immunodetection of _LOCATION_ but not intraorganellar epitopes . as illustrated in the _METHOD_ attributable to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible in both triton x and digitonin permeabilized cells due to the intrinsic _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ moiety . however when antibodies raised against the _METHOD_ moiety were used to detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the same transformed cells the _METHOD_ attributable to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was observed in cells permeabilized with triton x but not in cells permeabilized with digitonin . similarly control experiments revealed that while endogenous _PROTEIN_ was immunodetected in the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed cells permeabilized with triton x the endogenous stromal protein was not immunodetected in digitonin permeabilized cells . also indicate that _LOCATION_ tubulin was immunodetected in both triton x and digitonin permeabilized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed cells as expected . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ is localized within the _LOCATION_ of by cells presumably in the stroma . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in differentially permeabilized by cells . images shown represent individual _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed cells that were fixed and permeabilized with either triton x or digitonin and then immunostained with either anti _PROTEIN_ and anti tubulin or anti _METHOD_ and anti tubulin antibodies . note that in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed cells that were permeabilized with digitonin neither endogenous _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was immunostained . bar .
