amino acids are _PROTEIN_ as the nitrogen currency of plants . amino acids can be taken up from the soil directly or synthesized from inorganic nitrogen and then circulated in the plant via phloem and xylem . _PROTEIN_ a member of the amino acid permease family is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root tissue suggesting a potential role in the uptake and distribution of amino acids . to determine the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter gene fusions were introduced into arabidopsis . histochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus _PROTEIN_ plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in root phloem . _PROTEIN_ was also detected in stamens in cotyledons and in major veins of some mature leaves . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions and epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ were used to confirm the tissue specificity and to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . when overexpressed in yeast or plant protoplasts the functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was localized in subcellular organelle like structures _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ confirmed its localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the phloem consistent with the promoter gus study . in addition epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was localized in endodermal cells in root tips . the intracellular localization suggests trafficking or cycling of the transporter similar to many metabolite transporters in yeast or mammals for example yeast amino acid permease . despite the specific _PROTEIN_ pattern knock out mutants did not show altered phenotypes under various conditions including n starvation . microarray analyses revealed that the _PROTEIN_ profile of genes involved in amino acid metabolism did not change drastically indicating potential compensation by other amino acid transporters .
rna gel blot analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in roots . to study the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in uptake or distribution of organic nitrogen in arabidopsis a genomic clone was isolated from a cosmid library from arabidopsis thaliana ecotype _PROTEIN_ and the promoter region was isolated and analysed . kb of this fragment were sequenced . the sequence is identical to that of ecotype col . to analyse the _PROTEIN_ pattern in more detail promoter gus studies were performed . a kb promoter fragment was fused to the gus gene _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis plants were transformed . as opposed to previous rna gel blot analyses showing high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots in week old transgenic plants the promoter was active _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and in major veins of some leaves but only weakly active in roots . twelve out of lines showed weak and patchy staining or no staining in roots . to test whether additional elements upstream are required for high level _PROTEIN_ in roots a kb fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ was used to include additional elements . all lines carrying the kb promoter showed strong staining in root vascular tissue in addition to _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and major veins of some leaves . considering that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also strongly detected in root tissue at the rna level the gus _PROTEIN_ pattern of the kb promoter construct is in agreement with the native _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . therefore further studies were focused on _PROTEIN_ gusl plants . in mature roots _PROTEIN_ of gus is localized to two vascular strands in the central cylinder . the arabidopsis root is typically diarch containing two phloem strands . normally cells between two _METHOD_ differentiate into metaxylem generating a continuous file of xylem elements . therefore the staining pattern indicates _PROTEIN_ in phloem tissue . cross sections of mature secondary _PROTEIN_ roots verified _PROTEIN_ in the phloem . gus staining in root vascular tissue was stronger in the side roots and was detected all along the root down to cm from the root tip . no staining was detected in the tip of the root . _PROTEIN_ promoter gus _PROTEIN_ was also observed in flowers i.e . at the tip of filaments . interestingly gus activity in stamens was not found in earlier developmental stages . in arabidopsis dehiscence usually takes place just before anthesis . cross sections of flowers showed gus activity in the filament of the stamen before dehiscence indicating that the _PROTEIN_ is induced just before dehiscence . to test whether the promoter is also functional in other species tobacco plants were transformed with both constructs . similar to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ guss plants showed almost no gus _PROTEIN_ in the vascular system of roots whereas _PROTEIN_ gusl plants showed strong staining . no gus activity was detected in leaves of _PROTEIN_ gusl tobacco plants . these results confirm the finding that the larger fragment contains putative enhancer motifs . sequence analysis of the complete upstream region of _PROTEIN_ from col revealed several features in the putative promoter . a potential _PROTEIN_ box was located at position bp relative to the first base of the _PROTEIN_ cdna . since transcriptional initiation was not confirmed experimentally it is unknown whether this corresponds to the native _PROTEIN_ box . the sequence between bp to bp is _PROTEIN_ rich and repetitive in the arabidposis genome more than homologous repeats were found . this region consists of four parts an _PROTEIN_ rich sequence a pair of internal repeats and an sequence . bioinformatic analysis using the place database revealed multiple putative regulatory boxes . considering that the longer promoter is required for strong root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gusl may contain additional enhancer elements i.e . an enhancer found in rbc or a scaffold/matrix attachment region signature sequence found kb upstream of _PROTEIN_ . this sequence occurs rarely and is conserved in seven individual s/mar from arabidopsis . to investigate the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was constructed . as _METHOD_ is quenched by acidic ph the fusion protein was constructed in such a way as to allow _METHOD_ to face the _LOCATION_ . experimental analysis of the topology of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggested that the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ is located in the cytoplasm whereas the c terminus is directed towards the apoplasm . bioinformatic analyses suggest the same topology for _PROTEIN_ . therefore the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was fused at the end of the _METHOD_ gene . yeast complementation showed that the fusion encodes a functional transporter . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was detected in the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and also in internal structures especially as a _PROTEIN_ around the _LOCATION_ potentially indicating accumulation in karmellae . in by cells _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ alone was found in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found preferentially in punctate structures in the _LOCATION_ . localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was also visible whereas the tonoplast was never associated with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to test whether the accumulation in intracellular structures is due to accumulation of the _LOCATION_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ endosome brefeldin a a vesicle trafficking inhibitor was added . bfa treatment led to the disappearance of the dot like structure and a more diffuse pattern indicating that the punctate structures might correspond to _LOCATION_ bodies . since the studies using the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein did not lead to a clear elucidation of the subcellular localization and to confirm the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus studies protein localization was investigated using epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ . three copies of the c myc motif were fused to the end of the _PROTEIN_ translational start within the genomic clone . the construct which contains kb of its native promoter region the whole coding region including all introns and bp of the utr was used to transform tobacco and arabidopsis . in tobacco plants c was detected _PROTEIN_ in the phloem consistent with the results of promoter gus experiments . nine independent transgenic tobacco lines were analysed and six of them gave comparable patterns of localization whereas no signals were detected in the roots of the other three lines . in several cases _LOCATION_ were observed in the cells _PROTEIN_ c suggesting that these were companion cells . the protein was present both on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in arabidopsis the protein was also found in the cells in the phloem . the immunoreaction was not uniform but was in patches as in by cells . in addition endodermal cells at the primary and secondary root tips also _PROTEIN_ c again not only at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also in the internal _LOCATION_ i.e . _LOCATION_ envelopes . the presence of c in the endodermis was not seen in the _PROTEIN_ gusl plants indicating that sequences downstream of the promoter are responsible for _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis . when roots were treated with brefeldin a an inhibitor of vesicular transport the fusion protein accumulated in intracellular particles supporting the idea that c is on its way to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . immunogold localization on ultrathin cryosections at the transmission electron microscope level shows _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization as well as intracellular accumulation at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at multivesicular body like vesicles at _LOCATION_ bodies at the _LOCATION_ and the cell plate . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ two independent arabidopsis lines carrying t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene were isolated by reverse genetic screens of arabidopsis mutants generated at the university of wisconsin knockout arabidopsis facility . sequence analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain t dna insertions in the sixth and second exon of _PROTEIN_ respectively . rt pcr revealed that both alleles do not _PROTEIN_ functional transcripts . primer pairs specifically amplifying a unique fragment of _PROTEIN_ downstream _PROTEIN_ or on the both sides _PROTEIN_ of the insertions from seedling cdna confirmed that the insertions destroyed the locus . after isolating homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and after backcrossing plants were grown under various conditions and compared to the wassilewskija wild type . however under the conditions tested no obvious difference in growth was observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ mutants are affected in amino acid uptake the transport of labelled amino acids was measured . since _PROTEIN_ mediates the uptake of neutral and basic amino acids when _PROTEIN_ in yeast and xenopus oocyte cells glutamine proline aspartate histidine and lysine were chosen for the assay . in all three cases uptake was sensitive to the protonophore cccp however no significant differences in uptake rates relative to the wild type were observed . even though _PROTEIN_ mutants did not show visible phenotypes under the conditions tested the insertion might have effects on gene regulation . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ mutants show a molecular phenotype dna microarray analysis was performed . since many reactions of amino acid synthesis pathways are located in chloroplasts custom made _PROTEIN_ arrays representing genes most of which code known or predicted chloroplast proteins were used . the arrays were hybridized with labelled cdna probes from d old wild type or _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis seedlings . among genes genes were significantly up regulated in _PROTEIN_ whereas genes were down regulated . overall the observed change in the transcript profile was relatively small the highest overrepresentation and lowest underrepresentation in _PROTEIN_ was fold _PROTEIN_ and fold compared with the wild type respectively . among the genes involved in amino acid metabolism the largest increase was observed for the putative isopropylmalate synthase gene and the largest _PROTEIN_ was observed for a _LOCATION_ localized aspartate aminotransferase . the relatively small change in the gene _PROTEIN_ profile together with the _PROTEIN_ that significant differences could not be detected in amino acid levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type indicates that the defect in _PROTEIN_ function does not lead to a prominent change in metabolism at least under the conditions tested possibly due to compensation .
