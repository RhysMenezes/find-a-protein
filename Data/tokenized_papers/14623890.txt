_PROTEIN_ codes for a deubiquitinating enzyme of saccharomyces cerevisiae whose loss of function determines slow growth rate and partial impairment of silencing at telomeres and hm loci . a genome wide analysis performed on a _PROTEIN_ disruptant revealed alterations in _PROTEIN_ of subtelomeric genes together with a broad change in the whole transcriptional profile closely parallel to that induced by oxidative stress . this response was accompanied by intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species as well as by dna fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization two markers of apoptosis . _PROTEIN_ inactivation mitigated the wide transcriptome remodeling of the _PROTEIN_ null mutant affecting particularly the stress transcriptional profile . moreover the _PROTEIN_ disruptant did not display apoptotic markers . these results argue in favor of an involvement of deubiquitination in transcriptional control and suggest a linkage between oxidative stress and apoptotic pathway in budding yeast .
transcriptome profiling of _PROTEIN_ null mutant reveals a cellular stress mutants have a detectable phenotype characterized by an impairment of silencing at telomeres and hm loci and a reduced growth partially complemented by _PROTEIN_ inactivation . we generated a set of null mutants carrying single or double disruptions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type backgrounds and whose phenotypes were similar to published ones . to get insight into the cellular functions affected by _PROTEIN_ inactivation we first carried out a microarray analysis of the differential genome wide _PROTEIN_ profile of a _PROTEIN_ mutant versus its isogenic wild type strain . data from two independent pairs of experiments were analyzed . cultures were harvested at a cellular density of in exponential growth phase on _PROTEIN_ medium a growth condition in which the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a more severe phenotype . transcript levels obtained from the two different strains were compared using the affymetrix method of scaling . reliability of the gene _PROTEIN_ analysis was also evaluated by comparing transcript levels of three reference genes _PROTEIN_ and commonly used as standards . comparison between _PROTEIN_ null mutant and wild type strain revealed changes in transcript levels of a large fraction of the genome . such remodeling of the transcriptome reflects perturbations of different cellular functions and it can correlate with some phenotypic traits of _PROTEIN_ cells in particular with its involvement in telomeric silencing and with the requirement of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ proper chromatin function . given the amount of information generated only some relevant aspects will be presented in this report the full data set is available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ . initially genes with a known cellular role were clustered according to their physiological pathway . both induced and repressed genes belonged to very heterogeneous functional categories however we found some classes to be more represented than others . the down regulated group included genes coding for the following various transporters such as tyrosine glutamate isoleucine permease ammonium permease biotin and peptides carriers ribosomal proteins and translational _PROTEIN_ and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of arginine lysine tryptophan and nucleotides . the down regulation of some of these mrnas could indicate an impairment in protein synthesis and nutrient transport related to the _PROTEIN_ disruptant growth defect that is particularly evident when the deletion is made in strains with auxotrophic markers _PROTEIN_ . no change was observed in transcript in agreement with northern analysis . among the genes whose _PROTEIN_ was increased a conspicuous group encoded the following enzymes involved in _PROTEIN_ transport metabolism and energy generation heat shock proteins and transcription _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because many of these have been found previously to be down or up regulated in specific physiological conditions we analyzed our results not only according to metabolic pathways but also on the basis of published data . this further clustering revealed that many of the genes induced in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant had been proposed previously to offer cell protection in response to stress i.e . hyperosmotic or oxidative stress heat shock ethanol exposure and starvation . these genes are listed in table depending on functional categories . in addition we found a subset of genes that were characterized by the presence of stress responsive consensus sequences in their promoter regions . transcription driven by stress responsive elements through _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has been demonstrated to be induced by a variety of stress conditions activating the general stress response . among the genes there was some coding for enzymes that synthesize trehalose _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ glycogen and their precursors as well as others encoding enzymes involved in the degradation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the simultaneous induction of both synthetic and catabolic enzymes allows cells to rapidly buffer and manage osmotic instability and energy reserves . in particular trehalose protects cellular components from detrimental effects of stress by providing the energy required for renaturation of cellular structures and protecting cells and _LOCATION_ from denaturation . other genes involved in _PROTEIN_ metabolism were and _PROTEIN_ encoding glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol phosphatase respectively two glycerol producing enzymes that play a critical role in response to the hyperosmotic shock allowing the accumulation of glycerol as compatible osmolite . nine genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding heat shock proteins were strongly up regulated . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the highly conserved _PROTEIN_ family and acts as a chaperone to disaggregate damaged proteins . _PROTEIN_ encodes the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that prevents protein aggregation directly and it is required for protein refolding together with and _PROTEIN_ . in addition among the functions related to the metabolism of damaged proteins in _PROTEIN_ null mutant cells we found an induction of the polyubiquitin gene whose _PROTEIN_ is normally enhanced under conditions of heat shock starvation respiratory growth or other conditions where damaged or partially denatured proteins need to be degraded to prevent their accumulation as aggregates . a _LOCATION_ mediated process called autophagy also contributes in the removing of damaged cellular components _PROTEIN_ loss of function induced the _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in this process _PROTEIN_ . changes in the _PROTEIN_ of components of the ub system have been shown to take place in response to oxidative stress a notable feature of the _PROTEIN_ mutant transcriptome was the induction of genes whose products act as scavengers in the enzymatic defense against oxidizing agents that potentially damage proteins and _LOCATION_ acids . we detected _PROTEIN_ encoding the cytoplasmic glutaredoxin _PROTEIN_ glutathione peroxidase mitochondrial mn superoxide dismutase _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial cytochrome c peroxidase cytoplasmic catalase t and _PROTEIN_ glutathione transferase . in particular the increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and is a typical phenomenon observed during respiratory metabolism to counteract ros production . to confirm the reliability of the microarray data a subset of selected genes belonging to different functional groups that exhibited small and large transcriptional changes was further characterized by northern analysis and semiquantitative rt pcr . as illustrated in fig . the results obtained with the two different approaches revealed the same pattern of induction for the nine genes analyzed as that shown by microarray analysis . in conclusion the lack of _PROTEIN_ activity results in the activation of a defined program of gene _PROTEIN_ that displays all the characteristics of an _PROTEIN_ response induced by oxidative stress . in _PROTEIN_ mutants as in oxidatively stressed cells there is an increased need for protection against a damage in cellular homeostasis that takes place without external perturbation but only upon the absence of a deubiquitinating activity . _PROTEIN_ inactivation suppresses the transcriptional stress response of the _PROTEIN_ a further refinement of our analysis we examined the genome wide transcriptional consequences of deleting _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ background to see if _PROTEIN_ transcriptional profiles had detectable features that correlated phenotypic and biochemical data . evaluation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcriptional profile revealed that _PROTEIN_ inactivation mitigated the wide transcriptome remodeling of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in order to delineate which set of genes was particularly affected in the absence of _PROTEIN_ we initially focused on stressresponsive genes . fig . shows the fold change values referred to the stress related genes that were up and down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a clear reduction in the transcriptional response was evident indicating a partial suppression of the stress response induced by loss of _PROTEIN_ alone . no significant change in the transcript level of the same genes was detected in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant . fig . also reports the fold change values of the stress responsive genes obtained from the comparison between _PROTEIN_ mutant versus the _PROTEIN_ one . it is remarkable that the majority of these genes falls in the category of down regulated genes . thus the partial complementation of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype following _PROTEIN_ inactivation _METHOD_ to reflect a reversion of the transcriptional profile detected in the _PROTEIN_ cells . in particular focusing on the fold change values of a subset of stress related genes that were all present in the comparisons between _PROTEIN_ type and _PROTEIN_ the resulting plot had a symmetrical arrangement with two specular profiles . a similar plot was obtained for the fold changes values referred to some of the _PROTEIN_ down regulated genes encoding various transporters ribosomal proteins and enzymes for the biosynthesis of amino acids suggesting a recovery of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype strictly linked to a transcriptome remodeling . _PROTEIN_ has been proposed previously to play a role in _PROTEIN_ regulation and the _PROTEIN_ phenotypic alterations have been suggested to be a consequence of a promiscuous binding of sir complexes to inappropriate loci leading to a _PROTEIN_ in silencing and transcription of some regulated genes . upon _PROTEIN_ inactivation the incorrect recruitment of the silencing apparatus and the deleterious gene repression should be prevented . our data are in agreement with this model supporting an involvement of _PROTEIN_ in transcriptional regulation . in exponentially growing cells targets loci and participates in the activation of of all rna polymerase ii initiation events . this _PROTEIN_ together with the specificity for binding to intergenic sequences potentially acting as promoters could account for the transcription profiling changes detected in the _PROTEIN_ disruptant . reduced silencing displayed by _PROTEIN_ cells correlates with an altered subtelomeric gene _PROTEIN_ wide technology is a powerful tool for analyzing extensively the transcription of orfs mapping in subtelomeric chromosomal regions it allowed us to study the silencing phenomenon without using reporter _METHOD_ . referring to the analyses on the _PROTEIN_ single mutant transcription profiling revealed a predominant effect of reduction in the silencing phenomenon . in detail we found subtelomeric genes subjected to altered transcription of which resulted in an increase by a fold change ranging from to whereas the fold change values of the genes whose _PROTEIN_ was reduced were included between and . in the double mutant _PROTEIN_ we detected orfs whose transcriptional levels changed significantly appeared more _PROTEIN_ by a fold change ranging from to and _PROTEIN_ displaying a fold change between and . and sir proteins are required for the silencing of genes located predominantly within kb of the ends of the telomeres . when we examined how the fraction of derepressed subtelomeric genes in the _PROTEIN_ disruptant varied their distance from the chromosome ends we found _PROTEIN_ deletion up regulated genes prevalently within kb as for the _PROTEIN_ mutant although the global effect of derepression was less pronounced . interestingly in the double disruptant the percentage of up regulated subtelomeric genes was similar to _PROTEIN_ mutant one but an increase in transcriptional derepression within kb of telomeres was observed affecting a subtelomeric region where other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ play a distinct role from the sir proteins to _PROTEIN_ silencing . thus it appears likely that the effects of _PROTEIN_ deletion on subtelomeric silencing are not exclusively mediated by sir complexes . in addition rap sir complexes are required for silencing at the hm loci . the mat locus codes for three gene regulatory proteins that together with a larger group of proteins encoded elsewhere in the genome are responsible for the three distinct types of yeast cells . consistent with its effect on artificially inserted reporters we found that deletion of _PROTEIN_ in a background induced a slight derepression of both _PROTEIN_ and genes encoding and corepressors respectively . in the double disruptant a transcriptional response similar to the one obtained for _PROTEIN_ one was present _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as were actively _PROTEIN_ . consequently we observed the related repression of the entire set of a specific genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of some haploid specific genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these cells as expected were _PROTEIN_ resistant . in summary upon evaluating the global telomeric genes _PROTEIN_ in the different strains the double mutant displayed a more evident derepression effect than _PROTEIN_ comparable to _PROTEIN_ single mutant . these results seem to exclude a synergic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inactivations but point to an involvement in the same pathway where _PROTEIN_ plays a _PROTEIN_ role or alternatively to parallel pathways with similar targets . _PROTEIN_ cells contain ros in the absence of external oxidative the transcriptional stress response was a feature emerging from the genome wide analysis of _PROTEIN_ unrelated to phenotypic traits previously observed we assayed the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ cells to different stress conditions . a plating assay revealed that mutant cells were more resistant than the wild type to increasing concentrations up to a sub lethal dose of suggesting an endogenous tolerance . in particular tolerance depends on catalase activity whose gene was up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . such an endogenous oxidative condition occurs in the cells in the absence of any external oxygen radical sources when ros side products of the respiratory metabolism are no longer detoxified . mitochondrial accumulation of strongly oxidizing molecules is detectable using in vivo specific staining reactions depending on the oxidation of fluorochrome precursors . both _PROTEIN_ and wild type cells in _PROTEIN_ exponential phase of growth on _PROTEIN_ were incubated with dichlorodihy drofluorescein diacetate for h and then examined under a _METHOD_ microscope the mutant population exhibited _METHOD_ dichlorofluorescein whereas the corresponding wild type cells did not show any signal . viability staining with _PROTEIN_ and calcofluor white revealed that the percentage of _METHOD_ dichlorofluorescein cells was not due to nonviable cells and it corresponded to old mother cells . the strain background has been reported to harbor the _PROTEIN_ allele a weak allele of _PROTEIN_ which can have additional phenotypic effects when combined with other mutations . to rule out the possibility of synergist effects between this allele and _PROTEIN_ null mutation we inactivated _PROTEIN_ in another strain . the disruptants displayed growth defects similar to _PROTEIN_ mutants in the background . moreover flow cytometric analysis of rhodamine distributions showed the presence of cells with high _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant grown on _PROTEIN_ indicating that ros accumulation was not strictly correlated to the _PROTEIN_ mutation . thus the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity triggers ros accumulation in growth conditions that normally induce no increase of radical production . finally ros presence was tested in cells growing on a non fermentable _PROTEIN_ source which imposes respiratory metabolism and consequently forces the mitochondrial activity . dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was added to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type cells in _PROTEIN_ exponential phase of growth on glycerol after h samples for each culture were collected and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ dichlorofluorescein distribution was characterized by a subpopulation of cells with high _METHOD_ undetectable in the wild type and double mutant strains in agreement with direct microscopic observation . similar results have been obtained using dihydrorhodamine . because the intensity of respiration does not induce ros accumulation the increase in ros producing cells suggests that _PROTEIN_ mutants have a leaky mitochondrial electron transport . in _PROTEIN_ ros generation requires an accumulation of reducing equivalents in the middle portion of the electron transfer chain and then a direct one electron transfer to a molecule . this diversion of the normal electron flow takes place when the respiratory chain is interrupted for example by cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm . furthermore _PROTEIN_ mutant did not accumulate ros indicating that _PROTEIN_ disruption was sufficient to abrogate this defect . _PROTEIN_ cells display markers of increasing amount of evidence supports the occurrence of apoptosis in s. cerevisiae a process in which ros production has been proposed as a prominent regulatory _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ ros accumulate after induction of apoptotic death by various stimuli such as and acetic acid in old mother cells in mutants and by ectopic _PROTEIN_ of bax an apoptotic regulator of bcl family . in mammalian cells this group of molecules including both proapoptoticandantiapoptoticproteins regulatesthemitochondriadependent cell death process called intrinsic pathway by inducing or preventing release of _PROTEIN_ activators such as cytochrome c from mitochondria to the _LOCATION_ . to investigate if ros presence in the _PROTEIN_ disruptant strain was correlated with the apoptotic phenotype subcellular markers indicating apoptosis were examined . first we performed the tunel assay a sensitive tool to detect free oh termini produced by apoptotic dna cleavage on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type cells grown on glycerol . as positive control of the tunel reaction an aliquot of the wild type culture was treated with dnase i to produce dna fragmentation . as shown in fig . some _PROTEIN_ cells had an intense staining corresponding to the _LOCATION_ comparable with dnase treated cells and indicative of dna strand breakage whereas the double disruptant and the wild type cells displayed a rarely diffuse staining . in parallel we carried out on the same cultures an annexin v labeling in order to detect phosphatidylserine exposure to the external layer of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ another hallmark of apoptosis . simultaneous incubation with fitc conjugated annexin v and propidium iodide a _LOCATION_ impermeant fluorochrome revealed a strong fluorescein green _METHOD_ in some intact _PROTEIN_ cells whereas all intact spheroplasts of the isogenic control and double mutant showed very slight or no brightness . therefore in addition to ros accumulation in the mitochondria _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a coordinate occurrence of some typical apoptotic features such as dna fragmentation and phosphatidylserine exposure suggesting that loss of the _PROTEIN_ deubiquitinating activity triggers an apoptotic process in an aliquot of the cellular population which is completely abolished by the lack of _PROTEIN_ . in mammalian cells various substrates of the ub dependent proteolytic pathway are involved in the regulation of programmed cell death but a direct relationship between a deubiquitinating activity and apoptosis was shown only for the tumor suppressor . in _PROTEIN_ is a short lived protein normally _PROTEIN_ at low level by ubiquitination and consequent proteolysis deubiquitination by herpes virus associated ubiquitin specific protease strongly stabilizes the protein inducing dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis . similarly the apoptotic phenotype displayed by the _PROTEIN_ mutant could be explained by the final consequence of an unbalanced editing of the ubiquitination state of its substrate . the substrates of _PROTEIN_ are so far unknown but there is evidence to indicate this enzyme acts in the _LOCATION_ and is involved in the network of dna proteins interactions affecting silencing and the transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes . changes in chromatin structure are linked not only to the activity of the rap sir complexes but also to histone modifications . in this _PROTEIN_ it is worth recalling that histone mono ubiquitination does not target the protein to degradation but it is associated with chromatin remodeling . moreover in mammalian cells deubiquitination of coincident with chromatin condensation occurs in cells undergoing apoptosis as a downstream consequence of _PROTEIN_ activation but not as a determining apoptogenic stimulus . it is conceivable that in the assembly of a repressed chromatin structure both ubiquitination and deubiquitination of the nucleosomal fibers and of the silencing _PROTEIN_ are involved . in the _PROTEIN_ disruptant changes in the equilibrium between ubiquitination and deubiquitination could affect the assembly or the binding activity of regulatory protein this event might alter local chromatin organization and consequently transcription in agreement with the widely detected remodeling of the transcriptome .
strains and growth s. cerevisiae haploid strains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated from the wild type strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and from the same strain but of opposite mating type by one step gene disruption . _PROTEIN_ inactivation was also carried out in an other strain _PROTEIN_ from euroscarf . yeast cells were grown in batches at in difco yeast nitrogen base medium without amino acids containing _PROTEIN_ and the required supplements . growth on non fermentative _PROTEIN_ source was carried out on glycerol peptone ynb aa and the required supplements . cell number and percentage of budded cells were determined as described previously . recombinant dna procedures and protocols were used for recombinant dna manipulation and yeast transformation . full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were amplified from yeast chromosomal dna with the following primers _PROTEIN_ up and _PROTEIN_ down _PROTEIN_ up and _PROTEIN_ down . the two pcr products containing the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence flanked by bases upstream and bases downstream and _PROTEIN_ spanning between and nucleotides from the _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into the blunt vector to produce and plasmids respectively . pcr products were routinely checked by sequence analysis . to generate _PROTEIN_ cassette a bamhi/xhoi fragment containing the gene was inserted by blunt end ligation into cut with clai and hpai . blunt end cloning of a kb sali/xhoi _PROTEIN_ fragment into scai/clai digested replaces the _PROTEIN_ orf . gene disruptions were confirmed by diagnostic pcr and southern analyses . gene _PROTEIN_ for rna isolation were rapidly collected by filtration and filters were frozen at . total rna was extracted from frozen cells according to the method of selective precipitation with licl . fragmented antisense crna was prepared following affymetrix recommendations . briefly double stranded cdna was retro transcribed from of total rna using a modified oligo primer with a rna polymerase promoter sequence and the superscript choice system for cdna synthesis . crna obtained using an enzo kit was purified on an affinity column . analysis was done by hybridizing the fragmented crnas to the affymetrix yeast genome array which permits the monitoring of the mrna abundance from orfs . probe array hybridizations were carried out under rotation at for h as described . the arrays stained by incubation with _PROTEIN_ streptavidin and mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin were read at a resolution of by a confocal scanner and analyzed with the microarray suite gene _PROTEIN_ analysis program . the whole set of data is available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ . reverse transcription rna prepared as described above for gene _PROTEIN_ analysis was purified using the rneasy rna purification kit and then treated with dnase i rnase free for h at followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation . rt pcr was carried out to amplify the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas using the access rt pcr system following the manufacturer 's instructions . the number of cycles was lowered to so that amplification was in the exponential range . experiments were repeated at least twice with different rna preparations . primers sequences used for pcrs are available upon request . northern analysis was performed as reported previously using radiolabeled rna probes generated by in vitro transcription . _PROTEIN_ mrna was used as an internal standard . test for apoptotic intracellular radicals were detected with dihydrorhodamine or dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as described previously . for flow cytometric analysis cells were incubated with dichlorofluorescein diacetate for h and analyzed using a star with excitation and emission settings of and nm _PROTEIN_ respectively . tdt mediated dutp nick end labeling test was performed according to ref . citation except for spheroplast preparations carried out with zymolase . dna ends were labeled using the in situ cell death detection kit pod . cells were examined under light microscope and through a fluorescein optical filter . externalization of phosphatidylserine was detected essentially as described . spheroplasts were examined under _METHOD_ microscope after min of incubation at room temperature with fitc labeled annexin v and propidium iodide .
