germination represents a rapid transition from dormancy to a high level of metabolic activity . in depth transcriptomic profiling at time points in arabidopsis including fresh seed ripened seed during stratification germination and postgermination per se revealed specific temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns that to our knowledge have not previously been identified . over transcripts were differentially _PROTEIN_ during cold stratification with subequal numbers up regulated as down regulated revealing an active period in preparing seeds for germination where transcription and rna degradation both play important roles in regulating the molecular sequence of events . a previously unidentified transient _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed for a group of genes whereby a significant rise in _PROTEIN_ was observed at the end of stratification and significantly lower _PROTEIN_ was observed h _PROTEIN_ . these genes were further defined as germination specific as they were most highly _PROTEIN_ at this time in germination in comparison with all developmental tissues in the atgenexpress data set . functional analysis of these genes using genetic inactivation revealed that they displayed a significant enrichment for embryo defective or arrested phenotype . this group was enriched in genes encoding mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ rna processing proteins including more than of all pentatricopeptide domain containing proteins _PROTEIN_ during germination . the presence of mitochondrial dna replication _PROTEIN_ and rna processing functions in this germination specific subset represents the earliest events in organelle biogenesis preceding any changes associated with energy metabolism . green _METHOD_ protein analysis also confirmed organellar localization for proteins largely showing germination specific _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that mitochondrial biogenesis involves a two step process to produce energetically active organelles an initial phase at the end of stratification involving mitochondrial dna synthesis and rna processing and a _PROTEIN_ phase for building the better known energetic functions . this also suggests that signals with a mitochondrial origin and retrograde signals may be crucial for successful germination .
to gain a comprehensive insight into arabidopsis germination time points were selected including freshly harvested ecotype columbia seeds seeds desiccated for d in darkness and seeds stratified at in the dark for h h and h . stratified seeds were then transferred into continuous light and further collected at and h into the light . as germination is generally defined as concluding when a part of the embryo emerges from the testa the final time point is considered a postgermination time point . during the time course analyzed genes were found to be _PROTEIN_ at one or more time points with more than of these genes significantly up or down regulated during this crucial developmental stage reflecting the extensive regulation occurring at the transcript level . while a previous study has examined the transcriptomic responses for less than genes during stratification to date there has been no global transcriptomic analysis carried out during stratification which may reflect the general assumption that few significant processes apart from an increase in water content occur during stratification . the inclusion of three time points during stratification revealed that greater than genes are differentially _PROTEIN_ over the h during stratification with the greatest number of differentially _PROTEIN_ genes changing in transcript abundance between h s and h s . notably many of the changes observed were increases in transcript abundance with a total of unique transcripts increasing in transcript abundance over h of stratification compared with transcripts up regulated during the first h after transfer to light at . thus the observed differential _PROTEIN_ is not only a reflection of the clearing out of stored transcripts upon imbibition but also the transcriptional up regulation occurring as part of the germination process which is supported by the observed functional categorization of the proteins encoded by these transcripts . the functional categories overrepresented in the earliest subsets of up regulated degs during stratification included the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and nitrogen and hormone metabolism . upon closer examination it is seen that genes encoding proteins involved in ethylene signaling are first induced in the early hours of stratification . this is in agreement with the role of ethylene which has been shown to augment germination completion . the largest number of degs were observed between h s and h s including an induction and overrepresentation of genes encoding nucleotide metabolism rna processing and protein synthesis functions . closer analysis of the subsets in the protein category revealed an induction of genes encoding cytoplasmic and organellar ribosomal proteins . in contrast protein modification and degradation functions were underrepresented in these subsets . once stratified seeds were transferred into continuous light and an induction and overrepresentation of genes encoding photosynthesis related functions as well as lipid hormone and secondary metabolism functions were observed . interestingly several rna and protein related functions were seen to be significantly underrepresented in the subsets of degs up regulated between h sl and h sl possibly due to the earlier induction of these genes during stratification . as may be expected after transfer into light an overrepresentation of lipid metabolism and developmental function related genes particularly storage proteins and _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis abundant proteins was observed in the down regulated subsets of degs . closer examination of these data reveals an initial down regulation of genes encoding lipid transfer functions between h and h sl followed by a repeated overrepresentation of triacylglycerol synthesis functions in the genes down regulated between h sl and h sl . these changes complement the known breakdown of oil storage reserves that occurs during germination in oilseeds . thus there appear to be distinct processes occurring between stratification and germination . to visualize the _PROTEIN_ profiles across stratification and germination the normalized _PROTEIN_ values for all genes _PROTEIN_ over germination were made relative to the maximum _PROTEIN_ over the time course and hierarchically clustered revealing four distinct clusters . cluster in figure represents approximately of all genes _PROTEIN_ during germination and is characterized by low _PROTEIN_ from dry seed to stratification and even up to h sl followed by significant up regulation after h sl . as expected gene ontology overrepresentation analysis showed that this cluster was enriched in several go categories including genes encoding proteins targeted to the _LOCATION_ chloroplast and ribosome . genes encoding proteins with transferase hydrolase and transporter functions as well as structural molecular activity were also enriched in this cluster corresponding with the increase in energy demand and significant morphological changes that are observed after h sl as the seed transcends to a seedling . the morphological changes observed during germination in this study comply with previous observations during germination . furthermore this up regulated _PROTEIN_ pattern can be readily observed in a previous arabidopsis germination study that analyzed global transcriptomic changes without stratification of seeds and is also evidenced during germination in other species such as rice and barley . in contrast cluster represents the stored mrnas present in dry seed that remain at a high level of _PROTEIN_ up to h s followed by a distinct down regulation . genes in this cluster represent of the total genes _PROTEIN_ during germination and were enriched in _LOCATION_ targeted proteins including those showing transcription _PROTEIN_ activity . given that germination can still occur in the absence of transcription the presence of these transcripts in dry seed early in the time course likely represents the crucial genes necessary for immediate response to imbibition . again the presence of these stored transcripts has also been observed in rice and barley . by analyzing this extensive time course it was revealed that a group of genes are _PROTEIN_ at a very low level up to h s then dramatically increase in abundance between h s and h sl before _PROTEIN_ back to significantly lower levels by h sl the majority _PROTEIN_ by h sl . this transient _PROTEIN_ pattern for a significant number of genes is not apparent during germination when seeds are not stratified . examination of over/underrepresented go categories for these transiently _PROTEIN_ genes revealed significant overrepresentation of genes encoding proteins targeted to the mitochondria _LOCATION_ and ribosomal proteins corresponding with the observed overrepresentation of dna rna binding and transcription functions . the overrepresentation of tf functions in cluster and dna and rna binding functions in cluster suggests a two step regulation of genes encoding these regulatory _PROTEIN_ with the genes in cluster likely encoding the regulatory proteins responsive to imbibition and required for the early stages of germination while genes in cluster are likely to encode the regulatory proteins required for normal germination progression and _PROTEIN_ plant development . in contrast the genes in cluster were enriched in proteins of unknown cellular localization and biological processes and slowly increased _PROTEIN_ or largely remained unchanging in abundance across the germination time course . this set of genes may represent genes required for basic cellular functions not highly responsive under germination conditions . previous studies have shown that while germination progresses to the point of radicle emergence in the absence of transcription seedling establishment is prevented . therefore during this crucial developmental process the translation of transcripts _PROTEIN_ during germination is clearly essential for further development . to identify any correlation between transcript and protein abundance the transcript abundance profiles in this study were compared with previous studies examining protein abundance during germination . specifically one study identified over proteins _PROTEIN_ in dry seeds seeds after d of cold stratification and then and h into a h light/dark cycle . this study categorized a large number of the protein abundance profiles as present for each time point . in this way present/absent profiles were observed for unique proteins over this time course for which parallel _PROTEIN_ information is also available in our study . a number of the proteins identified by citation have also previously been identified in other germination studies and these have been annotated in supplemental table . using this present/absent profiling of protein abundance these proteins were matched to the corresponding transcript profiles from this study . remarkably it was seen that of the up regulated proteins over time showed comparable transcript _PROTEIN_ profiles . similarly of the proteins highly _PROTEIN_ in seeds and not detected following stratification or transfer into the light/dark cycle proteins showed similar transcript _PROTEIN_ profiles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly three genes encoding dna/rna binding functions gly rich protein a heterogeneous _LOCATION_ ribonucleoprotein and a like splicing domain containing protein were seen to have both a transient transcript _PROTEIN_ profile and also a transient protein abundance profile . to further analyze the genes that showed transient _PROTEIN_ during germination publicly available microarrays carried out on a wide variety of tissues in the atgenexpress developmental set were downloaded normalized and analyzed together with the arrays in this study . _PROTEIN_ levels of the genes _PROTEIN_ during germination and development were visualized in the same row order as shown in figure and were hierarchically clustered by tissue samples to determine in what other tissues/organs these genes were also _PROTEIN_ . examination of these revealed that the genes in clusters and consist of genes that are highly _PROTEIN_ or unchanging in _PROTEIN_ in most other developmental tissues as well as _PROTEIN_ germination . as expected the genes in cluster that were highly _PROTEIN_ in dry seeds were also highly _PROTEIN_ across the microarrays analyzing developing seeds . in contrast it was observed that the genes in cluster were most highly _PROTEIN_ between h s and h sl even in comparison with all other developmental tissues . to filter these genes further for primarily germination specific _PROTEIN_ only those genes that had a relative _PROTEIN_ level greater than _PROTEIN_ between h s and h sl across all tissues were visualized . in this way unique genes were identified as showing the highest _PROTEIN_ during germination . intriguingly analysis of over/underrepresented go categories for these gs genes revealed approximately double the expected percentage of genes in this set encoding proteins targeted to the mitochondria _LOCATION_ and ribosomes corresponding with the observed overrepresentation of dna and rna binding functions . genes encoding tfs represented only of the genes which was not significantly greater/less than the expected percentage in the genome . this indicates that the genes encoding mitochondria and _LOCATION_ localized proteins were binding dna or rna but performing functions other than transcriptional regulation . to discover the nature of these other encoded protein functions the genes in these mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ subsets from the gs genes were viewed based on the subfunctional groups within these sets revealing a significant enrichment of rna processing functions in both sets _LOCATION_ . additionally helicase and ribonucleoprotein/rna binding functions were also seen to be enriched in the _LOCATION_ set . for the mitochondrial set from the gs genes protein fate functions were observed to be enriched despite the majority of genes in the mitochondria encoding metabolism and energy functions . closer examination of the genes encoding rna processing functions revealed a significant overrepresentation of pentatricopeptide repeat domain _PROTEIN_ containing genes in this gs subset with nearly of the genes encoding a _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein while _PROTEIN_ domain containing genes only make up less than of all genes in the genome . to confirm that the observed _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ pattern was limited to the transiently _PROTEIN_ genes during germination the percentage of _PROTEIN_ genes in each cluster was examined . interestingly it was seen that of all _PROTEIN_ were in cluster showing transient _PROTEIN_ during germination and of these genes showed gs _PROTEIN_ . despite the finding that this transient _PROTEIN_ pattern can not be readily identified when seeds are not stratified when the _PROTEIN_ genes showing gs _PROTEIN_ were examined together with the microarrays from this study it was observed that the transient _PROTEIN_ pattern during germination was somewhat _PROTEIN_ however the temporal resolution was lost or not observed . this suggests that the stage specific _PROTEIN_ of these genes is a characteristic of germination independent of whether seeds undergo stratification . to determine whether these transiently _PROTEIN_ genes also displayed transient _PROTEIN_ during germination in other species rice orthologs of the arabidopsis gs genes were visualized showing their _PROTEIN_ across germination and developmental tissues in rice . a total of rice orthologs of the arabidopsis gs genes could be identified using inparanoid . only of the rice orthologs displayed maximum _PROTEIN_ during rice germination however these did not display the transient pattern observed in arabidopsis . instead the _PROTEIN_ pattern observed for the rice orthologs was more similar to the patterns observed for clusters and in arabidopsis . as _PROTEIN_ genes display high levels of orthology between plant species the subset of rice _PROTEIN_ genes orthologous to the gs genes in arabidopsis were isolated and the _PROTEIN_ levels were hierarchically clustered . _PROTEIN_ of the orthologous genes in rice revealed no transient _PROTEIN_ pattern . in addition visualization of these rice _PROTEIN_ genes across germination and other developmental tissues further confirmed the divergence in the transcriptomic response of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ between monocots and dicots despite orthology . a recent study defined genes as seed essential where a loss of function mutation in these genes was found to result in a seed related phenotype mostly embryo lethal . these genes are indicated in the seedgenes database . the list of seedgenes characterized as showing a seed related phenotype was matched against the genes _PROTEIN_ during germination . of the genes in this database _PROTEIN_ of genes could be detected during this germination time course . a significant enrichment of seed genes was seen in cluster and cluster with seed genes observed in the set of gs genes . interestingly the rice orthologs for these genes did not show a transient _PROTEIN_ pattern during rice germination suggesting that despite orthology the controlled _PROTEIN_ of these genes during germination may be specific to arabidopsis germination . given the enrichment of seed lethal genes in the gs genes identified in figure a search was carried out on the to determine whether these genes encode crucial protein functions necessary for seed/seedling or even plant development . to do this large scale reverse genetic studies identifying phenotypes for knocked out/silenced genes were matched to the gs genes . the studies/databases examined are outlined in supplemental table . in addition to the large scale studies/databases it was observed that of the gs genes encode proteins experimentally shown and/or predicted to be localized to the mitochondria therefore all genes encoding these proteins were individually searched for known phenotypes in previous publications . in this way genes were identified as having altered developmental phenotypes . to ensure that this process of searching for phenotypes did not have any particular bias sets of randomly selected genes were generated and examined for phenotypes exactly as carried out for the gs set . it was seen that overall the gs set consisted of significantly more genes with known phenotypes compared with the average number across the random gene sets . moreover the types of phenotypes also significantly differed with more than three times the number of genes with seed lethal/embryo arrested phenotypes seen in the gs set compared with the random gene sets . interestingly closer examination of the genes with known phenotypes also reveals an obvious enrichment of genes encoding rna binding/processing functions compared with only in the random gene sets . examples of these genes encoding proteins involved in rna binding functions included rna helicases rna binding proteins various ribonucleases and proteins containing an rna recognition motif . the identification of these functions as being most highly _PROTEIN_ during germination combined with observations that the silencing/loss of function of a significant number of these genes results in seed lethal/embryo arrested phenotypes reveal the crucial requirement for the _PROTEIN_ and function of rna binding/processing during early germination and development in arabidopsis . the transcriptomic results presented strongly suggest a clear link between localization and coexpression with genes encoding proteins annotated as _LOCATION_ localized being overrepresented in cluster and genes encoding mitochondria/nucleus localized proteins being overrepresented in cluster . considering these correlations it was hypothesized that a selection of genes with hitherto unconfirmed protein localizations could encode proteins localized to the mitochondria _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ based on their _PROTEIN_ patterns and predicted localizations as annotated in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ localization database . a range of genes largely showing gs _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by _METHOD_ targeting to determine protein localization . fusion proteins were constructed and transiently transformed into arabidopsis cell culture using biolistic transformation . organelle targeting was verified using alternative oxidase red _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a mitochondrial control targeted small subunit of rubisco _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ control and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as a control for peroxisomal targeting . protein accumulation was characterized as to the mitochondria _LOCATION_ dual targeted to the mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ . examples of _METHOD_ micrographs for proteins targeted to the mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ are shown in figure and the complete set of targeting results is shown in supplemental figure . most of the genes for which localization was determined exhibited low _PROTEIN_ in dry seed and h sl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the localization of these confirmed the predicted localization for most genes with some exceptions including a mitochondrial transcription termination _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ containing protein _GENE_ that were predicted to be mitochondrial but appear to be dual targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . it can be seen that several genes displayed in figure encode dna/rna binding functions including a mitochondrial intron maturase a mterf protein many mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ encoding proteins as well as a _LOCATION_ targeted chaperone dnaj protein a plant homeodomain finger dna binding tf and a trna methyltransferase . the transient _PROTEIN_ of these genes encoding regulatory functions during germination and the confirmation of their mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ localization reveal a specific step of transcriptional regulation that occurs for organellar proteins during this crucial stage of development . further supporting the essential role of these genes during the earliest stages of germination it was revealed that three of the genes selected for localization studies encode proteins for which a loss of function results in a seed lethal phenotype as determined previously . each of these genes _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ encoded proteins predicted to be mitochondrial which was confirmed by _METHOD_ analysis . notably a number of recent studies have also confirmed the observed localization for four of these proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . furthermore including the two seed lethal genes annotated as unknown function it can be seen that localization was determined for other genes of unknown function . these analyses reveal clues about the possible functions of these genes inferred from their organellar localization and gs _PROTEIN_ forming the basis of further functional studies of these genes . in addition it was observed that two small auxin responsive rna like encoding genes were predicted to encode mitochondria targeted proteins however the localization of these was determined to be _LOCATION_ . the transient _PROTEIN_ of these was particularly interesting as it is known that these genes are specifically regulated at the level of mrna decay allowing tight control of mrna levels . this subset of tightly controlled transiently _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria and/or _LOCATION_ targeted genes may represent crucial control _PROTEIN_ responsible for the normal regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ during germination . it is known that upon imbibition during germination stored mrnas are degraded as in vivo transcription begins and this pattern of _PROTEIN_ in abundance of stored transcripts appears to be conserved independently of whether seeds are stratified or not . similarly the up regulation of specific transcripts over the germination time course is also conserved . although these _PROTEIN_ patterns are relatively conserved during germination with/without stratification the temporal development sequence is different due to different experimental designs . two distinct phases of rna degradation were evidenced . a comparison of these genes with the mrna half lives of approximately genes that have been previously determined in arabidopsis allows insight into the regulatory processes that may affect transcript stability or degradation . given that transcripts encoding core cellular functions such as those involved in energy have relatively long mrna half lives it was not surprising to observe a significant enrichment of transcripts with longer half lives in cluster . similarly given the sharp _PROTEIN_ that occurs after the transient _PROTEIN_ seen in cluster it was also expected to find that this cluster was enriched in transcripts with relatively short half lives . in contrast it was surprising to see that there was no enrichment of transcripts with shorter half lives in cluster given that this group is characterized by a significant _PROTEIN_ in transcript abundance . although this _PROTEIN_ is seen to occur much slower for stratified seeds it does appear that when seeds are imbibed under continuous light with no stratification these stored transcripts _PROTEIN_ to about of their dry seed levels within h indicating a relatively rapid rate of _PROTEIN_ in abundance . these findings indicate that the rate of degradation is controlled in a developmental stage specific manner . the other _PROTEIN_ controlling transcript abundance is transcription therefore without directly measuring transcription focus was shifted to how the transcripts encoding these regulatory _PROTEIN_ respond during germination . thus the arabidopsis tf database was queried resulting in the observation that cluster was significantly enriched in genes encoding tfs . this is particularly interesting as it further supports the important role of mrna stability during germination given that genes encoding tfs are known to have short mrna half lives and yet are seen to remain stably abundant up to h s . a closer look at the families of tfs in each cluster reveals specific over/underrepresentation patterns including the significant overrepresentation of the myb _PROTEIN_ orphans aux/iaa and bhlh families in cluster . interestingly the aux/iaa and bhlh families were also seen to be overrepresented in the group of genes showing the same up regulation pattern over germination in rice . several studies have examined the role of aux/iaa proteins and have revealed that these proteins have repressor functions crucial for normal development . given their conserved _PROTEIN_ pattern it is possible that their role in regulating germination and development is conserved across monocots and dicots . similarly cluster was significantly enriched in the hb trihelix and _PROTEIN_ families with the latter also seen to be overrepresented in the parallel cluster during rice germination . previous studies have implicated a role for _PROTEIN_ for normal development in plants and other eukaryotic species with one study even showing a build up of both transcript and protein abundance for _PROTEIN_ over the course of seed development . therefore it was not surprising to see the conserved _PROTEIN_ pattern of these genes across rice and arabidopsis . although cluster was not enriched in tfs it was seen that of the tfs present there was an enrichment of hb _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the mterfs with of the mterfs _PROTEIN_ during germination present in cluster . it has been shown that hb tfs have a role in cell differentiation and growth thus their overrepresentation in cluster may reflect an increase in demand for tfs controlling these vital processes during germination . a previous study has shown the crucial role these _PROTEIN_ play not only in mitochondrial transcription termination but also in the initiation of transcription and the control of mitochondrial dna replication . the role for was also characterized in arabidopsis embryos and was seen to be _PROTEIN_ from globular to _PROTEIN_ cotyledon stages . thus it was not surprising to see the overrepresentation of these in cluster . to analyze putative cis elements that may be involved in regulating transcript abundance during germination genes in each cluster and the gs set identified in figure were examined for overrepresented putative mers in the kb upstream region of the transcriptional start site . the gs set was specifically chosen because the abundance of these transcripts increases and _PROTEIN_ in a relatively short time period and thus they are likely to be coregulated at the transcriptional level accounting for the observed increase and possibly actively degraded to produce the _PROTEIN_ observed . overall the kb upstream promoter elements displayed significant enrichment of mers with some elements found in up to of the genes that showed gs _PROTEIN_ . all promoter elements were matched against known cis element binding sites within the _PROTEIN_ database and studies that have characterized specific binding sites . any elements showing a significant overrepresentation for genes in clusters to and the gs subset are shown in table i . promoter analysis of stored mrnas was carried out previously and a significant overrepresentation of _PROTEIN_ binding sites was observed for these a feature confirmed in this study with _PROTEIN_ elements also observed in genes of cluster . interestingly there was an overwhelmingly large number of known motifs seen in the gs subset suggesting that numerous _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the controlled _PROTEIN_ pattern observed for these genes . an example of these included an overrepresentation of telobox and site ii elements for the genes in cluster and the gs subset complying with the role of these genes in the control of genes encoding organellar proteins during development and the circadian regulation of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins . additionally it can be seen that genes encoding _PROTEIN_ tfs were enriched in cluster . it is possible that these _PROTEIN_ have a role in the control of genes in the gs subset as several heat shock element _PROTEIN_ binding site motifs were seen to be enriched in the gs subset implying that the stored _PROTEIN_ encoding transcripts in dry seed may be translated upon imbibition and have a downstream role in the control of gs transcript abundance . the specific hexamer name of the known motif reference showing the source of the motif _PROTEIN_ and occurrence in all genes _PROTEIN_ during germination in each cluster and the gs subset are shown . note that motifs with asterisks indicate that these were also identified as overrepresented in dry seed by citation .
to analyze a range of time points before and during arabidopsis germination time points were analyzed including freshly harvested seeds and then the seeds following d of ripening and after h of stratification h of stratification and h of stratification plates were then transferred to continuous light and collected h into the light h into the light h into the light h into the light and h into the light . eighty _METHOD_ of wild type arabidopsis seeds was plated onto murashige and skoog medium for each individual time point collection in the time course . collections were repeated three times for three biological replicates . for all samples collected the ambion plant rna isolation aid and rnaqeous rna isolation kit were used for effective isolation of rna . a total of ng of total rna was used as the starting amount of rna for the _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ array . using the ivt _PROTEIN_ kit microarrays were carried out according to the manufacturers instructions . before beginning the microarray experiments as well as during the course of the microarrays the agilent bioanalyzer was used to ensure high quality starting rna generated amplified rna and effective fragmentation prior to hybridization to the microarray . all raw intensity cel files were imported into avadis and standard normalization was first carried out to determine present/absent/marginal calls for each probe set . all probe sets that encoded hybridization controls bacterial genes and more than one single gene were excluded leaving a global arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ set consisting of probe sets . probe sets that were called present in two or more replicates were considered to be _PROTEIN_ and were then used for further analysis . gc robust multiarray average normalization was carried out for all microarrays and the resulting normalized intensities were used as the input for the differential _PROTEIN_ analysis . this was carried out using the cyber t method which implements a bayesian method for the determination of probe sets showing significant changes in transcript abundance . the posterior probability of differential _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ method within cyber t was used for false discovery rate calculation . all input criteria were set according to cyber t recommendations applicable for each experimental set . a probe set was defined as significantly changing at p < with a _PROTEIN_ of greater than . these cutoffs and this bayesian method of differential _PROTEIN_ have been verified and been used in previous microarray studies . in this way step wise differential _PROTEIN_ analysis was carried out . all original microarray data files have been deposited to the gene _PROTEIN_ omnibus at the national center for biotechnology information under accession number . to view the profiles of _PROTEIN_ changes over the time course all gc robust multiarray average studies were made relative to the maximum intensity over the time course . these data were then hierarchically clustered using average linkage and four cluster profiles were drawn using partek genomics suite . to determine if there was a statistically significant overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a particular subcategory of go a z score analysis was carried out to compare the two proportions where refers to the mean and n is the number of genes in the subset . a cumulative standard normal table was used to match the z score and based on this p values were determined . to analyze the functional representation of the genes differentially _PROTEIN_ during the time course differential pageman analyses were carried out using the unique set of probe sets representing the degs . fisher s test for overrepresentation analysis was carried out in pageman to determine statistically significant over/underrepresentation of genes classified into specific bins . to compile the publicly available affymetrix arabidopsis and rice microarrays all experiments containing cel files were downloaded from the gene _PROTEIN_ omnibus within the national centre for biotechnology information database or from the _PROTEIN_ arrayexpress database . the gene _PROTEIN_ omnibus series or experiment numbers for the respective studies are shown in supplemental table . the arabidopsis atgenexpress developmental data set was downloaded as cel files . these cel files in addition to the cel files from this study were imported and quantile normalized together to enable comparability across these arrays using partek genomics suite version . to carry out parallel analysis for developmental conditions in rice developmental tissues for rice were also downloaded and analyzed in the same manner as described for the arabidopsis developmental set . the inparanoid eukaryotic ortholog groups database was utilized to analyze all orthologs between arabidopsis and rice . the orthologous group file containing the rice versus arabidopsis set was downloaded for the whole genome comparison . this generated information for orthologs is identified by arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ numbers for arabidopsis and the institute for genomic research identifiers for rice . for this analysis only the list of affymetrix probe sets that matched to individual _PROTEIN_ numbers was isolated and used . from those three sets of randomly selected gene sets were generated using partek genomic suite version . these sets were analyzed and scrutinized for phenotypes in exactly the same manner as was carried out for the gs set identified in figure . first large scale forward genetics studies were mined and matched to any genes in these sets in addition all genes encoding proteins localized to the mitochondria were individually searched for publications indicating phenotypes and these were collated . full references for all phenotypes identified in the gs set are shown in supplemental table . given that the _PROTEIN_ profiles showed correlation between coexpression and colocalization _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ a selection of genes mostly encoding proteins predicted to be mitochondrial were selected for _METHOD_ localization analysis . for each gene the region of the protein encoding the targeting signals was cloned in frame with _METHOD_ by gateway cloning as described previously . for proteins predicted to target to the mitochondria or _LOCATION_ the first amino acids were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . for proteins predicted to target to the _LOCATION_ the last amino acids were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . three _METHOD_ fusion proteins were utilized as controls for subcellular localization . to control for mitochondrial targeting the amino acid mitochondrial targeting signal of _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ . to control for _LOCATION_ targeting the full length cdna of the _LOCATION_ targeted _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ . to control for peroxisomal targeting the peroxisomal targeting signal was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ which has been used effectively previously . biolistic transformation of the _METHOD_ constructs of interest with their associated _METHOD_ controls was carried out on arabidopsis cell suspensions as reported previously . approximately of both the _METHOD_ fusion protein and the _METHOD_ control was coprecipitated onto gold particles and transiently transformed using the biolistic _PROTEIN_ system . gold particles were bombarded into ml of arabidopsis cell suspension spread on filter paper placed on osmoticum plates followed by incubation at for h in the dark . visualization of the _METHOD_ proteins was carried out using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope with excitation wavelengths of nm for _METHOD_ and nm for _METHOD_ emission wavelengths were measured at to nm for _METHOD_ and to nm for _METHOD_ . micrographs were captured and processed using cell imaging software as described previously . localizations as determined by _METHOD_ analysis
