the arabidopsis double pore k channel _PROTEIN_ was fused to green _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts . microscopic analysis revealed a bright green _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . rt pcr experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll . _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ knockout plants were isolated for patch clamp analyses . currents mediated by s low activating v acuolar channels of mesophyll cell _LOCATION_ were significantly smaller in _PROTEIN_ plants compared to the wild type . this shows that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the formation of sv channels .
transfected tobacco protoplasts were identified by the green _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show bright staining of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to prove whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was embedded in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tobacco cells were ruptured to release intact _LOCATION_ . this was accomplished by either flushing distilled water from a micro pipette onto the isolated protoplasts or by applying a harsh suction pulse by a patch pipette filled with bath solution . images of _LOCATION_ emerging from transfected tobacco cells always showed a pronounced green _METHOD_ of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is indeed inserted into this _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also detected in epidermal cells following ballistic bombardment of arabidopsis leaves using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . therefore it is highly unlikely that the observed _PROTEIN_ localization results from mistargeting as frequently observed for plant _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in heterologous _METHOD_ . to search for an insertion mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene we used a reverse genetic approach . thereby a transposon mutagenized arabidopsis population was screened with _PROTEIN_ and en specific primers . we first found an en transposon located about kb upstream of the _PROTEIN_ translational start codon which can not be expected to cause a strong reduction in mrna content . in order to obtain a mutant which lacks _PROTEIN_ we screened for an excision reinsertion event of en . among progeny plants a single mutant plant _PROTEIN_ was obtained . the transposon had inserted into position nt leading to a duplication of ala thereby disrupting the open reading frame . homozygous progeny of this plant was used for further studies . quantitative rt pcr was used to compare kco transcripts between leaves and roots . thereby _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found in relatively high concentrations in the leaf only . in root kco transcripts were less abundant . following enzymatic digestion mesophyll and guard cell protoplasts were separated . mesophyll cells were dominated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts with a three fold higher _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ compared to guard cells . the number of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in mesophyll cells was four times smaller than that of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ levels in guard cells were as high as those of _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are expected to dominate kco type currents in mesophyll _LOCATION_ . accordingly mesophyll _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ plants should be significantly reduced in the current generated by _PROTEIN_ channels . the patch clamp technique was used to study ion currents of mesophyll _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants to address the question whether _PROTEIN_ corresponds to either fv or sv channel activities . without ca in the bath solution typical instantaneous outward currents were elicited by positive voltage pulses . these fv currents did not significantly differ between _LOCATION_ from wild type and from _PROTEIN_ plants . with symmetrical mm ca characteristic whole _LOCATION_ sv currents became measurable . sv currents recorded from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants appeared qualitatively similar . when comparing the current densities however sv currents from _PROTEIN_ plants were smaller than with wild type _LOCATION_ . the medians a/m for the wild type and a/m for _PROTEIN_ differed by a _PROTEIN_ of four and a t test and a kolmogorov smirnov test clearly show that sv current amplitudes from _PROTEIN_ plants are significantly smaller than those from wild type plants . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ contains a putative binding site and that this peptide was shown to block the sv channel . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ protein contributes to the formation of functional sv channels . _PROTEIN_ transcripts represent when compared to _PROTEIN_ . assuming that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ too it is tempting to speculate that _PROTEIN_ accounts for the background sv current in _PROTEIN_ . therefore future studies taking advantage of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants together with proteomic approaches to identify the proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ will gain new insights into the role and structure of the sv channel . compared to _PROTEIN_ mediated whole cell currents in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ insect cells whole _LOCATION_ sv currents show some similarities but also some striking differences . the sv channel is activated by increasing _LOCATION_ ca but requires higher free ca concentrations and the ca dependence is not as steep as measured with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ insect cells . moreover increasing _LOCATION_ calcium shifts the voltage dependence of the sv channel in the opposite direction compared to _LOCATION_ ca changes . the external concentration of divalent cations however does not affect _PROTEIN_ . the sv channel hardly discriminates between k and na whereas _PROTEIN_ has a six fold higher permeability for k . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the sv channel is much less sensitive to ba blockage and the block is readily reversible . in order to explain these discrepancies isolated arabidopsis mesophyll _LOCATION_ were analyzed under the same ionic conditions as those originally used for recording _PROTEIN_ mediated whole cell currents in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ insect cells . this was done with the corresponding bath solution in the bath as described by czempinski et al . and in addition with bath and pipette solutions reciprocally exchanged . under both conditions no whole _LOCATION_ currents resembling _PROTEIN_ mediated currents could be recorded . it will be interesting to find out why _PROTEIN_ mediated k currents recorded in insect cells are so different from _LOCATION_ sv currents .
for the construction of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr using pbluescript _PROTEIN_ as a template . the forward primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains a xho i site and the reverse primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a site and mutated the _PROTEIN_ stop codon taa to tac . the isolated pcr fragment was digested with xho i and and the resulting bp fragment was subcloned into the vector _METHOD_ digested with xho i and nco i thereby replacing a translation enhancing element . this vector contains a codon optimized _METHOD_ mutant gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus camv promoter and an additional translation enhancing element of tobacco etch virus . transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts and microscopic analysis were performed as described by bischoff et al . . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified by reverse genetic screening of an en mutagenized collection of arabidopsis plants . pcr based screens were performed as described . the following two primer combinations specific for the _PROTEIN_ gene and the en transposon were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and en _PROTEIN_ and en _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for rt pcr experiments total rna from arabidopsis tissues was isolated using the rneasy plant mini kit and mrna was purified twice with the dynabeads mrna direct kit to minimize dna contaminations . guard cell and mesophyll protoplasts were prepared as described and directly purified with the dynabeads mrna direct kit . first strand cdna and quantitative rt pcr was performed as described before using a lightcycler . the following k channel specific primers were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the genbank accession numbers are as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis actins . cdna quantities were calculated by using lightcycler . all quantifications were normalized to actin cdna fragments amplified by actfwd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and actrev _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to enable detection of contaminating genomic dna the primers for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected to flank introns . all kits were used according to the manufacturers protocols . _METHOD_ images were taken with a zeiss axiovert illuminated at nm by polychrome ii or a zeiss lsm with a blue argon laser . for the _METHOD_ channel a bandpass filter nm was used with the c apochromat water immersion objective . the xy resolution was set to per pixel while the z resolution was about . a. thaliana was grown in a temperature controlled growth chamber . from protoplasts isolated from mesophyll cells a fresh _LOCATION_ was mechanically isolated within the measuring chamber for each patch clamp measurement . patch clamp recordings were performed as described . for recordings on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the pipette _LOCATION_ contained kcl cacl hepes/tris ph adjusted to mosm with sorbitol . the bathing medium was either the same for recording of sv channels or mm cacl were substituted by mm egta to record fv channels .
