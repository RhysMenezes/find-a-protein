stem cell number in shoot and floral _METHOD_ of arabidopsis is regulated by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway . perception of the _PROTEIN_ peptide requires the receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ the receptor like protein _PROTEIN_ and the kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . genetic analysis suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act together and in parallel with _PROTEIN_ . we studied the intracellular localization of receptor fusions with _METHOD_ protein tags and their capacities for interaction via efficiency of _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer . we found that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ require each other for export from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ readily _METHOD_ homomers and interacts with _PROTEIN_ through the transmembrane domain and adjacent juxtamembrane sequences . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ homomers independently of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the pm . we propose that the _PROTEIN_ signal is perceived by a tetrameric _PROTEIN_ complex and a _PROTEIN_ homodimer that localize to the pm and can interact via _PROTEIN_ .
for fret based analyses of protein protein interactions the proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as fusions with _METHOD_ . we found that constitutive _PROTEIN_ of most receptor _METHOD_ fusions from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter failed to rescue the corresponding mutants in transgenic arabidopsis . therefore we decided to use an inducible gene _PROTEIN_ system which allowed us to study protein localization and interaction at variable protein concentrations . a set of transgenic arabidopsis plants was generated that _PROTEIN_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with either _METHOD_ or mcherry at their c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from an estradiol inducible promoter . we studied the functionality of the different receptor _METHOD_ by analyzing their capability to complement the corresponding loss of function mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or crn . transgenic plants were first cultivated for d on soil before transgene _PROTEIN_ was induced with estradiol on days and . at weeks after germination we assayed for restoration of _PROTEIN_ signaling by counting the carpel number of siliques on each plant . the nontransgenic control plants as well as mock induced transgenic plants produced on average carpels per silique . importantly siliques with less than three carpels were never observed under our growth conditions . induced transgenic plants showing at least two consecutively formed siliques with wild type carpel number were _PROTEIN_ as complemented and those carrying a single rescued silique were _PROTEIN_ as partially complemented . we found that all our inducible transgenes were functional in vivo and complemented the respective mutations albeit with different frequencies . although up to two flower primordia are normally initiated per day and transgene _PROTEIN_ was induced for at least d we found that many transgenic plants carried only two siliques with two carpels . transient restoration of _PROTEIN_ signaling could indicate delayed floral primordium initiation rapid loss of transgene activity due to cosuppression or sensitivity of the system to receptor concentrations . rescue of clv signaling mutants by inducible _PROTEIN_ of receptor _METHOD_ fusions transgenic plants of the indicated genotypes were estradiol induced at weeks after germination . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and crn mutants carry siliques with on average carpels . carpel number of siliques was analyzed per plant . n number of lines c number of complementing plants with percentage of total carrying more than one silique with only two carpels pc partially complemented carrying one silique with two carpels nc noncomplemented producing only mutant carpels . in arabidopsis we detected induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in hypocotyl and root cells and very faint _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals when _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter but we failed to visualize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however we were unable to reproducibly detect the fusion proteins in shoot or floral _METHOD_ . because localization studies with stably transformed arabidopsis plants proved not feasible we used a transient _PROTEIN_ system in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermis cells for further experiments . constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the pm but we also noted the formation of larger fluorescing aggregates . similar aggregates were observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which could be caused by protein overexpression . to control protein _PROTEIN_ levels we then used the estradiol inducible system . vectors were transformed into intact leaves via agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration and _PROTEIN_ was induced by spraying leaves with estradiol . signals from _METHOD_ were first detectable h after induction . upon extended induction most cells carried large _METHOD_ aggregates similar to those observed in our constitutive _PROTEIN_ experiments . such an aggregation of receptor _METHOD_ fusions upon extended induction could be responsible for the only transient complementation of the arabidopsis mutants . therefore all measurements were performed with cells that did not show this overexpression phenotype . integrity of the fusion proteins was confirmed by western blotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the anti _METHOD_ antibody identified a single specific band each for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the sizes of the detected bands for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were slightly increased compared with the calculated fusion protein sizes . similar discrepancies have been noted for other proteins carrying lrr domains and are likely due to posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ predominantly localizes to the pm which was confirmed by colocalization with the lipophilic _METHOD_ dye . staining was also observed in vesicles but only faintly in the _LOCATION_ which reflects transport to the pm and the site of synthesis . in contrast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed a spotty _METHOD_ pattern near the pm which did not colocalize with the pm marker . transformation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with an _LOCATION_ tagged mcherry reporter revealed complete colocalization in the _LOCATION_ network . because _METHOD_ positive transport vesicles were never observed we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predominantly _LOCATION_ localized . this contrasts with our expectation of _PROTEIN_ perception and signaling at the pm . protein localization may depend on the establishment of functional complexes therefore we also tested our fusion proteins in coexpression experiments . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mcherry or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mcherry did not affect their localization at the _LOCATION_ and pm respectively . however coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry caused a relocation of both proteins from the _LOCATION_ to the pm and the formation of transport vesicles . this relocation was confirmed by colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . cotransformed cells were easily detectable by their _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ the production of _METHOD_ positive vesicles and pm staining . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed the tagged proteins were always located at the pm . in silico studies indicated that _PROTEIN_ consists of a signal peptide a short _LOCATION_ domain the transmembrane domain and the protein kinase domain . to identify the protein domains required for interaction with _PROTEIN_ and pm localization we designed _PROTEIN_ derivatives and coexpressed them with _PROTEIN_ . deleting the sp ec and tm of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a fusion protein of kd that was detected in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ and failed to relocate _PROTEIN_ to the pm upon coexpression . crn encodes a mutant protein that carries an amino acid exchange in the tm which shortens the predicted tm from to only amino acids . the mutant phenotype was explained by _PROTEIN_ protein mislocalization or instability . we found that crn _METHOD_ was stably _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ localized . coexpression of crn _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mcherry induced only a partial relocalization of both proteins from the _LOCATION_ to the pm and very few transport vesicles were detectable . we then swapped the tm of _PROTEIN_ with the tm of _PROTEIN_ associated receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ a pm localized lrr receptor protein kinase acting in the brassinosteroid and flagellin signaling pathways _PROTEIN_ . even when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ cr _PROTEIN_ was mostly retained in the _LOCATION_ indicating that the specific tm of _PROTEIN_ is essential for _PROTEIN_ dependent pm localization . similarly deletion of the ec of _PROTEIN_ caused a complete retention in the _LOCATION_ even when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed . the _LOCATION_ juxtamembrane domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are oppositely charged with pi for the ec of _PROTEIN_ and pi for the ec of _PROTEIN_ . close apposition and neutralization of these charges may be required to permit the relocalization from the _LOCATION_ to the pm . next we addressed the role of the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ . an exchange against the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ caused increased retention of _PROTEIN_ and cr at the _LOCATION_ when coexpressed suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain contributes to pm localization . however deletion of the entire kinase domain still allowed pm _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ which shows that the localization of _PROTEIN_ is independent of its kinase domain or function and depends only on sequences that allow the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the presence of the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain in cr may destabilize the fusion protein or interfere with _PROTEIN_ interaction . a fusion of _PROTEIN_ with the intracellular domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was retained in the _LOCATION_ even in the presence of coexpressed _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that interaction of the tm and ec of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is essential to direct both proteins to the pm . integrity of the _PROTEIN_ derivatives was confirmed by western blotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . we measured fret efficiency _PROTEIN_ between _METHOD_ labeled receptor proteins for more detailed interaction studies . _PROTEIN_ has to be considered as apparent because the signal was not corrected for background contributions spectrum dependent cross talk and sensitivity . as fret pair we used the combination of _METHOD_ with mcherry which were previously described to be sufficiently stable to enable _PROTEIN_ measurements . emission spectra of these proteins were fully separable from _METHOD_ of plant cells . we then quantified donor _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after photobleaching of the acceptor and calculated _PROTEIN_ as the resulting percentage _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ change . unless noted otherwise all measurements were performed at the pm which required coexpression of untagged _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of untagged _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ depends on the orientation of chromophores to each other and on their distance . as a control for minimum distance we fused _METHOD_ with mcherry to the c termini of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . intramolecular _PROTEIN_ ranged from to . even in the absence of mcherry _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fluctuated by to during the course of an acceptor photobleaching experiment . this fluctuation could result from _METHOD_ chromophore reconstitution during the bleaching period . a similar level of _PROTEIN_ background was previously observed by others for the cyan _METHOD_ protein/yellow _METHOD_ protein pair . in all further experiments only _PROTEIN_ significantly higher than was _PROTEIN_ to indicate close proximity or physical interaction between proteins . these significance levels were confirmed by independent _METHOD_ measurement of donor lifetimes . to analyze the formation of receptor homomers we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ and mcherry . importantly only homomers formed between receptors labeled with different fluorophores can be quantified by these measurements and interactions such as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry are undetectable . _PROTEIN_ clearly formed homomers at the pm . importantly homomers were formed in the absence of exogenous _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ homointeraction is ligand independent . _PROTEIN_ values for _PROTEIN_ were close to background indicating no dimerization . furthermore _PROTEIN_ homointeraction was not stimulated by coexpression of _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ showed significant self interaction already in the _LOCATION_ . deleting the kinase domain increased _PROTEIN_ possibly due to _PROTEIN_ distance between the chromophores . alternatively the kinase domain could promote the disassembly of the protein complex . _PROTEIN_ homomerization must be mediated by the tm and immediately flanking sequences . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ relocalized to the pm and resulted in even higher _PROTEIN_ values suggesting the formation of a _PROTEIN_ complex . we conclude that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ self interact and that the kinase domain is not required for _PROTEIN_ homodimers . _PROTEIN_ homomeric complexes are already formed in the _LOCATION_ and are translocated in the presence of _PROTEIN_ to the pm . for _PROTEIN_ no homomerization was detected . the interdependence between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for pm localization suggested that both proteins may bind to each other . we found the _PROTEIN_ interaction to be the strongest we observed in all our _PROTEIN_ measurements giving for _PROTEIN_ in both _METHOD_ combinations and for the interaction . this suggested that the tm and juxtamembrane domains are not only essential for pm localization but also for the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this cr _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry did not interact . furthermore the mutant crn protein which showed reduced pm localization interacted only weakly with _PROTEIN_ . replacing the _PROTEIN_ tm with that of _PROTEIN_ abolished _PROTEIN_ interaction . interestingly deleting the ec of _PROTEIN_ which caused complete _LOCATION_ retention did not affect the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form complexes via their tm domains and that the ec of _PROTEIN_ is required for _LOCATION_ exit and localization of the complex to the pm . we did not detect interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this is not unexpected because _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and only a subpopulation of _PROTEIN_ is found in the _LOCATION_ before transfer to the pm . deleting the _PROTEIN_ kinase should shorten the distance between the _METHOD_ tags that are located at the c termini of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however no significant _PROTEIN_ was observed . importantly when we coexpressed untagged _PROTEIN_ significant _PROTEIN_ between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was recorded . we then tested whether _PROTEIN_ can directly interact with _PROTEIN_ . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ we observed no significant interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . deleting the kinase domains should increase the sensitivity of the fret assay . for these deletion constructs we found significant interaction between and in the _LOCATION_ . upon coexpression with untagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heteromers were now found at the pm and _PROTEIN_ values increased further _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test for the specificity of the observed interactions we analyzed the behavior of _PROTEIN_ a lrr receptor kinase that was previously shown to heterodimerize with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and possibly other lrr _PROTEIN_ as coreceptor . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the pm as expected but we did not observe significant _PROTEIN_ with mcherry tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or combinations of them . our experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ binds to _PROTEIN_ via its tm . the _PROTEIN_ heteromer can interact with _PROTEIN_ at the pm . translocation to the pm requires the ec domain of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ only indirectly probably as part of the _PROTEIN_ heteromer . thus _PROTEIN_ mediates both the localization of the _PROTEIN_ heteromer to the pm and also its interaction with _PROTEIN_ monomers or homomers .
