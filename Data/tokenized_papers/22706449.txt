xylan is a major component of the plant cell wall and the most abundant noncellulosic component in the secondary cell walls that constitute the largest part of plant _METHOD_ . dicot _PROTEIN_ consists of a linear backbone of linked xylose residues substituted with linked _PROTEIN_ acid . although several genes have been implicated in xylan synthesis through mutant analyses the biochemical _METHOD_ responsible for synthesizing xylan are largely unknown . here we show evidence for biochemical activity of _PROTEIN_ a member of glycosyltransferase family in arabidopsis that is responsible for adding the _PROTEIN_ substitutions onto the xylan backbone . _PROTEIN_ has characteristics typical of _LOCATION_ localized glycosyltransferases and a km for udp glca of . _PROTEIN_ strongly favors xylohexaose as an acceptor over shorter xylooligosaccharides and with xylohexaose as an acceptor glca is almost exclusively added to the fifth xylose residue from the nonreducing end . we also show that several related proteins _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and plant glycogenin like starch initiation are _LOCATION_ localized and that only two of these proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have activity as xylan _PROTEIN_ .
the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins belong to glycosyltransferase family _PROTEIN_ which is quite diverse but is considered a single glycosyltransferase family according to the cazy database . in plants _PROTEIN_ contains the gux clade galactinol synthase galacturonosyltransferase and gaut like _PROTEIN_ clades . the three _PROTEIN_ proteins in arabidopsis that do not belong to these clades have been annotated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the positions of these proteins in the _PROTEIN_ family tree are shown in figure . the predicted topologies of the gux and pgsip proteins are shown in figure . all five gux proteins are predicted to be type ii _LOCATION_ proteins with a single n terminal transmembrane domain . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have between five and seven predicted transmembrane domains with scores above according to the aramemnon plant _LOCATION_ protein database . in order to investigate the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ we transiently overexpressed the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ hemagglutinin by infiltration of nicotiana benthamiana leaves with agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the appropriate construct . we also _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis rhamnogalacturonan _PROTEIN_ as a control to ensure that the results of overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were not a general effect of overexpressing a _LOCATION_ localized glycosyltransferase . plants were coinfiltrated with agrobacterium carrying a construct with the gene from tomato bushy stunt virus which encodes a protein that suppresses gene silencing to ensure that proteins were highly _PROTEIN_ . microsomes were purified from the infiltrated plants and used directly in glcat assays with udp glca and xylohexaose as substrates removal of unincorporated radiolabel by paper chromatography and quantification of the remaining labeled product by scintillation counting . the microsomes from plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein had a high xylan glcat activity compared with the controls . to further investigate that this activity was directly associated with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha protein was isolated from microsomes by affinity purification with anti ha resin prior to activity assays . after purification the activity was much higher whereas the activity in control purifications was at a background level . _PROTEIN_ activity was assayed in the same samples to confirm that the decarboxylation of udp glca to udp xyl and the addition of xyl to the xylohexaose acceptor did not contribute to the activity . the amount of _PROTEIN_ activity was negligible consistent with background _PROTEIN_ activity levels . to confirm that the radiolabeled product was in _PROTEIN_ xylohexaose with an linked glca substitution we digested the product with a specific _PROTEIN_ from bacteroides ovatus . product incubated with the _PROTEIN_ contained dpm of radiolabel while product incubated with buffer alone contained dpm . this experiment confirmed that the label was linked glca since essentially all of the radiolabel was released by treatment with this enzyme . the product was further characterized by liquid chromatography time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to confirm that the product from a reaction using xylohexaose and unlabeled udp glca had the expected molecular _METHOD_ . the compound with measured _METHOD_ to charge ratio corresponds to within ppm of the theoretical m/z of the sodium adduct of _PROTEIN_ and the compounds with m/z of and represent isotopic peaks of this molecule . the compound with monoisotopic _METHOD_ is unidentified but it was also present in control reactions lacking the xylohexaose acceptor or lacking _PROTEIN_ protein and hence is not related to _PROTEIN_ activity . the sodium adduct of _PROTEIN_ indicated that it eluted from the hplc column approximately s _PROTEIN_ than the unidentified compound but we were unable to completely separate the peaks . however we are confident that the sodium adduct of _PROTEIN_ is a distinct compound that was not present in the control reaction . no evidence of xylohexaose with the addition of more than one glca was observed . the product was also characterized by digestion with xylosidase which cleaves xyl residues from the nonreducing end of the xylooligomer but is unable to cleave glca substituted xyl residues . digestion fragments were analyzed by lc tof _METHOD_ and quantified using available xylooligomers as standards . approximately of digestion fragments were released as _PROTEIN_ indicating that the glca was positioned on the fifth xyl from the nonreducing end of the molecule . a smaller amount of _PROTEIN_ indicated that the third xyl from the nonreducing end is also a relatively good acceptor site for _PROTEIN_ . lc tof _METHOD_ was also used to characterize products of _PROTEIN_ reactions using different xylooligomer acceptors . purified _PROTEIN_ supplied with xyl and xylooligomers from xylobiose to xylohexaose as acceptors was able to transfer glca onto xylobiose and larger molecules . _PROTEIN_ showed a preference for larger acceptors as the enzyme was most active when xylohexaose was used as the acceptor and showed less than activity when xylobiose was used as the acceptor . we used purified _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha protein to optimize conditions for glcat activity and further characterize the enzyme . _PROTEIN_ activity increases with the amount of protein has a temperature optimum at around a ph optimum of and requires but not . the enzyme is relatively stable as product increased almost linearly over the first h before it leveled off . the km value for udp glca was calculated to be . we investigated the activity of the remaining gux/pgsip family proteins by transiently overexpressing them in n. benthamiana . microsomal fractions from these plants were assayed in the same way as _PROTEIN_ . as expected plants infiltrated with _PROTEIN_ showed a large increase in glcat activity compared with plants infiltrated with the construct alone . overexpression of two other proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ caused an increase in glcat activity similar to _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of the remaining gux/pgsip proteins showed no increase in glcat activity over background levels . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been shown to localize to the _LOCATION_ . we _PROTEIN_ the remaining members of the family in n. benthamiana with the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase mcherry . all five gux proteins and _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _LOCATION_ markers . none of the gux proteins or _PROTEIN_ colocalized with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ mcherry .
