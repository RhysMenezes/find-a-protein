the _PROTEIN_ associated complex is a highly conserved _LOCATION_ protein complex associated with the spliceosome . we recently purified the mac from arabidopsis _LOCATION_ identified its potential components by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and showed that at least five core proteins in the mac are required for defense responses in plants . here we report the characterization of a putative rna binding protein identified in the mac named _PROTEIN_ and its close homolog _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is a component of the mac through coimmunoprecipitation with the previously described mac protein cell division from arabidopsis . in addition like all other characterized mac proteins _PROTEIN_ fused to the green _METHOD_ protein localizes to the _LOCATION_ . double mutant analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unequally redundant and that a double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant results in lethality . probably due to this partial redundancy _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants do not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to virulent or avirulent pathogen infection . however like other mac mutations _PROTEIN_ partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of suppressor of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a gain of function mutant that _PROTEIN_ a deregulated resistance protein . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a component of the mac that contributes to _PROTEIN_ mediated autoimmunity .
we used the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence as a query in blast and identified two additional proteins with significant sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ encoded in the arabidopsis genome . we named these proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are proteins of approximately amino acids in length that are identical and contain a ccch type zinc finger domain and an rna recognition motif . conversely _PROTEIN_ is a truncated protein of amino acids that contains only a zinc finger domain and no rrm . the phylogenetic relationship between these proteins indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more closely related to each other than to _PROTEIN_ . in addition according to publicly available microarray data _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in similar tissue types although _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at a much higher level . conversely _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at very low levels in dry seeds senescent leaves and floral organs but not at all in any other tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share homology with the human protein _PROTEIN_ and share very weak homology with the yeast protein . these proteins have been repeatedly isolated as components of the ntc/mac in several eukaryotes . to study the biological functions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we obtained t dna insertion alleles from arabidopsis seed centers . _PROTEIN_ carries an insertion in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ carry insertions in the first intron of _PROTEIN_ . semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr indicated that all alleles were genuine _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants as no _PROTEIN_ transcript could be detected compared with ecotype columbia . the leaves of these _PROTEIN_ mutants appeared slightly serrated twisty and often exhibited elongated petioles . in addition _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed shortened roots compared with col plants were early flowering and had reduced seed yield . only plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutations displayed the same morphological phenotypes indicating that the alleles are recessive and that the phenotypes cosegregate with the mutations . importantly progeny from crosses between these mutants did not exhibit phenotypic complementation confirming that they are allelic . _PROTEIN_ carries an insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ . this particular t dna insertion line is annotated as also being in the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ a locus that neighbors _PROTEIN_ in the opposite orientation on chromosome ii . because of this we examined the _PROTEIN_ levels of both genes in _PROTEIN_ compared with col using semiquantitative rt pcr . we found that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced in this line whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not affected . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele of _PROTEIN_ so we named it _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for the insertion did not exhibit any aberrant phenotypes and appeared morphologically similar to wild type col plants . although our in silico analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ is barely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we sought to test the biological function of this locus using a knockout mutant as well . for this we obtained which carries an insertion in the fourth intron of _PROTEIN_ very close to an intron exon junction . like _PROTEIN_ mutant plants these _PROTEIN_ plants also appeared indistinguishable from col . because of the sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we were interested to test for possible genetic redundancy between these loci . to do this we crossed homozygous mutants together to create _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants appeared morphologically similar to _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants appeared morphologically similar to col wild type plants . these data suggest that there are no redundant functions shared between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seem to perform some redundant functions in plants as a double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant is lethal . out of randomly chosen progeny from a parent that was homozygous for _PROTEIN_ but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ were wild type for _PROTEIN_ were heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and none was homozygous for _PROTEIN_ indicating a ratio rather than a normal ratio . a test using these values indicates that a combination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is lethal . from another segregating population in which the parent was heterozygous for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we recovered very few plants that were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . these plants in which there was only one functional copy of _PROTEIN_ and no functional copies of _PROTEIN_ displayed severe developmental defects including dwarfism delayed growth abnormal floral organs and sterility . terminal outgrowths known as enations were also observed extending from the leaf margins of these plants . to further investigate the redundant roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we tested if overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can compensate for the loss of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . for this we stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . analysis of transgenic plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was indeed able to complement _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the transgenics was confirmed by semiquantitative rt pcr . these results further supported redundant functions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and suggested that the major difference between these loci is linked to their steady state _PROTEIN_ levels . thus because a double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant is lethal and overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can compensate for the loss of _PROTEIN_ we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unequally redundant as defined by citation and that _PROTEIN_ is the dominant contributor of the pair . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for _PROTEIN_ mediated immunity as deduced from double mutant analysis between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . to test if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is likewise required for _PROTEIN_ signaling we created _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and conducted suppression analysis of _PROTEIN_ related phenotypes . the loss of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ suppressed _PROTEIN_ associated dwarfism as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were more than twice the size of _PROTEIN_ . heightened resistance to hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolate and pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain was also suppressed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as indicated by quantification of pathogen growth in these genotypes compared with the col wild type . as shown in figure whereas h.a . was unable to colonize _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were as susceptible as col to this pathogen . infection with p.s.t . indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants sustain fold higher bacterial growth over d compared with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore quantitative rt pcr showed that the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of pr and pr in _PROTEIN_ is partially suppressed by _PROTEIN_ . importantly accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ transcript did not differ between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not the likely cause for the observed suppression . we previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unequally redundant and that _PROTEIN_ is the dominant contributor . thus it is likely that the reason _PROTEIN_ was unable to suppress _PROTEIN_ autoimmunity was simply due to normal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the double mutants . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ autoimmunity we stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants and tested for restoration of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . as a control we also stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . out of _PROTEIN_ transgenics nine restored _PROTEIN_ morphology . similarly out of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenics nine restored _PROTEIN_ morphology . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ can function in the _PROTEIN_ pathway and further demonstrate unequal genetic redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lead to enhanced susceptibility to pathogen infection . to test if any of the three homologs are necessary for the full _PROTEIN_ of basal defense responses in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were _PROTEIN_ with p.s.t . and bacterial growth was assayed after d. we observed similar bacterial growth in col and the mutants whereas the well known enhanced susceptibility mutant _PROTEIN_ harbored an over fold higher titer of bacteria in all experiments . in addition when we infected plants with h.a . we consistently observed slightly higher oomycete colonization of the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with col however this difference could not be repeatedly supported by statistical analysis . to test if r protein mediated defenses other than _PROTEIN_ autoimmunity require _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ we also infected plants with pathogens that _PROTEIN_ avirulence effectors specifically recognized by r proteins in col . p.s.t . and p.s.t . avrpphb _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ grew to similar levels in col and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . in addition the h.a . isolates and _PROTEIN_ avirulence effectors recognized by _PROTEIN_ and respectively grew to similar levels in col and _PROTEIN_ and both genotypes were able to mount a hypersensitive response at infection sites as indicated by lactophenol trypan blue staining on leaf tissue d after inoculation . together these data reveal that although _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ mediated defense _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may not be required for other r protein mediated pathways or basal defense in plants . however the involvement of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in these pathways may be masked by the partial redundancy between the two loci . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is a mac component we tested whether _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ and if it is capable of associating with the mac protein _PROTEIN_ in a coimmunoprecipitation assay . for this we stably transformed either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha into _PROTEIN_ plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . the majority of transgenic lines _METHOD_ complemented _PROTEIN_ phenotypes such as morphology and root length . because these fusion proteins complemented _PROTEIN_ phenotypes they should function similarly to endogenous _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed that the fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in vivo by extracting total protein from representative transgenic lines followed by western blot analysis using antibodies against _METHOD_ or ha . all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complementing lines showed clear _LOCATION_ localization when viewed with a _METHOD_ microscope . root cells from one representative line are shown in figure but _LOCATION_ localization was also observed in other tissues including leaves . this localization was not unexpected as the _PROTEIN_ homolog in zebrafish _PROTEIN_ also localizes to the _LOCATION_ as do the mac core proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to test if _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ we isolated total _LOCATION_ protein and immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ ha using anti ha microbeads . western blot analysis using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody revealed that _PROTEIN_ was present only in the eluted fraction from transgenic plants and not from control col plants . association between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has been shown in other eukaryotes as well . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ and associates with _PROTEIN_ in planta . thus we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is indeed a member of the mac . because of the close association between the mac and the spliceosome we previously tested if general splicing was impaired in the mac mutants . for this we monitored the presence of several known alternative transcripts in mac mutants compared with col . we did not observe obvious differences in the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alternative transcript variants leading us to conclude that the mac is not required for general splicing in arabidopsis . however although we have been unable to show aberrations in general/constitutive splicing the mac as a whole appears to be essential for plant viability as all higher order mac mutants so far described _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ result in lethality . probably because of the partial redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we were able to successfully isolate double mutants when we crossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . the morphological phenotypes of the double mutants looked like a combination of phenotypes between the respective loci . the most striking phenotype was observed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants which exhibited severe developmental defects and often displayed leaf enations similar to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . interestingly when we infected plants with p.s.t . and monitored growth d _PROTEIN_ we did not observe a further increase in bacterial titer in any of the combination mutants indicating that the additional loss of _PROTEIN_ does not further impair basal defenses . when we tested the fidelity of the splicing machinery in these higher order mac mutants we again did not observe any changes in the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alternative transcript variants . we also did not observe any changes in these transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . these data indicate that the spliceosome is functional in mac single and higher order mutants and further demonstrate that individually _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not contribute key functions to general splicing in plants even though the mac is closely associated with proteins that form the spliceosome . it is important to keep in _PROTEIN_ however that our analysis is not stringent enough to observe even severalfold differences in the abundance of splice variants so we are not able to address splicing efficiency in the mac mutants at this time . we also can not rule out the possible involvement of the mac in specific splicing events such as those that may be important during the plant immune response .
