the functional genomics approach requires systematic analysis of protein subcellular distribution and interaction networks preferably by optimizing experimental simplicity and physiological significance . here we present an efficient in planta transient transformation system that allows single or multiple _PROTEIN_ of constructs containing various _METHOD_ protein tags in arabidopsis cotyledons . the optimized protocol is based on vacuum infiltration of agrobacteria directly into young arabidopsis seedlings . we demonstrate that arabidopsis epidermal cells show a subcellular distribution of reference markers similar to that in tobacco epidermal cells and can be used for co localization or bi molecular _METHOD_ complementation studies . we then used this new system to investigate the subcellular distribution of enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism . in contrast to transformation _METHOD_ using tobacco epidermal cells or cultured arabidopsis cells our system provides the opportunity to take advantage of the extensive collections of mutant and transgenic lines available in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ that this assay uses conventional binary vectors and a conventional agrobacterium strain and is compatible with a large variety of _METHOD_ tags makes it a versatile tool for construct screening and characterization before stable transformation . transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis seedlings is thus a fast and simple method that requires minimum handling and potentially allows medium to high throughput analyses of fusion proteins harboring _METHOD_ tags in a whole plant cellular context .
we developed a transient _PROTEIN_ method based on batch infiltration of young columbia seedlings by agrobacterium that allows rapid and robust monitoring of protein localization and interaction in arabidopsis seedlings . briefly seedlings were grown in six well plates for days on regular arabidopsis medium . seedlings were then submerged in an agrobacterium tumefaciens culture and vacuum infiltrated twice for min . agrobacterium solution was then discarded and the seedlings were grown for a further days before observation . vacuum infiltration tended to force young seedlings down on the medium which was systematically associated with a low transformation rate and high _METHOD_ . in contrast a high number of transformed cells were observed on seedlings that were still _LOCATION_ after vacuum infiltration . a sterile polyvinyl grid was thus placed on the medium prior to sowing to provide a holding frame for the young seedlings and to prevent their collapse after infiltration . in the absence of a grid we usually obtained few transformed seedlings but its presence tripled the transformation yield . compared to vacuum or syringe based infiltration of rosette leaves this method has the advantages of being fast requiring minimum handling being completed in vitro and generating a high number of transformed cells and seedlings in a limited space . transient transformation was monitored by using the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carrying the binary vector which allows the _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ construct . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was recorded using either a stereo or confocal microscope . most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the cotyledons scattered in individual cells or within cell patches . occasional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also observed in young leaves and petioles . various cell types were successfully transiently transformed . epidermal and mesophyll cells were routinely transformed but stomata guard and companion cells as well as epidermal cells at the cotyledon edges could also be transformed . roots showed a high level of _METHOD_ which prevented easy observation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but were not transformed . failure to transform root cells was not due to the _METHOD_ reporter as infiltration with gus did not lead to any detectable gus activity in roots . however gus _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons showed a pattern similar to that observed for _METHOD_ constructs demonstrating that the seedling infiltration method could be used successfully for various types of constructs . arabidopsis seedlings with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells were used to estimate the efficiency of cotyledon cell transformation . first we investigated the influence of the agrobacterium infiltration medium on transformation efficiency as it has been reported that its composition can affect the rate of arabidopsis transformation . the infiltration medium used for floral dip stable transformation based on sucrose and silweet did not lead to any detectable transgene _PROTEIN_ and produced a high seedling mortality rate . we tested other infiltration media containing mm and acetosyringone and buffered or not with mm mes at ph . these media resulted in more than of seedlings being transformed . we then replaced the magnesium salts by sucrose which resulted in a further increase in transformation efficiency _METHOD_ . vacuum infiltration also appeared to be essential as the seedling transformation rate was reduced by half when vacuum was not applied . the best results were observed with two successive vacuum infiltrations . the effect of agrobacterium concentration on transient transformation of seedlings was determined by testing various bacterial densities in the culture and infiltration media . we did not test the efficiency of various agrobacterium strains as it was previously reported that the laboratory strain was the most competent for transforming arabidopsis . bacteria were harvested at three growth stages i.e . the exponential phase and the early and _PROTEIN_ stationary phases . for each culture phase five bacteria concentrations were used for infiltration . transient transformation efficiency was directly correlated with agrobacterium concentration in both the culture and the infiltration medium . the highest efficiency was obtained with a saturated culture and the most concentrated infiltration solution . bacteria from saturated cultures could still achieve a reasonably good transformation yield even at low infiltration densities while bacteria from low density cultures required higher infiltration densities to achieve similar yields . we also determined the cellular transformation efficiency for each transformed plant by counting the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells per cotyledon . as expected the number of transformed cells per cotyledon was directly correlated with agrobacterium density in the culture and infiltration medium . however the bacterial density of the culture seemed to have a greater influence on the efficiency of cell transformation as use of fully saturated cultures doubled the number of transformed cells compared to early stationary phase cultures . increasing the agrobacterium density in the infiltration medium improved the transformation yield by only except for . in conclusion a saturated agrobacterium culture associated with a high infiltration density led to > transformed seedlings with on average of epidermal cotyledon cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ marker . finally we investigated the influence of the origin of arabidopsis accession lines on the transient transformation efficiency . we tested the widely used accessions columbia landsberg _LOCATION_ wassilewskija _PROTEIN_ or cape verde islands and also accessions used to generate recombinant inbred lines such as bay or shadarah . the accessions showed significant variations in transformation yield with ler and cvi being the most and the least susceptible accessions respectively . we observed differences among the arabidopsis accessions not only with _PROTEIN_ to the yield of seedling transformation but also the efficiency of transient _PROTEIN_ at the cell level . for instance ler showed a much higher number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells per cotyledon than col . having obtained a high transformation rate of seedlings we then tried to co _PROTEIN_ into cotyledon cells two constructs carried in two independent agrobacterium strains . for this purpose we co transformed seedlings with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs that encode _METHOD_ proteins localized in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and in the _LOCATION_ . a large number of cells were able to co _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ proteins . we then monitored the effect of agrobacterium culture and infiltration density on the number of plants showing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ co _PROTEIN_ cells . similar to the single transformation experiments an increase of agrobacterium concentration in the infiltration medium up to an of had a positive effect on co transformation yield with almost of seedlings showing co transformation events . above an of the high infiltration density reduced co transformation efficiency especially when bacteria were grown at low density . we then evaluated the number of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ cells that co _PROTEIN_ both markers . in contrast to seedlings the yield of co transformed cells was not greatly affected by agrobacterium concentration in the culture or the infiltration medium . around of transformed cells _PROTEIN_ both the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ markers whatever the concentration of agrobacterium . however there were two exceptions first the highest culture concentration and infiltration concentration significantly reduced the number of co transformed cells and second an of and for the culture and infiltration medium respectively led to the highest yield of co transformed cells . finally to further improve the co transfomation rate we also determined the influence of seedling age on the ability to co _PROTEIN_ two markers . during initial tests on transient _PROTEIN_ we had noticed that seedlings growing for less than days or more than days showed much lower transformation efficiency than day old seedlings . indeed after days of growth only of seedlings were co transformed compared to for and day old seedlings . similarly and day old seedlings showed reductions in co transformation efficiency to and respectively . the co transformation yields for and day old seedlings were then compared at various agrobacterium concentrations in the infiltration medium . three day old seedlings showed a higher co transformation rate compared to four day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ at low agrobacterium concentration . at higher concentration transformation competency was similar between the two ages of seedlings . we then assessed whether our protocol for transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis epidermal cells could be used to systematically investigate protein subcellular distributions . we first chose to _PROTEIN_ at least one representative marker of the best characterized subcellular compartments . transient _PROTEIN_ in cotyledon epidermal cells labeled various _LOCATION_ compartments such as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nucleolus and tonoplast and also organelles such as mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . as shown previously the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments could also be labeled . we then used our transient _PROTEIN_ system to investigate the subcellular distribution of proteins by systematic co localization with known markers . to demonstrate the potential of our method we focused our study on the enzymes involved in the metabolism of a specific class of lipids the long chain base precursors of sphingolipids . lipids in general and sphingolipids in particular are molecules for which subcellular localization is difficult to determine . one way to partially address the problem is to localize the enzymes that synthesize and modify these molecules . the lcb sphinganine is synthesized from palmitoyl coa and serine and is used to produce the sphingolipid ceramide . alternatively lcbs can be phosphorylated by lcb kinases and probably act as lcb lipid messengers which are either dephosphorylated by a lcb phosphatase or degraded by an lcb lyase . in yeast most of this metabolic pathway is localized in the _LOCATION_ . altogether these enzymatic reactions represent six major enzymes that are potentially encoded by a total of ten genes in arabidopsis . to better characterize this metabolic pathway the corresponding cdnas were systematically cloned as n and c terminal fusions in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ gateway _PROTEIN_ vectors . of the available _METHOD_ constructs ten were not functional in tobacco _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ among which three were still not functional in arabidopsis . in seven cases the _METHOD_ constructs gave a _METHOD_ signal in arabidopsis but not in tobacco demonstrating that homologous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are preferable to investigate protein _PROTEIN_ . to address the subcellular distributions of the various enzymes _METHOD_ constructs were co transformed with known subcellular markers into arabidopsis seedlings and also into tobacco leaves for comparison . the lyase _PROTEIN_ was the only protein among our dataset that had been previously characterized as associated with the _LOCATION_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis seedlings for all the _METHOD_ configurations tested . the subcellular distribution was often similar in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however we observed two cases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for which ambiguous localizations occurred in the heterologous tobacco system . the position of the _METHOD_ tag led to a clear difference in protein subcellular distribution . the most striking examples were observed with the putative lcb hydroxylases ceramidase and ceramide synthases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for these six proteins all the _METHOD_ x constructs showed _LOCATION_ localization but the x _METHOD_ constructs accumulated in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . comprehensive databases of information on the subcellular distribution of arabidopsis proteins such as _PROTEIN_ did not provide a clear conclusion stressing the need for experimental validation of subcellular localizations . the _PROTEIN_ that all these enzymes are associated with the _LOCATION_ in yeast and mammals strongly suggests that the _METHOD_ x construct indicates the true subcellular localization . the presence of an _LOCATION_ retrieving such a kxxk or kxk in the c terminus of three of these proteins suggests that c terminal addition of an _METHOD_ tag exerts a masking effect . the two putative lcb kinases and were found to be associated with the tonoplast and the mitochondria . the mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by most of the predictions in the _PROTEIN_ database . only one protein of the ten showed an ambiguous subcellular distribution that could not be resolved using the four construct combinations in the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . indeed the phosphatase _METHOD_ constructs did not give any signal in tobacco and only one construct was functional in arabidopsis but was associated with variable subcellular distribution . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ g _LOCATION_ m mitochondria pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ n _LOCATION_ ch chloroplast cy _LOCATION_ t tonoplast nd not detected na not available . proteins for which the localization is given as ambiguous showed different localizations in different cells . finally we investigated whether transient co transformation of arabidopsis seedlings could also be used for detection of protein protein interactions by bifc . we evaluated bifc in arabidopsis seedlings using the deficiens and globosa proteins from arabidopsis for which an interaction has previously been reported in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . co transformation with the n _METHOD_ def and c _METHOD_ glob fusion proteins in arabidopsis epidermal cells showed clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ as expected . to demonstrate the specificity of the def glob bifc interaction we used the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ as a negative control . co transformation of n _METHOD_ def and c _METHOD_ glob with c _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins respectively did not give any detectable _METHOD_ signal .
sterile arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sown on a sterile filter _PROTEIN_ placed on arabidopsis agar medium in six well culture plates _PROTEIN_ and stratified for days at . seedlings were grown for days prior to infiltration . agrobacterium tumefaciens cells of strain with helper plasmid and transformed with the various constructs were grown overnight in ml pre culture and used to inoculate a ml culture . after overnight growth at a. tumefaciens cells were collected and resuspended at the appropriate in ml of sucrose acetosyringone . three other infiltration media were tested in this study mm mm and mm mes ph and sucrose and silweet . in the case of co infiltration each culture was equally diluted in ml to achieve the final infiltration concentration as measured by the . infiltration was performed by covering the seedlings with the agrobacterium solution and by applying vacuum twice for min . excess infiltration medium was subsequently removed and the plates were transferred to a culture room for days . nicotiana benthamiana leaves were agro infiltrated as previously described . gateway cloning was performed by amplifying full length cdna with and without stop codons with respectively the primer pairs f and _PROTEIN_ or f and . a second round of pcr was performed using full length and primers and pcr products were purified using a nucleospin extract kit . pcr products were introduced into the vector via recombination with a _PROTEIN_ reaction . an lr reaction was used to transfer cdnas from the resulting entry vectors to the appropriate destination vectors or according to the manufacturer s instructions . gus staining was carried out as described previously . for confocal microscopy day old seedlings were incubated for min in propidium iodide and cotyledons were imaged using an inverted tcs _PROTEIN_ spectral confocal laser scanning microscope . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ samples were excited with or nm argon laser lines respectively with an emission band of nm for _METHOD_ detection nm for _METHOD_ detection nm for propidium iodide and nm for chlorophyll _METHOD_ . co localization experiments using _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs were performed simultaneously using the same settings as above for _METHOD_ detection and the nm hene laser and an emission band of nm for _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ settings were used to localize mcherry constructs as described above . the number of transformed cells was determined using optimas software . images of whole seedlings and cotyledons were taken using a nikon _PROTEIN_ stereomicroscope with _METHOD_ band pass and long pass filters . all quantitative data on the number of seedlings or cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were obtained from at least two independent experiments . at least two arabidopsis infiltrations were performed for each experiment .
