early seedling development in plants depends on the biogenesis of chloroplasts from proplastids accompanied by the formation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . an arabidopsis thaliana gene _PROTEIN_ whose gene product shares sequence similarity with bacterial tellurite resistance c is shown to be involved in a critical step required for the normal organization of prothylakoids and transition into mature _LOCATION_ stacks . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes an integral _LOCATION_ protein which contains eight putative transmembrane helices localized in the _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast as shown by localization of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion product in protoplasts and by immunoblot analysis of subfractions of chloroplasts . t dna insertional mutation of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a pigment deficient and seedling lethal phenotype under normal light conditions . transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that mutant etioplasts had normal prolamellar bodies although the prothylakoids had _PROTEIN_ like shapes surrounding the plbs . in addition the ultrastructures of mutant chloroplasts lacked _LOCATION_ did not have grana stacks and showed numerous globular structures of varying sizes . also the accumulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins was severely defective in this mutant . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein plays a crucial role in prothylakoid _LOCATION_ biogenesis and _LOCATION_ formation in early chloroplast development .
a collection of arabidopsis plants mutagenized with t dna was screened for plants with pigment deficient and seedling lethal phenotypes . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was chosen for further characterization as a second allele _PROTEIN_ of this mutation has been identified which displayed identical phenotypes to _PROTEIN_ in a different t dna mutant pool . as shown in figure both types of homozygous mutant seedling displayed identical visible phenotypes including pigment deficiency and seedling lethality . heterozygous plants of both mutants appeared identical to the wild type . the progeny of self pollinated heterozygous plants segregated as the wild type and mutant phenotypes at a ratio of approximately on non selective medium . the wild type siblings selected from self pollinated heterozygotes showed wild type phenotypes in successive generations . these results demonstrate that these mutations are recessive and that the mutant phenotype co segregates with the t dna insertion . to further characterize the mutant phenotype the _PROTEIN_ mutation was examined in more detail . dark grown _PROTEIN_ mutants were indistinguishable from etiolated wild type seedlings . however after exposure to normal light conditions the etiolated _PROTEIN_ mutants failed to accumulate chlorophylls in the cotyledons . mutants died within two weeks in soil . under dim light conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants showed pale green cotyledons and leaves . these results indicate that although _PROTEIN_ is required for chlorophyll accumulation during early seedling development under normal growth conditions _PROTEIN_ does not appear to be directly involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis . as shown in figure northern blot analysis indicated that the wild type form of _PROTEIN_ mrna was undetectable in both mutants when a probe corresponding to a fragment of region of _PROTEIN_ cdna was used . however multiple and aberrant transcripts were detected in _PROTEIN_ when cdna probes corresponding to another region of _PROTEIN_ mrna were used . similar results were shown previously in other studies . as the transformation vector _PROTEIN_ used for _PROTEIN_ has two camv promoters within the t dna delivered by the vector these abnormal transcripts are probably initiated within the t dna insert and are not functional considering the identical phenotype of both mutants . pcr and sequence analysis revealed that the borders of the t dna were in the second intron of _PROTEIN_ and in the third exon in _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ the inserted t dna was joined to the nucleotide within the intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . for _PROTEIN_ the t dna was inserted between the and nucleotide of the third exon of _PROTEIN_ . the guanosine nucleotide of the exon was deleted . these data indicate that the genomic dna of _PROTEIN_ was rearranged in the mutant genome by t dna insertions . to verify that the pigment deficient and seedling lethal phenotypes were associated with the t dna insertion into the _PROTEIN_ gene molecular complementation was performed . a kb full length _PROTEIN_ genomic copy was introduced into the heterozygous background _PROTEIN_ by in planta transformation . twenty six independent transgenic seeds were selected using the presence of a strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal as a selection marker . four complemented lines were identified that have a homozygous mutant allele _PROTEIN_ background . the phenotype of one representative among the selected complementation lines which is indistinguishable from the wild type plant is shown in figure . genotypic characterization of the complemented line was performed by genomic dna blot analysis to confirm that the transformant contained a homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant allele and a wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene . northern blot analysis of the complemented line showed a wild type band of _PROTEIN_ mrna . these analyses show that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ prevented the pigment deficient seedling growth and restored the seedling growth to that of wild type plants . therefore the mutant phenotypes were conferred by the t dna insertional mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene . dna sequencing of the isolated regions flanking the two t dna insertions and subsequent database searches revealed that these sequences were contained in the bacterial artificial chromosome clone mxc . the mips code for the gene is _GENE_ . although the gene was already annotated as the integral _LOCATION_ protein terc in arabidopsis and recently named as pigment defective _PROTEIN_ in the database of the arabidopsis seedgenes project there are to date no published reports concerning its functions in plants . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a polypeptide composed of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ indicates that it encodes an integral _LOCATION_ protein containing eight possible transmembrane helices . the chlorop program predicted localization of _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast and that it contains a amino acid cleavable transit peptide in the n terminus . a database search using the cdna sequence of _PROTEIN_ revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene is present as a singleton in the arabidopsis genome . a database search for _PROTEIN_ homologues in other species revealed that homologues to _PROTEIN_ are present in a variety of bacteria archea algae and other plant species . the common feature of these homologues was found to be a terc domain . this conserved region comprises amino acids for _PROTEIN_ . however there were no other sequence motives or domains other than the terc domain that suggested the possible function of the _PROTEIN_ protein . terc was first cloned along with other components as a tellurite resistance determinant encoded by the bacterial plasmid . however the _METHOD_ responsible for this resistance remain elusive . as shown in figure there are very few similarities in the n terminal regions among the terc homologues . the n termini of terc homologues in higher plants are longer than those of homologues in other taxa . these n terminal extensions may provide additional functions for higher plant homologues . for example they may serve to guide terc proteins to intracellular organelles . to investigate the relationship between terc homologues in evolutionary history a phylogenetic analysis was performed . there is a close evolutionary relationship between _PROTEIN_ and homologues in the eukaryotic photosynthetic _METHOD_ . when comparing _PROTEIN_ with prokaryotic homologues the terc homologue of cyanobacteria gloeobacter violaceus pcc was found to have the highest similarity to _PROTEIN_ . two terc homologues are found in the strict anaerobic and methanogenic euryarchaeota archaea . in addition there are terc homologues in many other bacterial taxa including proteobacteria enterobacteria eubacteria and high gc gram positive bacteria . previous studies on microbial molecular phylogeny have proposed that there have been extensive _PROTEIN_ gene transfers within bacteria and between bacteria and archaea in evolution . therefore the phylogenetic and sequence similarity analysis of terc suggests that the terc is an ancient gene and that eukaryotic terc genes possibly originated from bacteria . to determine the spatial _PROTEIN_ profiles of the _PROTEIN_ gene rna gel blot analysis was carried out using total rna extracted from various tissues . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in all tissues analyzed from week old wild type arabidopsis plants . to understand the nature of the pigment deficiency in mutant seedlings the contents of several pigments were measured including chlorophyll carotenoid and anthocyanin . as shown in figure total chlorophyll content was the most severely reduced in _PROTEIN_ compared to that of the wild type among all pigments analyzed . the total chlorophyll content of _PROTEIN_ was approximately of the wild type level . in addition it was shown that the carotenoid level of _PROTEIN_ was also reduced to of the wild type level whereas the _PROTEIN_ anthocyanin content was similar to that of the wild type . as the reduction of chlorophyll has been shown to be generally accompanied by a reduction in carotenoid content it was necessary to determine whether the pigment deficient phenotype is caused by the disruption in the pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis . thus this study analyzed the relative amounts of protochlorophyllide in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . pchlide accumulates in the dark and is immediately converted to chlorophyllide a a precursor of chlorophyll a when plants are exposed to light . _METHOD_ spectroscopic data showed an approximately fold higher pchlide content in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type on the basis of fresh weight . however pchlide levels were similar in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ when compared on a seedling basis . when the fresh weights of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were compared the mutants always showed a reduced weight . considering that loss of the photosynthetic activity in _PROTEIN_ led to an overall reduction of fresh weight _PROTEIN_ had higher relative amounts of pchlide than the wild type . thus these results suggest that the capability for chlorophyll biosynthesis is intact in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants as in the wild type . _LOCATION_ emitted signals can effect the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ encoded photosynthesis proteins by means of a process known as retrograde signaling depending on the functional state of the _LOCATION_ . therefore the _PROTEIN_ levels of the _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast proteins chlorophyll a/b binding protein and ribulose bisphophate _PROTEIN_ small subunit were examined . as shown in figure transcript levels of cab and rbcs in _PROTEIN_ were reduced to and of wild type levels respectively when normalized to rrna . however the _PROTEIN_ levels of the _LOCATION_ encoded non photosynthetic proteins _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ and dihydroflavonol reductase _PROTEIN_ were similar in _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . taken together these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in chloroplast development rather than in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway . to determine the precise intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were produced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs under the control of the camv promoter . confocal _METHOD_ microscopy of protoplasts isolated from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transgenic plants showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to the chloroplast as the green _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ chimeric protein co localized with the red _METHOD_ of the chloroplast while _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the cytoplasm of protoplasts isolated from _METHOD_ transgenic plants . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is translocated into the chloroplast . to further investigate the sub organellar localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti _METHOD_ antibody on chloroplast fractions isolated from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . the purity of each subfraction of chloroplast was assessed using antibodies against corresponding marker proteins including stromal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tic _LOCATION_ and the integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited exactly the same fractionation pattern as . the molecular _METHOD_ of the detected protein was approximately kda less than the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of the fusion protein . this reduced size was expected as the n terminal signal sequence of _PROTEIN_ is recognized by the stromal processing peptidase and is removed after import into the chloroplast . thus these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the initial process of chloroplast development this study examined the ultrastructure of _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ plants and compared it to that of wild type plants using transmission electron microscopy . etioplasts from day old dark grown _PROTEIN_ plants had crystalline prolamellar bodies and double _LOCATION_ envelopes similar to those of the wild type . however the prothylakoids of _PROTEIN_ were seen in the form of concentric _PROTEIN_ surrounding the plbs and were observed in of the etioplasts examined for _PROTEIN_ . in addition the intermembrane space of the prothylakoid lamellae of _PROTEIN_ was shown to be about nine times as large as that of the wild type versus respectively . when the ultrastructures of chloroplasts from day old light grown leaf sections of _PROTEIN_ mutants were compared with those of wild type plants grown on a sucrose containing medium even more severely defective ultrastructures of chloroplasts were observed in _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the majority of the chloroplasts from _PROTEIN_ did not have any lamellar structures either stacked or unstacked _LOCATION_ but had many globular structures which seemed to be formed from the fusion of internal _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in internal _LOCATION_ formation or organization during chloroplast differentiation from etioplasts and/or proplastids . taken together these results show that _PROTEIN_ is involved in normal prothylakoid lamellar growth in etioplasts before exposure to light and in _LOCATION_ biogenesis including the stacking of grana and the growth of stromal lamellae after light illumination . when plants are exposed to light photosynthetic proteins encoded by the _LOCATION_ and chloroplast genomes accumulate in the chloroplasts . to investigate how the defects in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ biogenesis caused by the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity affect the accumulation of those proteins and their transcripts in the chloroplasts of the _PROTEIN_ mutant western and northern blot analyses were performed . for protein gel blotting we used antibodies against distinct subunits of the photosynthetic _LOCATION_ complexes and stromal proteins . of the four major protein complexes on the _LOCATION_ the subunits of _PROTEIN_ and cyt f were undetectable in the mutant and the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detected was significantly reduced . the detection of _PROTEIN_ is possibly due to the presence of intact mitochondria in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ that the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody used in the immunoblot assay can detect the _PROTEIN_ subunit of both photosynthetic and respiratory _PROTEIN_ synthases . the levels of _PROTEIN_ and cab were greatly reduced or disappeared in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared to the wild type over the period of light treatment while the level of _PROTEIN_ was similar in the mutant and wild type . these results indicate that there are severe defects in the accumulation of photosynthetic complexes and the rubisco complex in _PROTEIN_ . however the failure of accumulation and the significant loss of photosynthetic proteins in the mutant does not result from transcriptional differences because similar transcripts levels of relevant genes were observed in wild type and in _PROTEIN_ . to address whether the lack of accumulation of photosynthetic proteins in _PROTEIN_ resulted from defects in translation polysome profiling analysis was performed using probes against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure there was no significant difference in the distribution of ribosomes between the mutant and the wild type . therefore these results suggest that the impaired protein accumulation observed in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ mutants is caused by accelerated degradation of proteins rather than defects in protein synthesis . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ mutation causes the disruption of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ formation and results in severe defects in the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins along with chlorophylls on _LOCATION_ . as a result of these defects _LOCATION_ could not be normally converted into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ . ultimately the blockade of chloroplast biogenesis caused _PROTEIN_ mutants to die at the early seedling stage .
