the exon junction complex plays an important role in post transcriptional control of gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ nashi _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are core ejc proteins that operate as a functional unit in animal cells and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer interacts with other ejc core and peripheral proteins . little is known about the biochemical and cellular characteristics of the ejc and its orthologs in plants . here we demonstrate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a ternary complex with _PROTEIN_ an rna binding protein that was previously shown to interact with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer in drosophila . _METHOD_ microscopy indicated that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized primarily in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ is mostly cytoplasmic . in vitro pull down assays using recombinant proteins showed that the amino terminal region of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer a similar observation to that previously reported for the animal versions of these proteins . however we demonstrated also that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has the ability to interact with monomeric _PROTEIN_ and monomeric _PROTEIN_ . immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification from whole cell extracts detected a subtle interaction between the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer and _PROTEIN_ in flowers indicating that the ternary complex is not abundant in plant cells . the regions of the polypeptide responsible for _LOCATION_ import and export were defined using protein truncations and site directed mutagenesis . this study identifies unique characteristics of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared to those observed in animal cells . these are predicted to have important functional implications associated with post transcriptional regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ in plant cells .
to determine if the arabidopsis orthologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have the ability to form a heterodimer as was observed for the animal versions of these proteins we carried out in vitro _PROTEIN_ pull down assays using purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chimeric protein and his tagged atmago . _PROTEIN_ alone did not bind to his atmago however a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ atmago interaction was evident indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction is conserved in plant cells . previous studies demonstrated that the human _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer interaction was disrupted by an arginine to leucine substitution in _PROTEIN_ that lies within the region that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . we designed a similar point mutation at the corresponding leucine of recombinant _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ pull down experiment using this mutated _PROTEIN_ indicated that the amino acid substitution did not prevent the formation of the _PROTEIN_ atmago heterodimer in binding assays . the reduced amount of atmago observed in the _PROTEIN_ pull down product compared to the unmodified _PROTEIN_ was due to a reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ ligand rather than a lower affinity binding of the mutated _PROTEIN_ protein to atmago . to characterize the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and atmago we co _PROTEIN_ these proteins in onion epidermal cells as chimeras with intrinsically _METHOD_ proteins . biolistic bombardment experiments using dna constructs encoding a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ atmago chimera and a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ chimera demonstrated that these two proteins co localize within the cell . the _METHOD_ labeling of both fusion proteins was localized primarily in the _LOCATION_ . close observation of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ attributable to _METHOD_ atmago and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed that these proteins often appeared concentrated as puncta that were visible above background nucleoplasmic _METHOD_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ atmago with the _LOCATION_ speckle marker _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicated that the _LOCATION_ puncta observed in _METHOD_ atmago _PROTEIN_ cells are associated with _LOCATION_ speckles . when the _METHOD_ atmago and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of fava bean the _METHOD_ pattern was consistent with that observed in onion epidermal cells . the structure of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer surface is highly conserved among species and serves as a binding site for _PROTEIN_ in animal cells . using in vitro pull down experiments we demonstrated that atpym interacts with the atmago _PROTEIN_ heterodimer . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ atpym also interacted with monomeric atmago and monomeric _PROTEIN_ an interaction that was not observed for the animal versions of these proteins . to gain insight into the specific regions of the atpym polypeptide that are important in its interaction with the atmago _PROTEIN_ heterodimer we used a series of amino and _PROTEIN_ terminal deletions of atpym in pull down assays with the heterodimer . for this experiment bacterial cell cultures _PROTEIN_ his atmago and his _PROTEIN_ were first incubated at to allow the heterodimer to form . bacterial extracts _PROTEIN_ the various _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were then independently incubated with this mixture and complexes were pulled down using glutathione agarose beads . similar to the results presented in fig . the full length _PROTEIN_ protein bound avidly to the _PROTEIN_ atmago heterodimer . the smallest of the truncated _PROTEIN_ polypeptides that bound to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer was the amino acid _PROTEIN_ polypeptide located at the amino terminus of atpym _PROTEIN_ . other truncated versions of the protein that contained this region also bound to the _PROTEIN_ atmago heterodimer . these results are similar to those described for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding region of drosophila _PROTEIN_ as a polypeptide consisting of the first amino terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ was shown to interact with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer in vitro . we then conducted additional pull down experiments to determine if any of the truncated atpym polypeptides could bind monomeric _PROTEIN_ and monomeric atmago . when the purified _PROTEIN_ atpym truncated proteins were incubated with purified monomeric _PROTEIN_ those truncated proteins possessing the amino terminal region of atpym interacted with monomeric _PROTEIN_ . in addition there was a small amount of _PROTEIN_ bound to a polypeptide that contained the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . when the various atpym truncations were incubated with monomeric atmago the observed binding patterns of these truncated proteins showed clear differences compared to pattern observed with the atmago _PROTEIN_ heterodimer . the truncated atpym polypeptide containing the amino terminal amino acids of atpym did not interact with atmago monomer whereas polypeptides through bound avidly as did . the central and _PROTEIN_ terminal regions of atpym therefore appear to have affinity for monomeric atmago but not for the _PROTEIN_ atmago heterodimer . the corresponding _METHOD_ blue stained gels of these pull down experiments are shown in supplementary fig . . we next determined the subcellular localization of atpym using _METHOD_ labeling and transient _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ atpym fusion protein . when arabidopsis suspension cells were incubated with antisera raised against atpym and analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy the observed _METHOD_ signal was primarily _LOCATION_ . in contrast cells probed with antisera raised against _PROTEIN_ showed strong _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ however some _LOCATION_ labeling was also apparent at levels that were above background . this was similar to the localization pattern of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in transformed onion epidermal cells . the _LOCATION_ localization of atpym was apparent also in onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ atpym fusion protein . when onion epidermal cells were treated with leptomycin b a specific inhibitor of crm mediated _LOCATION_ export _METHOD_ atpym accumulated within the nucleoplasm and was concentrated in the nucleolus . these observations indicate that atpym can shuttle between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm with a net accumulation of protein in the cytoplasm . the shuttling of atpym between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ implies that atpym possesses regions that function in _LOCATION_ import and export although a _LOCATION_ localization signal or _LOCATION_ export signal has not been identified . in an effort to identify these regions the amino and _PROTEIN_ terminal truncations of atpym described in the pull down assays were _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells as fusions to the _PROTEIN_ terminal end of _METHOD_ . lmb was applied to cells _PROTEIN_ these protein fusions as a means to block _LOCATION_ export in order to more accurately define these regions . _METHOD_ alone was distributed diffusely in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm and showed a similar localization pattern after lmb treatment . _METHOD_ atpym showed a similar _LOCATION_ localization and lmb effect as cells shown in fig . however the other fusion proteins showed variable localization patterns . the results of these deletion experiments suggested that and are impaired in their _LOCATION_ import as these proteins were enriched in the _LOCATION_ and did not accumulate extensively in the _LOCATION_ upon lmb treatment . compared to the full length _METHOD_ atpym the somewhat higher amount of _LOCATION_ localization of these proteins in cells that were not treated with lmb may be the result of an increased diffusion of this protein into the _LOCATION_ due to their smaller size . and appeared also to demonstrate a reduced level of import as lmb had some effect on export from the _LOCATION_ however a substantial amount of protein remained in the _LOCATION_ after lmb treatment . in contrast the deletions in and appear disrupted in a region containing a nes as these proteins accumulated in the _LOCATION_ in cells that were not treated with lmb . this indicated that the _PROTEIN_ nes is located within the _PROTEIN_ terminus of the protein between amino acids and . along with these deletion mapping data we used a web based search tool to further assist in pinpointing the nls and nes . predictnls identified a bipartite nls that was located between amino acids and . this region was not present in a truncated polypeptide that was impaired in its _LOCATION_ localization when fused to _METHOD_ . to determine if this putative nls is essential for atpym import into the _LOCATION_ point mutations were introduced into this region to produce two mutated versions of the _METHOD_ atpym _PROTEIN_ vector . the first possessed a substitution of two proximal lysine residues with alanine residues and the second resulted in the substitution of two distal lysine residues with alanine residues . these mutated _PROTEIN_ vectors were then bombarded individually into onion epidermal cells . surprisingly neither of these mutations blocked the import of these proteins into the _LOCATION_ as lmb treatment resulted in the accumulation of protein in the _LOCATION_ . when all four point mutations were introduced together into the atpym coding region this protein also had the ability to localize to the _LOCATION_ as demonstrated by lmb treatment . together these results indicate that this predicted nls sequence is not necessary or has minimal influence on the import of _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ and that there are other regions within the atpym polypeptide that are important for _LOCATION_ import . next we attempted to more clearly define the atpym nes . the web based nes predictor netnes identified two potential nes sequences in the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide . both are located near the _PROTEIN_ terminus however only the more distal sequence resides within the nes region mapped in the deletion experiments . site directed mutagenesis of the two putative nes region generated two amino acid substitutions in each region . mutations in the more proximal region did not prevent _METHOD_ atpym from exiting the _LOCATION_ . however mutations in the distal region resulted in an accumulation of _METHOD_ atpym in the _LOCATION_ in the absence of lmb treatment . this demonstrates that the distal region contains a functional nes sequence . two approaches were used to determine if the atmago _PROTEIN_ atpym ternary complex is detectable in plant protein extracts . the first utilized transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ atmago fused downstream of the tap tag . the tap tag consisted of a cleavable protein a domain and a calmodulin binding domain . the tap method has been successfully used to purify protein complexes from several species . the second approach involved immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ and atpym from leaf extracts using antibodies raised against these proteins . tap purified protein fractions from tap atmago transgenic leaves contained tap atmago as well as _PROTEIN_ . however there was no evidence that atpym was present in these fractions as determined by immunoblot analysis . this observation was corroborated by immunoprecipitation of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and atpym and their associated proteins from wild type arabidopsis leaf extracts . protein fractions immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies contained both atmago and _PROTEIN_ but not atpym . conversely proteins immunoprecipitated with atpym antibodies contained atpym but not atmago or _PROTEIN_ . identical immunoprecipitation results were observed using protein extracts from arabidopsis cell suspensions . the absence of a detectable atpym interaction with the atmago _PROTEIN_ heterodimer in leaf tissue and cell suspension prompted us to examine whether this interaction was evident in another tissue type . a search of the on line arabidopsis microarray _PROTEIN_ data indicated that atpym mrna is most abundant in pollen . we then conducted an immunoprecipitation experiment using protein extract from arabidopsis flowers that contained mature anthers . when the atpym antibody was used in these pull down experiments a small amount of _PROTEIN_ protein was consistently detected in the immunoprecipitate . interestingly we were unable to detect atpym protein in the reciprocal immunoprecipitation eluent produced using _PROTEIN_ antibody coated beads . these data demonstrate that the atmago _PROTEIN_ atpym ternary complex does indeed exist in plant cells but to a limited and perhaps tissue specific extent . the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the atpym antibody precipitate is surprising but could be explained by the _PROTEIN_ that the floral atpym mrna abundance is lower on a molar basis than _PROTEIN_ and atmago mrna . therefore a larger proportion of the total atpym protein pool might be a component of the atmago _PROTEIN_ atpym ternary complex than that of the total _PROTEIN_ protein pool .
pcr was used to generate full length or truncated versions of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding regions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these pcr products were used for the production of recombinant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ or histidine tag protein fusions in e. coli and for the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions in plant cells . to construct the _PROTEIN_ and his fusions to atmago _PROTEIN_ and atpym the pcr products were cloned into or respectively and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strains or . the _PROTEIN_ amino acid substitution was produced by site
