plants acclimate to variations in light intensity by changing the antenna size of _METHOD_ . this acclimation allows them to undergo efficient photosynthesis and creates a protective strategy to minimize photodamage . chlorophyll b synthesis by chlorophyllide a oxygenase _PROTEIN_ is a key regulatory step in the control of antenna size . recently we found that higher plant _PROTEIN_ consist of three domains and confirmed that the c domain possesses catalytic function . to investigate the function of the a domain we fused various combinations of these three domains with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and introduced them into arabidopsis thaliana . when a full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was introduced into a chlorophyll b less mutant chlorophyll b accumulated to almost the same levels as in the chlorophyll b containing columbia wild type but the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could not be detected by immunoblotting . by contrast when a _METHOD_ c domain fusion was introduced into or columbia wild type a large amount of _METHOD_ c domain protein accumulated and the chlorophyll a/b ratio _PROTEIN_ drastically from to in columbia wild type . when an a domain _METHOD_ was introduced into columbia wild type a domain _METHOD_ levels were very low . conversely a large amount of the protein accumulated when it was introduced into the mutant . these results indicate that the a domain may sense the presence of chlorophyll b and regulate the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in the chloroplasts .
using cyanobacteria as a model system citation reported that _PROTEIN_ consists of three domains and demonstrated that the c domain alone can catalyze the conversion of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b . to assess the functions of the a domains in higher plants we constructed transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpress full length or truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins lacking their a or c domain . these constructs were ectopically overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to _PROTEIN_ domains so that the amount and localization of the transgene products could be readily monitored by microscopic analyses . because _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast protein it was important that the transgene constructs be designed to encode a transit peptide that would facilitate import specific for chloroplasts . to date the exact transit peptide sequence for _PROTEIN_ has not been determined experimentally thus we predicted the transit peptide region in the _PROTEIN_ sequence according to the methods of citation and citation . citation proposed that the transit peptides of higher plants have a common secondary helix structure . in the _PROTEIN_ sequence computer assisted analysis predicted that the n terminal residues fold into this same structure . a neural network based method for cleavage site predictions developed by citation predicted that the transit sequence is cleaved after the first residues . furthermore the n terminal residues were not highly conserved between _PROTEIN_ and oscao . thus we hypothesized that the n terminal residues contain a transit peptide that would facilitate import into chloroplasts . as a method to confirm that the n terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ sufficiently guided the transgene products to the chloroplasts we analyzed transgenic plants that overexpressed the n terminal residues fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ signals in the transgenic tp _METHOD_ plants were observed exclusively in the chloroplasts . by contrast _METHOD_ constructs that lacked the n terminal residues _METHOD_ did not target to chloroplasts . based on these experiments the n terminal residues were used to guide transgene products to chloroplasts in the experiments that followed . before constructing transgenic plants that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ proteins lacking a or c domains we produced transgenic plants that overexpress the entire _PROTEIN_ sequence fused to _METHOD_ . this experiment was designed to determine whether an intact native _PROTEIN_ protein is required for chlorophyll b biosynthesis . it has been reported that either c or n terminal _METHOD_ fusion influences protein functions in different manners . thus we tested the effect of _METHOD_ fusion to either the c or the n terminus _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on chlorophyll b biosynthesis and intracellular _PROTEIN_ localization . the constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were introduced into a columbia background chlorophyll b less mutant . this mutant contains a bp deletion in the intrinsic _PROTEIN_ gene and is rendered unable to synthesize chlorophyll b . because lacks the ability to synthesize chlorophyll b any chlorophyll b accumulation resulting from transformation with our various gene constructs would allow us to individually assess the contribution of transgene products to chlorophyll b synthesis . overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins complemented the chlorophyll b less phenotype of . specifically transgenic plants overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ at the c terminus _METHOD_ or the n terminus _METHOD_ showed similar chlorophyll a/b ratios of or respectively . these values were similar to that of the columbia wild type . total chlorophyll levels per fresh weight of rosette leaves of mutant were of columbia wild type levels however chlorophyll levels were rescued by overexpression of either tp abc _METHOD_ or tp _METHOD_ abc . therefore we conclude that _METHOD_ fusion to either the c or the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ does not interfere with chlorophyll b biosynthesis . overexpression of the full length _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ slightly _PROTEIN_ the chlorophyll a/b ratio in the columbia wild type background . these results indicate that overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene by the camv promoter only slightly increased the rate of chlorophyll b biosynthesis . chlorophyll accumulation in the transformants as a method to determine intracellular and intraorganelle localization transgenic plants overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were examined by confocal microscopy . however _METHOD_ signals were not observed in any of the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants that _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll b synthesizing capacity . the abc _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ abc proteins were not detected by immunoblotting with either anti _METHOD_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in transgenic plants overexpressing mrna for the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . the results of confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis suggest that a low level accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein was sufficient for normal chlorophyll b biosynthesis . we constructed transgenic plants that overexpressed the c domain of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the columbia wild type and mutants . the chlorophyll a/b ratios of these transgenic columbia wild type and plants were and respectively . these values were significantly lower than that of the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . these results indicate that the c domain alone is sufficient for chlorophyll b biosynthesis and that the presence of the a domain in the _PROTEIN_ protein has a contrasting function inhibiting chlorophyll b biosynthesis . transgenic tp _METHOD_ bc mrna levels were similar to those of tp abc _METHOD_ or tp _METHOD_ abc transgenic plants . the significantly _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll a/b ratio observed in the transgenic tp _METHOD_ bc plants was not attributed to enhanced _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation . total chlorophyll levels per fresh weight of rosette leaves in transgenic plants _METHOD_ were almost the same as in the columbia wild type . these results suggest that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ mrnas changed chlorophyll a/b ratios but did not alter total chlorophyll levels . in contrast with mrna levels a significant difference in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein levels was observed in the tp _METHOD_ bc and the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . in tp _METHOD_ bc transgenic plants confocal microscopy detected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in chloroplasts and anti _METHOD_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies detected significant protein accumulation at the predicted molecular size . however in tp abc _METHOD_ or tp _METHOD_ abc transgenic plants transgenic protein accumulation was below a detectable level by confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis . these results indicate that increased chlorophyll b accumulation in the tp _METHOD_ bc plants was a result of increased _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation and suggest that the a domain may suppress _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation . these results were confirmed in the transgenic plants that lacked _METHOD_ . when the complete _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ without the a domain or _PROTEIN_ without the a and b domains genes were introduced into mutants the chlorophyll b less mutant phenotype was rescued . immunoblot analysis could not detect _PROTEIN_ proteins with the columbia wild type or even in the tp abc overexpressing lines . weak bands of kd were observed and it was concluded that these bands were not _PROTEIN_ . this conclusion was reached because identical bands were also observed in the mutant and in background transgenic plants . the mutant has a defective _PROTEIN_ gene and therefore can not produce appropriately sized _PROTEIN_ protein . on the other hand a large amount of _PROTEIN_ proteins accumulated when the a domain was removed . these data suggest that the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ proteins was not affected by _METHOD_ but was regulated by the a domain . we also observed a slight increase in _PROTEIN_ accumulation when the b domain was removed . although these results are reproducible further experimentation is warranted and necessary to clarify the physiological function of the b domain . the _METHOD_ signals in tp _METHOD_ bc plants were observed by confocal microscopy at peripheral and internal regions of chloroplasts . we constructed transgenic plants that overexpress the envelope specific protein _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal fusion to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ signals of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were targeted to chloroplasts and showed a _PROTEIN_ like distribution pattern around the chloroplasts . the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ bc in chloroplasts were similar to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . additionally the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ bc proteins inside the chloroplasts almost overlapped with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the signals inside the chloroplasts formed a gradation pattern and stronger and weaker patches of _METHOD_ were evident . chloroplasts were isolated from tp _METHOD_ bc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants and envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were fractionated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in envelope fractions and lhcb proteins were found exclusively in fractions associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results indicate that chloroplast envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were effectively separated by sucrose gradient separation . by contrast _METHOD_ bc was found in both envelope and _LOCATION_ fractions . these results were consistent with those obtained with confocal microscopy and strongly suggest that the _METHOD_ bc proteins are localized on envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . considering the inhibitory function of the a domain on _PROTEIN_ accumulation it is possible to speculate that when chlorophyll b synthesis is in excess the a domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels . however if the transgene constructs contain a catalytic c domain chlorophyll b is inevitably synthesized in both columbia wild type and mutant backgrounds and the effects of chlorophyll b on protein accumulation can not be examined . to overcome this problem we compared the accumulation of the fusion protein of the a domain and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the presence or absence of chlorophyll b. chlorophyll b did not accumulate in the transgenic plants and overexpression of the tp ab _METHOD_ gene did not change the chlorophyll a/b ratio in transgenic columbia wild type plants . _METHOD_ signals of tp ab _METHOD_ were found in chloroplasts in the transgenic background . in contrast with the background no _METHOD_ signal was observed in the columbia wild type background . these results were also supported by immunoblotting with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . significant amounts of the transgene products were observed in the background whereas little transgene product was observed in the columbia wild type background . with the exception of the weak signals of ab _METHOD_ similar results were obtained with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . it is likely that this was attributable to the weak reactivity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies against the a domain . these results indicate that the presence of the a domain prevents protein accumulation only when chlorophyll b is accumulated . immunoblot analysis with tp ab _METHOD_ plants showed that the a domain downregulated the accumulation of ab _METHOD_ in the presence of chlorophyll b . however tp ab _METHOD_ mrna levels were almost the same in both columbia wild type and backgrounds . to clarify whether chlorophyll b regulates the accumulation of ab _METHOD_ at the translational level we investigated the distribution of tp ab _METHOD_ mrna in polysome gradients . rna gel blot analysis of tp ab _METHOD_ mrna showed that almost all of the mrna associated with ribosomes in both columbia wild type and backgrounds . there was no significant difference in the distribution profiles between the two plants which indicates that chlorophyll b does not influence the translation activity of tp ab _METHOD_ mrna . _PROTEIN_ mrna distributed to polysome and nonpolysome fractions indicating that a part of _PROTEIN_ mrna was not translated . however tp ab _METHOD_ mrna distributed only to polysomal fractions in both the columbia wild type and . this specific distribution may be caused by the tobacco mosaic virus sequence in tp ab _METHOD_ mrna which increases translational efficiency .
