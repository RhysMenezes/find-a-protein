hydrogen sulfide is an important signaling molecule comparable with nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide in plants . the underlying mechanism of its action is unknown although it has been proposed to be s sulfhydration . this post translational modification converts the thiol groups of cysteines within proteins to persulfides resulting in functional changes of the proteins . in arabidopsis thaliana s sulfhydrated proteins have been identified including the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in this work we studied the regulation of sulfide on the subcellular localization of these proteins using two different approaches . we generated _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant defective in the l cysteine desulfhydrase _PROTEIN_ responsible for the generation of sulfide in the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signal was detected in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ of epidermal cells although with reduced _LOCATION_ localization in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type and exogenous sulfide treatment resulted in similar signals in _LOCATION_ in both backgrounds . the second approach consisted of the immunoblot analysis of the _PROTEIN_ endogenous proteins in enriched _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ protein extracts and similar results were obtained . a significant reduction in the total amount of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ in comparison with the wild type was determined and exogenous sulfide significantly increased the protein levels in the _LOCATION_ in both plants with a stronger response in the wild type . moreover the presence of an s sulfhydrated cysteine residue on _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we conclude that sulfide enhances the _LOCATION_ localization of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase .
gapdh was identified and widely characterized as a protein that undergoes post translational modification by s sulfhydration on its cysteine residues and this modification alters the catalytic activities of the enzyme . because gapdh _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are translocated to the _LOCATION_ we studied the effects of _PROTEIN_ sulfide production in the _PROTEIN_ mutant on _LOCATION_ partitioning . to elucidate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused constructs with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were created under a camv promoter and used to obtain stable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants on both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . _METHOD_ signals were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope in leaves from day old plants . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ reproducibly in wild type background transgenic plants . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric proteins were primarily localized in the cytoplasm cell periphery and the perinuclear region in _PROTEIN_ mutant overexpression lines with reduced _LOCATION_ localization compared with wild type plants . because _PROTEIN_ mutant plants show a reduction in endogenous sulfide compared with wild type plants our results may suggest that sulfide induces the _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ enzymes . to corroborate this observation we analyzed the effects of exogenous sulfide treatment on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in leaves from plants grown under physiological conditions which were treated exogenously for h with sodium hydrosulfide . transgenic wild type background plants did not exhibit any significant changes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization due to the sulfide treatment they were localized in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . however chimeric proteins were significantly detected in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm in mutant _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants that were sulfide treated . _LOCATION_ staining was performed with on the same samples to ensure that our observation reflected true _LOCATION_ localization and there was clear staining of the _LOCATION_ that co localized with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ observed in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . the quantification of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities revealed significantly fewer _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ background transgenic plants compared with the _LOCATION_ in wild type background plants furthermore exogenous sulfide treatment resulted in similar _METHOD_ signals in _LOCATION_ in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . these findings were essentially the same in transgenic plants containing both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . to investigate further these results and the effects of sulfide on the translocation of gapdh _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ at the whole plant level we performed subcellular fractionation of the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm from the leaves of day old wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis plants grown under physiological conditions or subjected to d of sulfide irrigation as described in the materials and methods . _PROTEIN_ protein detection was assessed by immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies either in the enriched _LOCATION_ fraction or in the _LOCATION_ fraction . a kda band of the expected size for _PROTEIN_ proteins was detected in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions in all samples . two other additional bands were detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction with apparent molecular sizes of and kda . the upper band remained constant in all samples and was attributable to cross reactivity with another _LOCATION_ protein . however the lower band present in the _LOCATION_ fraction recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ significantly increased in intensity when both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were exogenously treated with sulfide . these results correlate with our observed findings of the effects of exogenous sulfide treatment on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localization and suggest that the kda band may be a processed or post translationally modified product of the intact _PROTEIN_ proteins . similar results have previously been observed for the homologous human gapdh protein in which a protein band with the same mobility was considered a derived and/or spliced product with unknown functional relevance . total amounts of _PROTEIN_ recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in the _LOCATION_ extracts were quantified as the sum of immunodetected protein bands relative to the sypro stained _LOCATION_ . we observed a reduction in the total amount of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in comparison with wild type plants while the total amount of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm remained constant in both treated and untreated samples . in contrast treatment with exogenous sulfide for d significantly increased _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the _LOCATION_ in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants specifically the kda band with a stronger response to sulfide treatment in wild type plants . moreover the amounts of immunodetected protein bands in _PROTEIN_ mutants treated with sulfide were significantly higher than those detected in untreated wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . to estimate the possibility of cytoplasmic contamination in the _LOCATION_ extracts during fractionation we employed antibodies that recognized o acetylserine lyase isoform _PROTEIN_ as a cytoplasm specific subcellular marker . a _LOCATION_ envelope protein _PROTEIN_ antibody _PROTEIN_ was used as a _LOCATION_ specific marker to demonstrate the integrity of the _LOCATION_ fraction . as shown _PROTEIN_ was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction indicating no contamination of the _LOCATION_ fraction by _LOCATION_ proteins . immunoblotting with the _PROTEIN_ antibody did not reveal protein degradation in the _LOCATION_ fraction . collectively our results demonstrate the effects of sulfide on the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins and suggest their translocation to the _LOCATION_ upon sulfhydration . to demonstrate the presence of cysteine residues modified by s sulfhydration we carried out liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis on the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . the digested peptides under non reducing conditions were analyzed for a da _METHOD_ increase in the fragmentation spectrum . among the peptides identified showed a sulfhydryl modification in one of the cysteine residues present _PROTEIN_ according to the protein sequence . to confirm the identification of the kda _LOCATION_ band as _PROTEIN_ and the presence of the s sulfhydrated peptide in the _LOCATION_ protein we analyzed by parallel reaction monitoring the presence of the s sulfhydrated peptide identified in the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein and two additional peptides of the _PROTEIN_ protein that are lacking cysteine residues as shown in table . as shown in fig . the precursor ion and the fragment ion transitions selected for the peptides vlpalngk and lvswydnewgyssr from recombinant _PROTEIN_ were also present in the kda and the kda band . the peak area percentages of the selected ion transitions of both peptides are conserved therefore confirming the identity of the two protein bands as the _PROTEIN_ protein . in addition using the same technique we were able to detect the presence of the s sulfhydrated cysteine residue in the kda and the kda _LOCATION_ bands in the same peptide as the recombinant protein .
