arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ encodes a _LOCATION_ protein and negatively regulates ethylene responses . genetic and transformation studies suggest that the function of the wild type _PROTEIN_ is primarily dependent on _PROTEIN_ and can be independent on the other receptors . ethylene insensitivity caused by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is largely masked by the _PROTEIN_ mutation but not by any other receptor mutations . the wild type _PROTEIN_ n terminus is sufficient to the activation of the _PROTEIN_ function and the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ restored ethylene insensitivity conferred by in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ n terminus is not essential to the _PROTEIN_ function and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which has an n terminal deletion of amino acid residues restored ethylene insensitivity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ conferred ethylene insensitivity in wild type and the _METHOD_ fusion displayed fast movement within the cytoplasm . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ nag proteins colocalized and the brefeldin a treatment caused aggregation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ associated protein . our results suggest specificity of the _PROTEIN_ function to _PROTEIN_ and that endomembranes may play a role in the ethylene signal transduction .
ethylene insensitivity conferred by the _PROTEIN_ overexpression is almost masked by the _PROTEIN_ null mutation . arabidopsis has five ethylene receptor genes and they are genetically redundant . we investigated if the loss of the other four receptor gene would also inactivate the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . the promoter driven genomic _PROTEIN_ clone was transformed to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in which _PROTEIN_ is the only wild type receptor gene . for three individual transformation lines examined conferred ethylene insensitivity in wild type and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in the seedling triple response assay . as a control the untransformed wild type and quadruple mutants were ethylene responsive and displayed growth inhibition in the seeding hypocotyl and primary root . ethylene insensitivity conferred by was next examined in light grown seedling . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ mutant exhibited small cotyledons and short primary root when germinated under light . as shown in figure light grown _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ transformation lines exhibited normal growth and expanded cotyledons compared with wild type . because ethylene insensitivity conferred by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is substantially inactivated by _PROTEIN_ and our results show that the inactivation of the other four receptor genes does not perturb the function of the transgene ethylene insensitivity conferred by the _PROTEIN_ overexpression is primarily dependent on _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand those lines represent individual transformation events degrees of the function affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation can not be quantified . to score effects of the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ on the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression the transgene was genetically introgressed from individual wild type transformation lines to _PROTEIN_ . as a result the transgene was _PROTEIN_ on the same locus in wild type and _PROTEIN_ effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression can be quantitatively evaluated . in one cross the resulting seedlings exhibited mild ethylene responses . in the generation individual seedlings were classified into three groups according to degrees of ethylene responses . according to this classification we further scored individual seedlings of which individuals fell into the longest group into the second and into the shortest . because the parent had a reduced hypocotyl length when germinated in ethylene we suspected that the second group would be _PROTEIN_ . analyzed by test this was an expected segregation . these results suggest that dosages of the transgene and wild type _PROTEIN_ synergistically determine degrees of ethylene insensitivity . to further study how the copy number of and _PROTEIN_ would determine degrees of ethylene responses three individual introgression lineages carrying different copy numbers of and _PROTEIN_ were scored for the seedling hypocotyl length . lineages homozygous in and _PROTEIN_ exhibited the longest seedling hypocotyl . the loss of one copy of caused a mild reduction in the hypocotyl length . the loss of one copy of _PROTEIN_ caused a greater reduction . seedling hypocotyl of heterozygous lineages was about shorter than that of homozygous lineages . when _PROTEIN_ was replaced by _PROTEIN_ the hypocotyl was slightly longer than _PROTEIN_ . these results further indicate that not only is _PROTEIN_ gene but also the _PROTEIN_ dosage essential to the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . specificity of the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression to _PROTEIN_ was reciprocally demonstrated in the quadruple and _PROTEIN_ mutants . however the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression could be hypermorphic or neomorphic roles of receptor genes in the wild type _PROTEIN_ function will need to be examined in loss of function mutants . in this study the _PROTEIN_ mutation was introgressed to receptor mutants to examine if the inactivation of any receptor genes would result in the inactivation of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene . because _PROTEIN_ mutants phenocopy _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutation was also introgressed to those receptor mutants to examine if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would have same effects on the repression of ethylene responses . mutants defective in _PROTEIN_ and multiple receptor genes were scored for seedling and adult phenotypes and degrees of ethylene responses were scored by the seedling triple response assay . to eliminate endogenous ethylene production the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor l gly was included in the seedling triple response assay . the dark grown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed mild ethylene responses the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited stronger ethylene responses than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the light grown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedling was slightly epinastic and the primary root was shorter than that of wild type . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were smaller in cotyledons and rosette leaves than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . degrees of ethylene responses enhanced by the introgression of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were much greater than that enhanced by the introgression of _PROTEIN_ throughout developmental stages . the _LOCATION_ mutant was phenotypically identical to wild type the introgression of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ resulted in enhanced ethylene responses while _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ exhibited extreme phenotypes . these data suggest that in a same genetic background the loss of _PROTEIN_ will cause stronger ethylene responses than the loss of _PROTEIN_ and that both genes are a negative regulator of ethylene responses . besides _PROTEIN_ does not simply phenocopy _PROTEIN_ as previously described . although the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ leads to derepression in ethylene responses the introgression of the _PROTEIN_ mutation to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ did not alter degrees of ethylene responses in the seedling triple response assay as well as in other developmental stages . this result is consistent with the previous study that _PROTEIN_ phenotypically resembles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . these data suggest that the wild type _PROTEIN_ can not repress ethylene responses in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . northern analysis shows that the _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulates h after ethylene treatment . luciferase is labile upon the reaction with its substrate luciferine and has been used as a real time reporter . whole plant _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis was next examined in transformation lines _PROTEIN_ luc driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in dark grown seedlings _METHOD_ was the highest in cotyledons and weaker in hypocotyl and root . figure shows week old plants that displayed the strongest _METHOD_ in growing young leaves . figure shows that developing leaves leaf veins rachis and flowers exhibited strong _METHOD_ in an adult plant . tissues between veins in expanded leaves exhibited weaker _METHOD_ . for light grown seedlings cotyledons and developing leaves exhibited the highest _METHOD_ than hypocotyls and roots . in northern analysis the _PROTEIN_ hybridization signal appears as a doublet implying the existence of transcripts with two lengths . to further characterize the two transcripts sequence of the end of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was examined by the _PROTEIN_ and we did not identify any alternative polyadenylation site . examined by the _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript gave two major amplification signals and the resulting cdna fragments were sequenced . for three independent _PROTEIN_ and sequencing we identified that sequence of the short fragment starts in the second intron and that the long fragment represents the full length _PROTEIN_ transcript . our data show that _PROTEIN_ is globally _PROTEIN_ throughout developmental stages and has two transcripts . although rte genes are prevalent in higher eukaryotes domains or motifs of known function are not found in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ shares poor similarity with other plant rte like proteins in the n terminus implying that the n terminus could exhibit functional specificity or be not essential to the _PROTEIN_ function . because the dominant _PROTEIN_ activity is _PROTEIN_ dependent functional significance of the _PROTEIN_ n terminus can be examined in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with deletions in the n terminus . in this study two _PROTEIN_ variants with n terminal deletions were each _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the resulting transformation lines were scored for the seedling triple response . we found that each of the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding _PROTEIN_ proteins with respectively a deletion of and amino acid residues in the n terminus was able to restore ethylene insensitivity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for three individual transformation lines scored degrees of ethylene insensitivity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were comparable to that in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . these results imply that the _PROTEIN_ n terminus may not exhibit functional specificity rather nearly of the _PROTEIN_ n terminus is not essential to the _PROTEIN_ function . because the loss of the second transmembrane domain inactivates _PROTEIN_ the c terminus can not be dispensable . our data show that _PROTEIN_ is essential to the _PROTEIN_ function domains on _PROTEIN_ that could be essential to the functioning of _PROTEIN_ were next examined . the _PROTEIN_ transgene encodes a receiver domain lacking _PROTEIN_ variant and _PROTEIN_ encodes an _PROTEIN_ variant that has the three transmembrane domains and the gaf domain . _PROTEIN_ is an introgression line obtained by genetic cross and is ethylene responsive . this line was individually transformed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and each transgene was driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . individual lines of the resulting transformants t _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and t _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were subjected to the seedling triple response assay . because the transgene in these transformation lines was _PROTEIN_ on a same locus degrees of ethylene response in these lines were determined by the _PROTEIN_ transgene . germinated in dark they were all ethylene insensitive and exhibited a long seedling hypocotyl in ethylene . the hypocotyl lengths of these transformation lines were similar indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a same effect as _PROTEIN_ on the recovery of ethylene insensitivity conferred by . these results show that the _PROTEIN_ n terminus including the three transmembrane domains and the gaf domain is sufficient to the functioning of _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ his kinase and receiver domains can be dispensable . in an attempt to identify the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein each of the _PROTEIN_ n and c termini was fused with the _METHOD_ and ectopically _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ or promoter . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion of which the _PROTEIN_ c terminus was fused with _METHOD_ failed to cause ethylene insensitivity in wild type and to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion of which _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ was able to cause some degrees of ethylene insensitivity in wild type and partially rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ failed to respectively restore and confer ethylene insensitivity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type . _METHOD_ patterns of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformed wild type were similar to that of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformed except that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gave a weaker _METHOD_ signal . these results indicate that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is functional and dominant and that its subcellular localization could be sites where _PROTEIN_ exerts its function . besides the _PROTEIN_ mutation may cause dysfunction of _PROTEIN_ rather than mislocalization as previously proposed . laser scanning confocal microscopy shows that the green _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was fast moving suggesting that its movement is associated with cellular structures in the cytoplasm . because _PROTEIN_ encodes a _LOCATION_ protein we next examined if _PROTEIN_ may associate with any endomembranes including the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ an _LOCATION_ localized marker displayed a unique reticular _METHOD_ pattern that is distinct to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ nag of which _METHOD_ nag was a marker for the _LOCATION_ localization . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ nag were coexpressed in onion epidermal cells both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ nag displayed fast movement and the _METHOD_ visually overlapped . because the _PROTEIN_ function is _PROTEIN_ dependent and _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ we next examined if trace amounts of _PROTEIN_ would localize to the _LOCATION_ . by the lscm a three dimensional _METHOD_ pattern was constructed . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed a similar d pattern as _METHOD_ nag and the _METHOD_ largely located to the _LOCATION_ . in addition weak reticular _METHOD_ was also visible in small regions . this result suggests that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ very small amounts of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ nag may reside in the _LOCATION_ . according to its size fast moving feature and colocalization with _METHOD_ nag _PROTEIN_ appears to predominantly associate with the _LOCATION_ . brefeldin a is a fungal toxin and can cause the accumulation of the _LOCATION_ the so called bfa compartments and the redistribution of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ in plant cells . we next examined if the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion would respond to bfa treatment . over a period of min bfa treatment the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gradually aggregated as a mock the ethanol a solvent for bfa did not alter the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . effects of ethylene treatment on the _PROTEIN_ protein were next examined . aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid is the immediate precursor of ethylene biosynthesis and has been used to replace the ethylene treatment . for a period of min acc treatment the movement subcellular localization and _METHOD_ intensity of the green _METHOD_ were not noticeably altered in seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . for prolonged acc treatments the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity gradually dropped as a comparison the water treatment gave a similar drop in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . our data suggest that the ethylene treatment dose not regulate _PROTEIN_ at protein levels .
