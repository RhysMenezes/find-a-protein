pyruvate kinase catalyses the irreversible synthesis of pyruvate and _PROTEIN_ which are both used in multiple biochemical pathways . these compounds are essential for sustained fatty acid production in the _LOCATION_ of maturing arabidopsis embryos . using a real time quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr approach the three genes encoding putative _LOCATION_ pks in arabidopsis namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were shown to be ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ . however only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited significant _PROTEIN_ in maturing seeds . the activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters was consistent with this pattern and the study of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins confirmed the _LOCATION_ localization of these enzymes . to further investigate the function of these two pkp _METHOD_ in seeds comprehensive functional analyses were carried out including the cytological biochemical and molecular characterization of two _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ alleles together with a _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the results obtained outlined the importance of these pkps for fatty acid synthesis and embryo development . mutant seeds were depleted of oil their fatty acid content was drastically modified embryo elongation was retarded and finally seed germination was also affected . together these results provide interesting insights concerning the _PROTEIN_ fluxes leading to oil synthesis in maturing arabidopsis seeds . the regulation of this metabolic network by the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ is discussed and emphasizes the role of _LOCATION_ metabolism and the importance of its tight regulation .
in the model plant a. thaliana the complete sequencing of the genome revealed gene sequences encoding putative pks . comparison of the corresponding amino acid sequences with pk sequences from other _METHOD_ demonstrated that the members of the large a. thaliana pk family belonged to distinct subgroups . firstly a plant group comprising atpk sequences associated with sequences of _LOCATION_ pk _METHOD_ from oryza sativa solanum tuberosum and glycine max could be distinguished . a second plant cluster countained the remaining three a. thaliana sequences with predicted putative chloroplastic targeting signals and other plant pkps . in this group of plant pkps _PROTEIN_ appeared to be more closely related to pkp a isozymes from r. communis and n. tabacum whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were more closely related to pkp g isozymes from the same species . it should be noted that the intron exon structure of pkp genes _PROTEIN_ supports the robustness of the branch point between pkp isozymes a and g. the three a. thaliana genes encoding putative pkp _METHOD_ were examined further and their _PROTEIN_ patterns were analysed in various tissues of the wild type accession wassilewskija using quantitative rt pcr . although the three pkp genes appeared to be ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ they exhibited distinct patterns . relative _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were fairly constant in vegetative organs flowers and silique walls but showed a significant increase in early maturing seeds rising to of the level days after anthesis . although the trends observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern were very similar to those of _PROTEIN_ the relative mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher reaching of the ef level in seeds daa . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not induced and was hardly detectable in maturing seeds . to gain more information about the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the two pkp genes induced in maturing seeds the spatiotemporal activity of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters were investigated . promoter fragments of and bp were fused translationally to the uida reporter gene . the chimeric constructs were assayed for their _PROTEIN_ patterns in transgenic a. thaliana lines . activity was detected in rosette leaves the staining obtained was particularly intense in leaf veins and trichomes . staining was also observed in _METHOD_ and flowers . although sepals and _PROTEIN_ seemed to be entirely stained the activities detected in anthers and in the region of the stigma were _PROTEIN_ explained by the strong staining of pollen grains and pollen tubes respectively . in seeds zygotic tissues were strongly stained . in torpedo shaped embryos aged daa the staining observed was intense in the hypocotyl and in the outer parts of the young cotyledons . staining then spread gradually through all the tissues of the embryo with the noticeable exception of root tips . in rosette leaves activity was restricted to leaf veins and trichomes . the apparent discrepancies between this staining pattern and the corresponding rt pcr data may be explained by a strong but very localized _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . alternatively the stability of _PROTEIN_ mrna may compensate for the relative weakness of the promoter in non stained regions of the leaves . in reproductive organs and in developing seeds the _PROTEIN_ pattern was similar to that of pattern . the closest homologues of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to encode _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of pks . in r. communis transit peptides of and kda are cleaved from the and subunit pre proteins following their translocation into the leucoplast . using psort and predotar prediction servers both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predicted to be _LOCATION_ targeted . similar predictions were obtained with the targetp server _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to verify these predictions the in vivo subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated with the aid of _METHOD_ . a derivative of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was fused to _PROTEIN_ cdna and placed under the control of the camv dual promoter for ubiquitous and high _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was stably introduced into wild type plants . plantlets from primary transformants were observed for _METHOD_ activity . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized in _LOCATION_ this result was consistent with the bioinformatic predictions mentioned above . unfortunately it was not possible to verify the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in stable transformants as no _METHOD_ signal could be detected in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants generated . as an alternative a transient _PROTEIN_ system was used to obtain information about the subcellular targeting of the _PROTEIN_ isoform . leaves of n. tabacum were infiltrated with the pkp _METHOD_ constructs and this material was observed for _METHOD_ activity days after infiltration . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were targeted to the _LOCATION_ confirming the bioinformatic analyses . to analyse the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta mutants exhibiting transferred dna insertions inside the corresponding _GENE_ and _GENE_ genes respectively were isolated by reverse genetics . two flanking sequence tags corresponding to left t dna borders were isolated and were anchored to the genome sequence of a. thaliana in the _PROTEIN_ gene and two other fsts were found and were inserted into the genome sequence of _PROTEIN_ . in each case one of the fsts was isolated from the salk transformant collection whereas the other was identified in the versailles t dna insertion mutant collection . plant genomic dna flanking the left t dna borders of the corresponding mutants were amplified by pcr and sequenced confirming the fsts found . in the _PROTEIN_ line the t dna insertion occurred in the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene and resulted in a bp deletion of genomic dna at the insertion site . in the _PROTEIN_ line the t dna insertion occurred in the first intron . in the _PROTEIN_ line the t dna insertion occurred in the ninth exon of _PROTEIN_ and resulted in a bp deletion of genomic dna at the insertion site whereas the insertion event occurred in the third exon in _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were generated that produced seeds with a modified fatty acid content . then homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were generated that produced wrinkled seeds with a modified fatty acid content . for each pkp gene considered reciprocal crosses between the two corresponding mutants were carried out and no complementation of the phenotype was observed in progenies demonstrating that the two mutant lines were allelic . finally a _PROTEIN_ double mutant was generated that produced viable but severely wrinkled seeds . the transcripts present in homozygous pkp mutants were analysed by rt pcr using siliques at daa . as expected full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ embryos . analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed that neither were upregulated to compensate for _PROTEIN_ mutation . likewise full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ embryos and neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ were upregulated to compensate for _PROTEIN_ mutation . pkp activity was then investigated in maturing seeds of a. thaliana . in b. napus _LOCATION_ pks display a sharp optimum in activity at ph whereas the activity of _LOCATION_ isoenzymes is optimal around ph . pkp activity was therefore assayed at ph in wild type seeds of the ws ecotype aged daa . the corresponding activity increased at the onset of seed maturation peaking at daa before falling during _PROTEIN_ maturation . pkp activities were then determined in early maturing seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . pkp activities detected in the different mutant backgrounds were strongly reduced compared with their wild type counterparts whereas pkc activities were not significantly modified in this material . because of the very small size of a. thaliana seeds pk measurements could not be carried out on _LOCATION_ isolated from embryonic tissues . as an alternative chloroplasts were prepared from rosette leaves and assayed both for pkp and nitrite reductase . the data obtained confirmed that the pkp mutations resulted in a significant _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ pk activity . to understand better the role of pkps during seed development microscope observations were first carried out from _PROTEIN_ embryo morphogenesis to early maturation . in _PROTEIN_ seeds the structure of the three types of tissues comprising the seed i.e . integuments endosperm and embryo appeared normal . embryo development was unaltered except for a slight reduction in embryo size detected in maturing seeds at daa . in the case of _PROTEIN_ mutants embryo elongation and curvature appeared to be drastically retarded compared with the wild type . maturing embryos were smaller than their wild type counterparts exhibiting small twisted cotyledons with irregular boundaries . this phenotype was even more pronounced in _PROTEIN_ embryos . to determine whether the pkp mutations had an impact on seed maturation several parameters were then measured using dry desiccated seeds . a significant _PROTEIN_ in the dry weight of seeds was detected . this reduction in dry matter accumulation was relatively small for _PROTEIN_ seeds whereas that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds _PROTEIN_ by . to investigate the putative impact of the pkp mutations on lipid accumulation fatty acid contents were determined in mature seeds . there was no significant difference between _PROTEIN_ and wild type lines whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited a reduction in fatty acid content compared with wild type . this reduction in oil content was accompanied by a significant modification of seed fatty acid composition . the relative quantities of end products of desaturation and elongation _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher whereas the levels of intermediate fatty acid species in these pathways were proportionally _PROTEIN_ . fatty acid measurements were then carried out separately on the embryo and on the surrounding cellular endosperm dissected from mature imbibed seeds . this demonstrated that fatty acid accumulation was affected in both the embryo and the endosperm . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ constitutively in the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant was able to complement the seed phenotype of this mutant . the sugar content of mutant dry seeds was then investigated . the overall level of sucrose found in these seeds was essentially unmodified or only slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because of the reduction in seed dw observed in the pkp lines the sucrose concentration of _PROTEIN_ appeared to be significantly increased compared with the wild type . the starch content of mature dry seeds varied greatly depending on the accession used . nonetheless the _PROTEIN_ mutation produced a clear enrichment in seed starch . finally protein quantifications found that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds despite a reduced accumulation of protein exhibited a increase in protein concentration compared with the wild type . to test whether seed germination was affected by the pkp mutations germination assays were carried out on solidified agarose with freshly harvested seeds . when germinated in the light _PROTEIN_ seeds were only slightly retarded compared with the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited a severely _PROTEIN_ germination rate . in addition the germination rate of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was dramatically reduced after months of dry storage . assays of pk activities realized on germinating seeds days after illumination revealed a _PROTEIN_ in pkp activity but also a _METHOD_ increase in pkc activity in mutant material especially in _PROTEIN_ and in the double mutant . citation have shown that the oil stored in the endosperm of a. thaliana seeds was necessary to fuel hypocotyl elongation of seedlings germinated in the dark . as both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm and pkp mutants exhibited a reduced oil content in this tissue germination assays were performed in the dark . under these conditions the percentage of germination of _PROTEIN_ seeds after days was only of that of wild type . the reduction in percentage germination was much more pronounced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . after days in the dark pkp seedlings exhibited shorter hypocotyls compared with the wild type with this phenotype being particularly pronounced in the double mutant . to test whether these phenotypes resulted from the lack of _PROTEIN_ resources available in pkp seeds similar assays were performed in the presence of mm sucrose . none of the phenotypes mentioned above could be rescued by the addition of exogenous sugars . apart from this _PROTEIN_ germination rate and a marked delay observed in the growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines neither the structure nor the fitness of the plants seemed to be affected by the pkp mutations at least under optimal growth conditions .
