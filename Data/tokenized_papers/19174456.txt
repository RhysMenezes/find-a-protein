enzyme screens with strep tagged recombinant proteins and _PROTEIN_ studies with the respective green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions have been employed to examine the functional activities and subcellular localization of members of the arabidopsis glutathione transferase _PROTEIN_ superfamily . fifty one of _PROTEIN_ family members were transcribed and found to _PROTEIN_ as functional glutathione dependent enzymes in escherichia coli . functional redundancy was observed and in particular three theta class _PROTEIN_ showed conserved activities as hydroperoxide reducing glutathione peroxidases . when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco as _METHOD_ fusions all three _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ where their gpox activity could prevent _LOCATION_ damage arising from fatty acid oxidation . through alternative splicing two of these _PROTEIN_ form fusions with myb transcription _PROTEIN_ like domains . examination of one of these variants showed discrete localization within the _LOCATION_ possibly serving a role in reducing _LOCATION_ acid hydroperoxides or in signalling . based on this unexpected differential sub cellular localization other _PROTEIN_ family members were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusions in tobacco . most accumulated in the _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ a family member resembling a bacterial tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase selectively associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a lambda _PROTEIN_ was partially directed to the _LOCATION_ after removal of a putative chloroplast transit peptide . based on the results obtained with the _PROTEIN_ it was concluded that these proteins can exert identical protective functions in differing subcellular compartments .
as a first step in studying the whole family of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence for each _PROTEIN_ was amplified with pcr products indicating that the respective gene was indeed transcribed . these clones were then _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified recombinant proteins assayed to survey for typical _PROTEIN_ activities . the cloning and characterization of the _PROTEIN_ dhars and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis has been reported previously . their further analysis was restricted to their amplification and cloning into the new _PROTEIN_ vectors to study their subsequent sub cellular localization in planta . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dhars were successfully amplified all without any n terminal targeting peptides . in the case of and _PROTEIN_ no amplification products were obtained and since there is no evidence of transcripts for these genes it was concluded that they were probably pseudogenes . cdnas encoding all _PROTEIN_ and of the _PROTEIN_ were amplified from arabidopsis . of the products obtained _PROTEIN_ was cloned as the splice variant without a _LOCATION_ targeting peptide since this has been shown to be the major form in vivo . _PROTEIN_ could not be amplified and no attempt was made to clone _PROTEIN_ which is not encoded within the sequenced arabidopsis genome . the polypeptide sequences of the cloned _PROTEIN_ matched those predicted from the tair genome annotation with two exceptions . _PROTEIN_ had a frame shift but was identical to embl cdna sequence while _PROTEIN_ had a bp downstream shift in the start of the second exon . thus was the only possible pseudogene of those tested . for the theta _PROTEIN_ three genes lie adjacent to one another on chromosome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unusual in being annotated as _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal myb like dna binding protein fusion . an examination of the c terminal sequences of the three previously identified arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ identified c terminal skm or ski motifs which would be anticipated to target these proteins to the _LOCATION_ . however with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes the c terminal myb like extensions masked the putative _LOCATION_ targeting signal . pcr based cloning successfully amplified the short _METHOD_ of all three genes with _PROTEIN_ amplified by mis priming with _PROTEIN_ primers which introduced an additional methionine at the n terminus but did not alter the c terminus . the resulting amplification products encoded the kda proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . a long splice variant of _PROTEIN_ could also be amplified encoding the kda _PROTEIN_ myb fusion _PROTEIN_ . although not isolated splice variants of _PROTEIN_ encoding the _PROTEIN_ myb fusion _PROTEIN_ have also been reported in the dna databases . in total arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were found to be transcribed with the respective coding sequences recovered by pcr amplification . a custom vector system was developed to provide inducible high level _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in recombinant e. coli using an n terminal strep tag ii . this pet _PROTEIN_ vector was engineered to minimize restriction enzyme incompatibility by utilizing flanking bp cutters for routine use with additional flanking bp rare cutters introduced for problem sequences . using this vector all cloned _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . focusing on the phi tau and theta class enzymes a total of _PROTEIN_ could be purified as soluble proteins using strep tactin affinity chromatography . only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were undetectable in the soluble fraction . in all cases _METHOD_ analysis of purified _PROTEIN_ showed they had undergone cleavage of the n terminal methionine with the revealed alanine residue of the strep tag oligopeptide undergoing partial n acetylation an unusual post translational modification in e. coli . several _PROTEIN_ were found to co purify protein contaminants which were identified by peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting . notably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to co purify ribosomal proteins and _PROTEIN_ co purified the chaperone groel . a number of preparations contained a kda polypeptide identified as the subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase which was therefore presumed to be a non specific contaminant . for the theta class _PROTEIN_ ethidium bromide counterstaining of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained _LOCATION_ acids while _PROTEIN_ showed only minor contamination . to test for functionality recombinant phi tau and theta class _PROTEIN_ were assayed for activity toward typical _PROTEIN_ substrates . gsh conjugating activity was assessed using the model xenobiotic substrate cdnb as well as bitc the latter being a potential natural _PROTEIN_ substrate in cruciferous plants derived from the degradation of _PROTEIN_ . gsh dependent peroxidase activity was routinely determined with cumene hydroperoxide . to examine the linkage between enzyme activity and relatedness the results of these assays are represented with the _PROTEIN_ clustered on the basis of their polypeptide sequence similarities . several of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could not be assayed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could not be cloned or only _PROTEIN_ as insoluble proteins while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were only obtained in very low yields . of the remaining recombinant proteins showed gsh dependent enzyme activity with only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ being inactive toward the three substrates tested . closely related _PROTEIN_ showed a similar spectrum of enzyme activities although absolute values for specific activities between enzymes varied . the conjugation of cdnb was the most commonly observed enzyme activity though it varied over three orders of magnitude within the superfamily . bitc was a more discriminating _PROTEIN_ substrate being acted on by most tau class enzymes but rarely by the _PROTEIN_ . the majority of the _PROTEIN_ also had some gpox activity with _PROTEIN_ having particularly high activity . when the three _PROTEIN_ were assayed these enzymes were shown to be highly active as gpoxs . to explore these activities in greater detail two fatty acid hydroperoxides were prepared and found to be excellent gpox substrates . this was in contrast to _PROTEIN_ which although showing high gpox activity towards cumene hydroperoxide showed little activity toward the fatty acid hydroperoxides that are likely substrates of gpoxs in planta .

also shown are theta class _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ assayed for gpox activity with the additional substrates hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid and hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic acid . each _PROTEIN_ name is suffixed with a key describing the associated analysis c successfully cloned a purified recombinant protein assayed p recombinant protein purified but not assayed i recombinant protein totally insoluble y recombinant protein not available in sufficient yield/purity for assay s subcellular localization studied a dash analysis not performed . nd no activity detected na not assayed . _PROTEIN_ concentration overestimated due to co purifying chromophores so activity is underestimated . variation in the replicates from the mean values quoted was < in all cases . novel binary vectors were constructed to complement the bacterial _PROTEIN_ vector allowing agrobacterium mediated constitutive _PROTEIN_ of strep tagged proteins in plants . bin _PROTEIN_ allowed plant based _PROTEIN_ of the same tagged protein as given by pet _PROTEIN_ in bacteria and bin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ provided an additional n terminal _METHOD_ tag for visualization studies while retaining the strep tag for easy gel based detection and/or purification if required . for example _PROTEIN_ could be recovered after transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana and shown to be intact and _METHOD_ giving confidence that in vivo _METHOD_ data was not compromised by proteolytic cleavage of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . both vectors facilitated sub cloning from the corresponding pet _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vector by incorporating compatible rare cutting restriction sites . having established a tractable _PROTEIN_ system which allowed for both the functional _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and the definition of their sub cellular localization in planta it was then of interest to determine whether the information derived from these two experimental _METHOD_ could provide insight into the roles of _PROTEIN_ family members . examining the functional activities of _PROTEIN_ and the potential for differential sub cellular localization it was apparent that the _PROTEIN_ represented a class of proteins which had conserved enzyme activities and the potential for targeting to different subcellular organelles . thus _PROTEIN_ and contained c terminal domains corresponding to likely peroxisomal targeting motifs whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained polypeptide extensions resembling myb transcription _PROTEIN_ which were more likely to direct the fusion proteins to the _LOCATION_ . to investigate their sub cellular localization _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana and their localization then monitored by laser scanning confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were each confined to small organelles which on the basis of their mobility number and size together with the putative c terminal targeting sequence of these _PROTEIN_ were assumed to be _LOCATION_ . this was confirmed by co localization with the peroxisomal marker px rk . by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized solely to the _LOCATION_ giving a punctate _PROTEIN_ pattern and showing exclusion from the nucleolus . laser scanning confocal micrographs showing intracellular localization of n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana with counterstaining with propidium iodide . _PROTEIN_ shown are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . scale bars represent . in addition to the theta class enzymes a range of phi and tau _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also tested for sub cellular localization using _METHOD_ tagging . in each case these _PROTEIN_ lacked characterized c terminal targeting motifs and the n terminal transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ was removed prior to testing . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions of all the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and all localized to the _LOCATION_ . in most cases _METHOD_ fusions were also found at low levels in the _LOCATION_ presumably due to passive diffusion as illustrated by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with both of these _PROTEIN_ being described as abundantly _PROTEIN_ proteins in proteomic studies . _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and were practically absent from the _LOCATION_ . by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized entirely to the _LOCATION_ confirmed by counterstaining with propidium iodide . as compared with related _PROTEIN_ examination of the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide sequence revealed an n terminal extension of amino acid residues containing a putative _LOCATION_ localization signal although it is beyond the scope of this work to test whether this signal is necessary and sufficient for _LOCATION_ import . sub cellular localization studies were then extended to other _PROTEIN_ containing unusual sequence motifs . the lambda protein _PROTEIN_ was selected since it has a potential peroxisomal targeting sequence _PROTEIN_ at its c terminus . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to localize to both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ confirming the presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal . the unusual _PROTEIN_ superfamily member tchqd was also studied . _METHOD_ tchqd localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ co localizing with the diagnostic marker pm rk .

the _PROTEIN_ vectors pet _PROTEIN_ and bin _PROTEIN_ were synthesized as described . for plant _PROTEIN_ of n terminal _METHOD_ fusions the vector bin _PROTEIN_ was modified such that a _METHOD_ tag was introduced between the strep tag and the cloned protein . this construct was prepared by amplifying _METHOD_ from a plasmid containing _METHOD_ using the oligonucleotides

with hbs . after washing with hbs recombinant protein was eluted with hbs containing mm desthiobiotin and the column regenerated with hbs containing mm benzoic acid . recombinant protein eluting in a single ml fraction was flash frozen in v/v glycerol . _PROTEIN_ activity was determined with chloro dinitrobenzene and benzylisothiocyanate as substrates . glutathione peroxidase activity was determined with cumene hydroperoxide and fatty acid hydroperoxides prepared as described previously . assays with fatty acid hydroperoxides used these substrates at a final concentration of mm in the presence of triton x . _PROTEIN_ coding sequences sub cloned into binary vectors were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens . cultures were mixed with similarly prepared cultures containing the construct to provide co _PROTEIN_ of the tomato bushy stunt virus protein which suppressed gene silencing . cultures were infiltrated into the lower surface of n. benthamiana leaves using a syringe . transformed leaf tissue was harvested d _PROTEIN_ and used immediately for imaging or was stored at until required for protein purification . for co localization studies similar a. tumefaciens cultures containing the constructs px rk or pm rk for labelling of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively obtained from nasc were co infiltrated . both constructs _PROTEIN_ the red _METHOD_ protein mcherry with either a c terminal skl motif added for peroxisomal targeting or as a fusion with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting . after d the
