a great deal is known about the morphological endpoints of plant cell death but relatively little is known about its sequence of events and / or its execution at the biochemical level . live cell imaging using _METHOD_ tagged markers is a powerful way to provide dynamic portraits of a cellular process that can in turn provide a descriptive foundation valuable for future biochemical and genetic investigations . while characterizing a collection of random _METHOD_ protein fusion markers we discovered that mechanical wounding induces rapid aggregation of a _METHOD_ nitrilase fusion protein in arabidopsis cells directly abutting wound sites . time lapse imaging of this response shows that the aggregation occurs in cells that subsequently die minutes post wounding indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation is an early marker of cell death at wound sites . time lapse confocal imaging was used to characterize wound induced cell death using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and markers of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these analyses provide dynamic portraits of well known death associated responses such as _LOCATION_ contraction and cellular collapse and reveal novel features such as _LOCATION_ envelope separation _LOCATION_ vesiculation and loss of _LOCATION_ lumen contents . as a parallel system for imaging cell death we developed a chemical method for rapidly triggering cell death using the herbicides bromoxynil or chloroxynil which cause rapid _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation loss of _LOCATION_ contents and cellular collapse but not _LOCATION_ contraction separating this response from others during plant cell death . our observations place aggregation of nitrilase as one of the earliest events associated with wound and herbicide induced cell death and highlight several novel cellular events that occur as plant cells die . our data create a detailed descriptive framework for future investigations of plant cell death and provide new tools for both its cellular and biochemical analysis .
our investigations of cell death arose from the discovery of a wound responsive _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which was identified in a previous random marker screen _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct encodes the full length coding sequence for the enzyme nitrilase fused to the c terminus of the coding sequence for _METHOD_ . in non wounded cells the fusion protein was present throughout the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm _METHOD_ and was visible as diffuse _METHOD_ . following a puncture wound _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rapidly translocates from the _LOCATION_ to organelle associated aggregates in cells adjacent to and at a distance from wounds suggesting that the marker responds to wound induced signals . based on observations described below we consider the local response at the wound site as distinct from the transmitted response which can spread many cell layers from the wound site . localized and transmitted wound responses of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker . aggregation in cells abutting a wound site . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaf petiole was severed by a razor blade incision at a angle to the _PROTEIN_ axis of the petiole . three mesophyll cells exposed by the wound are indicated by the white arrows note the extensive redistribution of the marker in these cells to organelle associated aggregates which is particularly evident around chloroplasts _METHOD_ . transmitted wound response . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedling was mounted in _METHOD_ and punctured above the root meristem . imaging was initiated after an second delay between the wound and alignment of the root tip with field of view . aggregates become evident several cell layers removed from the wound site . times shown are in minutes . the image shown in a and b are dimensional reconstruction of a z series taken min after wounding . chloroplasts are visible because of their red _METHOD_ . images in c are single optical sections . scale bars a b c . to characterize the local response we imaged cells in the direct vicinity of puncture wounds administered to hypocotyls or cotyledon tissue of transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . we observed that a variable number of cells in the wound site displayed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates and rounded _LOCATION_ . time lapse imaging of several wound zones demonstrated that after forming _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates these cells displayed _LOCATION_ contraction followed by dramatic cellular collapse . these two responses _LOCATION_ are morphological hallmarks of cell death during the hr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and suggested that the local _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ response marks one component of a more general wound triggered cell death response . unlike the local response we found that the transmitted response was reversible with cytoplasmic streaming resuming concomitant with disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates . thus our observations suggest _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation does not mark a point of commitment to cell death in all cells . it does however mark an early stage of a distinct cell death process that operates in cells abutting the wound site . _LOCATION_ and cellular collapse during the wound response . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line was wounded and a confocal z series was immediately collected at sec intervals from a region abutting the wound . _LOCATION_ contraction of a _LOCATION_ in a wound proximal cotyledon epidermal cell that after wounding displayed the aggregation response then collapsed . cellular collapse by one of several cells in the wound site that displayed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates and contractions . the red arrow points to the edge of the contracting cell and the white arrow to the wall of an adjacent cell . note the detachment of the cell from the wall . reversibility of transmitted response . an agarose mounted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant was wounded above the root meristem and imaged by the acquisition of z series at min intervals for min . in the first time point after wounding the aggregation response had spread throughout much of the root meristem . over time the aggregates reverted back to a cytoplasmic distribution pattern and cytoplasmic streaming was evident . images in a are single confocal optical sections b and c are reconstructions from z series stacks . the numbers in the lower right of each panel indicate time in min from the start of imaging . scale bars a b c . to explore the possibility that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein might induce an aberrant cell death response we examined whether the process occurred independently of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . we examined the _LOCATION_ contraction observed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during the wound response using a previously isolated _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . hypocotyls of _METHOD_ transgenic plants were wounded and cells adjacent to wounds continuously imaged over a one hour period . as observed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a subset of cells in the wound site possessed swollen hypertrophic _LOCATION_ that progressed to a contracted state . propidium iodide was included in the imaging buffer to monitor _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity during the response . intense staining of _LOCATION_ occurred subsequent to the major _LOCATION_ contraction suggesting that degeneration of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity is a _PROTEIN_ step . thus _LOCATION_ contraction during wound induced cell death is not an artifact induced by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein a conclusion supported by results with another _LOCATION_ marker and markers of the _LOCATION_ . in addition as noted below we have developed a biochemical assay to probe _PROTEIN_ relocalization aggregation and find that this occurs in wild type plants _METHOD_ . wound induced _LOCATION_ collapse in _LOCATION_ marker lines . _LOCATION_ response in line . following wounding of a hypocotyl the _LOCATION_ first swells then contracts . the asterisk at time illustrates the normal lentoid shape of hypocotyl _LOCATION_ . contraction is followed by a _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ most evident between the and min time points . this is followed _PROTEIN_ by intense _LOCATION_ propidium iodide staining . _LOCATION_ response in a wounded hypocotyl of an line . contraction of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and release of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ into the cytoplasm are evident . note the formation of lobes around the contracting _LOCATION_ . the time series in a and b are brightest point reconstructions . times shown are in min . scale bars a b . in addition to _LOCATION_ contraction a wound induced _PROTEIN_ in the intensity of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in the marker line was evident within less than min of wounding . several explanations for the _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ seemed possible including _METHOD_ destruction alterations in ph that quenched _METHOD_ or the expulsion of _LOCATION_ contents into the cytoplasm . while these possibilities are not mutually exclusive the latter seemed particularly attractive since contraction might cause extrusion of _LOCATION_ contents . the marker possesses a low background level of cytoplasmic _METHOD_ localization that might mask the release of _LOCATION_ contents and also may be partially immobilized from the bulk nucleoplasm by an association with dna _PROTEIN_ . consequently we examined wound responses using the _LOCATION_ marker line which displays a lower level of background cytoplasmic _METHOD_ and does not appear to be associated with chromatin as assessed by time lapse imaging of mitoses . hypocotyls of plants carrying the marker were wounded and imaged . time lapse imaging of cells proximal to wound sites revealed that a gradual illumination of the cytoplasm occurs concomitantly with the _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ contraction suggesting that the _LOCATION_ label is lost or expelled into the cytoplasm . the simultaneous illumination of nucleoplasm and cytoplasm facilitated visualization of the formation of lobes on the _LOCATION_ revealed by negative contrast as the interior of these lobes excludes the _METHOD_ label . since the _LOCATION_ is bound by the _LOCATION_ envelope a _LOCATION_ system contiguous with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ lobing could conceivably occur if the inner _LOCATION_ of the _LOCATION_ envelope contracted without a corresponding contraction of the outer _LOCATION_ i.e . if the two _LOCATION_ separated . exclusion of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ from the interior of the lobes might be expected if this were true since the space between the inner and outer _LOCATION_ envelopes the peri _LOCATION_ space is contiguous with the lumen of the _LOCATION_ and thus isolated from the cytoplasm . this hypothesis is supported by observations of two _LOCATION_ markers an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker and _METHOD_ a kdel tagged lumenal _LOCATION_ marker . figure displays time points from a time lapse wound imaging experiment using the marker line . figure shows three dimensional reconstructions of one image series and illustrates the characteristic lobes that form during _LOCATION_ contraction . consistent with the hypothesis of _LOCATION_ envelope separation optical sections through the mid plane of the same contracting _LOCATION_ shown in reveal a clear double _LOCATION_ structure that separates concomitantly with _LOCATION_ contraction . we next tested the behavior of an _LOCATION_ lumenal _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ during _LOCATION_ contraction and lobing and found that _LOCATION_ at differing stages of contraction and lobing contain the _LOCATION_ lumenal marker _METHOD_ within the inter lobal space . _LOCATION_ lobes are bound by the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and contain _LOCATION_ lumen contents . a hypocotyl of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker line was wounded and imaged at minute intervals by confocal microscopy . the simultaneous contraction and lobing of the _LOCATION_ are evident as a separation of the _LOCATION_ envelope . reconstruction of the contracting _LOCATION_ made with a brightest point reconstruction of the acquired data set . the same data set as in fig . at a single optical section through the mid plane of the contracting _LOCATION_ illuminating the double _LOCATION_ structure and its separation . a single optical section through the contracted _LOCATION_ shows propidium iodide staining of the interior demonstrating that the _LOCATION_ lumen is interior to the lobes . hypocotyls of a line _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ lumenal _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ were wounded . shown are contracting epidermal _LOCATION_ from two independent wound experiments using _METHOD_ approximately min after wounding . the inter lobal space contains _METHOD_ label indicating that this compartment is contiguous with the lumen of the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is shown in green and propidium iodide in red . scale bars . based on our observations that the inter lobal space excludes _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ contains the lumenal _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ and that the lobes are demarcated by a _LOCATION_ system contiguous with the _LOCATION_ we believe that the simplest explanation for the observed _LOCATION_ lobing is that the inner and outer _LOCATION_ of the _LOCATION_ envelope separate during _LOCATION_ contraction . thus _LOCATION_ contraction does not reflect a contraction of the entire _LOCATION_ proper but rather a contraction of the _LOCATION_ lumen and its tightly associated inner envelope . both the _LOCATION_ tubules and the _LOCATION_ envelope contain closely appressed double _LOCATION_ structures assemble with similar properties in vitro _PROTEIN_ and are contiguous _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . thus the death response might be expected to additionally alter cortical _LOCATION_ tubules . to examine this we imaged wound proximal cells of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker line . about min after wounding extensive _LOCATION_ contraction and lobing was evident part of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system had formed bubble like structures but much of the _LOCATION_ tubular network was still intact . shortly thereafter the tubular _LOCATION_ network rapidly degenerated contracting from tubules into small vesicular structures . thus alterations in the integrity of both the _LOCATION_ envelope and cortical _LOCATION_ tubules occur during the local wound induced cell death response although apparently with different kinetics . prior to _LOCATION_ tubule vesiculation but concurrent with _LOCATION_ contraction and lobing we observed that _LOCATION_ in the cell moved away from the cell cortex . since _LOCATION_ movements are dependent on a well characterized actin based motility system _PROTEIN_ these observations suggest that this system is at least partly intact during the earlier stages of wound induced cell death . further investigation of this awaits imaging experiments using cytoskeletal markers . _LOCATION_ vesiculation during wound induced cell death . a wound proximal petiole epidermal cell of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker line was imaged . the panel shows time points after _LOCATION_ contraction . prior to the times shown part of the _LOCATION_ network formed bubble like structures rapidly after wounding . the remaining intact tubular _LOCATION_ subsequently degenerated forming large numbers of vesicular structures . images are brightest point reconstructions of z series collected at minutes intervals after wounding . times shown are in minutes . scale bar . to probe the specificity of the local wound responses we sought a simple method for chemically inducing cell death on a time frame similar to that used for our wounding experiments . many chemically induced _METHOD_ of cell death have been characterized but typically their effects operate on the time scale of hours to days as opposed to minutes . to identify a fast acting molecule we used the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation response to screen a number of herbicides and other small molecules for rapid activity focusing on nitriles which have been used to trigger cell death in other experiments . potassium cyanide while obviously toxic did not induce the rapid _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation cell death and cellular collapse on a hour time scale that we sought . we found that the hydroxy benzonitrile herbicide bromoxynil and its analog chloroxynil caused rapid cell death when applied to arabidopsis tissue at concentrations between . within hour of application to seedlings bromoxynil and chloroxynil induced rapid _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation extensive cell shrinkage and cell death . like wounding these herbicides also induced callose deposition which was evident as early as min after application to roots . the specific mode of action of these herbicides is unclear but they have well documented effects on mitochondrial respiration and also bind to photosystem ii proteins . whatever their mechanism of action they proved convenient rapid inducers of woundless cell death for use in our imaging experiments . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation and callose induction by bromoxynil . day old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants seedlings were imbibed in bromoxynil or mock solutions for h then imaged by confocal microscopy note the exstensive accumulation of the fusion protein in aggregates after herbicide treatment . callose accumulation following bromoxynil treatment . wild type seedlings were treated with bromoxynil or a mock solution . roots were examined at regular intervals under uv illumination using conventional _METHOD_ and a dapi filter set the min time point is shown . callose deposition was visualized using the callose specific stain sirofluor added at ug/ml at the beginning of the experiment . sirofluor _METHOD_ was first visible approximately min after addition of bromoxynil . images were acquired on a digital camera using identical exposure settings . to probe _LOCATION_ dynamics during chemically induced cell death we examined hypocotyl cells of the marker line after chloroxynil application . time lapse imaging experiments showed that prior to the _PROTEIN_ stage inductions of cellular collapse and propidium iodide staining of _LOCATION_ the label leaves the _LOCATION_ illuminating the cytoplasm analogously to wound induced cell death . however the characteristic lentoid shape of the hypocotyl _LOCATION_ persisted throughout demonstrating that this hallmark of wound induced cell death does not occur during this particular type of chemically induced cell death . notable in these experiments was the rapid loss of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which was not seen to the same extent in our wounding experiments . we next examined the response in root cells which also failed to show _LOCATION_ contraction but clearly show _LOCATION_ leakage of the _METHOD_ marker . thus in both cell types _LOCATION_ leakage occurs without concomitant contractions of the _LOCATION_ showing that these two responses can be separated . importantly this observation suggests that the simple hypothesis that _LOCATION_ leakage is caused by contraction induced extrusion is unlikely . chloroxynil induced death collapse of cells without _LOCATION_ contractions . the _LOCATION_ marker line was mounted in agarose and the bromoxynil analog chloroxynil was added to a final concentration of and a z series of the hypocotyl root junction was collected at min intervals . loss of _LOCATION_ label into the cytoplasm and a generalized loss of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were followed by staining of _LOCATION_ by propidium iodide and _METHOD_ cellular collapse . the shape of the _LOCATION_ remained constant throughout the experiment and did not display the characteristic contractions seen during wound induced cell death . the white asterisk identifies the same _LOCATION_ and the green arrows to two cells in this plane of view that displayed _METHOD_ plasmolysis . chloroxynil induced release of marker from nucleoplasm in day old plants mounted in agarose and overlaid with chloroxynil to a final concentration of . an initiating _PROTEIN_ root was imaged by the acquisition of z series at sec intervals . a gradual release of _LOCATION_ label and illumination of the cytoplasm occurs without the characteristic _LOCATION_ contractions induced by wounding . scale bars . inset numbers indicate min after herbicide addition . markers of the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis illuminate a cigar shaped accessory organelle called the fusiform body . recent evidence suggests that this organelle may be involved in cell death but its specific functions are still unclear . this structure is evident in arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ markers _METHOD_ and . in our time lapse observations of _LOCATION_ tubule and _LOCATION_ envelope degeneration using the marker line the fusiform bodies were noticeably absent . this prompted us to examine them more closely using _METHOD_ which brightly illuminates these structures . in wound proximal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells the most evident structures from the first time points after wounding are spheres with fusiform bodies absent . this observation suggests that the fusiform bodies rapidly lose their characteristic morphology in response to wounding . to examine if this response occurs during herbicide induced death we imaged the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker line after application of chloroxynil . shortly after addition of chloroxynil cytoplasmic streaming stopped and this was quickly followed by the transformation of fusiform bodies into spherical structures . thus both wounding and herbicide treatment act at an early stage to effect component required to _PROTEIN_ the distinctive shape of this organelle . _LOCATION_ fusiform body alterations during wound and chloroxynil induced cell death . hypocotyl cell of an unwounded plant showing the normal morphology of the fusiform bodies . wound proximal hypocotyl cell . note the spherical bodies in this cell distinct from the normally cigar shaped structures illuminated by lumenal _LOCATION_ markers . chloroxynil induced transitions . epidermal hypocotyl cells were treated with chloroxynil . inset numbers indicate time after herbicide addition . an individual fusiform body throughout the experiment is marked by the red arrow . by min after herbicide application streaming ceases evident by the lack of movement of fusiform bodies and the tubular _LOCATION_ network which are usually highly dynamic . shortly thereafter fusiform bodies transform into spherical structures . scale bar . the extensive aggregation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ triggered by benzonitrile herbicides facilitated biochemical characterization of the process . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in unwounded plants is soluble and does not pellet during low speed centrifugation . by contrast we observed that the aggregates in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were stable during tissue disruption by sonication and partitioned into a low speed triton x insoluble pellet fraction by centrifugation . this low speed pellet fraction was also found to contain the actin binding protein cofillin but not the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ which resided in the low speed supernatant we therefore used these two proteins as markers for each fraction and as loading controls . the low speed pelleting of _PROTEIN_ enabled us to test for herbicide induced change in the solubility of nitrilase in wild type plants . a polyclonal antibody to recombinant _PROTEIN_ was produced and used to probe proteins isolated from the _PROTEIN_ null mutant . the crude serum recognizes two proteins one of which is absent in the _PROTEIN_ mutant showing that the antibody faithfully recognizes _PROTEIN_ protein the identity of the upper band is unknown and was not detected after affinity purification of the antibody against immobilized recombinant _PROTEIN_ . affinity purified antibody was used to probe plants that were treated with bromoxynil under conditions that caused extensive aggregation in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . in wild type plants treated with bromoxynil at concentrations that triggered aggregation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in vivo the _PROTEIN_ protein partitioned into the pellet fraction . western blots of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed comparable accumulation of the fusion protein in the low speed pellet fraction . these experiments provide an independent biochemical assay for a bromoxynil induced change in solubility of _PROTEIN_ and suggest that the bromoxynil and wound induced aggregation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker is not a fusion protein artifact . biochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ aggregation . extracts from bromoxynil treated plants were made in triton and centrifuged for min at g and the pellet was imaged by confocal microscopy . western blot of protein extracts from leaf tissue of wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant showing that the antibody recognizes the _PROTEIN_ protein in wild type but not the null mutant . aggregation of _PROTEIN_ into the low speed pellet fraction during herbicide induced cell death . three week old seedlings were imbibed in solutions of bromoxynil for h then extracted adjusted to triton and centrifuged at g for min . proteins in the supernatant and pellet were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and various proteins detected by western blotting . antibodies against _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cofillin were used to show complete separation of the two fractions .
plants were grown on agar solidified media consisting of _METHOD_ salts and agar . prior to germination seeds were _PROTEIN_ for days on _METHOD_ plates at then transferred to a growth cabinet and grown under continuous illumination at m . unless otherwise stated imaging experiments were performed on whole day old seedlings mounted in _METHOD_ or an imaging buffer _PROTEIN_ composed of _METHOD_ salts propidium iodide and silwet which was added to facilitate propidium iodide penetration of the epidermal cuticle . to prevent specimen drift during time lapse experiments whole seedlings in _METHOD_ were mounted by adding volumes of molten low melting point agarose high resolution agarose and _METHOD_ salts at . cells showed active streaming after mounting suggesting minimal stress induced by the mounting process . most of the transgenic lines used for imaging in this paper have been described previously _PROTEIN_ but are described here for clarity . for _METHOD_ cdna lines experiments were performed on seed derived from the primary transgenic plants . unless indicated otherwise these lines contained a single _METHOD_ cdna fusion . the _METHOD_ fusions are available from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ at ohio state university . the marker line _PROTEIN_ contains a fusion protein between _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ terminus of an ankyrin repeat containing transcription _PROTEIN_ like protein . the marker line _PROTEIN_ contains a near full length fusion between an _PROTEIN_ delta protein _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . in dividing cells it illuminates chromosomes aligned along the metaphase plate and thus likely associates with chromatin . in interphase cells it illuminates the nucleoplasm . this line also contains a second pcr detectable insert that contains an out of frame cdna fusion to _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ line was generated by wolf scheible by transformation of the _METHOD_ construct on plasmid _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ into the columbia ecotype of arabidopsis . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker line _PROTEIN_ is a fusion between _METHOD_ and a novel protein with a predicted _PROTEIN_ terminal trans _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker comprises a full length nitrilase fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . two lines were used in this study _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which the fusion protein is driven by the promoter and in which _PROTEIN_ is driven by kb of sequence upstream from the _PROTEIN_ start codon . these two different lines possess similar _PROTEIN_ levels in transgenic plants however in comparison to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the line shows reduced _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cells and guard cells agarose mounted seedlings were wounded by creating cuts through plant tissue with a razor blade or sharp forceps tips . image data was collected after a brief period of aligning the wound site with the field of view . during and prior to imaging experiments agarose embedded specimens were covered with a humidifying dome to prevent desiccation . the majority of image series were obtained by collecting deep z series for time points at sec intervals . d time series were made from these data sets by making brightest point reconstructions of each z series using the biorad software package lasersharp . for some time series reconstructions were performed manually in _PROTEIN_ image using brightest point reconstructions _PROTEIN_ . a nikon inverted _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a nikon numerical aperture water immersion objective and a bio rad mrc confocal head with a krypton argon laser . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and emitted _METHOD_ was collected through a band pass filter . chloroplast _METHOD_ and propidium iodide _METHOD_ were obtained by excitation at nm and collecting emitted _METHOD_ through a nm band pass filter . chloroxynil has a higher solubility in ethanol and water than bromoxynil and was used in imaging experiments . both herbicides show similar toxicity to arabidopsis using a germination assay . a m stock of chloroxynil _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was made in ethanol . for imaging experiments a mm solution of chloroxynil in _PROTEIN_ was made and of this solution was overlaid onto to seedlings mounted in of agarose yielding a final concentration of . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was produced in e. coli as a his tagged thioredoxin fusion protein using the vector and purified by chromatography on a nickel chelate resin . polyclonal serum against recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was made by a commercial provider _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ antibodies were affinity purified against mg of purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ adsorbed onto a cm piece of nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and eluted off the _LOCATION_ by treatment with mm glycine mm nacl ph . the eluted antibodies were neutralized to ph with tris base dialysed overnight against tris buffered saline and concentrated to mg/ml using a spin column concentrator with a kda cutoff the concentrated antibody was diluted to mg/ml with glycerol . herbicide treated plants were transferred into a weight volume of ice cold granule isolation buffer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . they were then sonicated filtered through miracloth and triton x was added to a final concentration of . after min incubation on ice the extract was centrifuged at g for min . the supernatant was removed and retained and the pellet was washed by with geb triton x . protein from the supernatant fraction was precipitated using a chloroform methanol extraction protocol . the pellet fraction and precipitated low speed supernatant fractions were resuspended in equal volumes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer typically per mg input tissue . for herbicide induced pelleting week old arabidopsis seedlings were transferred into a solution of silwet and varying doses of bromoxynil . after h incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking seedlings were transferred to an eppendorf tube placed on ice and disrupted by sonication in geb as described above . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was performed using gradient mini gels prepared and run as described in ausubel et al . . for western analysis proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ using a semi dry electroblotter in towbin transfer buffer . westerns were developed using pierce supersignal hrp substrate . the cofillin and _PROTEIN_ used
