calcitonins are amino acid peptide hormones with both peripheral and central actions mediated via specific cell surface receptors which belong to the class ii subfamily of g protein coupled receptors . understanding receptor function particularly in _METHOD_ of ligand recognition by calcitonin receptors may aid in the rational design of calcitonin analogs with increased potency and improved selectivity . to directly identify sites of proximity between calcitonin and its receptor we carried out photoaffinity labeling studies followed by protein digestion and mapping of the radiolabeled photoconjugated receptor . a fully active salmon calcitonin analog _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sct incorporating a photolabile p benzoyl l phenylalanine into position of the ligand has been used to demonstrate spatial proximity between residue of the peptide and the amino terminal _LOCATION_ domain of the receptor . cyanogen bromide cleavage together with endoproteinase asp n digestion indicated that binding was predominantly to the region delimited by receptor residues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . binding to this fragment was supported further by cyanogen bromide digestion of receptors that were mutated to remove the predicted cleavage site at _PROTEIN_ . binding within the amino acid fragment was refined further by digestion with endoproteinase lys c to the amino acid region corresponding to _PROTEIN_ . these results provide the first direct demonstration of a contact domain between salmon calcitonin and its receptor and will contribute toward modeling of the calcitonin receptor interface .
pharmacological characterization of _PROTEIN_ photoactive analog of sct substituted with bpa at position _PROTEIN_ sct was synthesized as a photoaffinity probe of the ctr . evaluation of the interaction of this analog with the ha hctra transiently transfected into _PROTEIN_ cells revealed similar affinity _PROTEIN_ and efficacy to native sct . _PROTEIN_ sct also displayed similar affinity to the unlabeled peptide _PROTEIN_ . therefore this analog was suitable for photoaffinity labeling of the receptor and assessment of sites of proximity between residue of the peptide and the receptor . photoaffinity cross linking of hctra with _PROTEIN_ cross linking of _PROTEIN_ sct to intact _PROTEIN_ cells transiently _PROTEIN_ the ha hctra revealed a single radiolabeled band of mr and this band was shifted to mr after treatment of the ligand receptor complex with endo f to remove n linked _PROTEIN_ on the receptor terminus . these bands are receptor specific because they were not observed in the nontransfected cells and were completely inhibited by coincubation with excess unlabeled sct . the receptor _METHOD_ and level of glycosylation are consistent with the expected _METHOD_ of the receptor and previously characterized level of receptor glycosylation . the cross linked receptor _PROTEIN_ sct conjugate was then subjected to a series of chemical and enzymatic cleavages to identify the site of covalent contact between the ligand and receptor . the photolabeled ha hctra was digested with _PROTEIN_ which cleaves at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of methionine residues followed by resolution on an _PROTEIN_ tricine gel and autoradiography . one specifically labeled band of mr was identified . sequential digestion with endo f followed by _PROTEIN_ did not alter the mobility of the mr fragment . possible candidate receptor fragments for this band included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and given the molecular _METHOD_ of the radiolabeled ligand . immunoprecipitation of the _PROTEIN_ hctra complex after cleavage with _PROTEIN_ did not precipitate a radioactive band indicating that the far terminal end of the receptor was not a site of cross linking . mutation of or to leucine which did not alter either sct binding or cell surface _PROTEIN_ of the receptor did not shift the migration of the lower molecular _METHOD_ band indicating that cross linking did not occur within _LOCATION_ loop . however mutation of _PROTEIN_ to either leucine or alanine completely abolished the generation of the mr band with a higher prominent radiolabeled fragment of mr formed following sequential digestion with endo f and _PROTEIN_ . this band which was consistent with digestion around the _PROTEIN_ site in the wild type receptor was equivalent in size to the two accumulated fragments _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in some experiments of the wild type hctr digestion with _PROTEIN_ was incomplete with weak bands of mr and mr seen in addition to the predominant band of mr . these data suggested incomplete digestion around _PROTEIN_ in these experiments and was consistent with data from and mutants which demonstrated progressive _PROTEIN_ in molecular _METHOD_ of the incomplete digestion products . thus sct cross links to a single _PROTEIN_ derived domain that is delimited by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to define and confirm further the binding domain of the _PROTEIN_ sct the intact photolabeled ha hctra was incubated with the enzyme asp n which digests specifically at the terminal side of aspartic acid residues . asp n cleavage yielded two radiolabeled bands after resolution on _PROTEIN_ tricine gel an mr fragment in addition to a higher molecular _METHOD_ band presumably resulting from incomplete digestion . when treated with endo f the electrophoretic mobility of the mr band shifted to mr demonstrating that it is glycosylated . only two asp n generated domains on hctra contain glycosylation sites . one comprises _PROTEIN_ and is too small compared with the band size . the other region _PROTEIN_ is mr . the predicted _METHOD_ for this fragment plus _PROTEIN_ sct is close to the observed electrophoretic mobility of the smallest fragment . furthermore this receptor segment is consistent with that identified from analysis of _PROTEIN_ cleavage supporting cross linking of _PROTEIN_ sct to within _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of the receptor . additional refinement of the interacting site was achieved via digestion of the ligand receptor complex with the endoproteinase lys c which cleaves at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of lysine residues . digestion of the _PROTEIN_ hctra complex with endo lys c yielded an mr fragment in addition to a higher molecular _METHOD_ band resulting from incomplete digestion . when treated with endo f the electrophoretic mobility of the mr band shifted to mr demonstrating that it is glycosylated . only two endo lys c generated domains on ha hctra contain glycosylation sites which contains one glycosylation site and which contains two glycosylation sites suggesting that the latter fragment is the probable site of cross linking . taken together with the _PROTEIN_ data the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ sct cross links specifically to a site contained within the small receptor region delimited by residues _PROTEIN_ and of hctra . in an attempt to identify individual receptor amino acids involved in the cross linking this small region of the receptor was subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis . wild type and mutant receptors were transiently transfected into _PROTEIN_ cells and assessed for cell surface _PROTEIN_ binding affinity and functional response . with one exception all mutants were fully _PROTEIN_ at the cell surface and displayed equivalent affinity for sct in sct competition binding studies . likewise there was little change in either or emax values for sct mediated accumulation of camp . the exception to this was the mutant which was very poorly _PROTEIN_ at the cell surface and essentially did not bind or respond to sct . cysteine is one of highly conserved cysteine residues in the terminus of class ii g protein coupled receptors . studies with other class ii receptors have demonstrated that each of these cysteines _METHOD_ a disulfide bond that is believed to _PROTEIN_ the topology required for ligand binding and for the receptor to be properly folded and _PROTEIN_ at the cell surface . thus lack of functionality of this mutant is not surprising . the data with the other mutants demonstrate that conversion to alanine did not functionally affect ligand receptor interaction . photoaffinity cross linking of _PROTEIN_ sct to each of the mutated receptors transiently _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ cells gave rise to a band of mr and subsequent digestion with _PROTEIN_ resulted in a predominant band of mr . these radiolabeled fragments were not markedly different from the wild type receptor indicating that substitution of individual amino acids with alanine was not sufficient to alter the efficiency of cross linking .
