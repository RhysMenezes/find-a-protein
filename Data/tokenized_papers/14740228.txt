we studied the fine structural organization of _LOCATION_ bodies in the root meristem during germination of maize and arabidopsis thaliana using electron microscopy . cajal bodies were observed in quiescent embryos and germinating cells in both species . the number and distribution of cbs were investigated . to characterize the _LOCATION_ splicing domains _METHOD_ labelling with antibodies against splicing _PROTEIN_ and in situ hybridisation were performed combined with confocal microscopy . antibodies specific to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ splicing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were produced . _PROTEIN_ was detected in quiescent _LOCATION_ and in germinating cells . this study revealed an unexpected speckled _LOCATION_ organization of _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cells where micro clusters of interchromatin granules were also observed by em . therefore we examined the distribution of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in living cells after agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited a speckled distribution in leaf cells . treatments with amanitin okadaic acid staurosporine or heat shock induced the speckles to reorganize . furthermore we generated stable arabidopsis transgenics _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the distribution of the fusion protein was identical to that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . three dimensional time lapse confocal microscopy showed that speckles were highly dynamic domains over time .
the ultrastructure of maize and arabidopsis root _LOCATION_ has been observed at different time points during germination and early seedling development . comparison of _LOCATION_ architecture did not reveal gross structural differences between maize and arabidopsis . several aspects of _LOCATION_ ultrastructural changes during germination of maize and sinapis alba have previously been described in detail except for the _LOCATION_ bodies on which we focused our present observations . at each germination time _LOCATION_ bodies were observed in both species . cajal bodies exhibited a fibrillar texture and were localized either inside a slight depression on the surface of the nucleolus or free in the nucleoplasm referred to respectively as nucleolus associated cbs and free cbs . up to h of germination cbs appeared _PROTEIN_ associated with the nucleolus while after this period they were most often free within the nucleoplasm . both their morphology and localization appeared identical between species . in maize dbs were easily distinguishable from cbs by their structure and smaller diameter . they were very rare in quiescent _LOCATION_ but their number progressively increased during germination with the resumption of _LOCATION_ activity . most often they have been observed free in the nucleoplasm but were sometimes observed in close association with the nucleolus . they displayed a dense fibrillar structure forming a compact spherical body sometimes showing a crown of dense material . although often seen as single these bodies were occasionally seen in groups of two or three . no dense bodies were observed in arabidopsis as confirmed by our reconstruction of _LOCATION_ . their absence in arabidopsis at any germination time could suggest species specific functions . further studies will be needed to identify specific molecules located in dbs and to gain insight into their possible role in _LOCATION_ processes . the ribonucleoprotein nature of cbs and dbs was strongly suggested by the persistence of their contrast after an edta regressive staining technique that revealed ribonucleoprotein material around bleached chromatin clumps and individual or small groups of granules in the interchromatin region . _LOCATION_ body numbers were analysed in maize meristematic cortical cells of the primary root during germination using em . no important fluctuation of total cbs per _LOCATION_ was observed during the first h. however discrimination between fcbs and ncbs showed a slight increase and _PROTEIN_ respectively in their number . these variations were further accentuated after this germination time . interestingly the significant _PROTEIN_ of cb frequency was the direct consequence of the _PROTEIN_ in ncb frequency while the fcb frequency significantly increased . the frequency of dbs increased by fold during the first h of germination . the results of the statistical analysis are shown in fig . . as protein is a good marker of cbs in plants its distribution was analysed by immunocytochemistry on both maize and arabidopsis root meristematic cells by confocal microscopy . the labelling appeared very similar if not identical and fig . shows only the results of staining in maize _LOCATION_ due to space limitation . in quiescent cells localized as weak punctate nucleoplasmic labelling and a confocal z series through _LOCATION_ showed that cbs observed by em were not labelled . at h interestingly showed a heterogeneous nucleoplasmic distribution and became highly enriched in pre existing cbs in both species as confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy . this latter technique also showed a weak density of particles in the nucleoplasm and no labelling over the nucleolus cytoplasm or dbs . _PROTEIN_ was dispersed more homogeneously throughout the nucleoplasm and concentrated in at least one _METHOD_ spot per _LOCATION_ . the foci associated with the nucleolus were generally larger than the free ones . the distribution of snrnas observed using anti snrna antibodies was similar to the protein distribution in both species . one slight difference was a labelling of the cbs in quiescent _LOCATION_ . snrnas being among the best characterized plant splicing _PROTEIN_ genes encoding and have been cloned and in situ hybridization was performed with anti sense rna probes during germination . again and probes showed similar distribution patterns in both maize and arabidopsis . and could be detected in quiescent _LOCATION_ as shown in fig . . in active cells the strongest _LOCATION_ signal was localized as bright small foci for and a more homogeneous bright interchromatin network for . no labelling of _LOCATION_ bodies was observed in quiescent and active _LOCATION_ . in different controls for immunocytochemical protocols and in situ hybridization no labelling was seen over _LOCATION_ . to investigate the subcellular distribution of a plant _PROTEIN_ splicing _PROTEIN_ rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against _PROTEIN_ which is characterized by the presence of one n terminal rrm and a c terminal rs domain . the specificity of the affinity purified antibodies was tested by immunoblot analysis on a protein extract from e. coli and from arabidopsis plants . it showed that immune rabbit serum raised against recombinant _PROTEIN_ specifically recognized his _PROTEIN_ in the crude extract of e. coli . with the protein extract from arabidopsis plants this antibody stained a single band at kda corresponding to the expected molecular _METHOD_ of full length _PROTEIN_ . the pre immune serum from the same rabbits gave no signal . thus our polyclonal antibody is highly specific to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using these antibodies in _METHOD_ confocal microscopy we analysed the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ in meristematic cortical root cells during the early germination of a. thaliana . _PROTEIN_ was detected as punctate foci in quiescent _LOCATION_ . with the onset of _LOCATION_ reactivation as early as h after seed imbibition the foci organization of _PROTEIN_ became less apparent and a more homogeneous distribution was observed in cortical cells of the root meristem . however a speckled distribution of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the nucleoplasm of trichoblasts and atrichoblasts in the elongation and differentiation zones . our anti _PROTEIN_ sera were tested on maize embryos but no labelling was detected showing the high specificity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the overall modifications in the distribution of splicing _PROTEIN_ during early germination suggest that the splicing process could slowly and/or sequentially resume . in order to verify such a possible sequential resumption we looked for intron containing genes in databases that could be _PROTEIN_ as early as seed imbibition and determined their transcript profile during early germination . we performed rt pcr analysis with terminal cdna primers of actin hat and cyclin on total rna extracted from maize root tips . as shown in fig . pcr of actin yielded two bands corresponding to the sizes of the unspliced pre mrna and spliced mrna pcr of cyclin and hat yielded single bands of kb and kb respectively corresponding to the sizes of spliced mrnas . rt pcr was carried out on different maize varieties and the only difference was the pcr products for hat and actin appearing as single bands of correctly spliced mrnas in quiescent embryos . the observation that unspliced pre mrnas and spliced mrnas coexist in quiescent embryos suggests that transcription and splicing could be dissociable processes in some physiological situations . the experiments described so far examined the spatial localization of splicing _PROTEIN_ by imunocytochemistry on fixed tissues which did not assess the dynamics of any _PROTEIN_ . to examine further the subcellular localization and dynamics of _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells we generated a translational fusion construct of this splicing _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ linked to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . first we used transient _PROTEIN_ to develop a rapid and efficient assay for the in vivo spatial organization of plant _PROTEIN_ splicing _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was observed in arabidopsis and tobacco leaf cells after agroinfiltration based transient _PROTEIN_ . we ensured that agroinfiltration and subsequent _METHOD_ analysis did not induce cell death or necrosis . moreover we did not observe any toxic effects of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transiently overexpressing cells . the agrobacterium inoculation only induced weak chlorosis in tobacco which facilitated the identification of the transiently _PROTEIN_ cells . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ could be easily detected by epi _METHOD_ using an fitc filter block . many cells were observed to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ proteins as early as h after infiltration . the _PROTEIN_ level reached an optimum after h and the _METHOD_ was very stable and could still be detected for at least days in both species although the efficiency of the method was always higher in tobacco . as previously visualized using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies and indirect _METHOD_ the speckled pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly apparent in both tobacco and arabidopsis leaf cells . to our knowledge this is the first report of the efficient transient transformation of arabidopsis leaves after agrobacterium inoculation . the spatial distribution of free _METHOD_ was observed by _PROTEIN_ a binary vector containing only the _METHOD_ gene downstream of the promoter . as expected from published data _PROTEIN_ of free _METHOD_ produced high and homogeneous _METHOD_ in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ due to passive diffusion through _LOCATION_ pores . no speckled accumulation of _METHOD_ in either cytoplasm or _LOCATION_ was observed . confocal z series of tobacco and arabidopsis _LOCATION_ clearly demonstrated a speckled _METHOD_ organization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the entire _LOCATION_ depth . the analysis of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at different time points after agroinfiltration showed that _LOCATION_ speckles appeared as early as _METHOD_ could be detected suggesting that subnuclear distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is relatively independent of its overexpression and overaccumulation . inhibition of rna polymerase ii transcription by amanitin caused the disappearance of the diffuse fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and its redistribution into larger _LOCATION_ domains . the use of okadaic acid and staurosporine on transformed leaves provoked a similar disappearance of the diffuse _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and its concentration into bigger speckles and around the nucleolus . heat shock treatment known to disrupt spliceosomal components led to accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ around the nucleolus as well . since a speckled organization of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ splicing _PROTEIN_ occurred after our transient _PROTEIN_ experiments we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct allowing us to compare different cell types and developmental stages . similar results were obtained with many independent lines . a low magnification _METHOD_ analysis showed a clear _LOCATION_ localization of the fusion protein in the whole seedling root . as already reported _LOCATION_ within root hair cells were observed to have a complex non spherical shape . in meristematic cells uniform _METHOD_ was observed with no apparent accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in foci . the most impressive speckled distribution of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ could be observed in epidermal cells similar to what we observed using antibodies . interestingly the analysis of transgenics and of transient transformation demonstrated that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in its accumulation in speckles in a particular cell or tissue type . we next sought to observe whether overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in cbs . immunostaining in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells displayed a diffuse distribution with additional bright cbs . the nucleoplasmic diffuse labelling of and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized but protein did not accumulate in the speckles . next we legitimately wondered whether the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of promoter could modify the organization of _LOCATION_ . in other words could overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ induce the development/formation of igcs in plant cells ? high resolution _LOCATION_ organization of arabidopsis transgenics was investigated by em and compared with that of wild type seedlings . observations were made in both meristematic and differentiation zones of the root . no gross changes in overall _LOCATION_ ultrastructure were observed between transgenics and wild type either in meristematic cells or in the differentiation zone . although smaller than in mammalian cells micro clusters of igs were nevertheless observed in trichoblasts . since the dynamic properties of speckles in plant cells are largely unknown high resolution time lapse imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in and seedlings was performed . four dimensional analysis of meristematic _LOCATION_ did not show any modification in the _METHOD_ pattern over a long period . however in atrichoblasts the stereo images presented in fig . show complex movement and shape modification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over a long period . although the _LOCATION_ speckles of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remain in relatively stable spatial domains during a time lapse analysis of more than min their periphery could display a likely non random budding and fusing . rapid movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also visible at the periphery of the speckles . unfortunately four dimensional analysis of root hair _LOCATION_ was difficult to perform because of the rapid and constant movements of _LOCATION_ along the cells during laser scanning .
