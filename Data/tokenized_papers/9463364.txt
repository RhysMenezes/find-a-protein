dynamin a _PROTEIN_ protein found in rat brain plays a role in endocytosis . suborganellar fractionation studies of arabidopsis leaf tissue revealed that a protein _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . this notion was supported further by in vivo targeting experiments using an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and immunogold labeling with the antibody . transgenic plants harboring various deletion mutant genes of _PROTEIN_ had a yellow leaf phenotype where the cells had very few chloroplasts . in addition the remaining chloroplasts appeared morphologically not fully developed . the detailed structure of the chloroplasts revealed by electron microscopy showed a greatly reduced amount of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . also the level of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as the complex ii and _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced in these transgenic plants . when we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ deletion mutant genes these genes were highly _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional level . however the mutant _PROTEIN_ were not detectable at the protein level by western blot analysis . moreover the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein level was greatly reduced in these transgenic plants probably due to a silencing effect of the transgenes . we propose therefore that adll is involved in the biogenesis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
in order to study intracellular trafficking in plants we first attempted to isolate a cdna encoding a dynamin homolog from arabidopsis . degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved _PROTEIN_ motif were used as probes for library screening . the cdna clone _PROTEIN_ isolated from an arabidopsis leaf cdna library had exactly the same sequence as the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna . using this cdna we investigated the biological role of the encoded protein _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . we first employed western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised against the region of _PROTEIN_ . the western blot analysis of cell extracts from leaf root flower and silique tissue showed that _PROTEIN_ was present in all tissues examined . this result is in a good agreement with the northern data of citation which showed that the _PROTEIN_ gene was transcribed at high levels in leaf root flower and silique tissue . to characterize the protein further we then examined the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in leaf tissue by western blot analysis . the leaf tissue was homogenized gently and fractionated on a percoll gradient . the top fraction of the percoll gradient was fractionated further into supernatant and pellet fractions by ultracentrifugation . as shown in fig ref the majority of _PROTEIN_ was with the chloroplasts . only a minor portion was present in the top fraction of the percoll gradient . when the top fraction was fractionated again by ultracentrifugation _PROTEIN_ stayed with the _LOCATION_ in the pellet fraction . however upon longer exposure a weak band appeared consistently in the supernatant of the ultracentrifugation step indicating that a very small amount of _PROTEIN_ may be present in a soluble form . since the chloroplast is composed of multiple suborganelles we pursued the question of the localization of _PROTEIN_ within the chloroplast even further . the intact chloroplasts were lysed and subsequently fractionated into supernatant and pellet by low speed centrifugation . after this fractionation the pellet contains _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the supernatant contains chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ as well as soluble stromal proteins . the proteins in the supernatant and pellet were separated by _PROTEIN_ and probed with the antibody . as shown in fig ref the majority of _PROTEIN_ was present in the pellet containing the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and only a minor portion remained in the supernatant . when the supernatant was fractionated further into a soluble and a pellet fraction by ultracentrifugation most of the _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ in the pellet fraction indicating that the small amount of _PROTEIN_ in the supernatant of the low speed centrifugation is very likely attached to the _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . as a control for the suborganellar fractionation of the chloroplast an identical blot was probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ a subunit of the chloroplast protein import complex localized on the outer _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast . the antibody recognized a protein species in the supernatant as expected . thus the control experiment _METHOD_ that there is very little if any contamination of chloroplast _LOCATION_ in the _LOCATION_ fraction . these results clearly establish that the majority of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts is present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ although a minor portion may be present in the _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . in order to understand better the association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we treated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction with high salt or high ph and subsequently precipitated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by low speed centrifugation . the amount of _PROTEIN_ remaining in the pellet was then examined by western blot analysis . as shown in fig ref a large portion of _PROTEIN_ was washed away at high ph indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein . in another experiment the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was digested with thermolysin in the presence or absence of triton and then examined for the presence of _PROTEIN_ by western blot analysis . as shown in fig ref _PROTEIN_ was digested away under both conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is most likely located on the side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as an alternative approach to show the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplasts we employed an in vivo targeting experiment using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagging on _PROTEIN_ . we generated a fusion protein between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we also fused the transit peptide of the chlorophyll protein to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in order to use it as a control protein for chloroplast targeting . dna constructs encoding the two fusion proteins and _METHOD_ were introduced into soybean suspension culture cells by the particle bombardment method . _PROTEIN_ of the introduced genes was examined under a _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in fig ref the majority of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was targeted to the chloroplast as indicated by the green _METHOD_ staining of the chloroplasts . the staining pattern was nearly identical to that of _METHOD_ . in contrast to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ remained in the _LOCATION_ as expected . in addition there was a weak staining at the boundary of the cells transformed with the _METHOD_ fusion gene suggesting that a minor portion of _METHOD_ might be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to obtain direct evidence for the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we employed the immunogold labeling method using the polyclonal antibody . leaf tissue was fixed and processed for immunogold labeling . as shown in fig ref the immunogold label concentrated in the chloroplasts . the majority of the label was located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with only minor labeling of the _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . thus the results of the immunogold labeling experiment are in agreement with those of the western blot analysis described in fig ref . to gain insight into the biological role of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplasts we decided to generate mutants by _PROTEIN_ mutant _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ cdna in transgenic plants . the deletion mutant genes shown in fig ref were constructed and transgenic plants were generated by the transformation method . the deletion constructs were under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to obtain strong _PROTEIN_ in leaf tissue . the generation of the transformants was rescreened for kanamycin resistance . we then examined the transgenic plants visually for phenotypic changes . as shown in fig ref one obvious phenotypic effect was manifested in the yellow leaves of the transgenic plants . the yellow leaf phenotype was reproducible in the generation . the transgenic plants retained the phenotype when grown in soil but at a somewhat reduced frequency . this phenotype was observed in many independent lines of transgenic plants derived from the same deletion mutant gene and from different deletion mutant genes albeit that it differed in frequency and severity as shown in table i . the results strongly suggest that the yellow leaf phenotype is caused by the introduction of the mutant gene . the variation in the frequency of the phenotype between the transgenic lines and between the plants with various deletion mutant genes is probably due to the randomness in their integration into the genome . in search for the mechanism underlying the yellow leaf phenotype we further characterized the transgenic plants . first we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the introduced deletion mutant genes by northern blot analysis using total rna obtained from the respective transgenic plants . the transgenic plants showed a high level of _PROTEIN_ of the deletion mutant genes as expected . a typical result of northern blot analysis is shown in fig ref . we also carried out western blot analysis to measure the accumulation of the truncated proteins encoded by the deletion mutant genes . surprisingly we found no accumulation of any truncated form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of which deletion mutant gene had been introduced . an example of western blot analysis is shown in fig ref . in order to rule out the possibility that a frameshift mutation occurred during the construction of the deletion mutant genes we translated the deletion constructs in vitro using wheat germ extract and examined the translation products by western blot analysis with the antibody . we observed that the deletion constructs not only yielded the expected truncated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ but also that the in vitro translated products were recognized by the antibody . in contrast to the absence of accumulated truncated _PROTEIN_ the transgenic plants showed various levels of endogenous _PROTEIN_ ranging from the control level to > reduced levels . the western blot results thus stand in contrast to the northern blot results . a possible explanation for this may be a silencing effect by the introduced deletion mutant gene on the endogenous gene in the transgenic plants in spite of our initial attempt to create a effect when introducing the deletion mutant genes . it has been shown before that gene silencing can occur either at the transcriptional level or at the level . to address the phenotypic changes at the cellular level sections of leaf tissue were examined under a microscope . in the leaves of the transgenic plants the overall size of individual cells was slightly enlarged while the number of cells was reduced . however the most prominent changes in the transgenic plants occurred in the number and the morphology of the chloroplasts . the cells in the leaf tissue contained almost no or only very few chloroplasts . furthermore the remaining chloroplasts in the transgenic plants appeared to be not fully developed . we examined these chloroplasts with an electron microscope . as shown in fig ref and fig ref they show a marked reduction in the amount of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ without grana stacks . instead the chloroplasts in the leaf cells of the transgenic plants had more lipid granules _LOCATION_ and were filled with small particulates . usually the chloroplasts of a mature leaf cell exhibit _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that are organized into grana stacks at a high density as shown in fig ref and fig ref . we also addressed the changes in the level of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ polypeptides in the transgenic plants . total cell protein was extracted from transgenic plants harboring and the deletion mutant genes and probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against maize proteins _PROTEIN_ and the complex ii . as shown in fig ref the amount of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and the lhcii complex was greatly reduced in the transgenic plants harboring the deletion mutant genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as compared with the control transgenic plants when equal amount of total protein was separated by _PROTEIN_ . the level of these polypeptides correlated well with that of _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants . therefore our results strongly suggest that the cells in the leaf tissue of transgenic plants are defective with _PROTEIN_ to the accumulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in their chloroplasts . in addition there were other changes such as a reduction in the volume of the _LOCATION_ as well as in the number of mitochondria however it is not clear whether these changes were the direct effect of the reduced _PROTEIN_ level or the indirect consequence of poor chloroplast development .
to prepare a specific antibody the region containing amino acid residues _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e.coli using prset b . the construct was then transformed into plyss cells and the encoded protein was induced according to the manufacturer s protocol . since most of the _PROTEIN_ protein was found in the inclusion body fraction the protein was purified by ni affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions following the manufacturer s instructions . the protein was purified further by _PROTEIN_ and injected into a rabbit to raise antibody . the antibody was using the purified _PROTEIN_ protein . total rna was prepared from transgenic plants and used for northern blot analysis using the _PROTEIN_ cdna as a hybridization probe . plants were grown on _METHOD_ plates at for weeks . homogenates were prepared and separated into top broken chloroplast and intact chloroplast fractions on a percoll step gradient . the intact chloroplasts were lysed and fractionated further into a supernatant and a pellet fraction . to investigate the nature of the _PROTEIN_ association with the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ fraction was treated with m nacl or m on ice for min and then centrifuged at g for min . the pellet was resuspended to the original volume in mm ph and mm edta and analyzed via western blot analysis . for protease treatment of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ fraction was treated with thermolysin in the presence or absence of triton at room temperature for min . western blot analysis was carried out according to a published protocol using the antibody as the primary antibody and the horseradish igg antibody as the secondary antibody . blots were developed using the ecl detection system for western blots . the termination codon of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was removed after pcr using two pcr primers adl and the primer of pbluescript . the resulting molecule was fused to _METHOD_ . to construct the _METHOD_ fusion gene a dna fragment of the cab cdna containing the first amino acid residues was ligated to the _METHOD_ coding region . the fusion constructs were introduced into soybean suspension culture cells by the particle bombardment method . the deletion mutant genes were generated utilizing various restriction sites within the _PROTEIN_ cdna . the _PROTEIN_ construct had a deletion from the site to the xmai site the _PROTEIN_ construct from smai to sal the _PROTEIN_ construct from the xbai site to the bamhi site the _PROTEIN_ from the second codon to smai and the construct _PROTEIN_ from to the . the deletion mutant genes were introduced into transgenic plants using the transformation method . leaves from and transgenic plants were processed for transmission electron microscopy as described previously . sections were made stained with uranium and lead and examined by electron microscopy as described previously . grids containing sections were blocked with bovine serum albumin in saline reacted with the antibody at a dilution of or in tbs and washed in tbs . they were then reacted with nm goat igg and washed with tbs and distilled water . sections were with standard solutions of uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a hitachi electron microscope .
