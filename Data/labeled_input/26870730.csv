_PROTEIN_ shows stele side polar localization in the _LOCATION_ of various root cells presumably to support b translocation toward the stele .,Y
quantification of fluorescence intensities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in the _LOCATION_ after shifting to boric acid for h. means sd are shown .,Y
it is likely that the stable accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ prevented b accumulation in the sensitive cytosol by b exclusion to the leaf apoplast thereby supporting the growth of shoots under excess b conditions .,Y
we then observed gfp fluorescence in roots and shoots under an epifluorescence microscope and selected and plants expressing _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively with relatively strong gfp fluorescence intensities .,Y
plasmid construction fragments of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and hpt nost were amplified by pcr using a plasmid containing gfp and respectively as templates .,Y
these results suggest that _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ was internalized into _LOCATION_ from the _BLANKL_ under high b conditions dependent on similar to the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y

these results demonstrate that _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localize on the _LOCATION_ with weak polarity in epidermal cells .,Y

in contrast to the weak polar localization in other cell types _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was exclusively localized on the _LOCATION_ of the stele side domain in the mature endodermis as was shown for _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
in contrast to the weak polar localization in other cell types _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ was exclusively localized on the _LOCATION_ of the stele side domain in the mature endodermis as was shown for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
gfp hpt was detectable weakly in root tips and scarcely in leaf epidermis under this excess b condition while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was stably accumulated on the _LOCATION_ in root cells and leaf epidermal cells .,Y
