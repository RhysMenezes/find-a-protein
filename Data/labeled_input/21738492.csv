confocal fluorescence microscopy of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization for confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ the roots or leaves of six day old seedling grown on ms plates were first stained with propidium iodide for min and then washed in ddh o for at least three times .,Y
figure _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ .,Y
a construct expressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was included as the control . as shown in figure in both wild type and protoplasts _BLANKP_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of transgenic plants expressing the _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion protein showed that the gfp signal is found exclusively in the _BLANKL_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein .,Y
the kb fragment described above was cloned into a modified vector expressing c terminal tagged gfp to obtain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of transgenic plants expressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein showed that the gfp signal is found exclusively in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _BLANKP_ is a _BLANKL_ protein .,Y
