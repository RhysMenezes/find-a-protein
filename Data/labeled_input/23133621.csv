_METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter was localised in the _LOCATION_ and the cell periphery of nicotiana tabacum leaf explants .,Y
immunofluorescence microscopy of arabidopsis thaliana root tips verified its _LOCATION_ localization and membrane association and showed _PROTEIN_ localization in the elongation zone which was expanded to the meristematic zone in plants grown on high salt media .,Y
fluorescence and confocal microscopy localization studies of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ as well as immunofluorescence microscopy were performed using fluorescence and confocal microscopy .,Y
_METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter was localised in the _BLANKL_ and the cell periphery of nicotiana tabacum leaf explants . immunofluorescence microscopy of arabidopsis thaliana root tips verified its _LOCATION_ localization and membrane association and showed _BLANKP_ localization in the elongation zone which was expanded to the meristematic zone in plants grown on high salt media .,N
