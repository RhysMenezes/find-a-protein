at least eight predictors in predict a mitochondrial location for _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ and _BLANKP_ and indeed we found these five proteases are targeted to the _LOCATION_ by our _BLANKM_ tagging approach . surprisingly a fluorescence signal was also detected in the _BLANKL_ when _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs were used to transform arabidopsis suspension cells suggesting that _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ are dual targeted to the _BLANKL_ and to the _BLANKL_ .,N
