the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transiently expressed in the protoplasts by polyethylene glycerol mediated transformation as described .,Y
_METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the _LOCATION_ and promoter gus analysis showed that is expressed in the stele of roots and veins of leaves and flowers .,Y
confocal imaging of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion protein indicated that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
for constructing the promoter controlled _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ construct the full length of _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by high fidelity kod polymerase the pcr fragment was cut with xho i and eco ri and inserted into the same sites of _METHOD_ vector .,Y
to investigate the cellular localization of we made a pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and transfected the isolated arabidopsis protoplasts .,Y
