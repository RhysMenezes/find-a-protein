immunolocalization arabidopsis seeds expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the native promoter and seeds were bleach sterilized for min washed in water and sown onto half strength ms agar plates .,Y
plant material and construct generation the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and construct have been described previously .,Y
as our previous results showed localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ another candidate sequence investigated for association with was ribosomal dna .,Y
the trbpro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was prepared as follows genomic dna from a. thaliana col was isolated using a dneasy plant mini kit and used as a template for pcr to amplify the genomic sequence including,Y
the selected plant line does not show gfp labelling in all cells so some _LOCATION_ contain a wild type level of _PROTEIN_ and others show higher expression due to _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
nicotiana benthamiana transformation nuclei isolation and fish leaves of week old n. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with agrobacterium tumefaciens containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and as described by voinnet et al .,Y
as our previous results showed localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in the _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ another candidate sequence investigated for association with was ribosomal dna .,Y
we tested both antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence on mutant and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ expressing plants . these experiments showed evenly distributed _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ signals for both and antibodies .,Y
co localization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and telomeric pna probe is detectable in most of the foci .,Y
we tested both antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence on mutant and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ expressing plants . these experiments showed evenly distributed _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ signals for both and antibodies .,Y
the selected plant line does not show gfp labelling in all cells so some _LOCATION_ contain a wild type level of _BLANKP_ and others show higher expression due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
these results provide in situ evidence of _LOCATION_ occupancy by _PROTEIN_ .,Y
results co localizes with telomeres although a possible association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the telomere was suggested previously whether the _LOCATION_ are directly associated with telomeres remained to be determined .,Y
the selected plant line does not show gfp labelling in all cells so some _LOCATION_ contain a wild type level of _PROTEIN_ and others show higher expression due to _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ .,N
