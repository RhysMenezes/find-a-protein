using a fully functional fluorescent version of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ we show that this protein is localized at the _LOCATION_ as well as in _BLANKL_ and soluble in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
results functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is mainly localized at the _LOCATION_ we generated an fusion between the predicted _BLANKP_ signal peptide fused to the yellow fluorescent protein monomeric _BLANKM_ followed by the coding region including the predicted,Y
a similar dual _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ localization was displayed by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ while the integral membrane protein was exclusively membrane localized .,Y
figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized both at the _LOCATION_ and in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
