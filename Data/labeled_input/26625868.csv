transgenic plants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was functional .,Y
to generate _METHOD_ tagged construct for subcellular localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ the orf of _BLANKP_ was amplified and cloned in frame with a c terminal _BLANKM_ tag into the the construct obtained was then digested with proper enzymes and subcloned into the binary vector for plant transformation .,Y
by examining gfp florescence in the root of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plant seedlings obtained we found that _BLANKP_ is predominantly localized in the _LOCATION_ .,Y

florescence observation of transgenic plants expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that _BLANKP_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ and transient expression of in protoplasts inhibited reporter gene expression .,Y
