identified so far are nuclear proteins and _PROTEIN_ was shown to be mainly _LOCATION_ localized .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized only in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _BLANKP_ is a _BLANKL_ restricted gras protein .,Y
the _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ was localized only in the _BLANKL_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ restricted gras protein .,Y
these results provide good evidence that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _BLANKP_ in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells .,Y
_PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal _METHOD_ fragment .,Y
for generating the _PROTEIN_ n _METHOD_ fusion construct the bp and bp coding sequences of were amplified using two pairs of primers scl and scl digested with sac i/ bam hi and bam hi/ xba i respectively and sequentially cloned into the same sites of pfgc n yfp .,Y
the open reading frame was amplified by pcr and subcloned into the ecor i sac ii sites of the plasmid smrs gfp in frame with the n terminus of smrs gfp generating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
these results provide good evidence that _BLANKP_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized only in the _BLANKL_ indicating that _BLANKP_ is a _LOCATION_ restricted gras protein .,N
the _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ was localized only in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _BLANKL_ restricted gras protein .,N
the _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ was localized only in the _BLANKL_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ restricted gras protein .,N
