an rfp dilysine mutant lacking the gold domain shows a prominent vacuolar labelling but it also co localizes partially in punctae with _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ blue or _BLANKL_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ green markers .,Y
however _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ was not present at the er in contrast to rfp but showed a punctate pattern and it co localized partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both tobacco mesophyll and arabidopsis protoplasts but not with the _BLANKL_ marker _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
rfp deletion mutants lacking the coiled coil domain the gold domain or both co localize partially with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ like punctae upon mutant expression .,Y
the coding sequences of xfp were cloned into the vector through bgl ii/ not i. plasmids encoding marker proteins were rfp and rfp ct ss _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKM_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ gfp and .,Y
a deletion mutant lacking both the gold and the coiled coil domains _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ indicating that the dilysine motif in the cytosolic tail constitutes the minimal requirement for the steady state localization of rfp to the er .,Y
_BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in punctate structures .,Y
it has previously been shown that transiently expressed red fluorescent protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ as a consequence of highly efficient copi based recycling from the golgi apparatus .,Y
motif at the cytoplasmic tail of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization and trafficking in the early secretory pathway or if the luminal gold and coiled coil domains could also play a role has now been investigated .,Y
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in punctate structures .,Y
the ct ss ct ss tmct and tmct ct ss mutants of red fluorescent protein _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ were obtained by deletion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and synthesis of a new sequence .,Y
in contrast they localized to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _BLANKL_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ and the vacuole lumen .,Y
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in punctate structures .,Y
and l this was the only dilysine mutant which was partially localized to the _BLANKL_ showing a partial co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .,Y
the coding sequences of xfp were cloned into the vector through bgl ii/ not i. plasmids encoding marker proteins were rfp and rfp ct ss _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ gfp and .,Y
recombinant plasmid production the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ was commercially synthesized de novo based on the sequence of _METHOD_ and that of the arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ .,Y
in this case rfp deletion mutants still localized to the er but also to golgi like punctae where they co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as was the case for rfp .,Y
it also showed co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and eventually with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but was rarely seen in the vacuole lumen .,Y
the ct ss ct ss tmct and tmct ct ss mutants of red fluorescent protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained by deletion of _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ and synthesis of a new sequence .,Y

an increased ratio in the concentrations of gfp versus rfp induced a progressive change in the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from its typical reticulate _LOCATION_ pattern to a mostly punctated one and increased co localization between both proteins .,Y
_BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in punctate structures .,Y
it also showed co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and eventually with _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ but was rarely seen in the vacuole lumen .,Y
however _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ was not present at the er in contrast to rfp but showed a punctate pattern and it co localized partially with the _BLANKL_ marker _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in both tobacco mesophyll and arabidopsis protoplasts but not with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
this suggests that the steady state localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ is not dependent on the gold or the coiled coil domains .,Y
the dilysine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of is sufficient for its trafficking in the early secretory pathway it was previously demonstrated that transiently expressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ shows a uniform signal distribution throughout the _LOCATION_ both in tobacco mesophyll and in arabidopsis protoplasts as well as in cells,Y
