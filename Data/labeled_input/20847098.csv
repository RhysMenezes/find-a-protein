in addition _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the secretory pathway and did not colocalize with mitotracker labelled mitochondria .,Y
plant leaf cells expressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were infiltrated with mitotracker orange cmtmros using a ml syringe and imaged with a water immersion lens .,Y
the lower m r band was identified as _PROTEIN_ from three resulting _METHOD_ peptides .,Y
these results suggest that the polytopic membrane protein _PROTEIN_ is cotranslationally targeted to the _BLANKL_ in plant cells and accumulates in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
these results suggest that the polytopic membrane protein _PROTEIN_ is cotranslationally targeted to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells and accumulates in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
