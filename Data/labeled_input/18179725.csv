in root hairs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also formed a pattern of dots .,Y
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ were therefore co expressed in these leaves and both localized to the same specific spots on the _LOCATION_ .,Y
plasmids in order to fuse the iq tail domain of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ we used a cdna clone kindly provided by dieter volkmann and the following primers fwd ggg gta ccc gta ctc tcc acg gca tt and rev cgg gat ccg tgc ttg gga atg ctg cc .,Y
interestingly when the fluorescent chimera was co expressed with an er marker _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ the punctate labeling pattern of _PROTEIN_ correlated with the _LOCATION_ .,Y
localization of transiently expressed in n. benthamiana when fluorescent chimeras _BLANKM_ or _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ were transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium infiltration fluorescence accumulated as dots on the _LOCATION_ of abaxial leaf epidermal cells .,Y
interestingly when the fluorescent chimera was co expressed with an er marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the punctate labeling pattern of _BLANKP_ correlated with the _LOCATION_ .,Y
the plasmid encoding the gfp fusion of the h/kdel receptor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was provided by chris hawes from oxford brookes university uk .,Y
