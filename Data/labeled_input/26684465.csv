all three fusion proteins were mainly detected in the _LOCATION_ similar as previously shown in transgenic arabidopsis seeds containing _METHOD_ fused with the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment .,Y
confocal microscopy analysis subcellular localisation of each _PROTEIN_ isoform was analysed using binary constructs with single variant cdna from cvi fused to _METHOD_ at their n terminus or c terminus and cloned under the camv promoter .,Y
