furthermore co expression analyses were performed with established marker proteins that label the _BLANKL_ _BLANKP_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKL_ / _BLANKL_ _BLANKP_ respectively,Y
to that end the entire coding sequences of _BLANKP_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ as well as variants thereof were cloned n terminally to the _METHOD_ sequence into the plant expression vector .,Y

lacking the first amino acids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which are strongly conserved between and showed a uniform fluorescence pattern devoid of any vesicular structures . the pattern is similar to that observed with _LOCATION_ protein indicating that the protein is no longer targeted into the endomembrane system .,Y
the spherical pattern observed for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence indicates that the protein is associated with the _LOCATION_ rather than localized inside the vesicle lumen .,Y
labelling of yfp expressing protoplasts with mito tracker red cmxros and co expression analysis with an mcherry tagged marker protein for peroxisomes revealed no overlap in fluorescence also excluding the mitochondria and peroxisomes as the potential target compartments of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ resides in _LOCATION_ structures within the interphase between the golgi and the mvbs/endosomes and circulation dynamics within these endomembrane compartments are the likely cause for the partial co localization .,Y
by contrast a variant comprising only the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed the same spherical pattern as the full length protein . these results strongly indicate that the first amino acids of are both essential and sufficient for targeting of the protein into the _LOCATION_ system .,Y
