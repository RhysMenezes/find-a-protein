to investigate cngc trafficking and localization we have measured and expression in roots and leaves analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions transiently expressed in protoplasts and conducted immunofluorescence labeling of protoplasts and immunoelectron,Y
gfp expression in cells immunoprecipitation and patch clamp assays the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused to _METHOD_ in the hindiii ecori sites of pegfp to create and fused to egfp and the flag epitope in the aflii xhoi sites of t/o to create .,Y
a pcr amplified copy of the nos cassette from binary vector was cloned between the hindiii and saci restriction sites of pbluescript ks and the coding sequence subsequently replaced with either an egfp fragment or a chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragment to generate constructs pbl and pbl respectively .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ sequence directed _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ whereas the gfp alone control was detected uniformly in the cytosol .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was targeted to the _LOCATION_ in leaf protoplasts and lightly labeled several intracellular structures .,Y
these results suggested that the _PROTEIN_ sequence directed the fused _METHOD_ through the secretory pathway to the _LOCATION_ .,Y
as an initial approach for localizing cngcs within the cell we employed transient expression of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion controlled by the camv promoter in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts .,Y
