transient transformation of n. benthamiana plants for sub cellular localization of to generate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the a. thaliana full length cdna clone was ordered at the riken genomic sciences complex .,Y
in addition _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ coding sequence was transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves .,Y

figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is dually targeted to the _LOCATION_ and the _BLANKL_ .,Y
in presence of bfa the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence was strictly restricted to the _LOCATION_ _BLANKL_ hybrid and bfa compartments .,Y
note that under plasmolysis the tagrfp fluorescence in the cell wall is excluded from the pm fluorescence of yfp and that the additional co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence with the chlorophyll auto fluorescence indicates its _LOCATION_ localization .,Y
furthermore transient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over expression in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells resulted in its localization to the _LOCATION_ as expected but surprisingly also to the _BLANKL_ indicating an original dual trafficking for a nsltp .,Y
