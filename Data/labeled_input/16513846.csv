translational fusions with the _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ is not nuclear by default .,Y
however both fusion proteins _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
orfs of _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ were constructed and expressed in leek or onion epidermal cells after particle bombardment .,Y
as controls green fluorescent protein _METHOD_ fusions with _PROTEIN_ and blh partner proteins were created in the vector .,Y
according to bimolecular fluorescence complementation _PROTEIN_ is targeted into the _LOCATION_ compartment through heterodimerization with blh partner proteins which are expressed in distinct sam domains from the center to the periphery .,Y
the _LOCATION_ retention of the chimeric _BLANKM_ _PROTEIN_ protein was further substantiated by confocal laser microscopy scanning and staining of nuclei with propidium iodide .,Y
however both fusion proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ remained in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
however both fusion proteins _BLANKM_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ remained in the _LOCATION_ .,N
however both fusion proteins _METHOD_ _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ _BLANKM_ remained in the _LOCATION_ .,N
the _LOCATION_ retention of the chimeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was further substantiated by confocal laser microscopy scanning and staining of nuclei with propidium iodide .,N
