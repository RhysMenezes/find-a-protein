Input,Output
the expression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was mainly localized in _LOCATION_ .,Y
the construct for subcellular location of was made by in frame fusion of complete _PROTEIN_ cds with the _METHOD_ sequence in which the stop codon of cds was deleted .,Y
transient expression in nicotiana benthamiana and stable expression in arabidopsis of fused with _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was expressed in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
the was amplified using the primer pair of and and fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was amplified using the and and all with appropriate restriction sequences .,Y
plants transformed with a construct carrying the fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that gfp was expressed in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
and plants were maintained in growth chambers for investigating the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transient gene expression experiments .,Y
both transient and stable expression studies indicated that the location of _PROTEIN_ is mainly in the cell _LOCATION_ .,Y
plants transformed with a construct carrying the fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that gfp was expressed in the _BLANKL_ . both transient and stable expression studies indicated that the location of _BLANKP_ is mainly in the cell _LOCATION_ .,N
plants transformed with a construct carrying the fusion _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ showed that gfp was expressed in the _LOCATION_ . both transient and stable expression studies indicated that the location of _PROTEIN_ is mainly in the cell _BLANKL_ .,N
plants transformed with a construct carrying the fusion _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ showed that gfp was expressed in the _BLANKL_ . both transient and stable expression studies indicated that the location of _PROTEIN_ is mainly in the cell _LOCATION_ .,N
