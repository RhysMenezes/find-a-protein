during all the early stages of flower bud development the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein seemed to be primarily localised in the _LOCATION_ but a substantial part of the signal was also localised in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
this _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the second and third whorl could be due to higher expression levels of the gene resulting in a temporary accumulation of gfp proteins in the cytoplasm waiting for transportation to the nucleus .,Y
