as reported previously _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was dynamically distributed to the apical _LOCATION_ in the,Y
quantification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in the _LOCATION_ v.s .,Y
as expected bp treatment resulted in gradual relocalization of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _BLANKL_ of root hairs,Y
as expected bp treatment resulted in gradual relocalization of _PROTEIN_ from the _BLANKL_ to the _LOCATION_ of root hairs,Y
quantification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in the _BLANKL_ v.s . the _LOCATION_ at different time points after bp treatment .,Y
pro _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was generated by a lr reaction using the pro gfp gw destination vector and the entry vector for .,Y
as an additional control we also introduced the same pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene into by crosses in which _BLANKP_ was rendered _LOCATION_ .,Y
as an additional control we also introduced the same pro _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ transgene into by crosses in which _PROTEIN_ was rendered _LOCATION_ .,Y
as an additional control we also introduced the same pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene into by crosses in which _BLANKP_ was rendered _BLANKL_ . as expected bp treatment resulted in gradual relocalization of _BLANKP_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _BLANKL_ of root hairs,N
