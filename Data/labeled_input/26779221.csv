of arabidopsis thaliana seedlings expressing end binding protein _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ under control of native promoter .,Y
subcellular resolution of the light sheet microscopy was documented during mitotic cell division of root cells in the meristematic zone where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocated from stage _BLANKL_ to _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ during the respective cell division stages and finally was redistributed back to reconstituted stage nuclei after completing cell division .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in _LOCATION_ of all non dividing root cells within the root apex with particularly strong expression level in cells of the root meristematic zone .,Y
the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was previously mentioned solely in meristematic cells but not further addressed .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocated from stage _LOCATION_ to spindle in prophase metaphase and anaphase to _BLANKL_ at early and late telophase and redistributed back to reconstructed stage nuclei after cell division .,Y
in all imaged tissues light sheet microscopy revealed clearly _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root cells .,Y
with the help of advanced light sheet microscopy we report quantitative evaluations of developmentally regulated _LOCATION_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ protein tagged with _METHOD_ relatively to the nuclear size in diverse root tissues and root developmental zones .,Y
