localization of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ we also produced transgenic plants expressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the native gnom promoter .,Y
the genomic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was produced by pcr based site directed mutagenesis .,Y
the cdna encoding _METHOD_ was inserted in frame immediately preceding the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene coding sequence .,Y
localization of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in the fwr mutant roots gnom is known to regulate the recycling of an auxin efflux carrier thereby affecting the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ at the basal _LOCATION_ which is important for several auxin dependent growth,Y
interestingly the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence was mainly observed at the _LOCATION_ which is different from that of gnom gfp .,Y
crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line into the fwr mutant and observed _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fluorescence in the fwr roots .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seeds were kindly provided by friml .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized at the _LOCATION_ of the root stele cells in fwr as observed in the wild type .,Y
