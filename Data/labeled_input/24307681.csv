the pcr fragment was digested with cla i/ bam hi and then ligated into the premade vector containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coding sequence described previously to replace the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter .,Y
results is required for the membrane recruitment of a number of exocyst subunits when transiently expressed in arabidopsis protoplasts both green fluorescent protein _METHOD_ and red fluorescent protein _BLANKM_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ localize as discrete punctae at the _LOCATION_ and in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
for the promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the promoter sequence was amplified as previously described by using the primer set listed in supplemental table .,Y
of these _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ gave rise to punctate signals in addition to a diffuse _LOCATION_ background .,Y
whether singly expressed or coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts a number of other exocyst proteins give rise to only _LOCATION_ patterns .,Y
