_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is integrated in the _LOCATION_ the presence of the chimera in the intracellular protein fraction including the endomembrane system was confirmed by immunoblot analyses of protein extracted from the transformed protoplasts using an anti gfp antibody,Y
altogether these data demonstrate that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein is cotranslationally inserted into _LOCATION_ to further reach the _BLANKL_ which represents its stable localization .,Y
we show that the fluorescent protein fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently expressed in tobacco leaf protoplasts is synthesized in the _LOCATION_ and it accumulates in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
