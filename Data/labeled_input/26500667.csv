dual detection of stroma targeted _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _BLANKM_ in a transgenic line revealed that the peanut shaped _BLANKL_ in the leaf epidermis were associated with the production of centrally located _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ signals within the plastids,Y
dual detection of stroma targeted _BLANKM_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a transgenic line revealed that the peanut shaped _BLANKL_ in the leaf epidermis were associated with the production of centrally located _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ signals within the plastids,Y
the morphological phenotype of the plastids was restored to that of wt with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence detected within the _LOCATION_ .,Y
complementation assay of with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a genomic copy of was amplified by pcr with oligonucleotide primers and,Y
the vast majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence was detected as a diffuse signal within the _LOCATION_ stroma .,Y
a transgenic line expressing a full length sgfp fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under an upstream genomic sequence of and its cross with were previously described .,Y
localization of in the leaf epidermis using a transgenic line in which the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was expressed under its own promoter .,Y
genetic complementation of with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to elucidate the relationship between the mutant phenotypes and the function of it,Y
we constructed an promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene and introduced it into the nuclear genome of via agrobacterium mediated transformation .,Y
we further examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in leaf epidermal cells of the complemented plants . yfp signals were exclusively localized to _LOCATION_ with diffuse signals present throughout an area of deeply constricted organelles .,Y
