as an alternative approach subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was analyzed by,Y
subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco leaf protoplasts for subcellular localization of gfp an overnight culture of a. tumefaciens cells transformed with gfp was pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in inducing buffer to an od of .,Y
to construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for transient expression a cdna containing the coding region was amplified from leaf total rna by pcr with primers caccatgtctctggtttgctctttatc/gttccttagtccctctttttgttgc and cloned in a binary gateway vector .,Y
with the predicted localization confocal microscope imaging showed that gfp fluorescence from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with _LOCATION_ autofluorescence in the n. benthaminana mesophyll protoplasts .,Y
