co localization of with compartmental markers in n. benthamiana transiently transformed cells in order to uncover the identity of the positive compartment we have performed co localization studies of full length _PROTEIN_ using red fluorescent protein _METHOD_ tagged markers for _BLANKM_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ cis golgi marker glycine max golgi mannosidase rfp _BLANKL_ marker sialyl transferase rfp _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ donated by ian moore oxford extracellular marker pectin methyl esterase rfp autophagy marker rfp and pi p enriched early/late endosomal compartmental marker dsred fyve .,Y
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot total protein extracts were performed from two week old plants transformed with _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using protein extraction buffer described in hala et al .,Y
observations we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to a _LOCATION_ like intracellular compartments and that localization into these compartments requires an intact c terminus in transient n. benthamiana cell expression .,Y

for cloning of _PROTEIN_ with and endogenous promoter the same two reverse primers were used with aagaattc gatgtttgaggttgagtacgatgg as forward . reverse primers were designed with an omitted stop codon to allow in frame fusion with _METHOD_ .,Y
this is supported by the observation of a strong _LOCATION_ membrane signal in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ possibly coming from an over loaded er .,Y
under the promoter in young seedlings the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was well detected mainly in _LOCATION_ bodies like the compartment in cotyledons probably as an effect of overexpression but the presence of compartments similar to those observed in n. benthamiana transient expression was also detected,Y
this way we could detect the localizations which were in agreement with previous _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ on the _BLANKL_ and er bodies and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a _BLANKL_ like compartment present in the cortical cytoplasm and also in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only weakly colocalized with the _LOCATION_ .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also localized adjacent to the plasma membrane and weakly into the _LOCATION_ .,Y
