seedlings treated with m oryzalin a molecule that depolymerizes microtubules had no effect on the movement of the _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ or mobile compartments in root hairs when compared with dmso treated seedlings .,Y
longitudinal sections of individual root hair cells expressing _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ show _PROTEIN_ localized to the periphery of the _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ .,Y
_BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ was found to co localize with the vacuolar marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ only and not in the small mobile gfp compartments in growing root hairs .,Y
while the arf gef gnom that is associated with the golgi apparatus is considered bfa resistant in arabidopsis roots concentrations of bfa greater than m induce a morphological aggregation of _LOCATION_ containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis root protoplasts .,Y
these data together with our previous analysis of _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ localization support a localization of _PROTEIN_ within the _LOCATION_ and a population of early _BLANKL_ or the _BLANKL_ in arabidopsis root hair cells .,Y
_PROTEIN_ localizes to the _BLANKL_ and _BLANKL_ or early _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis root hair cells .,Y
we also observed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fluorescence in _LOCATION_ bulb like structures which have been characterized previously with respect to the localization of family member _BLANKP_ within _BLANKL_ .,Y
longitudinal sections of individual root hair cells expressing _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ show _PROTEIN_ localized to the periphery of the _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ .,Y
when seedlings were treated with vehicle alone there was dynamic movement of both the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ and the punctate compartments which moved over long distances along the shaft of the root hair .,Y
