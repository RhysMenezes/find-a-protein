_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is clearly expressed in epidermis and cortex but its expression is particularly strong in the endodermis and pericycle .,Y
here _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ highlights numerous bright circular structures in the lumen of the central _LOCATION_ .,Y
inset in h note the boundary between pericycle cells expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
the widespread _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ are co expressed in epidermis cortex and pericycle cells . in these tissues both proteins are detected on the _LOCATION_ of the central vacuole .,Y
methods recombinant dna and generation of transgenic plants the constructs encoding native _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and native _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ have been described previously .,Y
the widespread _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are co expressed in epidermis cortex and pericycle cells . in these tissues both proteins are detected on the _LOCATION_ of the central vacuole .,Y
note _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of young root cap cells and in the tonoplast of root cap cells closer to the elongation zone .,Y
