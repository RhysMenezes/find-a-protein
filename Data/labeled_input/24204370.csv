hind iii and xba i sites were added to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding sequences with primers ggatgcaagcttagtaaaggagaagaac and tctctagattatttgtatagttcatccatgc _BLANKM_ and primers cgttgtg tcctcgataccagcaagcttgtctctagatgactatatgggtcctctctgc and gcagagaggacccatatagtcatctagagacaagcttgctggtatcgaggac acaacg _BLANKP_ .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed fluorescence throughout arabidopsis seedlings consistent with ubiquitous expression of the protein but with especially high fluorescence in the root tip apical meristem and flowers . at the cellular level we observed _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ fluorescence with exclusion from the nucleolus .,Y
generation and visualization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions in plants green fluorescent protein _BLANKM_ was fused in frame to the arabidopsis _BLANKP_ genomic dna as follows .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clone was then subjected to pcr with primers ggtaccgaa ttcctagagtacaacctc and tcgagtgcggccgctaaact atatgattag to add eco ri and not i sites respectively .,Y
