enhanced _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was linked to the pbluscript ks ii vector and the enhanced _METHOD_ was subcloned behind the cdna .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein expressed in n. benthamiana epidermal cells . the cells were examined with brightfield and uv fluorescence microscopy and as a merged image showing either the diffused or the _LOCATION_ localization,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragment was cloned by ligation into the sites behind the camv promoter of .,Y
