_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalized from the _LOCATION_ to punctate structures within min of salt application in epidermal cells .,Y
two minutes after the start of the treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was still predominantly _LOCATION_ but after min most of the _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ had moved from the _BLANKL_ and accumulated at unknown punctate structures .,Y
at a later stage of lrp development _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the _LOCATION_ of all the lrp cells .,Y
isolation of homozygous t dna insertion lines and generation of plants expressing _METHOD_ and gfp fusions homozygous lines were selected by pcr using gene specific primers for two independent t dna insertion lines for both _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ using,Y
