in general the severity of the chloroplast division defect appeared to be correlated with the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation and with the presence of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ filament networks .,Y
we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accurately reflects the activity of in vivo .,Y
_PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ rings are present in _LOCATION_ of other plants to determine whether and proteins assemble into rings in plants,Y
sequencing confirmed that no pcr amplification errors were introduced into the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and that the _BLANKP_ insert was in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence .,Y
construction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene a fragment from the genomic sequence was amplified by pcr from arabidopsis bacterial artificial chromosome clone using primers gaa g gatcc cagacactttctc and aact ggatcc aaagtctacgggg,Y
sequencing confirmed that no pcr amplification errors were introduced into the coding sequence of _BLANKP_ and that the _PROTEIN_ insert was in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was then excised with noti and inserted into the plant transformation vector pmlbart a derivative,Y
