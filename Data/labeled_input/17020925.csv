the cds were recombined by gateway technology first into and then into to give the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ constructs respectively .,Y
like gfp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a very specific localization with uniform expression in the whole _LOCATION_ in most of the nuclei investigated and much weaker expression in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
plants expressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ splice variant showed a strong gfp signal in the _LOCATION_ and a very weak signal in the _BLANKL_ .,Y
