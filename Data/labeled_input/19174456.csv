to investigate their sub cellular localization _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ and _BLANKP_ were transiently expressed in nicotiana benthamiana and their localization then monitored by laser scanning confocal microscopy .,Y
by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized entirely to the _LOCATION_ confirmed by counterstaining with propidium iodide .,Y
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to localize to both the _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ confirming the presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal .,Y
and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were each confined to small organelles which on the basis of their mobility number and size together with the putative c terminal targeting sequence of these gsts were assumed to be _LOCATION_ .,Y
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to localize to both the _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ confirming the presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal .,Y
by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized solely to the _LOCATION_ giving a punctate expression pattern and showing exclusion from the nucleolus .,Y
both constructs expressed the red fluorescent protein mcherry with either a c terminal skl motif added for peroxisomal targeting or as a fusion with the _LOCATION_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ for plasma membrane targeting .,Y
