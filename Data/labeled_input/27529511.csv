for expression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in wt or coding regions of _BLANKP_ was amplified and subcloned into vector _BLANKM_ resulting in the gfp fusion constructs .,Y
co localization studies of and coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ were amplified and subcloned into vector _METHOD_ or respectively resulting in the _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion constructs which were transiently expressed in arabidopsis protoplasts by peg/cacl methods .,Y
in addition transient expression of rfp and gfp fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ partially co localize with each other at cell membrane and _BLANKL_ .,Y
