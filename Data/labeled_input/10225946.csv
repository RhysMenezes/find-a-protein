we have shown recently that a functional _LOCATION_ localization signal may reside within the cooh terminal region of a major member of the family phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ clones were ligated at the clai restriction site to generate _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ translational fusion .,Y
this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric cassette was inserted between the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the nos terminator of an agrobacterium transformation vector pbi nost which is derived from another transformation vector hm by removing its uida gene .,Y
_BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ localizes to the _BLANKL_ in the light intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the pbg seedlings was examined .,Y
as the result an oligoamino acid sequence was inserted between the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ amino acid sequences .,Y
interestingly observation at higher magnification revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fluorescence was speckled within the _LOCATION_ region .,Y
that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed outside the _LOCATION_ and throughout the cell in darkness .,Y
the _BLANKP_ and _BLANKM_ clones were ligated at the clai restriction site to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ in the light intracellular localization of the _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion protein in the pbg seedlings was examined .,Y
red light induces _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the time course of nuclear accumulation of phyb gfp during the dark to light transition was followed .,Y
