our _METHOD_ assay demonstrated that the product of an extra copy of the nuclear gene for chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is imported into both _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis and oryza .,Y
in two of them no nuclear copy of mitochondrial is identifiably present and instead a second copy of nuclear encoded chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is present . transient assays using _METHOD_ indicate that this duplicate gene is dual targeted to _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ .,Y
construction and visualization of green fluorescent protein fusion proteins sequences encoding the first and residues of chloroplast like _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and oryza were amplified by pcr with primer pairs and respectively and fused in frame with the upstream region of a synthetic green fluorescent protein _METHOD_ .,Y
