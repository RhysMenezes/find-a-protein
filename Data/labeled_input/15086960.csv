transient expression system and confocal microscopy promoter tmv omega sequence and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene were introduced into the multi cloning site of .,Y
conclusion _PROTEIN_ was found on the _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ in mature chloroplasts but only on the envelope inner membrane in dark grown c. reinhardtii cells .,Y
results fluorescence of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein transiently expressed in young pea leaves was found at the periphery of mature _LOCATION_ and on _BLANKL_ by confocal fluorescence microscopy .,Y

this experiment indicated that _PROTEIN_ was located on envelope and _LOCATION_ in developed _BLANKL_ although the relative enrichment seemed greater,Y
