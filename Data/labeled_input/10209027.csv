to investigate the intracellular localization of pollen tube rac in more detail sequences encoding wild type and mutant forms of _PROTEIN_ fused to the cooh terminus of _METHOD_ were transiently,Y
in summary the results described here indicate that _PROTEIN_ homologues localize specifically to the _LOCATION_ at the pollen tube tip and confirm that the cooh terminal prenylation domain is essential for,Y
into the same expression vector sequences were inserted that encoded _METHOD_ fused to the nh terminus of the following polypeptides _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ the ph domain of human plc,Y
_METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ did not show membrane association and was localized to the _LOCATION_ similar to gfp .,Y
into the same expression vector sequences were inserted that encoded _METHOD_ fused to the nh terminus of the following polypeptides _PROTEIN_ _BLANKP_ and _BLANKP_ the ph domain of human plc,Y
