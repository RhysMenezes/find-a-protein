results _PROTEIN_ protein mainly localizes in _LOCATION_ to investigate the biological activity of transformants the expression and localization of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion protein was first studied using immunoblotting analysis and fluorescence microscopy in arabidopsis cells .,Y
the gfp fluorescence was detected mainly in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over expressed suspended cells .,Y
to ascertain the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the localization of _METHOD_ in transforming arabidopsis suspended cells was also studied .,Y
results _BLANKP_ protein mainly localizes in _BLANKL_ to investigate the biological activity of transformants the expression and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was first studied using immunoblotting analysis and fluorescence microscopy in arabidopsis cells .,Y
as an additional control suspended cell lines of the mutant expressing an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were also established . the gfp fluorescence was also detected in the _LOCATION_ while the gfp was detected all over the cytoplasm in mutant cells only expressing a gfp protein derived by the promoter .,Y
the gene encoding arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was inserted into the vector between the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the _METHOD_ reporter gene .,Y
