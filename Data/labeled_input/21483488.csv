here we show that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ and that two t dna insertions lines deficient in lecrk have a gain of susceptibility phenotype specifically towards the oomycete phytophthora brassicae .,Y
to determine the subcellular localization of lecrk we constructed the binary vector ps _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that is suitable for transient in planta expression of c terminal gfp tagged lecrk .,Y
figure _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ .,Y
confocal images of a n. benthamiana epidermal cell transiently expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry .,Y
_PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ lecrk contains a putative transmembrane domain and hence hypothesized to be associated with a membrane .,Y
this demonstrates that in these transient expression assays _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ and points to association of _BLANKP_ with the _BLANKL_ .,Y
lr recombination enabled cloning into binary vector and resulting in plasmids pk lecrk and ps _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively .,Y
this demonstrates that in these transient expression assays _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ is targeted to the _BLANKL_ and points to association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ .,Y
