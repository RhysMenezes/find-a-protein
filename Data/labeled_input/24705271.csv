the pgreen binary vector derivative containing a nos terminator with a c terminal gfp fusion and spectinomycin and basta resistance genes was used for the native promoter construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
enlargement of transformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicated fluorescence coinciding with dapi stain throughout the _LOCATION_ both diffuse and punctate .,Y
flourescence was greater in the transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with localization to the _LOCATION_ and diffuse and variable flourescence in the rest of the cell visible in most of the cells of the epidermis .,Y
flourescence was visible in some cells of the epidermis of the cotyledon associated with _LOCATION_ as well as diffuse within the cell _BLANKL_ of some cells in transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
homozygous transformed seedlings were selected in the third generation for the native promoter construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in background and at for the overexpression construct _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in wt background .,Y
