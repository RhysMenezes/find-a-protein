figure transient expression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .,Y
most cells expressing _PROTEIN_ exhibited fluorescent _LOCATION_ _BLANKL_ and _BLANKL_ .,Y
localization of yfp at myosin xi pal sub domain fusions previously we have fused the pal sub domain from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ and have shown that the fusion protein labels _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ .,Y

infiltrations of each _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion were performed at separate times and approximately cells in total were observed for each _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ fusion .,Y

the _METHOD_ fusion with the _PROTEIN_ was usually seen also in the _LOCATION_ however some unidentified vesicular structures were sometimes observed in a few cells .,Y
