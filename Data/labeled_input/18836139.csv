the plasmid in which _PROTEIN_ is fused to of _METHOD_ has been previously described .,Y
_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized predominantly to the _LOCATION_ inclusive of signals detected in the cytosol surrounding the nucleus .,Y
the subcellular localization of and atebp was addressed using an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ red fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ fusion . transient expression of these autofluoresence tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated their co localization predominantly at the _LOCATION_ which was confirmed by fret analysis .,Y
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was located mainly in the _BLANKL_ with some signals at the _BLANKL_ and the _LOCATION_ .,Y
