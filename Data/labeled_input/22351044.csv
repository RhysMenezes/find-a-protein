the _PROTEIN_ gene expressed in leaf primordia encodes a plant specific _LOCATION_ protein containing an domain with cysteine repeats .,Y
we used the tobacco cultured cell line by expressing the _PROTEIN_ fused _METHOD_ to examine _LOCATION_ localization of in dividing cells .,Y
the resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and truncated eyfp cdna fragments were subcloned into the binary vector .,Y
materials and methods construction of plasmids carrying the _BLANKP_ sequence and its derivatives to express _BLANKM_ fusions in cells full length _PROTEIN_ cdna and its truncated cdna fragments which are shown in fig . a were pcr amplified with specific primer pairs and cloned into _METHOD_ fusion vector peyfp .,Y
in materials and methods we cultured the transformed by cells in liquid medium containing estradiol for h to induce transcription of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene .,Y
_PROTEIN_ proteins are present in speckles in and around the _LOCATION_ and in the _BLANKL_ of some leaf epidermal cells .,Y
materials and methods construction of plasmids carrying the _PROTEIN_ sequence and its derivatives to express _METHOD_ fusions in cells full length _BLANKP_ cdna and its truncated cdna fragments which are shown in fig .,Y
we then examined those cells for subcellular and subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins by observing randomly dividing cells for the fluorescent signals of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
