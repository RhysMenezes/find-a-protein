Input,Output
the _BLANKM_ signal was detected in the _BLANKL_ of cells in cotyledon root division zone root elongation zone and hypocotyl of plants transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
to construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and yfp the full length coding region was cloned into the pentr tm /d topo vector and then into vectors pearlygate or pearlygate respectively to produce yfp or yfp .,Y
