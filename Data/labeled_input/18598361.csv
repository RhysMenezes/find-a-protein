conclusion the localization of the head of _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells as investigated here for the first time suggests a close linkage between this myosin xi and cytoplasmic microfilaments that support the rapid streaming of organelles such as _LOCATION_ .,Y
the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and rfp signals is shown in panels and .,Y
the f actin reporter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also produced different filamentous patterns near _LOCATION_ .,Y
the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marked highly fluorescent short bundles in _BLANKL_ or occasionally fluorescent patches in or close to nuclei these were absent in cells expressing rfp .,Y
using the _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ vector a derivative of pcat we prepared an n terminal _METHOD_ fusion with the motor head of _PROTEIN_ including the neck domain _BLANKP_ amino acid residues fig .,Y

for protein expression in cells of n. benthamiana the expression cassette of pcat containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was cut with hind iii and the fragment of kb was ligated with the binary expression vector also cut with hind iii .,Y

due to the diffusive tendency of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exposure times between and msec were used for widefield fluorescence microscopy proving to be a fast and appropriate method for studying its distribution .,Y
