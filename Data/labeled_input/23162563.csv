transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing or _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ were generated by vacuum infiltration with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain transformed with the constructs or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
constitutively overexpressed or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are efficiently sorted to the _LOCATION_ indicating that the protein is approved by the _BLANKL_ quality control .,Y
the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified using the primers gtcgac atgccaatgactccatc and actagt acagaagttgcgg and fused to _METHOD_ coding sequence via sal i/ xho i /spe i sites to generate _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
