at the subcellular level the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was distributed at the _LOCATION_ as expected with a clear punctuate pattern not previously observed .,Y
the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct allowed detecting a broad fluorescence in the _LOCATION_ which might be due to overexpression .,Y
at the subcellular level the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was distributed at the _BLANKL_ as expected with a clear punctuate pattern not previously observed . the same _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ construct allowed detecting a broad fluorescence in the _LOCATION_ which might be due to overexpression .,N
