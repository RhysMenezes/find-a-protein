fusions of _PROTEIN_ or _BLANKP_ with the _METHOD_ localized to arabidopsis _LOCATION_ .,Y
transient expression of gfp and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for transient expression of fusion constructs the plasmid was used .,Y
fusions of _BLANKP_ or _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ localized to arabidopsis _LOCATION_ .,Y
transient expression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion constructs although the transport activities of and in yeast and xenopus plasma membranes provided indirect evidence that these proteins might be transporters of the plasma membrane targeting of and to other membranes in planta can not be excluded .,Y
so far only _BLANKP_ _PROTEIN_ has been characterized and was shown to be a _LOCATION_ localized h symporter with broad substrate specificity .,Y
