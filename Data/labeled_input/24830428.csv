the p _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was absent in unms while it became significantly higher in bcp _LOCATION_ .,Y
and in pollen at different stages we fused the _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ genomic sequences which contain promoter and gene coding region with _METHOD_ . the yfp signal of both fusion proteins was detectable in _LOCATION_ which was consistent with their function as transcription factors .,Y
to generate p _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and p _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs genomic fragments of and were amplified .,Y
for p _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ yfp signal was dim in unm although it was still distinguishable from the pollen auto fluorescence .,Y

and in pollen at different stages we fused the _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ genomic sequences which contain promoter and gene coding region with _METHOD_ . the yfp signal of both fusion proteins was detectable in _LOCATION_ which was consistent with their function as transcription factors .,Y
vegetative _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed at bcp stage and tcp stage .,Y
vegetative _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed at bcp stage tcp stage and mp stage .,Y
