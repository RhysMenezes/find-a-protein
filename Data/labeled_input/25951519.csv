subcellular localization of transformation of isolated protoplasts from rosette leaves of six week old arabidopsis thaliana ecotype col was performed according to using of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dna .,Y
the _LOCATION_ localization of _BLANKP_ was demonstrated by transient expression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts .,Y
protoplasts expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for two days were placed on a slice in a drop of wi solution and imaged using zeiss confocal microscope equipped with lasers for and nm excitation .,Y
the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated by transient expression of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts .,Y
the cdnas encoding for full length was cloned in eyfp which allowed expression of _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ at the c terminus .,Y
a primary sequence based search in arabidopsis thaliana revealed seven putatively plastid localized nats of which _PROTEIN_ showed the highest conservation of the acetyl coa binding pocket . the _LOCATION_ localization of _BLANKP_ was demonstrated by transient expression of _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts .,N
the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated by transient expression of _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts .,N
