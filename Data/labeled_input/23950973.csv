in contrast the _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion protein was specifically targeted to the _BLANKL_ fluorescent images of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were clearly different from those of a marker for internal membranes indicating that _BLANKP_ functions at the _BLANKL_ in by cells as in arabidopsis guard cells .,Y
to study intracellular localization of the protein expressed in by cells we introduced the _METHOD_ construct fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ into by protoplasts and examined its intracellular localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy .,Y
