generating transgenic lines expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins and fluorescence microscopy imaging the _BLANKP_ gene and bp of its promoter were amplified and subcloned into a vector using sali and ncoi restriction sites with primers listed in table .,Y
generating transgenic lines expressing _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ fusion proteins and fluorescence microscopy imaging the _PROTEIN_ gene and bp of its promoter were amplified and subcloned into a vector using sali and ncoi restriction sites with primers listed in table . using the restriction sites the cdna was ligated in the end of the _METHOD_ coding region of .,Y
to colocalize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the cell wall we stained leaf samples with propidium iodide for s and rinsed with distilled water .,Y
