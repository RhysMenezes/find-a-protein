methods vector construction in order to generate _BLANKP_ genbank and _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ expressing vectors attctp and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were ligated into gateway compatible vector pxcsg containing the constitutive promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and a c terminal strepii tag resulting in pxcsg attctp and pxcsg attctp gfp .,Y
a ca overlay assay showed attctp to be a ca binding protein and localization experiments revealed _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis seedlings .,Y
localization of attctp in arabidopsis thaliana stably transformed seven to eight days old a. thaliana seedlings expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of a camv promoter were used to investigate cellular localization of attctp .,Y
leaf epidermal cells showed _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
therefore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was assumed to,Y
