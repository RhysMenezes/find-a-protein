two types of fluorescent proteins were fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which has two amino acid substitutions with alanine and phenylalanine respectively and _BLANKM_ .,Y
most of the fluorescent signals due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed at the cell boundaries and at the _LOCATION_ while fluorescence due to mrfp alone was distributed over the entire cytoplasm and nucleus with the exception of vacuoles .,Y
we detected fluorescence due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mainly at the cell periphery which suggested the presence of _BLANKP_ at the _LOCATION_ or at the cell wall at the cell boundary .,Y
examination of plasmolyzed cells revealed that signals due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were concentrated at the _LOCATION_ as opposed to the cell wall .,Y
immunofluorescence staining of mts confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was concentrated at the equatorial plane of _LOCATION_ between sets of separating daughter chromosomes during cytokinesis .,Y
