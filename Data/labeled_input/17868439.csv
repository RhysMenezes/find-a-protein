protein detection and chromatin affinity purification to investigate whether the chap procedure using tags is feasible we used transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing g _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as example .,Y
the g _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ expression is predominantly visible in the _LOCATION_ of the floral meristem cells of floral buds from stage onwards while there is no or minimal expression in the rest of the,Y
correct spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ expression was observed predominantly in the _LOCATION_ of the floral meristem cells of floral buds from stage onwards .,Y
