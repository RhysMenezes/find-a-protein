the pcr fragments were cloned into the pentr/d topo vector and used to establish _METHOD_ fusion constructs using the vector . the _BLANKP_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ sequences were also inserted into the vector for expression under control of the promoter .,Y
translational fusions to the _METHOD_ suggest _LOCATION_ localisation of the _PROTEIN_ proteins .,Y
the pcr fragments were cloned into the pentr/d topo vector and used to establish _METHOD_ fusion constructs using the vector . the _PROTEIN_ _BLANKP_ and _BLANKP_ sequences were also inserted into the vector for expression under control of the promoter .,Y
analysis of plants carrying the _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs suggests that the and isoforms presumably are also _LOCATION_ proteins .,Y
analysis of plants carrying the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ constructs suggests that the and isoforms presumably are also _LOCATION_ proteins .,Y
thus the _PROTEIN_ protein directs _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ .,Y
