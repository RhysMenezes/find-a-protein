the _METHOD_ as a trackable cargo was targeted to _LOCATION_ when fused to plastoglobulin _PROTEIN_ as the carrier .,Y
yfp patterns were similar to those observed in protoplasts transiently expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating targeting of the yfp cargo to _LOCATION_ in planta .,Y
_PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ sequences were excised from by restriction digest with aat ii and kpn i. fragments were blunted and ligated in the sma i site of binary vector yielding _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ .,Y
_BLANKP_ and _BLANKM_ sequences were excised from by restriction digest with aat ii and kpn i. fragments were blunted and ligated in the sma i site of binary vector yielding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .,Y
results sequence requirement for targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ in the absence of data on the sequence requirement for plastoglobule targeting we designed a series of c terminal gfp fusion constructs that removed portions of coding sequence .,Y
similar to adipocyte differentiation related protein in animal cells most of the protein sequence of _PROTEIN_ was necessary for targeting to _LOCATION_ .,Y
stable transformation of a. thaliana plants with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was carried out using the floral dip method as described .,Y
the _METHOD_ as a trackable cargo was targeted to _BLANKL_ when fused to plastoglobulin _PROTEIN_ as the carrier . similar to adipocyte differentiation related protein in animal cells most of the protein sequence of _BLANKP_ was necessary for targeting to _LOCATION_ .,N
