here we generated a functionally competent _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and investigated its spatial distribution within arabidopsis cells . this myosin was found to associate primarily not with larger organelles as was broadly assumed but with _LOCATION_ trafficking along f actin .,Y
an analogous co localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the golgi marker nag mturquoise showed that only a small fraction of the myosin pool was associated with _LOCATION_ .,Y
this distribution pattern suggested that most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pool is associated with _LOCATION_ whereas a relatively small fraction of myosin was present elsewhere in _BLANKL_ .,Y
materials and methods _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis transformation and immunoblotting a genomic copy of the _BLANKP_ tagged by insertion of the _BLANKM_ orf was generated as described for the flag tagged xi k .,Y
interestingly although most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with _LOCATION_ a smaller fraction of er overlapped with myosin .,Y
furthermore the fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapping _LOCATION_ was only as defined by manders coefficient .,Y
