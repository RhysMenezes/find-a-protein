the identity of the aba induced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles .,Y
taken together we concluded that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is sequestered to _LOCATION_ and is degraded in response to aba .,Y
after prolonged wortmannin exposure of gfp plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fluorescence signals appeared in the cell periphery and _LOCATION_ region .,Y
the above analysis suggested that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins are relocated to the _LOCATION_ via an endosome prevacuolar compartment pathway in response to aba .,Y
furthermore confocal microscopic observations indicated that aba mediated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles showed co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker tip .,Y
protoplast preparation and vacuole release _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry tip constructs were co expressed in n .,Y
furthermore confocal microscopic observations indicated that aba mediated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles showed co localization with the _BLANKL_ marker tip . taken together we concluded that _BLANKM_ _BLANKP_ is sequestered to _LOCATION_ and is degraded in response to aba .,N
furthermore confocal microscopic observations indicated that aba mediated _BLANKM_ _PROTEIN_ particles showed co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker tip . taken together we concluded that _METHOD_ _BLANKP_ is sequestered to _BLANKL_ and is degraded in response to aba .,N
