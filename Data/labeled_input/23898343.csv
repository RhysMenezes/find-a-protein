here we provide evidence that _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ which are the only genes in arabidopsis belong to ysl group ii are localized to _LOCATION_ and to internal membranes resembling _BLANKL_ .,Y
in the small number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants identified we observed fluorescent label accumulating within the _LOCATION_ .,Y
