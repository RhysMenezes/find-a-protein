immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ .,Y
in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially co localized with the rat sialyl transferase that is localized to _LOCATION_ and the _BLANKL_ .,Y
_PROTEIN_ is weakly expressed in various tissues including the root . when transiently expressed as a _METHOD_ fusion in protoplasts it co localized with the vha subunit of the proton transporting v type atpase in the _BLANKL_ _LOCATION_ .,Y
to obtain the rescue construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the stop codon of the _BLANKP_ gene was deleted and ligated in frame with the _BLANKM_ coding sequence .,Y
in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially co localized with the rat sialyl transferase that is localized to _BLANKL_ and the _LOCATION_ .,Y
to obtain the rescue construct _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene was deleted and ligated in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence .,Y
the results are consistent with a preferential localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ .,Y
_PROTEIN_ is weakly expressed in various tissues including the root . when transiently expressed as a _METHOD_ fusion in protoplasts it co localized with the vha subunit of the proton transporting v type atpase in the _LOCATION_ _BLANKL_ .,Y
_PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ transient expression in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in localization of an atclc d gfp fusion in small dots that were distributed throughout the cytoplasm .,Y
