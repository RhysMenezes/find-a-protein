_PROTEIN_ protein recognizes the ttgacc w box sequences and its translational fusion with _METHOD_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ .,Y
conclusion the _LOCATION_ localization and sequence specific dna binding activity support that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcription factor .,Y
as shown in figure the transiently expressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ .,Y
subcellular localization full length _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified with two gene specific primers . the amplified fragment was digested with and and cloned into a _METHOD_ vector behind the camv promoter .,Y
to determine the subcellular location of _BLANKP_ we constructed a _METHOD_ protein fusion of _PROTEIN_ .,Y
to determine the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we constructed a _METHOD_ protein fusion of _BLANKP_ .,Y
