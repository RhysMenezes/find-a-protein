two separate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs were cloned one at purdue and one at rothamsted .,Y
images of the _LOCATION_ marker and the green fluorescence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were sequentially taken within second in the same cell because plant mitochondria actively moves along f actins .,Y
subcellular localization of in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and a _LOCATION_ marker atpase rfp were co transformed into purified arabidopsis leaf protoplasts using polyethyleneglycol method .,Y
