analysis of the _LOCATION_ and soluble proteomes identified several plasma membrane localized proteins with alterred abundance in tap tagged rescue lines compared to wild type . using affinity purification _METHOD_ we uniquely identified two additional aha isoforms _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ which copurified with tap tagged .,Y
relative quantification of the abundance of ntapi _PROTEIN_ in membrane and purified samples the protein enrichment from upper phase fractions by igg resin is approximately fold under mild washing conditions . addition of mm nacl further reduces _METHOD_ identification of contaminating proteins but also,Y
