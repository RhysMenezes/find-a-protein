_LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and without before and after plasmolysis the deduced amino acid sequence of predicted the presence of a signal peptide at the n terminus suggesting that the nascent polypeptide is imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and then secreted outside the cell .,Y
to elucidate experimentally the cellular localization of this protein and the role of the cbm in localization we generated fusions between the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ .,Y
n terminal and c terminal gfp fusion of _PROTEIN_ with and without cbm for n terminal _METHOD_ fusions the signal peptide was fused upstream of the gfp followed downstream by the rest of the cdna .,Y
for the c terminal gfp fusions the cdna was fused upstream of the _METHOD_ after removing the stop codon and the utr from the _PROTEIN_ cdna .,Y
_LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _BLANKM_ with and without before and after plasmolysis the deduced amino acid sequence of predicted the presence of a signal peptide at the n terminus suggesting that the nascent polypeptide is imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and then secreted outside the cell . to elucidate experimentally the cellular localization of this protein and the role of the cbm in localization we generated fusions between the _METHOD_ and _BLANKP_ .,N
