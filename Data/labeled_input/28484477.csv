in order to begin to assess the subcellular localization of glyrs in vivo md _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently expressed and visualized via clsm in tobacco suspension cultured by cells serving as,Y
similar to the abovementioned previous results for at md _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed diffuse localization throughout the cell similar to co expressed cherry a red fluorescent protein that served as a _LOCATION_ marker protein .,Y
as shown in figure all three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized in protoplasts to both co expressed pdc pl cherry containing _BLANKL_ and mitotracker stained _LOCATION_ .,Y
figure _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ localization of md os or _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts .,Y
plant materials rna and dna extraction and identification of plant glyrs arabidopsis thaliana heynh ecotype columbia was the genetic background of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _BLANKM_ transgenic line .,Y

as shown in figure all three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized in protoplasts to both co expressed pdc pl cherry containing _LOCATION_ and mitotracker stained _BLANKL_ .,Y
by contrast md _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to distinct globular shaped structures which co localized with the co expressed _LOCATION_ marker fusion protein consisting of the subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex fused to cherry indicating that similar to previous results for at md is localized to plastids .,Y
however upon induction _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized consistently to both _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ based on the co localization of the fusion protein with chlorophyll autofluorescence and mitotracker staining respectively corroborating results for the dual localization of at gfp in tobacco by cells,Y
as shown in figures f _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to both co expressed pdc pl cherry containing _LOCATION_ as well as to endogenous coxii containing _BLANKL_ .,Y
