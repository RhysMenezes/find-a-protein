when arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was fused to _BLANKM_ and expressed two different patterns emerged . in arabidopsis cell suspensions a clear _BLANKL_ localization could be observed however in onion epidermal cells clear targeting to both _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ was observed .,Y
subcellular targeting of ndb proteins the three arabidopsis ndb proteins _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been determined to be _LOCATION_ which was confirmed in this study .,Y
for we see a similar pattern as with _PROTEIN_ in that _BLANKL_ targeting was observed in arabidopsis cell suspensions and dual targeted to _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ in onion epidermal cells .,Y
this confirms that _BLANKP_ is dual targeted to both _BLANKL_ and _BLANKL_ and that _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ can only be targeted to _LOCATION_ .,Y
_METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _BLANKP_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana,Y
this confirms that _PROTEIN_ is dual targeted to both _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ and that _BLANKP_ and _BLANKP_ can only be targeted to _BLANKL_ .,Y

when arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was fused to _BLANKM_ and expressed two different patterns emerged . in arabidopsis cell suspensions a clear _LOCATION_ localization could be observed however in onion epidermal cells clear targeting to both _BLANKL_ and _BLANKL_ was observed .,Y
subcellular targeting of nda proteins it has previously been shown that both nda proteins from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _BLANKP_ are dual targeted to _LOCATION_ and _BLANKL_ by both _METHOD_ tagging and western blot analysis .,Y
into isolated arabidopsis mitochondria it can be concluded that _PROTEIN_ is dual targeted to _BLANKL_ and _LOCATION_ .,Y
