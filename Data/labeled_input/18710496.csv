findings we localized the five uncharacterized members of the arabidopsis oct family designated _BLANKP_ _PROTEIN_ via _METHOD_ fusions and protoplast transformation to the tonoplast .,Y
restricition sites used were for _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ _BLANKP_ saci / bam hi for _PROTEIN_ _BLANKP_ bam hi/ bsp hi and _BLANKP_ kpni / bsp hi the linker between the atocts and _METHOD_ was amino acids .,Y

fusion proteins of _BLANKP_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized at membranes in the protoplasts most probably at the _LOCATION_ .,Y
for all five fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the signal is associated with the _LOCATION_ .,Y

fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _BLANKP_ _METHOD_ were localized at membranes in the protoplasts most probably at the _LOCATION_ .,Y
to discover the subcellular distribution we fused the open reading frames of all the family members translationally to _METHOD_ and expressed the proteins transiently in protoplasts . as a control _PROTEIN_ was used for localization to the _LOCATION_ as shown before .,Y
