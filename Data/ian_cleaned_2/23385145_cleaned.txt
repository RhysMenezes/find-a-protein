!~ABS~! Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) form non-selective cation entry pathways regulated by calmodulin (CaM), a universal Ca2+ sensor in eukaryotes. Although CaM binding has been shown to be important for Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation of CNGC activity, the CaM-binding properties of these channels have been investigated in a few cases only. We show that CNGC20 from Arabidopsis thaliana binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and interacts with all AtCaM isoforms but not with the CaM-like proteins CML8 and CML9. CaM interaction with the full-length channel was demonstrated in planta, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. This interaction occurred at the plasma membrane, in accordance with our localization data of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused CNGC20 proteins. The CaM-binding site was mapped to an isoleucine glutamine (IQ) motif, which has not been characterized in plant CNGCs so far. Our results show that compared with the overlapping binding sites for cyclic nucleotides and CaM in CNGCs studied so far, they are sequentially organized in CNGC20. The presence of two alternative CaM-binding modes indicates that ligand regulation of plant CNGCs is more complex than previously expected. Since the IQ domain is conserved among plant CNGCs, this domain adds to the variability of Ca2+-dependent channel control mechanisms underlining the functional diversity within this multigene family.
!~RES~! We used the C-terminus of CNGC20 (CNGC20-C) to study its interaction with CaM isoforms and CMLs in pairwise yeast two-hybrid (YTH) interaction assays. This approach allowed the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the interaction, resulting in His auxotrophic growth and transactivation of a β-galactosidase gene (CITATION). Co-expression of CNGC20-C as a bait (BD-CNGC20-C) and CaM2 (identical to 3 and 5), 4 (identical to 1), 6, and 7 as prey (AD-CaM) enabled yeast growth in the absence of His, demonstrating that all four CaM isoforms represent putative interaction partners of CNGC20 (CITATIONA). The strength of the interaction was quantified as relative β-galactosidase activities, showing robust interaction for all CaM isoforms (CITATIONB). These CaM isoforms constitute group 1 of the CaM/CML family in Arabidopsis and share ≥96% amino acid identity (CITATION). The two most related CML isoforms are those of group 2. We therefore chose two members of this group, CML8 with 73% identity, and CML9 with 50% identity to CaM2. CML8 and CML9 were previously used for interaction studies with CNGC1 and 2 (CITATION), providing a basis for comparability of the CaM selectivity among different CNGCs. Like CNGC20, CML9 is up-regulated upon salinity stress and PAMP treatment (CITATION, CITATION), and CML9 knockout mutants are characterized by an enhanced tolerance to salt stress. However, no interaction was found for the CaM-like proteins CML8 and CML9 (CITATION). Fig. 1The C-terminus of CNGC20 interacts with calmodulins but not calmodulin-like proteins. (A) Left columns: the CNGC20 C-terminus (CNGC20-C) fused to the GAL4-binding domain (BD) was used in the YTH assay together with CaM isoforms or the CaM-like proteins CML8 and CML9, which were fused to the GAL4-activation domain (AD). Right columns: experiments repeated using the BD without CNGC20-C. Yeasts were grown in the absence of tryptophan (–W) and leucine (–L) for selection of co-transformed cells, and in the absence of histidine (–H), tryptophan (–W) and leucine (–L) to monitor protein interactions. (B) Interaction between CNGC20-C and CaM isoforms, CML8 and CML9 was quantified using the β-galactosidase activity assay. Bars represent mean results of two independent measurements with three replicates each. Labels as in (A). The C-terminus of CNGC20 interacts with calmodulins but not calmodulin-like proteins.

Bars represent mean results of two independent measurements with three replicates each. Labels as in (A). To map the CaM interaction domain within CNGC20, we investigated binding capacities of different truncated C-terminal fragments. CITATIONA illustrates the C-terminus including the α-helices and β-sheets present within the CNBD of CNGC20 and derived peptides used in the YTH assays. When the last 63 amino acids were deleted from the C-terminus of CNGC20 (CNGC20-C-ΔC63), interaction was not observed for CaMs or for CMLs (CITATIONB). The re-addition of 29 amino acids of the channel’s C-terminus including the region homologous to the previously identified CaMBD (CITATION, CITATION) was also not able to restore the interaction with CaM isoforms in CNGC20-C-ΔC34 (CITATIONC). These results show that essential parts for the establishment of the CaM contact are likely to be provided by the last 34 amino acids. Indeed, a peptide representing the last 34 amino acids (CNGC20-CC) was able to interact with all four CaM isoforms but not with CML8 and CML9 (CITATIOND), as was the case with the complete C-terminus. Thus, in CNGC20, CaM interacts with a region downstream of the CNBD, behavior different from that of other CNGCs (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). The lack of interaction with CaM was also observed for a peptide including the αB and αC helices (CNGC20-αBC, CITATIONE). In a previous report (CITATION), a tetrapeptidic stretch following the αC-helix (WRTW) was shown to be important for high-affinity CaM binding of NtCBP4. However, in CNGC20, a peptide including the αC-helix and the corresponding residues WRLR did not induce CaM binding in CNGC20-αC (CITATIONF). These results confirm that the last 34 amino acids of CNGC20 are sufficient to establish the full CaM interaction activity of the entire C-terminus. Additional CaM-binding activity within the C-terminus does not exist, because all fragments excluding the last 34 amino acids were unable to interact. While the CaMBD overlaps with the CNBD in plant CNGCs studied so far, these two ligand interaction domains are sequentially organized in CNGC20. Fig. 2The CaM-binding domain in CNGC20 maps outside of the CNBD. (A) Schematic illustration of CNGC20 peptides used in YTH assays. Gray bars represent the C-terminus of CNGC20 including the CNBD with eight β-sheets (light gray boxes), three α-helices (white boxes) and the last α-helix (orange, αC) as predicted for the CaMBD.

An alignment of part of the C-termini from plant CNGCs is shown in CITATIONA. Within the αC-helix of the CNBD, an unclassified database CaMBD is found in CNGC1, CNGC2, CNGC3, CNGC4, HvCBT1 and NtCBP4 (calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca). CaM binding to this region has been experimentally verified for CNGC1, CNGC2 and NtCBP4 (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). Although the homologous region in CNGC20 is also predicted to form a CaM-binding site (calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca), this region corresponding to the αC-helix of the CNBD of CNGC20 did not interact with CaMs (CITATION). Fig. 3The IQ domain mediates interaction of CNGC20 and CaMs. (A) Alignment of the C-terminal regions from 20 Arabidopsis CNGCs, the barley CaM-binding transporter HvCBT1 and tobacco CaM-binding protein NtCBP4, including its predicted αC-helix of the CNBD (Arazi et al. 2000) and two CaM-binding sites (gray bars): (i) the CaMBD (CITATION, CITATION) and the extended CaMBD (gray dots, Arazi et al. 2000), (ii) an IQ motif according to Bähler and Rhoads (CITATION; CITATION). Boxes in the CNGC20 sequence show the peptides used for YTH, CNGC20-αC (dashed, see CITATION) and CNGC20-IQ (solid, see B). CNGCs are separated into five subgroups according to CITATION. (B) Interaction of the IQ domain of CNGC20 (CNGC20-IQ) and CaMs in a YTH assay as described in CITATION. (C) Ca2+-dependent CaM binding to CNGC20-C was determined in a CaM overlay assay. Cell extracts of E. coli expressing CNGC20-C were separated by SDS–PAGE, subjected to Western blot and incubated with purified, Strep-tagged CaM2 in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 or in the absence of Ca2+ (5 mM EGTA). Strep-CaM2 interacting with CNGC20-C (MBP fusion: 62 kDa) was detected with an anti-Strep antibody.

Strep-CaM2 interacting with CNGC20-C (MBP fusion: 62 kDa) was detected with an anti-Strep antibody. Interestingly, an additional α-helical structure following the CNBD is predicted in CNGC20 (R734-L755, CITATION), which is located almost at the very end of the 764 amino acid long channel protein. Within this region, an IQ motif is present within all plant CNGCs (CITATIONA; CITATION). IQ domains have been shown to interact with EF-hand-containing proteins and therefore represent likely targets for CaM interaction (CITATION). Indeed, a stretch of only 16 amino acids (AARQIQVAWRYRRRRL) corresponding to the IQ domain (CNGC20-IQ) was able to interact with all Arabidopsis CaM isoforms (CITATIONB). While the YTH method was suited to demonstrate interaction with CaMs in vivo and to map the responsible CaMBD, the calcium concentration during the interaction is unknown. The calcium dependence of the interaction was investigated using a CaM overlay assay, and it was demonstrated that the interaction of CaM2 with CNGC20-C required the presence of Ca2+ (CITATIONC). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry fusion proteins were used to monitor the cellular distribution of CNGC20 and CaM2 proteins, respectively. GFP fluorescence was detected in the plasma membrane of mesophyll protoplasts and epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana expressing a CNGC20–GFP fusion protein (CITATIONA–C). Similarly, an N-terminal fusion of GFP resulted in plasma membrane localization of GFP–CNGC20 (CITATIOND). In addition to the plasma membrane localization, we frequently observed punctuate structures within cells exhibiting strong expression (CITATIONA). As fluorescence from CNGC–GFP fusion proteins can be observed along the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane (CITATION), these dots may highlight the involved organelles.

Plasma membrane and intracellular GFP fluorescence of CNGC20GFP fusion proteins or BiFC signals from CNGC20 interaction with CaM. (A) GFP–CNGC20; (B) BiFC CNGC20–VN and VC–CaM2. All constructs were expressed in tobacco epidermal cells. Bars represent 10 µm (A) and 20 µm (B). In addition to the fluorescence at the plasma membrane, dots near the plasma membrane were often visible. Upon co-expression of CNGC20–GFP and CaM2–mCherry in tobacco leaves, red fluorescence from the latter protein was equally distributed between the cytosol and the nucleus and was localized near the plasma membrane (CITATIONE–H). Thus, according to their physical vicinity, CaM2 and CNGC20 could interact in vivo. To visualize this interaction, we used the split Venus interaction assay in N. benthamiana (CITATION). CNGC20 was fused either N- or C-terminally to the N-terminal part of the yellow fluorescent reporter Venus (VN = VenusN), resulting in CNGC20–VN and VN–CNGC20, respectively. CaM2, CML8 and CML9 were added at the C-terminal side of the C-terminal part of Venus (VC = VenusC). Following pairwise co-expression in tobacco leaves, the yellow fluorescence was compared for the different combinations. While bright yellow fluorescence was reported from epidermal cells upon co-expression of CNGC20–VN with VC–CaM2 (CITATIONA, CITATION), it was reduced to background levels when the reporter was fused to the N-terminus of CNGC20 (VN–CNGC20, CITATIONC). These results demonstrate that CNGC20 can recruit CaM2 to the plasma membrane. In order to compare the efficiency of interaction, we used CNGC20–VN for co-expression with VC–CaM2, VC–CML8 and VC–CML9. As judged from the fluorescence intensities obtained in parallel experiments (CITATIONA–H), CML9 and CML8 were not or only very weakly able to interact with CNGC20, confirming the results from the YTH assay. Virtually no yellow fluorescence was observed after co-expression of CNGC20–VN with VC alone (CITATIONI) or with bZIP63–VC (CITATIONK), a transcription factor expected to localize to the nucleus (CITATION). Fig. 6CNGC20 interacts with CaM at the plasma membrane. (A–L) Images of BiFC signals (yellow, middle column) and propidium iodide (PI) staining (red, right column) in tobacco epidermal cells after co-expression of CNGC20 fused to the N-terminal part of Venus (VN) and the interaction partners fused to the C-terminal part of Venus (VC). Co-expression partners for each experiment are depicted in the left column. Bars represent 75 µm. Vector containing VC only (I) and bZIP63–VC (K) were used as negative controls. For comparison of the BiFC signal intensities, corresponding images were taken with the same laser intensities, photomultiplier settings and magnification, and were equally processed.

Insets show the same images adjusted with different tonal values, brightness and contrast, in order to enhance the low signal intensities. In order to verify the interaction of the isolated C-terminus of CNGC20 and CaM in vivo, we conducted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, using only the C-terminal part of the channel (CNGC20-C). A BiFC signal was induced in the presence of CNGC20-C–VN and VC–CaM2 (CITATIONA), which was weak in the presence of VC–CML8 (CITATIONC) and virtually absent in the presence of VC–CML9 (CITATIONF). This confirms the specificity of the interaction between CNGC20 and CaM. Interestingly, the proteins interacted mainly in the nucleus rather than in the cytosol (CITATIONA, CITATION). Since CaM2 was localized in the nucleus and in the cytosol (CITATIONF), the question arose as to why the interaction with CNGC20-C was restricted to the nucleus. Fig. 7The C-terminus of CNGC20 interacts with CaM in the nucleus. Layout and experimental set-up as described in CITATION. BiFC signals indicate the interaction between the C-terminus and CaM2 in the nucleus (A, D). (C–E) Co-expression partners as in (A) were used and corresponding images for bright field (C, trimmed width), BiFC signals (D) and PI staining (E) are shown at a higher magnification, where the nucleus is clearly detectable in each image.

Bars represent 75 µm, and in (C–E) 20 µm. To monitor the cellular localization of the isolated C-terminal fragment of CNGC20 used before, we fused it N-terminally to GFP (CNGC20-C–GFP). CNGC20-C–GFP accumulated in the nucleus rather than in the cytosol of mesophyll protoplasts and epidermal cells (CITATIONA–D). A nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the type [YFW]RRRR[PL] is present within the IQ domain of the CNGC20 C-terminus (CITATION). We therefore substituted the first three of four arginine residues within the NLS, and the resulting mutant CNGC20-CAAA–GFP was analysed for its localization. Indeed, the absence of the NLS prevented nuclear accumulation of CNGC20-CAAA–GFP, as concluded from the GFP fluorescence equilibrating between the nucleus and the cytosol (CITATIONE, CITATION). This shows that CNGC20 exhibits a functional NLS, which is part of the IQ domain. However, the NLS was not required for the targeting of the full-length channel, since GFP fusion proteins of CNGC20 lacking the IQ/NLS domain (CNGC20-ΔC34) reached the plasma membrane (CITATIONG).

Together, our results identified two functional domains downstream of the CNBD (CITATION), an IQ domain, which binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and an embedded NLS, whose function for the full-length channel remains unclear.

!~MM~! Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) was grown on soil in the green house. For transient expression in leaves of 6- to 8-week-old N. benthamiana (CITATION, CITATION), Agrobacterium strain C58C1 carrying the plasmid of interest and the helper strain p19 were grown overnight in YEB medium (0.5% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sucrose, 50 mM MgSO4, pH 7.8) at 29°C. Cells were harvested and resuspended to an OD600 of 1 in infiltration buffer [10 mM MES, pH 5.7 (KOH), 10 mM MgCl2, 100 µM acetosyringone]. The Agrobacterium C58C1 suspension was mixed with 1 vol. of the p19 helper strain (CITATION), incubated for 3 h and injected into the abaxial side of tobacco leaves. For co-expression of two proteins, the plasmid-carrying agrobacteria were mixed in equal amounts before addition of the p19 helper strain. Gateway-compatible PCR products of CNGC20 (At3g17700), CaM2 (At2g41110), CaM4 (At1g66410), CaM6 (At5g21274), CaM7 (At3g43810), CML8 (At4g14640) and CML9 (At3g51920) were produced using primers 1–27 listed in Supplementary Table S2 and ligated into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). CaM2/pENTR/SD/D-TOPO (U17248) was ordered from the ABRC stock center. These genes were integrated into gateway destination vectors using LR clonase (Invitrogen). For YTH studies, the constucts used as bait were recombined into pGBT9-GW and prey constructs into pGAD424-GW, kindly provided by F. Börnke, Erlangen University. pVYNE, pVYNE(R) and pVYCE(R) (CITATION) were used for BiFC assays. For N-terminal GFP fusions, the pMDC43 destination vector was used (CITATION). A C-terminal GFP fusion was achieved using the destination vector pK7FWG2,0 (CITATION). For C-terminal mCherry fusions, pMDC201-mCherry was produced by a replacement of GFP by mCherry. mCherry was kindly provided by R. Stadler (Erlangen Universiy). Restriction sites AscI and BstBI were added to mCherry by an amplification using primers 28 and 29 (Supplementary Table S2) and the digested fragment was used to substitute the GFP in pMDC201 (CITATION). For a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion to the CNGC20 C- terminus, the latter was amplified with primers 30 and 31 and introduced into pMal-c2x (New England Biolabs) via XmnI and HindIII. Strep-CaM2 fusion was generated by an amplification of CaM2 with primers 32 and 33 and cloning into pASK-IBA5plus (IBA BioTAGnology) via BamHI and PstI. For insertion of a mutation into the NLS, primers 34 and 35 and the Quick Change II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions. The CNGC20 variants were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBT9-GW. CaMs and CMLs were cloned into the pGAD424-GW vector for a fusion with the GAL4 activation domain. All constructs were produced using the gateway cloning strategy (Invitrogen). Gateway-compatible YTH vectors were kindly provided by F. Börnke (Erlangen University). The yeast strain AH109 (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) was co-transformed with pairs of each combination of pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors, and also with empty vectors, and selected for co-transformed cells on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine (–W, –L). Transformed cells were grown in liquid selection media (–W, –L), adjusted to an OD600 of 2, 0.2 and 0.02, and 5 µl of each concentration were spotted on selection plates with (–W, –L) and without histidine (–W, –L, –H). Plates were grown at 29°C for 3 d. o-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assays were performed following the Clontech protocol. The following CNGC20 fragments were used in YTH assays: CNGC20-C (corresponding to CNGC20517–764); CNGC20-C-ΔC63 (CNGC20517–701); CNGC20-C-ΔC34 (CNGC20517–730); CNGC20-CC (CNGC20730–764); CNGC20-αBC (CNGC20698–731); CNGC20-αC (CNGC20713–736); and CNGC20-IQ (CNGC20737–752). Strep-CaM2 was expressed in Escherichia coli SoluBL21 cells (AMS Biotechnology) by 4 h induction with 1 µg ml–1 doxycycline at 37°C in the dark. The Strep-CaM2 protein was purified using a StrepTactin column (IBA BioTAGnology), following the instructions of the manufacturer. Escherichia coli SoluBL21 cells were transformed with pMAL-c2x harboring MBP-CNGC20-C, and protein expression was induced by 2 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37°C for 3 h. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, followed by transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was cut in two halves, each containing MBP–CNGC20-C. The membranes were blocked with buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg ml–1 bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween-20) containing either 5 mM Ca2+ or 5 mM EGTA for 30 min. For CaM binding, the membranes were incubated with purified Strep-CaM2 diluted in the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.1 µg ml–1. After washing in the above buffer, the membranes were incubated overnight with an anti-Strep antibody (IBA BioTAGnology), diluted 1 : 2,500 in the above buffer. CaM2 binding was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and the Lumi-Light western blotting kit (Roche). Gateway-compatible plasmids for BiFC analysis were kindly provided by Jörg Kudla (University of Muenster). For a BiFC assay, agrobacteria harboring plasmids with Venus N- and C-terminal fusions were mixed 1 : 1 before an equal amount of p19 was added to the suspension. At 2–3 d following infiltration of agrobacteria into tobacco, leaf discs were prepared for microscopic analysis. To compare fluorescence intensity between samples, these pictures were taken with the same laser intensities, photomultiplier settings and at the same magnification. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP II; Leica Microsystems) was used with laser excitation at 488 nm for GFP, mCherry and propidium iodide (PI), and at 514 nm for Venus. Detection windows were set from 500 to 540 nm for GFP, from 530 to 550 nm for Venus, from 650 to 770 nm for mCherry and from 615 to 665 nm for PI. Cell walls were stained with PI for about 15 min and washed with water prior to confocal fluorescence imaging.
