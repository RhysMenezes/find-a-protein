!~ABS~! Recent studies have shown that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors can have a tremendous impact on cell cycle progression in plants. In animals, CDK inhibitors are tightly regulated, especially by posttranslational mechanisms of which control of nuclear access and regulation of protein turnover are particularly important. Here we address the posttranslational regulation of INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDK 1 (ICK1)/KIP RELATED PROTEIN 1 (KRP1), an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CDK inhibitor. We show that ICK1/KRP1 exerts its function in the nucleus and its presence in the nucleus is controlled by multiple nuclear localization signals as well as by nuclear export. In addition, we show that ICK1/KRP1 localizes to different subnuclear domains, i.e. in the nucleoplasm and to the chromocenters, hinting at specific actions within the nuclear compartment. Localization to the chromocenters is mediated by an N-terminal domain, in addition we find that this domain may be involved in cyclin binding. Further we demonstrate that ICK1/KRP1 is an unstable protein and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the nucleus. This degradation is mediated by at least two domains indicating the presence of at least two different pathways impinging on ICK1/KRP1 protein stability.
!~RES~! To understand how the subcellular localization and function of ICK1/KRP1 are regulated, we first searched for sequence motifs present in its open reading frame. Previously, putative NLS had been identified based on sequence comparisons only for ICK2/KRP2, KRP4, KRP5, and KRP7 (CITATION). Searching the PredictNLS server (http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictNLS/; CITATION) we retrieved a putative NLS spanning residues 80 to 87 in ICK1/KRP1 (Table I ). To test the functionality of this predicted NLS, two pairs of conserved Lys and/or Arg residues were replaced by Ala to create two different constructs with mutant NLS (Table I). Next, transgenic plants were generated expressing a fusion of the YFP with each of these two ICK1/KRP1 mutant proteins under the control of the trichome-directed GL2 promoter. We have previously shown that full-length ICK1/KRP1 fused to YFP gives rise to an exclusively nuclear fluorescent signal (Figs. 1 and 2A ; CITATION). Predicted NLS in ICK1/KRP1 and here generated mutant variants [KR], K or R; [KR]{2,3}, between 2 and 3 Ks or Rs; x, any amino acid. PredictNLS server is at http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictNLS/. Amino acid sequence present in ICK1/KRP1 that shows similarity to the predicted NLS sequence is given in bold face. Amino acid residues that have been mutated to interfere with the NLS are underlined. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The two mutations placed in the putative NLS affected to varying degrees the nuclear localization of ICK1/KRP1. YFP fusion proteins with the mutated ICK1/KRP1R80/81A predominantly localized in the nucleus although some fluorescence could be detected in the cytoplasm in a number of trichomes in a few transgenic lines, indicating that nuclear transport was only slightly affected (Figs. 1 and 2, B and C). In contrast, fusions with the KRP1K84/86A occurred in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in all transgenic lines analyzed, demonstrating the presence of a functional NLS between the amino acid residues K80 and L87 (Fig. 2D; Table I). Since a major fraction of the fusion protein still localized to the nucleus in plants expressing YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A, we searched the ICK1/KRP1 sequence for another motif that could be responsible for nuclear import. We have previously shown that YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 and also a β-glucuronidase (GUS):YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 fusion protein with a mass of about 105 kD were still able to enter the nucleus (Figs. 1 and 2, E and F; CITATION). Since the threshold for passive entry into the nucleus is about 50 kD (CITATION; CITATION), one conclusion from this experiment is that, besides the NLS at positions 80 to 87, a second NLS is present in the C-terminal part of ICK1/KRP1, i.e. between residues 109 and 191. To further characterize this NLS, we generated plants expressing the ICK1/KRP1 residues 109 to 152 combined with a GUS:YFP fusion (Fig. 1). This fusion protein was solely detectable in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2G), suggesting that a second signal resides between residues 152 and 191, where the cyclin- and the CDK-interaction domains of ICK1/KRP1 are also situated. Since no NLS could be identified with various prediction tools in this part of the protein, one explanation could be that ICK1/KRP1 binds to a CDK-cyclin complex in the cytoplasm and travels piggyback with this complex into the nucleus. To explore such a cotransport mechanism further, we investigated in which cell compartment ICK1/KRP1 might interact with a CDK-cyclin complex by using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technique (also called split YFP assay; CITATION). As an interacting partner of ICK1/KRP1 we chose CDKA;1. CDKA;1 fused to a complete YFP is able to rescue the cdka;1 mutant phenotype (M. Nowack, N. Dissmeyer, and A. Schnittger, unpublished data). Consistent with previous studies on functional green fluorescent protein (GFP):CDKA;1 fusions, CDKA;1 fused to the complete YFP was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A ; CITATION). Interaction of CDKA;1 with ICK1/KRP1 in the BiFC assays was only detectable in nuclei, in agreement with the strong nuclear localization signal of ICK1/KRP1 identified above (Fig. 3B). However, the two mutant ICK/KRP versions, ICK1/KRP1109–191 and ICK1/KRP1K84/86A, were found to bind to CDKA;1 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, consistent with a cotransport of ICK1/KRP1 with a CDK-cyclin complex from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Fig. 3, C and D). [[FIGURE]] Next we asked whether the different localization patterns of ICK1/KRP1 protein variants are dependent on the cell cycle program or the developmental background. Previously, a different response was observed upon ICK1/KRP1 expression in dividing cells of the stomata lineage and in endoreplicating trichomes (CITATION). Therefore, we generated transgenic plants expressing all generated ICK1/KRP1 mutants from the TOO MANY MOUTH (TMM) promoter that is active in cells of the stomata lineage of which most are still dividing (Supplemental Fig. 1A; CITATION). Production of YFP:ICK1/KRP1R80/81A from the TMM promoter also resulted in predominantly nuclear localization of the fusion protein and production of YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A again gave rise to both nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence. The YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 and GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 fusion proteins were also found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas a GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–152 fusion protein driven from the TMM promoter was excluded from the nucleus (Supplemental Fig. 1, B–H). Similar results were also obtained by transient expression of the above mentioned fusion constructs in Arabidopsis leaves under the control of the ubiquitous 35S promoter (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the nuclear localization of ICK1/KRP1 is independent of the cellular setting. Finally, we addressed whether the altered subcellular localization also results in an altered protein function. Plants producing the GUS:YFP:ICK/KRP1109–152 fusion protein under the control of the GL2 or the TMM promoter had a trichome and leaf morphology identical to that of wild-type plants (data not shown). These data are consistent with previous experiments in which the expression of a mutant ICK1/KRP11–152 allele lacking the cyclin and the CDK interaction domain (amino acids 152–191) did not alter the typical trichome morphology of three to four branches (CITATION). In contrast, plants expressing YFP:ICK1/KRP1R80/81A or YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A under the control of the GL2 promoter generally displayed the previously described ICK1/KRP1 misexpression phenotype with smaller and less branched trichomes (CITATION; Table II ; data not shown). However, the phenotype of the NLS mutated YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A misexpression lines was significantly weaker (χ2 test, P ≤ 0.001) than that of the nonmutated YFP:ICK1/KRP1 lines; the weaker phenotype can best be seen in the distribution of the three-branched trichomes: approximately 42% of trichomes with only three branches in the ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A lines versus approximately 16% in ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1 (Table II). This shows that a compromised nuclear import reduces ICK1/KRP1 action and suggests that its targets reside in the nucleus. Trichome branch numbers To explore the function of the N-terminal part of ICK1/KRP1 further, plants were generated that expressed C- and N-terminal fusions of YFP to the first 108 amino acids of ICK1/KRP1 under control of the GL2 promoter (Fig. 1). Since this N-terminal part of the ICK1/KRP1 protein harbors the above identified NLS, we expected to find YFP fluorescence in the nucleus. Indeed, only a nuclear YFP signal was detected for both constructs (Fig. 2H; data not shown). Interestingly, YFP fluorescence showed a specific subnuclear localization pattern. The full-length ICK1/KRP1 protein fused to YFP is absent from the nucleolus but otherwise accumulates uniformly in the nucleus (Figs. 2A and 4A ). In contrast, both ICK1/KRP11–108:YFP and YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108 displayed a punctuate localization in the nucleus (Fig. 4B; data not shown). Simultaneous staining with the DNA-specific dye 4′,6-diamino-phenylindole (DAPI) showed that the YFP signal completely overlaps with areas of high DNA compaction, the so-called chromocenters (Fig. 4, C and D). This localization pattern could be a unique property of the N terminus of ICK1/KRP1. Alternatively, the full-length protein might have different subnuclear localization domains and may accumulate in the nucleoplasm so strongly that other more subtle localization patterns are obscured. To discriminate between these two scenarios, we analyzed in detail the subnuclear localization pattern of the full-length ICK1/KRP1 in all cells targeted by our expression constructs, i.e. stomata cells, hypocotyl cells, and root cells. Indeed, we found a few cells in which the full-length fusion protein showed the same punctuate localization pattern within the nucleus (Fig. 4, E and F). Intriguingly, this association of the full-length fusion protein with chromocenters was only found in a few dividing cells and never in endoreplicating trichome cells, suggesting that the subnuclear localization depends on the cell cycle program and/or cell cycle phase. [[FIGURE]] Next, ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108 and ProGL2:ICK1/KRP11–108:YFP plants were analyzed for their phenotypes. Both transgenic lines displayed trichomes of similar size and branch number in comparison to wild-type plants (Table II; data not shown). To explore a possible function of the N-terminal part of ICK1/KRP1 we crossed plants expressing ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108 and ProGL2:ICK1/KRP11–108:YFP to various other trichome mutants and misexpression lines. Remarkably, when we combined plants expressing ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108 with plants expressing ProGL2:ICK1/KRP1, the KRP-misexpression phenotype was slightly reduced (Table II). In control crosses of the ProGL2:ICK1/KRP1 misexpressing plants with plants expressing ProGL2:NLS:GFP:GUS no phenotypic reduction could be observed (Table II). However, the reduction of the KRP-misexpression phenotype could only be seen in crosses with plants expressing the full-length ICK1/KRP1 protein and not the truncated ICK1/KRP1109–191(Table II). One possible explanation for this finding is that the N-terminal part of ICK1/KRP1 might function as an intramolecular inhibitor and binds to itself. Intramolecular inhibitory domains have been identified in a number of proteins, for instance in caspases that only become active after a prodomain has been cleaved off (CITATION). However, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid interaction assays did neither reveal interactions of the full-length protein ICK1/KRP1 with itself nor with the N-terminal part ICK1/KRP11–108 (data not shown). Another possible explanation is that the N terminus of ICK1/KRP1 is involved in substrate binding. If so, the expression of only the N terminus may compete with binding of the ICK1/KRP1 full-length protein to the targets and thus reduce the phenotype of ICK1/KRP1 misexpression. To test this, we analyzed the interaction of ICK1/KRP1, ICK1/KRP11–152, and ICK1/KRP11–108 with CDKA;1 and CYCLIN D3;1 (CYCD3;1) in a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system. Consistent with previous experiments reported by CITATION we also observed in this yeast assay that the full-length ICK1/KRP1 protein interacted with CDKA;1, whereas ICK1/KRP11–152 did not bind to CDKA;1 (CITATION); in addition, we found that ICK1/KRP11–108 did not interact with CDKA;1. In contrast to this previous study, we found that not only the full-length ICK1/KRP1 interacted with CYCD3;1 but also ICK1/KRP11–152 and remarkably ICK1/KRP11–108 (Fig. 5 ). This suggests that in addition to the previously identified cyclin- and CDK-binding domain between the amino acids 152 and 191, the N terminus also harbors a cyclin-binding site. [[FIGURE]] Since presence in the nucleus seems to be crucial for ICK1/KRP1 function, we wondered whether ICK1/KRP1 is also controlled by active nuclear export similar to animal CDK inhibitors (CITATION). First, full-length ICK1/KRP1 and ICK1/KRP1109–191 were tested for interaction with the Arabidopsis nuclear export receptor EXPORTIN 1 (XPO1) in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. As positive controls we used a fragment of the HIV Rev protein containing a nuclear export signal and the Arabidopsis protein At5g23405 that has recently been shown to interact with XPO1 (CITATION; CITATION). While the full-length protein did not interact, we could detect a weak but significant interaction for ICK1/KRP1109–191 with XPO1 (Fig. 6A ). Conversely, no interaction of XPO1 with the N-terminal 108 amino acids of ICK1/KRP1 could be observed (Fig. 6A). To examine a possible regulation of ICK1/KRP1 by nuclear export we transfected tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright-Yellow 2 protoplasts with Pro35S:YFP, Pro35S:YFP:ICK1/KRP1R80/81A, Pro35S:YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A, Pro35S:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191, and Pro35S:GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 and treated them with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). In all experiments the Pro35S:YFP control did not display an altered subcellular localization pattern after LMB treatment (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, ICK1/KRP1 exhibited sensitivity to LMB. The effect was visible for all constructs tested but most pronounced in protoplasts transfected with Pro35S:GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 (Fig. 6, D and E). Here, the fraction of cells with a nuclear fluorescence equal to or stronger than their cytoplasmic fluorescence increased from 14% in untreated protoplasts to 57% after treatment with LMB (Fig. 6F). Thus, we conclude that the plant CDK inhibitor ICK1/KRP1 can also be subject to nuclear export. [[FIGURE]] After seeing that ICK1/KRP1 can be regulated by nuclear import and export, we next asked whether this subcellular localization is linked to protein turnover. Previous studies suggested that ICK1/KRP1 might be an unstable protein that could be regulated by protein degradation (CITATION; CITATION). In particular, the accumulation of ICK1/KRP1109–191 protein in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus gave rise to the hypothesis that ICK1/KRP1 might be degraded in the cytoplasm mediated by a motif in the N-terminal region. To test this hypothesis, we blocked the 26S proteasome with the drug MG132 in plants expressing ICK1/KRP1. Since the Arabidopsis root is readily accessible to the application of drugs and the GL2 promoter is also active in roots we chose to use the root system to address the control of ICK1/KRP1 by protein degradation. First we attempted to detect a possible accumulation of YFP-tagged ICK1/KRP1 after treatment with MG132 by using an antibody against GFP that also recognizes YFP. However, ICK/KRPs appear to be low abundance proteins and consistent with previous experiments we were unable to detect a band for the full-length ICK1/KRP1 in protein extracts from Arabidopsis root in western blots (data not shown). We therefore explored the possibility to quantify fluorescence signals in planta as a more sensitive detection assay. As controls we used previously generated plants expressing ProCPC:SV40NLS:2xGFP or ProGL2:NLS:GFP:GUS (CITATION; CITATION). Both reporter lines showed no altered expression of the fusion proteins after application of MG132 (Fig. 7, A and B ). To obtain a positive control, we fused YFP to the destruction box of the mitotic cyclin CYCLIN B1;1 that mediates anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-dependent degradation via the 26S proteasome (CITATION; CITATION). This construct was expressed under the control of the CDKA;1 promoter that has been shown to rescue a cdka;1 mutant when driving the CDKA;1 cDNA (CITATION). The CDKA;1 promoter is active in all cells competent to undergo cell cycle progression (M. Nowack, N. Dissmeyer, and A. Schnittger, unpublished data). After treating roots of ProCDKA;1:YFP:DB expressing plants with MG132 we observed a strong increase in nuclear fluorescence of many root cells (Fig. 7, C and D). [[FIGURE]] Next, we treated the roots of different lines misexpressing the various ICK1/KRP1 mutant versions with MG132 or solvent only (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) for 3 h and quantified nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence. Plants expressing ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1 displayed a stronger YFP signal in the nucleus after MG132 treatment (Fig. 7, E and F); notably, no cytoplasmic accumulation of YFP fluorescence was found. Nuclear accumulation of the fusion proteins was confirmed by quantifying fluorescence intensities (Fig. 7, K and L). Whereas the fluorescence in the negative controls, ProCPC:SV40NLS:2xGFP and ProGL2:NLS:GFP:GUS expressing plants, increased only by 1.5%, in YFP:ICK1/KRP1 expressing plants the signal increased by 45% in roots treated with MG132 (Fig. 7, K and L). To address whether or not the N terminus is involved in the degradation of ICK1/KRP1, we next applied MG132 to roots of plants producing ICK1/KRP1109–191 and ICK1/KRP11–108 fused to YFP. For plants producing YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 we also found accumulation of nuclear fluorescence after MG132 treatment (Fig. 7, G and H). Even though this enhancement was much weaker than in lines producing the full-length YFP:ICK1/KRP1, with an increase in fluorescence intensity of only 13.6%, it was statistically significantly different from DMSO-treated roots of the same line (t test, P ≤ 0.001). Remarkably, no significant cytoplasmic accumulation could be found (3.7%; t test, P = 0.7957; Fig. 7, K and L). In contrast, YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108 strongly accumulated in nuclei upon MG132 treatment, leading to a 42.6% increase in fluorescence intensity, similar to the full-length YFP:ICK1/KRP1 protein (Fig. 7, I–L). Taken together, these results provide evidence for ICK1/KRP1 degradation in the nucleus being facilitated by the first 108 amino acids in ICK1/KRP1. However, the observation that ICK1/KRP1109–191 also accumulated after MG132 treatment suggests that multiple degradation signals are present in ICK1/KRP1.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 h of light, 8 h of darkness) between 18°C and 25°C under standard greenhouse conditions. The Arabidopsis accessions Landsberg erecta and Columbia-0 were used as wild-type controls. At least 20 transgenic plants were generated for all expression constructs. A number of representative reference lines displaying a typical phenotype were chosen for further analysis. The same transgenic reference line was used for all data obtained for one expression construct. For ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1R80/81A, ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A, ProTMM:YFP:ICK1/KRP1R80/81A, and ProTMM:YFP:ICK1/KRP1K84/86A, approximately 50% of the approximately 100 primary transformants resembled the ICK1/KRP1 misexpression phenotype. T2 plants were tested for segregation and used for analysis. ProGL2:ICK1/KRP11–108:YFP, ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108, ProTMM:YFP:ICK1/KRP1, ProTMM:ICK1/KRP11–108:YFP, ProTMM:YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108, ProTMM:GFP5ER, and ProCDKA;1:YFP:DB expressing T2 plants were tested for segregation and homozygous T3 plants were established and analyzed. More than 100 T1 transgenic plants of ProGL2:GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–152 and ProTMM:GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–152 were generated, analyzed for their phenotype, and for each construct at least 10 lines were checked for their YFP localization. The ProGL2:ICK1/KRP1, ProGL2:ICK1/KRP1109–191, ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1, ProGL2:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191, ProGL2:GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191, ProGL2:NLS:GFP:GUS, ProTMM:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191, and ProCPC:SV40NLS:2xGFP expression lines have been described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Plants were transformed by a modified version of the floral dipping method according to CITATION. Flower buds were submerged for approximately 10 s in 500 mL Agrobacterium tumefaciens overnight culture to which 25 g Suc and 100 μL Silwet L-77 had been added. Plants were kept under a plastic cover overnight and then allowed to grow under standard greenhouse conditions. For crosses between transgenic lines homozygous T3 plants were used and the F1 generation was analyzed. For analysis of roots, Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with chlorine gas overnight and grown in liquid culture medium (one-half Murashige and Skoog, 1% Suc) with rotation (50 rpm) for 5 d. All primer sequences used for cloning are listed in Supplemental Table I. To achieve expression in plants, the previously described plant transformation vectors pAM-PAT-GWPro35S (GenBank AY436765), pAM-PAT-GWProGL2, and pAM-PAT-GWProTMM were used (CITATION). To generate ICK1/KRP11–108:YFP and YFP:ICK1/KRP11–108 fusion constructs, gene-specific primers C-ICK_108-S and C-ICK_108-AS were used for the cDNAs of ICK1/KRP1 and primers C-YFP_108-AS and C-YFP_108-S were used for EYFP-N1 (CLONTECH), and a two-step PCR was performed. The upper primers contained a BamHI and the lower primers a SacI recognition site. After the second PCR step the obtained fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), sequenced, and transferred via BamHI and SacI into a modified pENTR1A vector (Invitrogen) containing a SacI restriction site in its MCS. Thereafter a recombination into the respective plant transformation vector was performed using Gateway LR Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen). The putative NLS in ICK1/KRP1 was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For the exchange of R80 and R81 to A, primers krpR8081Ar and krpR8081Af were used, for the exchange of K84 and K86 to A, krpK8486Ar and krpK8486Af were used with pENTR1a:YFP:ICK1/KRP1 (CITATION) as a template following the manufacturer's recommendations. The fusion construct GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–152 was amplified as a subfragment from GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP1109–191 (CITATION) with an attB1 GUS primer and attB2_krp1_152 and cloned into pDONR201. For the construction of the Gateway compatible BiFC plant expression vector pSYN and the minimal promoter and GUS gene of pATGUS, a BASTA-resistant derivative of pPAM (GenBank AY027531), were deleted by digestion with SapI/SacI and replaced with the 35S promoter, the Gateway cassette, a Myc tag, and the N-terminal part of YFP1–155 of pUC-SPYNEG (CITATION). For pSYC the 35S minimal promoter and the Gateway cassette of pBENDER, a kanamycin-resistant derivative of pPAM were excised by digestion with SdaI/AvaIII and replaced with the 35S promoter, the Gateway cassette, the HA-tag, and the C-terminal part of YFP156–239 of pUC-SPYCEG (CITATION). To introduce ICK1/KRP1, ICK1/KRP1109–191, ICK1/KRP1K84/86A, and CDKA;1 into the Split-Ubiquitin assay vectors (pMet and pNuI) as well as into the BiFC assay vectors (pSYN and pSYC) STOP codons of the respective cDNAs had to be removed. The cDNAs were amplified via PCR using the following primers: AttB1-KRP1 and AttB2-KRP1 on the pENTR1a:YFP:ICK1/KRP1 template, primers AttB1-KRP1 109 to 191 and AttB2-KRP1 on the pENTR1a:YFP:ICK1/KRP1 template, primers AttB1-KRP1and AttB2-KRP1 on the pENTR1a:YFP:ICK1/ KRP1K84/86A template, primers AttB1-CDKA1 and AttB2-CDKA1 on the CDKA;1 cDNA (CITATION), and primers AttB1-CYCD3,1 and AttB2-CYCD3,1 on the CYCD3;1 cDNA template (pART61; CITATION). To generate the CDKA;1:YFP fusion construct, gene-specific primers ss_attB1:CDKcoreN and as_CDKcoreC:YFPovlpN were used on the CDKA;1 cDNA and primers ss_YFPcoreN:CDKovlpC and as_YFPcoreC:attB2 were used for EYFP-N1 and a two-step PCR was performed. The fusion construct was cloned into pDONR201 via a Gateway BP reaction, sequenced, and transferred into pAM-PATGW-ProCDKA;1 (CITATION). Five-day-old seedlings grown in liquid medium were treated with 50 μg/mL MG132 (Sigma and Biomol; dissolved to 50 mg/mL in DMSO) or with 0.1% DMSO alone as control. Whole seedlings were submersed in media and incubated for 3 h at 20°C in the light. Fluorescence intensity measurements were performed on CLSM image stacks using Leica LCSlite 2.0 (Leica Microsystems) and Amira 3.1.1 (Mercury Computer Systems) software. For infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 pMP90RK was used. The Agrobacterium strains containing the BiFC vectors were infiltrated as described (CITATION). Infiltration was always performed on the abaxial leaf side of 2-month-old tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants and analyzed 3 to 5 d later. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assays were performed as described in CITATION. Yeast strain EGY48[p8op-lacZ] was transformed with pGilda bait and pB42AD prey plasmids (CLONTECH), and interactions were tested on induction plates containing X-gal (5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids pGilda-XPO1 and pB42AD-NLS-CHS-NESRev containing the nuclear export signal of the HIV Rev protein as a positive control have been described in CITATION. The prey vectors were constructed by recombining pDONR vectors containing the cDNA fragments of ICK1/KRP1, ICK1/KRP11-108, and ICK1/KRP1109-191 into pB42AD-GWY. This vector was constructed by digestion of pB42AD with EcoRI and treatment with Klenow fragment. After ligation of the rfB Gateway cassette into the opened vector, in-frame insertion was verified by sequencing. The yeast strains used were JD53 and YM4271. The bait vector pMet (a kind gift of Laurent Deslandes and Imre E. Somssich) was transformed into JD53, the prey vector pNuI (a kind gift of Laurent Deslandes and Imre E. Somssich) into YM4271. After transformation yeast cells were streaked out on synthetic drop-out (SD) medium. The strains were mated (Mata:Matα, 2,5: 1) in YPAD (YPD plus adenine) medium for 3 h and plated on SD. A dilution series of the yeast strains starting with an OD600 of 1 (approximately 105 cells) were plated onto SD plates for growth control, on SD without uracil supplemented with 100 μm copper sulfate, and on SD supplemented with 1 mg/mL 5-FOA and 100 μm copper sulfate. Yeast cells were grown at 30°C for 3 d. Protoplasts were prepared from dark-grown tobacco Bright-Yellow 2 cells and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids by polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection as described previously (CITATION). Analysis of the localization of the YFP fusion proteins was performed using both fluorescence and laser-scanning microscopy in three independent experiments, representing approximately 60 to 80 transfected protoplasts. The effect of LMB on the localization of the GUS:YFP fusion containing ICK1/KRP1109–191 was analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy in transfected Bright-Yellow 2 protoplasts that were incubated with 0.5 μm LMB for 1 h versus mock-treated protoplasts. Protoplasts in either sample were grouped into two categories according to the localization of the GUS:YFP fusion protein. Protoplasts grouped in category N ≤ C showed an approximately equal distribution of the GUS:YFP fusion protein between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas protoplasts of category N > C showed a clearly higher YFP fluorescence in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. In this way, the effect of LMB on the localization of the GUS:YFP:ICK1/KRP109–191 fusion protein could be assessed by comparison of the percentage of protoplasts grouped into the two categories. Light microscopy was performed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss) or a Leica DM RA2 microscope (Leica) equipped with differential interference contrast (Nomarski) and epifluorescence optics using a JVC 3CCD camera. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS CLSM system equipped with an argon-krypton laser and a 405 nm diode laser (Leica) or a Zeiss LSM 510 META equipped with an argon-krypton laser (Zeiss). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS 8.0, Adobe Illustrator CS 11.0, and ImageJ 1.36 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).
