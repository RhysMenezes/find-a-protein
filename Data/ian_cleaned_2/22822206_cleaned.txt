!~ABS~! Transcriptional regulation plays a central role in plant hormone signaling. At the core of transcriptional regulation is the Mediator, an evolutionarily conserved, multisubunit complex that serves as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase machinery to regulate transcription. Here, we report the action mechanisms of the MEDIATOR25 (MED25) subunit of the Arabidopsis thaliana Mediator in regulating jasmonate- and abscisic acid (ABA)–triggered gene transcription. We show that during jasmonate signaling, MED25 physically associates with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2 in promoter regions of MYC2 target genes and exerts a positive effect on MYC2-regulated gene transcription. We also show that MED25 physically associates with the basic Leu zipper transcription factor ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) in promoter regions of ABI5 target genes and shows a negative effect on ABI5-regulated gene transcription. Our results reveal that underlying the distinct effects of MED25 on jasmonate and ABA signaling, the interaction mechanisms of MED25 with MYC2 and ABI5 are different. These results highlight that the MED25 subunit of the Arabidopsis Mediator regulates a wide range of signaling pathways through selectively interacting with specific transcription factors.
!~RES~! The bestatin-resistant6 (ber6) line of Arabidopsis was identified as a JA-insensitive mutant in JA-induced root growth inhibition (CITATION). Our further characterization of ber6 was performed with a homozygous line obtained from five successive backcrosses of the original mutant to the wild type Columbia-0 (Col-0). JA response assays with this line showed that ber6 was generally less sensitive than the wild type to the inhibition effect of a range of concentrations of JA on root growth (Figure 1A). We then examined whether the expression of JA-responsive genes is affected in ber6 plants. Two distinct branches of JA-responsive genes that are differentially regulated by the transcription factor MYC2 were identified in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION). One of these branches, including the VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN1 (VSP1) gene (CITATION), is believed to be involved in plant responses to wounding. The other branch, including the plant defensin gene PDF1.2 (CITATION), is considered to be associated with plant responses to pathogen infection (CITATION; CITATION). Promoter-reporter fusion assays revealed that the ber6 mutation substantially impaired JA-induced expression of both VSP1pro:GUS (for β-glucuronidase) and PDF1.2pro:LUC (for luciferase) (Figures 1B and 1C). Consistent with this, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays showed that the JA-induced expression levels of VSP1 (Figure 1D) and PDF1.2 (Figure 1E) were markedly reduced in ber6 compared with those in the wild type. Next, we examined the response of ber6 plants to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000. As measured by leaf symptoms (Figure 1F) and pathogen growth (Figure 1G) of the infected plants, the effects of Pst DC3000 infection in ber6 are largely similar to those in the coi1-2 mutant, which harbors a point mutation of the JA receptor gene COI1 and therefore is resistant to Pst DC3000 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Together, our results support that ber6 is a JA signaling mutant that is defective in JA-induced defense gene expression. [[FIGURE]] The decreased JA-induced root growth inhibition of ber6 provides a facile assay for map-based cloning studies aimed at determining the genetic basis of this defect. Using a total of 1800 F2 plants showing the mutant phenotype, BER6 was delimited to a 50-kb region on the BAC clone F2J7 (Figure 1H). DNA sequencing revealed that ber6 contains a G-to-A transition at the junction between the fifth exon and the fifth intron of the annotated gene At1g25540 (Figure 1I), which encodes the MED25 subunit of the Arabidopsis Mediator (CITATION). The G-to-A mutation in ber6 destroys an RsaI restriction site, and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker was developed to detect the ber6 mutant allele (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). In the ber6 mutant, the 5′ exon-intron boundary of intron 5 is changed from GT to AT (Figure 1I), replacing a G that is highly conserved at plant gene splice sites. The mutation in ber6 altered the splicing of At1g25540 mRNA (see Supplemental Figure 1A online), resulting in a frame shift that destroys the von Willebrand Factor A (vWF-A) domain, which has been shown to be crucial for the binding of MED25 to the Mediator complex (CITATION). Protein gel analysis using anti-MED25 antibodies failed to detect MED25 protein accumulation in the ber6 mutant (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). For genetic complementation of the ber6 phenotype, the MED25 cDNA from the wild type was introduced into ber6 mutants under the control of the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus. The results showed that the MED25 cDNA complemented the ber6 mutant in JA-mediated root growth inhibition (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). These results support that the defective JA response phenotype of ber6 is resulted from the identified G-to-A mutation of MED25. Since several mutant alleles of the MED25 gene have been described (CITATION; CITATION), we henceforth designated the ber6 allele as med25-4. Further confirmation that BER6 encodes MED25 came from analyses of several reported mutant alleles of MED25 (Figure 1I). pft1-1, the original mutant allele of MED25 (CITATION), as well as the recently described alleles, including pft1-2 (CITATION), med25-1, med25-2, and med25-3 (CITATION), all displayed reduced sensitivity to JA in root growth inhibition (see Supplemental Figure 1E online). Genetic analyses showed that ber6/med25-4 and pft1-2 cannot complement each other in JA-induced root growth inhibition (see Supplemental Figure 1F online). In addition, ber6/med25-4 displayed a late flowering phenotype when grown under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark), as determined by rosette leaf number and bolting time (see Supplemental Figure 1G online). When grown under short-day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark), this mutant had similar rosette leaf number as the wild type but the bolting time showed a significant increase (see Supplemental Figure 1H online). Similar late flowering phenotype has also been observed in most of the reported mutant alleles of MED25 (CITATION; CITATION). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the med25 mutation we identified is responsible for the ber6 mutant phenotype. The MED25 protein contains a vWF-A domain (MED251-226), a nonconserved middle domain (MD; MED25227-550), an ACID domain (MED25551-680), and a Gln-rich domain (GD; MED25681-836) (Figure 1J). It is generally believed that the vWF-A domain is essential for the binding of MED25 to the Mediator complex, and the ACID domain is important for interaction with transcriptional activators, whereas the GD domain could be important for transcriptional activation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To elucidate the action mechanisms of MED25 in JA-mediated transcriptional regulation, we investigated the effect of MED25 on the function of MYC2, a master transcriptional regulator that controls diverse aspects of JA responses (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Toward this goal, we generated a double mutant line med25-4 myc2-2 and compared its JA responses with those of the single mutants in defense gene expression. Consistent with the well-recognized finding that MYC2 negatively regulates the expression of the branch of pathogen-responsive genes (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), our qRT-PCR assays indicated that JA-induced expression levels of PDF1.2 (Figure 2A) and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (ERF1; Figure 2B) were markedly increased in myc2-2 compared with those in the wild type. Importantly, JA-induced expression levels of these genes were strongly reduced in the med25-4 mutant (Figures 1E, 2A, and 2B), suggesting that MED25 is required for JA-induced expression of this group of genes. Significantly, in the med25-4 myc2-2 double mutant, JA-induced expression levels of PDF1.2 and ERF1 were essentially comparable to those in med25-4 (i.e., med25-4 suppressed the phenotype of myc2-2 in terms of JA-induced PDF1.2 and ERF1 expression) (Figures 2A and 2B), suggesting that MED25 acts genetically downstream of MYC2 in regulating the expression of these genes. Together, these results support that, in response to JA, MED25 is required for the MYC2 function to repress the expression of pathogen-responsive genes. Consistent with the positive role of MYC2 in regulating the expression of wound-responsive genes (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we found that the JA-induced expression levels of VSP1 (Figure 2C), LIPOXYGENASE2 (LOX2; Figure 2D), JAZ6 (Figure 2E), and JAZ8 (Figure 2F) were substantially reduced in myc2-2 mutants compared with those in wild-type plants (Figures 2C to 2F). JA-induced expression levels of these genes were also reduced in med25-4 (Figures 2C to 2F), suggesting that MED25 is also important for JA-induced expression of this group of genes. As expected, in the med25-4 myc2-2 double mutant, JA-induced expression levels of these genes were largely similar to those in med25-4 (Figures 2C to 2F), suggesting that MED25 is also important for the MYC2 function to activate the expression of these wound-responsive genes. Taken together, these results led us to the conclusion that, during JA response, MED25 exerts a positive effect on the function of the MYC2 transcription factor to regulate the expression of JA-responsive genes. [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that the human MED25, together with the retinoic acid (RA)–bound retinoic acid receptor (RAR), was recruited to the promoter regions of RA-responsive genes and therefore regulates the function of RAR (CITATION). In this context, we speculate that the Arabidopsis MED25 could associate with MYC2 in chromatin regions of MYC2 target genes. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed the effect of MED25 on the expression JA-responsive genes that are directly targeted by MYC2. It has been shown that in response to JA, MYC2 quickly activates the expression of the JAZ family genes via directly binding to the G-box (and T/G-box) sequence in the promoter of these genes (CITATION; CITATION). Our qRT-PCR assays revealed that the med25-4 mutation markedly reduced the JA-induced expression levels of the JAZ family genes (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using 35Spro:MYC2-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) plants and anti-GFP antibodies indicated that MYC2 associated with the G-box (5′-CACGTG-3′) motifs in the promoters of JAZ6 and JAZ8 (Figures 3A and 3B), confirming that JAZ6 and JAZ8 are direct targets of MYC2. ChIP assays using 35Spro:MED25-GFP plants indicated that, like MYC2, MED25 was also enriched in the G-box (5′-CACGTG-3′) motifs of JAZ6 and JAZ8 promoters, and, importantly, the enrichment of both MYC2 and MED25 was substantially enhanced by JA treatment (Figure 3B). These results demonstrate that MED25 associates with the transcription factor MYC2 in chromatin regions of MYC2 target genes. [[FIGURE]] To determine the recruitment dynamic of MYC2 and MED25 to JAZ promoters, 35Spro:MYC2-GFP and 35Spro:MED25-GFP plants were incubated with JA for varying lengths of time. ChIP assays indicated that low levels of MYC2 was recruited to JAZ6 promoter at steady state and that JA treatment leads to a marked increase of MYC2 recruitment within 15 min; MYC2 binding to JAZ6 promoter then remains at high levels during the time course investigated (Figure 3C). Parallel experiments revealed that MED25 shows negligible association with JAZ6 promoter at steady state (Figure 3D). In the presence of the ligand, however, MED25 recruitment was quickly increased and reached a maximum within 15 min after JA treatment (Figure 3D); MED25 binding then exhibited a tendency of reduction for the duration of the experiment (Figure 3D). Next, we examined whether the JAZ6 mRNA levels follow the recruitment pattern of MED25 to the promoter of JAZ6. As shown in Figure 3E, in wild-type plants, JAZ6 mRNA levels increased markedly at 15 min, peaked at 60 min, and then showed a tendency of decrease up to 180 min upon JA treatment. In JA-treated med25-4 plants, JAZ6 expression exhibited similar induction kinetics, albeit its expression levels are substantially reduced in med25-4 compared with those in wild-type plants (Figure 3E). These results indicate that the maximum recruitment of MED25 to the JAZ6 promoter occurs generally earlier than the peaked activation of JAZ6 expression. This scenario is consistent with a previous observation in mammalian system showing that Mediator and other coactivators are targeted to a promoter before significant gene activation occurs (CITATION). It has been shown that the MED25 counterparts from animals physically associate with multiple cellular transcriptional activators, including the herpes simplex viral activator VP16 (CITATION; CITATION), RAR (CITATION), hepatocyte nuclear factor4 (CITATION), and the chondrogenesis-related transcriptional activator Sox9 (CITATION). Our data showing that mutation of the Arabidopsis MED25 gene affects the action of MYC2 in regulating the expression of JA-responsive genes prompted us to characterize the physical interaction of the two proteins in vivo. Toward this goal, we conducted coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments using our recently described 35Spro:MYC2-4myc plants (CITATION) and anti-MED25 antibody. Co-IP assays revealed that, in the absence of exogenous JA, MED25 could be precipitated by MYC2 (Figure 4A), suggesting that MED25 interacts with MYC2 at steady state. Parallel Co-IP assays indicated that the precipitation efficiency of MED25 by MYC2 was not substantially changed by JA treatment for 30 min (Figure 4A), suggesting that JA shows little effect on the MED25 and MYC2 interaction at the time point investigated. Next, we tried to map the interaction domain of MED25 with MYC2 using yeast two-hybrid assays. For these experiments, we fused the full length or derivatives of MED25 to the GAL4-DNA binding domain and fused the full-length MYC2 to the GAL4-activation domain (Figure 4B). To circumvent the problem that full-length MED25 can activate the transcription of reporter genes in yeast (CITATION), we performed our yeast two-hybrid assays in the presence of 10 mM 3-amino 1,2,4-triazol (CITATION), which could effectively repress the background transcription activation activity of full-length MED25 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Under these experimental conditions, we found that full-length MED25 showed interaction with MYC2 in yeast (Figure 4B; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). On the contrary, none of the four individual MED25 domains, including the vWF-A (MED25vWF-A), the MD (MED25MD), the ACID (MED25ACID) and the GD (MED25GD) domains, showed interaction with MYC2 in yeast (Figure 4B). In the context that the ACID domain serves as the ACID of Arabidopsis MED25 (CITATION; CITATION) as well as its mammalian counterparts (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and that deletion of the ACID and MD, but not of the vWF-A and GD, destroyed MED25 interaction with MYC2 (Figure 4B), we propose that the ACID and the MD are important for MED25 interaction with MYC2. Indeed, the MD-ACID fusion (MED25MD-ACID) showed interaction with MYC2 in yeast two-hybrid assays (Figure 4B). We then employed a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system (CITATION) to characterize further the MYC2-interacting domain of MED25. Like the full-length MED25 (Figure 4C), the MD-ACID fusion (MED25MD-ACID) showed interaction with MYC2 in BiFC assays (Figure 4D). On the contrary, neither MED25MD (Figure 4E) nor MED25ACID (Figure 4F) alone showed interaction with MYC2. Further mapping efforts using BiFC assays revealed that the smallest positive MED25 fragment (MED25540-680) included the ACID domain plus 10 amino acids of the MD (Figure 4G). Together, these data indicate that the ACID domain alone is not sufficient for MED25 interaction with MYC2. [[FIGURE]] We then use yeast two-hybrid assays to map the domain of MYC2 responsible for interaction with MED25. For these experiments, several MYC2 protein derivatives were fused to the GAL4-activation domain and full-length MED25 was fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain (Figure 4H). As indicated in Figure 4H, the N-terminal part (MYC21-188) containing the putative TAD (MYC2149-188) (CITATION; CITATION) showed interaction with MED25, whereas no interaction was observed using the middle part (MYC2189-445) or C-terminal part (MYC2446-624). Moreover, the putative TAD of MYC2 alone was sufficient to interact with MED25 (Figure 4H). It has been shown that in yeast and animals, the Mediator complex physically associates with both DNA-bound transcription factors and Pol II and thus serves as an integrative hub for transcriptional regulation (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In this context, our results showing that the Arabidopsis MED25 physically associates with MYC2 and strongly affects its function suggests that mutation of MED25 could impair the recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery during JA-triggered gene transcription. To test this, we assessed the effect of the med25-4 mutation on JA-induced recruitment of NRPB2 (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2), the second largest subunit of Pol II (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION), to the promoter of MYC2 target genes. Indeed, ChIP assays revealed that JA-induced recruitment of NRPB2 to JAZ6 promoter was markedly reduced in med25-4 compared with that in the wild type (Figure 4I). In a current view of MYC2-directed transcription of JA-responsive genes, it is hypothesized that the JAZ-mediated repression of MYC2 function is achieved through recruitment of the corepressor TPL by NINJA, which physically associates with JAZs (CITATION). This scenario predicts that during JA response, both MED25 and TPL could be recruited to the promoter of MYC2 targets. Indeed, our ChIP assays revealed that, as with MYC2 (Figures 3B and 3C) and MED25 (Figures 3B and 3D), the TPL corepressor was also recruited to the JAZ6 promoter (Figure 4J). Importantly, TPL recruitment to JAZ6 promoter was substantially reduced upon 1 h of JA treatment (Figure 4J), suggesting that TPL recruitment to MYC2 target promoters is regulated by the JA ligand. In addition, Co-IP assays using the reported 35Spro:TPL-GFP plants (CITATION) and anti-MED25 antibody indicated that MED25 and TPL could exist in a protein complex (Figure 4K), albeit yeast two-hybrid assays failed to detect their direct physical interaction (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Taken together, these data support that MED25 may act as part of the general transcriptional machinery in regulating JA-triggered gene expression. Considering that MED25 regulates plant responses to a variety of abiotic stresses (CITATION), in which the phytohormone ABA plays an important regulatory role, we asked whether mutation of MED25 affects plant response to ABA. In our ABA response assays (CITATION; CITATION), the tested three mutant alleles of MED25, including med25-4, pft1-1, and pft1-2, were more sensitive than the wild type to the inhibition effect of ABA in seed germination and early seedling growth (Figures 5A to 5C). Consistent with this, ABA-induced expression levels of Em1, Em6, and RAB-RELATED GENE18 (RAB18; CITATION), three ABA-responsive marker genes in Arabidopsis (CITATION), were highly increased in med25-4 compared with those in the wild type (Figure 5D). These results support that MED25 plays a negative role in regulating ABA responses during seed germination and early seedling growth. [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that the bZIP transcription factor ABI5 plays a key role in ABA-triggered processes during seed germination and early seedling growth (CITATION). To examine the genetic interaction between MED25 and ABI5, we generated a double mutant line between med25-4 and the abi5-7 mutant, which has been shown to be insensitive to ABA (Figures 5E and 5F) (CITATION). Surprisingly, the med25-4 abi5-7 double mutant exhibits an ABA-insensitive phenotype similar to that of abi5-7, indicating that the abi5-7 mutation suppressed the ABA-hypersensitive phenotype of med25-4 (Figures 5E and 5F). These genetic data support that the negative effect of MED25 on ABA signaling requires the function of the transcription factor ABI5. We then examined the possible effect of MED25 on the expression of ABI5 at both transcription and protein levels. Our qRT-PCR assays revealed that, in germinating seeds (Figure 5G) and 10-d-old seedlings (Figure 5H), the ABA-induced mRNA levels of ABI5 showed slight but statistically significant decreases in med25-4 compared with those in the wild type, indicating that MED25 plays a positive role in the ABA-triggered increase of ABI5 transcripts. These results exclude the possibility that the ABA hypersensitive phenotype of med25-4 is caused by elevated ABI5 transcripts. To examine the MED25 effect on ABI5 expression at the protein level, we crossed the previously described 35Spro:ABI5-4myc (CITATION) plants with med25-4 and generated 35Spro:ABI5-4myc/med25-4 plants. In line with our previous observations (CITATION), 35Spro:ABI5-4myc plants contain a functional ABI5-4myc construct (CITATION) and therefore exhibit ABA-hypersensitive phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). It is noteworthy that the ABA hypersensitivity of 35Spro:ABI5-4myc/med25-4 plants was increased compared with 35Spro:ABI5-4myc plants (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). In our protein gel blot assays, an anti-myc antibody against protein extracts from these seedlings could detect two bands (Figures 5I and 5K), suggesting that the ABI5-4myc fusion protein could exist as different isoforms in these transgenic plants. These results are consistent with previous observations showing that the ABI5 protein mainly accumulates as two isoforms (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). As shown in Figures 5I and 5J, ABA treatment substantially increased the ABI5-myc fusion protein levels of 35Spro:ABI5-4myc plants. In the med25-4 background, the ABI5-myc fusion protein levels were already high in the absence of ABA, and no obvious induction was observed in response to ABA treatment (Figures 5I and 5J). These results indicate that MED25 negatively regulates the protein abundance of ABI5. Therefore, the ABA hypersensitivity of med25-4 coincides with elevated ABI5 protein levels in this mutant. These data, together with our double mutant analysis between med25-4 and the abi5-7, support a hypothesis that the ABA hypersensitive phenotype of med25-4 is caused by the elevated ABI5 protein abundance. We then asked whether 26S proteasome-dependent proteolysis is involved in the above-described MED25-mediated modulation of ABI5-myc protein abundance. Consistent with a previous report that the ABI5 protein is subject to 26S proteasome–mediated protein degradation (CITATION), we found that MG132 treatment led to an obvious increase of the ABI5-myc fusion protein in 35Spro:ABI5-4myc plants (Figures 5K and 5L). In 35Spro:ABI5-4myc/med25-4 plants, the ABI5-myc fusion protein levels were already high and only a mild increase was observed upon MG132 treatment (Figures 5K and 5L). These results support the fact that MED25-mediated increase of ABI5 protein abundance possibly involves the 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis system. We then used ChIP assays to examine whether MED25 is recruited to promoters of ABI5 target genes during ABA signaling. As shown in Figure 6A, the promoter region of Em6 contains a G-box type abscisic acid–responsive element (ABRE), which has been shown to be targeted by ABI5 (CITATION). Time-course ChIP assays using 35Spro:ABI5-4myc plants revealed that, in the absence of ABA, a low amount of ABI5 bound to the chromatin region covering the G-box type ABRE of the Em6 promoter (Figure 6B). Binding of ABI5 to Em6 promoter was clearly enhanced 1 h after ABA treatment, and this ABA-induced enhancement showed a tendency to increase during the time course investigated (Figure 6B). In a parallel time-course ChIP experiment, we use the 35Spro:MED25-4myc plants to investigate the ABA dependency of MED25 recruitment to the same region of Em6 promoter. Significantly, we found that, in contrast with ABI5, MED25 was highly enriched in the Em6 promoter in the absence of ABA; in response to ABA treatment, MED25 recruitment to the Em6 promoter exhibited a trend of decrease for the duration of the experiment (Figure 6C). [[FIGURE]] BiFC assays revealed that full-length MED25 interacts with full-length ABI5 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves (Figure 6D). Physical interaction between MED25 and ABI5 was confirmed by Co-IP experiments using 35Spro:ABI5-4myc plants and anti-MED25 antibody. As shown in Figure 6E, MED25 could be precipitated by ABI5 in the absence of exogenous ABA, suggesting that MED25 interacts with ABI5 at steady state. Significantly, Co-IP assays also revealed that, 3 h after ABA treatment, the precipitation efficiency of MED25 by ABI5 was substantially reduced, suggesting that ABA attenuates the interaction between ABI5 and MED25. These results are consistent with the above-described time-course ChIP data showing that the MED25 enrichment to the ABI5 targets was reduced by ABA (Figure 6C). We then examined the domains involved in MED25 and ABI5 interaction using yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in Figure 6F, MED25 interacts with ABI5 in yeast, and the ACID domain of MED25 is sufficient for this interaction. It is noteworthy that even though the ACID domain itself is not sufficient for MED25 interaction with MYC2, this domain is sufficient for MED25 interaction with ABI5, suggesting that the action mechanisms of MED25 in regulating JA and ABA signaling are different. To map the MED25-interacting domain of ABI5, we generated several ABI5 derivatives based on previous functional analyses of the ABI5 protein (CITATION; CITATION). Interestingly, we found that the ABI5 C-terminal part, but not its N-terminal part containing the TAD (ABI59-122aa) (CITATION), showed interaction with MED25 (Figure 6G). We further delimited the MED25 interaction domain of ABI5 to amino acids 221 to 349 (ABI5221-349) (Figure 6G).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild type. Some of the plant materials used in this study were previously described: ber6/med25-4 (CITATION); med25-1, med25-2, and med25-3 (CITATION); pft1-1 (CITATION); pft1-2 (CITATION); myc2-2 (CITATION); coi1-2 (CITATION); abi5-7 (CITATION; CITATION); VSP1pro:GUS and PDF1.2pro:LUC (CITATION); 35Spro:MYC2-4myc (CITATION); 35Spro:ABI5-4myc (CITATION); and 35Spro:TPL-GFP (CITATION). The med25-4 myc2-2 and med25-4 abi5-7 double mutants were generated by crossing parental single homozygous lines. The resulting F2 segregating progenies were genotyped to identify plants homozygous for each locus. The med25-4 and myc2-2 (Salk_083483) mutations were identified with PCR-based markers (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Identification of the abi5-7 mutation was previously described (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium at 22°C with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod (light intensity 120 μM photons m−2 s−1) as previously described (CITATION). JA-mediated root growth inhibition assays were described (CITATION). For ABA responses, seeds harvested at the same time were used for the germination and cotyledon greening assays as recently described (CITATION; CITATION). Nicotiana benthamiana was grown under a 16-h-light (28°C)/8-h-dark (22°C) photoperiod. The ber6/med25-4 (Col-0) mutant was crossed to Landsberg erecta. In the resulting F2 population, individuals showing the ber6 phenotype (i.e., insensitivity to JA-induced root growth inhibition) were identified and used for mapping. Rough mapping using 30 plants indicated that the target gene is linked to the marker ciw12 on chromosome 1. New markers (see Supplemental Table 1 online) in this region were designed according to the Monsanto Arabidopsis polymorphism database (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/browse/Cereon/). Using these markers, we analyzed 1800 plants showing the mutant phenotype and delimited the target gene to a 50-kb region covered by the BAC clone F2J7 (Figure 1H). Among the 15 genes in this region, sequencing analyses revealed a G-to-A mutation in the MED25 gene (At1g25540). For complementation analysis, the 35Spro:MED25-GFP construct was introduced into the ber6 plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation. For the allelic test, the ber6/med25-4 mutant was crossed to the previously characterized pft1-2 mutant (CITATION), and the resulting F1 plants were examined. Measurements of flowering time were performed as previously described (CITATION). Flowering time was recorded from at least 20 plants per genotype that were grown in soil under either long days (16 h white light/8 h dark) or short days (10 h white light/14 h dark). Flowering time was scored as the number of days from germination to the first appearance of buds at the apex. The total number of rosette leaves was counted after the main stem has bolted 1 cm. DNA constructs for plant transformation were generated following standard molecular biology protocols and Gateway (Invitrogen) technology. Full-length coding sequence of MED25 was amplified with Gateway-compatible primers. The PCR product was cloned by pENTR Directional TOPO cloning kits (Invitrogen) and then recombined with the binary vector pGWB5 (35S promoter, C-GFP) to generate the 35Spro:MED25-GFP construct. Full-length coding sequence of MED25 was also cloned into the pGWB17 vector (35S promoter, C-4myc) to generate the 35Spro:MED25-4myc construct. Similarly, we generated the 35Spro:MYC2-GFP construct. All primers used for DNA construct generation are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The above constructs were then transformed into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (pMP90), which was used for transformation of Arabidopsis plants via a floral dip method. Transformants were selected based on their resistance to hygromycin. Homozygous T3 or T4 transgenic seedlings were used for phenotype and molecular characterization. Full-length coding sequence of MED25 and its derivatives were amplified with listed primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Enzyme-digested PCR products were cloned into the same site of pGBKT7. Full- length MYC2, ABI5, and their derivatives were also amplified with listed primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online) and cloned into pGADT7. Yeast two-hybrid assays were based on Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid systems (Clontech). Constructs to test interaction were cotransformed into the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109. The presence of the transgenes was confirmed by growth on an SD/-Leu/-Trp plate. To assess protein interactions, the transformed yeasts were suspended in liquid SD/-Leu/-Trp to OD = 1.0. Five microliters of suspended yeast was spread in a well on the 96-well plates containing SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ X-α-Gal (4 mg/mL) medium. The interactions were observed after 3 d of incubation at 30°C. To circumvent the problem that full-length MED25 can activate the transcription of reporter genes in yeast, we performed our yeast two-hybrid assays in the presence of 10 mM 3-amino 1,2,4-triazol (CITATION), which can effectively repress the background transcription activation activity of full-length MED25 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. To test the possible interaction of MED25 with TPL and NINJA, the full-length coding sequences of MED25, NINJA, and JAZ1 were cloned into pGADT7, and the full-length coding sequences of TPL and NINJA were cloned into pGBKT7. Primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. Co-IP assays were performed according to published procedure (CITATION) with minor modifications. In brief, 10-d-old 35Spro:MYC2-4myc seedlings were homogenized in protein lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Nonidet P‑40, 0.6 mM PMSF, and 20 μΜ MG132 with Roche protease inhibitor cocktail). After protein extraction, 20 μL protein G plus agarose (Santa Cruz) was added to the 2-mg extracts to reduce nonspecific immunoglobulin binding. After 1 h of incubation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. To test the effect of JA on the interaction of MED25 with MYC2, the supernatant was incubated with or without 100 μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 4°C before immunoprecipitation of the protein complexes. Myc antibody-bound agarose beads (Santa Cruz) were then added to each reaction for 1 h at 4°C. For negative controls, immunoprecipitation was performed without antibody. The precipitated samples were washed at least four times with the lysis buffer and then eluted by adding 1× SDS protein loading buffer with boiling for 5 min. Co-IP using 35Spro:ABI5-4myc was similar, except that the protein extracts were incubated with or without (±) ABA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 μM for 3 h at 4°C before immunoprecipitation of the protein complexes. To test the interaction of MED25 with TPL in plants, 6-d-old 35Spro:TPL-GFP plants were used in Co-IP assays, and 3 mg of protein extracts were precleared with the protein G plus agarose beads and incubated with GFP antibody (Abcam) and the protein G plus agarose beads at 4°C for 4 h. Full-length coding sequences of MED25, MYC2, ABI5, and derivatives of MED25 were cloned into the binary N-terminal fragment of YFP or the C-terminal fragment of YFP vector through Gateway reaction with pENTR vector system (Invitrogen) and sequence verified. Primers for the construction are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The resulting constructs were then introduced into Agrobacterium strain GV3101. N. benthamiana infiltration was performed as described (CITATION). After infiltration, plants were incubated for at least 50 h before observation. The YFP fluorescence was imaged under a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). Leaves were infiltrated with 2 µg/mL 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclei staining 2 h before observation. ChIP assays were performed following a published protocol (CITATION) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1.5 g of 35Spro:MED25-GFP, 35Spro:MED25-4myc, 35Spro:MYC2-GFP, 35Spro:ABI5-4myc, 35Spro:TPL-GFP, Col-0, or med25-4 seedlings were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde and their chromatin isolated. GFP antibody (Abcam), myc antibody (Millipore), or RPB2 antibody (catalog no. ab10338; Abcam) was used to immunoprecipitate the protein-DNA complex, and the precipitated DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) for qRT-PCR analysis. The ChIP experiments were performed three times. Chromatin precipitated without antibody was used as negative control, while the isolated chromatin before precipitation was used as input control. Primers used for ChIP-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. For qRT-PCR analysis of JA-responsive genes, total RNA was extracted from 10-d-old seedlings treated with MeJA as indicated (using Trizol [Invitrogen] reagent). For qRT-PCR analysis of ABA-responsive genes, seeds were germinated on 10 μΜ ABA for 3 d after stratification. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion) for small-scale RNA isolation. cDNA was prepared from 2 µg of total RNA with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and quantified with an cycler apparatus (Roche 480) with the SYBR Green kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression levels of target genes were normalized to ACTIN7, and the expression levels in Col-0 without hormone treatment were arbitrarily set to 1. The statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t test. Primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Full-length coding sequence of MED25 was PCR amplified from reverse transcription product with gene-specific primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pMAL-c2 vector (NEB) to express MBP-MED25 protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21. The recombinant fusion protein was purified with amylase resin (NEB) and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in mouse. The antibodies were used in MED25 immunoblots at a final concentration of 1:1000. For ABI5 protein level analysis, protein extraction was performed by homogenizing 10-d-old seedlings in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μM DTT, 20 μM MG132, and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail). For immunoblot analysis, SDS sample buffer was added to the protein extracts. Protein samples were boiled for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Immunoblots were probed with anti-myc antibody (Abmart). Ponceau S–stained membranes are shown as loading controls. For MYC2-4myc immunoblots, an anti-myc antibody (Abmart) was used at a final dilution of 1:2000. For TPL-GFP immunoblots, an anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) was used at a final dilution of 1:1000. Inoculation of Pst strain DC3000 was performed as previously described (CITATION). To determine bacterial growth, infected leaves were collected at 0 and 3 d after inoculation. At each time point, 10 leaves were collected from each genotype.
