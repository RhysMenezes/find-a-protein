!~ABS~! Towards the elucidation of the cellular function(s) of GPα1, we have characterized its subcellular localization using immunofluorescence and cell fractionation. GPα1 is not present in nuclei or chloroplasts. It is a membrane-bound protein, and analysis of isolated endoplasmic and plasma membranes indicates a good correlation between GPα1 in both the plasma membrane and the ER compartment. Interestingly, these results may suggest more different functions for GPα1: it might be involved in transmission of extracellular signals across the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, and/or it may also be involved in regulating some aspects of the ER functions or membrane trafficking between both membranes.
!~RES~! Affinity purified polyclonal anti-GPα1 antibodies detected a single band at 45 kDa on a western blot (see Figs. 2A and B, 3A, 4A and 5A), which corresponds to the predicted size of the product of GPA1 CITATION. We cannot rule out that the antibodies cross-react with an other band of the same size, however this is unlikely because GPA1 appears to be a unique gene in Arabidopsis CITATION. The antibodies were used to visualize the subcellular localization of GPα1 in Arabidopsis root tip cells (meristematic cells). CITATION A shows immunofluorescence localization of GPα1 in the plasma membrane. Some fluorescent signal is also detected inside the cells, in particular in the top left cell. The GPα1 staining pattern is coincident with staining by the lectin concanavalin (CITATIONB) which is known to stain the plasma membrane and the ER CITATION. The intriguing localization of GPα1, not only on the plasma membrane, but also on cytoplasmic structures prompted us to study its intracellular localization in more detail. Since so few well characterized antibodies for the different plant membrane compartments are available, we opted to use subcellular fractionation procedures. For the purpose of identifying the cytoplasmic structures with which GPα1 is associated, Arabidopsis and cauliflower homogenates were submitted to differential centrifugation. Different cellular compartments were identified by characteristic enzymatic activities (see CITATIONfor full name of the enzymes): IDPase (Golgi), CCR (nuclei, ER) and ATPase (plasma membranes) (CITATION C). In the P1 (Arabidopsis) and P1′ (cauliflower) pellets obtained by low speed centrifugation, the CCR marker should indicate the presence of nuclear membrane as the centrifugal force used is not sufficient to pellet other membranes. The results in CITATIONC indicate that the Arabidopsis pellet P1 contains pure nuclei, while the cauliflower pellet, P1′ shows a low level of plasma membrane enzymatic activity. The chloroplasts isolated in a separate experiment from Arabidopsis leaves show none of the above activities, while the P2, P2′, P3, and P3′ pellets for both plant extracts show the presence of all three intracellular membranes. Most of the plasma membrane is found in the P3 and P3′ pellets and the ER is distributed roughly equally between the P2 and P3; and the P2′ and P3′ fractions (see CITATION for the % of recovery of each marker in the different cauliflower fractions). The 100 000×g supernatant contains most of the IDPase activity, indicating that a large portion of the Golgi apparatus was probably broken in the homogenization process (CITATIONC, CITATION). The western blot follows the presence of GPα1 in different fractions of Arabidopsis (CITATIONA) and cauliflower (CITATIONB) extracts and indicates that GPα1 is not detectable in P1 but present at low level in P1′. Since P1′ appears to be contaminated by some plasma membrane, we conclude that GPα1 is most likely not present in nuclei and that the presence of GPα1 in the P1′ pellet is due to plasma membrane contamination. GPα1 is present in the P2, P3, P2′, and P3′ pellets, indicating its presence in membranes, although the data did not allow the distinction between the different cellular compartments. GPα1 is not detected in the soluble fraction (S3 and S3′). Since similar results were obtained with Arabidopsis tissue and with cauliflower tissue, the following experiments were done on cauliflower inflorescence which provided a greater source of homogeneous tissue with a high level of GPα1 protein. In order to distinguish between the different membranes we performed isopycnic centrifugation on a cauliflower microsomal fraction to isolate the ER (CITATION B). In the first gradient, we only detected CCR activity in the 15/35% sucrose interface, while the 35/40% sucrose interface showed the presence of CCR and ATPase activity. After the 35/40% sucrose interface was treated by EDTA to release the smooth ER and centrifuged on the second gradient, the 15/25% sucrose interface showed only CCR activity while the 25/50% sucrose interface showed only ATPase activity. The western blot analysis shows the presence of GPα1 in all four fractions (CITATIONA). Since we have a pure fraction of rough ER, a pure fraction of smooth ER and a pure fraction of plasma membrane, these results would indicate that GPα1 is present in all these membranes. None of these fractions had any IDPase activity, indicating that they had no contaminating Golgi apparatus. To determine if GPα1 was associated with the Golgi apparatus we purified Golgi membranes using rate zonal and isopycnic separation (CITATION B). The 37.5/43% and the 17/37% sucrose interfaces were enriched in IDPase activity but they also presented a small amount of ATPase activity. The 43/45.4% sucrose interface has most of the ATPase activity of these fractions and no measurable IDPase or CCR activity. The 45.4/50% sucrose interface has a low level of ATPase activity and no detectable IDPase and CCR activity. The western blot results show the association of GPα1 with fractions containing ATPase activity, pointing to GPα1 being associated with the plasma membrane (CITATIONA). We cannot rule out, however, that a small portion of GPα1 protein is being associated with the Golgi apparatus, and contributes to the signal observed on the western blot in the 37.5/43% and the 17/37% sucrose interfaces. The plasma membrane was purified by phase partitioning and after the second round of two-phase partitioning, the ATPase activity was found in the interface fraction while the CCR activity was found in the lower phase fraction and at a low level in the upper phase fraction, while IDPase activity could not be detected in any of these fractions (CITATION B). Depending on the phase system used, localization of the plasma membrane at the interface has been reported previously CITATION. Western blot analysis clearly indicated that GPα1 is present in the lower phase and interface and at a much reduced level in the upper phase (CITATIONA). Thus, GPα1 distribution coincides with the distribution of plasma and ER membranes.
!~MM~! A 0.9 kB EcoRI/BamHI fragment of GPA1 cDNA CITATIONencoding the C-terminal portion of GPα1 was cloned into the pATH2 vector to express a fusion polypeptide with the amino-terminus of the E. coli trpE protein. After transformation of this plasmid into TB1 cells and selection for recombinant clones, inclusion bodies isolated from the induced bacterial cultures were purified and used to inject New Zealand White rabbits for anti-GPα1 antibodies. The serum obtained was affinity purified on agarose beads covalently linked to pure recombinant GPα1 using the AminoLink Plus Immobilization kit from Pierce. Pure recombinant GPα1 was obtained by cloning of GPA1 into the pET19b vector to express a recombinant protein with a histidine tag at the N-terminal, allowing the protein to be purified on a metal chelating resin according to the manufacturer's specifications (Novagen). Arabidopsis root tips were fixed in 8% formaldehyde and 5% DMSO in PME buffer (50 mM Pipes pH 6.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA) for 1 h, then rinsed 3 times in PME buffer and treated with 2% Driselase (Sigma) for 20 min. Cells were released by squashing the root tips with a coverslip on poly-lysine coated slides. After the cells were air dried, they were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and exposed to the affinity-purified primary antibody in PME with 3% BSA for 1 h. After washing to remove unbound antibody, the cells were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocynate (1/50 dilution, Amersham) and with concanavalin A conjugated to Texas Red (1/50 dilution, Molecular Probes) in PME for 1 h. The cells were washed and the nuclei were stained with 150 ng/ml of DAPI (Sigma) for 1 min and after a final brief wash the slides were mounted in antifade mountant (Vector) and viewed by conventional epifluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss microscope. All manipulations in this section and the following sections were carried out at 4°C or on ice. 20–40 g of cauliflower inflorescence or 3-week old Arabidopsis plantlets were chopped with a razor blade and homogenized with a Polytron for 2 min at 3000 rpm in 1 ml/g of tissue homogenization buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 μM leupeptin, 3 mM o-phenanthroline, 3 μM E-64, 0.2 mM bestatin, 0.4 M sucrose, 2.5% Ficoll 400, 2.5% dextran T 250). The homogenate was filtered through 6 layers of miracloth. The filtered homogenate was centrifuged at 360×g for 10 min to yield the pellet P1 and the supernatant S1. P1 was washed 2 times with homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X100, then rinse twice with homogenization buffer alone. The purity of the nuclei in the washed P1 pellet was checked by light microscopy. The S1 supernatant was centrifuged at 11 000×g for 20 min to yield the pellet P2 and the supernatant S2. S2 was centrifuged at 100 000×g for 30 min to yield the pellet P3 and the supernatant S3. Chloroplasts were purified from Arabidopsis leaves. Briefly, a filtered homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 1000×g and the pellet was gently resuspended in homogenization buffer minus the Ficoll and dextran, layered onto a 52/30% (w/w) sucrose step gradient and centrifuged at 110 000×g for 30 min. The intact chloroplasts collect at the 52/30% sucrose interface. The sucrose solutions were made in homogenization buffer minus the sucrose, Ficoll and dextran (basic buffer). ER membranes were isolated by isopycnic centrifugation of a cauliflower homogenate according to a modification of CITATION. The homogenate was centrifuged at 6000×g for 15 min and the supernatant was layered onto a 50% (w/w) sucrose solution cushion and centrifuged at 100 000×g for 30 min to obtain total membranes at the supernatant/sucrose interface. The membranes were diluted with basic buffer to a final sucrose concentration of 10% (w/w) and layered onto a 40%, 35% and 15% (w/w) sucrose solution step gradient and centrifuged at 100 000×g for 2 h. Each interface was removed and the 35/40% sucrose interface (enriched in rough ER) was diluted with basic buffer containing 10 mM EDTA and kept on ice for 30 min to strip the ER from the ribosomes. The smooth ER was pelleted by centrifugation at 150 000×g for 1 h, resuspended in basic buffer containing 3 mM EDTA and layered onto a 50%, 25% and 15% (w/w) sucrose solution step gradient and centrifuged at 100 000×g for 3 h. The smooth ER membranes collect at the 15/25% sucrose interface. All interfaces were collected, diluted with 0.2 M sucrose solution, centrifuged at 100 000×g for 30 min and resuspended in basic buffer. All sucrose solutions were made in basic buffer. The Golgi apparatus was isolated by rate zonal and isopycnic centrifugation of a cauliflower homogenate according to CITATION. The homogenate was centrifuged at 6000×g for 15 min and the supernatant was layered over a 50% and 45.4% (w/w) sucrose step gradient and centrifuged at 30 000×g for 30 min. The supernatant above the particulate material at the 45.4% sucrose interface was removed and aliquots of 43%, 37.5% and 17% w/w sucrose solution were carefully layered on top of the particulate material and centrifuged at 100 000×g for 3 h. The 17/37.5% and the 37.5/43% sucrose interfaces are enriched in membranes of the Golgi apparatus. Each interface was collected, diluted with 0.2 M sucrose solution, centrifuged at 100 000×g for 30 min and resuspended in basic buffer. All sucrose solutions were made in basic buffer. Plasma membranes were isolated by two-phase partitioning of a cauliflower P3 pellet. The pellet was resuspended in PSK buffer (30 mM KH2PO4/K2PO4 pH 7.8, 1.4 M sucrose, 13 mM KCl) at 2–4 mg protein/ml. 2.75 g of resuspended membranes (5–10 mg protein) were added to a two phase mixture of 6.4 g of a 20% (w/w) stock solution of dextran T500, 6.3 g of a 40% (w/w) PEG-3350 stock solution, 4.75 g of PSK buffer and 4.8 g of distilled H2O mixed by inverting 20 times and centrifuged at 1500×g for 5 min. The upper phase was removed, mixed by inversion with the lower phase of a fresh batch of two-phase mixture, and centrifuged at 1500×g for 5 min. The lower phase, the upper phase and the interface were removed, diluted 8–10 fold with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose and 1 mM EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation at 100 000×g for 30 min and resuspended in basic buffer. Antimycin A insensitive NADH:cytochrome c reductase (CCR), latent inosine 5-diphosphatase (IDPase) and cation-stimulated vanadate-inhibitable H+-ATPase (ATPase) were measured essentially according to CITATION, with the exception that the CCR buffer was 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7, 0.2 mM oxidized cytochrome c, 10 mM KCN, 5 μM antimycin A. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad dye kit, based on CITATION. Proteins of each fraction were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and used for immunodetection as described in CITATION.
