!~ABS~! For fertilization to occur in plants, the pollen tube must be guided to enter the ovule via the micropyle. Previous reports have implicated actin filaments, actin binding proteins, and the tip-focused calcium gradient as key contributors to polar growth of pollen tubes; however, the regulation of directional pollen tube growth is largely unknown. We reported previously that Arabidopsis thaliana MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) contributes to directional cell growth and cortical microtubule organization. The preferential expression of MAP18 in pollen and in pollen tubes suggests that MAP18 also may function in pollen tube growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 functions in pollen tubes by influencing actin organization, rather than microtubule assembly. In vitro biochemical results indicate that MAP18 exhibits Ca2+-dependent filamentous (F)-actin-severing activity. Abnormal expression of MAP18 in map18 and MAP18 OX plants was associated with disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the tube apex, resulting in aberrant pollen tube growth patterns and morphologies, inaccurate micropyle targeting, and fewer fertilization events. Experiments with MAP18 mutants created by site-directed mutagenesis suggest that F-actin-severing activity is essential to the effects of MAP18 on pollen tube growth direction. Our study demonstrates that in Arabidopsis, MAP18 guides the direction of pollen tube growth by modulating actin filaments.
!~RES~! We demonstrated previously that MAP18 (At5g44610) was expressed in rapidly elongating regions of root and flower tissues (CITATION). Data from the Affymetrix AG and ATH1 GeneChip arrays (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/) suggest that MAP18 is expressed primarily in male flower tissues. The Arabidopsis pollen GeneChip indicates that MAP18 is elevated in growing pollen tubes compared with germinating or hydrated pollens (CITATION). CITATION also reported strong expression of the PCaP2 (MAP18) gene in elongating root hairs and pollen tubes. To verify these observations, transgenic lines transformed with a MAP18 promoter-driven GUS reporter were generated. GUS activity then was measured from mature pollen grains and germinated pollen tubes in vitro (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). To investigate the function of MAP18 in pollen tubes, we obtained the T-DNA insertion line map18 from the ABRC (SALK_021652) (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that map18 is a knockdown mutant (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). Pollen grains from wild-type and map18 plants were germinated in vitro on Arabidopsis pollen medium and were observed 4 h after germination. The germination rates of map18 pollen grains were similar to those of wild-type pollen grains (P > 0.1, Student’s t test) (Figures 1A and 1C). Moreover, no obvious differences were observed in the mean length of pollen tubes between map18 and wild-type specimens (P > 0.1, Student’s t test) (Figures 1A and 1C). However, map18 pollen tubes displayed bending growth patterns with markedly swollen tip regions (Figure 1B). The mean width of pollen tubes was significantly increased in map18 (12.9 ± 1.1 μm) compared with the wild type (7.4 ± 0.9 μm, P < 0.01, Student’s t test) (Figure 1C). Measurements of the net angles of pollen tube growth showed that most wild-type pollen tubes grew at an average net angle of 10.1 ± 1.1°. By contrast, map18 pollen tubes bended at a significantly larger average net angle of 29.3 ± 2.4° (P < 0.01, Student’s t test) (Figures 1B and 1C). [[FIGURE]] The abnormal growth phenotype of map18 was rescued following transformation with a MAP18promoter:MAP18-eGFP (for enhanced green fluorescent protein) construct. Fifteen of 18 independently transformed lines recovered the swollen-tip phenotype in pollen tubes. Two of these lines (COM#1 and COM#9) were selected for further phenotypic analysis (Figure 1B; see Supplemental Figure 1C online). We concluded that the defects observed in map18 pollen tubes resulted from downregulation of MAP18 expression and that MAP18 is required for normal pollen tube growth. The complementation of the map18 pollen tube phenotype by MAP18-eGFP indicated that MAP18-eGFP could functionally replace endogenous MAP18. To understand the function of MAP18 in pollen tubes in vivo, MAP18 overexpression lines were generated by expressing MAP18pro:MAP18-eGFP in the wild-type background (Columbia [Col]). The severity of the wavy-tube phenotype correlated with the expression levels of MAP18 revealed by qRT-PCR analysis and with the fluorescence levels observed under the same microscope setting in the MAP18-eGFP pollen tubes (see Supplemental Figure 2 online), suggesting an association between expression levels of MAP18-eGFP and the induced pollen tube phenotype. Line #3 was chosen for further analyses and named MAP18 OX. We next examined the pollen tube growth in the stigmata and styles of wild-type, MAP18 OX, and map18 plants. Pollen tubes were fixed and stained with aniline blue at 2 h or 24 h after pollination and were observed using fluorescence microscopy. At 2 h after self-pollination, wild-type, map18, and MAP18 OX pollen had germinated and pollen tubes penetrated into stigmatic tissues to reach the top of the transmitting tracts (Figures 2A to 2C). No significant differences were detected in the maximum lengths or overall morphologies of wild-type, map18, and MAP18 OX pollen tubes. This was consistent with the observation that knocking down MAP18 did not affect the germination or growth rates of pollen tubes in vitro. [[FIGURE]] A growth defect was revealed in map18 and MAP18 OX plants at 24-h after self-pollination when most wild-type, map18, and MAP18 OX pollen tubes had reached the bottom of the transmitting tracts and had targeted ovules (Figures 2D to 2F). Wild-type pollen tubes grew along the funiculi and directly toward the ovules (Figure 2D). By contrast, map18 pollen tubes exhibited aberrant growth, extensively elongating outward from the transmitting tract (Figure 2E, closed arrowhead) or exhibiting meandering patterns around the micropyles (Figure 2G). These defects were absent in map18 pistils pollinated with wild-type pollen (Figure 2G), suggesting that MAP18 did not affect the female gametophyte. The growth of MAP18 OX pollen tubes also exhibited disordered and entangled patterns in the transmitting tract (Figure 2F). Although more than half of the pollen tubes could eventually target micropyles, we observed a wandering growth behavior along the pathway (Figure 2H), and some pollen tubes failed to reach ovules (Figure 2F, open arrowhead). These defects were not observed in MAP18 OX pistils pollinated with wild-type pollen (Figure 2H). To quantify this phenotype, the relative distance ratio (i.e., the distance of the pollen tube growth path divided by the direct distance between the transmitting tract and micropyle) (Figure 2I, inset) was calculated. The relative distance ratio was 1.3 ± 0.3 in wild-type pollen tubes (n = 48), 2.1 ± 0.4 (n = 28) in map18 pollen tubes, and 1.8 ± 0.5 (n = 28) in MAP18 OX pollen tubes (Figure 2I). These quantitative results confirmed the visual observations of abnormal pollen tube growth in map18 and MAP18 OX plants. These results suggest that MAP18 plays an important role in regulating growth direction and targeting of pollen tubes. Because a change in MAP18 expression level caused a male-specific transmission defect, we expected to observe a concomitant defect in embryonic fertilization. Therefore, we examined wild-type and map18 siliques. All map18 siliques contained substantial seed gaps (Figure 2J, arrows) and unfertilized ovules (Figure 2K, asterisks). The proportion of overall seed setting was 82% (750 seeds total scored in 15 siliques from 10 map18 plants). In MAP18 OX siliques, seeds were reduced even more dramatically, and the proportion of seed setting was 65% (Figure 2L). In comparison, wild-type siliques contained virtually no unfertilized ovules. This defect was rescued in COM#1. However, no aborted ovules were observed when wild-type pollen was used to pollinate map18 pistils. These data indicate that MAP18 regulates pollen tube growth direction and fertilization. We previously identified MAP18 as a microtubule-associated protein (CITATION). However, subsequent reports suggested that the microtubule cytoskeleton was not a major contributor to pollen tube tip growth (CITATION; CITATION). We investigated whether the pollen tube phenotype of map18 mutants resulted from a change in microtubule organization by observing microtubules in pollen tubes using immunofluorescent microscopy. Microtubules were organized as bundles along the elongation axis in the shank region, and few microtubules were detected in the apical domain in map18. These findings were identical to our observations of wild-type pollen tubes (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). We measured the skewness of the fluorescence intensity distribution of microtubules to evaluate the extent of microtubule bundling in the shank region of pollen tubes (this analysis is now widely used to quantify the extent of bundling of F-actin; CITATION). As shown in Supplemental Figure 3B online, microtubule bundling in map18 pollen tubes was similar to that in wild-type tubes. We then measured the percentage of occupancy of microtubules in pollen tubes, and no significant difference was detected between map18 pollen tubes and wild-type tubes (see Supplemental Figure 3B online). Therefore, the loss of MAP18 did not significantly impact microtubule organization in pollen tubes. Next, we observed F-actin organization in pollen tubes using lifeact-mEGFP driven by the pollen-specific promoter Lat52 under a spinning disc confocal microscope. In wild-type pollen tubes, actin cables were aligned longitudinally in the shank (Figure 3A), and a few highly dynamic fine F-actin structures were observed in the pollen tube tips (Figure 3D; see Supplemental Movie 1 online). Although longitudinal actin cables in the shanks appeared relatively normal across wild-type, map18, and MAP18 OX pollen tubes (Figures 3A to 3C), obvious differences were observed in the apical regions (Figures 3D to 3F). [[FIGURE]] In ∼81% of map18 pollen tubes (n = 32), slightly bending longitudinal actin cables protruded into the apical regions (Figure 3B), rather than terminating at the base of the subapical regions of the pollen tubes. Moreover, fine F-actin structures were rarely observed in the apex (Figure 3E; see Supplemental Movie 2 online). Similar features were identified in ∼6% of wild-type pollen tubes (n = 32) but not in any MAP18 OX pollen tubes observed (0%, n = 32). In MAP18 OX pollen tubes, thick longitudinal actin cables were observed in the shank regions (Figure 3C), and excessive fine F-actin structures were formed and scattered in the tip (Figure 3F; see Supplemental Movie 3 online). To quantify the defects of F-actin organization caused by abnormal expression of MAP18, we first measured the skewness in growing pollen tubes. As shown in Figure 3G, more F-actin bundles existed in apical and subapical regions of map18 pollen tubes than in wild-type or MAP18 OX tubes. The mean skewness value was significantly increased in map18 pollen tubes (4.62 ± 0.39, n = 10) compared with that of the wild type (3.84 ± 0.35, n = 10; P < 0.001, Student’s t test). By contrast, the mean skewness value in MAP18 OX tubes was decreased to 3.43 ± 0.38 (n = 10, P < 0.05, Student’s t test). Next, we counted the number of short filament fragments (length <2 μm) in growing pollen tube tips. More short apical F-actin fragments were displayed in MAP18 OX pollen tubes than in wild-type pollen tubes, but they were hardly seen in map18 pollen tubes (Figure 3H). All these observations suggested that the knockdown or overexpression of MAP18 can influence actin organization in the apical and subapical regions of growing pollen tubes. Considering that MAP18 might function as an ABP rather than a microtubule-associated protein in pollen tubes, we conducted a biochemical analysis of MAP18. Recombinant GST-MAP18 protein was prepared and purified. The ability of MAP18 to bind F-actin was examined using high-speed cosedimentation assays. Preformed F-actin (polymerized from 2 μM G-actin) was incubated with various concentrations of recombinant GST-MAP18. Following centrifugation, supernatants and pellets were harvested and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. GST-MAP18 cosedimented with F-actin in a dose-dependent manner and reached saturation in the presence of 7 μM GST-MAP18 (Figures 4A and 4B). The molar binding ratio of the recombinant protein to actin was estimated as ∼0.6:1 at the saturation level (Figure 4B). To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) value for this interaction, MAP18 in the pellet ([MAP18]bound) was plotted as a function of MAP18 in the supernatant (MAP18]free) and the resulting data fitted with a hyperbolic function. In a representative experiment shown in Figure 4C, the Kd was determined to be 0.22 μM. A mean Kd value (±sd) from three independent experiments was 0.26 ± 0.04 μM. As a control, the mean Kd value of VLN2 was determined to be 1.4 ± 0.2 μM (n = 3), which is consistent with a previously published value (Kd = 1.3 ± 0.5 μM; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To test whether GST-MAP18 bound F-actin in vitro, Alexa 488–phalloidin–stabilized F-actin was incubated with recombinant GST-MAP18 and was then stained with an anti-MAP18 primary antibody (CITATION) followed by a fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody. Samples were visualized under a microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Recombinant GST-MAP18 localized as punctate structures along F-actin (Figures 4D to 4F). These structures were not detected when GST-MAP18 was first denatured by boiling (Figures 4G to 4I) or when the primary antibody was omitted (Figures 4J to 4L). These results suggest that GST-MAP18 binds to F-actin in vitro. Next, we analyzed the effect of GST-MAP18 on actin polymerization by monitoring the polymerization of pyrene-labeled actin in the presence of various concentrations of GST-MAP18. The polymerization rate and the quantity of F-actin at equilibrium were unaffected by the presence or absence of GST-MAP18 (see Supplemental Figure 4 online), indicating that GST-MAP18 does not regulate actin polymerization. MAP18 also been described as PCaP2, owing to its capacity to bind calcium (CITATION). Because Ca2+ is markedly elevated in the apex of pollen tubes, we speculated that MAP18 could exhibit its activities on F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We observed actin filaments following incubation with GST-MAP18 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. We detected no change in actin filaments (Figure 4M) when they were incubated with 10 nM GST-MAP18 (Figure 4N) or with 50 μM Ca2+ alone (Figure 4O). However, actin filaments were fragmented if GST-MAP18 was present together with 50 μM Ca2+ (Figure 4P). These results confirmed that Ca2+ is required for MAP18 to sever actin filaments. Time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) was employed to directly observe the F-actin-severing activity of MAP18. Although few breaks in the Alexa 488–phalloidin–stabilized actin filaments were observed in control samples incubated with either GST-MAP18 or Ca2+ alone, the addition of GST-MAP18 induced breaks along the actin filaments in the presence of 50 μM Ca2+ over time (Figure 4Q; see Supplemental Movie 4 online). The number of breaks per unit of filament length per second (breaks μm−1 s−1) was defined as the severing frequency and was used to characterize the severing activity of MAP18 (CITATION; CITATION). MAP18 significantly raised the severing frequency to 0.0011 ± 0.0002 in the presence of Ca2+, compared with 0.00002 ± 0.00004 in the absence of Ca2+ (Student’s t test, P < 0.001) or 0.00003 ± 0.00006 when F-actin was incubated with Ca2+ in the absence of MAP18 (P < 0.001). MAP18 severed F-actin in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4R) and reached saturation when the MAP18 concentration exceeded 10 nM (i.e., we detected no statistical difference between 10 and 20 nM). To rule out the potential negative effects of phalloidin in this assay, we analyzed the severing frequencies of MAP18 under various concentrations of phalloidin, and no significant difference was detected (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). As a control, the average severing frequency of 5 nM VLN2 was 0.011 ± 0.0008. Therefore, there was no negative effect on severing of MAP18 when F-actin was labeled by phalloidin. To confirm that the severing activity of MAP18 was Ca2+ dose dependent, 10 nM MAP18 was incubated with various concentrations of Ca2+. The severing frequency increased with an increase in Ca2+ concentration (Figure 4S). No severing activity was detected when the Ca2+ concentration was below 0.5 μM; however, the average severing frequency clearly increased when the Ca2+ concentration exceeded 5 μM. These findings indicated that GST-MAP18 can sever actin filaments in a Ca2+ dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the F-actin binding of MAP18 was not affected by Ca2+; the mean Kd value of MAP18 was 0.27 ± 0.08 μM in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+, which is quite similar to the mean Kd value of 0.26 ± 0.04 μM in the absence of Ca2+. Using MAP18-eGFP, we analyzed the localization patterns of MAP18 in pollen tubes during pollen tube growth. At 4 h after germination, the control green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal driven by the MAP18 promoter in the map18 background was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 5A). In pollen tubes expressing MAP18-eGFP (map18 background), the fluorescence signal was detected primarily at the plasma membrane in the flanks of pollen tubes and in the inverted cones of the apical regions (Figures 5B and 5E). Plasmolysis revealed that MAP18-eGFP was associated with the plasma membrane and not the cell wall (Figure 5D). Cross-sectioning through the Z-stack projection of a pollen tube at the shank region confirmed that MAP18-eGFP was enriched at the plasma membrane (Figure 5B, inset). [[FIGURE]] We quantified the MAP18-eGFP fluorescence ratio of the membranous-to-cytoplasmic signal in pollen tubes. A line was drawn across the pollen tube shank or across the pollen tube tip, and the fluorescence pixel intensity was measured by ImageJ (Figure 5B). The fluorescence signal ratio was 1.4 in shanks and 0.8 in the apical regions (P < 0.001, Student’s t test). Typical pixel intensities corresponding to the lines in Figure 5B were plotted in Figure 5F. This confirmed that MAP18-eGFP was mainly localized to the shank plasma membrane and the inverted cone of the apex. When pollen tube growth slowed down occasionally or was arrested by freezing at −20°C for 20 min (CITATION), a temporary MAP18-eGFP signal was detected at the apical plasma membrane that disappeared when pollen tube growth resumed (Figure 5C; see Supplemental Figures 6A and 6B and Supplemental Movie 5 online). This plasma membrane location pattern of MAP18 in pollen tubes was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy using a previously reported anti-MAP18 polyclonal antibody (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). Taken together, our observation suggested that the association of MAP18 with the apical plasma membrane was related to the ceasing growth of pollen tubes. To maintain pollen tube growth, MAP18 must be removed from the apical plasma membrane. Furthermore, in the apical region, the distribution of cytosolic MAP18-eGFP in the inverted cone was continually relocalized to the region of new growth when pollen tubes were reorienting their growth trajectories (Figure 5E). Real-time imaging revealed that the growth rates of MAP18 OX and map18 pollen tubes were similar to that of the wild type (Figure 5G). However, MAP18 OX pollen tubes were constantly readjusting their growth directions, exhibiting swinging growth trajectories, whereas map18 pollen tubes maintained a clockwise bending under the microscope. These findings indicated that MAP18 is important for regulating the directionality of pollen tube growth. To further investigate the function of MAP18 in pollen tube directional growth, we generated MAP18 protein mutants by site-directed mutagenesis, in which the Glu (E) or Lys (K) residues in the VEEKK motifs of MAP18 were mutated into Ala or Gly residues (named MAP18-M1 to M7, respectively) (see Supplemental Figure 8 and Supplemental Table 1 online). Six MAP18 protein mutants (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, and M7) were obtained (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Recombinant mutant proteins were prepared and purified for in vitro analyses. M1 and M2 were unable to sever F-actin in the presence of 50 μM Ca2+, although they still bound F-actin (see Supplemental Table 2 online) with Kd values that were similar to wild-type MAP18 (see Supplemental Figures 9A to 9C online). By contrast, there were no obvious differences in F-actin-severing activities between the other four mutant proteins (M3, M4, M6, and M7) and wild-type MAP18, and all the mutant proteins could bind F-actin in vitro (see Supplemental Figure 9 and Supplemental Table 2 online). Mutants M1 and M2 (lacking F-actin-severing activity in the presence of Ca2+) and M7 (maintaining F-actin-severing activity in the presence of Ca2+) were chosen for further phenotypic observations and functional analyses. Each MAP18 mutant (M1, M2, and M7) was fused with eGFP and introduced into map18 plants under the control of MAP18 promoter, respectively. Lines expressing MAP18 mutant proteins to a level that is comparable to the expression level of MAP18 in wild-type plants were chosen for further analysis (named m1, m2, and m7, respectively; see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Pollen tubes m1 and m2 germinated in vitro exhibited no obvious defects in elongation (Figure 6A) and displayed the bending growth pattern characteristic of map18 pollen tubes. By contrast, m7 pollen tubes reduced the growth bending angle to a level that mimicked wild-type tubes, thereby compensating for the map18 phenotype (Figure 6B). [[FIGURE]] We subsequently investigated pollen tube growth in the stigma and style. Similar to map18 pollen tubes, m1 and m2 pollen tubes exhibited aberrant growth patterns (Figure 6C). However, m7 pollen tubes grew relatively normally in pistils, indicating that m7 complemented map18. Quantification and statistical analysis indicated that the relative distance ratios of m1 (1.9 ± 0.7, n = 28) and m2 (2.0 ± 0.6, n = 20) were greater than those of wild-type (1.3 ± 0.3, n = 48) and m7 (1.3 ± 0.2, n = 31) pollen tubes (P < 0.001, Student’s t test), whereas no significant differences between wild-type and m7 pollen tubes were observed (P = 0.8, Student’s t test) (Figure 6C, inset). Moreover, the overall number of seeds in siliques was reduced substantially in m1 and m2, but not in m7, in comparison to the wild type (Figures 6D and 6E). We also examined the subcellular distributions of these three mutant proteins. Green fluorescence of M1-eGFP, M2-eGFP, or M7-eGFP was detected on the flank plasma membranes and in the inverted cones of the apical regions of growing pollen tubes, similar to wild-type MAP18-eGFP (COM#1) (Figure 6F). These observations indicated that the subcellular localization of MAP18 was not altered with these protein mutations. Therefore, the effects on pollen tube growth and fertilization events observed in m1, m2, and m7 mutants were likely due to their various F-actin-severing activities and not their subcellular distributions. In addition, we observed the localization patterns of MAP18-eGFP, M1-eGFP, M2-eGFP, and M7-eGFP in root epidermal cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. As nontagged wild-type MAP18 recognized by anti-MAP18 antibody, GFP-tagged MAP18 and its mutant proteins were still partially colocalized with cortical microtubules in root cells (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). This further demonstrated the plasma membrane localization pattern of MAP18 and MAP18 mutant proteins in pollen tubes was not an artifact caused by GFP tagging. Together, we conclude that the function of MAP18 in modulating F-actin is crucial for pollen tube growth.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col was the background for all wild-type and mutant tissues described in this study. Plants were grown in soil at 22°C with a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark. Seeds were sterilized for 15 min in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and then were immersed in growth medium at 4°C in the dark for 2 d before transferring to the growth room. An Arabidopsis line expressing Lat52:lifeact-mEGFP was crossed to the map18 mutant and MAP18 OX, m1, m2, and m7 transgenic plants (see below). Lines that displayed a similar fluorescence intensity under the same microscopy settings were chosen for further analysis (see Supplemental Figure 12 online). The growth medium contained half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts and 0.9% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich). Arabidopsis lines (Col background) with T-DNA insertions in MAP18 were obtained from the ABRC (map18, SALK_021652). A PCR-based approach was used to identify homozygous lines. PCR genotyping was performed using three primers: a primer near the right border of the T-DNA insert (LBb1, 5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) and a pair of MAP18-specific primers (MAP18-LP, 5′-TGATTTCCTTTAAATAGCCAGAGTG-3′, and MAP18-RP, 5′-AAAAACAAGGCAGGATCATCG-3′). Homozygous lines were used in subsequent analyses. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to test whether map18 homozygous plants generated MAP18 transcripts. Total RNA was extracted from inflorescences and flowers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The coding region of MAP18 was amplified by qRT-PCR using the following primer set: MAP18 forward, 5′-AAGCCAGCTGTGGAAGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCGGGAGCCTTAGT-3′. As a positive control, EF1α transcript levels were measured in the same tissues using the primer set: EF1α forward, 5′- ACGCTCTTCTTGCTTTCACC-3′, and EF1α reverse, 5′-GAGATTGGCACAAATGGGAT-3′. SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio) was used for amplification. The plant transformation vector pCAMBIA1390 (Cambia) was used to generate transformed plants. A 2.2-kb region of the MAP18 promoter was amplified from wild-type genomic DNA using the primers 5′-AAGCTTACGAGTGACTCAACTCCTCTCCA-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCGTCGACCTTTTAAAAAATTAACCTGCCACC-3′, as previously described (CITATION). The product was cloned into the pCAMBIA1390 vector and used to control the expression of various MAP18-eGFP reporter constructs. MAP18 was amplified using the primers 5′-GTCGACATGGGTTATTGGAAGTC-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCACCACCTCCACCTCCAGCCTTTTGTGGCGCAG-3′, as reported previously (CITATION), and eGFP was amplified from the pEZS-NL vector using the primers 5′-CGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG-3′. Both amplicons were then cloned into the pCAMBIA-MAP18pro vector with eGFP at the C terminus. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MutanBEST; TaKaRa) using a pMD18-T-MAP18 construct (TaKaRa) as a template. Primer pairs were synthesized that specified the insertion of Ala or Gly within the amino acid residues indicated (see Supplemental Table 1 online). The altered cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T vectors for expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21 or into pCAMBIA1390 vectors driven by the native MAP18 promoter for transformation into Arabidopsis. All cDNAs were sequence verified. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (CITATION). Plants were transformed using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by the floral dip method (CITATION). Homozygous map18 mutant plants were transformed with the pCAMBIA-MAP18pro:MAP18-eGFP construct for complementation of map18 plants. Transgenic plants were selected on Murashige and Skoog culture medium containing 30 mg/L hygromycin. Arabidopsis pollen grains were germinated on medium consisting of 5 mM MES (pH 5.8, adjusted with Tris), 18% Suc, 1 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM boric acid, 0.05% (w/v) lactalbumin hydrolysate, 10 mM myoinositol, and 0.7% (w/v) agarose in a humid chamber, as previously reported (CITATION). To achieve plasmolysis, 25% mannitol in liquid germination medium was added to the pollen tube growth culture for 20 min. Approximately 4 h after germination, images of pollen tubes were captured using a BX51 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Photometrics) using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging). Pollen tube lengths and growth angles were measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). All experiments were performed in triplicate, and 150 pollen tubes were measured in each experiment. To evaluate fertilization, seed setting rates were counted in mature siliques to identify unfertilized ovules. Samples were visualized using an Olympus SZX16 microscope equipped with a color CCD camera (Olympus DP70) and ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics). Pollen tubes in pistils were stained with aniline blue, as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, preemasculated mature flowers were pollinated with wild-type, MAP18 OX, or map18 pollen. After 2 or 24 h, pollinated pistils were incubated in fixative solution (ethanol:acetic acid [v/v] =3:1) for at least 2 h and then in 8 M NaOH softening solution overnight. Samples were then stained with aniline blue solution in the dark. Samples were observed using an Olympus BX51 fluorescence light microscope with ×10 to ×20 objectives. The UV excitation wavelength maximum was 350 nm, and the emission spectra were collected from 440 to 612 nm. All fluorescence images of pollen tubes were recorded by spinning disc confocal microscopy (Yokogawa) using an IX81 microscope (Olympus) equipped with an iXon CCD camera (Andor Technology) and a ×100 1.45–numerical aperture objective (or a ×60 1.42–numerical aperture objective; both Olympus). Images were acquired using iQ software (Andor). GFP was excited using 488-nm argon lasers, and emission was collected through 525 ± 5.5-nm filters. To investigate MAP18-eGFP localization, time-lapse images were acquired using 30% laser intensity and operating in the mode 512 × 512 with an exposure time of 200 ms. Images were captured for 15 min at 5-s intervals. To observe F-actin organization, Z-stacks of pollen tubes expressing Lat52:lifeact-mEGFP (CITATION; CITATION) were obtained, and three-dimensional projections were generated as the final images. Time-lapse images were taken at 30-s intervals over a 10-min period using 150-ms exposure times. Imaris software (Bitplane) was used to obtain cross sections of pollen tubes from the Z-stacks. Skewness and density were measured to quantify the extent of F-actin (or microtubule) bundling and the percentage of occupancy of F-actin (or microtubules) in cells as previously described (CITATION; CITATION). Data were analyzed in ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/; version 1.38). Arabidopsis pollen grains were germinated on solid germination medium at room temperature for 4 h and were stained as previously described (CITATION; CITATION) with several modifications. Briefly, pollen tubes were immersed in fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% Suc, and 100 mM PIPES buffer, pH 6.9) for 90 min and then were washed gently with PBS buffer three times. Fixed pollen tubes were treated with digestion buffer (1% cellulose and 0.5% pectinase in PBS buffer) at room temperature for 45 min and then were washed gently with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 three times for 10 min per wash. Mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 1:600 in liquid germination medium containing 5% Gly and was applied as the primary antibody. Alexa 488–conjugated (or fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated) goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:400) was used as the secondary antibody. Pollen tubes were incubated in primary antibody at 4°C overnight and then were incubated in secondary antibody at 37°C in germination medium for 2 h. Immunofluorescence staining of microtubules or MAP18 and its mutant proteins in root epidermal cells was conducted as previously reported by CITATION. Cosedimentation experiments were performed to test the ability of GST-MAP18 to bind F-actin. All proteins were centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min at 4°C before use. Actin was polymerized at 28°C for 30 min in KMEI buffer (50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0). Preformed F-actin (polymerized from 2 μM G-actin) was then incubated with various concentrations of GST-MAP18 (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 μM; reaction volume 100 μL) at 4°C for 30 min. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 100,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Aliquots of the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels. To determine apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values, the amount of MAP18 or VLN2 in the pellet and supernatant was analyzed by ImageJ software. A Kd value for MAP18 or VLN2 bound to actin filaments was calculated by fitting a hyperbolic function to the data from plots of protein in the pellet as a function of protein in the supernatant using Kaleidagraph v4.0 software (Synergy Software) according to CITATION In vitro immunofluorescence labeling was performed to demonstrate MAP18 binding to F-actin. Preformed F-actin was stabilized with Alexa 488-phalloidin (1:1) and was then incubated with recombinant GST-MAP18 at a molar ratio of 50:1 in KMEI buffer at room temperature for 20 min. Anti-MAP18 antibody (1:100) was then added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) at room temperature for 15 min. Aliquots (1 μL) were transferred to slides pretreated with poly-l-Lys. MAP18 denatured by boiling for 2 min or by incubating with secondary antibody alone were used as negative controls. Samples were visualized under a BX51 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Photometrics). Images were acquired using MetaMorph 6.0 (Universal Imaging). The time course of actin polymerization was monitored as reported previously (CITATION). Briefly, 3 μM G-actin containing 5% pyrenyl-actin was polymerized in KMEI buffer with various amounts of MAP18 (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 μM). Pyrenyl fluorescence was measured using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrofluorometer (Hitachi). All experiments were performed at least in triplicate under identical conditions. To visualize the F-actin-severing activity of MAP18, perfusion cell chambers (∼10-μL volumes) were prepared by adhering cover slips to slides with double-sided tape. Chambers were flushed for 10 min with 2 μg/mL poly-l-Lys, washed with Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and perfused with Alexa 488–phalloidin–labeled F-actin for 3 min to allow the F-actin to bind firmly to the cover slip surface. Chambers were then washed twice with Tris-HCl buffer. Purified GST-MAP18 protein (10 nM) was incubated with 50 mM CaCl2 in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer for 10 min before being introduced into the perfusion chamber. Time-series images were collected every 20 s by TIRFM (CITATION). Denatured MAP18 was introduced into the perfusion chamber as a negative control.
