!~ABS~! Plasma membrane-resident receptor kinases (RKs) initiate signaling pathways important for plant immunity and development. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the receptor for the elicitor-active peptide epitope of bacterial flagellin, flg22, is encoded by FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), which promotes plant immunity. Despite its relevance, the molecular components regulating FLS2-mediated signaling remain largely unknown. We show that plasma membrane ARABIDOPSIS-AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+-ATPase (ACA8) forms a complex with FLS2 in planta. ACA8 and its closest homolog ACA10 are required for limiting the growth of virulent bacteria. One of the earliest flg22 responses is the transient increase of cytosolic Ca2+ ions, which is crucial for many of the well-described downstream responses (e.g. generation of reactive oxygen species and the transcriptional activation of defense-associated genes). Mutant aca8 aca10 plants show decreased flg22-induced Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species bursts and exhibit altered transcriptional reprogramming. In particular, mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent flg22-induced gene expression is elevated, whereas calcium-dependent protein kinase-dependent flg22-induced gene expression is reduced. These results demonstrate that the fine regulation of Ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane is critical for the coordination of the downstream microbe-associated molecular pattern responses and suggest a mechanistic link between the FLS2 receptor complex and signaling kinases via the secondary messenger Ca2+. ACA8 also interacts with other RKs such as BRI1 and CLV1 known to regulate plant development, and both aca8 and aca10 mutants show morphological phenotypes, suggesting additional roles for ACA8 and ACA10 in developmental processes. Thus, Ca2+ ATPases appear to represent general regulatory components of RK-mediated signaling pathways.
!~RES~! In a proteomics approach, we previously isolated proteins colocalizing to FLS2 in plasma membrane microdomains (CITATION). To address whether some of these proteins can associate with FLS2, we focused on Ca2+ ATPases, which have also been identified as differentially phosphorylated and transcriptionally induced in response to flg22 (CITATION; CITATION). ACA8 and ACA10 belong to the family of type 2B autoinhibited Ca2+ ATPases consisting of 10 members in Arabidopsis (Supplemental Fig. S1A; CITATION). These Ca2+ ATPases comprise 10 transmembrane-spanning domains, harbor a calmodulin-binding domain for autoinhibition of the ATPase active site, and can localize to different membrane compartments (CITATION). ACA8, ACA9, and ACA10 group into a distinct subfamily and accumulate at the plasma membrane (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Whereas ACA9 expression is restricted to pollen and thereby is critical for pollen tube development, ACA8 and ACA10 are expressed throughout the plant and have not yet been assigned any specific function besides inflorescence growth (CITATION). We transiently expressed FLS2 and ACA8 fused to the N- and C-terminal halves of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), respectively, in Nicotiana benthamiana and examined possible protein-protein interactions by confocal microscopy in a so-called bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay (CITATION). In this assay, we observed reconstitution of the YFP molecule by the detection of fluorescence when expressing FLS2 fused to both of the YFP halves, indicative of FLS2 homodimerization (Fig. 1A). We also observed BiFC when FLS2 was coexpressed with ACA8. As BiFC assays are based on transient expression in a heterologous system, the tagged proteins can accumulate to high levels, facilitating the reconstitution of a BiFC signal; thus, ACA12, BRI1, and CLV1 were included as controls. No YFP reconstitution could be detected upon coexpressing of FLS2 and ACA12, another plasma membrane-resident Ca2+ ATPase. Notably, ACA8 showed a broader interaction pattern, because BiFC was also observed with other RKs, such as BRI1 and CLV1, of which the latter is functioning in stem cell identity maintenance and is normally not expressed in leaf tissue (CITATION). Similar to FLS2, both BRI1 and CLV1 formed homodimers in this assay, but unlike FLS2, they also interacted with ACA12 (Fig. 1A). In all cases of BiFC, the YFP signal was recorded at the cell periphery, suggesting complex formation at the plasma membrane. [[FIGURE]] To further overcome the limitations of BiFC assays, we performed FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements on the basis of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) using FLS2 and ACA8 fusions to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and YFP, respectively. FRET can be detected using FLIM, where reduction of the fluorescence lifetime of a donor-containing molecule occurs due to the proximity of an acceptor-containing molecule, which is an indication of physical interaction. We examined FLS2-ACA8 association in protoplasts from soil-grown Arabidopsis plants. Under this condition, we observed a significant reduction in fluorescence lifetime when FLS2-CFP and ACA8-YFP were coexpressed as compared with the fluorescence lifetime of ACA8-CFP alone (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Table S1). Similar results were obtained when we used FLS2-CFP and ACA8-YFP. This suggests that both proteins are in close proximity to each other, indicative of a protein-protein interaction. Interaction of fluorophore-tagged FLS2 and ACA8 was detected at the plasma membrane, which is in line with the subcellular localization of the two proteins and substantiates our findings of BiFC in N. benthamiana. However, the interaction of fluorophore-tagged FLS2 and ACA8 was not distributed uniformly across the plasma membrane but seen as patchy areas with strongly reduced fluorescence lifetimes (Fig. 1B), which indicates that the presence of FLS2-ACA8 complexes was restricted to subdomains within the plasma membrane. This observation is in agreement with the notion that FLS2 and ACA8 can localize to flg22-induced plasma membrane microdomains (CITATION). Despite numerous attempts, we failed to clone a full-length ACA10 cDNA, which precluded the analysis of ACA10 by fluorophore-based interaction assays. Despite poor results by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, pull-down experiments of FLS2-GFP followed by mass spectrometric analysis repeatedly revealed the presence of ACA8 and ACA10 peptides, further corroborating the existence of FLS2-ACA8 and FLS2-ACA10 complexes in planta (Supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, these results indicate that FLS2 forms a complex with ACA8 at the plasma membrane and that ACA8 can interact with multiple RKs, pointing at an important role in the regulation of RK-mediated signaling pathways. To address ACA8 function, we isolated a T-DNA insertion line and a tilling mutant (both in the ecotype Columbia [Col-0] genetic background) in the ACA8 gene (Supplemental Fig. S1B). Genetic redundancy within members of the ACA family has been documented and could be expected for members of the ACA8, ACA9, and ACA10 subgroup (CITATION). Because ACA9 expression was specific to pollen tubes, we focused on ACA10, isolated a T-DNA insertion line in the ACA10 gene, and generated aca8 aca10 double knockout lines (Supplemental Fig. S1C). In addition, we crossed a 35S::ACA8-GFP-expressing transgenic line into the aca8 aca10 double mutant. Single aca8 mutants displayed no obvious developmental phenotypes (Fig. 2). By contrast, aca10 mutant plants were reduced in inflorescence height and displayed increased axillary stem formation, which was further enhanced in aca8 aca10 plants (Fig. 2A). This phenotype was also present in aca10 plants crossed with the aca8Q70* tilling mutant (Supplemental Fig. S3) and could be rescued by ectopic ACA8-GFP expression, demonstrating functional complementation by the GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2A). Redundant functions of ACA8 and ACA10 in the regulation of inflorescence height were previously reported in the Arabidopsis Wassilewskija background (CITATION). Differences between the single mutants may result from an incomplete overlap of the ACA8 and ACA10 expression patterns. We did not observe any obvious mutant phenotype in rosette leaf development among the genotypes (Fig. 2B), whereas aca8 aca10 mutants showed significantly reduced root growth when cultivated in vitro (Fig. 2C). Reduction in root growth was affecting primary root length and could be correlated with an early differentiation of stem cells compared with wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S3). [[FIGURE]] Ca2+ ATPases are responsible for extruding Ca2+ ions from the cytosol into endomembrane compartments or extracellularly into the apoplast (CITATION; CITATION). ACA8 has been shown to mediate Ca2+ transport in yeast and is activated by the binding of calmodulin (CaM) to its N terminus (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). Based on the interaction of ACA8 with FLS2, we addressed whether ACA8 and ACA10 function in the flg22-triggered Ca2+ burst. All genotypes, therefore, were crossed to a transgenic line expressing the aequorin (Aeq) Ca2+ biosensor (CITATION). We performed luminescence-based measurements of free cytosolic Ca2+ and revealed slightly elevated constitutive Ca2+ levels in aca8 aca10 Aeq plants (Supplemental Fig. S4). We then monitored the MAMP-induced Ca2+ burst over time. Mutant aca8 Aeq and aca10 Aeq plants responded like wild-type plants upon flg22 treatment. By contrast, the flg22-triggered Ca2+ burst was strongly reduced in the aca8 aca10 Aeq lines and completely abolished in fls2 Aeq plants (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. S5). The overall pattern of the transient increase of Ca2+ remained similar between the wild type and the aca8 Aeq and aca10 Aeq genotypes, but the maximal influx (peak) of the Ca2+ signature was affected in aca8 aca10 Aeq plants (Supplemental Fig. S5). The Ca2+ burst in response to chitin was slightly reduced in aca8 aca10 Aeq lines and for all other genotypes was indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig. 3A). The lower peak in flg22-induced cytosolic Ca2+ influx in the double mutant demonstrates that ACA8 and ACA10 both contribute to the flg22-elicited Ca2+ burst and indicates a role for these proteins in the regulation of FLS2-mediated early responses. [[FIGURE]] The production of ROS upon MAMP treatments is mediated by plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases, which depend on Ca2+ signaling for their function (CITATION; CITATION). We examined the flg22-triggered oxidative burst and detected no significant differences between wild-type plants and the aca8 and aca10 single mutants, whereas the aca8 aca10 double mutant displayed an overall decreased ROS production when treated with flg22 (Fig. 3B). ROS production upon chitin treatment remained comparable to the wild type in all tested mutants. The decrease in oxidative burst correlated with the reduced flg22-triggered Ca2+ signature in aca8 aca10 plants, which is in agreement with Ca2+ operating upstream of ROS production. When monitoring these individual MAMP responses, we observed genetic redundancy between ACA8 and ACA10, suggesting that both Ca2+ ATPases exert overlapping functions in these early and transient flg22 responses, which is in contrast to the unequal role of ACA8 and ACA10 in development. Western-blot analysis revealed unaltered FLS2 protein accumulation in the aca mutants compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the observed reduction in flg22-triggered Ca2+ and ROS bursts is likely caused by the loss of ACA8 and ACA10 function rather than altered FLS2 levels. For more detailed analysis of ACA8/ACA10 functions, we determined the transcriptional changes caused by ACA8 and ACA10 loss of function by microarray analysis. A total of 69 transcripts were identified as showing significantly elevated transcript levels, and 10 had significantly lower transcript abundance in the aca8 aca10 double mutant compared with wild-type seedlings (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Information S1). We validated the differential transcript accumulation of 19 out of 20 tested genes by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis, of which 17 showed wild-type-like expression in the aca8 aca10/35S::ACA8-GFP line, further substantiating the functionality of the ACA8-GFP fusion protein (Supplemental Table S2). Most remarkably, genes belonging to the Gene Ontology categories âcalcium ion bindingâ and âcation bindingâ were overrepresented among the genes that show higher transcript levels in the aca8 aca10 double mutant (Supplemental Table S2). The first category includes genes coding for CaM-like proteins such as CML35, CML36, CML41, CML45, CML46, and CML47 (CITATION). Increased expression of CaM-like genes could be a compensatory mechanism to counteract the deficiency in extruding Ca2+ ions from the cytosol in aca8 aca10 plants. Only a small number of the aca8 aca10 deregulated genes were associated with plant defense (Supplemental Table S2). One of them encodes ACD6, a regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated disease resistance (CITATION). Significantly reduced ACD6 transcript levels in aca8 aca10 plants may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000). To find out whether any of the other genes that exhibit differential transcript levels in aca8 aca10 has a potential role in MAMP-triggered immunity, we searched publicly available transcriptome databases and identified 27 of the aca8 aca10 up-regulated genes to be induced in response to MAMP treatments (Supplemental Fig. S6A). We then focused on genes downstream of flg22 Ca2+ signaling (CITATION). There was little overlap between the aca8 aca10 deregulated and CDPK-dependent genes (Supplemental Fig. S6C), which could be due to the different plant materials used for transcript profiling. Therefore, we studied the flg22-induced expression of selected marker genes specifically downstream of the MAPK and/or CDPK cascade (CITATION). flg22-induced expression of MAPK-regulated FLAGELLIN-RESPONSIVE KINASE1 was considerably higher in aca8 aca10 plants compared with the wild type (Fig. 4). This could point at elevated MAPK signaling in aca8 aca10; however, there was no correlation between flg22-induced MAPK activation and the increased expression of MAPK-specific genes (Supplemental Fig. S7). Induction of the downstream genes cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81F2, FAD-LINKED OXIREDUCTASE, and NDR1/HIN-LIKE10, which are controlled by both the MAPK and CDPK pathways, was either wild type like or somewhat enhanced (Fig. 4). By contrast, the flg22-induced transcript accumulation of the CDPK downstream gene PHOSPHATE INDUCED1 was notably reduced compared with wild-type levels (Fig. 4). This indicates that gene induction mediated by CDPK signaling is insufficient, likely due to altered flg22 activation of the CDPK cascade. [[FIGURE]] Our data show that knockout of ACA8 and ACA10 function causes pronounced changes in steady-state transcript levels, probably for phenotypic compensation, and also impairs proper flg22-induced transcriptional reprogramming. This was further supported by the differential transcript accumulation of additional marker genes (Supplemental Fig. S8), which either was enhanced (At5g25250, At1g66880, and MYB51/At1g18570) or reduced (At2g47140 and WRKY30/At5g24110) upon flg22 elicitation. We also investigated the flg22-dependent expression of ACA12 and ACA13, which are potential candidates for compensating ACA8 and ACA10 loss of function (Supplemental Fig. S1A). After flg22 treatment, both ACA12 and ACA13 transcripts accumulated to higher levels in the aca8 aca10 double mutant background, whereas no significant differences and a slight up-regulation in ACA12 and ACA13 abundance, respectively, were detected without MAMP stimulus (Fig. 4). Thus, ACA12 and ACA13 may contribute to the control of cytosolic Ca2+ levels during flg22 responses. Intriguingly, ACA12 localizes to the plasma membrane and can interact with the RKs BRI1 and CLV1 (Fig. 1A). ACA12, however, failed to associate with FLS2, which may hamper any possible compensatory effects in flg22 responses. To examine a possible role of ACA8 and ACA10 in plant antibacterial immunity, all genotypes were spray inoculated with virulent PtoDC3000, an infection that is defeated utilizing the FLS2 pathway (CITATION). Bacterial growth and disease symptom development were monitored 3 and 5 d post inoculation, respectively. PtoDC3000 multiplied to high titers in aca8 and aca10 single mutants as well as in the aca8 aca10 double mutant, which was comparable to the titers detected in immunocompromised fls2 mutants (Fig. 5A). This enhanced susceptibility was reduced to wild-type levels in the transgenic ACA8-GFP complementation line. Moreover, the disease symptom development of aca8 and aca10 single and double mutants was correlated with the enhanced susceptibility phenotype (Fig. 5B). Despite 35S-driven ectopic expression of ACA8-GFP, no increased resistance against PtoDC3000 could be detected in the transgenic line. The aca8 and aca10 single mutants were as affected as the aca8 aca10 double mutant upon PtoDC3000 infection. Thus, ACA8 and ACA10, both individually and equally, contribute to plant immunity in bacterial infections. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! T-DNA lines for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ACA8 (GK-688H09) and ACA10 (GK-044H01) were obtained from the European Seed Stock Center Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (http://arabidopsis.info/), and the tilling ACA8Q70* line was obtained from the Seattle Tilling Project (http://tilling.fhcrc.org/). Homozygous insertions of all aca8, aca10, aca8 aca10, aca8Q70*, and aca8Q70* aca10 mutant plants were validated in the F2 populations by PCR and sequencing. 35S::ACA8-GFP, 35S::Aeq transgenic, and fls2 mutant lines were described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Homozygous crossed aca8 aca10 ACA8-GFP, aca8 Aeq, aca10 Aeq, aca8 aca10 Aeq, and fls2 Aeq were confirmed by PCR (all oligonucleotides used in this study are summarized in Supplemental Table S3). Arabidopsis plants grown on soil were kept under short-day conditions for 4 to 5 weeks. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in vitro on plates or in liquid containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and 1% Suc and kept under long-day conditions for 10 to 14 d. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were soil grown under long-day conditions for 4 to 5 weeks. FLS2-Yc, FLS2-Yn, BRI1-Yc, BRI1-Yn, CLV1-Yc, CLV1-Yn, ACA8-Yc, ACA8-Yn, ACA12-Yc, and ACA12-Yn constructs were made by PCR cloning the corresponding full-length cDNAs using Gateway technology in the pAMPAT destination vector series and introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 carrying the p19 silencing suppressor (CITATION; CITATION). Overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.1 in water supplemented with 100 Î¼m acetosyringone and inoculated into 4-week-old N. benthamiana leaves. Leaf samples were imaged at 1 d post inoculation using a Leica confocal TCS SP5 microscope with the Leica LAS AF system software. YFP emission and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected at emission spectra of 520 to 600 nm and 680 to 780 nm, respectively, after excitation at 488 nm. All samples were imaged with a 20Ã objective. Photographs were taken in line averaging of four scans. The same confocal settings were used to image all samples. Representative images of over three biological replicates are shown. FLS2-CFP, FLS2-YFP, ACA8-CFP, and ACA8-YFP constructs were PCR cloned as the corresponding full-length cDNAs using Gateway technology in the pCZN575 and pCZN576 vectors and improved sCFP3A and sYFP2 chromophore variants, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). Constructs were transfected into mesophyll protoplasts from soil-grown Arabidopsis Col-0 plants as described before (CITATION), which were prepared using the tape sandwich method (CITATION). FRET-FLIM measurements were performed using the Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP system combined with a Nikon TE 300 inverted microscope and a Hamamatsu R3809U MCP PMT (CITATION). FRET between CFP and YFP was detected by monitoring donor emission using a 470- to 500-nm band-pass filter. Images with a frame size of 64 Ã 64 pixels were acquired, and the average count rate was around 0.5 Ã 104 photons per second for an acquisition time of Â±120 s. Donor fluorescence lifetimes (CFP) were analyzed using SPCImage 3.10 software (Becker & Hickl) using a one- and two-component decay model. Average fluorescence lifetimes of different combinations in several cells (n > 10) along the plasma membrane were calculated (Supplemental Table S1). The statistical significance of differences between donor-only and donor-acceptor combinations was determined using Studentâs t test. Twelve-day-old sterile-grown seedlings in liquid medium were supplied with 100 ÂµL of MS medium containing 10 Âµm coelenterazine (Biosynth) and dark incubated overnight. Seedlings were supplied with 100 ÂµL of fresh MS medium and dark incubated for 30 min. Aeq measurements were performed using the Centro LB960 luminometer system (Berthold Technologies). Luminescence from single wells was detected over 0.25 s, and each well was measured every 30 s After 2 min of measurement, flg22 (EZBiolab) and chitin (Sigma) were added to final concentrations of 1 Âµm or 0.1 mg mLâ1, respectively, and luminescence was measured over 40 min. For calculation of Ca2+ concentrations, 100 ÂµL of 2 m CaCl2 in 20% ethanol was added and luminescence was measured over 30 min (0.25 s per well every 63 s). Ca2+ concentrations were calculated according to CITATION. Differences in Aeq levels due to transgene expression and seedling size were corrected by calculating Ca2+ concentrations and not using luminescence counts. Per treatment, two assays of eight individual wells were averaged. Ca2+ transients were compared between treatments within one experiment unless stated otherwise. Significant differences were evaluated using ANOVA with Tukeyâs honestly significant difference test. Leaf discs of 5-week-old plants were used for ROS measurements as described previously (CITATION). Oxidative burst was elicited with 100 nm flg22 or 100 Î¼g mLâ1 chitin oligosaccharide; a negative control without MAMP elicitation was included in all experiments. Luminescence was measured over time using an ICCD photon-counting camera (Photek). For western blotting, proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry transfer system, followed by blocking in 5% milk or 3% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), anti-FLS2 (CITATION; 1:5,000), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Sigma; 1:20,000â1:30,000). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using the CDP-Star (Roche). For MAPK assay, 14-d-old seedlings grown on MS plates were sprayed with 2 Î¼m flg22 for 0, 5, 15, or 60 min before harvest. A total of 100 mg of plant material was ground and solubilized in 200 Î¼L of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO3, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Tween 20) supplied with 3.4 Î¼L per 100 mg fresh weight protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Extracts were centrifuged, solubilized by 5 min of boiling in 2% SDS Laemmli buffer, and equal amounts were loaded onto SDS gels. MAPK activation was detected with anti-p42/44 MAPK antibodies. For quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis, 14-d-old sterile-grown seedlings were untreated or treated with 1 Âµm flg22 for 1 or 24 h. RNA was extracted and DNA digested using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). A total of 2 Âµg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the SuperScript II enzyme (Invitrogen). One microliter of a 10Ã dilution of the cDNA was used for each quantitative PCR, using a Bio-Rad iQ5 apparatus and SYBR Green I detection. All oligonucleotides used in this study are summarized in Supplemental Table S3. Four-week-old soil-grown (Jiffy pellets) Arabidopsis plants were surface inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 bacteria at 108 colony-forming units mLâ1 and sampled at 3 d post inoculation. Two leaf discs were pooled from six individual plants, and bacterial extraction was done as described before (CITATION). The results of three independent experiments were combined, and t test analysis was performed.
