!~ABS~! Upon recognition of bacterial flagellin, the plant receptor FLS2 heterodimerizes with brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) and activates plant defense responses. Because constitutive activation of defense responses is detrimental, plant resistance signaling pathways must be negatively controlled, although the mechanisms involved are unclear. We identified Arabidopsis BIR1 as a BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase. Knocking out BIR1 leads to extensive cell death, activation of constitutive defense responses, and impairment in the activation of MPK4, a negative regulator of plant resistance (R) protein signaling, by flagellin. sobir1-1, a mutant obtained in a screen for suppressors of the bir1-1 phenotype, rescued cell death observed in bir1-1. SOBIR1 encodes another receptor-like kinase whose overexpression activates cell death and defense responses. Our data suggest that BIR1 negatively regulates multiple plant resistance signaling pathways, one of which is the SOBIR1-dependent pathway identified here.
!~RES~! To identify important regulators of plant innate immunity, we carried out systematic reverse genetics analysis of genes whose transcript levels increased significantly 48 hr after inoculation with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (P.s.m.) ES4326 (OD600 = 0.001). From initial analysis of homozygous knockout mutants of 200 genes (CITATION), one mutant was found to have a seedling lethality phenotype when grown at 22°C ( CITATIONA), and none of the other T-DNA mutants has similar phenotypes. The mutant contains a T-DNA insertion in the third exon of At5g48380, which encodes an RLK (CITATIONB). We focused our analysis on this mutant because it has dramatic phenotypes, and At5g48380 encodes an interesting protein most likely functioning in signal transduction. We later named it BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase 1 (BIR1) due to its association with BAK1. BIR1 belongs to the LRRX group of RLKs (CITATION) with 620 amino acids and 5 LRRs. RT-PCR analysis of BIR1 transcript in bir1-1 mutant plants showed that the full-length cDNA of BIR1 was no longer expressed (CITATIONA). Real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that BIR1 is indeed induced by bacterial infection (CITATIONB). To determine whether the mutant phenotypes in bir1-1 are caused by the T-DNA insertion, two additional T-DNA lines (SALK_008775 and WiscDsLox341G08) with insertions in the promoter region of At5g48380 were analyzed. The expression of At5g48380 is not affected by the T-DNA insertions, and no obvious mutant phenotype was observed in these two lines. So we transformed the wild-type BIR1 gene into the bir1-1 mutant to test whether it can complement the mutant phenotypes. As shown in CITATIONA, the wild-type BIR1 reverted bir1-1 completely back to wild-type, confirming that the seedling lethality phenotype was caused by the T-DNA insertion in BIR1. In addition, silencing At5g48380 in wild-type background using artificial miRNA also caused a seedling lethality phenotype (data not shown). Trypan blue staining was performed on mutant seedlings to test whether cell death occurred in bir1-1. Extensive cell death was found in both cotyledons and true leaves of the mutant plants, particularly along the veins (CITATIONA). We also performed 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining on the bir1-1 mutant seedlings. Strong staining was observed in bir1-1 mutant plants (CITATIONB), indicating that the mutant seedlings accumulated high levels of H2O2 compared to the wild-type seedlings. To test whether defense responses were constitutively activated in bir1-1, salicylic acid (SA) levels in bir1-1 and wild-type plants were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. bir1-1 plants accumulated about 6-fold more free SA and about 20-fold more total SA (free SA plus glucose-conjugated SA) than wild-type controls (CITATIONC). In addition, high levels of PR-1 and PR-2 were constitutively expressed in the mutant plants without induction (CITATIOND and 1E). To test whether bir1-1 mutant has enhanced pathogen resistance, bir1-1 seedlings were challenged with the virulent oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica Noco2 (H. p. Noco2). As shown in CITATIONF, bir1-1 seedlings displayed strong enhanced resistance against H. p. Noco2, suggesting that defense responses were constitutively activated in the bir1-1 mutant plants. Interestingly, the seedling lethality phenotype of bir1-1 can be partially suppressed by growing the plants at high temperatures. bir1-1 plants grown on soil at 28°C remain small, but can complete their life cycle and set seeds. When grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium at 27°C, bir1-1 plants were significantly bigger than those grown at 22°C (CITATIONA). Constitutive expression of PR-1 and PR-2 was also reduced at 27°C (CITATIONB and S4C). To test whether all the bir1-1 mutant phenotypes are caused by the T-DNA insertion in BIR1, bir1-1 plants transformed with a genomic clone of BIR1 were further analyzed in regards to its defense phenotypes. The wild-type BIR1 complements the cell death phenotypes of bir1-1 and suppressed the H2O2 accumulation in bir1-1 (CITATIONA). The expression of PR-1 and PR-2 in the transgenic plants also reverted to wild-type levels (CITATIONB and S5C). In addition, the transgenic plants are no longer resistant to H. p. Noco2 (CITATIOND). Thus, all the mutant phenotypes observed in bir1-1 can be complemented by BIR1. To test whether BIR1 is an active protein kinase, the BIR1 cytoplasmic kinase domain was expressed in E. coli and tested for autophosphorylation activity. As shown in CITATIONA, the BIR1 kinase domain has autophosphorylation activity, indicating that BIR1 is an active protein kinase. To determine whether the kinase activity is important for its biological function, a mutant form of BIR1 kinase domain was created by mutating a conserved lysine (K331) to a glutamic acid (E331). This amino acid substitution was known to abolish kinase activity of other known RLKs (CITATION). The autophosphorylation activity of BIR1 kinase domain is dramatically reduced by the point mutation (CITATIONA). The K331E mutation was also introduced into a cDNA clone of BIR1. While wild-type BIR1 cDNA can fully complement the bir1-1 mutant phenotypes, the mutated gene can only partially complement the phenotypes of bir1-1 (CITATIONB), suggesting that the kinase activity of BIR1 is important for its function. To determine the localization of the BIR1, Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected with a construct expressing the BIR1-GFP fusion protein under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. As shown in CITATIONA, the BIR1-GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting that BIR1 is a plasma membrane protein. To identify proteins associated with BIR1, we generated transgenic plants expressing BIR1-3×FLAG fusion protein under its native promoter in the bir1-1 mutant background. bir1-1 plants expressing the BIR1-3×FLAG fusion protein displayed wild-type morphology (CITATIONA), suggesting that the fusion protein is as functional as wild-type BIR1. A quantitative proteomics approach was previously used to identify specific components of protein complexes using isotope-coded affinity tag reagents and mass spectrometry (CITATION). To identify proteins specifically interacting with BIR1, we modified this method by labeling the protein in vivo using 15N medium (CITATION). The transgenic plants were plated on 1/2 MS plates with 15N-labeled KNO3 and NH4NO3 as sole nitrogen source while wild-type control plants were grown on regular 1/2 MS plates with 14N KNO3 and NH4NO3. After the seedlings were harvested, equal amounts of tissue from the transgenic plants and wild-type controls were mixed together for membrane isolation. Total protein from the membrane fraction was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose beads to selectively immunoprecipitate the FLAG-tagged BIR1. Proteins coimmunoprecipitated with BIR1-3×FLAG were subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry. As shown in CITATION, one of the peptides (LADGTLVAVK) identified is enriched in the 15N fraction, suggesting that it is most likely from proteins specifically coimmunoprecipitated with BIR1-3×FLAG. Database search showed that this peptide is present in BAK1 and its close homologs SERK1 and SERK2. Probably due to low abundance of the BAK1 and SERK proteins, this peptide was the only one identified by mass spectrometry from these proteins. We did not find any other RLKs that specifically coimmunoprecipitate with BIR1-3×FLAG. Next, we utilized a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach (CITATION) to test whether interactions between BAK1 and BIR1 can be visualized in vivo. In this experiment, BAK1 was fused to the N-terminal fragment of YFP (BAK1-YFPN) while BIR1 was fused to the C-terminal fragment of YFP (BIR1-YFPC). If BAK1 and BIR1 associate with each other, a fluorescent YFP complex would be formed. As shown in CITATIONB (top panel), YFP fluorescence was observed on the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis protoplasts cotransformed with the BAK1-YFPN and BIR1-YFPC constructs, suggesting that BAK1 and BIR1 interact with each other. We further tested the interactions between BIR1 and the BAK1 homologs, including BKK1, SERK1, and SERK2, using BiFC and found that BIR1 also interacts with these proteins on the plasma membrane. When the BIR1-YFPC construct was cotransformed with BRI1-YFPN, FLS2-YFPN, or CLV1-YFPN constructs, no YFP fluorescence was observed, suggesting that BIR1 does not interact with other RLKs like BRI1, FLS2, or CLV1. This is consistent with our observation that flg22-mediated growth inhibitions were not affected by the bir1-1 mutation (CITATIONA). bak1 and other BR mutants often have shorter hypocotyls when grown in the dark. Unlike the bak1-4 seedlings, elongation of hypocotyls in bir1-1 pad4-1 is similar to that in wild-type plants (CITATIONB). Since cell death and defense responses were activated in both bir1-1 and bak1 bkk1 mutant plants and RLKs often function through heterodimerization, additional co-IP analysis was carried out to confirm the in vivo interactions between BIR1 and BAK1. First, a construct expressing BAK1-3×FLAG protein in pCambia1305 under its native promoter was transformed into plants homozygous for bkk1 and heterozygous for bak1. bak1 bkk1 homozygous plants carrying the transgene were identified in the T2 generation, and they were found to exhibit wild-type morphology, suggesting that the 3×FLAG tags did not affect BAK1 function. Co-IP using anti-FLAG agarose beads was subsequently performed on total membrane proteins of these transgenic plants expressing the BAK1-3×FLAG fusion protein. As shown in CITATIONC, BIR1 coimmunoprecipitated with 3×FLAG-tagged BAK1, indicating that BIR1 and BAK1 interact in vivo. As a negative control, immunoprecipitated proteins were also probed with an anti-FLS2 antibody, and no FLS2 was detected in the immunoprecipitated proteins (data not shown). We also performed co-IP analysis using Arabidopsis protoplasts cotransformed with epitope-tagged BIR1 and BAK1. As BIR1 proteins with C-terminal 3×FLAG tags or GFP tag can complement the bir1-1 mutant phenotypes (CITATION), the tags were fused to the C terminus of BIR1. When total protein from Arabidopsis protoplasts cotransfected with constructs expressing HA-tagged BIR1 and FLAG-tagged BAK1 proteins was incubated with anti-HA Sepharose beads to selectively immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged BIR1, BAK1 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged BIR1, while BAK1 was not immunoprecipitated by itself (CITATIOND). The total protein from protoplasts cotransfected with the constructs expressing HA-tagged BIR1 and FLAG-tagged BAK1 protein was also incubated with anti-FLAG beads to immunoprecipitate the FLAG-tagged BAK1. As shown in CITATIONE, BIR1 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged BAK1 while BIR1 was not immunoprecipitated by itself, further confirming that BIR1 and BAK1 interact in vivo. To test whether R protein-mediated resistance responses are activated in the bir1-1 mutant, bir1-1 was crossed to mutants carrying mutations in positive regulators of R protein-mediated defense, including ndr1-1, eds1-1, and pad4-1. As shown in CITATIONA, bir1-1 pad4-1 and bir1-1 eds1-1 double mutant plants are much bigger than the bir1-1 single mutant plants, indicating that bir1-1 activates the EDS1 and PAD4-dependent resistance pathway. Interestingly, the bir1-1 ndr1-1 double mutant is also bigger than the bir1-1 single mutant (CITATIONA), indicating that the NDR1-dependent resistance pathway may also be activated in the bir1-1 mutant. The effect of eds1-1, pad4-1, and ndr1-1 on the size of bir1-1 was confirmed by determining the plant biomass of bir1-1 single mutant and the double mutants (CITATIONA). Although these double mutants are bigger than bir1-1, they still cannot grow to maturity and set seeds at 22°C. To determine whether cell death in bir1-1 is dependent on NDR1, EDS1, and PAD4, trypan blue staining was performed on the double mutants. As shown in CITATIONB (upper panel), the double mutants have significantly less cell death compared to the bir1-1 single mutant. In addition, accumulation of H2O2 is reduced in the double mutants (CITATIONB, lower panel). Constitutive expression of PR-1 and PR-2 in bir1-1 was also reduced by mutations in PAD4, EDS1, and NDR1 to different degrees (CITATIONC and 3D). Analysis of resistance to H. p. Noco2 in the double mutants indicates that constitutive resistance to H. p. Noco2 in bir1-1 was partially compromised by mutations in PAD4 and EDS1 but not by the mutation in NDR1 (CITATIONE). We conclude that knocking out BIR1 results in activation of multiple resistance pathways that are also activated during R protein-mediated resistance. SA is an important signal molecule downstream of R protein-mediated resistance responses and mutations in EDS5, and SID2 blocks pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis (CITATION). NPR1 is an essential positive regulator downstream of SA (CITATION). To test whether the bir1-1 mutant phenotypes are dependent on the SA pathway, bir1-1 was crossed with eds5-3, sid2-1, and npr1-3. Both eds5-3 and sid2-1 can partially rescue the bir1-1 mutant phenotypes (CITATIONA), suggesting that high levels of SA are partly responsible for the bir1-1 mutant phenotype. The effect of eds5-3, sid2-1, and npr1-3 on the size of bir1-1 was confirmed by determining the plant biomass of bir1-1 and the double mutants (CITATIONB). In addition, cell death in bir1-1 is partially blocked by the eds5-3, sid2-1, and npr1-3 mutations (CITATIONB). Accumulation of H2O2 is also reduced in the double mutants (CITATIONB). Analysis of PR gene expression in the double mutant plants showed that constitutive expression of PR-1 in bir1-1 was dramatically reduced by mutations in SID2, EDS5, and NPR1 (CITATIONC and S11E), but the expression of PR-2 was not affected by these mutations (CITATIOND and S11F). When the double mutant plants were tested for resistance to H. p. Noco2, no significant difference was observed between bir1-1 and the double mutants (CITATIONG). Like the bir1-1 mutant, knockout mutants of Arabidopsis MEKK1 that encode a MAP kinase kinase kinase have temperature-dependent cell death and constitutive activation of defense responses (CITATION). The mpk4 single mutants and mkk1 mkk2 double mutants were also shown to exhibit temperature-dependent cell death and constitutive activation of defense responses (CITATION). It was suggested that MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2, and MPK4 form a MAP kinase cascade to negatively regulate R protein-mediated resistance pathways. To test whether BIR1 is required for the activation of MPK4 in response to flg22, we analyzed the kinase activity of MPK4 from wild-type and bir1-1 plants grown at 22°C. Myelin-basic protein was used as substrate for the assay. As shown in CITATIONA, treatment with flg22 resulted in quick activation of MPK4 in wild-type plants but not in the bir1-1 mutant, suggesting that activation of MPK4 by flg22 is inhibited in the bir1-1 mutant. In contrast, both MPK3 and MPK6 are still activated in the bir1-1 mutant (CITATIONB). We further tested the activation of MPK4 in plants grown at 27°C. Interestingly, activation of MPK4 by flg22 is restored in bir1-1 plants at 27°C (CITATIONC), suggesting that inhibition of MPK4 activation in bir1-1 is temperature dependent. To identify additional components required for cell-death and resistance pathways activated in bir1-1, we performed a genetic screen to find mutations that suppress the seedling lethality phenotype of bir1-1. Mutants that can grow to maturity and set seeds at 22°C were identified in the M2 population of ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-mutagenized bir1-1 pad4-1 double mutant. A total of 30 mutants were identified as sobir (suppressor of bir1-1) mutants. sobir1-1 is one of the most complete suppressors and was analyzed in detail. sobir1-1 bir1-1 pad4-1 mutant plants displayed wild-type morphology ( CITATIONA). Enhanced resistance to H. p. Noco2 in bir1-1 pad4-1 was also blocked by the sobir1-1 mutation (CITATION). To map the sobir1-1 mutation, sobir1-1 bir1-1 pad4-1 (in the Columbia ecotype background) was crossed with Landsberg plants to generate a segregating F2 population. Crude mapping showed that the sobir1-1 mutation is in a region between marker T16B12 and F4P9 on chromosome 2. Further fine mapping narrowed the sobir1-1 mutation to a region of about 130 kb between markers F20M17 and F22D22 (CITATIONB). To identify the molecular lesion in sobir1-1, a set of PCR fragments covering the region were amplified from sobir1-1 bir1-1 pad4-1 and sequenced. Comparing the sequences from the mutant with the Arabidopsis genome sequence revealed a single C to T mutation in At2g31880. This mutation introduces an early stop codon in the protein. Blast analysis shows that At2g31880 encodes an RLK with four extracellular LRRs and a cytoplasmic kinase domain, suggesting that it could be involved in signal perception and transduction (CITATIONC). A phylogenetic tree including FLS2, BAK1, BIR1, and this protein is shown in CITATION. The 3′ UTR of At2g31880 (also named SRRLK [small RNA-generating RLK]) was previously shown to be involved in the generation of natural antisense transcript-associated siRNAs (CITATION). To determine whether the other sobir mutants also contain mutations in At2g31880, DNA of At2g31880 was amplified from the other 29 mutants by PCR and sequenced. Ten additional sobir1 mutants were found to contain mutations in At2g31880 (CITATIOND and CITATION). Five of these mutants (from sobir1-1 to sobir1-5 in the bir1-1 pad4-1 mutant background) were crossed with sobir1-1 bir1-1 pad4-1 to test whether they are allelic to sobir1-1. No cell death was observed in the F1 plants, and all F1 plants grew to maturity and set seeds. These data suggest that SOBIR1 is At2g31880. To determine whether sobir1-1 can suppress the bir1-1 mutant phenotypes without the presence of pad4-1, the sobir1-1 bir1-1 pad4-1 triple mutant was crossed with wild-type Columbia, and the sobir1-1 bir1-1 double mutant was identified from the F2 progeny. Unlike bir1-1 mutant plants, the sobir1-1 bir1-1 double mutant can grow to maturity and set seeds at 22°C. As shown in CITATIONA, the sobir1-1 bir1-1 double mutant is much bigger than the bir1-1 single mutant, but smaller than the wild-type plants, suggesting that sobir1-1 and pad4-1 have additive effects on suppression of the bir1-1 morphology. To determine whether cell death was blocked in the sobir1-1 bir1-1 double mutant, trypan blue staining was performed on the mutant seedlings. As shown in CITATIONB, cell death in bir1-1 was blocked by the sobir1-1 mutation. In addition, H2O2 accumulation in bir1-1 is partially affected by the sobir1-1 mutation (CITATIONB). Expression of both PR-1 and PR-2 in bir1-1 is also significantly reduced by the sobir1-1 mutation (CITATIONC and 6D). To test whether SOBIR1 is required for basal resistance, a knockout mutant of SOBIR1 (sobir1-12) was challenged with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (P.s.t.) DC3000. As shown in CITATIONE, sobir1-12 did not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to P.s.t. DC3000. Similarly, resistance to P.s.t. DC3000 carrying AvrRPS4 or AvrRPT2 was not affected in the mutant either (CITATIONF and 6G), suggesting that SOBIR1 functions as a specific regulator of resistance activated by the bir1 mutation. As BIR1 interacts with BAK1 and SOBIR1 encodes an RLK with similar structure as BAK1, we tested whether responses to flg22 are affected in the sobir1 single mutants. As shown in CITATION, the sobir1 mutant plants displayed similar responses to flg22 as wild-type plants, suggesting that SOBIR1 is not required for flg22-mediated resistance responses. We also tested whether SOBIR1 interacts with BIR1 using BiFC analysis. No interaction was found between SOBIR1 and BIR1 (CITATION). In addition, SOBIR1 and BIR1 did not interact with each other in yeast two-hybrid analysis (data not shown). Since loss of SOBIR1 function suppresses cell death in bir1-1, SOBIR1 could be a positive regulator of cell death and innate immunity. To determine whether overexpression of SOBIR1 activates defense responses, transgenic plants expressing SOBIR1 under cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. Two representative lines, one with relatively low level of SOBIR1 expression and one with high level of SOBIR1 expression, were analyzed in detail. As shown in CITATIONA, SOBIR1 expression is about 5-fold higher in line #1 and 70-fold higher in line #2 compared to the wild-type. The cotyledons of line #2 but not line #1 die after germination. Trypan blue staining showed that cell death occurred in the cotyledon of line #2, but not in line #1 and the wild-type plants (CITATIONB), suggesting that overexpression of SOBIR1 leads to activation of cell death. At 22°C, plants from line #2 overexpressing SOBIR1 die when they are about 5–6 weeks old. The cell death in line #2 can be partially suppressed by high temperatures, and plants grown at 28°C can set seeds. As shown in CITATIONC and 7D, both PR-1 and PR-2 are constitutively upregulated in line #2 compared to the wild-type plants. Line #2 also displayed enhanced resistance to P.s.t. DC3000 (CITATIONE), suggesting that overexpression of SOBIR1 leads to constitutive activation of pathogen-resistance responses.
!~MM~! Plants were grown at 22°C under 16 hr light/8 hr dark. Seeds of bir1-1 (WiscDsLox393-396D17) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Stock Center (ABRC; Ohio State University; Columbus, OH). The homozygous plants were obtained by PCR using primers BIR1-179F and BIR1-891R. To generate various double mutants, the bir1-1/BIR1 heterozygous plants were crossed with homozygous pad4-1, eds1-1, ndr1-1, sid2-1, eds5-3, and npr1-3. The F1 plants heterozygous for bir1-1 T-DNA were identified by PCR. Double mutant plants were identified in the F2 progeny by PCR. For complementation analysis, a 4.6 kb genomic DNA fragment containing BIR1 was amplified by PCR using primers BIR1-GF and BIR1-GR and cloned into binary vector pCAMBIA1300 to create pCAMBIA1300-BIR1g. A similar genomic DNA fragment lacking the stop codon and 3′-UTR region was amplified by PCR using primers BIR1-GF and BIR1-FLAG-R and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1305 vector with a 3×FLAG tag to obtain pCAMBIA1305-BIR1-3×FLAG for expressing the BIR1 3×FLAG-tag fusion protein under its native promoter. To confirm that the phenotypes observed in bir1-1 were caused by mutation in BIR1, pCAMBIA1300-BIR1g and pCAMBIA1305-BIR1-3×FLAG were transformed into Agrobacterium and subsequently into the BIR1/bir1-1 heterozygous plants by floral dipping (CITATION). Homozygous bir1-1 plants carrying the transgene were identified in the T2 generation with Hygromycin selection and PCR. For BiFC study, the BIR1, BAK1, BKK1, SERK1, SERK2, BRI1, and CLV1 cDNA were amplified by RT-PCR from wild-type Columbia. BIR1 was cloned into pUC-SPYCE to obtain pBIR1-YCE using primers BIR1-YCE-F and BIR1-FLAG-R. BAK1, BKK1, SERK1, and SERK2 were cloned into pUC-SPYNE to obtain pBAK1-YNE, pBKK1-YNE, pSERK1-YNE, and pSERK2-YNE using primers BAK1-YNE-F, BAK1-YNE-R, BKK1-YNE-F, BKK1-YNE-R, SERK1-YNE-F, SERK1-YNE-R, SERK2-YNE-F, and SERK2-YNE-R. BRI1 and CLV1 were also cloned into pUC-SPYNE to obtain pBRI1-YNE and pCLV1-YNE using primers BRI1-F, BRI1-R, CLV1-F, and CLV1-R. pFLS2-YNE was kindly provided by Dr. Zhou Jianmin. The BIR1 and BAK1 cDNA were also amplified for making constructs for co-IP analysis. BIR1 was cloned into pUC-3xHA with 35S promoter to create pBIR1-3HA using primers BIR1-A and BIR1-FLAG-R. BAK1 was cloned to pUC-3×FLAG with 35S promoter to obtain pBAK1-3×FLAG using primers BAK1-A and BAK1-B. For localization analysis, BIR1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers BIR1-GFP-A and BIR1-FLAG-R and cloned into pCAMBIA1300-35S-GFP to obtain p35S-BIR1-GFP. For overexpression of SOBIR1, the SOBIR1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1300 vector with 35S promoter to obtain p35S-SOBIR1. Sequences of primers used are listed in CITATION. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For transient expression of the YFPN and YFPC fusion proteins, constructs expressing BIR1-YFPC, BAK1-YFPN, and various control proteins were cotransfected into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts according to a previously described protocol (CITATION). YFP fluorescence was observed by confocal microscopy. For co-IP analysis of interactions between BIR1 and BAK1, Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts or membrane fractions of plant seedlings were extracted in extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1× PI cocktail). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, anti-HA antibody (Roche) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. Twenty microliters of protein A Sepharose beads (Sigma) were subsequently added and incubated for another 3 hr at 4°C. After washing the beads eight times with extraction buffer, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blot analyses. The polyclonal anti-BIR1 antibody was generated in rabbit using a fragment of the BIR1 kinase domain-expressed E. coli. The antibody detects a protein about 80 kDa specifically present in wild-type plants. Seeds of bir1-1 pad4-1 were obtained by growing the plants at 28°C and mutagenized with EMS. About 12,000 M2 plants were screened to identify mutants that can grow to maturity and set seeds at 22°C. The sobir1-1 bir1-1 pad4-1 mutant was backcrossed with wild-type Columbia. The sobir1-1 single mutant and the sobir1-1 bir1-1 double mutant were identified among the F2 progeny by PCR genotyping. Expression of PR genes was analyzed as previously described (CITATION). Trypan blue and DAB staining were performed on 2-week-old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium according to previously described procedures (CITATION).
