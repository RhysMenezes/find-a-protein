!~ABS~! In flowering plants, sperm cells develop in the pollen cytoplasm and are transported through floral tissues to an ovule by a pollen tube, a highly polarized cellular extension. After targeting an ovule, the pollen tube bursts, releasing two sperm that fertilize an egg and a central cell. Here, we identified the gene encoding Arabidopsis HAP2, demonstrating that it is allelic to GCS1. HAP2 is expressed only in the haploid sperm and is required for efficient pollen tube guidance to ovules. We identified an insertion (hap2-1) that disrupts the C-terminal portion of the protein and tags mutant pollen grains with the β-glucuronidase reporter. By monitoring reporter expression, we showed that hap2-1 does not diminish pollen tube length in vitro or in the pistil, but it reduces ovule targeting by twofold. In addition, we show that the hap2 sperm that are delivered to ovules fail to initiate fertilization. HAP2 is predicted to encode a protein with an N-terminal secretion signal, a single transmembrane domain and a C-terminal histidine-rich domain. These results point to a dual role for HAP2, functioning in both pollen tube guidance and in fertilization. Moreover, our findings suggest that sperm, long considered to be passive cargo, are involved in directing the pollen tube to its target.
!~RES~! We used the LAT52:GUS pollen-specific reporter gene, which highlights the cytoplasm of every hap2-1 pollen tube, to refine our analysis of the hap2 pollen tube-growth and pollen tube-guidance phenotype. To determine whether hap2 pollen tubes have inherent growth defects, we germinated hap2-1/HAP2 pollen in vitro and stained them for GUS activity to differentiate between mutant and wild-type pollen (Fig. 1A). hap2 pollen tube germination was not affected (hap2-1, 85%, n=80; HAP2, 88%, n=81) and, after 3 hours of growth in vitro, hap2-1 pollen tubes were as long as those of wild type (hap2-1, mean 418 μm, s.d. 217 μm, n=62; HAP2, mean 372 μm, s.d. 195 μm, n=62).   [[FIGURE]] ms1 stigmas were pollinated with hap2-1/HAP2 pollen to analyze pollen tube growth in the pistil. At 5 hours after pollination, the longest hap2-1 pollen tubes had extended through 58% of the ovary (s.d. 12%), whereas the longest HAP2 pollen tubes had grown 35% of the length of the ovary (s.d. 4%; n=4 pistils). At 10 hours after pollination, hap2 and wild-type tubes had traveled through 81% (s.d. 4%) and 75% (s.d. 10%) of the pistil, respectively (n=4 pistils). These data indicate that hap2-1 does not limit pollen tube growth and that the inability to target ovules is attributable to a defect in the perception of pollen tube-guidance cues. To define the stage at which hap2 pollen tubes fail, we monitored the path of hap2-1 pollen tubes in the ovary and determined the frequency with which hap2-1 pollen tubes successfully enter a micropyle and burst. At 14 hours after hand-pollinating ms1 pistils with control anthers heterozygous for the LAT52:GUS reporter, GUS activity was observed in the synergid cells of approximately half of the ovules, as expected (116/234, 50%, Fig. 1B,C). By contrast, when hap2-1/HAP2 anthers were used, a smaller proportion of GUS+ pollen tubes entered a micropyle and burst (115/505, 23%; Fig. 1B,D). Furthermore, hap2-1 pollen tubes were observed growing on portions of the ovule where wild-type pollen tubes do not grow (Fig. 1E) and also stalled on the funiculus (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that hap2 pollen tubes have a diminished capacity to enter the micropyle and burst within synergids (∼50% reduction from wild type) because of defects in funicular and/or micropylar guidance. The hap2 ovule-targeting defect was not suppressed when competition from wild-type pollen tubes was decreased. We pollinated wild-type pistils with single hap2-1/HAP2 tetrads and, after 14 hours, fixed and stained the pistils with Aniline Blue to follow the route of hap2-1 and HAP2 pollen tubes. With a control tetrad donor, 100% of the pollen tubes that germinated were able to target and enter an ovule (n=35). By contrast, 69/89 (78%) of the pollen tubes from single hap2-1/HAP2 tetrads targeted an ovule, a significant difference from wild type (P<0.05, χ2). These experiments indicate that only half of hap2 pollen tubes reached their target - the same result as that obtained with excess pollinations. Thus, the observed hap2 pollen tube-guidance defect is not caused by an inability to compete with wild-type pollen tubes for access to ovules, but rather reflects an inherent pollen tube-guidance defect. When hap2-1 or hap2-2 pollen were used to pollinate wild-type pistils, no mutant progeny were recovered (hap2-1, 363 F1 tested; hap2-2, 348 F1 tested), indicating that hap2 completely blocks transmission of the mutant allele through the male. Because hap2 disrupts pollen tube guidance, we addressed whether competition for available ovules from HAP2 pollen tubes masks rare hap2 fertilization events by performing limiting pollinations of wild-type pistils. We obtained 87 F1 seeds from ten crosses: none inherited the hap2-1 allele. This absolute block in transmission through pollen cannot be explained by an approximately 50% reduction in the ability of hap2 pollen tubes to target ovules. Therefore, hap2 must also disrupt a step in reproduction that occurs after the contents of the pollen tube are released into the synergid cell of the FG. We examined the development of seeds in self-fertilized hap2/HAP2 flowers and found that, hap2-1/HAP2 plants averaged 37±7 seeds (742 seeds in total, 20 siliques), whereas HAP2/HAP2 plants average 56±8 seeds (564 seeds in total, ten siliques). hap2-1/HAP2 siliques had gaps (Fig. 2A,B) where ovules failed to develop into seeds, suggesting that the FGs in ovules targeted by hap2 pollen tubes do not get fertilized. To test this hypothesis, we pollinated wild-type pistils with hap2-1/HAP2 pollen, allowed 48 hours for fertilization, early embryo and endosperm development, and then stained them for GUS activity to identify ovules that had been targeted by hap2-1 pollen tubes. Ovules targeted by HAP2 pollen tubes (no GUS activity) contained early globular embryos and obvious proliferation of endosperm nuclei (122/132 ovules analyzed were fertilized; Fig. 2D). By contrast, ovules targeted by hap2-1 pollen tubes (GUS activity in the synergid cell indicating that the pollen tube cytoplasm and sperm had been deposited) showed no indication of embryo or endosperm development (0/26 ovules analyzed were fertilized; Fig. 2F). Instead, we consistently observed only the unfertilized central cell nucleus in FGs targeted by hap2-1 pollen tubes. We analyzed 112 unstained ovules in wild-type pistils pollinated with hap2-1/HAP2 pollen and found that 18% contained only one central cell nucleus (Fig. 2G), and that the remaining 82% contained an embryo and several endosperm nuclei (Fig. 2E); these values are consistent with the rate of hap2-1 ovule targeting and, when combined with the data from GUS-stained ovules, suggest that when hap2 sperm are released into the FG, they fail to fertilize the egg and central cell.   [[FIGURE]] One of the two synergid cells degenerates either just before or at the same time as the pollen tube enters the micropyle (CITATION). In ovules targeted by hap2 pollen tubes, the central cell nucleus is the only FG nucleus that remains 48 hours after pollination. We hypothesized that, in the absence of fertilization, the egg nucleus degenerates and that the second synergid degenerates shortly after the pollen tube bursts. Analysis of embryo and endosperm development at an earlier time point (24 hours after pollination) showed that both the egg and central cell remain in ovules targeted by hap2 pollen tubes (Fig. 2H), whereas an embryo and endosperm nuclei are clearly present in ovules targeted by HAP2 pollen tubes (Fig. 2I). These results confirm that hap2 sperm are incapable of fertilizing the egg or central cell and suggest that, in the absence of fertilization, the egg cell degenerates following pollen tube reception. Similarly, Mori et al. found that gcs1 sperm fail to fertilize and that they persist in the degenerating synergid 16 hours after pollination, whereas wild-type sperm do not (CITATION). Presumably, wild-type sperm were not observed because they are rapidly transported to the egg and central cell where they bind these target cells and undergo plasmogamy. To determine whether the hap2 fertilization defect is due to a defect in sperm development or in migration of sperm within the pollen tube, we analyzed hap2 pollen grains and tubes throughout their development. DAPI-staining revealed morphologically normal sperm and vegetative nuclei (n>500, Fig. 3A-D). Staining hap2/HAP2 pollen tubes either with Aniline Blue, which binds callose (β-1-3-glucan) in the pollen tube walls, or FM 4-64, which becomes incorporated into the membrane architecture of growing tubes, showed that hap2 pollen tubes were indistinguishable from wild type (data not shown). In newly germinated tubes, the vegetative nucleus consistently exited the pollen grain before the two sperm (hap2/HAP2, n=24; control, n=19), and, as tubes elongated, the sperm and vegetative nuclei were always in the subapical region of the tube (hap2/HAP2, n=138; control, n=117). Within 1 hour after pollination, hap2 vegetative nuclei emerged from the pollen grain ahead of the two sperm (n=11); this normal male germ-unit organization was maintained as the tubes migrated through the transmitting tract (n=20). These results indicate that defects of hap2 pollen tube guidance and fertilization are not the result of aberrant pollen tube structure or sperm transport within the pollen tube.   [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] Previously, we used TAIL PCR to map the hap2-1 T-DNA insertion to the twelfth of 14 exons in the single-copy uncharacterized gene At4g11720 (Fig. 4A) (CITATION). No cDNAs or ESTs corresponding to this gene were present in public databases, so we used 5′ and 3′ RACE to generate a full-length cDNA and to annotate At4g11720, determining that the gene comprises 17 exons instead of the 14 predicted by the initial annotation of the Arabidopsis genome (GenBank DQ022676 and DQ022375; Fig. 4A). With PCR, we confirmed both hap2-1 T-DNA-genome junctions, as well as a 10 bp genomic deletion at the insertion site (exon 15). A second allele, hap2-2, with a T-DNA insertion in exon 9 (Fig. 4A) was identified from the SIGNAL collection (CITATION); this allele also caused distorted T-DNA segregation (46.2% KanR progeny from self-fertilization, n=600) and completely blocked transmission through pollen (0 KanR progeny when crossed with wild type, n=348). The location of the gcs1 allele is also indicated (Fig. 4A) (CITATION). To confirm that At4g11720 is indeed HAP2, we complemented the hap2 defect by transforming plants heterozygous for hap2-1 with a T-DNA carrying NPTII (conferring KanR) and a wild-type HAP2 transgene (HAP2tr, a genomic fragment from 983 bp upstream to 277 bp downstream of the open reading frame; Fig. 4A). The progeny of primary hap2/HAP2 transformants were collected and BastaR and KanR were analyzed in ten transgenic families with a single-locus insertion of HAP2tr. The average rate of BastaR among these families was 68.6% (n=2362) and of KanR was 83.1% (n=2525). Complementation of both ovule-targeting and fertilization defects is expected to yield T2 progeny that segregate 67% (8/12) BastaR and 83% (10/12) KanR; failure would lead to approximately 50% BastaR, as observed in the progeny of self-fertilizing hap2-1/HAP2 plants. These results indicate that wild-type At4g11720 rescues the hap2-1 pollen tube-guidance and fertilization defects. Self-fertilization of hap2/HAP2;HAP2tr plants yielded hap2/hap2 homozygous progeny (all four members of tetrad are GUS+), the progeny of which were 100% BastaR; homozygous progeny were never observed when hap2/HAP2 is self-fertilized.   [[FIGURE]] The HAP2 open reading frame is predicted to encode a 705 amino acid protein with a N-terminal signal sequence (amino acid 1-24), a single transmembrane domain (amino acid 560-582) and a C-terminal histidine-rich domain (Fig. 4B). HAP2 is not similar to any proteins with known functions and has no obvious functional motifs, although several genes in flowering plants and in more distantly related organisms have been described (CITATION). Pair-wise comparison of amino acid identity between the Arabidopsis HAP2 and HAP2 from other flowering plants showed that the N-terminal region is conserved (mean identity 64%), whereas the C-terminal region is more divergent (mean identity 35%). An alignment of the C-terminal histidine-rich regions showed that the presence of histidine is conserved among these proteins, but that amino acid sequence is not (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, these histidine-rich domains are present in HAP2 from angiosperms, but not from other organisms (Fig. 4D). RT-PCR and northern blot analysis showed that HAP2 mRNA is only detected in tissue samples that contain mature pollen (Fig. 5A,B). This specific expression pattern is confirmed by hundreds of publicly available microarray experiments showing that HAP2 mRNA only accumulates in pollen (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/). To determine the precise location of HAP2 expression, we fused a DNA fragment corresponding to 983 bp upstream of the HAP2 start codon (Fig. 4A) to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) coding sequence (HAP2promoter:YFP fusion protein) and generated transgenic plants expressing this construct. Accumulation of YFP was only observed in the two sperm cells contained within the cytoplasm of mature pollen grains (Fig. 5C,D); YFP was not observed in uninucleate microspores or in bicellular pollen (Fig. 5D), nor was it observed in other floral or vegetative cells (data not shown). Protein localization algorithms predict that HAP2 is localized to the plasma membrane and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To determine where HAP2 is localized within sperm, we fused YFP to the penultimate codon of HAP2 exon 17 (Fig. 4A, HAP2protein:YFP fusion protein) and generated transgenic plants expressing this construct. Three independent transgenic lines were crossed with hap2-1/HAP2 plants and homozygous hap2-1 lines were obtained in the F2 generation of each cross, indicating that HAP2protein:YFP complemented hap2 pollen tube-guidance and fertilization defects, and suggesting that HAP2protein:YFP forms a functional and properly localized protein. We detected the fusion protein only in the sperm cells (Fig. 6A-D). Unlike the transcriptional fusion, which produced YFP distributed throughout the elongated, spindle-shaped sperm cytoplasm (Fig. 5C), the protein fusion was excluded from the nucleus and was predominantly perinuclear, forming a ring of fluorescence around sperm nuclei (Fig. 6B). However, fluorescence was not limited to the perinuclear region and in many sperm cells, fluorescence extended to the sperm plasma membrane (Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). These results, in combination with protein-localization predictions, suggest that HAP2 is predominantly localized to sperm ER membranes and that HAP2 may also reside in other endomembranes, including the plasma membrane.
!~MM~! hap2-1, hap2-2 (Salk_152706) (CITATION) and control lines in the Col-0 background were grown at 21°C in 24-hour 100μ E fluorescent lighting or in ambient greenhouse conditions. Kanamycin resistance (KanR; hap2-2) was determined on MS salts with 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and BastaR (hap2-1) was determined as by Johnson et al. (CITATION). Plant transformation was performed as described (CITATION), selecting for growth on 50 μg/ml kanamycin or on soil with 1:2000 Liberty herbicide (AgrEvo, Pikeville NC). Limiting pollinations were performed with male sterile (ms1) pistils and hap2/HAP2 anthers; crosses producing 25 or fewer seeds were analyzed. The hap2-1 T-DNA-gene junction was confirmed with the PCR primers LB3 (CITATION), HAP2 upstream (5′-GGCCTCACTCGTTCTCAATTGGAG-3′) and HAP2 downstream (5′-GTGAGAGTCGCTGTGGTCACGTTC-3′). The hap2-2 T-DNA-gene junction was confirmed with the PCR primers LBa1 (CITATION) and HAP2seqTR3 (5′-CAATCAAACTGCGCAGAAGGAAGC-3′). Full-length HAP2 cDNA (GenBank DQ022375) was amplified from 200 ng total pollen RNA using primers F, 5′-AAACAATTTTCAATTCGCGTCTCCG-3′ and R, 5′-AACTCGGATATATTTTTGC-3′. For complementation, a genomic HAP2 fragment was PCR amplified with F, 5′-GGCCCTGCAGGTTCTGATCCTAACAACAACGGCGGC-3′, and R, 5′-CCGCCTGCAGGATATCTTCGAGAGAATCACCAGTCGCC-3′, inserted into the SbfI site of pCAMBIA2300 (GenBank AF234315), sequenced, introduced into Agrobacterium (strain GV3101), and transformed into hap2-1/HAP2 plants, selecting KanR. The Arabidopsis HAP2 coding sequence guided annotation of the Poplar ortholog from genomic sequence (Poptr1:63588; http://genome.jgi-psf.org). Other sequences were obtained from GenBank (accession number): Lilium longiflorum (AB206810), Oryza sativa (AK072871), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (AB206813), Cyanidioschyzon merolae (AP006493), Plasmodium falciparum (AAN35337), Physarum polycephalum (AB206812), Leishmania major (CP000081) (CITATION). Predicted proteins were aligned using ClustalW (MegAlign, DNAstar, Madison, WI), and structure and subcellular localization was predicted with PSORT (CITATION), TargetP (CITATION), Genoplante Predator (http://www.genoplante.com/content.php?idcontent=bioinfotools&lg=en), Prosite (http://us.expasy.org) and TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk). Pollen tube growth in pistils was analyzed as previously described (CITATION). For in vitro analyses, pollen from stage-14 flowers (CITATION) was germinated for 3 hours in an inverted drop of medium (CITATION). Pollen tubes or grains were transferred to polylysine-coated slides and stained with DAPI (CITATION), Aniline Blue (0.01% in 50 mM KPO4, 50% glycerol), FM 4-64 (3.4 μM in germination medium) or X-Gluc (for GUS activity) (CITATION). All images were captured on a Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, Germany); pollen tube lengths were measured using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Fertilization and embryo development was analyzed as previously described (CITATION); indicated samples were first stained for GUS activity (CITATION). Northern blotting was performed on 20 μg of total pollen RNA probed with HAP2 cDNA. RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg total pollen RNA using the HAP2 primers F, 5′-TTAATGGCTTGTATACTCGCCGG-3′ and R, 5′-ACGAAGGCAATGCGCGGTATTTGCC-3′, and EF-1α controls F, 5′-GCCCCTTCGTCTCCCACTTC-3′ and R, 5′-CACTTCGCACCCTTCTTGACG-3′; products were analyzed after 25, 30, 35 and 40 PCR cycles. The HAP2promoter:YFP fusion contained 983 bp upstream of the HAP2 start codon, amplified using HAP2SacIF, 5′-GGCGAGCTCAATTTCCCTGATACAATCCCGAGGC-3′ and HAP2BamHIR, 5′-GGCGGATCCTTTCTCTCTCACGGAGACGCG-3′; HAP2protein:YFP fusion contained the HAP2 promoter and all exons and introns, and was amplified using primers HAP2SacIF and HAP2NcoR, 5′-GGCCCATGGTACTCTCACGTAGTCTTTGTTTCCTC-3′. Amplified products were digested with SacI and BamHI, or SacI and NcoI, respectively, and introduced upstream of eYFP (Clonetech) followed by the CaMV polyadenylation sequence, and incorporated into the binary vector, pGREENII02229 (CITATION). Transgenic plants were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan 200 equipped with a Photometrics cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP fxHQ, Roper Scientific, Tuscon, AZ), or a confocal fluorescence microscope (SP2 A OBS, Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany) and analyzed with Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). For analysis of YFP fluorescence during pollen development, uninucleate, bicellular and tricellular pollen grains were released from anthers and stained with DAPI (CITATION). They were then analyzed using a Leica DMIRE2 Confocal microscope with a 63 × water objective using Leica software. DAPI was excited with a 405 nm laser and detected at 410-581 nm, whereas the YFP was excited with a 514 nm laser and detected at 517-597 nm. Pollen tubes were grown for up to 6 hours in liquid media on an inverted microscope slide (CITATION).
