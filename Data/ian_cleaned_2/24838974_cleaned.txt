!~ABS~! It is not known how plants make the benzenoid ring of ubiquinone, a vital respiratory cofactor. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana uses for that purpose two separate biosynthetic branches stemming from phenylalanine and tyrosine. Gene network modeling and characterization of T-DNA mutants indicated that acyl-activating enzyme encoded by At4g19010 contributes to the biosynthesis of ubiquinone specifically from phenylalanine. CoA ligase assays verified that At4g19010 prefers para-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate as substrates. Feeding experiments demonstrated that the at4g19010 knockout cannot use para-coumarate for ubiquinone biosynthesis and that the supply of 4-hydroxybenzoate, the side-chain shortened version of para-coumarate, can bypass this blockage. Furthermore, a trans-cinnamate 4-hydroxylase mutant, which is impaired in the conversion of trans-cinnamate into para-coumarate, displayed similar defects in ubiquinone biosynthesis to that of the at4g19010 knockout. Green fluorescent protein fusion experiments demonstrated that At4g19010 occurs in peroxisomes, resulting in an elaborate biosynthetic architecture where phenylpropanoid intermediates have to be transported from the cytosol to peroxisomes and then to mitochondria where ubiquinone is assembled. Collectively, these results demonstrate that At4g19010 activates the propyl side chain of para-coumarate for its subsequent β-oxidative shortening. Evidence is shown that the peroxisomal ABCD transporter (PXA1) plays a critical role in this branch.
!~RES~! When axenic cultures of Arabidopsis were given identical doses of uniformly 13C-labeled phenylalanine (Phe-[13C9]) or tyrosine (Tyr-[13C9;15N]), ultraperformance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the corresponding extracts readily detected the ion pairs characteristic of ubiquinone-[Ring-13C6] (Supplemental Figure 1). The isotopic enrichment of the benzoquinone ring was twice as high with Phe-[13C9] as with Tyr-[13C9;15N] in both shoots and roots (Table 1). Importantly, 13C isotopes of ubiquinone heavier than those labeled at the six ring positions were not detected, indicating that only the aromatic moiety of Phe-[13C9] and Tyr-[13C9;15N] had been incorporated into ubiquinone. Because angiosperms appear to be unable to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine (CITATION), we inferred that the incorporation of these two aromatic amino acids into ubiquinone might occur, unlike in vertebrates, via two independent pathways. In stark contrast with yeast, Arabidopsis did not incorporate pABA into ubiquinone (Table 1). Mining the ATTED-II coexpression database (CITATION) with genes involved in the assembly of the respiratory chain as queries detected gene At4g19010 as a remarkable node interactor (Figure 2A). The cognate 57-kD protein features a conserved domain (cd05904) found in 4-coumarate-CoA ligases, and previous studies confirmed that recombinant At4g19010 displays CoA ligase activity with some hydroxycinnamate derivatives as substrates (CITATION; CITATION). Two of At4g19010’s strongest interactors, solanesyl-diphosphate synthase3 (SPS3; At2g34630), a COQ1/IspB ortholog, and ABC transporter1 (ABC1; At4g01660), a COQ8/UbiB ortholog (Figure 2A), encode for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Expanding the network reconstruction to the top 250 genes that coexpress with At4g19010, SPS3, and ABC1 revealed that At4g19010 shares 38% of its interactors with SPS3 and/or ABC1 (Figure 2B). Of those, 65% are shared uniquely with SPS3, 13% uniquely with ABC1, and 22% with both SPS3 and ABC1 (Figure 2B). It thus appears that the function of At4g19010 is intimately connected to the mitochondrial electron and proton transport chain and more specifically to ubiquinone biosynthesis. It should also be noted that At4g19010 displays a C-terminal SerArgLeu tripeptide typifying a peroxisomal targeting signal-1; we will come back to this point later. [[FIGURE]] Two mutants corresponding to T-DNA insertions located in the first exon (SK_29455) and fifth intron (SALK_043310) of At4g19010, respectively, were identified using the T-DNA Express gene mapping tool of the SALK Institute (Figure 3A) and confirmed by DNA genotyping. RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that the insertion in line SK_29455 resulted in a knockdown mutation, while that of line SALK_043310 corresponded to a genuine knockout (Figure 3B). Both T-DNA lines were visually indistinguishable from wild-type plants. However, quantification of ubiquinone showed that its levels correlated with the expression of At4g19010; lines SK_29455 and SALK_043310 displaying 21 and 62% decrease in ubiquinone content compared with wild-type plants, respectively (Figure 3C). Similarly, overexpression of At4g19010 cDNA in two independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines resulted in the accumulation of ubiquinone to ∼155% of wild-type content (Figure 3C). Furthermore, when Phe-[13C9] was fed to the at4g19010 knockout, the isotopic enrichment of ubiquinone-[Ring-13C6] was half of that found in the wild-type control (Figure 3D). On the other hand, no statistically significant difference in 13C isotope incorporation was observed between knockout and wild-type plants when Tyr-[13C9;15N] was given to the plants (Figure 3D). All together these results demonstrate that At4g19010 is involved in the biosynthesis of the benzenoid moiety of ubiquinone via the phenylalanine route. [[FIGURE]] Previous investigations of the in vitro substrate preference of acyl activating enzymes reported conflicting data for At4g19010: one study mentioning marginal activity with caffeate and ferulate only (CITATION), while a later study showed that the enzyme possessed conspicuous activity with t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, caffeate, and ferulate as well as with various aliphatic acids (CITATION). To clarify this point, an N-terminally 6xhis-tagged version of At4g19010 was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli, purified, and assayed using a standard spectrophotometric method with CoA, ATP, and t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, ferulate, caffeate, sinapate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, or acetate as substrates. CoA ligase activity was readily detected with t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate, allowing further investigation of At4g19010’s kinetic properties. Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values determined with p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate were similar (Table 2). The catalytic efficiency of the enzyme with t-cinnamate was only 20 to 35% of that measured with p-coumarate, ferulate, or caffeate, owing to a lower kcat value with this substrate (Table 2). Overall, the kinetic parameters of At4g19010 determined with t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate were similar to those previously reported for plant p-coumarate and t-cinnamate-CoA ligases (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Notably, as is usually observed for p-coumarate-CoA ligases (CITATION; CITATION), no activity was detected with sinapate, the ring of which is methoxylated on C5, while t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate are unsubstituted at this position (Table 2). Anecdotal catalytic efficiency was found with 4-hydroxybenzoate, while no activity could be detected with acetate (Table 2). These data thus verify that recombinant At4g19010 is predominantly active with t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate, although they say nothing about which of these substrates might actually play a role in ubiquinone biosynthesis in vivo. Assays with plant extracts did not show any statistically significant difference in CoA ligase activity between wild-type and at4g19010 knockout plants (Supplemental Table 1). To gain some insight into the architecture of the metabolic branch of which At4g19010 belongs to, ubiquinone levels were determined in wild-type and at4g19010 knockout plants fed with t-cinnamate (the product of phenylalanine ammonia lyase), p-coumarate, ferulate, or caffeate, or with their corresponding shortened aliphatic side-chain versions, i.e., benzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, vanillate, or 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, respectively (Figure 4A). Feeding wild-type plants with t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate increased ubiquinone content by ∼30% compared with the DMSO control, whereas only 4-hydroxybenzoate restored ubiquinone biosynthesis in the at4g19010 knockout (Figure 4B). Because t-cinnamate is the immediate precursor of p-coumarate (CITATION) and plants are able to derive 4-hydroxybenzoate from p-coumarate (CITATION), our results strongly suggest that t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate are used as precursors of ubiquinone via the same metabolic branch. That ubiquinone biosynthesis in the at4g19010 knockout is rescued exclusively by 4-hydroxybenzoate would therefore indicate that the loss of function of At4g19010 creates a metabolic blockage upstream of 4-hydroxybenzoate and downstream of t-cinnamate and p-coumarate. Agreeing with such a model, an Arabidopsis reduced epidermal fluorescence3-2 (ref3-2) leaky mutant that displays reduced cinnamate 4-hydroxylase activity and is thus impaired in its ability to convert t-cinnamate into p-coumarate (CITATION) contained only 40% of wild-type ubiquinone level (Figure 4C) and displayed a 75% decrease in isotopic enrichment of ubiquinone-[Ring-13C6] from Phe-[13C9] (Figure 4C). As observed for the at4g19010 knockout, the incorporation of Tyr-[13C9;15N] into ubiquinone in the ref3-2 mutant remained intact (Figure 4C). Taken together, these results are consistent with At4g19010 operating as a CoA ligase that activates the propyl side chain of p-coumarate for its subsequent β-oxidative shortening, leading to 4-hydroxybenzoate. [[FIGURE]] Homology searches across terrestrial plant lineages showed that the putative orthologs of At4g19010 display the hallmark stringent conservation of an authentic peroxisomal targeting sequence-1 (Figure 5A). Coexpression experiments in Nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells confirmed that the green pseudocolor of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of At4g19010 strictly colocalized with the red pseudocolor of a red fluorescent protein (RFP)–tagged fragment of 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase 2 in peroxisomes (Figure 5B). Control coexpression of the GFP-At4g19010 fusion protein with RFP-tagged isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase verified that the fluorescence of GFP was not associated with mitochondria (Figure 5C). That At4g19010 is localized in peroxisomes, while cinnamate-4-hydroxylase is bound to the endomembrane system in the cytosol (CITATION), implies that p-coumarate might be transported into peroxisomes. Reexamination of the At419010/SPS3/ABC1 functional network indentified the peroxisome ABC subfamily D transporter 1 or PXA1 (CITATION) as one of the interacting genes shared between At4g19010 and SPS3 (rank 214 and 291, respectively; Supplemental Data Set 1). Quinone analysis showed that the pxa1 knockout contained 55% less ubiquinone than the wild-type control and that as observed for the at4g19010 and ref3-2 mutants, such a loss was exclusively attributable to a decrease in biosynthetic flux from phenylalanine (Figures 6A and 6B). Feeding experiments showed that of t-cinnamate, p-coumarate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate, only the latter rescued ubiquinone biosynthesis in the pxa1 knockout, demonstrating that here again the metabolic blockage occurred between p-coumarate and 4-hydroxybenzoate (Figure 6C). Further verifying that the impact of the pxa1 mutation on quinone metabolism is specific to ubiquinone biosynthesis, no statistically significant difference in the levels of phylloquinone, the naphthoquinone ring of which is made in part in peroxisomes (CITATION), was observed between the pxa1 mutant and the wild-type control (Figure 6D).

!~MM~! Protein and gene sequences were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Protein sequences were aligned using MultAlin (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/). Orthology was determined using phylogeny.fr (http://www.phylogeny.fr). Gene networks were reconstructed by mining coexpressors from the ATTED-II database (http://atted.jp) using Arabidopsis thaliana respiratory genes as queries. Coexpressing genes were then aggregated using GeneVenn (http://genevenn.sourceforge.net). p-Aminobenzoic acid-[13C6] was from IsoSciences, l-phenylalanine-[13C9], and l-tyrosine-[13C9;15N] were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. t-Cinnamic and benzoic acids and their hydroxyl/methoxy derivatives were from Sigma-Aldrich. Unless mentioned otherwise, other reagents were from Fisher Scientific. Arabidopsis SALK_043310 (CITATION) and SK_29455 (CITATION) insertion lines, as well as the pxa1 ethyl methanesulfonate mutant (CITATION; stock number CS3950), were obtained from the ABRC. The ref3-2 mutant was generated and identified in the laboratory of one of the coauthors (C.C.) as previously described (CITATION). Seeds were germinated on Murashige and Skoog solid medium, transferred to soil, and then grown at 22°C in 16-h days (110 μE m−2 s−1) for 4 weeks. For feeding experiments, plants were germinated and grown in Murashige and Skoog liquid medium containing sucrose (10 g/liter) on an orbital shaker (60 rpm) in 10-h days (200 μE m−2 s−1) at 22°C. Total leaf RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). cDNAs were then prepared from total RNA (500 ng) using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). PCR amplification was performed on a 3Prime thermal cycler (Techne) using the following gene-specific primer pairs: At4g19010, 5′-GGAGTTTGTGGTGAAGTGTTT-3′ and 5′-CAAGGGATGTGAAACAAGAAC-3′; actin control, 5′-CTAAGCTCTCAAGATCAAAGGC-3′ and 5′-TTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGG-3′. Full-length At4g19010 cDNA (ABRC clone G60335) was codon optimized (GenScript) and subcloned using Gateway technology into expression vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen) for N-terminal fusion with a 6xHis tag. This construct was introduced in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen). Protein expression was induced in Luria-Bertani medium with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 20°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted in 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 using 0.1-mm Zirconia/silica beads in a MiniBeadbeater (BioSpec Products). The extract was cleared by centrifugation, and the recombinant protein was purified under native conditions with Ni-NTA His-Bind resin (Novagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The isolated enzyme was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated in 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mM MgCl2. The desalted enzyme was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C. Negative controls consisting of untransformed BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS cells were processed in parallel. For the preparation of plant extracts, Arabidopsis leaves (1 g) were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle under liquid N2. The powder was then thawed in 5 mL of 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% (v/v) of β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (w/v) of cross-linked poly vinylpyrrolidone. Extracts were centrifuged (10,000g for 10 min at 4°C) to pellet the cell debris and the supernatants immediately desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated in 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mM MgCl2. Desalted fractions were dispensed into 500 μL aliquots, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was quantified by the method of Bradford (CITATION) using BSA as a standard. Assays (1 mL) contained 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CoA, 0 to 300 μM of organic acid, and 0 to 25 μg of protein. Reactions were performed for 30 to 60 min at 30°C. The increase in absorbance due to the formation of the CoA thioesters was monitored on an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer using the following wavelengths and molar extinction coefficients: 311 nm and 22,000 M−1 cm−1 for t-cinnamoyl-CoA, 333 nm and 21,000 M−1 cm−1 for p-coumaroyl-CoA, 345 nm and 19,000 M−1 cm−1 for feruloyl-CoA, 346 nm and 18,000 M−1 cm−1 for caffeoyl-CoA, 352 nm and 20,000 M−1 cm−1 for sinapoyl-CoA, 330 nm and 24,000 M−1 cm−1 for 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, and 232 nm and 4500 M−1 cm−1 for acetyl-CoA (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). For ultraperformance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry analysis, ubiquinone was extracted as previously described (CITATION), except that the reduction step with NaBH4 was omitted. Reduced and oxidized ubiquinones were separated on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (Agilent Technologies) held at 40°C at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min−1 with a binary gradient system consisting of solvent A, methanol:isopropanol (80:20) + 10 mM ammonium acetate, and solvent B, isopropanol:hexane (60:40) + 10 mM ammonium acetate. An 8-min gradient was generated starting with 30% solvent B for 3 min and increased to 60% solvent B over 2 min and held at 60% for 1 min before returning to 30% B at 6.6 min. The eluate was directed to a TurboV ion source of the 4000 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive mode at +5000 V. The temperature was held at 200°C, nebulizing gas (GS1) was set at 16 p.s.i., focusing gas (GS2) at 20 p.s.i., curtain gas at 20 p.s.i., and the interface heater was engaged. Declustering potential (40 V), collision energy (34 V), entrance potential (10 V), and collision exit potential (11 V) were optimized using a standard of ubiquinone-10. Reduced and oxidized ubiquinones were measured by Multiple Reaction Monitoring using dwell times of 50 ms and the following ion pairs: ubiquinone-9 (812.8/197.1), ubiquinol-9 (814.8/197.1), ubiquinone-10 (880.8/197.1), ubiquinol-10 (882.8/197.1), ubiquinone-9-[13C6] (818.8/203.1), ubiquinol-9-[13C6] (820.8/203.1), ubiquinone-10-[13C6] (886.8/203.1), and ubiquinol-10-[13C6] (888.8/203.1). Retention times were 3.1 min for ubiquinol-9, 3.6 min for ubiquinol-10, 4.1 min for ubiquinone-9, and 5 min for ubiquinone-10. HPLC-diode array spectrophotometry analysis of total ubiquinones was performed as previously described (CITATION). Phylloquinone levels were determined on the leaves of Arabidopsis plants grown on Murashige and Skoog medium containing sucrose using the HPLC-fluorescence method of CITATION. Full-length At4g19010 cDNA was subcloned into pK7WGF2 (CITATION) using Gateway technology, resulting in an in-frame fusion of GFP to the N terminus of At4g19010. The KAT2-eqFP611 peroxisomal marker cassette, encoding for a fragment (residues 1 to 99) of Arabidopsis 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase 2 fused to the N-terminal end of RFP under the control of the 35S promoter (CITATION), was subcloned into the EcoRI and PstI sites of binary vector PZP212 (CITATION). Vector pLN3639 allowed expression of the IVDH mitochondrial marker consisting of the N-terminal region of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase fused to the N-terminal end of RFP under the control of the 35S promoter (CITATION). The 35S:GFP-At4g19010 construct was electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 for subsequent coinfiltration into the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana with a second strain harboring either PZP212-35S:KAT2-eqFP611 or pLN3639. Epidermal cells were imaged by confocal microscopy 48 h later using a Nikon A1 laser scanning microscope. GFP, RFP, and chlorophyll were excited and collected sequentially. Excitation wavelengths were 488 nm for GFP, 561 nm for RFP, and 641 nm for chlorophyll. Emissions were collected from 500 to 550 nm for GFP, 570 to 620 nm for RFP, and 663 to 738 nm for chlorophyll. Full-length At4g19010 cDNA was subcloned under the control of the 35S promoter in pB2GW7 (CITATION) using Gateway technology. This construct was introduced into Arabidopsis plants ecotype Columbia-0 using the floral dip method (CITATION), and the resulting transgenics were selected on soil by spraying 100 mg L−1 of BASTA.
