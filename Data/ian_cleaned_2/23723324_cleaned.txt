!~ABS~! Nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs) were described as products of chlorophyll breakdown in Arabidopsis thaliana. NCCs are formyloxobilin-type catabolites derived from chlorophyll by oxygenolytic opening of the chlorin macrocycle. These linear tetrapyrroles are generated from their fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (FCC) precursors by a nonenzymatic isomerization inside the vacuole of senescing cells. Here, we identified a group of distinct dioxobilin-type chlorophyll catabolites (DCCs) as the major breakdown products in wild-type Arabidopsis, representing more than 90% of the chlorophyll of green leaves. The molecular constitution of the most abundant nonfluorescent DCC (NDCC), At-NDCC-1, was determined. We further identified cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP89A9 as being responsible for NDCC accumulation in wild-type Arabidopsis; cyp89a9 mutants that are deficient in CYP89A9 function were devoid of NDCCs but accumulated proportionally higher amounts of NCCs. CYP89A9 localized outside the chloroplasts, implying that FCCs occurring in the cytosol might be its natural substrate. Using recombinant CYP89A9, we confirm FCC specificity and show that fluorescent DCCs are the products of the CYP89A9 reaction. Fluorescent DCCs, formed by this enzyme, isomerize to the respective NDCCs in weakly acidic medium, as found in vacuoles. We conclude that CYP89A9 is involved in the formation of dioxobilin-type catabolites of chlorophyll in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! NCCs have been identified as breakdown products of chlorophyll that accumulate during leaf senescence in many angiosperms, including annual species and deciduous trees. However, in some cases, NDCCs were reported to represent products of chlorophyll breakdown. To explore the possibility that, besides NCCs (CITATION), NDCCs might also accumulate in the model plant Arabidopsis, we used HPLC to reanalyze extracts of senescent leaves. Leaf senescence was induced by dark treatment of detached leaves, a procedure that is well known to efficiently induce chlorophyll breakdown (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Like other NCCs, At-NCCs exhibit a characteristic absorption maximum at around 315 nm and equally strong absorption at 254 nm (Figure 2A). When comparing Arabidopsis leaf extracts with detection at these two wavelengths, several fractions were identified that strongly absorbed at 254 nm but only weekly at 315 nm (Figure 2C). At least five of these fractions showed absorption spectra (Figure 2B; see Supplemental Figure 1A online) that were described for the Norway maple NDCC (CITATION), indicating that they could represent related NDCCs (At-NDCCs) in Arabidopsis. [[FIGURE]] The most polar, major NDCC from Arabidopsis (At-NDCC-1) was thoroughly analyzed by spectroscopy methods (for detailed spectroscopic data, see Methods). At-NDCC-1 was revealed to represent a nonfluorescent dioxobilane-type catabolite (Figure 2D, inset) as follows. The molecular formula of At-NDCC-1 was determined as C33H38N4O8 by mass spectrometry (MS), by which the quasimolecular ion [C33H38N4O8+H]+ was observed at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 619.3. In the 1H-NMR spectra of At-NDCC-1 (in CD3OD, 10°C) (Figure 2D), signals of all 30 exchange-inert carbon-bound hydrogen atoms were observed. A singlet near 9 ppm was absent, which is a characteristic of the formyl hydrogen atom of NCCs (CITATION). Instead, a multiplet at δ = 4.34 ppm and a double doublet at δ = 4.11 ppm indicated hydrogen atoms at positions C9 and C1, respectively, as is typical for NDCCs (CITATION) (Figure 2D). Both NDCC and NCC abundances increased during the course of leaf senescence; however, the amounts of NDCCs exceeded NCCs by a factor of about 10 (inset in Figure 2C). In addition, after 8 d of dark-induced senescence, NDCCs accounted for more than 75% of the degraded chlorophyll, demonstrating them to represent the by far most abundant type of chlorophyll catabolite in Arabidopsis. The identification of NDCCs as the major chlorophyll catabolites in Arabidopsis called for elucidating the mechanism of their formation. Two possible pathways were addressed: (1) formation from a chlorin-type substrate, such as chlorophyll or pheophorbide, whose macrocycle could be opened by a heme oxygenase-like reaction (i.e., under the loss of the C5-carbon atom); or (2) oxidative deformylation of the C5-formyl group present in FCCs and NCCs (Figure 1). We excluded the first possibility because pao1, an Arabidopsis PAO mutant, retains large quantities of chlorophyll during leaf senescence (CITATION). If NDCC formation would involve an activity for chlorin ring cleavage that is distinct from PAO, degreening should not be blocked in pao1. Alternatively, PAO itself could exhibit a heme oxygenase-like activity; however, in vitro activity studies clearly demonstrated a specificity of PAO toward FCC formation (CITATION). To identify likely candidates for C5-deformylation, we tested whether cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) could be involved. P450s have been shown to catalyze different types of reactions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), including deformylation of C-bound formyl groups (CITATION; CITATION). We exploited the ability of CO to effectively inhibit P450s (CITATION); when senescence was induced in detached leaves in an atmosphere composed of a 1:1 ratio (v/v) of CO and ambient air, the NDCC-to-NCC ratio was shifted to higher amounts of NCCs when compared with incubation at ambient air (Figure 3). This supported the idea that P450s could catalyze NDCC formation. Based on the fact that several genes encoding chlorophyll catabolic enzymes are highly expressed in senescent rosette leaves, cauline leaves, and petals and/or sepals (CITATION; CITATION), we reasoned that the genes for P450s involved in NDCC formation could be similarly induced. Using the Genes Search Tool of the Genevestigator platform (CITATION) and the above-mentioned tissues as targets, we found two P450 genes, CYP89A9 and CYP71B19, among the first hundred genes that are similarly expressed (see Supplemental Table 1 online). As expected, this gene list also contained PAO, STAY-GREEN, NONYELLOW COLORING1, and PHEOPHYTINASE, four senescence-regulated chlorophyll catabolic genes. To analyze the potential role of the two P450 candidate genes, we characterized chlorophyll breakdown in T-DNA insertion mutants (see Supplemental Figure 2A online) that fail to express the respective full-length gene transcripts (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). These lines did not show any obvious visible phenotype during normal development and high light treatment, and upon senescence induction, chlorophyll was degraded like in the wild type. During senescence, cyp71b19 mutants accumulated wild-type patterns of catabolites (see Supplemental Figure 2C online) and were not considered further. By contrast, both investigated cyp89a9 mutants did not accumulate NDCCs but had more than 10-fold increased levels of NCCs (Figure 4; see Supplemental Figure 3A online). In cyp89a9-1, NCCs accumulated up to 1.1 μmol per g fresh weight, which corresponded to more than 90% of degraded chlorophyll. UV/Vis (see Supplemental Figure 1B online) and MS analysis of the NCCs of cyp89a9-1 (for MS data, see Methods) confirmed them to be identical to the NCCs found in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild type (CITATION). The cyp89a9-2 mutation is in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) background, and Ler has been shown to be a natural METHYLESTERASE16 (MES16) mutant (CITATION). MES16 is responsible for demethylation of the C132-carboxymethyl group of FCCs. Because of this, the NDCC/NCC catabolite patterns differed between Col-0 and Ler (Figure 4B; see Supplemental Figure 3A online). In addition, O134-desmethyl FCCs that accumulate in mes16 mutants (hence, also in Ler) were shown to isomerize more slowly to the corresponding NCCs (i.e., these FCCs accumulate and, as a consequence, the leaves will fluoresce) (CITATION). To confirm that the catabolite pattern seen in cyp89a9-2 is due to the absence of both CYP89A9 and MES16, we crossed cyp89a9-1 with mes16-1 (a MES16 mutant in Col-0 background). In this line, chlorophyll catabolite patterns were identical to cyp89a9-2 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The NDCC deficiency of cyp89a9 mutants indicated that CYP89A9 may catalyze their formation in wild-type plants. To analyze this hypothesis, we tested in vitro activity of recombinant CYP89A9 expressed in Sf9 insect cells. FCCs were considered as likely substrates for CYP89A9 because when expressed as a fusion with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, CYP89A9 localized outside chloroplasts and, as shown for most extraplastidial P450 enzymes (CITATION; CITATION), most likely to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 5). P450 activity requires a P450 reductase; therefore, ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA P450 OXIDOREDUCTASE1 (ATR1), one of the two Arabidopsis P450 reductases (CITATION), was expressed in Sf9 cells as well. Using epi-pFCC (CITATION) as substrate, four fractions of fluorescent compounds were obtained in a time-dependent manner in the presence of CYP89A9 (Figure 6A). They exhibited identical spectra with a prominent absorption maximum at around 360 nm (Figure 6B; see Supplemental Figure 1C online). MS analysis (for MS data, see Methods) demonstrated these compounds to be isomers of a constitutionally uniform fluorescent dioxobilin-type chlorophyll catabolite (FDCC) (Figure 6B), which we termed epi-pFDCCs because they derived from epi-pFCC. They likely differ in the configuration at C132 and C9 (Figure 6B); however, this was not further investigated. To test the substrate specificity of CYP89A9, assays were performed also with mes16-FCC-2 (pFCC with an additional hydroxyl group at C82) and the corresponding NCC, mes16-NCC-2 (CITATION) (Figure 6C). Only the FCC, but not the isomeric NCC, was converted by CYP89A9, supporting the specificity of CYP89A9 for FCCs. Under acidic conditions, the epi-pFDCCs isomerized into NDCCs (Figure 6D; see Supplemental Figure 1 online), indicating that in vivo formation of NDCCs from corresponding FDCCs might occur after their import into the vacuole. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] During our analysis of CYP89A9 substrate specificity in vitro, it turned out that the enzyme did not convert O134-demethylated epi-pFCC to the respective FDCC (Figure 6C). This indicated that, although both CYP89A9 and MES16 act in the cytosol and therefore could compete for the same substrate in vivo, deformylation by CYP89A9 might precede catabolite demethylation by MES16. To investigate this in more detail, we used a line (Col-0/PPHTP-MES16) in which MES16 was targeted to the chloroplast (CITATION) (i.e., demethylation was allowed to occur before FCC export to the cytosol). In this line, the NDCC-to-NCC ratio was significantly shifted toward more NCCs compared with Col-0 (Figure 7; see Supplemental Figure 4 online). This supports the idea that in Col-0 wild-type plants, CYP89A9 precedes MES16 action to a large extent leading to the formation of NDCCs, while only a small fraction of catabolites may be first demethylated, thus ending in the formation of NCCs. Further evidence for this was obtained by CYP89A9 complementation tests in cyp89a9 mutants. When analyzing the relative amounts of NDCCs and NCCs as a measure of complementation, absence of MES16 in the mes16-1 cyp89a9-1 double mutant resulted in more efficient complementation compared with (the MES16-containing line) cyp89a9-1 (Figure 7). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild type. Ecotype Ler was also analyzed in experiments including cyp89a9-2 (Ler background). Ler is a natural mutant in the MES16 gene (CITATION). T-DNA insertion lines were from the following collections: SALK lines (CITATION), AT3G26170-2 (cyp71b19-2), SALK_149952; SAIL lines (CITATION), AT3G26170-1 (cyp71b19-1), SAIL_1165_B02; John Innes Centre suppressor mutator lines (CITATION), AT3G03470-1 (cyp89a9-1), SM_3_39636; John Innes Centre gene trap lines (CITATION), AT3G03470-2 (cyp89a9-2), GT_5_22744. SALK, SAIL, SM, and GT lines were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Center, Nottingham, UK. Homozygous plants were identified by PCR using T-DNA–, transposon-, and gene-specific primers as listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. Likewise, a homozygous mes16-1 cyp89a9-1 double mutant was identified by PCR. Plants were grown on soil either in 8-h-light/16-h-dark (short day) or 12-h-light/12-h-dark (12:12) photoperiods under fluorescent light of 60 to 120 µmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22°C or at 16 h light/8 h dark (long day) in a greenhouse with fluence rates of 100 to 200 µmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22°C. For senescence induction, leaves from 8-week-old (short day) or 5-week-old (12:12 and long day) plants were excised and incubated in permanent darkness on wet filter paper for up to 8 d at ambient temperature. For dark incubation in CO atmosphere, leaves from short-day-grown Col-0 plants were excised and incubated for 5 d in glass containers containing 0, 50, and 100% (v/v) CO mixed with ambient air. Search for coexpressed genes in senescent rosette leaves, cauline leaves, petals, and sepals was performed with the Gene Search Tool Anatomy of the Genevestigator platform (CITATION) using a limit of 100 genes. CYP89A9 was amplified by PCR with the Expand high-fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) from clone U67778 (ABRC) using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 online, introducing XmaI-NheI restriction sites at the ends. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) and after XmaI-NheI digest subcloned into pUC18-spGFP6 (CITATION), thereby producing a fusion of CYP89A9 with the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from 6-week-old short-day-grown Col-0 plants according to published procedures (CITATION; CITATION). Cell numbers were quantified with a Neubauer chamber and adjusted to a density of 2 to 3 × 106 protoplasts mL−1. CYP89A9-GFP was cotransformed with the ER marker BiP-RFP (for red fluorescent protein) (CITATION) in protoplasts isolated from green or dark-induced senescent leaves by 20% polyethylene glycol transformation (CITATION). Free GFP expressed from empty pUC18-spGFP6 was used as a control for cytosolic localization. Transformed cells were incubated for 24 h in the dark at room temperature before laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems). GFP and RFP fluorescence were imaged at an excitation wavelength of 488 and 561 nm, respectively. The detection channel windows were set as follow: 495 to 530 nm (GFP), 593 to 619 nm (RFP), and 643 to 730 nm (chlorophyll autofluorescence). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen) from green and dark-incubated leaves of plants grown in the short-day photoperiod. After DNA digestion with RQ1 DNase (Promega), first-strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was performed with nonsaturating numbers of amplification cycles as shown in Supplemental Figure 2 online using gene-specific primers as listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The preparation of epi-pFCC (from Capsicum annuum fruit extracts) is described elsewhere (CITATION). O134-desmethyl epi-pFCC was produced from epi-pFCC with MES16 (CITATION). mes16-FCC-2 and mes16-NCC-2 were extracted from dark-incubated leaves (5 d) of mes16-1cyp89a9-1 grown in 12:12 photoperiod in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7/methanol (1:3, v/v), concentrated using C18-SepPak cartridges (Waters) and purified by HPLC. ATR1 and CYP89A9 were amplified by PCR (Expand high-fidelity PCR system) from clone pda02355 obtained from the RIKEN resource (CITATION) and clone U67778 (ABRC), respectively, using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 online and then cloned into pFastbac1 (Invitrogen) via EcoRI. CYP89A9 and ATR1 were also cloned in pFastbac DUAL (Invitrogen) using KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, allowing simultaneous expression of the two genes with one bacmid. After sequencing, the constructs were used for the preparation of recombinant bacmid DNAs by transformation of Escherichia coli strain DH10Bac (Invitrogen). Insect cell transfection and recombinant protein expression were conducted as outlined in the bac-to-bac manual (Invitrogen), using Sf9 cells grown in monolayer cultures. For expression of the recombinant proteins, Sf9 cells were maintained in BD BaculoGold TNM-FH insect medium (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 200 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid and 200 mM ferrous sulfate to increase the low heme synthetic capacity of the insect cells (CITATION). For preparation of microsomal fractions, infected cells were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT complemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete; Roche Applied Science). The cells were homogenized on ice with a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h. The pellet (microsomal fraction) was homogenized in lysis buffer with a syringe through a 0.5-mm-wide needle, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until use. Standard assays with CYP89A9 and ATR1 microsomes (total volume 100 µL) consisted of 40 µg of microsome proteins, 10 µM of substrate, and 0.1 mM NADPH. After incubation at 28°C in darkness for different periods of time as indicated in Figure 6, the reactions were stopped by the addition of methanol to a final concentration of 50%. After centrifugation (2 min at 16,000g), samples were analyzed by HPLC as described below. Microsomes produced with bacmids generated from pFastbac1 constructs were used for standard assays. Noninfected cells or cells infected only with ATR1 bacmid were used as controls. For scaling up the standard assay to produce higher amounts of products obtained when using epi-pFCC as substrate, microsomes generated with the pFastbac DUAL construct were used. epi-pFDCCs were purified by HPLC prior to MS analysis (see below). Pigments were extracted from liquid nitrogen–homogenized tissue during 2 h at −20°C in 10% (v/v) 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in acetone, precooled to –20°C (5 mL g−1 fresh weight). After centrifugation twice (4 min, 16,000g, 4°C), supernatants were analyzed by spectrophotometry (CITATION). Plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen, and colorless catabolites were extracted with 3 volumes (w/v) of 50 mM phosphate buffer (P-buffer), pH 7/methanol (1:3, v/v), and analyzed by HPLC as described (CITATION). Peak detection was performed with sequential monitoring using a PA-100 photodiode array detector (200 to 700 nm; ThermoFisher Scientific) and a RF2000 fluorescence detector (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 450 nm; ThermoFisher Scientific). Chlorophyll catabolites were identified by their absorption (FCCs, FDCCs, NCCs, and NDCCs) and fluorescence (FDCCs and FCCs) properties. Relative amounts of FCCs, FDCCs, NCCs, and NDCCs were determined by peak areas at 254 nm using the approximation that absorption at this wavelength is similar in the different types of catabolites. In addition, NCCs were quantified at 320 nm (CITATION). CYP89A9 was amplified by PCR as described above and cloned via EcoRI-HindIII into pHannibal (CITATION). The pHannibal cassette containing cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, the CYP89A9 open reading frame, and an OCS terminator was excised with NotI and introduced into NotI-restricted pGreen0179 (CITATION). Arabidopsis cyp89a9-1 and mes16-1cyp89a9-1 plants were transformed by the floral dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected on hygromycin, and resistant T2 plants were used for further analysis. The isomerization assays consisted of 11.2 µM of purified epi-pFDCCs produced with recombinant CYP89A9 (see above) and 80 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5. Aliquots were taken after incubation times as indicated in Figure 6D, and isomerization was stopped by adding Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 350 mM. Methanol was added to a final concentration of 35% (v/v) prior to analysis by HPLC as described above. For spectroscopic analyses, the following instruments and settings were employed: UV/VIS spectra: Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer; λmax (nm) (εrel). CD spectra: JASCO J715; λmin/max (nm) (Δε). 1H- and 13C-NMR: Bruker UltraShield 600 MHz Avance II+ [δ (C1HD2COD) = 3.31 ppm, δ(13CD3OD) = 49.0 ppm] (CITATION). MS: Finnigan MAT 95, electrospray ionization (ESI) source, positive ion mode, 1.4-kV spray voltage (At-DNCC-1); Finnigan LCQ classic, ESI source, positive ion mode, spray voltage 4.25 kV, solvent methanol/water (10 mM NH4OAc) 1:1 (v/v); m/z (percentage of intensity, type of ion). The HPLC used for MS analysis was a Hewlett Packard series 1100 HPLC system with an online degasser, an Agilent quaternary pump, a diode array detector (DAD) and a fluorescence detector (FLD). For analytical HPLC the system was equipped with an injection loop (200 μL; Rheodyne valve), and a Phenomenex hyperclone ODS (5 μm; 250 × 4.6 mm i.d.) column (at room temperature) connected to a Phenomenex ODS (4 × 3 mm i.d.) pre-column. The column was eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 with solvent A (MeOH) and solvent B (P-buffer, pH 7) using the following solvent composition (A/B, v/v; as a function of time): 0 to 5 min, 20/80; 5 to 55 min, 20/80 to 70/30; 55 to 60 min, 70/30 to 100/0; 60 to 70 min, 100/0; 70 to 75 min, 100/0 to 80/20. For the separation of the four products of CYP89A9/ATR1 assays, solvent A (MeOH) and solvent B (10 mM ammonium acetate buffer) were used with the following solvent composition (A/B, v/v; as a function of time): 0 to 5 min, 30/70; 5 to 55 min, 30/70 to 65/35; 55 to 70 min, 65/35 to 75/25; 70 to 80 min, 75/25 to 100/0; 80 to 90 min, 100/0; 90 to 95 min, 100/0 to 30/70. For preparative HPLC, a Phenomenex HyperClone ODS (5 μm; 250 × 21.2 mm i.d.) column protected with a Phenomenex ODS (10 mm × 5 mm i.d.) pre-column was used. The column was eluted at room temperature with a flow rate of 5 ml min−1 with solvent A (MeOH) and solvent B (P-buffer, pH 7) with the following solvent composition (A/B, v/v; as a function of time): 0 to 5 min, 25/75; 5 to 123 min, 25/75 to 38/62; 123 to 200 min, 38/62 to 64/36; 200 to 210 min, 64/36 to 100/0; 210 to 230 min, 100/0. Senescent leaves (16.5 g) of Arabidopsis were ground in a mortar in liquid nitrogen, mixed with sea sand, and extracted with 16 mL of methanol. The obtained slurry was filtrated through a Buchner funnel, and the extraction with methanol was repeated seven times. The collected green extract (160 mL) was diluted with 30 mL P-buffer, pH 7.0, and washed twice with 160 mL n-hexane. The solution was reduced under vacuum to 70 mL, diluted with 600 mL P-buffer, pH 7.0, and filtrated. The mixture was loaded on a Sep-Pak Vac 20cc (5 g) C18 cartridge (Waters), washed with water (50 mL), and eluted with methanol (15 mL). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The crude product was dissolved in 800 μL methanol/P-buffer (50:50, v/v), diluted with 500 μL P-buffer, and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The clear brown solution was injected into the preparative HPLC. The At-NDCC-1–containing fraction was collected, diluted with 4 volumes of water, and applied to a Sep-Pak classic C18 cartridge. The At-NDCC-1 was obtained salt-free by washing with 20 mL of water and eluting with 5 mL of methanol. The solvents were removed in vacuum to give 0.770 mg of At-NDCC-1. The following spectroscopic data were obtained: UV/Vis (methanol, 6.9 × 10−4 M) λmax (εrel): 288 sh (0.29), 239 sh (1.00), 221 (1.29); CD (methanol, 6.9 × 10−4 M) λmin/max (Δε): 311 (5.3), 284 (−26.4), 250 (7.1), 231 (17.1). 1H-NMR (600 MHz, CD3OD, 283 K): δ [ppm] = 1.78 [s, CH3 (71)], 1.95 [s, CH3 (181)], 1.99 [s, CH3 (21)], 2.11 [s, CH3 (121)], 2.38 [m, CH2 (172)], 2.45 [dd, J = 14.4/5.1 Hz, CHA (20)], 2.50 [m, CHA (81)], 2.54 [m, CHA (10)], 2.69 [m, CHA (171)], 2.75 [m, CHB (171)], 2.78 [m, CHB (81)], 2,89 [dd, J= 14.4/9.4 Hz, CHB (20)], 3.05 [dd, J= 14.6/4.9 Hz, CHB (10)], 3.66 [m, CHA (82)], 3.70 [m, CHB (82)], 4.11 [dd, J= 9.3/5.1 Hz, CH (1)], 4.34 [m, J ca 5 Hz, CH (9)], 4.84 [s, CH (15)], 5.33 [dd, J = 11.7/1.94 Hz, CHA (32)], 6.09 [dd, J = 17.7/1.91 Hz, CHB (32)], 6.46 [dd, J = 17.6/11.7 Hz, CH (31)]; 13C-NMR (150 MHz, CD3OD, 283 K, 13C-signal assignments from HSQC- and HMBC-experiments): δ (ppm) = 8.2 (71), 9.1 (181), 9.3 (121), 12.2 (21), 21.6 (171), 30.0 (10), 30.6 (20), 30.7 (81), 38.1 (15), 39.1 (172), 60.3 (9), 60.9 (82), 61.5 (1), 71.8 (132), 112.4 (12), 115.5 (18), 118.6 (32), 119.9 (17), 123.4 (19), 125.7 (16), 126.7 (31), 128.5 (3), 130.6 (7), 133.6 (11), 156.0 (8), 162.0 (14), 174.9 (4), 176.6 (6), 176.7 (133), and 181.0 (173). ESI-MS: m/z (%) = 657.3 (33, [M+K]+); 633.3 (10); 621.71 (6), 620.3 (35), 619.3 (100, C33H39N4O8, [M+H]+); 613.3 (53, [M-CO2+K]+); 601.3 (31, [M-H2O+H]+); 575.3 (15, [M-CO2+H]+); 496.2 (26, [M-C7H9NO (ring A)+H]+; 478.2 (6, [M-ring A-H2O+H]+); and 452.2 (32, [M-CO2-ring A+H]+). For MS analysis, five fractions containing NCCs from senescent leaf extracts of cyp89a9-1 were isolated by HPLC, analyzed by ESI ionization, and tentatively identified with the known five At-NCCs (CITATION; CITATION).
