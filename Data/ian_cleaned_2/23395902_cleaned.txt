!~ABS~! Pathogens target important components of host immunity to cause disease. The Pseudomonas syringae type III‐secreted effector HopU1 is a mono‐ADP‐ribosyltransferase required for full virulence on Arabidopsis thaliana. HopU1 targets several RNA‐binding proteins including GRP7, whose role in immunity is still unclear. Here, we show that GRP7 associates with translational components, as well as with the pattern recognition receptors FLS2 and EFR. Moreover, GRP7 binds specifically FLS2 and EFR transcripts in vivo through its RNA recognition motif. HopU1 does not affect the protein–protein associations between GRP7, FLS2 and translational components. Instead, HopU1 blocks the interaction between GRP7 and FLS2 and EFR transcripts in vivo. This inhibition correlates with reduced FLS2 protein levels upon Pseudomonas infection in a HopU1‐dependent manner. Our results reveal a novel virulence strategy used by a microbial effector to interfere with host immunity.
!~RES~! Previous results conclusively showed that loss of GRP7 impairs PTI and resistance to Pto DC3000 infection (CITATION; CITATION). To investigate the consequences of ectopic GRP7 expression, we monitored PTI and pathogen response in transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing untagged GRP7 under the control of the constitutive promoter 35S (GRP7ox lines) (CITATION). An immunoblot analysis using a specific anti‐GRP7 antibody confirmed higher GRP7 levels in transgenic homozygous GRP7ox plants in comparison to the wild‐type (WT) Col‐2 ecotype (Supplementary Figure S1). A. thaliana Col‐2 (WT) and GRP7ox plants were treated with flg22, elf18 or chitin, which resulted in substantially higher ROS production in GRP7ox plants compared to WT (FIG-REF). Similarly, callose deposition was increased in GRP7ox plants compared to WT plants after all three treatments (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] The A. thaliana GRP7ox plants were used in pathogenicity assays with Pto DC3000 or the Pto DC3000 hrcC− mutant that does not secrete any T3SEs and is therefore severely hypo‐virulent. Plants were spray inoculated and bacteria were enumerated at 0 and 4 days after inoculation. Interestingly, GRP7ox plants were more resistant to infection by Pto DC3000 than WT plants (FIG-REF). The Pto DC3000 hrcC− mutant exhibited unaltered growth on GRP7ox plants. This may be due to the strongly reduced virulence of the Pto DC3000 hrcC− mutant to which the endogenous GRP7 seems to be sufficient to confer high resistance. The increased resistance to Pto DC3000 infection observed in plants overexpressing GRP7 clearly demonstrates its important role in innate immunity. GRP7 is required for full immunity to Pto DC3000 WT and hrcC−, and HopU1 targets GRP7 (CITATION; CITATION). To assess the extent to which HopU1 inhibits PTI responses, we analysed early and late responses triggered by flg22 in transgenic A. thaliana lines constitutively expressing HopU1 C‐terminally tagged with haemagglutinin (HA) under the control of the 35S promoter (CITATION). In HopU1 plants, the ROS burst induced by flg22 and elf18 treatment was reduced compared to WT plants (Supplementary Figure S2A). Next, we confirmed that HopU1 leaves exhibit less callose deposition upon flg22 treatment (Supplementary Figure S2B; CITATION). The reduced flg22 responsiveness of the HopU1 plants correlated with reduced FLS2 protein levels observed in three out of four independent biological experiments (Supplementary Figure S2C). These results were further validated using A. thaliana transgenic lines expressing HopU1‐HA under the control of an estradiol‐inducible promoter (ind_HopU1) (Supplementary Figures S2D and E). Together, this demonstrates that HopU1 affects both early and late flg22‐induced responses. To test whether in planta HopU1 expression affects A. thaliana disease resistance, we assayed bacterial growth after spray inoculation with the Pto DC3000 strains WT, hrcC− or ΔhopU1 that is hypo‐virulent (CITATION). HopU1 plants were more susceptible to all the strains tested (Supplementary Figure S2F), albeit to a lesser extent than fls2 null mutant plants consistent with the reduced flg22 sensitivity of HopU1 plants (Supplementary Figures S2A–E). Consistent with the notion that GRP7 is a main target of HopU1 in reducing plant immunity, GRP7ox plants were as resistant to Pto DC3000 as WT plants to Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 (Supplementary Figure S2G). These results, together with previous results (CITATION; CITATION), indicate that the abundance and/or activity of GRP7 are both required and limited for triggering optimal early and late PTI responses. The importance of GRP7 for early PTI responses suggests that GRP7 may affect directly PRRs and/or associated proteins, or indirectly the expression and/or biogenesis of such proteins. Notably, we identified GRP7 in an unbiased yeast two‐hybrid screen for EFR‐interacting proteins (Supplementary Figure S3A). Importantly, we could confirm this interaction in co‐immunoprecipitation experiments after transient co‐expression of EFR and GRP7 as C‐terminally tagged fusion proteins with HA and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags (EFR‐3 × HA and GRP7‐eGFP, respectively) in Nicotiana benthamiana (FIG-REF). Similarly, GRP7 and FLS2 also interacted when transiently co‐expressed as fusion proteins (FLS2‐3 × myc and GRP7‐eGFP) in N. benthamiana (FIG-REF). However, GRP7‐eGFP did not interact under similar conditions with the LRR‐RK BAK1 (BAK1‐HA) (FIG-REF), which is an important positive regulator of PTI responses downstream of FLS2 and EFR (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] We confirmed the GRP7–FLS2 association by co‐immunoprecipitation in an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing GRP7 C‐terminally tagged with a GFP epitope (GRP7‐GFP) under the control of the 35S promoter (CITATION) and using an anti‐FLS2 antibody recognizing the native FLS2 protein (FIG-REF). The GRP7–FLS2 interaction occurred independently of elicitation and was unaltered by flg22 treatment (FIG-REF). The presence of EFR and FLS2 proteins that may correspond to their glycosylated forms (migrating at ∼150 kDa and ∼175 kDa, respectively CITATION; CITATION) in the GRP7 immunoprecipitates (FIG-REF) suggests that the association between GRP7 and PRRs occurs at the plasma membrane once the mature and functional PRRs have migrated through the secretory pathway. GRP7‐GFP shows a nucleo‐cytoplasmic subcellular localization in A. thaliana, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and N. benthamiana cells upon stable or transient expression (Supplementary Figures S4A and B; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments using split‐yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) following transient expression in N. benthamiana suggest that GRP7 and FLS2 closely associate (FIG-REF). This interaction occurs most likely at the plasma membrane, as indicated by the presence of the reconstituted YFP signal in typical cell wall–plasma membrane connections (called Hechtian strands) after cell plasmolysis (arrows in FIG-REF). An interaction at the cell periphery between GRP7 and EFR could also be observed (Supplementary Figure S3B). In exploratory experiments to identify GRP7 interactors in planta by immunoprecipitation using an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing GRP7 C‐terminally tagged with HA under the control of its native promoter (GRP7‐HA) (CITATION), we identified by mass‐spectrometry analysis of the GRP7‐HA immunoprecipitates several components of the 43S complex involved in protein translation (Supplementary Table S1). Before the initiation of active translation, the 43S complex recruits both mRNAs and ribosomes, and is composed of several initiation factors in addition to the cap‐binding protein eIF4E and the ribosomal 40S subunit (CITATION). Co‐immunoprecipitation experiments using the A. thaliana GRP7‐GFP transgenic line (CITATION) and specific antibodies further revealed the presence of eIF4E and the ribosomal subunit S14 in complex with GRP7 (FIG-REF). We used here the GRP7‐GFP line for consistency with previous targeted co‐immunoprecipitation experiments (FIG-REF). Interestingly, slower migrating bands of eIF4E were enriched in GRP7‐GFP immunoprecipitates in comparison to the main form detected in the input (see asterisks in FIG-REF). Strikingly, treatment with flg22 induced the dissociation of elF4E and S14 from the GRP7 complex (FIG-REF), indicating a potential dynamic link between GRP7, ligand‐activated PRRs and components of the translational machinery. [[FIGURE]] Next, we tested if HopU1 could directly affect FLS2 or the GRP7–FLS2 interaction. HopU1 did not interact with FLS2 in vivo as determined by co‐immunoprecipitation and split‐YFP experiments in N. benthamiana (Supplementary Figures S5A and B). Consistently, HopU1 did not mono‐ADP‐ribosylate FLS2 in vitro (Supplementary Figure S5C). Although HopU1 directly interacts with GRP7 in vivo (Supplementary Figure S6), HopU1 did not affect the interaction between GRP7 and FLS2 in an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing both GRP7‐GFP and HopU1‐HA (FIG-REF). In addition, HopU1 did not interfere, at least qualitatively, with the association or ligand‐induced dissociation between GRP7‐GFP and either elF4E or S14 (Supplementary Figure S7). Therefore, the effect of HopU1 on PTI responses is most likely not mediated by direct inhibition of PRRs or protein–protein interactions with GRP7. [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated the role of GRP7 in PTI in relation to its capacity to bind RNA by testing if GRP7 could bind PRR transcripts. Quantitative RNA‐immunoprecipitation assays using the A. thaliana GRP7‐HA (CITATION) transgenic line revealed that GRP7 binds FLS2 mRNAs in vivo independently of flg22 treatment (FIG-REF). As positive controls, we confirmed that GRP7 binds its own transcripts as well as transcripts of its closest paralogue GRP8 (FIG-REF), as previously reported in vitro (CITATION; CITATION). GRP7 binds the 3′‐UTR of its own transcript and of the GRP8 mRNA (CITATION). Similarly, we identified the 3′‐UTR as a binding region of GRP7 in the FLS2 mRNA (FIG-REF). In addition to the FLS2 mRNA, GRP7 could also bind the EFR transcript in vivo (Supplementary Figure S8A), consistent with the importance of GRP7 for responses triggered by both flg22 and elf18 (CITATION; FIG-REF). However, transcripts of the regulatory LRR‐RK BAK1 were not enriched in GRP7 immunoprecipitates (FIG-REF; Supplementary Figure S8A), revealing a certain degree of specificity. Interestingly, GRP8, which is also targeted by HopU1 (CITATION), is also able to bind FLS2 and EFR mRNAs (Supplementary Figure S9). These results demonstrate that GRP7, as well as GRP8, bind transcripts of the important PRRs FLS2 and EFR. [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated if HopU1 could affect the ability of GRP7 to bind its target mRNAs, including FLS2 and EFR transcripts. Using an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing both GRP7‐GFP and HopU1‐HA in quantitative RNA‐immunoprecipitation assays, we found that the amount of FLS2 and EFR transcripts bound to GRP7‐GFP was strongly reduced in the presence of HopU1 (FIG-REF; Supplementary Figure S8A). A similar effect was observed on the interaction between GRP7 and its own mRNA (FIG-REF; Supplementary Figure S8A). Furthermore, a GRP7(R49K) variant, which carries a mutation in a conserved arginine residue within the RRM RNA‐binding domain that is mono‐ADP‐ribosylated by HopU1 (CITATION), is strongly impaired in its ability to bind FLS2, EFR, GRP7 and GRP8 transcripts (FIG-REF; Supplementary Figure S8B). Furthermore, ADP ribosylation of GRP7 by HopU1 (but not by the catalytically inactive HopU1DD variant; CITATION; CITATION) completely blocks the binding of GRP7 to the 3′‐UTR of FLS2 mRNA in vitro (FIG-REF). Together, our results suggest that the mono‐ADP ribosylation of GRP7 by HopU1 disrupts in planta the ability of GRP7 to bind mRNAs of the PRRs FLS2 and EFR. [[FIGURE]] Because HopU1 inhibits GRP7–FLS2 mRNA binding (FIG-REF), we asked whether HopU1's action could ultimately affect FLS2 protein levels after translocation into A. thaliana cells during Pto DC3000 infection, which would correspond to the most biologically relevant observation. We observed that the amount of FLS2 protein increases (3.5‐ to 3.8‐fold) over 24 h in leaves infected with Pto DC3000 hrcC− (unable to secrete any T3SEs and therefore unable to dampen PTI) (FIG-REF), consistent with the previous observation that the expression of FLS2, EFR and other potential PRR‐encoding genes is PAMP inducible (CITATION, CITATION). Notably, this PAMP‐induced accumulation is attenuated by T3SEs (FIG-REF; compare hrcC− with WT). However, this T3SE‐mediated suppression was much less marked after inoculation with Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 (FIG-REF; compare ΔhopU1 with WT). Importantly, expression of HopU1 in trans on a plasmid in Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 restored the inhibition of FLS2 accumulation during infection, while trans‐complementation with the catalytically inactive HopU1DD variant (CITATION; CITATION) did not (FIG-REF). In addition, HopU1 does not affect BAK1 levels during infection (Supplementary Figure S10); consistent with our previous finding that GRP7 does not bind BAK1 mRNA (FIG-REF and FIG-REF; Supplementary Figure S8). [[FIGURE]] Notably, while the amount of cellular FLS2 mRNA increased during the first hours of infection with Pto DC3000 hrcC−, it decreased to a similar level upon infection with Pto DC3000 WT and ΔhopU1 (FIG-REF). The contrasting regulation and sensitivity to HopU1 of FLS2 mRNA and protein levels during infection further demonstrate that HopU1 regulates FLS2 post‐transcriptionally, while other T3SEs already regulate FLS2 at the transcriptional level. Consistent with FLS2 being an important virulence target for HopU1, we found that deletion of the flagellin‐encoding gene fliC in the ΔhopU1 background (Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 ΔfliC) suppresses the virulence defect of Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 and restores the virulence of Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 ΔfliC to a comparable level as Pto DC3000 ΔfliC on WT A. thaliana plants (FIG-REF). Together, these results indicate that HopU1 strongly affects the increased accumulation of FLS2 protein level normally observed during the first hours of A. thaliana infection by Pto DC3000.
!~MM~! A. thaliana, N. benthamiana and N. tabacum were grown at 20–21°C with a 10‐h‐photoperiod in environmentally controlled chambers. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefa) and 1% sucrose at 22°C with a 16‐h photoperiod. All experiments were performed in Col‐0 background, except if indicated otherwise. The fls2 mutant used in this study is SALK_093905. The GRP7ox (Col‐2/35S::GRP7), HopU1 (Col‐0/35S::HopU1‐HA), GRP7‐GFP (Col‐0/35S::GRP7‐GFP), GRP7‐HA (grp7‐1/GRP7p::GRP7‐HA) and GRP7(R49K)‐HA [grp7‐1/GRP7p::GRP7(R49K)‐HA] were previously published in CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION. The GRP7‐GFP/HopU1 line was obtained by crossing the GRP7‐GFP and HopU1 lines. The estradiol‐inducible HopU1 line (ind_HopU1) was obtained by transforming Col‐0 with the vector pLN604 (derived from pER8; CITATION) carrying hopU1‐HA. The expression of HopU1 was induced by spraying 15 μM β‐estradiol for 16–20 h. The GRP8‐HA (Col‐0/35S::GRP8‐HA) line was obtained by transforming Col‐0 with the binary vector pPZP212 carrying GRP8‐HA. Homozygous lines with a single transgene insertion were used for the experiments. PAMP treatments (flg22 and elf18 peptides synthetized by Peptron, South Korea; shrimp chitin from SIGMA) were performed by syringe infiltration of plant leaves or by addition of the elicitor into the liquid media. Oxidative burst assays were performed on leaf disks incubated in a solution containing luminol and peroxidase as previously described (CITATION). Callose deposition was observed after infiltration with a solution of 1 μM PAMP for 16 h as previously described (CITATION). Callose deposits were quantified using PDQuest software (Bio‐Rad). Bacterial strains used in this study were Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 WT, Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 and Pto DC3000 hrcC−. For bacterial enumeration assays, plants were sprayed with the strains WT (inoculum: 106 cfu/ml), ΔhopU1 (inoculum: 108 cfu/ml) and hrcC− (inoculum: 108 cfu/ml), in the presence of 0.001% (v/v) Silwet L‐77. Sprayed plants were then covered with a transparent plastic lid for the remaining of the experiment. For the other assays, bacteria were infiltrated into Arabidopsis leaves with the strains WT (inoculum: 5 × 107 cfu/ml), ΔhopU1 (inoculum: 108 cfu/ml) and hrcC− (inoculum: 108 cfu/ml). For the trans‐complementation experiment described in FIG-REF, pLN1981, encoding HopU1‐HA, and pLN1982, encoding HopU1DD‐HA, were electroporated into UNL141, the DC3000 ΔhopU1 mutant (CITATION). The ΔhopU1(HopU1) and ΔhopU1(HopU1DD) strains were confirmed to produce HopU1‐HA and HopU1DD‐HA prior to using these strains to infect Arabidopsis. The construction of ΔfliC mutant was done by unmarked mutagenesis (CITATION). A 1.9‐kb upstream (US) DNA sequence and 1.5‐kb downstream (DS) were amplified by PCR using the primers fliC us‐F (CACCGAGGTTACATGCAACGCCTG) and fliC us‐R (CATGATGAATTCCTCGTTGG) and fliC ds‐F (CACCCAGTAATATCGGCATGAG) and fliC‐R (CGCTGATCGAACCCTTGGTC). The purified PCR products were cloned into the pENTR/D‐TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Entry constructs were then recombined by LR reactions into pMK2017 for US sequence and pMK2016 for DS sequences. These plasmids were separately introduced into DC3000 and plated onto media selecting for integration of each plasmid into DC3000 genome. Deletion of fliC was performed following a previously published protocol (CITATION). For construction of the fliC hopU1 double mutant, ΔfliC was used as a background strain to generate a hopU1 deletion mutation via homologous recombination using constructs described in CITATION. The resulting mutants were confirmed with PCR using primers that annealed to the flanking regions of either fliC or hopU1. The coding region corresponding to the cytoplasmic part of EFR (EFRcyt) was cloned in the pLexA vector. The recombinant pLexA‐EFRcyt was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from infected Arabidopsis plants (CITATION) according to the indications of the manufacturer (LexA system‐based yeast two hybrid; CLONTECH). The coding region of GRP7 from the nucleotides 67 to 528 (corresponding to the region of the GRP7 clone identified during the initial screen) was re‐cloned in the pB42AD vector to retest the interaction. For the co‐immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization experiments, we used the following previously described constructs: 35S::GRP7‐eGFP (CITATION), 35S::EFR‐3 × HA (CITATION), 35S::FLS2‐3 × myc (CITATION), 35S::BAK1‐HA (CITATION), 35S::FLS2‐GFP‐His (CITATION) and 35S::HopU1‐HA (CITATION). The Agrobacterium strains GV3101 carrying the indicated constructs were syringe‐infiltrated in N. benthamiana or N. tabacum leaves at OD600=0.4–0.6 and samples were collected 2 days post infiltration. For the BiFC assays, we cloned the coding regions of FLS2, EFR, GRP7 and HopU1 into the BiFC binary vectors pAM‐PAT‐35S that were previously described in CITATION. The Agrobacterium strain GV3101 expressing the silencing suppressor P19 (CITATION) and carrying the indicated constructs were syringe‐infiltrated in N. benthamiana leaves at OD600=0.4–0.6. Confocal analyses for the subcellular localization and BiFC experiments were performed 2 days post infiltration using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Total proteins were extracted in a buffer including 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X‐100, 1% Igepal and protease inhibitors (Sigma). For co‐immunoprecipitation, anti‐HA beads (Roche) or anti‐GFP‐TRAP‐A beads (Chromotek) were incubated with total proteins and then washed with the extraction buffer. Proteins were fractioned on SDS–PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio‐Rad) and then detected using specific antibodies. FLS2 was detected using specific polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit as primary antisera. The anti‐S14‐1 antibodies were purchased (Agrisera, Sweden). The rabbit anti‐eIF4E antibody was a kind gift from Professor A Maule (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK). Epitope‐tagged proteins were detected with a peroxidase‐conjugated anti‐HA‐HRP (Santa Cruz); mouse monoclonal anti‐GFP antibodies (AMS); or anti‐HRP antibodies (Santa Cruz). The secondary anti‐rabbit‐HRP antibodies (Sigma) were used when appropriate. Immunodetection was performed with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (GE). Tandem mass‐spectrometry experiments have been performed as previously described (CITATION). HopU1‐His, GRP7‐GST and FLS2‐GST were affinity‐purified from Escherichia coli BL21 and the purity of the proteins was examined by SDS–PAGE. The ADP‐ribosylation assay was performed as previously (CITATION). After UV‐crosslinking treatments (120 MJ, 3 times using UV StratalinkerTM 2400, Stratagene), total proteins were extracted in extraction buffer including 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM PMSF, 10 units/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) and protease inhibitors (Sigma). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti‐HA affinity matrix (Roche) or anti‐GFP‐TRAP‐A beads (Chromotek). After this incubation, the beads were washed and the RNA‐GRP7 complexes were eluted by incubating at 60°C for 15 min in the elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3). A proteinase K treatment for 1 h at 60°C was then followed by RNA extraction and quantitative RT–PCR. In each experiment, transcript levels from the input have been normalized in comparison to the control samples (grp7/GRP7‐HA in FIG-REF and FIG-REF and Supplementary Figure S7B; HopU1 in FIG-REF and Supplementary Figure S7A; and Col‐0 in Supplementary Figure S8). The normalization of the transcript levels after RNA‐IP has been performed in comparison to the GRP7 transcript level in grp7/GRP7‐HA or GRP7‐GFP samples (FIG-REF, FIG-REF, Supplementary Figures S7A and B) or the GRP8 transcript level (Supplementary Figure S8). After RNA extraction (Tri Reagent, Sigma‐Aldrich), first‐strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCRs were performed from 1.5 μl of cDNA with SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma‐Aldrich) on a PTC‐200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Primers used are Ubox (At5g15400): 5′‐TGCGCTGCCAGATAATACACTATT‐3′ and 5′‐TGCTGCCCAACATCAGGTT‐3′ FLS2 (At5g46330): 5′‐ACTCTCCTCCAGGGGCTAAGGAT‐3′ and 5′‐AGCTAACAGCTCTCCAGGGATGG‐3′ EFR (At5g20480): 5′‐CGGATGAAGCAGTACGAGAA‐3′ and 5′‐CCATTCCTGAGGAGAACTTTG‐3′ BAK1 (At4g33430): 5′‐ACCGCCTCCTATCTCTCCTACACC‐3′ and 5′‐CTGGGTCCTCTTCAGCTGGTACA‐3′ GRP7 (At2g21660): 5′‐TGATGACAGAGCTCTTGAGACTGCC‐3′ and 5′‐TCCTCCTCCACCCTCGCGTCTACCGCCGCCA‐3′ GRP8 (At4g39260): 5′‐CAATGATGAAGATCTTCAAAGGACG‐3′ and 5′‐CTCGTAACCACCACCGCCTCCTCCTGAGTATCC‐3′ The 3'‐UTR sequence of FLS2 was amplified with the upstream primer GATGGTACCGAAGTTTAGCAGCAAAGC and the downstream primer GAGCTCGAGGTTCATCAAAACCAAATTTC. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the plasmid pBSK(‐) (Stratagene) and transcribed with T7 polymerase (Promega) in the presence of 10 μCi 32P CTP. The FLS2 3′‐UTR binding affinity was analysed with purified GRP7‐GST in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% NP‐40, 10 U SUPERase·In (Ambion), and 50 ng of 32P‐labelled FLS2 3′‐UTR. Inhibition of RNA binding ability by HopU1 was tested by first producing mono‐ADP‐ribosylated GRP7, then performing an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Four μM GRP7‐GST was incubated with 1 μM HopU1‐His or HopU1DD‐His in the standard ADP‐ribosylation reaction followed by analysis of RNA binding ability. For competition assays, unlabelled FLS2 3’‐UTR transcripts were added into the mixture of 2 μM GRP7‐GST and 50 ng of 32P‐labelled FLS2 3′‐UTR transcripts. The bound and free RNA probes were separated on 6% native PAGE and exposed to PhotoImage screen, then analysed by Storm 860 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical significances based on one‐way ANOVA were performed with Prism 5.01 software (GraphPad Software).
