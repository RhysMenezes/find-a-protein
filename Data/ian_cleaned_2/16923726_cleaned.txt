!~ABS~! Peroxisomes are organelles found in all eukaryotic cells. Peroxisomes import integral membrane proteins post-translationally, and PEX19 is a predominantly cytosolic, farnesylated protein of mammalian and yeast cells that binds multiple peroxisome membrane proteins and is required for their correct targeting/insertion to the peroxisome membrane. We report the characterisation of the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of PEX19 which is a predominantly cytosolic protein. AtPEX19 is encoded by two genes (designated AtPEX19-1 and AtPEX19-2) that are expressed in all tissues and at all developmental stages of the plant. Quantitative real time PCR shows that AtPEX19-1 and AtPEX19-2 have distinct expression profiles. Using in vitro translation and co-immunoprecipitation AtPEX19-1 was shown to bind to the Arabidopsis peroxisomal membrane protein PEX10. Additionally, bacterially expressed recombinant AtPEX19-1 was able to bind a fusion protein consisting of the C-terminus of PEX10 and glutathione S-transferase in pull-down assays, thereby demonstrating that non-farnesylated AtPEX19 can interact with the C-terminus of AtPEX10. Purified recombinant AtPEX19-1 was analysed by gel filtration chromatography and was found to have a molecular weight consistent with it forming a dimer and a dimer was detected in Arabidopsis cell extracts that was slightly destabilised in the presence of DTT. Moreover, cross-linking studies of native AtPEX19 suggest that in vivo it is the dimeric species of the protein that preferentially forms complexes with other proteins.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two reading frames At5g17550 and At3g03490 with significant homology to human PEX19 (28.2% amino acid identity) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex19p (24.5% amino acid identity) (Figure 1). An EST (ATTS4952 GI:773437) corresponding to At3g03490, which we have designated AtPEX19-1 was fully sequenced (accession number AJ564199). AtPEX19-1 and AtPEX19-2 are 82% identical to one another at the nucleotide level and 79% identical at the amino acid level. All four proteins share conserved CAAX box motifs at the carboxyl terminus. In addition there are two regions that are particularly well conserved. The first is a block of 13 alternating acidic and hydrophobic residues near the amino terminus that are predicted to form a perfect acidic amphipathic helix (http://www.site.uottawa.ca/∼turcotte/resources/HelixWheel/) and a second region in the C-terminal half of the protein that also shares alternating polar and hydrophobic residues and a predicted helical structure (Figure 1). Using the secondary structure prediction program GOR4, Arabidopsis PEX19-1 is estimated to be predominantly α-helical (58%) with a substantial proportion of random coil (36.7%) (CITATION) Combet C, Blanchet C, Geourjon C, Deleage G. NPS@: Network Protein Sequence Analysis. Trends Biochem Sci 2000; 25: 147–150 (CITATION), (CITATION), (CITATION) (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] To determine whether both genes were expressed, gene specific primers were designed and used in a reverse-transcription real time quantitative PCR reaction with cDNA derived from different Arabidopsis tissues. Both genes are expressed in all tissues including roots, leaves, flowers, siliques and stems, light and dark grown seedlings and cell culture, but have distinctive expression patterns (Figure 2A and 2B). For example PEX19-1 is expressed at a five-fold higher level in cell culture compared to root where as the expression of PEX19-2 is almost twice as high in root as in cell culture. On-line supplementary Figure 1A shows a more detailed expression pattern by tissue for PEX19-1 based on public microarray data. On-line supplementary Figure 1B shows expression of PEX19-1 as a function of plant age. PEX19-2 is not present on the affymetrix ATH_1 array.  [[FIGURE]] Antibodies were raised against recombinant His6T7PEX19-1, which detected a protein of about 30 kDa in 2-day Arabidopsis seedlings (Figure 3A, lane 3 left panel). This protein was absent when the antibodies were preincubated with the recombinant His6T7PEX19-1 (Figure 3A, right panel). The antibody readily detected 10 and even 1 ng of recombinant His6T7PEX19-1 which has a molecular weight of 31,842 (Figure 3A, left panel lanes 1 and 2). Due to the high degree of similarity between AtPEX19-1 and AtPEX19-2 we assume the antibody detects both isoforms in plant samples and therefore refer to the cross-reacting band as AtPEX19. To determine the localization of AtPEX19 in Arabidopsis cells we used a suspension culture cell line. These suspension culture cells have abundant peroxisomes as shown by electron microscopy (data not shown). Suspension culture cells were fractionated into a total membrane and soluble fraction and probed with anti-AtPEX19 antibodies. AtPEX19 was recovered predominantly in the soluble fraction (Figure 3B, lane S), with only a small proportion associated with the membrane fraction. (Figure 3B, lane M). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to prepare organelle fractions from tissue culture cells. The position of peroxisomes was determined by immunoblotting with the marker protein thiolase (Figure 3C, bottom panel). This shows that intact peroxisomes are found predominantly in fractions 8–13 with a substantial amount of thiolase found at the top of the gradient, which represents protein that has been released from damaged organelles. A duplicate blot was probed with anti-AtPEX19 antibodies, where native AtPEX19 was found at the top of the gradient. On very long exposures a trace of PEX19 was found associated with the peroxisome fraction (data not shown). Thus AtPEX19 is predominantly cytosolic.  [[FIGURE]] His6PEX19-1 was over expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli. The recombinant protein was purified to near homogeneity using nickel affinity chromatography (Figure 4B, lane ‘P’). The molecular mass as determined by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, was 30,479 (not shown), which was consistent with the calculated mass. However, when analysed by gel filtration chromatography in the absence of reducing agents, the purified protein began to elute at 110 ml, just after the 67 kDa calibration marker, corresponding to a protein of approximately 60 kDa (Figure 4A). The data suggests that His6PEX19-1 forms a dimer which is extremely stable, since little monomeric protein was observed. When analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE, His6PEX19-1 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of slightly greater than 30 kDa consistent with denatured, monomeric polypeptide chains (Figure 4B).  [[FIGURE]] The anti-PEX19 antibody detects a species of around 60 kDa in fractions derived from seedlings and cell cultures (Figure 3A, lane 3; Figure 3B all lanes), which caused us to consider if PEX19 might be dimeric in vivo. To address this, samples were extracted from cell cultures in the presence and absence of DTT and run on native gels (Figure 4C). Two immuno reactive species were seen with the faster migrating species increased slightly in abundance when samples were extracted in the presence of DTT. Cross-reaction of both species with the antibody was eliminated when the antibody was pre-incubated with recombinant PEX19 (Figure 4D). Thus PEX19 most likely forms a disulphide-bonded dimer. In other organisms PEX19 binds to a range of PMPs including PEX10 (CITATION) Snyder WB, Faber KN, Wenzel TJ, Koller A, Luers GH, Rangell L, Keller GA, Subramani S. Pex19p interacts with Pex3p and Pex10p and is essential for peroxisome biogenesis in Pichia pastoris. Mol Biol Cell 1999; 10: 1745–1761 (CITATION), (CITATION), (CITATION) (CITATION). The ability of AtPEX19-1 to bind to AtPEX10 was tested via co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 5). In vitro translations of the individual full length proteins were mixed, incubated together for 90 min at 30°C then were subjected to immunoprecipitation under non-denaturing conditions with either non-immune serum (PI) or anti His antibody (H). AtPEX10 (open arrow) was clearly co-immunoprecipitated with His6T7PEX19-1 (solid arrow) when anti-His tag antibody was used, but not when a non-immune serum was substituted for the primary antibody. AtPEX10 was equally efficiently precipitated with His6T7PEX19-1 regardless of whether the proteins were translated separately and mixed or translated together (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] To establish whether the recombinant His6PEX19-1 was able to bind AtPEX10, pull down experiments were performed. As full length AtPEX10 is unlikely to be soluble when expressed in E. coli, a fusion protein, GST–PEX10267-381 was constructed. This corresponds to the region of PEX10, C-terminal to the predicted second transmembrane domain and includes the entire RING finger. Lysates from E. coli cells expressing GST-PEX10267-381 or His6PEX19-1 were applied singly, or as a mixture, to glutathione columns. The unbound material was collected and the column washed with 20 column volumes of washing buffer prior to elution with glutathione. The fractions were analysed by Western blotting using antibodies against His6T7PEX19-1 and GST (Figure 6). Where lysate containing His6PEX19-1 was applied to the GST column on its own, (Figure 6A, middle panel) His6PEX19-1 was recovered in the flow through (FT) and wash (W) fractions but not in the eluate fraction (E). However, when lysate containing His6PEX19-1 was mixed with lysate containing GST-PEX10267-381, a portion of His6PEX19-1 was recovered in the glutathione eluate (Figure 6A, right most panel, lane E). When GST-PEX10267-381 alone was applied to the column, as expected there was no PEX19 immunoreactivity in any fraction (Figure 6A, left most panel). A duplicate blot to that shown in Figure 6A was probed with anti-GST antibodies (Figure 6B). GST-PEX10267-381 binds to the column and is eluted with glutathione (Figure 6B, left and right most panels). When His6PEX19-1 alone was applied to the column, no immunoreactivity was detected at the molecular weight corresponding to His6PEX19-1 (compare Figure 6A) showing that the anti-GST antibodies do not cross-react with His6PEX19-1. These results demonstrate that His6PEX19-1 is only retained on the glutathione column in the presence of GST-PEX10267-381. Therefore both in vitro translated and recombinant AtPEX19-1 bind to AtPEX10.  [[FIGURE]] To examine the binding characteristics of Arabidopsis PEX19 in vivo, whole suspension cell culture cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde and the cell lysate analysed by Western blotting (Figure 7). Evidence that AtPEX19 binds to other proteins was apparent, since when subjected to the cross-linking procedure, the majority of the protein migrated down the gel with apparent masses of greater than 160 kDa, suggesting that binding complexes made with other proteins were rendered permanent by the procedure (Figure 7A). Native AtPEX19 from the non-cross-linked cells migrated with molecular masses of approximately 30 and 60 kDa consistent with monomeric and dimeric protein. Interestingly, the band corresponding to the dimer was not observed in the cross-linked sample (Figure 7A, left lane), indicating that the dimer may be preferentially involved in the formation of complexes with other proteins. To eliminate the possibility that the band thought to be a dimer in the non-cross-linked sample, is a result of non-specific binding by the antisera, samples were also analysed by Western blot using antisera incubated with 10 µg recombinant His6PEX19-1 prior to immunodecoration of the blot (Figure 7B).

!~MM~! Molecular biology methods were carried out according to Sambrook and Russell (CITATION) Sambrook J, Russell DW. Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual. 3rd ed. New York: Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press; 2001. (CITATION). EST clone ATTS4952 encoding AtPEX19-1 was obtained from Dr Thierry Desprez, INRA, Versailles, France. The PEX19-1 (At3g03490) reading frame was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCGGAATTCGGCGAACAGTCACACCGAT-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCTCGAGTCACATGATACAGCAATT-3′ that introduced an EcoRI site adjacent to the second amino acid (Ala) and an XhoI site down stream of the termination codon, and recloned into pET28(b) (Novagen) cut with the same restriction enzymes. The encoded protein is referred to as His6T7PEX19-1 as it contains both the His and T7 tags N-terminal to PEX19 and has a theoretical pI of 5.00 and Mw of 31,842. A similar construct where PEX19-1 was cloned into the NheI-SacI sites of pET28(a) was obtained from Dr Susanna Cristobal, Uppsala University, Sweden. This encodes a protein we refer to as His6PEX19-1 as it lacks the T7 tag and has a theoretical pI of 5.00 and Mw of 30,482. When expressed in E. coli His6T7PEX19-1 is insoluble but can be solubilized and refolded whereas His6PEX19-1 is expressed in a soluble form. His6T7PEX19-1 was used for antibody production and the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. His6PEX19-1 was used in all other experiments. The carboxyl terminal region of AtPEX10 (At2g26350) cDNA was amplified using Gateway™ primers (forward strand 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGCGTCGGAGTAATTTGTCA-3′ and reverse strand 3′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTCTAAAAATCAGAATGATACAA-5′) with PfuTurbo proofreading DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was inserted in the Gateway™ donor vector pDONR201 (Invitrogen) via the Gateway™ BP reaction and then transferred into pDEST15 (Invitrogen) via the Gateway™ LR reaction. His6PEX19-1 and GST-PEX10267-381 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and His6T7PEX19-1 in BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus RIL cells (Invitrogen), as described (Novagen pET hand book. 10th ed. (www.novagen.com). The majority of the His6T7PEX19-1 protein was insoluble, and so the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5M NaCl, 8M urea (50 µl/ml culture) and solubilized protein was purified by passage over a Ni2 + column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein was dialysed overnight at 4°C against 20 mM Na phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Scottish Antibody Production Unit, Carluke, Scotland, UK). The pellet of cells expressing His6PEX19-1 was resuspended in 50 ml 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, containing 20 mg lysozyme and a Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). The suspensions were incubated for 20 min on ice, sonicated 6 times for 30 sec on/30 sec off, and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 5°C. Soluble His6PEX19-1 was purified on a 5 ml Hi-Trap nickel affinity column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For molecular weight estimation using gel filtration chromatography, 1.5 ml of purified His6PEX19-1 (10 mg/ml) was applied in 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, to a Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. For the production of soluble GST-PEX10267-381, when absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.4, it was heat-shocked at 45°C for 20 min then cooled rapidly to 18°C. IPTG was added to 0.5 mM and the culture incubated at 18°C, 200 rpm for a further 4 h. Cell pellets from 400 ml cultures of BL21(DE3)pLysS expressing His6PEX19-1 and BL21(DE3)pLysS expressing GST-PEX10267-381 were individually resuspended in 10 ml PBS, 1 mM DTT containing 5 mg lysozyme and a Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). The suspensions were incubated for 20 min on ice then sonicated 6 times for 30 sec on/30 sec off, before centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min at 5°C. The supernatants (3 ml) were applied to a 1 ml glutathione agarose column (Sigma) either singly or as a mixture. The column was washed with 20 ml PBS and bound proteins eluted stepwise with PBS containing 10 mM reduced glutathione in 2 ml fractions. The fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. His6PEX19-1 was visualized using antisera raised to His6T7PEX19-1 at a 1:10,000 dilution followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-horse radish peroxidase (Sigma, 1:10,000 dilution) with enhanced chemiluminescent detection. GST-PEX10267-381 was visualised using anti-GST antibodies (Sigma G7781). Arabidosis cells suspension (CITATION) Tugal HB, Pool M, Baker A. Arabidopsis 22-kilodalton peroxisomal membrane protein.

Plant Physiol 1999; 120: 309–320 (CITATION) were grown in 100 ml MS medium (4.43g/l, sucrose 30g/l, NAA 0.5mg/l, and Kinetin 0.05mg/l, pH, 5.8) at 24°C under dim light with a 16-h photoperiod in a rotary shaker at 110 rpm. The cells were split every seven days at a 1:10 dilution into the same media. A 100 ml culture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm, the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To quench the reaction glycine was added to a final concentration of 300 mM in PBS and incubated for a further 30 min. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm and washed by re-suspension in PBS before further centrifugation and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. 5g of frozen cells were ground to powder under liquid nitrogen and added to 15 ml 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS containing 1 µM E-64 (Sigma), 1 Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) and 100 µl Plant Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The suspension was agitated for 30 min at 4°C before centrifugation at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 65°C for 3 min before immediate analysis by Western blotting as previously described. Isolation and sucrose gradient isolation of organelles, in the presence of 3 mM DTT, was carried out as in (CITATION) Lisenbee CS, Heinze M, Trelease RN. Peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase resides within a subdomain of rough endoplasmic reticulum in wild-type Arabidopsis cells. Plant Physiol 2003; 132: 870–882 (CITATION), except the gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 5 h at 26,000 rpm (4°C). Protein and sucrose concentrations were estimated as in (CITATION) Lisenbee CS, Heinze M, Trelease RN. Peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase resides within a subdomain of rough endoplasmic reticulum in wild-type Arabidopsis cells. Plant Physiol 2003; 132: 870–882 (CITATION) except the protein standard was BSA. To separate soluble and membrane fractions, cell cultures were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted as for the sucrose gradients, in the presence and absence of 3 mM DTT. The extracts were centrifuged in a Beckman TLS 55 rotor at 55,000 rpm (259,000 g) for 30 min (4°C), and the membranes were resuspended in the starting volume of extraction buffer. These fractions were run on Tris/Glycine PAGE with SDS (denaturing gels) and without SDS (native gels). Western blotting was carried out as previously described. Anti-His6T7PEX19 serum was used at 1:5,000–1:10,000 dilution. Anti-thiolase serum was used at 1:50,000 dilution. His6T7PEX19-1 and PEX10 (in pGEM-T easy) were transcribed and translated in a coupled wheatgerm lysate system (TNT) in the presence of [35S] L-methionine according to the manufacturers (Promega) protocol. After 90 min at 30°C, equal volumes (25 µl) of His6T7PEX19-1 and PEX10 translation reactions were mixed and incubated for a further 90 min at 30°C then 22 microlitres of each reaction were diluted into 0.55 ml IP buffer and the immunoprecipitation carried out according to (CITATION) Lopez-Huertas E, Oh JS, Baker A. Antibodies against Pex14p block ATP-independent binding of matrix proteins to peroxisomes in vitro. FEBS Lett 1999; 459: 227–229 (CITATION) using either non-immune antiserum or anti poly-His antiserum (Sigma H1029). Siliconized tubes were used to avoid non-specific binding of radio-labelled proteins. Arabidopsis thaliana adult plants were grown in soil (3:3:1 compost:sand:perlite, Sinclair Horticulture Ltd. containing Intercept™, 0.28 g/l) in a glass-house at 22°C without supplementary light. Flowers consisted of open and closed flowers with their pedicels and younger stages to the floral meristem. Siliques comprised young stages with the outer floral whorls drying to more mature siliques starting to yellow. Leaf tissue consisted of a mixture of cauline and rosette leaves with their pedicels. Tissues were collected mid-morning and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen. For light and dark-grown seedlings seeds were plated onto 1/2MS media (Duchefa) containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.9% (w/v) plant agar (Duchefa), stratified at 5°C for four days then grown at 22°C with a 16 h: 8 h L: D cycle. Plates for dark-grown seedlings were wrapped in two layers of aluminium foil and placed alongside plates for light-grown seedlings. After 7 days, seedlings were harvested under green-filtered, dim light into containers in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen, dispersed in extraction buffer (Tris.HCl, pH 7.9, NaCl, 150mM, EDTA 1mM and SDS 1% (w/v)) and purified by phenol:chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation and LiCl precipitation (CITATION) Sambrook J, Russell DW. Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual. 3rd ed. New York: Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press; 2001. (CITATION). Genomic DNA was removed and RNA further purified on Qiagen columns by two on-column DNase I digestions according to manufacturers instructions. cDNA was synthesized from RNA (2 µg) according to manufacturers protocols (Superscript II, Invitrogen) except a 40 µl reaction volume was used. For quantitative PCR, reaction products were diluted 5-fold before use. Gene-specific primers PEX19-1F 5′TCATGCAAAAGATGCAGGAA-3, PEX19-1R 5′GAAGCTGTTTGGCCCCAT-3′, PEX19-2F 5′AACTGTTTGGCCTTGTCCAG-3′ and PEX19-2 R 5′GAACAAGAACCGAAACCCAAT-3′ were used at concentrations of 400 nM and 300 nM respectively with 2 µl of cDNA, water or standard in a 25 µl reaction containing 12.5 µl 2x SybrMix (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Actin-2 primers were as described (CITATION) Charlton W, Matsui K, Johnson B, Graham IA, Ohme-Takagi M, Baker A. Salt-induced expression of peroxisome-associated genes requires components of the ethylene, jasmonate and abscisic acid signalling pathways. Plant Cell Environ 2005; 28: 513–524 (CITATION). Amplifications were carried out on an Icycler instrument (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The reactions produced threshold values which were converted to starting quantities using a standard curve constructed from a pool of cDNAs from the various tissues serially diluted five-fold and amplified using PEX19-1, PEX19-2 and Actin-2 gene specific primers.
