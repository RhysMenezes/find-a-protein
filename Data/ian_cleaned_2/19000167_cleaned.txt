!~ABS~! Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases are important negative regulators in the MAPK signaling pathways responsible for many essential processes in plants, including development, stress management and hormonal responses. A mutation in INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID-RESPONSE5 (IBR5), which is predicted to encode a dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase, was previously reported to confer reduced sensitivity to auxin and ABA in Arabidopsis roots. To further characterize IBR5, and to understand how it might help integrate MAPK cascades with hormone signaling, we searched for IBR5-interacting MAPKs. Yeast two-hybrid assays, in vitro binding assays and in vivo protein co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that MPK12 and IBR5 are physically coupled. The C-terminus of MPK12 appears to be essential for its interaction with IBR5, and in vitro dephosphorylation and immunocomplex kinase assays indicated that activated MPK12 is efficiently dephosphorylated and inactivated by IBR5. MPK12 and IBR5 mRNAs are both widely expressed across Arabidopsis tissues, and at the subcellular level each protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus. In transgenic plants with reduced expression of the MPK12 gene, root growth is hypersensitive to exogenous auxins, but shows normal ABA sensitivity. MPK12 suppression in an ibr5 background partially complements the ibr5 auxin-insensitivity phenotype. Our results demonstrate that IBR5 is a bona fide MAPK phosphatase, and suggest that MPK12 is both a physiological substrate of IBR5 and a novel negative regulator of auxin signaling in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! It has been reported that the inactivation of MAPKs by dual-specificity MKPs involves the formation of a physical complex between the phosphatase and its substrate MAPK (CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether the IBR5 protein can interact directly with any of the Arabidopsis MAPKs, we used a directed yeast two-hybrid assay to evaluate the ability of IBR5 to interact with all 20 members of the Arabidopsis MAPK family. For each pair-wise test, IBR5 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 served as the bait protein, whereas a MAPK fused to the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 served as the prey. We found that IBR5 strongly and specifically interacts with MPK12 but not with any other Arabidopsis MAPKs (Figure 1a). The interaction between IBR5 and MPK12 was confirmed by selectable marker and β-galactosidase reporter activation upon co-transformation of IBR5 and MPK12 in bait and prey vectors, and vice versa. [[FIGURE]] While IBR5 binds specifically to MPK12 in yeast, we wished to confirm that the observed two-hybrid interaction reflected a direct physical contact. A polyclonal MPK12 antiserum raised against a MPK12-specific peptide was shown to detect recombinant MPK12 expressed in Escherichia coli (Figure 1b), and this was used in an in vitro binding assay. Recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)–IBR5 and GST–MPK12 were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, after which GST was removed from recombinant GST–MPK12 by proteolytic cleavage. Following co-incubation of GST–IBR5 and MPK12 proteins, the mixture was fractionated over a glutathione column and the eluates were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and western blot analysis, using MPK12-specific antibodies. In agreement with the two-hybrid data, MPK12 was retained on immobilized GST–IBR5, whereas immobilized GST alone was unable to retain any MPK12 (Figure 1c). To confirm that IBR5 also interacts with MPK12 in vivo, we transiently expressed full-length hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IBR5 and myc-tagged MPK12 cDNA clones simultaneously in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Total protoplast protein was subsequently extracted, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-MPK12 serum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HA or anti-myc serum. While the anti-MPK12 antiserum was able to pull down both MPK12 and IBR5, the pre-immune serum failed to co-precipitate any detectable IBR5 (Figure 1d). The interaction between IBR5 and MPK12 thus occurs both in vitro and in vivo. To characterize the structural requirements of the interaction, deletion variants of MPK12 were fused to the GAL4 activation domain and assayed against IBR5 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The carboxyl-terminal region of MPK12 (residues 210–372) proved to be sufficient for the interaction with IBR5 in yeast, whereas the amino-terminal region of MPK12 with (N+KD) or without (N) the sequence of residues required for activation of MPK12 produced no interaction (Figure 2). To determine if catalytic activity of MPK12 is important for binding to IBR5, we also generated a kinase-inactive form of the MAPK by mutagenizing its ATP-binding site to replace the essential K residue with R. This mutant protein (KIMPK12) was found to interact with IBR5 as efficiently as the wild-type (WT) protein in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 2). These results collectively indicate that IBR5 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of MPK12 and that kinase activity of MPK12 is not required for this interaction. [[FIGURE]] The activity of a MAPK is dependent on the phosphorylation status of its –TXY– motif (CITATION), and these phospho-amino acid residues are also the target of MKP activity. To establish that IBR5 is catalytically active, we used the synthetic phosphatase substrate 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP), and found that the GST–IBR5 could dephosphorylate OMFP in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3a). [[FIGURE]] Since only MPK12 was capable of interacting with IBR5, we asked whether phosphorylated MPK12 (phospho-MPK12) can also serve as an IBR5 substrate. Since MAPK dephosphorylation assays require dually phosphorylated recombinant MPK12 as a substrate, and the Arabidopsis MAPKK(s) normally responsible for phosphorylating MPK12 in vivo is/are unknown, preparation of phospho-MPK12 required that we first screen an array of candidate Arabidopsis MAPKKs for this activity. Purified kinase-inactive MPK12 (GST–KIMPK12) protein was incubated with ‘constitutively activated’ forms (GST–CAMKKs) of each of the eight Arabidopsis MAPKKs that are thought to represent functional MKK enzymes (CITATION). When the incubation products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed on a western blot using an anti-pERK antibody that recognizes only the dually phosphorylated form of MAPK, we observed that several upstream MAPKKs, including MKK6, possess the ability to phosphorylate MPK12 in vitro (Figure 3b). The ability of IBR5 to dephosphorylate the –pTEpY– motif of phospho-MPK12 in vitro was then tested by incubating different concentrations of recombinant GST–IBR5 with equal amounts of purified phospho-MPK12 and monitoring the disappearance of the –pTXpY– immuno-signal by western blot analysis. The abundance of the dually phosphorylated form of MPK12 decreased in an IBR5-dose-dependent manner, whereas incubation of phospho-MPK12 with GST alone had no effect (Figure 3c). The efficiency with which IBR5 dephosphorylated MPK12 was markedly increased after cleavage of the GST tag from GST–IBR5 (Figure 3d). To test whether IBR5 is also capable of inactivating MPK12 in Arabidopsis, protoplasts were co-transformed with both HA-tagged IBR5 and myc-tagged MPK12. After immunoprecipitation of MPK12, its activity was determined by in vitro kinase assays using myelin basic protein (MBP) as the substrate. Increasing amounts of the IBR5-expressing plasmid co-transformed with MPK12 resulted in the dose-dependent inactivation of MPK12 (Figure 4a). Immunoprecipitation of native MPK12 from both WT and ibr5 plants, followed by western blotting to assess MAPK activation, also demonstrated that MPK12 displays higher endogenous activity in the ibr5 background (Figure 4b). [[FIGURE]] IBR5 demonstrates specificity toward its MPK substrates, since the recombinant phosphatase lacks the ability to dephosphorylate another phospho-MPK, pMPK3, in vitro (Figure S1). Similarly, dephosphorylation of MPK12 is not a general property of Arabidopsis MKP proteins, since another Arabidopsis MKP, AtMKP2, was earlier shown to be unable to dephosphorylate and inactivate MPK12 (CITATION) (Figure 4a). Taken together, these results show that IBR5 is an active phosphatase that is able to both bind MPK12 and inactivate the activated form of this specific MAPK, in vitro and in vivo. If the observed functional interaction between MPK12 and IBR5 plays a role in one or more biological processes in vivo, it is anticipated that the expression patterns of the corresponding genes would at least partially overlap, and that the two proteins would be located in the same subcellular compartment. The RT-PCR analysis detected MPK12 mRNA in all Arabidopsis tissues tested (Figure 5a). Although the abundance of MPK12 transcripts was relatively low in the mature roots, these results indicate that MPK12 could be active in most parts of the plant, as earlier reported for IBR5 as well. A more fine-grained analysis of MPK12 gene expression was obtained by generating transgenic plants containing a MPK12 promoter DNA fragment fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. As shown in Figure 5(b), GUS was expressed in most tissues of Arabidopsis seedlings. Interestingly, however, in more mature tissues GUS expression was most strongly associated with guard cells in the epidermis of the various organs examined (Figure 5b), a pattern that differs markedly from that of IBR5 (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To examine the subcellular localization of these two interacting proteins, transgenic plants expressing either a CaMV35S::green fluorescent protein (GFP)–MPK12 construct, or a CaMV35S::yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–IBR5 construct, were produced. The YFP–IBR5 gene fusion fully complemented the ibr5 mutant phenotype (data not shown), indicating that the chimeric protein provided functional IBR5 activity. Confocal microscopic analysis of the resulting GFP:MPK12 and YFP:IBR5 transgenic plants revealed a strong fluorescent signal in the nucleus for both chimeric constructs, whereas control plants expressing GFP or YFP alone (constructs 35S:GFP and 35S:YFP) displayed fluorescence throughout both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figure 5c). Since the roots of ibr5 mutants have decreased sensitivity to auxin and ABA (CITATION), and MPK12 appears likely to be a substrate for this phosphatase, we examined the role of MPK12 in the response to these hormones. We initially sought homozygous exon insertion lines for MPK12, using the SALK_074849 and SALK_075365 lines we obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) stock collection. In the case of SALK_074849, we could confirm the T-DNA insertion in the first exon by sequence analysis, but since more than 100 progeny screened by PCR were either WT or heterozygous for the insertion event, we concluded that homozygous SALK_074849 plants may not be viable. For the SALK_075365 stock, we could not confirm any T-DNA insertion in the MPK12 locus. In the absence of knock-out mutants, we chose to use inducible RNA interference (RNAi) suppression to specifically downregulate the expression of MPK12 in vivo. A 300-bp fragment of the MPK12 3′-end, the region with the highest sequence divergence from all other AtMPK genes, was selected to generate the MPK12RNAi construct, which was placed under the control of a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible promoter (CITATION). Arabidopsis thaliana plants were transformed with this construct, and multiple transgenic lines were selected for evaluation. A series of T2-generation plants carrying the MPK12RNAi insert were treated with 30-μm DEX for 24 h and the level of expression of the endogenous MPK12 gene was assessed by RT-PCR (Figure 6a). The MPK12RNAi-induced silencing appeared to be specific, since the mRNA levels for MPK4 and MPK11, the two MAPKs most closely related to MPK12, were not affected in these transgenic plants (Figure 6a). From among the most strongly MPK12-suppressed RNAi lines, two independent lines (L9 and L17) were chosen for further characterization. [[FIGURE]] We first compared the effect of auxin and ABA on the rate of primary root growth in MPK12RNAi plants with their effect in control (empty vector) plants. As shown in Figure 6(b) and Figure S2, empty vector (EV) and MPK12RNAi lines all grew normally and displayed a WT root growth phenotype after DEX induction. However, in the presence of auxins [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)], root growth of DEX-induced MPK12RNAi seedlings was markedly reduced relative to the effect of these auxins on roots of control (WT and EV) plants. The hypersensitivity of MPK12RNAi plants to auxin is the reverse of the reduced auxin responsiveness phenotype of ibr5-3 mutants (Figure S3). On the other hand, we observed no change in root growth sensitivity to ABA in MPK12-suppressed plants, although reduced sensitivity to ABA was reported to accompany the auxin responsiveness phenotype in the ibr5 mutant (CITATION) (Figure S4a). When we examined the expression profiles of various auxin- and ABA-regulated genes in EV, ibr5-3 and MPK12-suppressed plants under either control or auxin/ABA-treatment conditions, we observed that auxin-induced genes such as GH3.3 and SAUR10 are expressed at a higher level in MPK12RNAi plants compared with control (EV) in response to auxin treatment (Figure 6c). To confirm this altered expression of auxin-inducible genes, the MPK12RNAi line was crossed to plants containing the DR5:GUS auxin-responsive reporter gene (CITATION). Silencing of MPK12 did not alter the expression of the DR5:GUS reporter in the absence of auxin (Figure S5), but DEX-treated MPK12RNAi seedlings exposed to auxin showed increased expression of this reporter in roots and cotyledons compared with the control (DEX-untreated MPK12RNAi line) (five independent lines tested) (Figures 6d and S5). On the other hand, we detected no obvious differences between the MPK12RNAi and EV lines in expression of ABA-regulated genes after ABA treatment (Figure S4b), consistent with the lack of effect of MKP12 suppression in the root growth ABA sensitivity assay. The ability of IBR5 to dephosphorylate MPK12, together with the reciprocal patterns of auxin sensitivity in the respective mutants, would suggest that failure to inactivate MPK12 in the IBR5 loss-of-function background is at least partially responsible for the ibr5 auxin insensitivity. When the MPK12RNAi construct was transferred into the ibr5-3 mutant background, the root growth in the resulting plants displayed auxin sensitivity intermediate between that of ibr5 and WT plants (Figure 6e), indicating that reduction of MPK12 function can partially restore normal auxin signaling in this system. Since auxin signaling appears to be mediated, at least in part, through MPK12, we asked whether MPK12 is activated in vivo in response to auxin. For this purpose, we transiently expressed myc-tagged MPK12 in Arabidopsis protoplasts, and subsequently treated for 10 min with 20 μm NAA. After immunoprecipitation of the MPK12 with anti-myc antibody, its activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Figure 7, immunoprecipitated MPK12 displayed only weak activity before the auxin treatment, but this activity was strikingly increased in NAA-treated protoplasts, in the absence of any co-expressed MKK.

!~MM~! The ProQuest yeast two-hybrid system (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/) was used. pDEST32-IBR5 and each of the 20 Arabidopsis MAPKs (in pDEST22 vector) were introduced into the yeast strain, MaV203. Positive clones were isolated on the basis of three selectable markers: HIS3, URA3 and LacZ. Deletion constructs of MPK12 were generated by PCR and subcloned into pDEST22. Positive interactions were indicated by activation of HIS3 or URA3 and quantified by a liquid β-galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transient expression assays were performed with protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of 3- to 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants. The open reading frames of MPK12 and IBR5 were cloned in frame with an N-terminal Myc or HA tag into the pUC19 vector under the control of the double 35S enhancer promoter of CaMV followed by the translational enhancer from the 5′-leader of tobacco mosaic virus, and terminated by a 3′-untranslated region derived from the nopaline synthetase gene (CITATION). The procedures for protoplast isolation and transfection assays have been described previously (CITATION). Extracts prepared from the protoplasts were then used for immunocomplex assay with antibodies raised against MPK12, HA or Myc. The kinase-inactive mutant MAPKs and constitutively active mutant MAPKKs were generated by QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com/) and confirmed by sequencing. The conserved Lys residues in the ATP-binding domains of MAPKs were replaced by Arg to block activity (K67R for KIMPK3 and K70R for KIMPK12), or the Ser or Thr residues in the activation loop in MKKs were replaced with acidic residues to create a constitutively active kinase (T218E and S224D for CAMKK1, T220D and T226E for CAMKK2, S235E and T241D for CAMKK3, T224D and S230E for CAMKK4, T215E and S221E for CAMKK5, S221D and T227E for CAMKK6, S193E and S199D for CAMKK7 and S195E and S201E for CAMKK9). Full-length cDNAs corresponding to open reading frames of MPK3 (At3g45640), MPK12 (At2g46070), MKK1 (At4g26070), MKK2 (At4g29810), MKK3 (At5g40440), MKK4 (At1g51660), MKK5 (At3g21220), MKK6 (At5g56580), MKK7 (At1g18350), MKK9 (At1g73500) and IBR5 (At2g04550) were amplified by PCR. The amplicons were purified and digested by the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned in either the pGEX 4T-2 or pDEST15 vector, which expresses the recombinant protein with a N-terminal GST tag. Wild-type and mutant recombinant KIMPK3, KIMPK12, CAMKK1, CAMKK2, CAMKK3, CAMKK4, CAMKK5, CAMKK6, CAMKK7, CAMKK9 and IBR5 were expressed as GST fusion proteins, as previously described (CITATION). The protein concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined with the Bio-Rad detection system (http://www.bio-rad.com/) using BSA as a standard, and the purity of the protein fractions was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after 10% SDS-PAGE. The GST, GST–IBR5 and GST–MPK12 proteins were expressed in E. coli and the GST sequences were removed from recombinant GST–MPK12 by proteolytic cleavage. The GST or GST-IBR5 proteins were bound to a glutathione Sepharose 4B column and the loaded matrix was then incubated with purified MPK12 protein in binding buffer [20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg ml−1 BSA and 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche, http://www.roche.com/)] for 4 h at 4°C with gentle shaking. After three washes with PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), GST or GST–IBR5 protein bound to the column was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (TRIS)–HCl at pH 8. The eluted proteins were concentrated, fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blot hybridization using anti-MPK12 antibody. Phosphatase activity of IBR5 was assayed at 22°C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm TRIS–HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 500 μm OMFP in a final volume of 0.8 ml. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.2 ml 5 mNaOH, and the amount of product (3-O-methylfluorescein) was determined from the absorbance at 477 nm. The in vitro dephosphorylation assay was conducted essentially as described previously, but with phospho-MPK12 as the substrate (CITATION). To prepare phosphorylated MPK12, recombinant GST–CAMKK6 was incubated with recombinant GST–KIMPK12. Recombinant GST–CAMKK4 was incubated with recombinant GST–KIMPK3 for preparation of phosphorylated MPK3. To dephosphorylate the phospho-MPK3 or phospho-MPK12 proteins, recombinant GST or IBR5 protein was incubated with the phosphorylated MPK3 or MPK12 preparation. The phosphorylation state of GST–KIMPK3 and GST–KIMPK12 was visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-pERK antibody (New England Biolabs, http://www.neb.com/) which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated –pTXpY– motif in phospho-MPK3 and phospho-MPK12. For immunocomplex kinase assays, immunoprecipitated MPK12 was incubated (30 min; 30°C) in 25 μl kinase buffer containing 5 μg MBP and 200 μm ATP with or without 3 μCi [32P-γ]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed by either western blotting with anti-phospho-MBP antibody or autoradiography. Total RNA from different plant tissues, intact 3-week-old plants or 8-day-old seedlings grown on ½ MS supplemented with 10 μm DEX, with or without 1 μm IAA or 100 μm ABA treatments, was isolated with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com/) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RT-PCR was performed as described (CITATION) using the following primers: ACT8 forward, 5′-ATTAAGGTCGTGGCA-3′; ACT8 reverse, 5′-TCCGAGTTTGAAGAGGCTAC-3′; MPK12 forward, 5′-CACCATGTCTGGAGAATCAAGCTCT-3′; MPK12 reverse, 5′-TCAGTGGTCAGGATTGAATT-3′; GH3.3 forward, 5′-ATGGAGGAGTCGTTGAACTCTGTG-3′; GH3.3 reverse, 5′-AAGCTCCATTATTGGCGTGAAACTC-3′; SAUR10 forward, 5′-CGAAGTCGGTACATCGTTCCTATC-3′; SAUR10 reverse, 5′-CATGGAGATAAGAGACCTGAAGAAGA-3′; ABI5 forward, 5′-TGACGTCAGAGCGAGAAGTAGAG-3′; ABI5 reverse, CGTTCTGAGCATTGTTCTGTC-3′; RD29A forward, 5′-ATGGATCAAACAGAGGAACCAC-3′; RD29A reverse, 5′-CGACTCTTCCTCCAACGTTATC-3′; KIN1 forward, 5′-ACCAACAAGAATGCCTTCCA-3′; KIN1 reverse 5′-CCGCATCCGATACACTCTTT-3′. A 1.3-kb genomic fragment containing the MPK12 promoter sequence was amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into the pCAMBIA1381Z binary vector, forming a MPK12 promoter:GUS fusion, which was transformed into WT Columbia (Col-0) Arabidopsis plants. Histochemical analysis of the GUS reporter gene was performed as described (CITATION) using T2MPK12pro:GUS transgenic plants of different developmental ages. For the DR5/MKP2RNAi analysis, five progeny from each of two MPK12RNAi/DR5:GUS crosses were analyzed. Roots from 5-day-old transgenic plants harboring either 35S:GFP, 35S:GFP:MPK12, 35S:YFP or 35S:YFP:IBR5 were examined by confocal microscopy, using a LSM 5 Pascal Exciter laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, http://www.zeiss.com/) equipped with an argon laser. The 488-nm and 514-nm lines of the argon laser were used for GFP and YFP excitation, respectively, along with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 oil-immersion lens. The unique C-terminal region of MPK12 was PCR-amplified with the following primer pairs: 5′-CCGCTCGAGGATACCCGAAACAACAGTTTGCTGC-3′/5′-CGGAATTCCTATGAGCTGCAAAAACTACTTACCTCAATCAAATCATTCAAACATGTTTCT-3′ and 5′-GGACTAGTGATACCCGAAACAACAGTTTGCTGC-3′/5′-CGGAATTCAATCAAATCATTCAAACATGTTTCTC-3′. The PCR products were ligated to the minimal fourth intron of the AtMPK6 gene in both sense and antisense orientations (CITATION). The resulting construct was then cloned into pTA7002, which placed the RNAi construct under the control of the DEX-inducible promoter (CITATION). This binary vector construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and then transformed into Arabidopsis using the floral dip method (CITATION). Expression of the MPK12RNAi construct in the transgenic lines was induced by growing seedlings on ½ MS medium supplemented with DEX at the indicated concentrations, or with the corresponding concentration of ethanol used to dissolve the 30 mm DEX stock. To make ibr5/MPK12RNAi double mutants, two MPK12RNAi lines (L9 and L17) with drastically reduced levels of MPK12 RNA transcripts were crossed with ibr5-3. The resulting F1 plants were selfed after genotyping and the F3 progeny of these lines used for phenotype and genotype analyses. All seeds used for root growth analysis were freshly harvested from plants grown under a 16-h light/8-h dark growth regime. The seeds were surface-sterilized and placed on ½ MS plates, with or without appropriate concentrations of auxin (IAA, IBA or 2,4-D) and DEX (10 μm). Eight days after germination, the roots were photographed and measured. To measure root elongation inhibition by ABA, seedlings were grown for 4 days on ½ MS plates, transferred to medium supplemented with or without 25 or 50 μm ABA and DEX (10 μm) and grown for an additional 4 days, after which the entire primary root was photographed and measured.
