!~ABS~! A number of protein and RNA-processing mutants have been shown to affect ABA sensitivity. A new mutant, sad2-1, was isolated from a T-DNA mutagenized population of RD29A:LUC plants and shown to have increased luminescence after ABA, salt, cold or polyethylene glycol treatments. Expression of several ABA- and stress-responsive genes was higher in the mutant than in the wild type. sad2-1 also exhibited ABA hypersensitivity in seed germination and seedling growth. SAD2 was found to encode an importin β-domain family protein likely to be involved in nuclear transport. SAD2 was expressed at a low level in all tissues examined except flowers, but SAD2 expression was not inducible by ABA or stress. Subcellular localization of GFP-tagged SAD2 showed a predominantly nuclear localization, consistent with a role for SAD2 in nuclear transport. Knockout of the closest importin β homolog of SAD2 in Arabidopsis did not duplicate the sad2 phenotype, indicating that SAD2 plays a specific role in ABA signaling. Analysis of RD29A:LUC luminescence and ABA and stress sensitivity in double mutants of sad2-1 and sad1 or abh1-7, a newly isolated allele of ABH1 also in the RD29A:LUC background, suggested that SAD2 acts upstream of or has additive effects with these two genes. The results suggest a role for nuclear transport in ABA signal transduction, and the possible roles of SAD2 in relation to that of SAD1 and ABH1 are discussed.
!~RES~! sad2-1 (super sensitive to ABA and drought2) was isolated from a T-DNA mutagenized population of RD29A:LUCIFERASE (RD29A:LUC) plants in the C24 background. The T-DNA construct and mutagenesis procedures are described by CITATION. Approximately 30 000 T-DNA lines, in pools of 500, were screened for altered luminescence following stress or ABA treatment using procedures similar to those described previously for a chemically mutagenized population of RD29A:LUC (CITATION). A group of mutants that had increased stress- or ABA-responsive RD29A:LUC expression and ABA hypersensitivity in seed germination were isolated. One of these mutants, designated as sad2-1, is the focus of this study. sad2-1 had significantly increased expression of RD29A:LUC after cold, polyethylene glycol (PEG) or NaCl treatment but not on normal media (Figure 1a,b). RD29A:LUC expression was also higher in sad2-1 compared with wild type after treatment with exogenous ABA (Figure 1b,c). [[FIGURE]] Mutants with decreased stress- and ABA-responsive RD29A:LUC expression were also isolated, and one of these mutants was found to be allelic (see below) to the ABA-hypersensitive mutant abh1. This mutant was designated as abh1-7 (abh1-2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 have been described by CITATION). Increased accumulation of LUC mRNA in sad2-1 after treatment with salt, ABA, cold or PEG was observed by RNA blot analysis (Figure 2a). This confirms that sad2-1 affects mRNA expression from the RD29A promoter rather than the stability of the LUC protein. A RNA blot analysis also showed that mRNA levels of the endogenous RD29A gene were higher in sad2-1 than in wild type after treatment with salt, osmotic stress or ABA (Figure 2a). This demonstrates that sad2-1 affects expression of the endogenous RD29A gene in addition to the RD29A:LUC construct. [[FIGURE]] We also examined the expression of several other stress- and ABA-responsive genes using quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2b). The ABA-responsive gene RAB18 had increased expression in sad2-1 after treatment with PEG, NaCl or ABA. This demonstrated that the effects of sad2-1 were not limited to altered RD29A expression. Increased expression of another gene induced by ABA and stress, COR15A, was observed only after ABA treatment. In contrast, expression of NCED3 was not altered in sad2-1. NCED3 is a key enzyme in ABA synthesis (CITATION) and is likely to be regulated in large part by signals upstream of ABA accumulation. This suggests that sad2-1 affects responses downstream of ABA accumulation. We also used ABA radioimmunoassay (CITATION) to quantify seedling ABA content and found no significant difference in ABA content between wild-type and sad2-1 seedlings under control conditions or after PEG treatment (data not shown). Thus, we focused further characterization of sad2-1 on its increased sensitivity to ABA. sad2-1 was dramatically affected in the sensitivity of seed germination to exogenous ABA (Figure 3a). Low concentrations of ABA (0.1–0.5 μm) that had little or no effect on germination of the C24 wild type reduced sad2-1 germination by approximately 50%. Increased ABA sensitivity was also seen at 1 and 1.5 μm ABA (Figure 3a). sad2-1 was also hypersensitive to ABA in post-germination seedling growth. Ten-day-old wild-type seedlings showed little growth inhibition on media containing 0.4 μm exogenous ABA. In contrast, sad2-1 seedlings had little shoot or root development on ABA-containing media (Figure 3b). We also observed that sad2-1 plants flowered 4–5 days earlier than wild type (Figure 3c). This was the only morphological difference that we observed between sad2-1 and wild type: rosette stage plants and mature plants (6 weeks after planting) were indistinguishable from wild type. [[FIGURE]] Another relevant question is whether sad2-1 is also affected in its response to other hormones. We measured root elongation of wild type and sad2-1 seedlings after transfer to media containing aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC; 1, 2 or 4 μm), giberellic acid (GA; 100 μm), the cytokinin benzyl-adenine (BA; 0.1 μm), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; 0.01 μm), epibrassinosteroid (EBR; 1.5 μm) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; 0.01 μm). In all cases, the relative effect of the hormone treatment on root elongation was the same in wild type and sad2-1 (data not shown). sad2-1 was also not altered in its response to high levels of sugar (glucose, 1–6%). Together these data suggest that sad2-1 is specific in its effect on the ABA response. A 1 kb genomic DNA fragment flanking the T-DNA left border in sad2-1 was obtained by plasmid rescue (CITATION) and sequence analysis showed that the T-DNA was inserted in the seventh intron of At2g31660. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (Figure 3d) and RNA blot (data not shown) analysis confirmed that the At2g31660 transcript is absent in sad2-1. To further confirm that the T-DNA insertion in At2g31660 is the cause of the sad2-1 phenotype, we isolated a 9309-bp genomic DNA fragment containing At2g31660 by restriction digest of BAC clone T9H9. The fragment included 1033 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and 1436 bp downstream of the stop codon. The fragment was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1380 and used to transform sad2-1 plants. Hygromycin-resistant seedlings had wild-type sensitivity of seedling growth to ABA and RD29A:LUC (Figure 3e). In agreement with this, RD29A:LUC expression of the hygromycin-resistant seedlings was decreased compared with untransformed sad2-1 after treatment with ABA, PEG, NaCl or cold (Figure S1). We also isolated homozygous plants of a SALK T-DNA insertion in SAD2 (SALK_133577) and found that these plants were also hypersensitive to ABA (Figure S2). Together these data demonstrated that At2g31660 is SAD2. SAD2 is annotated as an importin β-2 subunit protein similar to importin 7 in vertebrates and RanBP7 (Ran binding protein 7) in Drosophila melanogaster (CITATION). CITATION and CITATION have conducted extensive phylogenetic analysis of the 17 importin β proteins in Arabidopsis and showed that SAD2 is highly related (65% identical; Figure S3) to another importin β-domain protein encoded by At3g59020. Expression of this gene was unaffected in sad2-1 (Figure 3d). RNA blot analysis was performed to determine the tissue distribution and stress inducibility of SAD2. Low levels of SAD2 transcripts were detected in roots, leaves, stem and siliques but not in flowers (Figure 4a). No induction of SAD2 expression by salt, cold, ABA or dehydration treatment was observed (Figure 4b). The tissue distribution of SAD2 expression was further examined by isolating a DNA fragment from the translational start codon to −1282 of SAD2, fusing it to the GUS reporter gene and generating transgenic plants. In agreement with the RNA blot results, GUS expression was detected in the entire seedling, root, leaf, stem and silique from 10 independent transgenic plants (Figure 4c and data not shown). In leaves, GUS staining was found in both epidermal cells and guard cells (Figure 4d). [[FIGURE]] We investigated the nuclear localization of SAD2 by transiently expressing an N-terminal fusion of GFP to SAD2 in leaf epidermal cells. SAD2-GFP was observed mostly in and around the nucleus with substantial amounts of SAD2-GFP also in the cytoplasm (Figure 4e). This is consistent with the expected function of SAD2 in nuclear transport (CITATION; CITATION) although the exact function of SAD2 is not known. At3g59020 encodes an importin β protein that shares the highest sequence homology to SAD2 out of the 17 importin β-domain proteins in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION; Figure S3). Because of this extensive homology, and because of the possibility that increased ABA sensitivity may be a general effect of altered nuclear transport, we investigated whether knockout of At3g59020 can also alter ABA sensitivity. Homozygous plants of a line containing a T-DNA insertion in the fourth exon of At3g59020 (SALK_103333) were isolated by PCR screening. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed that At3g59020 is expressed at a low level in Col wild type and this expression was eliminated in the at3g59020 T-DNA line (Figure 5a). Seed germination of at3g59020 was less sensitive to ABA than that of wild type (Figure 5b). Note that the Col ecotype used in these experiments is itself less sensitive to ABA inhibition of seed germination than the C24 background of our sad2-1 mutant (Figure 3). at3g59020 did not substantially differ from wild type, however, in the effect of ABA (Figure 5c), PEG or NaCl stress (data not shown) on seedling growth. Thus, the at3g59020 mutation does not duplicate the sad2-1 phenotype. This suggests that sad2-1 has a relatively strong and specific effect and raises the possibility that SAD2 could have a role in transport of ABA signaling intermediates. [[FIGURE]] From the same population of T-DNA-mutagenized RD29A:LUC we also isolated a T-DNA insertion in ABH1 by thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR. This allele was designated abh1-7 and has an insertion in the ninth intron of ABH1. abh1-7 exhibited enhanced ABA sensitivity (data not shown) similar to previous reports (Hugouvieux et al., 2001, 2002; CITATION) but reduced RD29A:LUC expression (see below). With the isolation of sad2-1 and abh1-7, we now had a collection of three mutants in the RD29A:LUC background involved in transport or RNA metabolism functions that affect ABA signaling. To better understand the interaction of these loci, we performed double mutant analysis of sad1 and sad2-1 and of sad2-1 and abh1-7. sad1/sad2-1 had higher RD29A:LUC expression than either sad1 or sad2-1 alone after treatment with ABA, cold or NaCl (Figure 6a). The data suggested an additive interaction between sad1 and sad2-1 on expression of RD29A. This is consistent with SAD1 and SAD2 acting in separate branches of stress and ABA signaling that converge at the regulation of RD29A, or with SAD1 and SAD2 acting on the same signaling branch but having an additive effect on the signaling output. Growth of the sad1/sad2-1 mutant under unstressed conditions was similar to that of sad1 for either soil-grown plants (Figure 6a) or seedlings (Figures 6c, 7). In the sensitivity of seedling growth to ABA, sad1/sad2-1 seedlings were more sensitive than sad2-1 alone and of similar sensitivity or slightly more sensitive than sad1 alone (Figure 6c). Seeds of the double mutant did not germinate and grow even after 20 days on 0.4 μm ABA (Figure 6c) whereas sad1 did germinate and exhibited a low level of seedling growth. Likewise, when sad1/sad2-1 seedlings were subjected to low water potential (using PEG-infused agar plates) or NaCl stress, the double mutant was more sensitive than sad2-1 and of similar sensitivity or slightly more sensitive than sad1 (Figure 7). The results suggest an epistatic effect of sad1 over sad2-1 on growth and ABA response or an additive effect, with sad1 having the larger effect. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] abh1-7 had reduced RD29A:LUC expression compared to wild type after treatment with ABA, cold or NaCl (Figure 6b). Although the underlying mechanisms are not known, ABH1 may have a different role in the regulation of RD29A expression than it does in seed germination and stomatal closure, where inactivation of ABH1 causes ABA hypersensitivity (CITATION). sad2-1/abh1-2 also had reduced RD29A:LUC expression compared with wild type (Figure 6b). The decreased expression of RD29A:LUC in the double mutant is consistent with abh1-7 acting downstream of sad2-1. Also, soil-grown plants of sad2-1/abh1-7 were indistinguishable from abh1-7 (Figure 6b). Like sad2-1, seedling growth of abh1-7 was similar to wild type under unstressed conditions and only slightly more affected by low water potential or NaCl (Figure. 6c and 7). Seedling growth of sad2-1/abh1-7 was more sensitive to ABA than that of the single mutant (Figure 6c), and the double mutant was also much more sensitive to low water potential or NaCl than either sad2-1 or abh1-7 (Figure 7). This last observation in particular suggests that the processes affected by SAD2 and ABH1 do not completely overlap, or that SAD2 and ABH1 both have a limited effect on the same signaling processes and these effects are additive in the double mutant.
!~MM~! The T-DNA mutagenized population in the RD29A:LUC background (ecotype C24) has been previously described (CITATION). This population was screened for altered RD29A-LUC expression in response to low temperature, exogenous ABA or salt treatment as described previously (CITATION). Unmutagenized C24 RD29A:LUC is referred to as ‘wild type’ throughout this study. The T-DNA line SALK_103333 (CITATION) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion obtained by PCR screening (primers listed in Table S1). Soil-grown plants were grown in Metro-Mix 350 (Scott-Sierra Horticultural Products, Marysville, OH, USA) in growth chambers with 16-h light at 22°C, 8-h dark at 18°C and 70% relative humidity. sad2-1 and abh1-7 mutant plants were backcrossed to wild type and F1 and F2 seedlings tested for ABA sensitivity, luminescence and bialaphos resistance. To obtain double mutants, sad1, sad2-1 and abh1-7 were crossed and the resulting F2 progeny were used to identify homozygous double mutant lines. Mutant and wild-type seeds were surface sterilized, plated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 3% sucrose and 1.2% agar and stratified at 4°C for 3 days before transfer to 22°C under continuous light for germination and growth. For tests of the ABA sensitivity of germination and seedling growth, seeds were plated directly (before stratification) onto media containing the ABA concentrations indicated in the text or figures. For determination of the sensitivity of root elongation to hormone treatment seeds were germinated on hormone-free media, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to hormone-containing media and root elongation was quantified 6 days later. Hormone treatments tested were: epibrassinosteroid (1.5 μm), gibberelic acid (100 μm), indol-3-acetic acid (0.01 μm), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (0.01 μm), 6-benzyladenine (0.1 μm) or aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (1–4 μm). No difference in root elongation between mutant and wild type was observed for any of these treatments. For determination of low water potential or salt sensitivity, seedlings were plated directly (before stratification) onto salt-containing media (100 mm NaCl) or PEG-infused agar plates (−0.7 MPa) and seedling growth observed 7 or 9 days after the end of the stratification period. Polyethylene glycol-infused plates were prepared as described by CITATION with the modification that 0.5% or 3% sucrose was added to the media to be consistent with the other characterization of sad2-1. For RNA blot analysis, total RNA was extracted from wild-type roots, leaves, stems, siliques and flowers of Arabidopsis or 7-day-old wild-type and sad2-1 seedlings treated with low temperature, ABA, NaCl, dehydration or PEG (concentrations used or duration of dehydration are described in the text or figure legends). Thirty micrograms of RNA per lane was used for RNA blot analysis. Blotting procedures and the LUC, RD29A and ACTIN probes were as previously described (CITATION). For SAD2 RNA blots, the full-length cDNA was used as the probe. For RT-PCR and real-time PCR analysis, total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized with 1 or 3 μg of total RNA (3 μg of RNA was used for RT-PCR of SAD2 and At3g59020 because of the low expression of these genes). Real-time PCR quantification of RAB18, COR15 and NCED3 expression was performed essentially as described by CITATION using a Sequence Detection System 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Quantification of copy number for each gene was done by amplifying a 400–600 bp portion of each gene containing the binding sites for the real-time PCR primers and Taq-man probe. The amplified DNA fragment was purified, quantified spectrophotometrically and diluted appropriately to generate a standard curve for calculation of the copy number of each transcript. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR and real-time PCR analysis are given in Table S1. Deoxyribonucleic acid flanking the left border of the inserted T-DNA in sad2-1 plants was isolated by plasmid rescue (CITATION) using BamHI-digested genomic DNA. For sad2-1 complementation, a 9302 bp DNA fragment of the SAD2 gene including 1033 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and 1436 bp downstream of the translation stop codon was digested from BAC clone T9H9 using EcoRI and SpeI. The SAD2 gene fragment was cloned into the pCAMBIA 1380 vector and transformed into sad2-1 plants using the floral dip method. Deoxyribonucleic acid flanking the T-DNA left border in abh1-7 plants was isolated by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR as previously described (CITATION). A SAD2:GUS construct was generated by PCR amplifying a 1282 bp fragment of the SAD2 promoter (primers sequences are given in Table S1) and cloning into the pCAMBIA 1391Z vector between the EcoRI and BamHI sites. After transformation, 10 independent transgenic lines (T2) were tested for GUS activity. Tissue was stained by incubating in GUS staining buffer overnight at 37°C followed by clearing with 70% ethanol. An N-terminal fusion of GFP to SAD2 was generated and used for transient expression following the procedures of CITATION with the modification that leaf epidermal cells were used for expression. GFP images were collected on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope.
