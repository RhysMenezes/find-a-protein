!~ABS~! Leaf senescence is a key physiological process in all plants. Its onset is tightly controlled by transcription factors, of which NAC factor ORE1 (ANAC092) is crucial in Arabidopsis thaliana. Enhanced expression of ORE1 triggers early senescence by controlling a downstream gene network that includes various senescence‐associated genes. Here, we report that unexpectedly ORE1 interacts with the G2‐like transcription factors GLK1 and GLK2, which are important for chloroplast development and maintenance, and thereby for leaf maintenance. ORE1 antagonizes GLK transcriptional activity, shifting the balance from chloroplast maintenance towards deterioration. Our finding identifies a new mechanism important for the control of senescence by ORE1.
!~RES~! To identify proteins interacting with ORE1, we performed a yeast two‐hybrid screen using bait construct pLexPD–ORE1 and a prey complementary DNA library derived from Arabidopsis seedlings [CITATION]. To increase screening specificity, we only included the region downstream of the highly conserved DNA‐binding domain of ORE1. We identified GLK2 as an ORE1‐interacting protein (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] GLK1 and GLK2 share ∼50% amino‐acid sequence identity. The similarity is higher, 90% and 79%, respectively, when the two conserved regions, GARP and GCT domains, are compared [CITATION]. This high sequence similarity prompted us to test whether GLK1 would similarly interact with ORE1, which was indeed the case when a GLK1–GAL4 activation domain fusion was employed as prey (FIG-REF). The NAC TF ORS1 (ORE1 SISTER1; ANAC059; At3g29035) is a paralog of ORE1 [CITATION, CITATION]. Within their NAM domains, both TFs share an overall amino‐acid identity of 94%. We tested by two‐hybrid assay for interactions of ORS1 with GLK1 or GLK2, using pLexPD‐ORS1 as bait, and GLK1–GAL4 or GLK2–GAL4 as prey clones. Neither GLK1 nor GLK2 interacted with ORS1 (supplementary Fig S1 online), indicating specificity of the interaction of ORE1 with the two GLKs. Furthermore, an in vitro pull‐down assay revealed that immobilized GST–ORE1 fusion protein precipitated histidine‐tagged GLK2 (HIS‐GLK2) protein (FIG-REF; supplementary Fig S2 online) confirming the interaction of ORE1 and GLK2. We next used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to test for interaction of ORE1 and GLK2 in plant cells. Yellow fluorescence was exclusively detected in nuclei of mesophyll cell protoplasts co‐expressing ORE1::nYFP and GLK2::cYFP (FIG-REF). To test the effect of ORE1 on the subcellular localization of GLK2, we introduced 35S:GLK2::GFP plasmid into mesophyll cell protoplasts prepared from VGE:ORE1::HA plants, which express haemagglutinin (HA)‐tagged ORE1 protein from a methoxyfenozide (MOF)‐inducible promoter (see supplementary Fig S3 online for induction of ORE1 protein after MOF induction). Confocal imaging revealed green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in the nucleus of both MOF‐ and mock‐treated cells (FIG-REF). This result clearly indicates that GLK2 is a nuclear‐localized TF and that ORE1 interacts with GLK2 in the nucleus. [[FIGURE]] We further confirmed ORE1–GLK2 interaction by co‐immunoprecipitation assay. To this end, VGE:ORE1::HA mesophyll cell protoplasts transformed either with 35S:GLK2::GFP or 35S:GFP constructs were induced with MOF for 24 h. As shown in FIG-REF, immunoblot analysis detected an interaction between ORE1‐HA and GLK2‐GFP proteins. Thus, our data provide strong evidence for an interaction of ORE1 and GLK2 in Arabidopsis cells. ORE1 is a key regulator of leaf senescence; its overexpression accelerates senescence while loss‐of‐function ore1 mutants show delayed senescence and flowering [CITATION, CITATION]. In contrast, GLK1 and GLK2 regulate chloroplast development. Under long‐day condition, glk1 and glk2 mutants produced fewer vegetative leaves than wild type but flowered within a similar time frame [CITATION]. However, whether GLKs affect the timing or progression of leaf senescence has not been investigated previously. To elucidate the potential biological relevance of the ORE1–GLK interaction for senescence, we first analysed GLK transgenic lines and observed a delay of senescence, compared with wild type, in 35S:GLK1 and 35S:GLK2 overexpressors (FIG-REF), while glk1 and glk2 single mutants did not show a striking alteration in their senescence behaviour (supplementary Fig S4 online). The pale‐green phenotype of the glk1/2 double mutant did not seem to alter age‐dependent senescence. Delayed leaf yellowing observed in GLK overexpression plants was further confirmed by measuring senescence‐related physiological and molecular parameters. Total chlorophyll content was significantly higher in GLK1 and GLK2 overexpressors than in wild‐type and glk1/2 double‐mutant plants 8 weeks after sowing (FIG-REF). In accordance with this, ion leakage was less prominent in GLK overexpressors than wild‐type and mutant plants (FIG-REF). Expression of early‐ and late‐senescence marker genes, SAG13 and SAG12, was downregulated, whereas expression of photosynthesis‐related genes (CAB2, LHCB2.1, CAB4 and LHCB4.1) was enhanced in GLK overexpression plants compared with wild type, in accordance with their known molecular functions and the delayed senescence phenotype (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] We next generated ORE1/GLK2 double overexpressors by crossing 35S:ORE1 and 35S:GLK2 lines (supplementary Fig S4D online). Under long‐day condition, 35S:ORE1/35S:GLK2 plants bolted considerably earlier (5 days) and showed earlier senescence than wild‐type controls (FIG-REF; supplementary Fig S4E online). Total chlorophyll was significantly lower, whereas ion leakage was higher in leaves of 35S:ORE1/35S:GLK2 lines compared with wild type (FIG-REF; supplementary Fig S4F,G online). Expression of SAG12 and SAG13 was higher in double overexpressors, while expression of photosynthesis‐related genes was significantly reduced (FIG-REF). Taken together, these data demonstrate accelerated bolting and leaf senescence in transgenic plants overexpressing both ORE1 and GLK2, resembling the typical phenotype of ORE1 overexpression plants [CITATION, CITATION]. This observation indicates that the interaction of ORE1 with GLKs antagonizes GLK function suggesting a negative impact of ORE1 on photosynthetic apparatus maintenance and chloroplast integrity. The fact that 35S:ORE1/35S:GLK2 double overexpressors highly resemble 35S:ORE1 plants with respect to bolting and senescence suggests a possible negative influence of ORE1/GLK2 heteromerisation on the expression of GLK target genes. GLK target genes were previously reported [CITATION]. We tested the expression of ORE1 and GLK target genes by quantitative reverse‐transcriptase PCR in 35S:GLK1, 35S:GLK2, glk1/2, 35S:ORE1/35S:GLK2, 35S:ORE1, ore1‐1 and wild‐type plants. Expression of the ORE1 targets RNS3, SINA1, BFN1, SAG29 and VNI2 was higher in 35S:ORE1/35S:GLK2 than wild‐type plants, similar to 35S:ORE1 plants. These genes did not show any significant difference in the expression in glk1/2, 35S:GLK1 and 35S:GLK2 plants compared with wild‐type plants, except VNI2 that showed a slight downregulation in both overexpression lines (FIG-REF). The lack of repression of ORE1 target genes in the GLK overexpressors is fully consistent with the fact that ORE1 expression itself is not largely affected at the developmental stage analysed (FIG-REF, middle). [[FIGURE]] On the other hand, expression of all six tested GLK1 and GLK2 target genes was highly upregulated in 35S:GLK1 and 35S:GLK2 plants, and strongly downregulated in the glk1/2 double mutant compared with wild type, except for MRU1 that showed no change in expression in 35S:GLK2 and glk1/2 plants. Notably, none of the GLK targets was induced in the 35S:ORE1/35S:GLK2 double overexpressor even in the presence of high transcript abundance of GLK2. This expression pattern was similar to the expression in 35S:ORE1 plants, which showed either no change in expression for some of the genes, such as LHCB4.2, MRU1 and LHCB3, or downregulation of others, such as Hydrolase, LHCB2.2 and LHCB2.4. Interestingly, expression of these genes was upregulated in the ore1‐1 mutant, except for MRU1, LHCB3 and Hydrolase, which showed unaltered expression (FIG-REF). Collectively, our data demonstrate that ORE1 attenuates the transcriptional activity of GLK2. To further analyse the effect of ORE1/GLK2 heteromers on the expression of downstream target genes, we performed luciferase‐based transactivation assays using Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts. To this end, we fused the promoters of ORE1 target genes to the firefly luciferase reporter. ORE1 significantly transactivated all target gene promoters in protoplasts co‐transfected with a 35S:ORE1 effector plasmid and the reporter constructs (proORE1‐fLUC, proRNS3‐fLUC, proSINA1‐fLUC, proBFN1‐fLUC, proSAG29‐fLUC and proVNI2‐fLUC) (FIG-REF). ORE1‐mediated transcriptional activation was not altered when 35S:ORE1 was co‐transfected with 35S:GLK2 effector plasmid (FIG-REF). Thus, the results obtained from luciferase‐based transactivation assays further support the conclusion that ORE1/GLK2 heteromerisation does not affect the expressional regulation of ORE1 target genes. Next, we performed transactivation assays with reporter constructs harbouring GLK target gene promoters. As shown in FIG-REF, GLK2 significantly transactivated all its target promoters (proLHCB3‐fLUC, proLHCB2.2‐fLUC, proLHCB4.2‐fLUC, proLHCB2.4‐fLUC, proMRU1‐fLUC and proHydrolase‐fLUC). This transcriptional activation by GLK2 significantly decreased for all photosynthetic target genes when the 35S:ORE1 effector plasmid was transfected in addition to 35S:GLK2, while the expression of non‐photosynthetic GLK targets, that is, MRU1 and Hydrolase, was not affected by ORE1 (FIG-REF). This observation clearly indicates that ORE1 has an inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of GLK2. On the basis of the experimental data obtained herein, we propose a model that can explain how ORE1 and GLKs coordinate the age‐dependent alteration of the two antagonistic activities: chloroplast maintenance and initiation/progression of leaf senescence (FIG-REF). During early leaf development, ORE1 transcript level is low owing to transcriptional regulation [CITATION, CITATION] and post‐transcriptional control by miR164 [CITATION], whereas GLK1 and GLK2 expression is high, which transcriptionally activates genes of photosynthetic proteins involved in chloroplast development and maintenance [CITATION, CITATION]. At later stages of leaf development, accumulation of ORE1 and its interaction with GLKs render inactive heterodimers unable to activate photosynthetic GLK target genes, while activation of ORE1 targets is favoured. Thus, the senescence‐triggering role of ORE1 is dominant over the photosynthetic apparatus maintenance role of GLKs. Thus, A. thaliana, and possibly other plants, seem to use an intriguing and multilevel control mechanism to balance chloroplast maintenance against dismantling. [[FIGURE]]
