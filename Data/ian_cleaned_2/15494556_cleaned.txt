!~ABS~! Autophagy is an intracellular process for vacuolar degradation of cytoplasmic components. Thus far, plant autophagy has been studied primarily using morphological analyses. A recent genome-wide search revealed significant conservation among autophagy genes (ATGs) in yeast and plants. It has not been proved, however, that Arabidopsis thaliana ATG genes are required for plant autophagy. To evaluate this requirement, we examined the ubiquitination-like Atg8 lipidation system, whose component genes are all found in the Arabidopsis genome. In Arabidopsis, all nine ATG8 genes and two ATG4 genes were expressed ubiquitously and were induced further by nitrogen starvation. To establish a system monitoring autophagy in whole plants, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis expressing each green fluorescent protein–ATG8 fusion (GFP-ATG8). In wild-type plants, GFP-ATG8s were observed as ring shapes in the cytoplasm and were delivered to vacuolar lumens under nitrogen-starved conditions. By contrast, in a T-DNA insertion double mutant of the ATG4s (atg4a4b-1), autophagosomes were not observed, and the GFP-ATG8s were not delivered to the vacuole under nitrogen-starved conditions. In addition, we detected autophagic bodies in the vacuoles of wild-type roots but not in those of atg4a4b-1 in the presence of concanamycin A, a V-ATPase inhibitor. Biochemical analyses also provided evidence that autophagy in higher plants requires ATG proteins. The phenotypic analysis of atg4a4b-1 indicated that plant autophagy contributes to the development of a root system under conditions of nutrient limitation.
!~RES~! In our previous report, we searched for homologs of yeast ATG genes in the Arabidopsis genome and identified nine candidate ATG8s (CITATION). All the ATG8 proteins display a high degree of identity (∼70%) with the yeast Atg8 protein, and the Gly residues at their C-terminal regions are conserved. Interestingly, two of the nine homologs, ATG8h and ATG8i, had no C-terminal extension after the Gly residue. To examine where the ATG8s function, we performed expression analysis of ATG8a through ATG8i by RT-PCR. Because the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions of ATG8s are highly conserved, gene-specific primers corresponding to each ATG8 from the 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions were designed based on sequences found in the Arabidopsis EST database (see Methods). Total cellular RNAs were isolated from roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and siliques of wild-type Arabidopsis grown in hydroponic culture for 4 to 5 weeks and subjected to RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 1A, all ATG8s were ubiquitously expressed in every organ tested. Next, in intact plants, the expression of ATG8a-i mRNA under nitrogen starvation was examined by quantitative RT-PCR because the abundance of both the ATG8 and ATG7 mRNAs increased when leaves were artificially senescent under nutrient-depleted conditions in the dark (CITATION). For nitrogen starvation, 5-week-old wild-type Arabidopsis plants grown in nutrient medium (7 mM nitrate) were transferred to nitrogen-depleted medium (0 mM nitrate). After 1, 3, 6, and 12 h of nitrogen starvation, total cellular RNA isolated from leaves were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The expression of all ATG8s was moderately induced by nitrogen starvation, however, each ATG8 showed a different pattern of induction (Figure 1B). [[FIGURE]] Next, in addition to ATG8s, we also focused on Atg4 homologs, which may function in the C-terminal cleavage of ATG8s required for their modification and in the deconjugation of their modified forms. Two homologs of the ATG4 gene, ATG4a and 4b, were identified in the Arabidopsis genome (CITATION). ATG4 proteins had a significant but low level of identity with the yeast Atg4 protein (ATG4a-yeast Atg4, 26%; ATG4b-yeast Atg4, 29%). However, the two ATG4s displayed 71% overall amino acid identity. The Cys, Asp, and His residues, which comprise the catalytic site, were well conserved in ATG4s. In addition, both ATG4s complemented the autophagic defect caused by the yeast atg4 mutation (CITATION). These results suggest that ATG4a and 4b are yeast Atg4 orthologs. We also performed expression analysis of ATG4a and 4b by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers (see Methods). As shown in Figure 1C, the two ATG4s were ubiquitously expressed like ATG8s. The induction of ATG4 transcription under nitrogen starvation was examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. With 1 h of starvation, both ATG4s were immediately and drastically induced (Figure 1D). First of all, to detect ATG8 proteins, antibodies against ATG8a and 8i (hereafter anti-ATG8a and anti-ATG8i) were made. Because of their high conservation of the primary sequences, the cross-reactivity of these antibodies was tested in lysates of yeast cells expressing each ATG8. The anti-ATG8a antibodies recognized all ATG8 proteins, with varying degrees of reactivity, whereas the anti-ATG8i antibodies recognized mostly ATG8i but faintly ATG8h (Figure 2A). [[FIGURE]] To investigate whether ATG8s are also processed at the C terminus by ATG4s, each ATG8 was tagged with three consecutive myc epitopes at the C terminus and was expressed in the yeast atg4atg8 mutant. Total cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with an anti-myc antibody. In every cell, a single band of ∼18 kD was detected, corresponding to the molecular sizes of the ATG8-3Xmyc fusion protein (Figures 2B, lane 1, and 2C, top panel). Next, ATG4a or 4b was coexpressed in these cells followed by an immunoblot analysis with anti-ATG8a and 8i antibodies (Figures 2B, lane 5, and 2C, bottom panel; data not shown). A single band of ∼13 kD appeared, which was not detectable with the anti-myc antibody (Figure 2B, lane 2; data not shown). These data indicate that the C-terminal extensions of ATG8a-g had been cleaved by the ATG4s. ATG8h and 8i are novel types of ATG8, which did not possess additional amino acids after Gly, and it is not supposed to be subjected to the cleavage by ATG4 as in the other ATG8s. However, it is noteworthy that ectopically fused C termini (3Xmyc) of ATG8h and 8i were also susceptible to the cleavage in the ATG4s dependent manner. Next, we investigated the intracellular distribution of ATG8s by subcellular fractionation. Leaves of 4-week-old wild-type Arabidopsis were homogenized, and the post-nuclear supernatant was fractionated by successive centrifugation to generate a 13,000g pellet fraction (low-speed pellet [LSP]), a 100,000g pellet fraction (high-speed pellet [HSP]), and a 100,000g supernatant fraction (high-speed supernatant [HSS]). Bands of ∼13 kD were detected by the anti-ATG8a antibodies, corresponding to the predicted size of ATG8s. The ATG8s were predominantly detected in the pellet fraction, mostly in the LSP. Small amounts were recovered from the HSP and HSS (Figure 3A). Next, we tried to solubilize the ATG8s from the pellet fractions by resuspension in a buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 2 M urea, 0.1 M Na2CO3, 2% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxycholate (DOC). Samples were centrifuged again, and the supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-ATG8a antibodies. ATG8s in the LSP fraction could not be extracted by salt, urea, or alkali but were almost completely solubilized by Triton X-100 or DOC (Figure 3B, top panel). These results indicate that ATG8s in the LSP fraction are tightly associated with the membrane. On the other hand, ATG8s in the HSP fraction were partially solubilized by salt, urea, or alkali and almost completely by detergent (Figure 3B, bottom panel), suggesting that some of the protein in the HSP fraction was peripherally membrane associated. [[FIGURE]] Previous reports have shown that the modified form of yeast Atg8, which is conjugated with PE, migrates faster than the unmodified form of yeast Atg8 on a 6 M urea SDS gel (CITATION). Taking advantage of this gel system, we attempted to detect the modified forms of ATG8s. On a urea SDS gel, most of the ATG8s in the LSP fraction migrated faster, but not those from the HSS fraction (Figure 3C). In addition, recently it was reported that LC3 also conjugated with PE in animal cells (CITATION). Thus, we postulated these faster-migrating forms to be putative PE-conjugated forms (hereafter ATG8*). Most of the ATG8s in the LSP fraction were the ATG8* but those in the HSS fractions were the unmodified form. These experiments suggest that most ATG8s exist as the ATG8* and are associated with membranes. These results are in principle consistent with the biochemical properties of yeast Atg8 (CITATION). We examined the expression of ATG8 proteins in different organs and different growth stages by immunoblot analysis using anti-ATG8a antibodies (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4A (top panel), ATG8s were ubiquitously detected in all organs examined, and the protein levels were higher in root, flower, and silique. In addition to unmodified forms (Figure 4A, middle panel, asterisks), two faster-migrating forms, the ATG8*, were detected (Figure 4A, middle panel, arrowheads). The banding patterns differed slightly among all organs (Figure 4A, middle panel), suggesting that different ATG8 may be functionally assigned to each organ. Furthermore, ATG8s were detected throughout all growth stages; the level of protein expression increased until the plant reached 4 weeks, followed by a gradual decrease (Figure 4B, top panel). We also investigated the ATG8* in leaves of different growth stages. Interestingly, the level of the ATG8* also increased as growth progressed, peaking in 4-week-old plants, which is the stage just before bolting (Figure 4B, middle panel). [[FIGURE]] Next, the subcellular localization of green fluorescent protein–ATG8s (GFP-ATG8s) was examined by polyethylene glycol–mediated transient expression assays using Arabidopsis cultured cells. We made nine constructs in which each ATG8 open reading frame (ORF) was fused to the C terminus of GFP and placed under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus. GFP alone was expressed as a negative control. GFP-ATG8s exhibited rings and punctate structures, which are thought to be autophagosomes and their precursors, in addition to the evenly stained cytosol (Figures 5A, 5D, and 5G; data not shown). Interestingly, in some cases, GFP-ATG8h and GFP-ATG8i localized also to the inside of the vacuole (Figure 5J; data not shown). Because ATG8h and ATG8i do not require processing of the C-terminal extension by ATG4s, they may be delivered to vacuole more quickly than other GFP-ATG8s. In the case of ATG8a-g, the level of ATG4 expression may be limiting because only GFP-ATG8s were transiently overexpressed after strong promoter. We also constructed GFP-ATG8a-A, e-A, and i-A, in which each C-terminal Gly was substituted by an Ala residue. The resultant fusion proteins were found in dot structures smaller than the rings that were observed upon expression of the wild-type GFP-ATG8s (Figures 5L, 5O, and 5R; data not shown). These experiments indicate that the substitution of the C-terminal Gly results in defective localization to preautophagosomal structures. [[FIGURE]] The behavior of GFP-ATG8s was also investigated under nutrient starvation conditions. As shown in Figures 5B, 5E and 5H, vacuoles swelled after 48 h of incubation in nitrogen-free medium, and GFP-ATG8a, e, and i were delivered to the vacuole. GFP-ATG8a-A, e-A, and i-A, however, were not delivered to the vacuole (Figures 5M, 5P, and 5S). The most probable explanation is that the ATG8-As could not be cleaved by the ATG4s or modified at their C termini because of the substitution of the C-terminal Gly to an Ala residue; consequently, the GFP-ATG8-As were not able to localize to the putative preautophagosomal structures, preventing the effective delivery of the GFP-ATG8-As to the vacuole. These results suggest that the C-terminal Gly of all ATG8s is essential for autophagy, namely, the ATG8 system functions in a similar manner in plant autophagy as in yeast. From these results, we have also shown that GFP-ATG8s are functional and good molecular markers for monitoring plant autophagy. To elucidate the role of ATG4s in whole plants, we generated the T-DNA insertion double mutant atg4a4b-1. The Arabidopsis ATG4 proteins are encoded by two genes located on the bottom arm of chromosomes 2 and 3. We screened a population of T-DNA insertional mutants obtained from the University of Wisconsin Arabidopsis Knockout Facility and Kazusa DNA Research Institute and isolated two T-DNA insertion single mutants, which we designated atg4a-1 and atg4b-1. atg4a-1 and atg4b-1 plants contain T-DNA insertions in the second exon, 32 bp downstream of the translational initiation codon, and in the fifth intron, 1280 bp downstream of the translational initiation codon, respectively (Figure 6A). The segregation pattern of antibiotic resistance revealed a single T-DNA insertion in atg4b-1, but not atg4a-1 plants. We performed a backcross and obtained an atg4a-1 mutant with only a single T-DNA insertion, in which the antibiotic resistance gene was deleted. RT-PCR analysis using gene-specific primers that span the T-DNA insertion confirmed the absence of full-length ATG4a and 4b mRNA in both of the respective mutants (Figure 6B). We conclude that these alleles represent null mutations. To obtain double mutant plants, plants homozygous for atg4a-1 and for atg4b-1 were crossed. Homozygous double mutant plants (atg4a4b) were identified by PCR in F2 progeny after F1 self-pollination. In the atg4a4b-1 mutant, neither of the full-length mRNAs encoding ATG4a and 4b were detected (Figure 6B), indicating that this mutant is devoid of functional ATG4 proteins. After three backcrosses to the wild type, homozygous atg4a4b-1 plants were used for further study. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the behavior of ATG8s in atg4a4b-1 mutant plants, total proteins prepared from leaves of wild-type, atg4a-1, atg4b-1, atg4a4b-1, and atg9-1 plants were subjected to urea SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-ATG8a antibodies (Figure 6C). As shown in Figure 6C (bottom panel), faster-migrating bands were detected in wild-type, atg4a-1, and atg4b-1 plants. Like in yeast, the faster-migrating ATG8 bands were detected also in atg9-1 plants. By contrast, the fastest-migrating band was completely absent in atg4a4b-1 plants (Figure 6C, closed arrowhead). These results support the conclusion that the fastest-migrating band, which is observed in wild-type plants, represents the ATG8*. The other faster-migrating band was faintly detected even in atg4a4b-1 (Figure 6C, opened arrowhead). The band was not consistent with the band detected with anti-ATG8i antibodies (data not shown). The level of ATG8s was drastically increased in atg4a4b-1 and atg9-1 plants (Figure 6C, top panel), but in two single mutants, atg4a-1 and atg4b-1, the ATG8 levels were similar to those in the wild type. Therefore, it is likely that, in atg4a4b-1, the band of unmodified form that was not detected in the wild type appeared in the same position as ATG8*. Why did the level of ATG8s increase in atg disruption mutants? One possibility is that each ATG8 transcript increases in disruption mutants to compensate for the defect in autophagy. It is more likely, however, that ATG8 proteins are not delivered to the vacuole because of the defect in autophagy, and consequently are not degraded. Next, we examined the intracellular distribution of ATG8s in atg mutants by subcellular fractionation. In atg4a-1, atg4b-1, and atg9-1 plants, ATG8s were mainly recovered in the LSP fraction, as they are in the wild-type plants (Figure 6D). By contrast, as expected, in atg4a4b-1 plants, ATG8s were recovered primarily in the HSS and only at low levels in the LSP and HSP fractions (Figure 6D), indicating that ATG8s could not be converted into ATG8* in atg4a4b-1. Wild-type and atg4a4b-1 plants expressing GFP-ATG8a, 8e, 8i, and GFP alone were generated to confirm whether the disruption of ATG4s affect intracellular localization of ATG8s in whole plants. As shown in Figure 7, in roots of wild-type plants grown under nutrient-rich conditions, every fusion protein was observed in many ring-shaped and punctate structures, which are interpreted to be autophagosomes and their intermediates (Figures 7A, 7C, and 7E). By contrast, these structures were not observed in roots of atg4a4b-1 plants, although some small dot structures were observed (Figures 7G, 7I, and 7K). The putative PE-conjugated form was detected only in the wild-type plants expressing GFP-ATG8a but not in the atg4a4b-1 plants expressing GFP-ATG8a (Figure 7O), supporting that GFP-ATG8 fusion proteins are functional. In the solubilization experiment, the GFP-ATG8a fusion protein was effectively solubilized by ionic detergent, DOC, but faintly solubilized by nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, suggesting that the small dot structures observed in atg4a4b-1 cells could be aggregated proteins (Figure 7P). These results indicate that ATG4s are required for formation of autophagosomes by permitting the association of ATG8s to membranes. [[FIGURE]] To monitor autophagy in a whole plant, we examined the behavior of GFP-ATG8s under nitrogen-starved conditions in wild-type plants. For nitrogen starvation, 7-d-old seedlings grown in nutrient-rich medium (MS medium [21 mM NH4NO3, 18 mM KNO3, and 88 mM sucrose]) were transferred to nitrogen-depleted medium (MS-N [0 mM nitrogen and 88 mM sucrose]). After 6 d of nitrogen starvation, the roots were observed by fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy. Under these conditions, every fusion protein was delivered to vacuolar lumens in wild-type roots (Figures 7B, 7D, and 7F). On the other hand, in atg4a4b-1, none of these fusion proteins, even GFP-ATG8i, which does not have the C-terminal extension after the Gly residue, were delivered to the vacuoles, suggesting that ATG4s are essential for plant autophagy via deconjugation of ATG8* (Figures 7H, 7J, and 7L). Concanamycin A, a V-ATPase inhibitor, is known to raise the pH in vacuolar lumens when exogenously added to plant cells (CITATION; CITATION). Consequently, it is expected that, under such high pH conditions, vacuolar hydrolases cannot act, leading to the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuole (Y. Moriyasu, personal communication). Roots of 1-week-old wild-type and atg4a4b-1 seedlings expressing GFP-ATG8s were treated with 1 μM concanamycin A for 6 h under nitrogen-starved conditions and then observed by microscopy. Nomarski images are shown in Figures 8, 9B, and 9D. In wild-type roots treated with concanamycin A, there were many spherical structures in well-developed vacuoles (Figures 8A to 8C). These structures were stained by GFP-ATG8s (Figure 9A), suggesting that they were plant autophagic bodies. By contrast, vacuoles in atg4a4b-1 were small and did not contain spherical structures (Figures 8D to 8F). Next, electron microscopy was performed. In wild-type roots, single-membrane-bound vesicles ∼1.5 μm in diameter were observed. These vesicles were electron dense and contained cytoplasmic structures, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi bodies (Figures 10A to 10D), demonstrating that they were indeed plant autophagic bodies. By contrast, there were no autophagic bodies in the vacuoles of atg4a4b-1 plants. Furthermore, the vacuoles of atg4a4b-1 mutants were smaller than those of wild-type plants in the cells around the root cap or meristem (Figures 10E and 10F; data not shown). In yeast, swollen vacuoles are typically observed as autophagy progresses under nitrogen-starved conditions (CITATION). Our results suggest that autophagy might contribute to the swelling of vacuoles relatively soon after exposure to nutrient-depleted conditions. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To verify that the defect in accumulation of autophagic bodies, that is, autophagy, in the atg4a4b-1 mutant was caused by the T-DNA insertion in each of the two ATG4 genes, we performed a functional complementation experiment. A genomic ATG4a fragment encompassing its 5′ flanking area and coding region (tATG4a) was transformed into the atg4a4b-1 mutant. Five independent transformants harboring the tATG4a transgene were selected by antibiotic resistance and confirmed by PCR for the presence of the tATG4a transgene and for the absence of the wild-type ATG4a and ATG4b alleles (data not shown). The expression of the tATG4a transgene rescued the defective accumulation of autophagic bodies (Figures 8G and 8H), indicating that the defect in autophagy was caused by the combination of the atg4a and atg4b mutations. The above results led us to conclude that atg4a4b-1 plants are defective in autophagy. This is the first direct evidence that ATG genes are essential for plant autophagy. Previous studies by our group and Vierstra's group demonstrated that disruption of ATG7 and ATG9— atg7-1 and atg9-1, respectively—accelerated the senescence of cotyledon and rosette leaves, and, moreover, that both of the mutant plants develop fewer flowers and siliques, resulting in fewer seeds (CITATION; CITATION). These phenotypes were also observed in the atg4a4b-1 mutant (data not shown). In addition, when 10-d-old seedlings grown in nutrient-rich medium were transferred to nitrogen-depleted medium, it appeared that lateral-root elongation was severely inhibited in atg4a4b-1 plants (data not shown). To confirm the inhibition of lateral-root elongation in atg4a4b-1 plants under nitrogen-starved conditions, seeds of wild-type and atg4a4b-1 plants were sowed on nitrogen-starvation medium (MS-N), and primary root length, number of lateral roots, and total length of lateral roots were scored in 21-d-old seedlings (Figure 11). The rate of primary root elongation of atg4a4b-1 mutants was lower than that of wild-type plants. The total number of lateral roots per primary root in atg4a4b-1 seedlings was also reduced compared with wild-type seedlings, and the total length of lateral roots per primary root was even more severely decreased, indicating that the length of the total root system was reduced in this autophagy-defective mutant (Figure 11B). These results indicate that autophagy contributes to root elongation under nutrient-depleted conditions. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija was used in this study. The plants were grown on rockwool using vermiculite as soil or hydroponically at 22°C with 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles. The hydroponic culture was performed as described by CITATION. For nitrogen starvation, 5-week-old plants hydroponically grown in nutrient medium were transferred to nitrogen-depleted medium that had been prepared by replacing KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 with KCl and CaCl2. For plate-grown plants, seeds were surface sterilized, chilled at 4°C for 4 d, and then sown and grown on MS medium. For nitrogen-depleted MS medium (MS-N), the medium was prepared by depleting the NH4NO3 and replacing the KNO3 with KCl. Genes homologous to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ATG were searched for in the Arabidopsis whole genome database using the Arabidopsis Information Resource BLAST 2.2.8 program (CITATION), and the amino acid sequence alignment was performed using the program Megalign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). To examine the tissue-specific expression of the ATG8a-i, ATG4a, and 4b genes, total cellular RNA was prepared, using the guanidium isothiocyanate/CsCl method, from roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and siliques of wild-type Arabidopsis that had been grown in hydroponic culture for 4 to 5 weeks (CITATION). cDNA was generated using the ProSTAR RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA derived from 0.2 μg of total RNA was used as template for each PCR reaction. Gene-specific primers used are as follows: for ATG8a (At4g21980), 5′-TCGGAGACTAATCGAATCGC-3′ and 5′-CATCAAAGTCATCCAAAGATCG-3′; for ATG8b (At4g04620.1 and At4g04620.2), 5′-CATCGTAGATACTAACCGAATCATC-3′ and 5′-GATCAGACGTAGAAGCTGAGG-3′; for ATG8c (At1g62040), 5′-AATCTTTGATTCTTTAATCGCC-3′ and 5′-CAAAGCAACATTTACATTAATAGTAG-3′; for ATG8d (At2g05630), 5′-TCTCTTCTCTGTTTCTCTCTCG-3′ and 5′-TCGATCCACATATTCCAAGC-3′; for ATG8e (At2g45170.1), 5′-TTCCATCAAATTCTCTCTCTAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGATTCTCAGAGGTCAGAG-3′; for ATG8f (At4g16520.1 and At4g16520.2), 5′-GTAGTCTACAGGCGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TTATGGAGATCCAAATCCAAATG-3′; for ATG8g (At3g60640), 5′-CGCATAATCCAGAGAGGACC-3′ and 5′-CATTCAATTAAAAGCAAGAACACC-3′; for ATG8h (At3g06420), 5′-TCATTCGTCGTGAAATCTG-3′ and 5′-AAATCTTTTGTTAGCCGAAAG-3′; for ATG8i (At3g15580), 5′-CCGGGCGGTCGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-ACACAGACACTAACATCATTATTGG-3′; for ATG4a (At2g44140.1), 5′-ATGAAGGCTTTATGTGATAGATTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGCATTTGCCAGTCATCTTCAC-3′; for ATG4b (At3g59950.1), 5′-ATGAAGGCTTTATGTGATAGATTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-GTCACACAATGAAAAGAATGGCTAGGAG-3′; for UBQ10 (At4g05320), 5′-TTCACTTGGTCCTGCGTCTTCGTGGTGGTTTC-3′ and 5′-CATCAGGGATTATACAAGGCCCC-3′. To examine the effect of nitrogen starvation on the expression of ATG8a-i, ATG4a, and 4b genes, 0.2 μg of total cellular RNA from leaves was isolated after 1, 3, 6, and 12 h of nitrogen starvation and subjected to quantitative or semiquantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed by the method described previously (CITATION). Gene-specific primers used for quantitative RT-PCR are as follows: for ATG8a, 5′-TCGATTCTTCTTCTCCAGTTTCAATCA-3′ and 5′-CCATTGCGATTCGATTAGTCTCCGAAG-3′; for ATG8b (At4g04620.1 and At4g04620.2), 5′-TTACCTCAGCTTCTACGTCTGATCCTC-3′ and 5′-AGAGAGTCAAATTAGAATCTTGTTTCA-3′; for ATG8c, 5′-CCTAATTCTGTTTTCTACACGAAACCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGATTAAAGAATCAAAGATTAGGGC-3′; for ATG8d, 5′-TGCGCTTGGAATATGTGGATGCATCAG-3′ and 5′-CACCATGAACGGAAGACCTTATCAT-3′; for ATG8e (At2g45170.1 and At2g45170.2), 5′-ATTAGTCTATGTACATTTTAACAAGTG-3′ and 5′-TAATCTCTGACCTCTGAGAATCCGCCA-3′; for ATG8f (At4g16520.1), 5′-GCTTATTTGCTTTTTCTTTCATATTTTTTCG-3′ and 5′-CATTCCTTCCACGCCTGTAGACTACAAAG-3′; for ATG8g, 5′- CCAACACTTTGTTTGCAAACCGATTGG-3′ and 5′-GGTGTTCTTGCTTTTAATTGAATGTAA-3′; for ATG8 h, 5′-GAACAATCAAAAACGAACTAACCAAAC-3′ and 5′-ATCCCCATTACAGATTTCACGACGAATGA-3′; for ATG8i, 5′-GCAGTGAGAAAACCTTTGGTTGATCC-3′ and 5′-GCTTAACAAGTGTTTGATGTCTTTTG-3′. The gene specificity of each primer was confirmed by PCR using plasmids subcloned each full-length cDNA (data not shown). The ATG8a and 8i coding regions, from nucleotides 1 to 351 of ATG8a and 1 to 345 of ATG8i, were amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA using the following primers: for ATG8a, 5′-CGCggatccCAATGGCTAAGAGTTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTCCAAAAGTGTTCTCTCCACTGT-3′; and for ATG8i, 5′-CGCggatccAGATGAAATCGTTCAAGGAACAATAC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccACCAAAGGTTTTCTCACTGCT-3¢, designed to contain a BamHI site (lowercased) at both ends. The resulting products were digested with BamHI and inserted into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for expression in Escherichia coli. After 5 h of induction with 0.05 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the ATG8a and 8i recombinant proteins were purified from the lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column using Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Antisera against ATG8a and 8i were subsequently affinity purified by passing the sera over a column of ATG8a or 8i recombinant proteins coupled to cyanogen bromide–activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Plant protein samples were prepared as follows: 300 mg of each plant were homogenized in 300 μL of SDS sample buffer without a reducing agent and bromophenol blue (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% [w/v] SDS, and 20% [v/v] glycerol) and boiled for 2 to 3 min, then centrifuged at 500g for 1 min. The resultant supernatant was used as total protein. Total proteins were quantified by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunoblot analyses, total protein extracts that had been subjected to SDS-PAGE with or without 6-M urea were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membranes were blocked using 5% milk powder. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200 and 1:5000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, respectively. The secondary antibodies used were peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Signals were detected using the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). To express Arabidopsis ATG4 proteins in yeast, Arabidopsis ATG4 genes were inserted into the yeast expression vector pKT10, which contains the URA3 marker, under the control of the GAP promoter (CITATION). To express 3xmyc-tagged ATG8s proteins in yeast, ATG8 genes were amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA using the following primers: for ATG8a, 5′-CGCggatccCAATGGCTAAGAGTTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTCCAAAAGTGTTCTCTCCACTGT-3′; for ATG8b, 5′-CGCggatccTCATGGAGAAGAACTCCTTCAAGC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccACCAAATGTGTTCTCTCCACTGT-3′; for ATG8c, 5′-CGCggatccCCATGGCTAATAGCTCTTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccACCAAAGGTGTTCTCTCCACTG-3′; for ATG8d, 5′-CGCggatccTCATGGCGATTAGCTCCTTCAA-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccCCCGAACGTGTTCTCACCACTG-3′; for ATG8e, 5′-CGCggatccAGATGAATAAAGGAAGCATCTTTAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccACCGAATGTGTTCTCGCCACTG-3′; for ATG8f, 5′-CGCggatccGAATGGCAAAAAGCTCGTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTCCAAATGTGTTTTCTCCGCTG-3′; for ATG8g, 5′-CGCggatccAGATGAGTAACGTCAGCTTCAGG-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTCCAAAAGTGTTTTCCCCACTG-3′; for ATG8h, 5′-CGCggatccTAATGGGGATTGTTGTCAAGTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccGCCGAAAGTTTTCTCGGTGCTG-3′; and for ATG8i, 5′-CGCggatccAGATGAAATCGTTCAAGGAACAATAC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccACCAAAGGTTTTCTCACTGCT-3′, designed to contain a BamHI site (lowercased) at both ends. The fragments digested with BamHI were substituted for the BamHI-BamHI ATG8 ORF fragment of pRS315:ATG8, which contains an ATG8 fragment that includes the promoter region and the inserted 3xmyc sequence. pRS315:ATG8 was generated by cloning 1.3 kb of the SpeI-EcoRI fragment from an ATG8 plasmid, which was derived from the pRS316 vector (CITATION), into the yeast expression vector pRS315 containing a LEU2 marker. Cells of Δatg4Δatg8 (MATα leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2-Δ9 Δatg8::HIS3 Δatg4::TRP1 Δpho8::PHO8Δ60) were transformed with these plasmids. The transformants were cultured in SC-without-leucine medium to express ATG8s or SC-minus-leucine-and-uracil medium to express ATG8s and ATG4s. All cultures were then transferred to SD-N medium (CITATION). Yeast whole-cell lysates were prepared as previously described (CITATION) and subjected to 13.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody (9E10) (Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA) or anti-ATG8a and anti-ATG8i antibodies. Leaves were chopped in chilled extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL of leupeptin, 10 μg/mL of pepstatin A, and 4% [v/v] protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche, Penzberg, Germany) using a razor and were then filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant (T) was centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min to generate the 13,000g membrane fraction (LSP). The resulting 13,000g supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h to generate the 100,000g membrane fraction (HSP) and the soluble fraction (HSS). Pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer, and fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using purified anti-ATG8a antibodies. For solubilization of ATG8s, the LSP and HSP fractions were resuspended in extraction buffer plus 1 M NaCl, 2 M urea, 0.1 M Na2CO3, 2% Triton X-100, and 1% DOC and incubated on ice for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h to separate soluble from insoluble fractions. The pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The supernatants were precipitated using TCA, and the protein pellets were washed in acetone and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with purified anti-ATG8a antibodies. The full-length ORF of ATG8a, 8e, and 8i with BamHI sites at both ends were amplified by PCR and fused to the C terminus of the ORF of EGFP in pEZS-CL plasmids. Primers used are as follows, each designed to introduce a BamHI site (indicated by lowercase letters): for ATG8a, 5′-CGCggatccCAATGGCTAAGAGTTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTCAAGCAACGGTAAGAGATCCAA-3′; for ATG8e, 5′-CGCggatccAGATGAATAAAGGAAGCATCTTTAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTTAGATTGAAGAAGCACCGAATGTG-3′; for ATG8i, 5′-CGCggatccAGATGAAATCGTTCAAGGAACAATAC-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccTCAACCAAAGGTTTTCTCACTGC-3′. GFP-ATG8-A plasmids were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using the above wild-type GFP-ATG8 plasmids as templates. Primers used are as follows: for ATG8a-A, 5′-GAGAGAACACTTTTGcATCTCTTACCGTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAACGGTAAGAGATgCAAAAGTGTTCTCTC-3′; for ATG8e-A, 5′-GGCGAGAACACATTCGcTGCTTCTTCAATCTA-3′ and 5′-TAGATTGAAGAAGCAgCGAATGTGTTCTCGCC-3′; for ATG8i-A, 5′- GTGAGAAAACCTTTGcTTGAGGATCCACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTGGATCCTCAAgCAAAGGTTTTCTCAC-3′ (lowercase letters represent point mutation sites). A pEZS-CL plasmid containing GFP alone was used as a control. Transient expression of GFP-fused ATG8 proteins in a suspension of Arabidopsis cultured cells was performed by a method described previously (CITATION). For nitrogen starvation, transformed cells were transferred to MS-N medium supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol and incubated under gentle agitation at 23°C for 48 h in the dark. Transformed cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81; Tokyo, Japan). The atg4a-1 plant was isolated from an Arabidopsis T-DNA–mutagenized population created at the University of Wisconsin Arabidopsis Knockout Facility using a PCR-based reverse genetic screen (CITATION, CITATION). The atg4b-1 plant was isolated using the T-DNA insertion line screening system engineered at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute as described previously (CITATION). The primers used to detect T-DNA insertions into the ATG4a and ATG4b genes are as follows: for atg4a-1, ATG4a-specific primers were 5′-ATGAAGGCTTTATGTGATAGATTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGCATTTGCCAGTCATCTTCAC-3′, and the T-DNA–specific primers were 5′-CATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3′ and 5′-TTTCTCCATATTGACCATCATACTCATTG-3′. For atg4b-1, ATG4b-specific primers were 5′-GTCACACAATGAAAAGAATGGCTAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCGTTGTATTTGGTGCTTAATGA-3′, and the T-DNA–specific primers were 5′-TAGATCCGAAACTATCAGTG-3′ and 5′-ATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3′. DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments carrying the T-DNA genome junctions determined the position of the T-DNA insertion in each gene. To construct plasmids for generating stable transformants constitutively expressing GFP-ATG8 fusion proteins, plasmids that transiently expressed each GFP-ATG8 protein under control of a 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus and octopine synthase terminator were digested with NotI and blunt-end ligated into the SmaI site of pCAMBIA 2300 (CAMBIA, Black Mountain, Australia). A pEGAD plasmid containing GFP alone (CITATION) was used as control. To construct the plasmid for complementation of the atg4a4b-1 mutant, a 5357-bp genomic fragment containing a 3-kb sequence upstream from the start codon and the ATG4a coding region was amplified by PCR using a primer set, 5′-CGGggtaccTCTGCAACCTACAGCCCCACAATGGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-CGGggtaccCTCTACTCTTCCATTTTCGCATGCTTC-3¢, designed to introduce a KpnI site (lowercased) into both ends. The fragment was digested with KpnI and then cloned into the KpnI site of the pCAMBIA2300 vector (CAMBIA), resulting in the tATG4a construct. These constructs were verified by sequencing and introduced into wild-type and/or atg4a4b-1 Arabidopsis plants by the floral-dip method of in planta Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation (CITATION). Transgenic plants expressing GFP-ATG8s or atg4a4b-1 mutants expressing the tATG4a transgene were selected on MS medium without sucrose containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin. At least five independent transgenic plants were obtained, and representative data are shown in Figures 7 and 8. Primary roots of transgenic plants expressing GFP-ATG8s grown on MS medium for 1 week were cut and mounted in water for microscopic observation. For nitrogen-starved conditions, transgenic plants grown on MS medium for 1 week were transferred to MS-N medium for an additional 7 d in the dark and then observed. The subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 488/568-nm ArKr laser in combination with a 505- to 550-nm band-pass filter set. Image acquisition and processing were performed using a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, version 2.01) and Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Primary roots of wild-type, atg4a4b-1, or atg4a4b-1;tATG4a plants vertically grown on MS medium for 1 week were cut and then incubated in MS-N liquid medium containing 1 μM concanamycin A (C-9705; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) under gentle agitation at 23°C for 6 to 12 h in the dark. The roots were mounted in water and observed by conventional transmission light microscopy (Olympus IX81). Primary roots of transgenic plants expressing GFP-ATG8s were also treated with concanamycin A as described above and observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX81). The root tips of wild-type and atg4a4b-1 primary roots treated with concanamycin A were fixed in a 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 2% glutaraldehyde for 3 h in an ice bath. The specimens were rinsed in the same buffer and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 3 h in an ice bath. Dehydrated specimens were embedded in epoxy resin (Epon 812). Ultrathin sections (70 to 80 nm) were made with an LKB-8800 ultramicrotome (Amersham Biosciences) using a diamond knife and mounted on 200-mesh copper grids. Sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were observed with a JEM-2000EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 100 kV. Phenotypic analyses were performed as described previously (CITATION), except for examination of root elongation under nitrogen-starved conditions. For measurement of root elongation under nitrogen-starved conditions, wild-type and atg4a4b-1 mutant seeds were sowed on MS-N medium and then, after 21 d, primary root length, number of lateral roots, and total length of lateral roots were counted using NIH Image 1.44 (Bethesda, MD).
