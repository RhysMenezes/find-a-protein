!~ABS~! Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an important enzyme in energy metabolism with diverse cellular regulatory roles in vertebrates, but few reports have investigated the importance of plant GAPDH isoforms outside of their role in glycolysis. While animals possess one GAPDH isoform, plants possess multiple isoforms. In this study, cell biological and genetic approaches were used to investigate the role of GAPDHs during plant immune responses. Individual Arabidopsis GAPDH knockouts (KO lines) exhibited enhanced disease resistance phenotypes upon inoculation with the bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. KO lines exhibited accelerated programmed cell death and increased electrolyte leakage in response to effector triggered immunity. Furthermore, KO lines displayed increased basal ROS accumulation as visualized using the fluorescent probe H2DCFDA. The gapa1-2 and gapc1 KOs exhibited constitutive autophagy phenotypes in the absence of nutrient starvation. Due to the high sequence conservation between vertebrate and plant cytosolic GAPDH, our experiments focused on cytosolic GAPC1 cellular dynamics using a complemented GAPC1-GFP line. Confocal imaging coupled with an endocytic membrane marker (FM4-64) and endosomal trafficking inhibitors (BFA, Wortmannin) demonstrated cytosolic GAPC1 is localized to the plasma membrane and the endomembrane system, in addition to the cytosol and nucleus. After perception of bacterial flagellin, GAPC1 dynamically responded with a significant increase in size of fluorescent puncta and enhanced nuclear accumulation. Taken together, these results indicate that plant GAPDHs can affect multiple aspects of plant immunity in diverse sub-cellular compartments.
!~RES~! To determine whether individual Arabidopsis GAPDH isoforms play a role during infection with Pst DC3000, we screened T-DNA insertion lines for knockout (KO) lines in distinct isoforms. KO lines were obtained for the following GAPDH isoforms: gapa1 (At3g26650, SALK_138657 and SALK_145802), gapc1 (At3g04120, SALK_010839), gapc2 (At1g13440, SALK_016539), gapCp1 (At1g79530, SAIL_390_G10 and SALK_052938), and gapCp2 (At1g16300, SALK_137288 and SALK_008979). The SALK T-DNA KO lines for gapa1 have not been previously published, and RT-PCR validation is provided in CITATION KO lines in the plastidic glycolytic GAPDHs, gapCp1and gapCp2 were previously published [CITATION], as were the cytosolic GAPDHs [CITATION]. RT-PCR validation of gapCp1 and gapCp2 KOs is provided in CITATION Homozygous T-DNA KO lines for GAPA2 and GAPB were not identified and there were no available T-DNA insertions in exons. A screen of two separate T-DNA insertion lines (SALK_023971 and SALK_067204) within the promoter of GAPA2 yielded homozygosity for the insertion without altering gene expression. The general morphology and plant size of individual KO lines during vegetative growth resembled Col-0. After successfully identifying homozygous GAPDH KO lines, we subjected them to a variety of disease assays to determine their relative contribution during infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strain DC3000. KO lines and the Col-0 control were dip inoculated with Pst DC3000 and bacterial titers were determined four days post-inoculation. All of the GAPDH KO lines exhibited enhanced disease resistance, with a 10 fold reduction in bacterial titers compared to the Col-0 control when inoculated with virulent bacteria (Fig CITATION and CITATION). Lower bacterial titers correlated with a similar reduction in disease symptoms (CITATION). Due to the high degree of sequence conservation between human GAPDH with Arabidopsis GAPC1 (68% amino acid similarity), we were particularly interested in the role of GAPC1 in the innate immune response. The gapc1 KO line was complemented with GAPC1-GFP under control of its endogenous promoter (npro::GAPC1-GFP). Two independent, single insertion T3 homozygous lines were identified expressing GAPC1-GFP (CITATION) and bacterial growth was analyzed. Both npro::GAPC1-GFP lines 3–4 and 9–6 complemented the gapc1 KO and exhibited similar bacterial growth and disease symptoms as wild-type Col-0 (Fig CITATION and CITATION). We did not observe any morphological defects in the npro::GAPC1-GFP lines (CITATION). (A) Analysis of bacterial growth in individual GAPA1 (a1-1, a1-2), GAPC1 (c1), and GAPC2 (c2) KO lines illustrating bacterial population sizes four days post dip inoculation with Pst DC3000 at a concentration of (1×109 CFU mL-1). Values represent means ± SE (n = 6). Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s t test (α = 0.01) compared to wild-type Col-0.

(D) The gapc1 KO line was complemented with native promoter (npro) driven full length GAPC1 with a C-terminal fusion to eGFP. Two independent homozygous T3 lines, 3–4 and 9–6, complement the gapc1 disease phenotype. Plants were inoculated and analyzed as described in (A). (E) Representative disease symptoms of the gapc1 KO and npro::GAPC1-GFP complemented lines compared with Col-0 four days post dip inoculation with Pst DC3000. (F) The defense marker gene PR1 is constitutively expressed in GAPDH KO lines relative to wild-type Col-0. Leaf samples taken from untreated four-week-old Col-0 and GAPDH KOs were used to quantify basal expression levels of PR1. Statistical differences were calculated using Fisher’s LSD test (α = 0.05) following a significant F-statistic. Values represent means ±SE (n = 3). Data were analyzed using the ΔΔcT method, and normalized against Arabidopsis ELONGATION FACTOR 1α (At5g60390). Localized programmed cell death is a hallmark of ETI and is termed the hypersensitive response (HR). The HR can be visualized macroscopically when avirulent bacteria are syringe infiltrated into leaves at high concentrations (4×107 CFU mL-1). Pst DC3000 expressing the AvrRpt2 effector, which is recognized by the Arabidopsis RPS2 immune receptor [CITATION], was used to investigate HR responses in individual GAPDH KO lines. The progression of cell death was quantified by measuring electrolyte leakage using a conductivity meter. All KO lines exhibited an accelerated HR and enhanced electrolyte leakage compared to the wild-type Col-0 control, indicating a more rapid cell death progression in the KO lines (CITATION). Macroscopic HR was evaluated as well, and KO lines displayed more rapid tissue collapse starting at 10h post-infiltration while Col-0 collapsed at 12h post-infiltration (CITATION). An enhanced disease resistance phenotype was also found after inoculation with avirulent Pst DC3000 expressing AvrRpt2 (CITATION). Although all KO lines tested exhibit enhanced disease resistance to Pst DC3000, the magnitude of responses varied between individual lines. The gapCps exhibited the highest resistance to virulent bacterial growth and displayed very few chlorotic symptoms, followed by gapc1 in overall symptom reduction and bacterial growth (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). (A) Electrolyte leakage measurements of individual GAPA1-2, GAPC1, GAPC2, GAPCp1-1 and GAPCp2-1 KO lines. Four-week-old leaves were infiltrated with Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 at a concentration of 4×107 CFU mL-1. Values represent means ±SE (n = 4). (B) Macroscopic HR phenotype of Col-0 and GAPDH knockouts 10h post syringe infiltration with Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2. DC3000 empty vector (EV) control is shown as the top leaf. Bacterial concentrations were the same as (A). We used quantitative PCR to determine if the cause of enhanced disease resistance in the GAPDH KOs was due to transcriptional “priming” for a defense response. Pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1) is a commonly used defense marker gene whose expression is induced in response to pathogen perception and salicylic acid [CITATION]. In unchallenged GAPDH KO lines, basal PR1 expression was constitutively up-regulated compared to Col-0 (CITATION). This indicates that GAPDH KO lines may be primed for pathogen defense responses in the absence of an elicitor, leading to accelerated defense responses upon pathogen inoculation. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple GAPDH isoforms act as negative regulators of plant immune responses. Plant GAPDH isoforms arose through multiple gene duplication events [CITATION]. Phylogenetic analyses of the seven Arabidopsis GAPDH isoforms in addition to human and E. coli GAPDH reveals a high degree of sequence conservation (CITATION) [CITATION]. Gene duplication can lead to diversification of biochemical functions and expression patterns. However, duplicated genes may also carry out similar or overlapping functions making genetic analyses challenging. Previously, it was reported that a KO in the non-phosphorylating GAPDH induced higher level expression of GAPC1 [CITATION]. In order to investigate if single GAPDH KOs induce differential regulation of additional isoforms, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses to investigate basal expression of GAPDHs on four-week-old plants. Both GAPCp1 and GAPCp2 were expressed at a very low level and were excluded from the analyses based on their high Cq values (Cq = 34). qPCR analyses of the individual KO lines revealed complex transcriptional regulation of some GAPDH family members relative to wild-type Col-0 (CITATION–CITATION). GAPA1 and GAPA2 were down-regulated in all the GAPDH KOs, while GAPB expression was unchanged in the majority of lines (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). Both GAPC1 and GAPC2 were down-regulated in gapa1-2 (Fig CITATION and CITATION). GAPC2 expression was up-regulated in the gapc1 line, presumably to help compensate for the loss of GAPC1; however, GAPC1 expression was not significantly different from Col-0 in the gapc2 line. Overall, GAPA1, GAPA2 and GAPC1 had the most significant alterations in expression levels in the GAPDH KO lines. Thus, GAPDH family members appear to be under complex regulation, with epistatic interactions occurring between GAPA1 and the cytosolic isoforms. (A) Unrooted phylogeny of Arabidopsis phosphorylating GAPDHs as well as human and E. coli GAPDH. Arabidopsis GAPCs and GAPCps cluster with human GAPDH, while photosynthetic GAPDHs cluster separately. Values at nodes indicate bootstrap values. Scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site visualized in the branch length. (B-F) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of leaves from four-week-old plants were used to quantify basal expression levels of phosphorylating GAPDHs across different KO lines. Expression values are shown relative to wild-type Col-0. Data were analyzed using the ΔΔcT method, and normalized against Arabidopsis ELONGATION FACTOR 1α (At5g60390). Statistical differences were calculated using Fisher’s LSD test (α = 0.05) following a significant F-statistic. Values represent means ±SE (n = 3). (G) Leaf protein extracts from four-week-old GAPDH KO lines and Col-0 were assayed for GAPDH activity in the glycolytic direction. GAPDH activity (mU/mg total protein) in the single KO lines was assayed at 340nm for the reduction in NAD+. Data from a minimum of 5 independent runs were normalized to Col-0 and combined for statistical analyses. Statistical differences were calculated using Fisher’s LSD test (α = 0.05) following a significant F-statistic. Values represent means ±SE (n≥9). (H) Leaf protein extracts from four-week-old GAPDH KO lines and Col-0 were assayed for GAPDH activity in the Calvin cycle direction (photosynthetic). The GAPDH activity in the photosynthetic reaction was measured as described in (G) as the reduction in NADP+ over time. Statistical analyses were performed as described in (G). To assess Arabidopsis GAPDH enzymatic activity in individual KO lines, whole-leaf homogenates were used to analyze rates of glycolysis and the Calvin cycle. While cytosolic GAPC1 and GAPC2 have conserved sequence and glycolytic function with their animal and yeast counterparts, plants have evolved chloroplastic GAPDHs that function in the Calvin cycle. The basic biochemical reaction performed by GAPDH isoforms in glycolysis and the Calvin cycle is the same, with the direction of the reaction being reversed. The direction being assayed can be controlled for in vitro by utilizing a two-step enzymatic assay starting with reagents that preferentially drive substrate production in either direction. We used aldolase and fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate or 3-phosphoglycerate (with endogenous phosphoglycerate kinase) to assess GAPDH enzymatic activity in the direction of either glycolysis (CITATION) or the Calvin cycle (CITATION), respectively. Only gapa1-2 exhibited significantly impaired activity in both directions. This could be explained by the decreased transcript abundance of the cytosolic GAPDH isoforms (GAPC1 and GAPC2) in addition to chloroplastic GAPA2 in gapa1-2. Both gapc1 and gapc2 exhibited significantly reduced activity in the glycolytic direction. The gapCp lines were not altered in activity as compared to Col-0. It is possible that GAPDH activity is reduced in plastids of gapCp KO lines, but this decrease is below the level of detection using a whole leaf assay. Chloroplasts play a role in the initiation and propagation of the HR, the generation of ROS involved in transcriptional reprogramming of defense-related genes, and limiting cell death [CITATION,CITATION]. Therefore, changes in plastid GAPDH activity may alter chloroplast contributions to immunity. GAPDH enzymatically catalyzes the only reductive step in glycolysis and the Calvin cycle, and has been linked to programmed cell death in animal systems [CITATION,CITATION]. Since changes in GAPDH activity have been linked to cell death phenotypes in other organisms, we examined changes in GAPDH enzymatic activity during innate immune responses. Plant immune responses were evaluated after activation of Arabidopsis FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), a pattern-triggered immune receptor which detects a 22 amino acid epitope of bacterial flagellin termed flg22 [CITATION]. Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants were infiltrated with either 5μM flg22 or 10mM MgCl2. Glycolytic GAPDH activity was evaluated in samples harvested at 25min, 1h and 3h post-infiltration. Enzymatic activity significantly increased in flg22 infiltrated samples taken at 1h (p < 0.05) and 3h (p < 0.01) compared with MgCl2 infiltrated samples (CITATION). (A) GAPDH glycolytic activity assays were performed on four-week-old Col-0 after syringe infiltration with 5μM flg22 or H2O at 25 min, 60 min, and 180 min post-infiltration. Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s t test (α = 0.01) compared to water-treated samples at each time point. (B) Col-0 was infiltrated with 4×107 CFU mL-1 Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2, DC3000 empty vector (EV) or MgCl2. Samples were harvested for the glycolytic activity assay 8h post-infiltration. Statistical analyses were performed as described in (A). (C-D) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of four-week-old Col-0 leaves 3h post-infiltration with 5μM flg22 or water. (C) and (D) segregate separate qPCR runs. Values represent means ± SE (n = 3). Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s t test (α = 0.01, and 0.001) compared to H20 treated controls. Data were analyzed using the ΔΔcT method, and normalized against Arabidopsis ELONGATION FACTOR 1α (At5g60390). To determine whether transcriptional regulation of GAPDHs occurs during PTI, we performed qPCR analyses using five of the seven phosphorylating GAPDH genes in the Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype. Four-week-old Col-0 plants were infiltrated with either 5μM flg22 or water and leaf tissue was harvested 3h post infiltration. At 3h post infiltration GAPA1, GAPA2 and GAPB transcripts were slightly down-regulated to less than half the control, while GAPC1 transcript levels increased by more than two-fold (Fig CITATION and CITATION). These results demonstrate contrasting regulation of photosynthetic and glycolytic GAPDHs during PTI. GAPDH enzymatic activity increased in the glycolytic direction during PTI (CITATION), consistent with an increase in transcription of GAPC1. In order to evaluate alterations in glycolytic GAPDH enzymatic activity during ETI responses, four-week-old Col-0 plants were infiltrated with 10mM MgCl2 or a bacterial suspension of Pst DC3000 carrying empty vector or AvrRpt2. Tissue was harvested at the first signs of the HR when vein silvering was initially visible (~8h post-infiltration). GAPDH activity was significantly increased in leaves infiltrated with Pst DC3000 empty vector compared to MgCl2, as well as in leaves undergoing ETI responses (CITATION). We were unable to detect a gross change in total GAPDH protein levels during bacterial infection or flg22 elicited immune responses using anti-GAPDH western blotting (CITATION). However, the sensitivity of western blotting is antibody dependent [CITATION]. Therefore, our antibody may not be sensitive enough to detect minor changes in protein abundance. All GAPDH KO lines exhibited enhanced disease resistance to virulent and avirulent Pst DC3000. One potent set of anti-microbial molecules produced by plant cells during the innate immune response are reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is well documented that the role of extracellular ROS production mediated by the NADPH oxidase respiratory burst oxidase-D (RBOHD) is critical to mounting an effective defense response to bacterial pathogens [CITATION]. A luminol-based extracellular ROS assay using flg22 as an elicitor was not able to cause a significant alteration in extracellular ROS production for gapc1 and gapc2 mutant lines compared to Col-0. Interestingly, when all ROS data was analyzed together, gapa1-2 had a significantly reduced burst compared to Col-0 (CITATION). GAPA1 is localized to the chloroplasts, a site of significant intracellular ROS production [CITATION]. It is possible that loss of GAPA1 alters redox homeostasis, dampening the ROS burst produced by the NADPH oxidase RBOHD. GAPDHs can directly impact cellular redox potential through their involvement in the reducing step of either glycolysis or the Calvin cycle [CITATION,CITATION]. Therefore, the basal intracellular ROS levels of GAPDH KO lines were analyzed. Protoplasts were isolated from four-week-old Col-0, gapa1-2, gapc1, gapc2, gapCp1-2 and gapCp2-2 plants and incubated under bright light for 1h since chloroplastic isoforms are light activated enzymes [CITATION,CITATION]. Following incubation in the light, the intracellular ROS probe H2DCFDA was added and protoplasts were kept in the dark for 15 min prior to imaging (CITATION). The extent of H2DCFDA fluorescence was quantified from the pixel intensity for each genotype (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). Although all GAPDH KO lines exhibited significantly enhanced basal intracellular ROS (p<0.01), the magnitude of enhanced ROS varied between lines (CITATION–CITATION). The accelerated cell death observed across GAPDH KO lines during the HR may be explained by increased intracellular ROS production in response to bright light stimulation, as HR development depends on light and plants are placed under a light bank after inoculation [CITATION]. (A) Histochemical detection of ROS in protoplasts isolated from the indicated genotypes upon incubation with the fluorescent probe H2-DCFDA. Protoplasts were left under bright light for 1h and 750 nM of H2-DCFDA was added 15 min prior to imaging. Protoplasts were imaged using an epifluorescence microscope fitted with a GFP filter. Boxes indicate separate experiments and bar = 10 μm. (B-D) Quantification of H2-DCFDA fluorescence. Pixel intensity corresponding to fluorescence of intact protoplasts was quantified across three experimental replicates (n≥25) and combined for statistical analyses. Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s t test (α = 0.01** and = 0.001***). Previous reports indicated that recombinant GAPA1, GAPC1 and GAPC2 are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment, supporting a hypothesis for GAPDHs as cellular redox sensors [CITATION–CITATION]. In order to investigate if all phosphorylating GAPDH proteins are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli and their enzymatic activity assessed before and after incubation with hydrogen peroxide (CITATION). As previously shown, GAPC1 and GAPC2 activity was decreased after incubation with hydrogen peroxide (CITATION, [CITATION,CITATION]). Furthermore, GAPCp1 and GAPCp2 activity was also inhibited upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide (CITATION). At lower concentrations, ROS have been described as acting as inter- and intracellular signaling molecules which may condition cells for accelerated responses to stimuli [CITATION]. If GAPDHs are acting as cellular redox buffers, loss of one of these isoforms may allow for greater ROS accumulation. We chose to investigate GAPC1 localization in detail due to its highly conserved amino acid sequence similarity to GAPDHs in other organisms (CITATION). In addition to cytosolic and nuclear localizations, animal systems have linked GAPDH to endosomal movement and membrane fusion [CITATION–CITATION]. Signaling platforms at the plasma membrane and endomembrane are proving to be crucial in defense signaling of Arabidopsis as well as animal systems [CITATION]. Arabidopsis GAPC1 has been reported to be primarily cytosolic, with some nuclear re-localization events in cells stressed by cadmium [CITATION], but no endomembrane localization has been described. Our results indicating a change in glycolytic activity led us to hypothesize that GAPC1 undergoes dynamic partitioning during the immune response potentially mediated by subcellular re-localization. We investigated GAPC1 localization by confocal microscopy using the npro::GAPC1-GFP line 3–4. Plasmolysis using 1M NaCl revealed GAPC1-GFP localized to Hechtian strands, indicating partial plasma membrane localization (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). Western blotting after membrane fractionation in wild-type Col-0 using α-GAPDH shows endogenous GAPDH is present in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (CITATION). Thus, GAPC1 exhibits diverse subcellular localizations in the absence of stress conditions. Confocal micrographs of the gapc1 KO complemented with npro::GAPC1-GFP (line 3–4) show optical sections of three-week-old leaves. (A- C) Plasmolysis using 1 M NaCl demonstrates that GAPC1-GFP is localized to Hechtian strands, providing evidence of plasma membrane localization. Arrow indicates Hechtian strand, and dotted line marks the cell boundary. (D-F) Leaves treated for 1.5 h with 30 μM BFA and co-stained with 1 μM FM4-64 highlight localization of GAPC1-GFP in BFA bodies. (G-H) Leaves treated with 33 μM Wortmannin (Wm) have an increased size of GAPC1-GFP fluorescent puncta relative to water treatment. Inset shows enlarged representative fluorescent puncta. Bar = 10 μm. In order to further probe the relationship between GAPC1 and cellular membranes, we treated the first true leaves of three-week-old plants grown in soil with either 30μM Brefeldin A (BFA) or 33μM Wortmannin and examined them by confocal microscopy. BFA is known to inhibit ARF-GEFs and block the Golgi dependent secretion pathway resulting in the characteristic formation of “BFA bodies”, while Wortmannin is an inhibitor of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase, and interferes with endocytosis and vacuolar sorting [CITATION–CITATION]. In the presence of BFA, characteristic BFA bodies stained with FM4-64 co-localized with GAPC1-GFP, indicating that GAPC1-GFP localization is BFA-sensitive (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). FM4-64 is an amphiphilic styryl dye that fluoresces in hydrophobic environments such as lipid membranes and is commonly used as an endocytic marker [CITATION]. In animal systems BFA induces the ADP-ribosylation of two proteins: GAPDH and CtBP3/BARS [CITATION,CITATION]. However, subcellular localization of GAPDH in response to BFA treatment has not been previously visualized in either plants or animals. In the Wortmannin treated seedlings, an increase in the size of endosomes occurred (Fig CITATION and CITATION). These data indicate that GAPC1-GFP localization is sensitive to the inhibition of Golgi-mediated and late endocytic trafficking pathways. Furthermore, these results highlight the diverse sub-cellular localization of GAPC1. During the plant innate immune response, several proteins dynamically re-localize to different sub-cellular compartments [CITATION]. FLS2, the well characterized flagellin receptor, is an example of a protein that is dynamically re-localized after immune activation. FLS2 is localized to the plasma membrane and is intimately connected with the endomembrane system. In the absence of flagellin perception, resting state FLS2 is recycled through the trans-Golgi network and early endosomal pathway [CITATION]. When activated, FLS2 is endocytosed, traffics through the endocytic pathway to late endosomes and reaches the multi-vesicular body, presumably for sorting and degradation [CITATION,CITATION]. Thus, flg22 is an excellent probe for cellular re-localization responses during PTI. We detected a change in total GAPDH activity during innate immune responses (Fig CITATION and CITATION) and an association of GAPC1 with diverse compartments in Arabidopsis (CITATION, [CITATION]). Therefore, GAPC1-GFP localization was examined after elicitation with flg22. Leaves of four-week-old plants were infiltrated with 10mM MgCl2 or 5μM flg22 diluted in 10mM MgCl2 and imaged 30 min post-infiltration by confocal microscopy. Leaves infiltrated with MgCl2 alone exhibited GAPC1-GFP labeled fluorescent puncta that were on average half the size of those in leaves treated with flg22 (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). In order to statistically quantify the size change of GAPC1-GFP puncta after flg22 treatment, images from both treatments were pooled and blindly processed for average size. Flg22 treatment was found to induce a significant increase in puncta area (p< 0.01). Arabidopsis GAPC1 and animal GAPDH have also been described as dynamically re-localizing to the nucleus in response to cellular stress [CITATION,CITATION]. Quantification of fluorescently-labeled nuclei from confocal z-stack slices revealed an increase in nuclear-localized GAPC1-GFP after flg22 treatment (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). Isolation of nuclei from seedlings treated with water or 5μM flg22 supports enhanced accumulation of GAPC1-GFP in the nucleus after flg22 treatment (CITATION). Together, these data indicate a dynamic re-distribution of GAPC1-GFP to the endomembrane system and nucleus during innate immune signaling. Confocal micrographs of the gapc1 KO complemented with npro::GAPC1-GFP (line 3–4) show optical sections of leaves from four-week-old plants ±flg22. (A) Leaves were infiltrated with a needleless syringe with 10mM MgCl2 and imaged after 30 min. Arrows indicate representative vesicles. (B) Leaves were infiltrated with 5μM of the elicitor flg22 and imaged after 30 min. Arrows indicate representative vesicles. (C) Images were quantified using ImageJ to calculate the area (μM2) of GAPC1-GFP labeled vesicles per image across each treatment (n = 10). Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s t test (α = 0.001). The size of GAPC1-GFP labeled vesicle increases significantly (p< 0.01) at 30 min post-infiltration with flg22. (D-E) Nuclear localization of GAPC1-GFP 30 min post-infiltration with 10mM MgCl2 (D) or 5μM flg22 (E). Arrows indicate individual nuclei. (F) Treatment with flg22 enhances GAPC1-GFP nuclear localization. Nuclei were quantified from z-stacks of n = 10 images per treatment. Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s t test (α = 0.001). (G) Nuclear isolation of npro::GAPC1-GFP seedlings treated 30 min with water or 5μM flg22. Accumulation of GAPC1-GFP in the nuclei of flg22-treated seedlings was detected using α-GFP western blotting. Nuclear enrichment was detected using α-Histone 3 (α-H3) and purity of nuclei was detected using the chloroplast specific photosystem II membrane protein by α-psbO western blotting. Bar = 10μm for all confocal images. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular recycling mechanism, involved in degrading unnecessary or damaged materials and organelles during normal growth and development [CITATION]. Although autophagy is an active process in growth and development, few autophagy bodies are present in wild-type plants under normal basal growth conditions [CITATION]. During specific cellular-stresses such as exposure to ROS, endoplasmic reticulum stress or nutrient starvation, autophagy is induced and can lead to programmed cell death [CITATION]. Given that GAPDHs are involved in glucose metabolism and the individual KO lines exhibit enhanced disease resistance, accelerated HR, and enhanced intracellular ROS accumulation, we sought to examine alterations in autophagy responses. In Arabidopsis, autophagy can be induced by nitrogen starvation elicited by growing seedlings on nitrogen-limiting media [CITATION]. For our experiments, two-week-old seedlings were grown first on full strength MS agarose media then transferred to liquid MS or liquid MS lacking nitrogen to induce autophagy for a period of 4–5 days. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a fluorescent dye that specifically binds autophagosomes [CITATION,CITATION], was used to visualize autophagy induction by confocal microscopy. Concanamycin A, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases, was used to de-acidify the vacuole and allow for visualization of autophagosome accumulation in the vacuole. When grown on full MS media, Col-0 exhibits very few to no autophagy bodies (CITATION). Interestingly, gapa1-2 and gapc1 seedlings grown on full nutrient media exhibited an enhanced accumulation of autophagosomes in the vacuole as compared to Col-0 (Fig CITATION and CITATION). Quantification of MDC-labeled puncta within 30 μm2 sections revealed a significantly higher number of MDC-labeled autophagosomes in gapa1-2 and gapc1 seedlings than Col-0 (CITATION). However, there was no gross difference observed between Col-0 and the gapdh KO lines in the number of autophagy bodies present under nitrogen starvation (CITATION). These data suggest a role for GAPA1 and GAPC1 in the negative regulation of basal autophagy, as the induced autophagy response is phenotypically normal. (A-C) Confocal micrographs of Col-0, gapa1-2, and gapc1 KO lines show optical sections of leaves from two-week-old plants grown in full MS. Seedlings were assayed with the fluorescent probe MDC. Autophagosomes were stained using 50 μM MDC for 3 h. The gapa1 and gapc1 KO lines had many MDC-labeled bodies when grown in full MS, but wild-type Col-0 did not exhibit a significant number of basal MDC-labeled bodies. One μM Concanamycin A or the equivalent amount of solvent DMSO was added 15 h prior to imaging. Bar = 10μm. (D-F) Confocal micrographs of 10 day old Col-0, gapa1-2, and gapc1 KO lines transiently transfected with tRFP-Atg8a to visualize cytosolic autophagosomes. Transiently transfected seedlings all exhibit tRFP-Atg8a labeled autophagosomes, with greater numbers present in gapa1-2 and gapc1 KOs. Bar = 10 μm. (G-H) Images depicted above were quantified using ImageJ to calculate the number of MDC (G) or tRFP-Atg8a (H) labeled bodies in an area of 30 μM2. Both gapa1-2 and gapc1 seedlings have significant increases in autophagosome number relative to Col-0. Statistical differences were calculated using Fisher’s LSD test (α = 0.05) following a significant F-statistic to compare means of all genotypes. Values represent means ±SE (n = 6). (I) The unfolded protein response (UPR) triggered by ER stress is not constitutively activated in gapa1-2 or gapc1 KOs. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of bZIP60 mRNA demonstrates no cleavage product, indicating that UPR is not activated. The positive control on the left was induced in Col-0 leaves by infiltration with 2 mM DTT. ELONGATION FACTOR 1α (EF1α) served as a control for equal mRNA levels. To confirm the autophagy phenotype observed with MDC, seedlings were transiently transfected with tRFP-ATG8a and autophagosomes visualized by microscopy. Autophagy is regulated by a set of autophagy-related genes (Atgs) that are highly conserved across eukaryotes [CITATION]. When autophagy is initiated, the ubiquitin-like Atg8 protein can be used as a marker to label cytosolic autophagosomes [CITATION,CITATION]. Autophagosomes labeled with tRFP-Atg8a were present in the cytoplasm of Col-0, gapa1-2, and gapc1 seedlings (Fig CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION). Similar to the MDC-labeling, quantification of the number of fluorescently-labeled puncta in 30 μm2 image sections revealed a significantly higher number of autophagosomes present in gapa1-2 and gapc1 seedlings compared to Col-0 (CITATION). Autophagy is a diversely regulated process and is intricately connected to cellular glucose metabolism [CITATION]. Not only does glucose availability directly impact glycolysis, but it also impacts glycosylation modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [CITATION]. Under nutrient stress a disruption of protein glycosylation in the ER can lead to the unfolded protein response (UPR) and trigger autophagy [CITATION]. To investigate UPR-triggered autophagy, we examined the UPR marker bZIP60 [CITATION]. During the UPR in plants, IRE1A and IRE1B are activated and cause the cleavage of the mRNA bZIP60, which can be visualized by the presence of a doublet after RT-PCR using primers spanning the cleavage site [CITATION,CITATION]. Col-0 treated with 2mM DTT was used as a positive control for induction of the UPR and confirmed the generation of a doublet PCR product (CITATION) using previously published primers that span the alternate splicing site [CITATION]. No cleavage of bZIP60 mRNA was observed in the gapa1 or gapc1 KO lines with or without elicitation by flg22 (CITATION). Without cleavage of bZIP60 mRNA, canonical UPR activation should not be responsible for the induction of autophagy.
!~MM~! T-DNA insertion lines for GAPA1 (SALK_138567 and SALK_145802; gapa1-1 and gapa1-2 respectively), GAPC1 (SALK_010839), and GAPC2 (SALK_016935) were obtained from the SALK institute, genotyped, and homozygous KO lines were verified by RT-PCR. Homozygous seed for GAPCp1 (SAIL_390_G10 and SALK_052938; gapCp1-1 and gapCp1-2 respectively) and GAPCp2 (SALK_137288, SALK_008979; gapCp2-1 and gapCp2-2 respectively) were previously described [CITATION]. Plants were grown in a controlled environmental chamber at 23°C with a 10-h light/14-h dark photoperiod under a light intensity of 85 μE/m2/s. For all the experiments, 4–5 week old plants were used. Transgenic npro::GAPC1-GFP lines were generated using the floral dip method [CITATION], in order to complement the gapc1 KO. The length of native promoter we used was 811bp, and it was PCR amplified and cloned as an in-frame fusion to genomic GAPC1 in pENTR (Invitrogen). Next, the GAPC1 construct was transferred into the binary vector pGWB4 using gateway technology to generate a C-terminal GFP tag [CITATION]. Transgenic plants were selected on 50μg/mL hygromycin. T3 homozygous lines were used for all experiments. All PCR primers used for genotyping and cloning are listed in CITATION. Pst DC3000 and Pst DC3000 (AvrRpt2), were grown on nutrient yeast-glycerol (NYG) plates for 30 h, then cultured at 28°C in NYG media for 48 h. Pst DC3000 (AvrRpt2) expressed AvrRpt2 from the broad-host range vector pDSK519 [CITATION]. Antibiotics were used for plate selection at the following concentrations: 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml rifampicin, and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. For dip inoculation, Arabidopsis plants were grown in a mesh covered pot to facilitate submergence for 30 sec of the aerial portion into bacterial suspension containing 1×109 CFU/ml bacteria in 10 mM MgCl2with 0.02% silwet L-77. Inoculated plants were left covered with a plastic dome for 3h. At 4 days post inoculation, leaves were surface sterilized for 30 sec in 70% ethanol and bacterial populations were determined as described by Kim and colleagues [CITATION]. All experiments were repeated at least three times, with a minimum of six biological replicates per time point. For both HR and electrolyte leakage, Arabidopsis Col-0 and GAPDH KO leaves were infiltrated using a needleless syringe with 4×107 CFU/ml of Pst DC3000 and Pst DC3000 (AvrRpt2). After infiltration, plants were placed under a light bank (100 μE/m2/s) and HR was scored at 10 h post inoculation. For electrolyte leakage, two leaves per plant were infiltrated across four biological replicates per genotype. Total tissue was harvested using a cork borer to generate 1.5 cm2 of leaf discs (six total leaf discs). Leaf discs were placed in distilled water (20mL in a 50mL conical tube) for 1h and individual biological replicates kept separate. Leaf discs were transferred to a 12-well tissue culture plate (Corning) containing 4mL of distilled water per well and placed under the light bank. Conductivity was measured using the Orion 3 Star conductivity meter (Thermo Scientific). All experiments were repeated at least three times. MEGA6 was used to perform phylogenetic analysis on GAPDH amino acid sequences and draw the un-rooted tree [CITATION]. A maximum-likelihood tree construction was used based on the JTT matrix-based model with bootstraps. Total RNA was extracted using the TRI zol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and subsequently incubated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove genomic DNA contamination. RNA was extracted from three biological replicates per treatment. Each biological sample comprised two leaves from a single plant, and the pooled 2μg of RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription with Promega M-MLV reverse transcriptase in the presence of 0.5μg/μl oligo(dT) primers. Equal amounts of first-strand cDNAs were used as templates for RT-PCR amplification using the primers listed in supplemental CITATION. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was run for 30 cycles for gapa1-2 lines and 35 cycles for gapCp lines. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions used Bio-Rad SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix according to manufacturer’s directions using a CFX96 Touch (Bio-Rad). Thermocyling parameters began with a first step at 95°C for 30 sec and 39 cycles afterwards alternating between 5 sec at 95°C and 15 sec at 60°C. A melting curve followed the final cycle and ran 5s at 65°C and 5 s at 95°C. Gene expression was normalized against the Arabidopsis ELONGATION FACTOR 1-ALPHA (At5g60390). Protoplasts were prepared enzymatically according to previously described methods [CITATION]. After isolation, protoplasts were re-suspended in W1 solution (0.5 M mannitol, 4 mM MES, pH 5.7, 20 mM KCl) after the rinse steps with W5 (154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MES, pH 5.7) and allowed to sit and recover for 5h before treatment. After resting, protoplasts were quantified with a hemacytometer and aliquoted into a 24 well Corning Costar cell culture plate where they were diluted with W1 to 1 x 105 cells/ 200μL. The cell culture plate was moved to a light bank where the protoplasts were left under bright light for 1h. Prior to imaging, 750nM 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, CalBioChem) was added and cells incubated in the dark for 12–15 min. Images used for quantification of gapa1 and Col-0 (CITATION) were obtained using a Leica DM 5000B epifluorescent microscope with a GFP cube (excitation 470/40, emission 525/50). All other genotypes were imaged using the Axio Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using a 40X objective (EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 40X/ 0.75, Zeiss). Fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ from a minimum of 25 protoplasts across 10 or more images per genotype. SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures [CITATION]. GAPC1-GFP immunoblots were performed with Anti-GFP (ab290, Abcam) rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:8,000. Anti-cF6BP immunoblots were performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1: 5,000 (Agrisera). Anti-RIN4 immunoblotting used affinity purified antisera from rabbit at 1:3,000. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Histone 3 (ab1791, Abcam) and anti-psbO (ab65563, Abcam) were used at 1:1,000 and 1:3,000, respectively. Secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (Biorad) was used at a dilution of 1:3,000 for detection via enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). GAPDH immunoblots were performed using anti-GAPDH (GenScript) goat polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:500. Secondary bovine anti-goat IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:3,000 for detection via enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Plasmids containing the seven phosphorylating GAPDH cDNAs in a pET28a backbone were transfected into E. coli. Recombinant protein was purified on Ni-NTA Agarose beads (Qiagen) and used for Western blotting. Leaves from 4–5 week old rosette leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen by mortar and pestle. Each sample contained pooled leaves from 3–4 plants. Homogenates were otherwise prepared as described [CITATION]. To the frozen, ground tissue, 600 μl of buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5mM EDTA, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2mM 2-mercaptoethanol was added. The homogenate was transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and protein content quantified by Pierce 660 protein assay (Thermo Scientific) and normalized across all samples and 30μg of total leaf protein was used for all activity assays. Cytosolic GAPDH activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using a Spectramax Plus384 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) at 340nm by the reduction of NAD+, as described [CITATION]. Photosynthetic GAPDH activity was also assayed as described previously with minor modifications [CITATION]. 3-phosphoglycerate kinase was omitted in the photosynthetic GAPDH activity assay since it is present and abundant in the leaf extract [CITATION]. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times, and data was normalized to the control and all runs combined for statistical analysis. In the recombinant GAPDH activity assays, 1.5 μg of total protein was used. Hydrogen peroxide at specified concentrations was added just prior to the initiation of the assay. All confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope equipped with a LDC-apochromat 40×/1.1W Korr M27 water-immersion objective (NA 1.1). GFP was excited at 488nm, emission collected at 500–550nm for all experiments except MDC treatments. After treatment with 50 μM MDC, GFP emission was collected at 510–560nm. Leaves incubated with 1 μM FM464 (Invitrogen) were excited at 488nm and emission collected at 620–660nm. MDC was visualized using UV laser and emission of 467–510nm. For flg22 treatment, leaves of four-week-old plants were infiltrated using a needleless syringe with 5μM flg22 (GenScript, 80.1% purity) or water and imaged after 30 min. Images were randomized and aggregate size was blindly quantified using ImageJ. Brefeldin A (BFA, Sigma) bodies and endosomal networks were imaged using three-week-old seedlings submerged in 1μM FM4-64 for 3h with or without addition of 30μM BFA 1.5h prior to imaging. Autophagy was examined according to [CITATION], with slight modifications. Seeds were sown on full MS agarose plates and grown for 10 days in 16h light/ 8h dark at 23°C. Seedlings were then transferred to liquid media containing MS or nitrogen-free MS (PhytoTechnology Laboratories) for 4–5 more days under the same growth conditions. The night before imaging, 1μM Concanamycin A (Sigma) or equivalent volume of DMSO was added to each well. Three hours before imaging, 50μM MDC was added and plates were wrapped in foil and kept in the dark. Transient expression of 2x35S::tRFP-Atg8a was as previously described [CITATION], with some modifications. After a four day co-cultivation period with Agrobacterium GV3101 the co-cultivation media was removed and seedlings were washed three times with distilled water. Seedlings were then re-suspended in full MS media and imaged by confocal microscopy. All image analysis was performed using a combination of software tools, Zen 2012 software (Carl Zeiss), ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). Isolation of Arabidopsis nuclei was carried out as previously described with some modifications [CITATION]. Two week old seedlings were transferred to a six-well culture plate and treated ± 5 μM flg22 for 30 min. One gram of seedlings from each treatment was frozen in liquid nitrogen for nuclear isolation. Seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and re-suspended in 5mL Extraction Buffer (2 M hexylene glycol, 20 mM PIPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Spermidine, 1 mM Spermine, 1 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100). The suspension was stirred at 4°C for 10 minutes and then filtered through two layers of cheesecloth stacked with two layers of Miracloth (EMD Millipore). Percoll suspensions of 30% and 80% Percoll were prepared in Gradient Buffer (0.5M hexylene glycol, 5 mM PIPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 10mM MgCl2, 1 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100). Three mL of 30% Percoll were added to a 15 mL conical tube and under-laid with 3 mL of 80% Percoll. The plant extract was pipetted on top and the sample was centrifuged at 1000g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Nuclei were extracted from the interface between the 30% and 80% Percoll layers into a 2 mL tube. The nuclear fraction was brought to 0.5 mL volume with Gradient buffer and under-laid with 30% Percoll and centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. After the supernatent was completely removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 0.5 mL gradient buffer, 0.5 mL of 30% Percoll was again under-laid and the 2000g centrifugation repeated. The pellet was then re-suspended in Laemmli buffer, quantified for equal loading using Pierce 660 protein assay (Thermo Scientific), and diluted to 1 μg/ 10 μl for SDS-PAGE gel analysis.
