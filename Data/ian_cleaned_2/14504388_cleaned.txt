!~ABS~! SOS2 (salt overly sensitive 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase required for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we identified the protein phosphatase 2C ABI2 (abscisic acid-insensitive 2) as a SOS2-interacting protein. Deletion analysis led to the discovery of a novel protein domain of 37 amino acid residues, designated as the protein phosphatase interaction (PPI) motif, of SOS2 that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with ABI2. The PPI motif is conserved in protein kinases of the SOS2 family (i.e., protein kinase S, PKS) and in the DNA damage repair and replication block checkpoint kinase, Chk1, from various organisms including humans. Mutations in the conserved amino acid residues in the PPI motif abolish the interaction of SOS2 with ABI2. We also identified a protein kinase interaction domain in ABI2 and examined the interaction specificity between PKS and the ABI phosphatases. We found that some PKSs interact strongly with ABI2 whereas others interact preferentially with ABI1. The interaction between SOS2 and ABI2 was disrupted by the abi2-1 mutation, which causes increased tolerance to salt shock and abscisic acid insensitivity in plants. Our results establish the PPI motif and the protein kinase interaction domain as novel protein interaction domains that mediate the binding between the SOS2 family of protein kinases and the ABI1/2 family of protein phosphatases.
!~RES~! Identification of ABI2 as a SOS2-Interacting Protein. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we screened for proteins that interact with the protein kinase SOS2. The entire SOS2 cDNA was fused in-frame with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 to generate a bait construct in the plasmid pAS2, and the construct was transformed into the yeast strain Y190 (CITATION). We screened a λ-ACT cDNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from young Arabidopsis seedlings (CITATION). Sequence analysis revealed that 7 of the 101 putative interacting clones that we isolated encode ABI2 (see refs. CITATION and CITATION). A combination of the bait plasmid pAS-SOS2 with the empty prey vector pACT2 did not activate transcription of the β-gal reporter gene (FIG-REF). Strong β-gal activity was observed when the SOS2 bait was combined with ABI2 in the prey vector (FIG-REF). To confirm whether SOS2 can bind to ABI2 in vitro, an affinity pull-down assay was carried out. [35S]Methioninelabeled SOS2 protein was incubated with the GST-ABI2 or GST-RB (maize retinoblastoma protein; see ref. CITATION) fusion protein on Sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted and washed, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE. The labeled SOS2 protein was detected from the GST-ABI2 beads but not from the control GST-RB beads, demonstrating that SOS2 can bind to ABI2 in vitro (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] Although ABI1 is very similar in sequence to ABI2 (CITATION, CITATION), we did not find ABI1 among the putative interacting clones from the yeast two-hybrid screen (data not shown). A combination of the SOS2 bait and ABI1 in the prey vector led only to a slight activation of the β-gal reporter gene expression (FIG-REF). As a negative control, a combination of the C-terminal tail of SOS1 (CITATION) as a bait with either ABI1 or ABI2 in the prey vector failed to activate the reporter gene (FIG-REF). Together, these results show that SOS2 preferentially binds to ABI2. Identification of an ABI2-Binding Motif in SOS2. To identify a minimal region of SOS2 that is sufficient for interaction with ABI2, we made serial deletions of SOS2 in the bait vector pAS2 (FIG-REF). When combined with the empty prey plasmid pACT2, none of the deletion constructs of SOS2 baits activated the β-gal reporter gene (FIG-REF). The bait construct SOS2-T1, which contains the C-terminal regulatory domain of SOS2, activated transcription of the β-gal reporter gene when combined with the ABI2 prey plasmid (FIG-REF). In contrast, the N-terminal region of SOS2 (SOS2-N), which corresponds to the kinase catalytic domain (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION), did not activate the reporter gene. These results indicate that the C-terminal, but not the N-terminal, region of SOS2 interacts with ABI2. [[FIGURE]] The FISL motif (amino acids 309–329) of SOS2 mediates the interaction with SOS3 (CITATION). SOS2-T3, which does not contain the FISL motif, also interacted with ABI2 (FIG-REF), showing that the FISL motif is not important for SOS2 interaction with ABI2. We found that the SOS2 sequence between amino acid residues 333 and 385 but not 386 and 446 interacted with ABI2 (FIG-REF). Further analysis showed that the SOS2 sequence between amino acids 333 and 369 is sufficient for interaction with ABI2 in the yeast two-hybrid system (FIG-REF). We designated this 37-aa sequence of SOS2 the PPI motif. To determine whether the 37-aa PPI motif can bind ABI2 in vitro, we carried out a pull-down assay with 35S-labeled ABI2 and GST-PPI fusion protein or GST alone on Sepharose beads. ABI2 was found to bind to the GST-PPI but not GST control beads (FIG-REF). The result shows that the PPI peptide is sufficient for binding to ABI2 in vitro. The PPI Motif Is Conserved in PKS. Previously, we showed that a SOS2-like protein kinase, PKS3, interacts strongly with ABI2 and weakly with ABI1 (CITATION). To examine whether other PKSs can interact with ABI1 and/or ABI2, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays with PKS11 (CITATION), PKS18 (CITATION), and PKS24 (CITATION) as baits. PKS11 and PKS24 interacted preferentially with ABI2 but not with ABI1 (FIG-REF). In contrast, PKS18 interacted strongly with ABI1 but only weakly with ABI2 (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] Sequence alignment shows that the PPI motif of SOS2 is conserved in these protein kinases (FIG-REF). Interestingly, the motif is also conserved in the DNA replication checkpoint kinase Chk1 from humans (FIG-REF). To determine whether the putative PPI motif of PKS3 can mediate its interaction with ABI2, we made a bait plasmid containing amino acids 327–371 of PKS3. As shown in FIG-REF, this putative PPI sequence interacted with ABI2. In the PPI motif of SOS2, Arg-340 and Phe-341 are highly conserved among the protein kinases (FIG-REF). To further elucidate the amino acids important for the kinases to interact with protein phosphatases, we mutated these two residues of SOS2 and tested the impact of the mutations on the protein interaction. Interaction of the SOS2 bait with the ABI2 prey was abolished when Arg-340 and Phe-341 were both substituted with alanine (R340AF341A) (FIG-REF), suggesting that these two conserved residues in the protein kinase are important for interaction with the ABI phosphatases. In comparison, substitution of Leu-324 with aspartic acid (L324D), which is located within the FISL motif, did not affect the interaction of SOS2 with ABI2 (FIG-REF). As expected, the L324D mutation abolished the interaction with SOS3 (FIG-REF). The R340AF341A mutations also weakened the interaction with SOS3 (FIG-REF), which may be caused by a steric hindrance effect of the mutations on the neighboring FISL motif. [[FIGURE]] Identification of a SOS2-Interacting Domain in ABI2. To determine which region of ABI2 is involved in the interaction with SOS2, we made deletion constructs of ABI2 in the prey plasmid pACT2 (FIG-REF), and their interaction with SOS2 was evaluated by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The N-terminal region (amino acids 1–224, 1/224) of ABI2 retained the interaction with SOS2, whereas the C-terminal region (amino acids 225–423, 225/423) did not interact with SOS2 (FIG-REF). This finding suggests that the N-terminal half of ABI2 is sufficient for the interaction with SOS2, although the interaction is not as strong as for the full-length ABI2. Weak but significant β-gal activity was still observed when the prey plasmid harbored only amino acid residues 112–224 (112/224) of ABI2 (FIG-REF). Further deletions narrowed the SOS2 interaction domain of ABI2 to a 46-aa region (amino acids 148–193) (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] The abi2-1 Mutant Protein Cannot Interact with SOS2. The PKI domain of ABI2 is conserved among ABI1, ABI2, and other protein phosphatase 2Cs from Arabidopsis (FIG-REF). Several amino acid residues in this region are known to be important for the function of ABI1 and ABI2. In the dominant abi2-1 mutant of Arabidopsis, Gly-168 is substituted by an aspartic acid residue (CITATION, CITATION). Substitution of amino acid Gly-174 of ABI1 by aspartic acid, which corresponds to Gly-162 of ABI2, abolishes the ability of ABI1 to block ABA-inducible transcription in maize protoplasts (CITATION). A recessive mutation (R1) in the abi2-1 mutant background, which converts Glu-186 to lysine, suppresses the ABI phenotype of the abi2-1 mutant (CITATION). To determine whether these mutations might affect the interaction of ABI2 with SOS2, these mutations (G162D, G168D, and E186K) were introduced into the ABI2 prey construct, and the interaction of the resultant ABI2 mutant proteins with SOS2 was evaluated by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Either of the G162D and G168D mutations in ABI2 abolished the interaction with SOS2 (FIG-REF). However, the E186K mutation in ABI2 did not prevent the interaction with SOS2 (FIG-REF). These results further confirmed that some of the amino acid residues in the SOS2 interaction domain (amino acids 148–193) are important for ABI2 to interact with SOS2. [[FIGURE]] Amino Acid Substitutions in ABI1 That Increase Its Interaction with SOS2. The minimal SOS2 interaction domain of ABI2 is highly conserved in ABI1. In particular, amino acid residues 158–193 of ABI2 are almost identical to those of ABI1 except that the Thr-197 and Val-201 in ABI2 are replaced by Ala in ABI1 (FIG-REF). Despite this highly conserved sequence, ABI1 interacts only weakly with SOS2 (Figs. FIG-REF and FIG-REF). To test whether the two divergent amino acid residues (Thr-197 and Val-201 in ABI2) contribute to the specificity of the interaction with SOS2, we introduced targeted mutations that convert the amino acid residues of ABI1 into those of ABI2. Single amino acid substitutions in ABI1 (A197T and A201V) did not result in stronger interactions with SOS2 (FIG-REF). However, a double amino acid substitution in ABI1 (A197TA201V) conferred a stronger interaction with SOS2 (FIG-REF). These results suggest that the two divergent amino acid residues are important for SOS2 to distinguish ABI2 from ABI1. The abi2-1 Mutant Is Tolerant to Salt Shock. The protein kinase SOS2 is a positive regulator of salt tolerance, and sos2 mutants are hypersensitive to salt stress (CITATION). To begin to determine the in vivo role of ABI2 in the SOS regulatory pathway for salt tolerance, we examined the salt tolerance of the abi1-1 and abi2-1 mutants (FIG-REF). WT, abi1-1, and abi2-1 plants were germinated and grown on normal MS agar medium without NaCl for 5 days and then transferred onto MS agar medium either with or without supplementation of 150 mM NaCl. Without NaCl supplementation, the abi1-1 and abi2-1 mutants grew as well as the WT. However, in the presence of 150 mM NaCl for 6 days, the WT seedlings were killed, whereas the abi1-1 and abi2-1 plants were still alive. Therefore, the abi1-1 and abi2-1 mutants are more tolerant to salt shock than the WT plants. This result suggests that ABI2 is involved in salt tolerance in vivo. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Construction of Plasmids. Plasmids pAS-SOS2 and pAS-SOS2N were described by Halfter et al. (CITATION) and Guo et al. (CITATION), respectively. Plasmids pAS-SOS1, pACT2-ABI1, pact-ABI2, and pASPKS3 were constructed previously (CITATION). Plasmids containing the C-terminal portions of SOS2 cDNA (pAS-SOS2-T1 and pASSOS2-T3) were constructed by moving the NcoI and BamHI fragments from pACT-SOS2-T1 and pACT-SOS2-T3 (CITATION) into the pAS2 vector. Full-length cDNAs for PKS11, PKS18, and PKS24 were amplified by PCR using specific primers and inserted into the pAS2 vector to make pAS-PKS11, pAS-PKS18, and pAS-PKS24. The pACT2-SOS3 plasmid was made by moving a SmaI and an EcoRI fragment from pGEX-SOS3 (CITATION) to pACT2. To make pAS-SOS2 and pAS-PKS3 deletion constructs [pASSOS2 (333/385), pAS-SOS2 (333/369), pAS-SOS2 (386/446), and pAS-PKS3 (327/371)], PCR was performed with pairs of forward primers (containing an NcoI site) and reverse primers (containing a BamHI site). The resulting PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pAS2. Deletion constructs of pACT-ABI2 (1/224, 1/111, 112/224, 225/423, 112/147, and 148/193) were made by PCR amplification using specific primers and inserting the DNA fragments into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pACT2. Inverse PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on double-stranded plasmid DNA with high-fidelity Taq polymerase by using the following primers: 5′-AGAAACAGCAGCGGTTTGCCTTTTAAC-3′ and 5′-CGAAGGGAACCTAGTGAG-3′ for pAS-SOS2 (R340A/F341A); 5′-TTGTGATAAGGTAATCATC-3′ and 5′-GGCTTAAATGACTCTGCAC-3′ for pAS-SOS2 (L324D); 5′-GCCATCGTAAACATCAAAG-3′ and 5′-CATGGCGGTTCTCAGG-3′ for pACT-ABI2 (G162D); 5′-GCCATCGTAAACACCAAAG-3′ and 5′-CATGACGGTTCTCAGG-3′ for pACT-ABI2 (G168D); 5′-CTCCTTCGTCAAAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTGAAGGAGAAACCG-3′ for pACT-ABI2 (E186K); 5′-CTCCGTCAAAGCCAAATG-3′ and 5′-GAGATAGCTA AGGAGA A AC-3′ for pACT-A BI1 (A197T); 5′-CTCCGCCA A AGCCA A ATG-3′ and 5′-GAGATAGTTAAGGAGAAAC-3′ for pACT-ABI1 (A201V); and 5′-CTCCGTCAAAGCCAAATG-3′ and 5′-GAGATAGTTAAGGAGAAAC-3′ for pACT-ABI1 (A197TA201V). The resulting PCR products were digested with DpnI and purified by gel electrophoresis, followed by self-ligation. The ligated products were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a cells. All plasmid constructs were completely sequenced to ensure that there were no PCR or cloning errors. Yeast Two-Hybrid Screen and Interaction Assays. The SOS2 coding region was amplified by PCR with primers containing restriction sites and cloned in-frame between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pAS2 to make the bait plasmid pAS-SOS2. The screening of pACT plasmid library (CITATION) was performed as described (CITATION). Plasmid DNA of bait and prey constructs were transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190. The transformants were grown overnight at 30°C in synthetic complete (SC) media lacking tryptophan, uracil, and leucine. Twenty microliters of the cell suspension containing ≈4 × 104 cells was dropped onto SC agar plates lacking tryptophan, uracil, and leucine, and the cells were grown for 2 days at 30°C. After colonies were transferred onto a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (NT, BioTrace, 0.45 mm; Gelman), β-galactosidase (β-gal) filter assays were carried out as described (CITATION). In Vitro Protein Binding Assays. To produce E. coli-expressed GST-ABI2, the coding region of ABI2 was cloned in-frame into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. The resulting construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 cells to obtain the GST-ABI2 fusion protein. The 37-aa PPI sequence of SOS2 was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK to produce the GST-PPI fusion protein. Radiolabeled ABI2 and SOS2 were produced from pET14b-ABI2 and pET14b-SOS2, respectively, using an in vitro transcription and translation assay kit (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega) with [35S]methionine as the sole source of methionine, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro protein affinity pull-down assays were carried out as described (CITATION). Plant Growth and Salt Treatments. Seeds of WT and mutants were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing 1.2% (wt/vol) agar and 3% sucrose. The seeds were stratified at 4°C for 3 days and then transferred to 22°C under continuous light for germination and growth. Five days after germination, seedlings of WT and mutants were transferred onto either MS agar plates or MS agar plates containing 150 mM NaCl for salt shock treatments.
