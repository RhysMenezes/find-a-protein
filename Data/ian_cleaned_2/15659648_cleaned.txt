!~ABS~! In most higher eukaryotes, the predominantly phosphoprotein-binding 14-3-3 proteins are the products of a multigene family, with many organisms having 10 or more family members. However, current models for 14-3-3/phosphopeptide interactions suggest that there is little specificity among 14-3-3s for diverse phosphopeptide clients. Therefore, the existence of sequence diversity among 14-3-3s within a single organism begs questions regarding the in vivo specificities of the interactions between the various 14-3-3s and their clients. Chief among those questions is, Do the different 14-3-3 isoforms interact with different clients within the same cell? Although the members of the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family of proteins typically contain highly conserved regions of sequence, they also display distinctive variability with deep evolutionary roots. In the current study, a survey of several Arabidopsis 14-3-3/GFP fusions revealed that 14-3-3s demonstrate distinct and differential patterns of subcellular distribution, by using trichomes and stomate guard cells as in vivo experimental cellular contexts. The effects of client interaction on 14-3-3 localization were further analyzed by disrupting the partnering with peptide and chemical agents. Results indicate that 14-3-3 localization is both isoform specific and highly dependent upon interaction with cellular clients.
!~RES~! Native gel electrophoresis was used to survey the expression, size, and dimerization status of the 14-3-3/GFP fusions within plants transformed with the fusions. Native protein extracts from the leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the 14-3-3/GFP fusions were subjected to native pore gradient gel electrophoresis. The green fluorescence image of the resulting gel is shown in Figure 1. Comparison of the GFP fusion leaf extracts (lanes 1–4) with flanking molecular weight markers indicates that the all four 14-3-3/GFP fusions produced singlet major bands in the range of 130 kDa and a small family of bands in the general range of 90–100 kDa. Extracts from plants expressing GFP alone produce a band of ∼50 kDa. These data indicate that the GFP signal present in the transgenic 14-3-3/GFP fusion plants is a sole and direct result of GFP that is fused to 14-3-3 with little or no cleavage of the GFP signal away from the fusion protein. [[FIGURE]] In all 14-3-3 fusion extracts, the GFP signal is in protein complexes that are in molecular weight multiples that are consistent with 14-3-3 homodimers and heterodimers, but not with 14-3-3/GFP monomers. The bands near 150 kDa in the 14-3-3/GFP fusion lanes are consistent with predicted molecular weights of 14-3-3/GFP homodimers, whereas the bands in the 90- to 100-kDa range are consistent with the predicted sizes of 14-3-3/GFP fusions heterodimerized with endogenous 14-3-3 protein. Monomer fusions of 14-3-3s to GFP should be in the range of 50–60 kDa, and no bands were observed at this molecular weight in any of the lanes containing extracts from the 14-3-3/GFP fusion. The slight variations in apparent size among the 14-3-3/GFP fusions are consistent the different predicted masses of the various isoforms. λ is the smallest of the isoforms, with a predicted molecular weight of 27.9 kDa, followed by κ at 28.0, ω at 29.1, and ϕ at 30.2 kDa. These data indicate that the GFP signal observed in the leaves of the 14-3-3/GFP fusion plants is, in general, derived from 14-3-3/GFP fusion proteins that are present in a state that is consistent with native properly folded 14-3-3 proteins, in both homodimeric and heterodimeric states. The expression levels of the transgenic lines are similar when the overall signal of bands on the gel are used as an estimate of the amount of fusion protein produced. In addition, Western analysis of the extracts with representative isoforms indicates that the 14-3-3/GFP fusions are produced at levels that approximate typical 14-3-3 expression (our unpublished data). The 14-3-3/GFP isoforms demonstrated differential subcellular localization in trichomes. Trichomes proved to be excellent cell types for examination of subcellular localization of the 14-3-3/GFP isoforms, providing clear distinction among nuclear and other locations within a prominent cellular morphology and without potentially competing chlorophyll fluorescence. The 14-3-3-λ/GFP and 14-3-3-κ/GFP fusions demonstrated a predominantly nuclear localization (Figure 2, a and b), whereas the 14-3-3-ω/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP fusions were much more widely distributed within both cytoplasmic and nuclear locations within the trichomes (Figure 2, c and d). In both 14-3-3-ω/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP, the fusion protein was seen associated with components of the trichome cytoskeleton (Figure 2, c and d) as well as the nucleus. GFP expressed without fusion to 14-3-3 showed a generalized subcellular distribution in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Figure 2e). In addition to the differences in gross subcellular localization demonstrated by 14-3-3-λ/GFP and 14-3-3-κ/GFP versus 14-3-3-ω/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP, each isoform also displayed individual differences in localization within the nucleus. 14-3-3-κ/GFP was fairly concentrated within the nucleolus (Figure 2f), whereas 14-3-3-λ/GFP was less prominent in the nucleolus than in the surrounding nuclear material (Figure 2g). The 14-3-3-ω/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP fusions were more uniformly distributed within the nucleus, showing no apparent affinity for or exclusion from the nucleolus (Figure 2, h and i). Differences in the subcytoplasmic localization between 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP and 14-3-3-ω/GFP were subtle but apparent. 14-3-3-ω/GFP seemed to be consistently more widely expressed throughout the cytoplasm and cell membrane than 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP, which demonstrated a more limited and punctate distribution. Subcellular localization of 14-3-3/GFP fusions was dependent upon cell type. Guard cells demonstrated distinctive subcellular localization among the 14-3-3/GFP fusions, but those localizations were not necessarily the same as those observed in trichomes. 14-3-3-κ/GFP was again decidedly nuclear in localization within guard cells (Figure 2k), whereas 14-3-3-λ/GFP localization seemed to be absent from the nucleus and limited to the peripheral guard cell edges in contact with the stomatal pore (Figure 2l). The distributions of 14-3-3-ω/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP were similar to each other, although distinctly different from the distributions of either 14-3-3-κ/GFP or 14-3-3-λ/GFP. The subcellular distribution of 14-3-3/GFP in trichomes is consistent among trichomes and leaves. Figure 3, a and b, provides a field view of 14-3-3-κ/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP plants to show the number of trichome cells available for analysis on typical leaves. Figure 3, c and d, present a closer view of leaves showing the subcellular distribution in eight to 10 trichomes scattered across the leaf surface. Figure 3e provides a relative quantification of the distribution of the GFP signal in 14-3-3-κ/GFP and 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP. On the average, 14-3-3-κ/GFP signal in the nucleus comprises ∼35% of the total signal in the trichome body. In 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP trichomes, nuclear signal comprises ∼18% of the total signal in the trichome body. In all cases, the distribution of the 14-3-3/GFP fusion was the result of dynamic processes and proteins in differential motion within the cells. Figure 4 displays a subset of still images from a movie that can be found online as supplemental material (Supplemental Figure S1). These frames illustrate the dynamic movement of ϕ/GFP along the cytoskeletal network in trichomes. [[FIGURE]] AICAR is a 5′ AMP analog that is known to disrupt the biochemical and biological influence of 14-3-3s upon their target clients (CITATION). AICAR is useful in an in vivo experimental environment because it can penetrate plant cell walls and membranes while retaining its activity as a 5′ AMP mimetic. AICAR treatment of leaves resulted in a dramatic alteration in the subcellular localization of 14-3-3-κ/GFP and 14-3-3-λ/GFP fusions within trichomes. Figure 5 displays trichomes from the AICAR treatments of leaves. The top panel shows trichomes photographed before treatment with AICAR (Figure 5, a–e), and the bottom panel shows trichomes after 2-h incubation in AICAR. Where possible, the same trichome was photographed before and after treatment. (The reapplication of the slide after treatment made it difficult to use the same cell for before and after photography, but occasionally the same cell was identified, as in Figure 5, c, d, h, and i.). Instead of the characteristic nuclear localization of 14-3-3-κ/GFP and 14-3-3-λ/GFP, AIRCAR treatment resulted in GFP signal widely and diffusely spread throughout the distal portions of the trichome, with no indication of nuclear localization (Figure 5, f and g). AICAR treatment of leaves also disrupted the 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP localization within trichomes, resulting in distinctively globular regions of fluorescence (Figure 5i) that were nonnuclear but still mobile within the cell (our unpublished data). Similar AICAR treatment had no apparent effect on nonfusion GFP (Figure 5, e and j). Treatment with AICAR had little overt effect on the distribution of 14-3-3-ω/GFP (Figure 5, c and h); however, a close inspection of the cells after treatment revealed that the dynamic motion of the fusion proteins characteristic of these cells is greatly diminished in the presence of AICAR (our unpublished data). The R18 peptide is a very high-affinity 14-3-3 target, having a higher affinity for 14-3-3 binding than any known target (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, it can act as an antagonist of client binding and is expected to outcompete any native protein to disrupt the partnering of the 14-3-3s with their targets. Figure 6 illustrates the effects of incubating excised leaf sections with R18. The top panel of Figure 6 (Figure 6, a–e) shows trichomes photographed before treatment, and the middle panel (Figure 6, f–j) shows trichomes photographed after 3–3.5 h of incubation with R18. The bottom panel (Figure 6, k–p) demonstrates the effect on GFP signal distribution by using an unrelated peptide that does not have an affinity for 14-3-3 binding. Treatment with R18 peptide had a dramatic effect on the distributions of all 14-3-3/GFP fusions. The 14-3-3-κ/GFP and 14-3-3-λ/GFP distributions changed from their characteristic nuclear predominance (Figures 5b and 6a) to a generalized and diffuse distribution (Figures 5g and 6f) similar to that seen with AICAR. The 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP fusion similarly lost its native localization, becoming distributed in globules similar but not identical to those seen with AICAR treatment of 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP. In contrast to treatment with AICAR, the 14-3-3-ω/GFP distribution was clearly affected by treatment with R18 peptide, losing its characteristic cellular specific localization (Figure 6c) and becoming very diffusely distributed throughout the trichome (Figure 6h). Similar experimental treatment of leaves with R18 peptide had no influence on the localization of GFP alone (Figure 6, e and j). In addition, similar experimental incubation with a nonrelated peptide had no influence on the distribution of GFP signal in any of the 14-3-3/GFP fusions or on GFP itself (Figure 6, k–p). Figure 7 displays an extended time course of the treatment of 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP with R18 (also see Figure 6, d and i). These sequential images of the same trichome illustrate the progressive nature of the effect that incubation with R18 has on the distribution of the 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP fusions in 30-min intervals.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis plants (Arabidopsis thaliana `Wassilewskija') were transformed through vacuum infiltration (CITATION) with fusion proteins composed of the coding region of various 14-3-3 isoforms coupled to GFP (S65T) and driven by the CaMV35s promoter (CITATION). The isoforms investigated include κ, λ, ω, and ϕ. Between four and six plant lines of each transformant were screened by visual inspection before selecting a single line for each isoform for subsequent analyses. Although there are some differences in the intensity of expression among lines, the patterns of subcellular distribution of 14-3-3 isoform/GFP expression are consistent among lines. In addition, a positive control consisting of CaMV35s/GFP alone was used for comparison. Plants were grown horizontally in plates on nutrient agar (CITATION) and were typically 2 weeks old when they were used for analyses. Plants were examined with an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope coupled to an Evolution MP cooled charge-coupled device camera with Q-capture 2.60 software (Quantitative Imaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). For trichomes, photos were taken through the 20× objective and captured with no binning. The specific region of interest was subsequently cropped from the resulting large (14.2-MB) digital file. Images of nuclei and guard cells were similarly completed using the 40× objective. Slide samples were prepared in water or phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (PBS-T) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4 plus 0.1% Tween), depending on the application. For Figures 2 and 3, leaves were cut from the living plants just before mounting on the slide in water. For Figures 5, 6, 7, the slides were prepared for the in situ incubation of leaf sections on the slide with biochemical reagents or were prepared with excised leaves that had been incubated in a given reagent for 1–4 h in a separate Microfuge tube (below). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Digital images (TIF format) of single trichomes were opened in Bio-Rad's Quantity One program, and the Volume Tools software was used to establish relative amounts of GFP signal within sections of the trichome image. The pixel volume integration of the nuclear region alone was divided by total pixel volume integration of an area within the body of the trichome to find the proportion of the signal that resides in the nucleus. Because portions of the trichome exit the focal plane, this calculation does not represent percentage of nuclear 14-3-3/GFP in any strict sense (CITATION), but it does represent a comparison of relative nuclear localization within the body of the trichome. Five trichomes from 14-3-3-κ/GFP plants and five from 14-3-3-ϕ/GFP plants were used in the analysis. The values for each isoform are presented in Figure 3e as averages with standard deviations indicated as error bars. In all cases, the plant material was prepared fresh (as described above) and either treated in situ on a microscope slide or incubated in the given solution in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide Ribonucleoside Monophosphate (AICAR). Leaves were excised from the plant, the midvein was removed with a scalpel, and the leaf sections were placed on slides flooded with 10 mM AICAR in water. Trichomes were photographed at ∼1-h intervals (CITATION). Peptide Competition. Leaves were excised from the plant, the midvein was removed with a scalpel, and the leaf sections were incubated in Microfuge tubes containing either the peptide R18 (R18 peptide, PHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP) (CITATION) or a peptide composed of the carboxyl-terminal region of 14-3-3 ν (UpC peptide, CPKEVQKVDEQAQPPPSQ) (CITATION). Both peptides used at a concentration of 4 μg/ml in PBS-T. As with the AICAR treatments, trichomes were photographed at ∼1-h intervals. Leaves incubated in PBS-T alone were indistinguishable with those incubated in water (our unpublished data). Leaves from 2-wk-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the 14-3-3/GFP fusions were extracted in 1× native sample buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8) in ice at a ratio of 100 μl of buffer for every 200 mg of leaf tissue. A motor-driven homogenizer was used to grind the tissue into a slurry in a Microfuge tube, and then the slurry was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C to remove debris. Extracts were resolved with nondenaturing acrylamide electrophoresis (CITATION) with the modification that the gel was prepared with a pore gradient (5–15% acrylamide). The resultant gel was scanned on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX at 488 nm and rendered into a digital image with the Bio-Rad FX software.
