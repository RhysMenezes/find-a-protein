!~ABS~! The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multifunctional protein complex essential for arabidopsis development. One of its functions is to promote Rub1/Nedd8 deconjugation from the cullin subunit of the Skp1-cullin-F-box ubiquitin ligase. Little is known about the specific role of its eight subunits in deneddylation or any of the physiological functions of CSN. In the absence of CSN1 (thefus6 mutant), arabidopsis CSN complex cannot assemble, which destabilizes multiple CSN subunits and contributes, together with the loss of CSN1, to the phenotype of fus6. To distinguish CSN1-specific functions, we attempted to rescue the complex formation with deletion or point-mutation forms of CSN1 expressed as transgenes in fus6. We show that the central domain of CSN1 is critical for complex assembly, whereas the C-terminal domain has a supporting role. By expressing the C231 fragment, which contains the structural information but lacks the presumed functional domain located at the N terminus, we have rescued the complex formation and restored the Rub1/Nedd8 deconjugation activity on cullins (fus6/C231). Nonetheless, fus6/C231exhibits pleiotropic phenotype, including photomorphogenic defects and growth arrest at seedling stage. We conclude that CSN1 N-terminal domain is not required for the Rub1/Nedd8 deconjugation activity of cullins, but contributes to a significant aspect of CSN functions that are essential for plant development.
!~RES~! We first reevaluated the structural role of CSN1 in more detail by examining the size fractionation profiles of additional CSN subunits infus6 (fus6-1, when not specified). Thefus6 mutant still contains CSN5, CSN7, and a few other CSNs (CITATION; CITATION; our unpublished data), although, with the exception of CSN5 (CITATION), it is not known whether these subunits exist as complex-associated form or as monomers. We examined the gel filtration profiles of CSN4, CSN5, CSN7, and CSN8 in the crude extract of fus6 by immunoblots. Whereas the wild-type extract contains all four subunits in the fractions corresponding to CSN complex of ∼500 kDa (Figure 1, marked by asterisks), the fus6 mutant lacks this 500-kDa peak for all of the subunits examined. Instead, most of CSN4 and CSN7 are in the fractions of 250–300 kDa, and a small portion is in the fraction corresponding to the monomeric size (Figure 1). CSN7 shows as two bands that may correspond to the 33- and 30-kDa forms (CITATION), with the 30-kDa form being stronger infus6. We also noted that the amounts of total CSN4 and CSN7 are markedly reduced compared with their levels in wild-type extract (our unpublished data). As previously reported for fus6, CSN5 accumulates only in the free forms and the intact CSN8 is missing (Figure 1; CITATION; CITATION;CITATION). This result further illustrates the fact that CSN1 has an indispensable role in the formation of intact CSN complex.[[FIGURE]] Multiple EMS-mutagenized alleles of fus6 mutants have been isolated (CITATION). Similar to thefus6-1 null mutant, all of these mutants are lethal and lack the intact CSN (our unpublished data). We set out to determine the molecular lesions in these mutants because it may provide us information about the structural and functional constrains on CSN1. The result is summarized in Figure 2. Thefus6-T379 mutation results in a stop-codon upstream in the coding region, which likely knock outs the production of CSN1. Mutations in fus6-G236 and fus6-T414 both caused frame shifts in the PCI domain, which would delete the C-terminal 165 aa residues.[[FIGURE]] Interestingly, the fus6-T236 mutant results in a missense mutation from glycine to arginine at aa 222. This glycine residue is conserved among CSN1 orthologs from plant, human, and fission yeast (CITATION). In addition, the G222R mutation is near the start of the PCI domain and falls into the corresponding region required for interaction with CSN2 and CSN4 in an hCSN1 study (CITATION). We suspected that the fus6-T236mutation (G222R) might affect its binding to CSN2 and CSN4, and jeopardize its capacity to support complex assembly. To test this hypothesis, we made the identical mutation in the CSN1 yeast two-hybrid constructs (G222R), and assayed its interaction with CSN2 and CSN4 in yeast. Like hCSN1, arabidopsis CSN1 was also found to interact with CSN2 and CSN4 (Figure 3), although the interaction with CSN4 was detected only with AD-CSN4 but not with lexA-CSN4 (CITATION; our unpublished data). In all cases, G222R failed to interact with these two subunits (Figure3A). As shown in Figure 3B, the G222R fusion proteins were expressed in yeast cells. These results showed that the G222R mutation abolished the binding of CSN1 with CSN2 and CSN4 in the yeast two-hybrid assay.[[FIGURE]] To confirm the consequence of G222R mutation on complex assembly in vivo and to further dissect the structure and function of CSN1 in the context of plant development, we made the following CSN1 mutant constructs for plant transformation. As depicted in Figure4, the deletion mutant N270 (aa 1–270) contains the N-terminal and the central domain, including that (aa 161–268) corresponding to a complete CSN4 binding site for hCSN1 (CITATION). This fragment is largely equivalent to the presumed CSN1 product in fus6-G236/T414. The C231 mutant (aa 211–441) contains the central and the C-terminal regions but lacks the N terminus. The N210 construct (aa 1–210) contains just the N terminus of CSN1. The G222R construct contains the identical point mutation as in fus6-T236. As a control, full-length CSN1 (FS1) was subcloned into the same vector. All of the constructs are under the 35S promoter (CITATION). We use the TRANSGENE-NAMES to represent the transgenic lines that are in wild-type (FUS6+/+) or FUS6+/− backgrounds, and usefus6/TRANSGENE-NAME to refer to those transgenic plants that are in fus6 −/− background.[[FIGURE]] All of the 16 transgenic lines of N210 as well as 30 lines of G222R examined failed to rescue the fus6 mutant phenotype (Figure4, right), nor did they display any new phenotypes in wild-type or mutant backgrounds. The FS1, N270, and C231 transgenes, on the other hand, completely or partially rescued the mutant (Figure5). Under the light conditions (Figure5A) or in complete darkness (Figure 5B), fus6/N270 andfus6/FS1 seedlings look indistinguishable from the wild-type seedlings.[[FIGURE]] Unlike FS1 and N270, C231 is unable to fully rescue fus6, and it confers, instead, a phenotype that is distinct from regularfus6. A characteristic feature of the fus6/C231plants is closed cotyledons under both dark (Figure 5C) and light (Figure 5D) conditions, in contrast to the constitutively open-cotyledon phenotype of fus6 (CITATION; Figure 5, C and D). Additionally, fus6/C231 displays light-dependent cotyledon enlargement, resulting in a larger seedling size compared with fus6 when grown under the light (Figure5D). In this sense, C231 partially rescued the fus6 seedling phenotype. However, fus6/C231 resembles fus6 in hypocotyl shortening (only slightly longer than fus6) and in developmental arrest at seedling stage. After prolonged growth period,fus6/C231 eventually senesces with a terminal morphology of enlarged but closed cotyledons and, intriguingly, a highly pigmented shoot apex that is unable to produce true leaves (Figure 5E). It is important to point out that the fus6/C231 phenotype is exclusively associated with the fus6 mutant background. The C231 transgenic plants in wild-type or FUS6 heterozygous backgrounds do not display obvious abnormalities. The failure of N210 and G222R transgenic lines in the complementation test prompted us to examine the expression of the transgenes. Northern blot analysis (Figure6A) from representative transgenic lines showed that all of the transgenes, including C231, are overexpressed to different extents at the mRNA level compared with the endogenousCSN1 mRNA, the amount of which was too low to be detected in this experiment. Nonetheless, as shown in the immunoblot of representative FS1 lines (Figure 6B), the protein products were not overproduced compared with the endogenous CSN1 in wild-type seedlings.[[FIGURE]] Despite of the mRNA overexpression, the N210 protein product could not be found in any of the transgenic seedlings of either wild-type or mutant backgrounds (Figure 6C). As expected, the accumulation of CSN8, which is an indicator for the formation of the complex, was not rescued in the fus6/N210 mutants (Figure 6C). Clearly, either N210 was not translated and/or it was rapidly degraded. This result is consistent with a CSN1 model (CITATION), according to which N210 lacks the domain necessary for integration of the subunit into the complex. The G222R transgene product was barely detected (Figure 6D). Moreover, intact CSN8 was not found (Figure 6D), suggesting that the complex could not form. Thus, the G222R point mutation, which disrupts the interaction of CSN1 with other subunits, simultaneously abolished complex formation, protein accumulation, and therefore ability to rescue the mutant. The transgene products of the N270 and C231were readily detected (Figure 6E). More significantly, in the absence of endogenous CSN1, accumulation of CSN8 was rescued in fus6/N270,fus6/C231, fus6/FS1 seedlings (Figure 6, B and E), hinting at the formation of the CSN complex in these mutants. As expected from complete rescue of the mutant phenotype, the gel filtration profile of CSN in FS1, fus6/FS1, N270, andfus6/N270 seedlings (our unpublished data) are much alike that of the wild-type seedlings (Figure 1). In light of the lethal phenotype of fus6/C231, we were particularly interested to know whether C231 can rescue the complex formation. Size fractionation of fus6/C231 seedlings showed clear restoration of the CSN complex, because all subunits examined cofractionated in the peak of ∼500 kDa (Figure 6F). We refer to the CSN complexes formed in the fus6/N270 andfus6/C231 mutants as CSNS1-N270 and CSNS1-C231 complexes, respectively, to recognize the fact that these complexes contain the truncated CSN1 instead of wild-type CSN1. We noted that N270 and C231 proteins are not overproduced compared with the level of wild-type CSN1 (Figure 6E). This correlates with the observation that both proteins do not appear to accumulate outside of the CSN complex (Figure 6F; our unpublished data). Together, these results argue that the phenotypes offus6/C231 most likely reflect the loss-of-function defects of CSNS1-C231 complexes as opposed to a dominant negative or dominant gain-of-function phenotype. Because N270 and C231 fragments overlap at the central region of CSN1, the findings that both of these transgenes are capable, and that G222R is incapable, of supporting complex assembly underscore the importance of the central region of CSN1 in complex assembly. We further characterized the transgenic seedlings with regard to the newly discovered Rub1/Nedd8 deconjugation activity and the gene expression pattern related to photomorphogenesis. A small fraction of arabidopsis Cul1 (AtCul1) can be found as Rub1-modified form in seedlings (CITATION). In CSN mutants such as cop9 (CSN8 mutant), however, AtCul1 accumulates nearly completely in the Rub1-modified form (CITATION). This is because the CSN-mediated Rub1/Nedd8 deconjugation activity is missing in the CSN mutants (CITATION). To determine whether this activity can be rescued by the transgenes, we examined the AtCul1 modification pattern by immunoblot (Figure 7A). Like the cop9 mutant, AtCul1 accumulates only as Rub1-modified form in fus6. Notably, all of the transgenes, including C231 completely rescued this defect, because AtCul1 predominantly accumulates in the unmodified form in fus6/FS1,fus6/N270, and fus6/C231, similar to the wild type (Figure 7A). This result shows that CSNS1-N270 and CSNS1-C231complexes are functional with regard to the Rub1/Nedd8 deconjugation activity on AtCul1.[[FIGURE]] Because CSN has been implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we examined the cellular level of two well-established molecules, HY5 and phytochrome A (PhyA), both of which undergo proteolysis through the 26S proteasome in a light signal-dependent manner. Degradation of the transcription factor HY5 occurs in the dark of wild-type seedlings but not in the cop/det/fus mutants, including a CSN mutant,cop8-1 (mutant of CSN4 subunit) (CITATION). As predicted, fus6 also exhibit HY5 accumulation in the dark (Figure 7B). fus6/FS1 andfus6/N270 completely and fus6/C231 partially rescued the light regulation of HY5 (Figure 7B, top). In contrast to HY5, photoreceptor PhyA is stabilized in the dark and is rapidly degraded once exposed to light (CITATION). We found that degradation of PhyA is not defective in fus6 or any of the transgenic mutant seedlings. In fact, PhyA protein in the dark appears more abundant in the fus6 and fus6/C231mutants (Figure 7B). Thus, our data show that fus6 is unable to degrade HY5 in the dark but is capable to degrade PhyA in the light, suggesting that modulation of the proteasome-mediated degradation by CSN is substrate specific and/or light condition dependent. We next examined whether N270 and C231 can rescue the gene expression defects of fus6. The expression of CHS gene can be induced by light, especially UV light, and by environmental stresses (CITATION; CITATION). Clearly, N270 and FS1 but not C231 transgenes can rescue theCHS hyperexpression of fus6 (Figure 7B). In addition, CSN mutants are characterized by light-independent expression of normally light-induced genes such as CAB (CITATION; CITATION). Again,fus6/FS1 and fus6/N270 resembles wild type, whereas fus6/C231 resembles fus6, in the pattern of CAB gene expression (Figure 7). We conclude from these results that N270, but not C231, can rescue the gene expression defect of fus6.
!~MM~! The fus6-1 mutation (Wassilewskija ecotype) was caused by a T-DNA insert that carries a kanamycin-resistant marker (CITATION). This mutant allele is a null fus6mutant and has been used in combination with all of the transgenes in this study. When not specified, we use fus6 to indicatefus6-1 allele throughout the text. Correspondingly, the wild-type plants used in this study were of the Wassilewskija ecotype. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized, washed, and plated on a dish containing growth medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 1% sucrose. The seeds were vernalized by incubating at 4°C for 3–8 d and placed in a standard long-day growth chamber at 22°C (CITATION) for periods as specified. Total RNA from seedlings of the fus6-T236, fus6-T379, fus6-T414, fus6-G236 mutants (CITATION) were extracted using TRIzol RNA Purification kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mutant CSN1 cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with 1–2 μg of mutant total RNA, 1 μg/ml specific primer sets: the reverse primer COP11R (5′-GCAGGTCGAC AGTTTAGCAA ACGAGATGTC ATCAAAC-3′) and the forward primer COP11US (5′-TCGACTCGAG TCTAGACCCG GGGGATCCGG ATCCATGGAG CGAGACGAAG AAGCGGGTGG ACC-3′). The Omniscript RT kit and HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) were used. TheBamHI-SalI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was subcloned into Bluescript KS vector. Multiple Bluescript clones of each mutant allele were sequenced, and the region that contains the mutation was further confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. The CSN1 constructs were subcloned into the pPZPY122 transformation that has a gentamicin-resistant marker and contains a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter to drive the expression of the transgene (CITATION). The FS1 (full-length CSN1) construct was generated by PCR amplification from pCRII-FUS6 (CITATION) by using the forward primer COP11–5NFL (5′-CATGCCATGG ATCCACATAT GGACTACAAA GACGATGACG ATAAAGCAGA GCTCCATATG GAGCGAGACG AAG-3′), which contains the sequence for one copy of flag epitope tag, and the reverse primer COP11R (5′-GCAGGTCGAC AGTTTAGCAA ACGAGAT-CTC ATCAAAG-3′). The C231 fragment was PCR amplified by using the forward primer COP11-A2 (5′-CCTGGATCCT ATGGTTAATG CAAAACTGCG-3′) and the T7 primer. The N210 fragment was amplified using the forward primer COP11–5NFL and the reverse primer COP11-A3DS (5′-CATGCCATGG TACCGTCGAC AGGTTCAAGG GTTTCAGG-3′). The Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used, and the PCR products for FS1 and N210 were first cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After confirmation of the sequences, the BamHI-SalI fragments were subcloned into pPZPY122. For N270 construct, the 5′ fragment between EcoRI (5′-cloning site) and the HindIII sites of pCRII-FUS6 was first subcloned into a Bluescript vector. ThenBamHI-SalI fragment from this plasmid was subcloned into pPZPY122. The G222R construct was made by replacing the FS1 SacI-HindII fragment with the corresponding fragment from pBS-T236, which contains and CSN1 mutant cDNA from fus6-T236 as described in above. FS1, N210, and G222R, but not N270 and C231, constructs contain a Flag epitope tag translationally fused at the amino terminus. For stable transformation, the DNA constructs were electroporated into the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (pMP90). Arabidopsis transformation was performed by floral dip method (CITATION). The FS1, N210, and G222R constructs were directly introduced into FUS6 +/− heterozygous plants that were selected from plates containing kanamycin (100 μg/ml; Sigma). The N270 and C231 constructs were first introduced into wild-type plants and then crossed into fus6. Transgenic plants were selected with gentamicin (100 μg/ml; Sigma). The presence and the number of transgenic loci were determined by segregation of the resistant markers: gentamicin for the transgenes and kanamycin for the fus6-1 allele. CSN1, CSN2, CSN4, and G222R were fused at the amino terminus to Lex A-DNA binding domain in pEG202 and to a transcription activation domain in pJG4-5 (CITATION). The pEG202 constructs were transformed into the yeast strain EGY48, whereas the pJG4-5 constructs were transformed in the yeast strain L40. The resulting transformants were mated and the diploid strains carrying the different construct combinations as indicated were tested for β-galactosidase activity in the plate assay as shown. The liquid assay measuring the β-galactosidase activity (CITATION) was performed to confirm the results. Seedlings were ground in liquid N2 and extracted for RNA by using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). The RNA amount of 20 μg/lane was loaded and then transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for standard Northern hybridization in a buffer containing 5× Denhart's solution, 6 × SSC, and 0.5% SDS. The probes used for detecting chalcone synthase (CHS), chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB), and 18S rRNA (CITATION) were prepared by random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RNA probes used for detecting transgene expression were prepared using MAXIscript T7/T3 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The probes corresponding to the N210 fragment (5′ probe) and to the C231 fragment (3′ probe) were mixed in the hybridization. Seedlings were collected and ground in liquid N2. The procedure and the buffers for homogenization, gel filtration, and later analysis have been described (CITATION). A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was used for gel filtration, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected according to CITATION. The fractions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The antibodies against CSN1 (CITATION), CSN8 (CITATION), and HY5 (CITATION) were affinity purified. The antibodies against CSN4 (CITATION), CSN5 (CITATION), CSN7 (CITATION), Rpn6 (CITATION), and PhyA (CITATION) have been described. To produce antibodies against AtCul1, a fragment corresponding to amino acid 1–320 of AtCUL1 was PCR amplified by using the oligonucleotides CULATG 5′-GAATTCGAGC GCAAGACTAT TGAC-3′ and CULAA320 5′-CTCGAGACTT CCAGCAACCG TTTTG-3′ and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion in the vector pGEX-4T-1. Gel-eluted recombinant protein was used for production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. For direct immunoblot analysis of plant extract, tissues were homogenized in the extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, freshly added 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and Complete Protease-Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The extract was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min and the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In all cases where equal loading of the samples was required, the same samples or the blot was also probed with anti-Rpn6 to confirm the equal loading. Light-grown seedlings were used in all of the analyses when not specified.
