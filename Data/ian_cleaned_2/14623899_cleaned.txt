!~ABS~! Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 regulates insulin signaling, but the relevant phosphorylated residues and their potential functions during insulin-stimulated signal transduction are difficult to resolve. We used a sequence-specific polyclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser302 to study IRS-1-mediated signaling during insulin and insulin-like growth factor IGF-I stimulation. Insulin or IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of Ser302 in various cell backgrounds and in murine muscle. Wortmannin or rapamycin inhibited Ser302 phosphorylation, and amino acids or glucose stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation, suggesting a role for the mTOR cascade. The Ser302 kinase associates with IRS-1 during immunoprecipitation, but its identity is unknown. The NH2-terminal c-Jun kinase did not phosphorylate Ser302. Replacing Ser302 with alanine significantly reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and p85 binding and reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal S6 protein, and 4E-BP1; however, this mutation had no effect on insulin-stimulated Akt or glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylation. Replacing Ser302 with alanine reduced insulin/IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis. We conclude that Ser302 phosphorylation integrates nutrient availability with insulin/IGF-I signaling to promote mitogenesis and cell growth. 
!~RES~! Insulin/IGF-I Stimulates Ser302 Phosphorylation—To study serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, we raised sequence-specific polyclonal antibodies against 17-amino acid peptides containing putative serine phosphorylation sites in rat IRS-1. One of these antibodies was directed against pSer302 and designated α-pS302. The α-pS302 immunoblotted IRS-1 extracted from insulin or IGF-I-stimulated 32D/IRS-1 cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and CHOIR/IRS-1 cells. Platelet-derived growth factor had a weak effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and epidermal growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-α did not promote Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, a–c). Ser302 phosphorylation was detected 1 min after insulin stimulation of 32D/IRS-1 cells, reached a maximum within 30 min, but was barely detected after 2 h (Fig. 1d). Moreover, Ser302 was phosphorylated in IRS-1 isolated from muscles of insulin-stimulated mice, suggesting that Ser302 phosphorylation might be physiologically relevant (Fig. 1e).   [[FIGURE]] We conducted peptide competition and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to establish the specificity of the α-pS302. The phosphopeptide used to produce α-pS302 (Fig. 2, a and b) completely prevented immunoblotting of IRS-1 from insulin-stimulated 32D/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 2c). The unphosphorylated peptide at best weakly inhibited immunoblotting, suggesting that the phosphoserine residue was an important determinant of specificity (Fig. 2c). The α-pS302 did not immunoblot background proteins in the various cell extracts, did not immunoblot alkaline phosphatase-treated IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, and it did not immunoblot IRS-2, even though the corresponding serine residue (Ser343) is phosphorylated (data not shown). Replacing Ser302 with Ala in IRS-1 completely abolished immunoblotting by α-pS302 (Fig. 2d). Based upon these results, we conclude that α-pS302 is specific for IRS-1 phosphorylated on Ser302.   [[FIGURE]] Mutation of Ser302 to Ala Impairs Insulin Signaling—Serine phosphorylation is generally thought to inhibit IRS-1 function by decreasing insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation or promoting IRS-1 degradation through a proteasome-mediated degradation pathway (22). For example, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser307 in IRS-1 inhibits insulin signaling; replacing Ser307 with alanine increases insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling (15). To establish the effect of Ser302 on IRS-1 function, we generated 32D cells expressing wild type IRS-1 or a mutant IRS-1 protein containing an alanine substitution for Ser302 (A302IRS-1). Stable 32D cell clones expressing equal amounts of IRS-1 or A302IRS-1 were identified by immunoblotting. Insulin strongly stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine and Ser302 phosphorylation in 32D/IRS-1 cells, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced significantly in A302IRS-1 (Fig. 3, a and b). Consistent with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, A302IRS-1 associated weakly with p85 during insulin stimulation (Fig. 3c). We conclude that Ser302 promotes IRS-1 function during insulin stimulation.   [[FIGURE]] IRS-1 Signaling Is Regulated Differentially through Ser302— The IRS-1/PI3K cascade regulates various downstream signals during insulin/IGF-I stimulation, including the activation of Akt/GSK-3β, p70S6K/S6 and mTOR/4E-BP1 cascades. As shown previously, IRS-1 was required for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in 32D cells, which is consistent with the binding and activation of PI3K by IRS-1 during insulin stimulation (Fig. 4a). However, insulin stimulated normally Akt phosphorylation in 32D/A302IRS-1 cells, even though tyrosine phosphorylation of A302IRS-1 and p85 recruitment was significantly reduced during insulin stimulation (Fig. 4a). Akt phosphorylates GSK-3β on Ser9, which can be detected with a phosphospecific antibody (23). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β was stimulated equally by insulin in 32D/IRS-1 and 32D/A302IRS-1 cells, suggesting that replacing Ser302 with alanine did not impair IRS-1-mediated activation of the Akt/GSK-3β cascade during insulin stimulation (Fig. 4a).   [[FIGURE]] The activation of p70S6K was investigated during insulin stimulation by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody against pThr389. As shown previously, insulin failed to stimulate p70S6K phosphorylation in 32D cells, whereas it was strongly phosphorylated in 32D/IRS-1 cells, especially after 30 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 4b). The ribosomal protein S6 and the regulatory protein 4E-BP1 are substrates of p70S6K and mTOR, respectively, and both proteins were phosphorylated during insulin stimulation of 32D/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 4b). However, insulin weakly stimulated p70S6K phosphorylation in 32D/A302IRS-1 cells, and the phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 was barely detected (Fig. 4b). Thus, Ser302 was essential for the mTOR/p70S6K branch of the IRS-1 signaling cascade.  A Ser302 Kinase Associates with IRS-1—Specific association between a kinase and its substrates, followed by the recognition of phosphorylation sites by the associated kinase, determines the specificity of protein phosphorylation. To determine whether the Ser302 kinase associates with IRS-1, specific immunoprecipitates containing IRS-1 were incubated without or with 500 μm ATP. Before addition of ATP, Ser302 was phosphorylated as observed previously; however, Ser302 phosphorylation increased 2-fold after incubation with ATP (Fig. 5a) Thus, a Ser302 kinase associated with IRS-1 during immunoprecipitation.   [[FIGURE]] Previous studies show that JNK phosphorylates Ser307 on rat IRS-1 (Ser312 in human IRS-1), which inhibits insulin signaling (24). Because Ser302 is close to Ser307, we tested whether JNK might phosphorylate Ser302. We conducted this experiment with wild type MEFs or JNK-deficient MEFs obtained from JNK-1–/–::JNK-2–/– mice (MEFs do not express JNK-3). Our previous work showed that Ser307 phosphorylation was decreased more than 50% in JNK1–/–::JNK2–/– MEFs (15). However, insulin or IGF-I stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation to similar levels in both wild type and JNK-1–/–::JNK-2–/– MEFs (Fig. 5b). Because recombinant JNK-1 did not phosphorylate Ser302 in vitro (data not shown), we conclude that insulin/IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser302 in IRS-1 was not mediated by JNK. These results reveal that adjacent sites in IRS-1 are phosphorylated through distinct associated kinases.  Ser302 Phosphorylation Is Downstream of mTOR—We used classical inhibitors and amino acid starvation to determine whether the mTOR cascade might mediate Ser302 phosphorylation in IRS-1. Wortmannin or LY294002 (PI3K cascade), or rapamycin (mTOR cascade) inhibited insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation in MEFs, whereas PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade) had no inhibitory effect; these inhibitors had the expected effects on p70S6K, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5c). Similar results were obtained with 32D, CHO cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). Thus, mTOR-regulated pathways promote insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation.  Previous results showed that activation of mTOR by mitogens or insulin is modulated by nutrient availability, including amino acids or glucose (25, 26). We investigated the effect of amino acid and glucose starvation on Ser302 phosphorylation to establish further whether an mTOR-mediated pathway is involved. Incubation of CHOIR/IRS-1 cells in glucose and amino acid-free medium (DPBS) reduced basal and insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, a and b). Consistent with a role for the mTOR cascade, the addition of amino acids or glucose restored basal and insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, a and b). Insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation was not reduced in glucose/amino acid-free medium, suggesting that the early steps of insulin signaling were not inhibited, and sufficient ATP exists in the starved cells to mediate kinase activities (Fig. 6b). Rapamycin or LY294002 inhibited amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser302, whereas PD98059 had no effect, which was consistent with a role for the mTOR cascade during nutrient and insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 6c).   [[FIGURE]] Although our results suggest that kinases in the mTOR cascade promote Ser302 phosphorylation, mTOR itself is probably not involved. We treated cells with a relatively high concentration of okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatase 2A and other related phosphatases (27). As expected, okadaic acid increased Ser302 phosphorylation; however, the stimulatory effect of okadaic acid was not inhibited by either rapamycin or LY294002 (Fig. 6d). We conclude that mTOR is not a direct Ser302 kinase.  Ser302 Promotes Insulin-stimulated Mitogenesis—One of the main biological functions of insulin/IGF-I is to promote cell proliferation, and the activation of Akt, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 plays an important role (28–31). Because these signals are regulated differentially by A302IRS-1, we compared insulin/IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in 32D/IRS-1 and 32D/A302IRS-1 cells. As shown previously, insulin or IGF-I failed to promote DNA synthesis in wild type 32D cells; however, expression of IRS-1 mediated insulin/IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig. 7). Because insulin receptors are nearly absent in 32D cells, a high concentration of insulin was required to stimulate DNA synthesis in 32D/IRS-1 cells. However, insulin or IGF-I stimulation of DNA synthesis was significantly reduced in 32D/A302IRS-1 cells (Fig. 7).   [[FIGURE]]

Antibodies against phosphotyrosine, phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-p70S6K, p70S6K, phosphoribosomal S6, ribosomal S6, phospho-4E-BP-1, phospho-GSK-3β and GSK-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. JNK antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal antibodies against full-length IRS-1 were made in the laboratory. All inhibitors, cytokines, and growth factors were purchased from Calbiochem. A BrdUrd cell proliferation kit was purchased from Oncogene Research Products. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), 50× amino acid solution, and dextrose were from Invitrogen. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were from Roger Davis.  Mutagenesis—IRS-1 point mutants for Ser302 to Ala were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis method.  Cell Culture—IL-3-dependent 32D mouse myeloid cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI (IL-3), and 5 mm histidinol. 32D express a few endogenous insulin receptors but no endogenous IRS-proteins. Overexpression of IRS-1 in 32D cells reconstitutes many aspects of the insulin signaling pathway (17, 18). These cells were starved for at least 4 h before treatment with insulin/IGF-I. All inhibitors were added 30 min before insulin or growth factor treatment at 37 °C. 32D/IRS-1 and 32D/A302IRS-1 (mutant IRS-1 protein containing an alanine substitution for Ser302) were generated by electroporation and selected in histidinol as described previously (19). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO and MEF cells were starved for at least 12 h before inhibitor or insulin treatment.  Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Analysis—32D cells were starved for 4 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with insulin for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 130 nm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C followed by collection on protein A/G-Sepharose. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. A similar protocol was used for CHO and MEF cells. Muscle samples from mice were prepared as in Ref. 20.  Amino Acid Withdrawal—CHOIR/IRS-1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium as described previously. For the starvation of amino acids, cells were starved for at least 12 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then washed twice with and incubated in the same buffer for 2 h. A 1× final concentration of amino acids or 5 mm of d-glucose (Glc) were added to the cells for 30 min followed by a 15-min treatment with insulin (21).  Cell Proliferation Assay—Insulin/IGF-I-stimulated proliferation of 32D cells was assayed according to the company's manual (Oncogene Research Products). Briefly, 32D cells in log phase growth were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and counted by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hematocytometer. 100 μl of cells at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml were seeded into a 96-well culture dish. Cells were allowed to grow for 24 h. BrdUrd label was added to the cells for 6 h at 37 °C. BrdUrd incorporation was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a dual wavelength spectrometric plate reader (A450–540 nm). As controls, we included a blank containing only tissue culture medium and a background control containing only cells that were not labeled with BrdUrd. Each condition was done in triplicate, and the average absorbance values were used in plotting the results.
