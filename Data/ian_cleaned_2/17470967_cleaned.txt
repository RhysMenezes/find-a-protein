!~ABS~! The SWR1 complex (SWR1C) in yeast catalyzes the replacement of nucleosomal H2A with the H2AZ variant, which ensures full activation of underlying genes. We compared the phenotype of mutants in the homologs of SWR1C components in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations in Arabidopsis SWC6 (AtSWC6), SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA 3 (SUF3) and PHOTOPERIOD-INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING 1 (PIE1), homologs of SWC6, ARP6 and SWR1, respectively, caused similar developmental defects, including leaf serration, weak apical dominance, flowers with extra petals and early flowering by reduction in expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a strong floral repressor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that AtSWC6 and SUF3 bind to the proximal region of the FLC promoter, and protoplast transfection assays showed that AtSWC6 colocalizes with SUF3. Protein interaction analyses suggested the formation of a complex between PIE1, SUF3, AtSWC6 and AtSWC2. In addition, H2AZ, a substrate of SWR1C, interacts with both PIE1 and AtSWC2. Finally, knockdown of the H2AZ genes by RNA interference or artificial microRNA caused a phenotype similar to that of atswc6 or suf3. Our results strongly support the presence of an SWR1C-like complex in Arabidopsis that ensures proper development, including floral repression through full activation of FLC.
!~RES~! The yeast ARP6 protein, a homolog of SUF3 in Arabidopsis, is a component of SWR1C, which consists of 13 subunits including SWR1 and SWC6/VSP71 (CITATION; CITATION). Because there is a single homolog of SWC6, At5g37055, in Arabidopsis, we analyzed a T-DNA insertion mutant (SAIL_1142/CS841940) (Fig. 1). This mutant has a T-DNA insertion in the second intron of At5g37055, which results in the complete loss of expression (Fig. 1A-C). We named this gene Arabidopsis thaliana SWC6 (AtSWC6). The AtSWC6 gene encodes a HIT-type zinc-finger protein whose homologs, SWC6 and ZNHIT1, are subunits of the yeast SWR1 and mammalian SRCAP (SWI2/SNF2-related CBP activator protein) complexes, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). All three proteins have seven cysteines and one histidine highly conserved in a C-terminal region (see Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). The atswc6 mutant showed an early flowering phenotype as well as leaf serration, flowers with extra petals, small siliques and weak apical dominance (Fig. 1D-H; Table 2; Table 3). When the atswc6 mutation was introduced into FRI-containing Col (Col:FRISF2, referred to as FRI below) (CITATION; CITATION), which has very late flowering phenotype, the atswc6 suppressed FRI-mediated late flowering (Fig. 1D,F; Table 3). The atswc6 FRI showed much earlier flowering than FRI, but similar flowering with Col. When FLC expression was checked, the atswc6 FRI line showed an approximately 50% reduction as compared with FRI, but fivefold higher expression than Col (Fig. 1C). Such a partial suppression of FLC was also observed in suf3 FRI (Fig. 1C) (CITATION). Thus, the phenotypes caused by atswc6 were almost identical to that of suf3 reported previously (CITATION). Consistently, the double mutant of atswc6 suf3 was indistinguishable from any of the single mutants, irrespective of the presence of FRI (Fig. 1F). However, the expression analyses showed that the level of SUF3 was not affected by atswc6 and that of AtSWC6 was not affected by suf3, indicating that the two genes do not regulate each other at the transcriptional level (Fig. 1B,C).    Comparison of morphological phenotype in atswc6     Flowering time of atswc6, double mutants with atswc6, and transgenic plants  To confirm whether the mutation of At5g37055 is responsible for the atswc6 phenotype, a full-length cDNA of At5g37055 fused with 6 mycs or a GFP coding sequence driven by the 35S promoter was introduced into atswc6 mutants. We generated four transgenic lines of 35S-myc:AtSWC6 atswc6 and 21 lines of 35S-AtSWC6:GFP atswc6 (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis showed the accumulation of myc:AtSWC6 and AtSWC6:GFP proteins in 35S-myc:AtSWC6 atswc6 and 35S-AtSWC6:GFP atswc6 (see Fig. S2 in the supplementary material), suggesting that the fusion proteins were functional. All 35S-myc:AtSWC6 atswc6 showed complete rescue, but 35S-AtSWC6:GFP atswc6 showed partial rescue of flowering phenotype (Fig. 2A-C; Table 3). The other phenotypes, such as serrated leaves, weak apical dominance and extra petals, were completely rescued in all of the transgenic lines (data not shown). It is noteworthy that overexpression of AtSWC6 in atswc6 did not cause an additional delay in flowering and showed the same expression levels of FLC, FT and SOC1 as those of wild-type Col (Fig. 2C,D). Consistently, the AtSWC6 overexpression lines in Col did not show any additional phenotype (data not shown). Because the target of SUF3 is FLC (CITATION; CITATION), we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to check whether AtSWC6 and SUF3 bind to the chromatin of the FLC promoter region. For this, we used 35S-myc:AtSWC6 atswc6 and 35S-myc:SUF3 suf3 transgenic lines showing complementation of the mutant phenotype (Fig. 2E). Both transgenic lines showed enrichment of AtSWC6 and SUF3 proteins at the proximal (FLC-B and FLC-C) region of the FLC promoter, but not at the distal (FLC-A) region of the promoter or first intron (FLC-V), suggesting that these proteins bind to the promoter region of FLC chromatin. The expression of AtSWC6 was examined by RT-PCR, northern blot analysis and histochemical GUS reporter assay in AtSWC6p-AtSWC6:GUS transgenic lines. AtSWC6 transcripts were detected in all tissues tested at variable levels (Fig. 3A). AtSWC6 expression was strongly detected at early stage, and increased slightly with developmental age (Fig. 3B,E). The level of AtSWC6 transcripts did not show any daily rhythm, although that of SUF3 increased at night (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, AtSWC6 transcript levels were not affected by photoperiod or vernalization (Fig. 3D). In the transgenic plants expressing the translational fusion of AtSWC6 genomic DNA with GUS (AtSWC6p-AtSWC6:GUS), GUS expression was detected strongly in actively dividing cells such as root and shoot apex, lateral root primordia, inflorescence, flowers, axillary bud, developing siliques and premature seeds (Fig. 3E). However, GUS expression was rarely detected in mature seeds and siliques, old leaves and stems (Fig. 3E). To investigate whether AtSWC6 expression is regulated by other flowering time genes, we examined the transcript level of AtSWC6 in flowering-time mutants. The presence of FRI did not change the transcript level nor did an flc mutation (Fig. 1C; see Fig. S3 in the supplementary material). When we checked all the mutants involved in positive regulation of FLC (suf4, vip4, pie1, suf3 and abh1), the autonomous pathway (ld, fld, fve, fca, fy and fpa), the photoperiod pathway (gi and co) and flowering pathway integrators (ft and soc1), the AtSWC6 transcript level remained the same (see Fig. S3 in the supplementary material).   [[FIGURE]] Double mutant analysis showed that the atswc6 mutation reduced the fca- or ld-mediated high levels of FLC expression, thus resulting in earlier flowering and higher expression of SOC1 (Fig. 4A,B,E). The flc atswc6 double mutant flowered earlier than the flc single mutant, indicating that AtSWC6 regulates other floral repressor(s) in addition to FLC (Fig. 4C). Additionally, atswc6 partially suppressed late flowering of ft and caused upregulation of SOC1, which could be due to a decrease in FLC or in an additional repressor(s) or both in the atswc6 mutant (Fig. 4D,F). To investigate the cellular localization of AtSWC6, we examined the florescence of GFP in the root of 35S-AtSWC6:GFP atswc6 transgenic plants. The AtSWC6:GFP proteins were localized in the nuclei of root cells (see Fig. S4 in the supplementary material). We also performed protoplast transient assays using constructs expressing AtSWC6:GFP, AtSWC6:RFP and SUF3:GFP fusion proteins under the control of the 35S promoter so as to compare in detail the localization of AtSWC6 and SUF3. Consistent with the localization of AtSWC6:GFP in roots, both AtSWC6:GFP and AtSWC6:RFP were localized in the nuclei of leaf protoplasts. When they were transfected simultaneously, the fluorescence overlapped entirely and the AtSWC6 proteins formed nuclear speckles (Fig. 5, upper panels). By contrast, when AtSWC6:RFP proteins were expressed with SUF3:GFP, most of the AtSWC6:RFP proteins moved to where SUF3:GFP proteins were localized, such that the fluorescence overlapped (Fig. 5, lower panels). Previously, it was reported that SUF3 is localized at the nuclear periphery (CITATION). Our data thus indicate that AtSWC6:RFP relocates to the nuclear periphery where SUF3:GFP is localized, and strongly suggests that the two proteins interact. We performed yeast two-hybrid assays to determine whether the Arabidopsis homologs of the yeast SWR1C components directly interact with each other. For this assay, we included three homologs of H2AZ - HTA8, HTA9 and HTA11 (CITATION) - and a homolog of SWC2 (At2g36740), another component of SWR1C, which directly binds to H2AZ in yeast (CITATION). The results showed that AtSWC6 interacts with SUF3 and AtSWC2, and revealed homodimerization of AtSWC6 (Fig. 6A). By contrast, SUF3 showed neither homodimerization nor interaction with AtSWC2, suggesting that AtSWC6 links SUF3 and AtSWC2. For PIE1 interaction analysis, we divided the PIE1 protein into three regions: an N-terminal region (PIE1-N, 1-520 aa) containing the HSA domain; a middle region (PIE1-M, 520-1220 aa) containing two ATPase domains; and a C-terminal region (PIE1-C, 1220-2055 aa) containing the putative SANT domain (CITATION). It has been suggested that the SANT domain is required for interaction with both HATs or HDACs and chromatin (CITATION; CITATION). PIE1-C interacted with both SUF3 and AtSWC6 but not with AtSWC2, and PIE1-N interacted with the three H2AZs (HTA8, HTA9, HTA11) but not with the other proteins tested (Fig. 6D,E). PIE1-M did not show any interaction, despite the fact that it contains ATPase domains. AtSWC2 also interacted with all three H2AZs (Fig. 6B,C). This suggests that AtSWC2 and PIE1-N together are involved in binding to H2AZ. To confirm the yeast two-hybrid result, we performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using tobacco leaves transiently expressing myc:AtSWC6, AtSWC6:GFP, SUF3:Flag, myc:AtSWC2, HTA11:GFP and PIE1:GFP (Fig. 6F,G,H; see Fig. S6 in the supplementary material). The interactions of AtSWC6-SUF3, AtSWC6-AtSWC2, AtSWC2-HTA11, PIE1-SUF3, and PIE1-AtSWC6 were confirmed by the in planta coimmunoprecipitation assay. As expected, the negative control SUF4 failed to interact with AtSWC6 (Fig. 6G). Together, our results show interactions among PIE1, SUF3, AtSWC6, AtSWC2 and H2AZ.   [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] To ascertain whether the knockdown of H2AZ genes would cause a similar phenotype to that observed in pie1, atswc6, and suf3. We generated RNAi-mediated knockdown transgenic plants targeting all three Arabidopsis H2AZ homologs (Fig. 7). Inverted repeats of the three tandemly fused H2AZ DNA fragments separated by a spliceable intron were inserted between the 35S promoter and the OCS terminator, and the construct was used for transformation of FRI (Fig. 7A). Among 62 T1 transformants, eight plants flowered with fewer than 30 rosette leaves, and 11 plants flowered with 30-40 rosette leaves. A total of 30 T1 plants (about 50%) flowered with fewer than 50 leaves, which is earlier flowering than FRI (Fig. 7B,C). We further analyzed three lines showing the early flowering phenotype (flowered with less than 35 leaves). RT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript levels of HTA8 and HTA11 were reduced by approximately 50%, and that of HTA9 was slightly less reduced (Fig. 7D,E). Furthermore, RNA blot analysis showed that the early flowering lines had reduced FLC expression compared with FRI, suggesting that H2AZ is essential for full activation of FLC (Fig. 7D).   [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] To confirm the requirement of individual H2AZ genes for high-level FLC expression, we generated artificial microRNA (amiR)-mediated knockdown transgenic plants specifically targeting mRNA of HTA8 (amiR-HTA8), HTA9 (amiR-HTA9) and HTA11 (amiR-HTA11) in FRI, as previously described (CITATION). Although the targeted H2AZ was specifically knocked down, none of the amiR-HTA8 and HTA11 lines (48 and 64, respectively), and none (48 lines) of the amiR-HTA9 lines except two, showed any obvious flowering phenotype, and the FLC expression level was the same as that of the FRI (Fig. 7F). However, two lines of amiR-HTA9 showed earlier flowering (flowered with 38 and 40 leaves), and all amiR-HTA9 lines showed some degree of leaf serration similar to that seen in suf3 and atswc6. When we checked the tissue specificity of each H2AZ, they were expressed in almost every tissue and there was no difference in the expression pattern between them, although HTA9 showed higher expression than the other two (see Fig. S5 in the supplementary material). Thus, the absence of an obvious flowering phenotype in the amiR-HTA lines is likely to be due to functional redundancy among the three H2AZs. To confirm this, we made amiR-HTA9&11 transgenic lines that knocked down both HTA9 and HTA11 (Fig. 7G). These lines showed early flowering, reduced expression of FLC, leaf serration and flowers with extra petals (Fig. 7F). Among 32 transformants of the amiR-HTA9&11, 16 T1 plants flowered with 15-20 rosette leaves, which is similar to that of suf3 FRI or atswc6 FRI, and the rest also flowered before producing 30 rosettes. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that HTA8, HTA9 and HTA11 are functionally redundant and that FLC expression is regulated by the overall level of the three H2AZs.   [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The atswc6 mutant in a Col background was obtained from the Arabidopsis Stock Center (SAIL_1142/CS841940). For genetic analyses and construction of RNAi or amiRNA targeting H2AZs, we used the Arabidopsis Col:FRISF2 strain (FRI) (CITATION; CITATION). All flowering-time mutant alleles used in this study have been described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Plants were grown as previously described (CITATION). Flowering time was measured by counting the number of rosette leaves from at least 20 plants. Primer pairs for amplification of cDNAs or genomic DNAs for plasmid construction are detailed in Table 1. To construct AtSWC6 and SUF3 overexpressors, full-length AtSWC6 and SUF3 cDNAs amplified by PCR were cloned into a binary vector myc-pBA (CITATION). For 35S-AtSWC6:GFP construction, full-length AtSWC6 cDNA without the stop codon was cloned into the modified pPZP211 (KH24) vector with the 35S promoter, GFP coding sequence, and NOS terminator derived from p326-GFP (CITATION). For generation of AtSWC6 p-AtSWC6:GUS transgenic plants, 329 bp of upstream sequence from the stop codon of At5g37060 (the neighboring gene) to the translational start site of AtSWC6, and the full-length genomic DNA of AtSWC6 except for the stop codon, were amplified and cloned into the T-DNA binary vector pDW137 (CITATION) as a translational fusion with the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. To prepare the construct expressing AtSWC6:GFP or AtSWC6:RFP fusion proteins for protoplast transient expression assays, the open reading frame of AtSWC6 was cloned into p326-GFP and p326-RFP (CITATION). For yeast two-hybrid assays, AtSWC6, SUF3, AtSWC2 (At2g36740), HTA8, HTA9, HTA11, PIE1-N (1-1560 bp), PIE1-M (1560-3660 bp) and PIE1-C (3660-6168 bp) cDNAs were amplified and cloned into the BamHI site or BglII site (for AtSWC2) of pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors, respectively. To produce the H2AZ RNAi construct, an inverted-repeat construct including the HTA8, HTA9 and HTA11 cDNAs was made using the pKANNIBAL vector in which a spliceable intron separates the two repeats (CITATION). Then, the region including the 35S promoter, two repeats, intron and OCS terminator was subcloned into the NotI site of the binary vector pART27 for transformation of FRI. Artificial miRNAs to specifically knockdown HTA8, HTA9, HTA11, and both HTA9 and HTA11, were prepared by overlapping PCR using the pGEM-T Easy vector containing MIR319a as template (CITATION). PCR products including the amiRNA sequences were inserted into the binary vector pCGN18 (CITATION). For Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression, the full-length AtSWC2, HTA11 and PIE1 cDNAs were cloned into myc-pBA or the modified pPZP211 (KH24).    Primers used for plasmid construction in this study  Ten-day-old seedlings grown under long-day conditions were used for the ChIP assay as described previously (CITATION). Polyclonal anti-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-789) was used for immunoprecipitation. PCR detection of FLC regions and TUBULIN β-2 (TUB2) was performed with the primers shown in Table 1. Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis using TRIZOL (Sigma). The digoxigenin (DIG) labeled-mRNA probes for FLC, SOC1, SUF3 and AtSWC6 were prepared as previously described (CITATION). RNA blotting, hybridization and washes were performed as described in the DIG application manual (Roche). RT-PCR and primers for SOC1, FLC, FT and TUB2 are as previously described (CITATION; CITATION). Primers for AtSWC6, HTA8, HTA9 and HTA11 are: AtSWC6, 5′-ATGGAGGAAGAGATGTCGAAC-3′ and 5′-CTATGCAACAAATTTCTGACA-3′; HTA8, 5′-ATGGCTGGTAAAGGTGGGAAAG-3′ and 5′-TCAATCCTTGGTGACTTTGTTG-3′; HTA9, 5′-ATGTCGGGGAAAGGGCTAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTATTCCTTGGCGGATTTGTTG-3′; HTA11, 5′-ATGGCAGGCAAAGGTGGAAAAG-3′ and 5′-TCACTCCTTGGTGGTTTTGTTG-3′. Plant tissues were harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen and solubilized in protein extraction buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, and 1×protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche)]. The debris was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Western blot analyses were performed to determine the myc:AtSWC6 or AtSWC6:GFP protein levels in 35S-myc:AtSWC6 atswc6 or 35S-AtSWC6:GFP atswc6 using anti-myc or anti-GFP antibodies.   [[FIGURE]] Detection of GUS expression in AtSWC6p-AtSWC6:GUS transgenic plants was performed according to Jefferson et al. (CITATION). Plant samples were incubated in 90% acetone at room temperature for 10 minutes. The samples were rinsed once with staining solution without X-Gluc (0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM potassium ferricyanide). The staining solution was replaced by staining solution containing 2 mM X-Gluc, and the plant samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. Samples were then observed after incubating in 50% ethanol at room temperature for 30 minutes. Rosette leaves of Col plants grown for 4 weeks in long-day conditions were sampled for the isolation and transformation of protoplasts as described [Sheen, J. (2002). A transient expression assay using Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb/]. Protoplasts were co-transformed with both GFP and RFP fusion constructs, totalling about 10 μg of plasmid DNA (prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit) and cultured at 22°C in the dark. 12 hours after transformation, protoplasts were observed as previously described (CITATION). The vectors and yeast strains (Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3) were obtained from Clontech. The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as previously described (CITATION) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binary constructs presented in Table 1 were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and the coimmunoprecipitation assay performed as previously described (CITATION).
