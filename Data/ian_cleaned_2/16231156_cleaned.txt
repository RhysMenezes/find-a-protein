!~ABS~! Cytosolic 10-kDa acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) function in the storage and intracellular transport of acyl-CoA esters in eukaryotes. Fatty acids synthesized de novo in plant chloroplasts are exported as oleoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA esters. In Arabidopsis, other than the 10-kDa ACBP, there exists five larger ACBPs (ACBP1 to ACBP5) of which homologues have not been characterized in other organisms. To investigate the significance of this gene family, we have attempted to subcellularly localize them and compare their acyl-CoA-binding affinities. We have previously shown that Arabidopsis ACBP1 and ACBP2 are membrane-associated proteins while ACBP4 and ACBP5 contain kelch motifs. Here, to localize ACBP3, we have expressed ACBP3-red fluorescent protein (DsRed2) from the CaMV 35S promoter. ACBP3-DsRed was localized extracellularly in transiently expressed tobacco BY-2 cells and onion epidermal cells. The function of the acyl-CoA-binding domain in ACBP3 was investigated by in vitro binding assays using (His)6-ACBP3, which was observed to bind [14C]arachidonyl-CoA with high affinity in comparison to [14C]palmitoyl-CoA and [14C]oleoyl-CoA. To identify the residues functional in binding, five mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the acyl-CoA-binding domain of (His)6-ACBP3 and (His)6-ACBP1 (which also binds [14C]arachidonyl-CoA) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Binding assays with arachidonyl-CoA revealed that replacement of a conserved R residue (R150A in ACBP1 and R284A in ACBP3), disrupted binding. In contrast, other substitutions in ACBP1 (Y126A, K130A, K152A and Y171A) and in ACBP3 (F260A, K264A, K286A and Y305A) did not affect arachidonyl-CoA binding, unlike their equivalents in (His)6-ACBP2, (His)6-ACBP4 and (His)6-ACBP5, which had altered binding to palmitoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA.
!~RES~! Using the PSORT WWW server, as available on http://psort.nibb.ac.jp, ACBP3 was predicted to contain a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence (Fig. 1a) and was extracellularly localized with high certainty (score of 0.852). The putative cleavage site lies between amino acids 26 and 27 on ACBP3. The previous use of the PSORT WWW server (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp) had demonstrated its reliability in the subcellular localizations of ACBP1 and ACBP2, which was subsequently confirmed by ACBP1-GFP and ACBP2-GFP fusions (Li and Chye CITATION). Using the method (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop) of Tusnady and Simon (CITATION), we further located the presence of one transmembrane domain (amino acids 7–26) in ACBP3, which overlapped its putative signal sequence (amino acids 1–26). [[FIGURE]]  To investigate the subcellular localization of ACBP3, a translational fusion of full-length ACBP3 peptide (consisting of amino acids 1 to 337) fused to the N-terminus of DsRed2 (Fig. 1a) was generated. Following particle bombardment, the protein fusion transiently expressed from the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter in tobacco BY-2 cells (Fig. 1b, c) or onion epidermal cells (Fig. 1d–g) was examined under a laser scanning confocal microscope. On confocal microscopy, the signal from the ACBP3-DsRed fusion protein was observed at the periphery of the cells (Fig. 1b) while that of the control construct (pRGD) expressing DsRed alone was confined to the nucleus (Fig. 1c). To determine if the ACBP3-DsRed fusion protein is associated with the plasma membrane, the bombarded onion epidermal cells were subjected to plasmolysis. It was observed that the DsRed signal was not associated with the plasma membrane upon plasmolysis (Fig. 1f–g). In contrast, no autofluorescence was detected in untransformed BY-2 and onion epidermal cells (data not shown). Thus, it appears that ACBP3 is localized extracellularly, consistent with its subcellular prediction. To investigate the function of the acyl-CoA-binding domain in ACBP3, it was essential to express it for in vitro binding assays with acyl-CoA esters. To this end, the cDNA encoding ACBP3 was obtained by RT-PCR for production of (His)6-tagged recombinant protein in E. coli. The cDNA was cloned in expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in-frame to the (His)6-tag to enable easy purification of the recombinant proteins from crude bacterial extracts using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Initially, the expression of recombinant (His)6-ACBP3 from the full-length cDNA on plasmid pAT183 posed some problems with E. coli growth. Using the PSORT program (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp), the recombinant (His)6-ACBP3 expressed from plasmid pAT183 was predicted (with 0.406 certainty) to be targeted to the E. coli membrane. Possibly, the expressed recombinant protein affected bacterial membrane integrity and was consequently detrimental to the transformed cells, hence the observed growth inhibition. Subsequently, the acyl-CoA-binding domain of ACBP3 (amino acids T216 to P362) was expressed in E. coli. In PSORT analysis, this smaller (His)6-ACBP3 recombinant protein would be targeted to the cytosol. Its accumulation was observed in the insoluble fraction of bacterial extracts. On Coomassie Blue-stained gel, (His)6-ACBP3 had an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa (Fig. 2a). On western blot analysis (Fig. 2b), the 23-kDa band cross-reacted with the QIAexpress Ni-NTA AP conjugate (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). In comparison, the calculated molecular mass of the (His)6-ACBP3 expressed from the truncated cDNA is 19.4 kDa. [[FIGURE]]  (His)6-ACBP3 protein was recovered from the insoluble fractions by urea solubilization of inclusion bodies. The solubilized fusion proteins were then purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin under denaturing conditions. Using SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2c), (His)6-ACBP3 eluted in both buffer D (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl, pH 5.9, 5% glycerol) and buffer E (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl, pH 4.5, 5% glycerol). Following dialysis, refolding and concentration, the purified recombinant (His)6-ACBP3 was used for in vitro binding assays. Using Lipidex assays, the binding of (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3 to commercially available acyl-CoA esters, [14C]palmitoyl-CoA, [14C]oleoyl-CoA and [14C]arachidonyl-CoA, representative of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively, were tested. This set of fatty acids had been previously used in binding assay tests with recombinant ACBP2, ACBP4 and ACBP5 (Leung et al. CITATION) and a comparison of their binding affinities with recombinant ACBP3 was sought. Also, previous investigations on recombinant ACBP1 (Chye CITATION; Chye et al. CITATION) had not tested its binding to [14C]arachidonyl-CoA. Both recombinant (His)6-ACBP1 (Fig. 3a) and (His)6-ACBP3 (Fig. 3b) were shown to preferentially bind [14C]arachidonyl-CoA, rather than [14C]palmitoyl-CoA or [14C]oleoyl-CoA. The K d values for arachidonyl-CoA calculated from the Scatchard plots for (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3 were (Fig. 4a) 0.20 and 0.13 μM, respectively, while the K d values for both oleoyl-CoA for (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3 were (Fig. 4b) 0.72 μM. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  To investigate the possibility of the binding of recombinant (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3 to plant polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, non-radiolabelled linolenoyl-CoA was used as a competitor in Lipidex assays with [14C]arachidonyl-CoA since radiolabelled linolenoyl-CoA is not commercially available. The results indicate that linolenoyl-CoA could not compete with [14C]arachidonyl-CoA in binding (His)6-ACBP1 (Fig. 3c) or (His)6-ACBP3 (Fig. 3d). To establish the significance of the acyl-CoA-binding domain in ACBP1 and ACBP3, altogether five single amino acid substitutions at the acyl-CoA-binding domain in each (His)6-ACBP were created using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. Since (His)6-ACBP2 has been recently observed to bind arachidonyl-CoA with an affinity similar to palmitoyl-CoA (Leung et al. CITATION), but lower than those of (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3, it was noted that substitutions in (His)6-ACBP2 that had impaired palmitoyl-CoA binding (Chye et al. CITATION) were also conserved in ACBP1 (Y126, K130, K152 and Y171) and ACBP3 (K268, K286 and Y305) except for F260 in ACBP3 (Fig. 5). Thus, these four residues in each of recombinant ACBP1 and ACBP3 were initial targets for site-directed mutagenesis. In comparison, both (His)6-ACBP4 and (His)6-ACBP5, which bind oleoyl-CoA with high affinities but do not bind arachidonyl-CoA (Leung et al. CITATION), are conserved in only two of the four (His)6-ACBP2 equivalents deemed essential for palmitoyl-CoA binding (Y48 and K74 in ACBP4, and Y49 and K75 in ACBP5; Fig. 5). [[FIGURE]]  Single amino acid substitutions affecting the four (His)6-ACBP2 equivalents were made in each of (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3. These mutant forms of recombinant ACBP1 (Y126A, K130A, K152A and Y171A) and ACBP3 (F260A, K264A, K286A and Y305A) were created by in vitro mutagenesis on plasmid templates pAT61 and pAT223, respectively. The mutant proteins were expressed and extracted from E. coli following conditions established for wild-type and were subsequently used in Lipidex assays. However, results revealed that these single amino acid substitutions did not adversely affect arachidonyl-CoA binding when compared to wild-type (Fig. 6). [[FIGURE]]  Since an R residue had been previously demonstrated to be important in binding arachidonic acid (Rowlinson et al. CITATION), the function of the only R residue conserved in both the acyl-CoA-binding domains of ACBP1 and ACBP3 was further tested. This R residue is conserved in ACBP1, ACBP2 and ACBP3, which bind arachidonyl-CoA, but not in ACBP4 and ACBP5 (Leung et al. CITATION) (Fig. 5). Mutants R150A in ACBP1 and R284A in ACBP3 were generated and were expressed in E. coli following conditions established for wild-type. They were subsequently used in Lipidex assays for binding [14C]arachidonyl-CoA (Fig. 6). Results showed that this R substitution in both (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3 culminated in reduced arachidonyl-CoA binding activity (Fig. 6). All five amino acid residues chosen for site-directed mutagenesis in recombinant ACBP1 and ACBP3 are predicted to lie within the acyl-CoA-binding pocket, based on a homology model (Fig. 7) generated with the aid of the x-ray crystal structures of bovine ACBP (PDB entry 1ACA). The structures of ACBP2 (Fig. 7a), ACBP1 (Fig. 7b) and ACBP3 (Fig. 7c) show the “front”-views of the proteins. The 3D structures of ACBP1 (Fig. 7b) and ACBP3 (Fig. 7c) are similar to those of other previously reported cytosolic ACBPs because the fold of the peptide backbones of ACBP1 and ACBP3 show each protein as an up-down–down-up four-α-helix bundle with an overhand loop connecting helices A2 and A3 (Andersen and Poulsen CITATION). In contrast to ACBP1 and ACBP3, ACBP2 (Fig. 7a) contains three helices and lacks the fourth helix when compared to the template bovine ACBP. [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~!  A. thaliana (wild-type ecotype Columbia) plants were grown in a growth chamber under 12 h light/12 h dark cycles at 20°C. Onions (Allium cepa L.) were obtained from a local supermarket. The cDNAs encoding ACBP3 with restriction sites incorporated at each 5′-end (BamHI) and 3′-end (HindIII) were prepared from first-strand cDNA using RT-PCR. Primer sequences with incorporated restriction sites were designed for subsequent cloning “in-frame” to the (His)6-tagged expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). In PCR-amplification of the ACBP3 cDNA, forward primer ML348 (5′-CGGGATCCTATGGAGGTTTTCTTAGAGATGC-3′; BamHI site underlined) and reverse primer ML349 (5′-CAAGCTTAGGGAATACCATTTTTGCTGG-3′; HindIII site underlined) were used. The 25-μl PCR reaction consisted of 25 ng plasmid DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 1 U Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA), 2.5 μl 10 × PCR buffer, 1.5 μl of 25 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 μl each of 10 mM dNTPs. PCR amplification was initiated with denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min and 68°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 10 min. The resultant ACBP3 cDNA was cloned in vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to yield plasmid pAT180 for confirmation by DNA sequence analysis of the PCR insert, before subcloning into E. coli expression vector pRSETB. Following difficulties in expressing recombinant (His)6-ACBP3 from full-length cDNA, a 5′-truncated cDNA encoding the ACBP3-binding domain (T216 to P362) was amplified by PCR from template pAT183, the pRSETB derivative containing the full-length ACBP3 cDNA, and forward primer ML555 (5′-GGATCCGTTGACTATTGAAGAAGATGAT-3′; BamHI site underlined) and reverse primer ML349. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pGEM-T Easy, designated plasmid pAT222, for DNA sequence confirmation of this truncated ACBP3 cDNA. Plasmid pRGD used in this study was derived from plasmid pGDR, which contains the gene encoding the red fluorescent protein DsRed (Goodin et al. CITATION). DsRed was amplified by PCR using forward primer ML599 (5′-GGGCCCGGGATCCATGGCCTCCTCCGAGAACGT-3′) and reverse primer ML600 (5′-AGATCTCTACAGGAACAGGTGGTG-3′), and then cloned into vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega). After confirmation of the PCR insert by DNA sequencing analysis, the ApaI-BglII fragment of DsRed from the pGEM-T Easy derivative was cloned into the ApaI and BamHI sites on vector pGD to yield pRGD. ACBP3 consisting of amino acids 1 to 337, on a 1-kb BamHI-ApaI fragment of ACBP3 cDNA from plasmid pAT270 (a pBluescript II SK [−] derivative containing a BamHI–EcoRI fragment of ACBP3 cDNA) was fused in-frame with DsRed of pRGD to yield construct pAT265 that was subsequently used for localization studies. The 5′-end deletion derivative of the ACBP3 cDNA (on a 0.45-kb BamHI–HindIII fragment) from plasmid pAT222, was cloned in-frame to corresponding sites on vector pRSETB to yield plasmid pAT223. The calculated molecular mass of (His)6-ACBP3 expressed from this plasmid predicted by GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin Software Version 10.2) analysis was 19.4 kDa. Particle bombardment was used to introduce DsRed fusion plasmids into tobacco BY-2 cells and onion epidermal cells with a Biolistic PDS-1000/He system (BioRad). Gold particles (1.0-μm) were coated with the respective plasmid and a helium pressure of 9.3 MPa was employed. About 360-μg of gold particles were coated with 0.9 μg DNA in one shot. The target distance between the stop screen and BY-2 cells/onion pieces was set at 9 cm. After bombardment, BY-2 cells and onion epidermal cells were kept in darkness at 22°C for 15 h and subsequently examined under a Leica TCS-SP laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). For experiments on cell plasmolysis following particle bombardment, the layer of onion epidermal cells was lifted up and incubated in 1 M sucrose solution for 20 min as previously described (Li and Chye CITATION). Single optical sections were scanned as resulting images for each transient expression. For each plasmid construct, 10–20 cells were imaged with similar results. RNA from 4-week-old whole plants was extracted using guanidine thiocyanate (Nagy et al. CITATION). First-strand synthesis was carried out using the Superscript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for RT-PCR. The first-strand reaction was carried out in 20 μl with 5 μg RNA, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix and 0.5 μg oligo-(dT)12–18, as described in the kit.  E. coli BL21(DE3)Star pLysS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was transformed with plasmid pAT223. Transformed cells were grown to OD600 nm=0.4, as measured using a UV-spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Model UV-1206, Japan), and induced with 1 mM IPTG. (His)6-ACBP3 was harvested 3 h after IPTG-induction for extraction of soluble and insoluble proteins following procedures described by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Recombinant (His)6-ACBP1 was expressed from plasmid pAT61 in E. coli as described previously (Chye CITATION). Plasmid pAT61 contains an ExoIII deletion derivative of the ACBP1 cDNA, on a 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment, in vector pRSETB (Chye CITATION). The recombinant (His)6-ACBP1 fusion protein lacks the first 40 amino acids at the N-terminal of ACBP1 (Chye CITATION). Protein concentrations of bacterial crude extracts were determined by the method of Bradford (CITATION) and samples (10 μg) harvested at various time intervals were analysed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (CITATION). Subsequently, the 10% polyacrylamide gel was either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or used in Western blot analysis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to ECL membranes (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) from SDS-PAGE gel using the Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Sambrook (CITATION). The QIAexpress Ni-NTA AP Conjugate (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer to detect the presence of (His)6-tagged recombinant proteins. (His)6-ACBP1 was expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli extracts and was purified through an affinity column of Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as previously described (Chye CITATION). Batch extractions of (His)6-ACBP3 was carried out under denaturing conditions and protein was purified through an affinity column of Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the instructions of the supplier. The (His)6-tagged recombinant fusion protein was eluted in both buffer D (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl, pH 5.9, 5% glycerol) and buffer E (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris-Cl, pH 4.5, 5% glycerol). After dialysis and refolding in 50 mM HEPES sodium salt, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.9 at 4°C, the purified (His)6-tagged recombinant fusion protein was concentrated using Centricon-10 (Amicon) spin columns and was subsequently used for in vitro binding assays. The concentrations of purified (His)6-ACBP1 and (His)6-ACBP3 were determined by weighing freeze-dried recombinant protein and measurements of absorbance at 280 nm (Layne CITATION). In vitro binding assays with [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), [14C]oleoyl-CoA (Amersham) or [14C]arachidonyl-CoA (Moravek, Mercury Lane Brea, CA, USA) were carried out using Lipidex-1000 (Packard BioScience, Groningen, The Netherlands) with recombinant (His)6-ACBPs following Leung et al. (CITATION). Lipidex-1000 consists of Sephadex LH-20, a hydrophobic column-packing material that separates protein-bound and unbound fatty acids (Glatz and Veerkamp CITATION). Recombinant ACBPs were equilibrated in buffer with radiolabelled acyl-CoA, after which Lipidex was added to bind “unbound acyl-CoA.” Subsequently the Lipidex/acyl-CoA complex was sedimented by centrifugation and the acyl-CoA bound to recombinant ACBP was estimated by determining the radioactivity in the supernatant. Assays were performed in triplicates, with blanks, at each concentration of acyl-CoA. Each recombinant ACBP was dissolved in 50 μl of binding buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) to obtain a stock solution of 0.8 μM recombinant protein. Subsequently, each recombinant protein was mixed with [14C]palmitoyl-CoA, [14C]oleoyl-CoA or [14C]arachidonyl-CoA, at final acyl-CoA concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1 μM and final recombinant protein concentration of 0.2 μM. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, followed by chilling on ice for 10 min. Then samples were mixed with 400 μl of ice-cold 50% slurry of Lipidex-1000 in binding buffer and kept for 10 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min at 4°C. A 200-μl aliquot of the supernatant was taken for analysis of radioactivity counts using a liquid scintillation counter Type Minaxi Tri-Carb 4000 (Packard, Meriden, CT, USA). The ratio for the number of moles of bound acyl-CoA molecules to the number of moles of molecules of ACBPs was calculated using the equation of Motulsky and Neubig (CITATION). The dissociation constants were determined from a Scatchard plot, which also established the total protein concentration and the ratio of unbound to bound acyl-CoA. Lipidex assays using [14C]arachidonyl-CoA in the presence of competitor non-radiolabelled linolenoyl-CoA (Avanti, AL, USA) were carried out in the presence of equimolar concentrations of the competitor. Plasmids pAT61 and pAT223 were used as mutagenesis templates for generating mutant derivatives of (His)6-tagged recombinant ACBP1 and ACBP3, respectively. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used, according to instructions of the supplier, to obtain mutant derivatives that were subsequently verified by DNA sequence analysis before protein expression. The primer pairs used for site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Table 1. Each mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as described for wild-type recombinant protein for binding assays. [[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] Amino acid sequences of cytosolic ACBPs from various species located in the protein entries of GenBank were aligned at the acyl-CoA-binding pocket using hidden Markov models (Karplus et al. CITATION) and CLUSTAL W (Thompson et al. CITATION). Multiple sequence alignments were used to generate the best pair-wise alignment of the acyl-CoA-binding domains of ACBP1, ACBP2 and ACBP3 with that of bovine ACBP (PDB entry 1ACA) (Bos taurus, gi:493800). This pair-wise alignment was the basis for creating a homology model, with PDB entry 1ACA as template in the program SWISS-MODEL/Swiss-PdbViewer (Guex and Peitsch CITATION). The models were adjusted using rotamers to improve packing at the interior of the protein.
