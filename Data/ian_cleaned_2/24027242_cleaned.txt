!~ABS~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs) form a large family consisting of 20 members and have been implicated in Ca2+ signaling related to various physiological processes, such as pathogen defense, development, and thermotolerance. The null mutant of AtCNGC2, defense, no death (dnd1), exhibits autoimmune phenotypes, while it is impaired in mounting the hypersensitive response, which is a hallmark of effector-triggered (i.e. RESISTANCE-gene mediated) resistance. It has been suggested that AtCNGC2 is involved in defense responses and likely other aspects of physiology through its role as a Ca2+-conducting channel. However, the downstream signaling components and its relation with AtCNGC4, which is the closest paralog of AtCNGC2, remain elusive. Despite the fact that cngc4 mutants display almost identical phenotypes to those seen in cngc2 mutants, not much is known about their relationship. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Arabidopsis mutant repressor of defense no death1 (rdd1), obtained from a suppressor screen of a transfer DNA insertion knockout mutant of AtCNGC2 in order to identify downstream components of dnd1-mediated signal transduction. rdd1 suppressed the majority of dnd1-mediated phenotypes except Ca2+ hypersensitivity. In addition, rdd1 also suppressed the dnd1-mediated late-flowering phenotype that was discovered in this study. Our genetic analysis conducted to elucidate the relationship between AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 indicates that RDD1 is also involved in AtCNGC4-mediated signal transduction. Lastly, bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis suggests that AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 are likely part of the same channel complex.
!~RES~! A T-DNA insertion homozygous line (Salk_066908) for AtCNGC2 (At5g15410) was obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org; Supplemental Fig. S1A). We named this line cngc2-3. Homozygosity of the insertion was confirmed by PCR analysis, and the lack of expression of proper full-length mRNA was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S1B). As we expected, the morphological phenotype of this line is identical to the null mutant, dnd1, further confirming the functional knockout status of this mutant (Fig. 1A). Approximately 10,000 cngc2-3 seeds were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate and screened for plants suppressing the morphological phenotype of cngc2 in the M2 generation. rdd1 with the cngc2-3 background, designated rdd1 cngc2-3, was identified based on its intermediate morphology between the Columbia (Col) wild type and cngc2 (Fig. 1A). The cngc2-3 background of rdd1 cngc2-3 was confirmed by PCR analysis (Supplemental Fig. S1C). dnd1 has been reported to exhibit conditional spontaneous lesion formation (CITATION). Under our growth conditions, we observed this lesion formation in dnd1 as well as cngc2-3, while this phenotype was suppressed in rdd1 cngc2-3 (Fig. 1A). To determine the genetic nature, rdd1 cngc2-3 plants were backcrossed to cngc2-3 plants. All B1 (backcrossed, first generation) plants displayed rdd1 cngc2-3 morphology, suggesting that rdd1 is a dominant mutation (Table I). The subsequent self-pollinated B2 generation (backcrossed, selfed) segregated with a 3:1 (rdd1 cngc2-3:cngc2-3) phenotypic ratio, indicating that the morphological phenotype of rdd1 cngc2-3 segregates as a single locus that is dominant to the wild-type RDD1 allele (Table I). Thus, hereafter, we call this mutant rdd1-1D cngc2-3. [[FIGURE]] The partial suppression of the cngc2-conferred dwarfism in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 prompted us to assess other dnd1-related phenotypes. As mentioned above, dnd1 plants display reduced or absent HR upon infection with avirulent pathogens. To examine the effect of the rdd1-1D mutation on HR formation, rdd1-1D cngc2-3 leaves were inoculated with avirulent P. syringae pv glycinea expressing avrRpt2 (Psg avrRpt2+) and assessed for HR induction. At 24 h post inoculation, Col wild-type leaves displayed HR as visible leaf collapse, which was absent in rdd1-1D cngc2-3, cngc2-3, and dnd1 leaves (Fig. 1B). Plant cells that undergo HR display significant increases in autofluorescence due to the production of phenolic compounds (CITATION). Therefore, to closely monitor HR induction, leaf discs were excised from the inoculated areas and viewed with a microscope to compare HR-induced autofluorescence. As seen in Figure 1C, Col wild-type inoculated leaves exhibited a high level of autofluorescence. Interestingly, a marked increase in autofluorescence was also observed in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 inoculated leaves compared with cngc2-3 and dnd1, although to a lesser degree than the Col wild type (Fig. 1C). Similar results were also observed in plants inoculated with P. syringae pv tomato expressing avrRpt2 (data not shown). Taken together, the mutation partially suppresses the HR-deficient phenotype observed in cngc2-3 and dnd1 plants in response to avirulent pathogen infection. As mentioned previously, cngc2 mutant plants display autoimmune phenotypes, such as elevated levels of SA and constitutive expression of PR genes. They also display enhanced resistance to virulent strains of P. syringae and H. arabidopsidis despite their HR-deficient phenotypes. To examine the effect of the rdd1-1D mutation on these phenotypes, the growth of the bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 was measured. As shown in Figure 2A, both dnd1 and cngc2-3 showed reduced pathogen growth compared with the Col wild type, whereas rdd1-1D cngc2-3 did not. A similar breakdown of cngc2-conferred enhanced resistance was also observed after infection with the virulent oomycete pathogen H. arabidopsidis, isolate Noco2. This strain is virulent to the Col ecotype, which is the background of both dnd1 and cngc2-3. As shown in Figure 2B, a partial breakdown of enhanced resistance in cngc2 was observed in rdd1-1D cngc2-3. As reported previously, dnd1 plants display autoinduction of PR-1 gene expression. This was also observed in cngc2-3. However, it was significantly reduced in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 (Fig. 2C). These data indicate a reduction of cngc2-mediated accumulation of SA in rdd1-1D cngc2-3; thus, the endogenous level of total SA was measured. Similar to PR-1 gene expression, lower levels of total SA in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 compared with dnd1 and cngc2-3 were detected (Fig. 2D). Taken together, the rdd1-1D mutation suppressed the autoimmune phenotype conferred by cngc2. [[FIGURE]] Through characterization of rdd1-1D cngc2-3, we discovered a novel phenotype in cngc2/dnd1. Under our long-day (16 h of light/8 h of dark) and ambient humidity conditions, Col wild-type plants flowered 23 d post stratification, while cngc2-3 and dnd1 mutant plants flowered significantly later, at 29 d post stratification (Fig. 3, A and B). This novel phenotype was also repressed in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 plants, which flowered at approximately the same time as the Col wild type (Fig. 3B). Delayed flowering can also be reflected by an increased number of rosette leaves prior to bolting. As shown in Figure 3C, Col wild-type plants had significantly fewer rosette leaves at the time of flowering compared with cngc2-3 and dnd1 plants, confirming the delayed-flowering phenotype of cngc2 and dnd1 mutants. Similar to the Col wild type, the rosette leaf number in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 was significantly reduced compared with cngc2-3 and dnd1 (Fig. 3C), indicating that the mutation in RDD1 suppresses the delayed floral transition observed in cngc2 mutants. Similar but more pronounced results were observed under short days (8 h of light/16 h of dark; Supplemental Table S1). Consistent with these results, expression levels of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC; CITATION) were significantly elevated in cngc2-3 and dnd1 compared with the Col wild type, while wild-type expression levels were observed in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, a novel delayed-flowering phenotype was observed in cngc2 and dnd1 mutants, which is likely caused by an alteration in FLC expression. This phenotype was abolished in rdd1-1D cngc2-3 under both long- and short-day conditions. [[FIGURE]] It was previously shown that null mutations of AtCNGC2 lead to hypersensitivity to Ca2+ that impairs plant growth (CITATION). To determine whether rdd-1D also suppresses this phenotype, we compared the size of Col wild-type, rdd1-1D cngc2-3, cngc2-3, and dnd1 plants grown in Ca2+-supplemented medium. As seen in Figure 4A, although slight chlorosis was observed, Col wild-type plants did not display any strong suppression in growth with 20 mm Ca2+-supplemented medium. In contrast, cngc2-3 and dnd1 plants exhibited severely stunted growth and chlorosis, which was consistent with the previous report (CITATION). Unexpectedly, rdd1-1D cngc2-3 plants also displayed stunted growth and severe chlorosis similar to cngc2-3 and dnd1, indicating that rdd1-1D does not suppress Ca2+ hypersensitivity of cngc2. This observation was also confirmed quantitatively by measuring the average fresh weight of each genotype. As shown in Figure 4B, rdd1-1D cngc2-3, cngc2-3, and dnd1 plants showed significant size reductions compared with the Col wild type on medium supplemented with 20 mm Ca2+. To assess whether the suppression is partial, lower concentrations of Ca2+ (5 and 10 mm) were also tested. As shown in Supplemental Figure S2, there was no statistical significance in these lower concentrations between rdd1-1D cngc2-3 and cngc2-3. Taken together, the mutation of rdd1 does not suppress the Ca2+ hypersensitivity of cngc2 mutants. [[FIGURE]] It has been reported that null mutants of AtCNGC4 (hlm1/dnd2) exhibit strikingly similar phenotypes to cngc2-3 and dnd1 plants, such as dwarfism, enhanced pathogen resistance, and an impaired HR response to avirulent pathogens (CITATION; CITATION). As mentioned, AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 are the sole members of group IVB and share high sequence similarity (CITATION). This prompted us to investigate whether rdd1 can also suppress dnd2-mediated phenotypes. For this analysis, we used an AtCNGC4 T-DNA insertion line (Salk_081369). The homozygosity of the T-DNA insertion as well as the knockout status of this line (i.e. expression) were confirmed by PCR analysis and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively, and this line was named cngc4-5 (Supplemental Figs. S1, A and B, and S3A). We crossed this line with rdd1-1D cngc2-3 plants. All F1 plants were genotyped to confirm the existence of the T-DNA insertion in AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 (data not shown). Following self-pollination, a total of 243 F2 plants were monitored for their morphological phenotypes. As shown in Table II, they segregated in a 148:78:15:2 (wild type:rdd1-1D cngc2-3-like:dnd-like:enhanced dnd phenotype [termed superdnd]; Supplemental Fig. S3) ratio. This observation fits the expected ratio of 36:21:6:1, which was predicted in the case that rdd1 suppresses not only cngc2-conferred, but also cngc4-conferred, phenotypes and even the cngc2 cncg4 double mutation, which has been reported to enhance the dnd phenotype (Table II; Supplemental Fig. S3; CITATION). In addition, the data suggest that the single rdd1-1D mutation does not cause a significant morphological difference compared with the Col wild type. This was confirmed by the phenotypes of F1 plants generated from a cross between rdd1-1D cngc2-3 and the Col wild type (Supplemental Fig. S4). The T-DNA insertion status in all 78 individuals exhibiting rdd1-1D cngc2-3-like morphology was analyzed, and the repression of the cngc4 mutant as well as cngc2 cncg4 double mutant phenotypes by rdd1-1D were confirmed (Supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, the data indicate that the rdd1-1D mutation also suppresses cngc4 (hlm1/dnd2)-conferred morphological phenotypes to the same degree as cngc2-conferred phenotypes. To assess the effect of rdd1-1D on dnd2/cngc4, we isolated rdd1-1D cngc4-5 double mutants (Supplemental Fig. S3)from the above F2 plants. The rdd1-1D cngc4-5 double mutant displayed the same phenotype as rdd1-1D cngc2-3 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the rdd1-1D mutation also suppresses cngc4 phenotypes. To examine the effect of the mutation on cngc4 (hlm1/dnd2)-conferred autoimmune phenotypes, we first monitored HR induction upon infection with Psg avrRpt2+ in rdd1-1D cngc4-5 plants. At 24 h post inoculation, Col wild-type leaves displayed visible leaf collapse, whereas rdd1-1D cngc4-5, cngc4-5, and dnd2 leaves did not (Fig. 5B). For further evaluation, HR-induced autofluorescence was monitored. Similar to rdd1-1D cngc2-3, rdd1-1D cngc4-5 leaves displayed a marked increase in autofluorescence compared with cngc4 and dnd2, suggesting that rdd1-1D also suppresses cngc4-mediated alteration in HR (Fig. 5C). Next, we tested for enhanced resistance against virulent H. arabidopsidis, isolate Noco2, on 10-d-old seedlings. At 7 d post inoculation, rdd1-1D cngc4-5 showed a partial breakdown of enhanced resistance similar to rdd1-1D cngc2-3 compared with cngc2-3 and cngc4-5 single mutants (Fig. 5D). As expected, quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR results from 5-week-old leaves showed a marked decrease in PR-1 gene expression in rdd1-1D cngc4-5 compared with cngc4 and dnd2 mutants (Fig. 5E). Delayed flowering was also observed in cngc4-5 and dnd2, and this phenotype was also suppressed in rdd1-1D cngc4-5 (Supplemental Fig. S5). Taken together, rdd1-1D suppresses cngc4-conferred phenotypes to a similar degree to those of cngc2. These results demonstrate that AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 participate in the same signaling pathway in mediating immunity and the floral transition. [[FIGURE]] Animal CNGC subunits have been shown to form heterotetrameric channels at the plasma membrane, where they mediate ion fluxes into the cell. However, the composition of the CNGCs and subunit interactions in plants remain unknown (CITATION). Since the genetic analysis and characterization of rdd1-1D cngc4-5 indicated that RDD1 participates in signaling mediated by both AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4, two possible scenarios arise. One scenario is that AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 subunits form homomeric channels at the plasma membrane to regulate parallel pathways that converge downstream. In this case, the suppression effect by the rdd1 mutation should occur after the convergence of the two pathways. Alternatively, AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 subunits might be partners that form heteromeric channels that regulate one pathway that is affected by the rdd1 mutation. To examine the subunit interactions, FPLC combined with western blotting using recombinantly expressed C-terminal peptides of CNGC2 and CNGC4 was performed (Supplemental Materials and Methods S1). This analysis had previously been used to evaluate the homomeric interaction of the C terminus of CNGC11/12 (same as 12; CITATION). As shown in Supplemental Figure S6, the elution of the C-terminal recombinant proteins resulted in two peaks. The first peak eluted much earlier than the predicted tetramer size (suggesting a mass of more than 200 kD), indicating multimerization or aggregation of peptides. In both cases, the first peak appeared to contain full-length recombinant proteins, while the second peak was eluted between 45 and 50 kD, corresponding to the size of the tags, glutathione S-transferase (25 kD, which forms a dimer in solution) and maltose-binding protein (45 kD), for CNGC2 and CNGC4, respectively. Fractions corresponding to these peaks were collected separately and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting using anti-glutathione S-transferase or anti-maltose-binding protein antibodies. Signals were detected in both peaks, and the size of the band confirmed that the first peak contained multimers or aggregates of CNGC2 or CNGC4 peptides and the second peak contained truncated tags only (Supplemental Fig. S6). In our previous work with CNGC12 (11/12), a similar multimer peak was observed, and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the interaction of the subunits (CITATION). Thus, the data here also indicate the possibility of an interaction of CNGC2 and CNGC4. However, we cannot rule out that CNGC2 and CNGC4 monomeric aggregates merely coelute in the first peak. Thus, to evaluate the subunit interaction further, BiFC was conducted with full-length CNGC2 and CNGC4 in planta. For this analysis, full-length AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 were fused C terminally to the N- and C-terminal portions of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; YFPN and YFPC, respectively) and transiently coexpressed under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in N. benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration. This method has been used to evaluate the in planta subunit interaction of plant CNGCs (CITATION). At 48 h post infiltration, weak but reproducible fluorescence was detected with AtCNGC2-YFPN + AtCNGC4-YFPC coexpression, indicating that AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 subunits are able to form heteromeric channels (Fig. 6A). Reciprocal coexpression showed similar results (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, AtCNGC2-YFPN + AtCNGC2-YFPC and AtCNGC4-YFPN + AtCNGC4-YFPC combinations also produced weak but detectable fluorescence, indicating that AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 subunits are able to form homomeric channels (Fig. 6, C and D). YFP signals were not observed in single infiltrations of each construct (Fig. 6, E–H). Furthermore, coinfiltration of an unrelated subunit, AtCNGC11/12, with CNGC2 or CNGC4 did not show any signals, whereas AtCNGC11/12 can interact with itself (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, Supplemental Fig. S7, A–E). Since the expression of full-length YFP-tagged AtCNGC2, AtCNGC4, and AtCNGC11/12 was very comparable, the signal we observed with coexpressed CNGC2 and CNGC4 cannot be simply due to the overexpression by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Supplemental Fig. S7, F–H). We also note that it is almost impossible to visualize CNGC expression by fluorescent proteins using a weak promoter, since their expression is very low or unstable. In addition, the interaction with other unrelated proteins, such as transcription factors and kinases, was also tested. None of these control experiments showed BiFC signals (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the interaction between AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4. Taken together, these results suggest the ability of AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 subunits to form both homomeric and heteromeric channels in planta. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The null mutant for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtCNGC2, dnd1, was originally identified by CITATION and then was called dnd1-1 by CITATION and cngc2-1 by CITATION. We use the original name dnd1 in this paper. Another allele, cngc2-2, was also reported (CITATION); thus, we named our T-DNA insertion line (Salk_066908) cngc2-3. The allelic null mutants for AtCNGC4 have been reported by CITATION as hlm1-1, hlm1-2, and hlm1-3 and as dnd2-1 by CITATION. We used dnd2-1 from CITATION in this paper and used the name dnd2 to avoid confusion. The T-DNA insertion knockout line for AtCNGC4 that was used in this study (Salk_081369) thus was named cngc4-5. The seeds were planted on Sunshine Mix 1 (Sun Gro Horticulture Canada) and stratified at 4°C for 4 d. Plants were either grown in a growth chamber with a 9-h photoperiod (9 h of light/15 h of dark) and a day/night temperature regime of 22°C/18°C or a 16-h photoperiod (16 h of light/8 h of dark) at 22°C. Approximately 10,000 cngc2 T-DNA (Salk_066908) mutant seeds were mutagenized with 0.3% (v/v) ethyl methanesulfonate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 h, followed by rinsing more than 15 times in water. These M0 seeds were grown under ambient humidity for M1 plants. The M2 seeds were collected and then screened for mutants suppressing the dwarf phenotype conferred by the cngc2 mutation. rdd1-1D cngc2-3 was identified based on its intermediate morphology between Col wild-type and cngc2-3 plants. It was backcrossed twice with a homozygous cngc2-3 plant for genetic analysis. Bacterial infection was conducted as reported previously (CITATION) using 5- to 6-week-old plants. Infection with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, isolate Noco2, was performed as described previously with 8 × 105 spores mL−1 (CITATION). Wild-type and mutant plants were grown on 0.5× Murishage and Skoog salt, 2.5 mm MES, 1% (v/w) Suc, and 0.8% agar, pH 5.7. Calcium sensitivity was tested on Murishage and Skoog medium supplemented with 5, 10, and 20 mm CaCl2. All plants were grown under continuous light. Small-scale RNA extraction was carried out using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed as described previously (CITATION) using ELONGATION FACTOR-1α (EF-1α) gene expression for normalization. Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Endogenous SA was analyzed as described previously (CITATION). For BiFC analysis, full-length AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 complementary DNAs were subcloned into the Gateway entry vector pDONR221 (Invitrogen; http://www.invitrogen.com). Subsequently, all clones were subcloned into the destination vectors for plant expression, pK2GWYn9 (nYFP), pL2GWYc9 (cYFP), or pEARLEY101 (full-length YFP, controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter; CITATION) using LR Clonase (Invitrogen; http://www.invitrogen.com) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All constructed plasmids were sequenced for fidelity. Constructs were then transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV2260. Individual colonies were grown for 20 h at 30°C in Luria-Bertani medium and then subcultured into medium 1 (Luria-Bertani medium, 10 mm MES, and 20 μm acetosyringone) for 20 h. Cultures were then washed in infiltration medium (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES, and 150 μm acetosyringone) and resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. Cultures were incubated overnight at room temperature and syringe infiltrated into 6-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. N- and C- terminal YFP fusions were coinfiltrated with HC-Pro of Tobacco etch virus. Leaf discs of infiltrated areas were excised 48 h after inoculation and used for confocal microscopy. HR-associated autofluorescence was monitored using the fluorescein isothiocyanate/GFP filter on the Leica DMI3000 inverted microscope. Confocal fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system with the acousto-optical beam splitter (HCX PL APO CS 40x immersion oil objective; numerical aperture, 1.25) with the acousto-optic tunable filter for the argon laser set at 20% and the detection window at 525 to 600 nm for YFP (Leica Microsystems). Autofluorescence of chloroplasts was detected at 650 to 700 nm.
