!~ABS~! SNAREs are important components of the vesicle trafficking machinery in eukaryotic cells. In plants, SNAREs have been found to play a variety of roles in the development and physiology of the whole organism. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel plant-specific SNARE, NPSN11, a member of a closely related small gene family in Arabidopsis. NSPN11 is highly expressed in actively dividing cells. In a subcellular fractionation experiment, NSPN11 cofractionates with the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin, KNOLLE, which is required for the formation of the cell plate. By immunofluorescence microscopy, NSPN11 was localized to the cell plate in dividing cells. Consistent with the localization studies, NSPN11 was found to interact with KNOLLE. Our results suggest that NPSN11 is another component of the membrane trafficking and fusion machinery involved in cell plate formation.
!~RES~! Extensive searches of the Arabidopsis genome identified 55 genes encoding putative SNAREs. One gene family, NPSN, is composed of three genes. The proteins encoded by these genes share approximately 61% to 92% identity among each other and with predicted members from other plants. However, this family has no close relatives in other kingdoms. In phylogenetic analysis, these proteins lie closest to the mammalian VTI1b group of SNAREs, although they share only a low level of homology (Fig. 1). On the other hand, other putative Arabidopsis SNARE families, such as the MEMBRIN- or GOS1-like groups, share branches with their likely orthologs (Fig. 1; for further discussion, see CITATION). For these reasons we felt this group was unique to the plant kingdom and decided to study these SNAREs in more detail.  [[FIGURE]] We first determined whether members of this gene family were expressed and, if so, whether there was any tissue-specific distribution of the messages. Using equal amounts of total RNA extracted from various tissues as a template, we performed reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis with primers specific for each NPSN gene.NPSN11 and NPSN12 cDNAs can be amplified as 800- to 1,000-bp fragments from most tissues, although no expression ofNPSN13 was detected (Fig. 2A). Similar amounts of NPSN12 RT-PCR products were found in all these tissues. It is likely that NPSN12 was expressed at nearly equal levels in all tissues that we examined. The highest level of NPSN11 expression was found in the upper most portion of stems (without flowers: Fig. 2A, column 8). In addition,NPSN11 expression was detected in actively dividing tissues including roots, young leaves, flowers, and siliques (Fig. 2A, columns 3 and 6). In contrast, only low levels of NPSN11 were detected in mature rosette leaves (Fig. 2A, column 5). We were unable to detect NPSN13 expression in any of the tissues that we examined, although a full-length cDNA for this gene (Ceres_114054) is present in the Arabidopsis sequence database. One explanation for this difference is that NPSN13 may be expressed at a low level or in a restricted tissue distribution not covered in our analysis.  [[FIGURE]] To further aid our studies, we also raised an antiserum to the N-terminal portion of the NPSN11 protein. NSPN11 is predicted to encode a protein of 265 amino acids with estimated molecular mass of 29.7 kD. In protein extracts of wild-type plants separated by SDS-PAGE, these antibodies, however, detected a polypeptide of approximately 36 kD. This is typical of the Arabidopsis SNAREs, which tend to run as larger proteins (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In addition, the NSPN11 antisera also recognized an approximately 41-kD polypeptide by immunoblotting that was, however, not immunoprecipitated by the NPSN11 antibodies (see Fig. 6). The 41-kD polypeptide was also not observed by immunoblotting after the antiserum was affinity purified for immunolocalization studies (Fig. 2B). Further evidence that the 36-kD protein corresponds to NPSN11 is provided in the next section (see Fig. 3B). The NPSN11 protein was found in protein extracts from most tissues, with the lowest levels found in mature leaves, consistent with the mRNA expression results (Fig. 2B). This pattern of protein expression is similar to that of the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin, KNOLLE, which is highly expressed in tissues that contain actively dividing cells (CITATION;CITATION). As a control, SYP71, a syntaxin type SNARE previously shown to be expressed in most tissues (CITATION), was found at approximately equal levels in these extracts.  [[FIGURE]] We have identified one npsn11::T-DNA (npsn11-1) insertion line in the SIGnAL (SALK Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory) database of sequenced T-DNA mutagenized Arabidopsis lines (See Fig. 3A). The T-DNA was inserted in the first intron of NPSN11. Homozygous npsn11-1 plants showed no obvious phenotypes and were completely fertile. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of NPSN11 was abolished in homozygous plants (data not shown), and western-blot analysis of protein extracts prepared from mutant and wild-type siblings showed that only the 36-kD band recognized by NSPN11 antisera was absent from the homozygous npsn11 lines (Fig. 3B). These results confirmed the specificity of the NPSN11-antibodies for the 36-kD protein and that the antibodies did not cross-react with the other members of the NPSN protein family. To further characterize NPSN11, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of the protein by subcellular fractionation. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared from 21-d-old Arabidopsis roots and fractionated on a discontinuous Accudenz density gradient (see “Materials and Methods”). The gradient was equilibrated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 16 h at 4°C, and 22 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom. These fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to NPSN11 and various endomembrane markers. The density gradient fractionation conditions were chosen to differentiate between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the prevacuolar compartment (PVC), using marker syntaxins for each compartment (SYP21 and SYP41, respectively; CITATION). For example, the SNARE VTI11, previously shown to cofractionate with PVC markers (CITATION), has a single peak at a density of 1.125 mg mL−1. On the other hand, a related SNARE, VTI12 was detected in two peaks; one corresponding to the PVC and another that equilibrated at a density of approximately 1.175 mg mL−1 (Fig. 4). This second peak cofractionated with ELP, a TGN marker as shown by previous subcellular fractionation experiments (CITATION). As shown in Figure 4, membranes containing NPSN11 did not cofractionate with VTI11, VTI12, or ELP. NPSN11 also did not cofractionate with the vacuolar marker aleurain (data not shown). The highest level of NSPN11 was found in fractions with an approximate density of 1.15 mg mL−1 (Fig. 4). These results indicate that NPSN11 is not associated with the TGN, the PVC, or the vacuole. The fractionation pattern of NPSN11 closely resembles that of KNOLLE, suggesting that NSPN11 and KNOLLE may reside on the same membrane compartment.  [[FIGURE]] Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we further examined the localization of NSPN11 in dividing and non-dividing Arabidopsis cells. Protoplasts from actively dividing Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified NSPN11 and KNOLLE antibodies. Western-blot analysis of total Arabidopsis protein extracts confirmed that affinity-purified NSPN11 and KNOLLE antibodies are highly specific and cross-react only with their appropriate 36- and 34-kD polypeptides, respectively (data not shown). During cytokinesis, cell plate vesicles are targeted to and fuse within the equatorial plane of the phragmoplast. Previous localization studies have demonstrated that KNOLLE, which is required for cell plate membrane fusion, is localized within the phragmoplast mid-plane in dividing Arabidopsis cells (CITATION; see also Fig. 5N). Similarly, we have observed that NSPN11 is targeted to cell plate during cytokinesis (Fig. 5D). NSPN11 was also found to be associated with newly completed cross wall plasma membranes that separate two recently divided cells (Fig. 5I). However, only low levels of NSPN11 were detected in the mature plasma membrane. In addition to their association with the cell plate, we have also observed significant anti-NSPN11 and anti-KNOLLE immunolabeling of punctate subcellular organelles. These structures do not correspond to Golgi stacks as shown by immunolabeling with affinity-purified antibodies to the Arabidopsis Golgi-resident marker protein α-mannosidase (data not shown). The identity of these NSPN11 and KNOLLE positive subcellular structures remains to be defined.  [[FIGURE]] The above observations suggest that both KNOLLE and NSPN11 are targeted to the division plane during cytokinesis. A critical question remaining to be addressed was whether KNOLLE and NPSN11 physically interact. First, we immunoprecipitated NPSN11 from Triton X-100 solubilized membranes prepared in the presence of EDTA from 5-d-old Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells. As shown in Figure6A, the 36-kD NPSN11 polypeptide was detected by immunoblotting in the eluate from the anti-NSPN11 column but not from the control preimmune column. The 41-kD polypeptide that cross-reacted with anti-NSPN11 in the total protein extract did not immunoprecipitate with the 36-kD NPSN 11 polypeptide, again indicating that it has a distinct origin than the NPSN11 protein. Interestingly, KNOLLE was detected by immunoblotting in the NSPN11 antibody column eluate (Fig. 6A). The amount of KNOLLE immunoprecipitated in these experiments is small, although this is typical of SNARE-SNARE interactions as reported by many researchers in many eukaryotes (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In contrast, SYP21, a PVC syntaxin, was not precipitated by either the preimmune or anti-NPSN11 column. The polypeptide observed in the anti-NSPN11 eluate that was recognized by anti-SYP21 is likely to be a non-specific band because this polypeptide is not the correct size for SYP21 and was not reproducibly observed in other experiments (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments using SYP21 antiserum confirmed that SYP21 did not interact with either NPSN11 or KNOLLE (CITATION; A.A. Sanderfoot, unpublished data). Two other proteins, VTI12 (Fig. 6A) and VPS45 (data not shown), were also not found to be immunoprecipitated with NPSN11. To confirm that the physical interaction between NPSN11 and KNOLLE is genuine, we performed the reverse experiment: KNOLLE was first immunoprecipitated from a detergent-solubilized Arabidopsis membrane extract, and the eluate was analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 6B, NPSN11 co-immunoprecipitated with KNOLLE, whereas another SNARE, VTI12 (data not shown), was not detected in the anti-KNOLLE column eluate. These complementary experiments suggest that NPSN11 specifically interacts with KNOLLE, the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin in vivo.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative and associated cDNA sequencing projects have produced accessions supported by full-length cDNAs forNPSN11 and NPSN13 that are available in the database (AF439822 and NM_112623, respectively). Because our RT-PCR products matched these sequences, we did not resubmit our sequences. The splicing of the NPSN12 cDNA was incorrectly predicted by the Genome Initiative, thus, we submitted our cDNA asAF487545. The protein sequences of representative SNAREs from several eukaryotes were acquired from GenBank as follows: Arabidopsis (Arath) GOS11, AF357528; GOS12, AF357529; MEMB11, AAD31575; MEMB12, BAB09463; VTI11, AAF24061; VTI12, AAF24062; VTI13, BAB01986; NPSN11, AAL27494; NPSN12, AF487545; and NPSN13, NP_566578. Yeast (Sacce) Gos1p, NP_011832; Bos1p, NP_013179; and Vti1p, NP_013924. Human (Homsa) GS28, NP_004862; Membrin, NP_004278; VTI1a, AAH17052; and VTI1b, NP_006361. Mouse (Musmu) GS28, NP_058090; Membrin, NP_062624; VTI1a, AAC23482; and VTI1b, AAC23483. The protein sequences were aligned by the CLUSTALW algorithm, and a phylogenetic tree was visualized using TreeView (Rod Page, http://taxonomy. zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/rod.html) and prepared as a figure using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA).  NPSN11 and NPSN12 cDNA clones were generated by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from seedlings. The primers used for this purpose were: For NPSN11: forward primer, 5′-CTG GGA ATC TGT GTA AAG ATG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATG ACT AAG GG AGG ATC AAG-3′. For NPSP12: forward primer, 5′-GAG CCT GAA ATA ATC CGG CAG AT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGT GTA ATA TGC ACC AAA CC-3′. For NPSN13: forward primer, 5′-CTG AAT TGT CTC CGG CGA CAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAT CCA TGA AAT GGA TTG TT-3′. The PCR fragment was blunted by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cloned intoEcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For Escherichia coli overexpression of 6×-His-NPSN11, the BamHI and SacI (blunt) fragments ofNPSN11 cDNA were subcloned into pET14b (BamHI and BLP1 [blunt], Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for overexpression. For generating a glutathione-S-transferase fusion of NPSN11, theEcoRI-XhoI fragment from pBluescript-NPSN11 was inserted intoEcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX5x-1 (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala) to generate in frame fusions. An Arabidopsis NPSN11 T-DNA insertion line (JP64_8E02) was identified among a collection of sequence-index T-DNA insertion lines. The mutant was generated in the Columbia-0 background using the binary vector pROK2 (CITATION). To identify homozygous plants, the presence of the wild-type and mutant gene was analyzed in the progeny of the individual T1 plants known to contain the insertion. Genomic DNA was prepared from individual T2 plants using the cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide procedure (CITATION). Two gene-specific primers (5′-end gene-specific primer, 5′-TGA TTT CCC TAT CGA AAT CTT-3′; 3′-end gene-specific primer, 5′-GCT TGA TCT GTG TCT TCC ATC A-3′) flanking the insertion site and the T-DNA specific primer (left border, 5′-GCG TGG ACC GCT TGC TCG AAC T-3′) were used to identify homozygous mutant plants. PCR amplification of genomic DNA was performed using tag polymerase (Invitrogen) following the standard condition recommended by the manufacturer. Homozygous seeds derived from this line have been deposited into the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University, Columbus) collection. 6×-His-tagged NPSN11 was overexpressed by isopropylthio-β-galactoside induction. The His-tagged protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) column under standard conditions and injected into a rabbit for antibody production. SYP21 rabbit antiserum was described byCITATION. AtELP rabbit antiserum and preimmune serum were described by CITATION. AtVTI11 antiserum was described by CITATION. AtVTI12 antiserum was described by CITATION. Preparation of affinity-purified KNOLLE antiserum is described by D.R. Rancour, C. Dickey, S. Park, and S.Y. Bednarek (unpublished data). For immunofluorescence microscopy, NPSN11 antiserum was affinity purified against E. coli-expressed glutathione-S-transferase fusion of NPSN11 as described previously (CITATION). To make antibody columns for immunoprecipitation, IgG from NPSN11 preimmune serum, anti-NPSN serum, or anti-KNOLLE serum was purified by protein A affinity columns. The protein concentration of purified antibodies was determined by Bradford dye binding procedure (CITATION). Two milligrams of purified antibodies were incubated with 1.0 mL of immobilized Protein A-6MB (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed with 10 mL of coupling buffer (200 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0), dimethyl pimelimidate was added (5 mg mL−1 final concentration), and the suspension was incubated at 20°C for 30 min. The coupling reaction was terminated with 0.2 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0), and the beads were stored in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at 4°C. Twenty grams of 5-d-old suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells was homogenized on ice with 5 mL of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.4m Suc) with Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, Indianapolis). To prepare total membranes, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g for 15 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 3 h. The total membrane pellet was homogenized in 3 mL of Tris-buffered saline (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with miniComplete tablet (Roche), solubilized by the addition of Triton X-100 (1% [v/v] final concentration), and cleared of insoluble material by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 30 min. The clarified supernatant was incubated with the immobilized antibodies for 2 h at 4°C. The antibody columns were washed five times with 5 mL of Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBS + 1% [v/v] Triton X-100), and specifically bound proteins were eluted with 4 mL of 0.1m Gly (pH 2.5). The eluted proteins were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (10% [w/v] final concentration), and the precipitates were sedimented at 10,000g for 30 min at 4°C. After two acetone washes, the protein pellet was solubilized in 50 μL of 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described by CITATION. Ten grams of 21-d-old Arabidopsis-cultured roots was used to prepare total membrane using the same procedure for membrane preparation from suspension cells as described above. The total membrane was then layered on top of a discontinuous Accudenz (Accurate Chemicals and Scientific Corp., New York) gradient (1.5 mL of each: 2%, 5%, 9%, 12%, 15%, 20%, and 30% [w/w] from the top to the bottom). The gradient was then equilibrated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 16 h. Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected from the top to the bottom. The densities of different fractions were measured by refractometry and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to visualize different subcellular markers. Preparation and immunostaining of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cell protoplasts was performed essentially as described by CITATION with the exception that the fixed protoplasts were permeabilized in microtubule stabilizing buffer (MTSB;CITATION; 50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm EGTA) containing 0.5% (v/v) NP-40 and 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in suspension for 5 min at room temperature. The permeabilized cells were collected by centrifugation at 200g for 2 min at room temperature, washed three times with 1.0 mL of MTSB, plated on ProbeOn Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh), and allowed to air dry. The cells were rehydrated and blocked with MTSB containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. All subsequent immunolabeling steps, epifluorescence microscopy, and image processing were performed as described (CITATION).
