!~ABS~! The retromer complex is responsible for retrograde transport, which is coordinated with anterograde transport in the secretory pathway including vacuolar protein sorting. Yeast VPS35 is a component of the retromer complex that is essential for recognition of specific cargo molecules. The physiological function of VPS35 has not been determined in vacuolar protein sorting in higher organisms. Arabidopsis thaliana has three VPS35 homologs designated VPS35a, VPS35b and VPS35c. We isolated four vps35 mutants (vps35a-1, vps35b-1, vps35b-2 and vps35c-1) and then generated four double mutants and one triple mutant. vps35a-1 vps35c-1 exhibited no unusual phenotypes. On the other hand, vps35b-1 vps35c-1 and the triple mutant (vps35a-1 vps35b-2 vps35c-1) exhibited severe phenotypes: dwarfism, early leaf senescence and fragmentation of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). In addition, these mutants mis-sorted storage proteins by secreting them out of the cells and accumulated a higher level of vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) than the wild type. VPS35 was localized in pre-vacuolar compartments (PVCs), some of which contained VSR. VPS35 was immunoprecipitated with VPS29/MAG1, another component of the retromer complex. Our findings suggest that VPS35, mainly VPS35b, is involved in sorting proteins to PSVs in seeds, possibly by recycling VSR from PVCs to the Golgi complex, and is also involved in plant growth and senescence in vegetative organs.
!~RES~! Fig. 1A shows a phylogenetic tree of VPS35 proteins that are well conserved in various organisms. Arabidopsis has three genes (At1g75850, At2g17790 and At3g51310), each of which is homologous to yeast VPS35 encoding a member of the retromer complex. We designated them as VPS35a, VPS35b and VPS35c, respectively. We isolated cDNAs of VPS35a, VPS35b and VPS35c from total mRNAs of leaves and determined the cDNA sequences. VPS35a consists of 22 exons that encode a 790 amino acid protein, VPS35b consists of 21 exons that encode a 787 amino acid protein. VPS35c consists of 21 exons that encode a 790 amino acid protein.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The physiological function of VPS35 is not known in higher organisms. We applied a reverse genetic analysis with VPS35-deficient mutants to determine this function. We isolated four T-DNA-inserted mutants (vps35a-1, vps35b-1, vps35b-2 and vps35c-1) (Fig. 1B). However, all of these mutants exhibited no visible defects (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, by crossing two of these single mutants, we generated four double vps35 mutants (vps35a-1 vps35b-2, vps35a-1 vps35c-1, vps35b-1 vps35c-1 and vps35b-2 vps35c-1) and designated them here as vps35 a-1b-2, vps35 a-1c-1, vps35 b-1c-1 and vps35 b-2c-1, respectively. To see the expression levels of the respective transcripts, the primer sets as shown in Fig. 1B were used for reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) of total mRNA from leaves of double mutants. The primer set F1 and R1 gave no signal for vsp35 a-1b-2 and vsp35 a-1c-1 and the primer set F3 and R3 gave no signal for vsp35 a-1c-1, vsp35 b-1c-1 and vsp35 b-2c-1 (Fig. 1C). The results suggest that both vps35a-1 and vps35c-1 are null mutant alleles. On the other hand, vps35 a-1b-2 and vps35 b-2c-1 gave weaker signals with the primer set F5 and R5 than vps35 b-1c-1 and the wild type (Fig. 1C). This result indicates that vps35b-2 is a leaky allele, possibly because of occasional removal of the T-DNA by splicing. This is supported by the result of immunoblotting with anti-VPS35b antibody (see Fig. 7A). The result further indicates that vps35b-1 is a null mutant (see Fig. 7A).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] vps35 b-1c-1 exhibited a dwarf phenotype (Fig. 2G, H), as did vps29-1/mag1-1 (Fig. 2K, L). This result is consistent with the fact that VPS29/MAG1 is a homolog of another component of the yeast retromer complex (Seaman et al. CITATION, Shimada et al. CITATION). However, the allelic mutant, vps35 b-2c-1, did not exhibit dwarfism (Fig. 2E, F), reflecting a leaky phenotype of vps35b-2. These results indicate that VPS35b is involved in plant growth. In contrast, vps35 a-1c-1 grew normally as the wild type (Fig. 2A, B, I, J). Considering that vps35a-1 and vps35c-1 are null mutant alleles, neither VPS35a nor VPS35c might contribute to plant growth.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Fig. 3A shows 34-day-old plants of vps35 b-1c-1 and the wild type that were grown on the same plate. vps35 b-1c-1 plants exhibited not only dwarfism and but also early leaf senescence. vps35 b-1c-1 senesced earlier than the leaky allele vps35 b-2c-1 (Fig. 2F, H). In contrast, none of the other double mutants showed early senescence (Fig. 2B, D). These results suggest that VPS35b is primarily responsible for retarding the senescence of leaves.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To see what happens in mutant plants that lack all VPS35 genes, we further tried to generate triple mutants by crosses between vps35 a-1 and vps35 b-1c-1 and between vps35 a-1b-2 and vps35 b-2c-1, respectively. Finally, we obtained vps35a-1 vps35b-2 vps35c-1 (designated as vps35 a-1b-2c-1), but were not able to obtain vps35a-1 vps35b-1 vps35c-1. This is consistent with the finding that vps35b-2 is a leaky allele, while vps35b-1 is a null allele that expressed no VPS35b protein (see Fig. 7A). The growth failure of vps35 a-1b-2c-1 on plates varied on a plant by plant basis (Fig. 3B). The most severe failure was seedling lethal (Fig. 3B, vps35 a-1b-2c-1, the rightmost plant). All plants of vps35 a-1b-2c-1 showed accelerated leaf senescence (Fig. 3B). vps35 a-1b-2c-1 exhibited a defect of embryogenesis, the level of which varied in single siliques: some seeds were dead, some seeds were apparently aborted and some seeds looked as healthy as wild-type seeds (Fig. 3C). The variety of failures in plant growth and embryogenesis of vps35 a-1b-2c-1 might be due to a variety of leaked expression levels of VPS35b. The overall results suggest that VPS35b is of principal importance among three VPS35 genes in plant viability. The above results show that VPS35b plays important roles in plant growth, leaf senescence, embryogenesis and vacuolar biogenesis. Thus, we focused on VPS35b and raised a specific antibody against the VPS35b protein. Anti-VPS35b antibody gave an ∼90 kDa signal on the blot of the leaf extract from the wild type, but no signal on the blot of the extract from vps35b-1 (M. Yamazaki et al. unpublished data). The molecular mass agrees with that of 89,492 Da estimated from the VPS35b cDNA sequence. Yeast Vps35p is known to interact directly with Vsp29p and to function as a component of the retromer complex. On the other hand, little is known about their endogenous interactions among possible retromer components in multicellular organisms including animals and plants. Previously, we reported that Arabidopsis VPS29/MAG1 is also essential for plant viability (Shimada et al. CITATION), as is VPS35. To determine whether VPS29/MAG1 and VPS35 function in a coordinated manner within plant cells, we subjected extracts from 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants to immunoprecipitation and then subjected both the immunoprecipitated and unprecipitated fractions to immunoblot. Immunoprecipitates with anti-VPS29/MAG1 and VPS35b antibodies gave positive signals on the immunoblot with anti-VPS29/MAG1 and VPS35b antibodies, respectively (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that these antibodies were suitable for this experiment.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Immunoprecipitation with anti-VPS35b antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-VPS29/MAG1 antibody gave a signal in the immunoprecipitated fraction (Fig. 4, lane 4), but no signal in the unprecipitated fraction (Fig. 4, lane 3). When pre-immune serum was used for immunoprecipitation, none of VPS29/MAG1 was precipitated (Fig. 4, lane 2). The result clearly shows that most VPS29/MAG1 molecules were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-VPS35b antibody, suggesting that VPS35 interacts with VPS29/MAG1 in vivo. The involvement of VPS35 in embryogenesis (Fig. 3C) implied that VPS35 is expressed in siliques and/or maturing seeds. Immunoblot analysis with anti-VPS35b antibody revealed that VPS35b appeared in flower buds and in the siliques at the early and middle stages of seed maturation and then decreased in association with the appearance of the truncated form at the late stage of seed maturation (Fig. 5, seed maturation; F and M1–M13). VPS35b was also detected in seeds (Fig. 5, D). The accumulation levels decreased gradually during seed imbibition (Fig. 5, imbibition; I0–I3) and then increased again after seed germination (germination; G1–G6).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] What is the physiological function of VPS35 at the subcellular level in maturing seeds? We found that the sizes of PSVs in vps35 b-1c-1 seeds were much smaller than those in wild-type seeds, while the numbers of PSVs in a single cell of vps35 b-1c-1 were much larger than those in a single cell of the wild type (Fig. 6). The phenotype of PSVs in vps35 b-1c-1 was similar to that in vps29-1/mag1-1. Another allelic double mutant vps35 b-2c-1 exhibited a milder phenotype of PSVs than vps35 b-1c-1 (Fig. 6). Neither vps35 a-1c-1 nor vps35 a-1b-2 had a defect in biogenesis of PSVs in seeds (Fig. 6). These results suggest that VPS35b works cooperatively with VPS29/MAG1 in the biogenesis of PSVs.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Our anti-VPS35b antibody gave a major ∼90 kDa signal on the blot of wild-type seeds (Fig. 7A, WT), as on the blot of vegetative tissues (M. Yamazaki et al. unpublished data). Both ∼65 kDa and ∼30 kDa proteins were truncated forms of VPS35b that were linked by one or more disulfide bonds (M. Yamazaki et al. unpublished data). Seeds of vps35a-1, vps35c-1 and vps35 a-1c-1 accumulated the same amounts of VPS35b and the truncated forms as wild-type seeds. The vps35b-1 mutants (vps35b-1 and vps35 b-1c-1) expressed no VPS35b in seeds (Fig. 7A), indicating that vps35b-1 is a null mutant allele. On the other hand, the vsp35b-2 mutants (vps35b-2, vps35 a-1b-2, vps35 b-2c-1 and vps35 a-1b-2c-1) expressed a small amount of VPS35b (Fig. 7A), indicating that vsp35b-2 is a leaky allele. This result is consistent with the weak expression of VPS35b mRNA in leaves (discussed above, Fig. 1C). Seeds of vps29-1/mag1-1, which lacks VPS29/MAG1 that interacts with VPS35, accumulated a lower level of VPS35b than wild-type seeds (Fig. 7A). This result was consistent with our previous report (Shimada et al. CITATION), suggesting that deficiency of VPS29/MAG1 affects the accumulation level of VPS35b. To see an effect of a defect of the retromer on the accumulation of VSR1, we performed an immunoblot of vps35 and vps29/mag1 seeds with anti-VSR antibody. We found that the levels of VSR1 were higher in vsp35 b-1c-1 and vps35 a-1b-2c-1 than in the wild type and the other mutants (Fig. 7B). The increased accumulation is not obvious in vps35 b-2c-1 (Fig. 7B), suggesting that VPS35b is more important than the other two VPS35s for the VSR1 accumulation (discussed below). Similarly, vps29-1/mag1-1 accumulated a higher level of VSR1 in seeds. This result suggests that VPS35b works cooperatively with VPS29/MAG1 in the VSR1 accumulation. We performed SDS-PAGE followed by either coomassie blue staining or an immunoblot of seeds of vps35 mutants with antibodies against major storage proteins, 12S globulin and 2S albumin. Wild-type seeds accumulated the mature forms of 12S globulin (α and β subunits) and 2S albumin (L and S subunits) (Fig. 8A, WT) but they accumulated no precursors of these storage proteins. Similarly, no precursors were accumulated in seeds of the single mutants (vps35a-1, vps35b-1, vps35b-2 and vps35c-1) or of two of the double mutants (vsp35 a-1b-2 and vps35 a-1c-1) (Fig. 8B).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, the precursors of storage proteins were abnormally accumulated in seeds of two of the double mutants (vps35 b-1c-1 and vps35 b-2c-1) (Fig. 8B, C) and the triple mutant vps35 a-1b-2c-1 (Fig. 8A–C). vps35 b-1c-1 accumulated a larger amount of the precursors in seeds than vps35 b-2c-1 (Fig. 8B, C). The accumulation levels of the precursors varied in seeds of vps35 b-2c-1 and vps35 a-1b-2c-1 (M. Yamazaki et al. unpublished data), because of the leaky allele of vps35 b-2 (Fig. 7A). These results suggest that VPS35b is involved in vacuolar sorting of storage proteins in maturing seeds. Previously, we reported that vps29/mag1 exhibits a defect of vacuolar sorting in seeds, resulting in abnormal accumulation of precursors of storage proteins (Shimada et al. CITATION). An immunoblot showed that the accumulation of precursors in seeds of vps29-1/mag1-1 was similar to that of vps35b-1c-1 and vps35 a-1b-2c-1 (Fig. 8B, C). This implied that VPS35 and VPS29/MAG1 function in vacuolar sorting of storage proteins in a coordinated manner. Our results show that VPS35b is involved in plant growth, leaf senescence, biogenesis of PSVs and vacuolar protein sorting. However, in view of the fact that the single mutants vps35b-1 and vps35b-2 had no unusual phenotypes (Fig. 8B, C and Supplementary Fig. S2) either VPS35a or VPS35c compensates for the lack of VPS35b. To confirm the responsibility of VPS35a and VPS35c, we obtained ∼100 siblings that were generated from either vsp35a-1 (+/−) vps35b-1 (+/−) or vsp35b-1 (+/−) vps35c-1 (+/−), and investigated the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype for each grain of these sibling seeds (Table 1).  The number of vps35b-1(−/−) siblings was much lower than expected, suggesting that VPS35b is involved in fertilization or embryogenesis. We obtained no homozygous double mutants of vps35 a-1 (−/−) vps35b-1 (−/−) and fewer than expected mutants of vps35 a-1 (+/−) vps35b-1 (−/−). On the other hand, we obtained fewer than expected mutants of vps35 b-1 (−/−) vps35c-1 (−/−) and vps35 b-1 (−/−) vps35c-1 (+/−). These results suggest the responsibility of VPS35a and VPS35c for the lack of VPS35b during fertilization or embryogenesis. Higher responsibility of VPS35a than VPS35c for seed yields might be reflected by the higher mRNA expression level of VPS35a than of VPS35c in pollen (Schmid et al., CITATION). Immunoblotting of each grain of all siblings revealed that all three siblings of vps35 b-1 (−/−) vps35c-1 (−/−) accumulated 12S globulin precursor, while the rest of the siblings did not (Fig. 9 and Table 1). This result suggests the responsibility of VPS35c for the lack of VPS35b on vacuolar protein sorting.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] vps35 b-1c-1 had a number of small PSVs in seeds (Fig. 6). Electron microscopy revealed that vps35 b-1c-1 exhibited not only fragmentation of PSVs but also fragmentation of oil bodies (Fig. 10B), suggesting that biogenesis of PSVs is closely related to biogenesis of oil bodies, despite the fact that these organelles accumulated different materials: proteins in PSVs and lipids in oil bodies. Furthermore, an electron micrograph shows that the extracellular space of vps35 b-1c-1 seeds was enlarged and was abnormally filled with electron-dense materials (Fig. 10B, open arrowheads), although the extracellular space of wild-type seeds was electron-lucent (Fig. 10A, open arrowheads).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Immunogold analysis of vps35 b-1c-1 seeds with antibodies against storage proteins indicated that the electron-dense material had high concentrations of 12S globulin (Fig. 10D) and 2S albumin (M. Yamazaki et al. unpublished data). The storage proteins were distributed in the PSVs and the electron-dense extracellular space in the vps35 b-1c-1 seeds. These observations indicate that vps35 b-1c-1 mis-sorts the storage proteins by secreting them from cells, resulting in an electron-dense extracellular space in the seeds (Fig. 10B, D). Taken together, these results suggest that VPS35 is involved in proper trafficking of both 12S globulin and 2S albumin to PSVs in the cells of maturing seeds. vps29-1/mag1-1 (Shimada et al. CITATION) and vsr1-2 (Shimada et al. CITATION) were found to accumulate storage protein precursors in their dry seeds, as does vps35 b-1c-1. They mis-sort both 12S globulin and 2S albumin and secrete them out of the cells as vps35 b-1c-1. These data suggest that VPS35 cooperates with VPS29/MAG1-1 and VSR1 in vacuolar sorting of storage proteins. To determine the subcellular localization of VPS35, we performed immunostaining of tobacco BY-2 cells with anti-VPS35 antibody, which gave a single band on the blot of BY-2 cells (Fig. 11D), showing the specificity of the antibody for tobacco VPS35. Double immunostaining with anti-VPS35b antibody and anti-VSR antibody divided the compartments into three types: type-1 compartments with both signals (Fig. 11A, merge, white), type-2 compartments with only a VPS35 signal (Fig. 11A, merge, green) and type-3 compartments with only a VSR signal (Fig. 11A, merge, magenta). This result suggests that VPS35 is partially associated with VSR.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The question was what kind of compartments the VPS35 and VSR co-localized in. Previously, we reported that VSR/PV72 is distributed in both the Golgi complex and PVCs/PAC vesicles (Shimada et al. CITATION). We used a PVC marker PEP12. Double immunostaining with anti-VPS35 antibody and anti-PEP12 antibody showed that VPS35 signals were well co-localized with PEP12 in PVCs (Fig. 11B). To investigate the Golgi localization, we used a fusion protein composed of KAM1ΔC and mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) as a Golgi marker. Previously, we demonstrated that KAM1 is localized in the Golgi complex and KAM1ΔC–mRFP is a useful marker of the Golgi complex (Tamura et al. CITATION). We generated BY-2 cells that expressed KAM1ΔC–mRFP. Immunostaining of the transformed BY-2 cells with antibody against RGP1, a Golgi marker, showed the complete overlap of KAM1ΔC–mRFP and RGP1 (M. Yamazaki et al. unpublished data). Immunostaining with anti-VPS35b antibody revealed that VPS35 signals did not overlap with the Golgi marker (Fig. 11C). This result suggests that VPS35 was not localized in the Golgi complex. Considering these results, type-1 compartments might be PVCs, type-2 compartments might be VPS35-positive and VSR-negative PVCs, and type-3 compartments might be the Golgi complex. The co-localization of VPS35 with VSR implied that these proteins function in vacuolar sorting in a coordinated manner. This was also supported by the result of co-expression of VPS35b at the middle and late stages of seed maturation with VSR (Fig. S3).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were used as wild-type plants. We also used T-DNA-tagged mutants: vps35 mutants (see below), vsr1-2 and vps29-1/mag1-1. Plants were grown as described before (Li et al., CITATION), except for using a half-strength MS medium (Wako, Osaka, Japan). We obtained vps35 mutant seeds from the ABRC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) at Ohio State University according to information from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (http://signal.salk.edu). We isolated four homozygous mutant lines by genotyping and designated them as vps35a-1 (SALK_014345), vps35b-1 (SALK_039689), vps35b-2 (SALK_125271) and vps35c-1 (SALK_099735). By crossing between single mutants, we generated four double mutants (vps35a-1 vps35b-2, vps35a-1 vps35c-1, vps35b-1 vps35c-1 and vps35b-2 vps35c-1) and designated them as vps35 a-1b-2, vps35 a-1c-1, vps35 b-1c-1 and vps35 b-2c-1, respectively. We further generated the triple mutant vps35a-1 vps35b-2 vps35c-1 by crossing vps35 a-1 b-2 and vps35 b-2c-1, and designated it as vps35 a-1b-2c-1. We obtained 96 or 100 sibling seeds that were generated from either vsp35a-1 (+/−) vps35b-1 (+/−) or vsp35b-1 (+/−) vps35c-1 (+/−), respectively. Each one grain of these seeds was homogenized with a solution of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol, according to the method described before (Shimada et al. CITATION). A part (70%) of the extract was subjected to PCR for genotyping and the rest (30%) was subjected to immunoblot with anti-12S globulin antibody. We used anti-VSR1 antibody (Yamada et al. CITATION), anti-VPS35b antibody (Shimada et al. CITATION), anti-VPS29/MAG1 antibody (Shimada et al. CITATION), anti-12S globulin antibody (Shimada et al. CITATION) and anti-2S albumin antibody (Li et al. CITATION). We also used monoclonal antibody against BP-80 (17F9) that was donated by J. C. Rogers (Jiang and Rogers, CITATION) and anti-AtPEP12 antibody that was donated by N. Raikhel (da Silva Conceicao et al. CITATION). For preparation of IgG used in immunocytochemistry, each antiserum of anti-VPS35b antibody, anti-AtPEP12 antibody and monoclonal antibody against BP-80 (17F9) was incubated with protein G–Sepharose FF beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) for 16 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, IgG was detached from the beads with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8 and then neutralized by adding 1 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.8. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (Shimada et al. CITATION), except that 5% (w/v) skim milk was used and the dilutions of the antibodies were as follows: anti-VPS35b antibody (diluted 1 : 5,000), anti-VSR1 antibody (diluted 1 : 10,000), anti-VPS29/MAG1 antibody (diluted 1 : 3,000), anti-12S globulin antibody (diluted 1 : 100,000) and anti-2S albumin (diluted 1 : 10,000). We used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies against rabbit IgG (diluted 5,000-fold; NA934-1ml, lot 350330, GE Healthcare, Cambridge, UK) as secondary antibodies. Signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents (RPN2106, GE Healthcare) and LAS-3000 (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan. We de-probed and re-used blots that had been probed for the first immunoblot. De-probing was done by incubation of blots with stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl, pH6.8, 2% SDS and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) at 55°C for 30 min (http://www.upstate.com/img/pdf/visualizer_manual.pdf). Procedures for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry of dry seeds were essentially the same as those described previously (Shimada et al. CITATION). Ultrathin sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (1200EX; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV. We generated stable transformant tobacco BY-2cells that expressed KAM1ΔC fused with mRFP (KAM1ΔC–mRFP) (Tamura et al. CITATION). For immunostaining, we used the transformed and non-transformed BY-2 cells. The cultured cells at 3 d after inoculation were fixed as described before (Tamura et al. CITATION), and then were attached on MAS (Matsunami adhesive silane)-coated glass slides (Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan). The cells were treated for 10 min with 1% (w/v) cellulase Onozuka RS, 0.1% (w/v) pectolyase y-23, 0.05 M MES-KOH, pH 5.7, and 0.45 M mannitol. After washing with Tris-buffered saline for 5 min three times, the cells were treated with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min and subsequently with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1% (w/v) sheep serum for 30 min. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-VPS35b antibody (diluted 1 : 400) in 5% (w/v) BSA and Tris-buffered saline, washed with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1 : 250; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). For double labeling, the BY-2 cells were incubated with anti-VPS35b antibody and anti-BP-80 monoclonal antibody (17F9, diluted 1 : 100) for 1 h, washed with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated for 30 min with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1 : 250; Molecular Probes). Procedures for another double labeling with two kinds of rabbit polyclonal antibodies were essentially the same as described (Paris et al. CITATION). The cells were incubated with anti-VPS35b antibody for 1 h, washed and then incubated with an excess of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1 : 20) for 1 h. The treated cells were washed and then fixed for 1 h with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 5 mM EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline. After rinsing with the buffer overnight, the cells were incubated with anti-PEP12 antibody for 3 h and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1 : 200) for 3 h. We used a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with the 488 and 543 nm lines of a 40 mW Ar/Kr laser and emission filters (BP 505–530 and LP 505). We used an objective (Plan-Neofluar 40 × 0.75 numerical aperture objective) for Fig. 11B and C and used another objective (Plan-Neofluar 100× 1.3 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective) for Fig. 11A. To detect autofluorescence of PSVs in embryonic axis, we used the same microscope and the 488 nm line of the laser and an emission filter (LP 505) with a water immersion objective (C-Apochromat 63× 1.2 numerical aperture). Image analysis was performed using LSM image examiner software (Carl Zeiss). The data were exported as 8 bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems, Tokyo, Japan). Total RNA was isolated using a kit (RNeasy plant mini kit, QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was performed using Ready-To-Go TM RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) with oligo(dT)12–18 primer. We performed PCR of 30 cycles. Primer sets used are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Homozygous mutants were identified by PCR-based genotyping with total genomic DNA that had been isolated from Arabidopsis plants. We performed PCR of 40 cycles. Primer sets used were F6/R6 for VPS35a-1, F2/R2 for VPS35b-1, F5/R5 for VPS35b-2, F7/R3 for VPS35c-1, LBa for T-DNA insert detection, LBa/R6 for vps35a-1, LBa/R2 for vps35b-1, LBa/R5 for vps35b-2 and F7/LBa for vps35c-1 (Supplementary Table 1). Arabidopsis tissues including leaves, stalks and flowers were homogenized and solubilized in a solution that contained 0.1% (v/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 50 mM NaCl and phosphate-buffered saline. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000×g with a cell strainer for 5 min at room temperature to remove cellular debris. The extracts were incubated with each antibody or the respective pre-immune serum (diluted 1 : 50) at 4°C for 16 h and then incubated with protein G–Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing, the Sepharose beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer that contained 4% (v/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot with either anti-VPS29/MAG1 antibody (diluted 1 : 3,000) or anti-VPS35b antibody (diluted 1 : 5,000). Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers for the genes mentioned in this article are as follows: VPS35a (AT1G75850), VPS35b (AT2G17790), VPS35c (AT3G51310), VPS29/MAG1 (AT3G47810) and VSR1 (AT3G52850).
