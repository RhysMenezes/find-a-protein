!~ABS~! Heat shock transcription factor (HSF), an evolutionarily conserved heat-responsive regulator, binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) comprising continuous inverted repeats of the pentamer nGAAn. Here, we analyzed DNA-binding ability, particularly for the discontinuously arranged nGAAn units, of HSFs from various organisms, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Danio rerio. Among these, only C. elegans HSF failed to bind the discontinuous nGAAn units, which suggests that the target genes of HSFs in many, but not all, organisms contain discontinuous HSEs, as well as continuous HSEs. Further analysis of alternatively spliced HSF isoforms showed the importance of the C-terminal region in HSF–HSE interaction.
!~RES~! Polypeptides of AtHsfA2, CeHSF-1, DmHSFa, and DrHSF1c were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation (CITATION A and B). Oligomerization status of HSF polypeptides was analyzed by chemical cross-linking. Interaction between HSF and DNA was examined by EMSA using model HSE oligonucleotides containing continuous perfect-type HSEs of four (4P) and three (3P) inverted nGAAn units, and discontinuous gap- and step-type HSEs. HA-tagged HSFs were expressed in HeLa cells (CITATIONC). Culturing HeLa cells at 37°C rendered transfected HSF-HA constitutively active CITATION, and the trimeric forms were detected by chemical cross-linking analysis of the cell extracts (CITATIONC). The HSE type-specific transcription by HSF was estimated by measuring luciferase activity of HSE-SV40p-LUC containing 4P-, 3P-, gap-, and step-type HSEs. As shown in CITATIOND, AtHsfA2 polypeptides incubated at the control temperature (25°C) were detected as monomers, trimers, and higher order oligomers in the cross-linking assay (see CITATION). The oligomeric status did not change, even when polypeptides were heat-treated at 37°C. In the EMSA, AtHsfA2 formed protein–DNA complexes with all four HSE oligonucleotides at 25°C, and heat-treatment resulted in a slight enhancement (∼1.5-fold) in the binding to 4P- and 3P-type HSEs. When AtHsfA2-HA was expressed in HeLa cells, luciferase activity of HSE-SV40p-LUC containing model HSEs was increased 2.7–3.8-fold, without affecting that of SV40p-LUC lacking the HSE. Although the binding ability of AtHsfA2 for 3P-type HSE was higher than that for gap- or step-type HSE in vitro, reporter genes containing gap- and step-type HSEs exhibited similar activity to that containing 3P-type HSE in HeLa cells. The reasons for this were unclear. Nevertheless, these results suggest that AtHsfA2 oligomerizes constitutively and binds to various HSE types. Similarly to AtHsfA2, CeHSF-1 polypeptides formed oligomers at 25°C (CITATIONE). Heat treatment at 32°C, which is the heat shock temperature of C. elegans CITATION, did not affect oligomerization status. The protein–DNA complexes were formed with continuous 4P- and 3P-type HSEs, but not with discontinuous gap- and step-type HSEs. In HeLa cells, CeHSF-1-HA induced reporter genes expression only via 4P- and 3P-type HSEs. Therefore, constitutively oligomerized CeHSF-1 recognizes continuous HSEs, but not discontinuous HSEs. DmHSFa polypeptides were monomers and oligomers at 25°C, and oligomerization was enhanced at 37°C, under our assay conditions (CITATIONF). DmHSFa was capable of binding to continuous HSEs, but less efficiently to discontinuous HSEs, and the binding ability was enhanced 2.0–2.5-fold at 37°C relative to 25°C. In HeLa cells, reporter gene expression was differentially induced by DmHSFa-HA, depending on the in vitro binding affinity for each HSE type. Therefore, DmHSFa inducibly oligomerizes in response to heat and binds to various HSE types, and in particular, to continuous HSEs. Most DrHSF1c polypeptides were monomers at 25°C, and incubation at 37°C increased oligomerization (CITATIONG). DrHSF1c bound to continuous HSEs with high affinity and to discontinuous HSEs with low affinity at 37°C; however, incubation at 25°C caused a 2.5–3.0-fold decrease in binding ability. The HSE type-specific recognition by DrHSF1c was confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay. Similarly to DmHSFa, heat-induced DrHSF1c oligomers bind to continuous HSEs and less efficiently to discontinuous HSEs. The results of in vitro binding assay were confirmed by EMSA competition experiments, which showed that AtHsfA2, DmHSFa, and DrHSF1c, but not CeHSF-1, recognize discontinuous HSEs (CITATION). DmHSF is known to bind DNA containing two inverted nGAAn units (2P-type, nTTCnnGAAn) CITATION. In the EMSA, AtHsfA2, DmHSFa, and DrHSF1c preferred gap-type HSE rather than 2P-type HSE, suggesting that the third gapped nGAAn unit in gap-type HSE is involved in stable protein–DNA interactions (CITATION) CITATION. It has been known that two trimers of HSFs, including DmHSF, cooperatively bind to HSEs containing four nGAAn units CITATION. Consistently, AtHsfA2, CeHSF-1, DmHSFa, and DrHSF1c preferentially bound to 4P-type HSE than 3P-type HSE in the EMSA, and their HSF-HA derivatives exhibited higher activation via 4P-type HSE than 3P-type HSE in the HeLa reporter assay (CITATIOND–G). Therefore, trimers of these HSFs may recognize long arrays of the nGAAn sequence in a cooperative manner. The HSE type-specific transcription by CeHSF-1 was evaluated in yeast cells expressing CeHSF-1 instead of ScHsf1. As shown in CITATION A, CeHSF-1-HA failed to support cell growth at 37°C. CeHSF-1 in yeast cells was oligomers at control (25°C) as well as at heat shock (35 and 39°C) temperatures (CITATIONB). The mRNA levels of genes containing 4P- and 3P-type HSEs were increased by heat shock at 35 and 39°C (CITATIONC). In comparison with ScHsf1 cells, the mRNA levels were slightly higher in CeHSF-1-HA cells grown under control (25°C) and mild heat shock (35°C) conditions, which suggests that the heat shock temperature is lower in CeHSF-1-HA cells. In contrast, the mRNA levels of genes containing gap- and step-type HSEs were reduced under control conditions and were not significantly heat-induced in CeHSF-1-HA cells. Therefore, CeHSF-1 is defective in transcriptional regulation of genes containing discontinuous HSEs. It should be noted that yeast cells expressing AtHsfA2-HA, DmHSFa-HA, and DrHSF1c-HA were able to grow at 37°C and that the heat shock response of genes containing various HSE types was observed in these cells (CITATION). Alternative splicing of the transcripts from the single Drosophila HSF gene generates four HSF isoforms CITATION. DmHSFa is the major isoform, and other isoforms (DmHSFb, DmHSFc, and DmHSFc) contains insertion A and/or insertion B near the HR-C region (CITATION ). When HSE-type specific recognition of the isoforms was analyzed by transfection of DmHSF-myc expression plasmids and HSE-SV40p-LUC reporter plasmids into HeLa cells, reporter gene expression by the four isoforms decreased similarly in the order 4P-type>3P-type>gap-type>step-type. Consistently, in vitro-synthesized DmHSF isoforms exhibited the same specificity for binding to model HSEs in the EMSA (CITATION). The presence of insertion B caused an increase in the transactivating ability of DmHSF, which was consistent with previous results CITATION. In zebrafish, alternative splicing of DrHSF1 pre-mRNA causes the generation of DrHSF1a isoform, which is different from DrHSF1c in its C-terminal amino acid sequence (CITATION A) CITATION. In HeLa cells, DrHSF1a-HA exhibited higher activation via discontinuous HSEs, and in particular, step-type HSE, than DrHSF1c-HA (CITATIONB). The binding of DrHSF1a to continuous and discontinuous HSEs was 1.7-fold and 1.9–2.5-fold higher than that of DrHSF1c, respectively (CITATIONC). DrHSF1a oligomerized more efficiently than DrHSF1c at 25 and 37°C, demonstrating the higher DNA-binding activity of DrHSF1a (CITATIOND). An oligomerization-prone property would also enable DrHSF1a oligomers to bind discontinuous HSEs with high affinity, because efficient oligomerization is important in establishing the interaction with discontinuous HSEs CITATION. It should be noted that the C-terminal region of DrHSF1c has a higher transactivating potential than that of DrHSF1a in fusion proteins with a heterologous DBD CITATION, which explains why DrHSF1c, exhibiting a lower DNA-binding ability, is a potent activator of reporter genes containing continuous HSEs in HeLa cells. These results suggest that although the isoforms have the same N-terminal region (the DBD and HR-A/B), the C-terminal short amino acid stretches affect oligomerization, resulting in preferential binding of discontinuous HSEs by the oligomerization-prone isoform.
!~MM~! Plasmids pTNT-AtHsfA2 and pcDNA-DmHSFa were created by subcloning the open reading frames (ORFs) of A. thaliana HsfA2 (AtHsfA2) CITATION and D. melanogaster HSFa (DmHSFa) CITATION into the pTNT (Promega, Madison, WI) and pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vectors, respectively. The ORF of C. elegans HSF-1 (CeHSF-1) CITATION was amplified by RT-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA of C. elegans whole body and cloned into pTNT (pTNT-CeHSF-1). The ORF of D. rerio HSF1c (DrHSF1c) CITATION was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA of zebrafish brain and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (pcDNA-DrHSF1c). To create plasmid harboring the DrHSF1a isoform (pcDNA-DrHSF1a), the DNA segment encoding C-terminal 8 amino acids of DrHSF1c was replaced with the last exon (encoding 22 amino acids) of DrHSF1a, which had been amplified from zebrafish genomic DNA CITATION. HSF polypeptides were synthesized using TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) and pTNT-AtHsfA2, pTNT-CeHSF-1, pcDNA-DmHSFa, pcDNA-DrHSF1a, or pcDNA-DrHSF1c as a template. The relative amounts of polypeptides were normalized by the levels of incorporated [35S]methionine and by the methionine contents. For chemical cross-linking, [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptides (0.1–0.5μl) were incubated in 4μl of buffer (10mM Tris–HCl (pH7.6), 70mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol), treated with ethylene glycol bis-(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS), and then subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and phosphorimaging CITATION. The experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. The EMSA was carried out as described previously CITATION. 32P-labeled HSE oligonucleotides were HSE4P, tcgacTTCtaGAAgcTTCcaGAAattagtgctactcga; HSE3P, tcgacTTCtaGAAgcTTCcactaattagtgctactcga; HSEgap, tcgacTTCtaGAAgctagcaGAAattagtgctactcga; and HSEstep, tcgacTTCtactagcTTCcactaatTTCtgctactcga (GAA and inverted TTC units are shown by uppercase letters). The binding mixtures contained 0.2–1.0μl of unlabeled polypeptides in 8μl of buffer (10mM Tris–HCl (pH7.6), 40–70mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100ng poly(dI-dC), and 0.01ng probe DNA). The experiments were performed at least four times with similar results. For expression of HSF-HA in HeLa cells, the HA tag sequence was fused in-frame to the C-terminus of HSF in the pcDNA3.1(+) vector CITATION. The myc-tagged DmHSF isoforms were described previously CITATION. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA mixtures consisting of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, Renilla luciferase control plasmid, and HSF expression plasmid, as described previously CITATION. Expression of HA- and myc-tagged HSFs in the cells was verified by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA CITATION and anti-myc (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka) antibodies, respectively. Equivalent amounts of loaded proteins were verified by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. For chemical cross-linking, cell extracts (50μg of protein) prepared as described CITATION were diluted 2-fold with water, treated with 2.0mM EGS, and subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. The reporter gene HSE-SV40p-LUC contained HSE oligonucleotides (see above), SV40 promoter, and firefly luciferase gene CITATION. Luciferase assay was performed as previously described CITATION. Data were shown as the mean±standard deviation for at least five experiments. The CeHSF-1-HA construct was inserted between the ADH1 promoter and terminator of yeast low-copy number plasmid (YCp-LEU2-P ADH1 -T ADH1 ) CITATION. Cells expressing CeHSF-1-HA were constructed from strain HS126 and YCp-LEU2-P ADH1 -CeHSF-1-HA-T ADH1 by the plasmid shuffling method CITATION. Chemical cross-linking and RT-PCR were carried out as described previously CITATION.
