!~ABS~! Calcium signals are critical for the regulation of polarized growth in many eukaryotic cells, including pollen tubes and neurons. In plants, the regulatory pathways that code and decode Ca2+ signals are poorly understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, genetic evidence presented here indicates that pollen tube tip growth involves the redundant activity of two Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs), isoforms CPK17 and -34. Both isoforms appear to target to the plasma membrane, as shown by imaging of CPK17–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and CPK34–YFP in growing pollen tubes. Segregation analyses from two independent sets of T-DNA insertion mutants indicate that a double disruption of CPK17 and -34 results in an approximately 350-fold reduction in pollen transmission efficiency. The near sterile phenotype of homozygous double mutants could be rescued through pollen expression of a CPK34–YFP fusion. In contrast, a transgene rescue was blocked by mutations engineered to disrupt the Ca2+-activation mechanism of CPK34 (CPK34–YFP–E465A,E500A), providing in vivo evidence linking Ca2+ activation to a biological function of a CPK. While double mutant pollen tubes displayed normal morphology, relative growth rates for the most rapidly growing tubes were reduced by more than three-fold compared with wild type. In addition, while most mutant tubes appeared to grow far enough to reach ovules, the vast majority (>90%) still failed to locate and fertilize ovules. Together, these results provide genetic evidence that CPKs are essential to pollen fitness, and support a mechanistic model in which CPK17 and -34 transduce Ca2+ signals to increase the rate of pollen tube tip growth and facilitate a response to tropism cues.
!~RES~! As part of a systematic analysis of the 12 most highly expressed CPKs in Arabidopsis pollen, isoforms CPK17 and CPK34 were investigated as a potentially redundant pair of genes because of their high identity. Based on the expression profiling data, CPK17 and CPK34 are preferentially expressed in mature pollen and account for approximately 20% of the CPK mRNA in that cell type (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To confirm the expression profiling data, a 500-bp promoter region for CPK34 was cloned upstream of a GUS reporter gene and used to create stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Flowers from transgenic plants showed strong GUS activity only in pollen (Figure 1). Importantly, no detectable expression was observed in any other part of the flower including the ovules and transmitting tract (n = 28 independent transgenic lines), suggesting that the primary function of CPK34 in reproductive development is restricted to pollen. [[FIGURE]] CPK17–YFP and CPK34–YFP fusions were expressed in stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants under the control of the ACA9 promoter (ACA9p). The ACA9 promoter is preferentially expressed in mature Arabidopsis pollen (CITATION). The YFP was fused to the C-terminal end of the CPKs to avoid disrupting a putative N-terminal acylation signal. These fusions were shown to retain functional properties and were able to rescue a cpk17/34 pollen growth defect (see below). In growing pollen tubes, CPK17–YFP and CPK34–YFP showed a pattern of localization consistent with a plasma membrane association, as revealed by confocal microscopy (Figure 2c,d and Movie S1 in Supporting Information). This was observed for multiple independent transgenic lines, regardless of whether expression levels were high or at the limits of detection. A perimeter fluorescence was also observed in mature pollen grains at the earliest stages of tip growth (Figure 2a,b). Identical patterns for CPK34–YFP expressed under the control of its natural promoter were seen, albeit with weaker signals (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To genetically analyze the function(s) of CPK17 and CPK34, two independent sets of cpk17/34 T-DNA gene disruptions were generated using mutants from two different Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant collections (cpk17-2/34-2 and cpk17-5/34-1). Mutants cpk17-2 (SALK_057146), cpk17-5 (SALK_140527), and cpk34-2 (SALK_040609) were obtained from the Salk collection (CITATION), which was generated in the Colombia ecotype background. Mutant cpk34-1 was isolated from the University of Wisconsin Arabidopsis knockout collection (CITATION), which was generated using a Wassilewskija (Ws) ecotype background. A basta resistance gene is associated with the T-DNA insertion in cpk34-1. DNA sequencing of regions adjacent to the left border of the T-DNA indicated that all insertions integrated into chromosomal positions that disrupted coding sequences (Figure 3). Plant lines heterozygous for either cpk17 (±) or cpk34 (±) segregated their respective T-DNA borders with normal Mendelian ratios of 1:2:1 (−/−, ±, +/+) (n = 195 for cpk17 alleles and 191 for cpk34 alleles). [[FIGURE]] Because CPK17 and CPK34 are closely linked on chromosome 5 (Figure 3), we were forced to screen for meiotic crossover events as the first step towards the creation of double cpk17/34 knockouts. From 262 plants, two crossover events linking a cpk17 allele and a cpk34 allele on the same chromosome were recovered, one for each set of independent alleles; cpk17-2/34-2(−/−, ±) [seed stock number (ss) 992] and cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±) (ss997). After allowing the cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) crossover line to self-fertilize, we failed to recover a homozygous double mutant in the first 406 offspring examined, as determined by PCR genotyping (Table 1). An independent analysis of cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±) gave similar results, with no double homozygotes isolated in the first 48 plants analyzed (Table 1). This failure to isolate even a single homozygous double mutation (expected 25% or 113 out of 454 F2s) suggested that CPK17 and -34 provided a redundant activity that was critical to some aspect of reproductive development. KO, knockout; WT, wild type aThe F1 progeny were assayed for the segregation of a double KO or transmission of the cpk34 (–) allele. bDenotes that the difference from expected is statistically significant (χ2, P < 0.005). To determine if the observed non-Mendelian segregation distortion of cpk17/34 (−/−, ±) plants was due to a defect in the male or female gametophyte, we conducted reciprocal crosses between cpk17/34 (−/−, ±) and wild-type (WT) plants (Table 1). While an expected Mendelian 1:1 transmission of the cpk17/34 crossover alleles was observed through the female gametophyte (n = 121/252), no transmission was observed through the pollen (n = 0/593 F1 analyzed), as determined by PCR genotyping. Evidence that the male transmission phenotype was caused by a loss-of-function of both CPK17 and CPK34 was corroborated by rescuing defective pollen with a pollen-expressed CPK34–XFP transgene. The transgene was expressed under the control of two different promoters, both of which show preferential expression in pollen. The first was an ACA9 promoter (CITATION). The second was a 500-bp fragment from the CPK34 promoter (Figure 1). Rescue of the cpk17/34 pollen transmission defect was equally successful using either promoter (Table 2). The rescue experiments were initially conducted by transforming cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) with ACA9p–CPK34–YFP, or transforming cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±) with CPK34p–CPK34–GFP. The transgenic plants were then tested for the ability of the transgene to complement the defect and allow the cpk17/34 crossover alleles to transmit through a pollen outcross. To quantify transmission, all F1 progeny were first selected for the presence of a hygromycin resistance marker associated with the transgene. Of these transgene-harboring offspring, a ‘perfect’ rescue for pollen outcrossing would correspond to a 50% frequency of transmission for the cpk34 mutant allele. While this theoretical 50% transmission efficiency was never observed, the 16 transgenic lines analyzed showed an average of 34% (n = 926/2723), ranging from a weak (13%) to a strong rescue (43%). Since the strength of the rescue did not appear to correlate with high or low expression levels, the modest reduction from a 50% theoretical transmission may be due to a subtle structural interference from the XFP tag at the C-terminal end of the kinase. All expected frequencies are based on first selecting for the hygromycin resistance associated with the transgene. In assays for a double KO produced from selfing, a 20% expected frequency comes from an expectation that the cpk17/34 crossover alleles do not transmit through the pollen. For the ACA9p::CPK34–YFP transgene, 10/10 lines showed an equivalent rescue of cpk17/cpk34. For the CPK34p::CPK34–YFP transgene, 12/12 lines showed an equivalent rescue of cpk17/cpk34. For the ACA9p::CPK34(dead)–YFP transgene, 3/3 lines showed no rescue of cpk17/cpk34. aThe F1 progeny were assayed for the segregation of a double knockout (KO) or transmission of the cpk34 (–) allele. To determine the point-of-defect associated with cpk17/34 mutant pollen, a series of in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth assays were done. First, cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) plants were backcrossed into the quartet background (qrt). In the qrt background all four meiotic products remain attached through their cell walls, allowing for a tetrad analysis to be conducted with the resulting four pollen grains (CITATION). With cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) in the qrt background, segregation should result in two pollen grains having a genotype of cpk17-2/CPK34 (WT), and the other two as cpk17-2/34-2. Examination by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of ungerminated pollen tetrads showed all four grains to be indistinguishable (data not shown). In comparison to tetrads from qrt controls, which often produced four normally developed pollen tubes when germinated in vitro (Figure 4a), tetrads segregating from cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) never produced any more than two rapidly growing tubes. Instead, we often observed two normal tubes and two short runty tubes (Figure 4b). To confirm that the runty tubes were the result of a cpk17-2/34-2 double mutation, these experiments were also done in a homozygous double mutant background that was segregating a YFP-tagged CPK construct that provided a functional rescue (data not shown). With this strategy, we observed that only the rapidly growing pollen tubes corresponded to those harboring the YFP-tagged CPK transgene, as determined by imaging YFP fluorescence with a confocal microscope. The same result was seen using a semi-in vivo assay (CITATION) in which the pollen grains were allowed to germinate and grow through a stigma that was dissected and placed on agar medium. Together these results indicated that while pollen grains harboring a cpk17/34 double mutation were viable, their growth potential was severely reduced. [[FIGURE]] To determine if the stubby cpk17/34 pollen tubes could still fertilize an ovule and generate a viable homozygous double knockout, we manually pollinated cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) pistils with a limited amount of pollen. This was done to reduce the competition between the two segregating pollen genotypes: normal ‘WT’ growing pollen tubes [cpk17-2/CPK34 (WT)] and ‘mutant’ runty pollen tubes (cpk17-2/34-2). During normal self-fertilization, faster growing ‘WT’ tubes would be expected to out-compete slower ‘mutant’ tubes in their quest to fertilize a limited supply of ovules. We reasoned that ‘mutant’ pollen would have an increased likelihood of reaching an ovule if the amount of pollen applied to the stigma was reduced. In non-competitive pollinations, females [cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±)] were manually pollinated with an average of 13 pollen grains/pistil (n = 659 pistils), of which 50% were expected to be harboring a cpk17-2/34-double mutation and the other 50% a single cpk17-2 mutation. In the production of 659 F1 offspring, we observed three examples of cpk17-2/34-2 pollen transmission (0.4%, a 125-fold decrease from an expected 50% transmission efficiency). One of these events was recovered as a viable homozygous double mutant plant. While this plant was nearly sterile, a limited number of seeds were obtained. The offspring were grown and confirmed to be homozygous cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, −/−) plants. To identify the segregation of a homozygous double mutant from the second set of independent alleles, cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±), we searched for ‘nearly sterile’ offspring in a population of greenhouse-grown plants. Three examples were recovered out of an estimated 4000 plants, and confirmed by PCR genotyping. This represents an approximately 340-fold decrease in transmission frequency. A similar 350-fold decrease in transmission (2/2750 plants) was estimated from a parallel screen using the first set of alleles, cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, −/−), which initially showed a 125-fold decrease in transmission in a non-competitive pollination assay. Consistent with a severe defect in pollen transmission in both competitive and non-competitive pollinations, the homozygous double mutant plants also showed a severe defect in seed set. The average seed set per silique was greatly reduced, typically to less than one seed per silique (Table 3). In side-by-side controls, WT plants typically produced 50–60 seeds per silique. While seed set levels have not been systematically studied under different growth conditions, the observation that 1% of the mutant siliques had as many as five seeds while most siliques were completely empty suggests that unique conditions associated with each pollination (i.e. every flower) can change the transmission efficiency. WT, wild type; ss, seed stock number. We used homozygous double mutant plants to further evaluate the pollen defect phenotype. We detected no difference from WT in pollen germination (Figure 4e) and tube morphologies were very similar (Figure 4c,d). However, a more than three-fold difference was observed in pollen tube growth rates (Figure 4f), consistent with the stubby tube phenotype initially observed in the segregation of double mutants in a quartet (tetrad) analysis (Figure 4b). No evidence was found for any defect associated with the female gametophyte. Homozygous cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, −/−) pistils manually fertilized with WT pollen gave full seed set (data not shown). This is consistent with reciprocal cross results presented earlier (Table 1) that showed no evidence for any transmission defect of a double mutation through the female. To evaluate mutant pollen tubes in vivo, homozygous cpk17/34 double mutants were selfed or outcrossed and pollen tubes visualized using aniline blue staining (Figure 5). Consistent with in vitro results, the vast majority of mutant tubes in planta were runty. Despite a severe growth defect, a large number of tubes grew sufficiently long to penetrate into the top of the ovary (Figure 5b). A few tubes grew further along the transmitting tract, but none grew past the first eight tiers of ovules (Figure 5c). [[FIGURE]] The fertilization efficiency (number of tubes that reach a given tier of ovules versus the number of seeds produced in the corresponding position) was estimated for both short and long tubes (Figure 5d). For short tubes, the efficiency was estimated at <1.7%. For the rare examples of tubes that grew further down the transmitting tract, the fertilization potential was improved (ranging 6–12%), but still reduced around 10-fold compared to that expected for a WT tube. In the aniline blue-stained pistils examined, no examples were observed of a long tube growing into a micropyle (for example as seen with aca9 mutants; CITATION). Thus, in addition to having a reduced growth rate, a second important aspect of the cpk17/34 defect appears to involve a deficiency in sensing or changing growth direction towards an ovule. As a control to determine whether a transgene rescue of the cpk17/34 pollen defect required an active kinase, a ‘dead’ CPK34 kinase construct was transformed into cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) and tested for its ability to rescue pollen transmission. The kinase ‘dead’ construct was made as a point mutation disrupting the active site (CPK34–D213A). The D213 residue is highly conserved in most serine/threonine (S/T) kinases (DFG motif, subdomain VII) and its mutation has been shown to abolish the biological activity of a yeast cAMP-dependent protein kinase (CITATION). All three transgenic lines tested failed to show any examples of pollen transmission (n = 0/154 F1 progeny analyzed) (Table 2). All three transgenic lines were verified to have the YFP-tagged mutant CPK target to the plasma membrane, and to have expression levels equivalent to the WT controls, as determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. These results provide evidence that kinase activity is necessary for the biological functions of CPK34, rather than providing a structural role (i.e. stabilizing a complex). To determine whether complementation required Ca2+ stimulation of the basal kinase activity of CPK34, a CPK34 transgene was engineered with mutations disrupting the Ca2+-binding EF-hands in the C-terminal lobe of the calmodulin-like regulatory domain. A double mutation of E to A was made at the C-terminal end (residue 12) of each EF-hand 3 and 4 (Figure 6). In vitro kinase assays showed that while the basal activity of this kinase was equivalent to WT, it failed to show any significant Ca2+ stimulation (Figure 6). All nine transgenic lines evaluated below were shown to have expression levels equivalent to a WT control, as determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (not shown). [[FIGURE]] To more easily quantify pollen transmission, these mutant CPK constructs were transformed into the cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±) background, which has a basta resistance marker associated with the 34-1 allele. This strategy allowed the transmission of the 17-5/34-1 crossover alleles to be assayed by scoring for basta resistance in the F1 offspring (as opposed to PCR genotyping). To test for transmission, we outcrossed pollen from each transgenic line into a homozygous cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, −/−) female. By using a homozygous double mutant as a female host, basta-resistant F1 offspring were automatically recovered in a homozygous double mutant background. These ‘rescued’ lines could then be grown and evaluated for changes in seed set. Out of the nine transgenic lines analyzed, five lines failed to show any examples of a transmission rescue (n = 546 F1 analyzed). However, four lines were found that each showed a single transmission event (∼1%, n = 4 out of 357 F1, with expected = 33%). Nevertheless, none of the double mutants produced from these rare events yielded plants with any significant increase in seed set. Thus, the EF-hand 3 and 4 E to A mutation appears to disrupt the ability of a CPK34–YFP to rescue the pollen transmission and seed set defects in a cpk17/34 double knockout.
!~MM~! Seeds were germinated on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.5% sucrose and grown for 2 weeks under continuous light before plants were transferred to soil. Unless noted, plants were grown in growth chambers (Percival Scientific, Inc., http://www.percival-scientific.com/) with 16 h of light (at 20°C) and 8 h of dark (at 18°C), with humidity ranging from 40 to 70%. Soil used was MetroMix200 (Hummert, http://www.hummert.com/) supplemented with Triple 10-10-10 fertilizer (Hummert) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants grown in the greenhouse were exposed to seasonal variations in light, temperature, and humidity conditions. Mutants were identified by a PCR-based screen (see text and Figure 3). Three mutants were identified in the Columbia background, cpk17-2, cpk17-5, and cpk34-2. A fourth mutation, cpk34-1, was identified in the Ws background, and harbored a basta resistance marker in the T-DNA. Double mutants were generated with the following genotypes, cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, ±) (ss640) cpk17-2/34-2/qrt (−/−, ±, −/−) (ss810), cpk17-2/34-2 (−/−, −/−) (ss992), cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±) (ss956), cpk17-5/34-1 (−/−, ±) (ss997). Primers used for PCR diagnostics were: 792 (dTGATGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG), 245 (dCATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC), 619a (dAGAAGAAACCAAAAACCTAAAAGAACAGACA), 619c (dCATCACTAGTCCACCTCCGAATGATAGTTCACGCCGCTTCTTAG), 654a (dCATAGCCATTCACAACCAAAACACCTAAC), 654c (dCATCACTAGTCCACCTCCTTTGAATGAAAGTTCACGCCGCTTCT), 1358a (dCATGGGGTTGAAGGAGATGTT). Complementary DNA encoding CPK34 and CPK17 was PCR-amplified from a SuperScript Arabidopsis cDNA Library (Life Technologies, http://www.lifetech.com/) with primers introducing restriction sites suitable for subcloning. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega, http://www.promega.com/) and sequenced. All plant expression constructs were made using a modified pGreenII plant expression vector (CITATION; CITATION) with selection markers for plants (hygromycin) and bacteria (kanamycin). For the production of fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, cDNA clones were subcloned into a pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare, http://www.gelifesciences.com/) vector modified to include a C-terminal 6× His tag (CITATION). Sequences for all clones are provided in Figure S1. Plasmid CPK34-promoter::GUS (ps1008) contains a β-glucuronidase gene (GUS reporter) under the control of a 0.5-kb fragment of the CPK34 promoter. The promoter was PCR-amplified and sequenced and verified to be free of mutations. A representative transgenic plant expressing this construct is ss908. Plasmids ACA9-promoter::CPK34–TAP2(YFP) [ps819] and ACA9-promoter::CPK17–TAP2(YFP) (ps995) encode CPK34 or CPK17, respectively, with a C-terminal YFP and tandem affinity tags (6× His and protein A) under the control of a pollen-expressing promoter from ACA9 [15]. Representative transgenic plants expressing these constructs are ss982 [CPK34, in cpk17-2 (−/−)/34-2 (−/−)/(qrt/qrt)] and ss1366 and 1367 (CPK17 in WT Col background). Plasmid CPK34-promoter::CPK34–TAP2(GFP) (ps1548) encodes CPK34 with a C-terminal GFP and tandem affinity tags (6× His and protein A) under the control of the same 0.5-kb fragment of the CPK34 promoter used to drive the GUS reporter (ps1008). Representative transgenic plants expressing this construct are ss1319 and 1320, in a cpk17 (−/−)/34 (−/−) background. Plasmid CPK34-promoter::CPK34–TAP2(YFP) (EF3 + 4-E to A) (ps1552) encodes a mutant version CPK34 in which EF-hands 3 and 4 have E to A substitutions at E465 and E500. The mutations were first introduced in pGEM clones using a Quick Change protocol, and the entire cDNA sequenced to be sure that it was error-free. Representative transgenic plants expressing this construct are ss1368–1370 in a mixed genetic background of cpk17-2/17-5, cpk34-1/34-2 (−/−, −/−). Plasmids G-CPK34-6H (ps897) and G-CPK34-6H (EF3 + 4-E to A) (ps1354) encode fusions with an N-terminal GST, CPK34 (WT or mutant), and a C-terminal 6× His. The EF3 + 4-E to A is the same set of substitutions as encoded in the plant expression construct (ps1552). Transformations of A. thaliana (ecotype Col-0) were done through a floral dip protocol using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 containing the helper plasmid pSoup (CITATION; CITATION). Pollen germination medium was prepared according to (CITATION). Flowers were air-dried for 2 h then gently spread on a slide layered with 400 μl of pollen medium. Slides were sealed inside a square Petri dish containing a water-saturated paper towel to maintain humidity. The slides were incubated for 2–6 h at 22–23°C. Images were collected on a Olympus IX81 FV1000 confocal microscope coupled to an Olympus Fluoview 1.3c software package (http://www.olympus.com/), using a 60× objective (numerical aperture 1.42) with an argon laser providing excitation at wavelengths of 488 nm (GFP, YFP) or 405 nm (DAPI). A spectral emission range of 500–540 nm was used for GFP, 530–570 nm for YFP, and 425–475 nm for DAPI. Pistils were fixed, processed, and stained for 12 h with decolorized 0.05% aniline blue in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) (CITATION). Pistils were pressed lightly between a slide and a cover slip, and photographed with a Leica DC 300F camera mounted on a Leica MZ FL III microscope (http://www.leica.com/) using a 425/40-nm excitation and 475-nm long-pass filter. All CPK fusion proteins were engineered with a N-terminal GST and a C-terminal 6-His (GST-6H), expressed in E. coli, and purified as previously described (CITATION). Enzymes were stored at −20°C in 10 mm 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)1,3-propanediol (TRIS)–HCl (pH 7.5) in 50% glycerol. Kinase activity was assayed as previously described with minor modifications (CITATION) using a 0.05-μg sample of enzyme in a 50-μl reaction volume with 300 μm ATP spiked with gamma-33P-ATP (40 Ci/mole), 100 μm Syntide-2, 20 mm TRIS–HCL (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.05 mg ml−1 BSA, with or without 1.15 mm CaCl2 (i.e. free Ca2+ around 115 μm). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 22°C and terminated by spotting 20 μl onto phosphocellulose filter paper (P81, from Whatman, http://www.whatman.com/).
