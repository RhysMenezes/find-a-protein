!~ABS~! Regulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plants has been attributed to feedback control of glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GLU-TR) by heme. Recently, another negative regulator, the FLU protein, has been discovered that operates independently of heme. A truncated form of FLU that contains two domains implicated in protein–protein interaction was co-expressed in yeast with either GLU-TR or glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2-1-aminotransferase (GSA-AT), the second enzyme involved in δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) biosynthesis. FLU interacts strongly with GLU-TR but not with GSA-AT. Two variants of FLU that carry single amino acid exchanges within their coiled coil and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, respectively, were also tested. Only the FLU variant with the mutated TPR motif lost the capacity to interact with GLU-TR.
!~RES~! The hydrophilic half of FLU contains two different regions implicated in protein–protein interactions: A TPR domain, which consists of two TPR motifs and occupies the C-terminal part, and a short coiled coil domain that is adjacent to the hydrophobic membrane anchor of FLU (CITATION ). Both domains seem to be functionally important since the replacement of an alanine at a highly conserved position of the first predicted TPR motif by valine and a similar amino acid exchange within the coiled coil domain leads to the inactivation of FLU in the allelic flu1-1 and flu1-4 mutants of Arabidopsis CITATION. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to test the possible role of the two domains during physical interaction of FLU with target proteins. A truncated version of FLU, which ranges from amino acid position 140 in the hydrophobic region to the very end of the protein, was fused in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD; vector pGBKT7) and the GAL4 activation domain (AD; vector pGADT7)(CITATION). This truncated version of FLU contains all highly conserved amino acid residues of the hydrophilic part that were identified by comparing the FLU sequence of Arabidopsis with those of rice (NCBI database, gi16904672) and Chlamydomonas reinhardii (J.D. Rochaix, personal communication). The two enzymes, GLU-TR (HEMA1) and GSA-AT (GSA1), were tested for their ability to interact with FLU. Truncated enzymes, which lack their chloroplast transit peptides, were fused in-frame with BD and AD (vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7) (CITATION). BD-FLU and AD-FLU were co-expressed with AD-GLU-TR and BD-GLU-TR, respectively, as well as with AD-GSA-AT and BD-GSA-AT, in yeast. FLU interacted strongly with GLU-TR but not with GSA-AT (CITATION ). This interaction occurred regardless of whether FLU was expressed as a fusion with the binding domain or as a fusion with the activation domain (CITATION). Under the same conditions FLU did not interact with itself (CITATION). In order to test the physiological significance of the interaction between FLU and GLU-TR and to determine which if any of the two protein–protein interaction domains of FLU was required for recognizing the target protein, the two mutated variants of FLU were used. The flu1-1 and flu1-4 proteins carry amino acid substitutions in the first TPR motif and in the coiled coil domain, respectively (CITATION). BD-flu1-1, AD-flu1-1, BD-flu1-4, and AD-flu1-4 fusions were constructed (CITATION). When AD-GLU-TR and BD-flu1-4 or BD-GLU-TR and AD-flu1-4 constructs were co-expressed in yeast, the same strong interaction occurred as between GLU-TR and the wild-type FLU protein (CITATION). However, the flu1-1 protein with a single amino acid exchange in the TPR domain no longer interacted with the GLU-TR regardless of whether AD-flu1-1 or BD-flu1-1 was used for co-expression with the corresponding construct of GLU-TR (CITATION).
!~MM~! The FLU cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from total cDNA, prepared from light-grown wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings. The flu1-1 and flu1-4 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from total cDNA, prepared from flu1-1 and flu1-4 Arabidopsis mutants, respectively. To amplify the FLU, flu1-1, and flu1-4 cDNAs, the following primers were used: 5′-GGAATTCACCGTTGGAGGGTTGCTTGCTCGG-3′; 5′-TCCCCCGGGTCAGTCAGTCTCTAACCGAGCAATG-3′; 5′-GGAATTCACCGTTGGAGGGTTGCTTGTTCGC-3′. The three cDNAs were first cloned into EcoRI/SmaI-digested Bluescript® IISK+/− vector, sequenced and then subcloned into EcoRI/SmaI-digested yeast vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7 (Clontech, Basel, Switzerland). The GLU-TR (HEMA1) and GSA-AT (GSA1) cDNAs were amplified by PCR from corresponding cDNA clones CITATION. The GLU-TR cDNA was amplified with primers 5′-GGAATTCGCCATGGCGTCTAATGCAGCTAGCATCTCTGCTC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTACTTATGTTGTTGTTCCGCCATTGC-3′, cloned into EcoRI-digested Bluescript® IISK+/− vector, sequenced and subcloned into EcoRI-digested vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7. The GSA-AT cDNA was amplified with primers 5′-TCCCCCGGGTGCCATGGCTGTTTCCGTCGACGAGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTAGATCCTACTCAGTACCCTCTCAG-3′, cloned into SmaI/BamHI-digested Bluescript® IISK+/− vector, sequenced and subcloned into SmaI/BamHI-digested vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7. For our experiments, the Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 of Clontech was used. The constructs in vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7 were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4, gal80, LYS2::GAL1 UAS-GAL1 TATA-HIS3, MEL1, GAL2 UAS-GAL2 TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1 UAS-MEL1 TATA-lacZ) and yeast transformants were selected according to the Clontech protocol.
