!~ABS~! In eukaryotes, 14‐3‐3 dimers regulate hundreds of functionally diverse proteins (clients), typically in phosphorylation‐dependent interactions. To uncover new clients, 14‐3‐3 omega (At1g78300) from Arabidopsis was engineered with a “tandem affinity purification” tag and expressed in transgenic plants. Purified complexes were analyzed by tandem MS. Results indicate that 14‐3‐3 omega can dimerize with at least 10 of the 12 14‐3‐3 isoforms expressed in Arabidopsis. The identification here of 121 putative clients provides support for in vivo 14‐3‐3 interactions with a diverse array of proteins, including those involved in: (i) Ion transport, such as a K+ channel (GORK), a Cl− channel (CLCg), Ca2+ channels belonging to the glutamate receptor family (1.2, 2.1, 2.9, 3.4, 3.7); (ii) hormone signaling, such as ACC synthase (isoforms ACS‐6, ‐7 and ‐8 involved in ethylene synthesis) and the brassinolide receptors BRI1 and BAK1; (iii) transcription, such as 7 WRKY family transcription factors; (iv) metabolism, such as phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase; and (v) lipid signaling, such as phospholipase D (β and γ). More than 80% (101) of these putative clients represent previously unidentified 14‐3‐3 interactors. These results raise the number of putative 14‐3‐3 clients identified in plants to over 300. 
!~RES~! A TAP strategy (TAP‐tag purification) was used to purify 14‐3‐3 omega‐YFP‐TAP2 (called 14‐3‐3 samples or 14‐3‐3‐TAP2Y) and GFP‐TAP2 (called GFP samples) (Fig. 1A) from the soluble extracts of liquid grown transgenic plants. The first affinity purification step was binding to an IgG sepharose column, followed by a TEV protease cleavage elution (Fig. 1B). The second affinity purification was over a Ni‐NTA column. A western blot analysis consistently showed at least a 200‐fold enrichment of purified 14‐3‐3‐TAP2Y (Fig. 2A) and a 800‐fold enrichment of purified GFP, as shown using an anti‐GFP antibody (Fig. 2B) to detect the fusion proteins. In experiments used for MudPIT analyses, this enrichment was improved several fold for both samples by including an extra GST removal step to better remove contaminants that had been added during our TEV protease elution from the IgG column. Regardless, in all purifications, the enrichment for the 14‐3‐3 samples was around fourfold less compared with the GFP control, consistent with the expectation that the 14‐3‐3 samples contained a large number of 14‐3‐3 interacting proteins. The TAP purified samples from multiple 14‐3‐3‐TAP2Y and GFP‐TAP2 preparations were analyzed by both 2‐D‐gel separations and MudPIT, providing evidence for more than 131 14‐3‐3‐specific interacting proteins (Tables 2 and 3).  [[FIGURE]] To identify the major interacting partners for 14‐3‐3‐omega‐TAP2Y, the control GFP and 14‐3‐3 purified samples were separated in a parallel 2‐DE analysis and quantified by Sypro Ruby stain (Fig. 3A and B). Protein spots from both gels were excised, digested, and analyzed by MALDI TOF‐TOF MS/MS. The major spots common to GFP and 14‐3‐3 samples were dominated by expected contaminants, such as TEV protease, which was added as a GST‐fusion protein during the elution of proteins bound to the IgG sepharose column. However, approximately fifty 14‐3‐3 sample‐specific spots were detected with varying intensity. All of the strongest staining spots were from eight different 14‐3‐3 isoforms (including a spot predicted to be the endogenous omega isoform) (Fig. 3C), as identified by the detection of isoform‐specific peptides. In our MudPIT analysis described in MudPIT analyses (Table 1), we also identified two more 14‐3‐3 isoforms (psi and omicron) (Table 2, Supporting Information Table 2) indicating that our TAP‐tagged 14‐3‐3 omega dimerized with at least 10 of the 12 expressed endogenous 14‐3‐3 isoforms. Unfortunately, none of the weakly stained spots contained enough protein to generate reliable MS/MS identification results. Nevertheless, this 2‐D‐gel analysis provided evidence that the complex mixture of copurifying 14‐3‐3 clients was not dominated by a few highly abundant proteins, but rather represented a highly diverse mixture of many different proteins, each at a relatively low level of abundance compared with the 14‐3‐3 proteins.  [[FIGURE]] Because the 2‐D‐gel‐based strategy was not sensitive enough to identify any clients in our complex mixture of 14‐3‐3 interactions, we switched our approach to an in‐solution trypsin digestion followed by a 2‐D‐LC MALDI‐based TOF‐TOF analysis. Tryptic digested peptides were bound to a SCX column and eluted by different salt concentrations (Table 1). The salt‐eluted peptides were separated by a C18 reverse phase column, and peptide fractions were spotted onto MALDI plates for TOF‐TOF MS analysis.  As a control for non‐specific interactions, we identified proteins that co‐purified with our control TAP‐tagged GFP in two independent purifications (Table 1). Thirty proteins were identified (Supporting Information Table 3) using a Mascot score of 24 as a reasonable cut‐off for a confident database match CITATION. Seventy‐five percent of these proteins overlapped in both replicates. All of these proteins were considered non‐specific contaminating interactions and were therefore excluded from our list below of potential 14‐3‐3‐specific interactions.  To identify putative 14‐3‐3‐specific interactions, we conducted three independent purifications, two of which were done in parallel with GFP controls described above (Table 1). For MS identifications of potential 14‐3‐3 interactors, we employed the following more rigorous set of criteria. First, we eliminated any protein that overlapped with a putative non‐specific interactor in the GFP controls, even if that GFP hit had only been identified as a single peptide with a Mascot score no better than 4, or a confidence as low as 90%. Second, all positive 14‐3‐3 hits required the identification of at least two peptides, with the final protein identification having a total Mascot score of at least 24, or an overall confidence level of 99%. Third, in 22 cases where the best individual peptide (among the multiple peptides supporting a specific protein identification) had a confidence below 90%, a manual inspection was done to validate the identification. In these cases, at least three immonium ions and three daughter ions (y or b ion) were required to match theoretical mass predictions, and represent the major peaks in the spectra. If more than 50% of the signal in the spectra appeared to be from a contaminating peptide, the spectrum was not used.  Using the above criteria, a total of 131 Arabidopsis proteins were identified as potential interactors with our TAP‐tagged 14‐3‐3 omega (Tables 2 and 3, with details in Supporting Information Tables 2 and 5). Nine of these proteins were identified as specific 14‐3‐3 isoforms other than omega. Twenty were putative client proteins that were expected based on the plant 14‐3‐3 interactions reported in the literature (Supporting Information Table 4). These two subsets of interactions confirm that our tagged 14‐3‐3 formed heterodimers and that these complexes included well‐known 14‐3‐3 clients.  Although 131 proteins were identified in the 14‐3‐3 purified fraction that were not found in the GFP fraction, 31 selected examples were further shown by quantitative MS strategies to be significantly enriched over background in a 14‐3‐3 purified sample. This was done by employing two different strategies. This enrichment evidence provides added confidence that a particular 14‐3‐3 interaction was real, and not just an artifact of not identifying a low‐abundance protein in one of the GFP control samples. Although technical limitations prevented a quantitative enrichment of every putative 14‐3‐3 client, we never observed a case in which a putative client was also identified in the GFP samples. Thus, all the enrichment ratios are actually based on an increase over varying levels of background noise from contaminating peptide(s).  The first approach was to label 14‐3‐3 sample peptides with 18O during a trypsin digestion. These labeled peptides were then mixed into a single sample with an equal amount of 16O‐labeled peptides from a GFP control purification. This mixed sample was then subjected to a 2‐D‐LC MALDI‐TOF‐TOF MS analysis to provide a relative comparison of signal strength for different pairs of 16O/18O‐labeled peptides. This strategy identified nine putative 14‐3‐3 clients with quantitative evidence for clear enrichment in the 14‐3‐3 sample (Supporting Information Fig. 4). These include, peroxidase 31, WRKY transcription factor 16, guard cell recycling outward K+ channel (GORK) channel, CURLY LEAF, cadmium/zinc‐transporting ATPase 2 (HMA2), glutamate receptor 1.2, CLC‐G channel, ALA1 and invertase.  The second approach was to use a quantitative iTRAQ strategy. The 14‐3‐3 and GFP samples were labeled with either iTRAQ 117 or 114 mass reporters, respectively. The labeled samples were combined and subjected to a 2‐D‐LC MALDI‐TOF‐TOF MS analysis (Table 1). As expected, peptides derived from known contaminants, such as added trypsin and GST‐TEV protease, showed ratios of 1.1 and 1.4, respectively (Supporting Information Table 6), confirming that the two iTRAQ‐labeled samples were mixed equally. By comparing enrichment levels for shared and unique peptides associated with the GFP and 14‐3‐3 tags, we established normalization criteria for estimating minimum enrichment ratios (Supporting Information Text 1). Using this approach, minimum enrichment ratios from 12 to 243 were found for 21 putative client proteins, including UVH3, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase, phosphoglucomutase, G‐6‐P dehydrogenase, Glutamyl‐tRNA synthase and phospholipase D alpha (Supporting Information Fig. 5). 
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana cv Columbia plants were transformed with 35s::GFP‐TAP2 (ps346, plant line ss687 and ss820) or 35s::14‐3‐3 omega‐YFP‐TAP2 (ps472, plant line TL3169) through an Agrobacterium (GV3101)‐mediated floral dip transformation method CITATION. Transgenic plants were selected on plates consisting of 1/2x MS salts (Sigma), 0.5 g/L MES, pH 5.7, and 25 ug/mL hygromycin B (Invitrogen) or 50 ug/mL kanamycin (Sigma), respectively. Seedlings were then transferred after 10–14 days to 200 mL liquid media consisting of 1/2x MS salts, 0.5g/L MES, pH 5.7, and 2% sucrose and grown for 6–7 wk under low light conditions with continuous shaking at room temperature (RT).  GST‐TSPN‐S2 (ps308) encodes a mutant version of TEV protease with reduced auto‐cleavage activity CITATION. It was constructed as a sandwich fusion between GST at the N‐terminus and a Strep Tag (S2) at the C‐terminus in a modified pGEX‐4T vector (Pharmacia), which harbors an ampicillin resistance marker (see Supporting Information Fig. 1 for plasmid sequence).  35s::GFP‐TAP2 (ps346) encodes an N‐terminal GFP fused to Protein‐A, a TEV protease cleavage site and a 6xHis, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter (Fig. 1A). The parent plant transformation vector was pGreenII, providing hygromycin resistance in plants and kanamycin resistance in bacteria CITATION (see Supporting Information Fig. 2 for plasmid sequence). 35s::14‐3‐3 omega‐YFP‐TAP2 (ps472) encodes an N‐terminal 14‐3‐3 omega (At1g78300) fused to a YFP, the same affinity tag used in 35s::GFP‐TAP2, and expressed under the control of a 35s promoter (Fig. 1A). The parent plant transformation vector was pBIN, providing kanamycin resistances in plants and bacteria, CITATION (see Supporting Information Fig. 3 for plasmid sequence).  [[FIGURE]] Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli harboring GST‐TSPN‐S2 (ps308) in 2XYT media +200 μg/mL ampicillin were diluted tenfold, grown for 1 h at 30°C, and expression of GST‐TSPN‐S2 induced by addition of 0.5mM IPTG. Cells were grown three more hours at 30°C. Cells were harvested, and the cell pellet resuspended in 20 mL GST‐binding buffer (BB; 20 mM Tris‐HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl) +1 mM PMSF and 1 mg/mL lysozyme. After incubation on ice for 10–30 min, the mixture was frozen at −70°C until used. The sample was thawed quickly, and Triton X‐100 added to 0.4% v/v. Cells were broken by sonication for 6 min at 4°C. Cell debris was pelleted at 10 000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 400 μL of a 50% slurry of glutathione agarose (Sigma) pre‐washed with 3×5 mL GST‐BB and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The glutathione agarose beads were pelleted at 200–300×g for 30 s, washed with 3×10 mL GST‐BB, and transferred to a bio‐spin column (Bio‐Rad). TSPN fusion protein was eluted with 2×500 μL GST‐elution buffer (100 mM Tris‐HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10mM glutathione) and concentrated in a centricon (YM‐30, Millipore). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50%. Aliquots were frozen and stored at −70°C. The concentration of TSPN was determined via the Bradford method CITATION, and greater than 90% purity verified by SDS‐PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel) and staining with CBB CITATION.  Liquid grown plants were harvested, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder with dry ice in a coffee grinder, and either used directly or stored at −70°C. Frozen plant powder was mixed with an equal amount (w/v) of homogenization buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet added fresh as per manufacturer's recommendations (Roche)). The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth pre‐soaked in ice‐cold homogenization buffer into a pre‐chilled flask on ice. The filtrate was then centrifuged at 6000×g for 15 min at 4°C to pellet intact organelles and cell‐wall debris. The supernatant containing membranes and soluble proteins was then centrifuged at 112 000×g for 1 h at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor to pellet membranes. Membrane pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1mM PMSF) homogenized in a dounce homogenizer and stored at −70°C. To 37.5 mL of the soluble supernatant fraction, 500 μL of 50% slurry of IgG sepharose 6 fast flow (GE Healthcare) pre‐washed with 3×5 mL IgG‐W (10 mL Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) was added and the mixture rocked at 4°C for 2 h. Sepharose beads were then pelleted at 200×g for 10–20 s, the supernatant was removed (unbound fraction), and beads were washed with 3×5 mL IgG‐W.  Fusion proteins were then eluted from the sepharose beads by cleavage with 2 μM (50 μg/500 μL) GST purified GST‐TSPN‐S2 in cleavage buffer (IgG‐W +0.1 mM β‐Mercaptoethanol) for 2 h at 16°C. Sepharose beads were pelleted, and supernatant removed and stored at −70°C (first elution). To the sepharose beads, another 2 μM TSPN was added in cleavage buffer and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 16°C before collecting a second elution. The 2 h and 16 h cleavage reactions were then pooled, mixed with 25 μL packed glutathione agarose beads (pre‐washed with IgG‐W (Sigma)) and incubated for 10 min at 4°C. The slurry was transferred to a spin column (Bio‐Rad) and the flow through collected via centrifugation at 200×g at 4°C for 10 s. This GST binding step was performed in order to help remove contaminating proteins carried over from the GST‐TSPN‐ST protease elution step. After a GST clean‐up, NaCl was added to the flow through to bring the concentration to 300 mM NaCl and mixed with 100 μL of a 50% slurry of Ni‐NTA superflow (Qiagen) pre‐washed with 3×2 mL 6H‐W1 (20 mM Tris‐HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl). Binding was allowed to proceed at 4°C for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred to a bio‐spin column (Bio‐Rad), washed with 3×1 mL 6H‐W1, followed by 2×75 μL washes with 6H‐W1 +0.1% NP‐40 to aid in the removal of non‐specific interactions. The column was then washed 2×75 μL with 6H‐W1 to remove traces of NP‐40, and purified protein complexes were eluted from the column with 2×100 μL 6H‐elution buffer: 20mM Tris‐HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole.  Western blotting was performed essentially as described CITATION. Briefly, protein samples were mixed with 3× loading dye and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Samples were electrophoresed through an 10% polyacrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide, Sigma) and transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio‐Rad transfer apparatus. Blots were incubated in blocking buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.5% v/v Tween 20 (TBS‐T), with 5% w/v non‐fat dry milk) for at least 1 h at RT with shaking followed by a 1 h incubation at RT with primary anti‐GFP antibody (Clonetech). After washing, the blots were washed 4×10 min in TBS‐T and incubated for 1 h at RT with secondary antibody diluted 1:10 000 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody used for detection was a donkey anti‐rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP (GE Healthcare). Following secondary antibody incubation, the blots were washed four times for 10 min in TBS‐T, and detection was made using ECL (GE Healthcare).  2‐DE was performed as previously described CITATION. Purified protein samples were precipitated with 4 volumes of cold (−20°C) acetone. After incubation at −20° overnight, the precipitates were washed twice with −20°C acetone/water (4:1) and resulting pellets were dried for 15 min using a Speed Vac. The pellets were dissolved in 200 μL DeStreak Rehydration Solution (GE Healthcare) and spun at 16 000 rpm at 22°C for 10 min. Bio‐Lyte 3–10 Ampholyte (Bio‐Rad) was added to each supernatant to a final concentration of 0.2% v/v. 185 μL of each extract (81 μg for 14‐3‐3 and 97.1 μg for GFP) was loaded onto a 3–10 L (linear) 11 cm IPG strip (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA) by overnight passive rehydration. Isoelectric focusing was carried out on a Bio‐Rad Protean IEF cell using a program as follows: 250 V, linear ramp for 20 min; 8000 V, linear ramp for 2 h 30 min; and 8000 V for a total of 20 000 Vh. Strips were stored at −80°C overnight, then thawed the next day and incubated twice for 10 min each in 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 0.05 M Tris‐HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol. The first incubation contained 2% DTT and the second contained 2.5% iodoacetamide. The strips were then layered on 8–16% acrylamide Criterion Tris‐HCl gels and embedded in place with 0.5% agarose, along with electrophoresis until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were washed with two changes of water (10 min each) and stained overnight with Sypro Ruby stain (Molecular Probes). Stained gels were imaged on a Bio‐Rad VersaDoc imager. Images of gels were compared using Bio‐Rad PDQuest version 7.3 software and spot sets were created.  In‐gel digestion was performed and modified as previously described CITATION. The 2‐D‐gel spots were excised individually by a ProteomeWorks Spot Cutter (Bio‐Rad). Gel samples were washed twice with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 100% ACN, and reduced by 10 mM DTT and alkylated by 100 mM iodoacetamide. Samples were subjected to in‐gel digestion by incubation with 75 ng trypsin (Promega) dissolved in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C for 6 h on the Investigator ProPrep Digestion and Mass Spec Preparation Station (Genomics Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Peptide samples were spotted onto MALDI plates using Zip‐Tip μC18 tips (Millipore). 0.5 μL and 0.5 μL matrix mix (5 mg/mL CHCA with 10 mM ammonium phosphate) were then spotted onto the plate.  For in‐solution digestion, TAP‐affinity purified 14‐3‐3 and GFP protein complexes were digested by trypsin (Promega) in small aliquots. For each protein sample aliquot (5 μg in 20 μL), 30 μL of 100% ACN was added and incubated for 20 min at RT, followed by the addition of 40 μL 10 mM DTT in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubation for 10 min at 60°C. After cooling to RT (15 min), 20 μL of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added and incubation continued for 35 min at RT. Proteolysis was initiated by the addition of 35 μL (0.2 μg) trypsin ((Promega), dissolved in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) per aliquot reaction and incubated overnight at 37°C.  Peptide desalting was performed as previously described CITATION. The digested peptides were dried in a vacuum. Desalting of the pellets was performed by use of reverse phase Zip‐Tip μC18 columns (Millipore). The C18 column was equilibrated by 100% ACN and washed by 0.1% v/v TFA (in water) three times. Peptide pellet was resuspended in 0.1% v/v TFA and bound onto the column. The C18 column was washed by 0.1% v/v TFA three times and peptides were eluted by a solution containing 50% v/v ACN, 0.1% v/v TFA. The eluate was dried in a speed‐vac.  2‐D gel MS data were collected using an ABI 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, CA), using their 4000 Series Explorer software v. 3.0–3.6. MS acquisition/processing settings were: Reflector Positive Mode (1‐keV accelerating voltage), 700–4000 Da acquisition mass range, baseline subtraction enabled at peak width 50, S/N threshold 3, Cluster Area S/N Optimization enabled at S/N 3, internal calibration to within 20 ppm using trypsin autolysis peaks 842.51 and 2211.105. The eight most intense ions were selected for MSMS analysis. MSMS acquisition/processing settings were: 70 Da to precursor ion mass range acquisition, precursor window resolution of −1 to +4 Da, CID on, baseline subtraction enabled at peak width 50, S/N threshold 5. Raw data were extracted for protein identification by GPS Explorer Software v. 3.0–3.6 (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by Mascot v 1.9.05 (Matrix Science) CITATION using NCBI nr database (NCBI 2005.03.22) containing 2 367 365 sequences. Analyses were performed as combination MS+MS/MS. Search settings included MS and MS/MS minimum S/N filter 10, peak density filter 50 peaks per 200 Da, maximum number of peaks 65. Additional settings were: cleavage enzyme trypsin, variable modifications of oxidation of Methionine and Carbamidomethylation of Cysteines, max 2 missed cleavages, precursor mass tolerance 20ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance 0.2 Da.  For MALDI‐based MudPIT analysis, tryptic digested peptides were fractionated by 2‐D‐LC). The first dimension was separated by a strong cation‐exchange (SCX) column (5 μL, 300 Å, 25 mm length, tapered bore 4.0 mm inlet, 1.0 mm outlet) (Michrom Bioresources) using HPLC. The SCX‐bound peptides were eluted with four different salt concentrations of ammonium acetate (Table 1) and separated by the second dimension, a reverse phase C18 column (5 μL, 100 Å, 0.1×150 nm) (Michrom). For reverse phase LC gradient formation, solvent A, 0.3% v/v formic acid; solution was mixed with solvent C, 90% v/v ACN, 0.3% v/v formic acid to make 80% v/v ACN as final in 1 h at a nanoflow rate of 0.7 μL/min. The eluted peptides were subjected to spotting onto ABI MALDI plates (400/plate) by a ProBot spotting robot (Dionex LC Packings) in CHCA (Sigma) at a rate of one spot every 6 s followed by a MALDI‐TOF‐TOF MS/MS analysis using the ABI 4700 spectrometer. Matrix was spiked with Insulin B chain and Angiotensin 1‐7 clip standards for MALDI calibration. Peptides were spotted onto MALDI plates, with a density of 400 spots per plate. Mass range of MS acquisition was set between 700 and 4000 Da. Laser intensity was set at 4500. For MS processing, baseline was subtracted at 50 with S/N of 3. Smoothing was disabled. S/N threshold for cluster area optimization was set at 10. Internal calibration using masses 3494.651 and 899.466 was performed. For MS/MS acquisition, CID was used with laser intensity at 5500. For MS/MS processing, baseline was subtracted at 1000 with S/N threshold at 10. Smoothing was disabled. S/N threshold for cluster area optimization was set at 15. Top eight abundant peaks per spot were selected for MS/MS analysis. MS/MS data obtained were subjected to MASCOT algorithm analysis against SwissProt database (20050303) containing 176 469 sequences and NCBI database (20050322) containing 2 367 365 sequences.  In some cases, a relative comparison of peptide ion frequencies was evaluated in control and 14‐3‐3 samples using a non‐isobaric tag (iTRAQ) strategy. For iTRAQ samples, the mass tolerance for fragmented ion was set at 0.2 Da. Missed cleavage site was set at 1. Met oxidation and Carbamidomethyl Cys were selected for potential protein modification. Protein identification results were inspected by use of GPS TM software version 3.5 (Applied Biosystems). MS/MS spectra were manually inspected to ensure the quality of the identification. At least two peptides per protein were documented for protein identification. For iTRAQ analyses, the mass tolerance for precursor ion was set at 150 ppm and for fragmented ion was set at 0.2 Da. Missed cleavage site was set at 1. Parameters set for potential protein modifications included those to account for iTRAQ labeling and Met oxidation.  To further evaluate the confidence of protein identifications, a decoy database CITATION with a randomized version of NCBI nr (20050322) containing 2 367 365 sequences and SwissProt (20050303) containing 176 469 sequences was generated. A combined and concentrated database containing both regular and random sequences was generated. The decoy was searched with the same parameters used for a regular database search. A false‐positive identification rate (FDR) was calculated as ((FP/(FP+TP))*2) where FP represents false positive and TP represents true positive. The FDR for all searches was calculated using a peptide homology match cut‐off threshold of better than E‐value 0.1 CITATION, and is listed in Supporting Information Table 7. The FDR rates were normally less than 0.01, with the worst case exception at 0.06. In all cases, true positives were confirmed to be the best hits in both SwissProt and NCBI databases.  Gene ontology annotations were characterized by searching ATG number against The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) gene ontology database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp). The molecular mass of each protein was predicted using Compute pI/Mw algorithm (http://ca.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). A bioinformatic analysis was performed to predict 14‐3‐3 binding peptides of these interacting proteins by use of MotifScan (http://scansite.mit.edu/motifscan.seq.ptml) CITATION algorithm followed by a manual evaluation.  MS‐based quantitative proteomic analysis using 16O/18O stable isotope labeling catalyzed by trypsin digestion was performed as described previously CITATION. For 16O/18O labeling, trypsin dissolved in HO and HO (Sigma) was used. TAP affinity purified 14‐3‐3 fraction was subjected to in‐solution trypsin digestion in HO at 37°C overnight, whereas GFP fraction was subjected to in‐solution digestion in HO. After the digestion, two samples were combined into a single tube. Peptides were desalted by reverse phase C18 Zip‐Tip columns (Millipore) for MS analysis. The 16O and 18O‐labeled peptide has theoretical mass difference of 2 and 4 Da. The signal level of 16O peak was compared with the background level. Because in TOF‐TOF analysis S/N threshold for cluster area optimization was set at 10, the background level was calculated by dividing the signal level by 10. The 18O/16O ratio was calculated as such: (18O peak signal‐background)/(16O peak signal‐background). The 18O/16O ratio was calculated as such: (18O peak signal‐background)/background.  iTRAQ labeling was performed as per manufacturer's recommended protocol (Applied Biosystems) starting with the acetone precipitation of the TAP affinity purified proteins. The only deviation included two 5 μg additions (instead of one 10 μg addition) of trypsin (supplied in kit, Applied Biosystems). After the first addition of 5 μg trypsin, the samples were incubated at 40°C for 3 h, followed by a second aliquot of 5 μg trypsin and incubation overnight at 37°C to ensure complete trypsin digestion.  To estimate protein concentration after the acetone precipitation via the Bradford method CITATION, an aliquot of each sample (after solublization in dissolution and denaturization buffer (provided in kit)) was dialyzed using mini‐dialysis tubes (Pierce) against 1 L 10 mM Tris pH 6.8 at RT for 1 h to eliminate detergents and salts.  iTRAQ‐labeled GFP and 14‐3‐3 samples were combined into a single sample and subjected to MALDI‐based 2‐D‐LC MS/MS analysis. In this case, the SCX‐bound peptides were eluted by ten different concentration of ammonium acetate salt (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500 mM). The salt eluted peptides were spotted onto individual spot on ten separate MALDI plates with time interval of 6 s at a nanoflow rate of 0.7 μL/min. Four hundred spots were spotted onto each MALDI plate. An MS/MS analysis of top‐three abundant peptides in each spot per plate was performed to build up exclusion list. The list includes masses of abundant peptides, i.e. 14‐3‐3, GFP, GST, IgG and trypsin (Supporting Information Table 1). A complete MS/MS analyses on top eight abundant peaks per spot was performed to retrieve sequence information of less abundant peptides by including the exclusion list. The iTRAQ (117/114) ratio was calculated by correction factor input for the GPS TM software version 3.5 (Applied Biosystems) using 114 as a reference. Although TOF‐TOF was set for a theoretical mass selection window of −0.001 to +2 Da for fragmentation analyses, the instrumentation used here was observed to allow significant amounts of contaminants between −1 and +3 Da. Thus, spectra used for iTRAQ quantitation were manually inspected to ensure that the signals corresponding to the peptide being identified and quantified in a fragmentation analysis represented more than 50% of the total signal.
