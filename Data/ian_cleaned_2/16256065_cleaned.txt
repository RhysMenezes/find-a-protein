!~ABS~! Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACSs) activate fatty acids for further metabolism and are encoded by a multi-gene family in Arabidopsis. AtLACS6 possesses a type 2 (PTS2) peroxisomal targeting sequence, whilst AtLACS7 has both a type 1 and type 2 peroxisomal targeting sequence. AtLACS7 was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Multiple clones of the PTS1 receptor PEX5 were isolated. Quantitative β-galactosidase assay indicated that full-length PEX5 interacts with AtLACS7 with higher affinity than the TPR domains alone. The interaction between PEX5 and AtLACS7 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and shown to be specific for the PTS1, therefore the AtLACS7 PTS1 is accessible to bind PEX5 in the full-length AtLACS7 protein. The expression profile of AtLACS6, AtLACS7, AtPEX5, and AtPEX7 revealed that AtLACS6 and 7 have distinct patterns of expression and we speculate that the possession of two targeting signals may be advantageous for the import of AtLACS7 when receptors may be limiting.
!~RES~! To verify expression of the bait fusion protein, total proteins were extracted from Y187 cells transformed with the empty DNA-BD vector and cells transformed with the AtLACS7/DNA-BD vector and subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by immunoblotting employing an antiserum against the C-terminal region of AtLACS7 (CITATION ). A 92kDa protein was detected which is the expected size for a fusion between the 148 amino acids of the GAL4 BD and 700 amino acids of AtLACS7, therefore AtLACS7 fusion protein was stably expressed in yeast. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain-AtLACS7 fusion protein was used as bait to screen a GAL4-AD fusion libraries made with cDNA from A. thaliana tissues. An estimated total of 2×108 diploids was screened. The screen produced about 300 blue colonies that grew on SD minimal medium lacking adenine and histidine and containing X-α-Gal. Of 200 colonies selected for further analysis 194 (97%) contained fragments of the PTS1 receptor PEX5 as determined by PCR with primers specific for the PEX5 open reading frame. Three independent clones were studied in more detail. The inserts were fully sequenced, which confirmed that all three clones were derived from the Arabidopsis PEX5 gene. D45 contained a full-length PEX5 sequence whereas D44 and B82 contained 388 and 330 carboxy-terminal fragments which comprised the complete TPR domain but truncated amino terminal domain (CITATION A). The TPR comprises 34 amino acids and is found in repeated arrays CITATION. The TPR sequence is quite variable but is characterized by the consensus sequence: Hy-X2-Hy-X3-hy-X2-Hy2-X4-Hy-X2-hy-Hy-X2-Hy-X2-hy-Hy-X-Hy-X-Pro-X2, where Hy and hy refer to large and small hydrophobic residues, respectively CITATION. The carboxy-terminal half of the PEX5 protein contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), and is responsible for binding the C-terminal tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) CITATION. The structure of the human PEX5 TPR domain co-crystallised with a PTS1 containing peptide has been determined CITATION. The plant PEX5 also has 11 repeats of the sequence W-(A/V/N)-(E/D/N/Q/S)-(E/S)-(Y/F/Q) in its N-terminal half CITATION; seven similar motifs are observed in the human PEX5 CITATION, but less frequent and distinct in the yeast. It is in this half that the peroxisomal targeting information is contained and is involved in an intricate network of protein–protein interactions CITATION. The finding that all of the clones isolated in the library screen using AtLACS7 as a bait contained the entire TPR region confirms that this region is essential for AtLACS7 interaction and that the presence of the N terminus is dispensable for PTS1 binding. The interactions were confirmed in yeast to exclude false positives. The plasmids isolated from clones B82, D44 and D45 were transformed back into yeast strain Y187 and mated with yeast strain AH109 containing either AtLACS7/pGBT9-G or pGBT9-G empty vector (CITATIONB). Yeast cells containing just the BD or AD constructs do not grow on minimal medium (CITATIONB, panels 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10), instead yeast cells containing interacting proteins can activate the reporter genes and grow on minimal medium (CITATIONB, panels 1, 4, and 7). To verify the level of PEX5 clones expression, total proteins were extracted from yeast cells transformed with DNA-AD/PEX5-B82, DNA-AD/PEX5-D44, DNA-AD/PEX5-D45 or from cells transformed with the empty DNA-AD vector. The same amount of total proteins (50μg) was separated by SDS–PAGE followed by immunoblotting employing an antibody against the HA epitope tag, which is encoded by the vector in frame with the amino terminus of the PEX5 fragment. The expression level of the different fusions was similar (CITATION A), so in order to quantify the strength of interaction between AtLACS7 and the different PEX5 clones a quantitative β-galactosidase assay was performed. Although interaction with the two truncated clones was well above background the β-galactosidase activity was significantly higher with the full-length clone suggesting that the interaction is stronger (CITATIONB). The specificity of the interaction between AtLACS7 and PEX5 was confirmed by in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments (CITATION ). AtLACS6, which has a PTS2 but lacks a PTS1, was used as negative control. Although 72% identical and 84% similar to AtLACS7 over the entire amino acid sequence CITATION, its localization in peroxisomes is predicted from the presence of a peroxisomal consensus sequence, targeting signal 2 (PTS2) that does not bind PEX5. [35S]Methionine-labelled AtLACS6, AtLACS7, and AtPEX5-B82 proteins were produced in vitro using a reticulocyte lysate system and detected by autoradiography (CITATIONA). AtLACSs and AtPEX5-B82 were expressed in vitro with a c-Myc and HA epitope tag respectively which are encoded by the vector. Immunoprecipitation with anti c-Myc antibody precipitated AtLACS6 and AtLACS7 (CITATIONB, lanes 1 and 2) whilst HA antibody was able to precipitated PEX5-B82 (CITATIONB, lane 3). Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-cMyc antibody precipitated both AtLACS7 (CITATIONB, lane 4) and AtLACS6 (CITATIONB, lane 5) but only in lane 4 was a band of 40 kDa corresponding to the HA tagged PEX5 fragment co-precipitated. In the reverse experiment anti-HA antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the PEX5 fragment but only in lane 6 (AtLACS7) is co-precipitation of the acyl-CoA synthetase seen. No interactions between AtLACS6 and AtPEX5-B82 were detected (lanes 5 and 7, CITATIONB). Therefore the interaction is specific for the PTS1 containing AtLACS7 protein. AtLACS7 is unusual in that it contains both a PTS1 and a PTS2 consensus targeting signal, the only example so far known from plants. Targeting signals have to be accessible to the receptor and the co-immunoprecipitation results suggest that the AtLACS7 PTS1 in the context of the native protein is a proper substrate for PEX5 and this interaction occurs via the PEX5 TPR domain. We did not isolate any clones for PEX7, the PTS2 receptor, from the library screen despite AtLACS7 containing a PTS2 consensus that can target EYFP to peroxisomes CITATION. This may be because the fusion of the GAL4 binding domain to the N-terminus of AtLACS7 obscured the PTS2 signal, although there are documented examples where N-terminal fusions to PTS2 proteins can be recognised in the yeast two-hybrid system CITATION. What could be the function of 2 PTSs in AtLACS7? A recent study demonstrated that the PTS1 sequence of S. cerevisiae Pex8p is not essential for targeting to induced peroxisomes, but improves targeting to basal (non-proliferated) peroxisomes CITATION. As plant cells have different peroxisome types it is possible that dual targeting signals allow control of targeting to different peroxisome subtypes. Another possibility is that having two PTS signals could allow AtLACS7 to compete more effectively for available import receptors under conditions when these could be limiting. A survey of the expression patterns of AtLACS6, AtLACS7, PEX5, and PEX7 using the Genevestigator website CITATION shows that while these genes have broadly similar profiles with the highest expression in young seedlings (stage 0 according to CITATION) and mature plants producing seeds (stages 6–8) AtLACS7 is generally expressed at a lower level than the other three genes (data not shown). Comparison of selected tissues (CITATION A) confirms the relatively low expression of AtLACS7 but shows that it is strongly upregulated in seed. AtLACS6 shows a different expression profile. Although it is also highly expressed in seed it shows strong upregulation in senescent leaf and also to some extent in roots. PEX7 shows only small changes of expression between tissues, while PEX5 shows an increased level of expression in seed. We have previously reported that some peroxisome associated genes are upregulated by stress CITATION. AtLACS7 expression is increased by both salt and ozone (CITATIONB). PEX5 and PEX7 show no change in response to these stresses. AtLACS6 shows no change in response to salt stress but shows a modest increase in response to ozone. The differing expression profiles of AtLACS 6 and 7 suggest that they may not be totally redundant and may have different roles under different developmental or stress conditions. Acyl-CoA synthetases belong to a much larger group of 63 acyl activating enzymes in Arabidopsis also known as the acyl-adenylate forming or AMP binding protein family CITATION. Different members of this family are active on a wide range of substrates including short, medium and long-chain fatty acids CITATION, acetate CITATION and even more diverse carboxylic acids CITATION including inodole acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA) CITATION. JA is produced by peroxisomes by β-oxidation and 2 genes, At4g05160 and At5g63380, are targeted to peroxisomes and act on the JA precursors OPC-6:0 and OPDA. However, At4g05160 is most efficient with medium chain fatty acid (C14:0) and At5g6330, although most active with OPDA, has significant activity towards long-chain fatty acids CITATION. The activity of LACS6 and 7 was determined with respect to fatty acids CITATION and found to be greatest with respect to eicosanoic acid (C20:1), which is characteristic of storage triacyl glycerol, but both showed significant activity with a range of medium and long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Thus a role for LACS6 and/or 7 in membrane turnover or fatty acid signalling in response to stress is feasible. The genes of several JA biosynthetic enzymes show increased transcription in response to salt stress CITATION and JA signalling pathways are activated in response to ozone CITATION. Under conditions where the availability of import receptors is unchanged or diminished but more AtLACS7 is required in peroxisomes, having the possibility to use either receptor could increase the efficiency of import. The possibility of the regulation of protein import into peroxisomes is only just beginning to be appreciated CITATION and may be a fruitful topic for future investigation

Yeast transformations were carried out as described CITATION. Transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco, Sparks, USA), 2% glucose and amino acids as needed (SD). The Escherichia coli strain DB3.1 (F −, gyrA462, endAΔ(sr1-recA), mcrB mrr, hsdS 20 ( r B - , m B - ) , supE44, ara14, galK2, lacY1, proA2, rpsL20 (Sm r ), xyl5, Δleu, mtl1) was used for pDONR201 and pDONR207 transformation; HB101 (F −, thi-1, hsdS 20 ( r B - , m B - ) , supE44, recA13, ara-14, leuB6, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20 (str r ) xyl-5, mtl-1) was used for pGADT7-Rec library plasmid transformation and DH5α (F −, Φ80dlacZΔM15, Δ. (lacZYA-argF) U169, deoR, recA1, endA1, hsdR 17 ( r k - , m k - ) , phoA, supE44, λ − thi-1, gyrA96, relA1) was used for the other transformations. The E. coli strain DB3.1 and DH5α transformants were grown on LB medium with appropriate antibiotic selection. HB101 transformants were grown on LB medium and selected on M9 plates−Leu and +Amp. The AtLACS7/DNA BD construct was transformed into yeast strains Y187, and AH109 using a small-scale yeast transformation procedure CITATION. Selection of transformed yeast colonies was done on SD minimal medium lacking tryptophan. The transformed AH109 yeast colonies were checked for auto-activation of reporter genes by the AtLACS7/DNA BD fusion protein. The construct was screened against whole plant A. thaliana normalised cDNA libraries, inserted into the pGADT7-Rec vector (BD Biosciences, United States), a LEU2-based GAL4 DNA activation domain (AD) fusion protein expression vector (Sommer H., Max Planck Institute, Cologne, Germany). The libraries were transformed in the yeast strain AH109 and screened with the bait using the Clontech library mating method. Fifty milliliters of Y187 bait culture (OD600 ∼0.83) was spun down, resuspended in 5ml SD medium minus tryptophan (approx 1×109 cells/ml), and mated with a 1ml aliquot of oligo(dT) AH109 library (2×107 cells/ml) and a 5ml aliquot of random-oligos AH109 library (4×106 cells/ml), in accordance with the BD Matchmaker Library Construction and Screening Kits instructions. The yeast clones containing interacting proteins were identified by growth on minimal medium lacking both histidine and adenine, and by blue colour development for α-galactosidase activity. The pGADT7-Rec plasmids of positive clones were rescued, amplified in the HB101 E. coli strain and sequenced. The rescued cDNAs were identified by BLAST searches. Interactions were confirmed by re-transforming the positive activation domain plasmids into AH109 and mating with Y187 containing either AtLACS7/pGBT9-G construct or the pGBT9-G plasmid. Further PEX5 containing yeast colonies were identified by a PCR screen using the pGADT7-Rec insert screening amplimer primers (M5-AD, M3-AD, Clontech) and PEX5 specific primers F1 forward: 5′-CAT ACT GAT AGA TTC AAC GAC GGT GA-3′ F3 forward: 5′-ACG CAG AGA ACG ATG ATG ATC AAC AGG-3′ R1 reverse: 5′-GTC GAC TCA CAG CGG GAA TTC TTT CTG-3′ which were designed using the PEX5 mRNA sequence (GenBank Accession No. NM_125012).

Fifty micrograms of total proteins was separated by SDS–PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of antibodies that recognise peroxisomal acyl-CoA synthetase CITATION. For PEX5 clones expression, the yeast strain Y187 transformed with PEX5(B82)/pGADT7-Rec, PEX5(D44)/pGADT7-Rec, and PEX5(D45)/pGADT7-Rec or with the empty vector were grown on minimal medium lacking leucine and 50μg of total proteins was separated by SDS–PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of anti HA antibody (Clontech). In pGADT7-Rec, the gene of interest is cloned in-frame relative to the HA epitope tag and, upon expression, the protein of the interest is synthesized as a fusion protein with the peptide tag recognized by specific antibodies. Bands were visualised with a western chemiluminescence kit (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, USA), using a 1:5000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG. Quantitative β-galactosidase activity was performed according to an established protocol CITATION. The yeast cells were grown in selective liquid media until the OD600 was approximately 1. One hundred microlitre aliquots were mixed with 700μl Z buffer (11.1g/L Na2HPO4 ·2H2O, 5.5g/L NaH2PO4 ·H2O, 0.75g/L KCl, and 0.25g/L MgSO4· ·H2O to pH 7) 50μl chloroform, and 50μl 0.1% (w/v) SDS and mixed by vortexing. 160μl of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG 4mg/ml dissolved in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7) was added and the reaction incubated at 30°C for 60min. The reaction was terminated with 400μl of 0.1M Na2CO3 and the OD420 was measured. The units of β-galactosidase were calculated with the following formula: Arbitrary activity units / min / ml = OD 420 / OD 600 × ( 10 / t ) × 1000 . pGBKT7-G and pGBKT7-Rec vectors contain a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a c-Myc or HA epitope tag, respectively. [35S]Methionine-labelled AtLACSs and AtPEX5 proteins were produced with the TNT T7 Coupled Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega, Madison, USA). The co-immunoprecipitations were performed using the BD Matchmaker Co-IP Kit according to the manufacturers instructions.
