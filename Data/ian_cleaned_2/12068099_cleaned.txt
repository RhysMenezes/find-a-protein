!~ABS~! Branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCATs) play a crucial role in the metabolism of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They catalyze the last step of the synthesis and/or the initial step of the degradation of this class of amino acids. In Arabidopsis, seven putative BCAT genes are identified by their similarity to their counterparts from other organisms. We have now cloned the respective cDNA sequences of six of these genes. The deduced amino acid sequences show between 47.5% and 84.1% identity to each other and about 30% to the homologous enzymes from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals. In addition, many amino acids in crucial positions as determined by crystallographic analyses of BCATs from Escherichia coli and human (Homo sapiens) are conserved in the AtBCATs. Complementation of a yeast Δbat1/Δbat2 double knockout strain revealed that five AtBCATs can function as BCATs in vivo. Transient expression of BCAT:green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts shows that three isoenzymes are imported into chloroplasts (AtBCAT-2, -3, and -5), whereas a single enzyme is directed into mitochondria (AtBCAT-1).
!~RES~! Several recent reports on genes and cDNAs encoding enzymes engaged in the degradation of the branched-chain amino acid Leu suggest the presence of a catabolic pathway in mitochondria (CITATION;CITATION, CITATION). To identify the plant enzyme catalyzing the initial step of this degradation process, BCAT sequences from yeast (CITATION; accession no. P38891), human (Homo sapiens; CITATION; CITATION; accession no. O15382), and Escherichia coli (CITATION; CITATION; accession no. P00510) were used to screen the sequence data available in the public data bases by the tblastN algorithm (CITATION). This approach identified seven putative BCAT genes in Arabidopsis. After the completion of the Arabidopsis genome project, these genes were annotated on different bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) clones as indicated in Table I. An additional putative gene annotated as BCAT like was found in later searches, but the predicted protein shows only limited similarity to the other AtBCATs and thus was not further analyzed. In addition to the genomic sequences, several EST sequences were identified, four of which potentially encode BCAT reading frames. Sequencing of these clones, which were kindly provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University, Columbus), confirmed them to encode putative BCAT reading frames (Table I). In cDNA clone 97D16T7 (AtBCAT-1), however, four missing nucleotides, possibly lost in an aberrant splicing process, and in clone ATTS4608 (AtBCAT-4), a point mutation introducing a stop codon, disrupt the respective BCAT reading frames. Correct reading frames were identified in cDNA clones generated by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR from total Arabidopsis RNA.  Survey of the putative BCAT genes identified in the Arabidopsis genome Of the other clones from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, clone ATTS3314 (AtBCAT-3) encodes an apparently complete BCAT protein, but clone 123A19T7 (AtBCAT-2) encodes a BCAT reading frame most likely truncated at the N terminus. Inspection of genomic N-terminal sequences identified a putative intron in this cDNA clone, which shortens the BCAT reading frame at the N terminus. This clone was used to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library and several fully spliced cDNA clones encoding N-terminally extended reading frames were identified. However, about 10% of the isolated cDNA clones still contained intron 2 with the shortened version of the reading frame. Potential alternative splicing was examined by RT-PCR analysis of total RNA. A single cDNA fragment corresponding in size to a completely spliced mRNA does not detect partially spliced mRNAs for AtBCAT-2 in the total steady-state RNA (data not shown). For AtBCAT-5 and -6, partial cDNA fragments were generated by RT-PCR and used to isolate complete cDNA clones from an Arabidopsis cDNA library. No cDNA fragment could be amplified for AtBCAT-7 with gene-specific primers even in repeated experiments. In addition, no cDNA clone originating from this gene could be isolated in a hybridization with the AtBCAT-6-specific probe, which is 86% identical with the AtBCAT-7 nucleotide sequence. It remains unclear at present whether AtBCAT-7, which is located directly downstream of AtBCAT-6, is an actively transcribed gene. The amino acid sequences deduced from the seven putative AtBCAT cDNAs share between 27.1% and 39.2% identical amino acids with their counterparts from non-plant organisms, between 48.4% and 76.0% with two putative BCAT sequences from potato cDNAs, and between 47.5% and 84.1% with each other (Table II). Weak amino acid sequence similarity (31.1%–37.9% in 87 to maximally 252 amino acids) is observed with part of a BCAT-like reading frame in the Arabidopsis genome. Alignment of the seven AtBCAT sequences shows extensive conservation across almost the complete reading frames. A Lys to which pyridoxalphosphate (PLP) is covalently linked in non-plant BCATs is conserved in all BCATs from Arabidopsis (Fig.1, highlighted by a gray box). A Tyr (Y236 in AtBCAT-1, Y207 in HsBCATm, and Y164 in EcILVE) and a Glu (E268, E237, and E193) anchoring the PLP ring in the bottom of the active site cavity are also present in the plant sequences (Fig. 1, arrowheads 3 and 4). In addition, several other amino acids, with crucial functions revealed by crystallization of the respective proteins from E. coli (ILVE) and human (HsBCATm), are conserved in the Arabidopsis sequences. These include a Tyr (Y100, Y70, and Y31) and an Arg (R173, R143, and R97; Fig. 1, arrowheads 1 and 2;CITATION; CITATION). These residues are important for the interaction between the monomers via hydrogen bonding and seem to be essential for the formation of the putative substrate-binding pocket in HsBCATm (CITATION). Substantial sequence variability characterizes the N termini (Fig. 1) of the AtBCATs, possibly encoding different targeting signals for the subcellular sorting of the individual enzymes.  Comparison of the amino acid sequences deduced from the different BCAT cDNAs and genomic sequences by the BestFit algorithm of the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) [[FIGURE]] The comparatively high amino acid sequence similarity of the putative BCATs investigated here with their counterparts in other organisms strongly suggests an analogous function as BCATs. To experimentally confirm such an activity in vivo, the Arabidopsis reading frames were tested for their ability to suspend auxotrophy for branched-chain amino acids of a Δbat1/Δbat2 double knockout yeast strain (CITATION). This strain is not able to grow on minimal medium with Glc in the absence of a single, any combination of two, or all three branched-chain amino acids (data not shown). The transformation of the vector pRS425GPD without insert, which carries a leu2 marker, rescues the auxotrophy for Leu, but does not influence the dependency on an external supply of Val and iso-Leu. Of course, growth of the mutant can be rescued by the addition of all three branched-chain amino acids, although reduced growth rates compared with the wild-type cells may indicate an additional function of the BCATs in yeast (CITATION). We used this system with the aim to test the ability of AtBCATs to complement the auxotrophy for branched-chain amino acids. To this end, the respective full-length Arabidopsis cDNA sequences were cloned downstream of the yeast glycerol aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter in vector pRS425GPD and transformed into Δbat1/Δbat2. Restored growth on minimal medium lacking the three branched-chain amino acids confirms the respective enzymatic activities for AtBCAT-1, -2, -3, -5, and -6 (Fig.2). Growth parameters were comparable with the positive control in which ScBAT-1 was used for complementation. We assume that a mitochondrial AtBCAT will be transported to mitochondria also in yeast and there take over the function of the mitochondrial ScBAT1. The other complementing AtBCATs probably remain in the cytosol taking over the function of the yeast cytosolic enzyme. Because yeast cells lacking the mitochondrial enzyme but with an intact cytosolic protein can grow in the absence of branched-chain amino acids, a localization of the AtBCATs in the cytosol is sufficient to rescue the auxotrophy. No complementation was achieved with AtBCAT-4 (data not shown). To check whether an improper subcellular targeting might be responsible for the lack of complementation, the conserved region starting with amino acid 18 was C-terminally fused to the atp9 mitochondrial targeting sequence from Neurospora crassa (amino acids 1–59). However, even with this presequence, which correctly directs the conserved part of the homologous ScBAT-1 protein into mitochondria in yeast, no complementation is detectable (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] A control plasmid carrying the Arabidopsis aspartate aminotransaminase 1 (AtAAT-1, data not shown; CITATION) does not complement the auxotrophy, confirming that the presence of functional BCAT reading frames from Arabidopsis is responsible for complementation (Fig. 2). Previous analyses had indicated that branched-chain amino acids are synthesized in chloroplasts, whereas the degradation pathways are accommodated in mitochondria. The N-terminal extensions of AtBCAT-1, -2, -3, and -5 suggest targeting of these proteins to either of these organelles. Distinct intracellular localizations are predicted by the various sorting prediction programs (see “Materials and Methods”). Mitochondrial targeting of AtBCAT-1 and -2 is suggested by all programs used, whereas different subcellular destinations are predicted for AtBCAT-3 and -5. For AtBCAT-4 and -6, targeting to plastids or mitochondria is clearly excluded, but peroxisomal (AtBCAT-4) and cytosolic (AtBCAT-6) localizations are suggested by PSORT albeit with relatively low probabilities (0.59 and 0.65). To test the subcellular sorting of AtBCAT-1 to -6 in vivo, complete cDNAs (AtBCAT-3, -4, and -6) and fragments corresponding to N-terminal parts of different lengths were cloned in frame upstream of a plant-adapted GFP (smGFP4, Fig. 3A). The cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter drives expression of these fusion proteins after transient transformation into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts.  [[FIGURE]] Colocalization of the AtBCAT-1:GFP fluorescence with the MitoTracker Red fluorescence, a dye that is specifically enriched in mitochondria, identifies the AtBCAT-1:GFP fusion protein in mitochondria. This is consistent with the computer prediction and suggests a participation of this protein in the branched-chain amino acid degradation process (Fig.3B, upper lane). In contrast, the GFP fluorescence patterns observed in protoplasts transformed with AtBCAT-2, -3, and -5:GFP constructs are congruent with the autofluorescence patterns of the chloroplasts, identifying these organelles as their subcellular residence (Fig. 3B, lower parts). The in vivo targeting of AtBCAT-2 contradicts the prediction of a mitochondrial localization of this protein. No definitive localization is observed for the GFP fusion proteins with AtBCAT-4 and -6 moieties. For these, a weak and diffuse GFP fluorescence is seen that could possibly be interpreted as a cytosolic distribution of the respective fusion proteins (data not shown), which for would AtBCAT-6 be consistent with the prediction by PSORT.
!~MM~! The cDNA of AtBCAT-1 was amplified with Klentaq polymerase (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) on total RNA after first strand synthesis primed by oligo(dT)-adapter primer DTXSC [5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA-(dT)17] under conditions recommended for the polymerase used. In the first reaction, primers Atbcat1/2 (1–26) and XSC (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA) were used under the following conditions: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 46°C, and 2 min at 68°C. The obtained cDNAs were size fractionated on an agarose gel and fragments with sizes between 1.3 and 1.7 kb covering the expected size of about 1.5 kb were eluted from the gel and used as templates for a second PCR with primers Atbcat1/2 and Atbcat1/3 (1,368–1,346) with the following parameters: five cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C, and 2 min at 68°C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C, and 2 min at 68°C. The resulting fragment of 1.4 kb was then directly cloned into pBluescript vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ligation and transformation intoEscherichia coli was performed under standard conditions described elsewhere (CITATION). The AtBCAT-4 cDNA (1.2 kb) was cloned by an analogous strategy after one round of PCR amplification with primers Atbcat4/5 (17–36) and Atbcat4/4 (1,204–1,180) and five cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C, and 1.5 min at 68°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 53°C, and 1.5 min at 68°C. The cDNA sequence of AtBCAT-3 was determined on EST clone ATTS3314 (accession no. Z34554). For the isolation of complete cDNAs of AtBCAT-2, EST clone 123A19T7 was used as a probe to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA lambda ZAPII library (Stratagene) obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (CITATION). Plating, transfer, and hybridization were carried out following the manual for the lambda ZAPII system (Stratagene) and the recommendations given by the manufacturer of the Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala). A cDNA clone for AtBCAT-5 was obtained by the same experimental procedure using a respective partial cDNA fragment as probe. This fragment was amplified from first strand cDNA synthesized on total RNA (see above) engaging a nested PCR strategy with primer pairs Atbcat5/3 (775–794), Atbcat5/2 (1,841–1,821), and Atbcat5/4 (831–850), Atbcat5/2. Screening of the Arabidopsis cDNA library was performed as described for AtBCAT-2. Full-length AtBCAT-6 clones were isolated from the Arabidopsis cDNA library by hybridization with a cDNA fragment obtained in a PCR with primers bcat6/7.1 (231–255) and bcat6/7.2 (774–753) on first strand cDNA generated as indicated above. All sequences are available in public databases under the following accession numbers: AJ276123 (AtBCAT-1),AJ271731 (AtBCAT-2), AJ276124 (AtBCAT-3), AJ271732 (AtBCAT-4),AJ293804 (AtBCAT-5), and AJ312747 (AtBCAT-6). Numbers describing the locations of the primers refer to the nucleotide numbering in the respective database entries. For the complementation tests, AtBCAT-2, -3, -5, and -6 cDNAs were amplified with primer pairs Atbcat2GFP-H (34–63) and Atbcat2Y-R (1,284–1,258), Atbcat3GFP-H (85–108) and Atbcat3Y-R (1,405–1,381), Atbcat5Y-H (546–568) and Atbcat5Y-R (1,872–1,847), and Atbcat6GFP-H (5′-GCGGATCCTCCATAGATGGCT-3′) and Atbcat6.3 (1,113–1,093) on the respective cDNA clones as templates. These primers containBamHI restriction sites attached at the 5′ ends to allow cloning into the respective site in vector pRS425GPD (CITATION). Analogous clones of AtBCAT-1 and -4 were generated by direct cloning of the BamHI/BamHI andBamHI/SalI full-length cDNA fragments into the vector. A plasmid carrying the ScBAT-1 coding region from amino acids 17 through 393 with the 5′-attached mitochondrial targeting sequence of the Neurospora crassa ATPase subunit 9 (amino acids 1–59) was used as positive control. To test the influence of subcellular targeting of AtBCAT-4 on complementation, a fragment coding the same N. crassa atp9 targeting signal was cloned upstream of the AtBCAT-4 reading frame, which codes for amino acids 18 through 354. As negative control, a cDNA fragment representing the complete Arabidopsis mitochondrial Asp amino transaminase 1 (AtAAT-1, accession no. U15026) was generated by RT-PCR with primers DTXSC 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(dT)17 (first strand synthesis) and primer pair Ataat1-H (62–86)/Ataat1-R (1,605–1,579) with attachedBamHI restriction sites. Cloning into pRS425GPD was done as above. About 3 to 5 μg of each complementation clone and of the vector without insert were transformed into yeast strain Δbat1/Δbat2 (CITATION) and plated onto minimal medium (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% [w/v] Suc, 0.002% [w/v] adenine, His, and Lys). The plates were cultivated at 30°C and growth was monitored after 5 to 7 d. For the transient expression of AtBCAT:smGFP4 fusion proteins, respective fragments were amplified on the various AtBCAT cDNA templates: AtBCAT-1, primers Atbcat1GFP-H (62–89) and Atbcat1GFP-R3 (236–209); AtBCAT-2, primers Atbcat2GFP-H and Atbcat2GFP-R (438–411); AtBCAT-3, primers Atbcat3GFP-H and Atbcat3GFP-R (1,340–1,318); AtBCAT-4, primers Atbcat4GFP-H (29–52) and Atbcat4GFP-R (322–299); AtBCAT-5, primers Atbcat5GFP-H (546–568) and Atbcat5GFP-R2 (1,047–1,022); and AtBCAT-6, primers Atbcat6GFP-H and Atbcat6GFP-R (1,085–1,065). The amplified fragments correspond to the N-terminal parts of 47 (AtBCAT-1), 126 (AtBCAT-2), 413 (AtBCAT-3), and 156 (AtBCAT-5) amino acids. All primers used contain 5′-attached BamHI restriction sites, which were used for cloning into the respective site in vector psmGFP4 containing the smGFP reading frame (CITATION). On average, 50 μg of DNA of the individual clones were transformed into about 500,000 tobacco protoplasts. Preparation and transformation of the protoplasts were carried out as described previously (CITATION). MitoTracker Red staining was done according to a protocol given by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence of GFP, Mitotracker Red, and chlorophyll was visualized with an Axioplan I microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and the following filter sets: GFP, HQ D3295x/HQ510/50 and GG475LP; MitoTracker, HQ 545/30/HQ 610/75; rhodamine, BP530-585/FT600/LP615 (used for chlorophyll autofluorescence); and FITC, HQ 470/40/HQ 500 LP. All filters were purchased from AHF Analysentechnik (Tübingen, Germany). Images were taken with the Axiovision software. Computer analyses were performed using the Blast algorithms at the National Center for Biotechnology Information server. The protein alignment was generated with the MegAlign program of the DNA Star sequence analysis package. The intron in the AtBCAT-2 cDNA clone 123A19T7 was identified using the Genscan Web Server at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) and the NatPlantGene Server at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, BioCentrum-DTU at the Technical University of Denmark (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPGene/). Predictions of subcellular targeting were done with PSORT (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/), MiTop (http://www.mips.biochem. mpg.de/cgibin/proj/medgen/mitofilter), Predotar (http://www.inra.fr/Internet/Produits/Predotar/index.html), and ChloroP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/). Reverse transcription was carried out with Superscript II RT in a buffer supplied by the manufacturer as outlined in the manual (Life Technologies/Gibco-BRL, Cleveland). Sequence analyses of the clones carrying GFP fusion constructs and the negative test complementation clones were performed by cycle sequencing with the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeling kit or T7 DNA polymerase-based sequencing with the Cy5 Autoread sequencing kits with Cy5-dATP labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing fragments were detected and processed by an Alf Express sequencer. If not otherwise stated, PCR was carried out with 5 units of KlenTaq polymerase on about 100-ng DNA template with 35 cycles of 60 s at 94°C, 60 s at the melting temperature, and 90 s at 68°C.
