!~ABS~! Plant Resistance (R) proteins play an integral role in defense against pathogen infection. A unique gain-of-function mutation in the R gene SNC1, snc1, results in constitutive activation of plant immune pathways and enhanced resistance against pathogen infection. We previously found that mutations in MOS4 suppress the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1, and that MOS4 is part of a nuclear complex called the MOS4-Associated Complex (MAC) along with the transcription factor AtCDC5 and the WD-40 protein PRL1. Here we report the immuno-affinity purification of the MAC using HA-tagged MOS4 followed by protein sequence analysis by mass spectrometry. A total of 24 MAC proteins were identified, 19 of which have predicted roles in RNA processing based on their homology to proteins in the Prp19-Complex, an evolutionarily conserved spliceosome-associated complex containing homologs of MOS4, AtCDC5, and PRL1. Among these were two highly similar U-box proteins with homology to the yeast and human E3 ubiquitin ligase Prp19, which we named MAC3A and MAC3B. MAC3B was recently shown to exhibit E3 ligase activity in vitro. Through reverse genetics analysis we show that MAC3A and MAC3B are functionally redundant and are required for basal and R protein–mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. Like mos4-1 and Atcdc5-1, mac3a mac3b suppresses snc1-mediated autoimmunity. MAC3 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with AtCDC5 in planta. Our results suggest that MAC3A and MAC3B are members of the MAC that function redundantly in the regulation of plant innate immunity.
!~RES~! To affinity purify the MAC, full-length MOS4 containing a C-terminal triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was expressed in mos4-1 under the control of its native promoter. MOS4-HA transformed into mos4-1 fully complements all mos4-1 associated phenotypes, including morphology (CITATION) and enhanced susceptibility to the virulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae p.v. maculicula (P.s.m.) strain ES4326 (CITATION). This indicates that the MOS4-HA fusion protein functions the same as wild-type MOS4 and thus was used in affinity purification using anti-HA microbeads. As shown in CITATION, multiple protein bands were found to specifically associate with MOS4-HA. Any bands in the MOS4-HA lane that were also present in the Col-0 lane were not excised to avoid false positives. MS sequencing of the excised bands identified a total of twenty-four proteins (CITATION, CITATION), including the previously known MAC components MOS4, AtCDC5 and PRL1. Nineteen of the isolated proteins share homology to human and yeast proteins that have been characterized as NTC or NTC-associated proteins (CITATION) CITATION, indicating that this protein complex is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic kingdoms. (A) Full-length genomic MOS4-HA driven by its native promoter complements mos4-1 morphology. Soil-grown plants were photographed 4 weeks after germination. Size bar represents 1 cm.

An unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance of bacterial growth compared to Col-0. Asterisk indicates P<0.0001. (C) MOS4-HA associated proteins were isolated by affinity purification from total nuclear extracts collected from 100 g of leaf tissue from 3 week old transgenic and Col-0 seedlings. Interacting proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, and silver-stained. Nuclear extracts from complementing mos4-1 plants expressing PMOS4-MOS4-HA were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA beads, separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (CITATION). The MOS4-HA IP lane was cut into eight pieces, digested, and the proteins contained were analyzed by mass-spectrometry. Sequenced peptides were used as queries in BLAST searches against the 2007 version of the Arabidopsis genome. Proteins with strong or partial homology to Arabidopsis proteins from other eukaryotes are listed in the columns to the right. Proteins are divided into sections according to their sequence homology to known NTC- or NTC-associated proteins, based on a previous computational organization CITATION. Dashes indicate that no proteins with significant homology were identified by BLAST.

Most of these proteins have not been studied in Arabidopsis but are predicted to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing or RNA processing based on their relatedness to NTC proteins. Among others, four predicted subunits of the U5 snRNP, one subunit of the U2 snRNP, and several RNA binding proteins and helicases were identified. In addition, five unrelated proteins were also revealed as potential MAC components (CITATION). These could be novel MAC proteins or they could represent experimental contaminants. Importantly, we identified two proteins, encoded by At1g04510 and At2g33340, with homology (23–24% identity, 41% similarity) to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Prp19, the founding member of the NTC. These proteins, which we named MAC3A and MAC3B, are 82% identical to each other at the amino acid level. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis MAC3A and MAC3B with homologous sequences in several eukaryotes reveals a highly conserved U-box domain at the N-terminus (CITATION). U-box domains have been shown to exhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in several eukaryotic proteins. In a recent survey of plant U-box proteins, MAC3B was shown to exhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro CITATION, an enzymatic activity that has also been demonstrated in yeast and human Prp19 proteins CITATION,CITATION . In addition, these proteins contain a number of C-terminal WD-40 repeats predicted to engage in protein-protein interactions CITATION. Since the MAC3 homolog in yeast and human is an integral member of the NTC and MAC3A and MAC3B were identified as potential MAC components in this study (CITATION), we were interested in testing if the biological function of MAC3 is related to MOS4 through the analysis of knockout mutants. T-DNA insertion mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) CITATION. Salk_089300 (mac3a) carries an insertion in the intron between exons 10 and 11 of MAC3A, and Salk_050811 (mac3b) carries an insertion in the intron between exons 16 and 17 of MAC3B (CITATION). Homozygous lines were identified by PCR-based genotyping. To determine whether the T-DNA insertions affect MAC3A and MAC3B expression, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using cDNA-specific primers flanking the insertions. As shown in CITATION, mac3a and mac3b both exhibit significantly reduced mRNA expression. Given that MAC3A and MAC3B are 82% identical and single mac3a and mac3b mutants showed no aberrant morphological phenotypes (CITATION), we hypothesized that MAC3A and MAC3B may function redundantly. When we crossed mac3a and mac3b to create a double mac3a mac3b mutant, plants with a distinct morphology similar to mos4-1 were observed. These plants are slightly smaller than Col-0 wild type (CITATION), have darker leaves, and they flower late (data not shown). Genotyping of the F2 progeny confirmed that only these plants were homozygous for both mac3a and mac3b alleles, indicating that the observed mutant phenotypes co-segregate with both T-DNA insertions and that mutations in both genes are the likely cause of the observed phenotypes. (A) Gene structures of MAC3A (At1g04510) and MAC3B (At2g33340) showing the position of T-DNA insertions Salk_089300 (mac3a) and Salk_050811 (mac3b). Lines indicate introns and boxes indicate exons. The location of translation start (ATG) and stop (TGA) codons are found in the first and last exons, as indicated. (B) Expression levels of MAC3A and MAC3B in Col-0, mac3a, mac3b, and mac3a mac3b mutants as indicated by semi-quantitative RT–PCR using cDNA–specific primers flanking the T–DNA insertion sites. (C) Growth of P.s.t. DC3000 at 0 and 3 days post-inoculation. Values represent an average of four replicates±SD. An unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance of bacterial growth compared to Col-0. Asterisk indicates P<0.001. (D) Growth of P.s.m. ES4326 at 0 and 3 days post-inoculation. P35S-MAC3A-CFP and P35S-MAC3B are expressed in the mac3a mac3b background. Values represent an average of four replicates±SD. An unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance of bacterial growth compared to Col-0. Asterisk indicates P<0.0001. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Since mutations in any of the three previously characterized MAC genes MOS4, AtCDC5 and PRL1 result in enhanced disease susceptibility, and since the mac3a mac3b mutant phenocopies mos4-1 morphologically, we tested if MAC3 is likewise required for plant immunity against virulent pathogens. To test whether MAC3 is required for basal defense responses, mac3a and mac3b single mutants and mac3a mac3b double mutants were infected with a low dose (OD600 = 0.0001) of the bacterial pathogens P. syringae p.v. tomato (P.s.t.) DC3000 and P.s.m. ES4236 and pathogen growth was assayed after three days. Resistance to P.s.t. DC3000 and P.s.m. ES4326 was similar in Col-0, mac3a and mac3b single mutants but was compromised in mac3a mac3b double mutant plants, which harboured an over 10-fold higher titer of bacteria compared to Col-0 in both cases (CITATION). This is similar to bacterial growth in mos4-1 and Atcdc5-2 (CITATION). Importantly, transgenic expression of either MAC3A or MAC3B cDNA driven by the constitutive 35S promoter complements mac3a mac3b morphology (CITATION) and susceptibility to P.s.m. ES4326 (CITATION). Thus, the enhanced susceptibility phenotype observed in mac3a mac3b double mutants is due to the mutations in MAC3A and MAC3B. Together, these data suggest that MAC3A and MAC3B play redundant roles in basal defense against virulent pathogens. To test whether different R protein-mediated signaling pathways rely on MAC3, we challenged mac3a, mac3b, and mac3a mac3b mutants with pathogens that express specific effectors recognized by distinct R proteins in Arabidopsis. Resistance against P.s.t. DC3000 expressing either avrRps4 (recognized by the TIR-NB-LRR R protein RESISTANT TO P. SYRINGAE 4; RPS4) or avrPphB (recognized by the CC-NB-LRR R protein RPS5) is compromised in mac3a mac3b double mutants but is unaffected in mac3a or mac3b single mutants, as indicated by an approximate 10-fold increase in bacterial growth in mac3a mac3b plants three days after infection compared to Col-0 (CITATION). Conversely, resistance against avrRpm1 (conditioned by the CC-NB-LRR R protein RESISTANCE TO P.S.M. 1; RPM1) is not impaired in mac3a mac3b double mutants, as bacterial growth is comparable to Col-0 (CITATION). Resistance against Hyaloperonospora arabidopsis (H.a., formerly H.parasitica) isolate Cala2 (recognized by the TIR-NB-LRR R protein RESISTANT TO PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 2; RPP2) is also unaffected in mac3a, mac3b, or mac3a mac3b, as indicated by the level of conidiospores collected one week after infection, which was similar to Col-0 (CITATION). Together, these data further support redundancy between MAC3A and MAC3B, and suggest that these proteins are required for signaling pathways mediated by specific TIR- and CC-NB-LRR R proteins. (A–C) Growth of the bacterial pathogens P.s.t. avrRps4, P.s.t. avrPphB, and P.s.t. avrRpm1 at 0 and 3 days post-inoculation. Values represent an average of four replicates±SD. An unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance of bacterial growth compared to Col-0. Asterisks indicate P<0.0005. (D) Growth of avirulent H.a. isolate Cala2 seven days post-inoculation on 2-week-old seedlings. eds1-2 introgressed in Col-0 was used as a positive control for pathogen growth. Values represent an average of two replicates of at least 20 plants per genotype±SD. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Mutations in MOS4 or AtCDC5 suppress snc1, indicating that these MAC proteins contribute to snc1-mediated resistance CITATION. To test if MAC3 is also part of the snc1 pathway, we crossed snc1 with mac3a mac3b to obtain a snc1 mac3a mac3b triple mutant. Whereas snc1 plants are of small stature and have dark, curly leaves, the triple mutant does not exhibit snc1-like morphology and resembles the mac3a mac3b double mutant (CITATION). The snc1 mutant exhibits enhanced resistance to the virulent pathogens P.s.m. ES4326 and H.a. isolate Noco2 CITATION. To test if snc1-mediated enhanced resistance is impaired in snc1 mac3a mac3b plants, we infected plants with these two pathogens. As shown in CITATION, snc1 mac3a mac3b triple mutants sustain an approximate 100-fold higher titer of P.s.m. ES4326 compared to snc1 three days after infection, to a level similar to mac3a mac3b (CITATION). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of P35S-MAC3A or P35S-MAC3B into snc1 mac3a mac3b restored snc1 morphology (CITATION) and resistance to P.s.m. ES4326 (CITATION). Furthermore, snc1 mac3a mac3b mutants are as susceptible to infection by H.a. isolate Noco2 as Col-0 plants (CITATION), indicating that mac3a mac3b completely suppresses snc1-related enhanced resistance to these pathogens. In addition to increased resistance, snc1 plants also accumulate high levels of the defense signaling molecule SA. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of SA extracts collected from Col-0, snc1, and snc1 mac3a mac3b plants revealed a marked reduction in endogenous free and total SA levels in the triple mutant comparable to the levels in Col-0 (CITATION). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that mac3a mac3b also suppresses the expression of PR-1 and PR-2, which are constitutively up-regulated in snc1 plants (CITATION). Together, these data demonstrate that, similar to mos4-1, mac3a mac3b completely suppresses snc1-mediated autoimmune phenotypes.

(D) Free and total SA was extracted from leaf tissue from 3-week-old soil-grown plants and analyzed by HPLC. Values represent the average of 4 replicates±SD. (E) Semi-quantitative RT–PCR of the pathogenesis-related genes PR-1 and PR-2. Actin1 was included as a control. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Several lines of evidence already suggest that MAC3 localizes to the nuclear compartment. First, both MAC3A and MAC3B proteins were isolated by affinity purification from nuclear protein extracts as described above (CITATION). In addition, MAC3A and MAC3B have nuclear localization signals in their protein sequence, as predicted by PSORT (version 6.4; CITATION). To confirm that MAC3 is nuclear, we created P35S-MAC3A-CFP and P35S-CFP-MAC3B fusion constructs and transiently transformed onion cells by particle bombardment. In both cases, transformed cells showed exclusive nuclear localization (data not shown), as observed by a fluorescence microscope. To corroborate this data, we created stable P35S-MAC3A-CFP transgenic lines in the mac3a mac3b background using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The majority (10/11) of transgenic plants complemented mac3a mac3b morphological phenotypes, and all complementing lines showed exclusive nuclear localization of P35S-MAC3A-CFP under a confocal microscope. Importantly, resistance to P.s.m. ES4326 was restored in mac3a mac3b P35S-MAC3A-CFP plants (CITATION), indicating proper localization of over-expressed MAC3A-CFP. Guard cells from one of these lines are shown in CITATION, however nuclear localization was also observed in other tissues including roots (data not shown). Likewise, expression of P35S-CFP-MAC3B in complementing mac3a mac3b lines (data not shown) also showed distinct nuclear localization (CITATION). Expression of P35S-MAC3A-CFP or P35S-CFP-MAC3B in snc1 mac3a mac3b also displayed nuclear localization (data not shown), indicating that MAC3A and MAC3B localization is not altered in snc1. Together, these data suggest that MAC3 localizes to the nucleus. (A) Complementation of P35S-MAC3A-CFP and P35S-MAC3A-HA in mac3a mac3b. Growth of virulent P.s.m. ES4326 at 0 and 3 days post-inoculation. Values represent an average of four replicates±SD. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. An unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance of bacterial growth compared to Col-0. Asterisk indicates P<0.0005. (B) Confocal microscopy was used to examine the localization of P35S-MAC3A-CFP in transgenic mac3a mac3b plants. Guard cells from a representative line are shown. DAPI was used as a control for nuclear localization. While cloning MAC3B, we noticed a discrepancy at the 3′ end of the MAC3B cDNA sequence. Sequence analysis of both strands of two individually cloned full-length MAC3B cDNA constructs confirmed the presence of two cytosines at a position previously shown to contain only one cytosine (CITATION). This extra cytosine causes a shift in frame and results in an earlier stop codon than the one predicted by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR8), making the protein 525 amino acids as opposed to the predicted 563 amino acids in length. The corrected cDNA sequence translates into a polypeptide that better aligns at the C-terminal end with MAC3A and Prp19 (CITATION). This corrected MAC3B cDNA sequence has been deposited to GenBank under accession number FJ820118. Prp19 interacts with CDC5 in yeast and human cells CITATION,CITATION,CITATION. Since the MAC seems to be conserved across eukaryotes, we hypothesized that this interaction might also be conserved in Arabidopsis. To confirm that MAC3 associates with the MAC, and to corroborate our MS data, we tested whether MAC3 interacts with AtCDC5. To do this, P35S-MAC3A-HA tagged fusion constructs were stably transformed into mac3a mac3b by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. This fusion protein fully complements mac3a mac3b mutant phenotypes and susceptibility to P.s.m. ES4326 (CITATION) suggesting that it functions the same as the native protein. Total nuclear protein was extracted from transgenic plants and MAC3A-HA was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA microbeads. Western blot analysis using an anti-AtCDC5 antibody revealed that AtCDC5 is present only in the eluant isolated from transgenic plants expressing MAC3A-HA and not from Col-0 control plants (CITATION). A similar result was obtained when complementing P35S-MAC3A-CFP transgenic plants in the mac3a mac3b background were used in an independent co-IP experiment using anti-GFP microbeads (CITATION). Thus, as in human and yeast, AtCDC5 and MAC3 associate with each other as components of the MAC in Arabidopsis. Total nuclear extracts were isolated from a complementing mac3a mac3b transgenic line expressing P35S-MAC3A-HA (+) and Col-0 (−). MAC3A-HA was immunoprecipitated using anti–HA microbeads. MAC3A-HA and AtCDC5 were detected in the eluted fractions by western blot analysis using antibodies against HA or AtCDC5.
!~MM~! For most experiments, plants were grown on soil in a 16h light / 8h dark regime. T-DNA mutants were obtained from the ABRC and genotyped by PCR using the insertion-flanking primers 089300-F (5′-CGGAAGTTCTTTAACTTGCGC-3′) and 089300-R (5′-GTGTTAACTGCTTCATCCGAC-3′) for mac3a, or 050811-F (5′-ACGGAATACTAAGCAGACCAC-3′) and 050811-R (5′-TGTTGTGCAGTGGAGTTTGATC-3′) for mac3b. Isolation of the mos4-1 mutant was previously described CITATION. Bacterial and oomycete infections were performed as described in CITATION. Briefly, bacterial pathogens were inoculated on the abaxial leaf surfaces of four-week old plants using a needless syringe. Leaf discs (with an area of 0.38 cm2) were collected on the day of infection (Day 0) and three days later (Day 3) from different plants. H.a. isolates were spray-inoculated onto adaxial leaf surfaces of two-week old seedlings and counted using a hemocytometer seven to ten days later. RNA was extracted from 20 day old seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium using the Totally RNA Kit (Ambion). Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The primers used to amplify PR-1, PR-2 and Actin 1 have been described previously CITATION. MAC3A and MAC3B cDNA was amplified for expression analysis using the primers 089300RT-F (5′-CGTTGGTGACACTGATCTTG-3′), 089300RT-R (5′GCAGCAGCCGTGTAATTCAC-3′), 050811RT-F (5′-ATCTGCAGATGCGAACTCTG-3′) and 050811RT-R (5′-CCATTGCTGCAAATACTGTA-3′). SA was extracted and measured by HPLC from three-week old plants using a procedure described in CITATION. To obtain the mac3a mac3b double mutant, homozygous mac3a and mac3b plants were crossed and the double was identified in the F2 using PCR-based genotyping. The snc1 mac3a mac3b triple mutant was obtained by crossing a homozygous snc1 single mutant plant with a homozygous mac3a mac3b double mutant. snc1 was fixed in the F2 first by phenotype and later confirmed by PCR using primers described previously CITATION. The other two loci were confirmed by PCR to be heterozygous, and the triple mutant was identified in the F3. A backcross with snc1 confirmed the genotype of the triple as all F1 individuals showed typical snc1 morphology. A similar procedure was used to create the mos4-1 mac3a mac3b and prl1-1 mac3a mac3b triple mutants. All genotypes were confirmed by PCR. A genomic fragment spanning the full-length MOS4 gene (gMOS4), without the stop codon but including a 1.5 kb sequence upstream of the translation initiation codon, was amplified from Col-0 DNA using Phusion Taq (Finnzymes) with the primers 5′-CACCACACTGCTAGAGGTCTTGG-3′, and 5′-TTGCATTTGAAGTGGCTCGAC-3′. Similarly, the open reading frames (without the stop codons) of MAC3A and MAC3B were amplified from cDNA using the primers 5′-CACCATGAATTGTGCAATTTCCGGC-3′, and 5′-TGAATCTTGTGCTGAATCTTC-3′ for MAC3A, and 5′-CACCATGAACTGTGCAATTTCAGGAG-3′, and 5′-TGAAATTCTCCCCCATTGCTG-3 for MAC3B. These Gateway-adapted PCR fragments were cloned into pENTR using the Gateway pENTR/D-Topo kit (Invitrogen). Entry vectors were confirmed by sequencing using the M13F and M13R primers. For gMOS4, recombination into the pGWB13 binary destination vector with a C-terminal 3xHA tag CITATION was done using Gateway LR Clonase (Invitrogen). Transgenic seedlings were selected on MS plates containing 50 µg/ml Kanamycin and 50 µg/ml Hygromycin and confirmed by PCR. For MAC3A and MAC3B, recombination into destination binary vectors with a constitutive 35S promoter for C-terminal and N-terminal fusion protein expression analysis in Arabidopsis and onion was done using Gateway LR Clonase (Invitrogen). Destination vectors used were either N-terminal cCFP, C-terminal cCFP, or C-terminal 3xHA-StrepII. Transgenic seedlings were selected on soil with the herbicide Basta and confirmed by PCR. Cells of transgenic seedlings grown on MS medium containing 10 mg/ml Basta were examined under the confocal microscope for CFP fluorescence as described in CITATION. Approximately 100 g of leaf tissue from complementing MOS4-HA in mos4-1 was frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground into a fine powder using a pestle and mortar and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose) at 4°C. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and then sequentially filtered through 100-, 70-, and 30-µm mesh nylon netting. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 minutes and washed twice with nuclei resuspension buffer (NRBT; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). The nuclear fraction was resuspended gently in NRB and centrifuged at 100 g for 5 minutes to remove cell debris. Nuclei were pelleted by spinning the supernatant at 1500 g for 10 minutes and were resuspended in ice-cold buffer NE-2 (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.42 M NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, with protease inhibitors). Nuclei were sonicated for 2 minutes in an ice-bath, incubated on ice for 30 minutes, and spun for 30 minutes at 25000×g at 4°C, releasing the nuclear proteins into the supernatant. The nuclear fraction was dialyzed in buffer NE-3 (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, with protease inhibitors) for 5 hours before adding Anti-HA microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.). After gentle mixing for 30 minutes on ice, the microbeads were magnetically precipitated on columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (µMACS). The microbeads were washed eight times before elution. For identification of MOS4-HA interacting proteins, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with a mass spectrometry-compatible silver staining kit (Invitrogen). The MOS4-HA IP lane was cut into eight pieces and digested with trypsin, and the resulting proteins were analyzed by MS (see below). To test the in planta interaction between MAC3A-HA and AtCDC5, a similar protein extraction procedure was employed. Approximately 15 g of leaf tissue from complementing P35S-MAC3A-HA in mac3a mac3b was frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in lysis buffer as above. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and sequentially filtered through 95- and 37- µm mesh nylon netting. The nuclei were pelleted as before and washed 3 times in NRBT buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100. The nuclei were then washed with NRB buffer without Triton X-100 once. Nuclei were pelleted as above and resuspended in ice-cold NE-2 buffer with the following modifications: 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100. Nuclei were sonicated and pelleted as above but were not dialyzed prior to the addition of anti-HA microbeads, which were precipitated according to the manufacuter's instructions, as above. The microbeads were washed eight times prior to elution with NE-2 buffer with the following modifications: 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100. The eluted fraction was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western Blot analysis using anti-HA (Roche) or anti-AtCDC5 CITATION antibodies. Protein bands of interest were sliced from the gel and cut into small pieces. After de-staining with ProteoSilver Distainer A and B (ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit, Sigma), the gel pieces were washed twice with ultra pure water and dehydrated in acetonitrile. The gel pieces were further dried in a CentriVap concentrator (Labconco) and then digested in-gel with 10 ng/µL sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) at 37°C overnight. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted with 50–100 µl of 5% formic acid/50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid/75% acetonitrile sequentially. The two extracts were combined and concentrated to around 10 µL in the CentriVap concentrator. The tryptic peptides were loaded to a pre-column (75 µm×8 cm) packed with 5–15 µm spherical C18 reverse phase particles (YMC). The pre-column was connected to a home-made analytical column (50 µm×10 cm) packed with YMC 5 µm spherical C18 reverse phase particles. The tip size of the analytical column was around 2 µm and the flow rate was controlled at 20–50 nl/min. To elute peptides from the column, an Agilent 1100 series binary pumps system (Agilent Technologies) was used to generate the following HPLC gradient: 0–5% B in 5 min, 5–40% B in 25 min, 40–100% B in 10 min (A = 0.1 M acetic acid in water, B = 0.1 M acetic acid /70% acetonitrile). The eluted peptides were sprayed directly into a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (MDS SCIEX) equipped with a nano-ESI ion source under 2.1 kV spray voltage. The mass spectra were collected in information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode cycling with one MS scan followed by three MS/MS scans. The mass range of the MS scan was 400–2000 Da, and 100–2000 Da for MS/MS scans. For each MS scan, the top 3 most abundant precursor ions were selected for MS/MS scans using low resolution for precursor ion isolation with enhance all mode. Database searches were performed on an in-house Mascot server (version 2.1, Matrix Science Ltd.) against the NCBI non-redundant protein database.
