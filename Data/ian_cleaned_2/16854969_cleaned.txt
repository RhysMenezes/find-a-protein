!~ABS~! The transcriptional repression of key regulatory genes is crucial for plant and animal development. Previously, we identified and isolated two Arabidopsis transcription co-repressors LEUNIG (LUG) and SEUSS (SEU) that function together in a putative co-repressor complex to prevent ectopic AGAMOUS (AG) transcription in flowers. Because neither LUG nor SEU possesses a recognizable DNA-binding motif, how they are tethered to specific target promoters remains unknown. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that APETALA1 (AP1) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), both MADS box DNA-binding proteins, interacted with SEU. The AP1-SEU protein-protein interaction was supported by synergistic genetic interactions between ap1 and seu mutations. The role of SEU proteins in bridging the interaction between AP1/SEP3 and LUG to repress target gene transcription was further demonstrated in yeast and plant cells, providing important mechanistic insights into co-repressor function in plants. Furthermore, a direct in vivo association of SEU proteins with the AG cis-regulatory element was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Accordingly, a reporter gene driven by the AG cis-element was able to respond to AP1- and SEP3-mediated transcriptional repression in a transient plant cell system when supplied with SEU and LUG. These results suggest that AP1 and SEP3 may serve as the DNA-binding partners of SEU/LUG. Our demonstration of the direct physical interaction between SEU and the C-terminal domain of SEP3 and AP1 suggests that AP1 and SEP3 MADS box proteins may interact with positive, as well as negative, regulatory proteins via their C-terminal domains, to either stimulate or repress their regulatory targets.
!~RES~! To test our first model on how the putative LUG/SEU complex may interact with a whorl-specific floral gene product with DNA-binding activities, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay against several DNA-binding transcription factors in flower development, including AP1, APETALA2 (AP2), LEAFY (LFY) and BELLRINGER (BRL) (Bao et al., 2004; Jofuku et al., 1994; Mandel et al., 1992; Weigel et al., 1992). Although LUG failed to interact with any of the proteins tested (data not shown), SEU interacted strongly with AP1 (Fig. 1A). To test the specificity of the interaction between SEU and AP1, other MADS box genes belonging to the B and E classes were subsequently tested. A strong interaction between SEU and SEP3 was found (Fig. 1A). However, an interaction between SEU and AP3 or PI was not detected (Fig. 1A). The interaction between SEU and AP1 or SEP3 protein was confirmed by the in vitro pull-down assay. 35S-labeled AP1, SEP3 or AP3 was bound to SEU-GST resins. After washing, AP1 and SEP3, but not AP3, were retained by the SEUGST resins (Fig. 1C).   [[FIGURE]] To determine the domain of AP1 or SEP3 that interacts with SEU, AP1 and SEP3 were each divided into the N-terminal MIK (MADS-box, Intervening region, and K-box) domain and the C (carboxyl) domain. In yeast, SEU failed to interact with either AP1-MIK or SEP-MIK but interacted with AP1-C and SEP3-C (Fig. 1B). The interaction of SEU with the C terminus of AP1 or SEP3 is weaker than with the full-length AP1 or SEP3 (compare Fig. 1A with 1B). This weaker interaction is confirmed by the in vitro pull-down assay (Fig. 1C). There are two possible explanations for the weak interaction between SEU and AP1-C or SEP3-C. First, AP1-C or SEP3-C protein truncations may be less stable than full-length proteins. Second, AP1 or SEP3 may require homo- or heterodimerization in order to strongly interact with SEU. Dimerization is likely to be absent for these C-terminal truncations. The C-terminal domain is the most divergent domain of MADS box proteins with no obvious sequence similarity among AP1, SEP3, AP3 and PI except that AP1-C and SEP3-C are both rich in glutamine (Q). It remains to be seen if the glutamines in AP1-C and SEP3-C are important for the interaction with SEU, which is also Q-rich. The absence of interaction between SEU and the B class proteins AP3 or PI suggests that SEU may specifically interact with a subset of MADS box proteins, including AP1 and SEP3. However, our assay could not exclude the possibility that the AP3/PI heterodimers maybe able to interact with SEU. If SEU but not LUG interacts with AP1 and SEP3, could SEU bridge the interaction between LUG and AP1 or SEP3? This was tested by in vitro pull-down assays using the LUFS domain of LUG tagged by Maltose Binding Protein (MBP). The LUFS domain of LUG was previously shown to be necessary and sufficient for interacting with SEU (Sridhar et al., 2004). The interaction between LUFS-MBP and 35S-labeled AP1, SEP3 or AP3 was tested in the presence or absence of purified SEU (Fig. 1D). In the absence of SEU, LUFS-MBP/amylose resin failed to retain any of the 35S-labeled AP1, SEP3 and AP3 proteins. By contrast, when SEU was added, 35S-labeled AP1 and SEP3, but not 35S-labeled AP3, were retained by the LUFS-MBP/amylose resin. The interaction is specific to LUFS, as MBP alone failed to interact with AP1 or SEP3, even in the presence of SEU (Fig. 1D). If AP1 is a DNA-binding partner of LUG/SEU in AG repression, and partial functional redundancies exist among AP1, LUG and SEU, ap1 mutations may exhibit a synergistic genetic interaction with lug and seu. A synergistic genetic interaction between lug-1 and ap1-1 was previously reported (Liu and Meyerowitz, 1995). A more dramatic transformation from sepals to carpels and a more severe reduction of whorl 2-3 organs were observed in lug-1 ap1-1 double mutants. The enhanced phenotype correlated with an increased ectopic AG expression in the lug-1 ap1-1 double mutants (Liu and Meyerowitz, 1995). We constructed seu-1 ap1 double mutants using weak ap1-3 (Fig. 2C) and strong ap1-1 (Fig. 2G,H) alleles. The genetic synergy is more striking between the weak ap1-3 and seu-1. Both seu-1 and ap1-3 single mutants are fertile and develop petals in whorl 2 (Fig. 2A-C). In ap1-3 seu-1 double mutant flowers, whorl 1 organs are transformed into carpelloid organs with horn-like projections and whorl 2 organs are absent (Fig. 2E). The double mutants form small siliques and exhibit reduced fertility. In addition, ap1-3/ap1-3 plants heterozygous for seu-1 (i.e. ap1-3/ap1-3; seu-1/+) exhibited a much stronger floral phenotype than did ap1-3 single mutants (Fig. 2F). In addition to the floral phenotype, plant height is also affected, with ap1-3/ap1-3; seu-1/+ being 75% of the height of ap1-3 single mutants and ap1-3 seu-1 double homozygotes being 50% of the height of ap1-3 single mutants (Fig. 2D). seu-1 single mutants are similar to seu-1 ap1-3 in height. Overall, seu-1 ap1-3 double mutants showed a floral phenotype similar to but more severe than seu-1, suggesting that ap1-3 enhances seu-1 in floral organ identity specification.   [[FIGURE]] By contrast, the ap1-1 seu-1 double mutants (Fig. 2I,J) exhibited a more dramatic enhancement in the meristem defects with inflorescences resembling, but being less severely affected than, those of ap1 cal double mutants. Each floral meristem gave rise to a secondary floral meristem, which generated tertiary and higher order meristems (Fig. 2J). Eventually, these floral meristems differentiated into flowers with carpelloid first whorl organs (Fig. 2J) and reduced fertility. seu-1/+ heterozygotes also enhanced ap1-1 giving rise to more pronounced meristem defects than did ap1-1 single mutants (data not shown). Our data strongly support a functional relevance of AP1-SEU interaction, not only in organ identity specification, but also in meristem identity specification. To reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between AP1/SEP3 and SEU, we tested whether direct interaction between AP1 and SEU, or between SEP3 and SEU, in yeast could lead to the recruitment of LUG and the subsequent repression of reporter gene expression. Yeast containing an integrated GAL7-lacZ reporter was transformed with AP1-BD or SEP3-BD in the presence or absence of SEU or LUG. AP1-BD and SEP3-BD were previously reported to activate a lacZ reporter via their C-terminal domain (Honma and Goto, 2001) (Fig. 3A, lanes 3, 9). This activity of AP1-BD or SEP3-BD was reduced by 50-62% when SEU was induced by galactose (Fig. 3A, lanes 4, 10). This was, at first, unexpected, as SEU-BD was previously shown to exhibit no repressor activity when tethered to heterologous promoters by GAL4-BD (Sridhar et al., 2004). The reduction of lacZ by SEU is likely to be due to a direct physical block of the AP1 and SEP3 C-terminal domain by SEU. lacZ expression was further reduced to background level when LUG was introduced together with SEU (Fig. 3A, lanes 6, 12). In the absence of SEU, LUG did not exert any repressor activity in yeast expressing AP1-BD or SEP3-BD (Fig. 3A, lanes 5, 11). The requirement for SEU in mediating the effect of LUG was further demonstrated by showing a lack of enhanced repression when LUGdeltaLUFS (LUG lacking the LUFS domain) instead of full-length LUG was introduced into yeast expressing AP1-BD or SEP3-BD together with SEU (Fig. 3A; lanes 8, 14). LUGdeltaLUFS could no longer interact with SEU (Sridhar et al., 2004) and was unable to be recruited to repress the reporter gene. The second intron of AG was previously shown to direct GUS reporter expression in a pattern identical to endogenous AG (Busch et al., 1999; Sieburth and Meyerowitz, 1997). This pAG-I::GUS reporter responded to LUG regulation (Sieburth and Meyerowitz, 1997). The AG second intron can be divided into two nonoverlapping but functionally redundant 5′ and 3′ enhancers (Busch et al., 1999; Deyholos and Sieburth, 2000). The 3′ enhancer contains the binding sites for LFY and WUSCHEL (WUS), as well as two CArG boxes, the target-binding sites of MADS box proteins. To test AP1, SEP3, LUG and SEU activity in a biologically relevant context, we constructed a LUC reporter driven by the 3′ enhancer (pAG3′I::LUC; Fig. 3B). Because a direct regulatory role of AG by AP1 or SEP3 has not been established, we first tested whether AP1 or SEP3 could regulate pAG3′I::LUC expression. In a transient assay using onion epidermal cells, pAG3′I::LUC responded to AP1 and SEP3 activation (Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 6), with SEP3 showing a higher transcription activator activity than AP1. To test whether LUG and SEU could repress the positive regulatory effect of AP1 and SEP3 on the pAG3′I::LUC reporter, 35S::SEU or 35S::LUG was co-transfected with 35S::AP1 or 35S:SEP3. 35S::LUG alone does not interfere with AP1 or SEP3 activities (Fig. 3C, lanes 3, 7). By contrast, 35S::SEU reduced the LUC expression level to 48-55% (Fig. 3C, lanes 4, 8). Simultaneous introduction of 35S::LUG and 35S::SEU into the onion epidermal cells further reduced reporter expression to about 24-26% (Fig. 3C, lanes 5, 9), suggesting that, through its interaction with SEU, LUG is recruited to the pAG3′I::LUC reporter to repress its expression. This result suggests that AP1 and SEP3 may act upon the AG 3′ enhancer, possibly via the two CArG boxes. Similar to the results obtained from reporter gene expression in yeast (Fig. 3A), AP1 and SEP3 are converted from transcription activators to repressors simply by their interaction with the SEU/LUG co-repressor.   [[FIGURE]] Although previous genetic and molecular analyses indicated that LUG and SEU exert their negative regulatory effect on AG via the second intron of AG (Sieburth and Meyerowitz, 1997), our second model, that LUG/SEU represses AG by repressing the expression of positive regulators of AG such as LFY or WUS, could not be excluded. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we investigated whether SEU directly associates with the AG 3′ enhancer in vivo. Chromatin isolated from the inflorescences of wild type and seu-3 was precipitated by the anti-SEU antibody (αSEU Ab). seu-3 is a nonsense mutation at residue 127 (Pfluger and Zambryski, 2004), which results in a truncated SEU protein lacking the epitope for the αSEU Ab. The αSEU Ab was able to immunoprecipitate sequences within the AG 3′ enhancer (AG-3), but not sequences within the 5′ enhancer (AG-5) (Fig. 4A,B). Furthermore, the AG-3 probe was precipitated only from wild-type chromatin, not from the seu-3 chromatin. SEU protein is therefore associated with the 3′ enhancer of AG, supporting a direct regulatory role of SEU in AG repression. The association of SEU protein with the 3′ enhancer but not with the 5′ enhancer is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, where AP1 and SEP3 act upon the AG 3′ enhancer.
!~MM~! The yeast strains PJ69-4A (James et al., 1996) and SEU-BD have been described previously (Sridhar et al., 2004). AP1-AD and SEP3-AD in pACT2 (Honma and Goto, 2001), PI-AD (pD1293) in pGAL4-C and AP3-BD (pD1294) in pGBDU-C (Yang et al., 2003) were gifts from Drs K. Goto and T. Jack, respectively. To construct AP3-AD, AP3 was excised from pD1294 as a BamHI/PstI fragment and inserted into pGAL4-C at the same sites. AP1-MIK and SEP3-MIK were excised from the AP1-AD and SEP3-AD in pACT2 (Honma and Goto, 2001) as an NcoI/SacI fragment and cloned into pET30a (Novagen) at the same sites. Subsequently, the respective MIK fragment was excised as an NcoI/XhoI fragment from above pET30a-MIK and inserted into pGADT7 (Clontech). AP1-C and SEP3-C were excised from the AP1-AD and SEP3-AD in pACT2 (Honma and Goto, 2001) as a SacI/XhoI fragment, and cloned into pET30a and pET30c at the same sites, respectively. Subsequently, AP1-C and SEP3-C were excised as an NcoI/XhoI fragment and cloned into pGADT7 (Clontech). The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as previously described (Sridhar et al., 2004).β -galactosidase activity was measured in triplicate using the Galacto Light Plus Kit (Applied Biosystems) and normalized with the OD of the culture. Full-length SEU cDNA was excised from HFFL#7 (Sridhar et al., 2004) with HindIII/XhoI and inserted into p426GALL (Mumberg et al., 1994). As a result, SEU was driven by the GALL promoter and its expression is induced by galactose. LUG and LUGdeltaLUFS were expressed from pGAD424 (Clontech) but with the GAL4-AD domain removed. Specifically, KpnI and SmaI were used to digest LUG-AD and LUGdeltaLUFS-AD in pGAD424 (Sridhar et al., 2004), and religated to delete the GAL4-AD. The pGADdelta424 control vector was similarly treated to remove the GAL4-AD from pGAD424 (Clontech). AP1-BD in pAS2-1 was a gift from Dr K. Goto (Honma and Goto, 2001). SEP3-BD was constructed by digesting SEP3 in pACT2 (Honma and Goto, 2001) with NcoI/Xho1. The NcoI/XhoI fragment was cloned into pGBTK7 (Clontech) at the NcoI/SalI sites. For yeast strain PJ69-4A (James et al., 1996), yeast transformation and β-galactosidase assay were similarly performed as the yeast two-hybrid assay. AP1-BD or SEP3-BD was selected by -Trp, and LUG or LUGdeltaLUFS was selected by -Leu. SEU was selected by Ura3, and its expression was induced by the addition of galactose instead of glucose in the media. Data shown in Fig. 3A are averages of triplicates, and the experiment was repeated twice. His-tagged AP1 and AP3 were gifts from Dr X. Chen (U.C. Riverside). Full-length AP1 and AP3 cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites in pRSET (Invitrogen). API-C and SEP3-C were excised from AP1-AD and SEP3-AD in pACT2 (Honma and Goto, 2001) as a SacI/XhoI fragment and cloned into pET30a and pET30c (Novagen), respectively. Full-length SEP3 was excised from SEP3-AD in pACT2 as an NcoI/XhoI fragment and cloned into the same sites of pET30a (Novagen). Plasmid templates were used for synthesizing 35S-radiolabeled AP1, SEP3 and AP3 proteins with the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). The TnT reaction mix (5 μl) was loaded directly onto a NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) as the input control. For two-protein pulldown, GST-SEU protein was purified from bacteria as previously described (Sridhar et al., 2004). GST-SEU protein (5 μg) bound on the GST.Bind resin (Novagen) was incubated with 15 μl 35S reaction mix from TnT for 2 hours at room temperature. The GST-SEU bound resin was washed five times with cold 1×PBS, resuspended in protein gel loading buffer, heated and loaded directly to the NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), and run for 3 hours at 70 V. For three-protein pulldown, MBP and MBP-LUFS proteins were purified from bacteria as previously described (Sridhar et al., 2004). MBP-LUFS proteins were bound to amylose beads. After an extensive wash with cold 1×PBS, 10 μl MBP-LUFS/amylose beads were estimated for protein concentration. MBP-LUFS/amylose beads (5 μg) were then incubated at 4°C for two hours with 5 μg SEU-GST eluted from the GST.Bind resin, as well as 15 μl 35S-labeled AP3, SEP3 or AP1 from TnT. The MBP-LUFS/amylose resin was washed five times with cold 1×PBS, resuspended in protein gel loading buffer, heated and then loaded onto the NuPAGE gel. To construct the pAG3′I::LUC reporter, primer pair AGdF (5′-TGGTCTGCCTTCTACGATCC-3′) and AGdR (5′-TTAATTTCTGCCACCGATCC-3′) was used to amplify the ∼900 bp AG 3′ enhancer using Columbia genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was TA-cloned into pCRII-TOPO (clone #27). The ∼900 bp AG fragment was excised from clone #27 with KpnI/XhoI and inserted into -58/LUC, a gift from Dr Krizek. -58/LUC was constructed by inserting the -58/+6 fragment of the 35S promoter into the BglII site of pGL3 (Promega), destroying the BglII site (Krizek and Sulli, 2006). Full-length AP1 and SEP3 were excised as an NcoI/XhoI fragment from their respective pACT2 plasmids (Honma and Goto, 2001) and inserted into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pSPUTK (Stratagene). AP1 and SEP3 were subsequently excised from pSPUTK as a HindIII/XbaI fragment, and cloned into pART7 (Gleave, 1992) at the same sites to yield 35S::AP1 and 35S::SEP3. 35S::LUG was described previously (Sridhar et al., 2004). 35S::SEU was constructed by excising SEU from HFFL#7 (Sridhar et al., 2004) as a SalI/XbaI fragment and inserted in pART7 at the same sites. One microgram of pAG3′I::LUC, 100 ng 35S::Renilla LUC, 1 μg 35S::AP1 (or 35S::SEP3), 1 μg 35S::SEU and 2 μg of 35S::LUG were mixed and introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment following the protocol of Padmanabhan et al. (Padmanabhan et al., 2005). Total DNA was maintained constant at 5 μg per transformation by using the pART7 vector to make up the difference between transformations. Diced onion was bombarded and followed by incubation at room temperature for 16-20 hours in a petri dish containing wet 3MM paper. Epidermal peels were removed from the onion, grounded, lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer and assayed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The data shown in Fig. 3C are averages of triplicate assays. The experiment was repeated twice. seu-1 ap1-1 and seu-1 ap1-3 double mutants were constructed by crossing ap1-1 or ap1-3 with seu-1. Seeds of ap1-like F2 plants were individually collected. These ap1-like plants can be divided into three types. Type I plants were ap1 single mutants, which produced 100% ap1 in F3. Type II plants exhibited a more severe phenotype than ap1 single mutants and segregated three types of progeny in F3, suggesting that type II were homozygous for ap1 but heterozygous for seu-1. Type III plants exhibited the most severe phenotype and produced F3 progeny that all resembled their parent, indicating that type III is homozygous for ap1-1 and seu-1. The segregation patterns of these mutants were verified in F4. The anti-SEU chicken antibody (AA126-139A), a gift of Dr Franks, was raised by Gallus Immunotech against a peptide (CNQLLAEQQRNKKMEKLH) located at the N-terminal domain of SEU. To purify the anti-SEU antibody, 20 μg purified SEU-GST from bacteria was spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and then blocked by 10% milk in 0.01% Tween-TBS (TTBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed five times with TTBS and incubated with 1 ml crude anti-SEU serum overnight at 4°C. After an extensive wash with TTBS, the bound antibody was eluted with 500 μl 0.2 M Glycine (pH 2.8) and immediately neutralized with 50 μl 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purified antiserum was concentrated to 20 μl using the Micon centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described by Kwon et al. (Kwon et al., 2005). Wild-type (Ler, 1.8 g) and seu-3 (1.8 g) inflorescences were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 2 hours. One-twentieth of the eluted DNA was used for PCR (94°C for 1 minute; then 35 cycles of 94°C for 15 seconds, 55°C for 40 seconds and 72°C for 40 seconds). The AG-3 primer pair (5′-CTATGTACAAGTACATATACAGGAAACTC-3′ and 5′-GATAGGGTCAAATCGACCACTTGCACAG-3′) amplifies the 3′ AG second intron. The AG-5 primer pair (5′-GCCGTGGTCGTCTCTATGAGTACTCTAAC-3′ and 5′-CTCCACATTAGAAAAAACCCTGATGG-3′) amplifies the 5′ AG second intron. The control E1F4P primer was based on that described by Kwon et al. (Kwon et al., 2005).
