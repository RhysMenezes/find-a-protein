!~ABS~! Rapid activation of phospholipase A (PLA) by auxin or plant-pathogen interaction suggests a function in signal transduction for this enzyme, but the molecular identification of a cytosolic PLA carrying out this function remains open. We isolated four cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia), AtPLA I,AtPLA IIA, AtPLA IVA, andAtPLA IVC, which are members of the patatin-related PLA gene family in plants and which are homologous to the animal Ca2+-independent PLA2 gene family. Expression was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, andAtPLA I transcripts were found preferentially in shoots,AtPLA IIA and AtPLA IVA in roots, andAtPLA IVC in flowers. Transient expression of the four PLA-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves showed they were located in the cytosol and not in the vacuoles. Surprisingly,AtPLA::green fluorescent protein was also localized to chloroplasts. The enzymatic activity of the purified recombinant AtPLA IVA toward phosphatidylcholine was dependent on Ca2+, saturated at 0.5 mm, and had a pH optimum of about 7.0. It had both PLA1 and PLA2 specificity. The enzyme showed in vitro highest sensitivity toward the PLA2 inhibitors palmitoyltrifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF3,K i approximately 30 nm), arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3,K i approximately 25 μm), and tetrahydro-3-(1-naphtalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (K i approximately 200 nm) and was also sensitive to other previously used inhibitors 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (K iapproximately 3 μm) and nordihydroguajaretic acid (K i approximately 15 μm). The influence of these PLA2 inhibitors on elongation in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings was tested, and tetrahydro-3-(1-naphtalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid inhibited hypocotyl elongation maximally at concentrations close to theirK i in vitro.
!~RES~! By sequence comparisons we could not identify any cPLA2 sequence in the Arabidopsis genome (data not shown), but we identified 10 genes for patatin-like PLA protein sequences, all having the conserved iPLA2-specific sequence motifs. Both the genomic structures and the amino acid comparisons of these sequences suggested that they fall into three groups: group 1 comprising onlyAtPLA I; group 2 comprising AtPLA IIA,AtPLA IVA, AtPLA IVB, AtPLAVIC, andAtPLA V; and group 3 comprising AtPLA IIB,AtPLA IIIA, AtPLA IIIB, and AtPLA IVD (Fig. 1, A and B). Genes or putative genes are named with Roman numerals according to the respective chromosomes, and letters, if multiple genes were located on a single chromosome. When AtPLA I was compared with the animal proteins, scores of 24% to 32% identity were obtained (Fig.2), which is reflected in the unrooted phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B), so that AtPLA I and group 1 is considered to be evolutionary older than the other two plant gene groups. We assume that group 3 is evolutionary younger than group 2, because the catalytic domains of group 3 is different from those of all other known iPLAs, and because group 2 is closest to the presumably old prokaryotic Anabaena spp. sequence. The fact that group 3 sequences have only one intron may be explained by intron loss, as has been observed in other Arabidopsis gene families (CITATION), and may be associated with the evolution of small genomes.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The amino acid sequences derived from cDNAs of AtPLA I,AtPLA IIA, AtPLA IVA, and AtPLA IVC are shown in Figure 2. We also isolated cDNAs for AtPLA IIB,AtPLA IIIA, AtPLA IIIB, AtPLA IVB, andAtPLA IVD (E. Oppermann, A. Holk, and G.F.E. Scherer, unpublished data) but failed to isolate AtPLA V. The full-length cDNA clone of AtPLA I could only be obtained by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. AtPLA I is not only unique by possessing an iPLA2 domain with the highest similarity to animal iPLA2 sequences (Figs. 1B and 2), but also by having two additional domains, a Leu-rich repeat (LRR) at the N terminus and a C-terminal domain that is not similar to other known sequences. For AtPLA I, we isolated two splice variants. The shorter one did not contain the fifth exon and contained a stop codon before the PLA domain (data not shown), whereas the second, longer cDNA included an uninterrupted reading frame comprising all three domains and an additional exon (in comparison with the annotated sequence in accession no. AC004392), that extended the LRR domain. The other, shorter cDNAs were isolated by screening several libraries (AtPLAIIA, IVA, and IVC) or RT-PCR (AtPLA IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IVB, and IVD). We could find only a few ESTs for the Arabidopsis PLA sequences, so we expected low expression and chose competitive RT-PCR to study their expression in different tissues (Fig. 3). The AtPLA I gene was expressed preferentially in shoots and also in flowers and roots, but very little in leaves. GenesAtPLA IIA and AtPLA IVA were expressed in the roots and were much weaker in the flowers, shoots, and leaves. The expression of AtPLA IVC was preferentially observed in flowers but also in roots and was very low in leaves and shoots. Everywhere but in leaves, a somewhat longer splice variant was detected for the AtPLA IVC, but this mRNA was not further investigated. The quite different tissue-specific expression of the isoforms investigated here was reflected in their equally different promoter sequences and was verified by initial experiments with promoter-GUS transformants (not shown). Because the other members of the gene family except AtPLAV could be isolated by RT-PCR (data not shown) this proves that these additional genesAtPLA IIB, AtPLA IIIA, AtPLA IIIB, andAtPLA IVD were also expressed and probably function in Arabidopsis. Sequence AtPLA IIIB was isolated by CITATION, and it is expressed most highly in roots, less in flowers and stems, and least in leaves. A mutant resulting from activation tagging of gene AtPLA IIIB exhibited the “sturdy” phenotype (CITATION). Taken together, these data suggest both tissue preference and functional redundancy for the members of this gene family as has been found for other plant gene families.  [[FIGURE]] Hydropathy plots for various plant patatin-related sequences and the AtPLAs showed that a signal peptide for secretion was present in all the patatins from potato, several from tobacco, and one protein sequence from Cucumis, but not in any of the Arabidopsis sequences (not shown). To demonstrate the suspected cytosolic compartmentation, hybrid PLA-GFP from Arabidopsis proteins were expressed transiently in tobacco leaves (Fig.4). All four expressed sequences,AtPLA I, AtPLA IIA, AtPLA IVA, andAtPLA IVC, clearly were not located to the vacuoles. For AtPLA IIA, AtPLA IVA, and AtPLA IVC, a cytoplasmic localization is suggested, but association with membranes (e.g. plasma membrane or ER) cannot be excluded. As demonstrated by a series of optical sections from palisade parenchyma cells and additional data (not shown), the hybrid protein AtPLA I-GFP colocalized with chloroplasts, although not with all of them in a given cell (Fig. 4, A–C).  [[FIGURE]] In previous studies, known PLA2 inhibitors were used to inhibit auxin-dependent growth (CITATION) or auxin stimulation of a PLA2 activity (CITATION). To be able to compare the effect of inhibitors on an isolated enzyme and on biological responses, it would be desirable to know the enzymological properties of the PLAs and, especially, the reaction of isolated PLA to known PLA2inhibitors. As a first step toward this goal, the gene AtPLA IVA was expressed as a N-terminally his-tagged protein inEscherichia coli and purified (Fig.5A). Enzymatic activity was measured using a fluorescent phosphatidylcholine [1,2-bis-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoyl) - sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (bis-BODIPY-PC)] labeled at both fatty acids by a fluorochrome that was used in previous experiments in vivo (CITATION). Hydrolysis by the purified recombinant enzyme yielded fluorescent free fatty acid and fluorescent lysophosphatidylcholine as products (Fig.5B). When a different phosphatidylcholine was used, carrying a fluorescent fatty acid only at the C2 atom [2-(4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s- indacene-3-dodecanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine], fluorescent lysophosphatidylcholine and fluorescent free fatty acid originated, indicating that the enzyme had both PLA1 and PLA2 activity. Hydrolysis was linear for 45 min (Fig. 5C). Although the sequence ofAtPLA IVA to the iPLA2 class suggests that its activity would be independent of Ca2+, activity assays showed that it was dependent on Ca2+, being saturated at 0.5 mm Ca2+. The pH optimum of the enzyme was about 7.0 (Fig. 6, A and B). The enzyme showed highest sensitivity toward the inhibitors palmitoyltrifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF3;K i approximately 30 nm) and tetrahydro-3-(1-naphtalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (HELSS;K i approximately 200 nm), and it was also sensitive to other previously used inhibitors such as arachidonyltrifluoromethylcarbon (AACOCF3; K iapproximately 25 μm), 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA; K iapproximately 3 μm), and nordihydroguajaretic acid (NDGA; K i approximately 15 μm; Fig. 6, C–G).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] It was previously suggested that a PLA is involved in auxin signal transduction because it became rapidly activated by auxin (CITATION) and PLA2 inhibitors specifically prevented auxin action (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we tested the influence of PLA2 inhibitors on auxin-dependent elongation in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig.7). Of all inhibitors tested, HELSS and ETYA strongly inhibited hypocotyl elongation at concentrations close to the K i in vitro. NDGA was only marginally active, and the other inhibitors were ineffective in vivo. This may have been perhaps because of their metabolism in plants or because of other unknown side effects.

!~MM~! The different members of the patatin-related PLAs in Arabidopsis were designated by their chromosome number and, if necessary, by additional letters. For isolation of the full-length cDNAs of the PLA genes IIA, IVA, and IVC, we used the gene-specific primers:AtPLA IIA sense (5′-TGC ATG AGG TGA ACG AAT GTC TCG-3′) and antisense (5′-TGG TTG ATT TCC ATC TCT CTG CCG-3′);AtPLA IVA sense (5′-TTA TGG AGA ACA AAT CGC CCT CC-3′) and antisense (5′-AAC GGC ACA ATG TCT TTA GCC G-3′); andAtPLA IVC sense (5′-GAT GTG TTG GGT CTT TGA AAG TGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TTT ACC GTT GAA CTT GGG TCC-3′). The primers were designed for the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the respective genes and were used for 35 cycles PCR (each cycle: 94°C for 30s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s) to amplify the specific cDNA fragment from an Arabidopsis lambda cDNA library (Uni-ZAP XR Library, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). By stepwise dilution of positive library fractions as described by CITATION, the full-length cDNA phage clones from AtPLA IIA, IVA, and IVC were isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids were prepared and the cDNA-insertions were sequenced. The full-length cDNA fromAtPLA I with a length of 4.1 kb could not be identified in the lambda cDNA-library Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene). Total RNA was prepared from 28-d-old Arabidopsis plants by the RNA-purification kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Three micrograms of RNA was used for first-strand cDNA-synthesis using oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One hundred nanograms of cDNA was taken for RT-PCR using the primers, sense (5′-GAT CTG AAC GAC GAT CCG ATT C-3′) and antisense (5′-GCA GAA ACG AAC AAA ACT TCG-3′) to amplify the full-length cDNA of the gene AtPLA I. PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 120 s. The amplified cDNA was cloned via adenosine-overhangs produced by theTaq-DNA-polymerase (AGS-Gold, AGS) into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Total RNAs were prepared from roots, shoots, leaves, and flowers and treated with DNase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The RNAs were subsequently examined with respect to contaminating DNA using PCR. For this purpose, the RNA preparations were used for amplification reactions with each gene-specific PLA primer pair for 40 cycles and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Initiated by an oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen), first-strand cDNA was synthesized from each 3 μg of total RNA to quantify PLA mRNAs. The cDNAs were amplified with gene-specific primer pairs each derived from different exons and comprising at least one intron sequence in the corresponding genomic DNA-sequence AtPLA I: sense, 5′-ATA TTG GAC GCC AGA CCC TA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGT TTT CTC GTG GTC GCT ATC-3′; AtPLA IIA: sense, 5′-CGT CCT TGA GAG GAT GGT TT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGG ATG GAG AAG AAG CAA GG-3′;AtPLA IVA: sense, 5′-TTC GAC CGG TTT CTC GTT AT-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCG TCC GAG AGA ATT TTT GC-3′; and AtPLA IVC: sense, 5′-GGA CCC AAG TTC AAC GGT AA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAC CCT TCA ACG AAT CAT CA-3′. A total of either 33 cycles (AtPLA I) or 35 cycles (AtPLA IIA andAtPLA IVA) were chosen, because then amplification was in the logarithmic range when 100 ng cDNA were used. A total of 100 ng of purified first strand cDNAs was used for subsequent amplification reactions. Conditions for amplification were 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 45 s. The RT-PCR products were 414 bp (AtPLA I), 390 bp (AtPLA IIA), and 432 bp (AtPLA IVA) in length, and their identities were verified by sequencing. Competitor DNA as an internal standard was obtained by the addition of 25 fg (AtPLA I), 1.5 fg (AtPLA IIA), and 4 fg (AtPLA IVA) of the appropriate cloned genomic DNA fragment harboring an intron, which led to the respective larger amplification products (competitor-AtPLA I = 752 bp; competitor-AtPLA IIA = 475 bp; competitor-AtPLA IVA = 650 bp). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoretic separation on agarose gels and quantified by using the program “scan pack” (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The relative amounts of cDNAs were calculated by the formula [amount competitor DNA] × [gray scale value of cDNA]/[gray scale value of competitor DNA], setting the highest value to 100%. Because the gene-specific primer pair for AtPLA IVC resulted in amplification of two splicing-variants, a competitive RT-PCR described above was not possible. To normalize RT-PCR amplification, control reactions were run with the primers sense, 5′-AGG ATA TTC AGC CAC TTG TCT GTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGA AAC ATT TCC TGT GAA CAA TCG-3′, derived from consensus sequence of the Arabidopsis actin genes Act 2 and Act 7 (CITATION). The amounts of first strand cDNA were 100 ng for AtPLA IVC transcript amplification and 20 ng for actin transcript amplification. PCR was performed through 25 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90 s for actin gene fragments. The open reading frame of GFP from psmGFP (CITATION) was amplified in a PCR-reaction for 30 cycles (each cycle: 94°C for 15 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s) using the sense primer (5′-GCT CTA GAG TCG ACA TGA GTA AAG GAG AAG AAC-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-GCG AGC TCG AGC TCT TAT TTG TAT AGT TCA T-3′) to introduce a XbaI and SalI recognition site at the N terminus of the open reading frame of the GFP. The amplified PCR product was digested with SacI andXbaI and was ligated into the vector pBI221. The open reading frames of the PLA cDNAs of genes AtPLA I, IIA, IVA, and IVC were amplified by PCR using the sense primers for IA (5′-GCT CTA GAA TGT CTT CTA CAT GTT CTT C-3′), for IIA (5′-AGC TCT AGA ATG CAA ATG GAC AGC CCC-3′), for IVA (5′-AGC TCT AGA ATG GAG AAC AAA TCG CC-3′), and for IVC (5′-AGC TCT AGA ATG GAT ACA GAG AGA-3′) containing a XbaI-recognition site and the antisense primers for I (5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA CAC TAG GAA GAT GAC AAG-3′), for IIA (5′-ACG CGT CGA CGA TCC TAA TTG GAG CTT TTG-3′), for IVA (5′-ACG CGT CGA CCT CTT GTG ATT CAT TTG ATG-3′), and for IVC (5′-ACG CGT CGA CAT TAT TAA ACC TTT TGA GAG-3′) containing a SalI recognition site. After digestion of the modified pBI221 and the PLA amplification products by XbaI and SalI, the open reading frames of PLA I, IIA, IVA, and IVC were fused into the pBI221 to the N terminus of the GFP. Plasmid preparations of PLA-psmGFP were done as described in the protocol “Plasmid Mini Preparation” (Qiagen) but without using the purification step by columns and then dissolved in sterile deionized water. One microgram of plasmid (each PLA isoform) was bound to wolfram particles (M17, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in the presence of 30 μm CaNO3. PLA-psmGFP-wolfram particles were shot by using a particle gun (PDS100, Bio-Rad) into leaves fromNicotiana benthamiana being 3 to 4 cm in diameter. The transformed leaves were incubated in petri dishes for 72 h in the dark to express the PLA-GFP-fusion proteins and were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy (TCS 4D, Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany). For each construct, three independent repeats were done. The full-length cDNA from AtPLA IVA was amplified by using the sense 5′-CGG GAT CCG AGA ACA AAT CGC CCT CC-3′ containing a BamHI restriction site and the antisense primer 5′-ATT CTG CAG TTA TTT TAT CTC TTG TG-3′ containing a PstI restriction site. The PCR product was digested by BamHI and PstI, purified by column (Cycle pure, PEQLAB, Erlangen, Germany), and then cloned into BamHI- andPstI-digested pQE30 plasmid, a his-tagged expression vector (Qiagen). Escherichia coli strain XL 1Blue was used as the host for the transformation. The his-tag was fused to the N terminus of the PLA. E. coli cells with the pQE30-AtPLA IVA plasmid were grown to OD600 = 0.5 in 250 mL of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 100 μg mL−1 ampicillin and 25 μg mL−1 tetracycline. IPTG was added to 0.5 mm to induce expression of recombinant proteins, and the culture was continued at 30°C for 30 min. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were frozen at −20°C overnight or in liquid nitrogen. The recombinant protein purification method was slightly modified from that of the QIAexpressionist manual (Qiagen). The bacterial cells were resuspended in 10 mL of ice cold 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-80, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mg mL−1 lysozyme, and digested with 10 μg mL−1 DNase I for 1 h on ice. The cells were ruptured by a French press (three cycles, 1,000 psi). After centrifugation for 12 min at 4°C (10,000g), the supernatant was incubated on ice with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) for 20 min under shaking and washed twice with buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole) by centrifugation. The recombinant protein was eluted by 50 mmNaH2PO4 pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Expression of the transformed E. coli strains as well as purity, M r, and quantitative amounts of recombinant PLA proteins were analyzed by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE according to CITATION. Protein amounts were determined by the method of CITATION. Liposomes were prepared by drying a mix of 186.7 μg of soy PC (Sigma P3644) and 13.3 μg of fluorescence-labeled phospholipid [bis-BODIPY-PC and 2-(4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoyl)- 1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in 100 μL of chloroform under a stream of nitrogen, followed by resuspension in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate at a concentration of 1 μg μL−1 and sonication for 5 min to achieve a clear suspension. For routine enzymatic tests, recombinant protein (0.5 μg in 6 μL) was incubated with 3 μL of liposomes in a total volume of 100 μL of MES-KOH, pH 6.8, and 1 mm CaCl2 at 33°C for 30 min. The pH dependence was determined by testing at different pH values of 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, and 7.24 in 50 mm MES buffer; at pH values of 7.3, 7.41, and 7.8 in 25 mm HEPES buffer; and at pH 8.0 and 9.0 in 50 mm Tris buffer. PLA2 inhibitors AACOCF3, NDGA, HELSS, ETYA, and PACOCF3 were added from stock solutions adjusting the solvent concentration to 0.25% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Reactions were stopped by a slightly modified protocol of CITATION by extraction with 2 volumes of the stopping solution (methanol:chloroform = 2:1, v/v), 1 volume 0.1m KCl was added subsequently, and then incubation at −20°C for 20 min followed. After centrifugation for 30 s at 10,000g, the organic phase was evaporated by a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 10 μL chloroform for thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a solvent of chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v). Plates were dried and scanned optically by a video camera under UV light for computer-assisted quantification. All assays were repeated at least three times. Sterile Arabidopsis seeds were stratified in the dark in deionized water at 4°C for 2 d. After transfer into 2 mL of one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium, seeds were pretreated with light at 24°C and then grown for 48 h under gentle shaking (80 rpm). The PLA2 inhibitors (AACOCF3, NDGA, and HELSS), ETYA, and PACOCF3 were dissolved in ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide. The solvent concentration was adjusted in all samples to 0.25%, and after additional growth for 18 h at 24°C, the length of the hypocotyls were measured from video photographs by using the program dhs-Bild-Datenverarbeitungsprogramm (Leica).
