!~ABS~! Cullins are central scaffolding subunits in eukaryotic E3 ligases that facilitate the ubiquitination of target proteins. Arabidopsis contains at least 11 cullin proteins but only a few of them have been assigned biological roles. In this work Arabidopsis cullin 4 is shown to assemble with DDB1, RBX1, DET1 and DDB2 in vitro and in planta. In addition, by using T-DNA insertion and CUL4 antisense lines we demonstrate that corresponding mutants are severely affected in different aspects of development. Reduced CUL4 expression leads to a reduced number of lateral roots, and to abnormal vascular tissue and stomatal development. Furthermore, cul4 mutants display a weak constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype. These results therefore assign an important function to CUL4 during plant development and provide strong evidence that CUL4 assembles together with RBX1 and DDB1 proteins to form a functional E3 ligase in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! Arabidopsis cullin 4 is a protein of 793 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 91.5 kDa. CUL4 contains a conserved cullin or CH-domain from amino acids 466–615 (http://elm.eu.org/; CITATION; Figure 1a). The protein has an extended N-terminal region of around 65 amino acids that is unique to this particular cullin in Arabidopsis (Figure 1b). The most related sequences in non-photosynthetic organisms are the human cullins 4a and 4b (CITATION). AtCUL4 in fact appears to be more homologous to human hCUL4a than to its closest Arabidopsis family members AtCUL3a and AtCUL3b (Figure 1c). [[FIGURE]] Based on the work of CITATION and CITATION we investigated whether Arabidopsis CUL4 assembles with DDB1. The Arabidopsis genome encodes two highly related DDB1 proteins, DDB1a (At4g05420) and DDB1b (At4g21100), which are >90% identical to each other (CITATION). Yeast two-hybrid studies showed that the full-length CUL4 protein could interact with DDB1a and that this interaction is specific, in as much as no assembly was seen with CUL3a (Figure 2a,b). [[FIGURE]] To map the domains required for CUL4–DDB1a interaction, different Y2H expression constructs for partial CUL4 and DDB1a proteins were generated (Figure 2a,b). As shown in Figure 2(a) the first 453 amino acids of CUL4 were sufficient to allow CUL4–DDB1a assembly. By contrast, deletion of the first 304 amino acids of the cullin (CUL4304−793) completely abolished interaction with DDB1a. This loss of interaction was not based on protein misexpression since RBX1 was still able to assemble with the C-terminal of the partial CUL4 protein (Figure 2a). These findings demonstrate that the N-terminal portion of CUL4 is required for association with DDB1a and that the conserved cullin domain is not required for this interaction. To determine the domains of DDB1a required for interaction with CUL4, several truncated versions of DDB1a were generated. Deletion of the first 298 amino acids (DDB1a299−1089) did not affect interaction with CUL4 and a DDB1a protein fragment containing only amino acids 300–666 (DDB1a300−666) was sufficient for interaction with full-length CUL4 (Figure 2b). Interaction between CUL4 and DDB1a was further confirmed by in vitro pulldown assays. In these experiments, the fusion proteins glutathionine-S-transferase (GST):CUL41−453 and GST:DDB1a300−666 were incubated with in vitro translated and l-[35S]-methionine-labeled CUL41−453, DDB1a300−666, or full-length DDB1a. As shown in Figure 2(c) and (d), full-length and partial DDB1a proteins co-precipitated with GST:CUL41−453. Interestingly, the partial proteins of GST:DDB1a300−666 and in vitro translated CUL41−453 were sufficient to permit interaction between the proteins (Figure 2e). To investigate whether DDB1b can also interact with CUL4, a DDB1b fragment stretching from amino acids 300–694 (DDB1b300−694) was cloned and used for a pulldown assay since this region was sufficient for DDB1a–CUL4 association. As shown in Figure 2(f), GST:DDB1b300−694 did interact with a in vitro translated full-length CUL4. This result provides evidence that both DDB1 proteins can be in a complex with the cullin in planta. The GST:DDB1a300−666 fusion protein was also used to successfully pull down CUL4 from plant extracts (Figure 2g). Detection of precipitated CUL4 was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against a CUL4-specific N-terminal peptide. To investigate the interaction of DDB1a–CUL4 with in planta expressed DDB1a we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that expressed DDB1a under the control of a 35S promoter (here referred to as 35S::myc-DDB1a; Figure 2h). The 35S::myc-DDB1a plants grew like wild-type plants, indicating that ectopic expression of DDB1a has no major impact on Arabidopsis development (data not shown). Using GST:CUL41−453 as bait, myc-tagged DDB1a was successfully pulled down from plant extracts (Figure 2i). Collectively, these results are in agreement with the findings from CITATION showing interaction between CUL4 and DDB1 in mammalian cells, and demonstrate that in Arabidopsis the N-terminal region of CUL4 interacts with the central domain of DDB1a. It has been shown that Arabidopsis DDB1a directly interacts with DET1 (CITATION). It was therefore of interest to test whether DET1 can also associate with CUL4. Using Arabidopsis DET1 as prey and either DDB1a or CUL4 as bait in Y2H assays we could detect interaction of DET1 with DDB1a but not with CUL4 (Figure 3a). Additionally, we tested DDB1a300−666 for interaction with DET1 because this partial DDB1a protein was sufficient to interact with CUL4. However, DET1 did not interact with DDB1a300−666, indicating that DET1 and CUL4 interact with different regions of DDB1a (Figure 3a). The Arabidopsis genome encodes for one protein, At5g58760/DDB2, which is 22.8% identical and 40.4% similar to human hDDB2. Since hDDB2 is one of the first described hDDB1-interacting proteins, it was of interest whether the Arabidopsis ortholog can also interact with DDB1a. As shown in Figure 3(b), DDB2 indeed interacted with DDB1a but not with CUL4, indicating that DDB1a undergoes comparable complex associations as described for its human counterpart. [[FIGURE]] To investigate whether CUL4 and DET1 are present in the same complex in planta we first tried to express myc-tagged Arabidopsis DET1 under the control of a 35S promoter. However, we were not able to generate transgenic plants reproducibly expressing myc-DET1, most likely because of silencing problems (data not shown). To overcome this problem we used the DET1 gene from tomato (tDET1), which is 81.3% identical at the amino acid level to Arabidopsis DET1 (CITATION). In this case stable Arabidopsis lines were established that expressed tDET1 fused to a myc epitope under the control of a 35S promoter (35S::myc-tDET1; Figure 3b). These plants did not display any obvious phenotypes (data not shown). Because interaction of DET1 and DDB1a has already been demonstrated in planta (CITATION), we focused on whether CUL4 and RBX1 can associate with DET1 in plant extracts. For this approach a GST:CUL41−453 fusion protein was used that contains the DDB1a-interacting part of CUL4 as well as a full-length GST:RBX1 fusion protein. As shown in Figure 3(c) both GST fusion proteins could co-precipitate myc-tDET1 from Arabidopsis extracts, whereas the GST control alone could not. In addition, in planta association of CUL4 with myc-tDET1 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (IP) of CUL4 and the co-IP of myc-tDET1 (Figure 3d). In summary, these results demonstrate that CUL4 associates with DET1 in planta and that assembly of the two proteins is likely to be bridged by DDB1a. To determine CUL4 expression patterns in Arabidopsis, total RNA was isolated from flowers, stems, rosette leaves and roots for Northern blot analysis. Hybridization with a CUL4-specific probe showed that the mRNA was present in all tissues examined (Figure 4a). In addition, CUL4 mRNA showed a slight light–dark regulation of expression. For this approach, RNA was isolated from leaves of 3-week-old plants cultured in a 12-h day:night cycle. Samples were taken every 4 h over one 24-h cycle. Hybridization with a CUL4-specific probe revealed a slight upregulation of CUL4 expression within the first 4 h of the night cycle (Figure 4c). For more detailed information on tissue-specific expression patterns, a 1.64 kb promoter was cloned in front of a GUS reporter gene (pCUL4::GUS) and used for plant transformation. Analysis of transgenic pCUL4::GUS plants showed GUS expression mainly in young leaves and in the central and major veins of the vascular tissue (Figure 4c,d). In roots, expression was only detectable in the older parts of the primary and lateral roots (Figure 4e,f). We could never detect any staining in emerging lateral root buds. Finally, in flowers a strong expression was detectable mainly in pollen which was confirmed by in situ hybridization (Figure 4g–i). [[FIGURE]] To gain information about the function of CUL4 during plant development, two T-DNA insertion lines from the SALK collection (SALK_077684 and SALK_084869) and one insertion line from GABI-Kat (600H03) were obtained and analyzed for effects on CUL4 expression levels (CITATION; CITATION). Analyses of the SALK lines showed that CUL4 expression was either not affected by the T-DNA insertion (SALK_077684; T-DNA insertion is located around 150 bp upstream of the ATG) or that we could not detect the presence of the T-DNA within the CUL4 gene (SALK_084869; data not shown). However, the T-DNA insertion in the GABI-Kat line was confirmed by PCR (data not shown), and selfing of plants heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion showed a 3:1 segregation pattern on sulfadiazine-containing medium with 823 resistant plants and 292 sensitive ones. This segregation pattern indicated the presence of just one T-DNA insertion in this line. The insertion was found to be located within the 12th intron, and analysis of homozygous lines (denoted cul4-1) by Northern blotting and RT-PCR revealed reduced levels of CUL4 mRNA (Figure 5a,c). [[FIGURE]] Additional cul4 knockdown mutants were generated using a CUL4 antisense construct (denoted ascul4). Specifically, the first 623 bp of CUL4 after the ATG were used because this region is highly specific to CUL4 and so should allow its targeted reduction without affecting expression of the other cullins (Figure 5b). Two hundred transgenic plants were generated, of which around 20% showed a strongly reduced growth. Of these, two representative lines, named ascul4-100 and ascul4-102, were chosen for further detailed analysis. As confirmed in Figure 5d, CUL4 expression was clearly downregulated in these plants whereas CUL1 and CUL3b expression were not affected. Analysis of DDB1a, COP1 and DET1 expression also did not reveal any major changes in the ascul4-100 and -102 backgrounds (Figure 5e). Furthermore, the strength of the ascul4 phenotypes strictly correlated with the level of CUL4 reduction, demonstrating the specificity and efficiency of the antisense approach (Figure 6a). [[FIGURE]] The results from expression analyses suggested that CUL4 might participate in different events during development. Indeed, phenotypic analysis of ascul4 and cul4-1 plants showed that they regularly developed misshapen cotyledons (data not shown) and leaves (Figure 6b). With respect to wild-type leaves, two main differences were observed: first, the central vein was often split into single independent vascular strands running next to each other, and second, the leaves often developed isolated vascular strands (Figure 6c). In addition, differentiated leaves of ascul4 lines also showed abnormal stomatal development with a high frequency of stomata touching each other (Figure 6d). It is noteworthy that in the cul4-1 mutants the aberrant leaf development phenotypes were only observed in cotyledons and first leaves, and with increasing age they grew comparably with wild-type Col0 plants (Figure 7a). This strongly contrasted with ascul4-100 and ascul4-102 plants, which remained dwarf-like throughout the life of the plant (Figure 7a). In addition, at the onset of bolting the two ascul4 lines also had fewer rosette leaves in comparison with wild-type plants (Figure 7b) and this was not observed in cul4-1 mutant plants (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To understand better these phenotypic differences between CUL4 antisense and T-DNA insertion mutants, CUL4 protein levels were examined at seedling and rosette stages. At the seedling stage both mutant lines showed strongly reduced CUL4 protein levels (Figure 7c), but at the rosette stage cul4-1 plants clearly expressed the protein whereas it was barely detectable in the ascul4 plants (Figure 7c). Consequently, the observed phenotypical dissimilarities between cul4-1 and ascul4 are most probably due to different the CUL4 content during different stages of development in the mutants. Besides the aberrant leaf growth, all cul4 mutants showed subtle changes in root development. Although primary root growth was unaffected, the number of lateral roots was clearly reduced (Figure 7d). Here, ascul4 lines and cul4-1 developed fewer lateral roots and these were shorter in comparison with the roots of wild-type plants (Figure 7d). In addition, the first lateral roots appeared at a greater distance from the hypocotyl in comparison with what is found in wild-type plants. One cause of aberrant root development could be related to changed sensitivities towards the phytohormone auxin. However, the roots of ascul4 mutants showed normal responses towards the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) in root elongation assays (data not shown). Because CUL4 associates with DET1, we speculated that cul4 mutants might display defects in photomorphogenesis, as has been described for cop1 and det1 mutants (CITATION; CITATION). To identify defects in the photomorphogenic response, cul4-1 and ascul4-102 seedlings were cultured for 6 days in complete darkness before examining changes in the apical hook, hypocotyl length and cotyledon development. We could not detect any major changes in the formation of the apical hook. However, both ascul4-102 and cul4-1 seedlings had a tendency to develop slightly shorter hypocotyls in comparison with Col0 plants (Figure 7e). Furthermore, both cul4 mutant lines showed a high frequency of seedlings with open cotyledons, which occurred more often in the antisense lines (around 78%) in comparison with the cul4-1 mutant background (around 55%; Figure 7e). These findings suggest that CUL4 participates in some aspects of photomorphogenesis, such as cotyledon opening, but given the strong reduction in CUL4 protein content it appears probable that the cullin is not a major regulator of this developmental process.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants Columbia 0 ecotype (Col-0) were grown on soil in a greenhouse and growth chamber at 20°C under long day conditions (16 h light:8 h dark). For investigation of CUL4 light–dark-dependent expression, plants were cultured in growth chambers for 21 days in a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod. Photomorphogenic phenotype analyses were done in sterile culture with 6-day-old seedlings grown at 20°C on minimal medium in complete darkness after 2 days of vernalization at 4°C and 6 h of light exposure. The CUL4 promoter (1614 bp) was amplified from genomic Col-0 DNA with specific primers (PCUL4FW tattagtaagtttaagcgagg; PCUL4RW SpeI actagtgaaaatgggtgaaaattgtgt) and subcloned into pCR2.1 using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) before subcloning into the SpeI site of the mini binary vector pCB308 (CITATION). Correct orientation of the promoter in front of the GUS cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. CUL4, DDB1a and DET1 cDNAs were cloned with specific primers (CUL4attB1 aaaaagcaggctatatgtctct tcctaccaaacgctctactttc; CUL4attB2 agaaagctgggtctaagcaagataattgtatatctgagggt; DDB1attb1 aaaaagcaggctatatgagctcatggaac; DDB1attb2 agaaagctgggttcagtgaagcctagtg; DET1attb1 aaaaagcaggctatatgttcacaagcggtaacgtc; DET1attb2 agaaagctgggttcatcgcctaaaatggatattg; DDB1b900attb1 aaaaagcaggctactctattgcatcttcc; DDB1b2082attb2 agaaagctgggttgtaagttcgccctccc; DDB2attb1 aaaaagcaggctatatggcgacggagtacgagcg; DDB2attb2 agaaagctgggtctactttgttgtccaaacatagac) from a cDNA library (CITATION) or mRNA using Pfu-polymerase or an RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), respectively. Full-length and partial products were directly shuffled in one-tube Gateway BP/LR-reactions (Invitrogen) into Gateway-compatible binary, yeast and Escherichia coli expression vectors pGWB18, pBTM116-D9, pACT2 and pDEST15 (Invitrogen), respectively. The CUL4 antisense construct was generated by amplifying a partial 623 bp CUL4 cDNA (CUL4FW atgtctcttcctaccaaacgctctactttc; CUL4RW623 gatgcttccggaaaagctgc) which was first subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently into BamHI/XbaI sites of the mini binary vector pCB302-3 (CITATION). All fragments were fully sequenced. Binary vectors were introduced by electroporation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, and were subsequently used for plant transformation according to CITATION. A lexA-based Y2H system was used as described in CITATION with pBTM116-D9 (kindly provided by Dr Erich Wanker) as the bait plasmid and pACT2 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA; GenBank accession no. U29899) as the prey plasmid. Both vectors were modified to introduce a Gateway cassette (Invitrogen). Complementary DNAs of the different genes (CUL3a, CUL4, RBX1 and DDB1a) were cloned into pDONR221 (Invitrogen) and subsequently introduced into pBTM116-D9 and pACT2. For Y2H assays, yeast cells were transformed with bait and prey plasmid constructs as described previously (CITATION). Cells were grown on synthetic dextrose (SD) minimal medium (CITATION) supplemented with leucine and histidine (SDII). Selected colonies were diluted 1:2000 in autoclaved distilled water before transfer to SD minimal medium without supplements (SDIV) as a control for interaction studies. All constructs were controlled for autoactivation before being used for interaction assays. Photographs of single drops from diluted colonies were taken 3 days after transfer. In vitro translated CUL4, DDB1a and DDB1a300−666 were synthesized with the TNT-reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) using l-[35S] trans-labeled methionine (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany). For pulldown assays from reticulocyte lysate CUL4, DDB1a and DDB1a300−666 were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with GST, GST:DDB1a300−666 and GST:CUL41−453, respectively. Binding assays and washings were done in standard buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% NP-40). Six-day-old seedlings germinated on minimal American Trudeau Society (ATS) medium were used for pulldown assays from plant extracts. Pulldown assays with GST and GST:DDB1a300−666 and washings were done as described before (CITATION) using a modified standard buffer [100 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5; 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 μm MG132 (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany)]. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Products were detected by autoradiography. Western blot and immunodetection were done as described before (CITATION). Antibodies used were anti-myc (Upstate, Dundee, UK; no. 05-724), polyclonal raised in rabbit against the N-terminal peptide of CUL4 (SFDLESLYQAVDNLC) and secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). For RT-PCR, total RNA extraction and DNase I digestion were done using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Macherey-Nagel, Freiburg, Germany). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was done using a one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Ninety nanograms of total RNA was used for each RT-PCR reaction (25 cycles, 61°C annealing temperature, 1 min elongation time) with gene-specific primers (CUL4ATG atgtctcttcctaccaaacgctctactttc, CUL4RW650 aacttcaggggccagagaaag, actin2FW tacaacgagcttcgtgttgc, actin2RW gattgatcctccgatccaga). Reactions were done according to the Qiagen manual with 25 cycles and 60°C annealing temperatures. For expression analysis in seedlings, flower, shoot, leaf and root total RNA was harvested from 4-week-old soil-grown plants. Northern blot analysis and radioactive hybridization were done using standard techniques as described before (CITATION). Flower tissue from 4-week-old soil grown plants was fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde and used for embedding in paraffin. Sectioning and in situ hybridization were done according to CITATION. A 650 base pair fragment from the 5′-end of CUL4 was used as a template for RNA synthesis. Labeling of sense and antisense RNA was done with a DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For detection of GUS expression, different tissues were incubated for up to 24 h in GUS-staining solution according to CITATION. Tissue was destained overnight in 100% ethanol. Pictures were taken with an Olympus Digital camera C-4040Zoom mounted on a stereo microscope SZX12 (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) or an Axioskop 2 plus microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
