!~ABS~! Leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing transmembrane receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are important components of plant signal transduction. The Arabidopsis thaliana somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase 1 (AtSERK1) is an LRR-RLK proposed to participate in a signal transduction cascade involved in embryo development. By yeast two-hybrid screening we identified AtCDC48, a homologue of the mammalian AAA-ATPase p97 and GF14λ, a member of the Arabidopsis family of 14-3-3 proteins as AtSERK1 interactors. In vitro, the AtSERK1 kinase domain is able to transphosphorylate and bind both AtCDC48 and GF14λ. In yeast, AtCDC48 interacts with GF14λ and with the PP2C phosphatase KAPP. In plant protoplasts AtSERK1 interacts with GF14λ.
!~RES~! To identify proteins that physically interact with AtSERK1 (Hecht et al. CITATION), a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library from Arabidopsis young silique tissue (Grebe et al. CITATION) was screened with the kinase domain of AtSERK1 (a.a. 266–625, AtSERK1kinase). Two clones were found to contain the coding sequence for the C-terminal 62 and 65 residues of the AtCDC48A protein (At3g09840). AtCDC48A is a protein of 809 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 89 kDa and of the three AtCDC48 isoforms the most abundant one (Rancour et al. CITATION). We used ESTs encoding the C-terminal 260 (AtCDC48549-809) and 423 (AtCDC48386-809) residues of AtCDC48 to confirm the interaction with AtSERK1. All AtCDC48 peptides interacted with the kinase domain of AtSERK1 and not with AtSERK1LRR or the human Lamin C protein used as negative controls (data not shown). Three identical clones were found to contain the complete coding sequence of GF14λ, a member of the Arabidopsis family of 14-3-3 proteins, while a fourth clone lacks the N-terminal 38 residues and was designated GF14λ39-248. Control experiments in yeast showed that GF14λ interacts with AtSERK1kinase but not with AtSERK1LRR nor with the Lamin C protein (data not shown). We could not perform the reciprocal interaction experiment, because GF14λ auto-activates reporter gene expression when fused to LexA. This was also observed for other 14-3-3 proteins and is probably due to the acidic nature of 14-3-3 proteins (Wu et al. CITATION; Wang et al. CITATION). Because GF14λ activates the reporter genes in an AtSERK1kinase-dependent way when fused to the DNA-binding domain we conclude that AtSERK1 does interact with GF14λ in yeast. To confirm the existence of a direct interaction between AtSERK1 and the proteins AtCDC48 and GF14λ, we expressed the AtSERK1 kinase domain (AtSERK1kinase) as C-terminal fusion protein with GST in Escherichia coli followed by affinity purification on glutathione resin. Because GST is known to form homodimers by itself, we expressed and affinity-purified the C-terminal MBP fusion proteins MBP-AtCDC48747-809 and MBP-AtCDC48386-809. GF14λ and GF14λ38-249 were expressed as GST-fusion proteins but had their GST-tag removed after purification. GST-AtSERK1kinase was added to amylose resin with immobilised AtCDC48 and tested for its ability to bind to AtCDC48. Binding assays were performed using phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated AtSERK1kinase. Bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the αGST-AtSERK1kinase antiserum (Fig. 1). GST-AtSERK1kinase was phosphorylated by incubating the protein with ATP at phosphorylating conditions. Autophosphorylation activity of the AtSERK1 kinase domain was verified by incubating the GST-AtSERK1kinase protein in the presence of [γ−32P]ATP. Figure 1 shows that MBP-AtCDC48747-809 does not interact with non-phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 1, lane 2) or with GST (Fig. 1, lane 1). Upon phosphorylation of AtSERK1, MBP-AtCDC48747-809 and GST-AtSERK1kinase do interact (Fig. 1, lane 3). MBP-AtCDC48386-809 interacts both with non-phosphorylated (Fig. 1, lane 6) and phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 1, lane 7) and not with GST (Fig. 1, lane 5). Upon phosphorylation of AtSERK1kinase there was an increase in interaction with AtCDC48386-809. Lane 4 contains GST-AtSERK1kinase and free GST. From these results, we conclude that MBP-AtCDC48386-809 and AtCDC48747-809 bind to the kinase domain of AtSERK1. Although phosphorylation of AtSERK1 enhances the interaction, it is not clear whether the interaction of AtSERK1 with the C-terminal amino acids of AtCDC48 is phosphorylation dependent. [[FIGURE]]  The results of the protein binding assay employing immobilised GST-AtSERK1kinase and GF14λ are shown in Fig. 2. GF14λ interacts with GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 2, lane 1), but not with GST alone (Fig. 2, lane 5). Phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase protein binds more GF14λ (Fig. 2, lane 2) than non-phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 2, lane 1). Through comparison of the band intensities on the Western blot, we estimated that interaction of GF14λ with phosphorylated AtSERK1 is about fivefold higher compared to non-phosphorylated AtSERK1. [[FIGURE]]  The same experiments were repeated for GF14λ39-248. Interaction between non-phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase and either GF14λ or GF14λ39-248 is observed with equal intensities (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3). When the binding assay is performed using phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 2, lane 4) no difference was observed in the ability to bind GF14λ39-248 compared to non-phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 2, lane 3). Due to the gel system we used, we did not see the expected difference of 4 kDa in molecular size between GF14λ and GF14λ39-248. From these results, we conclude that there is a phosphorylation-independent interaction between GF14λ and the AtSERK1 kinase domain as well as a phosphorylation-dependent interaction. This phosphorylation-dependent interaction requires the first 38 amino acids of the GF14λ protein. AtSERK1kinase is able to transphosphorylate proteins in vitro (Shah et al. CITATION). Therefore, phosphorylation assays were performed to further substantiate the interaction between AtSERK1 and AtCDC48. AtCDC48747-809 was expressed as fusion protein with MBP but due to the size of MBP (42.5 kDa) also as fusion proteins with GST (25 kDa). To allow AtSERK1 to transphosphorylate AtCDC48, both the MBP- and GST-derived fusion proteins were incubated with GST-AtSERK1kinase in the presence of [γ−32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding protein sample buffer and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. The phospho-images in Fig. 3 show that AtSERK1 is able to transphosphorylate MBP- and GST-AtCDC48747-809 (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 3). AtSERK1kinase does not transphosphorylate GST nor MBP (not shown) and AtCDC48 is not phosphorylated in the absence of AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 3b, lane 2). AtSERK1 autophosphorylation is stronger than transphosphorylation on AtCDC48. One explanation for this is the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites in the AtSERK1kinase protein (Shah et al. CITATION) in comparison to only one (or two) phosphorylation site(s) in AtCDC48747-809 (next section). [[FIGURE]]  In yeast, phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the C-terminal DDDLYS sequence of ScCdc48 was shown to regulate cell-cycle-dependent shuttling of the protein between nucleus and cytoplasm due to exposure of the N-terminal nuclear localisation signals (Madeo et al. CITATION). Therefore, we determined which residue(s) in AtCDC48 is phosphorylated by AtSERK1 using α(p)Thr, α(p)Ser and α(p)Tyr antibodies. α(p)Thr antibodies recognised the GST-AtCDC48747-809 peptide after phosphorylation by GST-AtSERK1kinase (Fig. 3c) while α(p)Ser (Fig. 3d) and α(p)Tyr (Fig. 3e) antibodies did not. According to the prediction of phosphorylation sites by NetPhos 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) there are two putative threonine phosphorylation sites within the C-terminal 62 amino acids of AtCDC48. One of these sites is conserved amongst the Arabidopsis AtCDC48 family (Thr796 of AtCDC48A) but not in yeast. Although AtSERK1 is able to phosphorylate on tyrosine residues of the common substrate myelin basic protein (Shah et al. CITATION), it clearly does not phosphorylate the tyrosine residue in the C-terminal DDDDLYN sequence of AtCDC48 (Fig. 3e). Therefore, we conclude that AtSERK1 phosphorylates AtCDC48 on at least one threonine residue within the C-terminal 62 amino acids, which may have a comparable function as phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at the C-terminus resulting in cellular translocation of the AtCDC48 protein. It has been reported that some protein kinases can use a 14-3-3 protein as substrate (Lu et al. CITATION; van der Hoeven et al. CITATION). Therefore, in order to further substantiate the interaction between AtSERK1 and GF14λ, we determined whether AtSERK1 is also able to transphosphorylate GF14λ. Figure 4 shows that besides autophosphorylation, GST-AtSERK1kinase can transphosphorylate both GF14λ and GF14λ39-248 with comparable intensity; thus phosphorylation is not restricted to the N-terminal 38 residues of GF14λ. The observed GF14λ phosphorylation requires the presence of AtSERK1 as no phosphorylation was observed after incubating GF14λ or GF14λ39-248 with [γ−32P]ATP in the absence of AtSERK1kinase (data not shown). This suggests that GF14λ can be a natural substrate of AtSERK1. [[FIGURE]]  Although the biological significance of all interactions with 14-3-3 proteins that have been detected is not known, it is generally agreed that 14-3-3 proteins have a regulatory function through protein–protein interactions. Therefore, we determined whether binding of GF14λ to the AtSERK1 kinase domain has an effect on phosphorylation. We compared the kinetics of GF14λ phosphorylation by AtSERK1kinase to AtSERK1kinase autophosphorylation (Fig. 4b). In a standard assay with 10 mM MgCl2 and 500 ng AtSERK1kinase autophosphorylation is complete within 30 min (Shah et al. CITATION). Thus, we set the pixel intensity of the AtSERK1kinase autophosphorylation band at 30 min at 100% and compared the intensity of the other bands on the autoradiogram with this band. In the time-interval we used, GF14λ is being transphosphorylated as soon as AtSERK1 is autophosphorylated and AtSERK1 autophosphorylation is not impaired by the presence of phosphorylated GF14λ. We cannot state with certainty whether non-phosphorylated GF14λ does not interfere with AtSERK1 autophosphorylation. However, we consider this to be unlikely due to the comparable autophosphorylation kinetics of AtSERK1 in the presence and absence of partially phosphorylated GF14λ such as present in the reaction mixture after 10 min (data not shown). Like observed for AtCDC48, GF14λ transphosphorylation is lower than AtSERK1kinase autophosphorylation. This could also be due to a lower number of target phosphorylation sites on GF14λ in comparison to AtSERK1. From these results, we conclude that the binding of GF14λ to the kinase domain of AtSERK1 does not affect its phosphorylation activities in vitro. In addition to AtCDC48 and GF14λ, the kinase domain of AtSERK1 can also bind the KAPP (Shah et al. CITATION). The phosphatase KAPP was determined to physically and functionally interact with the AtSERK1 kinase domain, as it is able to dephosphorylate phosphorylated AtSERK1 and actively prevents autophosphorylation of the kinase (Shah et al. CITATION). In addition, yeast two-hybrid interaction tests showed that KAPP binds to AtSERK1 with its kinase interaction domain (KI-KAPP). To determine whether one or more of the AtSERK1 interacting proteins can also interact with each other, we performed a pairwise yeast two-hybrid interaction test using AtSERK1kinase, AtCDC48549-809, GF14λ, KAPP and KI-KAPP cloned in pJG4-5 and pEG202. Unfortunately, not all interactions could be tested due to autoactivation of the reporter genes by KI-KAPP, KAPP and GF14λ when fused to the LexA DNA-binding protein of pEG202. As summarised in Table 1, AtCDC48549-809 appears to interact not only with AtSERK1 but also with itself, with GF14λ and with KAPP. While AtSERK1 interacts with the kinase interaction domain of KAPP, AtCDC48549-809 only interacts with the complete KAPP protein. Yeast CDC48p (Fröhlich et al. CITATION) as well as Arabidopsis CDC48 (Rancour et al. CITATION) homohexadimerise to form a functional complex in vivo. Based on our experiments, we cannot state whether the observed interaction between CDC48 peptides and the AtSERK1 receptor kinase also occurs with the entire hexameric complex.[[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] The GF14λ protein was found to be constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis, although expression can be enhanced with cold treatment (Jarillo et al. CITATION; Zhang et al. CITATION). Therefore, we determined the occurrence of co-localisation and a molecular interaction of GF14λ and AtSERK1 at the cellular level in cowpea mesophyll protoplasts. For this we fused the entire coding region of GF14λ to the C-terminus of CFP and YPF (CFP-GF14λ and YFP-GF14λ). The entire coding region of AtSERK1 was fused to the N-terminus of YFP (AtSERK1-YFP). The fusion proteins were then transiently expressed in cowpea protoplasts. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to image cells expressing the fusion proteins. Figure 5 shows the localisation of fluorescent signals for AtSERK1-YFP (Fig. 5a–c), YFP-GF14λ (Fig. 5d–f) and CFP-GF14λ together with AtSERK1-YFP (Fig. 5g–j). For AtSERK1-YFP, it has previously been shown that a fluorescent signal can be detected at the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent at endomembranes (Shah et al. CITATION). Figure 5a, c confirm the previously noted location of the AtSERK1 protein. For YFP-GF14λ, fluorescence can be detected in the nucleus and the cytosol. Nuclear localisation of YFP-GF14λ was confirmed by co-localisation of YFP-GF14λ fluorescence and DAPI staining (Fig. 5k–m). The 14-3-3 proteins do not contain any obvious cellular localisation signal, although many differences in cellular organisation exist among the 14-3-3 proteins. For example the Arabidopsis GF14κ isoform is found in the nucleus and the plasma membrane region, and GF14υ is found in the cytoplasm and in the chloroplast stroma (Sehnke et al. CITATION). To examine the subcellular localisation of AtSERK1 in the presence of GF14λ, we co-expressed CFP-GF14λ with AtSERK1-YFP in protoplasts. The superimposed image (Fig. 5j) shows co-localisation of the proteins at the plasma membrane. No obvious difference in localisation of either protein is observed upon co-expression. [[FIGURE]]  The occurrence of a molecular interaction between AtSERK1-YFP and CFP-GF14λ was studied by measuring the FRET between the CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) fluorophores. The FRET occurs when the fluorophores interact based on dipole–dipole interaction, which is only possible at close proximity (5 nm for CFP and YFP). In the case of FRET, the CFP fluorescence will be quenched and the YFP fluorescence will be increased, which indicates a molecular interaction of the proteins that are fused to the fluorophores. FRET was measured using FSPIM as a detection method. Spectral images were taken from small regions of protoplasts co-expressing AtSERK1-YFP and CFP-GF14λ at approximately equal expression levels and fluorescence emission spectra were generated. As a control spectral images were taken from protoplasts expressing only CFP-GF14λ. Figure 6 shows the emission spectra of CFP and YFP fluorescence in protoplasts. The peak at 480 nm corresponds to CFP emission and the peak at 520 nm to YFP fluorescence. The ratio of 480 to 520 nm emission intensity acts as an indicator of the extent of FRET. In order to compare the different measurements, the CFP emission peak at 480 nm is normalised to 1. The emission intensity ratios deduced from measurements at several sites in the cell, but not at the plasma membrane, of 35 different protoplasts co-expressing AtSERK1-YFP and CFP-GF14λ is close to 1.2 (Fig. 6a). This is comparable with measurements obtained from ten protoplasts only expressing CFP-GF14λ. The emission intensity ratios obtained from measurements at the plasma membrane of the 35 different protoplasts co-expressing AtSERK1-YFP and CFP-GF14λ showed that there was an increase in YFP fluorescence in 46% of the measurements performed with a maximum of 1.6 (Fig. 6b). The FRET energy transfer efficiency was calculated from the emission intensity ratios between Fig. 6a, b and is roughly 23%. These results show that at the plasma membrane AtSERK1 and GF14λ can interact. [[FIGURE]]  The interaction was confirmed using APB (Wouters and Bastiaens CITATION). APB was performed by bleaching the YFP fluorophore in a defined region. Images of the protoplast were taken before and after the bleaching event. When YFP is inactivated due to bleaching, the CFP fluorescence energy can no longer be transferred to YFP in the case of FRET between CFP-GF14λ and AtSERK1-YFP. This will result in an increase of the 480 nm CFP emission signal and a decrease of the 520 nm YFP emission signal. When we bleached the YFP fluorescence signal at a small portion of the plasma membrane where CFP-GF14λ and AtSERK1-YFP co-localise, an increase in CFP intensity was observed (Fig. 6c). As a control we bleached YFP at a region in the cell where the two proteins do not interact (Fig. 6d). This did not result in an increase of CFP intensity. To compare the changes in fluorescence intensity between Fig. 6c, d, the fluorescent counts were converted to fluorescent percentages. Energy transfer efficiencies can be calculated based on the release of quenching of donor fluorescence due to FRET, measured by comparing the intensity of donor fluorescence before and after complete photobleaching of the acceptor (Bastiaens and Jovin CITATION). For AtSERK1-YFP and CFP-GF14λ the FRET energy transfer efficiency is roughly 20%. However, the fluorescence of AtSERK1-YFP was not completely bleached, therefore the actual energy transfer will be higher. The FRET efficiency using acceptor photobleaching or FSPIM as a detection method is comparable. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between GF14λ and AtSERK1 as observed in yeast can also occur at the plasma membrane of transfected plant cells.
!~MM~! The DuplexA yeast two-hybrid (Origene Technologies Inc.) system was used to screen for proteins interacting with AtSERK1. An Arabidopsis (ecotype Landsberg erecta) cDNA library was prepared as a fusion to the activation domain in vector pJG4-5 (Origene Technologies Inc.) using mRNA from young silique tissue (Grebe et al. CITATION). The primary library contained approximately 2×106 cDNA clones. The nucleotide sequence encoding the kinase domain of AtSERK1 (GenBank accession no. A67827; a.a. 266–625) was cloned into the bait vector pEG202 (Origene Technologies Inc.) to produce a fusion protein with LexA (Shah et al. CITATION). Repression assays indicated that the LexA-AtSERK1kinase protein is transported correctly into the nucleus and autoactivation assays verified that the LexA-AtSERK1kinase protein does not autonomously activate the lacZ or the LEU2 reporter genes. The cDNA library was transformed into yeast strain EGY48 (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3, LexAop(x6)-LEU2) containing pEG202-AtSERK1kinase and the reporter plasmid pSH18-34. Colonies were judged positive when they grew in the absence of leucine at 30°C and showed visible β-galactosidase activity within 3 days. Screening of approximately 30×106 yeast transformants on selection plates containing 80 mg/l Xgal resulted in 200 clones that showed β-galactosidase activity and leucine auxotrophy. After excluding clones with AtSERK1kinase-independent activation or autoactivation of the reporter genes, 12 clones encoding putative AtSERK1 interacting proteins remained. Interacting proteins were identified as GF14λ (accession no. NP_568229), and AtCDC48 (accession no. S60112). Interaction tests were performed with the AtSERK1 kinase domain (a.a. 266–625), the entire mature AtSERK1 protein without the N-terminal signal sequence (AtSERK1ΔSS, a.a. 31–625), the AtSERK1 extracellular domain (AtSERK1LRR ; a.a. 26–234) or the non-related human Lamin C protein in combination with GF14λ, AtCDC48747-809 or longer parts of AtCDC48 encoded by EST cDNA clones 104O24 (accession no. T22005) and 180L9 (accession no. H36923) obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre. Interaction was also tested using AtSERK1 cloned in pJG4-5 as prey, and the EST encoded peptides cloned in pEG202 as bait. The yeast two-hybrid system was also used to determine whether AtCDC48 could interact with the AtSERK1 interacting proteins GF14λ and KAPP. Therefore, pairwise interaction tests were performed using AtSERK1kinase, AtCDC48549-809, AtCDC48386-809, GF14λ, KAPP and KI-KAPP (Shah et al. CITATION) cloned in pJG4-5 and pEG202. Interaction was determined after incubation at 30°C for 2 days. To express the proteins AtCDC48747-809, AtCDC48386-809, GF14λ, GF14λ39-248 and A tSERK1kinase translational fusions were made to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and in the case of AtCDC48747-809, AtCDC48386-809 also to the maltose binding protein (MBP). Protein expression of GST-fusion proteins and GST was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Proteins were solubilised by sonification and GST-fused proteins were bound to glutathione sepharose 4B beads following the manufacturer’s instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The GST-GF14λ and GST-GF14λ39-248 fusion proteins were digested for 7 h with thrombin, releasing GF14λ and GF14λ39-248 from glutathione sepharose 4B bound GST. GST and GST-AtSERK1kinase proteins were eluted from the beads with 15 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Protein expression of MBP-fusion proteins and MBP was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG. The proteins were solubilised by sonification and bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Soluble MBP-fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using amylose resin chromatography according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were eluted from the resin with 15 mM maltose in column buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). All fusion proteins were dialysed against 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM EDTA after purification. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford micro-assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. αGF14λ and αGST-AtSERK1kinase antibodies were generated by immunising rabbits with the purified full length GF14λ protein without the GST-tag or with the purified fusion protein GST-AtSERK1kinase. The rabbit serum was purified from antibodies directed against bacterial proteins by passing the serum over immobilised bacterial protein extract. For Western analysis, the αGF14λ antiserum and the αGST-AtSERK1kinase antiserum were used at a 1:15,000 dilution. Because the αGST-AtSERK1kinase antiserum was raised against the complete GST-AtSERK1kinase fusion protein, it recognises AtSERK1kinase as well as GST. The αGF14λ antiserum shows cross-reactivity with AtSERK1kinase and an unidentified 50 kDa protein, but not with GST. Protein binding assays were performed with phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated GST-AtSERK1kinase. GST-AtSERK1kinase was phosphorylated by adding 100 μM ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30°C in a total volume of 30 μl protein binding buffer (PBB: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2). GST and GST-AtSERK1kinase (3 μg) were bound to glutathione sepharose 4B and AtCDC48747-809 and AtCDC48386-809 (300 ng) were bound to amylose resin by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After immobilising the proteins, the glutathione sepharose 4B beads were first blocked with 1% (w/v) skimmed milk, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then with 2% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 both for 30 min at 4°C. For the binding assays, 1 μg of GF14λ or GF14λ39-248 was added to immobilised GST or GST-AtSERK1kinase and 100 ng of GST or GST-AtSERK1kinase was added to immobilised AtCDC48747-809 and AtCDC48386-809. The proteins were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 300 μl PBB. The immobilised protein complexes were washed three times with 1 ml PBB. Bound proteins were removed from the beads by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the beads and incubating at 100°C for 5 min. The proteins were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western analysis. Transphosphorylation of GF14λ, GF14λ39-248, AtCDC48747-809 and AtCDC48386-809 was tested by incubating 500 ng protein in the presence of 500 ng GST-AtSERK1kinase for 45 min at 30°C in phosphorylation buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, Triton, 10 mM MgCl2) containing 50 μM unlabelled ATP and 3.7×105 Bq of [γ−32P]ATP in a final volume of 30 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 100°C. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity was detected with a PhosphoImager using the Image Quant program (Molecular Dynamics). AtSERK1kinase-specific phosphorylation was tested by incubating the fusion proteins with ATP in the absence of GST-AtSERK1kinase. The cDNA sequence encoding complete GF14λ was amplified from the EST cDNA clone 190N19 in plasmid λZiplox with a gene-specific primer on the transcription start of GF14λ containing an EcoRI site (5′-GGG AAT TCG GCG GCG ACA TTA GGC AGA G-3′) and a λZiplox-specific primer containing a XhoI site (5′-CCG CTC GAG GGC CAG TGA ATT GAA TTT AGG-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned in the corresponding sites of vector pMON999 containing the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) gene, resulting in the CFP-GF14λ construct. In addition, the PCR fragment was also digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in the corresponding sites of vector pEYFP*-C1 (Clontech). The resulting construct was then digested with NheI and BamHI and the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-14-3-3 fragment was cloned in the XbaI and BamHI sites of vector pMon999, resulting in the YFP-GF14λ construct. The CFP/YFP fusion proteins were constructed and transiently expressed in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) mesophyll protoplasts as described (Shah et al. CITATION). The CFP and YFP fluorescence was analysed as described previously by Shah et al. (CITATION). For DAPI staining, protoplasts were fixated for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). Protoplasts were stained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-dianidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in Vectashield antifade solution (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and analysed with a Zeiss epi-fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD-camera. Pictures were taken with a DAPI filter and a FITC filter using Genus software (Applied Imaging). Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorescently labelled AtSERK1kinase and 14-3-3 proteins was measured by fluorescence spectral imaging microscopy (FSPIM) as described by Shah et al. (CITATION). Spectral images were acquired using a 60× oil immersion objective with a 150 groove/mm grating on the entrance slit of the spectrograph, set at a central wavelength of 500 nm and a slit width of 100 μm corresponding to 5 μm in the object plane. Typical exposure and CCD integration time was 3 s. The resulting fluorescence spectra were corrected for background fluorescence and camera bias by background subtraction using an extracellular region from the same spectral image. Acceptor photobleaching (APB) (Wouters and Bastiaens CITATION) was performed by bleaching the YFP fluorophore in a previously defined region for 2 s with 50–100% laser power at 514 nm. Images of the protoplast were taken with a 3.25 s time interval.
