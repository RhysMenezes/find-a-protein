!~ABS~! Auxin is a key plant hormone that regulates plant development, apical dominance, and growth-related tropisms, such as phototropism and gravitropism. In this study, we report a new Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor, MYB77, that is involved in auxin response. In MYB77 knockout plants, we found that auxin-responsive gene expression was greatly attenuated. Lateral root density in the MYB77 knockout was lower than the wild type at low concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and also under low nutrient conditions. MYB77 interacts with auxin response factors (ARFs) in vitro through the C terminus (domains III and IV) of ARFs and the activation domain of MYB77. A synergistic genetic interaction was demonstrated between MYB77 and ARF7 that resulted in a strong reduction in lateral root numbers. Experiments with protoplasts confirmed that the coexpression of MYB77 and an ARF C terminus enhance reporter gene expression. R2R3 MYB transcription factors have not been previously implicated in regulating the expression of auxin-inducible genes. Also it was previously unknown that ARFs interact with proteins other than those in the Aux/IAA family via conserved domains. The interaction between MYB77 and ARFs defines a new type of combinatorial transcriptional control in plants. This newly defined transcription factor interaction is part of the plant cells' repertoire for modulating response to auxin, thereby controlling lateral root growth and development under changing environmental conditions.
!~RES~! MYB77 was identified as being specifically downregulated in Arabidopsis roots by potassium deprivation (CITATION). To gain insight into what functional processes this transcription factor may influence, MYB77 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis, and two inactivation lines, myb77-1 (Salk_67655) and myb77-2 (Salk_55373), were isolated. The roots and shoots of the lines overexpressing MYB77 (MYB77-ox) were stunted under control conditions, whereas the knockout lines showed no obvious phenotype under control conditions (Figures 1A and 1B ). The stunted growth phenotype was similar to wild-type plants grown on higher concentrations of the plant hormone auxin (Figure 1B). [[FIGURE]] To determine in which cells and tissues MYB77 might function, gene expression was localized using the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven by the 1904-bp MYB77 promoter. Expression of MYB77 was detected in roots (Figures 2A to 2H ) and leaves (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). At the initiation of lateral root emergence, MYB77 expression was visible mainly in the vascular tissue (Figure 2A). As the lateral roots emerged through the epidermis, the reporter gene was expressed above and below the emerging lateral root primordia (Figure 2B). Upon emergence of the lateral root, the expression of MYB77 became strongly localized behind the lateral root tip (Figures 2C and 2D). Later in lateral root development, strong expression of MYB77 was seen in a discrete region just behind the tip (Figures 2E to 2G), and eventually the expression of MYB77 could be seen in the vasculature (Figure 2G). In the primary root, MYB77 was expressed within the root cap and in the inner cell layers, including the stele (Figure 2H). MYB77 expression partially overlapped localized auxin accumulations as indicated by the DR5:GUS auxin-responsive reporter (CITATION), especially when treated with exogenous IAA (Figures 2 and 3 ; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Moreover, analysis of MYB77 expression using the Genevestigator Atlas showed that MYB77 is expressed in primary and lateral root tips. (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/at/index.php?page=tairandoption=atlasandagi=AT3G50060). The expression pattern of MYB77 in the different parts of roots was also confirmed using PCR, which showed that MYB77 was more strongly expressed in the tips of lateral and primary roots (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The strongly stunted root phenotype observed in MYB77-ox lines suggested that MYB77 modulates gene expression in response to auxin. MYB77-ox and myb77-1 knockout lines were crossed to plants containing the DR5:GUS auxin-responsive reporter gene (CITATION). As MYB77-ox lines with the highest levels of expression (Figure 1B) exhibited much lower levels of fertility, MYB77-ox lines with medium levels of overexpression were used in these and subsequent experiments. MYB77-ox seedlings grown on control medium showed increased DR5:GUS expression in roots and shoots compared with the wild type (10 independent lines tested) (Figures 3A and 3B), and DR5:GUS activity was reduced in roots and shoots of myb77-1 (Figure 3C). Methyl umbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide (MUG) fluorometric assays (CITATION) showed that GUS activity was lower in the knockout line and higher in the overexpression line compared with the wild type containing the DR5:GUS construct (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). These results suggest that either auxin sensitivity or auxin concentrations were altered by changes in MYB77 expression. To determine whether the alterations in DR5:GUS activity observed when MYB77 expression was manipulated accurately reflected localized auxin concentrations, free IAA concentrations were measured in wild-type, MYB77-ox, and myb77 knockout plants grown under potassium-sufficient and -deficient conditions (Figure 3D). To eliminate differences resulting from altered lateral root number, free IAA levels were assayed in 6-d-old seedlings before lateral roots appeared. Shoot concentrations of free IAA did not vary significantly across the lines or in potassium-sufficient conditions (Figure 3D). In wild-type roots, free IAA concentrations decreased significantly under potassium-deficient conditions. In contrast with the wild type, the free IAA concentrations in the roots of MYB77-ox and myb77-1 were unchanged by potassium deficiency (Figure 3D). The free IAA levels in myb77-1 roots were reduced compared with the wild type under potassium-sufficient conditions but were the same as the wild type under potassium-deficient conditions. However, free IAA levels in MYB77-ox roots were not different from the wild type and myb77-1 under both conditions. The observed alterations in auxin concentrations could be a result of altered auxin transport in myb77-1 and MYB77-ox lines. Basipetal auxin transport in hypocotyls and roots was assayed using [3H]-IAA (CITATION, CITATION). Although auxin transport in hypocotyls was not significantly altered by potassium deficiency in the wild type, myb77-1, or MYB77-ox, auxin transport was reduced under potassium deficiency when myb77-1 was compared with the wild type (P < 0.02; see Supplemental Figure 4A online). In roots, basipetal auxin transport was uniformly reduced under potassium deficiency in the wild type and myb77-1 and MYB77-ox lines (P < 0.01), but no differences in transport were observed between the lines (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). Overall free IAA levels observed in MYB77-ox roots and shoots and in the myb77-1 shoots under control conditions did not differ from the wild type to the extent expected from DR5:GUS reporter activity, which was also measured under control conditions, suggesting that MYB77 regulates auxin signaling processes and auxin concentrations. MYB77 is expressed in both primary and lateral roots; therefore, we determined the effects of exogenous auxin on root growth in the wild type and myb77-1 (Figure 3E) and myb77-2 lines (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). When Arabidopsis seedlings were grown with low exogenous IAA, lateral root density was significantly less in the myb77 knockout plants compared with the wild type (Figure 3E; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). At higher concentrations of auxin, the lateral root density was greater in myb77 knockout plants than the wild type. The difference in lateral root density was due to changes in the number of lateral roots and small changes in primary root length (Figure 3E). From these results, it appears that MYB77 acts as a positive regulator of lateral root responses at low auxin concentrations and has inhibitory effects at higher auxin concentrations. MYB77 is downregulated by potassium deprivation. To determine whether the remaining expression of MYB77 plays a role in lateral root growth under nutrient deprived conditions, lateral root density was quantified. When plants were deprived of potassium, the lateral root density in myb77-1 and myb77-2 was significantly lower than the wild type (Figure 4A ). Under nitrogen or phosphorus deprivation, the lateral root density was the same for the wild type and for myb77-1 and myb77-2. To determine whether the reduced lateral root numbers under potassium-deprived conditions is an auxin-dependent process, the lateral root density of an auxin receptor mutant (tir1-1) was measured under control and deprived conditions (Figure 4B). Similar to the myb77 knockout mutant lines, tir1-1 had a significantly lower lateral root density under potassium deprivation than the wild type (Figure 4B). [[FIGURE]] Since results suggested that MYB77 may be involved in lateral root growth and response to auxin, we assayed the expression of genes that are upregulated by exogenous auxin in the wild type and in myb77-1 before and after the addition of 10 μM IAA to buffered solutions containing seedlings. Our results clearly show that in the wild type, the expression of IAA1, IAA19, PIN1, GH3.2, GH3.3, SAUR-AC1, HAT2, and MYB77 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) was upregulated 0.5 to 24 h after the addition of IAA (Figure 5 ). By contrast, the induction of these genes was greatly attenuated or abolished in the myb77-1 knockout. However, the expression of non-auxin-inducible MYB transcription factors (MYB66 and MYB123; CITATION; CITATION) (Figure 5) was not altered in myb77-1 or the Col-0 wild type with or without the addition of auxin (Figure 5). Moreover, auxin-inducible genes were expressed at higher levels in the MYB77-ox lines with different levels of MYB77 expression, even without the application of exogenous IAA (Figure 5). [[FIGURE]] Multiple putative MYB binding motifs (CITATION) were identified in all seven of the promoters from the genes (Figure 5) that are induced by auxin treatment. MYB factor binding motifs MRE (AACC) and MYBcore (CNGTTR) were previously determined (CITATION), and our own gel shift assay experiments confirmed those results with MYB77 (data not shown). Our data show that after IAA addition, the expression of IAA19 in myb77-1 was also greatly attenuated (Figure 5). Similarly, auxin-responsive genes are downregulated in a nph4-1 mutant (null for ARF7), including IAA19 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether ARF7 and MYB77 might interact and bind to the IAA19 promoter, we analyzed the gene sequence 500 bp upstream of the IAA19 start codon. In that region, auxin response elements (AuxREs) (CITATION) are located in close proximity to MYB binding sites (Figure 6A ). The similar attenuation of auxin-induced gene expression in the myb77-1 knockout (Figure 5) and nph4-1 (null for ARF7) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and the proximity of the MYB and AuxRE binding sites in IAA19 suggested that these two proteins may interact to exert combinatorial control over the transcription of certain auxin-responsive genes. [[FIGURE]] To determine if MYB77 and ARF7 transcription factors interact, in vitro pull-down assays were performed. Results showed that the MYB77 bound to ARF1 and ARF7 (Figures 6B and 6C) as well as ARF 2, 5, and 6 (data not shown), which were the five ARFs tested in this study and represent both repressors and activators of transcription. In vitro MYB77 also binds to IAA19 (Figure 6C), but we did not detect this interaction between IAA19 and MYB77 in vivo using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system (tested in four independent experiments). Further studies showed that the interaction between MYB77 and ARF7 was dependent on domains III and IV, which are present in most ARF proteins and also Aux/IAA proteins (Figures 6B and 6C) (CITATION; CITATION). An unrelated His-tagged protein (glyoxalase; At1g11840; data not shown) and two other MYB transcription factors (Figure 6C) (MYB66 and MYB123; CITATION; CITATION) did not bind in vitro to ARF7, indicating some specificity in the interaction between MYB77 and ARF7 proteins. The binding of MYB77 and ARFs in vitro suggest that the interaction between these proteins may contribute to the modulation of auxin-responsive genes in planta. To determine whether MYB77 interacts with ARF7 in vivo, BiFC was used in both Arabidopsis roots and onion epidermal cells (CITATION). Cobombardment of MYB77 and ARF7 fused to parts of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (pUC-SPYNE; N terminus of YFP, pUC-SPYCE; C terminus of YFP) was performed. Fluorescence was observed in the nucleus of cells in which the MYB77 in pUC-SPYNE and ARF7 in pUC-SPYCE (or MYB77 in pUC-SPYCE and ARF7 in pUC-SPYNE) were expressed, indicating complementation of YFP (Figure 7A ). As positive controls, ARF7 in pUC-SPYNE and IAA19 in pUC-SPYCE (or ARF7 in pUC-SPYCE and IAA19 in pUC-SPYNE) were tested, which also resulted in fluorescence in the nucleus (Figure 7A). As a negative control, pUC-SPY constructs containing ARF or MYB77 were bombarded with the relevant empty vector (either pUC-SPYCE or pUC-SPYNE), and no fluorescence was observed (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To further demonstrate the activity of MYB77 plant protoplasts, we used Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts (CITATION). Transfection of the effector gene encoding MYB77 enhanced expression of the auxin-responsive 2XD0 reporter gene, which contains four TGTCTC AuxREs, the binding sites for ARFs (CITATION) (Figures 7B and 7C). The activity was severalfold higher with the MYB77 effector gene compared with the control effector gene, CAT, in both the absence and presence of auxin, 1-naphthalene acetic acid (Figure 7C). The enhanced activity with MYB77 was dependent on the TGTCTC AuxREs in the 2XD0 reporter gene because a Gal4-D1-3 reporter gene, which contains four mutated AuxREs, showed no response to the MYB77 effector gene (GD in Figure 7D). If a truncated version of the ARF5 activator with a Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) substituted for its own DBD, but containing its activation and C-terminal dimerization domains was targeted to Gal4 binding sites in the D1-3 promoter, transfection of the MYB77 effector gene did enhance transcription of the D1-3 reporter gene (GD-5AC in Figure 7D). By contrast, transfection of a truncated ARF5 lacking both its own DBD and C-terminal dimerization domain resulted in stronger activation of the D1-3 reporter gene, but there was little response to the transient expression of the MYB77 effector gene (GD-5A in Figure 7D), indicating that the C terminus was required for enhanced expression of the reporter gene in the presence of MYB77. There was also no effect of the MYB77 effector gene if a DBD truncated ARF1 consisting of its repression domain and C-terminal dimerization domain was targeted to Gal4 sites in the D1-3 promoter (Figure 7D). Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to identify which part of MYB77 interacts with ARF7 (Figure 8 ). His-tagged full length of MYB77, N-terminal R2R3 domain (R2R3), and N-terminal deletion (ΔN) of MYB77 (Figure 8A) were precipitated with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ARF7 using protein A beads and HA antibodies. The C-terminal region of MYB77 (ΔN) coimmunoprecipiated with ARF7 (Figure 8B). [[FIGURE]] To provide further evidence for potential interactions between MYB77 and ARF7 in planta, a homozygous double mutant between myb77-1 knockout plants and arf7 (nph4-1) was created. The lateral root density under control conditions was measured in the wild type, myb77-1 knockout plants, arf7 (nph4-1) null, and the double mutant of MYB77 and ARF7 (myb77-1 nph4-1) (Figure 9 ). Lateral root density was lower in nph4-1 compared with the wild type or myb77-1. Knockout of MYB77 in the nph4-1 background further decreased the lateral root density. This result implies that MYB77 and ARF7 interact synergistically in planta. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) was used for this study. Transgenic plants carrying constitutively overexpressing MYB77 (MYB77-ox) and ProMYB77:GUS (MYB77 promoter with GUS) were generated. For constitutive expression, we used pCambia2300 (CAMBIA) with figwort mosaic virus promoter (CITATION) and nopaline synthase terminator (NOS). For the localization of gene expression, a 1904-bp region upstream from the start codon of the MYB77 gene was amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA. The binary vector constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis plants by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated floral dip method. Seeds of the myb77-1 knockout plant (Salk_67655) and myb77-2 (Salk_55373) were obtained from the ABRC. MYB77 has only one exon, and in both inactivation lines, the T-DNA was inserted into the exon. MYB77 transcripts were not present in either knockout, as determined by RNA gel blot analysis (Figure 5; data not shown). The isolation of arf7/nph4, which is a null mutant of ARF7, was described previously (CITATION). DR5:GUS transgenic plants were used to test for auxin responsiveness (CITATION). Plants containing DR5:GUS were crossed to myb77-1 or MYB77-ox plants with DR5:GUS, and homozygous lines were generated. For the auxin sensitivity assay, seeds of Col-0, myb77-1, and myb77-2 were grown on plates containing nutrient solution (CITATION), 2% sucrose, and 0.8% SeaKem agarose (Cambrex) at 22°C with a 16-h daylength at 200 μmol·m−2.s−1. Seedlings of Col-0, myb77-1, and myb77-2 were transferred to medium of the same composition containing various concentrations of auxin 4 d after germination (DAG). The length of primary roots and lateral root number were measured 7 d after transfer (n = 50 to 70 plants). Quarter-strength Murashige and Skoog medium was also used for auxin response experiments. The results were similar, except that higher concentrations of IAA were required to elicit responses. The 4-d-old Col-0, myb77-1, and tir1-1 were transferred to potassium-deficient and -sufficient plates, and the primary root length and the number of lateral roots were measured to determine the lateral density 7 d after transfer. For potassium deficiency growth assays, 10 μM KCl instead of 1.75 mM KCl was used, 12 μM phosphoric acid instead of 0.5 M phosphoric acid was used for phosphate-deficient growth assay, and 100 μM Ca(NO3)2 instead of 2 mM Ca(NO3)2 was used for nitrogen-deficient growth. To localize GUS activity, plants were stained with 1 mM X-Gluc solution 4 DAG for primary root localization and 12 DAG for lateral root localization. The pictures were taken using a Nikon SMZ1500 dissecting microscope. For these assays, plants were transferred 3 or 11 DAG to full nutrient (1.75 mM KCl) medium and then grown for 7 d before staining. For the DR5 analysis, 10 progeny for each of three overexpressor and three knockout lines were analyzed. For the ProMYB77:GUS experiments, >10 lines were tested, and expression patterns were found to be consistent among the lines. MUG fluorometric assays for the quantitative analysis of GUS activity (CITATION) were used to quantify GUS activity. To confirm the spatial localization of MYB77 in roots based on ProMYB77:GUS activity, RT-PCRs of MYB77 (3′ untranslated region) were performed with 1 mm of primary and lateral root tips and other parts of primary roots and lateral roots. Images were quantified using ImageJ. For free auxin quantifications, hypocotyl and root segments of 300 seedlings were collected and pooled for each replicate. For the K+ deprivation treatment, seedlings were transferred to K+-sufficient or K+-deficient media for 24 h. Auxin transport assays and free IAA determinations were as described by CITATION except using an Agilent 6890N/5973 gas chromatograph/mass selective detector and a LECO Pegasus IV GCXGC time-of-flight mass spectrometer for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. Seven-day-old Arabidopsis Col-0, myb77-1, and MYB77-ox-1, 2, and 3 were transferred to 10 μM MES solution, pH 5.8, with or without 10 μM IAA (Sigma-Aldrich). The seedlings were kept in the light and put on a slow shaker and harvested after 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24 h. The amplified 3′ untranslated regions of the cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham), and RNA gel blot analyses were performed as described by CITATION. RNA gel blots to characterize the expression of MYB77 in the myb77-1 knockout were performed with both a full-length cDNA and the 3′ untranslated region to confirm that the allele was a null. The MYB77 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NdeI and SacI sites of the pET28 vector (Novagen). The MYB77 in-frame fusion in pET28 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Overexpression of MYB77:HIS was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 20°C for 4 h. Bacteria were pelleted after the induction period, suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole), and subjected to sonication on ice for 1 min. Bacterial lysates were then centrifuged. The His-tagged fusion protein was recovered by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich). The MYB66 cDNA and MYB123 cDNA were amplified by PCR and cloned into the SacI and HindIII sites of pET28 vector. N-terminal His tag–fused MYB66 and MYB123 were obtained in the same way as MYB77 and used for in vitro pull-down assay controls. Bacterial extracts of MYB77:His were immobilized on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column and then incubated for 90 min at 4°C with in vitro–translated [35S]Met-labeled ARF1, ARF7, and IAA19 (ARF2, ARF5, and ARF6; data not shown) that were obtained using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Beads were washed, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, exposed to an imaging plate, and scanned using the Typhoon 9410 system (Amersham Biosciences). An unrelated His-tagged protein (glyoxalase) and two other MYB proteins (MYB66 and MYB123) were used as controls in the pull-down assays. To clone into BiFC vectors, MYB77, ARF7, and IAA19 were amplified and fused to part of YFP at both the N or C terminus into pUC-SPYNE (N-terminal) and pUC-SPYCE (C-terminal) via SpeI and XmaI (CITATION). Fusion to either the N or C terminus gave the same results. All constructs were fully sequenced. For transient expression, particle bombardment was performed using onion cells and Arabidopsis roots. Gold particles (1.0-μm diameter) were washed with 100% ethanol and coated with 5 μg of each DNA. Gold-coated DNAs were bombarded using a Bio-Rad PDS1000/He particle gun. To stain the nucleus of onion cells and Arabidopsis roots, Hoescht dye (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for 30 min. The bright-field and fluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with appropriate YFP and Hoescht filters. The 2XD0:GUS and Gal4-D1-3:GUS [previously referred to as Gal4(4X)-D1-3(4X):GUS] reporter genes have been described previously (CITATION; CITATION). The Pro35S:HA-MYB77-NOS effector construct was made by cloning the MYB77 open reading frame in front of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S double enhancer promoter and terminated by NOS. The HA epitope was cloned in frame at the N terminus of the MYB77 open reading frame. The ARF effector genes and modified versions have been described (CITATION). Isolation of protoplasts and transfection assays with Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts were performed as described (CITATION). Protoplasts were incubated in the presence and absence of 1 μM NAA. Pro35S:CAT-NOS was used as an inactive control effector gene used to equalize the amount of DNA transfected into cells. All transfections were performed in triplicate, and three independent transfections were performed for each of the effector genes tested. HA:ARF7, MYB77:His, R2R3 domain of MYB77 (R2R3; amino acids 1 to 110), and N-terminal deletion of MYB77 (ΔN; amino acids 111 to 301) were translated with [35S]Met using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system. The in vitro–translated HA:ARF7 was incubated with in vitro–translated MYB77, R2R3, and ΔN for 16 h at 4°C. HA antibody was added (1:150) to each reaction and incubated for 16 h at 4°C. Protein A beads (Fluka) were equilibrated using 1 M glycine and 2 M NaCl solution, pH 9, and 5 μL of 50% slurry of Protein A beads were added to in vitro–translated mixtures with HA antibodies and incubated for 16 h at 4°C. Each reaction was washed three times with 500 μL of 1 M glycine and 2 M NaCl buffer, pH 9, and three times with 500 μL of 0.02 M NaH2PO4 and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 8, buffer. The beads were resuspended in 20 μL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then denatured at 95°C for 10 min. Reactions were run on SDS-PAGE gels (15%), dried, exposed to a phosphor imaging screen, and scanned using the Typhoon 9410 system. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers for the genes from this article are as follows: MYB77 (At3g50060), ARF7 (At5g20730), ARF1 (At1g59750), ARF5 (At1g19850), IAA1 (At4g14560), IAA19 (At3g15540), Pin1 (At1g73350), GH3.2 (At4g37390), GH3.3 (At2g23170), SaurAC (At4g38850), HAT2 (AT5g47370), MYB123 (At5g35550), MYB66 (At5g14750), and MYB44 (At5g67300).
