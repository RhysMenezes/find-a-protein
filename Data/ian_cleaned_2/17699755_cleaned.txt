!~ABS~! Several positive regulators of phytochrome A signaling—e.g., LAF1, HFR1, and HY5—operate downstream from the photoreceptor, but their relative sites of action in the transduction pathway are unknown. Here, we show that HFR1RNAi/laf1 or hfr1-201/LAF1RNAi generated by RNA interference (RNAi) has an additive phenotype under FR light compared with the single mutants, hfr1-201 or laf1. This result indicates that LAF1 and HFR1 function in largely independent pathways. LAF1, an R2R3-MYB factor, interacts with HFR1, a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) factor, and this interaction is abolished by the R97A mutation in the LAF1 R2R3 domain. Polyubiquitinations of LAF1 and HFR1 by the COP1 E3 ligase in vitro are inhibited by LAF1/HFR1 association. Consistent with this result, endogenous HFR1 is less stable in laf1 compared with wild type, and similarly, LAF1-3HA expressed from a transgene is also less stable in hfr1-201 than wild type. In transgenic plants, HFR1 levels are significantly elevated upon induced expression of LAF1 but not LAF1(R97A). Moreover, induced expression of LAF1 but not LAF1(R97A) delays post-translational HFR1 degradation in FR light. Constitutive coexpression of HFR1 and LAF1 but not HFR1 and LAF1 (R97A) confers FR hypersensitivity in double transgenic plants. Our results show that in addition to their independent functions in phyA signaling, LAF1 and HFR1 also cooperate post-translationally to stabilize each other through inhibition of ubiquitination by COP1, thereby enhancing phyA photoresponses. 
!~RES~! The seedling phenotype of hfr1-201(Col) and laf1(Ler) is not as severe as that of phyA-201(Ler) or phyA-211(Col), suggesting that LAF1 and HFR1 may control two largely distinct pathways. To examine this possibility, we created a hfr1laf1 double mutant for comparative analysis with single mutants hfr1-201 and laf1. Because the two single mutants are in different ecotype backgrounds, we decided to use hairpin (hp) RNA (RNAi [RNA interference]) to silence LAF1 expression in hfr1-201 and HFR1 expression in laf1. We designated these plants LAF1RNAi/hfr1-201 and HFR1RNAi/laf1 (hereafter referred to as double mutants) and selected three lines each for further analysis. Figure 1A shows that the RNAi-mediated silencing was effective in the selected transgenic lines with no detectable LAF1 or HFR1 transcript as monitored by RT–PCR. Phenotypic analysis shows that the double mutants displayed additive phenotype, with hypocotyl lengths longer than those of the single mutants but shorter than those of phyA mutants at low FR fluences (Fig. 1B). This was the case even at higher FR fluences (Fig. 1C). To further verify the specificity, we transformed wild-type plants with each RNAi vector. The hypocotyl lengths of single-gene RNAi lines were comparable to either hfr1-201 or laf1 mutants (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] We performed Northern blot analyses with four phyA-dependent genes—CAB, FNR, RBCS, and CHS—using hfr1-201, laf1, and hfr1laf1 double mutant seedlings grown in darkness for 4 d followed by exposure to FR light for 18 h. Figure 2 shows that expression of these four genes was induced by FR in wild-type (Col and Ler) plants. FR-induced expression of CAB, FNR, and RBCS was reduced in hfr1-201 and laf1 mutants compared with those in wild type. Moreover, expression levels of CAB, FNR, and RBCS were lower in LAF1RNAi/hfr1-201 or HFR1RNAi/laf1 double mutants compared with single mutants (hfr1-201 and laf1). These results indicate that both LAF1 and HFR1 function as positive regulators for gene expression. In contrast to CAB, FNR, and RBCS, CHS expression was reduced in laf1 but increased in hfr1-201. This opposing pattern of CHS expression had been previously described (CITATION; CITATION) and is consistent with the view that LAF1 functions as a positive regulator while HFR1 functions as a negative regulator. Northern blot analyses of CHS expression in the double mutants support this view (Fig. 2A,B).  [[FIGURE]] To investigate possible LAF1/HFR1 interaction, we used several MBP (maltose-binding protein) and GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion proteins for in vitro pull-down assays. Figure 3A shows that GST-HFR1 interacted with MBP-COP1, MBP-HFR1, and MBP-LAF1 but not with MBP-PAT1, another phyA signaling component (CITATION), nor with MBP alone. GST alone did not pull down any of the MBP fusions mentioned above excluding nonspecific binding. These results indicate that HFR1 can self-associate as well as interact with LAF1. The interaction of HFR1 with COP1 confirms previous observations of in vitro ubiquitination by the E3 ligase (CITATION; CITATION). We also confirmed LAF1/HFR1 interaction using LAF1 synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation (Supplementary Fig. S1).  [[FIGURE]] Next, we generated deletion mutants of each protein to identify their interacting region. The C-terminal region of HFR1, designated HFR1(C), was able to interact with the N-terminal region of LAF1, designated LAF1(N) (Fig. 3B,C). Note that HFR1(C) is identical to the HFR1(ΔN) that we reported previously (CITATION).  We also examined the subcellular location of HFR1 and LAF1 using onion epidermis cells. Coexpression of HFR1-YFP and LAF1-CFP showed that the two proteins localized to the same nuclear bodies (Supplementary Fig. S2).  LAF1, which is also known as AtMYB18 (CITATION), shares sequence homology in the R3 domain to those of AtMYB5 and AtMYB75, as well as of rice MYB2 and maize MYB8 (Fig. 3C, panel a). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created two LAF1 mutants, W87A and R97A. Compared with wild type, LAF1 binding to HFR1 in vitro was much weaker in LAF1(W87A) and LAF1(N), and not detectable with LAF1(R97A) (Fig. 3C). We conclude that amino acid residues 87 and 97 of LAF1 are important for HFR1 association and the R97A mutation completely abolishes interaction in vitro.  We generated double transgenic plants coexpressing LAF1-6Myc or LAF1(R97A)-6Myc and HFR1-3HA. Both proteins were unstable in transgenic plants, but their expression levels can be increased by MG132, which blocks 26S proteasomes (Fig. 3D). Immunoprecipitation of HFR1-3HA pulled down LAF1-6Myc, indicating that the two factors associate in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro interaction results, this LAF1/HFR1 association was dependent on amino acid R97 of LAF1 (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the R97 mutation did not affect LAF1 localization to nuclear bodies (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that HFR1 interaction is not needed for this process.  Both LAF1 (CITATION) and HFR1 (CITATION; CITATION) have been shown to be COP1 substrates in vitro. We considered the possibility that interaction of the two substrates may somehow affect their ubiquitination by COP1. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of increasing concentrations of one factor on COP1-mediated ubiquitination of the other. Figure 4A shows that increasing concentrations of LAF1 attenuated polyubiquitination of HFR1 and vice versa. This attenuation was not seen with the noninteracting LAF1(R97A) mutant (Fig. 4B). Together, these results show that LAF1/HFR1 association reduces their polyubiquitination by COP1.  [[FIGURE]] Previous work showed that HFR1-3HA can complement the deficiency of the hfr1-201 mutant (CITATION). To examine the activity of a similarly tagged LAF1 in transgenic plants, we transformed laf1 with 35S-LAF1-3HA and also with 35S-LAF1(R97A)-3HA, and five independent lines were analyzed for each construct. Figure 5 shows that the hypocotyl length of laf1 can be restored to near wild-type levels by expression of wild-type LAF1-3HA. Similar complementation was observed with the noninteracting mutant, LAF1(R97A)-3HA, expressed at a similar protein level, except that the mutant was less efficient than wild-type LAF1-3HA. In all cases, the protein products of the transgenes in all the five lines for each construct were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 5B). These experiments show that appending an epitope at the C terminus of LAF1 does not compromise its biological activity. Moreover, LAF1(R97A), which does not interact with HFR1, was still able to complement the mutation, albeit with reduced efficiency.  [[FIGURE]] Using specific HFR1 antibodies for in vivo pull-down assays, we showed that wild-type LAF1-3HA but not its R97 mutant interacted with the endogenous HFR1 (Fig. 5C).  The observation that epitope-tagged HFR1 and LAF1 still retain their biological activities allowed us to use double transgenic plants expressing these two factors to investigate the consequence of their interaction in vivo. If LAF1/HFR1 association inhibits HFR1 ubiquitination by COP1, we would expect HFR1 to be stabilized in vivo by this association. To examine this issue with appropriate internal controls, we generated double transgenic plants expressing HFR1-3HA and inducible LAF1-6Myc and selected two lines for further analysis. We treated transgenic seedlings with low concentrations of MG132 to accumulate low levels of HFR1 to establish a baseline for comparison (Fig. 6A). Figure 6A, panel a, shows that induced expression of LAF1-6Myc increased HFR1 levels by two to five times depending on the transgenic line, and under this condition, there was no change in levels of COP1 nor phyA. Northern blot analysis confirmed that HFR1 transcript remained at similar levels with or without inducer treatment (Fig. 6A, panel b).  [[FIGURE]] We performed control experiments using transgenic plants expressing HFR1-3HA and inducible LAF1(R97A)-6Myc, which was unable to interact with HFR1 (Fig. 3). In contrast to wild-type LAF1, induced expression of the noninteracting LAF1(R97A) did not significantly alter HFR1 levels (Fig. 6B, panel a). Additional control experiments showed that LAF1 expression had a small stabilization effect on HFR1(C)-3HA, which already accumulated to high levels in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 6B, panel b).  To investigate the phenotypic consequence of LAF1/HFR1 interaction, we compared seedling phenotypes of double overexpressors with single overexpressors. Figure 6C, panel a confirmed previous data that overexpression of neither HFR1 nor LAF1 alone produced FR hypersensitivity. In contrast, FR hypersensitivity was obtained in plants expressing the two factors, and this effect was seen in three independent transgenic lines. Western blot analysis showed that HFR1-6Myc and LAF1-3HA were present in the coexpressing plants, although the levels were substantially increased with MG132, indicating continued degradation (Fig. 6C, panel b). Control experiments showed that in plants expressing 35S-HFR1-6Myc, coexpression of LAF1(R97A)-3HA to comparable levels as the wild-type LAF1-3HA (Fig. b 6C, panel b,c; Supplementary Fig. S4) did not confer FR hypersensitivity, indicating the requirement of LAF1/HFR1 interaction for enhanced photoresponses.  We have previously shown that HFR1 is degraded post-translationally with a half-life of ∼1 h (CITATION). Figure 7A confirms this observation and, in addition, demonstrates that the half-life of HFR1 decay can be prolonged to 2 h upon induced LAF1 expression. Similar experiments using cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis showed that the LAF1 post-translational degradation half-life (∼1 h) was similarly prolonged to 2–3 h in the presence of coexpressed HFR1. As a negative control, we examined the effects of induced expression of the noninteracting mutant LAF1(R97A). Figure 7B, panel a, shows that the HFR1 decay rate was not significantly altered by induced expression of LAF1(R97A), indicating the requirement of LAF1/HFR1 interaction to delay HFR1 degradation. Note that the decay rate of LAF1(R97A) was ∼1–2 h, irrespective of the presence of HFR1 (Fig. 7B, panel b).  [[FIGURE]] Using antibody to HFR1, we also investigated the post-translational fate of endogenous HFR1 in wild-type and transgenic plants deficient in LAF1. Figure 7C shows that the HFR1 half-life was reduced in LAF1RNAi plants compared with wild type, indicating that a deficiency in LAF1 destabilized the endogenous HFR1. Because we were unsuccessful in preparing antibody to LAF1, we compared the decay rate of transgenic LAF1-3HA, rather than the endogenous LAF1, in wild type and hfr1-201. Similar to the case of HFR1, the LAF1-3HA half-life was also reduced by the absence of HFR1. Taken together, these results provide additional evidence that the stability of one factor is decreased in the absence of its interacting partner in the endogenous setting. 
!~MM~! The wild-type Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, hfr1-201 (in the Col background) (CITATION), and laf1 (in the Ler background) (CITATION) were used in this study. Conditions for plant growth and FR irradiation were described by CITATION, and the following FR fluence rates were used: 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 10 μmol/m2/sec. Plants were transformed by the Agrobacterium strain EHA105 using the floral dip method (CITATION).  The mutants hfr1-201 (Col) and laf1 (Ler) are in different ecotypes, and they both contain a kanamycin-resistance marker. To avoid potential issues with ecotypic differences in photoresponses, we used hairpin RNA to silence either HFR1 or LAF1 in the appropriate mutant background. The LAF1-RNAi contained ∼500 base pairs (bp), whereas the HFR1-RNAi construct contained ∼350 bp. DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using the following oligo sets: 5′-CACCGCTCAAGTCTCAGAGCTTAC-3′ and 5′-ACGTCGTTGTTGATGGAGAA-3′ for LAF1-RNAi, and 5′-CACCTGCGTAAGCTACAGCAACTC-3′ and 5′-CGTGAAGAGACTGAGGAGAA-3′ for HFR1-RNAi. PCR-amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pENTR/D, followed by LR reaction with pBA-DC-RNAi to generate pBA-RNAi-LAF1 and pBA-RNAi-HFR1, which confer Basta resistance. These RNAi constructs were transformed into wild-type (Col or Ler) or mutant (hfr1-201 or laf1) backgrounds. Homozygous T3 Basta- and kanamycin-resistant double mutants were selected and used for further analysis.  Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kits (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript II RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  RT–PCR was performed as described (CITATION). The oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-TTCTTGCTGGACCACT GTTC-3′ and 5′-ACGTCGTTGTTGATGGAGAA-3′ for LAF1 amplification, 5′-GTCGGATCACTTGCTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-CGTGAAGAGACTGAGGAGAA-3′ for HFR1 amplification, and 5′-GGACAAGCTGGGATCCAGG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCCA CCTTCAGCACC-3′ for Tubulin (Tub) amplification.  Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (CITATION) using HFR1, CAB, FNR, RBCS, and CHS probes identical to those described elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION).  Plasmids encoding MBP-COP1, MBP-HFR1, and MBP-HFR1(C) for protein expression in Escherichia coli and plasmids encoding 35S-HFR1-3HA, 35S-HFR1-6Myc, and 35S-HFR1(C)-3HA for protein expression in plants were described previously (CITATION). Most constructs except GST-tagged vectors in this study were made using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). Construction of these destination vectors has been described elsewhere (CITATION).  HFR1(N) contains amino acids 1–101 of HFR1, and LAF1(N) contains amino acids 1–160 of LAF1. DNA sequences encoding these regions were amplified by PCR using full-length cDNAs of HFR1 (CITATION) and LAF1 (CITATION). cDNA encoding full-length PAT1 was amplified by PCR to generate pMBP-DC-PAT1. All cDNA or DNA fragments were cloned in pENTR/D vector (Invitrogen) and then transferred into the appropriate vectors by recombination using the LR Clonase enzyme according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).  To generate LAF1 mutant genes (W87A or R97A), site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), pENTR-LAF1 as a template, and the following primer sets: 5′-TCTTCCTTGGGTAA CAAGGCGTCGCAAATAGCTAAATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATTT AGCTATTTGCGACGCCTTGTTACCCAAGGAAGA-3′ for LAF1(W87A), and 5′-GCTAAATTCTTACCGGGAGCAACAG ACAATGAGATAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTTATCTCATTGTCTGT TGCTCCCGGTAAGAATTTAGC-3′ for LAF1(R97A). After mutagenesis of LAF1, the mutant genes were used as a template for PCR reaction and cloned in a pENTR/D vector, followed by LR reaction to generate pMBP-DC-LAF1(W87A) and pMBP-DC-LAF1(R97A).  cDNAs encoding full-length HFR1, LAF1, and LAF1(R97A) were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGST-HFR1, pGST-LAF1, and pGST-LAF1(R97A), respectively. All constructs used in this study were verified by sequencing.  Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified from bacterial extracts as described (CITATION).  Experimental procedures were essentially as described before (CITATION). For in vitro pull-down assays, the reaction mix was incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B for 2 h. After washing with buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.6% Triton X-100), pulled-down proteins were separated on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gels and were detected by Western blotting using anti-MBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  For in vitro ubiquitination assays, each reaction mixture (30 μL) contained ∼100 ng of protein substrate (MBP-HFR1-3HA), 20 ng of rabbit E1 (Boston Biochem), 20 ng of human E2 UbcH5b (Boston Biochem), 10 μg of His6-ubiquitin (Sigma), and 200 ng of E3 (MBP-COP1) with or without GST-LAF1 or GST-LAF1(R97A).  Reactions were carried out for 2 h at 30°C. Ten microliters of the reaction mixtures were separated on 8% SDS–polyacrylamide gels, and ubiquitinated MBP-HFR1-3HA and GST-LAF1 or GST-LAF1(R97A) were detected by Western blotting with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-GST (Sigma) antibodies, respectively.  For in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, 10-d-old double transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings [35S-HFR1-3HA and XVE-LAF1-6Myc or 35S-HFR1-3HA and XVE-LAF1(R97A)-6Myc] treated with MG132 (50 μM) plus β-estradiol (10 μM) for 16 h were used. Five micrograms of anti-HA monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody were used for coimmunoprecipitation, and eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA, and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies.  We generated polyclonal HFR1 antibody using MBP-HFR1 protein. Specific HFR1 antibody was partially purified from rabbit serum using GST-HFR1 protein.  The subcellular localization experiment, protein extraction, and Western blot analysis were identical to those described by CITATION.
