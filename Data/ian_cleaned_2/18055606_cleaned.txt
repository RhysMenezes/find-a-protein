!~ABS~! The pseudoresponse regulators (PRRs) participate in the progression of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis thaliana. The founding member of the family, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), is an essential component of the transcriptional network that constitutes the core mechanism of the circadian oscillator. Recent data suggest a role in circadian regulation for all five members of the PRR family; however, the molecular function of TOC1 or any other PRRs remains unknown. In this work, we present evidence for the involvement of PRR3 in the regulation of TOC1 protein stability. PRR3 was temporally coexpressed with TOC1 under different photoperiods, yet its tissue expression was only partially overlapping with that of TOC1, as PRR3 appeared restricted to the vasculature. Decreased expression of PRR3 resulted in reduced levels of TOC1 protein, while overexpression of PRR3 caused an increase in the levels of TOC1, all without affecting the amount of TOC1 transcript. PRR3 was able to bind to TOC1 in yeast and in plants and to perturb TOC1 interaction with ZEITLUPE (ZTL), which targets TOC1 for proteasome-dependent degradation. Together, our results indicate that PRR3 might function to modulate TOC1 stability by hindering ZTL-dependent TOC1 degradation, suggesting the existence of local regulators of clock activity and adding to the growing importance of posttranslational regulation in the design of circadian timing mechanisms in plants.
!~RES~! In order to gain insight into the time of day when PRR3 functions in the clock, we analyzed PRR3 temporal expression by diurnal time course array data that were obtained from Diurnal (http://diurnal.cgrb.oregonstate.edu). PRR3 transcription exhibits a circadian profile in constant white light (CITATION), and we observed that PRR3 transcript also peaked at dusk under long-day and short-day conditions. Interestingly, the PRR3 circadian profile was remarkably similar to that of TOC1 even under different photoperiods, indicating that the temporal expression of these genes was highly correlated (Figures 1A and 1B ). [[FIGURE]] To further explore the relationship between TOC1 and PRR3, we also analyzed the spatial expression patterns of PRR3 and TOC1 using promoter-driven β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene constructs (PPRR3:GUS and PTOC1:GUS). Interestingly, PRR3:GUS activity was observed mainly in the vascular tissues of cotyledons and leaves (Figure 1C). No GUS activity was detected in the roots. PTOC1:GUS was broadly expressed, and TOC1 promoter activity was detected in cotyledons, whole leaves, and roots (Figure 1D). Together, these data indicate that PRR3 and TOC1 expression are temporally correlated but spatially overlapping only in the vasculature. Next, we investigated whether a clock phenotype would result from a decrease in PRR3 levels by testing a prr3 mutant and PRR3 RNA interference (RNAi) plants using the well-characterized bioluminescent circadian reporters CCR2:LUC and CAB2:LUC (Millar et al.,1995; CITATION). PRR3RNAi plants were constructed by cloning a fragment of 480 bp that is unique to the PRR3 cDNA in the sense and antisense orientations into an RNAi vector and transforming the construct into the CCR2:LUC background. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses confirmed a strong reduction in PRR3 mRNA in several lines (down to 12% of wild-type levels; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Bioluminescent analyses of CCR2 rhythms revealed that both PRR3RNAi lines had a shorter period (PRR3RNAi plant 25, 24.3 ± 0.1 h; PRR3RNAi plant 26, 23.8 ± 0.1 h; PRR3RNAi plant 58, 24.4 ± 0.1 h) than the wild type (24.9 ± 0.1 h) (P < 0.01) in free-running conditions (Figure 2A ). In addition, prr3-1, a T-DNA insertion line from the Salk collection (see Methods), was transformed with the same reporter that was observed to cause a similar effect (prr3-1, 23.8 ± 0.0 h; wild type, 24.6 ± 0.1 h) (P < 0.01) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Similar results were obtained when transforming the PRR3RNAi construct into the CAB2:LUC background (PRR3RNAi plant 14, 23.0 ± 0.2 h; PRR3RNAi plant 19, 23.3 ± 0.6 h; wild type, 23.5 ± 0.2 h) (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). [[FIGURE]] This modest effect on period length suggests a role for PRR3 in the plant clock; however, the confined spatial expression pattern of PRR3 led us to consider whether the ubiquitous expression of CCR2 and the broad expression of CAB2 might not accurately portray the circadian function of PRR3 (CITATION; CITATION). To test this possibility, we constructed a PRR9:LUC promoter fusion as a circadian reporter, as we could observe an intense activity of the PRR9 promoter in the vasculature of PRR9:GUS plants (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). PRR3RNAi was transformed into the PRR9:LUC background, and bioluminescence analyses exhibited a shortening in period length significantly greater than that observed on CCR2 rhythms (PRR3RNAi plant 39, 22.9 ± 0.1 h; PRR3RNAi plant 44, 23.1 ± 0.1 h; PRR3RNAi plant 56, 23.2 ± 0.2 h; wild type, 24.6 ± 0.1 h) (P < 0.01) (Figure 2C). In addition, we examined the expression profile of CYCLING DOF FACTOR1 (CDF1) in wild-type and PRR3RNAi plants. CDF1 expression was previously shown to be controlled by the circadian clock and restricted to the vasculature (CITATION). After 2 d in constant conditions, CDF1 mRNA peaked considerably earlier (6 to 8 h) in PRR3RNAi lines than in the wild-type plants, while the peak of expression of CCA1 and LHY, two ubiquitously expressed morning genes (J. Pruneda-Paz and S.A. Kay, unpublished results), showed only a modest advance (Figures 2D to 2F). These results indicate that decreased levels of PRR3 had a stronger effect on the expression of clock-regulated genes that are specifically expressed in the vascular tissues. These phenotypes support the notion that PRR3 participates in the regulation of the Arabidopsis circadian clock and might play an important role in clock progression in the vascular tissue. A decrease in PRR3 expression affects the pace of the clock in a similar manner as a decrease in TOC1 expression. These observations led us to the following hypotheses: (1) PRR3 and TOC1 have overlapping functions; or (2) PRR3 might influence the stability or function of TOC1. To test the first hypothesis, we constructed a toc1 prr3 double mutant and also transformed the PRR3RNAi construct into the toc1 mutant background. We reasoned that if TOC1 and PRR3 functions are partially redundant, the double mutant should have a stronger phenotype than either single mutant. The clock phenotypes of the toc1 prr3 and toc1 PRR3RNAi double mutants were indistinguishable from that of the toc1 mutant alone, indicating that TOC1 was epistatic to PRR3 (see Supplemental Figures 4A and 4B online). In order to test the possibility that PRR3 might regulate TOC1 stability, we set out to monitor TOC1 protein and mRNA levels in prr3-1 mutant and PRR3RNAi lines. Transgenic plants expressing TOC1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under the control of theTOC1 native promoter (designated TOC1 Mini Gene [TMG]) were crossed to the prr3-1 mutant or transformed with the PRR3RNAi construct, and the amount of TOC protein was detected on protein gel blots. In addition, transgenic plants expressing a transcriptional fusion of the PRR3 coding region with the strong, constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated to assess the effect of increased levels of PRR3 on TOC1. The P35S:PRR3 construct was also transformed into the CCR2:LUC reporter background, in which higher PRR3 expression caused a 1- to 1.5-h increase in the free-running period of CCR2:LUC (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). Time-course analyses revealed that the pattern of TOC1 protein expression was altered in all backgrounds. In prr3-1, TOC1 levels were reduced significantly at the end of the dark period (at circadian time 20), and a similar effect was observed in the PRR3RNAi background (Figures 3A and 3C ). Increased levels of PRR3 caused a dramatic change in the TOC1 expression profile, as TOC1 protein was detected at all time points in the PRR3-overexpressing background (Figure 3E). Interestingly, rhythmic oscillation of TOC1 protein was still observed in the P35S:PRR3 plants. [[FIGURE]] In order to establish whether the changes in TOC1 protein profiles in the prr3 mutant, PRR3RNAi, and the PRR3-overexpressor might be due to changes in TOC1 mRNA levels, RT-qPCR analyses were performed to monitor TOC1 transcript in all of the genotypes. In photocycles (12 h of light/12 h of dark), TOC1 mRNA expression maintained a rhythmic pattern with similar levels in all lines tested, indicating that PRR3 does not affect the TOC1 transcription profile (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3F). Together, these data indicate that disruption or decreased levels of PRR3 resulted in lower TOC1 protein, while increased levels of PRR3 had the opposite effect of making TOC1 protein more abundant, all without affecting TOC1 transcription. As we have shown above, PRR3 is involved in a molecular mechanism that affects the levels of TOC1 protein. As PRR3 expression is restricted to the vasculature, we set out to examine whether the abundance of TOC1 protein would be different in the tissues in which TOC1 and PRR3 are coexpressed. In order to visualize TOC1 protein, we fused TOC1 to the GUS gene under the control of the TOC1 native promoter (TMG:GUS). TOC1 protein clearly localized to the nucleus, and it was detected in all of the tissues in which the TOC1 gene was found to be expressed (Figures 1 and 4 ). Yet, the GUS activity appeared to be more intense in the veins of the leaves compared with the epidermis (Figure 4). These data indicate that the levels of TOC1 protein might be higher in the vasculature and strengthen the hypothesis of a local increase of TOC1 stability, possibly mediated by PRR3. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of decreased and increased levels of PRR3 on TOC1, we asked whether PRR3 was able to interact physically with TOC1. PRR3 fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (bait) was coexpressed with TOC1 fused to the activation domain of GAL4 (prey) in yeast, and the interaction between these proteins was assayed by monitoring β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity. Strong β-gal activity in yeast colonies that expressed both TOC1 and PRR3 indicated a physical interaction between these proteins (no β-gal activity was detected in the control) (Figure 5A ). The interaction between TOC1 and PRR3 was also verified in vivo by transient expression of PRR3 and TOC1 in tobacco (Nicotiana bethamiana) leaves. Tagged versions of both PRR3 and TOC1 were coexpressed in tobacco, and TOC1-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) was immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody. Subsequent detection of hemagglutinin (HA)-PRR3 with an anti-HA antibody revealed a protein of ∼70 kD (consistent with the predicted size of the PRR3 protein) only in the sample in which both PRR3 and TOC1 were present, indicating that PRR3 is able to bind TOC1 in planta (Figure 5B). [[FIGURE]] As we observed that PRR3 binds TOC1 in vitro and in vivo and that increased levels of PRR3 resulted in higher levels of TOC1 protein, we speculated that the binding of PRR3 to TOC1 might prevent the formation of a TOC1-ZTL complex that leads to TOC1 degradation (CITATION). In order to test this hypothesis, we performed a yeast three-hybrid assay. TOC1 was fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (bait) and coexpressed with ZTL fused to the activation domain of GAL4 (prey) in yeast. The bridge protein PRR3 was then conditionally expressed under the control of the MET25 promoter, whose activity is repressed in the presence of Met, and β-gal activity was monitored by a liquid culture assay (CITATION). In the absence of PRR3, TOC1 and ZTL were able to interact, while in the presence of PRR3, the formation of the TOC1-ZTL complex was disturbed, as indicated by a 50% decrease in β-gal activity (Figure 5C). In addition, we coexpressed PRR3 fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 with the full-length ZTL and the LOV domain fused to the activation domain of GAL4 in yeast. No β-gal activity was detected in yeast colonies that expressed either ZTL or the LOV domain and PRR3, indicating that PRR3 and ZTL are not likely to interact physically in yeast (Figure 5A). In summary, these data indicate that PRR3 interacts physically with TOC1 and acts as a competitor to modulate the extent of the interaction between TOC1 and ZTL. The data presented thus far suggest that PRR3 regulates TOC1 stability by physically binding to TOC1 and preventing ZTL-dependent degradation. This model presents a number of testable predictions. First, PRR3 overexpression should ameliorate the short-period phenotype observed upon the reduction of TOC1 protein levels but, critically, should have no effect on the period length in a toc1 null allele. Second, increased levels of PRR3 should weaken the strong clock phenotype of a ZTL-overexpressor line. In order to test the first prediction (i.e., that elevated levels of PRR3 could partially rescue the clock phenotype due to decreased levels of TOC1 by stabilizing TOC1 protein), a TOC1RNAi line (previously designated TOC1RNAi-24 in CITATION) was transformed with the P35S:PRR3 construct. The TOC1RNAi P35S:PRR3 lines displayed an increase in the period length of CAB2:LUC (TOC1RNAiP35S:PRR3 line 52, 21.1 ± 0.2 h; line 77, 21.0 ± 0.2 h) compared with the parental TOC1RNAi line (19.5 ± 0.1 h) (P < 0.01) (Figure 6A ). Hence, increased levels of PRR3 caused a slight but reproducible increase of the TOC1RNAi period toward that of the wild type. Importantly, no change in period was seen after introducing P35S:PRR3 in the toc1-4 mutant background (toc1-4P35S:PRR3 line 68, 19.3 ± 0.4 h; line 69, 19.6 ± 0.2 h; line 71, 19.7 ± 0.3 h; line 77, 19.2 ± 0.3 h; toc1-4, 19.5 ± 0.1 h) (P ≥ 0.5). The toc1-4 allele is a point mutation that creates a premature stop close to the N terminus of the protein, resulting in a null mutation (CITATION) (Figure 6B). Together, these results support the notion that PRR3 stabilizes TOC1 protein in vivo. [[FIGURE]] We demonstrated that PRR3 is able to compete with ZTL for TOC1 binding in yeast. Next, we set out to investigate whether PRR3 was able to interfere with ZTL action on TOC1 stability in vivo. It was reported previously that increased levels of ZTL shortened the period length in a dosage-dependent manner and caused arrhythmicity at the highest doses (CITATION). As this phenotype is likely due to the extreme instability of the TOC1 protein in such a background, increased levels of PRR3 might be able to partially ameliorate the ZTL mutant phenotype by binding to TOC1 and preventing ZTL from interacting with TOC1. To generate a ZTL-overexpressor (P35S:ZTL), ZTL coding sequence was expressed under the control of the 35S promoter in a CAB2:LUC background and fast Fourier transform nonlinear least square (FFT-NLLS) analyses confirmed a severe loss of circadian rhythmicity, since no rhythm could be fitted for CAB2:LUC traces from most P35S:ZTL seedlings and the few fitted rhythms exhibited a relative amplitude error > 0.6 (see Methods) (Figure 7 ). These plants were transformed with the P35S:PRR3 construct, and several independent transgenic lines recovered rhythmic oscillation of the CAB2:LUC reporter, as exemplified by P35S:ZTLP35S:PRR3 lines 89 and 99: 96.7% of P35S:ZTLP35S:PRR3 line 89 seedlings (n = 30) and 90% of P35S:ZTLP35S:PRR3 line 99 seedlings (n = 30) exhibited relative amplitude errors < 0.6 when analyzed using FFT-NLLS (Figure 7). In addition, these P35S:ZTLP35S:PRR3 lines displayed a period of CAB2 that was close to that of the wild type (wild type, 23.06 ± 0.09 h; P35S:ZTLP35S:PRR3 line 89, 22.70 ± 0.1 h; P35S:ZTLP35S:PRR3 line 99, 22.36 ± 0.12 h). This indicates that PRR3 protein counteracts ZTL action in vivo. Together, our results suggest that PRR3 might interfere with the formation of the ZTL-TOC1 complex through binding to TOC1, resulting in the stabilization of TOC1. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown as reported previously (CITATION). Ecotype Col-0 harboring the CCR2:LUC reporter was transformed with either the PRR3RNAi or P35S:PRR3 construct. The prr3-1 (SALK_090261) mutant was obtained from the Salk collection through the ABRC. TOC1RNAi-24 was described previously, as were the toc1-2 and toc1-4 alleles (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). TMG construction was reported elsewhere (CITATION). PPRR3:GUS and PPRR9:GUS constructs were created by cloning the genomic sequences −1.8kb/+123bp and −1.3kb/+81bp, respectively, into pMDC63 (CITATION). For TOC1:GUS, the TOC1 genomic sequence −1.7kb/+27bp was cloned into pBI101 (Clontech). The PRR9:LUC construct was obtained by cloning the genomic sequence −1.3kb/−1bp into pZPXomegaLuc (CITATION). To make the PRR3RNAi construct, 480 bp was amplified from a cDNA pool using primers PRR3RNAi F (5′-AACGGGAGTGGAACTCAGAGT-3′) and PRR3RNAi R (5′-caccAGCCTTCTTAGCAGAAGTAGC-3′) and cloned into the pH7WG2 binary vector (CITATION). The HA-PRR3 coding sequence was amplified with the forward primer 5′-caccATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTATGTGTTTTAATAACATTGA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CAATTGTCTTCACTTCCTG-3′ (uppercase letters indicate genomic sequence, lowercase letters indicate the sequence required for Gateway cloning, and the underlined sequence indicates the HA sequence) and cloned into the pH7WG2 binary vector to make the P35S:PRR3 construct (CITATION). The forward primer contains the sequence for the HA tag. To overexpress ZTL, the ZTL coding sequence was cloned into pRTL2 vector, and the expression cassette was then cloned into pBI221 binary vector (CITATION). All Arabidopsis transformations were achieved by Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration using the floral dip method. For tobacco (Nicotiana bethamiana) infiltration, TOC1 genomic sequence (4500 bp downstream of the ATG) was cloned into pMDC83 and transformed into Agrobacterium. Seedlings were grown for 2 weeks in photocycles and then stained as described by CITATION. Photographs were taken with a Diagnostic Instruments SPOT-RT Slider camera mounted on a Nikon SMZ800 stereoscope equipped with Dyna Light 150 fiber optics. Seeds were germinated on selective medium and entrained in 12-h light/12-h dark photocycles. One-week-old seedlings were transferred to plates without selection and placed in continuous light (60 μmol·m−2·s−1). Bioluminescence was detected and the data were analyzed as described (CITATION; CITATION). FFT-NLLS was used to estimate period length and relative amplitude error to assess rhythm robustness. The relative amplitude error value of 0.6 was used as a cutoff to identify rhythmic traces within the circadian range For yeast two-hybrid assay, BP reactions via the Gateway LR system (Invitrogen) were performed to clone PRR3 coding sequence into the pASGW vector to fuse it with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and to clone full-length TOC1, full-length ZTL, and the ZTL LOV domain into pACTGW vector to fuse them with GAL4 activation domain (CITATION). For yeast three-hybrid assay, the PCR product NotI-PRR3cDNA-BamHII was cloned into MCSII in pBridge (Clontech) downstream of the MET25 promoter and XmaI-TOC1cDNA-SalI was cloned into MCSI in the same vector. As prey, ZTL coding sequence was cloned into pACTGW vector. These construct were used to transform the suitable yeast strains, and the selection and β-gal assays were conducted following the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook). Agrobacterium containing P35S:TOC1, P35S:HAPRR3, and P35S:HA19 was grown overnight and resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl2 and 0.15 μM acetosyringone) to reach a concentration of 0.8 OD600. This suspension was pressure-infiltrated into tobacco leaves using a syringe. After 2 d, the tissue was infiltrated with 0.50 μM MG132 and harvested after 4 h. Proteins were extracted from 0.2 g of plant tissue and ground in 0.5 mL of grinding buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 50 μM MG132, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and ∼60 to 80 μg of total protein was loaded per lane to separate them on a 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel. Homogeneous protein transference to nitrocellulose membranes was confirmed by Ponceau red staining. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) was used to detect TOC1-YFP. For coimmunoprecipitation, proteins were extracted in IP buffer (50 mM Na-P, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 50 μM MG132, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich], and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]), and the immunoprecipitation was performed at 4°C using Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) coated with anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen). PRR3 detection was performed using anti-HA antibody 3F10 (Roche), and TOC1 was detected using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). Total RNA from 10-d-old seedlings was isolated with the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was produced from 1.5 μg of total RNA using the iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The product was diluted 1:5 with water, and 2 μL was used as template for RT-qPCR amplification on a MyiQ iCylcer (Bio-Rad) with the following primers and probes: for TOC1, forward, 5′-TCTTCGCAGAATCCCTGTGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTGCACCTAGCTTCAAGCA-3′; probe, 5′-ATGATGTCGAGGCAAGACGAAGTCCC-3′; for PRR3, forward, 5′-TCCCGTTATCACTCCCACCATCTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTGGGAGTAGTGGTGGTTTGAGTA-3′; probe, 5′-TTTGTCCAAGAACTCTGAGTTCCA-3′. Primers and probes for CCA1 and CDF1 were described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Each RT-qPCR experiment was repeated three times. Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative database under the following accession numbers: At5g60100 (PRR3), At5g61380 (TOC1), At5g57360 (ZTL), At5g62430 (CDF1), At2g46830 (CCA1), and At1g01060 (LHY).
