!~ABS~! The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteinase complex that is responsible for regulated proteolysis of polyubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. Here, we report novel 26S proteasome interacting proteins in Arabidopsis as revealed by LC–MS/MS analysis. We performed a two-step screening process that involved affinity purification of the 26S proteasome using Arabidopsis plants expressing a FLAG-tagged RPT2a subunit and partial purification of the 26S proteasome from cultured cells by glycerol density gradient centrifugation (GDG). Two plastid proteins, LTA2 and PDH E1α, which were commonly identified by both affinity purification and GDG, interacted with the 26S proteasome both in vitro and in vivo, and the transit peptides of LTA2 and PDH E1α were necessary for the interaction. Furthermore, the degradation of both LTA2 and PDH E1α was inhibited by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Similar to those two proteins, 26S proteasome subunits RPT2a/b and RPT5a interacted with the transit peptides of three other chloroplast proteins, which are known to be substrates of the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system. These results suggest that a direct interaction between the 26S proteasome and a transit peptide is important for the degradation of unimported plastid protein precursors to maintain cellular homeostasis.
!~RES~! To identify novel 26S proteasome interacting proteins, we examined a two-step screening process that involved two proteomic approaches. First, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment with a FLAG-RPT2a plant. We had reported that RPT2a played an important role in leaf organ size regulation, which involved the control of both endoreduplication and cell size.CITATION RPT2a also regulated gene silencing that involved DNA methylation in transgenes and some specific endogenous genes.CITATION Taking those findings into consideration, RPT2a is considered to be one of the important subunits for plant development and survival. Thus, we used this line to find novel 26S proteasome interacting proteins. As shown in Figure CITATIONA, many protein bands were purified from the FLAG-RPT2a plant but not from wild-type plant (Figure CITATIONA). MS/MS analysis showed that 216 proteins were isolated from FLAG-RPT2a, and, as expected, 47 subunits of the 26S proteasome were identified (CITATION). Among the 216 isolated proteins, 97 components of ribosomal proteins were identified (CITATION). Interestingly, 72 proteins in addition to ribosomal proteins were identified as novel proteasome interacting candidates (CITATION). By categorization based on FunCat, proteins related to metabolism (31.9%) and protein synthesis (20.8%) were markedly enriched (CITATION). Compared to a previous proteome report,CITATION 13 of 72 proteins isolated by FLAG-RPT2a were identified as ubiquitylation targets, implying that this proteomic analysis identified the target proteins of UPS. To narrow the 26S proteasome interacting proteins, we performed proteomic analysis of a partially purified 26S proteasome by GDG. Because the 26S proteasome complex is stable with ATP and dissociates into 19S RP and 20S CP without it, we used this principle to purify 26S proteasome interacting proteins. As shown in Figure CITATIONB, a peak corresponding to the peptidase activity of the 26S proteasome appeared in fraction 22 of the protein sample with ATP (Figure CITATIONB). Immunoblot analysis using anti-RPN6 and anti-20S antibodies also revealed the presence of the 26S proteasome in the fraction. On the other hand, neither activity nor a protein subunit of the 26S proteasome was present in fraction 22 of the protein sample without ATP (Figure CITATIONC). To identify 26S proteasome interacting proteins, protein samples of fraction 22 with and without ATP were subjected to MS/MS analysis, and the quantitatively isolated proteins from both samples were compared. In this experiment, we defined proteins identified from the samples with ATP showing more than a 40% difference in the probability legend as putative 26S proteasome interacting proteins because we wanted to select only proteins with high probability. As a result, 11 proteins showing significantly larger amounts from the sample with ATP than from that without ATP were found in addition to 13 subunits of the 26S proteasome (CITATION), although the existence of additional proteins could not be eliminated (CITATION). Five of the identified 11 proteins were related to metabolism by categorization based on FunCat (CITATION). Comparing both the results of FLAG-RPT2a immunoprecipitation and GDG, two proteins, the pyruvate decarboxylase E2 subunit, LTA2, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit, PDH E1α, were commonly identified as 26S proteasome interacting candidates (CITATION). Thus, those two proteins should be the most probable 26S proteasome interacting proteins. According to the gene ontology annotation, both LTA2 and PDH E1α were assigned to the chloroplast. To confirm interactions between the 26S proteasome and LTA2 or PDH E1α, Y2H was performed for 21 subunits of the 26S proteasome (RPN1a, RPT2a, RPT2b, RPT3, RPT4b, RPT5a, RPT5b, RPT6a, RPN1a, RPN2a, RPN3b, RPN5a, RPN6, RPN7, RPN8a, RPN9a, RPN10, RPN11, RPN12a, RPN15a, and RPN15b) (CITATION). Relative β-galactosidase activities were further measured to confirm the interactions between LAT2 or PDH E1α and the proteasome subunits that showed positive results in CITATION (Figure CITATIONA,B). As expected, both LTA2 and PDH E1α interacted with at least RPT2a and RPT2b. Moreover, LTA2 or PDH E1α interacted with RPN8a or with RPT5a and RPT5b, respectively. To examine in vivo interactions between the 26S proteasome and LTA2 or PDH E1α, the transient expression in N. benthamiana and a coimmunoprecipitation assay were performed. As expected, both LTA2 and PDH E1α interacted with RPT2a (Figure CITATIONC,D). These results suggest that the 26S proteasome interacts with LTA2 and PDH E1α both in vitro and in vivo. LTA2 and PDH E1α were annotated to localize in the chloroplast, as described above. In addition, they were predicted to have transit peptides involved in the translocation from cytosol to plastid (CITATION). Although the 26S proteasome interacted with LTA2 and PDH E1α, those proteins were localized differently from those of the 26S proteasome, which is known to exist mainly in nucleus and cytosol.CITATION Thus, we hypothesized that the 26S proteasome interacted with the precursors of LTA2 and PDH E1α in cytosol. To clarify this, we investigated whether a transit peptide is necessary to bind to the 26S proteasome. For this purpose, we analyzed the interactions between RPT2a and LTA2 that was divided into four parts: N-terminal section (1–240 aa), C-terminal section (241–481 aa), transit peptide truncated LTA2 (48–481 aa), and transit peptide only (1–47 aa) predicted by the ChloroP 1.1 prediction server (Figure CITATIONA). Y2H showed that RPT2a interacted with the N-terminal section and the only transit peptide, but it did not interact with the C-terminal section or the transit peptide truncated LTA2 (Figure CITATIONB), suggesting that the transit peptide of LTA2 is necessary for interacting with RPT2a. The interaction between RPT2a and the transit peptide of LTA2 was revealed. In addition, by MS/MS analysis of the proteins isolated by FLAG-RPT2a immunoprecipitation and partial purification of the 26S proteasome, 32 of 72 proteins (44.4%) and 5 of 11 proteins (45.5%) were found to localize in the chloroplast according to gene ontology annotation, respectively (CITATION). By using the ChloroP 1.1 prediction server, we were also able to predict that 24 and 4 proteins isolated by FLAG-RPT2a immunoprecipitation and the partial purification of 26S proteasome have transit peptides, respectively. Furthermore, previous reports have indicated that ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase small subunit 1a (RBCS1a), Clp protease P4 (ClpP4), and FtsH protease 1 (FtsH1), which are chloroplast-targeted proteins, are the targets of UPS.CITATION From these results, the 26S proteasome may interact with nuclear-encoded plastid proteins as well as LTA2 via their transit peptides. To examine this possibility, the transit peptides of PDH E1α, RBCS1a, ClpP4, and FtsH1 in addition to LTA2 predicted by the ChloroP 1.1 prediction server were tested for their interactions with RPT2a. As expected, all of the transit peptides interacted with RPT2a (Figure CITATION). The transit peptides also interacted with RPT5a, but they did not interact with RPT3 or RPN8a (Figure CITATION), suggesting that the 26S proteasome interacts with transit peptides of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins in general using at least the RPT2a and RPT5a subunits. Because the transit peptides of plastid proteins were shown to interact with the 26S proteasome, we asked if LTA2 and PDH E1α were degraded by the 26S proteasome. To answer this question, LTA2 and PDH E1α degradation assays were performed. The degradation of LTA2 was inhibited by 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not by DMSO treatment (Figure CITATIONA). As in the case of LTA2, the degradation of PDH E1α was also inhibited by MG132 (Figure CITATIONB). The carboxyl terminus of heat shock protein cognate-interacting protein (CHIP) is a chaperon-dependent E3 ligase that physically interacts with heat shock proteins and the 26S proteasome in mammals.CITATION Arabidopsis CHIP-like protein (AtCHIP) has been reported to interact with chloroplast-targeted proteins, such as RBCS1a, ClpP4, and FtsH1, to ubiquitinate them for to promote their degradation.CITATION Thus, we hypothesized that AtCHIP interacts with LTA2 and PDH E1α proteins for their degradation via UPS. To investigate this, we examined the in vivo interaction between LTA2 and AtCHIP or between PDH E1α and AtCHIP using a transient expression system. As expected, AtCHIP interacted with both LTA2 (Figure CITATIONC) and PDH E1α (Figure CITATIOND). In addition, we examined the in vitro interaction between AtCHIP and the transit peptides of LTA2 or PDH E1α by Y2H assay (Figure CITATIONE). As expected, both transit peptides interacted with AtCHIP. These results imply that LTA2 and PDH E1α are ubiquitinated by AtCHIP.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia-0; Col-0) used in this study was grown under the conditions described previously.CITATION Routine subculture of Deep suspension cultured cells was performed as described previously.CITATION Transgenic plants expressing FLAG-RPT2a under the 35S promoter (FLAG-RPT2a) were transformed as described previously.CITATION T4 progenies homozygous for transgenes were used for experiments. Seedlings of FLAG-RPT2a plants, or Col-0 as a negative control, were grown for 2 weeks and pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and a pestle. The immunoprecipitation assay was performed as previously described.CITATION Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with a silver stain MS kit (Wako). A gel lane was excised into 30 pieces, and the gel pieces were destained with 50 mM sodium thiosulfate and 15 mM potassium ferricyanide, dehydrated by washing twice with 100% acetonitrile, and dried with a vacuum concentrator. The proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 56 °C for 45 min and then alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. After washing twice with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, the samples were dehydrated again with 50% acetonitrile and dried. The protein samples were then subjected to in-gel digestion using sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega).CITATION The crude extract was prepared from 4 day old Deep cells after subculturing using standard buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μM leupeptin with or without 2 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCl2 for GDG as described previously.CITATION Total proteins in the 26S proteasome fraction (1 mL each) were precipitated by acetone and resuspended in 6 M urea/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The samples were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C and carbamidomethylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Alkylated proteins were digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega KK, Tokyo, Japan) at a 1:50 enzyme/protein concentration at 37 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptide mixture was filtered with an Ultrafree-MC 0.45 μM filter unit (Merck Millipore, Tokyo, Japan), and the filtrate was subjected to LC–MS/MS. The prepared peptides were loaded onto a column (100 μm internal diameter, 15 cm; L-Column, CERI) using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC pump (Michrom BioResources) and an HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics). Buffers were 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (A) and 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and 90% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (B). A linear gradient from 5 to 45% B for 26 min was applied, and peptides eluted from the column were introduced into an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 500 nL/min and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The mass resolution for the precursor ion scanning was 30 000, the dynamic exclusion time was 30 s, and the repeat count was 1. The MS scan range was m/z 400–1500, and the three most abundant peaks from the MS scan were selected for MS/MS analysis. The MS/MS spectra were compared against TAIR8 (release date, April 2008; protein-coding genes: 27 235; http://www.arabidopsis.org/), and MS scores were calculated using the MASCOT server (http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html) as previously described.CITATION The MASCOT search parameters were as follows: threshold set-off at 0.05 in the ion-score cutoff, peptide tolerance at 10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance at ±0.8 Da, peptide charge of 2+ or 3+, trypsin as the enzyme, up to one missed cleavage allowed, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as the fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine as the variable modification. By protein identification from the affinity purification of the 26S proteasome, all of the results of LC–MS/MS were combined for MASCOT search. Only proteins with a score of over 40 and a significance at p < 0.05 were selected as candidate proteins with high reliability. Then, proteins identified from the negative control (CITATION) were subtracted from proteins identified from FLAG-RPT2a. For the identification and quantification of proteins from GDG, MS/MS spectra were analyzed by the MASCOT server described above, and the results were applied to the sequential label-free quantification of relative protein abundance, which was performed by spectral counting using all spectra that matched a peptide sequence based on the algorithm of Scaffold 2. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability. Functional classification of identified proteins by LC–MS/MS analyses was carried out based on the FunCat classification scheme of the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/funcatDB/). The presence of chloroplast transit peptides was predicted using the ChloroP 1.1 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/). Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings as described previously.CITATION cDNA was synthesized from l μg of total RNA with oligo (dT)20 primer using the ReverTra Ace-α kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To produce entry clones, the entire open reading frames (ORFs) of LTA2 (pyruvate decarboxylase E2 subunit; At3g25860), PDH E1α (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit; At1g01090), RPN15a (At1g64750), and RPN15b (At5g45010) were amplified using gene-specific primers, as shown in CITATION. Each fragment was cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO vector (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.). cDNAs of RPT3 (U68680), RPT5b (U13193), RPT6a (U17158), RPN2a (U88266), RPN6 (U09419), RPN9a (U17885), FtsH (U19697), ClpP4 (U15454), RRCS1a (U13397), and AtCHIP (U15353) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). The ORFs were amplified by PCR and introduced into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.). pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vectors containing ORFs of RPT1a (U17196), RPT4b (U16907), RPT5a (U16575), and RPN7 (U16506) and pENTR223.1 vectors containing ORFs of RPN1a (G09175), RPN3b (G67749), RPN5a (G09894), RPN8a (G12541), RPN10 (G09430), RPN11 (G18948), and RPN12a (G12862) were obtained from ABRC. pENTR/D-TOPO vectors containing ORFs of RPT2a and RPT2b were prepared as previously described.CITATION Information on all of the primers used in this study is given in CITATION. For the yeast two-hybrid assay (Y2H), ORFs from the entry vectors were transferred with the LR reaction (Gateway; Life Technologies Japan, Ltd.) to destination vector pEG202gw carrying the LexA binding domain (LTA2, PDH E1α, FtSH1, ClpP4, and RBCS1a) or pJG4-5gw carrying the B42 activation domain (RPT1a, RPT2a, RPT2b, RPT3, RPT4b, RPT5a, RPT5b, RPT6a, RPN1a, RPN2a, RPN3b, RPN5a, RPN6, RPN7, RPN8a, RPN9a, RPN10, RPN11, RPN12a, RPN15a, and RPN15b). For immunoprecipitation, ORFs of LTA2, PDH E1α, and AtCHIP were transferred with the LR reaction to pGWB20 plasmids carrying 10×Myc tag (PDH E1α-10×Myc and LTA2-10×Myc) or to pGWB11 plasmids carrying FLAG tag (AtCHIP-FLAG).CITATION For degradation assays, ORFs of LTA2 and PDH E1α were transferred with the LR reaction to pGWB5 plasmids carrying a sGFP tag (PDH E1α-sGFP and LTA2-sGFP).CITATION Constructs for the transient assay were agroinfiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana, and crude extracts were prepared from the leaves after infiltration for 2 days, as described previously.CITATION Immunoprecipitation was performed as described.CITATION The in vitro degradation assay was performed as previously described.CITATION Signal intensities of the proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an LAS300 and Multi Gauge version 3.0 system (Fujifilm). Three independent experiments were performed. For the selection of the interacting subunits of the 26S proteasome against LTA2 and PDH E1α, the pJG4-5gw or PEG202gw construct was transformed into the L40 or EGY48 yeast strain, respectively, and both strains were mated according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). For further Y2H, both pJG4-5gw and pEG202gw constructs were transformed into the EGY48 yeast strain according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech).
