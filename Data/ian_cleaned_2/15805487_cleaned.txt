!~ABS~! Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue light receptors that share sequence similarity with photolyases, flavoproteins that catalyze the repair of UV light–damaged DNA. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings expressing the C-terminal domains of the Arabidopsis CRY fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) display a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype, indicating that the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through the C-terminal domain. The role of the Arabidopsis CRY N-terminal photolyase-like domain in CRY action remains poorly understood. Here, we report the essential role of the Arabidopsis CRY1 N-terminal domain (CNT1) in the light activation of CRY1 photoreceptor activity. Yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro binding, in vivo chemical cross-linking, gel filtration, and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that CRY1 homodimerizes in a light-independent manner. Mutagenesis and transgenic studies demonstrate that CNT1-mediated dimerization is required for light activation of the C-terminal domain of CRY1 (CCT1). Transgenic data and native gel electrophoresis studies suggest that multimerization of GUS is both responsible and required for mediating a COP phenotype on fusion to CCT1. These results indicate that the properties of the GUS multimer are analogous to those of the light-modified CNT1 dimer. Irradiation with blue light modifies the properties of the CNT1 dimer, resulting in a change in CCT1, activating CCT1, and eventually triggering the CRY1 signaling pathway.
!~RES~! Ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis screens gave rise to more than 22 missense cry1 mutant alleles that express full-length CRY1 apoprotein (CITATION; CITATION). At least 13 of them contain mutations that are distributed throughout CNT1, indicating an essential role of CNT1 in CRY1 action. To explore the CNT1 role, we prepared a construct expressing Myc-tagged CNT1 (Figure 1A, construct 1) and overexpressed it in wild-type Arabidopsis plants. We obtained 40 independent transgenic lines, 32 of which displayed a cry1 mutant phenotype of unexpanded cotyledons as well as long hypocotyls under blue light (Figure 1B, seedling 1), whereas 8 showed a wild-type phenotype in the dark and in red and far-red light (Table 1; data not shown). We examined, by protein gel blot analysis, extracts from the Myc-CNT1 lines showing a cry1 mutant phenotype using anti-Myc and anti-CCT1 antibodies. Some lines showing a cry1 mutant phenotype expressed neither Myc-CNT1 nor endogenous CRY1 (Figure 1C, lanes 8 and 9), indicating a result of cosuppression. However, some lines showing a cry1 mutant phenotype expressed both Myc-CNT1 and endogenous CRY1 at a level similar to that in wild-type plants (Figure 1C, lanes 4 to 7 and 10), indicating a negative effect of Myc-CNT1 on CRY1-mediated photomorphogenic development. Overexpression of Myc-CNT1 in the cry1 mutant background did not mediate blue light responses (Figure 1B, seedling 1*). Analyses of the progeny of a representative plant heterozygous for a single T-DNA insertion locus revealed that the negative effect of Myc-CNT1 was genetically dominant (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] Measurements of Hypocotyl Lengths of Transgenic Seedlings Expressing Various Constructs To define the specificity of the dominant-negative phenotype mediated by Myc-CNT1, we made a construct expressing Myc-tagged GUS (Figure 1A, construct 2) and overexpressed it in the wild-type background. No phenotype change was observed in the Myc-GUS lines (Figure 1B, seedling 2). Protein gel blot analysis indicated that the Myc-GUS fusion protein was expressed at normal levels in transgenic plants (Figure 1D, lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, overexpression of Myc-tagged full-length CRY1 in the cry1 mutant background conferred enhanced blue light responses (Figure 1B, seedling 3). Therefore, the dominant-negative effect of Myc-CNT1 was mediated by CNT1. At least two mechanisms could explain the dominant-negative effect of CNT1. First, CNT1 might interact with endogenous CRY1 to form a CNT1–CRY1 dimer, which is not active or is less active than the native CRY1–CRY1 dimer; second, CNT1 might compete with the endogenous CRY1 for the downstream targets. Because CNT1 does not interact with COP1 (CITATION), we tested the former possibility by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Figures 2A to 2C), although it is possible that CNT1 interacts with the unknown CRY1 targets. Strong CNT1–CRY1 and CNT1–CNT1 interactions were obtained (Figure 2C, samples 1 and 2). Similarly, clear CNT2–CRY2 and CNT2–CNT2 interactions were observed (Figure 2C, samples 9 and 10). CNT1 did not interact with CCT1 (Figure 2C, sample 4). Furthermore, we examined whether full-length CRY1 interacts with CRY1 itself. Although the bait construct expressing the LexA-CRY1 fusion protein showed significant background (Figure 2C, sample 7), full-length CRY1 clearly interacted strongly with CRY1 itself (Figure 2C, sample 3). No interaction was observed among the negative control pairs (Figure 2C, samples 5, 8, and 11). In contrast with CNT, CCT did not interact with the full-length CRY (Figure 2C, samples 6 and 12). Using the plate assay, we found that the CNT1–CRY1 interaction was light-independent in yeast (Figure 2D). [[FIGURE]] To confirm the interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we performed protein interaction studies in vitro using glutathione S-transferase (GST)–CRY1 and GST–CRY2 fusion proteins purified from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Figure 3C), which were soluble and had absorption spectra similar to that of the recombinant CRY1 purified from Sf9 cells (Figures 3A and 3B) (CITATION). CNT, CCT, and full-length CRY were synthesized as radioactively labeled polypeptides by in vitro transcription/translation (Figure 3D). Pulldown assay using these proteins showed that both CRY and CNT bound to CRY under blue light (Figure 3E, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5) and in darkness (data not shown), whereas CCT did not bind to CRY (Figure 3E, lanes 3 and 6). None of the CRY domains and full-length CRY bound to GST (Figure 3F). These results, together with the data from the yeast two-hybrid assays, indicate that CRY might dimerize through CNT. [[FIGURE]] To confirm whether CRY1 dimerizes in vivo, native gel electrophoresis was performed using protein extracts from both light- and dark-grown transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing Myc-CRY1, followed by protein gel blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. Myc-CRY1 was found to be a monomer (data not shown). The failure to detect a CRY1 dimer might reflect the fact that the CRY1 dimer is prone to disassociate during the process of electrophoresis. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, we used the chemical cross-linker formaldehyde to covalently preserve the possible CRY1 dimer in vivo. After treatment with formaldehyde, a novel high molecular mass band, approximately twice as high as that of the Myc-CRY1 monomer, recognized by anti-Myc antibody, was observed after SDS-PAGE separation of the protein extracts prepared from dark-grown and blue light–grown, and blue light–irradiated seedlings expressing Myc-CRY1 (Figure 4A, lanes 2 to 6). [[FIGURE]] To further confirm the homodimerization of CRY1 in vivo, we generated transgenic plants expressing an N-terminal fusion of the TAPa tag to the CRY1 protein (TAPa-CRY1) (CITATION; CITATION) in the wild-type background and conducted gel filtration studies. In both dark and blue light conditions, approximately equal amounts of dimer and monomer of the native CRY1 were obtained (Figure 4C), whereas the TAPa-CRY1 was found almost all as a dimer. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that TAPa-CRY1 bound endogenous CRY1, whereas a TAPa–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion did not (Figures 4D and 4E). Therefore, these data indicate that CRY1 homodimerizes in vivo in a light-independent manner. In an attempt to map the domains within CNT1 that are required for interaction with CRY1, we prepared bait constructs corresponding to a series of CNT1 deletion fragments (Figure 5A). A protein gel blot experiment, conducted on extracts from yeast cells coexpressing CRY1 and any one of the CNT1 fragments, demonstrated that all of the CNT1 fragments were expressed at similar protein levels (data not shown). Unexpectedly, all deletion fragments failed to show an interaction with CRY1 (Figure 5B, samples 2 to 7). Reminiscent of the CRY1 mutagenesis study results indicating that missense mutations throughout CNT1 compromise CRY1 activity, these negative results might reflect the fact that the overall structure of CNT1 is important for CRY1 action. To examine this possibility, we prepared bait vectors expressing the CNT1 mutants [CNT1-305, containing an A462V mutation corresponding to the previously described cry1-305 allele; CNT1-375, containing a G347R mutation corresponding to six cry1 alleles (cry1-375.1, -375.2, -375.3, -375.4, hy4-15, and hy4-16); and CNT1-388, containing an S66N mutation corresponding to the cry1-388 allele (CITATION; CITATION)] (Figure 5A). Protein gel blot analysis of extracts from yeast cells coexpressing CRY1 and any one of the CNT1 mutants demonstrated that all of the CNT1 mutants were expressed at a similar protein level (data not shown). Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that all of these point mutations abolished CNT1–CRY1 interaction (Figure 5B, samples 8 to10). Therefore, these results indicate that loss of CRY1 function in these cry1 mutant alleles might be attributable to a lack of CRY1 dimerization. [[FIGURE]] To further determine the relationship between the structure of CNT1 and CRY1 function, we first prepared vectors expressing CCT1 fused to CNT1 deletion fragments (Figure 6A, constructs 5 and 6) and overexpressed them in the cry1 mutant background. None of these transgenic lines showed enhanced blue light responses (Figure 6C, seedlings 5 and 6). Protein gel blot analysis using antibody against CCT1 indicated that the deletions within CNT1 did not affect the expression level of the truncated CRY1 proteins (Figure 7B). We then prepared constructs expressing Myc-tagged CNT1 mutants (Figure 6A, constructs 7 to 9) and expressed them in wild-type Arabidopsis. If mutations within CNT1 eliminate CRY1's ability to dimerize in vivo, the corresponding CNT1 mutants would not be able to mediate a dominant-negative effect when expressed in the wild-type background. Indeed, transgenic seedlings overexpressing these CNT1 mutants all displayed a wild-type phenotype under blue light (Figure 6C, seedlings 7 to 9). Protein gel blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody indicated that these point mutations did not affect the expression level of CNT1 proteins (Figures 7A and 7C). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we constructed a vector expressing Myc-tagged full-length CRY1 containing a G347R mutation (Myc-CRY1-375) (Figure 6A, construct 10) and overexpressed it in the cry1 mutant background. We analyzed 40 independent transgenic lines, and none of them showed light responses (Figure 6C, seedling 10). Protein gel blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody indicated that Myc-CRY1-375 was expressed normally (Figure 7A, lanes 6 to 8). In vivo chemical cross-linking studies indicated that Myc-CRY1-375 did not form a homodimer in Arabidopsis seedlings (Figure 4B, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, this result is consistent with CNT1-375 being unable to interact with full-length CRY1 in yeast cells (Figure 5B, sample 9) and supports the novel band with a molecular mass twice as high as that of the CRY1 monomer being CRY1 dimer (Figure 4A). Together, these data demonstrate that CNT1-mediated dimerization is required for CRY1 activity. To extend our findings, we next assessed whether CCT1 is active on fusion with two monomeric proteins. One is GFP and the other is UVR3, an Arabidopsis (6–4) photolyase that shares sequence homology with CNT1 (CITATION). Yeast two-hybrid assays suggested that both GFP and UVR3 were unable to self-associate (Figure 5E, samples 7 and 8), consistent with GFP and photolyases being monomers (CITATION; CITATION). We prepared constructs expressing CCT1 fused to GFP and UVR3 (Figure 6A, constructs 11 and 12) and overexpressed them in the cry1 mutant background. None of these GFP-CCT1 and UVR3-CCT1 lines showed blue light responses (Figure 6C, seedlings 11 and 12). Protein gel blot analysis using antibody to CCT1 indicated that these fusion proteins were expressed normally in transgenic plants (Figure 7D). These results indicate that GFP and photolyase are unable to perform the CNT1 role in activating CCT1. With the demonstrations that dimerization of CNT1 is required for the light activation of CCT1 and that GFP-CCT1 and UVR3-CCT1 are not able to mediate light responses, we entertained the possibility that the COP phenotype observed for transgenic plants expressing the GUS-CCT fusion protein (CITATION) mechanistically involves multimerization of GUS. To test this possibility, we performed the yeast two-hybrid assay and found that GUS indeed interacted strongly with GUS itself (Figure 5E, sample 1). In parallel, we generated transgenic lines expressing GUS-CCT1 in the cry1 mutant background and obtained a COP phenotype in the dark (Figure 6D, top, seedling 13) and enhanced blue light responses (Figure 6D, bottom, seedling 13). Then we showed, by native gel electrophoresis and protein gel blot analysis of protein extracts prepared from transgenic seedlings expressing Myc-GUS and GUS-CCT1 using anti-Myc and anti-CCT1 antibodies, that both Myc-GUS and GUS-CCT1 multimerized in vivo in a light-independent manner (Figures 8A, lanes 1 and 2, 8B, lanes 1 and 2, and 8C). [[FIGURE]] In an attempt to map the domains within GUS that are required for interaction with GUS, we prepared bait constructs corresponding to a series of GUS deletion fragments (Figure 5C). Protein gel blot analysis, conducted on extracts from yeast cells coexpressing GUS and any one of these deletion fragments, demonstrated that all of the GUS fragments were expressed at a similar protein level (data not shown). Unexpectedly, all deletion fragments failed to show an interaction with GUS (Figure 5E, samples 2 to 6). To examine whether multimerization of GUS is necessary to mediate a COP phenotype on fusion with CCT1, we prepared constructs expressing CCT1 joined to the GUS deletion fragments (Figure 6B, constructs 14 and 15) and overexpressed them in the cry1 mutant background. None of the transgenic seedlings expressing these truncated GUS-CCT1 fusion proteins showed either a COP phenotype in the dark (Figure 6D, top, seedlings 14 and 15) or enhanced blue light responses (Figure 6D, bottom, seedlings 14 and 15). Protein gel blot analysis using antibody against CCT1 indicated that these truncated fusion proteins were expressed normally (Figure 7E). Furthermore, native gel electrophoresis and protein gel blot analysis of the protein extracts prepared from these transgenic plants indicated that the truncated GUS-CCT1 fusion protein was a monomer (Figures 8B, lanes 3 and 4, and 8C). Therefore, the multimerization property of GUS is required to activate CCT1 on fusion to CCT1. In contrast to GUS-CCT1 plants, transgenic seedlings overexpressing full-length CRY1 are fully etiolated in darkness (CITATION, CITATION). It was postulated that CNT represses CCT activity in the dark and that the removal of CNT thus relieves its repression and results in constitutive light activation of CCT (CITATION; CITATION). However, the absence of a COP phenotype observed for plants expressing the various truncated GUS-CCT1 and GFP-CCT1 fusion proteins argued against this hypothesis (Figure 6, Table 1). Therefore, we proposed that CNT1 in the dark simply does not have activity and that the role of CNT1 likely positively regulates CCT1 activity in response to light. To further test this proposition, we constructed a vector expressing GUS fused to the N terminus of the full-length CRY1 (Figure 6B, construct 16) and overexpressed it in the cry1 mutant background. Indeed, transgenic seedlings expressing GUS-CRY1 showed a COP phenotype in the dark (Figure 6D, top, seedling 16) and enhanced blue light responses (Figure 6D, bottom, seedling 16), similar to those observed for plants expressing GUS-CCT1 fusion protein. By contrast, the COP phenotype was not observed for transgenic plants expressing GFP-CRY1 fusion protein and missense CRY1 mutants fused to GUS [GUS-CRY1-10 (R576K), -19 (E515K), and -20 (E531K), corresponding to the previously described cry1 mutant alleles (CITATION)] (data not shown), indicating that the COP phenotype observed for plants expressing GUS-CRY1 is physiologically meaningful. Similar to GUS-CCT1, GUS-CRY1 was shown to multimerize in vivo (Figures 8B, lanes 5 and 6, and 8C). Therefore, these combined data suggest that GUS is fully capable of constitutively activating CCT1 in the presence of CNT1 and that the role of CNT1 is essentially to activate CCT1 in response to light.
!~MM~! pLexA bait vectors expressing GUS, Arabidopsis thaliana CNT1 and CCT1, and Arabidopsis CCT2 were made previously (CITATION). The PCR-amplified fragments of Arabidopsis CNT2, six CNT1 deletion fragments [CNT1Δ244-489 (lacking amino acids 244 to 489), CNT1Δ1-243 (lacking amino acids 1 to 243), CNT1Δ401-489 (lacking amino acids 401 to 489), CNT1Δ1-99 (lacking amino acids 1 to 99), CNT1Δ1-49Δ451-489 (lacking amino acids 1 to 49 and 451 to 489), and CNT1Δ1-121Δ370-489 (lacking amino acids 1 to 121 and 370 to 489)], five GUS deletion fragments [GUSΔ201-603 (lacking amino acids 201 to 603), GUSΔ1-200 (lacking amino acids 1 to 200), GUSΔ402-603 (lacking amino acids 402 to 603), GUSΔ1-401 (lacking amino acids 1 to 401), and GUSΔ1-99Δ501-603 (lacking amino acids 1 to 99 and 501 to 603)], GFP, and UVR3 were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pLexA. The bait constructs expressing CNT1 mutants (CNT1-305, containing an A462V mutation; CNT1-375, containing a G347R mutation; and CNT1-388, containing an S66N mutation) were made with the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) in vitro mutagenesis kit using pLexA-CNT1 as template. All of the constructs used were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PCR-amplified fragments of GUS and Arabidopsis CRY1, CNT1, CCT1, CRY2, CNT2, GFP, and UVR3 were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the prey vector pJG4-5. Yeast transformation and the calculation of relative β-galactosidase activities were as described previously (CITATION). The expression of LexA and B42 transcriptional activation domain fusion proteins was detected by gel blot analysis using antibodies against LexA and hemagglutinin. Ten clones for each combination of prey and bait constructs were taken randomly and analyzed to generate the data in Figures 2C, 5B, and 5E. For all of the two-hybrid experiments described in Figures 2C, 5B, and 5E, the yeast cells were grown under standard laboratory lighting conditions. The plate assay shown in Figure 2D was performed according to the user manual for the Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, the yeast cells were inoculated on induction synthetic defined plates containing 20 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown at 30°C either in darkness or under blue light (25 μmol·s−1·m−2) for 15 h, and photographed. Full-length CRY1 and CRY2 were amplified by PCR, digested with SpeI, and then fused to the C terminus of GST in pESP2. Plasmid transformation, induction of expression, and purification of the fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the ESP Yeast Protein Expression and Purification System in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Stratagene). The absorption spectra and the contents of the purified GST-CRY1 and GST-CRY2 fusion proteins were measured with a Beckman Instruments (Fullerton, CA) DU-640 nucleic acid and protein analyzer. CRY1, CNT1, CCT1, CRY2, CNT2, and CCT2 polypeptides were synthesized and labeled with [35S]Met in the TNT T7 Quick for PCR DNA transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Five micrograms of GST, GST-CRY1, and GST-CRY2 proteins were incubated separately with 15 μL of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) in 300 μL of binding buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mM DTT] containing 1 × complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 4°C for 1 h, and then the beads were washed three times with 1 mL of binding buffer. Five microliters of radiolabeled prey proteins was then added and incubated in a 300-μL reaction on a rotating shaker at 4°C overnight in the dark or under blue light (30 μmol·s−1·m−2). After centrifugation, the beads were pelleted and washed four times with the ice-cold binding buffer described above. The washed pellet was resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. pKYL71-GUS-CCT1 was made previously (CITATION). The 6×Myc tag was cloned into XhoI and PstI sites of pBluescript SK+ (pBS; Stratagene). PCR-amplified fragments of CNT1 and CRY1 were cloned into EcoRI and SacI sites of pBS-6×Myc, and the resulting constructs (pBS-Myc-CNT1 and pBS-Myc-CRY1) were used as templates to make the pBS constructs containing Myc-tagged CNT1 and CRY1 mutants (Myc-CNT1-305, Myc-CNT1-375, Myc-CNT1-388, and Myc-CRY1-375) with the Stratagene in vitro mutagenesis kit. The PCR-amplified GUS fragment was cloned into SpeI and SacI sites of pBS-6×Myc. To make pBS-GUS-CRY1, the PCR-amplified GUS fragment was first cloned into EcoRI and SpeI sites of pBS, and then the PCR-amplified CRY1 fragment was cloned into SpeI and SacI sites of pBS-GUS. The PCR-amplified CCT1 fragment was cloned into SpeI and SacI sites of pBS. The PCR-amplified fragments encoding CNT1Δ401-489, GUSΔ402-603, and GFP were cloned into XhoI and SpeI sites of pBS-CCT1. The PCR-amplified UVR3 fragment was cloned into XhoI and XbaI sites of pBS-CCT1. The PCR-amplified fragments encoding full-length CRY1, CNT1Δ1-99-CCT1, and GUSΔ1-200-CCT1 were cloned into XhoI and SacI sites of pBS. After confirmation by sequencing, the fragments encoding Myc-CNT1, Myc-GUS, Myc-CRY1, CRY1, CNT1Δ401-489-CCT1, CNT1Δ1-99-CCT1, Myc-CRY1-375, Myc-CNT1-305, Myc-CNT1-375, Myc-CNT1-388, GUSΔ402-603-CCT1, GUSΔ1-200-CCT1, GUS-CRY1, CRY1-GUS, GFP-CCT1, and UVR3-CCT1 were excised with XhoI and SacI and cloned into pKYL71. All constructs were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. The in planta method was used to conduct transformation of Arabidopsis, Columbia ecotype (CITATION). The cry1 mutant used in this study was hy4-104 (CITATION). T1 seeds were screened on 15-cm MS plates supplemented with 100 mg/L kanamycin under blue light (20 μmol·s−1·m−2), and blue light responses of the T2 seedlings expressing each construct were initially evaluated on 200 to 300 independent transformants. Then, 30 to 50 independent T2 lines expressing each transgene were transferred to soil, and protein gel blot analysis was performed on 8 to 16 independent transgenic lines. Homozygous T4 seeds were used for final analyses. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach and were put in a 4°C refrigerator for 3 to 5 d, induced for germination in white light for 24 h, and finally transferred to the dark and continuous blue light (20 μmol·s−1·m−2). The PCR-amplified fragments encoding CCT1 (amino acids 490 to 681) of Arabidopsis CRY1 and the full-length Arabidopsis CUL1 were cloned into pET-21a(+). These vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was induced with 1 M isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C, and fusion proteins were purified using a nickel affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified proteins were further purified by SDS-PAGE and dialysis. Rabbits or mice were immunized, and the CCT1 and CUL1 antisera were analyzed by protein gel blot using protein extracts prepared from the cry1 and fus6-1 mutant plants, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies against LexA, hemagglutinin, and Myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein gel blot analysis was performed as described previously with minor modifications (CITATION). Approximately 50 μg of total protein, determined with the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), was fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gel and blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham). The blots were probed with the primary antibodies [diluted in PBST (80 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20)], washed in PBST three times, reacted with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:4000 to 1:5000; Amersham), washed, and exposed to x-ray film using the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). The same blot sometimes was reprobed with different antibodies. The exposure time for enhanced chemiluminescence of different immunoblots was not controlled precisely, so the signal intensities from different immunoblots are not directly comparable. Fifty to 70 7-d-old dark-grown or blue light–grown seedlings were collected, and the total soluble proteins were extracted with the extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 mM PMSF and 1× complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The protein extracts were separated on gels of different acrylamide concentrations (6, 7, 8, and 9%), and the immunoblots were probed with the primary antibodies. The result of the 8% gel is shown in Figures 8A and 8B. The ratio of the native size to the monomeric mass is shown in Figure 8C. The negative slope of 100 (log [RF × 100]) was used to determine the retardation coefficient. The High Molecular Weight Calibration Kit for native electrophoresis was used as a standard (Amersham). Formaldehyde cross-linking was performed as described previously with minor modifications (CITATION). Fifty to 70 7-d-old dark-grown or blue light–grown seedlings or etiolated seedlings exposed to blue light (30 μmol·s−1·m−2) for a period of time (15, 30, and 60 min) were incubated in 600 μL of PBSM buffer (1.76 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 136 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) containing 1% formaldehyde under vacuum for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 5 min. The seedlings were washed with distilled, deionized water, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ground with protein extraction buffer. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc or anti-CCT1 antibody. To generate the TAPa-CRY1– and TAPa-GFP–expressing transgenic lines, the cDNA encoding a full-length version of CRY1 or GFP was amplified by PCR and cloned into pDONR201. The transfer of genes from pDONR201 to pN-TAPa vector (CITATION; CITATION) was performed using the recombination reaction (Gateway; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Both TAPa constructs were transformed into wild-type plants by the floral dip method. T1 seeds were screened on MS plates supplemented with 200 mg/L gentamycin. TAPa-CRY1 seedlings were grown for 4 d under continuous blue light (5 μmol·s−1·m−2) or continuous darkness. Plants were harvested and protein extracts were obtained using buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein extracts (200 μg) were injected onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham). Twenty-four fractions of 0.5 mL were collected. Proteins on each fraction were concentrated using Strataresin (Stratagene), run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and blotted using the anti-CRY1 antibody. TAPa-CRY1– and TAPa-GFP–expressing seedlings (0.4 g fresh weight) grown in complete medium for 4 d in continuous darkness were ground in liquid nitrogen, thawed in 2 volumes of extraction buffer, and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Extracts containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated with 200-μL IgG beads (bed volume; Amersham) for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. After centrifugation at 150g for 3 min at 4°C, the IgG beads were recovered and washed three times with 1 mL of washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once with 1 mL of cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM DTT). Elution from the IgG beads was performed by incubation with 10 μL (20 units) of 3C protease (Prescission protease; Amersham) in 1 mL of cleavage buffer at 4°C with gentle rotation. Elutes were recovered after centrifugation at 150g for 3 min at 4°C, and proteins were concentrated using Strataresin (Stratagene). Protein extracts and immunoprecipitated samples were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Myc and anti-CRY1 antibodies. All experiments involving blue light illumination were performed in an E-30 LED growth chamber (Percival, Boone, IA) using the blue diodes (λmax 469 nm) at 22°C in continuous light unless stated otherwise. Light spectra and fluence rates were measured using a HandHeld spectroradiometer (ASD, Boulder, CO) and a Li250 quantum photometer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE).
