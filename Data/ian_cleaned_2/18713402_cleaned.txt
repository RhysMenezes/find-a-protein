!~ABS~!  Pod shattering is an agronomical trait that is a result of the coordinated action of cell differentiation and separation. In Arabidopsis, pod shattering is controlled by a complex genetic network in which ALCATRAZ (ALC), a member of the basic helix‐loop‐helix family, is critical for cell separation during fruit dehiscence. Herein, we report the identification of ALC‐INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (ACI1) via the yeast two‐hybrid screen. ACI1 encodes a nuclear protein with a lysine‐rich domain and a C‐terminal serine‐rich domain. ACI1 is mainly expressed in the vascular system throughout the plant and mesocarp of the valve in siliques. Our data showed that ACI1 interacts strongly with the N‐terminal portion of ALC in yeast cells and in plant cells in the nucleus as demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Both ACI1 and ALC share an overlapping expression pattern, suggesting that they likely function together in planta. However, no detectable phenotype was found in plants with reduced ACI1 expression by RNA interference technology, suggesting that ACI1 may be redundant. Taken together, these data indicate that ALC may interact with ACI1 and its homologs to control cell separation during fruit dehiscence in Arabidopsis. 
!~RES~! To test whether ALC protein alone is able to drive the reporter expression in the yeast two‐hybrid system, a series of deletion constructs were made using the bait vector, pGBKT7. The results showed that the C‐terminal of ALC is its activation domain, because every construct containing the C‐terminal region (amino acid 141–210) is sufficient to drive the reporter expression. The N‐terminal region (amino acid 1–89) has weak auto‐activating ability, which could be suppressed by the presence of 5 mmol/L 3‐AT in the medium, whereas, the bHLH domain also exhibits auto‐activation even after supplying 10 mmol/L 3‐AT in the medium (summarized in Figure 1A). Therefore, the N‐terminal region of ALC was used as bait to screen the Arabidopsis whole plant cDNA library. Two hundred and seventy clones were obtained after the primary screening of 7.6 × 105 yeast transformants. Among them, 22 clones were reconfirmed in the secondary test. One of these clones, ACI1, was studied in detail because it has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) which means that it may co‐localize with ALC. ACI1 (At5g01370) is predicated to encode a protein of 427 amino acids containing a lysine‐rich domain, a helix‐turn‐helix (HTH) DNA‐binding motif, a nuclear localization signal and eight proline residues in tandem at its N‐terminus (Figures 1B,2B). These suggest that ACI1 may be a transcription regulator. Bioinformatic analysis showed that ACI1 is encoded by a single copy gene and is homologous to At5g58630 in Arabidopsis and two hypothetical proteins, CAN80103 and CAN78823, of Vitis vinifera (Figure 2C). Analysis of the ACI1 promoter showed that there are several cis elements including a TATA box (CCTTATAAATA) at −93 to −83 (Figure 2A), a pyrimidine patch (Y Patch) (TTCTTCTT) at −103 to −96, and two regulatory element groups (REGs) at −167 to −160 (CCCATATA) and at −135 to −128 (GTGGGTCC), respectively (http://ppdb.gene.nagoya‐u.ac.jp). These suggested that ACI1 is a novel nuclear protein whose function remains to be elucidated.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To investigate which domain of ACI1 contributes to the ACI1‐ALC interaction, serial truncations of ACI1 were constructed into pGBKT7 and co‐transformed with the bait vector of the ALC N‐terminus, respectively. Deletion experiments showed that both the lysine‐rich domain and the C‐terminal of ACI1 are able to interact with ALC in yeast cells, but the latter has lower affinity, indicating that ACI1 interacts with ALC via its lysine‐rich domain (Figure 1C).  The BiFC approach (Walter et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2002) was applied to detect the interaction between ACI1 and ALC in vivo. The split yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was brought into close proximity to reconstitute YFP fluorescence by the physical protein‐protein interaction in plant cells. The open reading frame of ALC and ACI1 was fused with N‐terminal YFP and C‐terminal YFP (pUC‐SPYNE and pUC‐SPYCE), to produce ALC‐YFPN and ACI1‐YFPC, respectively. Both plasmids were co‐bombarded into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that the YFP fluorescence was observed inside the nucleus (Figure 1D). But, as controls, the YFP signal was never detected when either ALC‐YFPN combined with pUC‐SPYCE or ACI1‐YFPC combined with pUC‐SPYNE were co‐bombarded into onion epidermal cells (data not shown). This, together with the yeast two‐hybrid assay, demonstrated the physical interaction between ACI1 and ALC.  Computer analysis predicts that a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS: KKKKSENRNDVNGAKKVRW) and a very short nuclear export signal (NES: LIL) are present in ACI1. To investigate whether ACI1 protein is indeed targeted to the nucleus, a construct of ACI1‐EGFP fusion gene driven by the 35S promoter of CaMV was made and transformed into Arabidopsis. The root cells of transgenic plants were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was only detected in the nucleus (Figure 3), indicating that it is a nuclear protein. Therefore, the co‐localization of ACI1 and ALC in the nucleus suggested that ACI1 may act with ALC in the nucleus.  [[FIGURE]] Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) analysis showed that ACI1 is expressed ubiquitously and the transcripts were detected in roots, rosette leaves, stems, flowers, siliques and seedlings (Figure 4A). To further investigate its cellular expression pattern, we also studied promoter activity of the ACI1 gene using the β‐glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system. A PACI1‐GUS‐3′UTR construct was made and introduced into the Arabidopsis plant. Consistent with the RT‐PCR results, the GUS signal was detected in all organs at a variety of developmental stages of transgenic plants (Figure 4). Moreover, strong GUS activity was detected in the vascular bundle in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and siliques (Figure 4D–L). This result is in agreement with those reported by Nakayama et al. in their large scale gene trap experiment (Nakayama et al. 2005).  [[FIGURE]] A previous study showed that ALC was expressed in all organs at all developmental stages (Rajani and Sundaresan 2001). Both ALC and ACI1 were expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons and gynoecium. However, after fertilization, the expression of ALC was confined to the valve of the young silique and then became restricted to the valve margin region (Rajani and Sundaresan 2001; Supplementary Figure S1). While ACI1 was expressed in the valve of pistils just being fertilized, as the silique develops, its expression is confined predominantly to the vascular bundle of the valve (Figure 4I–O). These showed that both ACI1 and ALC expression pattern overlap in the early developmental stage, suggesting that they may function in the same developmental process.  To further verify the expression pattern of ACI1 in siliques at cellular level, RNA in situ hybridization was performed. In transverse sections of young siliques (stage 17) (Smyth et al. 1990) probed with ACI1 antisense RNA probe, a strong hybridization signal were found in the mesocarp of the valve, and no transcripts were detected in the epidermis and the separation zones (Figure 4C). By contrast, no signal was detected when the transverse sections of young siliques was probed with ACI1 sense RNA probe (Figure 4B). This result indicates that ACI1 and ALC may function independently in the late development of silique.  To study the function of ACI1 in vivo, we utilized RNAi interference to knockdown the expression of ACI1 and introduced the construct into the A. thaliana ecotype, Landsberg erecta. Sixty transgenic lines were obtained and some of them showed a reduced expression level revealed by RT‐PCR (Figure 5). In ACI1 RNAi lines where ACI1 expression was downregulated, ALC expression level was elevated. On the contrary, in alc mutant siliques, ACI1 expression level decreased. To our disappointment, no phenotypic defect was observed in these transgenic lines. We further created the double mutant of ACI1 knockdown lines and alc and also did not find any difference from the alc mutant. These data suggest that ACI1 and ALC may function redundantly when involved in fruit dehiscence.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Seed sterilization and growth condition of the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype, Landsberg erecta, were described previously (Ding et al. 2006). Arabidopsis transformation was performed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens‐mediated vacuum infiltration (Bechtold and Pelletier 1998).  Yeast two‐hybrid screening was performed as described previously (Xie et al. 1999; Ding et al. 2006). To create pBD‐ALC, the ALC coding sequence was amplified using the primers ALC‐F (5′‐CGGAATTCATGGGTGATTCTGACGTC‐3′) and ALC‐R (5′‐CGGGATCCCTCAAAGCAGAGTGGCTGT‐3′). The PCR product was cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites (underlined) of pGBKT7. Similarly, the deletion fragments of ALC were amplified using the primers as follows: ALCN (1–89; ALC‐F in combination with P89R 5′‐CGGGATCCCAACGAATTTCTCTGTTTAG‐3′), ALC (90–210; P90‐F 5′‐CGGAATTCAAGAGAAACATTGATGCTC‐3′ in combination with primer ALC‐R), ALC (1–140; primer ALC‐F in combination with P140‐R 5′‐CGGGATCCCCTTCAGATATTCTATAGCTT3′) and ALC (141–210; P141‐F 5′‐CGGGATCCCAGCTTCAACTTCAAGTCCA‐3′ in combination with the primer ALC‐R). To obtain pAD‐ACI1, we amplified the coding region of ACI1 using the primers ACI1‐F1 (5′‐CCATCGATACATGACCCAACGAGCCAAC‐3′) and ACI1‐R2 (5′‐CCGCTCGAGCTAGATACAGAGTTCATC‐3′) and subsequently cloned into ClaI and XhoI sites (underlined) of pGADT7. The ACI1N and ACI1C fragment was amplified using the primers ACI1‐F in combination with ACI1‐R1 (5′‐CCGCTCGAGCCTTCTCCGACGACGAC‐3′) and ACI1‐F2 (5′‐CCATCGATACACTGCGCTTCTAGGAG‐3′) in combination with ACI1‐R2.  The coding region sequence of ALC was amplified with the primers ALC‐NE‐F (5′‐CGGGATCCATGGGTGATTCTGACG‐3′) and ALC‐NE‐R (5′‐GCGTCGACAAGCAGAGTGGCTGT‐GGAAA‐3′) and the PCR product was cloned into pUC‐SPYNE (Walter et al. 2004) in the BamHI and SalI sites (underlined). The open reading frame of ACI1 was also obtained by PCR amplification with the primers ACI1‐CE‐F (5′‐CGGGATCCATGACCCAACGAGCCAAC‐3′) and ACI1‐CE‐R (5′‐GCGTCGACGATACAGAGTTCATCAACTA‐3′) and then the product was cloned into pUC‐SPYCE at the BamHI and SalI sites. The subsequently operation was carried out as described previously (Ding et al. 2006).  The ACI1 coding sequence was amplified with the primers EGFP‐ACI1‐F (5′‐CGGGATCCCATGACCCAACGAGCCAAC‐3′) and EGFP‐ACI1‐R (5′‐GGGGTACCCGGATACAGAGTTC‐ATCAAC‐3′) and inserted into the pEGFP plasmid at the BamHI and KpnI sites. Then, the ACI1‐EGFP fusion fragment was cut by BamHI and XbaI digestion and inserted into the pWM101 (Ding et al. 2006) to yield P35S‐ACI1‐GFP. The P35S‐ACI1‐GFP was transformed into Arabidopsis with Agrobacterium‐mediated transformation. Root cells of the transgenics were viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 META laser scanning microscope with 488 nm Argon2 laser and LP 530 filter.  The isolation of total RNA and RT‐PCR was performed as described previously (Ding et al. 2006). ACTIN2 and eIF4A were used as internal control and amplified using the primer combinations 5′‐GAAGATTAAGGTCGTTGCACCACCTG‐3′/5′‐ATTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGGT‐3′ and 5′‐ATGGCA‐GGACCGCACCGGA‐3′/5′‐GCATGTCAAAAACACGACCGG‐GGGAGTTCC‐3′, respectively. For the ALC and ACI1 amplification, the forenamed primers ALC‐F and ALC‐R, AIP‐F1 and AIP‐R2 were used.  To construct PACI1‐GUS‐3UTR, a 3.258 kb promoter sequence upstream from the ATG and a 1.488 kb 3′‐UTR downstream from the TAG stop codon were amplified with the primers PACI1‐F (5′‐GCGTCGACAGTGGCAAATCTGGTAAT‐3′)/ACI1‐R (5′‐CGGGATCCGGTGATGGCTGATAATGA‐3′), and ACI1 3′UTR‐F (5′‐GGGGTACCTTTAAATTCCCAATTATCAG‐3′)/ACI1 3′UTR‐R (5′‐CGGAATTCGTTCTCATTATTTGTGTTAA‐3′), respectively. The PCR products were then subcloned flanking the β‐glucuronidase (GUS) gene into the pCAMBIA1300. GUS staining was performed according to Ding et al. (2006).  Siliques of A. thaliana ecotype, Landsberg erecta, at stage 17 (Smyth et al. 1990) were fixed and processed according to Yang et al. (1999). For probe labeling, antisense and sense RNAs were transcribed in vitro with T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively, using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche). Hybridization, washing, antibody staining and signal detection were performed according to Shi et al. (2005). The slides were observed under a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) with Nomarski optics and photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera (Nikon, Japan).  A fragment of 285 bp was amplified with the two primers 5′‐AACTGCAG GAGCTCAAATGACGTTAACGGAGCCA‐3′ (PstI and SacI sites underlined) and 5′‐GCGTCGAC GGTACCGTTGCTGTCTCTACTTGCT‐3′ (SalI and KpnI sites underlined) containing two restriction enzymes at their 5′ ends, respectively. Then, the digested fragments were inserted into the modified pCAMBIA1301 which had exchanged the monoclonal sites with pWM101 and inserted an intron of Arabidopsis at the SalI and KpnI sites.
