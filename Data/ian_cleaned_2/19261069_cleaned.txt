!~ABS~!  RNA biogenesis is essential and vital for accurate expression of genes. It is obvious that cells cannot continue normal metabolism when RNA splicing is interfered with. sgt13018 is such a mutant, with partial loss of function of GAMETOPHYTIC FACTOR 1 (GFA1); a gene likely involved in RNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis. The mutant is featured in the phenotype of diminished female gametophyte development at stage FG5 and is associated with the arrest of early embryo development in Arabidopsis. Bioinformatics data showed that homologs of gene GFA1 in yeast and human encode putative U5 snRNP‐specific proteins required for pre‐mRNA splicing. Furthermore, the result of yeast two‐hybrid assay indicated that GFA1 physically interacted with AtBrr2 and AtPrp8, the putative U5 snRNP components, of Arabidopsis. This investigation suggests that GFA1 is involved in mRNA biogenesis through interaction with AtBrr2 and AtPrp8 and functions in megagametogenesis and embryogenesis in plant. 
!~RES~! To understand the molecular mechanisms that control gametophyte and embryo development, we carried out screening of the gene trap lines generated in A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta (Springer et al. 1995; Sundaresan et al. 1995) for mutants with distorted Mendelian segregation and reduced seed set (Feldmann et al. 1997; Drews et al. 1998; Howden et al. 1998). A mutant, sgt13018, showed a nearly 1.46 segregation ratio of kanamycin resistant (KanR) to kanamycin‐sensitive (KanS) seedlings (KanR:KanS= 399:274) in selfed sgt13018 progeny. Also, the seed set of wild‐type and sgt13018 siliques at 7 or 8 d after pollination (dap) was checked. Full seed set was observed in the wild‐type silique (Figure 1A); however, in sgt13018 plants grown under the same conditions as the wild‐type, 569 (34.5%) out of 1 649 ovules were small, shrunken, and aborted (Figure 1B). This indicated that about one‐third of the ovules could not develop into mature seeds in sgt13018 siliques, suggesting that it was a gametophyte‐ and/or embryo‐lethal mutation. To investigate the transmission efficiency of the mutation, reciprocal crosses between sgt13018 and wild‐type plants were carried out. When heterozygous sgt13018 was used as pollen donor to pollinate wild‐type plants, about 43% of the F1 progeny (n= 1 227) showed kanamycin resistance, with a transmission efficiency of 76% through the male. When sgt13018 was used as egg donor, only 37% F1 progeny (n= 1 628) showed kanamycin resistance, indicating a transmission efficiency of 59% through the female. Alexander staining results showed that only 1.8% of pollen grains (n= 1 340) were not viable in the mutant, suggesting that the pollen viability was not affected at anthesis. These data clearly demonstrated that the Ds insertion affected both male and female gametophytes, but much more severely on the female gametophyte.  [[FIGURE]] To investigate the mutant phenotype in the female gametophyte, we carried out confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to study female gametophyte development in wild‐type and sgt13018 plants (Christensen et al. 1998). The female gametogenesis in Arabidopsis is divided into eight morphologically distinct stages (Christensen et al. 1997) (Figure 2A–I). The megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to form a tetrad of haploid megaspores. Shortly, three of the megaspores at the micropylar pole undergo programmed cell death, and the other one at the chalazal end forms the functional megaspore and enters stage FG1 (Figure 2A). The nucleus undergoes mitosis to give rise to a two‐nucleate female gametophyte (FG2, Figure 2B), and then the two nuclei are separated by a prominent central vacuole (FG3, Figure 2C). Female gametophyte of FG3 undergoes a second mitosis to produce a four‐nucleate female gametophyte and starts at stage FG4 (Figure 2D). The eight‐nucleate embryo sac of FG5 is the product of the third round of mitosis and there are four nuclei at both of its poles that are separated by a large vacuole (Figure 2E). Subsequently, nuclear migration and cellularization take place, producing three antipodal cells at the chalazal pole, an egg cell and two synergid cells at the micropylar pole, and a large central cell with two unfused polar nuclei (Late FG5, Figure 2F). Finally the polar nuclei fuse with each other and a diploid primary endosperm nucleus forms (FG6, Figure 2G). In Arabidopsis, the degeneration of antipodals occurs after polar nuclei fusion. At maturity (FG7), the embryo sac is composed of four cells, one egg cell, one central cell and two synergids (Figure 2H). Finally, the pollen tube of the male gametophyte arrives at the micropyle and penetrates into one of the two synergids (FG8, Figure 2I). In wild‐type pistils, ovule development is more or less synchronous with female gametophytes predominately at one or two adjacent developmental stages (Christensen et al. 1997; Shi et al. 2005).  [[FIGURE]]  Sgt13018 flowers at stage 12c were emasculated (Smyth et al. 1990), and the pistils were fixed for CLSM analysis after 24 or 48 h, respectively. At 24 h post emasculation, most of the female gametophytes in the wild‐type pistils were at stage FG7. In sgt13018/+ pistils, among the 292 female gametophytes analyzed, 77% were at stage FG7; however, there were still 14% at the late eight‐nucleate stage (FG5, Figure 2J), and 9% were at the 7‐cell stage (FG6). Because the position of nuclei and the cellularization of the mutant female gametophytes appeared normal, we checked the female gametophytes phenotype a further 48 h after emasculation. All mutant embryo sacs were at stage FG7 similar to the wild‐type, but approximately 14.5% (n= 39) of the ovules displayed a large central cell nucleus with a ring‐like autofluorescence enclosing a fluorescence‐free nucleolus (Figure 2K–L), indicative of active nucleolus. In contrast, the central nucleus of the remaining ovules showed an even fluorescence without visible nucleolus (Figure 2H–I). This indicated that the arrested embryo sac could continue to develop to FG7 although delayed.  To further investigate the developmental synchrony of female gametophytes in the mutant pistils, we carried out a detailed CLSM study on mutant pistils containing female gametophytes from stages FG1 to FG8, according to Christensen et al. (1997). We analyzed 28 sgt13018/+ pistils from three independent inflorescences. The results showed that no morphological abnormality was found up to the FG5 stage in the mutant. Remarkably, the female gametophytes spanned more than two developmental stages from FG5 to FG8, whereas in the wild‐type pistil at the same stage, female gametophytes were either at FG7 or FG8 (Christensen et al. 1997; Shi et al. 2005). Taken together, the results show that the mutation caused a slow progression of the female gametophyte development from FG5 onwards in the sgt13018 pistils, and a delay in embryo sac maturation.  As abnormality of ovule maturation and the central cell may disturb pollen tube guidance (Shimizu and Okada 2000; Chen et al. 2007), we further checked the pollen tube guidance of mutant. Siliques were stained with Aniline blue 2 dap. In the wild‐type, 2.9% of embryo sacs did not attract pollen tube, and about 3.5% of embryo sacs did not attract more than one pollen tube (n= 761). As in the mutant, 2.5% of embryo sacs did not attract any pollen tube, and 6.0% of embryo sacs attracted two or three pollen tubes (n= 475). These data imply that the mutation did not affect pollen tube guidance; the slight increase in multiple pollen tubes is likely a secondary effect of the impaired embryo sac development.  To determine which stage of embryo development is impaired in the mutant, we analyzed ovules from sgt13018 heterozygous siliques by wholemount clearing at approximately 6 dap. In 595 ovules from sgt13018/+ siliques observed, 387 contained embryos at globular/heart stages (Figure 3A), similar to those from same‐aged siliques of the wild‐type plants. Of the remaining 208 ovules, 97 ovules were arrested at the stage FG7 and no embryo was present, 45 were at the stage of zygote (Figure 3B), 44 at the single‐cell embryo stage (Figure 3C), and eight at two‐ to the 8‐cell stage (Figure 3D–F). Moreover, aberrant cell divisions (about 7%, n= 14) were also observed in the mutant embryos (Figure 3G–I). Furthermore, we investigated the phenotype of embryo development with CLSM. In wild‐type plants, when the embryo was at the elongated zygote or single‐cell stage, the endosperm nuclei completed the third or fourth syncytial mitosis, which resulted in 12–16 endosperm nuclei, as reported previously (Boisnard‐Lorig et al. 2001), whereas the mutant embryos were retarded at zygote stage and the endosperm nuclei only divided once or twice. These results indicated that early embryogenesis was also affected.  [[FIGURE]] To identify the gene disrupted in the mutant sgt13018, thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to obtain the genomic flanking sequences of the Ds element (Liu et al. 1995; Grossniklaus et al. 1998). Sequence analysis indicated that the Ds was integrated into the first intron of At1g06220, and located at 192 bp upstream of the start codon ATG. An 8 base pair (bp) duplication was found at the insertion site (Figure 4A). Southern hybridization with a Ds‐5′‐specific probe showed that a single Ds element was inserted into the mutant genome (data not shown). Analysis of more than 100 sgt13018 mutants indicated that the kanamycin resistance is co‐segregated with Ds insert and the phenotype.  [[FIGURE]] Recently, At1g06220 has been named as GFA1, and loss‐of‐function of GFA1 results in female gametophyte with abnormal nuclei number and cellular structures (Feldmann et al. 1997; Coury et al. 2007). To determine whether the phenotype of sgt13018 is due to the disruption of GFA1, complementation experiment was carried out. A 7.1 kb genomic fragment containing the predicted promoter, open reading frame (ORF), and 3′ untranslated region of the GFA1 gene was cloned into pCAMBIA1300 and transformed into heterozygous sgt13018. Seven independent transgenic lines were obtained via hygromycin and kanamycin double selection. T2 progeny from those seven lines were germinated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium plates supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and the ratio of KanR to KanS was approximately 2.42–2.81:1, (n= 2 651) which was 1.46:1 in the selfed mutant progeny. In addition, two transgenic T3 plants homozygous for the sgt13018 allele and the transgene were obtained, and they all showed full seed set. It proved that the phenotype of sgt13018 was caused by the disruption of At1g06220 indeed. Furthermore, it showed that the 7.1 kb genomic fragment covers the full function of this gene.  Why then did sgt13018 not phenocopy gfa1‐1, since the same gene, GFA1, was disrupted in both mutants? The gfa1‐1 is a mutant with T‐DNA inserted in the fifth intron of GFA1, whereas in sgt13018, the Ds element was inserted into the first intron upstream of ATG. As shown in Figure 5, GFA1 mRNA containing the Ds element was amplified out with primers of Ds5′ and GFA1 specific primer, and it implies that sgt13018 may be a mutant of a partial loss of function.  [[FIGURE]]  GFA1 encodes a putative protein of 987 amino acids with an estimated pI of 4.98 and a molecular mass of 110.4 kDa. GFA1 is of high similarity to a U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, which is required for mRNA splicing in yeast and human. BLAST results showed that gene At5g25230, or GFL (Coury et al. 2007), is a homologous gene of GFA1 in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GFA1 shared high homology with several proteins from Oryza sativa, Xenopus laevis, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, and S. cerevisiae. These proteins can be divided into two large families. One is the EF‐2 family, which has four typical EF2 domains (GTP EFTu, GTP EFTu D2, EFG IV, EFG C) and associates with the translation process. The other family includes the homologous proteins of Snu114p/U5–116kD, which are involved in mRNA splicing and contain a domain rich of acidic hydrophobic residues at the N terminal, besides four typical EF2 domains (Figure 4B).  It was reported that the interaction between distinct domains of the U5 proteins Prp8, Brr2 and Snu114p plays a key role in the catalytic activation of the spliceosome. In human, the interaction of full length U5–116kD and the C‐terminal domain of hPrp8, and the second helicase domain of hBrr2 were detected with a yeast two‐hybrid system (Liu et al. 2006). Three Brr2 genes, AtBrr2a (At1g20960), AtBrr2b (At2g42270), and AtBrr2c (At5g61140), and two Prp8 homologous genes, AtPrp8a (At1g80070) and AtPrp8b (At4g3878) were identified through a global search of the Arabidopsis genome. The Arabidopsis Brr2 proteins are homologous to human Brr2 with 33% to 37% identity and over 41% similarity. The putative Arabidopsis Prp8 and human Prp8 proteins also share 60% identity.  To investigate whether a similar U5 snRNP complex is present in Arabidopsis, the GFA1 expression pattern was analyzed. Previous results of real‐time PCR and Promoter‐ β‐glucuronidase (GUS) staining showed that GFA1 is widely expressed during the plant life cycle (Coury et al. 2007). Here, examination of the GUS reporter gene carried by the Ds (Sundaresan et al. 1995) insert and reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR indicated that GFA1 is strongly expressed both in the female gametophyte and the early embryo development stage (data not shown), which is consistent with its function. No specific RNA probe was available for in situ hybridization because of very high similarity shared by GFA1 and GFL in the coding region and their 5′ UTR in Arabidopsis. We detected the expression pattern of these two genes with the sequence of GFA1 N‐terminal as an RNA probe. The signal is present at different stages during female gametophyte and embryo development (Figure 6).  [[FIGURE]] We compared the correlation of the expression pattern between GFA1 and AtBrr2, AtPrp8 using GENEVESTIGATOR microarray data set (http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) (Zimmermann et al. 2004). The results showed high correlation of the expression profiles between GFA1 and AtBrr2a (At1g20960), AtPrp8a (At1g8007) (Figure 7A), and low correlation between GFA1 and AtBrr2b (At2g42270), AtBrr2c (At5g61140), AtPrp8b (At4g38780) (data not shown). In addition, AtBrr2a encodes a putative protein of 1 217 amino acids with a molecular mass of 224.1 kDa, and its mutation emb1507 caused the embryo lethal phenotype (Tzafrir et al. 2004). AtPrp8a encodes a putative protein of 2 383 amino acids with a molecular mass of 278.1 kDa, and plays a role in early embryogenesis (Schwartz et al. 1994; Tzafrir et al. 2004).  [[FIGURE]] Previous study on humans suggested that hSnu114p interacts with the N‐terminal of hPrp8 and the second DExH domain of hBrr2, and forms protein complex (Liu et al. 2006). Yeast two‐hybrid assay was applied to test whether the similar protein–protein interactions are present between components of the U5 snRNP complex in Arabidopsis. The full length GFA1 coding sequence was cloned into pGBKT7 and fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as “bait”. Since it was reported that the full length protein was too large for the two‐hybrid assay (van Nues and Beggs 2001; Liu et al. 2006), truncated AtPrp8a and AtBrr2a were used as “prey” in our assay (Figure 7B). Yeast cells co‐transformed with the bait pBD‐GFA1 and the prey pAD‐AtPrp8aF or pAD‐AtBrr2aF grew well on minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and adenine (SD/‐Trp‐Leu‐His‐Ade) (Figure 7C,D), indicating that GFA1 physically interacts with AtPrp8a and AtBrr2a in yeast cells. Taken together, the spatial and temporal expression pattern and physical interaction with AtBrr2 and AtPrp8 in yeast suggest that GFA1 is a component of the U5 snRNP complex involved in pre‐mRNA splicing in Arabidopsis. 
!~MM~!  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta was grown under a 16:8 h light : dark cycle at 22 ± 2 ˚C in a green house. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach and 70% ethanol for 5 min, rinsed five times with sterile water and finally plated on MS plates as required with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and/or 20 μg/mL hygromycin. Arabidopsis was transformed via the Agrobacterium‐mediated infiltration method (Bechtold and Pelletier 1998).  The genetic screen of sgt13018 from Ds insertion lines was conducted as reported earlier (Shi et al. 2005). Thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL‐PCR) was carried out to isolate genomic sequences flanking the Ds according to previous reports (Liu et al. 1995; Grossniklaus et al. 1998). The copy number of the Ds insertion was detected by DNA gel blot hybridization using a 750‐bp fragment of Ds‐5′ element as probe. Primers P‐5′‐con: (5′‐ACATTGGAACCGCCTTGATTGAT‐3′) and P‐Ds5‐4: (5′‐TACGATAACGGTCGGTACGG‐3′) were used for linkage analysis.  The confocal observation of ovules was carried out according to the method described previously (Christensen et al. 1997; Shi et al. 2005). Inflorescence and pistils were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde in 12.5 mM cocadylate (pH 6.9) for 30 min under vacuum, and then kept in fixative overnight at room temperature. After fixation, the tissue was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. After dehydration, the tissue was cleared in 2:1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate:benzyl alcohol for at least 1 h. Ovules were dissected with hypodermic needles, mounted in immersion oil, and finally examined with a Zeiss LSM510 META laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) with a 488 nm argon laser and an LP530 filter. To determine embryo phenotype, siliques from mutant and wild‐type plants were dissected and cleared in Herr's solution (Herr 1971; Ding et al. 2006), and embryos were studied microscopically with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope. To investigate the pollen tube guidance, siliques after 2 d pollination were fixed in Lavdowsky's formalin‐acidic acid‐alcohol (FAA) solution, and stained with 0.1% Aniline blue as described previously (Chen et al. 2007).  A 7.1‐kb GFA1 genomic fragment, from −1 592 bp upstream of the ATG start codon to 1 427 bp downstream of the TGA stop codon, was amplified by PCR using LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Shigo, Japan) with primer P‐full‐up (5′‐TCAACCCGGGGAAGCAGGCCGTGAAAATAGAACT‐3′) and primer P‐full‐down (5′‐GTACCCCGGGCAGGACCAAACAAACCCATAACTT‐3′). The PCR fragment was verified by sequencing and subcloned into pCAMBIA1300 at SmaI sites.  The homologous sequences from different organisms were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with BLASTP. Multiple sequence alignments were produced with the ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html). Mega 2.1 software used with the neighbor‐joining method was used to generate the phylogenetic tree.  Total RNA was isolated from Landsberg erecta plants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and digested with RNase‐free DNase (TaKaRa). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase XL (TaKaRa). For GFA1 amplification, the primer P‐S (5′‐GTTCCGATGGCGAACAAGG‐3′) and P‐5′‐con were used. Primers P‐Ds5‐4 and P‐5′‐con were used to detect the GFA1 mRNA containing Ds element (GFA1D). Similarly, the primer combination 5′‐ATGGCAGGACCGCACCGGA‐3′ and 5′‐GCATGTCAAAAACACGACCGGGAGTTC‐3′ was used for RT‐PCR amplification of the EIF4A gene as an internal control. After 36 or 28 cycles of amplification, PCR products were analyzed with 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.  RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (Shi et al. 2005; Ding et al. 2006). For probe labeling, a 593‐bp GFA1 cDNA fragment was amplified using primer P1 (5′‐ATGGAAAGTAGCTTGTATGATGAG‐3′) in combination with primer P5′‐con and cloned into pGEMT‐easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to produce pT‐GFA1P. pT‐GFA1P was linearized by Nco I and Sal I, respectively. Sense and antisense GFA1 probes were transcribed in vitro with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), respectively. Inflorescence was fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and dehydrated through conventional ethanol series and embedded in paraplast (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (Yang et al. 1999). Sections (7–10 μm thick) were made with a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) microtome and dewaxed with xylene. In situ hybridization and signal detection were carried out according to previous reports (Shi et al. 2005; Ding et al. 2006). The images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop version 7.  To create pBD‐GFA1, the ORF of GFA1 was amplified by PCR using the primer P‐BD‐Bam‐up (5′‐CGGGATCCGTATGGAAAGTAGCTTGTATGATGAG‐3′) and primer P‐BD‐Bam‐low (5′‐CGGGATCCTCAAATCATCTGCAGATGGAGATCG‐3′). The PCR product was digested by BamHI, and cloned into the pGBKT7 in the correct direction. The cDNA fragment of AtPrp8a (At1g80070) was amplified using the primer P‐AD‐AtPrp8a(2075–2383)EcoR‐up (5′‐CGGAATTCATTGAGAAACAGGCAAAGGAAGCC‐3′) and primer P‐AD‐AtPrp8a(2075–2383) Sma‐down (5′‐TCCCCCGGGTCAAGTAAATGTGTCCTCGCGATCTCC‐3′). The fragment was cloned into the pGADT7 at EcoRI and SmaI sites, giving rise to plasmid pAD‐Atprp8aF. The coding sequence of the second helicase domain of AtBrr2a (At1g20960) was amplified using primer P‐AD‐AtBrr2a(1350–1861) EcoR‐up (5′‐CGGAATTCCATTTCAATCCAGTGCAGACTCAGGT‐3′) in combination with primer P‐AD‐AtBrr2a(1350–1861) Xho‐down (5′‐CCGCTCGAGTCAAACCAGCTCTGATAGGTGATCAG‐3′). The fragment was then cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGADT7 for pAD‐AtBrr2aF. Yeast transformation was carried out according to Xie et al. (1999). The transformed cells were plated on minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and adenine (SD/‐Trp‐Leu‐His‐Ade) for positive colonies, and were incubated at 30˚C for 4 d.  Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative database under accession numbers: At1g06220 (GFA1), At5g25230 (GFL), At1g20960 (AtBrr2a), At2g42270 (AtBrr2b), At5g61140 (AtBrr2c), At1g80070 (AtPrp8a), At4g38780 (AtPrp8b).
