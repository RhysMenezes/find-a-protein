!~ABS~!  The phytochrome family of red/far-red photoreceptors is involved in the regulation of a wide range of developmental responses in plants. The Arabidopsis genome contains five phytochromes (phyA–E), among which phyA and phyB play the most important roles. Phytochromes localize to the cytosol in the dark and accumulate in the nucleus under light conditions, inducing specific phytochrome-mediated responses. Light-regulated nuclear accumulation of the phytochrome photoreceptors is therefore considered a key regulatory step of these pathways. In fact, one of the most severe phyA signaling mutants, fhy1 ( far red elongated hypocotyl 1 ), is strongly affected in nuclear accumulation of phyA. The fhy1 fhl ( fhy1 like ) double mutant, lacking both FHY1 and its only close homolog FHL, is virtually blind to far-red light like phyA null seedlings. Here we show that FHL accounts for residual amounts of phyA in the nucleus in a fhy1 background and that nuclear accumulation of phyA is completely inhibited in an fhy1 FHL RNAi knock-down line. Moreover, we demonstrate that FHL and phyA interact with each other in a light-dependent manner and that they co-localize in light-induced nuclear speckles. We also identify a phyA-binding site at the C-terminus of FHY1 and FHL, and show that the N-terminal 406 amino acids of phyA are sufficient for the interaction with FHY1/FHL. 
!~RES~!  Expression of FHL in the fhy1 background complements the mutant phenotype and confers phyA-dependent hypersensitivity to far-red light (Zhou et al. CITATION ). Moreover, the fhy1 fhl double mutant and fhy1 FHL RNAi knock-down lines exhibit a phyA null phenotype, and FHY1 and FHL act redundantly to control phyA-regulated gene expression ( Fig. 1 A and Supplementary Fig. 1) (Zhou et al. CITATION ). Previously we have shown that FHY1 plays a key role in nuclear accumulation of phyA, and that fhy1 mutant seedlings are unable to accumulate wild-type levels of phyA in the nucleus in response to VLFR and HIR treatments (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ). PhyA nuclear accumulation is, however, not completely inhibited in the fhy1 background, suggesting that FHL may be sufficient to allow accumulation of residual amounts of phyA in the nucleus in the absence of FHY1. Thus, FHY1 and FHL may act together to mediate phyA nuclear accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we transformed an FHL RNAi construct, similar to that described by Zhou et al. ( CITATION ), into phyA-211 fhy1-1 plants expressing the PHYA promoter-driven phyA–green fluorescent protein (GFP). Irrespective of the light treatment, phyA–GFP is restricted to the cytosol in fhy1-1 FHL RNAi knock-down lines and does not accumulate to detectable levels in the nucleus ( Fig. 1 B), confirming that residual nuclear accumulation of phyA in the fhy1-1 background is due to FHL. Immunoblot analysis using a GFP-specific antibody shows that the levels of phyA–GFP are identical or at least very similar in a FHY1, fhy1-1 and fhy1-1 FHL RNAi background (Supplementary Fig. 2).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  Previously it has been reported that the fhy1-1 mutant contains wild-type levels of photoreversible phytochrome (Whitelam et al. CITATION ), suggesting that reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition in the fhy1-1 and probably also in the fhy1-1 FHL RNAi background is not due to reduced amounts of hyA. Western blot analysis clearly shows that the fhy1-1 mutant as well as two independent fhy1-1 FHL RNAi lines contain phyA levels similar to the wild type ( Fig. 1 C). As the long hypocotyl phenotype of fhy1-1 and fhy1-1 FHL RNAi seedlings is specific to far-red light, it can hardly be attributed to diminished availability of phytochromobilin, the chromophore of plant phytochromes. Reduced phytochromobilin levels would also affect responses mediated by phyB–E such as in the chromophore biosynthesis mutants hy1 and hy2 (Koornneef et al. CITATION , Parks and Quail CITATION ). We nevertheless used fhy1-1 and fhy1-1 FHL RNAi seedlings for in vivo spectroscopy, which confirms that the photoreversibility of phyA does not require FHY1 and FHL (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the lack of hypocotyl growth inhibition in fhy1-1 FHL RNAi lines is caused by the mislocalization of phyA, and that nuclear accumulation of phyA is essential to control hypocotyl elongation in far-red light.  fhy1 and fhy1 FHL RNAi seedlings grown in red light do not differ from the wild type regarding hypocotyl length ( Fig. 1 A and Supplementary Fig. 1) (Whitelam et al. CITATION , Desnos et al. CITATION , Zeidler et al. CITATION , Zhou et al. CITATION ). Together with the findings that phyB nuclear accumulation is not affected in a fhy1-1 mutant background (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ) and that nuclear transport of the photoreceptor is an essential step in phyB-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition (Huq et al. CITATION , Matsushita et al. CITATION ), this suggests that FHY1 and FHL may be specifically required for nuclear accumulation of phyA but not phyB. To test this hypothesis, we crossed fhy1-1 plants expressing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter ( 35S promoter)-driven phyB–GFP into the fhy1-1 FHL RNAi background. PhyB nuclear accumulation and speckle formation in response to 6 h irradiation with red light is indistinguishable in wild-type and fhy1-1 FHL RNAi seedlings ( Fig. 2 ). Also the early phyB speckles, which depend on PIF3 and form within a few minutes after a short light pulse (Bauer et al. CITATION ), are detectable in the fhy1-1 FHL RNAi background, suggesting that phyB signaling is not affected in fhy1-1 FHL RNAi seedlings. Thus it seems very unlikely that FHY1 and FHL play a significant role in phyB nuclear accumulation.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  The physiological redundancy as well as the homology between FHY1 and FHL at the amino acid level indicate that they most probably use similar, if not identical, mechanisms to control phyA nuclear accumulation, and in turn hypocotyl growth inhibition. To verify this prediction, we extended our previous studies done for FHY1 (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ) to FHL and analyzed the co-localization and light-dependent interaction of phyA and FHL.   In Arabidopsis plants transformed with a P 35S :YFP-FHL construct, FHL forms light-induced nuclear speckles reminiscent of those described for FHY1 and phyA ( Fig. 3 A) (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ). Transient expression of the same P 35S :YFP-FHL construct and phyA–cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in etiolated mustard seedlings confirms that not only FHY1 but also FHL co-localizes with phyA in these light-dependent speckles ( Fig. 3 B). In dark-grown phyA-201 and fhy1-1 seedlings complemented with P PHYA :PHYA-YFP and P 35S :YFP-FHY1 , respectively, as well as in wild-type plants expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–FHL, a short white light pulse given after 6 h irradiation with far-red light induces rapid formation of nuclear speckles of the YFP fusion proteins ( Fig. 3 A). Irradiation with red light for 6 h followed by a short white light pulse, however, does not induce formation of nuclear FHY1 and FHL speckles and results in complete degradation of phyA ( Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the FHY1 and FHL speckles depend on the presence of phyA. In fact, in phyA-201 seedlings expressing 35S promoter-driven FHY1–GFP or YFP–FHL, no speckles are detectable after 6 h exposure to far-red light followed by a white light pulse ( Fig. 3 C). The finding that FHY1 and FHL depend on phyA for assembly into light-induced nuclear speckles is consistent with the co-localization of FHY1/FHL and phyA in these speckles ( Fig. 3 B).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  Although co-localization is a prerequisite for a physical interaction, it does not necessarily mean that FHL and phyA directly interact with each other as previously shown for FHY1 (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ). We therefore used glutathione S -transferase (GST) pull-down and yeast two-hybrid analysis to test for a physical interaction of FHL and phyA. For photoactivity, phytochromes strictly depend on their chromophore, which is autocatalytically attached to a conserved cysteine residue. However, phycocyanobilin (PCB), the chromophore of cyanobacterial phytochromes, can substitute for phytochromobilin in plant phytochromes (Kami et al. CITATION ). This allows reconstitution of photoactive phyA by supplementing the growth medium in the yeast two-hybrid assay with PCB purified from cyanobacteria or by adding it to in vitro synthesized phyA (Fairchild et al. CITATION , Shimizu-Sato et al. CITATION ). In vitro pull-down analysis confirms that 35 S-labeled photoactive phyA specifically binds to GST-tagged FHL and FHY1 but not to GST alone ( Fig. 4 A). Moreover, both FHL and FHY1 interact predominantly with the biologically active Pfr form of phyA. To corroborate further the light-regulated interaction of FHL and phyA, we employed a yeast two-hybrid-based growth assay. A 5 μl aliquot of yeast culture expressing FHL and phyA fused to the GAL4 activation and DNA-binding domains, respectively, was spotted onto selective plates supplemented with PCB. Growth was strongly dependent on a light treatment resulting in active phyA (Pfr), confirming that FHL and phyA interact with each other in a light-regulated fashion ( Fig. 4 B).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  It seems to be contradictory that far-red light induces nuclear accumulation of phyA in plants, whereas the pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays rather suggest a red light-specific interaction of phyA and FHY1/FHL. Exposure of phyA to far-red light results in about 3% of active phyA (PfrA) that accumulates in the nucleus (Kim et al. CITATION , Nagatani CITATION ). This relatively low amount of active phyA is, however, optimal to induce, under continuous irradiation, a saturating phyA response in planta (Mancinelli CITATION , Nagy and Schäfer CITATION ). Irradiation with red light results in >20 times higher levels of active phyA (Mancinelli CITATION , Nagy and Schäfer CITATION ), suggesting that the in vitro assays are simply not sensitive enough to detect the interaction of FHY1/FHL with the comparably low amount of PfrA obtained after a far-red light treatment. Consistent with this idea, red light-induced nuclear accumulation of phyA is also dependent on FHY1/FHL (data not shown).   FHL and FHY1 behave identically regarding co-localization and light-dependent interaction with phyA. This supports the notion that FHY1 and FHL employ the same molecular mechanism to achieve nuclear accumulation of phyA, and that amino acid residues indispensable for FHY1/FHL function may be conserved. At the sequence level, the homology between FHY1 and FHL is limited to the NLS/NES region and the extreme C-terminus ( Fig. 5 A). Amino acids 186–201 of FHY1 correspond exactly to residues 165–180 of FHL and, among the C-terminal 36 amino acids, >73% are identical in FHY1 and FHL. FHY1 lacking the C-terminal 19 amino acids (FHY1 1–183) does not complement the fhy1 mutant phenotype (Zeidler et al. CITATION ), and C-terminal deletions of FHY1 and FHL (FHY1 1–166 and FHL 1–146) do not form light-induced nuclear speckles in transgenic Arabidopsis lines ( Fig. 5 B), indicating that binding to phyA may depend on the C-terminal 36 amino acids. To test for such a function of the C-terminus of FHY1/FHL, we engineered various FHY1 and FHL deletions, truncated either at the N- or C-terminus ( Fig. 5 A), and subcloned them into a GAL4 activation domain vector for yeast two-hybrid analysis with phyA. None of the FHY1 and FHL deletions lacking the C-terminus interacts with phyA, whereas a C-terminal 36 amino acid fragment of FHY1 (FHY1 167–202) and all other FHY1/FHL versions containing the C-terminal 17 amino acids bind to phyA in a light-regulated fashion ( Fig. 5 C). The interaction between phyA and FHY1/FHL and some of the FHY1 deletions was also tested in a yeast two-hybrid β-galactosidase activity assay which confirms that the C-terminal 36 amino acids of FHY1 are essential and sufficient for light-regulated binding to phyA ( Fig. 5 D).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  To narrow down the region of phyA that interacts with FHY1/FHL, we used different phyA fragments for yeast two-hybrid analysis with FHY1 and FHL. Both FHY1 and FHL interact with the N-terminal half of phyA (phyA 1–617) in a light-dependent manner ( Fig. 6 ). Moreover, even a shorter fragment of phyA (phyA 1–406) is sufficient for light-induced binding to FHY1/FHL, whereas the N-terminal 100 amino acids of phyA do not interact with FHY1/FHL. Thus it seems likely that the FHY1/FHL-binding site in phyA lies between residues 100 and 406, which roughly corresponds to the chromophore lyase domain of phyA (phyA 71–398) (Mathews et al. CITATION , Quail CITATION ). As the C-terminal half of phyA (phyA 563–1122) is strongly transactivating in our system, we cannot rule out the possibility that—although not essential for binding to FHY1/FHL—it may have a regulatory function and stabilize or destabilize the FHY1/FHL–phyA interaction.

Secondly, a 2290 bp phyA promoter fragment containing Eco RI and Bam HI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends (provided by F. Nagy, Plant Biology Institute, Biological Research Center, Szeged, Hungary) was ligated into the Eco RI– Bam HI site of pSV-SPORT I (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), resulting in pSV-SPORT I-pphya.

The PCR fragment was digested with Pst I and Xba I, and ligated into the Pst I– Xba I site of pBS II KS containing the FHL sense fragment. The FHL sense–antisense fragment was then cut with Bam HI and Xba I, and ligated into the Bam HI– Xba I site of pCHF5.  PCR-amplified fragments have been verified by DNA sequencing.

The fhy1-1 P 35S :PHYB-GFP P 35S :FHL RNAi line was obtained by crossing fhy1-1 P 35S :PHYB-GFP plants into the fhy1-1 P 35S :FHL RNAi background.   Transient transformation of mustard seedlings has been described previously (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION , Stolpe et al. CITATION ).   For protein expression, pGEX6P1H 6 -FHY1, pGEX6P1H 6 -FHL and pGEX6P1H 6 were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Expression and purification using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was done according to the supplier's instructions. The in vitro GST pull-down assay was done as described previously (Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ).   The yeast two-hybrid assays were done as described previously (Shimizu-Sato et al. CITATION , Hiltbrunner et al. CITATION ).   Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (Kircher et al. CITATION ). For immunodetection of phyA, an antiserum raised against the N-terminal half of Arabidopsis phyA was used. The GFP-specific antibody has been described previously (Kircher et al. CITATION ).   Seedlings for microscopy, hypocotyl length measurement and protein extraction were grown at 25°C in Petri dishes on four layers of wet filter paper. The seeds were imbibed for 2 d at 8°C in the dark. Germination was induced by 6 h irradiation with red light. For induction of germination and growth in red light, a standard red light field was used (12 μmol m −2 s −1 , 656 nm, 24 nm full width at half-maximum). Standard far-red (13 μmol m −2 s −1 , 730 nm, 128 nm full width at half-maximum) and blue light fields (21 μmol m −2 s −1 , 436 nm, 43 nm full width at half-maximum) were used for all far-red and blue light treatments. The microscope lamp was used for white light pulses prior to microscopy. To confirm that white light and red light pulses have the same effect on speckle formation, we also did the experiments with seedlings irradiated in the red light field. The results were identical irrespective of whether white light or red light was used to induce speckle formation (data not shown). For microscopic analysis, an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with an Axiocam camera system (Zeiss) and GFP-, YFP- and CFP-specific filter sets (AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen, Germany) were used.
