!~ABS~! A subset of WD40 proteins that contain a DWD motif (for DDB1 binding WD40) is reported to act as substrate receptors for DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (for Damaged DNA Binding 1–Cullin 4–Regulator of Cullins 1) based E3 ubiquitin ligases in humans. Here, we report 85 Arabidopsis thaliana and 78 rice (Oryza sativa) proteins containing the conserved 16–amino acid DWD motif. We show by yeast two-hybrid and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation that 11 Arabidopsis DWD proteins directly interact with DDB1 and thus may serve as substrate receptors for the DDB1–CUL4 machinery. We further examine whether the DWD protein PRL1 (for Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1) may act as part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase. PRL1 directly interacts with DDB1, and prl1 and cul4cs mutants exhibited similar phenotypes, including altered responses to a variety of stimuli. Moreover, AKIN10 (for Arabidopsis SNF1 Kinase Homolog 10) was degraded more slowly in cell extracts of prl1 and cul4cs than in cell extracts of the wild type. Thus, both genetic and biochemical analyses support the conclusion that PRL1 is the substrate receptor of a CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-PRL1 E3 ligase involved in the degradation of AKIN10. This work adds a large new family to the current portfolio of plant E3 ubiquitin ligases.
!~RES~! To elucidate the possible roles of DWD proteins in plants, we searched the Arabidopsis and rice genomes for proteins containing this motif (Figure 1A ). Since all DWD motifs are found within WD40 repeats, we first retrieved all annotated Arabidopsis WD40 proteins (Figure 1B) and then searched the WD40 repeats for the DWD motif manually and using the DWD sequence as the pattern input for the MyHits program (http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/pattern_search; CITATION). A detailed description of our search is provided in Supplemental Methods online. In total, 85 putative DWD proteins with 101 DWD domains were found in Arabidopsis (Figure 1C; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Sixty-nine had one DWD domain and 16 had two, consistent with the report that DWD proteins usually possess one and sometimes two but rarely three DWD motifs (CITATION). In addition, 32 of these DWD proteins also had WD40 repeats that showed high similarity to the first 14 amino acids of the DWD motif but lacked the Arg/Lys at position 16 needed to bind DDB1 (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). We designated this additional sequence the DWD▵R(16) domain. Next, we generated a phylogenetic tree for the Arabidopsis DWD motifs using ClustalW in MEGA3.1 (CITATION). To select representative proteins for further studies, the DWD phylogenetic tree was divided into subgroups A1, A2, B, C, and D (Figure 2A ). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We also identified 78 putative DWD proteins and 96 DWD motifs in the O. sativa genome (see Supplemental Methods online for search details). Fourteen rice DWD proteins had two highly conserved DWD motifs, and two rice proteins had three DWD motifs. In addition, 41 rice DWD proteins also contained DWD▵R(16) motifs adjacent to the DWD motifs (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). A phylogenetic tree of putative DWD motifs in rice was generated as in Arabidopsis and divided into subgroups E1, E2, E3, E4, F, and G (Figure 2B). We also searched for Arabidopsis homologs of each rice DWD protein using BLAST and found that for 58 rice DWD proteins, the Arabidopsis protein with the highest similarity (all had >33% identical and 45% similar amino acids) was also a DWD protein, showing that the DWD motif is highly conserved in plants (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Fifteen Arabidopsis and nine rice DWD proteins contained additional conserved domains that might be involved in interacting with substrate proteins (Figure 1B). Arabidopsis At5g67320 and At1g73720 and rice Os07g22220 contain a LisH motif that aids microtubule dimerization and thus helps regulate microtubule dynamics (CITATION). Arabidopsis At4g28450 and rice Os01g13730 have Sof1 domains that are a component of the nucleolar rRNA processing machinery and are therefore essential for cell growth (CITATION). The TPR1 domain, which mediates protein–protein interaction, was detected in Arabidopsis At5g10940. Five Arabidopsis (At4g29380, At2g46340, At3g15354, At1g53090, and At4g11110) and four rice DWD proteins (Os01g52640, Os02g55340, Os05g49590, and Os11g10640) possess the catalytic domain of Ser/Thr protein kinases. Proteins containing two types of E2-dependent ubiquitination-related domains were detected: Arabidopsis At2g33340 and rice Os10g32880 contain the U-box domain, while Arabidopsis At2g32950 and rice Os02g53140 contain the RING domain. Arabidopsis At1g49040 and rice Os01g39380 contain the DENN domain implicated in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (CITATION). Arabidopsis At2g47410 and At5g49430 have a BROMO domain that binds acetylated histones (CITATION), and Arabidopsis At1g61210 contains the BLLF1 domain, which shows homology with the Epstein-Barr virus major glycoprotein, BLLF1 (CITATION). Unlike human DWD proteins, no proteins containing F-box or SOCS domains were detected in either plant (CITATION). The finding of these additional modules is consistent with the hypothesis that the DWD motif binds DDB1 while other portions of the protein may bind substrates. It is therefore surprising that more additional modules were not detected. This may indicate that many DWD proteins bind their substrates with motifs that have not yet been identified. To investigate whether plant DWDs are the substrate receptors for the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ligase machinery, we first tested whether they can bind DDB1. Representative Arabidopsis proteins from each subgroup of the DWD phylogenetic tree were tested for their ability to bind DDB1a by yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 3 ). Although there was some β-galactosidase activity with the empty vector, activity increased at least twofold when DWD proteins were used as prey. Furthermore, β-galactosidase activity was almost abolished when another negative control, green fluorescent protein (GFP), was used as prey. These interactions were confirmed by growth on Leu-deficient media (Figure 3). To test whether the DWD motif was needed to bind DDB1a, we mutated the Arg/Lys-16 of the two DWD motifs of At4g15900 (R290 and R332) to His. β-galactosidase activity using this mutant form as prey was threefold lower than the wild type and similar to that of the empty vector (Figure 3). These data indicate that the selected DWD proteins can bind DDB1 and that this binding requires the DWD motif. [[FIGURE]] To test whether DWD proteins bind DDB1 in planta, transgenic plants overexpressing FLAG-DDB1b in the background of ddb1a (FLAG-DDB1b/ddb1a) were prepared, and interactions between selected DWD proteins and DDB1b were assayed by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies (Figure 4A ). DWD proteins PRL1 (At4g15900), TRIP-1 (At2g46280), and FY (At5g13480) were efficiently retrieved from the DDB1b immunocomplex together with CUL4, a positive control for DDB1 binding, whereas the negative control RPN6, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit 6 (At1g29150, subunit 9 of the 19S proteasome) was not. Moreover, PRL1 was efficiently retrieved from the CUL4 immunocomplex in FLAG-CUL4 transgenic lines, whereas RPN6 was not, showing that PRL1 associates with CUL4 in vivo (Figure 4B). [[FIGURE]] Since antibodies were not available for the other DWD proteins tested in Figure 3, we generated MYC-tagged constructs for the DWD proteins At3g45620, At4g35050, At1g65030, At2g19430, and At4g29830 and transformed them into FLAG-DDB1b/ddb1a lines. As shown in Figure 5 , all of these proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DDB1b, with the exception of At1g04140, which has a motif similar to DWD except that it has Asn rather than Asp at position 14 (WNAK cf WDXR/K). These results confirm that DWD proteins identified by database analysis bind DDB1 in vivo and thus may help mediate interactions between the CUL4–DDB1 complex and its substrates. They also show that interactions between DWD proteins and DDB1 are dependent on the DWD motif. [[FIGURE]] PRL1 is a WD40 protein that has been previously shown to control responses to glucose and several hormones (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since PRL1 (At4g15900) binds DDB1 (Figures 3 and 4A) and CUL4 (Figure 4B), it seems possible that it may serve as a substrate receptor for the DDB1–CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase machinery. This hypothesis predicts that the absence of either PRL1 or CUL4 should have similar effects on PRL1-mediated signaling; therefore, we compared the development of prl1 (CITATION) and cul4cs (CUL4 cosuppression line), which has reduced levels of CUL4 (CITATION). Both 3-d-old cul4cs and prl1 seedlings had smaller cotyledons and more anthocyanin in the aerial parts than the wild type; however, the roots of prl1 were shorter, whereas those of cul4cs were about the same length as the wild type (Figure 6A ). Adult 5-week-old plants of prl1 and cul4cs showed similar stunted phenotypes, including smaller leaves and siliques than the wild type (Figures 6B to 6D). [[FIGURE]] To further test the hypothesis that PRL1 functions as a substrate receptor for a CUL4-based E3 ligase, we compared the effects of sucrose, glucose, abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin, and ethylene on the growth of cul4cs and prl1 seedlings. We confirmed that prl1 is hypersensitive to these regulators, and cul4cs also showed hypersensitivity to many of these signaling molecules. For example, cotyledon growth of both mutants was more inhibited than that of the wild type by the addition of 6% sucrose, 4% glucose, or 0.1 μM ABA (Figures 7A, 7B, and 7D). Similarly, root growth of both mutants was also more strongly inhibited than that of the wild type by these three treatments and by 0.5 μM kinetin (Figure 7F ). However, unlike prl1, we did not detect any differences between wild-type and cul4cs seedlings treated with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) (Figures 7E and 7G). For all treatments, the response of cul4cs was less pronounced than that of prl1, so this lack of response may indicate that the threshold for an effect had not been attained due to the weak nature of the cul4cs line. Alternatively, it may indicate that PRL1 is involved in ethylene signaling via an alternative mechanism that does not involve CUL4. [[FIGURE]] Since it was previously reported that genes regulated by sucrose, ABA, and cytokinin are transcriptionally derepressed in prl1 mutants (CITATION), we next compared the expression of several sugar-, ABA-, and cytokinin-responsive genes in 3-d-old cul4cs, prl1, and wild-type seedlings under normal growth conditions (Figure 8 ). We detected more signal for chalcone synthase (CHS), a glucose-inducible gene, in prl1 and cul4cs compared with the wild type, consistent with the marked accumulation of anthocyanins in these mutants. Similarly, we detected more signal for sucrose synthase (ASUS1), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit (RBCS) in these mutants, in keeping with their hypersensitivity to sugar, ABA, and cytokinin. By contrast, more signal for ACC oxidase 2 (ACO2) was only detected in prl1 seedlings, consistent with the lack of any visible differences between wild-type and cul4cs seedlings treated with ACC. [[FIGURE]] Next, we checked the amounts of PRL1 and CUL4 proteins in 3-d-old prl1 and cul4cs seedlings and confirmed that prl1 mutants had less PRL1 and cul4cs had less CUL4 than the wild type (Figure 9A ). Unexpectedly, there was less PRL1 in cul4cs than in the wild type, whereas the level of CUL4 in prl1 was normal. We therefore checked PRL1 gene expression in cul4cs and did not detect any differences in amounts of PRL1 mRNA in cul4cs and the wild type (Figure 9B). This result shows that the reduced level of PRL1 protein in cul4cs occurs posttranscriptionally and suggests that the maintenance of PRL1 proteins may depend on CUL4. As shown in Figures 7A and 7B, the phenotypic difference between the wild type and cul4cs was alleviated in 7-d-old seedlings compared with 3-d-old seedlings (Figure 6A), although cotyledon growth was still reduced in cul4cs. To check if this alleviation was associated with accumulation of PRL1, we monitored the level of PRL1 in 7-d-old cul4cs seedlings and found that PRL1 expression is comparable in 3- and 7-d-old cul4cs seedlings (Figure 9C). Therefore, the phenotypic differences between wild-type and cul4cs 3-d-old seedlings might reflect effects of reduced CUL4 expression unrelated to the decreased level of PRL1 protein. They might indicate that the action of the CUL4-DDB1-PRL1 complex is more effective in early stages of seedling development. [[FIGURE]] Previous work using yeast two-hybrid assays has shown that PRL1 binds Arabidopsis AKIN10 and AKIN11, two members of the SnRK1 (for Snf1-related protein kinase 1) family of protein kinases involved in metabolic signaling and that PRL1 inhibits their protein kinase activity in vitro (CITATION). Moreover, it was subsequently shown that AKIN10 and AKIN11 interact with SKP1/ASK1 (for S-phase Kinase-associated Protein 1/Arabidopsis SKP1-like 1), a component of the SCF E3 ligase complex and that this interaction was inhibited by PRL1 (CITATION). PRL1 was therefore proposed to compete with SKP1 for binding to the C-terminal regulatory domain of AKIN10 and AKIN11. However, since PRL1 is a DWD protein shown to bind both DDB1 (Figure 4) and AKIN10 and AKIN11 (CITATION), an alternative hypothesis is that PRL1 might regulate the amount of AKIN10 and AKIN11 by tagging them for destruction via the DDB1–CUL4 ubiquitin ligase machinery. Therefore, a cell-free protein degradation assay was performed to examine whether AKIN10 stability was affected by CUL4 and PRL1 levels (Figures 10A and 10B ). His6-AKIN10 was gradually degraded when incubated with total protein extracts of wild-type plants. However, this degradation was blocked by MG132, a proteasome-specific inhibitor, indicating that AKIN10 was destroyed via the 26S proteasome pathway (Figure 10A). By contrast, His6-AKIN10 was degraded more slowly in extracts from prl1 and cul4cs plants (Figure 10B). To confirm that AKIN10 was more stable in prl1 and cul4cs mutants, the endogenous levels of AKIN10 protein were checked in extracts of 3-d-old wild-type, cul4cs, and prl1 using AKIN10-specific antibody (CITATION). As shown in Figure 10C, AKIN10 levels in the wild type were lower than those in cul4cs and prl1 seedlings. Taken together, these data support a conclusion that AKIN10 degradation depends on PRL1 and CUL4 and that AKIN10 degradation is mediated by a CUL4-based E3 ligase that uses PRL1 as a substrate receptor.

!~MM~! The wild type, FLAG-CUL4, and FLAG-DDB1b/ddb1a Arabidopsis thaliana plants used in this study were of the Columbia-0 ecotype. FLAG-DDB1b transgenic lines were generated in the background of ddb1a. The ddb1a T-DNA mutant (SALK_041255) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Stock Center (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). Mutants and transgenic lines are as follows: prl1 (CITATION), cul4cs (CITATION), fy-2 (CITATION), and Flag-TRIP-1 (CITATION). Arabidopsis seedlings were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 5 min, stored at 4°C for 3 to 5 d to break dormancy, and then plated on 1× Murashige and Skoog medium, including 1% sucrose and Gamborg's vitamins in continuous white light (150 μmol·m−2·s−1) at 22°C. To obtain adult plants, 1-week-old seedlings were transferred to soil and grown under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) in a controlled-environment chamber at 22°C. The 101 Arabidopsis and 96 rice (Oryza sativa) DWD motifs were aligned with ClustalW running in MEGA3.1 using the default settings (Gonnet matrix, gap opening penalty 10, gap extension penalty 0.1 for pairwise alignments and 10 and 0.2, respectively, for multiple alignments). A rooted phylogenetic tree based on the midpoint was generated using MEGA3.1 by the neighbor-joining method and the p-distance model (CITATION). Interior branch tests were conducted to assess statistical significance of the phylogenetic trees using 1000 replicates (CITATION; CITATION). Rice gene names are from the TIGR Rice Genome Annotation. For Arabidopsis genes with splice variants, only the representative gene model listed at The Arabidopsis Information Resource was used, and for rice genes with splice variants, only the variant listed as the “Locus Name” at TIGR was used. Total RNA was isolated from 3-d-old wild-type, prl1, and cul4cs seedlings and used for RT-PCR of each gene. Reverse transcription was performed on 5 μg of total RNA at 42°C with oligo(dT) primers using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in 20 μL. PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μL containing 1 μL of the first-strand cDNA reaction products, 10 μM primers, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 200 μM deoxyribonucleotides, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen) with specific forward and reverse primers for ASUS1 (CITATION), ADH (accession number M12196), CHS (CITATION), RBCS (accession number X13611), and ACO2 (CITATION), respectively. Oligonucleotide sequences for the primer pairs used are presented in Supplemental Table 2 online. Twenty-five thermal cycles were performed (30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 60 s at 72°C) in an automatic thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). PCR products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. This assay was performed using RNA from at least two independent biological replicates. Extracts were normalized by the amounts of RT-PCR products with specific primers for RPN6a and ACTIN2 genes. The values of amplicons obtained by RT-PCR analysis were determined with Image Gauge V3.12 software (Fuji). For normalization, the value for each amplicon was first divided by the value for the wild-type amplicon of that specific gene. This normalized value was then divided by the normalized value for the ACTIN2 gene from that sample to correct for variations in amounts of cDNA. Three-day-old light-grown seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in a buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 10 mM NaCl) (CITATION). Then, cell debris were removed by centrifugation. Purified recombinant His6-AKIN10 (500 ng) and cell extracts (10 μg) were mixed in reaction buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM NaCl, and 10 mM ATP) and incubated at 30°C for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× protein gel-loading buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To confirm the equivalence of loaded extracts, tubulin levels in the cell extracts used for each reaction sample were detected with anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoblot analysis, Arabidopsis tissues were homogenized in an extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM DTT, and 1× complete protease inhibitor [Roche]). The extracts were centrifuged twice at 13,000g for 10 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. All samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). These were incubated in blocking buffer (1× PBS buffer including 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried nonfat milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4°C and finally incubated another hour with secondary antibody with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. The proteins were visualized with film using the ECL Plus protein gel blotting detection system (Amersham) after extensive washing with washing solution, and their levels were estimated from the intensity of the bands. The two-hybrid interaction assay in yeast was performed as described previously (CITATION) except that the LexA fusion constructs and the activation domain fusion constructs were cotransformed into yeast strain EGY48 containing p80p-lacZ (Invitrogen). DDB1a was subcloned into pEG202 (Clontech) to make the bait construct, and fragments containing full-length cDNAs of various DWD genes and GFP were subcloned into pJG4-5 (Clontech). Transformants were confirmed by growth on SD/-His/-Trp/-Ura plates. Interactions between DDB1a and DWD proteins were monitored by measuring β-galactosidase enzyme activity after growing yeast strains in liquid culture using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) and confirmed by growth on plates without leucine. Site-directed mutagenesis of At4g15900 (At4g15900m) was performed using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Arabidopsis tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized in protein extraction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× complete cocktail of protease inhibitors [Roche]). The extracts were centrifuged twice at 13,000g for 10 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For coimmunoprecipitation, 5 mg of total proteins were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with 30 μL of monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody immobilized onto agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). The precipitated samples were washed three times with the protein extraction buffer and then eluted twice with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.8. Subsequent immunoblot assays were performed with anti-MYC or various anti-DWD antibodies. The full-length pAKIN10 cDNA clone was introduced into plasmid pET-28c (+) (Novagen) to generate His6-AKIN10 fusion protein. The resulting plasmid was expressed in vitro using the EasyXpress protein synthesis kit (Qiagen). The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni+-NTA resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Full-length cDNAs of various DWD genes were inserted into the corresponding sites of pMYC-fused pCR-BluntII vector. Then, BglII or XhoI fragments containing the inserted cDNA were subcloned into the binary vectors pJIM19 (gentamycin), pJIM19 (basta), or pCAMBIA 1390 (hygromycin), placing the DWD gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The fusion gene constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GB3101 by electroporation, and the resulting Agrobacterium strains were transformed into FLAG-DDB1b/ddb1a transgenic plants by the floral dip method (CITATION). The seeds collected from the plants were selected on 1× Murashige and Skoog plates containing 200 mg L−1 gentamycin, 25 mg L−1 basta, or 50 mg L−1 hygromycin and 1% sucrose to obtain independent T1 transgenic lines. The presence of the transgene was confirmed by PCR with gene-specific primers. The plant locus identifiers investigated in this article correspond to the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative codes for Arabidopsis and the Rice Annotation Project codes for rice: At5g46210 (CUL4), At1g29150 (RPN6a), At4g21100 (DDB1b), At4g05420 (DDB1a), At5g20830 (ASUS1), At5g13930 (CHS), At1g67090 (RBCS), At1g77120 (ADH), and At1g49240 (ACTIN2). Those without corresponding gene names are as follows: At3g27640 and Os03g49200 (CDT2 homologs), At4g02730 and Os07g38430 (WDR5 homologs), At5g15550 and Os07g40930 (WDR12 homologs), At5g66240 and Os07g40030 (WDR82 homologs), At5g58760 and Os01g04870 (DDB2 homologs), and At1g27840 and Os02g20430 (CSA homologs).
