!~ABS~! Uptake of external sulfate from the environment and use of internal vacuolar sulfate pools are two important aspects of the acquisition of sulfur for metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the vacuolar SULTR4-type sulfate transporter facilitates the efflux of sulfate from the vacuoles and plays critical roles in optimizing the internal distribution of sulfate in Arabidopsis thaliana. SULTR4;1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and SULTR4;2-GFP fusion proteins were expressed under the control of their own promoters in transgenic Arabidopsis. The fusion proteins were accumulated specifically in the tonoplast membranes and were localized predominantly in the pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells of roots and hypocotyls. In roots, SULTR4;1 was constantly accumulated regardless of the changes of sulfur conditions, whereas SULTR4;2 became abundant by sulfur limitation. In shoots, both transporters were accumulated by sulfur limitation. Vacuoles isolated from callus of the sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double knockout showed excess accumulation of sulfate, which was substantially decreased by overexpression of SULTR4;1-GFP. In seedlings, the supplied [35S]sulfate was retained in the root tissue of the sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double knockout mutant. Comparison of the double and single knockouts suggested that SULTR4;1 plays a major role and SULTR4;2 has a supplementary function. Overexpression of SULTR4;1-GFP significantly decreased accumulation of [35S]sulfate in the root tissue, complementing the phenotype of the double mutant. These results suggested that SULTR4-type transporters, particularly SULTR4;1, actively mediate the efflux of sulfate from the vacuole lumen into the cytoplasm and influence the capacity for vacuolar storage of sulfate in the root tissue. The efflux function will promote rapid turnover of sulfate from the vacuoles particularly in the vasculature under conditions of low-sulfur supply, which will optimize the symplastic (cytoplasmic) flux of sulfate channeled toward the xylem vessels.
!~RES~! Two distinct tonoplast-localizing sulfate transporters, SULTR4;1 (At5g13550) and SULTR4;2 (At3g12520), have been identified in Arabidopsis (Figure 1). Localization of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 transporters in the tonoplast was determined by expressing gene-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs in Arabidopsis (Figure 1A). GFP was fused in frame to the C terminus of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 and expressed in Arabidopsis under the control of the SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 5′-promoter sequences, respectively. The GFP-tagged proteins accumulated in membranous structures typical of tonoplasts in SULTR4;1-GFP and SULTR4;2-GFP plants (Figure 1). Fluorescence of GFP in the root tips of SULTR4;1-GFP (Figures 1B and 1C) and SULTR4;2-GFP plants (Figure 1D) presented clear views of tonoplast localization. Localization of SULTR4;1-GFP in the tonoplast was confirmed by merging the signals of GFP (Figure 1E) with a red fluorescent dye, FM4-64 (Figure 1F), which translocates to the tonoplast membrane by endocytosis. GFP (Figure 1E) and FM4-64 (Figure 1F) were colocalized in SULTR4;1-GFP plants, providing yellow staining of tonoplasts in the overlaid image (Figure 1G). In addition, GFP in the tonoplast was clearly distinguishable from the endocytotic vesicles (red dots in Figures 1F and 1G) where part of FM4-64 dye localizes during staining. SULTR4;2-GFP plants showed the same results indicating colocalization of the signals of GFP and FM4-64 on the tonoplasts (Figures 1H to 1J). In the shoots, there was specific localization of GFP in the tonoplast of the vascular parenchyma cells of hypocotyls in both plant lines (Figures 1K and 1L). Localization of SULTR4;1-GFP and SULTR4;2-GFP fusion proteins was clearly observed in the tonoplast of other cell types, as presented in Figure 2. These results indicated that SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 are tonoplast-localizing transporters in Arabidopsis. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Previously, the N-terminal region of the Arabidopsis SULTR4;1 sulfate transporter was suggested to encode a chloroplastic transit peptide based on computer predictions and biolistic transformation (CITATION). GFP fused to the N-terminal 99–amino acid residues or GFP replacing the C-terminal 13–amino acid residues of SULTR4;1 did not display tonoplast localization, suggesting an essential region within the C terminus of SULTR4;1 for proper assembly of transporters to the tonoplast membranes. A conserved amino acid sequence, EPLLS, was found in this particular region of SULTR4;1, SULTR4;2, and homologous ESTs from soybean (Glycine max) (accession number BE800569) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (accession number BF003985). Furthermore, pattern matching (http://www.arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl) indicated existence of this sequence within the C- and N-terminal hydrophilic regions of the NHX3 sodium/proton antiporter (At3g06370) (CITATION) and an MRP-like ABC transporter (At3g13090) similar to the AtMRP4 vacuolar-localizing glutathione-conjugate transporter (CITATION; CITATION), respectively. Cell type–specific expression of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 was investigated in SULTR4;1-GFP and SULTR4;2-GFP transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Figure 2) expressing the gene-GFP fusion constructs (Figure 1). Both the SULTR4;1 and the SULTR4;2 promoters resulted in strong expression of the SULTR4;1-GFP and SULTR4;2-GFP fusion proteins, predominantly in the vasculatures of roots and hypocotyls (Figure 2). In SULTR4;1-GFP plants, fluorescence of GFP was detected in roots and hypocotyls (Figure 2A), occurring from the root tip to the basal region. In roots, the SULTR4;1-GFP signal was predominantly present in the pericycle and parenchyma cells of the vascular tissues (Figures 2B and 2C). Epidermis, cortex, and endodermis of the mature part of root showed weak expression; however, the levels were not appreciable compared with those observed in the vascular tissues (Figure 2B). In hypocotyls, SULTR4;1-GFP was expressed strongly in the vasculature (Figures 2D and 2E). The expression of SULTR4;2-GFP was observed predominantly in the mature part of roots, close to the shoot/root junction, and in the hypocotyls (Figure 2). SULTR4;2-GFP plants presented strong fluorescence when grown on a low sulfur medium (see also Figures 3 and 4). In roots, the signals of SULTR4;2-GFP were detected in the pericycles and parenchyma cells within the vascular tissues (Figures 2B and 2C), which resembles the cell-type specificity of SULTR4;1-GFP. Within the hypocotyls, SULTR4;2-GFP was expressed abundantly in the vasculature and epidermis but was expressed also in the cortical cells (Figures 2D and 2E). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The effect of sulfur availability on expression of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 was determined (Figure 3). The mRNA contents of both transporters in Arabidopsis were estimated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. When plants were grown on sulfur-replete medium, both SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 mRNAs were relatively abundant in roots compared with shoots (Figures 3A and 3B). SULTR4;1 was expressed in roots both under sulfur-sufficient and -deficient conditions; however, the mRNA contents in shoots increased upon sulfur limitation (Figure 3A). SULTR4;2 mRNA was highly inducible by sulfur limitation both in shoots and roots (Figure 3B). The response of SULTR4;2 to sulfur limitation was seen also in the GFP fusion gene expression systems (right-hand panel of Figure 4A). Transgenic plants with the gene-GFP fusion constructs (Figure 1) were used for the analysis. The accumulation of transporter-GFP fusion protein in the roots and hypocotyls of SULTR4;2-GFP plants corresponded with the observed patterns of mRNA expression (Figure 3B). Fluorescence of GFP was increased approximately threefold to fivefold in the roots of sulfur-starved plants (−S) compared with the control plants (+S) grown with an adequate sulfur supply (Figure 4B). Three independent transgenic lines with homozygous single T-DNA insertions showed the same response. The SULTR4;1-GFP fusion proteins were accumulated both under +S and −S conditions (left-hand panel of Figure 4A); however, the levels were not remarkably modulated by sulfur limitation in the roots (Figure 4B), as expected from the quantification of mRNA contents in the RT-PCR analysis (Figure 3A). To investigate the function of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 transporters in planta, knockout mutants were isolated from the pools of Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines (Arabidopsis Knockout Facility at the University of Wisconsin Biotech Center, http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/) (CITATION). Mutants were isolated with T-DNAs integrated in the 7th intron of SULTR4;1 and 17th exon of SULTR4;2, respectively (Figure 5A). Homozygous progenies with single T-DNA insertions were selected by PCR and DNA gel blot hybridization analysis. The sultr4;1 and sultr4;2 mutants were crossed, and the double knockout was selected from the F2 population. RT-PCR analysis indicated that SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 mRNAs translatable to functional proteins were not detected in the T-DNA insertion lines (Figure 5B). To confirm the function of SULTR4;1 transporter, SULTR4;1-GFP (Figure 1) was introduced into the sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double mutant by crossing. Two independent lines, #2c and #42a, containing triple homozygous insertions of sultr4;1::T-DNA, sultr4;2::T-DNA, and SULTR4;1-GFP were selected by PCR analysis and GFP imaging as described in Methods. No accumulation of the endogenous SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 transcripts was observed in #2c and #42a plants; however, SULTR4;1-GFP mRNA was expressed from the SULTR4;1-GFP construct (Figure 5B). DNA gel blot hybridization indicated that a single copy of SULTR4;1-GFP was inserted in #2c and #42a plants (data not shown). The SULTR4;1-GFP mRNA in #2c and #42a was expressed approximately threefold higher than the SULTR4;1 mRNA in the wild type (Figure 5B), presumably because of the position effect of the T-DNA insertion sites. In addition, SULTR4;1-GFP was accumulated by sulfur limitation in #2c and #42a plants (Figure 5B), showing approximately threefold to fourfold and 1.5-fold to twofold increase in shoots and roots, respectively. The response of SULTR4;1-GFP mRNA in #2c and #42a corresponded to the changes of native SULTR4;1 mRNA in the wild-type plants (Figures 3 and 5B). Furthermore, the mutants and SULTR4;1-GFP plants showed no morphological phenotypes both under sulfur replete and sulfur limited conditions. These plants were used for further experiments. [[FIGURE]] To determine the function of SULTR4 vacuolar transporters, intact vacuoles were isolated from the wild type, sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double knockout, and SULTR4;1-GFP lines #2c and #42a. Callus was generated from the hypocotyls of etiolated seedlings and propagated for vacuole isolation. As shown in Figure 6A, neutral red staining ensured the integrity of the tonoplast and intactness of the vacuoles isolated from the callus. Fluorescence of GFP was observed in the tonoplasts of the vacuoles isolated from #2c- and #42a-derived callus (Figure 6B). Measurements of ion contents indicated increased accumulation of sulfate in the vacuoles of the double knockout compared with the wild type (Figure 6C). The amount of sulfate was standardized with the calcium content that showed a constant level of accumulation between the wild type and knockout. The sulfate content in the vacuole was estimated as ∼1.7-fold higher in the double knockout than in the wild type (Figure 6D). In addition, the sulfate content of the vacuole was significantly decreased by expressing the SULTR4;1-GFP construct in the double knockout (#2c and #42a) (Figures 6C and 6D). It is suggested that the function of SULTR4;1 is linked to the efflux of sulfate from the vacuoles and that SULTR4;1-GFP fusion protein functions to complement the double knockout, releasing sulfate from the vacuoles. These results provided functional evidence for the role of SULTR4;1 vacuolar sulfate transporter, facilitating the efflux of sulfate from the vacuoles. [[FIGURE]] The roles of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 transporters were determined by feeding [35S]sulfate to the roots and measuring distribution in the seedlings (Figure 7). Plants were grown under low-sulfur conditions (50 μM sulfate) to maximize SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 expression. The results indicated that the activities of SULTR4 transporters modulate the storage of sulfate in the roots. More [35S]sulfate was accumulated in the roots when the function of SULTR4;1 was absent in the sultr4;1 mutant (Figure 7A). The function of SULTR4;1 was confirmed in sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double knockout plants overexpressing SULTR4;1-GFP (#2c and #42a) (Figure 7B). The content of radioactive sulfate was significantly decreased in the roots of #2c and #42a as compared with the double knockout. The results indicated that the capacity of vacuolar storage of sulfate decreased significantly in the roots of #2c and #42a plants. This is suggested to be the consequence of abundant expression of SULTR4;1-GFP in the roots of #2c and #42a (Figure 5B) that allows rapid release of sulfate from the vacuoles in the root tissues. These lines were even more efficient at releasing sulfate than the wild type (Figure 7B). The results of #2c and #42a showed clear genetic complementation of the double mutant by overexpression of SULTR4;1-GFP. [[FIGURE]] Similarly, [35S]sulfate was accumulated in the roots of the sultr4;2 knockout (340 ± 22 pmol/mg fresh weight [FW]), showing statistically significant differences from the wild type (268 ± 13 pmol/mg FW). This was also evident from the comparison between the sultr4;1 sultr4;2 (868 ± 54 pmol/mg FW) and sultr4;1 knockouts (710 ± 32 pmol/mg FW) (Figure 7A). The increase of [35S] from the wild type was relatively smaller in sultr4;2 than in sultr4;1. These results suggested that SULTR4;1 is the main transporter facilitating unloading of vacuolar sulfate reserve in the roots, and SULTR4;2 may play similar and supplementary roles supporting the SULTR4;1 function at the tonoplast. Contribution of SULTR4;2 was estimated ∼15% of the SULTR4;1 function. Although the function has not been confirmed by reintroduction of SULTR4;2 in the knockout, the results suggested that this second isoform may additionally contribute in controlling the efflux of sulfate from the vacuoles in roots. In contrast with the changes in roots, the amount of [35S]sulfate transported to shoot was not drastically changed in the knockouts and in the overexpressors (Figures 7A and 7B). It is suggested that loading of sulfate into the xylem is homeostatically controlled to maintain a constant level translocated to the shoots.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles at 22°C and 60% relative humidity. GM medium (CITATION) containing 1× MS salts (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and 1% sucrose constituted the control condition. Sulfate-deficient medium was prepared by replacing sulfate salts in MS salts with equivalent chloride salts as described previously (CITATION). The sultr4;1 and sultr4;2 knockouts were obtained from the T-DNA insertion lines of the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility at the University of Wisconsin Biotech Center (http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/) (CITATION). Pooled DNA of T-DNA lines were screened by PCR using gene-specific primers 4;1-F (5′-ATCATGTCCTACGCATCTCTCAGCGTCAA-3′) and 4;1-R (5′-TCTCCACTGATAACAATGGCTCCTTCAAC-3′) for SULTR4;1 and 4;2-F (5′-ATCTCTCCACCGCTTCATCCTCTTCATCT-3′) and 4;2-R (5′-TCGATTCAACTTCAGTGTAGGTCGATGAG-3′) for SULTR4;2. Integration of T-DNAs was confirmed by sequencing the PCR product of the T-DNA flanking regions. Single insertion of T-DNA in the mutant was confirmed by DNA gel blot hybridization. The sultr4;1 and sultr4;2 mutants were crossed to generate the sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double knockout. The F1 plants were self-fertilized, and the double mutant containing homozygous insertion of both T-DNAs was selected from the F2 population by PCR. Complementation was performed by crossing the sultr4;1 sultr4;2 double knockout with the SULTR4;1-GFP transgenic plant line described below. Triple homozygous T-DNA insertions of sultr4;1::T-DNA, sultr4;2::T-DNA, and SULTR4;1-GFP were confirmed by PCR and the analysis of segregation of GFP fluorescence. The F2 plants containing homozygous T-DNA insertions in SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 were selected by PCR using gene-specific primers. Plants containing the SULTR4;1-GFP construct were selected by scanning the plants on a FluorImager 595 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Finally, lines #2c and #42a, showing fluorescence of GFP in all F4 progenies in the double knockout background, were selected for analysis. The Arabidopsis SULTR4;1 genomic region that starts from position −2080 bp upstream of the translation initiation site and terminates at the end of the coding sequence was amplified from ecotype Columbia genomic DNA by PCR. Amplification was performed using high-fidelity KOD plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan), and the nucleotide sequence was checked to confirm the identity with the corresponding Arabidopsis genomic sequence (CITATION). Gene-specific primers 4;1-F-SalI (5′-GTCGACCATCACACGCCTGCCTCACATACACTGAT-3′) and 4;1-R-BglII (5′-AGATCTTTTCTCCACTGATAACAATGGCTCCTTCA-3′) were used to create SalI and BglII sites on both ends. The SalI-BglII fragment of SULTR4;1 and the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of 35S-Ω-sGFP(S65T) (CITATION) containing the GFP coding sequence and the nopaline synthase terminator were ligated and inserted between the SalI and EcoRI sites of pBI101 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), replacing β-glucuronidase and the nopaline synthase terminator. In the case of the SULTR4;2-GFP fusion, the SULTR4;2 genomic region that starts from the position −1983 bp upstream of the translation initiation site and terminates at the end of the coding sequence was amplified by PCR. Gene-specific primers 4;2-F-SpeI (5′-ACTAGTAGATACATCAATGGCTGGCCAGACTGATC-3′) and 4;2-R-NcoI (5′-CCATGGTATTCTCTCTTGACAACAATGGTTCCTCTA-3′) were used to create SpeI and NcoI sites on both ends. The SpeI-NcoI fragment of SULTR4;2 and the NcoI-EcoRI fragment of 35S-Ω-sGFP(S65T) containing the GFP coding sequence and the nopaline synthase terminator were ligated and inserted between the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pBI101, as in the case of the SULTR4;1-GFP fusion. The binary plasmids were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) (CITATION) by the freeze-thaw method (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants were transformed according to the floral dip method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on GM media (CITATION) containing 50 mg L−1 of kanamycin sulfate. T3 homozygous plants with a single T-DNA insertion were selected for further analyses. Splicing of the introns in the SULTR4;1-GFP and SULTR4;2-GFP fusion mRNAs was confirmed to be identical with those in the endogenous SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 mRNAs in transgenic plants. Fluorescence of GFP in transgenic plants was observed under a BX61 microscope equipped with a FV500 confocal laser scanning system (Olympus, Tokyo) and a 505- to 525-nm band-pass filter (Olympus). Cell walls were stained by propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), submerging plant materials in 10 μg mL−1 solution for 1 min. For the staining of tonoplasts, plants were submerged in 20 μM FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min, washed three times in water, and incubated for 18 h on the medium under dark conditions to let the dye sequester to the tonoplast. The fluorescence of propidium iodide and FM4-64 was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope with a 560-nm long-pass filter (Olympus). Cross sections were prepared from root tissues embedded in 5% agar. Tissues were cut into 125-μm sections with a DTK-1000 microslicer (Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan) and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus). For in vivo quantification of GFP, SULTR4;1-GFP and SULTR4;2-GFP plants were scanned in a FluorImager 595 equipped with a 515- to 545-nm band-pass filter. Fluorescence of chlorophyll was scanned in parallel using a 610-nm long-pass filter. Callus was induced from the hypocotyls of etiolated seedlings of the knockout, wild-type, and SULTR4;1-GFP plants. The hypocotyl explants from etiolated seedlings were incubated on CIM medium (CITATION) at 22°C under dark conditions, and the calli initiated were propagated on CIM medium under the same conditions. Protoplasts and vacuoles were isolated by modifying the methods described by CITATION and CITATION. Approximately 2 g of calli were incubated in 60 mL of enzyme solution containing MS salts, 600 mM sorbitol, and 10 mM Mes adjusted to pH 6.0 with Tris, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% cellulase Y-C (Kyowa Chemical Products, Kyoto, Japan), 2% cellulase ONOZUKA RS (Yakult, Tokyo), and 0.2% pectolyase Y-23 (Yakult). Enzymatic digestion was performed for 4.5 h at 32°C under continuous shaking at 100 rpm. After digestion, protoplasts were filtered once through a 1-mm mesh to remove cell debris. Purification of protoplasts and vacuoles was performed using medium B (30 mM Hepes adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris, 30 mM potassium gluconate, 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM EGTA) (CITATION) on a basic sucrose/sorbitol gradient as follows: the filtrate of crude protoplasts was transferred to a 50-mL tube and underlaid with P1 medium (medium B supplemented with 400 mM sorbitol and 50% Percoll). After centrifugation at 180g for 10 min, the protoplasts above the P1 medium layer were collected to a new test tube. P1 medium was added to the protoplasts to a total volume of 6 mL and mixed gently. This was overlaid with 2 mL of P2 medium (medium B supplemented with 400 mM sucrose) and 2 mL of P3 medium (medium B supplemented with 133 mM sucrose and 267 mM sorbitol) and centrifuged first at 180g for 2 min and then at 1600g for 8 min. The protoplasts having the same gravity were collected from the interface between P2 and P3. One volume of purified protoplasts was mixed with the same volume of medium B and incubated on ice for 5 min to release vacuoles by hypotonic shock. Four milliliters of P2 medium was added to the resultant mixture of protoplasts and vacuoles, and then 1 mL of P3 medium, 1.5 mL of P4 medium (medium B supplemented with 100 mM sucrose and 300 mM sorbitol), and 0.5 mL of P5 medium (medium B supplemented with 400 mM sorbitol) were sequentially overlaid. The gradient was centrifuged first at 180g for 2 min and then at 1600g for 8 min. The purified vacuoles were obtained on the interface between P4 and P5. To confirm the intactness, purified vacuoles were observed under a microscope after staining with neutral red. The isolated vacuoles were disrupted by ultrasonication and filtered through an Ultrafree-MC 5000 NMWL filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 10,000g. Quantification of sulfate and calcium was performed by a HP30 capillary electrophoresis system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The sulfate uptake experiments were performed according to the methods described by CITATION. Plants were grown on low sulfate MS agar medium containing 50 μM sulfate as a sulfur source and 1% sucrose. Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on 300-μm nylon mesh embedded vertically on the agar plates. After 10 d of culture, nylon mesh was pulled out from the agar plates and fixed on a square plastic frame placed on a Petri dish containing 50 mL of the MS liquid medium without sulfate. The roots were submerged in the liquid medium. Labeling was started by the addition of 50 μM (1.23 MBq/L) [35S] sodium sulfate (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). After 1 h of labeling, the roots were rinsed twice in 60 mL of nonradioactive MS liquid medium containing 50 μM sulfate. The roots were further incubated for 4 h in 75 mL of nonradioactive medium. The shoots and roots were excised and digested in 1 mL of 100 mM HCl for 1 h. Four milliliters of Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail (Perkin-Elmer, Boston) was added, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo). The mRNA contents of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 were determined by RT-PCR using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the GeneAmp 5700 System (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis plants using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Specific amplification of SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 was performed using gene-specific primers 4;1-2F (5′-TGACACCTCCAATGAAGCTCGTCCTC-3′) and 4;1-1R (5′-AATTGGTGGAAGGCCAGCTAGTTTCG-3′) for SULTR4;1 and 4;2-2F (5′-GATTCCACCTCTTCTGATCCTCACT-3′) and 4;2-1R (5′-TATTGGTTGAAGCCCAGCTAACCTT-3′) for SULTR4;2. The mRNA contents were calibrated using purified SULTR4;1 and SULTR4;2 cDNAs as standards. Equality of RNA preparation was confirmed by constitutive expression of ubiquitin (accession number J05508) as described previously (CITATION). Knockout of SULTR4;1 in the double knockout and in the complemented lines #2c and #42a was confirmed by RT-PCR using specific primers, 4;1-FU (5′-AACGGATTCTCTAAAGTGCGCCAAGCGTG-3′) and 4;1-RU (5′-GTGATACAATGAAGATTGTATACTG-3′), designed on the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of SULTR4;1. The endogenous SULTR4;1 mRNA was specifically amplified with these primer pairs and can be distinguished from the SULTR4;1-GFP transgene expression. Designed on both ends of the coding region, 4;1-F (5′-ATCATGTCCTACGCATCTCTCAGCGTCAA-3′) and 4;1-R (5′-TCTCCACTGATAACAATGGCTCCTTCAAC-3′) were used to compare the contents of SULTR4;1-GFP mRNA in #2c and #42a and SULTR4;1 mRNA in the wild type. To determine the knockout of SULTR4;2 mRNA, 4;2-F (5′-ATCTCTCCACCGCTTCATCCTCTTCATCT-3′) and 4;2-R (5′-TCGATTCAACTTCAGTGTAGGTCGATGAG-3′) were used. Equality of RNA preparation was confirmed by constitutive expression of α-tubulin using gene-specific primers, TUB-F29 (5′-CTCGAAATTAGGGTTTCTACTGAGAGAAG-3′) and TUB-R29 (5′-CCGAACGAATATTTTACAGGATTTAAACA-3′), as described previously (CITATION). PCR was performed by ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Tokyo) for 24 cycles where the cDNAs are exponentially amplified. PCR products were stained with SYBR green II (Takara) and detected using a FluorImager 595 with a 515- to 545-nm band-pass filter (Molecular Dynamics). Signals obtained by this method (Figure 5) were fairly comparable with the mRNA contents determined by real-time PCR (Figure 3).
