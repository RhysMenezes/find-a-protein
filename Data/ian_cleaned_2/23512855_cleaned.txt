!~ABS~! 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved phospho-specific binding proteins involved in diverse physiological processes. Plants have large 14-3-3 gene families, and many binding partners have been identified, though relatively few functions have been defined. Here, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins interact with multiple 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana. ACS catalyzes the generally rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene. This interaction increases the stability of the ACS proteins. 14-3-3s also interact with the ETHYLENE-OVERPRODUCER1 (ETO1)/ETO1-LIKE (EOLs), a group of three functionally redundant proteins that are components of a CULLIN-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase that target a subset of the ACS proteins for rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome. In contrast with ACS, the interaction with 14-3-3 destabilizes the ETO1/EOLs. The level of the ETO1/EOLs in vivo plays a role in mediating ACS protein turnover, with increased levels leading to a decrease in ACS protein levels. These studies demonstrate that regulation of ethylene biosynthesis occurs by a mechanism in which 14-3-3 proteins act through a direct interaction and stabilization of ACS and through decreasing the abundance of the ubiquitin ligases that target a subset of ACS proteins for degradation.
!~RES~! We examined the interaction between ACS and 14-3-3 using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay (Figure 1). The 14-3-3ω isoform interacted in this assay with ACS5, ACS6, and ACS7 (Figure 1A), which represent a type-2, type-1, and type-3 ACS, respectively. A strong fluorescent signal was observed in the cytoplasm of tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) epidermal cells expressing both YFPn-ACS (YFP, yellow fluorescent protein) and YFPc-14-3-3ω fusion proteins but not with the nonrelevant AHP2 fusions, which serve as negative controls. Disruption of the C-terminal TOE domain of a type-2 ACS (ACS5eto2), which is required for the interaction with ETO1/EOLs, did not affect the interaction with 14-3-3 (Figure 1A). This is consistent with the observation that 14-3-3ω interacted with all three classes of ACS proteins, two of which lack the TOE domain (type-1 and type-3) (CITATION). The interaction between 14-3-3 and ACS proteins was confirmed in vivo using a coimmunoprecipitation assay from Arabidopsis transgenic seedlings expressing myc-tagged ACS5 protein (Figure 1B) (CITATION). We examined the interaction of other isoforms of 14-3-3 with ACS5 using the BiFC assay in transiently transfected tobacco epidermal cells (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). All four isoforms of 14-3-3 tested (14-3-3ι, 14-3-3ο, 14-3-3κ, and 14-3-3ϕ) interacted with ACS5, indicating that, at least in this assay, there was no specificity in the interaction between 14-3-3s and ACS proteins. Consistent with this, previous results suggested that 14-3-3 isoforms are often at least partially functionally redundant (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] The R18 peptide is a strong competitive inhibitor of 14-3-3 client protein interactions (CITATION). It has a high affinity for different 14-3-3 isoforms, which enables the peptide to disrupt a wide array of 14-3-3-interactions. In plants, R18 has been shown to alter 14-3-3 function in Arabidopsis leaf disks (CITATION). The ability of R18 and a nonfunctional form of the peptide (R18Lys) (CITATION) to disrupt the interaction between ACS5 and 14-3-3 was examined (Figures 1C and 1D; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). We first examined the effect of R18 on the BiFC interaction between ACS5 and 14-3-3 (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). There were two distinctive classes of fluorescence observed in the BiFC assays of ACS5 and 14-3-3ω in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Approximately 90 percent of the transformed protoplasts (marked with a mitochondria, monomeric Cherry cotransformation reporter) generated strong, punctate fluorescence when transformed with plasmids expressing YFPc-ACS5 and YFPn-14-3-3ω, while the rest showed very faint, weak signals distributed throughout the cytoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). The percentage of the protoplasts showing strong fluorescence was greatly reduced following incubation with R18 peptide (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). By contrast, the mutated R18Lys peptide had little or no effect in this assay. We next examined the effect of R18 on the in planta interaction of ACS5 and 14-3-3. Treatment of seedlings with R18 peptide, but not with an R18Lys control, resulted in a decrease in the amount of 14-3-3 that coimmunoprecipitated with myc-ACS5 (Figure 1C). Likewise, treatment of protoplasts expressing myc-ACS5 and HA-14-3-3ω with R18 peptide resulted in a decrease in the level of myc-ACS5 that coimmunoprecipitated with HA-14-3-3ω protein (Figure 1D). Together, these results indicate that ACS and 14-3-3 proteins exist as a complex and that this interaction can be effectively disrupted in vivo using the R18 peptide. In order to determine whether the interaction with 14-3-3 affects ACS protein stability, the levels of a myc epitope–tagged ACS5 protein were examined following treatment with either R18 or R18Lys peptide. The steady state level of myc-ACS5 protein was reduced approximately threefold in etiolated transgenic seedlings 6 h after treatment with R18 peptide (Figure 2A). By contrast, ACS5 protein levels were comparable in seedlings treated with either R18Lys or a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium control. The decrease in myc-ACS5 protein levels in R18-treated seedlings was not the result of a decrease in the myc-ACS5 transcript levels (see Supplemental Figure 3 and Supplemental Methods 1 online), and thus likely reflects changes in protein stability. Similar to ACS5, myc-ACS7 (a type-3 ACS) protein levels were reduced in the presence of R18 peptide in etiolated seedlings (Figure 2B). While the decrease in ACS7 levels was less than that observed for ACS5, it was very reproducible and significant (P < 0.01 at 4 and 6 h after R18 treatment) and may reflect the relatively long half-life of ACS7 protein. We next studied whether the decrease in ACS5 protein levels in R18-treated seedlings is posttranscriptionally regulated through ubiquitin/proteasome activity. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 abrogated the decrease in myc-ACS5 in response to R18 treatment in etiolated seedlings (see Supplemental Figure 4 online), suggesting that the destabilization caused by disruption of the 14-3-3/ACS5 interaction is proteasome dependent. [[FIGURE]] A transient expression system in Arabidopsis protoplasts was used to determine if the interaction with 14-3-3 protein increases the half-life of ACS5. Coexpression of HA-14-3-3ω increased the half-life of myc-tagged ACS5 protein in this system (Figure 2C). The level of myc-ACS5 protein decreased approximately threefold after 1 h of inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment. By contrast, when a 14-3-3ω expression plasmid was cotransformed with the ACS5 expression plasmid, there was almost no decrease in myc-ACS5 protein levels even after 2 h of cycloheximide treatment. Together, these results indicate that 14-3-3 positively regulates ACS protein stability via the 26S proteasome–dependent pathway. In addition to the ACS protein, both EOL1 and EOL2 were identified in 14-3-3ω complexes using a tandem affinity purification approach (CITATION). As previously demonstrated in etiolated seedlings (CITATION), ETO1 acts partially redundantly with EOL1 and EOL2 to negatively regulate ethylene biosynthesis in light-grown seedlings (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). We hypothesized that similar to the function of 14-3-3σ in its interactions with both p53 and its cognate E3 ligases in mammalian cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), 14-3-3ω may downregulate the stability of the ETO1/EOL E3 ligase components in Arabidopsis. To test this, we first confirmed the previously reported interaction of 14-3-3 and EOLs (CITATION) using a BiFC approach (Figures 3A and 3B). Consistent with the prior report, we observed a positive interaction between 14-3-3ω and both ETO1 and EOL2. Surprisingly, the BiFC fluorescence observed in these interactions was localized not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus, colocalizing with a nuclear red fluorescent protein marker (Cs-RFP) (CITATION). We thus examined the localization of EOL2 and ETO1 green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and 14-3-3ω YFP fusion protein. All three proteins were localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figures 3A and 3B), consistent with the BiFC results. Similar to the 14-3-3/ACS5 interaction, the ETO1/EOLs interacted with multiple different isoforms of 14-3-3 (14-3-3ο, 14-3-3κ, 14-3-3ι, and 14-3-3ϕ) (see Supplemental Figure 6 online), suggesting that, at least with the BiFC assay, there is no specificity in the interactions of 14-3-3s with either ACS or ETO1/EOLs. Interaction of EOL2 and 14-3-3 was confirmed in vivo with a coimmunoprecipitation assay using Arabidopsis HA epitope–tagged EOL2 transgenic seedlings (EOL2-OX) (Figure 3C), and this interaction was disrupted by R18 peptide (Figure 3D). Together, these results confirmed that EOL2 exists as a complex with 14-3-3 protein and its interaction is disrupted by R18 peptide. [[FIGURE]] The effects of 14-3-3 on the steady state level of EOL2 protein was examined using transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts. A fixed quantity of plasmid designed to express HA-EOL2 and increasing amounts of plasmid designed to express HA-14-3-3ω were cotransformed along with a compensating amount of empty vector plasmid (Figure 4A). The steady state level of HA-EOL2 protein decreased as the expression of HA-14-3-3ω increased (Figure 4A). The half-life of HA-EOL2 was greatly shortened in the presence of HA-14-3-3ω (∼25 min) compared with that of HA-EOL2 without added 14-3-3 (∼120 min) (Figure 4B). MG132 blocked the effect of 14-3-3 expression on HA-EOL2 turnover, suggesting that 14-3-3–mediated destabilization of EOL2 is dependent on ubiquitin/proteasome activity (Figure 4C). To test this, we examined the effect of 14-3-3 expression on the ubiquitination of EOL2 using an HA-tagged ubiquitin in mesophyll protoplasts (Figure 4G). As expected, coexpression with myc-14-3-3 reduced the steady state level of GFP-EOL2. Furthermore, there was substantially more of the polyubiquitinated form GFP-EOL2 when coexpressed with myc-14-3-3, suggesting that 14-3-3 promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent destabilization of EOL2 and therefore increases ACS stability. Furthermore, disruption of the ETO1/EOL2-14-3-3 interaction by application of R18 peptide resulted in increased stability of HA-EOL2 and HA-ETO1 proteins in a dosage-dependent manner (Figures 4D and 4E). In vivo experiment using Arabidopsis seedlings expressing HA-EOL2 protein also confirmed that R18 treatment enhances the steady state levels of EOL2 protein (Figure 4F). Because R18 treatment increased the steady state levels of HA-EOL2 protein and inhibited the interaction of EOL2 and 14-3-3, we conclude that 14-3-3 acts a negative regulator of EOL2 protein stability. [[FIGURE]] We next examined the interaction of ACS5, EOL2, and 14-3-3 proteins when plasmids expressing all proteins were introduced into Arabidopsis protoplasts simultaneously (Figure 5). Fixed amounts of HA-EOL2 and HA-ACS5 plasmid were cotransformed with increasing amounts of HA-14-3-3ω plasmid. The steady state level of HA-EOL2 and HA-ACS5 proteins displayed opposite responses to increasing HA-14-3-3ω expression (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Figure 7 online). As the level of 14-3-3 increased, the level of EOL2 declined and that of ACS5 increased, consistent with the results when these proteins were examined individually. Together, these results suggest that 14-3-3 has reciprocal effects on the stability of ACS and ETO1/EOL proteins. [[FIGURE]] As our results indicated that 14-3-3s regulated the stability of the ETO1/EOL proteins, we examined if altered levels of the ETO1/EOLs affected ACS protein levels and, hence, ethylene biosynthesis in planta. Consistent with this, there is a quantitative effect of disruption of the six copies of the ETO1/EOL1/EOL2 genes on ethylene production from etiolated (CITATION) and light-grown (see Supplemental Figure 5 online) Arabidopsis seedlings. In order to test if elevated ETO1/EOLs can have the opposite effect from the loss-of-function mutations, we used Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants overexpressing EOL2. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, increased EOL2 protein led to a decrease in ACS5 protein levels (Figure 5B), suggesting that the expression level of ETO1/EOL proteins could act as a regulatory input affecting ACS protein stability. Consistent with this, transgenic seedlings overexpressing HA-EOL2 protein (EOL2-OX) exhibited reduced ethylene production compared with wild-type seedlings in both dark- and light-grown seedlings (Figures 5C and 5D). This is consistent with results in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), in which overexpression of ETO1 suppressed auxin-induced ethylene biosynthesis (CITATION), and in Arabidopsis, in which overexpression of ETO1 reduced cytokinin-induced ethylene biosynthesis and suppressed the etiolated seedling phenotype of an ACS5 overexpressing transgenic line (CITATION). Consistent with 14-3-3 acting to stabilize ACS proteins, induced overexpression of 14-3-3ω from an estradiol-inducible promoter (14-3-3-OX) enhanced ethylene production in light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings (Figures 5E and 5F). Together, these results support the hypothesis that the levels of both ETO1/EOL2 and 14-3-3 regulate the stability of ACS proteins. We examined whether the effect of 14-3-3 on ACS can be attributed solely to its alteration of ETO1/EOL levels or if there is also an ETO1/EOL-independent effect of 14-3-3 on ACS stability. To address this, we examined the effect of disrupting 14-3-3 interactions via R18 treatment on ethylene function in the eto1-13 eol1-1 eol2-2 triple mutant, in which all three ETO1/EOL1/EOL2 genes harbored T-DNA insertions (CITATION). The three T-DNA insertions in the eto1-13, eol1-1, and eol2-2 mutants all occur within exons and eliminate full-length transcript (CITATION) and are thus likely null alleles. As shown previously, eto1/eol1/eol2 etiolated seedlings display a strong triple response (Figure 6A) (CITATION). The R18 peptide, but not the inactive R18Lys peptide, caused a decrease in the triple response in this triple mutant, as evidenced by the increased hypocotyl length (P < 0.001; Figures 6A and 6B). R18 did not affect the hypocotyl length of wild-type seedlings grown in the presence of ACC (see Supplemental Figure 8 online), suggesting the effects of R18 in eto1/eol1/eol2 etiolated seedlings were the result of an effect on ACS function. Consistent with this, the eto1/eol1/eol2 mutant produced less ethylene in the presence of R18 peptide compared with seedlings grown in the presence of the R18Lys peptide (P < 0.02; Figure 6C). Finally, we examined the steady state level of myc-ACS5 protein in transiently transformed eto1/eol1/eol2 mutant protoplasts treated with increasing concentrations of R18 or R18Lys peptide. R18, but not R18Lys, treatment caused a dose-dependent reduction of ACS5 protein levels in eto1/eol1/eol2 (Figure 6D), similar to the effect in wild-type protoplasts (Figure 6E), though somewhat reduced in magnitude. Together, these results suggest that 14-3-3 affects ACS5 protein stability in a manner that is partially independent of its effect on the ETO1/EOLs. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (Columbia ecotype) were surface sterilized and plated on 1× MS/1% Suc/0.8% agar medium. The plates were stratified for 3 d at 4°C in the dark and then incubated in light for 3 to 5 h at 22°C. Seedlings were incubated at 22°C in the dark or constant light as indicated. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in soil under 16 h light/8 h dark at 20°C under white fluorescent light. Arabidopsis transgenic lines used were dexamethasone-inducible myc-tagged ACS5 (CITATION) and ACS7 and estradiol-inducible myc-tagged 14-3-3 and 35S promoter–driven HA-tagged EOL2. p35S:HA-EOL2 and p35S:14-3-3-myc constructs were introduced into wild-type Columbia to generate EOL2-OX and 14-3-3-OX. Transgenic T1 seedlings were selected on MS agar plates supplemented either 30 µg/mL hygromycin or 10 µg/mL Basta. Transgenic expression was confirmed in hygromycin-resistant or Basta-resistant T2 seedlings by immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody or anti-HA antibody (Roche). Homozygous T3 lines of 14-3-3-OX and T2 lines of EOL2-OX were used in this study. The open reading frames of 14-3-3ω, 14-3-3ι, 14-3-3ο, 14-3-3φ, and 14-3-3κ were amplified from cDNA (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 online) and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to generate entry clones. Along with theses entry clones, entry clones of ACS5, ACS5eto2, ACS6, ACS7, AHP2, ETO1, and EOL2 clones were sequence verified and then moved into pCL112 and pCL113 (BiFC) or pEarleyGate binary (protein expression) Gateway-compatible destination vectors (see Supplemental Table 3 online) via LR reactions (Invitrogen). pMDC7-GW-myc was constructed by inserting a 6X myc cassette into the pMDC7 cassette B vector (CITATION). The pTA7002-DEX-GW vector was constructed by inserting a gateway cassette into pTA7002 (CITATION). Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated infiltration was performed as previously described (CITATION). Agrobacterium strain GV3102 was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with rifampicin and gentamycin. To enhance transgene expression, we coinfiltrated Agrobacterium carrying the p19 suppressor of gene silencing (CITATION). For infiltration, 50 mL of Agrobacterium culture was centrifuged, washed, and suspended in a solution containing 10 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, and 200 μM acetosyringone. Three-week-old N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated and incubated for 3 d at room temperature and subsequently analyzed at day 3 after infiltration. For R18-mediated changes in steady state levels of ACS5 and ACS7 protein experiments, either myc-tagged ACS5 or myc-tagged ACS7 transgenic seedlings were grown on MS plates with dexamethasone in the dark for 3 d. The seedlings were harvested on day 3 and subsequently washed with liquid MS medium for 60 min to remove residual dexamethasone, following incubation with R18 peptide (AnaSpec) (10 µg/mL) or R18Lys (University of North Carolina High-Throughput Peptide Synthesis Facility) (10 µg/mL) for different time periods. The seedlings were then harvested at different time points and the total proteins were extracted with 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. For coimmunoprecipitation from R18 or R18Lys-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 10 d in the light. The seedlings were then carefully removed from the plate and subsequently washed with MS medium for 60 min, followed by further incubation with R18 and R18Lys control peptides for indicted time. The seedlings were then harvested and total proteins were extracted with 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. Anti-myc, anti-HA, and anti-GFP antibodies (Roche), anti-14-3-3 antibody (Santa-Cruz), and anti-BiP antibody (Enzo-Life Science) were used for immunoblotting assay. Ten-day-old light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings were transferred to soil and grown under a 12-h-light/12-h-dark regime at 22°C. Protoplast were isolated and transfected as previously described (CITATION). For transfection, 5 × 105 of protoplasts were incubated with appropriate amounts of plasmid DNA in 20% polyethylene glycol (Fluka) for 5 min. Transfected protoplasts were then washed twice with W5 solution (CITATION) and incubated for 12 to 16 h in the dark for BiFC assay, protein expression, or determination of turnover rates. For protein turnover assay, protoplasts were transfected with appropriate plasmids using polyethylene glycol–mediated method and incubated for 16 h, followed by further incubation with 250 µM cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich). Protoplasts were then harvested at different time points for immunoblotting analysis. For the turnover assay including MG132 (Calbiochem), after 16 h of incubation, the protoplasts were preincubated with 50 µM MG132 before adding cycloheximide. Images for intact tobacco and Arabidopsis protoplasts containing GFP, BiFC-YFP, mitochondria monomeric Cherry, and Cs-RFP constructs were captured and analyzed using confocal scanning laser microscopy with a Zeiss LSM 510 META scanning confocal microscope. The following excitation lines and emission ranges were used: GFP (excited using a 488-nm line, detected between 505 and 530 nm); YFP (excited using a 514-nm line, detected between 530 and 560 nm); mitochondria monomeric Cherry and Cs-RFP (excited using a 560-nm line, detected between 566 and 612 nm). Transgenic seedlings expressing myc-ACS5 protein and myc-LSD1 (CITATION) were grown on MS medium containing 1× MS salts (Research Products International), 0.05% MES buffer, 1% Suc, and 10 nM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7. Total protein extracts were isolated and suspended in coimmunoprecipitation buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaVO3, 5 mM NaF, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche], and 1 mM PMSF). Magnetic anti-myc-beads (Miltenyi Biotech) were added to total protein extracts suspended in coimmunoprecipitation buffer and further incubated for 60 min on ice with gentle shaking. The total protein suspension containing the anti-myc beads was applied to a magnetic column, washed with three times with wash buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaVO3, 5 mM NaF, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1 mM PMSF), and eluted with boiled 2× SDS buffer followed by immunoblotting. Ethylene measurements were performed as previously described (CITATION). Surface-sterilized seeds were germinated in 22-mL gas chromatography vials containing 3 mL of MS with 1% Suc. Following 4 d of stratification at 4°C, the seeds were exposed to white light for 3 to 5 h. For ethylene measurement of dark-grown seedlings, the vials were capped after stratification and incubated at 22°C for 3 d in the dark. For light-grown seedlings, the vials were incubated at 22°C for 12 d after stratification, capped at day 12, and incubated for additional 24 h in the light. For analysis of the effects of R18 peptide on ethylene biosynthesis of eto1-13/eol1-1/eol2-2 (CITATION) seedlings, the seeds were grown in 22-mL gas chromatography vials containing 2 mL of MS with either 200 µg/mL R18 or R18Lys peptide for 3 d in the dark. After growth at 22°C, the accumulated ethylene was measured by gas chromatography. All genotypes and treatments were measured from at least three vials each. Cycloheximide (250 µM) was added to the suspended protoplasts harboring the appropriate plasmids and the protoplasts then harvested at various time points, followed by immunoblot analysis. For the half-life experiment including MG132 treatment, 50 µM MG132 was added 3 h before cycloheximide addition. Image J software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used for a quantification of the bands intensity from immunoblots. Intensity of the bands was normalized to BiP or GFP control band intensity, and these values normalized to the 0 time points or no treatment, which set to a value of 1. Arabidopsis protoplasts were cotransfected with 35S:GFP-EOL2 and 35S:HA-ubiquitin with or without 35S:myc-14-3-3 plasmids. An empty vector plasmid was cotransformed in order to normalize the level of 35S plasmid in all transformations. After 16 h of incubation, 50 µM MG132 was added into the protoplasts and further incubated for 6 h. The protoplasts were then harvested and used for coimmunoprecipitation assay. Total proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated with α-GFP magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by washing with lysis buffer three times. The precipitate was then eluted with boiled 2× SDS sample buffer and used for further analysis with immunoblotting.
