!~ABS~! Compartmentation of the eukaryotic cell requires a complex set of subcellular messages, including multiple retrograde signals from the chloroplast and mitochondria to the nucleus, to regulate gene expression. Here, we propose that one such signal is a phosphonucleotide (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate [PAP]), which accumulates in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to drought and high light (HL) stress and that the enzyme SAL1 regulates its levels by dephosphorylating PAP to AMP. SAL1 accumulates in chloroplasts and mitochondria but not in the cytosol. sal1 mutants accumulate 20-fold more PAP without a marked change in inositol phosphate levels, demonstrating that PAP is a primary in vivo substrate. Significantly, transgenic targeting of SAL1 to either the nucleus or chloroplast of sal1 mutants lowers the total PAP levels and expression of the HL-inducible ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE2 gene. This indicates that PAP must be able to move between cellular compartments. The mode of action for PAP could be inhibition of 5′ to 3′ exoribonucleases (XRNs), as SAL1 and the nuclear XRNs modulate the expression of a similar subset of HL and drought-inducible genes, sal1 mutants accumulate XRN substrates, and PAP can inhibit yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) XRNs. We propose a SAL1-PAP retrograde pathway that can alter nuclear gene expression during HL and drought stress.
!~RES~! We previously showed that the lack of the SAL1 protein in the alx8 mutant promotes constitutive APX2:LUCIFERASE (LUC) expression in the vascular tissue (CITATION; CITATION). Here, we investigated the expression pattern of SAL1 in mature leaf tissue by reporter gene analyses. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the SAL1 promoter (pSAL1:SAL1:GFP) was stronger in the vascular tissue than in the mesophyll tissue of the leaf (Figure 1A). The vascular tissue is the primary site of production of H2O2, especially after HL stress (CITATION) (Figure 1B). By contrast, the HL induction of H2O2 in alx8 vascular tissue was much lower, and the total H2O2 foliar level of plants grown under normal conditions was half of that in the wild type (Figure 1C). Thus, SAL1 expression colocalizes with APX2:LUC activity, with the loss of SAL1 leading to increased APX2 expression (CITATION; CITATION) and reduced H2O2 levels in the vasculature. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the elevated expression of APX2 and other HL-regulated genes is not due to elevated levels of H2O2. [[FIGURE]] In vitro, SAL1 has a dual phosphatase activity against both polyphosphoinositols, such as IP3 (CITATION; CITATION), and 3′(2′),5′-biphosphate nucleotides, such as PAP or PAPS (CITATION). PAPS and IP3 have been reported to be in vivo substrates (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION); PAP has been suggested as a substrate based on work with transgenic plants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We used two different approaches to investigate if the SAL1 phosphatase activity against PAP regulated the expression of APX2 and, thus, ROS levels. First, we tested the hypothesis that accumulation of PAP could upregulate the APX2 promoter and induce the alx8 phenotype by feeding PAP to Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants transformed with the reporter gene APX2:LUC. However, no significant change in APX2:LUC activity was observed when feeding increasing concentrations of PAP to 7-d-old plants via the roots under either low light (LL) or HL (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Failed root substrate uptake or impaired vasculature transport, import into leaf cells, or perception are possible explanations for the negative results of the feeding experiment. Next, we directly measured inositol phosphates (IPs) in the sal1 mutants alx8, fry1-6, and fry1-1. The alx8 mutant harbors a point mutation in SAL1 that renders the recombinant protein enzymatically inactive (CITATION), whereas the fry1-6 allele is a T-DNA insertion mutant (SALK_020882). Both mutants, in the Col-0 background, lacked detectable SAL1 protein and showed very similar rosette morphology (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The third mutant, fry1-1, previously described in the C24 background, was reported to have increased IP3 (CITATION), and increased IP3 by 1.5- to 2.0-fold was recently reported in another sal1 mutant (CITATION), as measured by displacement bioassays. It was not revealed whether other IP compounds could be affected. To test this, we grew young seedlings in the presence of radiolabeled myo-[2-3H]inositol and showed that all the IP pools were similar in Col-0, alx8, fry1-6 (Figures 2A to 2C), and fry1-1 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). [[FIGURE]] Finally, we investigated whether PAP, or PAPS, is the in vivo substrate of SAL1 and developed a highly sensitive and specific fluorescence labeling–based HPLC method for quantification of these nucleotides (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Using this technique, we could clearly quantify PAP and PAPS based on the chromatograms of plant extracts with adenosines derivatized to enable their detection by fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that PAP accumulated 20-fold in three sal1 mutants, alx8 (Table 1), fry1-6, and fou8 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), compared with wild-type plants. There was also a significant but minor increase in PAPS in alx8 and no significant changes in adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS), the sole precursor of PAPS, and an intermediate in the synthesis of Cys. Nor was there any change in GSH, the storage form of Cys. The specific and substantial increase of PAP in sal1 mutants provides the first direct evidence that SAL1 has in vivo nucleotidase activity preferentially against PAP. Quantification of Nucleotide Phosphates and Glutathione-Related Metabolites The correlation between higher PAP levels in alx8 and drought tolerance led us to investigate a role for this metabolite during abiotic stress responses. Thus, we analyzed PAP levels in response to drought and HL in wild-type plants. PAP levels increased 30-fold in leaves of drought-stressed wild-type plants, coincident with a substantial decrease in plant relative water content (RWC) after 7 to 11 d of drought (Figure 3). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) two-factor analyses indicated strong interaction between day and genotype for RWC and PAP, being significantly higher for alx8 relative to Col-0 (P < 0.001). This increase did not occur in the early phase of drought and was observed only when there was a decline in RWC. A similar trend was observed for alx8, but it was delayed, again with PAP only rising as RWC declined. Similarly, exposure of Col-0 plants to HL for just 1 h resulted in significantly (P < 0.005) higher PAP levels than in plants kept at LL (0.9 ± 0.2 versus 0.6 ± 0.2 pmol of PAP/mg fresh weight [FW], respectively), although this increase was much smaller than that observed during drought. Taken together, these results revealed that the level of the sulfur-related metabolite PAP was elevated in mutants lacking SAL1 and increased in response to at least two abiotic stresses. [[FIGURE]] Contrasting results have been obtained regarding the cellular localization of SAL1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To resolve this debate, we used three different methods to investigate SAL1 location. First, a full-length SAL1 fused at the C terminus to GFP accumulated in both chloroplasts and mitochondria of transiently transformed Arabidopsis cells (Figure 4A). The chloroplasts and mitochondria were visualized by red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to either the small subunit (SSU) of ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) transit peptide or to the targeting domain of the ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1 (AOX1), respectively. Second, to verify that this expression pattern was not an artifact due to the use of transitory expression systems, we generated stable transgenic lines. SAL1:GFP fusion protein driven by the native promoter showed SAL1 in both organelles in mesophyll protoplasts isolated from stably transformed pSAL1:SAL1:GFP plants (Figure 4B). The chloroplasts were visualized by chlorophyll fluorescence and the mitochondria by MitoRed. Effectively all compartmentalized GFP could be attributed to either mitochondria or chloroplasts, not nuclei. Third, we developed a new chloroplast and cytosolic fractionation method (see Supplemental Figure 6 online and Methods) that allowed us to detect SAL1 unequivocally as an ~38-kD band in purified chloroplast and mitochondria fractions of Col-0 leaves by immunological methods (Figure 4C). The molecular mass of this band matches that of the recombinant protein lacking the deduced 54–amino acid chloroplast transit peptide (CITATION). The relative purity of the fractions was demonstrated by probing with antibodies against chloroplastic Lhcb, mitochondrial TOM40, and cytosolic UGPase. UGPase was enriched in the cytosolic fraction, and although there was a band in the chloroplast fraction, it is of lower molecular mass than UGPase, and as it is the same size as Rubisco, it is likely that this is a cross-reaction to Rubisco. Significantly, neither Lhcb, TOM40, nor the unprocessed or mature forms of SAL1 were detected in the cytosolic fraction. [[FIGURE]] We attempted to assay PAP from the cytosolic fractions used for the protein purification, but we observed that PAP is labile in tissue extracts, and as a consequence, it was not detected after the lengthy purification procedure. However, analyses of phosphonucleotides from Col-0 chloroplasts prepared by a different, more rapid protocol identified a peak that matched that of the PAP standard, suggesting that PAP is present in the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis (Figure 4D). All this evidence supports the conclusion that SAL1 accumulates in mitochondria and chloroplasts and that PAP can be detected in chloroplasts. Having demonstrated that SAL1 is required for the catabolism of PAP, we sought to investigate whether PAP could act as a mobile signal within the cell, capable of entering the nucleus and regulating gene expression. Due to the aforementioned technical difficulties of measuring adenosines in different cellular compartments, we used a genetic approach to test the hypothesis of PAP movement by the analysis of plant lines with SAL1 targeted to different subcellular compartments kindly provided by CITATION and CITATION. In these earlier studies, the authors reported on partial complementation of morphological phenotypes, but neither PAP, nuclear gene expression, retrograde signaling, nor stress tolerance was measured in these studies. First, does the chloroplast-localized SAL1 regulate PAP concentration? Given the unexpected dual targeting of SAL1 to the chloroplast and mitochondria, it was necessary to determine if chloroplast-localized SAL1 can modulate PAP levels. Targeting the yeast SAL1 (Sc-SAL1) to the chloroplast using the transit peptide of the Rubisco SSU resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) lowering of PAP levels and APX2 mRNA accumulation, demonstrating that chloroplast localization of SAL1 functions in regulating PAP content and APX2 mRNA levels (Figures 5A and 5B). [[FIGURE]] Second, can PAP move between cellular compartments? Targeting of SAL1 to the nucleus resulted in complete complementation of PAP levels (Figure 5A), APX2 mRNA abundance in LL and drought-stressed leaves, ELIP2 mRNA abundance in LL- and HL-treated leaves, and the viability of plants in response to terminal drought (Table 2). The combined results of the targeting experiments indicate that the degree of complementation of PAP levels is somewhat proportional to the degree of complementation of APX2 expression (Table 2, Figure 5). More importantly, they show that PAP can be catabolized by either nuclear or chloroplastic targeting of SAL1, demonstrating that PAP can move between subcellular compartments. Survival of and Expression Levels of Stress-Inducible Genes in Col-0, alx8 Mutants, and fry1-6 Complemented with SAL1 Directed to the Cytosolic-Nuclear Compartment Given that PAP levels are elevated in sal1 mutants, and PAP is known to inhibit the activity of the yeast XRNs (CITATION; CITATION), we hypothesized that PAP could regulate the expression of stress-responsive genes via attenuation of XRN-mediated RNA catabolism. Although the Arabidopsis XRNs are less well characterized than their S. cerevisiae counterparts, they play key roles in multiple RNA processing pathways and as posttranscriptional gene silencing suppressors (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The XRNs belong to a small gene family in Arabidopsis with three members. XRN2 and XRN3 are homologs of Xrn2p/Rat1p and are nuclear localized. By contrast, the cytosolic XRN4 is a functional homolog of S. cerevisiae Xrn1p (CITATION). Identified substrates of XRN2 and XRN3 are excised hairpin loops that form part of precursor MIRNA transcripts, which also accumulate in fry1-6 (CITATION). On the other hand, XRN4 is involved in mRNA decay by degrading the resulting 3′ cleavage products of microRNA (miRNA) targets (CITATION). Analysis of the alx8 transcriptome revealed that transcripts for 19 genes that are confirmed targets of miRNAs were increased by at least threefold (see Supplemental Table 1 online). As probes for Affymetrix arrays are biased toward the 3′ region of genes, we tested whether this reflected increased abundance of full-length mRNA or accumulation of cleaved transcripts due to inhibition of XRN4 by increased PAP levels. We undertook quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of four miRNA targets using primers specific for 3′ sequences or spanning the miRNA cleavage site (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). The uncleaved transcripts did not increase; rather, the 3′ cleavage products for ATHB15, PHB, MYB33, and REV accumulated to higher levels in both sal1 mutants compared with the wild type, with MYB33 showing the highest increase (sixfold). The accumulation of 3′ cleavage products in alx8 that should otherwise be degraded by XRNs is consistent with XRNs being inhibited in SAL1 mutants. To determine if XRNs and SAL1-PAP regulate a common set of genes, we undertook gene expression profiling in the PAP-accumulating alx8 mutant, xrn2 xrn3 double mutant, and xrn4 (ein5-6, ethylene-insensitive5; CITATION). We used Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 genome arrays to analyze global changes in transcript abundance between Col-0 and the mutant genotypes. Whole rosettes of seedlings at the 10 true leaf stage of development were used for analysis of each genotype. We found that for alx8 and xrn2 xrn3, there were 4038 and 2433 transcripts, respectively, that showed a significant change in transcript abundance (>1.5-fold, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected at P < 0.05) relative to Col-0 (Figure 6A; see Supplemental Data Set 1online). By contrast, only 156 transcripts were significantly altered in xrn4 compared with Col-0. This low level of transcriptome change in xrn4 is consistent with previous transcriptome profiling data of xrn4 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] More importantly, there was a large and significant overlap between the alx8 and xrn2 xrn3 transcript profiles (Figure 6B). Of the 1404 genes upregulated in xrn2 xrn3 (relative to Col-0), 50% (680 transcripts) were also upregulated in alx8, which is a significantly greater overlap than would be expected by random chance (P < 0.05), while only 14 transcripts showed an antagonistic response (i.e., were downregulated in alx8), which is statistically fewer than would be expected by chance (P < 0.05; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). Similarly, in the downregulated transcript set, there was a significant overlap of 64% (611 of 954 transcripts) between the xrn2 xrn3 transcriptome and that of alx8, again with lower levels of antagonistic change than would be expected by random chance (24 transcripts; P < 0.05; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). Additionally, coexpression of four highly upregulated transcripts in the alx8 microarray (CITATION) in alx8 and xrn2 xrn3 was confirmed by qRT-PCR (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Furthermore, the fold change of all genes upregulated by more than fivefold was also comparable for xrn2 xrn3 and alx8 (Table 3). Transcripts encoding transferases, transporters, hormone-related transcription factors, and starch synthase were coexpressed in both alx8 and xrn2 xrn3 to the same extent (Table 3). A Subset of Coregulated Genes in xrn2 xrn3 and alx8 That Are Fivefold Up- or Downregulated Compared to Col-0 Finally, comparison of all coexpressed genes up- or downregulated by more than threefold against a series of microarray experiments (CITATION) revealed a high degree of coexpression under HL, ABA, drought stress, and a combined moderate HL and mild drought on a plant with a defective mitochondrial stress-inducible protein, AOX1A (CITATION) (Figure 7). This same set of genes was not differentially expressed in LL or under different light quality and wavelengths, nor was the set similarly coexpressed upon treatment with the plastid translational inhibitor, lincomycin, that suppresses GUN-regulated genes. Both H2O2, known to induce some HL-responsive genes, and the mitochondrial respiratory complex I inhibitor, rotenone (CITATION; CITATION), resulted in increased expression of some of the upregulated genes, but the converse was observed for the downregulated genes. This suggests the coexpressed set of SAL1- and XRN2 XRN3–regulated genes respond to specific organelle signals, such as HL, but not translational inhibitors, such as lincomycin. [[FIGURE]] To investigate further the potential role of PAP in stress signal transduction pathways, we focused on the expression of the model chloroplast stress-responsive genes ELIP2 and APX2 in the xrn mutants. Our analysis of xrn4/ein5-6 transcriptome data (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) revealed that neither ELIP2 nor APX2 is upregulated in the xrn4 mutant. Thus, we focused on XRN2 and XRN3. We aimed to mimic PAP inhibition of the nuclear XRNs by comparing the induction of stress-responsive genes between xrn2 xrn3 and the sal1 mutants under both LL and HL conditions. Indeed, mRNA levels of ELIP2 were remarkably similar in alx8, fry1-6, and xrn2 xrn3 mutants for nonstressed leaves, with APX2 expression being induced in all three mutants but less so in xrn2 xrn3 (Figure 8). Overall, all the mutants exhibited around 100-fold higher levels of ELIP2 and 60- to 600-fold increased APX2 compared with the wild type. Under HL stress, ELIP2 was hyperinduced to the same extent (by ~3000-fold) in alx8, fry1-6, and xrn2 xrn3, and again this was not substantially different between the three mutants, yet it was 10-fold higher than the induction in Col-0 (Figure 8A). The results were comparable for APX2, with expression changes in xrn2 xrn3 being of a similar order of magnitude to the alx8 and fry1-6 mutants, although attenuated (Figure 8B). This is consistent with the observations that APX2 is regulated by multiple signaling pathways in response to HL stress, including H2O2, ABA, glutathione metabolism, and plastoquinone redox state (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) as well as PAP (Figure 5). [[FIGURE]] The results presented above clearly indicate that nuclear XRNs are negative regulators of stress-inducible genes. Significantly, a triple mutant in both cytosolic and nuclear XRNs was better able to survive drought when compared with the wild type in a soil-based experiment (CITATION), indicating that XRNs are regulators of the drought response. To elucidate whether cytosolic or nuclear XRNs mediate the drought response, we investigated the degree of drought tolerance of nuclear xrn2 xrn3 and sal1 mutants, and we also included a second xrn4 single mutant, ein5-6 (CITATION). Both sal1 mutants survived the drought almost 50% longer compared with the wild type as previously shown (CITATION) (Figure 8C). Interestingly, plants with impaired nuclear XRN activity (i.e., the xrn2 xrn3 mutant), but not those in which the cytosolic homolog was mutated (i.e., xrn4), survived longer than the wild type but not as long as the sal1 mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that PAP can stimulate gene expression by repressing the activity of the nuclear XRNs. That is, XRN2 and XRN3 negatively regulate the expression of the stress-responsive genes APX2 and ELIP2 and the drought response, most likely via the SAL1-PAP signaling pathway.
!~MM~! Plant growth and drought stress conditions were as previously described (CITATION). Seeds from fry1-6 (SALK_020882) overexpressing a truncated form of SAL1 (AT5G63980) cDNA (CITATION) and the xrn2-1 xrn3-1 (xrn2 xrn3) double mutant (CITATION) were donated by A.G. von Arnim (University of Tennessee). Seeds for fou8 and SSU:ScSAL1-complemented fou8 (CITATION) were kindly provided by E.E. Farmer (University of Lausanne). Survival time of plants during drought was calculated as described by CITATION from measurements of the maximum efficiency of photosystem II (FvFm) using chlorophyll fluorescence. xrn4 mutants were xrn4-6 (SALK_ 014209) and ein5-6 (CITATION). All insertion mutants were confirmed by PCR. See the primers listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Total RNA was extracted from ~50 mg of leaf tissue using the Spectrum Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA using the Roche Transcriptor first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics) and oligo(dT) primers. Gene expression was analyzed on a Roche LightCycler480 using hydrolysis probes from the Universal Probe Library and applying the relative quantification method described by CITATION. Samples were normalized against CYCLOPHILIN5 (ATCYP5, AT2G29960) or GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE C2 (GAPC2, AT1G13440). At least three biological replicates per genotype per experiment were sampled, and each sample was run in triplicate. Analysis of the changes in transcript abundance between Col-0, xrn4 (ein5), alx8, and xrn2 xrn3 seedlings was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 genome arrays. Whole rosettes from several seedlings at the 10 true leaf stage of development (synchronized for development to account for the slower growth rate of alx8), grown under a 16-h photoperiod, were pooled for each biological replicate. Col-0 and mutant tissue samples were collected in biological triplicate. For each replicate, total RNA was isolated from the leaves using the RNeasy plant mini protocol (Qiagen) and quality verified using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and spectrophotometric analysis was performed to determine the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios. Preparation of labeled copy RNA from 400 ng of total RNA (3′ IVT Express kit; Affymetrix), target hybridization, as well as washing, staining, and scanning of the arrays were performed exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip expression analysis technical manual, using an Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640, an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450, and an GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G at the appropriate steps. Data quality was assessed using GCOS 1.4 before CEL files were exported into AVADIS Prophetic (version 4.3; Strand Genomics) and Partek Genomics Suite software, version 6.3, for further analysis. MAS5 normalization algorithms were performed only to generate present/absent calls across the arrays. Probe sets that recorded absent calls over 11 or more of the gene chips analyzed were removed. Bacterial controls were also removed, resulting in a final data set of 16,022 probe identifiers. CEL files were also subjected to GC-content background Robust Multi-array Average normalization for computing fluorescence intensity values used in further analyses. Correlation plots were examined between all arrays using the scatterplot function in the Partek Genomics Suite, and in all cases r ≥ 0.98 (data not shown). The values of gene expression after normalization with GC-content background Robust Multi-array Average were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes by a regularized t test based on a Bayesian statistical framework using the software program Cyber-T (CITATION) (http://cybert.microarray.ics.uci.edu/). Cyber-T employs a mixture model-based method described by CITATION for the computation of the global false-positive and false-negative levels inherent in a DNA microarray experiment. To accurately control for FDR and minimize false positives within the differential expression analysis, posterior probability of differential expression PPDE(P) values and PPDE(>P) values were calculated, as a means to measure the true discovery rate (1 – FDR). Changes in transcript abundance were considered significant with a PPDE(>P) > 0.95 and a fold change >1.5-fold. Overlaps in the transcript abundance responses for the different genotypes were plotted on Venn diagrams to determine statistically significant over- or underrepresentation in the overlap, compared with that which is expected by random chance, using a Pearson’s χ2 test for independence. ANOVA and t test analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was grown in 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, 1% (w/v) Suc, and 0.7% (w/v) agar plates under LL (100 μmol photon m–2 s–1) with a 12-h photoperiod at 20 ± 2°C for 16 d. Approximately 13 g of seedlings were harvested in the morning before commencement of the light period. The tissue was vacuum infiltrated in 40 mL of digestion medium (1.5% [w/v] cellulase, 0.4% [w/v] macerozyme, 0.5 M Suc, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 20 mM MES) for 30 min and incubated for an additional 3 h. All incubation steps were performed in the dark. After incubation, the mixture was filtered through two layers of miracloth presoaked in floating medium (CITATION) (0.5 M Suc, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0). Protoplasts were released by passing the eluant through the slurry several times, pressing it with a spatula after the last elution, and collecting it in a glass beaker in ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The dark-green flow-through was divided into 10-mL aliquots in four 30-mL Corex tubes and topped with 5 mL of floating medium II (FMII; 0.4 M Suc, 0.1 M sorbitol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) and 3 mL of floating medium III (FMIII; 0.5 M sorbitol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0). This was performed very carefully to avoid disrupting the interfaces between the different solutions. The tubes were centrifuged at 250g for 5 min at 4°C in a swing-out rotor (brake off). Intact protoplasts were recovered from the FMIII/FMII interface and the chloroplast-containing pellet further processed (see below). The intact protoplasts were disrupted by six strokes in a prechilled 10-mL Wheaton Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. An ~8-mL sample was transferred to a 15-mL Corex tube, a 500 μL 85% (v/v) Percoll cushion was layered at the bottom with a long glass Pasteur pipette, and a 1000-μL layer of FMIII was added on the top. The gradient was then centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min at 4°C in a swing-out rotor (brake off). Contaminating protoplasts settled in the FMIII/sample interface, and the remainder of the chloroplasts were on top of the 85% (v/v) Percoll cushion. The middle phase, containing the cytosolic fraction, was carefully removed and centrifuged at 13,000g for 30 min at 4°C in a fixed-angle rotor to remove any contaminating organelles. The supernatant was further concentrated with 5-kD Ultrafree centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). For the purification of chloroplasts, the pellets after the first centrifugation step were resuspended in a final volume of 10 mL of chloroplast buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 330 mM sorbitol, 5 mM Cys, and 5 mM ascorbic acid) and cleared by centrifugation at 250g for 5 min at 4°C in a swing-out rotor. The pellets were gently resuspended in a minimum volume (~3 mL) of the same buffer, loaded onto a 45/85% (v/v) Percoll gradient (CITATION), and spun at 3000g 15 min at 4°C in a swing-out rotor (brake off). The intact chloroplasts were recovered from the 45/85% (v/v) interface, washed once with 10 volumes of chloroplast buffer, and spun at 800g for 15 min in a swing-out rotor at 4°C. The clean, intact chloroplasts were resuspended in 500 μL of chloroplast buffer. Mitochondria were purified by free-flow electrophoresis as described by CITATION. Total protein from tissue and cell fractions were extracted in 10% (w/v) tricarboxylic acid in cold acetone. Protein gel electrophoresis was performed as described (CITATION). Immunoblotting was performed using the SNAPid system (Millipore) and antibodies against SAL1 (1:1000; CITATION), Lhcb2 (1:1000; Agrisera AS01-003), TOM40 (1:5000; CITATION), and UGPase (1:500; Agrisera AS05-086). The full-length cDNA of SAL1 was cloned as a C-terminal GFP fusion by Gateway cloning under the control of a 35S promoter (CITATION; CITATION). Primers used were as follows: SAL1FOR, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCunderline>ATG/underline>underline>ATGTCTATAAATTGTTTTCGAA/underline>-3′, and SAL1REV, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCCACCTCCGGATCCunderline>GAGAGCTGAA/underline>underline>GCTTTCTCTTGC/underline>-3′, where underlined sections correspond to SAL1 and the rest for homologous recombination. The PCR product was cloned into pDonr201 (Invitrogen) and then into pDest/pGem/CGFP (CITATION). The plastid localization control, Rubisco SSU, and the mitochondrial control, AOX1, were cloned as C-terminal RFP fusions using the same system. SAL1-GFP along with either one of the control constructs was cotransformed into Arabidopsis cell suspension as previously described (CITATION; CITATION). Localization of GFP and RFP expression was conducted using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope and imaged using the CellR imaging software as previously described (CITATION; CITATION). The SAL1 genomic fragment (1960 bp) and an additional 753-bp upstream region was PCR cloned by standard molecular techniques in the Wassilewskija accession. Primers used were as follows: FRY1promF, 5′-CACCGTTGGAGATTATCTTCTGTAGG-3′, and FRY1endR, 5′-GAGAGCTGAAGCTTTCTCTTGC-3′, which amplified a product of 2713 bp (753+1960). After sequencing in pENTR/D-TOPO, an LR clonase reaction was used to clone the genomic fragment in the binary vector pGWB4 (CITATION) and transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0 by simplified floral dip method (CITATION). Primary transformants were selected in medium containing 50 μg/L hygromycin. Their progeny were screened for GFP expression in standard in vitro growth conditions. Observations were made using either an upright DMR or a Leica SP2 AOBS inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). In the first case, a ×10 DRY objective lens (numerical aperture of 0.40) was mounted on an upright DMR microscope equipped with a mercury lamp. The GFP and chlorophyll signals were collected using a 515-nm-long pass filter (excitation with 450 to 490 nm). For the observations made with the Leica SP2 AOBS inverted confocal microscope, 2-week-old plants grown in soil in short-day conditions were used. A ×10 dry objective lens (numerical aperture of 0.40) was used for all observations. GFP and chlorophyll were excited with a 488-nm argon laser. The GFP signal was collected at 496 to 539 nm and chlorophyll at 676 to 718 nm (pinhole adjusted to 2.46). Following acquisition, brightness and contrast were adjusted using the LCS software. Mesophyll protoplasts were prepared as described (CITATION). Protoplasts were incubated on ice with 400 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 30 min, in the dark, before confocal observations. Observations were made using a Leica SP2 AOBS inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with an argon ion laser and a DPSS 561-nm laser. A ×63 water objective lens (numerical aperture of 1, 20) was used for all observations. GFP was excited at 488 nm and MitoTracker red at 561 nm. The GFP signal was collected at 500 to 530 nm, the MitoTracker Red signal was collected at 575 to 615 nm, and chlorophyll at 653 to 731 nm. Following acquisition, brightness and contrast were adjusted using the LCS software (identical parameters were applied to control and GFP images). Adenosine derivatives were extracted in HCl and quantified fluorometrically after specific derivatization of adenosine compounds with chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) based on a method previously described (CITATION). Briefly, 100 mg of tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen, extracted with 1 mL of 0.1 M HCl in ice for 15 min, and centrifuged twice at 16,000g at 4°C for 5 min. After clarification, 150 μL of the supernatant mixed with 770 μL of CP buffer [620 mM citric acid-1-hydrate and 760 mM (Na)2HPO4.2H2O, pH 4] was derivatized by adding 80 μL of 45% (v/v) chloroacetaldehyde for 10 min at 80°C. The sample was finally centrifuged at 16,000g for 45 min at 20°C before injection into the HPLC. The commercial standards used were as follows: adenosine (Sigma-Aldrich; A9251), ADP sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich; A2754), AMP (Fluka; catalog number 1930), APS sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich; A5508), ATP (Sigma-Aldrich; A-5394), PAP (Sigma-Aldrich; A5763), PAPS (Sigma-Aldrich; A1651), and S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-Met chloride (Sigma-Aldrich; A7007). The analyses of adenosines was performed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Gemini-NX 5-μm C18 110A column (Phenomenex) connected to Waters 600E HPLC system and Waters 474 fluorescent detector (Waters). The gradient for separation of PAP was optimized as follows: equilibration of column for 0.2 min with 95% (v/v) of buffer A (5.7 mM [CH3(CH2)3]4N HSO4 and 30.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 5.8) and 5% (v/v) buffer B (67% [v/v] acetonitrile and 33% [v/v] buffer A), linear gradient for 53 min up to 50% (v/v) of buffer B, and re-equilibration for 7 min with 5% (v/v) buffer B. Chromatograms were recorded and processed with the Milenium32 software (Waters) and edited using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe). Seeds were stratified and sown on 0.5× MS agar containing vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie) and germinated at 22°C in a Sanyo light cabinet under long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) conditions at a fluence rate of 120 μmol m−2 s−1 for 10 d. Five or six seedlings were subsequently placed in 0.4 mL of 0.5× MS agar basal salts (Duchefa) liquid media to which 1.11 mBq of myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity 752 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer) and 0.1 mM unlabeled myo-inositol were added. Seedlings were labeled for 72 h. Seedlings were washed briefly in water, blotted dry, transferred to a conical Eppendorf tube, frozen in liquid N2, and ground with a plastic pestle. The sample was extracted, with further grinding, with 0.3 mL of 0.6 M HCl after addition of 10 μL of 1 mM phytic acid (Sigma-Aldrich; P8810) and left on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 17,000g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted to 1 mL with water and applied directly to HPLC. IP extracts were analyzed on a 25 cm × 4.6-mm Partisphere SAX HPLC column (Whatman) with guard cartridge of the same material. Samples, 1 mL, were loaded and eluted with a gradient of phosphate, generated by mixing solvents from buffer reservoirs, A, water; B, 1.25 M NH4H2PO4, adjusted to pH 3.35 with H3PO4, according to the following schedule: time (min),% B; 0,0; 5,0; 65,100; 75,100. Radioactivity was estimated in a Canberra Packard A515 detector fitted with a 0.5-mL flow cell after admixture of Optima Flo AP scintillation fluid (Canberra Packard) at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1. The integration interval was 0.2 min. Data were exported from the Flo-One software (Canberra Packard) as ASCII files and redrawn in Delta Graph 4.0 (DeltaPoint). Seven-day-old, plate-grown Col-0 seedlings were incubated with 100 μL of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM PAP in 96-well plates. They were then incubated at LL (150 μmol m−2 s−1) or HL (1500 μmol m−2 s−1) for 50 min. After treatment, 1 mM luciferin was added and light emitted acquired overnight in a luminometer (FLUOStar OPTIMA). Foliar H2O2 levels were visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. Five-week-old plants grown hydroponically were transferred to a solution containing 25 mM DAB and incubated 1 h under HL (1000 μmol photons m−2 s−1). The leaves were then placed into ethanol to remove the chlorophyll and the presence of H2O2 visualized as a brown stain. Alternatively, leaf H2O2 was quantified in 6-week-old, soil-grown plants with the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Approximately 100 mg of leaf tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and extracted with 500 μL of 20 mM K2HPO4, pH 6.5. The slurry was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with 0.1 mM Amplex Red reagent and 0.2 units mL−1 horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 30 min in the dark (final reaction volume of 100 μL). Finally, absorbance was measured at 560 nm using a μQuant plate reader (BioTek Instruments) with Gen5 software, and the concentration of H2O2 was calculated using a standard curve (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mM H2O2 range).
