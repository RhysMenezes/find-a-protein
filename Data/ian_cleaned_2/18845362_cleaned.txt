!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis ACD11 gene encodes a sphingosine transfer protein and was identified by the accelerated cell death phenotype of the loss of function acd11 mutant, which exhibits heightened expression of genes involved in the disease resistance hypersensitive response (HR). We used ACD11 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an Arabidopsis cDNA library to identify ACD11 interacting proteins. One interactor identified is a protein of unknown function with an RNA recognition motif (RRM) designated BPA1 (binding partner of ACD11). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the ACD11–BPA1 interactions in vivo and in vitro. Two other ACD11 interactors (PRA7 and PRA8) are homologous to each other and to mammalian PRA1, and both were subsequently shown to interact with BPA1 in yeast. A fourth interactor (VAP27-1) is homologous to mammalian VAP-A, and was found to interact more strongly with a homolog of ACD11 than ACD11 itself. All interactors were shown to be associated with membrane fractions, suggesting that ACD11 function could be related to the regulation of membrane compartments.
!~RES~! To gain insight into the function of ACD11, we used the yeast GAL4-based two-hybrid system to isolate ACD11 interacting proteins. The DNA-binding domain of GAL4 was fused to ACD11 (BD-ACD11), and the fusion was confirmed to be expressed in yeast, while it did not auto-activate transcription of reporter genes. In total 1.7×107 clones were screened by co-transformation of the ACD11 bait fusion and the cDNA library, and 23 clones representing four different genes were identified (CITATION A). The four fastest growing clones were full-length or truncated versions of a protein encoded by the At5g16840 gene, designated here as binding partner of ACD11 (BPA1; accession NP_197186). BLAST searches showed that the BPA1 N-terminal region contains a domain with homology to the RNA recognition motif (CITATION; RRM). Additional interactors included two almost identical proteins with homology to human prenylated Rab acceptor (PRA1; CITATION), which we designated AtPRA7 (At1g55190; AAM63371) and AtPRA8 (At3g13720; AAM66945). Interestingly, both PRA7 and PRA8 were subsequently shown in direct two-hybrid experiments to interact with BPA1, indicating that PRA7 and/or PRA8 may form a protein complex(es) with both BPA1 and ACD11 (CITATIONB). The fourth protein identified in the screen was a 256 residue protein (CITATION; NP-567101; At3g60600) previously designated AtVAP27-1 due to its homology to human VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-associated protein (HsVAP-A; CITATION). AtVAP27-1 was the weakest interactor of the four, and despite it being isolated on SD-4 plates in the initial screen, it was not possible to see growth when performing semi-quantitative growth assays (CITATIONA). To confirm the interaction between ACD11 and the strongest interactor BPA1, radio-labeled epitope-tagged proteins were in vitro translated and used to detect immunocomplexes. These studies showed that HA-tagged BPA1 could pull down Myc-tagged ACD11, whereas a Myc-tagged lamin control was not co-immunoprecipitated (CITATION A). For in vivo interaction assays, BPA1 was fused to a Myc epitope-tag downstream of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and transformed into Arabidopsis wtLer plants. Transgenic plants containing the Myc-tagged BPA1 construct produced fusions readily detectable by anti-Myc immuno-blotting (CITATIONC). We generated an ACD11 polyclonal antibody raised against a short ACD11-specific peptide. This antibody was shown to be specific for ACD11 in plant extracts (CITATIONB). It was possible to detect an ACD11 band of the correct size (23kDa) in plant protein extracts immunoprecipitated with the Myc-antibody from Myc-BPA1 expressing plants, but not from the Ler wild type (arrow in CITATIONC). These results confirm that BPA1 is an interactor of ACD11, and that complexes between them are present in plant extracts. To further investigate the potential protein complexes involving ACD11 interactors, we assayed their interactions with a close homolog of ACD11 (ACDH1, At4g39670, NP_195677). VAP27-1 interacted more strongly in yeast with ACDH1 than with ACD11, while there was no interaction between ACDH1 and BPA1 or PRA7/PRA8 (CITATION ). It is therefore likely that VAP27-1 only interacts with ACDH1 in vivo. Clearly, the interaction in yeast between ACD11 and PRA7/PRA8 was weaker than that between ACD11 and BPA1 (CITATIONA). This might explain why we were unable to detect complexes between ACD11 and PRA7/PRA8 in vivo. The membrane association of human PRA and VAP proteins led us to investigate whether ACD11 or its interactors behave as membrane-associated proteins in plants. Sucrose gradient separation of membrane and cytosolic fractions followed by immuno-blotting detected VAP27-1 mainly in the membrane fraction, while BPA1 and PRA8 were detected in both membrane and soluble fractions. In contrast, ACD11 was predominantly present in the soluble fraction (CITATION ).
!~MM~! Strain AH109 (Clontech) was used in all experiments. Untransformed yeast was grown in YPD, while selection of plasmids and/or interactions were performed on appropriate SD-dropout media. SD-2 denotes plates lacking leucine and tryptophane to select bait (BD) and prey (AD) plasmids, respectively. SD-4 plates also lacked histidine and adenine to select for bait–prey interaction. Full-length cDNA of ACD11 and ACDH1 was cloned into pGBKT7 using SmaI/SalI linker primers. A library scale co-transformation of the Matchmaker library (Clontech) and pGBKT7-ACD11 was performed using 1mg pGBKT7-ACD11 and 0.5mg Matchmaker library. Transformed cells were incubated on SD-4 plates at 30°C for up to 7d. A total of 17×106 clones were screened. For the semi-quantitative growth assays, one colony from a fresh plate was selected and diluted in 200μL sterile H2O. The OD600 was measured and adjusted to 0.1. Each sample was diluted 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 times, and 10μL was plated on a dry surface plate. pGBKT7-ACD11 or -Lamin constructs contained a T7 promoter driving expression of Myc-tagged bait proteins. T7 promoter and HA-tag were added to BPA1 by PCR as directed by Clontech. In vitro translation reactions were performed using the T7 TNT Quick Coupled Transcription-Translation System (Promega). Based on the intensity of bands, equal amounts (2–8μL) of in vitro translated ACD11- or Lamin-Myc and HA-tagged BPA1 were incubated for 1h at 30°C. Immunoprecipitation buffer (50mM Tris pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% triton, 10% glycerol, 1μL/mL aprotinin) was added to a volume of 490μL. Finally, 10μL of Protein A coupled Dynal Beads (Dynal Biotech) pre-incubated with antibody was added, and the reaction incubated 2h at 4°C. Beads were washed 3 times (IP buffer, 1% triton), resuspended in 20μL 1× SDS loading buffer, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was incubated with a signal amplification solution (Amersham), dried and exposed to film for 7d. Interactor cDNAs were N-terminally Myc-tagged by subcloning into the SacI site of pMYC2, and then cloned into the dephosphorylated SmaI site of pCAMBIA 1300 using phosphorylated primers. All constructs were transformed into Ler plants by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on 11mg total protein, from 35S-Myc-BPA1 or Ler plants extracts in IP buffer (150mM KCl, 50mM Hepes pH 7.5, 10% glycerol and plant protease inhibitors, Roche). Total volumes were 2.5–3mL. The reaction was incubated o/n at 4°C with 10μL 9E10 anti-Myc-antibody before addition of 40μL 50% slurry of Protein G sepharose for 1h. Sepharose beads were washed 3 times in IP buffer and once in IP buffer+0.1% Tween. The 20μL 1× SDS loading buffer was added, and samples loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Wet blotting was performed o/n at 100mA in a Biorad mini protean chamber, and the filter blocked for 2h in 3% BSA in PBS. Immuno-blots with polyclonal anti-ACD11 antibody (1:1000 dilution) were developed using NBT/BCIP in AP buffer (100mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 100mM Tris pH 9.5) for 15–30min. Transgenic lines overexpressing Myc-tagged interactors were used together with plants expressing HA-tagged ACD11. Totally 10g plant tissue were ground in 20mL homogenization buffer (250mM Tris pH 8.5, 290mM sucrose, 25mM EDTA and 75mM β-mercaptoethanol) and filtered through a nylon cloth. The supernatant was centrifuged for 2h at 100,000g, and the membrane pellet fraction was resuspended in 0.5mL resuspension buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT and 10% glycerol). The pellet containing membranes was resuspended in buffer, and protein was quantified to ensure equal loading. Immuno-detection was performed on 20μg of protein with the indicated antibodies.
