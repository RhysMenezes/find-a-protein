!~ABS~! Helix-hairpin-helix DNA glycosylases are typically small proteins that initiate repair of DNA by excising damaged or mispaired bases. An invariant aspartic acid in the active site is involved in catalyzing the excision reaction. Replacement of this critical residue with an asparagine severely reduces catalytic activity but preserves enzyme stability and structure. The Arabidopsis DEMETER (DME) gene encodes a large 1,729-aa polypeptide with a 200-aa DNA glycosylase domain. DME is expressed primarily in the central cell of the female gametophyte. DME activates maternal allele expression of the imprinted MEDEA (MEA) gene in the central cell and is required for seed viability. We mutated the invariant aspartic acid at position 1304 in DME to asparagine (D1304N) to determine whether the catalytic activity of the DNA glycosylase domain is required for DME function in vivo. Transgenes expressing wild-type DME in the central cell rescue seed abortion caused by a mutation in the endogenous DME gene and activate maternal MEA:GFP transcription. However, transgenes expressing the D1304N mutant DME do not rescue seed abortion or activate maternal MEA:GFP transcription. Whereas ectopic expression of the wild-type DME polypeptide in pollen is sufficient to activate ectopic paternal MEA and MEA:GUS expression, equivalent expression of the D1304N mutant DME in pollen failed to do so. These results show that the conserved aspartic acid residue is necessary for DME to function in vivo and suggest that an active DNA glycosylase domain, normally associated with DNA repair, promotes gene transcription that is essential for gene imprinting.
!~RES~!  The Invariant Aspartic Acid Is Essential for Seed Viability. We mutated the conserved aspartic acid at position 1304 to asparagine (D1304N) to determine whether DNA glycosylase activity is critical for DME function. The full-length cDNA clone with the mutation, DME(D1304N), as well as the control wild-type full-length DME cDNA clone, was ligated to 3.4-kb of DME 5′ flanking sequences that activate transcription in the central cell of the female gametophyte (CITATION). We transformed Arabidopsis plants with DME:DME(D1304N) and obtained four independently isolated transgenic lines designated DME:DME(D1304N)-1, -2, -3, and -4. We also transformed Arabidopsis plants with the control DME:DME transgene and obtained four independently isolated transgenic lines designated DME:DME-1, -2, -3, and -4. Transgenes were crossed into a dme-2 heterozygous background so that we could compare the function of the DME(D1304N) and DME proteins during seed development. Wild-type Arabidopsis seeds rarely abort (FIG-REF). Self-pollinated heterozygous DME/dme-2 siliques display 50% seed abortion (FIG-REF and Table 1) because seed viability depends on the presence of a wild-type maternal DME allele (CITATION). Seeds that inherit a wild-type maternal DME allele are viable, and seeds that inherit the mutant maternal dme-2 allele abort. Self-pollinated heterozygous DME/dme-2 siliques that are also hemizygous for the DME:DME transgene show a reduced level of seed abortion. Two transgenic lines (DME:DME-3 and DME:DME-4) displayed 25% seed abortion (Table 1 and FIG-REF). In these two lines inheritance of a mutant dme-2 allele and a transgene produced a viable seed, indicating that the DME:DME transgene had suppressed the dme-2 allele and rescued seed viability. Two other transgenic lines (DME:DME-1 and DME:DME-2) displayed ≈30% seed abortion and therefore partially suppressed the dme-2 mutation (Table 1). By contrast, four independent lines heterozygous for DME/dme-2 and hemizygous for a mutant DME:DME(D1304N) transgene had siliques with 50% seed abortion (Table 1 and FIG-REF), indicating that seeds with a dme-2 allele and the mutant transgene were not viable, indicating that the DME:DME(D1304N) transgene had not suppressed the dme-2 mutant allele. These results show that the conserved aspartic acid is essential for DME function in developing seeds. [[FIGURE]] Transmission of a maternal mutant dme-2 allele is a more sensitive assay to compare DME and DME(D1304N) function during seed development. None of the viable F1 progeny inherit the maternal mutant dme-2 allele when a heterozygous DME/dme-2 plant is pollinated with wild-type pollen (FIG-REF), confirming the importance of the wild-type maternal DME allele during seed development. When a plant that is heterozygous DME/dme-2 and hemizygous for a DME:DME-4 transgene is pollinated with wild-type pollen, viable F1 progeny are detected that inherit both the maternal mutant dme-2 allele and the transgene (FIG-REF), indicating that the DME:DME-4 transgene suppressed the dme-2 mutant allele. However, when a heterozygous DME/dme-2, hemizygous DME:DME(D1304N)-3 plant is pollinated with wild-type pollen, the frequency of F1 progeny that inherit the maternal mutant dme-2 allele and the transgene is reduced ≈50-fold (FIG-REF). These results suggest that the D1304N mutation severely reduces but does not completely abolish DME activity during seed development. This is consistent with the finding that some glycosylases retain slight activity after mutation of the aspartic acid to asparagine (CITATION, CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  The Invariant Aspartic Acid Is Required for Activation of Maternal MEA:GFP Transcription in the Central Cell. Essentially all prefertilization ovules (153 of 155 checked) from MEA:GFP homozygous plants showed strong GFP fluorescence in the central cell nucleus and cytoplasm (FIG-REF). DME is necessary for the transcription of a MEA:GFP transgene in the central cell of the female gametophyte (CITATION, CITATION), and plants homozygous for MEA:GFP and heterozygous for DME/dme-2 display a 1:1 segregation ratio of fluorescent to nonfluorescent ovules (113:108, χ2 = 0.1, P > 0.8) (FIG-REF). To determine whether DNA glycosylase activity is critical for MEA gene activation, we analyzed the effect of the D1304N mutation on transcription of the MEA:GFP transgene. In plants homozygous for a MEA:GFP transgene, heterozygous for DME/dme-2, and hemizygous for a DME:DME-4 transgene, we detected a 3:1 segregation ratio of fluorescent to nonfluorescent ovules (557:169, χ2 = 1.1, P > 0.4) (FIG-REF). These results suggest that female gametophytes inheriting dme-2 and the DME:DME transgene transcribed MEA:GFP and that the DME:DME transgene suppressed the dme-2 mutant allele. By contrast, in plants homozygous for a MEA:GFP transgene, heterozygous DME/dme-2, and hemizygous for a DME:DME(D1304N)-3 transgene, we detected a 1:1 segregation ratio of fluorescent to nonfluorescent ovules (378:369, χ2 = 0.1, P > 0.8) (FIG-REF). This result suggests that the female gametophytes inheriting dme-2 and the DME:DME(D1304N) transgene did not transcribe the MEA:GFP transgene, and DME:DME(D1304N) did not suppress the dme-2 mutant allele. Thus, the conserved aspartic acid D1304 is essential for activation of MEA:GFP transcription by DME. [[FIGURE]]  The Invariant Aspartic Acid Is Required for Ectopic Paternal MEA Allele Expression. Ectopic DME expression in the leaf and endosperm is sufficient to induce MEA and paternal MEA allele expression, respectively (CITATION). These results suggest that restriction of DME expression to the central cell of the female gametophyte is responsible, at least in part, for MEA imprinting in the endosperm. Consistent with this model, DME and MEA paternal allele RNA is not detected in the male gametophyte, pollen (FIG-REF), and GUS staining is not detected in DME:GUS (CITATION) or MEA promoter ligated to GUS cDNA (MEA:GUS) (FIG-REF) transgenic pollen. Thus, the pollen provides an opportunity to compare the ectopic activation of MEA and MEA:GUS expression by DME and DME(D1304N) in a cellular environment that is free from endogenous DME and MEA expression. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We generated CaMV:DME transgenic lines (CITATION) where transcription of the wild-type DME cDNA is under the control of the CaMV promoter (CITATION). Here, we show that both DME and MEA RNAs were present in pollen from independently isolated CaMV:DME transgenic lines (FIG-REF). This result indicates that expression of wild-type DME in pollen is sufficient to activate paternal MEA expression and supports the model that preventing DME expression in the male gametophyte is necessar y for MEA gene imprinting. By contrast, DME(D1304N) RNA, but not MEA RNA, was detected in pollen harvested from multiple independently isolated CaMV:DME(D1304N) lines that express the mutant DME(D1304N) protein (FIG-REF). The level of mutant DME(D1304N) and wild-type DME RNAs were similar in pollen harvested from the DME:DME(D1304N) and DME:DME lines, respectively, suggesting that the failure to induce MEA gene expression in the DME:DME(D1304N) lines is due to the replacement of aspartic acid by asparagine in the DME(D1304N) DNA glycosylase active site. We also crossed the CaMV:DME-4 and CaMV:DME(D1304N)-1 transgenes into a MEA:GUS genetic background. We detected GUS staining in pollen grains from plants hemizygous for a CaMV:DME-4 transgene and hemizygous for a MEA:GUS transgene (FIG-REF). By contrast, no GUS staining was detected in plants hemizygous for CaMV:DME(D1304N)-1 and MEA:GUS transgenes (FIG-REF). These results suggest that active DME DNA glycosylase is essential for activation of MEA gene transcription in pollen.
!~MM~!  Plant Materials and Microscopy. Wild-type and mutant dme alleles (Landsberg er ecotype) are as described (CITATION). Methods for growing plants, fixing tissues, photography, β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity localization, and fluorescence microscopy were as described (CITATION).  Generation of Transgenic Lines. To mutate the conserved aspartic acid at position 1304 to asparagine, JHDME1 primer (CCCTGTTaACACGAATGTTGGAAGGATAGC; codon for asparagine is underlined, mutagenized base is lowercase) and SKEN-5 (CITATION) primer were used in a PCR to amplify a 1.3-kb DME (D1304N) cDNA. A 0.5-kb DNA fragment spanning the D1304 codon was excised from the wild-type DME cDNA clone by digestion with HincII and XmaI restriction endonucleases and was replaced with the 0.5-kb HincII and XmaI DNA fragment with the D1304N mutation, creating the full-length DME(D1304N) cDNA clone. The DME promoter ligated to DME cDNA [DME:DME (CITATION)] and the DME promoter ligated to a mutagenized DME cDNA where aspartic acid at position 1304 is changed to asparagine [DME:DME(D1304N)] transgenes were generated by ligating 3.4 kb of DME 5′ flanking sequences to the wild-type full-length DME cDNA and DME(D1304N) cDNA, respectively. Transgenes were inserted into the Agrobacterium vector, pBI-GFP(S65T), and transgenic wild-type (Landsberg er ecotype) Arabidopsis lines were generated (CITATION). Four independent DME:DME(D1304N) T1 transgenic lines were pollinated with DME/dme-2 pollen to generate F1 lines heterozygous DME/dme-2 and hemizygous DME:DME(D1304N). Likewise, four independent DME:DME T1 transgenic lines were pollinated with DME/dme-2 pollen to generate F1 plants, heterozygous DME/dme-2 and hemizygous DME:DME. Identification of these plants was facilitated by the fact that the dme-2 mutant allele is due to insertion of a pSKI015 T-DNA (CITATION) with a BAR gene that confers resistance to glufosinate ammonium herbicide (Basta, Crescent Chemical, Islandia, NY). Plants bearing the DME:DME or DME:DME(D1304N) transgenes were identified by PCR amplification of a 460-bp DNA by using 3′ RACE1(5′-GCCTACA AGCCAGTGGGATAG-3′) and SKB4 (5′-GGATGGACTCGAGCACTGGG-3′) primers. Plants homozygous for a MEA promoter ligated to GFP cDNA (MEA:GFP) transgene (CITATION), heterozygous DME/dme-2, DME(D1304N) transgenes were generated by standard genetic crosses. Plants bearing the MEA:GFP transgene were identified by PCR amplification of an 860-bp DNA by using UCB3-F2 (5′-AGGAATTTAACCCGTATATATGTC-3′) and 5′ sGFPrev (5′-GAACTTGTGGCCGTTCACGTCGCC-3′) primers. The cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV) was ligated to a full-length DME cDNA to create a CaMV:DME transgene as described (CITATION). To generate a CaMV promoter ligated to mutant DME(D1304N) cDNA [CaMV:DME(D1304N)] transgene, a 2.3-kb BsrGI and SmaI DNA spanning the D1304N mutation was excised and used to replace the 2.3-kb BsrGI and SmaI DNA from a full-length DME cDNA, creating the CaMV:DME(D1304N) cDNA clone.  Pollen Collection and RNA Analysis. Pollen were isolated and processed by using procedures modified from Preuss et al. (CITATION). About 30 open flowers were harvested in an Eppendorf tube on ice with 750 μl of tobacco pollen germination medium (20 mM Mes-KOH, pH 6.0/0.07% Ca(NO3)2/0.02% MgSO4·7H2O/0.01% KNO3/0.01% H3BO3/2% sucrose/15% PEG 4000). Tubes were vortexed, and then the pollen was sedimented at 9,000 rpm for 30 s. After supernatant and flower debris were removed, pollen was resuspended by vortex mixing in 50 μl of ice-cold pollen germination medium. Pollen from ≈600 flowers was pooled into a single tube, sedimented at 9,000 rpm for 30 s, resuspended by vortex mixing in 800 μl of ice-cold Arabidopsis pollen germination medium (17% sucrose/2 mM CaCl2/1.625 mM boric acid, pH 7.5, with 4 M KOH), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to induce germination. Pollen was then sedimented at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. RNA was isolated with 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and RT-PCRs were carried out as described (CITATION). Primers for amplifying DME were cDNA-5 (CAGAAGTGTGGAGGGAAAGCGTCTGGC) and SKEN-5 (CITATION). Primers for MEA were as described (CITATION).
