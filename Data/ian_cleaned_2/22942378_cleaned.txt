!~ABS~! Gibberellin (GA), a diterpene hormone, plays diverse roles in plant growth and development, including seed germination, stem elongation, and flowering time. Although it is known that GA accelerates flowering through degradation of transcription repressors, DELLAs, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We show here that DELLA directly binds to microRNA156 (miR156)-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING–LIKE (SPL) transcription factors, which promote flowering by activating miR172 and MADS box genes. The interaction between DELLA and SPL interferes with SPL transcriptional activity and consequently delays floral transition through inactivating miR172 in leaves and MADS box genes at shoot apex under long-day conditions or through repressing MADS box genes at the shoot apex under short-day conditions. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanism by which GA controls flowering and provide the missing link between DELLA and MADS box genes.
!~RES~! Under normal conditions, DELLAs are subjected to GA-induced proteolysis. To reveal the role of GA in flowering, we expressed RGAd17, the GA-insensitive form of RGA (CITATION), from its own upstream regulatory sequence (ProRGA:RGAd17). ProRGA:RGAd17 phenocopied the GA-deficient mutant, developed small dark green leaves, and delayed flowering (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Both phloem and SAM have been shown to play critical roles in the floral induction. To understand where RGA regulates flowering, we generated transgenic plants in which RGAd17 was expressed from either a phloem-specific promoter, SUC2 (CITATION), or a meristem-specific promoter, FD (CITATION). In long-day conditions, the wild-type plants began to flower with ∼12 leaves. Both ProSUC2:RGAd17 and ProFD:RGAd17 exhibited a late flowering phenotype, producing more than 20 leaves at the time of bolting (Figures 1A to 1C). In short-day conditions, the flowering of the wild type was greatly delayed, because of the absence of photoperiodic input (Figure 1D). ProSUC2:RGAd17 plants flowered nearly at the same time as the wild type, whereas ProFD:RGAd17 severely blocked the floral transition (Figures 1E and 1F). Six out of 40 T1 ProFD:RGAd17 plants failed to flower. Taken together, these results indicate that RGA regulates flowering via two distinct mechanisms: it suppresses flowering both in the leaves and at the shoot apices in long-day conditions and delays flowering at the shoot apices in short-day conditions. [[FIGURE]] To assess whether the late flowering phenotype of ProSUC2:RGAd17 in long-day conditions was caused by a low amount of FT, we performed quantitative real-time PCR. To facilitate the expression analyses, we chose one representative T3 line of ProFD:RGAd17 and ProSUC2:RGAd17. Both of these flowered late under long-day or short-day conditions (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The leaves of wild-type, ProFD:RGAd17, and ProSUC2:RGAd17 plants were collected at zeitgeber time 16, when FT shows the highest expression level (CITATION). Compared with wild-type and ProFD:RGAd17 plants, the transcript level of FT was markedly less in ProSUC2:RGAd17 (Figure 2A), indicating that RGA is able to repress FT in the vascular tissue of the leaves. In agreement with this finding, it has been shown that GA was able to induce FT expression in long-day conditions (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Recent studies have demonstrated that miR172, which is activated by miR156-targeted SPLs, targets AP2-like transcription factors that negatively control FT expression in leaves (CITATION; CITATION). Overexpression of SCHLAFMUTZE (SMZ) or SCHNARCHZAPFEN (SNZ), two miR172-targed AP2-like genes, results in a decrease in FT expression and a late flowering phenotype in long-day conditions (CITATION). To test whether DELLA represses FT through the SPL-miR172-AP2 module, we analyzed the level of miR172. Compared with wild-type and ProFD:RGAd17 plants, the level of mature miR172 was much lower in the leaves of ProSUC2:RGAd17 plants (Figure 2B). Consistent with this, the accumulation of the primary transcript of MIR172b, one of the five coding genes of miR172, was accordingly less (Figure 2C). We then examined the expression of miR172-targeted AP2-like genes, including AP2, SMZ, SNZ, TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1), TOE2, and TOE3 (CITATION). The transcript levels of all these genes except those of SMZ were not greatly changed (see Supplemental Figure 3 online), which is probably because miR172 controls its targeted genes mainly through the translational inhibition (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In addition to the miR172-AP2 module, the expression of FT is regulated by other transcriptional regulators, such as CO, FLC, SVP, and TEM (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The expression of these genes was not significantly altered in ProSUC2:RGAd17 in comparison with wild-type and ProFD:RGAd17 plants (Figure 2C). To confirm that RGA suppresses flowering through the miR172-AP2-FT module in leaves, we expressed MIR172a or FT from the SUC2 promoter in wild-type and ProSUC2:RGAd17 plants. Both ProSUC2:FT and ProSUC2:MIR172a flowered earlier than the wild type and were sufficient to suppress the late flowering phenotype of ProSUC2:RGAd17 under long-day conditions (Figure 3; see Supplemental Figure 4 online). [[FIGURE]] We have shown that ProFD:RGAd17 delays flowering at the shoot apex under both long-day and short-day conditions (Figure 1). At the shoot apex, the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase is executed by the MADS box genes, such as FUL and SOC1. We extracted the RNAs from the shoot apices of wild-type and ProFD:RGAd17 plants of different ages in short-day conditions. In 20-d-old seedlings, FUL and SOC1 transcripts accumulated to a similar level in ProFD:RGAd17 plants as in the wild type (Figures 2D and 2E). As the plants grew, the expression of FUL and SOC1 was gradually increased in the wild type. However, we did not observe the same increase in both genes in ProFD:RGAd17 plants (Figures 2D and 2E). Under long-day conditions, the expression of FUL and SOC1 was also decreased in ProFD:RGAd17 in comparison with the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). These results indicate that RGA blocks the activation of MADS box genes at the shoot apices. Consistent with this, it has been shown that the activation of SOC1 is attenuated in the ga1-3 mutant and that overexpression of SOC1 rescues the flowering phenotype of the ga1-3 plants in short-day conditions (CITATION). To understand the genetic interaction between GA and miR156, we studied the GA response of the wild type, the miR156 overexpression line (Pro35S:MIR156), in which miR156 was expressed from the 35S promoter (CITATION), and the miR156 target mimicry line (Pro35S:MIM156), which reduces miR156 activity (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). miR156 has been shown to affect leaf initiation rate (CITATION); therefore, we measured the flowering time by counting both the number of leaves and the number of days until the plants started to flower. Under long day conditions, 5-d-old seedlings were sprayed once with 50 μM of gibberellic acid (GA3). The photoperiod pathway plays a predominant role in long-day conditions; therefore, the flowering response to GA was largely masked (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). We performed the same GA treatment assay under short-day conditions. As shown in Figure 4, application of GA3 was sufficient to accelerate flowering in the wild-type plants. The number of leaves or days was accordingly decreased by 33 or 19%, respectively (Figures 4A to 4C). By contrast, Pro35S:MIR156 significantly reduced GA sensitivity. The GA3-treated Pro35S:MIR156 plants flowered almost as late as the mock-treated plants (Figures 4A and 4B; see Supplemental Figure 7 online). We only observed 4.4% reduction in the number of days and 3.7% reduction in the number of leaves (Figure 4C). [[FIGURE]] To understand whether the change in GA response of Pro35S:MIR156 plants under short-day conditions is caused by a reduction in MADS box genes, we analyzed the expression of SOC1 and FUL. We sprayed 50-d-old short-day–grown plants with 50 μM of GA3, and their shoot apices were collected after 6 h. The expression of SOC1 and FUL was elevated in the GA3-treated wild-type plants but not in Pro35S:MIR156 plants (Figures 4D and 4E). In the Arabidopsis genome, miR156-targeted SPLs can be divided into two groups, represented by SPL3 and SPL9 (CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether RGA regulates the transcription of SPLs, we analyzed the mRNAs of SPL3 and SPL9 in wild-type and Pro35S:RGAd17 plants at different time points in short-day conditions. There was no significant change in SPL9 transcript levels between wild-type and Pro35S:RGAd17 plants (Figure 5A). SPL3 exhibited a distinct expression pattern: its mRNAs gradually increased in wild-type plants but increased less in Pro35S:RGAd17 plants (Figure 5B). In agreement with this finding, a recent report has shown that SPL3 level was repressed by paclobutrazol (PAC), a GA biosynthesis inhibitor (CITATION). Compared with the wild type, the expression of DELLAs, including RGA, RGL1, and GAI, was not greatly altered in either Pro35S:MIR156 or Pro35S:MIM156 plants (Figure 5C). [[FIGURE]] To understand whether SPL affects GA biosynthesis, we monitored the expression of several GA biosynthetic genes that are highly expressed in leaves, including GA2-oxidase-1 (GA2ox-1), GA2ox-2, GA2ox-6, GA3-oxidase-1 (GA3ox-1), GA20-oxidase-1 (GA20ox-1), and GA20ox-2. GA3ox and GA20ox are responsible for the biosynthesis of bioactive GA4, whereas GA2ox catalyzes the deactivation of GA4 by oxidation (Figure 6A) (CITATION; CITATION). Compared with the wild type, the expression of the genes encoding GA2ox-1, GA3ox-1, GA20ox-1, and GA20ox-2 was not changed in either Pro35S:MIR156 or Pro35S:MIM156 plants. The transcript levels of GA2ox-2 and GA2ox-6 were moderately decreased in Pro35S:MIM156 and increased in Pro35S:MIR156 plants (Figure 6B). To test whether the change in GA2ox expression results in an increase in bioactive GA, we measured the content of GAs, including GA4, GA53, and GA12. As shown in Figure 6C, Pro35S:MIM156 and Pro35S:MIR156 plants accumulated the same amount of GA4, one of the bioactive forms of GA, as wild-type plants (Figure 6C). [[FIGURE]] To further elucidate the genetic interaction between DELLA and SPL, we overexpressed miR156 in the della pentuple mutant (Landsberg erecta [Ler] background) (CITATION). The della mutant flowered earlier than the wild type (Ler) under long-day conditions. Overexpression of MIR156 resulted in a delay of flowering in both the wild type (Ler) and della mutant background (Figures 7A and 7B; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). [[FIGURE]] SPL9 and SPL15 play a dominant role within miR156-targeted SPLs. The spl9 spl15 double mutant shows a similar but weak phenotype as the miR156 overexpression line (CITATION; CITATION). Under long-day conditions, ProSPL9:rSPL9 plants, where the miR156-resistant form of SPL9 (rSPL9) was expressed under its own regulatory sequence (CITATION), promoted flowering in long-day conditions (Figure 7C). We crossed ProSPL9:rSPL9 to ProRGA:RGAd17. ProSPL9:rSPL9 ProRGA:RGAd17 plants developed the same small dark green leaves as Pro35S:RGAd17 and flowered earlier than ProRGA:RGAd17 (Figure 7C; see Supplemental Figure 9 online). Taken together, our genetic and expression analyses indicate that miR156-targeted SPLs are essential for the floral induction by GAs and that DELLA represses flowering partially through miR156-targeted SPLs. Because of lack of a canonical DNA binding domain, DELLA regulates plant development and physiology by interacting with other transcription factors, such as PIFs, SCL3, MYC2, and JAZ (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Given the fact that both SPLs and RGA regulate the floral transition through the same downstream targets, such as miR172, FUL, and SOC1 (CITATION; CITATION), we suspected that RGA might directly bind to SPL. To test this hypothesis, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays. A strong interaction was observed when RGA was fused to GAL4 activation domain and SPL9 was fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) (Figure 8A). This interaction was compromised when the C-terminal domain of SPL9 was deleted (SPL9dC) (Figure 8B). Consistent with this finding, an SPL3 mutant that only harbors the SBP DNA binding domain also failed to interact with RGA (CITATION) (Figure 8B), suggesting that the C-terminal domain of SPL9 is responsible for its interaction with RGA. Yeast two-hybrid assays further demonstrated the widespread interactions between DELLAs and miR156-targeted SPLs (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). [[FIGURE]] To examine the interaction between SPL9 and RGA in vivo, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in Nicotiana benthamiana (CITATION). rSPL9 was in-frame fused to the N-terminal half of firefly luciferase (LUC) (rSPL9-LUCn), and RGA was fused to the C-terminal half of LUC (LUCc-RGA). Luminescence was detected when the leaves were infiltrated with LUCc-rSPL9/RGA-LUCn, but not in those infiltrated with LUCc-rSPL9/LUCn or LUCc/RGA-LUCn (Figure 8C). To further confirm the direct interaction between SPL9 and RGA, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiment using an N. benthamiana transient expression assay. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RGAd17 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rSPL9 were transiently expressed in the leaves of N. benthamiana. Protein extract of RGAd17-3xHA or RGAd17-3xHA GFP-rSPL9 was immunoprecipitated by the antibody against SPL9. In the immunoprecipitation fraction, RGAd17-3xHA was readily detected in the sample of RGAd17-3xHA GFP-rSPL9 but not in that of RGAd17-3xHA (Figure 8D). To understand whether DELLA interferes with SPL transcriptional activity, we examined the expression of SOC1 and MIR172b in ProSPL9:rSPL9 ProRGA:RGAd17 plants. Consistent with previous reports (CITATION; CITATION), the expression of SOC1 and MIR172b was upregulated in ProSPL9:rSPL9 in comparison with the wild type (Figure 9A). If DELLA interferes with the transcriptional activity of SPL, one would expect that the activation of SOC1 and MIR172b by SPL would be compromised by the increased level of RGA. Indeed, the transcripts of SOC1 and MIR172b accumulated to the same level in ProSPL9:rSPL9 ProRGA:RGAd17 as in the wild type (Figure 9A). [[FIGURE]] Next, we studied the sensitivity of wild-type, ProSPL9:rSPL9, Pro35S:MIR156 plants to PAC. To verify the treatment efficiency, we examined the expression of NOD26-LIKE INTRINSIC PROTEIN (NOD26, At4g19030) and LIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN3 (LTP3, At5g59320), both of which are the direct targets of the DELLA-PIF3 module (CITATION; CITATION). After 2 d of the treatment with PAC, the expression of NOD26 and LTP3 was greatly decreased (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). We observed a similar reduction in SOC1 and MIR172b transcripts in the PAC-treated wild-type plants, whereas the expression of both genes was insensitive to PAC in ProSPL9:rSPL9 and Pro35S:MIR156 plants (Figures 9B and 9C). To further confirm these results, we used an inducible system in which rSPL9 fused to the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was expressed under its regulatory sequence (ProSPL9:rSPL9-GR) (CITATION). Treatment with the GR ligand dexamethasone (DEX) resulted in a threefold increase in MIR172b transcripts after 12 h (Figure 9D). By contrast, we only observed a 1.5-fold induction in MIR172b when 50 μM of PAC was coapplied. Taken together, these observations indicate that a high level of RGA impairs the activation of MADS box genes and miR172 through SPL.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants, ecotypes Columbia and Ler, and Nicotiana benthamiana were grown at 21°C in long days (16-h light/8-h dark) or short days (8-h light/16-h dark). Pro35S:MIR156, Pro35S:MIM156, ProSPL9:rSPL9, and ProSPL9:rSPL9-GR have been described elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION). The della mutant (N16298) was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (www.Arabidopsis.info). For GA and PAC treatment, 50 μM of GA3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μM of PAC were used. For DEX induction experiment, 10 μM of DEX or 10 μM of DEX plus 50 μM of PAC was used. For RGAd17 constructs, RGAd17 was cloned into the binary constructs behind the RGA, SUC2, or FD promoter (CITATION). For FT and MIR172a constructs, the coding region of FT and a 410-bp fragment harboring the stem loop of MIR172a was PCR amplified and cloned into the binary construct behind the pSUC2 promoter. For yeast two-hybrid constructs, the cDNAs of SPL2, SPL3, SPL9, SPL9dC, SPL10, and SPL11 were PCR amplified and cloned into pGBKT7 or pGADT7 (Clontech). RGA was cloned into pGADT7. The pGBKT7 series of GAI, RGA, RGL1, RGL2, and RGL3 constructs was generated as described in CITATION. BiFC constructs were generated as described elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION). For CoIP constructs, RGAd17 and rSPL9 was PCR amplified and cloned into the binary constructs with 3xHA or GFP tag. The oligonucleotide primers for these constructs are given in Supplemental Table 1 online. The constructs were delivered into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by the freeze-thaw method. Transgenic plants were generated by the floral dipping method (CITATION) and were screened with 0.05% glufosinate (Basta) on soil or 50 μg/mL of hygromycin on one-half–strength Murashige and Skoog plate. Flowering time was measured by counting the total number of leaves (rosette and cauline leaves) and the number of days to flower (when the floral buds are visible). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A total of 1 μg of total RNA was DNase I–treated and used for cDNA synthesis with oligo (dT) primer and RevertAid reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). Quantitative real-time–PCR was performed with SYBR-Green PCR Mastermix (TaKaRa), and amplification was real-time monitored on Mastercycler Realplex2 (Eppendorf). Quantitative real-time PCR primers for FT, MIR172b, SOC1, FUL, SPL3, SPL9, and TUB have been described elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION). Other oligonucleotide primers are given in Supplemental Table 1 online. Plasmids were transformed into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) by the lithium chloride–polyethyleneglycol method according to the manufacturer’s manual (Clontech). The transformants were selected on SD/-Leu/-Trp plates. The interactions were tested on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His plate with 3-amino-1,2,4,-triazole (Figures 8A and 8B) or SD/-Ade/-Leu/-Trp/-His plate (see Supplemental Figure 10B online). At least 10 individual clones were analyzed. BiFC assays were performed as described in CITATION. A. tumefaciens was resuspended in infiltration buffer at OD600 = 0.8. Pro35S:P19-HA (CITATION) was coinfiltrated to inhibit gene silencing. A total of 1 mM of luciferin was infiltrated before LUC activity was monitored after 3 d. SPL9 antibody was raised against the peptide QHQYLNPPWVFKDNC, corresponding to the residues 299 to 312 of SPL9 (Willget Biotech). Agrobacteria-infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves were used for CoIP analyses. The soluble proteins were extracted in the extraction buffer (100 mM of Tris-HCl, 5 mM of EDTA, 100 mM of NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-SPL9 antibody. RGAd17-3xHA fusion proteins were detected by immunoblot with anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Roche). We harvested 2.0-g 40-d-old short-day–grown plants. Extraction and measurement of GA was performed according to a published protocol (CITATION).
