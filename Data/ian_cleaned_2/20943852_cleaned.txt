!~ABS~! The MOS4-associated complex (MAC) is a highly conserved nuclear protein complex associated with the spliceosome. We recently purified the MAC from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) nuclei, identified its potential components by mass spectrometry, and showed that at least five core proteins in the MAC are required for defense responses in plants. Here, we report the characterization of a putative RNA-binding protein identified in the MAC named MAC5A and its close homolog MAC5B. We confirmed that MAC5A is a component of the MAC through coimmunoprecipitation with the previously described MAC protein CELL DIVISION CYCLE5 from Arabidopsis. In addition, like all other characterized MAC proteins, MAC5A fused to the Green Fluorescent Protein localizes to the nucleus. Double mutant analysis revealed that MAC5A and MAC5B are unequally redundant and that a double mac5a mac5b mutant results in lethality. Probably due to this partial redundancy, mac5a and mac5b single mutants do not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to virulent or avirulent pathogen infection. However, like other MAC mutations, mac5a-1 partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive1 (snc1), a gain-of-function mutant that expresses a deregulated Resistance protein. Our results suggest that MAC5A is a component of the MAC that contributes to snc1- mediated autoimmunity.
!~RES~! We used the MAC5A protein sequence as a query in BLAST and identified two additional proteins with significant sequence similarity to MAC5A (At1g07360) encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. We named these proteins MAC5B (At2g29580) and MAC5C (At5g07060). MAC5A and MAC5B are proteins of approximately 480 amino acids in length that are 82% identical and contain a CCCH-type zinc-finger domain and an RNA recognition motif (RRM; Fig. 1A; Supplemental Fig. S1). Conversely, MAC5C is a truncated protein of 363 amino acids that contains only a zinc-finger domain and no RRM (Fig. 1A; Supplemental Fig. S1). The phylogenetic relationship between these proteins indicates that MAC5A and MAC5B are more closely related to each other than to MAC5C (CITATION; CITATION). In addition, according to publicly available microarray data (CITATION; CITATION), MAC5A and MAC5B are expressed in similar tissue types, although MAC5A is expressed at a much higher level (Supplemental Fig. S2). Conversely, MAC5C is expressed at very low levels in dry seeds, senescent leaves, and floral organs but not at all in any other tissues (CITATION; CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S2). MAC5A, MAC5B, and MAC5C share homology with the human protein RBM22/hECM2/fSAP47 (42%–50% identity at the amino acid level) and share very weak homology with the yeast protein Ecm2p/Slt11p (13%–16% identity; Supplemental Fig. S1). These proteins have been repeatedly isolated as components of the NTC/MAC in several eukaryotes (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To study the biological functions of MAC5A, MAC5B, and MAC5C, we obtained T-DNA insertion alleles from Arabidopsis seed centers. Salk_132881 (mac5a-1) carries an insertion in the second exon of MAC5A, whereas Salk_142085 (mac5a-2) and Salk_072670 (mac5a-3) carry insertions in the first intron of MAC5A (Fig. 1A). Semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR indicated that all alleles were genuine mac5a knockout mutants, as no MAC5A transcript could be detected compared with ecotype Columbia (Col-0; Supplemental Fig. S3B). The leaves of these mac5a mutants appeared slightly serrated, twisty, and often exhibited elongated petioles (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, mac5a mutants displayed shortened roots compared with Col-0 plants (Supplemental Fig. S3C), were early flowering (Supplemental Fig. S3A), and had reduced seed yield (data not shown). Only plants homozygous for the mac5a mutations displayed the same morphological phenotypes, indicating that the alleles are recessive and that the phenotypes cosegregate with the mutations. Importantly, F1 progeny from crosses between these mutants did not exhibit phenotypic complementation (Supplemental Fig. S3A), confirming that they are allelic. GK419F11 carries an insertion in the first exon of MAC5B (Fig. 1A). This particular T-DNA insertion line is annotated as also being in the promoter region of PCNA2, a locus that neighbors MAC5B in the opposite orientation on chromosome II (Supplemental Fig. S4A). Because of this, we examined the expression levels of both genes in GK419F11 compared with Col-0 using semiquantitative RT-PCR. We found that expression of MAC5B was strongly reduced in this line, whereas the expression of PCNA2 was not affected (Supplemental Fig. S4B). This indicated that GK419F11 is a null allele of MAC5B, so we named it mac5b-1. Plants homozygous for the insertion did not exhibit any aberrant phenotypes and appeared morphologically similar to wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig. 1B). Although our in silico analysis indicated that MAC5C is barely expressed in Arabidopsis, we sought to test the biological function of this locus using a knockout mutant as well. For this, we obtained WiscDsLox262F09, which carries an insertion in the fourth intron of MAC5C, very close to an intron-exon junction (Fig. 1A). Like mac5b-1 mutant plants, these mac5c-1 plants also appeared indistinguishable from Col-0 (Fig. 1B). Because of the sequence similarity between MAC5A, MAC5B, and MAC5C, we were interested to test for possible genetic redundancy between these loci. To do this, we crossed homozygous mutants together to create mac5a-1 mac5b-1, mac5a-1 mac5c-1, and mac5b-1 mac5c-1 double mutants. The mac5a-1 mac5c-1 double mutants appeared morphologically similar to mac5a-1 single mutants (Supplemental Fig. S5A), and the mac5b-1 mac5c-1 double mutants appeared morphologically similar to Col-0 wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S5B). These data suggest that there are no redundant functions shared between MAC5C and MAC5A or MAC5B. In contrast, MAC5A and MAC5B seem to perform some redundant functions in plants, as a double mac5a-1 mac5b-1 mutant is lethal. Out of 127 randomly chosen progeny from a parent that was homozygous for mac5b-1 but heterozygous for mac5a-1, 52 were wild type for MAC5A, 75 were heterozygous for mac5a-1, and none was homozygous for mac5a-1, indicating a 1:2:0 ratio rather than a normal 1:2:1 ratio. A χ2 test using these values indicates that a combination of mac5a-1 and mac5b-1 is lethal (χ2 = 3.263; P = 0.07). From another segregating population in which the parent was heterozygous for both mac5a-1 and mac5b-1, we recovered very few plants (typically one or two out of approximately 100 plants) that were homozygous for mac5a-1 and heterozygous for mac5b-1. These plants, in which there was only one functional copy of MAC5B and no functional copies of MAC5A, displayed severe developmental defects, including dwarfism, delayed growth, abnormal floral organs, and sterility (Fig. 2A). Terminal outgrowths known as enations were also observed extending from the leaf margins of these plants (Fig. 2B). To further investigate the redundant roles of MAC5A and MAC5B, we tested if overexpression of MAC5B can compensate for the loss of MAC5A in mac5a-1 mutants. For this, we stably expressed MAC5B under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus P35S promoter in homozygous mac5a-1 plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Analysis of transgenic plants revealed that expression of P35S-MAC5B was indeed able to complement mac5a-1 (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of MAC5B in the transgenics was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2C). These results further supported redundant functions between MAC5A and MAC5B and suggested that the major difference between these loci is linked to their steady-state expression levels. Thus, because a double mac5a-1 mac5b-1 mutant is lethal and overexpression of MAC5B can compensate for the loss of MAC5A, we conclude that MAC5A and MAC5B are unequally redundant, as defined by CITATION, and that MAC5A is the dominant contributor of the pair. [[FIGURE]] MOS4, AtCDC5, and MAC3A/3B are required for snc1-mediated immunity, as deduced from double mutant analysis between snc1 and mos4, Atcdc5, or mac3a mac3b mutants (CITATION; CITATION). To test if MAC5A, MAC5B, or MAC5C is likewise required for snc1 signaling, we created snc1 mac5a-1, snc1 mac5b-1, and snc1 mac5c-1 double mutants and conducted suppression analysis of snc1-related phenotypes. The loss of MAC5A (Fig. 3), but not MAC5B or MAC5C (Supplemental Fig. S6), suppressed snc1-associated dwarfism, as snc1 mac5a-1 plants were more than twice the size of snc1 (Fig. 3A). Heightened resistance to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (H.a.) isolate Noco2 and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (P.s.t.) strain DC3000 was also suppressed in snc1 mac5a-1, as indicated by quantification of pathogen growth in these genotypes compared with the Col-0 wild type. As shown in Figure 3B, whereas H.a. Noco2 was unable to colonize snc1 plants, snc1 mac5a-1 mutants were as susceptible as Col-0 to this pathogen. Infection with P.s.t. DC3000 indicated that snc1 mac5a-1 plants sustain 100-fold higher bacterial growth over 3 d compared with snc1 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR showed that the constitutive expression of PR-1 and PR-2 in snc1 is partially suppressed by mac5a-1 (Fig. 3D). Importantly, accumulation of the SNC1 transcript did not differ between the snc1 and snc1 mac5a-1 mutants (Fig. 3D), indicating that altered SNC1 expression is not the likely cause for the observed suppression. [[FIGURE]] We previously demonstrated that MAC5A and MAC5B are unequally redundant and that MAC5A is the dominant contributor. Thus, it is likely that the reason mac5b-1 was unable to suppress snc1 autoimmunity was simply due to normal expression of MAC5A in the double mutants. To investigate the role of MAC5B in snc1 autoimmunity, we stably expressed P35S-MAC5B in snc1 mac5a-1 plants and tested for restoration of the snc1 phenotype. As a control, we also stably expressed PMAC5A-MAC5A in snc1 mac5a-1. Out of 15 P35S-MAC5B transgenics, nine restored snc1 morphology (Supplemental Fig. S7). Similarly, out of 12 PMAC5A-MAC5A transgenics, nine restored snc1 morphology (Supplemental Fig. S7). These results indicate that MAC5B can function in the snc1 pathway and further demonstrate unequal genetic redundancy between MAC5A and MAC5B in Arabidopsis. Mutations in MOS4, AtCDC5, PRL1, and MAC3A/3B lead to enhanced susceptibility to pathogen infection (CITATION; CITATION). To test if any of the three MAC5 homologs are necessary for the full expression of basal defense responses in Arabidopsis, mac5a, mac5b, and mac5c mutants were challenged with P.s.t. DC3000 and bacterial growth was assayed after 3 d. We observed similar bacterial growth in Col-0 and the mutants (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S8), whereas the well-known enhanced susceptibility mutant npr1-1 (CITATION) harbored an over 10-fold higher titer of bacteria in all experiments. In addition, when we infected plants with H.a. Noco2, we consistently observed slightly higher oomycete colonization of the mac5a mutants compared with Col-0; however, this difference could not be repeatedly supported by statistical analysis (Fig. 4B). [[FIGURE]] To test if R protein-mediated defenses other than snc1 autoimmunity require MAC5A or MAC5B, we also infected plants with pathogens that express avirulence effectors specifically recognized by R proteins in Col-0. P.s.t. avrRps4 and P.s.t. avrPphB (recognized by RPS4 and RPS5, respectively) grew to similar levels in Col-0 and the mac5a and mac5b mutants (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, the H.a. isolates Emwa1 and Cala2, expressing avirulence effectors recognized by RPP4 and RPP2, respectively, grew to similar levels in Col-0 and mac5a-1 (data not shown), and both genotypes were able to mount a hypersensitive response at infection sites, as indicated by lactophenol trypan blue staining on leaf tissue 7 d after inoculation (Supplemental Fig. S9). Together, these data reveal that although MAC5A is required for snc1-mediated defense, MAC5A and MAC5B may not be required for other R protein-mediated pathways or basal defense in plants. However, the involvement of MAC5A or MAC5B in these pathways may be masked by the partial redundancy between the two loci. To confirm that MAC5A is a MAC component, we tested whether MAC5A localizes to the nucleus and if it is capable of associating with the MAC protein AtCDC5 in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. For this, we stably transformed either PMAC5A-MAC5A-GFP or PMAC5A-MAC5A-HA into mac5a-1 plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The majority of transgenic lines (24 of 25 independent GFP lines and 21 of 22 independent hemagglutinin [HA] lines) complemented mac5a-1 phenotypes such as morphology (Fig. 5A) and root length (Fig. 5B). Because these fusion proteins complemented mac5a-1 phenotypes, they should function similarly to endogenous MAC5A. We confirmed that the fusion proteins were expressed in vivo by extracting total protein from representative transgenic lines followed by western-blot analysis using antibodies against GFP or HA (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] All MAC5A-GFP complementing lines showed clear nuclear localization when viewed with a fluorescence microscope. Root cells from one representative line are shown in Figure 5C, but nuclear localization was also observed in other tissues, including leaves (data not shown). This localization was not unexpected, as the MAC5A homolog in zebrafish, RBM22, also localizes to the nucleus (CITATION), as do the MAC core proteins MOS4, AtCDC5, PRL1, and MAC3A/3B. To test if MAC5A associates with AtCDC5, we isolated total nuclear protein and immunoprecipitated MAC5A-HA using anti-HA microbeads. Western-blot analysis using an anti-AtCDC5 antibody revealed that AtCDC5 was present only in the eluted fraction from transgenic plants and not from control Col-0 plants (Fig. 6). Association between MAC5A and AtCDC5 has been shown in other eukaryotes as well (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). These data indicate that MAC5A localizes to the nucleus and associates with AtCDC5 in planta. Thus, we conclude that MAC5A is indeed a member of the MAC. [[FIGURE]] Because of the close association between the MAC and the spliceosome, we previously tested if general splicing was impaired in the MAC mutants. For this, we monitored the presence of several known alternative transcripts in MAC mutants compared with Col-0 (CITATION). We did not observe obvious differences in the presence of U1-70K, AtSRp34/SR1, or AtSRp30 alternative transcript variants (CITATION), leading us to conclude that the MAC is not required for general splicing in Arabidopsis. However, although we have been unable to show aberrations in general/constitutive splicing, the MAC as a whole appears to be essential for plant viability, as all higher order MAC mutants so far described (mos4-1 Atcdc5-1, mos4-1 prl1-1, mos4-1 mac3a mac3b, and mac3a mac3b prl1-1) result in lethality (CITATION; CITATION). Probably because of the partial redundancy between MAC5A and MAC5B, we were able to successfully isolate double mutants when we crossed mos4-1, Atcdc5-1, prl1-2, or mac3a mac3b with mac5a-1. The morphological phenotypes of the double mutants looked like a combination of phenotypes between the respective loci (Fig. 7A). The most striking phenotype was observed with mac5a-1 prl1-2 double mutant plants, which exhibited severe developmental defects and often displayed leaf enations similar to the mac5a-1/mac5a-1 MAC5B/mac5b-1 mutant. Interestingly, when we infected plants with P.s.t. DC3000 and monitored growth 3 d later, we did not observe a further increase in bacterial titer in any of the combination mutants (Supplemental Fig. S10; data not shown), indicating that the additional loss of MAC5A does not further impair basal defenses. When we tested the fidelity of the splicing machinery in these higher order MAC mutants, we again did not observe any changes in the presence of U1-70K, AtSRp34/SR1, or AtSRp30 alternative transcript variants (Fig. 7B). We also did not observe any changes in these transcripts in the mac5a-1/mac5a-1 MAC5B/mac5b-1 mutant (data not shown). These data indicate that the spliceosome is functional in MAC single and higher order mutants and further demonstrate that, individually, MOS4, AtCDC5, PRL1, MAC3A/3B, and MAC5A/5B do not contribute key functions to general splicing in plants, even though the MAC is closely associated with proteins that form the spliceosome. It is important to keep in mind, however, that our analysis is not stringent enough to observe even severalfold differences in the abundance of splice variants, so we are not able to address splicing efficiency in the MAC mutants at this time. We also cannot rule out the possible involvement of the MAC in specific splicing events such as those that may be important during the plant immune response. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were grown on soil in a 16-h-light/8-h-dark regime or on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0.5% Suc and 0.3% phytagel or 0.8% agar, depending on the experiment. Bacterial and oomycete infections were performed as described (CITATION). Briefly, bacterial pathogens were inoculated on the abaxial leaf surfaces of 4-week-old plants using a needless syringe. Leaf discs (with an area of 0.38 cm2) were collected on the day of infection (day 0) and 3 d later (day 3) from different plants. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolates were spray inoculated onto adaxial leaf surfaces of 2-week-old seedlings and stained using lactophenol trypan blue 7 d later using a protocol described by CITATION. T-DNA mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center or Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre and genotyped by PCR using primers flanking the insertions. mac5a-1 was isolated and genotyped using the primers 5′-CACTCCTTAGGGGAGGTATC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTTTAGGTGGCGACCTGG-3′. The other two alleles, mac5a-2 and mac5a-3, were identified first by phenotypic comparison with mac5a-1 and then confirmed by crossing to test for allelism. For this, homozygous mac5a-1 females were crossed with males homozygous for either the mac5a-2 or mac5a-3 allele, and the F1 progeny were analyzed for complementation. Heterozygosity at the mac5a-1 locus in the F1 plants was confirmed by genotyping. mac5b-1 was isolated and genotyped using the primers 5′-CAGCTTCAACACTAAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TAGAGTGTGGATCGAAACGG-3′. mac5c-1 was isolated and genotyped using the primers 5′-GGTCAGTGTAAAAGAGGTGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGAACCATCACTCTCTTG-3′. Isolation and genotyping of snc1 (CITATION; CITATION), mos4-1, Atcdc5-1, and prl1-2 (CITATION), and mac3a mac3b (CITATION) have been previously described, as has the isolation of npr1-1 (CITATION), eds1-2 (Col-0; CITATION), and ndr1 (CITATION). The snc1 mac5a-1, snc1 mac5b-1, and snc1 mac5c-1 double mutants were obtained by crossing a homozygous snc1 single mutant plant with homozygous mac5a-1, mac5b-1, or mac5c-1 plants. The F1 progeny were allowed to self, and the doubles were isolated in the F2 generation using a combination of phenotyping and PCR-based genotyping. A similar procedure was used to create the mac5a-1 mac5b-1, mac5a-1 mac5c-1, mac5b-1 mac5c-1, mac5a-1 mos4-1, mac5a-1 Atcdc5-1, mac5a-1 mac3a mac3b, and mac5a-1 prl1-2 double and triple mutants. All genotypes were confirmed by genotyping with mutation-specific primers. A genomic fragment spanning the full-length MAC5A gene including its native promoter was amplified from Col-0 DNA using the primers 5′-CGGGGTACCCGGTTCCAATGTCACCGGCAG-3′ (KpnI) and 5′-AAAACTGCAGCTGAGACGAACCAGTAGCTGT-3′ (PstI), cloned into pGreen0229 in frame with a C-terminal HA or GFP tag (CITATION), and confirmed by sequencing. The open reading frame of MAC5B was amplified from Col-0 cDNA using the primers 5′-CACCATGGCGCATAGAATACTGAG-3′ and 5′-TTGAGACGAACCAGTAGTAAC-3′. This Gateway-adapted PCR fragment was cloned into pENTR using the Gateway pENTR/D-Topo Kit (Invitrogen). Entry vectors were confirmed by sequencing using the M13F and M13R primers. Recombination into a destination binary vector containing a constitutive 35S promoter was carried out with Gateway LR Clonase (Invitrogen). Transgenic seedlings were selected on soil with the herbicide Basta and confirmed by PCR. For mRNA expression analysis, RNA was extracted from 20-d-old seedlings grown on MS medium using the Totally RNA Kit (Ambion). RT was performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The primers used to monitor MAC5A expression were either 5′-TGCAAGATATGTACACGACC-3′ and 5′-AGTGCCCATCTCACCAGCTT-3′ (fragment size, 525 bp) or 5′-ACGCGTCGACGATGGCTCACAGAATACTGAG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCGTCCTGAATAGCGGGAAAC-3′ (full-length transcript, 1,528 bp). The primers used for MAC5B expression were 5′-GCAAATCTGCTCTTCAAGGT-3′ and 5′-GCCGGGTACAGATCTTACAC-3′. The primers used to monitor the expression of PCNA2 were 5′-GATGGTAGCGACACTGTTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGATATCACCTGCTGTTGA-3′. The primers used to amplify PR-1, PR-2, and ACTIN1 have been described previously (CITATION). Primers used to detect alternative transcript variants for U1-70K, AtSRp34/SR1, and AtSRp30 are described by CITATION. TUBULIN was amplified using the primers 5′-ACGTATCGATGTCTATTTCAACG-3′ and 5′-ATATCGTAGAGAGCCTCATTGTCC-3′. Approximately 15 g of leaf tissue from complementing mac5a-1 plants expressing PMAC5A-MAC5A-HA was used to isolate the nuclear protein fraction with a procedure described by CITATION. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-HA microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) as described (CITATION). The eluted fraction was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by western-blot analysis using anti-HA (Roche) or anti-AtCDC5 (CITATION) antibodies.
