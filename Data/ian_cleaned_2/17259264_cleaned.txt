!~ABS~! We isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, katamari2 (kam2), that has a defect in the organization of endomembranes. This mutant had deformed endosomes and formed abnormally large aggregates with various organelles. Map-based cloning revealed that kam2 is allelic to gravitropism defective 2 (grv2). The KAM2/GRV2 gene encodes a homolog of a DnaJ domain–containing RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS-8, which is considered to play a vital role in the endocytotic pathway from the plasma membrane to lysosomes in animal cells. Immunofluorescent staining showed that KAM2/GRV2 protein localizes on punctate structures, which did not merge with any markers for Golgi, trans-Golgi network, endosomes, or prevacuolar compartments. KAM2/GRV2, which does not have a predicted transmembrane domain, was peripherally associated with the membrane surface of uncharacterized compartments. KAM2/GRV2 was expressed at the early to middle stages of seed maturation. We found kam2 mis-sorted seed storage proteins by secreting them from cells, indicating that KAM2/GRV2 is involved in the transport of the proteins into protein storage vacuoles. kam2 had another defect in embryogenesis. Half of the developing kam2-1 cotyledons grew into the opposite space of the seeds before the walking stick–shaped embryo stage. Our findings suggest that KAM2/GRV2 is required for proper formation of the endosomes involving protein trafficking to the vacuoles and determination of growth axis of the embryo.
!~RES~! GFP-2sc, which is a transgenic Arabidopsis plant that expresses vacuole-targeted GFP-2SC, gave no fluorescent vacuoles when the plants were grown under light because of the light-dependent degradation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the acidic condition of vacuoles (CITATION). Light-grown GFP-2sc, however, retains GFP fluorescence in the entire endomembranes, including ER network structures and dot-like structures of Golgi stacks in various organs (CITATION), as shown in Figures 1A, 1C, 1E, and 1G ). In this study, all fluorescent images were taken from light-grown plants. [[FIGURE]] To isolate Arabidopsis mutants that have abnormal endomembrane structures within the cells, we used M2 lines from GFP-2sc seeds that had been mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate previously (CITATION). We selected a mutant line that exhibited abnormal endomembrane structure by examining 5- to 7-d-old seedlings with a fluorescence microscope. The isolated kam2-1 mutant had GFP fluorescent aggregates (∼10 μm) in most of the cells of cotyledons (Figure 1B) and in some cells of hypocotyls (Figure 1D), trichomes (Figure 1F), and roots hairs (Figure 1H). The same phenotype was observed in another mutant allele, kam2-6, that we isolated in this study (described below). To know the three-dimensional structure of the aggregates in kam2 mutant cells, we collected the GFP fluorescent images of a series of 0.43-μm optical sections along the z axis in kam2-1 cotyledon cells, starting from the upper surface toward the bottom of cells, and then reconstituted them as a projection movie (see Supplemental Movie 1 online; Figure 2 ). An aggregate attached to the cell surface by facing a part of the inner cell surface, bulged toward the inside of the cell, and connected to the other aggregate that faced the other side of the cell. These observations imply that a part of the endomembranes dilated and/or clustered in kam2-1 cells. [[FIGURE]] To identify the components of the aggregates, we visualized various organelles in 10-d-old cotyledons of GFP-2sc (Figures 3A, 3C, 3E, and 3G ) and kam2-1 (Figures 3B, 3D, 3F, and 3H) by transient expression of marker proteins tagged with monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) (CITATION) and FM4-64 staining. Most of the mRFP fluorescent ER was completely merged with ER bodies and ER-derived organelles (CITATION) in the GFP-fluorescent aggregates, causing the ER bodies to become yellow fluorescent (Figure 3B). Some of the mRFP fluorescent organelles (Golgi stacks and peroxisomes) were engulfed by the aggregates (Figures 3D and 3F, respectively). Most of the FM4-64–stained endosomal compartments were detected as yellow fluorescent aggregates, which were found in the GFP fluorescent aggregates (Figure 3H). [[FIGURE]] A higher magnification of kam2-1 cotyledon cells showed that the FM4-64–stained sheet-like structures on the cell surface merged completely with GFP fluorescent aggregates but not with GFP fluorescent ER bodies (Figure 4B ). In kam2 cells, endosomes swelled and aggregated, while the ER, Golgi, and peroxisomes were engulfed in the aggregates. Electron microscopy showed that epidermal cells of the GFP-2sc roots were entirely occupied by a large central vacuole surrounded by thin-layered cytosol (Figure 4C). By contrast, kam2-1 root cells appeared to have abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates that contained the nucleus, many endomembranes, and fragmented vacuoles (Figure 4D). These results suggest that the aggregates in kam2-1 are composed of various organelles, including deformed endosomes in different organs. [[FIGURE]] The KAM2 gene was located in the middle of chromosome 2 between markers ER and COP1. Further mapping with 220 F2 plants that exhibited the kam2 phenotype and DNA sequencing showed a single base pair mutation from G to A in the AT2g26890 gene of kam2-1, which might cause a non-sense mutation from TGG (Trp-1767) to TGA (stop codon) (Figures 5A and 5B ). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that the mutation in the AT2g26890 gene is responsible for the kam2 phenotype, we obtained three knockout mutants (salk_078570, salk_067162, and salk_132563) of the AT2g26890 gene from the Salk T-DNA insertion lines. These mutants, each of which had T-DNA inserted into an exon of the AT2g26890 gene, were named kam2-2, kam2-3, and kam2-4 (Figure 5A). To visualize the endomembranes in these mutants, a vacuole-targeted GFP, SP-GFP-2SC, was transiently expressed in epidermal cells of leaves of each kam2 allele by particle bombardment. All kam2 alleles had the aggregates of endomembranes in the cells, as in the kam2-1 cells (see Supplemental Figures 1A to 1C online). We identified one more kam2 allele having the aggregates of endomembranes by further screening of the mutagenized pool of the GFP-2sc line. We named this mutant kam2-6 (Gln-1584 to stop) (Figures 5A and 5B; see Supplemental Figure 1D online). These results indicate that the AT2g26890 gene is responsible for the kam2 phenotype, although we did not perform the complementation test with the gene. The AT2g26890 gene was reported to be responsible for the gravitropism defective2 (grv2) mutant, which is deficient in shoot gravitropism and phototropism (CITATION). We found that all six alleles of kam2-1 to kam2-6 exhibited a defect of shoot gravitropism, as does grv2 (data not shown). Overall results indicate that the KAM2 gene is the AT2g26890 gene. The KAM2/GRV2 gene encodes a polypeptide sequence of 2555 amino acids with a single DnaJ domain (Figure 5B, gray box) (CITATION). To characterize the protein, we raised specific antibody against each peptide region that is indicated by KAM2I and KAM2C, respectively, in Figure 5B. An immunoblot analysis with both anti-KAM2I and anti-KAM2C antibodies showed that GFP-2sc accumulated a 280-kD KAM2/GRV2 protein (Figure 5C, open arrowheads). On the other hand, kam2-1 accumulated a slight amount of a 190-kD protein, which was recognized by anti-KAM2I antibody but not by anti-KAM2C (Figure 5C, closed arrowhead). This 190-kD protein was a C-terminal truncated form of KAM2/GRV2. This result suggests that the C-terminal region of KAM2/GRV2 is involved in protein stabilization and/or is essential for a function of KAM2/GRV2. Alternatively, introducing a premature stop codon might cause instability of KAM2/GRV2 transcripts. KAM2/GRV2 is a homolog of RME-8, a DnaJ domain–containing protein that is required for endocytosis and organization of endosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans (CITATION), Drosophila melanogaster (CITATION), and human (CITATION). These results imply that defects in membrane trafficking or endosomal organization cause the abnormal endomembrane structure in the Arabidopsis kam2 mutant. To determine whether KAM2/GRV2 is associated with the membrane fraction, we prepared the microsomal and soluble fractions from Arabidopsis seedlings by ultracentrifugation and subjected them to immunoblot analysis. Most of KAM2/GRV2 protein was detected in the microsomal fraction (Figure 6A , P100), and a small portion was detected in the soluble fraction (Figure 6A, S100). This result suggests that most of KAM2/GRV2 protein localizes on the membrane and a small amount in cytosol. To determine how KAM2/GRV2 was associated on the membrane, we extracted KAM2/GRV2 from the microsomes under various conditions, as shown in Figure 6B. A portion of KAM2/GRV2 was extracted from the microsomal fraction of wild-type seedlings by alkaline pH (pH 11) or nonionic detergent (Triton X) but not by high salt (NaCl). All of the KAM2/GRV2 was extracted with an ionic detergent (SDS). This profile was the different from that of an integral membrane protein, Arabidopsis VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR (VSR) (CITATION) (Figures 6A and 6B). This is consistent with a hydropathy plot analysis predicting that KAM2/GRV2 has no transmembrane domain (data not shown). These results suggest that KAM2/GRV2 is a peripheral membrane protein rather than an integral membrane protein. [[FIGURE]] Microsomes from seedlings were further fractionated on a sucrose density gradient. Figure 7A shows that the sedimentation pattern of KAM2/GRV2 was similar but not identical to those of VSR (a PVC/trans-Golgi network [TGN] marker) (CITATION) and VAM3 (a PVC/vacuolar membrane marker) (CITATION) and was completely different from that of PROTEIN DISULFIDE ISOMERASE (PDI; an ER marker). To determine the intracellular localization of KAM2/GRV2, we immunostained protoplasts of Arabidopsis cultured cells that expressed a fluorescent-tagged marker for each organelle. Anti-KAM2I antibody stained many punctate structures within the cells (Figures 7B to 7H, left panels), while preimmune serum for KAM2I did not stain any structures (data not shown). These punctate structures merged with none of KAM1ΔC-mRFP (Figure 7B, Golgi complex), Ara6-GFP (Figure 7C, endosome), GFP-Ara7 (Figure 7D, endosome), GFP-PEP12 (Figure 7E, PVC), GFP-VAM3 (Figure 7F, PVC and vacuolar membrane), and GFP-SYP41 (Figure 7G, TGN). Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment, which inhibits guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of ADP-ribosylation G protein activity, induced the formation of the BFA compartment that includes the Golgi complex (Figure 7H, KAM1ΔC-mRFP) and endosomes (CITATION). The KAM2/GRV2 punctate structures did not change their structures by BFA treatment (Figure 7H, KAM2). These results suggest that KAM2/GRV2 localizes on the unknown punctate compartments. [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that RME-8, a homolog of KAM2/GRV2, plays a vital role in endocytosis in animal cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). This implied that KAM2/GRV2 is involved in intracellular trafficking in Arabidopsis. For investigating intracellular trafficking, maturing seeds are an ideal material because they actively synthesize a large amount of storage proteins on ER as a precursor form and then deliver them to the protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), in which the precursors are converted into the mature form (CITATION). Vacuolar sorting deficiency should cause the accumulation of storage protein precursors in dry seeds. Wild-type seeds accumulated the mature forms of major storage proteins: 12S globulin (α- and β-subunits) and 2S albumin (the large and small subunits) (Figure 8 , CBB, lane 1). On the other hand, seeds of kam2 alleles accumulated 17-, 49-, 51-, and 54-kD proteins in addition to the mature storage proteins (Figure 8, CBB, lanes 3 to 6). An immunoblot analysis showed that these additional proteins in kam2 seeds were the precursors of storage proteins (Figure 8, anti-12S and anti-2S, lanes 3 to 6). kam2 seeds abnormally accumulated the precursors, as did seeds of atvsr1-2 that lacks a vacuolar sorting receptor for storage proteins (CITATION). This result suggests that kam2 has a defect in the vacuolar sorting of storage proteins in maturing seeds. [[FIGURE]] The morphologies of autofluorescent PSVs showed that kam2-1 PSVs were deformed (Figure 9B ), suggesting that KAM2/GRV2 is essential for the proper formation of PSVs. Electron microscopy revealed that the extracellular space of kam2-1 (Figure 9D, arrows) was abnormally enlarged and filled with electron-dense material compared with GFP-2sc (Figure 9C). Immunogold analysis of kam2-1 seeds indicated that this electron-dense material has high concentrations of the storage proteins 12S globulin (Figure 9F, arrow) and 2S albumin (Figure 9H, arrow). The storage proteins were distributed in the PSVs and the electron-dense extracellular space in the kam2-1 seeds. These observations indicate that the kam2-1 mutant mis-sorts the storage proteins by secreting them from cells, resulting in a swelled and electron-dense extracellular space in the seeds (Figures 9D, 9F, and 9H). These results indicate that KAM2/GRV2 is involved in the trafficking of both 12S globulin and 2S albumin to PSVs in the cells of maturing seeds. [[FIGURE]] Figure 10 shows the developmental change in the level of KAM2/GRV2 during embryogenesis and seed maturation. Arabidopsis siliques were harvested at sequential stages from young flowers (lane 1) to mature yellow siliques (lane 12) and then were subjected to immunoblots. The amount of KAM2/GRV2 reached a maximum before the accumulation of VSR, 12S globulin, and αTIP (KAM2, lanes 5 to 7). VAM3, which is required for vacuolar trafficking from the PVC, accumulated in association with the accumulation of KAM2/GRV2. The stages of developing embryos for lanes 5 to 7 were estimated to be between the torpedo-shaped and the full-sized embryo stages, considering the accumulation profile of δVPE, which is known to reach a maximum at the heart-shaped embryo stage (CITATION). This result suggests that KAM2/GRV2 functions in intracellular trafficking at torpedo-shaped to full-sized embryo stages. [[FIGURE]] We found that kam2 showed an embryo-defective phenotype (Figure 11 ). The kam2 embryo (Figures 11E and 11F) grew normally from the heart-shaped to the torpedo-shaped embryo stages, as did wild-type embryo (Figures 11A and 11B). Afterward, however, approximately half of the kam2-1 embryos started to bend retrorsely before the walking stick–shaped embryo stage (Figure 11G), and the developing cotyledons grew into the opposite space within the seeds (Figure 11H). The other half of the kam2-1 embryo grew normally (Figures 11I and 11J), as did the wild-type embryo (Figures 11C and 11D). Consequently, almost half of kam2 seeds acquired an aberrant shape (Figure 11L, asterisks). The defect of growth axis of embryo was observed in other kam2 alleles (kam2-2, kam2-3, kam2-4, and kam2-6) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The deformed seeds normally germinated and grew as did wild-type seeds (data not shown). This result suggests that KAM2/GRV2 is required for endomembrane organization that supports determination of the growth axis of the embryo between the late torpedo-shaped embryo stage and the walking stick–shaped embryo stage.

!~MM~! We used wild-type plants of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia [Col] and Landsberg erecta) and a transgenic plant of Arabidopsis (ecotype Col) that expresses SP-GFP-2SC, which is composed of a signal peptide and GFP followed by vacuolar targeting signal derived from pumpkin (Cucurbita sp) 2S albumin (CITATION). We designated this transgenic plant GFP-2sc. Growth conditions of the plants were the same as described previously (CITATION). Protoplasts were prepared from Arabidopsis cultured cells that had been subcultured and were incubated in medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts, B5 vitamins, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.4 M mannitol, as described previously (CITATION). We used M2 lines from GFP-2sc seeds that had been mutagenized previously (CITATION). We examined 5- to 7-d-old seedlings with a fluorescence microscope and selected a mutant line that exhibited abnormal endomembrane structure, and we named the mutants kam, after the Japanese word for aggregate. We isolated two kam2 mutants (kam2-1 and kam2-6). We obtained T-DNA insertion mutants from the ABRC at Ohio State University: salk_078570 (kam2-2), salk_067162 (kam2-3), and salk_132563 (kam2-4). We transiently transformed protoplasts from Arabidopsis cultured cells with each of the chimeric genes for expression of GFP or mRFP-tagged organelle markers (KAM1ΔC-mRFP, Ara6-GFP, GFP-Ara7, GFP-PEP12, GFP-VAM3, and GFP-SYP41) using polyethylene glycol as described previously (CITATION). The protoplasts were fixed with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 5 mM EGTA in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 1 h. The fixed cells were treated with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min and then with 2% BSA and 1% sheep serum (Chemicon) in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. The cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-KAM2I antibody or preimmune serum (diluted 1:100). After washing with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20, the cells were incubated for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:300; Alexa Fluor 546; Molecular Probes). All antibodies were diluted with Solution B of an immunostaining kit (Can Get Signal Immunostain; Toyobo). The cells were washed and then inspected with a confocal laser scanning microscope and a DIC microscope. Alternatively, we treated protoplasts expressing KAM1ΔC-mRFP with 100 μg/mL of BFA for 2 h and then stained with anti-KAM2I antibody. Rosette leaves of 1- to 2-week-old GFP-2sc and kam2-1 plants were transformed with each chimeric gene for transient expression of mRFP-tagged organelle markers (ER-targeted mRFP, Golgi-targeted mRFP, and peroxisome-targeted mRFP) by particle bombardment, as described previously (CITATION). For staining of the plasma membrane and endosomes, 15-d-old seedlings were incubated in Murashige and Skoog medium containing 10 μM FM4-64 for 15 min. Cells were inspected with a confocal laser scanning microscope and a DIC microscope. The fluorescent images were inspected with a confocal laser scanning microscope (model LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss) using the 488-nm line of a 40-mW Ar/Kr laser or the 544-nm line of a 1-mW He/Ne laser with either a ×100 oil immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture) or a ×40 dry objective (0.75 numerical aperture). Image analysis was performed using LSM image examiner software (Carl Zeiss). The data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems). Map-based cloning of the KAM2 gene was performed essentially as described previously (CITATION). We used codominant cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers (CITATION) and simple sequence length polymorphism markers (CITATION). Twenty recombinants of the F2 progeny were screened for the kam2 phenotype for rough mapping. The position of the KAM2 gene was located in the middle of chromosome 2. For fine-scale mapping, DNA was isolated from 220 plants of the F2 progeny. Nucleotide sequences were determined from both strands using an ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequence Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer (model 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings (∼3 g fresh weight) were minced on ice in 10 mL of buffer A (100 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and proteinase inhibitors [Complete; Roche]). The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 2000g for 20 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C to obtain a microsomal pellet. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of each solution of buffer A, high salt buffer (1 M NaCl plus buffer A), alkaline buffer (0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11, 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM EGTA, and 5 mM MgCl2), Triton X-100 buffer (1% [v/v] Triton X-100 plus buffer A), and SDS buffer (1% [v/v] SDS plus buffer A). These suspensions were incubated for 10 min and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C to obtain supernatant and pellet fractions. Subcellular fractionation of the seedlings was performed with a linear sucrose density gradient (10 to 50% [w/w]) essentially as described previously (CITATION). Centrifugation was performed in an SW28.1 rotor (Beckman) at 27,000 rpm for 13 h at 4°C, and 0.75-mL fractions were collected with a piston gradient fractionator (TOWA LABO). We bacterially synthesized two polypeptides that were derived from KAM2: KAM2I (Leu-700 to Gly-1030) and KAM2C (Thr-2282 to Pro-2554). These polypeptides were conjugated with BSA and then injected into a rabbit subcutaneously with complete Freund's adjuvant. After 3 weeks, two booster injections with incomplete adjuvant were given at 7-d intervals. Two weeks after the booster injections, blood was drawn and the antiserum was prepared. We purified the antiserum and preimmune serum with Protein-G Sepharose 4Fast Flow (Amersham). Protein extracts from dry seeds (two grains) of wild-type (Col-0), GFP-2sc, atvsr1, and kam2 mutants were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblot analysis. The wild-type siliques were harvested at various stages of seed development, and one-tenth of total proteins from each silique was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Subcellular fractions from seedlings were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoreactive signals were detected with the ECL detection system (Amersham). Antibodies used were anti-2S albumin (diluted 1:5000), anti-12S globulin α-subunit (1:100,000) (CITATION), anti-δVPE (1:10,000) (CITATION), anti-VSR1 (1:10,000) (CITATION), anti-αTIP (1:2000) (CITATION), anti-ALEU (1:10,000; mAb 2F5) (CITATION), anti-VAM3 (1:10,000) (CITATION), anti-PDI (1:20,000) (Rose Biotechnology), anti-KAM2I (1:250), and anti-KAM2C (1:250). Dry seeds and roots from 7-d-old seedlings of GFP-2sc and kam2-1 were fixed for 2 h with 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Procedures for electron microscopy were essentially the same as those described previously (CITATION). The ultrathin sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (model JEM-1011; JEOL) at 100 kV. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (CITATION), except for the dilutions of antibodies anti-12S globulin (1:2000), anti-2S albumin (1:1000), and AuroProbe EM Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:30, 15 nm gold; Amersham). Maturing seeds from GFP-2sc and kam2-1 were cleared by incubation in Hoyer's solution overnight (7.5 g gun arabic, 100 g chloral hydrate, and 5 mL glycerol in 30 mL water) and then inspected with a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (model DXM1200; Nikon) as described previously (CITATION). To observe PSVs, dry seeds from GFP-2sc and kam2-1 were pressed in glycerol between the slide glass and cover slip to push out cotyledons. The cotyledons were inspected with a confocal laser scanning microscope (model LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss) using the 488-nm line as described previously (CITATION).
