!~ABS~!  Mokeem‐Saleh A, Hammad M, Silikas N, Qualtrough A, Watts DC. A laboratory evaluation of the physical and mechanical properties of selected root canal sealers. International Endodontic Journal, 43, 882–888, 2010.  Aim To evaluate and compare the porosity, degree of conversion (DC) and hardness of two resin‐based sealers; RealSeal and EndoRez, and a silicon‐based sealer; GuttaFlow to that of a traditional zinc oxide‐based sealer; TubliSeal.  Methodology For porosity, four samples from each sealer were prepared and scanned using a SkyScan 1072 Micro‐CT. Porosity was then calculated using specialized software. For DC, 10 samples from each sealer were prepared and placed onto a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrometer. Spectra readings were carried out before and after curing of the sealers, and the DC for each sealer was calculated. For hardness, 10 samples from each sealer were prepared and then tested using a Wallace hardness tester. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis of the data using one‐way anova and independent t‐tests.  Results TubliSeal had the highest percentage porosity (3.52%), whilst RealSeal had the lowest percentage porosity (0.41%). Statistically significant differences (P = 0.01) in porosity were present between all groups except between RealSeal and EndoRez groups. RealSeal exhibited a significantly higher DC% than EndoRez (P = 0.01), whereas EndoRez had the highest hardness number [28.54 Vickers hardness number (VHN)] whilst TubliSeal showed the lowest (13.57 VHN). Statistically significant differences in hardness were found between all groups (P = 0.01) except between RealSeal and EndoRez groups.  Conclusions Resin‐based sealers had less porosity, greater hardness and a high DC. 
!~RES~! Results obtained from the three tests are shown in Table 3.  TubliSeal had the highest percentage porosity (3.52%), whilst RealSeal had the lowest percentage porosity (0.41%). Statistically significant differences (P = 0.01) in porosity were present between all groups except between RealSeal and EndoRez groups.  In addition, RealSeal exhibited a significantly higher DC% than EndoRez (P = 0.01), whereas EndoRez had the highest hardness number (28.54 VHN) whilst TubliSeal showed the lowest (13.57 VHN). Statistically significant differences in hardness were found between all groups (P = 0.01) except between RealSeal and EndoRez groups. 
!~MM~! Sealers tested are listed in Table 1.  The experiment was performed under standardized laboratory conditions in keeping with ISO 6876/86 regulations. Cylindrical stainless steel split ring moulds were used to produce cylindrical test specimens (6.0 ± 0.1 mm height and 4 ± 0.1 mm diameter). A single operator prepared the samples in keeping with the instructions of the manufacturers in terms of proportions, times and mixing techniques. Moulds were lubricated and once the mixed sealer was ready, a spatula was used to fill the ring mould with the sealer. The spatula was placed vertically in the centre of the ring mould allowing its tip to touch the glass slabs. The sealer was allowed to flow down and filled the mould under gravity. No vibration or pressure was applied. Mixed sealers were placed until slightly overfilled, then a thin polyethylene film and a glass plate were placed on each side of the mould and all were held firmly together with a clamp. The mould and clamp were transferred to an incubator at 95–100% relative humidity and kept at 37 °C (±1 °C) for at least three times longer than the setting time as stated by the manufacturer. Specimens were then removed from the moulds. Four samples for each group were prepared.  Prepared samples were scanned using a Micro‐CT scanner (SkyScan 1072; Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Scanning parameters are listed in Table 2. Images were reconstructed using NRecon software (Skyscan) providing 2D slices of the inner structure of the samples (Fig. 1). Finally the CTan and CTVol software (Skyscan) were used for 3‐dimensional volumetric visualization (Fig. 2), analysis and measurement of % porosity.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The DC% of the tested sealers was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrometer (Avatar™ 360; Nicolet Analytical Instruments, Chester, UK). Ten samples were made from each sealer. An initial background FTIR reading was first recorded. Each sealer was mixed following the manufacturer’s instructions and placed on the surface of the detector crystal of the FTIR spectroscope and covered to prevent light interference. A before‐curing reading was recorded and then the samples were left to set. FTIR recordings were taken after 1, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h.  The DC% was calculated from the aliphatic C=C peak at 1638 cm and normalized against the aromatic C=C peak at 1608 cm according to following formula:  The peak intensities as ratios of the uncured and cured material were calculated, and the DC was expressed in percentage relative to the uncured state. The hardness test was carried out only on the two resin‐based sealers; RealSeal and EndoRez, as C=C bonds are only available in these sealers.  Ten samples were made from each sealer for hardness testing. Teflon moulds were constructed to obtain cylindrical samples (3.0 ± 0.1 mm height and 10 ± 0.1 mm diameter). Materials were mixed following the manufacturers’ instructions and were placed into the moulds until slightly overfilled, then a thin polyethylene film and a Teflon sheet was placed on each side of the mould and all were held firmly together with a clamp. The mould and clamp were transferred to an incubator at 95–100% relative humidity and kept at 37 °C (±1 °C) for at least three times longer than the setting time as stated by the manufacturer. Specimens were then removed from the moulds.  Hardness testing was accomplished by using a Wallace Hardness Tester® (H.W. Wallace & Co. Ltd., Kingston, UK). Samples were positioned and immobilized in the tester so that the test surface of the sealer was oriented perpendicular to the indenter axis. The indenter was then brought into contact with the sample surface, and a load of 1 g was applied for 5 s to ensure contact between indenter and surface of sample. The depth of indenter was adjusted to zero, and then a load of 300 g was applied for 10 s, after which the depth of indenter was recorded from the dial gauge and later converted into reciprocal penetration (mm−1). Hardness is 1/penetration, so the reading of the dial gauge penetration was divided by 3937 and then the reciprocal calculated to determine the Vickers hardness number (VHN).  Each sample received a series of four indentations. The mean for each sample was calculated. Overall, hardness testing was carried out 40 times for each material.  The hardness test was carried out on the two resin‐based sealers; RealSeal and EndoRez and on the zinc oxide‐based sealer; TubliSeal. It was not possible to conduct the test on GuttaFlow because of its elastic nature.  One‐way analysis of variance (one‐way anova) with Bonferroni post hoc test and independent t‐tests were carried out to compare the means using SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) at P = 0.05.
