!~ABS~! B-box containing proteins play an important role in light signaling in plants. Here, we identify LIGHT-REGULATED ZINC FINGER1/SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG3 (STH3), a B-box encoding gene that genetically interacts with two key regulators of light signaling, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1). STH3 physically interacts with HY5 in vivo and shows a COP1-dependent localization to nuclear speckles when coexpressed with COP1 in plant cells. A T-DNA insertion mutant, sth3, is hyposensitive to high fluence blue, red, and far-red light and has elongated hypocotyls under short days. Analyses of double mutants between sth3, sth2, and hy5 suggest that they have partially overlapping functions. Interestingly, functional assays in protoplasts suggest that STH3 can activate transcription both independently and together with STH2 through the G-box promoter element. Furthermore, sth3 suppresses the cop1 hypocotyl phenotype in the dark as well as the anthocyanin accumulation in the light. Finally, COP1 ubiquitinates STH3 in vitro, suggesting that STH3 is regulated by COP1. In conclusion, we have identified STH3 as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis acting in concert with STH2 and HY5, while also being a target of COP1-mediated ubiquitination.
!~RES~! The B-box containing proteins SALT TOLERANCE (STO), STH1, and COL3 were identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using COP1 as bait (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). Interestingly, two related proteins, STH2 and LZF1/STH3, had previously been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using HY5 as bait; however, in each case, the cDNAs had 5′ untranslated region sequences that put them out of frame from the activation domain (T. Oyama, personal communication). STH3 showed highest conservation in the N-terminal B-boxes that had 64, 61, and 55% amino acid identity with those of STO, STH1, and STH2, respectively (Figure 1A ). To confirm and further characterize the interaction between HY5 and STH3, we inserted the STH3 cDNA into the pYX242 yeast expression vector and assayed its interaction with HY5 in liquid β-gal assays (Figure 1B). The STH3 protein expressed from the pYX242 vector did not activate transcription together with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-DBD) vector control but resulted in a 49-fold increase in β-Gal activity over the vector control when expressed together with Gal4-DBD-HY5. [[FIGURE]] To map the protein domains responsible for the interaction between HY5 and STH3, we examined the interactions between wild-type and mutated HY5 and STH3 proteins in β-Gal assays. To this end, we used Gal4-DBD fusions of full-length HY5 and two truncated HY5 proteins with either the leucine zipper domain (amino acids 115 to 168) or the basic zipper domain (amino acids 77 to 168) deleted. Deletion of the zipper domain or the basic zipper domain in HY5 resulted in a dramatic reduction in β-Gal activity, indicating that the basic zipper domain is required for the interaction with STH3 (Figure 1B, cf. HY5, HY5Δ116-168, and HY5Δ78-168 with STH3). To further characterize the interaction between HY5 and STH3, we individually substituted three conserved Asp residues in the B-boxes of STH3 to Ala (Figure 1A); two of these residues (D20 and D72) correspond to Zn2+ ligating residues in the B-box protein MID1 (CITATION), and substitution of these is likely to disrupt the structure of the B-box. The substituted proteins were named STH3-D20A, -D72A, and -D81A (Figures 1A and 1B). Interestingly, we found that D72A and D81A substitutions resulted in a dramatic reduction of β-Gal activity compared with wild-type levels; however, the D20A mutation, despite disrupting a Zn2+ ligating residue, did not affect the interaction between STH3 and HY5 (Figure 1B). This suggests that the tandem repeated B-boxes have different functions: while the second B-box in STH3 is required for interaction with HY5, the first B-box is not. Finally, we examined whether STH3 could interact with HYH, the bZIP protein most closely related to HY5 in Arabidopsis, in yeast two-hybrid assays. We found a 30-fold increase in relative β-Gal activity, indicating that STH3 indeed could interact also with HYH (Figure 1B). Together, these results suggest that the basic zipper domain in HY5 and the second B-box in STH3 are important for the HY5–STH3 interaction and that STH3 can interact also with the related HYH protein. HY5 localizes to the nucleus and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-HY5 gives a diffused nuclear fluorescence when expressed in onion epidermal cells, whereas GFP-COP1 localizes to discrete nuclear speckles (CITATION). To determine the subcellular localization of the STH3 protein and further characterize its interactions with HY5 and possibly with COP1, we prepared a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fusion of STH3 and expressed it in onion epidermal cells. STH3, like HY5, localizes uniformly throughout the nucleus (Figure 2A ). Since the proteins interact in yeast assays and both proteins give a diffuse nuclear fluorescence, we proceeded to examine whether they physically interact in the nucleus. To this end, we examined if fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurred between the two fusion proteins using the acceptor photobleaching technique. Here, we coexpressed CFP-STH3 with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-fused HY5 and excited them with 405- and 514-nm lasers. Both CFP and YFP fluorescence was detected before the bleach (Figure 2A, top panels). After raising the intensity of the 514-nm laser, the YFP fluorescence from the acceptor, YFP-HY5, was bleached (Figure 2A, bottom panel). The bleaching of the acceptor resulted in an increased emission from CFP-STH3, as shown in Figures 2A and 2B, indicating that FRET had occurred between the two proteins prior to the bleach. In control photobleaching experiments using the same microscope settings, we did not detect FRET between unfused CFP and YFP or between YFP-STH3 and CFP-STH2 (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). [[FIGURE]] COP1 has previously been shown to recruit HY5 and several other interacting proteins to nuclear speckles (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since STH3 showed a localization pattern similar to HY5, we wanted to check if and how COP1 affected STH3 localization in vivo. To this end, we coexpressed nontagged COP1 (35S COP1) with YFP-STH3 in onion epidermal cells. Interestingly, upon coexpression of COP1, we found consistent nuclear speckles in addition to a weak uniform fluorescence (Figure 2C). The detection of nuclear speckles when STH3 is coexpressed with untagged COP1 suggests a COP1-dependent recruitment of STH3 into COP1 speckles. Coexpression of CFP-COP1 also resulted in localization of YFP-STH3 into nuclear speckles; however, we did not detect any FRET in these experiments (data not shown). To examine the role of STH3 in light-regulated development, we obtained a T-DNA insertion line (SALK_105367) in the STH3 gene (At1g78600) from the SALK collection. The STH3 gene is located on the bottom arm of chromosome I and contains three exons. We PCR amplified and sequenced the T-DNA flanking sequence and found that the insertion was present in the first intron of the STH3 gene (Figure 3A ). The insertion results in a total loss of STH3 mRNA (Figure 3A), indicating that it is a null mutation. This null mutant is the same as the lzf1-1 allele described by CITATION and was named sth3 to conform with the nomenclature of the previously identified B-box proteins homologous to STO. Homozygous sth3 plants were obtained and confirmed by PCR-based genotyping since the kanamycin resistance of this mutant had been lost. [[FIGURE]] The homozygous sth3 mutants were germinated in different fluences of monochromatic blue, red, and far-red light to examine if STH3 plays a role in light-mediated seedling development. We found that sth3 had longer hypocotyls under high fluence blue, red, and far-red light (Figures 3B to 3D). In blue light, at a fluence level of 30 μmol/m2/s, the sth3 seedlings were 24% longer than the Columbia (Col-0) seedlings, and in high fluence red light, the sth3 seedlings had 9% longer hypocotyls compared with the wild type (Figures 3B and 3C). Similar phenotypes were seen under high fluence far-red light, with sth3 seedlings being 21% longer than the wild type (Figure 3D). At very low fluence levels, the hypocotyl length in the sth3 mutant was similar to the wild type, suggesting that sth3 is specifically hyposensitive to higher fluence levels of light. Together, these phenotypes suggest that STH3 acts as a positive regulator of light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. We then examined sth3 seedlings grown in white light under different daylength conditions (Figure 4 ). We found that the sth3 mutant showed 21% elongated hypocotyl compared with the wild type under short-day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark). Interestingly, in most light conditions where we saw a phenotype in the sth3 mutant we had previously seen phenotypes in the sth2 mutant as well (CITATION). We therefore made and examined the sth2 sth3 double mutant. We found that while the sth2 single mutant was 21% elongated compared with the wild type, the sth3 sth2 double mutant seedlings had a more pronounced phenotype with 77% longer hypocotyls than the wild type (Figure 4A). To confirm that any observed phenotypes were indeed due to the disruption of the STH3 gene, a 3.3-kb genomic EcoRI fragment containing the STH3 gene and 1-kb sequence both upstream and downstream of the gene (Figure 3A) was introduced into the sth3 mutant as well as each of the sth3 double mutants. For this we used the pFP100 vector encoding GFP from a seed-specific promoter, thus allowing identification and analysis of transformed seeds in the T1 generation (CITATION). The long hypocotyl phenotypes of the sth3 and sth3 sth2 double mutants could be complemented in T1 transgenic seedlings transformed with pFP100-STH3, indicating that the phenotypes were caused by the T-DNA insertion in sth3 (Figure 4C). Since STH3 and HY5 physically interact in yeast and in plant cells, we generated a sth3 hy5 double mutant to examine the genetic interactions between HY5 and STH3. Homozygous sth3 hy5-215 double mutants were germinated in different light conditions together with the single mutants and the wild type (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4D to 4G). Since sth3 showed a hyposensitive phenotype under short-day conditions, we checked the sth3 hy5-215 double mutant phenotype in short days. Interestingly, the double mutant had 12% longer hypocotyls than hy5-215 (Figure 4A). We further generated the sth2 sth3 hy5-215 triple mutant and analyzed its phenotypes. In short days, the triple mutant looked similar to either of the double mutants sth2 hy5-215 and sth3 hy5-215 (Figure 4A). [[FIGURE]] When grown in constant white light or under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark), we did not find a significant difference between wild-type and sth3 seedlings and the hypocotyl length of sth2 sth3 double mutant was similar to that of sth2-1. By contrast, the sth3 hy5-215 seedlings had 26% longer hypocotyls than the hy5-215 single mutant seedlings, indicating that both genes had independent effects. However, the absence of phenotypes in sth3 suggests that the loss of STH3 alone could be compensated for by HY5 (Figure 4B). This was very similar to the effect seen in the sth2 hy5 double mutants previously (CITATION). Interestingly, the sth2 sth3 hy5-215 triple mutant had 12 and 14% longer hypocotyls than either of the double mutants sth2 hy5 and sth3 hy5, respectively, suggesting a synergistic relationship between the three genes (Figure 4B). Also, the long hypocotyl phenotype of the sth3 hy5 double mutant could be complemented in T1 transgenic sth3 hy5 seedlings transformed with pFP100-STH3; however, here, we observed that the sth3 hy5 STH3 seedlings were shorter than the sth3 hy5 seedlings at 2.2 ± 0.08 mm compared with 2.8 ± 0.06 mm (Figure 4D). In high fluence monochromatic blue, red, and far-red light, the sth3 mutant showed an elongated hypocotyl phenotype although the effect was quite subtle. However, in all the light conditions tested, the sth3 sth2 double mutant seedlings had longer hypocotyls than either of the single mutants. When grown under high fluence monochromatic blue light, the sth3 sth2 double mutant had 75 and 19% more elongated hypocotyls than the sth3-1 and sth2-1 seedlings, respectively. Under red light, the loss of both STH2 and STH3 in the double mutant enhanced the long hypocotyl phenotype of sth2-1 by 25%, while in far-red light, the double mutant showed twofold enhancement in the hypocotyl length compared with the sth3-1 single mutant. This indicates that STH2 can partially compensate for the loss of STH3 but the loss of both results in an enhanced effect. Together, all these results indicate that STH3 and STH2 together play a role in light-mediated signaling and have partially overlapping functions. We also checked for sth3 hy5-215 double mutant phenotypes under different monochromatic light conditions and found that in blue, red, and far-red light, the sth3 hy5 double mutant had 12, 6, and 23% longer hypocotyls than hy5-215 (Figures 4E to 4G). Additive effects seen in the double mutants between sth3 and hy5 under different light conditions indicate that STH3 and HY5 might function independently. Analysis of the sth2 sth3 hy5-215 triple mutant showed that under all the monochromatic light conditions, the triple mutant had longer hypocotyls than either of the double mutants sth2 hy5 and sth3 hy5, although the effect was quite small. (Figures 4E to 4G) All these results together indicate a partially overlapping, partially parallel relationship between STH2, STH3, and HY5 in regulating photomorphogenesis. The COP1-dependent localization of STH3 in onion epidermal cells prompted us to examine the genetic relationship between the two mutants. To this end, we generated double mutants between sth3, cop1-6, and cop1-4. Both cop1-6 and cop1-4 are weak viable alleles of cop1, cop1-6 has a splice site mutation that results in a five–amino acid insertion after Gln-301 before the WD40 domain, whereas cop1-4 has a premature stop codon at amino acid 283 and thus lacks the WD40 domain (CITATION). cop1 mutants show a very dramatic phenotype in the dark wherein they have short hypocotyls and open expanded cotyledons. On the other hand, sth3 does not show any significant difference from the wild type when grown in the dark (Figures 5A and 5B ). We found that while the sth3 cop1-4 double mutant behaved as cop1-4, the sth3 cop1-6 double mutant had 36% longer hypocotyls than the cop1-6 single mutant seedlings when germinated in the dark (Figures 5A to 5D). The suppression was caused by the sth3 mutation since the hypocotyls of sth3 cop1-6 seedlings transformed with pFP100-STH3 were indistinguishable from cop1-6 seedlings (Figures 5C and 5D). Interestingly, although sth3 did not suppress cop1-4, the triple mutant sth2-1 sth3 cop1-4 strongly suppressed the dark phenotype of cop1-4, and the sth2-1 sth3 cop1-6 triple mutant showed a stronger suppression of the cop1-6 phenotype (Figures 5A and 5B). These results indicate that sth3 act as a suppressor of cop1 in the dark and shows that the loss of both B-box proteins STH2 and STH3 enhance the suppression of cop1 in the dark (Figures 5A and 5B). Furthermore, the results suggest that STH3 and STH2 might be targets of COP1 degradation, and the finding that the length of the hypocotyls in the triple mutants approaches that of the wild type suggests that their misregulation in cop1 is an important factor for the short hypocotyls of cop1 in the dark. [[FIGURE]] Both hy5 and cop1 show altered levels of anthocyanin accumulation. While hy5 has reduced levels, cop1 accumulates more anthocyanin than the wild type. Since sth3 was found to genetically interact with both hy5 and cop1, we decided to examine the role of sth3 in anthocyanin accumulation. To this end, seedlings were grown in different light conditions for 3 d and then their anthocyanin levels were measured (Figure 6 ). The pattern of anthocyanin accumulation looked quite similar for the different mutants in all the light conditions; however, the strongest phenotypes were seen in constant red light. As observed by CITATION, the anthocyanin accumulation in the sth3 seedlings did not differ significantly from that of the Col-0 wild-type under high fluence red light (Figure 6). While the sth2 mutant accumulated 51% less anthocyanin than the wild type, the levels were 61% lower in the sth3 sth2 double mutant. Anthocyanin levels were measured in the sth3 hy5 double mutant seedlings and the levels were found to be close to the levels present in hy5 single mutants (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Furthermore, while on one hand the enhanced accumulation of anthocyanin in the cop1-4 mutant was suppressed in the sth3 cop1-4 double mutants, there was hardly any difference in the levels of anthocyanin accumulation between cop1-6 and sth3 cop1-6. The levels of anthocyanin were 33% lower in sth3 cop1-4 compared with cop1-4. While sth2 cop1-4 had 24% less anthocyanin than cop1-4, the loss of both STH2 and STH3 resulted in a 5.3-fold decrease in the levels compared with cop1-4. In case of the other allele, cop1-6, the levels of anthocyanin were 18 and 33% lower in sth2 cop1-6 and sth2 sth3 cop1-6 compared with cop1-6, respectively (Figure 6). All these results reaffirm the genetic interaction between the two genes. [[FIGURE]] The phenotypes of sth3, sth2, and the double mutant sth2 sth3 under different light conditions indicated that STH3 and STH2 might act together to regulate light-mediated signaling. We decided to investigate a possible functional interaction between the two proteins on a promoter in vivo. For this, we used a transient transfection assay in Arabidopsis protoplasts using the enzyme luciferase under the control of the Chalcone Isomerase (CHI) promoter as a reporter (CITATION). We chose this promoter because the sth3 mutant showed anthocyanin accumulation defect and CHI is the second committed enzyme in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. The CHI promoter has a G-box, and the expression of CHI has been reported to show strong HY5 and COP1 dependence (CITATION). The ProCHI:LUC reporter was transfected into protoplasts along with Pro35S:RnLUC where Renilla luciferase is expressed from a 35S promoter to serve as an internal control for transformation efficiency and the effectors Pro35S:STH3 and Pro35S:STH2 either singly or both together (Figure 7A ). As shown in Figure 7B, STH3 activated transcription 74% more than the empty 35S vector from a 610-bp fragment of the CHI promoter. While the activation by STH2 alone was ninefold above the basal level, STH2 and STH3 together showed an enhanced ability to activate, the levels being 20-fold higher than the empty vector. Since we had previously seen that STH2 was acting through the G-box promoter element (CITATION), we decided to look at the effect of mutating the G-box on activation by STH3, both alone and together with STH2. We found that mutating the G-box core from CG to TA resulted in negligible activation by STH3, quite similar to STH2, suggesting that STH3 might be acting through this G-box. However, surprisingly, the mutation did not completely abolish the activation produced by STH3 and STH2 together and the level of activation was still 13.6-fold above the basal level (Figure 7B). [[FIGURE]] Recently, it was reported that LZF1/STH3 plays a role in plastid development and accumulation of chlorophyll (CITATION). We therefore decided to examine the ability of STH3 to activate a reporter driven by a 199-bp chlorophyll a/b (CAB) binding protein promoter in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Figure 7A). We saw a 10.3- and 3.6-fold activation by STH3 and STH2, respectively, and together the level of activation was enhanced to 28.5-fold above basal level, suggesting a strong synergistic functional relationship between STH3 and STH2 (Figure 7C). Mutating the G-box in the 199-bp CAB promoter resulted in negligible activation by STH3 or STH2 alone. However, similar to the effect seen on the CHI promoter, STH3 and STH2 when present together could activate transcription 6.1-fold above the basal level on the G-box mutated CAB promoter. To ascertain the role played by the individual B-boxes of STH3 in transcriptional activation, we tested the three amino acid substituted STH3 proteins used in the yeast two-hybrid assays (Figures 1A and 7A). Using these mutated effectors we found that while the level of activation went down from 10.3-fold in the wild-type STH3 to 4.4-fold in D20A and 5.4-fold in D72A, there was no difference in activation in D81A (Figure 7C). Interestingly while the first two Asp residues D20 and D72 are zinc ligating residues and therefore likely to be important for the structural integrity of their respective B-boxes, the third Asp residue D81 does not play such a role. This would indicate that an intact structure of each of the B-boxes is important for transcriptional activation. However, the D81A substitution, found to abolish interaction with HY5 in yeast, does not affect the ability of STH3 to activate transcription. In conclusion, STH3 can activate transcription both independently and together with STH2 through the G-box promoter element, and the zinc ligating Asp residues in both the first and the second B-box are important for the activation. COP1 represses photomorphogenesis in darkness mainly by ubiquitinating positive regulators of light signal transduction, such as HY5, LAF1, HFR1, and phyA, resulting in their targeted degradation via the 26S proteasome (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Our finding that COP1 recruits STH3 into nuclear speckles in onion epidermal cells (Figure 2C), together with our genetic data showing that STH3 acts downstream of COP1 and that these two proteins play antagonistic roles in the control of light signal propagation (Figures 5 and 6), suggested that COP1 could ubiquitinate STH3 to control its function. To test this hypothesis, we purified bacteria-expressed maltose binding protein (MBP)–tagged COP1 (MBP-COP1) and hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged STH3 (HA-STH3). Using these fusion proteins, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays in the presence of different ubiquitin versions: free ubiquitin, HA-ubiquitin, or flagellin (Flag)–tagged ubiquitin. As a result, we found upshifted bands (usually two bands) when MBP-COP1 and HA-STH3 were incubated in the presence of both E1 ubiquitin-activating and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, most likely indicating that MBP-COP1 polyubiquitinates HA-STH3 (Figure 8A ). The finding that the differences in the size of the shifted bands correlated with the molecular weight of the ubiquitin version used in each case, free ubiquitin (8.5 kD), HA-ubiquitin (9.4 kD), and Flag-ubiquitin (9.3 kD), confirms that the bands correspond to ubiquitinated HA-STH3 products (Figure 8B). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The T-DNA insertion line SALK_105367 (sth3-1) was obtained from the ABRC. The sth3, hy5-215, cop1-4, and cop1-6 alleles are in the Col-0 accession. Unless otherwise stated, seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on GM medium supplemented with 0.8% Bactoagar (Difco) and 1% sucrose. The plates were then cold-treated at 4°C for 3 d and then transferred to light chambers maintained at 22°C with the desired light regime. For the complementation test, the pFP100-STH3 construct, containing a 3.3-kb genomic EcoRI fragment (Figure 3A) that included the full-length STH3 gene, was transformed into homozygous sth3, sth2-1 sth3, sth3 hy5-215, sth3 cop1-6, and wild-type Col-0 plants by the modified floral dip method (CITATION). Transgenic T1 seeds were selected using the Leica MZFL III stereomicroscope equipped with a GFP filter. These transgenic seeds were used for phenotypic analyses, with untransformed siblings serving as control. The full-length STH3 cDNA was amplified using the primers STH3u, 5′-GGAATTCTCCAAAGAGAAAACGTATGAG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined), and STH3d, 5′-CGGGATCCCCCTTATAATCTTCAACCAAA-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and then subcloned as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites of pYX242 to create pYX242 STH3. All amino acid substitutions in the B-boxes were made using PCR-based mutagenesis and subsequently subcloned into pYX242 as mentioned before. Primers used for the D20A substitution were STH3B1u, 5′-GTTGCGCCGCCGAGGCTG-3′, and STH3B1d, 5′-CAGCCTCGGCGGCGCAAC-3′, for D72A; STH3B2u, 5′-TGTCTGCAAGCTAGAGCTTTGCTA-3′, and STH3B2d, 5′-TAGCAAAGCTCTAGCTTGCAGACA-3′, and for D81A; STH3B3u, 5′-AGGAAATGTGCTGTTGCAATC-3′, and STH3B3d, 5′-GATTGCAACAGCACATTTCCT-3′. The same primers were used to make pRTL STH3 and the mutated versions for the protoplast experiment. However, in this case the EcoRI-BamHI fragments were first subcloned into an EcoRI/BamHI cut pBSK+, which was then digested with EcoRI/XbaI and subcloned into the corresponding sites in the pRTL vector. For generating the pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-STH3 construct, full-length STH3 was PCR amplified using the primers STH3 kpn, 5′-AGGGTACCATGAAGATTCAGTGTAACGTTTG-3′, and STH3 xba, 5′-CGTCTAGATTACTAGAACCGTCGCCGCCG-3′, and then subcloned as a KpnI-XbaI fragment into the corresponding sites of pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP vector to create pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-STH3. To generate pET28c-3HA-STH3 for the ubiquitination assay, full-length STH3 was PCR amplified using the primers 35s_HA_STH3, 5′-GCTCTAGAGGTGGTGGTATGAAGATTCAGTGTAACGTTT-3′ (XbaI site underlined), and STH3d, 5′-CGGGATCCCCCTTATAATCTTCAACCAAA-3′ (BamHI site underlined), and then subcloned as a XbaI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites of pBHA to create pBHA STH3. This construct was then used as a template for a PCR reaction to amplify three copies of the HA tag fused to STH3 using the primers NheI_HA_fwd, 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGGCATACCCATACGACGT-3′ (NheI site underlined), and STH3d and subcloned as a NheI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites of pET28c to create pET28c STH3. The yeast strain Y187 was used for the two-hybrid assays, and the β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by CITATION. For the FRET acceptor photobleaching experiments, the pAM-PAT-35SS-YFP-HY5, pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-STH3, and the pRTL2-COP1 overexpression constructs were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment and incubated, and live cell images were acquired using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with an LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss). Cells were visualized 20 h after particle bombardment using the confocal microscope through a Plan-Neofluor 403/1.3 oil (differential interference contrast) objective. The multitracking mode was used to eliminate spillover between fluorescence channels. The CFP was excited by a laser diode 405 laser and the YFP by an argon-ion laser, both at low intensities. Regions of interest were selected and bleached with 100 iterations using the argon-ion laser at 100%. Total RNA was extracted from seedlings grown in continuous white light for 6 d after their germination using the Rneasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). Twenty micrograms of the total RNA was loaded for the RNA gel blot analysis. A full-length STH3 open reading frame was used as a probe to detect transcript levels in the wild type and sth3 mutant backgrounds. For all monochromatic light assays, plates were cold-treated at 4°C for 3 d and then transferred to continuous white light for 8 h to induce uniform germination. The plates were then transferred to monochromatic light conditions and incubated at 22°C for 6 d. Blue, red, and far-red light was generated by light emission diodes at 470, 670, and 735 nm, respectively (Model E-30LED; Percival Scientific). Fluence rates for blue and red light were measured with a radiometer (model LI-250; Li-Cor), and for far-red light, we used an opto-meter (40A Opto-Meter; United Detector Technology). The hypocotyl length of seedlings was measured using ImageJ software. For the anthocyanin determinations, seedlings were harvested 3 d after putting them in light, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground, and total plant pigments were extracted overnight in 0.6 mL of 1% HCl in methanol. After addition of 0.2 mL of water, anthocyanin was extracted with 0.65 mL of chloroform. The quantity of anthocyanins was determined by spectrophotometric measurements of the aqueous phase (A530 to A657) and normalized to the total fresh weight of tissue used in each sample. Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cell protoplasts were generated and transfected as described by CITATION. The reporters used were a 610-bp fragment of the CHI promoter (the region between the sequences 5′-TAGAAGCTTTAATAGATAAGAAAAGAAAG-3′ and 5′- AATCGAAATTCCAACCGACTCAACA-3′) and a 199-bp fragment of the CAB promoter (the region between the sequences 5′-ATAACTTGTGGTCACAAAACGC-3′ and 5′-AAACACAAAAAAGTTTCA-3′) driving firefly luciferase (pPCV814-CHI610-Luc and pPCV814-CAB199-Luc). Reporters with G-box mutated in the promoter, pPCV814-CHI610Gm-Luc and pPCV814-CAB199Gm-Luc, were also used in this assay. Full-length STH3 driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was used as the effecter (pRTL2-STH3). For detection, the Dual Luciferase system was used (Promega). Renilla lucerifase driven by a full-length cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was used as internal control (pRNL). In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as previously described (CITATION) with minor modifications. Ubiquitination reaction mixtures (60 μL) contained 50 ng of yeast E1 (Boston Biochem), 50 ng of rice His-Rad6 E2, 10 μg of unlabeled (Free Ub), HA-tagged (HA-Ub), or Flag-tagged ubiquitin (Flag-Ub; Boston Biochem), 200 ng HA-STH3, and 0.5 μg MBP-COP1 (previously incubated with 20 μM ZnCl2) in reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM DTT. MBP-COP1 that was not incubated with ZnCl2 (-Zn) was used as a negative control. After 2 h incubation at 30°C, reaction mixtures were stopped by adding sample buffer, and one-half of each mixtures (30 μL) was separated onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Ubiquitinated HA-STH3 was detected using anti-HA antibody (Roche). The STH3 Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifier is At1g78600.
