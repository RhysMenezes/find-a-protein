!~ABS~! Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a family of highly glycosylated hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). AtAGP17, 18 and 19 comprise the lysine-rich classical AGP subfamily in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of GFP–AtAGP17/18/19 fusion proteins in Arabidopsis revealed localization of the fusion proteins on the plant cell surface of different organs. Subcellular localization of the fusion proteins at the plasma membrane was further determined by plasmolysis of leaf trichome cells. To elucidate AtAGP17/18/19 function(s), these AGPs were expressed without the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag under the control of 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. In contrast to AtAGP17/AtAGP19 overexpressors which showed phenotypes identical to wild-type plants, AtAGP18 overexpressors displayed several phenotypes distinct from wild-type plants. Specifically, these overexpressors had smaller rosettes and shorter stems and roots, produced more branches and had less viable seeds. Moreover, these AtAGP18 overexpressors exhibited similar phenotypes to tomato LeAGP-1 overexpressors, suggesting these two AGP genes may have similar function(s) in Arabidopsis and tomato.
!~RES~! RT-PCR results showed AtAGP17 was expressed in seedlings, flowers, stems and rosette leaves, and weakly expressed in roots (Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with previous Northern blot analyses from our lab and are also consistent with the microarray data from Genevestigator (Yang et al. CITATION; http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch). Surprisingly, Western blotting with AtAGP17 antiserum shows that AtAGP17 is highly expressed in roots and flowers, moderately expressed in stems and weakly expressed in siliques and leaves (Yang et al. CITATION). This finding demonstrates that the mRNA expression level is not always consistent with the level of protein expression. [[FIGURE]]  In order to examine AtAGP17 expression at the tissue level, a P AtAGP17 :GUS (GUS, β-glucuronidase) construct was made and introduced into Arabidopsis wild-type plants. The promoter sequence used in this construct included 1.2 kb of DNA upstream of the start codon since a previous study showed 0.9 kb of this promoter region was insufficient to drive the expression of AtAGP17 (data not shown). T1 transgenic P AtAGP17 :GUS lines were identified by PCR (Fig. S4); however, GUS staining was not detected in the T1 transgenic lines in various organs, while GUS staining of positive controls (P AtAGP18 :GUS and P AtAGP19 :GUS T2 plants) showed distinct staining patterns consistent with previous published data (Yang et al. CITATION; Yang and Showalter CITATION), indicating this 1.2 kb promoter region was not able to drive AtAGP17 expression. The 35S-ss-GFP-AtAGP17/18/19 overexpression constructs were transferred into Arabidopsis wild-type plants by floral dip transformation. For convenience, transgenic plants were named 17 over, 18 over and 19 over, respectively. RT-PCR was performed to examine AtAGP17 mRNA expression levels in the transgenic plants (Fig. S5a). AtAGP17 mRNAs in the transgenic plants were from both the endogenous gene and the GFP-AtAGP17 transgene. As a result, the RT-PCR product of AtAGP17 mRNA from the transformants was considerably more than that from wild type. To verify the presence of the GFP-AtAGP17 fusion protein, Western blotting was carried out using GFP antibody. Protein samples were boiled for 3 min prior to loading to release the GFP from the GFP–AtAGP17 fusion protein since a previous study showed heating releases the GFP from the fusion protein (Sun et al. CITATION). As Fig. S5b shows, GFP (about 28 kDa) was present in 17 over, but was absent in WT. Green fluorescence was also observed in different transgenic lines, indicating expression of the GFP-AtAGP17/18/19 fusion proteins. The GFP-AtAGP17/18/19 fusion proteins were localized to the cell surface in different plant organs, including root, leaf, stem and flower (Figs. 2, S6). [[FIGURE]]  To examine the subcellular localization of some of these GFP fusion proteins, leaf trichome cells of 17 over and 18 over were plasmolyzed and enhanced GFP fluorescence was observed at the plasma membrane; however, no Hechtian strands were observed (Fig. 3). [[FIGURE]]  To overexpress AtAGP17/18/19 without the GFP tag, the 35S-AtAGP17/18/19 constructs as well as a vector control were transformed into Arabidopsis wild-type plants. For convenience, the transformants were named 17NG (AtAGP17 overexpressor, no GFP tag), 18NG, 19NG and VC (vector control), respectively. Ten 17NG lines and 17 19NG lines were identified by PCR and their RNA expression levels were determined (Figs. S7, S8 and data not shown). Phenotypes of these lines, however, were not different from wild-type plants with respect to plant height, branch number, and reproduction. There was only one 19NG line which was smaller and shorter compared with the wild-type plants. This might be due to the disruption of some important genes by random insertion of the transgene. Thirty-two 18NG lines were identified to contain the 35S-AtAGP18 construct (Fig. 4a and data not shown). Among these lines, 18 lines (slightly more than half) displayed several phenotypes distinct from wild-type and vector control (VC) plants (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, RNA was extracted from 50-day-old cauline leaves of individual plants and RT-PCR was performed to monitor AtAGP18 expression. The 18NG lines had high AtAGP18 expression, while the VC lines had low AtAGP18 expression as did wild-type plants (Fig. 4b). The various phenotypes of 18NG lines are discussed below. [[FIGURE]]  The differences between 18NG lines and the wild-type plants were not dramatic during the first 3 weeks after germination. During the 4th week and later, when the wild-type plants developed long inflorescence stems, 18NG plants developed multiple short branches from the rosette. The length of these stems was usually less than one-fifth of the wild-type stem, and the branching number was usually more than twice that of the wild type, resulting in multiple flower buds crowded near the rosette. Moreover, the rosette of 18NG plants was smaller than that of the wild type, and some rosette leaves showed an epinastic phenotype (Fig. 4c, d). The reproductive system in 18NG plants was also affected. Although 18NG plants had the same flowering time as wild-type plants, they usually produced smaller and sterile siliques (Fig. 4d). As a result, most of the 18NG lines were sterile, and even the partially fertile lines still had less seeds than the wild type. When flowers were dissected, some flowers from 18NG plants were found to have short stamens that presumably could not function normally (Fig. 4d). The 18NG lines also had shorter primary roots and less lateral roots than the wild type and VC lines (Fig. 4d). These plants without the normal root system might have difficulty obtaining water and nutrients from the soil, and as a result, some lines died 4–6 weeks after germination. Microarray data of hormone-treated plants from the TAIR website (http://www.arabidopsis.org) showed that ABA down-regulated AtAGP18 expression (Fig. 5a). In order to test the validity of this microarray data, an RT-PCR experiment was designed. Specifically, 6- and 12-day-old seedlings were treated with 20 μM ABA before isolating RNA for RT-PCR to monitor AtAGP18 expression. It was determined that this ABA treatment resulted in yellowing of the seedlings and a marked reduction in AtAGP18 mRNA levels, consistent with the microarray data (Fig. 5b, c). [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia was used in this study. Plants were grown in soil in a growth room under long-day conditions (16 h day/8 h night cycle) for 2 weeks to harvest seedlings, or for 5 weeks to harvest flowers, stems and rosette leaves. Plants grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) vertical plates with 1% sucrose for 2 weeks were used to harvest roots. These materials were used for organ-specific expression of AtAGP17. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and used for RT-PCR with the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The primers used for organ-specific AtAGP17 expression were 5′-ATA AGC CTA AAC CCA CAT CTC CCG-3′ and 5′-CAT GAG ACA AAT GGG AGA GGA TCA-3′. The primers for actin as an internal control were 5′-GTG CTC GAC TCT GGA GAT GGT GTG-3′ and 5′-CGG CGA TTC CAG GGA ACA TTG TGG-3′. A schematic representation of all the overexpression constructs and their related information are shown in Fig. S1. For construction of 35S-ss-GFP, the pUC-ss-GFP construct was digested with BamHI and SacI, and the ss-GFP fragment was subcloned into binary vector pBI121 between the BamHI site and the SacI site to replace the GUS gene under the control of CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. S2a). The 35S-ss-GFP-AtAGP17/18/19 chimeric gene constructs were produced as described previously (Sun et al. CITATION; Yang CITATION). For construction of the vector control which contains only a hygromycin resistant gene, the pMDC45 binary vector was digested with PstI and then self-ligated after removal of the small fragment containing the non-essential DNA sequences between the two PstI sites (Fig. S2b). To create the 35S-AtAGP17/18/19 constructs (i.e., 17NG, 18NG, 19NG), the AtAGP17/18/19 coding sequence was amplified from genomic DNA and inserted between the KpnI site and the PacI site on binary vector pMDC45 (Fig. S2c). Primer pairs used for amplifying the AtAGP17/18/19 coding sequence were 5′-GGG GTA CCC CTC TCA ACT AAT TAC AAA TTA TGA CTC G-3′ and 5′-CCT TAA TTA AGG TTA TTA GAA GGC TAG AAC AAG TAG AG-3′ for the AtAGP17 coding sequence; 5′-GGG GTA CCC CTC CAA ATT TTA ACA AAA TTA TGG ATC-3′ and 5′-CCT TAA TTA AGG TTA GAA TGC CAT AAC GAG AAC G-3′ for the AtAGP18 coding sequence; and 5′-GGG GTA CCT AGC TTC CTC CAC AAC ACA ATG-3′ and 5′-CCT TAA TTA AGG TTA GGC TGT CAT AGC AAG TAG-3′ for the AtAGP19 coding sequence. The AtAGP17/18/19 DNA sequence in the 35S-AtAGP17/18/19 constructs were sequenced in both directions at the Ohio University Genomics Facility (Fig. S3). The constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 by electroporation using the GENE PULSER II system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and then transformed into Arabidopsis plants by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION). Transformants harboring the 35S-ss-GFP or 35S-ss-GFP-AtAGP17/18/19 construct were selected using kanamycin. Transformants harboring the vector control or 35S-AtAGP17/18/19 construct were selected using hygromycin. Leaves from transgenic plants were used to extract DNA with the Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Alternatively, the CTAB method was used to extract genomic DNA (Weigel and Glazebrook CITATION). PCR was performed to verify the presence of the construct. The primers specific to the hygromycin resistance gene were 5′-GGT TTC CAC TAT CGG CGA GTA CTT CTA C-3′ and 5′-AGA TCG TTA TGT TTA TCG GCA CTT TGC ATC-3′, or 5′-GGC GTC GGT TTC CAC TAT CG-3′ and 5′-TCA TTG ACT GGA GCG AGG CG-3′. Total RNA was extracted from transgenic plant leaves and used for RT-PCR. For 17NG and 19NG plants, 35-day-old young leaves were used; for 18NG plants, 50-day-old cauline leaves were used. Primers for mRNA expression levels of AtAGP17/18/19 were AtAGP17, 5′-ATA AGC CTA AAC CCA CAT CTC CCG-3′ and 5′-CAG CTC CCA CCA TTT GTA TCA-3′; AtAGP18, 5′-GCT CCG GCG AAA ACT CCA ACT G-3′ and 5′-AAC CGC TCC CAC CGC TAC ATT C-3′; AtAGP19, 5′-CTG CTC TCA TCT CTT CCT TTA GTG-3′ and 5′-ATT GAG CCA CAT TAC TGC TCT TCC-3′. Total protein was extracted with protein extraction buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7, 10 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM magnesium chloride, 8% sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and quantified by the Lowry assay using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel using a Mini-PROTEAN 3 Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 100 V for 1 h in a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For Western blotting, the PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20, 1XTBS) for 1 h and incubated with the GFP antibody (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) diluted 1:1,000 for 1 h. It was then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1:500 for 1 h and color was developed in color substrate solution (0.5 mM NBT, 0.5 mM BCIP, 0.1 M Tris–HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.5). Different plant organs were observed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 (Zeiss, Germany) with an excitation laser at 488 nm and a 510–550 nm emission filter. Arabidopsis leaves were incubated in 4% NaCl for 10–15 min and were degassed in a vacuum desiccator for 2 min to facilitate infiltration and induce plasmolysis. Arabidopsis wild-type seeds were sterilized and sown on half strength MS plates containing 0.5% sucrose. The plates were kept in the dark at 4°C to stratify the seeds for 2–3 days and then transferred to the tissue culture room at 22°C under long-day conditions. On days 6 and 12, the seedlings were transferred to MS liquid media containing 20 μM ABA or no ABA (mock) and allowed to culture on a shaker at 120 rpm for 2 days. The expression levels of AtAGP18 in the seedlings were examined by total RNA extraction and RT-PCR. The primers were the same as those used for mRNA expression of AtAGP18.
