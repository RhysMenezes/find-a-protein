!~ABS~! The NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I) of the respiratory chain has unique features in plants. It is the main entrance site for electrons into the respiratory electron transfer chain, has a role in maintaining the redox balance of the entire plant cell and additionally comprises enzymatic side activities essential for other metabolic pathways. Here, we present a proteomic investigation to elucidate its internal structure. Arabidopsis thaliana complex I was purified by a gentle biochemical procedure that includes a cytochrome c–mediated depletion of other respiratory protein complexes. To examine its internal subunit arrangement, isolated complex I was dissected into subcomplexes. Controlled disassembly of the holo complex (1000 kD) by low-concentration SDS treatment produced 10 subcomplexes of 550, 450, 370, 270, 240, 210, 160, 140, 140, and 85 kD. Systematic analyses of subunit composition by mass spectrometry gave insights into subunit arrangement within complex I. Overall, Arabidopsis complex I includes at least 49 subunits, 17 of which are unique to plants. Subunits form subcomplexes analogous to the known functional modules of complex I from heterotrophic eukaryotes (the so-called N-, Q-, and P-modules), but also additional modules, most notably an 85-kD domain including γ-type carbonic anhydrases. Based on topological information for many of its subunits, we present a model of the internal architecture of plant complex I.
!~RES~! Biochemical analysis of the subunit arrangement within complex I first requires its gentle purification in the native conformation. A new three-step purification strategy was developed for complex I isolation, based on (1) purification of mitochondrial membranes, (2) separation of mitochondrial membrane protein complexes by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and, finally, (3) cytochrome c affinity chromatography to remove complex III and complex III–containing supercomplexes from complex I–enriched fractions (Figure 2). The outcome of each purification step can be monitored by one-dimensional (1D) BN-PAGE. [[FIGURE]] The starting point for the complex I purification was mitochondria isolated from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. The organelle fraction included all five OXPHOS complexes, the I+III2 supercomplex and the F1 part of complex V (Figure 2A). Since complex I is the largest enzyme of the OXPHOS system, a size-based separation by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was employed to separate the solubilized complexes of the mitochondrial membranes. Under the conditions applied, complex I–enriched fractions were located close the bottom of the centrifugation tube (Figure 2B, fractions 2 and 3). The only visible contaminations within theses fractions were dimeric complex III and the I+III2 supercomplex. Finally, cytochrome c affinity chromatography was applied to specifically remove complex III2 and the I+III2 supercomplex from complex I–enriched fractions. Originally, this procedure was developed to purify complex III2 by the binding to its natural substrate cytochrome c (CITATION; CITATION). Binding of complex III2 is most efficient if cytochrome c is in the oxidized state. Upon reduction of cytochrome c by ascorbate, affinity decreases and allows elution of complex III by a salt gradient of low ionic strength (CITATION). No salt gradient is necessary to detach complex I from the cytochrome c sepharose because it simply passes through the column without interactions and therefore can be obtained in the flow-through fraction. Low salt conditions during purification ensure optimal integrity and native conformation of complex I (Figure 2C). To obtain information on subunit localizations within complex I, the isolated protein complex was destabilized using defined biochemical conditions to generate complex I subcomplexes and finally analyze their subunit composition. Several destabilization conditions were tested, such as temperature, urea, and detergent treatment or mild proteolysis. Results of experiments were monitored by 1D BN-PAGE. Many conditions allowed dissecting complex I (1000 kD) into a large membrane arm of 550 kD and a 370-kD subcomplex that represents the peripheral arm. Dissection of isolated complex I from Arabidopsis into subcomplexes of similar sizes was previously reported by the use of two-dimensional (2D) BN/BN-PAGE, if digitonin used for solubilization is replaced by dodecylmaltoside during the electrophoresis run of the second native gel dimension (CITATION). However, slightly harsher conditions than these destabilization treatments consistently caused complete disassembly of complex I into its subunits. We finally tested destabilization of isolated complex I by treatment with SDS at very low concentrations. Indeed, several additional complex I subcomplexes became visible upon analysis by 1D BN-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie blue or NADH activity staining (Figure 3). Treatment of complex I with only 0.01% SDS caused its partial dissociation into the 550- and 370-kD subcomplexes. Also, the molecular mass of the holocomplex is slightly reduced by ∼80 kD in the presence of 0.01% SDS, indicating loss of a few individual subunits (Figure 3). Increase of the SDS concentration to 0.04% and up to 0.12% generates further subcomplexes of 240, 210, and 140 kD, all of which can oxidize NADH as monitored by an in-gel activity assay. Therefore, they were considered to represent subcomplexes of the peripheral arm, which is known to include the NADH oxidation domain of complex I. [[FIGURE]] 2D BN/SDS-PAGE analyses were performed to further examine SDS-induced subcomplex generation (Figure 4). In the absence of SDS, the subunits of the complex I holoenzyme form a vertical row of spots in the 1000-kD gel region (Figure 4, left gel). Treatment of intact complex I with 0.015% SDS leads to its partial dissection into the 550- and 370-kD complexes, which clearly are composed of distinct subunits (Figure 4, middle gel). Further increase of the SDS concentration to 0.04% leads to the generation of several additional subcomplexes, which are separated into vertical rows of subunits upon analysis by 2D BN/SDS-PAGE. Besides the NADH oxidizing 240-, 210-, and 140-kD subcomplexes detected on 1D BN gels, further subcomplexes are visible at 450, 270, 160, and 85 kD. [[FIGURE]] Subunits of complex I subcomplexes resolved by 2D BN/SDS-PAGE were systematically identified by mass spectrometry (MS) to determine the protein composition of the subcomplexes (Figure 5). Overall, 50 gel spots were analyzed, representing 40 different complex I subunits and a few contaminating proteins like prohibitin, the β-subunit of ATP synthase (complex V), Ser hydroxymethyltransferase, and lipoamide dehydrogenase (Table 1). Protein determinations revealed that the 550-, 450-, 270-, 160-, and 85-kD subcomplexes are related to the membrane arm (indicated in red on Figure 5) and the 370-, 240-, 210-, and two 140-kD subcomplexes to the peripheral arm (indicated in orange on Figure 5). MS-based protein identifications gave insights into the subunit compositions of 10 different complex I subcomplexes (first given for the peripheral arm and afterwards for the membrane arm). [[FIGURE]] Proteins Identified by MS (1) The 370-kD subcomplex represents the entire peripheral arm. It includes at least 11 subunits: the so-called 75-kD, 51-kD, 49-kD (ND7), 30-kD (ND9), 24-kD, TYKY, B13, PSST, and B8 subunits (bovine nomenclature), the plant-specific subunit At1g67785 (∼12 kD), and the previously not described Arabidopsis complex I subunit At3g03070 (∼10 kD), which is homologous to the 13-kD subunit of the bovine enzyme (Figure 6). [[FIGURE]] (2) The 240-kD subcomplex represents the so-called NADH oxidation-module (N-module) of the peripheral arm, which previously was identified after pH- and Triton X-100–induced destabilization of complex I isolated from E. coli (CITATION). It is composed of at least four proteins: the 51-kD subunit, which includes the NADH oxidation domain, the 75-kD subunit, the 24-kD subunit, the B8 subunit, and/or the plant-specific At1g67785 protein. (3) The slightly smaller 210-kD subcomplex comprises only the three core subunits of the N-module, namely, the 75-, 51-, and 24-kD subunits. (4) and (5) Careful inspection of the 2D gel in Figure 5 revealed that the 140-kD subcomplex consists of two distinct comigrating subcomplexes termed 140a and 140b. Assignment of subunits to the two subcomplexes is based on spot shape (barbell shaped in the case of subcomplex 140a and round in the case of subcomplex 140b). Subcomplex 140b includes the 51- and 24-kD subunits. Due to the presence of the NADH binding 51-kD subunit, it becomes visible upon in-gel NADH staining like the 240- and 210-kD subcomplexes (Figure 3). The 140a subcomplex includes subunits previously reported to form the so-called Q-reduction module (Q-module) of the peripheral arm in E. coli (CITATION). It is composed of the 49-kD (ND7), 30-kD (ND9), TYKY, PSST, and B13 subunits. (6) The 550-kD subcomplex represents the membrane arm of Arabidopsis complex I. It includes at least 27 subunits, 13 of which are homologous to known subunits of the membrane arm from bovine complex I (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND5, PDSW, B18, PGIV, 15 kD, B12, ASHI, AGGG, and MWFE). Additionally, the membrane arm of Arabidopsis complex I includes a bovine homolog known to be present in the peripheral arm, the so-called 16.6-kD subunit (GRIM19). Thirteen further subunits of the Arabidopsis membrane arm are plant-specific proteins, eight of which are rather small and hydrophobic (At4g16450, At2g27730, At2g42310/At3g57785, At4g00585, At4g20150, At2g31490, At1g67350, and the previously not described complex I subunit At5g14105). The five remaining plant-specific subunits of the membrane arm represent the CA subunits CA1, CA2, CA3, CAL1, and CAL2. (7) The 450-kD subcomplex is a subcomplex of the membrane arm generated most efficiently at a slightly higher SDS concentration. The subunit composition resembles the one of the 550-kD complex, but it lacks all five CA subunits and some of the smaller subunits of the membrane arm. (8) and (9) The 270- and 160-kD subcomplexes represent smaller forms of the 450-kD subcomplex that lack so far unknown subunits. The 160-kD subcomplex includes the ND5 subunit, the B18 subunit, and/or At2g27730 as well as the PGIV subunit and/or At1g67350. (10) Finally, an 85-kD subcomplex includes the CA subunits present within plant complex I, the CA1, CA2, CAL1, and CAL2 proteins. Slightly differing horizontal positions of the CAL1 and CAL2 proteins with respect to the CA1 and CA2 subunits indicate that they might not be simultaneously present within individual CA subcomplexes. The GLDH, which is associated to complex I in plants, and the so-called 39-kD subunit were identified as separate proteins on BN/SDS gels (Figure 5), which do not form part of complex I subcomplexes upon SDS treatment of any concentration and therefore are assumed to be either peripherically localized or at the interphase of the membrane and the peripheral arm. Elucidation of subunit compositions of complex I subcomplexes allows us to deduce a model of internal subunit arrangement within plant complex I as discussed below.
!~MM~! Cell cultures of Arabidopsis wild type (Columbia-0) were established as described by CITATION. Cells were cultivated in a suspension culture maintained as outlined previously (CITATION). Mitochondria were isolated from Arabidopsis suspension culture as given by CITATION. Purification of complex I from isolated Arabidopsis mitochondria followed a two-step procedure based on (1) sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to prepare the ∼1-MD protein fraction and (2) cytochrome c affinity chromatography to deplete the complex I–enriched 1-MD fraction from remaining contaminations of complex III2 and supercomplex I+III2. Isolated mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in digitonin solubilization buffer (30 mM HEPES, 150 mM potassium acetate, 10% [v/v] glycerol, and 5% [w/v] digitonin) at a detergent/protein ratio of 5 mg/mg. Protein complexes were subsequently resolved by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Solubilized mitochondria (∼10 mg mitochondrial protein) were loaded onto a 12-mL sucrose gradient (15 mM Tris, 20 mM KCl, 0.2% [w/v] digitonin, and 0.3 to 1.5 M sucrose). Ultracentrifugation was performed at 4°C using Beckmann 9/16 × 3 3/4 Ultra Clear Tubes and the Beckmann SW40Ti rotor (146.000g for 20 h). Afterwards, the gradient was divided into 700-μL fractions, and the protein complex composition of each fraction was analyzed by 1D BN-PAGE (see below). Fractions containing complex I but devoid of complex V were used for a cytochrome c–mediated depletion of complex III contaminations. For this approach, cytochrome c was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose as described by CITATION. Before usage, the cytochrome c sepharose was washed with 300 mL oxidation solution (5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], 0.5% [v/v] Triton X-100, 0.1 M NaHCO3, and 0.5 M NaCl) to oxidize the cytochrome c. Subsequently, this solution was removed by washing the Sepharose with 150 mL washing buffer (20 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.0, 5% [w/v] sucrose, 0.04% [w/v] digitonin, and 0.2 mM PMSF). Six milliliters of Sepharose was filled into a column (1 cm × 10 cm) and washed with washing buffer another time. Afterwards, the complex I–containing sucrose gradient fractions were transferred on the top of the column, and the flow-through was collected in 1-mL fractions. Additional 2 mL of washing buffer was used to remove remaining complex I from the column. Finally, complex III2 and the I+III2 supercomplex were eluted from the column using a salt gradient (20 to 200 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.0, 5.0% [w/v] sucrose, 0.04% [w/v] digitonin, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 2 mM Na-ascorbate). The eluate was collected in 1-mL fractions. For evaluation of the protein complex content of the fractions, 25 μL of each flow-through fraction and 75 μL of each eluate fraction were analyzed by 1D BN-PAGE (see below). Fractions containing pure complex I were concentrated using an ultra filtration cell (Millipore; polyethersulfone filter; exclusion limit, 100.000 kD) to a final protein concentration of ∼5 mg/mL. For disassembly experiments, purified complex I (1 mg in 200 μL) was treated with low concentrations of SDS (0.01 to 0.12% [w/v]) for 5 min on ice. Afterwards, 1 μL BN loading buffer (750 mM aminocaproic acid and 5% [w/v] Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250) was added. 1D BN-PAGE was used to separate the generated complex I subcomplexes and 2D BN/SDS-PAGE to analyze their subunit composition. Procedures were performed as outlined previously (CITATION). Proteins were either visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue colloidal staining (CITATION) or in-gel NADH dehydrogenase activity staining (CITATION). Tryptic digestion of proteins was performed as follows: Protein spots were cut from 2D BN/SDS gels and destained. Gel pieces were dehydrated using acetonitrile. For alkylation of cysteins, gel pieces were first incubated with 20 mM DTT for 30 min at 56°C, dehydrated, and incubated in 55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for the same time in the dark. The dehydrated gel pieces were incubated in 0.1 M NH4HCO3, and digestion was performed at 37°C overnight using trypsin (2 μg/mL resuspension buffer [Promega] in 0.1 M NH4HCO3). Tryptic peptides were extracted by incubation with acetonitrile for 15 min at 37°C. Supernatants were kept and basic peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid for 15 min at 37°C. The dehydration step was repeated, and the supernatant was pooled with the first one. Extracted peptides were finally dried via vacuum centrifugation and stored at −20°C. Protein identification by MS was performed as follows: Tryptic peptides were resuspended in 20 μL of washing solution (2% [v/v] methanol and 0.5% [v/v] formic acid) and desalted using ZipTips (0.2 μL C18; Millipore). For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) analyses, 1 μL of Matrix solution (0.1% [w/v] α-Cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid, 25% [v/v] acetonitrile, and 0.1% [w/v] triflouroacetic acid) was mixed with 1 μL of desalted peptide solution and spotted on a MALDI target. MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF-MS analyses were performed with an Ultraflex II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Offline electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadrupole (Q)-TOF-MS analyses were performed with a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Waters). For liquid chromatography–ESI-Q-TOF-MS analyses, tryptic peptides were resuspended in 15 μL 0.1% [v/v] formic acid. The MS analyses were performed with the EASY-nLC System (Proxeon) coupled to a MicrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Proteins were identified using the MASCOT search algorithm against (1) the Arabidopsis protein database (www.Arabidopsis.org; release TAIR 8), (2) a complex I database generated from the complex I subunits identified by CITATION, and (3) the NCBI nonredundant protein database (www.ncbi.nih.gov). All peptides identified in our study match protein sequences deduced from the Arabidopsis genome sequence (www.Arabidopsis.org). The corresponding accession numbers are listed in Table 1 (column 2). The following materials are available in the online version of this article. Supplemental Figure 1. Subunits Detached from Complex I upon Treatment with Low Concentrations of SDS.
