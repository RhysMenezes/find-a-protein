!~ABS~! Methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana bind in vitro methylated CpG sites. Here, we aimed to characterize the binding properties of AtMBDs to chromatin in Arabidopsis nuclei. By expressing in wild-type cells AtMBDs fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), we showed that AtMBD7 was evenly distributed at all chromocenters, whereas AtMBD5 and 6 showed preference for two perinucleolar chromocenters adjacent to nucleolar organizing regions. AtMBD2, previously shown to be incapable of binding in vitro–methylated CpG, was dispersed within the nucleus, excluding chromocenters and the nucleolus. Recruitment of AtMBD5, 6, and 7 to chromocenters was disrupted in ddm1 and met1 mutant cells, where a significant reduction in cytosine methylation occurs. In these mutant cells, however, AtMBD2 accumulated at chromocenters. No effect on localization was observed in the chromomethylase3 mutant showing reduced CpNpG methylation or in kyp-2 displaying a reduction in Lys 9 histone H3 methylation. Transient expression of DDM1 fused to GFP showed that DDM1 shares common sites with AtMBD proteins. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated that AtMBDs bind DDM1; the MBD motif was sufficient for this interaction. Our results suggest that the subnuclear localization of AtMBD is not solely dependent on CpG methylation; DDM1 may facilitate localization of AtMBDs at specific nuclear domains.
!~RES~! We previously have shown that AtMBD5, AtMBD6, and AtMBD7 bind in vitro methylated CpG sites, whereas AtMBD1, AtMBD2, and AtMBD4 do not (CITATION). To study the interaction of AtMBDs with methylated DNA in vivo, AtMBDs were tagged at their C termini with GFP and placed downstream from the 35S promoter. The GFP fusion constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol methodology. In Arabidopsis, methylated DNA is found mainly at heterochromatic chromocenters (Figure 1A; see also CITATION; CITATION). In transient expression assays, AtMBD7-GFP was evenly distributed at all chromocenters (Figure 1B), whereas AtMBD5 and 6 showed preference for two large domains adjacent to the nucleolus (Figure 1B; see Supplemental Figure 1A online). By contrast, AtMBD2, previously shown incapable of binding in vitro methylated CpG sites (CITATION), was dispersed within the nucleus but excluded from chromocenters and the nucleolus (Figure 1B; see Supplemental Figure 1B online). [[FIGURE]] In stably transformed plants, AtMBD5 and 6 generally followed the subnuclear localization pattern found in transient expression, except for guard cells, where the distribution was at multiple subnuclear domains (Figure 1C). Immunolabeling assays using anti-GFP on nuclei prepared from transgenic plants expressing AtMBD6-GFP showed colocalization with the intensely 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained chromocenters (Figure 1D). Together, these results demonstrate the association of AtMBDs (5, 6, and 7) with methylated CpG-rich chromatin in planta and suggest the involvement of additional factors in determining their preference for specific nuclear domains. We estimated the strength of AtMBD6-GFP binding with chromatin by salt extraction of nuclei prepared from transgenic plants expressing AtMBD6-GFP. Nuclei were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl after which the soluble and the insoluble pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting analysis using αGFP showed that AtMBD6-GFP was composed of two fractions: a major fraction (∼85%), which was tightly associated with chromatin and could not be released even under 500 mM NaCl, and a minor fraction (∼15%), which was loosely associated with chromatin and was released to the soluble fraction with as low as 200 mM NaCl (Figure 2A). As expected, a control histone H3 was strongly associated with chromatin as revealed with anti-K4–methylated histone H3 (α-K4m2H3). We also analyzed whether the dispersal of AtMBD2-GFP within the nucleus reflects the presence of AtMBD2 in the soluble nuclear fraction. Nuclei prepared from transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AtMBD2-GFP were subjected to salt extraction. Results showed that AtMBD2-GFP is not found in the soluble fraction but rather strongly bound to chromatin (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). [[FIGURE]] To verify the association of AtMBDs with chromocenters, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay on nuclei prepared from transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AtMBD6-GFP. The antibodies used recognize GFP (αGFP), dimethylated H3K4 (αK4m2H3), a known histone modification associated with transcriptionally active chromatin (CITATION; CITATION), as well as dimethylated H3K9 (αK9m2H3), a known histone modification associated with chromatin compaction and gene silencing (CITATION; CITATION). Precipitated DNAs were subjected to PCR to amplify a set of DNA sequences, including centromeric 180-bp repeats (CEN180), the 18S rDNA, as well as actin-encoding sequence. Results showed that anti-GFP precipitated CEN180 and 18S rDNA but not the actin-encoding sequence (Figure 2B). The association of the 18S rDNA with both K4- and K9-dimethylated histone H3 reflects the diverse chromatin configurations of rRNA gene clusters, being either transcriptionally active or inactive. As expected, the actin-encoding sequence was precipitated mainly with αK4m2H3, slightly with αK9m2H3, but not with αGFP (Figure 2B), confirming the association of AtMBD6 with the transcriptionally inactive chromatin. The two large perinucleolar domains to which AtMBD5 and 6 bind are likely to define chromocenters of the acrocentric chromosomes 2 and/or 4, which together with the nucleolar organizing region form a large domain of heterochromatin. To assess this possibility, fixed nuclei from transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AtMBD6-GFP were first immunolabeled with anti-GFP followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with tetramethylrhodamine-5-dUTP–labeled CEN180 or 18S rDNA. Results showed that AtMBD6-GFP colocalized with the intensely DAPI-stained chromocenters and was associated with CEN180, displaying preference for perinucleolar chromocenters adjacent to the 18S rDNA (Figure 2C). Thus, AtMBD5 and 6 preferentially bind chromocenters of chromosome 2 and/or 4, where they might regulate chromatin compaction and silencing of rRNA genes. To confirm the preference of AtMBD5, 6, and 7 for methylated CpG sites, we examined the distribution of AtMBD-GFPs in three Arabidopsis DNA methylation mutants: ddm1-2, a mutation in the DDM1 gene encoding the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling factor; met1-1, a mutation in MET1 DNA methyltransferase gene—both of which show reduction in CpG methylation (CITATION; CITATION); cmt3, a mutation in the CMT3 gene that reduces CpNpG and CpNpN methylation (CITATION; CITATION). Reduced DNA methylation in ddm1-2 and met1-1 was demonstrated by the sensitivity of the centromeric 180-bp repeats as well as the 18S rDNA to digestion by the methylation-sensitive HpaII enzyme (data not shown). In ddm1-2 and met1-1 cells, the subnuclear localization of AtMBD5, 6, and 7 was disrupted (Figure 3A). A greater effect was observed in ddm1-2 cells where AtMBD5 and 6 were evenly dispersed within the nucleus. In met1-1 (Figure 3A), as well as in met1-3 cells, where CpG methylation is thought to be almost completely lacking (CITATION), AtMBD5 and 6 showed patchy distribution with a certain fraction of these proteins still associated with chromocenters (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). To quantify these differences, we compared the magnitude of fluctuation in fluorescence intensity by determining the coefficient of variation for each population of nuclei (shown in Supplemental Figure 3A online) using the NIH Image program (CITATION; see Methods). In wild-type cells, the coefficient of variation (see Supplemental Figure 3B online) was the highest (0.772 ± 0.18), indicating very high fluctuation in fluorescence intensity of AtMBD6-GFP within the nucleus. The coefficient of variation for met1-1 (0.239 ± 0.06) and met1-3 (0.225 ± 0.062) was significantly higher (approximately twofold) than that of ddm1-2 (0.114 ± 0.029), thus confirming higher fluctuation in fluorescence intensity for AtMBD6-GFP in met1 mutants compared with ddm1-2. In the cmt3 mutant, subnuclear localization of AtMBD-GFP proteins was similar to that found in wild-type plants (Figure 3A). These results verified the importance of CpG methylation in controlling AtMBD5, 6, and 7 subnuclear localization. Interestingly, in ddm1-2 and met1-1 mutant cells, AtMBD2-GFP was accumulated at chromocenters as confirmed by immunolabeling/FISH assay on nuclei derived from transgenic ddm1-2 expressing AtMBD2-GFP (Figures 3A and 3B). This redistribution, however, cannot be accounted for by direct binding of AtMBD2 to unmethylated CpG sites inasmuch as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-AtMBD2 failed to form complexes with unmethylated sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] Our results demonstrated a role for CpG methylation in the subnuclear localization of AtMBDs. The difference, however, between ddm1-2 and met1-1 concerning the localization of AtMBD5 and 6 prompted us to investigate possible association between DDM1 and AtMBD proteins. To this end, we first tested whether DDM1 and AtMBDs occupy common nuclear domains. DDM1 cDNA was subcloned downstream from the 35S promoter and upstream from GFP to generate DDM1-GFP fusion protein. This construct was transformed into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and inspected under a confocal microscope 24 h after transformation. Results showed two types of localization for DDM1-GFP in Arabidopsis leaf nuclei (Figure 4A): DDM1-GFP was either localized at chromocenters, similarly to AtMBD5, 6, and 7 (type I), or evenly dispersed throughout the nucleus, similarly to the distribution pattern of AtMBD2 in wild-type cells (type II). Thus, AtMBDs and DDM1 occupy common nuclear domains. [[FIGURE]] We next investigated physical interaction between AtMBDs and the DDM1 protein using the GST pull-down assay. Glutathione sepharose containing GST alone or GST fused with various AtMBDs were incubated with in vitro–translated 35S-labeled DDM1 full-length protein and after extensive washing samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and exposed to a phosphor imager. Results showed that all GST-AtMBD proteins, but not GST alone, bound to the full-length DDM1 protein (Figure 4B). The MBD motif alone, either of AtMBD6 (GST-mbd6) or of AtMBD2 (GST-mbd2), was sufficient for this interaction (Figure 4B). The deletion/frameshift caused by the ddm1-2 allele occurs at amino acid 524, leading to premature translation termination upstream from the predicted helicase C-terminal domain (CITATION). We therefore analyzed possible interaction between AtMBDs and the C-terminal region of DDM1 (DDM1/511-764) using the N-terminal region of DDM1 (DDM1/1-205) as a control. Both AtMBD2 and AtMBD6 were capable of binding to the C-terminal region of DDM1, though at a reduced affinity compared with the full-length DDM1. No significant interaction of AtMBDs with the DDM1 N-terminal region (DDM1/1-205) could be detected (Figure 4B). To confirm this interaction, we performed reciprocal assays and analyzed the capability of the full-length DDM1 fused to GST (GST-DDM1) to precipitate the AtMBD6 from nuclear extract derived from transgenic plants expressing AtMBD6-GFP. To this end, GST alone, GST-DDM1, as well as GST-AtMBD2 and GST-AtMBD5 immobilized onto glutathione sepharose were mixed with nuclear extract, and after incubation (4°C, 12 h) and extensive washing precipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-GFP. Results showed that GST-DDM1 and GST-AtMBD5, but not GST alone or GST-AtMBD2, were capable of precipitating AtMBD6-GFP from nuclear extract. These results further support physical interaction between AtMBD6 and the chromatin remodeling factor DDM1. In ddm1-2 and met1 mutants, H3K9 dimethylation at chromocenters is reduced (CITATION; CITATION). To assess the involvement of H3K9 dimethylation in recruiting AtMBDs to chromocenters, we transiently expressed AtMBD-GFP constructs in kyp-2 cells where H3K9 dimethylation at chromocenters is significantly reduced (Figure 5A; see also CITATION; CITATION), whereas CpG methylation at centromeres is unaffected (CITATION; CITATION). Results showed that the distribution of AtMBD-GFP proteins in kyp-2 was similar to that of wild-type plants (Figure 5B), suggesting that H3K9 dimethylation is dispensable for the localization of AtMBDs at chromocenters.

!~MM~! Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants for ddm1-2 and met1-1 were kindly provided by E. Richards and seeds of met1-3 from J. Paszkowski. These mutants were confirmed by the sensitivity of the centromeric 180-bp repeats as well as the 18S rDNA to digestion by the methylation-sensitive HpaII enzyme. The ddm1-2 mutant was further verified by RT-PCR as described (CITATION) and met1-3 by PCR as described (CITATION). Wild-type and Arabidopsis mutants (all in the background of Columbia ecotype) were grown under short-day conditions at 20°C. At 4 to 6 weeks after germination, rosette leaves were collected for the isolation and transformation of protoplasts essentially as described (CITATION). The GFP signal was detected 24 h after transfection using a laser confocal microscope (Olympus IX70; Hamburg, Germany). Images were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and images for GFP and chlorophyll signals were collected through 505 to 525- and 630-nm filters, respectively. Nuclei were isolated from leaves as previously described (CITATION) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by washing twice with PBS. Nuclei were placed on slides, air dried, permeabilized in cold acetone (100%) for 7 min in −20°C, and washed twice with PBS. Slides were blocked in 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with 100 μL of primary antibody mixture containing 2% BSA and 2 μg of antidimethylated Lys 9 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-GFP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Slides were washed three times, 5 min each, in PBS, followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h with the appropriate secondary antibody tagged with fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For FISH assays, slides washed as above were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, denatured with formamide, and probed with the 180-bp repeats (CEN180) and the 18S rDNA, both labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-dUTP (Roche) as described (CITATION). After hybridization, slides were washed, stained with 10 μg/mL of DAPI, washed twice, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Hybridization signals were visualized by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a CCD camera (Imago; TILL Photonics, Hamburg, Germany) using Olympus filters U-MNU, U-MWIBA2, and U-MNG to detect DAPI, fluorescein, and rhodamine, respectively. Images were pseudocolored and merged using TILL Vision version 3.3 software (TILL Photonics). All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Mountain View, CA). Immunolabeling with polyclonal anti-5-methyl cytosine (Megabase Research Products, Lincoln, NE) was performed on nuclei fixed with ethanol/acetic acid (3:1) essentially as described above except that before blocking with BSA, nuclei were processed to DNA denaturation as previously described for FISH (CITATION). Fusion of AtMBD to GFP was performed by subcloning each of the indicated AtMBD cDNA into pUC19-35S-GFP (a gift from A. Levitan and A. Danon), downstream from the 35S promoter and in frame with the GFP. Each AtMBD cDNA was amplified by PCR to eliminate the stop codon using the following primers: AtMBD2-S, 5′-GAGAGGATCCATGCCTTCAATGCAGAAGTATGAA-3′; AtMBD2-AS, 5′-TCTCCCCGGGTCTATCAGCAAGTTCGTCGTTGG-3′; AtMBD5-S, 5′-TGATATCAGATCTATGTCGAACGGCACGGATCAG-3′; AtMBD5-AS, 5′-TCTCCCCGGGGAACATCGTTTTTCCAGCGTT-3′; AtMBD6-S, 5′-GAGATCTAGAATGTCAGATTCTGTGGCCGGC-3′; AtMBD6-AS, 5′-TCTCCCCGGGAGCCGACACTTTACTAGGG-3′; AtMBD7-S, 5′-GAGAAGATCTAGAATGCAGACGAGATCCTCTTCCTCTCC-3′; AtMBD7-AS, 5′-GAGACCCGGGAATTCTTAAGAGCGGTCTTCGATCAGTG-3′. The various AtMBD PCR products were digested either with BamHI and SmaI or with BglII and SmaI and subcloned into BglII-SmaI sites of pUC19-35S-GFP. The integrity of each construct was verified by sequencing. These constructs were used for protoplast transformation experiments using polyethylene glycol essentially as described (CITATION). To generate transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing AtMBD fused to GFP, the 35S-AtMBD-GFP fragment was excised out using EcoRI and subcloned into the same site of the binary vector pPZP-111 to generate pPZP-35S-AtMBD-GFP followed by transformation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Arabidopsis plants (ecotypes Colombia and Wassilewskija as well as the ddm1-2 mutant). Salt extraction of nuclei was performed as described (CITATION). ChIP was performed on nuclei prepared from Arabidopsis plants expressing AtMBD6-GFP essentially as described (CITATION) using anti-GFP (Roche), anti-dimethylated K4 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), as well as antidimethylated K9 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology). Precipitated DNAs were subjected to PCR using the following primers: CEN180-S, 5′-GAGAGGATCCCGTAAGAATTGTATCCTTGTTAG-3′; CEN180-AS, 5′-GAGAGAATTCCCTTTAAGATCCGGTTGTGG-3′; 18SrDNA-S, 5′-GCTACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAGTC-3′; 18SrDNA-AS, 5′-CGACCTTTTATCTAATAAATGCGTCCC-3′; Actin-S, 5′-GGTTTTGCTGGGGATGATGC-3′; Actin-AS, 5′-CATTGAATGTCTCAAACATGATTTGAGTC-3′. ChIP PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C, 5 min; 30 cycles of 94°C, 30 s; 56°C, 30 s; 72°C, 45 s; 72°C, 10 min. PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. DNA was extracted from Arabidopsis leaves by modification of the C-elyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method (CITATION). To determine the DNA methylation status at chromocenters, genomic DNA was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII and MspI, and samples were run on 1% agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane, and hybridized with the 180-bp repeats labeled with [α32P]dCTP using the Nick Translation kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as previously described using GST alone, GST-AtMBD2, and GST-AtMBD5 and 32P-labeled umCG or 1mCG double-stranded oligonucleotides as described (CITATION). DDM1 and its truncated forms were constructed in pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by PCR using the full length of DDM1 (kindly provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) as a template and the following primers: D(1-205)-S, 5′-CACAGGATCCCCTTCGATGGTTAGTCTTCGCTCC-3′; D(1-205)-AS, 5′-CTCCCCGGGTCAATAAGACTTTAACTGTCC-3′; D(511-764)-S, 5′-GAGAGGATCCATGTATCTCTACCCTCCTGTTG-3′; D(511-764)-AS, 5′-TGTGGAATTCCTAACTGTTCAGGGAAGACAGC-3′. The PCR products were digested either with BamHI and SmaI or BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same sites of either pGEX2T or pBluescript KS+ downstream from the T7 promoter to generate pBs-DDM1(FL), pBs-DDM1(1-205), and pBs-DDM1(511-764). These plasmids were subjected to in vitro transcription–coupled translation in the presence of 35S-Met using a Promega kit (Madison, WI) and according to the supplied protocol. Labeled proteins were subjected to GST pull-down assay using GST-AtMBDs (CITATION) or GST alone (as a negative control) essentially as described (CITATION). GST-MBD2 was reconstructed using a cDNA library (kindly provided by the ABRC) as a template and 5′-GAGAGGATCCATGAGTATGTCGCAGTCTCGAGC-3′ as sense primer and 5′-GAGAGAATTCTTATCTATCAGCAAGTTCGTCG-3′ as antisense primer. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same sites of pGEX-2T. Image analysis was performed using the NIH Image program version 1.61 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Briefly, to obtain the coefficient of variation for fluorescence intensity, the sd of the pixel values for each nucleus was divided by the mean pixel value. The mean of the coefficient of variation for a given population and the sd were determined for each set of nuclei transformed with AtMBD6-GFP (shown in Supplemental Figure 3A online). Statistical significance was determined using TTEST.
