!~ABS~! Potassium (K+) homeostasis is essential for diverse cellular processes, although how various cation transporters collaborate to maintain a suitable K+ required for growth and development is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains numerous cation:proton antiporters (CHX), which may mediate K+ transport; however, the vast majority of these transporters remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that AtCHX13 (At2g30240) has a role in K+ acquisition. AtCHX13 suppressed the sensitivity of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant cells defective in K+ uptake. Uptake experiments using 86Rb+ as a tracer for K+ demonstrated that AtCHX13 mediated high-affinity K+ uptake in yeast and in plant cells with a Km of 136 and 196 μm, respectively. Functional green fluorescent protein-tagged versions localized to the plasma membrane of both yeast and plant. Seedlings of null chx13 mutants were sensitive to K+ deficiency conditions, whereas overexpression of AtCHX13 reduced the sensitivity to K+ deficiency. Collectively, these results suggest that AtCHX13 mediates relatively high-affinity K+ uptake, although the mode of transport is unclear at present. AtCHX13 expression is induced in roots during K+-deficient conditions. These results indicate that one role of AtCHX13 is to promote K+ uptake into plants when K+ is limiting in the environment.
!~RES~! In a family of 28 CHX members phylogenetically separated into five subclades, AtCHX13, AtCHX14, along with AtCHX26 and AtCHX27, compose subclade III (CITATION). None of these subclade III transporters has been experimentally characterized. Interestingly, rice (Oryza sativa) CHX transporters related to subclade III have not been identified (CITATION), suggesting monocots lack these transporters. To study the function of AtCHX13, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to clone the AtCHX13 (At2g30240) cDNA. Previous studies revealed that AtCHX13 is highly expressed in pollen grains (CITATION). Therefore, total RNA extracted from Arabidopsis pollen grains was used to amplify the AtCHX13 coding sequences using gene-specific primers. The AtCHX13 cDNA consists of 2,496 nucleotides and a predicted polypeptide containing 831 amino acids (EF571901). The closely related AtCHX14 cDNA comprises 2,490 nucleotides, which could encode a protein with 829 amino acids (EF571900; Supplemental Figure S1A; data not shown). The AtCHX13 cDNA and deduced protein revealed substantial similarities to other AtCHX transporters: AtCHX17 and AtCHX23 (AY926473 and AY926477, respectively; Supplemental Fig. S1A). AtCHX13 shows the highest identity (71%) and similarity (84%) with AtCHX14, confirming they are products of an ancient chromosomal segmental duplication (CITATION). In contrast, AtCHX13 shares 31% identity and 52% similarity with AtCHX17, 29% identity and 50% similarity with AtCHX23. The deduced AtCHX13 protein contains 10 predicted transmembrane domains, (Supplemental Fig. S1B). AtCHX13 does not contain a predicted organelle-targeting sequence (data not shown) and the C-terminal region did not show substantial similarity to proteins of known functions (data not shown). Computational analysis (using the TMHMM2 program) clearly indicated AtCHX13 has similar topology with the other AtCHX transporters (Supplemental Fig. S1B). We detected a growth change in a yeast mutant (LMM04) expressing AtCHX13. LMM04 lacks several functional K+ transporters, including TRK1, TRK2, TOK, and the endomembrane KHA1 is very sensitive to low K+. LMM04 can only grow in medium with high levels of exogenous K+ (CITATION). We confirmed that the yeast strains grew normally in medium supplemented with 200 mm KCl, whereas vector controls were not able to grow in the medium with low K+ (Fig. 1A ). Expression of AtKAT1, coding an inward-rectifying Arabidopsis K+ channel (CITATION), suppressed the hypersensitivity of LMM04 to lower K+ (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, yeast mutant cells expressing AtCHX13 grew on medium containing low (5–20 mm) K+ in a similar manner to AtKAT1-expressing cells suggesting that AtCHX13 has a role in acquiring K+ (Fig. 1A). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether AtCHX13 could directly alter K+ content (accumulation) in yeast, LMM04 cells expressing vector, AtCHX13, and KAT1 were grown in synthetic medium (SC) with 5 mm KCl and then subjected to ion analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. The resulting accumulation profile of several elements (calcium [Ca], K, magnesium [Mg], phosphorus [P], sodium [Na]) was determined in these yeast strains (CITATION). As shown in Figure 1B, K+ content in AtKAT1- and AtCHX13-expressing cells was significantly higher than the vector controls. Interestingly, P levels were also significantly higher in the AtKAT1- and AtCHX13-expressing cells, whereas the other ions were not different than the controls. Thus, an increase in yeast growth caused by AtCHX13 is accompanied by K+ accumulation. To further characterize AtCHX13, we expressed the transporter in yeast strains lacking only functional TRK1 and TRK2 (Supplemental Fig. S2). AtCHX13 and AtKAT1 restored growth of mutants (trk1trk2) at low K+ (1–5 mm) when compared to vector controls. For both LMM04 (Fig. 1) and trk1trk2 (Supplemental Fig. S2), the difference between controls and both AtKAT1- and AtCHX13-expressing cells was most pronounced at pH 4.5. To further test AtCHX13 function in K+ uptake, we expressed the full-length cDNA in the yeast mutant strain LMM04 (where the phenotype was most robust) and measured K+ uptake using radioactive rubidium (86Rb) as a tracer. For simplicity, we assumed that 86Rb mimics K+ influx and later directly tested this assumption (see below). We analyzed 86Rb uptake as a function of time in LMM04 vector controls and cells expressing AtCHX13 or the K+ channel AtKAT1. To identify experimental conditions under which the initial rate of K+ uptake could be measured, time course analysis of K+ uptake was performed at 0.02 mm (Fig. 2A ) and 20 mm (Fig. 2B) external K+. Under both conditions, uptake was linear for at least 5 min and both AtCHX13- and AtKAT1-expressing cells had significantly higher K+ uptake rates compared to vector controls. Yeast cells expressing AtCHX13 had higher K+ uptake at low (0.02 mm) K+ concentrations compared to AtKAT1-expressing cells, whereas at 20 mm K+, AtKAT1-expressing cells demonstrated increased uptake compared to AtCHX13-expressing cells. [[FIGURE]] Kinetic analysis was performed for K+ uptake by yeast cells expressing AtCHX13 or AtKAT1. Initial uptake rates (within the first 5 min of K+ addition) were plotted as a function of external K+ concentration (Fig. 2C). K+ uptake by AtCHX13-expressing yeast was near maximum at below 1 mm, indicating high-affinity K+ uptake. Uptake in AtKAT1-expressing yeast did not show saturation up to 5 mm K+, indicating a lower affinity for K+ (Fig. 2C). After subtracting the K+ uptake rate from vector controls, reciprocal plots for AtCHX13-expressing yeast cells showed a Km for K+ of 136.4 μm and Vmax of 14.4 nmol h−1 10−7 cells (Fig. 2D). Given that AtKAT1-mediated K+ uptake did not show saturation in the substrate range measured, we were unable to estimate a Km for AtKAT1. To establish that Rb+ uptake by AtCHX13-expressing cells is an accurate indicator of K+ uptake kinetics, we measured Rb+ uptake at 5 min in assay solutions containing 0.02, 2.0, and 20 mm of RbCl and KCl. The uptake rates were virtually identical in the K+- and Rb+-containing uptake solutions (data not shown), an indicator that Rb+ flux is mimicking K+ uptake. AtCHX13-mediated K+ uptake assays at 0.02 mm K+ was blocked by cesium (Cs+) and Na+ (Fig. 2E). Cs+ inhibited the high-affinity uptake of K+ significantly at concentrations above 1 mm. Similarly, K+ uptake in AtCHX13-expressing yeast cells was inhibited when greater than 1 mm NaCl was present (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that Na+ and Cs+ block K+ transport by competing for the same cation-binding site. Cs+ inhibits K+ uptake through most K+ channels and some other transporters (CITATION; CITATION). Early studies demonstrated that K+ uptake by plant roots is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of NaCl (for review, see CITATION). To probe the mode of AtCHX13-mediated K+ uptake in yeast, we tested the effect of pH and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Fig. 2F). AtCHX13-mediated uptake at 20 μm external K+ was higher at pH 4.3 relative to pH 7.5. Furthermore, CCCP, a protonophore, reduced K+ uptake. Glc had little to no effect, indicating that energy from carbon metabolites was not limiting. These results suggest that K+ uptake is dependent on a pH gradient (acid outside). To determine the subcellular localization, a fusion of AtCHX13 with GFP at the C terminus (AtCHX13-GFP) was constructed. The function and localization of AtCHX13-GFP was tested in yeast (Supplemental Fig. S3). The addition of GFP did not abolish the function of AtCHX13, although the fusion protein showed weaker ability to restore yeast growth than CHX13 or KAT1. In yeast, AtCHX13-GFP was predominantly localized peripherally, consistent with plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3A ) and in contrast to the uniform cytoplasmic labeling in cells expressing GFP (Fig. 3B). In plant cells, AtCHX13-GFP was transiently expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells (Fig. 3, D and E). When imaged by confocal microscopy, the localization pattern of AtCHX13-GFP was markedly different from that of soluble GFP. A maximal projection image of several confocal optical sections of cells expressing soluble GFP revealed an extensive network of cytoplasmic strands, which is characteristic of cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, AtCHX13-GFP-expressing cells displayed intense fluorescence confined to the cell periphery. Maximal projection images of a series of confocal optical sections revealed uniform GFP labeling along the cell surface and the absence of any fluorescent strands. These features are strongly indicative of the plasma membrane localization of AtCHX13 (Fig. 3, D and E). To exclude the possibility that AtCHX13-GFP localized to the cell wall, onion cells were plasmolyzed by treatment with 1 m Suc. The fluorescence in the plasmolyzed cells detached from the cell wall, confirming that the AtCHX13-GFP signal was not from the cell wall or the apoplastic space between the cells (Fig. 3E). Our plasmolysis experiment also allowed us to distinguish between plasma membrane and tonoplast labeling. In fully differentiated cells, such as the onion inner epidermal cells used here, a large central vacuole typically pervades a large portion of the cell leaving only a thin layer of cytoplasm compressed toward the edge of the cell. This often makes it difficult to distinguish whether GFP signal originates from the plasma membrane, tonoplast, or cytoplasm. We therefore imaged regions of the cell where we could readily visualize the cytoplasm. In a plasmolyzed onion cell expressing 35S∷GFP, a slightly thickened region of the cytoplasm could be seen using bright-field optics. A corresponding fluorescence image showed that GFP signal was uniformly distributed within this cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 3D). In contrast, AtCHX13-GFP-expressing cells showed intense fluorescence originating from a thin layer along the outer edge of the cytoplasm, confirming plasma membrane, but not tonoplast, localization (Fig. 3E). [[FIGURE]] Microarray and preliminary promoter-driven GUS results suggest that AtCHX13, like 13 other AtCHX genes, is expressed during pollen development (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch; CITATION). To more systematically characterize AtCHX13 expression, we monitored expression using RT-PCR and AtCHX13 promoter-driven GUS activity. Using northern analysis, AtCHX13 showed little or no expression in seedlings given a variety of ionic stresses, including increased and decreased levels of Na+, K+, and Ca2+. Using RT-PCR, we confirmed microarray results that AtCHX13 was expressed weakly in several plant tissues, including roots (Fig. 4A ). Using RT-PCR to determine expression in seedlings, we showed that AtCHX13 expression could be detected 1 d after plants were depleted of K+ (Fig. 4B). When plants were exposed to higher levels of K+ (100 mm), AtCHX13 expression could be detected in seedlings after 1 d, but expression appeared to dissipate at day 2 and beyond. [[FIGURE]] To verify the expression results, promoter-driven GUS activity was determined. Due to low expression levels in vegetative tissues, AtCHX13∷GUS activity could only be reproducibly measured in pollen when plants were grown on standard medium (J. Zhao and K. Hirschi, unpublished data; CITATION). When K+ was limiting, AtCHX13∷GUS root expression increased compared to lines grown in normal medium (10 mm K+; Fig. 4C). AtCHX13 promoter-GUS expression and RT-PCR data indicated AtCHX13 expression is enhanced in response to decreased K+ conditions. To study the function of AtCHX13 in plants, we obtained two independent T-DNA insertional lines for atchx13 (Fig. 5A ). Homozygous lines were identified and the positions of the T-DNA insertions were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 5A). Using RT-PCR, no AtCHX13 transcripts could be reverse transcribed from total RNA isolated from the mutant flowers (Fig. 5B). The atchx13 lines showed no obvious morphological or growth defects compared to control plants under standard growth conditions (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] Additional attempts to alter AtCHX13 expression were made by constitutive expression of the ORF in Arabidopsis (in the Columbia [Col-0] background). In the 35S∷AtCHX13 lines, PCR analysis showed augmented basal level of native gene expression (Fig. 5C). Despite the increased amount of AtCHX13 transcripts in these lines, no change in plant growth or development was detected when the plants were grown in standard conditions (data not shown). The maintenance of K+ homeostasis is important for stress responses (CITATION). The observations that the expression of AtCHX13 was induced in seedlings grown under low K+ conditions and that AtCHX13 expression in yeast mediated K+ transport suggested that AtCHX13 may function in K+ uptake during K+ deficiency. Under standard growth conditions (0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium containing about 10 mm K+) atchx13 mutants and 35S∷AtCHX13 seedlings grew similarly to control lines (Fig. 6A ; Supplemental Fig. S4A). However, when these lines were germinated and grown on low K+ medium at varying pH values, atchx13 lines displayed obvious growth phenotypes when compared to controls. Specifically, the atchx13 lines grew more slowly and appeared to have more leaf chlorosis and bleaching (Fig. 6, B–D; Supplemental Fig. S4A). The sensitivity of atchx13 lines to limited K+ is obvious at low pH (4.3); however, this sensitivity is not pH dependent as some sensitivity is also observed at pH 7.5. Measurements of total chlorophyll and fresh-weight analysis in these lines reflect the growth differences (Fig. 6, E–H). That is, the atchx13 lines displayed reduced chlorophyll content and biomass. The transgenic lines that expressed high levels of AtCHX13 were more robust than control lines in these growth conditions (Fig. 6, A–F). [[FIGURE]] 86Rb uptake kinetics of 35S∷AtCHX13, and wild-type (Col-0) seedlings were directly analyzed by measuring time- and concentration-dependent 86Rb+ uptake into roots of K+-starved plants. The initial uptake of 86Rb+ was linear in all lines up to 20 min, with uptake being dramatically higher for the 35S∷AtCHX13-expressing lines than control mutant lines (Fig. 7 ). Concentration-dependent 86Rb+ uptake was subsequently measured at 10-min intervals at different external K+ concentrations. Uptake rates for 86Rb+ revealed a significant difference between vector control and 35S∷AtCHX13 lines at low K+ concentrations (0.02 mm K+; Fig. 7, A and B). The atchx13 mutants showed uptake at 0.02 mm K+ lower than controls (data not shown). At high K+ concentrations (20 mm), the difference in uptake kinetics could not be resolved between vector control and the lines with enhanced AtCHX13 expression (Fig. 7B). The influx at 20 mm K+ was similar in all lines tested. In atchx13 lines, 86Rb+ uptake was slightly reduced compared to controls when K+ was limiting (0.02 mm K+), but was similar to controls at higher K+ levels (Supplemental Fig. S5). [[FIGURE]] To attempt to measure the uptake rate of K+ (86Rb+) by AtCHX13 in plants, the difference between the uptake rates of vector controls and 35S∷AtCHX13 was measured. A plot of the difference in uptake rates, as a function of K+ concentration, approximates a saturable system with a Km of 196 μm and Vmax of 188.7 nmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 7, C and D). We measured 86Rb+ uptake in 35S∷AtCHX13 lines under different pH conditions and in the presence of the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 7E). In a manner similar to the yeast cells expressing AtCHX13, optimal uptake was measured at acidic pH conditions and the protonophore inhibited K+ uptake in these whole-plant experiments. Results suggest K+ uptake is dependent on a pH or electrochemical gradient.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Col-0 seeds were used as wild type (control). atchx13 T-DNA insertion mutant lines in the Col-0 ecotype were obtained by screening SALK and SAIL lines (http://signal.salk.edu). Seeds from these lines were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Two atchx13 homozygous lines were screened from T-DNA insertion lines, SALK_095075 (atchx13-1) and SALK_023605 (atchx13-2). In both lines, the T-DNA was inserted in the last exon of the AtCHX13 ORF. PCR was used to confirm the lines contained the proper T-DNA insertion by using T-DNA primers and AtCHX13 gene-specific primers, 5′-ATGGAGCTTTCGATGTTTGGC-3′ (for SALK_023605 lines) or 5′-GAGTTTACCGAGATCAATGGTAG-3′ (for SALK_095075 lines). Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and sown on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog plates. K+-deficient 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium was made with KNO3 replaced by BTP, KH2PO4 replaced by NaH2PO4, and KI replaced by NaI. The K+ concentration in the medium was adjusted by mixing specific amounts of Murashige and Skoog medium and K+-deficient Murashige and Skoog medium. The plates contained 0.8% agar and 1% Suc. The pH of the medium was buffered with 5 mm MES to pH 4.5, pH 5.6, and with 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.5. Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds were used as wild type. Col-0, atchx13-1, atchx13-2, and 35S∷AtCHX13 seeds were germinated on normal 0.5× Murashige and Skoog and on K+-deficient medium and incubated in a growth chamber at 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles at 22°C. Plant phenotypes were recorded after 3 to 4 weeks. Total chlorophyll content was extracted from seedlings with 90% acetone, and chlorophyll a/b was measured as described previously (CITATION). Seedlings were removed and blotted dry with tissue prior to determining biomass. Biomass of plant seedlings was expressed as fresh weight per 20 seedlings. To isolate AtCHX13 cDNA, total RNA was isolated from mature pollen grains of Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants by the guanidine/acid-phenol method (CITATION). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase. Primers X13Cf (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTTACTGATAAGGAAAAGACTATGGAGCT-3′) and X13Cr (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAATGGTAGTGAAACCTTCTTCAGCA-3′) were used to amplify the AtCHX13 cDNA by PCR (25 cycles, 94°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s, and 72°C 90 s). The forward and reverse primers contain attB1 and attB2 sequences for Gateway recombination cloning. Gel-purified PCR products were recombined with pDONR221 using BP clonase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Resulting clones were sequenced using forward and reverse M13 primers and gene-specific primers X13s1f (5′-GTCATCCATCTCTTCCTCCT-3′), X13s2f (5′-CTATAGCTAGCCTTAGTGGA-3′), X13s3f (5′-GTGGTGTACCTCTACGACCCT-3′), and X13s4f (5′-CGTGATTCCGTTCCACAAGCA-3′). The correctly spliced clone containing the longest ORF was named as entry clone pECHX13. After the initial cloning, AtCHX13 was amplified using forward primer 5′-GGATCCATGGAGCTTTCGATGTTTGGCAGAG (BamHI site underlined) and reverse primer 5′-CGCGGCCGCCTAGCGTTTACCGAGATCAATGGTAGTGAAACCTTC (NotI site underlined). The resulting cDNA fragment was cloned into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression vector pUGpd, using the GPD promoter to express the GFP-tagged AtCHX13, and was made using PCR. The AtCHX13 cDNA was amplified by using the following primers for PCR: 5′-GGTACCACTAGTATGGAGCTTTCGATGTTTGGCAGAG-3′ (EcoRI and SpeI sites underlined) and CHX13-GFP3, 5′-GCGGCCGCGCGTTTACCGAGATCAATGGTAGTGAAACCTTCT-3′ (NotI site underlined). The PCR product was sequenced and ligated into the yeast pUGpd-GFP vector at SpeI and NotI sites. The resulting constructs contained the AtCHX13 reading frame fused to the 5′ of the GFP ORF. The clone was confirmed by sequencing and introduced into yeast. Plant transient expression constructs were generated by PCR amplification using the yeast AtCHX13-GFP plasmid DNA as a template. AtCHX13-GFP was amplified with a forward primer, 5′-GCGGCCAAATCGGCCATGGAGCTTTCGATGTTTGGCAGAG-3′ (SfiIA), and a reverse primer, 5′-CGGGCCCTTATGGCCTAATAACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′ (SfiIB). The AtCHX13-GFP fusion was inserted into a transient expression vector pRTL1 at the SfiI site. Resulting construct harbored the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter driving AtCHX13-GFP followed by the NOS terminator. The plasmid was used for both transient expression in onion (Allium cepa) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) epidermal cells. Stable 35S∷AtCHX13 constructs for expression in plants were generated by recombination cloning as described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The third generation of Basta-resistant lines was verified by RT-PCR analysis. For RNA analysis, Col-0 seeds were germinated in soil (Metro-Mix 360) and grown under continuous light. Two-week-old seedlings were washed with water and then floated in the metal-containing medium for 16 h. RNA was extracted from tissues using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Ten micrograms of total RNA was used for northern-blot analysis as described previously. For RT-PCR analysis, 4-week-old Col-0 seedlings were used. For K+ stress treatment, Col-0 seedlings were grown on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog for 1 week under 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles, then transferred to K+-deficient plates (0 or 2 mm K+) and K+-containing plates (50 mm K+ and 100 mm K+). Whole seedlings were harvested daily to monitor gene expression. Total RNA was isolated from root, leaf, flower, and siliques of Arabidopsis using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with a Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase kit using oligo(dT)12-18 as primer (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with the following program: 94°C for 2 min to denature DNA, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C (30 s), 58°C (30 s), and 72°C (60 s), followed by 72°C for 10-min extension. ACTIN1 was used as control. ACTIN1: forward primer, 5′-GTGCTCGACTCTGGAGATGGTGTG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CGGCGATTCCAGGGAACATTGTGG-3′; AtCHX13 forward primer P1, 5′-GACTAGTCTTTACGCGCTTTCCATG-3′ and reverse primer P2, 5′-TATGTCGTTGTTTATACTCGAGTAAGGCG-3′. AtCHX13∷GUS reporter lines were generated as described previously (CITATION) and seeds were germinated on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog agar plates (10 mm K+) for 1 week, and then seedlings were transferred to K+-depleted plates (0 mm K+) or K+ stress (50 mm K+ and 100 mm K+) conditions. Seedlings were harvested regularly to monitor GUS expression. GUS staining was conducted as described previously (CITATION). Samples were photographed using a Nikon (Tokyo) E600W microscope. Five micrograms of plasmid DNA containing the 35S∷GFP, 35S∷AtCHX13-GFP was mixed with 20 μL of an aqueous suspension containing 1.6-μm gold particles. The gold DNA suspensions were vortexed in the presence of CaCl2 and spermidine and incubated on ice. After centrifugation, the plasmid-coated gold particles were washed and resuspended in ethanol. The gold was spread onto plastic carrier discs for biolistic bombardment of tobacco and onion epidermal cells using a Bio-Rad 1000/HE particle delivery system. After 12 to 15 h, GFP from the epidermal cells of tobacco leaves and onion were imaged with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). GFP was excited with the 488-nm line of the argon laser and emission was detected at 520 nm. To characterize the K+-transport activities of AtCHX13, 86Rb tracer experiment was performed (CITATION; CITATION). The 86RbCl salt with a specific activity of 7.85 mCi/mg was purchased from Perkin-Elmer (Life and Analytical Sciences). Plants were grown hydroponically for 7 d in sterile flasks on B5 medium, 2% Suc, and 0.05% MES, pH 5.7. Seedlings were harvested and preincubated for 2 d in K+-free Murashige and Skoog medium. 86Rb+ uptake assays were conducted in K+-free Murashige and Skoog medium buffered with 5 mm MES to pH 5.0, supplemented with 0.5 μCi 86Rb and various concentrations of KCl (0.02 or 20 mm). Samples (about six seedlings) were taken at 10, 20, 30, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min, respectively, washed with 3 × 10 mL of K+-free Murashige and Skoog medium, and then placed for 20 min in 40 mL of ice-cold K+-free Murashige and Skoog medium. Subsequently, the seedlings were blotted on filter paper, weighed, and activity measured using a scintillation counter. For kinetic analysis, seedlings were incubated in various external K+ concentrations (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500 μm) for 10 min. Different pH values of uptake buffer containing 2% Suc were obtained by adjusting MES-Tris combinations. Uptake lasted for 10 min and then samples were washed as described above for radioactivity counting. Yeast strains LMM04 (ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 mall0 ena1Δ∷HIS3∷ena4Δ nha1Δ∷LEU2 trk1Δ∷LEU2 trk2Δ∷HIS3 kha1Δ∷kanMX:tok1Δ) and 59m15 (trk1∷LEU2 trk2∷HIS3) were used to characterize AtCHX13 (CITATION; CITATION). LMM04 or 59m15 cells expressing AtCHX13, AtKAT1, or empty vector were grown in SC-Ura medium containing 100 mm KCl at 30°C overnight. Five-fold serial dilutions were prepared from the saturated yeast cultures and 3-μL aliquots of each dilution were spotted on SC-Ura plates with or without various concentrations of KCl under different pH conditions (CITATION). The pH of SC medium was adjusted with 5 mm MES for pH 4.5 and 6.0 and 5 mm Tris-Cl buffer for pH 7.5. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 4 d. Yeast cation analysis was performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Yeast LMM04 cells expressing AtCHX13, AtKAT1, and empty vector were grown overnight in 5 mL SC-Ura medium supplemented with 100 mm KCl. After rinsing and diluting with K+-free SC-Ura medium, 100 μL of yeast cells were inoculated into 5 mL fresh SC-Ura medium supplemented with 5 mm K+ and grown at 30°C overnight. About 2.5 mL of the yeast cultures were collected by vacuum filtration using isopore membrane filters (1.2-μm pore size; Fisher Scientific). Cells were washed three times with 1 mL of 1 μm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt solution, pH 8.0, followed by three washes with 1 mL of deionized water. The filters were dried in a 70°C oven for 48 h for inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy analysis (CITATION). For observation of AtCHX13-GFP signals, the yeast harboring the AtCHX13-GFP fusion were grown in SC-His-Leu medium overnight. The yeast cells were viewed under laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview, FV 500; Olympus Optical). An argon laser beam was used for excitation at 488 nm and GFP visualization with emission at 525 nm. To characterize the K+ transport activities of AtCHX13 in yeast, K+ uptake using 86Rb+ as tracer was performed (CITATION; CITATION). LMM04 yeast cells expressing vector, AtCHX13, and AtKAT1 were grown to midlog phase in the Ura-deficient SC medium containing 50 mm KCl. Cells were harvested and washed and K+ starved in low-salt Arg-P medium (CITATION) for 5 h before the uptake assay. For the time course study, 5 × 108 cells were added to 50 mL of the uptake solution (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 μCi 86Rb+/mL and 0.02 and 20 mm KCl in culture flasks and gently shaken. A fraction of the cells was harvested at the indicated times. For kinetic studies, 107 cells were used in each uptake sample in a 1-mL solution containing 0.5 μCi 86Rb+ and various concentrations of KCl. The 86Rb+ radioactivity taken up into the cells was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (model LS6000IC; Beckman Instruments). To test whether other cations reduced K+ uptake, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 100 mm NaCl or CsCl was included in the uptake assay reaction containing 0.02 mm KCl. For comparison of Rb+ and K+ affinity, 86Rb+ uptake in the standard reaction plus nonradioactive K+ or Rb+ at 0.02, 2.0, and 20 mm was conducted. The different pH of the uptake medium containing 10 mm Glc was adjusted using 5 mm MES or Tris. Effect of Glc on AtCHX13-mediated K+ uptake was tested by comparison of uptake in 10 mm Glc with that after depletion of 10 mm Glc from uptake buffer under pH 4.5. Protonophore CCCP was added to the yeast cells in uptake medium (pH 4.5) 5 min prior to K+ and 86Rb tracer addition. After 5 min of uptake, samples were filtered and washed with 10 mm RbCl for scintillation counting. All uptake experiments were performed in duplicate with three independent replicates (unless otherwise noted).
