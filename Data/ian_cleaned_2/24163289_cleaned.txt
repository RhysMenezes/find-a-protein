!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis stomatal complex is composed of a pair of guard cells and surrounding anisocytic subsidiary cells. Subsidiary cells are thought to function as a supplier and receiver of bulk water and ions, and to assist turgor-driven stomatal movement, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this work, we studied the dynamic behavior and environmental responses of PATROL1, which has been identified as a translocation factor of the plasma membrane proton pump ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) AHA1 in guard cells and subsidiary cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. Variable-angle epifluorescence microscopic observation revealed that green fluorescent protein (GFP)–PATROL1 localized on dot-like compartments that resided on plasma membranes for several seconds. The GFP–PATROL1-labeled dots were sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase inhibitors but not to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor. GFP–PATROL1 and red fluorescent protein (RFP)–AHA1 co-localized in hyperosmotic conditions, and a mutation of PATROL1 resulted in an increase in GFP–AHA1 internalization, suggesting a role in the translocation of PM H+-ATPase in subsidiary cells. Interestingly, subsidiary cells showed changes in localization of GFP–PATROL1 in response to environmental stimuli that were opposite to those in guard cells. Our observations suggested that PATROL1 may contribute to stomatal movement by translocations of PM H+-ATPase in subsidiary cells.
!~RES~! Gene expression patterns of PATROL1 were studied by β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter assay with PATROL1pro:GUS transgenic lines (CITATION). In the leaf non-stomatal epidermal cells, there were both GUS reporter-positive and -negative cells (Fig. 1A). The GUS-positive cells were observed to be in small subsidiary cells adjacent to the guard cells (Fig. 1A). Measurements of cell area and complexity (see the Materials and Methods for definition) showed that small and simply shaped epidermal cells tended to show PATROL1 expression (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that PATROL1 was expressed in subsidiary cells in A. thaliana.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Our previous studies suggested that PATROL1 is crucial for the precise localization of the PM H+-ATPase AHA1 (CITATION). To gain more insight into PATROL1 functions on the plasma membrane surface, we observed GFP–PATROL1 dynamics using variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM) (CITATION). GFP–PATROL1 highlighted dots on the plasma membranes in both guard cells and subsidiary cells (Fig. 2A, arrows). Interestingly, we found that GFP–PATROL1-labeled dots appeared on plasma membranes then disappeared after residing at the same site for several seconds (Supplementary Movie S1). Kymograph analysis showed that their residence times were about 2–10 s both in guard cells and in subsidiary cells (Fig. 2B–D), implying that PATROL1 functions in both types of cell.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The dynamic behavior of GFP–PATROL1 dots on the plasma membranes suggested a relationship between PATROL1 and plasma membrane phosphoinositides, signaling components of plasma membranes (CITATION). Therefore, we next performed pharmacological experiments on subsidiary cells with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or phosphoinositide 4-kinase (PI4K), which synthesize phosphoinositide 3-phosphate or phosphoinositide 4-phosphate, respectively. Treatment with wortmannin, which inhibits both PI3K and PI4K (CITATION), significantly decreased GFP–PATROL1-labeled dots (Fig. 3B) compared with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) control (Fig. 3A). A PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY294002 (CITATION), did not perturb the dynamics of the GFP–PATROL1 dots (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Movie S2). On the other hand, a PI4K-specific inhibitor, phenylarsine oxide (PAO) (CITATION), eliminated GFP–PATROL1 dots (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that the formation of the GFP–PATROL1 dots on plasma membranes is required for PI4K activity.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In guard cells, PATROL1 co-localized with AHA1, a PM H+-ATPase (CITATION). To examine the co-localization in subsidiary cells, we monitored changes in localization of GFP–PATROL1 and red fluorescent protein-tagged AHA1 (RFP–AHA1) after hyperosmotic treatment (530 mOsM mannitol). Just after the hyperosmotic treatment, many GFP–PATROL1 dots were observed on plasma membranes (Fig. 4A, C). The fluorescence of RFP–AHA1 was evenly distributed on plasma membranes (Fig. 4B, D) or rarely labeled dot-like organelles (Fig. 4D, arrow) and showed little co-localization with PATROL1 (Fig. 4E). Thirty minutes after the hyperosmotic treatment, several larger GFP–PATROL1 dots were observed but then decreased in number (Fig. 4F, H). RFP–AHA1 aggregated on plasma membranes and began to co-localize with GFP–PATROL1 dots (Fig. 4G, I, J), suggesting the relationship between PATROL1 and AHA1 in subsidiary cells as well as in guard cells.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We next observed differences in GFP–AHA1 localization in wild-type and patrol1 mutant background plants (CITATION). GFP–AHA1 predominantly localized on plasma membranes and a few organelles in guard cells and subsidiary cells (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Movie S3). The patrol1 mutation induced larger GFP–AHA1-labeled organelles and increased their number (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Movie S3). These observations indicated that PATROL1 functions in AHA1 delivery to plasma membranes in subsidiary cells.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In guard cells, GFP–PATROL1 dot number increased in response to drought stress (stomatal closure) (from 0.026 ± 0.0023 to 0.050 ± 0.0053 dots µm−2), and decreased in response to light irradiation (stomatal opening) (from 0.23 ± 0.037 to 0.095 ± 0.018 dots µm−2) as previously reported (CITATION). Surprisingly, we found the opposite responses in subsidiary cells. After leaf detachment, GFP–PATROL1 dot number significantly decreased in subsidiary cells (from 0.19 ± 0.082 to 0.030 ± 0.032 dots µm−2) (Fig. 6A, B) while they increased in guard cells. After 72 h of dark treatment and white light irradiation, GFP–PATROL1 dots significantly increased in subsidiary cells (from 0.020 ± 0.022 to 0.075 ± 0.050 dots µm−2) (Fig. 6C, D), while they decreased in guard cells. We also checked exogenous ABA responses of GFP–PATROL1 in guard cells and subsidiary cells (Fig. 7). Stomata were pre-opened by white light irradiation and floated on buffer with 0.1% DMSO or 10 µM ABA for 30 min under the white light condition (Fig. 7A, B). ABA treatment significantly increased GFP–PATROL1 dots in guard cells (from 0.011 ± 0.0073 to 0.072 ± 0.0081 dots µm−2) (Fig. 7C). In contrast, in subsidiary cells, the exogenous ABA treatment significantly decreased GFP–PATROL1 dots (from 0.065 ± 0.025 to 0.023 ± 0.020 dots µm−2) (Fig. 7C). These results suggested that there are cell type-specific regulation mechanisms for PM H+-ATPase translocations.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and transgenic lines used were grown on solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium for 7–14 d in growth chambers set at 23.5°C, 60% relative humidity and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle using 100 µmol m−2 s−1 white lights. Cotyledons of 7- to 14-day-old plants were used for image acquisition. All fluorescence protein-tagged markers were expressed under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CITATION). Cotyledons were covered with a glass slide and observed under a variable-angle epifluorescence microscope (IX-73; Olympus) equipped with a total internal reflection microscopy unit (IX3-RFAEVAW; Olympus) and an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (CCD) camera head system (ImagEM; Hamamatsu Photonics) or with a spinning-disk confocal laser scanning microscope (IX70, Olympus) equipped with a confocal scanning head (CSU10; Yokogawa) and a cooled CCD camera head system (CoolSNAP HQ; Photometrics). To monitor the dynamics of GFP–PATROL1, we captured time-sequential images using the menu ‘Acquire-Stream Acquisition’ of the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) with 600 frames at 100 ms exposure time. To obtain a kymograph image, we used the MetaMorph menu ‘Stack-Kymograph’. For dual observation of GFP–PATROL1 and RFP–AHA1 by spinning-disk confocal laser scanning microscopy, GFP and RFP were excited with a 488 nm laser (HPU-50101-PFS2; Furukawa) and a 561 nm laser (85-YCA-025-040; CVI Melles Griot). Fluorescence was detected through a 524–546 nm band-pass filter (FF01-535/22-25; Semrock) for GFP, and a 580–600 nm band-pass filter (FF01-590/20-25; Semrock) for RFP. For hyperosmotic treatments, leaves were incubated in basal buffer (50 mM KCl, 5 mM MES–Tris, pH 6.5, and 100µM CaCl2) with 0.4 M mannitol (530 mOsM) for 30 min. For stomatal opening, plants were grown in darkness for 72 h, and then their leaves were irradiated with 200 µmol m−2 s−1 white light for 60 min with a cold light illumination system (LG-PS2; Olympus) (CITATION). To prevent drying, 3 mm thick 1% agarose gels with opening buffer (10 mM KCl, 10 mM MES–Tris, pH 6.5, and 100 µM CaCl2) were placed onto the leaves (CITATION). Exogenous ABA treatment was performed as described by CITATION with minor modifications. Cotyledons were floated on opening buffer and incubated under light conditions (200 µmol m−2 s−1 white light) for 60 min to open the stomata. Subsequently, the cotyledons with pre-opened stomata were transferred to the same buffer supplemented with 0.1% DMSO or 10 µM ABA (Sigma-Aldrich Japan) for 30 min, and then observed. Seedlings were immersed in basal buffer supplemented with 20 µM wortmannin (Wako Pure Chemicals), 20 µM LY294002 (Wako Pure Chemicals) or 20 µM PAO (Wako Pure Chemicals) for 3 h.
