!~ABS~! The pollen coat protects pollen grains from harmful environmental stresses such as drought and cold. Many compounds in the pollen coat are synthesized in the tapetum. However, the pathway by which they are transferred to the pollen surface remains obscure. We found that two Arabidopsis thaliana ATP binding cassette transporters, ABCG9 and ABCG31, were highly expressed in the tapetum and are involved in pollen coat deposition. Upon exposure to dry air, many abcg9 abcg31 pollen grains shriveled up and collapsed, and this phenotype was restored by complementation with ABCG9pro:GFP:ABCG9. GFP-tagged ABCG9 or ABCG31 localized to the plasma membrane. Electron microscopy revealed that the mutant pollen coat resembled the immature coat of the wild type, which contained many electron-lucent structures. Steryl glycosides were reduced to about half of wild-type levels in the abcg9 abcg31 pollen, but no differences in free sterols or steryl esters were observed. A mutant deficient in steryl glycoside biosynthesis, ugt80A2 ugt80B1, exhibited a similar phenotype. Together, these results indicate that steryl glycosides are critical for pollen fitness, by supporting pollen coat maturation, and that ABCG9 and ABCG31 contribute to the accumulation of this sterol on the surface of pollen.
!~RES~! To identify candidate transporters that are involved in the transport of lipids to the pollen surface, we searched for Arabidopsis ABCG transporter genes that are highly expressed in a developing bud using an in silico database (the BAR Arabidopsis eFP browser [http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi]; Supplemental Figure 1). Among the candidates, ABCG9 and ABCG31 were specifically expressed in the stamen and in no other parts of developing flowers (Arabidopsis MPSS plus [http://mpss.udel.edu/at/mpss_index.php]; Supplemental Data Set 1). Furthermore, no mRNA signal was detected for these genes in apetala3 or agamous1, which lack stamens (CITATION), but a strong signal was detected in sup ap1, which produces supernumerary stamens (CITATION). Interestingly, these two genes were highly coexpressed (Arabidopsis Coexpression Mining Tools [CITATION] and ATTEDII [http://atted.jp/top_search.shtml#CoExSearch]). Moreover, no other ABC genes were found to be strongly coexpressed with either ABCG9 or ABCG31; ABCG31 was the only ABC protein gene among the 150 genes identified as the most highly coexpressed genes with ABCG9, and vice versa (Supplemental Data Set 2). For the functional analysis of ABCG9 and ABCG31 in planta, we obtained two independent ABCG9 T-DNA insertional mutants (abcg9-1 and abcg9-2) from the SALK Institute and two independent ABCG31 T-DNA insertional mutants from the SALK Institute (abcg31-1) and GABI-Kat (abcg31-2). abcg9-1 and abcg9-2 contained T-DNAs in the third and second exons of ABCG9, respectively (Supplemental Figure 2A), whereas abcg31-1 and abcg31-2 contained T-DNAs in the 19th intron and 10th exon of ABCG31, respectively (Supplemental Figure 3A). The insertion sites were verified by genomic DNA-PCR (Supplemental Figures 2B and 3B). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that all of the homozygous mutant plants were complete knockouts (Supplemental Figures 2C and 3C). Neither of the knockout plants displayed any visible defects in overall development. If ABCG31 and ABCG9 have similar functions, deletion of both ABCG31 and ABCG9 would lead to a more pronounced phenotype than that observed for either of the single knockout plants. Thus, we generated abcg9 abcg31 double knockout plants, abcg9-1 abcg31-1, by crossing abcg9-1 with abcg31-1. The homozygous knockout plants were identified using genomic DNA-PCR and RT-PCR (Supplemental Figures 4A and 4B, respectively). The double knockout plants exhibited no prominent aberrant phenotype in terms of gross morphology or development when grown under normal conditions. To test whether the pollen surface of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 double knockout plants was defective, we observed wild-type and mutant pollen grains by scanning electron microscopy without any fixation step. In contrast to the wild-type and single knockout pollen, many of the abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen grains were shriveled up and clumped together (Figure 1, abcg9-1 abcg31-1). This phenotype was rescued by introducing ABCG9pro:sGFP:ABCG9 into abcg9-1 abcg31-1 mutant plants (Figure 1, Compl-1). There was no difference between the genotypes in terms of reticular pollen wall pattern (Figure 1). [[FIGURE]] The shriveled shape of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen grains led us to suspect that the mutant pollen does not function normally. To test this possibility, we performed a pollen viability assay by staining the pollen with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PPI; CITATION). About half of the pollen of the abcg9-1 abcg31-1 plants was dead, whereas the viability of abcg9-1 and abcg31-1 single mutant pollen did not differ from that of the wild type (Figure 2A; Supplemental Figure 5). To confirm that the striking pollen phenotype of the double knockout was caused by mutation of ABCG9 and ABCG31 and not by any other reason, we also generated abcg9-1 abcg31-2 by crossing abcg9-1 with abcg31-2. The homozygous knockout plants were identified using genomic DNA-PCR (Supplemental Figure 4A). We found a similar level of reduction in the pollen viability of abcg9-1 abcg31-2 to that of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 (Supplemental Figure 5). As both abcg9-1 abcg31-1 and abcg9-1 abcg31-2 mutants exhibited a similar phenotype, we used abcg9-1 abcg31-1 mutant plants for further analysis. [[FIGURE]] The reduced pollen viability of the abcg9 abcg31 plants was recovered by introducing ABCG9pro:sGFP:ABCG9 (Figure 2A). The pollen viability of lines 1 (Compl-1) and 3 (Compl-3) was completely recovered to wild-type levels (no significant difference), whereas that of line 2 (Compl-2) was partially recovered. The recovery levels of the phenotype in complementation lines matched well with the fluorescence intensity from sGFP:ABCG9 in the anthers (Figure 2B); lines with high levels of fluorescence intensity in the anthers exhibited high recovery rates in pollen viability. To examine whether the manifestation of the abcg9 abcg31 pollen phenotype depends on environmental conditions, two different phenotypic tests were conducted. First, pollen viability was tested again under humidity conditions (70%) much higher than those in our greenhouse (20 to 30%). The plants were grown in a chamber of intermediate humidity (50%) until flowering, and then half were transferred to 20 to 30% humidity conditions and the other half to 70% humidity conditions. Within 1 week, pollen viability was assayed for pollen collected from open flowers. While the pollen viability of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 was only ∼50% under 20 to 30% humidity, it recovered to ∼80% under 70% humidity. The pollen viability of the wild type was higher than 90% in both conditions (Figure 3A). [[FIGURE]] Cold shock is another environmental stress that affects pollen viability and, consequently, seed yield (CITATION). We investigated the viability of wild-type and abcg9 pollen after cold treatment. The viability of abcg9-1 or abcg9-2 single knockout pollen was reduced to ∼70% by cold treatment, whereas that of wild-type pollen was barely affected (Supplemental Figure 6). The decrease in mutant pollen viability under cold stress suggests that cold shock might also reduce the seed yield of the mutants. To test this possibility, wild-type, single knockout, and double knockout plants were grown in the greenhouse (22°C) for 4 weeks, and half of each genotype was incubated at 4.5°C for 7 d and returned to the greenhouse. The siliques from the cold shock–treated and nontreated plants were harvested after 3 weeks. Under normal conditions, all genotypes of plants tested produced as many as 40 seeds per silique (Figure 3B, Normal), indicating that fertilization was normal in the mutant plants. This is most likely due to the large excess of pollen grains compared with the number of ovules; thus, all of the mutant ovules were fertilized even when about half of the pollen grains were dead (Figure 2A). Cold treatment decreased the seed yield of all plants. However, the seed yield of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 plants was reduced to the greatest extent and corresponded to only 20 to 30% of that obtained from wild-type and single knockout plants (Figure 3B, Cold). The specific expression of ABCG9 and ABCG31 in stamens suggested by the in silico database was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays, and GFP-tagged protein localization (Figure 4). ABCG9 transcripts were detected by qRT-PCR mainly in the flowers and siliques but were barely detectable in vegetative tissues (Figure 4A). ABCG9 transcript levels were high between stages 9 and 12 of flower development and then declined during the later stages. This finding is in good agreement with data from the in silico microarray database showing that ABCG9 expression peaks at stages 10 and 11 and then decreases later (Supplemental Figure 1). To confirm this result, a promoter-GUS construct was produced by fusing the 2-kb fragment directly upstream of the ABCG9 start codon to the GUS reporter gene. In the T1 transgenic plants, a GUS signal was found in the anthers and developing siliques (Figures 4B and 4C; Supplemental Figure 7A). When the siliques were cleared, the chalazal region of the developing seeds was also found to exhibit a GUS signal (Supplemental Figure 7C), which matches the in silico data (Supplemental Figure 1). In young seedlings of T2 plants, the GUS signal was not detected (Supplemental Figure 7E). Next, ABCG9 localization in anther tissue was examined in the abcg9 abcg31 mutant expressing ABCG9pro:sGFP:ABCG9 that had been used for the complementation assay (Figures 1 and 2). Interestingly, sGFP signal occurred mostly in the tapetal cell layer (Figure 4E). The ABCG9pro:sGFP:ABCG9 signal appeared not only in a spatially specific manner but also in a temporally specific manner. The signal was apparent from the microspore stage until tapetum degeneration (Figures 4E and 4I) but not during earlier or later stages (Figures 4D and 4H, 4F and 4J, and 4G and 4K, respectively). [[FIGURE]] ABCG31 transcripts were detected in all tissues but were most abundant in flowers at stages 10 to 12 (F12), when ABCG9 expression was also high (Figures 4A and 4L). To observe the expression pattern of ABCG31 in flowers, ABCG31 promoter-GUS assays were performed. The fragment comprising the region from 2 kb upstream of the ABCG31 start codon to the second exon was fused to GUS. In the flowers of T1 transgenic plants, the GUS signal was found mainly in the anthers (Figure 4M). The GUS signal from developing siliques (Supplemental Figure 7B) was in the maternal tissues of siliques but not in the seed itself (Supplemental Figures 7D). Semithin sections of anthers revealed that ABCG31 is expressed in the pollen and tapetum of anthers from the tetrad stage to the tapetal degeneration stage (Figures 4O to 4Q) and in the pollen at the mature stage (Figure 4R). The GUS signal was most prominent at the unicellular stage and was much higher in the tapetum than in the pollen (Figure 4P). In young seedlings, the patterns of GUS expression were variable, even between individual plants of a single line; about two-thirds of the lines examined displayed the signal mainly in the whole shoots, including the vasculature, and most lines exhibited signal in the root vasculature, even though the expression levels varied (Supplemental Figure 7F). When the signal was weaker, the expression was more restricted to the tips of cotyledons and the basal parts of leaf petioles (Supplemental Figure 7G). ABCG31 was previously reported to be involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling (CITATION). Such variation in GUS pattern in the ABCG31pro:GUS lines is possibly due to differences in the ABA response. Together, these expression assays for ABCG9 and ABCG31 revealed that the tissue-specific expression pattern of ABCG9 matched that of ABCG31 in the developing anther and was consistent with information from the in silico coexpression database (Supplemental Data Set 2), supporting the possibility that ABCG9 and ABCG31 participate in a similar process. ABCG9 and ABCG31 have no putative targeting sequences known to direct the proteins to any intracellular compartment and are predicted to localize to the plasma membrane. To determine the precise intracellular localization of ABCG9 and ABCG31, we expressed sGFP-tagged ABCG9 or sGFP-tagged ABCG31 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in Nicotiana benthamiana cells using an agroinfiltration method (Figures 5A to 5C and 5D to 5F, respectively). The protoplasts isolated from leaves transformed with either sGFP-ABCG9 or sGFP-ABCG31 exhibited green fluorescence at the plasma membrane. Next, ABCG9 localization in anther tissue was examined in the ABCG9pro:sGFP:ABCG9-expressing abcg9 abcg31 Arabidopsis plants used for the complementation assay (Figures 1 and 2). Interestingly, sGFP signal was found exclusively in the tapetal cell layer (Figure 4E) and was localized to the plasma membrane (Figures 5G and 5H), which is consistent with the plasma membrane localization found in cells transformed with constructs driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Figures 5A and 5B). [[FIGURE]] Scanning electron microscopy images of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen revealed no alteration in exine patterns (Figure 1), suggesting that the pollen walls are normal and are not the cause of the pollen shriveling or decrease in viability. As we did not observe any defects in pollen development (Supplemental Figure 8), we suspected that the pollen coat was defective and thus might have caused the defects in pollen. We tested this possibility using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Just before anthesis, at the time when flowers bear mature pollen grains, the overall external appearance of abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen did not differ from that of the wild type (Figures 6A and 6C). However, differences were apparent in the pollen coat. In the wild type, the pollen coat of mature pollen grains was fully filled between neighboring baculae, which are column-like structures of sexine (outer exine; Figure 6B). In abcg9-1 abcg31-1 plants, however, the pollen coat was not completely filled and often was interspersed with vesicular or linear electron-lucent structures (Figure 6D, arrowheads). This irregular coat structure of the double knockout pollen resembled that of the immature pollen of the wild type at the beginning stage of pollen coat accumulation (Figure 6E; Supplemental Figure 9), which also contained similar electron-lucent structures (Figure 6F, arrowheads). [[FIGURE]] The unusual structures we found in the abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen coat may reflect reduced pollen coat contents or altered pollen coat composition in the mutant. As the pollen coat mainly consists of sterols, especially steryl ester, we performed sterol analysis using whole pollen grains. Although we expected that the mutant would have a reduced steryl ester content, the difference in free sterol and steryl ester contents between wild-type and abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen was not significant (Figure 7, inset graph; Supplemental Figure 10). By contrast, we found that abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen contained only about half of the amount of steryl glycosides present in wild-type or single knockout mutant pollen (Figure 7; see Supplemental Figure 11 for additional information on MW470 compounds). Another component enriched in the pollen coat is wax (CITATION). However, the wax contents of wild-type and double knockout mutant pollen did not differ much, at 20.1 and 20.2 μg/mg dry weight, respectively (Supplemental Figure 12). Furthermore, the mutant pollen did not differ from wild-type pollen in the level of brassinosteroids, steroid hormones that are greatly enriched in pollen (CITATION), with values of 219 and 199 pg/mg dry weight for wild-type and abcg9-1 abcg31-1 pollen, respectively (Supplemental Table 1). [[FIGURE]] In Arabidopsis, the biosynthesis of steryl glycosides is catalyzed mainly by two membrane-bound UDP-glucose:sterol glycosyltransferases, UGT80A2 and UGT80B1. Recently, CITATION generated a double knockout mutant, ugt80A2 ugt80B1, and showed that the mutant had significantly less steryl glycoside in the leaves, stems, inflorescences, and siliques. If the reduced steryl glycoside content in abcg9 abcg31 mutant pollen was the underlying cause for the reduction in pollen viability, the ugt80A2 ugt80B1 mutant, which is deficient in steryl glycoside biosynthesis, should also display a similar phenotype. To test this possibility, we performed a pollen viability assay under normal growth conditions and found that, like the abcg9 abcg31 mutants (Figure 2), the ugt80A2 ugt80B1 mutant pollen exhibited reduced viability (Figure 8A). Moreover, we found that the pollen coat of the ugt80A2 ugt80B1 mutant was often incomplete, containing vesicular or linear electron-lucent structures more frequently than that of the wild type (Figures 8B and 8C), although the defects were not as prominent as in pollen of the abcg9 abcg31 mutant (Figures 6B and 6D). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under a 16-h photoperiod at 22°C in a greenhouse with 20 to 30% humidity. Ecotype Columbia-0 was used, except for ugt80A2 ugt80B1, which was in a Wassilewskija background (CITATION). The abcg9 knockout mutants, abcg9-1 (SALK_045984) and abcg9-2 (SALK_047133), were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory. The abcg31 knockout mutants, abcg31-1 (WiscDsLox303G10) and abcg31-2 (GABI_064C11), were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory and GABI-Kat, respectively. The T-DNA insertion site of each mutant is presented in Supplemental Figures 2 and 3. The T-DNA insertion was verified by genomic DNA-PCR. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that abcg9 and abcg31 mutants did not produce ABCG9 and ABCG31 transcripts, respectively. The β-TUBULIN and UBIQUITIN genes were used as internal controls for ABCG9 and ABCG31, respectively. The abcg9 abcg31 double knockout mutants were generated from crosses between abcg9-1 and abcg31-1 (abcg9-1 abcg31-1) or between abcg9-1 and abcg31-2 (abcg9-1 abcg31-2). The T-DNA insertion in each gene was verified by genomic DNA-PCR, and the absence of both ABCG9 and ABCG31 transcripts in the double knockout mutant was confirmed by RT-PCR. For promoter-GUS expression, ABCG9pro:GUS and ABCG31pro:GUS constructs were generated. Construct information is available in Supplemental Table 3. Each final construct was introduced into wild-type Arabidopsis using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated floral dipping method (CITATION). To observe promoter-GUS expression in flowers and developing siliques, T1 plants from 58 (ABCG9pro:GUS) and 23 (ABCG31pro:GUS) independent transgenic lines were stained with GUS staining solution as described by CITATION. In the case of ABCG9, most lines exhibited similar expression patterns. In ABCG31, 18 lines displayed similar expression patterns, and the remaining lines had extended but nonspecific expression. To observe GUS expression in young seedlings, T2 plants from 18 independent 9-d-old transgenic lines each for ABCG9 and ABCG31 were examined after staining with GUS solution. All ABCG9 lines displayed similar expression patterns (no signal). ABCG31 lines varied in the levels and patterns of GUS expression, but 11 of these lines showed similar patterns in shoots and 10 in roots. Flowers and seedlings were incubated in GUS solution for 15 and 12 h, respectively. To observe GUS expression in specific floral tissues, GUS-stained flower buds were fixed and dehydrated as described by CITATION. The dehydrated samples were embedded in Technovit 7100 (Kulzer), and then serial sections (10-μm thick) were obtained using a Leica RM2245 rotary microtome. Sections were observed using a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope (Carl Zeiss). For detailed observation of the GUS signal driven by the ABCG9 promoter in the flower and silique, GUS-stained flowers and siliques from transgenic lines expressing ABCG9pro:GUS were cleared in chloral hydrate (chloral hydrate:water:glycerol, 8:2:1, w/v/v). Cleared flowers and siliques were observed using a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope. Individual developing seeds were separated from the silique using a syringe needle before observation. Total RNA was extracted from 2-week-old seedlings and from different tissues in mature wild-type plants. cDNA was synthesized from isolated RNAs by reverse transcription. qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR kit (Takara), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative abundance of cDNA was normalized against that of PP2A (CITATION). ABCG9- or ABCG31-overexpressing constructs (35Spro:sGFP:ABCG9 or 35Spro:sGFP:ABCG31) and the ABCG9 complementation construct (ABCG9pro:sGFP:ABCG9) were generated. Construct information is available in Supplemental Table 3. ABCG9 complementation lines were generated using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dipping method and then selected by growth on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 80 μg/mL gentamycin in the T1 generation and by antibiotic resistance and GFP fluorescence in the anthers in the T2 generation. One multiple-insertion line (Compl-1) and two single-insertion lines (Compl-2 and Compl-3) were chosen for the complementation assays. Each line was grown on antibiotic-containing medium, and the surviving plants were used for the assays. To investigate the subcellular localization of ABCG9 and ABCG31 in plant cells, Agrobacterium strain GV3101, which was transformed with 35Spro:sGFP:ABCG9 or 35Spro:sGFP:ABCG31 or anti-silencing vector RK19 to reduce the silencing of the transgenes, was grown in yeast extract–peptone liquid medium overnight. The culture was centrifuged at 1769g for 15 min and resuspended in AS medium (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.6, and 150 μM acetosyringone) by adjusting the OD to 0.7 to 0.8 at 600 nm. The RK19 clone was mixed with the ABCG9 or ABCG31 clone at a ratio of 1:1 to a final volume of 1 mL and incubated for 2 to 4 h. Well-watered 2- to 4-week-old N. benthamiana leaves were inoculated with each mixture using a syringe. Sixty-two hours after inoculation, the fluorescence was tested in transgenic N. benthamiana leaf discs. Then, the protoplasts were isolated by enzyme treatment and observed using a Zeiss Axioskop2 fluorescence microscope. GFP fluorescence was observed at 504 to 534 nm for emission and 465 to 485 nm for excitation, and chlorophyll autofluorescence was detected at 575 to 640 nm for emission and at 546/12 nm for excitation. Images obtained at the two spectral settings were overlaid. Flowers of the Compl-1 line were removed at various stages. The anthers were isolated from each flower using needles and then observed using an FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus) with spectral settings for GFP (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm). To visualize the anther cells, chlorophyll autofluorescence was observed at 543 nm for excitation and 613 nm for emission. Images obtained at the two spectral settings were overlaid. Pollen of freshly opened flowers from 4- to 5-week-old plants was incubated in a solution containing 0.5 μg/mL FDA and 2 μg/mL PPI for 5 min, and fluorescence images of the pollen were captured using a Zeiss Axioskop2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Carl Zeiss). The spectral settings of the microscope were 504 to 534 nm for emission and 465 to 485 nm for excitation to detect the FDA green fluorescence and 575 to 640 nm for emission and 546/12 nm for excitation to detect the PPI red fluorescence. The number of living (stained only by FDA) and dead (stained only by PPI) pollen grains was counted separately. In the pollen viability assay, the number of living pollen was presented as a percentage of the total number of pollen (i.e., the sum of the number of living and dead pollen). For the pollen viability assay under high humidity, 4-week-old plants were incubated in a humidity-controlled growth room with 70% humidity for the remainder of the assay. For the pollen viability assay after cold shock, 4-week-old plants were transferred to a 4°C growth chamber, incubated for 3 d, and then brought back to 22°C. After a 3-d recovery period, pollen viability was examined. To determine seed yield after cold shock and under normal conditions, 4-week-old plants were transferred to a 4.5°C growth chamber or kept at 22°C after removal of elongated siliques. For cold treatment, the plants were incubated at 4.5°C for 7 d and then brought back to 22°C. After 3 weeks, the seed number of three (cold shock) or four (normal condition) siliques for each plant was counted and averaged. To compare pollen development in wild-type and abcg9 abcg31 plants, floral buds were prepared at various developmental stages and embedded in Spurr’s resin as described by CITATION. Serial sections (2 μm thick) were obtained using a Leica RM2265 rotary microtome. Sections were mounted and observed as described by CITATION. To observe the pollen surface using scanning electron microscopy, the pollen of freshly opened flowers, immediately after anthesis, was applied directly to a sticky stub without any fixation. The pollen was sputter-coated with palladium and then observed using a LEO1450VP scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss). To observe the pollen coat using TEM, flowers just before anthesis were embedded in Spurr’s resin and processed as described above. To observe the accumulation of lipidic suborganelles in the tapetum using TEM, flowers at the stage just prior to tapetal degeneration were embedded in Spurr’s resin and processed as described above. Mature pollen was collected using the vacuum method (CITATION) from more than 3000 plants each for the wild type, abcg9-1, abcg31-1, and abcg9 abcg31, transferred into a glass vial, and freeze-dried. For sterol analysis, freeze-dried pollen was washed three times with 2 mL of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). After the addition of Celite to the extract, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the extracts were adsorbed onto Celite. The adsorbed samples were placed in a Sep-Pak Vac (silica, 2 g/12 cc; Waters) and eluted with 10 mL of hexane:CHCl3 (1:3), hexane:EtOAc (2:1), and CHCl3:methanol (1:1), and [25,26,26,26,27,27,27-2H7]cholesterol (98% 2H; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added to the extracts as an internal standard. The hexane:CHCl3 eluent (esterified sterol fraction) was dried and saponified with 1 mL of 4 M KOH in ethanol for 1 h at 80°C, and then 1 mL of water was added. The CHCl3:methanol eluent (steryl glycoside fraction) was dried and hydrolyzed with 1 mL each of methanol and 4 M HCl for 1 h at 80°C. These reaction mixtures were then extracted three times with 2 mL of hexane, and each hexane layer was evaporated to dryness. The hexane:ethyl acetate eluent (free sterol fraction) was dried in vacuo. These three residues were trimethylsilylated and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The endogenous levels of sterols were determined as the peak area ratios of molecular ions in the endogenous residue to those in the internal standard. GC-MS analyses were performed under the following conditions. A mass spectrometer (JMS-AM SUN200; JEOL) was connected to a gas chromatograph (6890A; Agilent Technologies) at an electron ionization of 70 eV, source temperature of 250°C, DB-1 column of 30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness of 0.25 μm (J&W Scientific), and an injection temperature of 250°C, and the following column temperature program was used: 80°C for 1 min, raised to 280°C at a rate of 95°C/min, and held at 280°C for 12 min. The interface temperature was 280°C, the carrier gas was helium, and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. Splitless injection was performed. Samples were trimethylsilylated with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 80°C for 30 min. The pollen wax analysis was performed with some modifications from that of CITATION and CITATION. Ten milligrams of freeze-dried pollen grains was transferred into a glass tube, and hexane and internal standards, n-octacosane, docosanoic acid, and 1-tricosanol, were added. The tube containing pollen grains was shaken at 5°C for 2 h, and then pollen wax was extracted. The solvent was removed under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. The remaining wax mixtures were incubated with bis-N,N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in pyridine for 30 min at 90°C to transform the waxes into trimethylsilyl derivatives. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using GC-MS (GCMS-QP2010; Shimazu) and gas chromatography (GC-2010; Shimazu) with an HP-5 column of 60 m × 0.32 mm and film thickness of 0.25 mm (Agilent). The following column temperature program was used: 220°C for 4.5 min, increased to 290°C at a rate of 2°C/min, and held at 290°C for 15 min. Each compound was quantified against the internal standard by automatically integrating the peak areas. For brassinosteroid analysis, freeze-dried pollen was washed twice with 100 mL of methanol:CHCl3 (4:1). Deuterium-labeled internal standards were added to the extracts. Purification and quantification of brassinosteroids were performed according to a previously described method (CITATION). Pollen from the same plants was used for the analyses of wax, brassinosteroid, and sterol contents. Primer information is available in Supplemental Table 2.
