!~ABS~! Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under various environmental stresses can damage intracellular polysaccharides, DNA, lipids and proteins. Methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) participates in a protein repair system that is one of the defensive mechanisms that diminishes oxidative destruction. In Arabidopsis, cytosolic MsrB7 and MsrB8 are oxidative stress-inducible protein repair enzymes that are abundant in the root. Here methyl viologen (MV) treatment was demonstrated to increase greatly the accumulation of H2O2 in MsrB7-knockdown, MsrB8-knockdown and wild-type Arabidopsis, but not in transgenic plants overexpressing MsrB7 or MsrB8. The reduction in H2O2 level under MV treatment in these overexpressing plants coincided with increased activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST), a herbicide-detoxifying enzyme. MsrB7 and MsrB8 are suggested to play an important role in defense against oxidative stress. Transgenic plants overexpressing MsrB7 or MsrB8 were viable and survived after MV and H2O2 treatment. Ectopic expression of specific cytosolic MsrB genes may be useful for application in crop improvement.
!~RES~! Among the nine MsrB genes in Arabidopsis, MsrB5, MsrB7, MsrB8 and MsrB9 are prevalently expressed at higher levels in roots (CITATION). MsrB7 and MsrB8 genes are located close to each other on chromosome 4, and their amino acid sequences share high sequence identity (95.1%). Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP)–MsrB7/8 fusion genes (GFP::MSRB) as well as GFP were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Subcellular localization studies indicated that MSRB7 and MSRB8 are localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) results indicated that MsrB7, MsrB8 and MsrB5 were abundantly expressed in roots, moderately expressed in the stalks and expressed at low levels in leaves and flowers (Fig. 1B, C; Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, MsrB6 was abundantly expressed in leaves, moderately expressed in roots and expressed at low levels in flowers (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In order to clarify the potential function of these cytosolic MSRBs in response to oxidative stress, the expression pattern of the MsrB genes in Arabidopsis seedlings was analyzed under time-course MV treatment (20 µM) using real-time PCR. MsrB7 and MsrB8 mRNA rapidly accumulated within 30 min, and peaked after 12 or 24 h under MV treatment, respectively (Fig. 1D, E). Expression of MsrB5 was also inducible by oxidative stress after MV treatment for 4 h which was later than that of MsrB7 and MsrB8 (Supplementary Fig. S1C), and peaked after 24 h. Nevertheless, expression of MsrB6 showed no significant difference within 8 h of MV treatment, and was further down-regulated after MV treatment for 12 h (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These results suggest that MsrB7, MsrB8 and MsrB5, but not MsrB6, are stress inducible and may play important roles in stress defense responses.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] No MsrB7 and MsrB8 knockout lines are available from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA); therefore, to investigate the biological function of MsrB7/8 genes in stress response, we generated overexpression (B7Ox and B8Ox) and RNA interference (RNAi)-silenced knockdown expression (B7i and B8i) transgenic Arabidopsis lines (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Since MsrB7 and MsrB8 share extremely high sequence identity, we used their 5′ region [including the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) and partial coding sequence] for RNAi (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and designed MsrB-specific primers for the 3′-UTR to distinguish the expression of each gene by RT–PCR or real-time PCR (Supplementary Table S1). The MsrB7 and B8 transgenes were abundantly expressed in the overexpression lines (Fig. 2A, B). Under normal growth conditions, some endogenous MsrB7 and MsrB8 transcripts were present in 10-day-old wild-type seedlings, and could be detected by real-time PCR (Fig. 2C). In contrast, expression of endogenous MsrB7 and B8 was reduced in the knockdown plants (Fig. 2C). Hygromycin-resistant homozygous T3 lines, including overexpression and knockdown lines, then underwent the following treatments. Ten-day-old B7Ox, B8Ox, B7i, B8i and wild-type seedlings were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium, and the primary root lengths of these plants were measured (Fig. 2D, E). The growth phenotype indicated that MsrB7 knockdown lines had longer primary roots, while both MsrB7 and MsrB8 overexpression lines had shorter primary roots as compared with wild-type seedlings.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Ten-day-old B7Ox, B8Ox, B7i, B8i and wild-type seedlings were grown in the presence or absence of 20 mM H2O2 or 20 µM MV for 3 d (Fig. 3A, D). Subsequently, the Chl content and ion leakage levels were measured. The H2O2- or MV-treated RNAi lines and wild-type seedlings showed a severe bleaching phenotype with drastically reduced (>60%) Chl content, but the MsrBOx plants showed only a minor alteration in phenotype (10–40% reduction) (Fig. 3B, E). Furthermore, the Chl content declined much more sharply in the B7i and B8i lines than in wild-type plants. We also examined membrane integrity by monitoring electrolyte leakage in H2O2- or MV-treated MsrBOx plants. H2O2 or MV treatment caused severe ion leakage in wild-type plants (60%) and in RNAi lines (75%); in contrast, only mild to moderate ion leakage was detected (30–50%) in MsrBOx plants (Fig. 3C, F). These results indicate that cytosolic MsrB overexpression in Arabidopsis protects cells from both MV- and H2O2-induced oxidative stresses.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Two lines each of B7Ox and B8Ox homozygous T3 seeds were directly sown in soil. MV (20 µM) was applied to 3-week-old seedlings by spraying directly onto the leaves. Two days after MV spraying, the wild-type plants showed severe wilting, while the transgenic plants remained relatively healthy (Fig. 4A). Fresh weight and ion leakage were measured in both the wild-type plants and the transgenic lines. In agreement with the observed phenotype, the B7Ox and B8Ox transgenic plants showed significantly less reduction in fresh weight and ion leakage after MV treatment than the wild-type plants (Fig. 4B, C). These results indicate that MsrBOx plants also conferred tolerance to MV under soil-based culture conditions.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In situ measurements by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining showed that there was less H2O2 accumulation in B7Ox and B8Ox transgenic plants than in knockdown (B7i and B8i) and wild-type plants (Fig. 5A). To elucidate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the protection from oxidative stress conferred by expression of various MsrB genes, we tested the activity of various ROS-scavenging enzymes such as catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and peroxidase (PX). The activity of each enzyme was measured in wild-type plants and in individual MsrB transgenic lines that had undergone treatment with MV for 1 d (Fig. 5). CAT, PX and GST activities were induced in all the MV-treated plants (Fig. 5B–D). In both the presence and absence of MV, the endogenous levels of CAT and PX were lower in MsrBOx than in wild-type plants (Fig. 5B, C), but higher in RNAi lines. GST activity displayed no significant difference in any of the treated plants under control conditions, whereas it was elevated in MsrBOx plants in comparison with RNAi and wild-type plants upon MV treatment (Fig. 5D). Taken together, CAT and PX activities were higher in the MsrB RNAi lines under oxidative stress, whereas GST activity remained higher in MsrB overexpression lines than in wild-type Arabidopsis.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To verify whether all of the cytosolic MsrB genes constitutively expressed in plants can confer tolerance to oxidative stress, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing cytosolic MsrB5, MsrB6, MsrB7, MsrB8 and MsrB9, with plastidial MsrB2 as a control. Seeds of the wild type, B5Ox, B6Ox, B7Ox and the MsrB5 and B6 double overexpression (B5B6Ox) transgenic plants were germinated on medium supplemented with various concentrations of MV (0, 100, 200 and 300 nM) for 10 d (Supplementary Fig. S3). Initially, the wild-type and transgenic plant seeds germinated well. However, after 10 d, wild-type seedlings ceased to grow on media containing 200 and 300 nM MV. The growth of B6Ox seedlings was inhibited by MV at ≥100 nM. The development of true leaves on B5Ox seedlings was not affected by MV at <300 nM. Transgenic B7Ox seedlings displayed the most robust growth at all concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The B5B6Ox plants grew well on medium containing 300 nM MV, but the growth of true leaves was slightly inhibited in comparison with the B7Ox phenotype. B7Ox tested at higher MV concentrations (400 and 500 nM) showed reasonably good growth (data not shown). Since B7Ox exhibited robust growth with greener leaves at 300 nM, we decided to use 300 nM for further experiments. To confirm the germination and growth of other MsrB transgenic plants, including cytosolic MsrB genes (B5B6Ox, B7Ox, B8Ox and B9Ox), with plastidial MsrB (B2Ox) as a control, their seeds along with those of wild-type plants were sown on media with or without MV (300 nM). B2Ox, B8Ox and B9Ox showed a germination pattern similar to that of B7Ox (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The growth of B5B6Ox was similar to or better than that of the wild type at 300 nM MV; however, B5B6Ox did not grow as well as B7Ox, B8Ox and B9Ox at 300 nM MV (Supplementary Fig. S3). In conclusion, transgenic plants overexpressing cytsolic MsrB7, MsrB8, MsrB9 and plastidial MsrB2 showed more tolerance to MV compared with MsrB5, MsrB6 overexpression lines and wild-type plants. Transgene integration in the putative transgenic tomato (variety MicroTom) plants was initially confirmed by PCR. Southern hybridization was used to confirm transgene integration in the putative transgenic plants (Fig. 6). Genomic DNA from three randomly picked MsrB7 transgenic tomato plants was digested with HindIII and probed with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled Hpt (hygromycin phosphotransferase) (Fig. 6A). Multiple transgene insertions of Hpt were observed.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The transgenic tomato plants were further tested for transgene expression by RT–PCR using MsrB genes, Hpt and tomato Actin1 (SlAct1) primers, or by real-time PCR using MsrB7/8 forward primer (MsrB7/8-qF2) and Nos terminator reverse primer (Nos3′R), and SlUBI3 primers (Supplementary Table S1). The AtMsrB7 transgene (B7-nos) and Hpt were highly expressed in individually tested transgenic plants (Fig. 6B, C). A non-transformed wild-type sample that showed no transgene amplification signal was used as the control. The housekeeping gene SlAct1 or SlUBI3 served to normalize sample-to-sample variation in amounts of RNA. The emerged, fully expanded leaves of 2-month-old B7Ox and wild-type tomato plants were detached and treated with 20 µM MV for 3 d (Fig. 6D). Subsequently, H2O2 accumulation and Chl content were measured. DAB staining in situ showed less H2O2 accumulation in three independent lines of B7Ox transgenic tomato plants than in wild-type plants (Fig. 6E). In addition, the Chl content remained higher in MV-treated B7Ox lines than in MV-treated wild-type leaflets (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that overexpression of MsrB7 can protect tomato plants from MV-induced oxidative stress by reducing H2O2 accumulation. To verify whether AtMsrB7 overexpression had a negative influence on growth, development and yield, we also generated AtMsrB7-overexpressing CL5915 transgenic tomato (Supplementary Fig. S4), and calculated the fruit number (FN) per plant, seed number (SN) per fruit and fresh weight (FW) of the T1 progeny of transgenic and wild-type tomato plants (Table 1). Transgenic plants exhibited normal phenotype and no yield drag compared with wild-type plants. 
!~MM~! Six MSR genes, MsrB2 (At4g21860), MsrB5 (At4g04830), MsrB6 (At4g04840), MsrB7 (At4g21830), MsrB8 (At4g21840) and MsrB9 (At4g21850), were isolated by RT–PCR from 3-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia seedlings. The coding sequences of these MsrB genes were amplified using the primers indicated (Supplementary Table S1) and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and the DNA sequence was determined using an ABI PRISM 373 automatic DNA sequencing system. To construct the binary vector, EcoRI/BglII fragments for MsrB7 and BamHI/SpeI fragments for MsrB2, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were subcloned into the pCAMBIA1390/35S plasmid (CITATION) to form the pMsrB7 and pMsrBX (X = 2, 5, 6,8 and 9) vectors (Supplementary Fig. S2). These plasmids were transformed by electroporation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) or LBA4404 for Arabidopsis and tomato transformation, respectively. To generate knockdown expression plants, specific 5′-UTRs with partial coding sequences of MsrB7 and MsrB8 were cloned into the pH7GWIWG vector (Invitrogen), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2, Supplementary Table S1). These plasmids were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) cells by electroporation. For subcellular localization, coding sequences of MsrB genes were subcloned into p2FGW7 (Invitrogen) to generate GFP::MsrB fusion genes driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. Protoplasts were isolated using the Tape–Arabidopsis sandwich method and transformed using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method (CITATION). After incubation at room temperature for 16 h in the light, protoplasts were observed with a Zeiss LSM510 META laser scanning confocal microscope. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia plants were grown in controlled-environment chambers at 22°C, 70% relative humidity, with a 16 h photoperiod (about 120 µmol m–2 s–1). The floral dip transformation method was used to generate transgenic Arabidopsis as described previously (CITATION). T1 transgenic plants constitutively expressing AtMsrB genes were selected on MS medium [4.3 g of MS salt (Duchfa), MS vitamins, 1% sucrose, 0.5 g l–1 MES, pH 5.7, 0.4% agargel (Sigma)] with 20 mg l–1 hygromycin. The sensitivity of wild-type and homozygous transgenic T2 seeds (T3 generation) to different concentrations of MV was assessed on the basis of the percentage of seedlings germinated at the end of 1 week. For the MV tolerance experiments, surface-sterilized transformant seeds were spread on MS medium with 0–300 nM MV. The plates were sealed with 3 M micropore tape, covered with aluminum foil, and then left at 4°C for 24 h. Seeds were left to germinate at 24°C in the dark for 1 d. Subsequently, they were incubated for 7 d at 22°C, on a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. For oxidative stress treatments, wild-type and transgenic homozygous T3 seeds were sown on MS medium. Ten-day-old seedlings were transferred to 20 µM MV- or 20 mM H2O2-containing MS medium for 3 d, and then tested against the oxidative stress tolerance indexes described below. Seeds of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) varieties Microtom and CL5915-93D4-1-0-3 (CL5915), kindly provided by AVRDC, The World Vegetable Center, were soaked at 32°C for 1 h, surface-sterilized for 15 min with 1% sodium hypochlorite, washed extensively with sterilized water and subsequently germinated on MS medium with a 16 h photoperiod at 26°C. Cotyledons detached from 14-day-old seedlings were cut into 0.5 cm square pieces and transformed by A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring the binary vector p35:AtMsrB7 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Subsequent plant transformation followed the procedure described in CITATION. Transformed cotyledons were selected 2–4 times (every 7 d) on freshly prepared MSZT medium (4.3 g l–1 MS salts, pH 6.0, Nitsch vitamins, 3% sucrose, 0.4% agargel, 2 mg l–1 zeatin, 200 mg l–1 timentin) containing either 10 or 20 mg l–1 hygromycin, and transferred to regeneration medium (4.3 g l–1 MS salts, pH 6.0, Nitsch vitamins, 3% sucrose, 0.3% phytagel, 200 mg l–1 timentin) without the selection agent. For Microtom and CL5915 cultivars, 20 and 10 mg l–1 hygromycin were used for selection, respectively. The putative transgenic plants were confirmed by Southern blotting and RT–PCR before being transplanted into pots and grown in a greenhouse to obtain self-pollinated T1 progeny seeds. Plant growth conditions were 26°C with a diurnal cycle of 16 h light/8 h darkness and a light intensity of 120 µmol photons m–2 s–1 as described (CITATION). To identify positive transformants, genomic DNA was extracted from all seedlings grown on MS medium with 20 mg l–1 hygromycin. The genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and probed with the Hpt gene. The Hpt cDNA fragment isolated from pCAMBIA1390 was labeled with DIG-11-dUTP (Roche) by PCR (primers shown in Supplementary Table S1) following the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). Total RNA was isolated from plant tissues using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen) and then used for Northern blotting or semi-quantitative RT–PCR. For RT–PCR, the cDNA was synthesized using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Promega). All primers of MsrB genes were designed to distinguish each gene in the MsrB family, as shown in Supplementary Table S1. Endogenous/transgenic MsrB7, MsrB8, MsrB9 and Hpt expression in the MsrB7–9 transgenic lines were analyzed by RT–PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture containing cDNA (from 5 ng of total RNA as described above), 0.125 mM dNTPs, 0.25 µM of each forward and reverse primer (Supplementary Table S1), 2 µl of 10× NEB Taq buffer, and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) in a total volume of 20 µl. The mixture was incubated at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. The Actin2 expression level was used as a quantitative control. Real-time PCR amplification was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix [Applied Biosystems (ABI)]. Amplification was monitored in real-time utilizing the ABI 7500HT sequence detection system. Data were analyzed using ABI SDS 1.4 software. Relative transcript levels were normalized to the reference gene Actin2 or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) for Arabidopsis (CITATION), and SlUBI3 for tomato using the comparative CT method. Accumulation of H2O2 was detected by staining Arabidopsis seedlings with DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (CITATION). Whole plants from 10-day-old wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis grown in the medium were subjected to 20 µM MV for 3 d before being immersed in 1 mg ml–1 DAB in 15 ml test tubes overnight under dim light. The stained seedlings were briefly rinsed twice in deionized water and then soaked in 95% ethanol. The tubes were incubated in a boiling water bath until the Chl was completely removed from the leaves. The stained seedlings were then stored in 95% ethanol until photographs were taken. Leaf Chl was extracted from fresh plant material with N,N-dimethylformamide and the content was determined using a spectrophotometer as described (CITATION). The ion leakage percentage of wild-type and MsrB transgenic plants treated with MV or H2O2 was measured as previously described (CITATION). At the end of 24 h treatment with 20 µM MV, 100 mg of tissue was harvested from 10-day-old wild-type and MsrB transgenic Arabidopsis and homogenized in 0.5 ml of chilled potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4, with 1 mM EDTA). After centrifugation at 10,000×g for 15 min at 4°C, the soluble protein fractions were quantified by the Bradford method (CITATION). CAT activity was determined and defined according to the manufacturer’s manual (Cayman Chemical Company). For PX activity, each assay mixture (1 ml) consisted of 33.3 µl of soluble protein extract, potassium phosphate buffer (16.7 mM, pH 5.8), 7.2 mM guaiacol and 11.7 mM H2O2. Absorbance was measured once per minute at 470 nm with a spectrophotometer. The PX activity (U g–1) was calculated using the equation: ΔA470 ÷ 26.6 × dilution factor ÷Δt (min) ÷ FW (g). The unit was defined as 1 µmol tetraguaiacol produced per minute (CITATION). Ten-day-old wild-type and AtMsrB transgenic Arabidopsis were treated with 20 µM MV for 24 h. Plant tissue (300 mg) was homogenized in 0.6 ml of chilled 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.5) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P9599). The GST activity was measured by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) assay as described previously (CITATION). Data are presented as mean values ± SD. Differences were evaluated for significance by Duncan’s multiple range test or Student’s t-test, with statistical significance defined as P ≤ 0.01 or P ≤ 0.05.
