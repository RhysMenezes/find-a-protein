!~ABS~! Protein S-acylation, commonly known as palmitoylation, is a reversible posttranslational modification that catalyzes the addition of a saturated lipid group, often palmitate, to the sulfhydryl group of a Cys. Palmitoylation regulates enzyme activity, protein stability, subcellular localization, and intracellular sorting. Many plant proteins are palmitoylated. However, little is known about protein S-acyl transferases (PATs), which catalyze palmitoylation. Here, we report that the tonoplast-localized PAT10 is critical for development and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. PAT10 loss of function resulted in pleiotropic growth defects, including smaller leaves, dwarfism, and sterility. In addition, pat10 mutants are hypersensitive to salt stresses. We further show that PAT10 regulates the tonoplast localization of several calcineurin B–like proteins (CBLs), including CBL2, CBL3, and CBL6, whose membrane association also depends on palmitoylation. Introducing a C192S mutation within the highly conserved catalytic motif of PAT10 failed to complement pat10 mutants, indicating that PAT10 functions through protein palmitoylation. We propose that PAT10-mediated palmitoylation is critical for vacuolar function by regulating membrane association or the activities of tonoplast proteins.
!~RES~! We used a reverse genetic approach to understand the function of Arabidopsis PATs and identified two T-DNA insertion lines for PAT10. T-DNA was inserted at the 10th intron or the 10th exon of PAT10 genomic sequence for pat10-1 (SALK_024964) and pat10-2 (WiscDsLox289_292E10), respectively. By PCR analysis, we confirmed that the genomic sequences upstream and downstream of the insertion sites were intact in mutants. To find out whether the T-DNA insertions disrupted PAT10 expression, we performed RT-PCR analysis on RNAs isolated from seedlings of the wild type and pat10 mutants. RT-PCRs with a primer pair that amplified upstream sequences of T-DNA insertions detected PAT10 transcript in both the wild type and pat10. However, no transcript was detected in pat10 mutants when primer pairs flanking the T-DNA insertion sites were used (Figures 1A and 1B), suggesting that pat10 mutants were not able to produce full-length PAT10. Experiments using both pat10-1 and pat10-2 produced identical results. Therefore, results reported hereafter were those obtained with pat10-1 unless noted. [[FIGURE]] Homozygous pat10 mutants displayed pleiotropic developmental defects compared with the wild type under soil growth condition. pat10 was substantially smaller and developed more slowly. As a result, growth differences became more pronounced over time. Rosette leaves of pat10 were much smaller than those of the wild type at 20 d after germination (DAG) (Figure 1C), although leaf shape was normal (Figure 1C). The size reduction was due to reduced cell number as well as reduced cell expansion (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). In addition, pat10 showed early senescence on the leaf tips when growing in soil at 20 DAG (Figure 1C). During floral transition, pat10 showed no correlation between flowering time and rosette leaf number such that they flowered temporally later but had fewer rosette leaves than the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 2 online), likely a consequence of slow development. Inflorescence stems were much shorter for pat10 than for the wild type (Figure 1D). Mutant flowers (Figure 1F) were also smaller than those of the wild type (Figure 1E). Although stamen filaments of pat10 were shorter than the wild type, pistils of pat10 mutants were also shorter (Figures 1E and 1F), allowing reaching of stigma surface by pollen. pat10 growing in soil were completely sterile (Figure 1D) without elongating siliques (Figure 1H). Although we were able to obtain homozygous pat10 mutants from self-pollinated heterozygous pat10, the ratio of homozygous to heterozygous mutants was much lower than expected (Table 1). This suggested that the loss of PAT10 led to gametophytic defects. To find out which gametophyte was defective due to PAT10 loss of function, we performed reciprocal crosses between heterozygous pat10 mutants and the wild type. Results showed that pollen of pat10 did not transmit as well as that of the wild type, while female gametophytes were not affected (Table 1). These results suggested that the defective male gametophytes were caused by PAT10 loss of function. To find out at which stage male gametophytes of pat10 was defective, we next analyzed pollen viability using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and Alexander’s stain. No differences were observed regarding pollen viability between the wild type and pat10 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online), suggesting that PAT10 did not regulate pollen viability. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the deposition of the pollen coat was abnormal in homozygous pat10 mutants (Figures 2C and 2F), even though no difference was observed in the pollen coats of heterozygous pat10 plants (Figures 2B and 2E) versus in the wild type (Figures 2A and 2D). Because deposition of the pollen coat depends on the sporophytic tapetum, we concluded that PAT10 loss of function also caused sporophytic male defects. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further confirmed the pollen coat defect of pat10 (Figure 2J), whereas pat10 pollen contained fewer lipid bodies (Figure 2L) than the wild type (Figure 2I). [[FIGURE]] We further analyzed in vitro pollen germination and growth. A low percentage of pat10 pollen germinated (Figures 3A and 3B). Pollen germination of heterozygous pat10 was also significantly reduced compared with the wild type (Figures 3A and 3B), suggesting that mutations at PAT10 not only caused sporophytic male defects but also affected gametophytic male function. Mutant pollen tubes ceased growth early, resulting in short tubes (Figures 3A and 3C). [[FIGURE]] To find out whether PAT10 regulated pollen tube growth in vivo, we performed aniline blue staining on emasculated wild-type pistils hand-pollinated with pollen either from the wild type or pat10. At 9 h after pollination (HAP) when most wild-type pollen tubes reached to the bottom of a pistil (Figure 3D), pollen tubes of pat10 just emerged from the style (Figure 3E). At 48 HAP, all ovules in pistils pollinated by the wild type were fertilized and developing (Figure 3F). By contrast, few ovules were targeted by pat10 pollen tubes at 48 HAP despite the fact that the mutant pollen tubes had reached the bottom of the pistils (Figure 3G). These results suggested that polar and directional growth of pollen tubes was compromised by PAT10 loss of function. Our reciprocal analysis using the wild type and heterozygous pat10 mutants indicated that female gametophytes were not affected by PAT10 loss of function. However, reciprocal crosses using wild-type pollen and pat10 pistils failed to produce seeds. To find out whether PAT10 loss of function caused sporophytic female defects, we performed aniline blue staining on pat10 pistils pollinated with wild-type pollen. At 24 HAP, when wild-type pollen tubes reached to the bottom of wild-type pistils (Figure 4A), they hardly reached to the middle of pat10 pistils (Figure 4B), suggesting that pat10 pistils could not support pollen tube growth. SEM analysis of mature ovules did not reveal morphological differences between the wild type (Figure 4C) and pat10 (Figure 4D) regarding ovule integuments. We further performed optical sections on unfertilized mature ovules as well as ovules immediately after fertilization. Interestingly, embryo sacs of pat10 were found to be disorganized at the chalazal end (Figure 4I) compared with the ordered organization in the wild type (Figure 4E). In contrast with normal embryo development in the wild type after fertilization (Figures 4F to 4H), embryo sacs of pat10 gradually degenerated likely due to fertilization failure (Figures 4J to 4L). No such embryo sac defects were observed in ovules from heterozygous pat10 mutants (see Supplemental Figure 4 online), which correlated with the normal transmission of mutant female gametophytes during reciprocal crosses (Table 1). [[FIGURE]] The pleiotropic developmental defects by PAT10 loss of function suggested a constitutive expression pattern. Indeed, PAT10 was previously found to be expressed in all tissues via microarray analysis (CITATION). In addition, we analyzed the expression pattern of PAT10 using ProPAT10:GUS (for β-glucuronidase) reporter lines by histochemical analysis. GUS signals were detected in mature embryos, cotyledons, and whole seedlings (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D). In mature leaves, the GUS signal was highest at hydathodes as well as in guard cells (Figure 5C). PAT10 was strongly expressed at the sites of lateral root initiation and at root tips (Figure 5E). Dissection of GUS signals in vascular bundles showed that PAT10 was expressed strongly in phloem but not in xylem (Figures 5F and 5G). [[FIGURE]] It is intriguing that the GUS signal was not detected at most reproductive tissues (Figure 5H), whereas PAT10 loss of function resulted in developmental defects. We reasoned that the promoter sequences used to generate ProPAT10:GUS reporter lines might not contain all of the information required for expression. Therefore, we next performed RNA in situ hybridization to find out whether PAT10 was expressed in reproductive tissues. Indeed, PAT10 was strongly expressed in the tapetal layer of developing anthers starting from anther developmental stage 6 (Figures 6A and 6B). With tapetal degeneration, PAT10 expression gradually increased in developing microspores (Figures 6C and 6D) and in mature pollen (Figures 6E and 6F). PAT10 was also expressed at the embryo sacs and surrounding cells in mature pistils (Figures 6G and 6H). In addition, no signal was detected in reproductive organs when identical RNA in situ hybridization was performed in pat10 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), indicating that the probe was specific for PAT10 without cross-reacting with the other 23 PATs (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that the pleiotropic developmental defects were caused by PAT10 loss of function, we performed a complementation study in which we introduced a PAT10 genomic fragment green fluorescent protein (GFP) translational fusion (PAT10-GFP) into pat10. Exogenous PAT10 expression rescued all defects of the pat10 mutants (see Supplemental Figure 6 online), confirming the null mutant identity of pat10. Since the GFP translational fusion did not interfere with the function of PAT10, we therefore used it to study the subcellular localization of PAT10 by fluorescence microscopy. Unlike the ProPAT10:GUS reporter lines, which showed no signal in most reproductive tissues, the GFP signal was detected in pollen (see Supplemental Figure 7 online), confirming that PAT10 expression in reproductive tissues or cells requires intronic sequences. Because animal PATs can have functions independent of their enzymatic activities (CITATION), we wondered whether Arabidopsis PAT10 regulated development through its S-acyl transferase activity. Therefore, we introduced a point mutation at PAT10 so that the conserved DHHC motif was changed to DHHS (PAT10C192S), as such a mutation was previously shown to abolish PAT activity (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The exogenous PAT10C192S-GFP did not rescue pat10 (see Supplemental Figure 8 online), suggesting that PAT10 functions through its palmitate transferase activity. The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis PATs was recently performed via transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves (CITATION). When PAT10 was transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells, this protein mostly colocalized with a Golgi marker but reached the tonoplast several days later (CITATION). We introduced the Wave lines expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled endomembrane markers (CITATION) into the complemented plants (PAT10-GFP;pat10-1) for analysis via confocal fluorescence microscopy. PAT10 did not colocalize with the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) marker (Figure 7A) nor the Golgi marker (Figure 7B) or the prevacuolar compartment marker (Figure 7C). Instead, PAT10 showed significantly colocalization with the tonoplast marker WAVE9R (Figure 7D) (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] We also performed an uptake study in the complemented lines expressing PAT10-GFP in pat10 using the endocytic dye FM4-64 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). After 3 h of FM4-64 uptake, the GFP signal completely merged with FM4-64 at the tonoplast (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). Addition of Brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal toxin that interferes with vesicle trafficking at the Golgi and the TGN/EE (CITATION), caused aggregation of FM4-64–positive vesicles but not PAT10-labeled compartments. Since PAT10C192S-GFP did not rescue pat10, we next wanted to find out if the C192S mutation altered its subcellular localization, thus failing to complement. An FM4-64 uptake study was performed in lines expressing PAT10C192S-GFP. Similar to PAT10-GFP, the majority of PAT10C192S-GFP localized at the tonoplast together with FM4-64 after 3 h uptake (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). However, in contrast with PAT10 (see Supplemental Figure 9 online), additional punctate vesicles were detected for PAT10C192S (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Such punctate localization was also detected in pollen tubes expressing PAT10C192S but not in pollen tubes expressing PAT10 (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). Upon BFA treatment, these GFP-labeled vesicles aggregated to regions surrounding the FM4-64–positive BFA compartments (se Supplemental Figure 10 online), indicating that these vesicles were Golgi apparatus (CITATION). The tonoplast localization of PAT10 prompted us to test the responses of pat10 to salt and osmotic stresses because vacuoles are critical organelles for plant responses to these abiotic stresses (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We applied various stresses to pat10, including high concentrations of NaCl, LiCl, KCl, CsCl, CaCl2, mannitol, and abscisic acid. The pat10 mutants were hypersensitive to NaCl and LiCl, as pat10 grew poorly under high NaCl and LiCl stresses (Figures 8A to 8C). [[FIGURE]] Next, we tested the expression of salt-responsive genes, such as RESPONSIVE TO DESSICATION 29A (RD29A), RD20, EARLY RESPONSIVE TO DESSICATION10 (ERD10), and RESPONSIVE TO ABA18 (RAB18), whose expression was greatly induced by abiotic stresses (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that salt stresses significantly induced higher expression of RD29A, RD20, and ERD10 in pat10 than in the wild type (Figure 8D). Although the absolute increase of RAB18 was slightly lower in pat10 than in the wild type, the induction ratio of RAB18 in pat10 was comparable to that of the wild type (Figure 8D). However, PAT10 itself was not induced by salt stresses (CITATION). The hypersensitivity of pat10 to salt stresses gave us a hint about candidate substrates of PAT10. Arabidopsis CBLs play critical roles in abiotic stress responses (CITATION; CITATION). Tonoplast localization of CBL2 is regulated by palmitoylation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In addition, the Cys residues for palmitoylation were conserved among several tonoplast-localized CBLs, such as CBL3 and CBL6, indicating that they are likely modified by palmitoylation. We therefore hypothesized that the tonoplast-localized, palmitoylated CBLs are substrates of PAT10. To find out whether the palmitoylation-regulated tonoplast localization of CBL2 relies on PAT10, we tested the subcellular localization of GFP-fused CBL2 in wild-type or pat10 protoplasts. CBL2-GFP expressed in the wild-type protoplasts showed tonoplast localization (Figure 9). However, CBL2-GFP expressed in pat10 was relocated to the cytoplasm (Figure 9), similar to soluble GFP (Figure 9). Because the Cys residues proven to be the palmitoylation sites in CBL2 (CITATION) were also present in CBL3 and CBL6, we suspected that their tonoplast localization was also regulated by PAT10. Indeed, both CBL3 and CBL6 were localized at the tonoplast in wild-type protoplasts, but they became cytosolic in pat10 protoplasts (Figure 9). Treatment with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a specific inhibitor of protein palmitoylation (CITATION; CITATION), caused relocalization of CBL2/3/6 from the tonoplast to cytoplasm in wild-type protoplasts (see Supplemental Figure 11 online), confirming their palmitoylation-regulated tonoplast localization. Taken together, these results suggested that CBL2/3/6 are putative substrates of PAT10. [[FIGURE]] To exclude the possibility that loss of CBL2/3/6 tonoplast localization was caused by a general reduction of cellular palmitoylation owing to PAT10 loss of function, we introduced CBL9 and ARA6 into pat10 protoplasts. The plasma membrane–localized CBL9 (CITATION) and the endosome-localized ARA6 (CITATION) both contain sequences for palmitoylation and regulate plant responses to abiotic stresses (CITATION; CITATION). The plasma membrane localization of CBL9 was abolished by 2-BP treatment (see Supplemental Figure 11 online), suggesting that its membrane association depended on palmitoylation. However, membrane association of both CBL9 and ARA6 was retained in pat10 (see Supplemental Figure 10 online), indicating that PAT10 loss of function did not reduce protein palmitoylation globally. The membrane localization of ARA7 (a marker for TGN/EE) (CITATION) as well as that of ERD2 (a marker for Golgi apparatus) (CITATION) were not affected by PAT10 loss of function (Supplemental Figure 12 online), suggesting that the integrity of the endomembrane system was intact.
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana WAVE lines expressing RFP fusions for the TGN (WAVE2R), Golgi (WAVE22R), prevacuolar compartment (WAVE3R), and the tonoplast (WAVE9R) (CITATION) were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Center (http://Arabidopsis.info). The T-DNA insertion lines SALK_024964 (pat10-1) and WiscDsLox289_292E10 (pat10-2) were obtained from the ABRC (http://www.Arabidopsis.org). The Columbia-0 ecotype was used as the wild type. Arabidopsis plants were grown in a 4:1:1 mix of Fafard 4P:perlite:vermiculite under an 18-h-light/6-h-dark cycle at 21°C. For growth on plates, surface-sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were placed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium with vitamins (Phytotechlab) except where noted. Plates were kept at 4°C in darkness for 4 d before being transferred to a growth chamber with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle at 21°C. Stable Arabidopsis transformations were produced using the floral dipping method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 30 µg/mL Basta salt (Sigma-Aldrich). Measurement of epidermal cell sizes in mature leaves was performed as described (CITATION). The segregation ratios in the reciprocal analysis were determined by PCR using the following primers: G1/G2 for PAT10, G3/G2 for pat10-1, G1/G4 for PAT10, and G5/G4 for pat10-2. Total RNAs were isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs were synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase with on-column DNase digestion (Invitrogen). Primers used in RT-PCR to characterize pat10 were R1/R2/R3/R4. Primers used in RT-PCR to verify complementation were R5/R6 for the endogenous PAT10 and R5/R7 for the exogenous PAT10. Primers to amplify ACTIN2 were as described (CITATION). The qRT-PCR analysis of salt-induced gene expression was performed with the Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system using SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (Toyobo). Each 20-μL reaction system contained 2 μL SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix, 2 μL cDNA, and 2 μL primers (5 µM). GAPDH and TUBLIN2 were used as internal controls (CITATION). Primers used for RD29A, RD20, ERD20, RAB18, GAPDH, and TUBLIN2 were as described (CITATION; CITATION). The cycling conditions were as followed: 95°C for 2 min and 42 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 15 s. Fluorescence data were collected during the 72°C step and analyzed with the Bio-Rad CFX Manager. RNA extractions were performed for three biological replicates for each treatment, and three technical replicates were performed for each sample. The data presented in Figure 8 are means of the three biological replicates for which three technical replicates were averaged. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. All constructs were generated using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). The whole genomic fragment of PAT10 was cloned with primers PAT10gF/PAT10gR from genomic DNA. The C192S mutation was generated with primers PAT10gmF/PAT10gmR from the PAT10g entry vector using a Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Finnzyme). The 1242-bp sequence upstream of the start codon of PAT10 was used as its promoter (ProPAT10). ProPAT10 was cloned with primers ProF/ProR from genomic DNA. The entry vectors for CBL2, CBL3, CBL6, CBL9, and ERD2 were generated from a mixed Arabidopsis cDNA library using the following primer pairs: CBL2-F/R for CBL2, CBL3-F/R for CBL3, CBL6-F/R for CBL6, CBL9-F/R for CBL9, and ERD2-F/R for ERD2. All entry clones were generated in the pENTR/D/TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The destination vector used to generate ProPAT10:GUS were described previously (CITATION). The destination vector for PAT10-GFP and PAT10C192S-GFP was modified from a previously described vector (CITATION) by removing the ProLAT52 sequence. The expression vector for ARA6 and ARA7 was described (CITATION). Expression vectors were generated by LR reactions using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen). Expression vectors for mbSUS were generated by in vivo homologous recombination in yeast as described (CITATION). All PCR amplifications used Phusion hot start high-fidelity DNA polymerase with the annealing temperature and extension times recommended by the manufacturer (Finnzyme). All entry vectors were sequenced, and sequences were analyzed using Vector NTI (Invitrogen). The Bioneer PCR purification kit and Bioneer Spin miniprep kit were used for PCR product recovery and plasmid DNA extraction, respectively. Roots of ProPAT10:GUS transgenic plants were fixed, cleared, and embedded in paraffin (Sigma-Aldrich). Fifteen embedded root tissues from three individual transgenic lines were analyzed. To show the outlines of cells, sectioned samples on slides were stained with 100 mg/L ruthenium red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 to 5 min before being visualized and photographed with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera. RNA in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (CITATION). Briefly, open flowers and young pistils were fixed in formaldehyde solution (formalin:acetic acid:ethanol:H2O=1:2:10:7) overnight at 4°C, embedded in Paraplast (Sigma-Aldrich) after dehydration, and sectioned at 6-µm thickness. A 216-bp fragment specific for PAT10 was amplified from the coding region of PAT10 with primers ProbeF/ProbeR. The sense probe and the antisense probe were cloned into pMD19 T-simple vector (Takara), modified in vitro with digoxigenin-UTP by SP6 or T7 RNA polymerases (Roche), respectively. Sections were hybridized with 1.5 ng/μL probes at 42°C overnight in a hybridization solution that contained 50% formamide. Hybridization signals were detected using antidigoxigenin antibody (Anti-Digoxigenin-Ap Fab fragments; Roche). The samples were observed using an Olympus BX51 microscope. To detect pollen viability, mature anthers were soaked overnight in Alexander stain (CITATION) and observed with a BX51 microscope (Olympus). Pollen from open flowers was stained with 1 mg/mL (w/v) 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and observed with an Axio Observer D1 microscope (Zeiss). Pollen germination in vitro and aniline blue staining of pollen tubes growing in vivo were performed as described (CITATION). For pollen SEM, mature pollen coated with gold palladium was observed under a JSM-6610LV scanning electron microscope (JEOL). For pollen TEM, mature flowers were fixed in 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 1% (w/v) osmic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with a phosphate buffer, the specimens were dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Epon 812 resin (SPI-CHEM). Ultrathin sections were stained with acetate uranium and lead citrate. The specimens were observed using a JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL). For double labeling experiments with FM4-64, roots of 4- to 5-DAG seedlings were dipped in liquid MS media supplemented with 4 µM FM4-64 for 5 min (except for the 1-min assay). The roots were then taken out, washed three times with liquid MS medium without FM4-64, and visualized for FM4-64 intake at the designated times. For BFA treatment, roots were treated first with FM4-64 for 5 min, then washed and incubated with MS medium supplemented with 50 µM BFA for 50 min and visualized for the formation of BFA compartments. For treatment of protoplasts with 2-BP, 2-BP at the final concentration of 10 µM was added into cultural medium immediately after polyethylene glycol–mediated transformation. Samples were examined between 16 and 24 h after treatment. For salt treatment, wild-type and pat10 seedlings at 4 DAG on MS media were transferred to fresh MS media or to MS media supplemented with either 10 mM LiCl or 130 mM NaCl for additional 14 d. Plates were photographed with a BX51 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a digital camera. Rosette diameter was measured using ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). For each treatment, a representative image from three independent experiments was shown. For the measurement of rosette diameter and fresh weight, each treatment was repeated three times, and each experiment included at least 30 plants from each genetic background. For salt induction of gene expression, wild-type and pat10 seedlings growing vertically on MS medium for 7 d were transferred to 3M filter paper presoaked with either MS medium or MS medium supplemented with 300 mM NaCl. After 6 h of incubation, whole seedlings were used for RNA extraction. Preparation of Arabidopsis protoplasts was performed according to a previous report (CITATION). Transformation of Arabidopsis protoplasts was performed according to standard protocols (CITATION). Three independent experiments for each treatment or combination were conducted to ensure that the results were consistent. In vitro growing pollen from PAT10-GFP or PAT10C192S-GFP transgenic plants was captured by epifluorescence using Axio Observer D1 equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss). Other images were captured by an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM780; Zeiss) with a Plan-Neofluar ×40/1.3 oil differential interference contrast objective or ×63/1.45 oil differential interference contrast objective. GFP-RFP double-labeled materials were captured alternately using line switching with the multitrack function (488 nm for GFP and 545 nm for RFP). Fluorescence was detected using a 505- to 550-nm band-pass filter for GFP and a 575- to 650-nm band-pass filter for RFP. Postacquisition image processing was performed with LSM image processing software (Zeiss). Pearson coefficients analysis was performed as described (CITATION). Optical sectioning of ovules was performed as described (CITATION). Briefly, pistils were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde (in 12.5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.9) for at least 20 min with vacuum and overnight at room temperature. After fixation, the tissues were dehydrated through a conventional ethanol series and cleared in 2:1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate:benzyl alcohol for at least 1 h. The pistils were then dissected, mounted with immersion oil, and observed with a Leica TCS SP5II laser scanning microscope (Leica) with a 488-nm argon laser and an LP 500 filter.
