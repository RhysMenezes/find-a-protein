!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis thaliana Qa-SNARE SYP121 (=SYR1/PEN1) drives vesicle traffic at the plasma membrane of cells throughout the vegetative plant. It facilitates responses to drought, to the water stress hormone abscisic acid, and to pathogen attack, and it is essential for recovery from so-called programmed stomatal closure. How SYP121-mediated traffic is regulated is largely unknown, although it is thought to depend on formation of a fusion-competent SNARE core complex with the cognate partners VAMP721 and SNAP33. Like SYP121, the Arabidopsis Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11 (=KEULE) is expressed throughout the vegetative plant. We find that SEC11 binds directly with SYP121 both in vitro and in vivo to affect secretory traffic. Binding occurs through two distinct modes, one requiring only SEC11 and SYP121 and the second dependent on assembly of a complex with VAMP721 and SNAP33. SEC11 competes dynamically for SYP121 binding with SNAP33 and VAMP721, and this competition is predicated by SEC11 association with the N terminus of SYP121. These and additional data are consistent with a model in which SYP121-mediated vesicle fusion is regulated by an unusual “handshaking” mechanism of concerted SEC11 debinding and rebinding. They also implicate one or more factors that alter or disrupt SEC11 association with the SYP121 N terminus as an early step initiating SNARE complex formation.
!~RES~! We optimized in vitro pull-down assays using Arabidopsis proteins expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). For this purpose, the coding sequence for SYP121 was truncated to remove the hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain (SYP121ΔC), yielding the coding sequence for the SYP121-Sp2 fragment previously shown to be active in vivo (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). A construct was generated to give SYP121ΔC fused at its C terminus with two Protein-A tags (2PA) as a soluble protein incorporating the N-terminal residues, Habc and H3 (Qa-SNARE motif) α-helices essential for SYP121 function (Figure 1A). The 2PA tag enabled affinity purification of SYP121ΔC expressed in E. coli (see Supplemental Figure 1 online) and immobilization of the purified protein on IgG Sepharose resin. Its placement at the C terminus of the Qa-SNARE fragment also ensured that the tag was removed from the N-terminal end of the protein where it might affect SEC11 interactions (CITATION). As controls, we cloned, expressed, and purified 2PA on its own, and the endomembrane Qa-SNARE SYP21 (=PEP12) similarly truncated to give SYP21ΔC (=SYP21-Sp2) (CITATION). As a binding partner, we cloned SEC11 tagged on its N terminus with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or 6xHis (=His; Figure 1A; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). For pull-down assays, the baits SYP121ΔC-2PA and 2PA were immobilized on IgG Sepharose and incubated with a fivefold excess of His-SEC11. Thereafter, unbound His-SEC11 was removed by washing and proteins bound to the resin were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot. [[FIGURE]] We found that SYP121ΔC-2PA, but not 2PA alone, bound His-SEC11 (Figure 1B) as confirmed with the immunoblot analysis (Figure 1C). Similar results were obtained when the SYP121–SEC11 interaction was tested using the N-terminally tagged GST-SEC11 as the bait for SYP121ΔC-2PA, whereas no significant interaction was observed with the endomembrane Qa-SNARE fusion SYP21ΔC-2PA nor when resin alone was used for pull-down controls (Figure 1D). Figure 1E summarizes the pull-down data from five independent experiments. Experiments with GST-tagged iLOV protein (GST-iLOV) as bait also showed no significant binding above GST alone (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). iLOV is an unrelated, phototropin protein that is soluble and expressed constitutively in Arabidopsis (CITATION). We quantified the corresponding SDS-PAGE bands after Coomassie staining, using ImageJ to derive density ratios for SYP121ΔC-2PA bound as a function of bait input, and the relative SYP121ΔC-2PA binding between baits. The analysis shows that GST alone and GST-iLOV bound similar amounts of SYP121ΔC-2PA, whereas SYP121ΔC-2PA bound to GST-SEC11 was roughly fourfold higher. SYP21ΔC-2PA bound with GST-SEC11 was similar to the background with GST alone. To assess SYP121 binding with SEC11 in vivo, we cloned the same coding sequences into the 2in1 vector system (CITATION) for transient transformation, expression, and ratiometric bimolecular fluorescence complementation (rBiFC). We made use of the SYP121ΔC backbone tagged at its C terminus because the C terminus of the full-length Qa-SNARE is not cytosolic and an N-terminal tag might interfere with SEC11 binding. The 2in1 system incorporates a set of independent Gateway-compatible cassettes with 35S promoters (Figure 1F, schematic). The two cassettes include the coding sequences for the two halves of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), nYFP and cYFP, to generate fusion constructs for coexpression and testing of fluorescence complementation in the plant. The vector also includes a third cassette incorporating the coding sequence for soluble red fluorescent protein (RFP) that can be used, on a cell-by-cell basis, as an expression control and for ratiometric quantification of BiFC. We performed transient transformations of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves in four independent experiments, each with 2in1 vectors carrying constructs for SEC11 expression alone, with iLOV, with SYP121ΔC, and with SYP21ΔC. Fluorescence was measured by confocal microscopy in each case, and rBiFC data were determined by analysis of images of the epidermal cell layer taken from regions selected at random across the leaf surface. Representative images are shown in Figure 1F along with protein blot analysis for construct expression from the tissue as a whole, and the statistical analysis from all four experiments is summarized in Figure 1G. Much as in the in vitro binding assays, we observed a highly significant rBiFC signal when SEC11 was coexpressed with SYP121ΔC compared with that obtained with SEC11 expression alone, whereas coexpression with iLOV and with SYP21ΔC yielded rBiFC signals that were statistically indistinguishable from this background. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, the results indicated a selective affinity for binding between the Arabidopsis SYP121 and SEC11 proteins. The N-terminal peptides of a number of Qa-SNAREs from mammals, yeast, and Drosophila melanogaster harbor a set of highly conserved residues, notably Phe (or Leu) at position 8 or 9, that are known to contribute to SM protein binding (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Alignment of these Qa-SNAREs with SYP121, with its closest homologs SYP122 and SYP111 from Arabidopsis and with SYP121 from tobacco (Figure 2A), showed a similar conservation of the Phe residue at position 9 in the plant Qa-SNAREs. To test its role in binding SEC11 in vivo, and thus with a full complement of associated regulatory factors, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis in the syp121-1 mutant background (CITATION), complementing the mutation with the wild-type Qa-SNARE and with SYP121 mutated to carry the site substitutions F9A (SYP121F9A); as a control, we included a second, adjacent site complementation with S10A (SYP121S10A) (CITATION). Expression of the Qa-SNARE in each of the complemented lines was verified by immunoblot. We performed pull-down assays using solubilized membrane fractions from leaves of each line with resin-bound GST-SEC11 as the bait. As a control, GST was added with membrane fractions from SYP121-complemented syp121-1 mutant plants. After washing, bait and bound proteins were eluted, separated as before, and visualized by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-SYP121 antibody (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Figure 2B (top) shows the immunoblot for the syp121-1 mutant background and for the Qa-SNARE inputs used in the pull-down assays; the Ponceau-stained bands for ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (bottom) are provided as a loading control. Figure 2C (top, left to right) shows the SYP121 pull downs from fractions of SYP121-complemented plants using GST (Ctrl) and GST-SEC11 (SYP121) as baits and with GST-SEC11 from SYP121F9A and SYP121S10A complemented syp121-1 mutant plants; the corresponding Ponceau-stained bands for the GST and GST-SEC11 baits are included for reference (bottom). These results demonstrated the lack of binding with GST alone with fractions from the SYP121-complemented syp121-1 mutant. They also indicated SYP121 binding with SEC11 in the other samples, albeit visibly reduced in fractions from the SYP121F9A-complemented plants. In each case, SYP121 could be resolved as a double band in the eluted fraction, consistent with previous observations (CITATION; CITATION). Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ and relative binding determined from the ratios of Qa-SNARE bound against GST-SEC11 input. Figure 2D summarizes the results from four independent experiments with binding normalized between experiments to binding for the SYP121-complemented plants. The analysis confirms that SYP121 binding to SEC11 was significantly reduced by the F9A mutation, but not by the S10A mutation. We examined the SEC11 interaction with SYP121 in vivo, again taking advantage of the 2in1 system for rBiFC (CITATION). rBiFC fusion constructs (Figure 2E, schematic) were generated to express nYFP-SEC11 together with cYFP fusions of wild-type SYP121ΔC, SYP121ΔC,F9A, and SYP121ΔC,S10A and with RFP as the expression marker. Figure 2E shows confocal fluorescence images collected for each of the Qa-SNARE constructs and for the SEC11 control after transient transformation of tobacco leaves along with protein blot analysis verifying expression in the whole tissue. Analysis of the fluorescence intensity ratios for four independent experiments is summarized in Figure 2F. These results support the pull downs from Arabidopsis microsomal fractions; they show that SEC11 interacts selectively with SYP121 in vivo and that its binding is sensitive to the Phe residue at position 9 of the Qa-SNARE. Many Qa-SNAREs have been shown to adopt two alternative conformations: (1) a closed conformation in which the three N-terminal α-helices of the Habc domain fold back onto the H3 (Qa motif) α-helix and form a tetrahelical bundle, and (2) an open conformation in which the H3 α-helix is free of the N-terminal α-helices and available for binding with the cognate SNAREs (CITATION; CITATION). The open conformation can be stabilized experimentally by introducing point mutations in the linker between the Habc and H3 α-helices, which disrupt binding of the mammalian SM protein Munc18-1 to the closed Syn1A (CITATION). By contrast, homologous substitutions in the Arabidopsis SYP111, which lead to a significant increase in trypsin proteolysis consistent with a more open structure, increase in its binding to SEC11 (CITATION). We found that introducing the corresponding substitutions to yield SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A also increased the binding in pull downs with GST-SEC11 (Figures 3A and 3B). However, unlike the N-terminal deletion of SYP111 (CITATION), significant binding was retained with the complementary SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A,F9A mutant. These data indicate that SEC11 binding is enhanced with SYP121 in its open conformation, as it is for SYP111. Our observations also suggest that the F9 residue helps to stabilize SEC11 with the Qa-SNARE, consistent with the in vivo data (Figure 2), although it is not indispensable for binding in either the closed or open conformation of SYP121. [[FIGURE]] SM proteins resolved to date have been found to form a clothespeg-like structure with a central cavity that is thought to clasp the closed conformation of the cognate Qa-SNARE. In the mammalian SM protein Munc18-1, amino acids central to the protein between residues 295 and 358 form a flexible hairpin bend that is required for Qa-SNARE binding; the P335A mutation reduces the flexibility of this hairpin and disrupts binding associated with both the N terminus and closed conformations of the Qa-SNARE Syn1A (CITATION; CITATION). On its own, the N terminus of the Qa-SNARE connects with a hydrophobic cleft on the outer surface of the SM protein, within its N-terminal leg, to facilitate membrane fusion (CITATION). Consistent with this finding, the L117R and L137R mutations of the yeast SM proteins Vps45p and Sly1p prevent their association with the N terminus of the cognate Qa-SNAREs Tlg2p and Sed5p (CITATION; CITATION). We identified three potentially homologous sites (Figure 3C) and generated mutations in each of these to yield the single-site mutants L103R, L112R, and L128R in addition to the hairpin mutation P368A in GST-SEC11. Pull-down assays with SYP121ΔC (Figures 3D and 3E) showed that binding was reduced in every case and was most strongly affected by the SEC11L128R and SEC11P368A mutations. Together with the results of Figure 2, these data are broadly consistent with two modes of binding between SEC11 and SYP121, one depending on the interaction of the SYP121 N terminus with the outer surface of SEC11 and the second engaging a homologous, clothespeg-like cleft formed by the SM protein. Although originally associated with the closed conformation of canonical Qa-SNAREs from yeast and mammals (CITATION; CITATION), the binding of SM proteins is recognized now also to facilitate vesicle fusion by stabilizing the complex of cognate SNAREs (CITATION; CITATION). SYP121 is known to assemble a SNARE core complex with the Qbc-SNARE SNAP33 and R-SNARE VAMP721 (CITATION), thus raising the question whether SEC11 binding affects (and is affected by) SYP121 interaction with these protein partners. We expressed and purified SNAP33 and the cytosolic domain of VAMP721 tagged with GST as before (see Supplemental Figures 1D and 1E online) for pull-down assays with SYP121ΔC-2PA as bait. Equimolar quantities of VAMP721 and SNAP33 were incubated at a fivefold excess with the Qa-SNARE on their own, together, and with GST-SEC11. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. We found that GST-SNAP33 and GST-VAMP721 bound similarly when added either alone or together with the complementary Qa-SNARE partner (Figures 4A to 4C). The observations indicated the ability of the proteins to assemble in heteromeric complexes with all three cognate SNAREs and suggested a dynamic between the closed and open conformations of the Qa-SNARE sufficient to allow this assembly (contrast with mammalian Syn1A; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] In subsequent experiments, we incubated GST-SEC11 with SYP121ΔC in sequence, adding the SM protein before, after, or at the same time as GST-SNAP33 and GST-VAMP. Bound proteins were analyzed as before and ratios normalized between experiments to the values obtained when SEC11, SNAP33, and VAMP721 were introduced concurrently in the pull-down assay. Immunoblots from one experiment are shown in Figure 4D, and the results of five independent experiments are summarized for SEC11 and SNAP33 in Figures 4E and 4F. SEC11 bound with SYP121ΔC was significantly greater when present on its own and was further enhanced when incubated first with SYP121ΔC before adding the cognate SNAREs VAMP721 and SNAP33; no difference in SEC11 binding was evident when added together with or after VAMP721 and SNAP33 (Figure 4E). SNAP33 binding with SYP121ΔC was also significantly greater in the absence of SEC11 (Figure 4F). When compared with the results of the concurrent additions, SNAP33 binding was unaffected when SEC11 was incubated first with SYP121ΔC, but its binding was enhanced if SEC11 was added after SYP121ΔC was incubated with SNAP33 and VAMP721 (Figure 4F). A simple interpretation of these data is that SEC11 and SNAP33 compete for the unbound SYP121, but assembly of the SNARE core complex facilitates SEC11 binding, which, once bound, also helps stabilize the association of SYP121 with SNAP33. As a test of this hypothesis, we repeated these experiments using the SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A mutant as bait, with the expectation that locking the Qa-SNARE in the open conformation would eliminate the competition for binding between SEC11 and the cognate SNARE partners. The results, summarized in Figures 4G to 4I, confirmed that SEC11 binding to SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A was unaffected by additions of the cognate SNAREs and independent of the order of additions (Figure 4H). Furthermore, adding SEC11 led to a significant increase in SNAP33 binding with SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A, again independent of the order of additions (Figure 4I). These results, and those of Figures 2 and 3, are most easily understood in context of the two conformations of SYP121, both available for SEC11 binding: When presented with the open conformation of the SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A mutant and with the cognate SNAREs, SEC11 is able to bind and stabilize the core complex; when bound in the closed conformation, SEC11 sequesters SYP121, effectively competing out the Qa-SNARE for binding, even with its cognate SNARE partners. Binding of SM proteins with the N terminus of the cognate Qa-SNAREs is thought variously to stabilize their interactions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and to tether and potentiate SNARE complex assembly in the presence of the cognate SNAREs (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, we were interested that SEC11 appeared to compete for SYP121 binding with its cognate SNAREs and that this competition was eliminated when presented with the open conformer SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A. To explore the role of this association further, we made use of the SEC11L128R mutant that largely eliminated binding with SYP121ΔC alone (Figures 3D and 3E). We reasoned that if interaction with the SYP121 N terminus was important for SEC11 competition with the cognate SNAREs, then the mutation should eliminate this competition by preventing SEC11 association with the SYP121 N terminus. Pull-down assays were performed as before, but with the substitution of the SEC11L128R mutant. We found SEC11L128R binding to be strongly enhanced when SNAP33 and VAMP721 were present, but independent of the order of incubation with SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A (Figure 5A). SNAP33 binding was enhanced by SEC11L128R, again independent of the order of additions (Figure 5B), consistent with the loss of SM protein binding to the closed Qa-SNARE (compared with Figures 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained when the open conformation mutant SYP121ΔC,F9A,L185A,D186A was used as bait (Figures 5C and 5D), which also suggests that binding with the N terminus of the Qa-SNARE is not essential for priming SNARE core complex assembly with SYP121. [[FIGURE]] Finally, to assess SYP121ΔC and SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A binding with SEC11 and SEC11L128R in vivo, we cloned the same coding sequences into the 2in1 vector system (CITATION) for transient, 35S-driven expression in tobacco and rBiFC analysis. Confocal images were collected at random across the leaf surface in each of five independent experiments. These data along with protein blot analysis for whole-tissue expression (Figure 6A) and statistical analysis of data from all experiments (Figure 6B) showed that the interaction of SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A with SEC11 was only marginally reduced compared with that of SYP121ΔC but was virtually lost when SEC11L128R was substituted for SEC11. We also noted a smaller, but significant, recovery of the rBiFC signal when SEC11L128R was coexpressed with the open Qa-SNARE SYP121ΔC,L185A,D186A. This recovery may reflect the ability of the tobacco SNAP33 and VAMP721 homologs to assemble with SYP121 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), thereby promoting SEC11 binding with the core complex (Figure 5). Thus, we conclude that SEC11 interaction with the SYP121 N terminus is important for their association in vivo and for SEC11 competition with SNAP33 and VAMP721 in SYP121 binding in vitro. [[FIGURE]] Previous studies (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have highlighted the efficacy of SYP121ΔC, the so-called Sp2 fragment of SYP121, to selectively block secretory traffic to the plasma membrane. Traffic block is thought to occur because the soluble SYP121ΔC retains its ability to assemble in complex with its cognate SNAREs but, lacking a membrane anchor, is unable to facilitate fusion. In short, SYP121ΔC acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor by competing with the native Qa-SNAREs for binding partners. Therefore, we reasoned that SEC11 might rescue traffic in vivo in the presence of SYP121ΔC, provided that SEC11 binding could stabilize the Qa-SNARE fragment in its closed conformation. To test this hypothesis, we recloned the coding sequences for SYP121ΔC, SEC11, SEC11L128R, and, as a control, the coding sequence for SYP21ΔC in the tetracistronic vector pTEcG-2in1-CC (see Methods). Analogous to the 2in1 system, this vector incorporates four 35S-driven expression cassettes, two containing the coding sequences for expression of the endoplasmic reticulum marker green fluorescent protein (GFP)-HDEL (CITATION; CITATION) and of secreted YFP (secYFP) (CITATION; CITATION), respectively, and two available for recombination with Gateway-compatible donor constructs. Transformation with this vector thus ensured equal transgene dosage on a cell-by-cell basis and included a marker for Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated gene transfer. As with rBiFC (Figures 1 and 6), we used ratiometric analysis of concurrent secYFP and GFP-HDEL fluorescence images to quantify secretory traffic and its block. Figure 7 summarizes the results of four independent experiments with confocal images collected at random across the leaf surface for each construct. We found, as before (CITATION), that expressing SYP121ΔC, but not SYP21ΔC, led to a significant block of traffic and retention of the secYFP signal relative to the cellular marker GFP-HDEL. Expressing SEC11 on its own did not lead to secYFP retention, nor did SEC11L128R. However, when coexpressed with SYP121ΔC, SEC11 rescued secYFP traffic, as evidenced by its lack of retention relative to the GFP-HDEL marker. By contrast, coexpressing SEC11L128R with SYP121ΔC failed to prevent secYFP retention and, hence, to rescue its traffic. These results indicated that SEC11 is able to affect secretory traffic in vivo. We suspect that traffic rescue depends on SEC11 interaction with the dominant-negative Qa-SNARE because the SEC11L128R mutant was unable to rescue traffic, while expression of the native SEC11 alone had no effect. We return to these observations below. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Escherichia coli expression clones with appropriate tags were prepared using classical and Gateway cloning. Vector pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) was modified using the Gateway conversion kit (Life Technologies) to include Gateway cloning sites used for expressing N-terminal GST-tagged SNAP33, VAMP721, the SEC11 wild type, and mutants. SYP121ΔC wild type and mutants were PCR amplified adding 5′ NdeI and 3′ SalI sites; these genes were introduced into the pETDuet vector (CITATION) via NdeI-XhoI. Supplemental Table 1 online lists all the constructs used in this study and their general cloning strategy. Mutations in SYP121 and SEC11 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Primers were designed as described previously introducing silent mutations to distinguish mutants on the DNA level (CITATION; CITATION). Protein–protein interaction analysis was performed after cloning in the tricistronic vector pBiFCt-2in1-NC for rBiFC as described previously (CITATION). All recombination reactions were achieved with entry clones containing the relevant coding sequences for SEC11, iLOV, SYP121ΔC, and mutants. For rBiFC analysis, SEC11 was tagged N-terminally with nYFP and the SNARE variants C-terminally with cYFP. For quantitative secretion analysis, an analogous, tetracistronic vector was constructed with Gateway-compatible sites. An expression cassette containing 35S promoter, Omega Enhancer, and secYFP was derived from the pVKH-N-secYFP template (CITATION), flanked by AfeI and SmaI on the 5′-end and MfeI on the 3′-end, and was generated by PCR and ligated into pBiFC-BB (CITATION) via AfeI and MfeI to replace the RFP expression cassette in pBiFC-BB. The expression cassette containing 35S, Omega Enhancer, and GFP-HDEL was PCR amplified from pVKH-GFP-HDEL (CITATION) and ligated into pBiFC-BB-secYFP via the SmaI site, resulting in the vector pTecG. The two 2in1 expression cassettes containing 35S promoter, Omega Enhancer, Gateway cassette (either attR3-lacZ-attR2 or attR1-ChloramphenicolR, ccdB-attR4), and a C-terminal tag (either 3xHA or myc) were gene synthesized and sequentially ligated via blunt end cloning (AfeI and SnaBI) into pTecG to create pTecG-2in1-CC. Secretion analysis was performed with SEC11 untagged as a result of inserting of a stop, and SYP121ΔC and its mutants were C-terminally myc tagged. Arabidopsis thaliana syp121-1 mutant plants were complemented with each of the SYP121 mutants, SYP121F9A and SYP121S10A (CITATION), driven by the mild, constitutive pUB10 promoter (CITATION). Six-week-old plants were transformed by floral dipping using the method of CITATION. Seed of the wild-type (Columbia-0) parent line, the syp121-1 mutant, and the T3 generation complemented lines were grown on soil under a 10:14 h light:dark cycle with 150 μmol m−2 s−1 PAR at 18:23°C. Plants were harvested 14 d after germination, washed, flash-frozen, and ground in liquid N2. Equal weights of ground tissue were suspended by sonication in equal volumes of homogenization buffer containing 500 mM Suc, 10% glycerol, 20 mM EDTA, 20 mM EGTA, Roche protease inhibitor, 10 mM ascorbic acid, 5 mM DTT, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, before centrifuging at 13,000g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The resulting extracts were diluted 1:1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl for pull-down experiments. Vector plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 cells (Life Technologies). Expression of the tagged proteins was induced using 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were harvested after 4 h, lysed, and the supernatant loaded on affinity resin columns for purification according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Proteins tagged with GST and 2PA were purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B and IgG Sepharose resins, respectively (GE Healthcare). Following elution, the proteins were dialyzed with two changes of buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and were verified by immunoblot analysis (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Bait proteins were immobilized at a rate of 1 μg/10 μL of affinity resin. Controls included GST or 2PA, and, unless noted, their bound values were subtracted as background in the data reported. Equimolar quantities of the prey proteins were added to the pull-down suspensions in the presence of 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and were incubated with gentle mixing for 4 h at 4°C. For complex assays with sequential additions, 4-h incubations were used for each step. Thereafter, each resin was washed with 10× volumes of buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Tween 20, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4°C, and proteins were eluted by boiling at 95°C for 10 min in Laemmli buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (CITATION). Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide and proteins analyzed by Coomassie staining and immunoblot with anti-GST antibodies (GE Healthcare). For pull-down assays with Arabidopsis fractions, wild-type and mutant SYP121 were detected using polyclonal anti-SYP121 antibodies (CITATION) using ECL Advance (GE Healthcare), and the Ponceau-stained ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase bands were used as loading standards. All blots and stained gels were scanned at 1200-dpi resolution, and band intensities were quantified using ImageJ v. 4.3j (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) to obtain bound:bait ratios for comparisons within any one experiment and were normalized to standard controls between experiments using the same combinations of proteins. Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM510-META confocal microscope with ×20/0.75–numerical aperture and ×40/1.3–numerical aperture objectives. Excitation intensities, filter settings, and photomultiplier gains were standardized (CITATION; CITATION). For rBiFC analysis, YFP and RFP were excited by the 514-nm line of an argon laser and the 543-nm line of a HeNe laser, respectively. YFP fluorescence was collected after passage through a 515-nm dichroic mirror and 535- to 590-nm band-pass filter. RFP fluorescence was collected after passage through a 560-nm dichroic mirror and 560- to 615-nm band-pass filter. For trafficking studies, GFP and YFP were excited by the 458- and 514-nm lines, respectively, of an argon laser, and fluorescence was collected after separation by a 545-nm dichroic mirror. GFP and YFP fluorescence signals were collected after passage through 475- to 525-nm and 535- to 590-nm band-pass filters, respectively. Interference from chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored after passage through a 635-nm dichroic mirror using the META collector set to collect across 638 to 700 nm. All data are reported as means ± se of n independent measurements. Significance was determined using analysis of variance with significance thresholds as indicated.
