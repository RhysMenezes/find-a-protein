!~ABS~! Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are Zn‐containing metalloenzymes that catalyse the reversible hydration of CO2. We investigated the αCA and βCA families in Arabidopsis, which contain eight αCA (AtαCA1‐8) and six βCA genes (AtβCA1‐6). Analyses of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database indicate that all the βCA encoding sequences, but only three of the AtαCA, are expressed. Using semi‐quantitative PCR experiments, functional CA genes were more strongly expressed in green tissue, but strong expression was also found in roots for βCA3, βCA6 and αCA2. Two αCA genes were shown to respond to the CO2 environment, while the others were unresponsive. Using the green fluorescent reporter protein gene fused with cDNA sequences coding for βCAs, we provided evidence that βCAs were targeted to specific subcellular compartments: βCA1 and βCA5 were targeted to the chloroplast, βCA2 and βCA3 to the cytosol, βCA4 to the plasma membrane and βCA6 to the mitochondria. The targeting and the pattern of gene expression suggest that CA isoforms play specific roles in subcellular compartments, tissues and organs. The data indicate that other CA isoforms than the well‐characterized βCA1 may contribute to the CO2 transfer in the cell to the catalytic site of ribulose 1·5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). 
!~RES~! To identify the Arabidopsis αCA and βCA gene families, an extensive search of the Arabidopsis genomic sequences was performed using BLAST and FASTA algorithms and using diverse αCA and βCA sequences as initial query sequences. Eight αCA and six βCA encoding sequences were retrieved. Table 1 shows the list of the CA genes indicating their identification numbers (AGI number) and where applicable, previous gene designation. To determine the proteins encoded by the AtαCA and the AtβCA genes, the gene structure and the exon–intron organization had first to be confirmed. Where possible, reverse transcriptase PCR products were sequenced and compared to cDNA sequences retrieved from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), the MIPS and the Riken web sites (http://www.arabidopsis.org/, http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html and http://www.gsc.riken.go.jp/indexE.htm as of January 2006). With this combined approach, we identified the AtαCA1‐3 and AtβCA1‐6 genes unambiguously. We were not able to amplify any transcript of AtαCA4‐8; therefore, AtαCA4‐8 exon–intron splice sites were predicted using GeneScan (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) and based on the most favourable similarity to the characteristic protein structure. αCA and βCA amino acid sequences were deduced from the cDNA sequences. Figures 1 and 2 show multiple sequence alignments of Arabidopsis αCA and βCA gene products, respectively. The sequence of the extensively characterized human isoenzyme II αCA and pea βCA (Swiss Prot accession numbers P00918 and P17067, respectively) were aligned in parallel for comparison to the Arabidopsis αCA and βCA sequences, respectively. The sequence alignments show that the CA sequences contain the key features of AtαCAs and AtβCAs. The αCA sequence alignment reveals that all of the AtαCA protein sequences contain the three Zn‐liganded histidine residues and most of the residues predicted to form the hydrogen‐bond network to Zn‐bound solvent molecules in mammalian αCA isoenzymes (Fig. 2). The amino acid residues that have been shown either to constitute Zn ligands (one histidine and two cysteine residues) or to orientate towards Zn (Kimber & Pai 2000; Mitsuhashi et al. 2000) appeared highly conserved in the AtβCA sequences. These findings suggest that the products of all the Arabidopsis αCA and βCA genes are functional enzymes. Considerable sequence identity exists between the different protein members of the AtαCA and AtβCA family sequences. However, several CA sequences contain distinct N‐terminal extensions that can correspond to target peptides suggesting that the different isoforms are addressed to specific cell compartments.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] A search of the TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/ as of January 2006) indicated that ESTs (Table 1) have been deposited for three of the eight αCA and all of the six βCA encoding genes signifying that the βCA genes are functional. The lack of ESTs for AtαCA4, AtαCA5, AtαCA6, AtαCA7 and AtαCA8, although a cDNA sequence was released for AtαCA4 (GeneBank reference AY122907), might indicate that these genes were pseudogenes or that they were expressed at very low levels and/or that the conditions used in generating ESTs data were limiting and did not include the conditions under which these genes were expressed or that the corresponding gene transcripts were not stable. To determine the organ‐specificity expression pattern of each member of the AtαCA and AtβCA gene family, RT‐PCR analysis was performed on RNA isolated from leaves, stems, flowers, siliques and roots of 8‐week‐old plants. Figure 3 shows agarose gel analyses of RT‐PCR products. Transcript for actin was used as internal control. To avoid detecting DNA contamination, primers spanning an intron were designed. The correct identities of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. For AtβCA6, three different products were obtained following amplification with gene‐specific primers (Fig. 3); however, identity of the major band as AtβCA6 product was confirmed. No PCR product was obtained following amplification with AtαCA4‐8 specific primers as expected according to the lack of ESTs in the databases (data not shown). The AtβCA1, AtβCA2, AtβCA4 and AtβCA5 genes were mainly strongly expressed in the aboveground tissues with almost no expression in roots. Transcripts of AtβCA3 and AtβCA6 were detected in all parts of the plant but at a lower level in roots. As expected from the ESTs data, only the expression of AtαCA1, AtαCA2 and AtαCA3 was detected in Arabidopsis plants. The transcript of AtαCA1 was detected in all organs except roots, while AtαCA2 is expressed only in stems and roots, and AtαCA3 expression is restricted to flowers and siliques.  [[FIGURE]] We tested if changes in environmental CO2 concentration altered AtαCA and AtβCA gene expression. Plants were grown either at low (150 ppm) or high (1000 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Gene expression levels were quantified by RT‐PCR in leaves and compared to plants grown under air CO2 concentration (360 ppm). The transcript for actin was used as internal control. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of most AtβCA genes was insensitive to both CO2 conditions. Only the expression of AtαCA6 appeared slightly but significantly enhanced when plants were grown under high CO2 conditions. Contrary to AtαCA1 whose transcript level remained unaffected by CO2 regime, AtαCA2 and AtαCA3 expression was stimulated when the plants were grown in low CO2 concentration.  [[FIGURE]] To uncover the possible potential subcellular localization of the products of AtCA genes expressed in leaves, we searched for different signatures specific to cellular compartments using TargetP, Predotar and Psort softwares (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/, http://urgi.infobiogen.fr/predotar/french.html and http://www.psort.org/, respectively) for AtβCAs (Table 2). The results predicted AtβCA1 and AtβCA5 to have chloroplastic target peptides. AtβCA6 was predicted to be targeted to mitochondria. Prediction indicated no preferred localization subcompartment for AtβCA2, AtβCA3 and AtβCA4. In order to determine the subcellular localization of the CA encoded by the six AtβCA genes, we used GFP as a reporter. Individual cDNA encoding the full protein sequence were cloned in frame with the GFP. The resulting transgenes were expressed under the control of the 35S promoter in stably transformed Arabidopsis plants. Expression of the fusion proteins was analysed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fig. 5). In mesophyll cells of transgenic plants, the GFP signal fused to AtβCA1 or AtβCA5 co‐localized with chlorophyll autofluorescence, indicating its association with chloroplast. In plants expressing AtβCA2‐GFP and AtβCA3‐GFP, GFP fluorescence was emitted in the cytosol (Fig. 5). To allow a better evidence that the GFP fluorescence originated from the cytosol, protoplasts from plant expressing AtβCA2‐GFP and AtβCA3‐GFP were used (Fig. 6). For AtβCA4‐GFP, GFP fluorescence was monitored in epidermal cells (Fig. 5), where the signal appeared as a thin line at the cell periphery, suggesting a localization in the plasma membrane. Protoplasts prepared from transgenic plants expressing AtβCA4‐GFP supported that the localization of AtβCA4 was restricted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). In plants expressing the AtβCA6‐GFP construct, fluorescence was localized to small particules, which we supposed to be mitochondria. Leaves fragments were infiltrated with MitoTracker (Molecular Probes); merging GFP and MitoTracker fluorescence confirmed mitochondria targeting of AtβCA6 (Fig. 7).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~!  Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia‐0) plants were potted in soil and grown in controlled environments under an 8h photoperiod of 300 µmol m–2 s–1. Day/night temperature and relative humidity were 22/18 °C and 60/50%, respectively. For tissue expression assays, tissues were harvested on silique ripening plants (growth stage 8, Boyes et al. 2001). For the CO2 experiments, plants were grown in CO2‐controlled environmental chambers with CO2 concentration set at 150, 360 or 1000 μL L−1. The general design of the chambers, including the temperature and hygrometry control and the CO2 regulation, was extensively described (Fabreguettes et al. 1994).  Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of frozen sample using RNeasy Plant Minikit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and was treated with RNAse free DNAse set (Qiagen) to eliminate any genomic DNA contamination. First‐strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 µg total RNA using Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) and oligo(dT) as primer. PCR conditions were 25 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 45 s. Reactions were run in a Gene Amp PCR system 2700 cycler (Applied Biosciences, Courtaboeuf, France). The following specific primer pairs were designed in different exon sequences; thus, the cDNA could be distinguished from genomic DNA: AtβCA1 (At3g01500), 5′‐AATCTTCTCTCCAGAAACTC‐3′ and 5′‐ACCCTTTGCGAGCTCACCGTA‐3′; AtβCA2 (At5g14740), 5′‐TTCAGCCACTTCAAACTTGAA‐3′ and 5′‐TGGTAAACAGATTTTGACCCA‐3′; AtβCA3 (At1g23730) 5′‐CCAAGAACAGGATCAAGCAGGA‐3′ and 5′‐AAGGCAAAGGCAGGGGTAGTCT‐3′; AtβCA4 (At1g70410), 5′‐TTTCATGTTCTGCTGCGCTA‐3′ and 5′‐TGGAAATTCAAGATGTGAGAT‐3′; AtβCA5 (At4g33580), 5′‐ATTGATCCAGATTCGAAGTA‐3′ and 5′‐GTAGTGTTCAAAGTCATCCAT‐3′; AtβCA6 (At1g58180), 5′‐TCGTCGTCTAGTCTCTGCAA‐3′ and 5′‐CTGAACCGGGGTAACGAGAT‐3′; AtαCA1 (At3g52720), 5′‐ACTAGTGAACCACGTCTGTAA‐3′ and 5′‐AGTAGTGAGTGAACCAATGTAT‐3′; AtαCA2 (At2g28210), 5′‐AATAGAGGCCATGATATGATGCTG‐3′ and 5′‐AGTAGTAAGTGATCCAATGTAT‐3′; AtαCA3 (At5g04180), 5′‐AACCGTGGATTCGACATGAAGGTT‐3′ and 5′‐AGTCGTGAGTGAACCTCTGTAT‐3′; AtαCA4 (At4g20990), 5′‐ACACGCTCATTCTGAAGCG‐3′ and 5′‐CCCTTTGAGTCTTGAACCGG‐3′; AtαCA5 (At1g08065), 5′‐AAGAAAGGAGAGAAGGGGCC‐3′ and 5′‐AGTTTACTATGCCATGTTGG‐3′; AtαCA6 (At4g21000), 5′‐CGTTTATGCTCGTGAAACG‐3′ and 5′‐ACGCCTTCGTGCATGGAGG‐3′; AtαCA7 (At1g08080), 5′‐TGCTTCAAGTCACGGAGAAG‐3′ and 5′‐GTGCACTATGCGCTTGTTGG‐3′; AtαCA8 (At5g56330) 5′‐ACTAGGATGGGTCTTAGTCC‐3′ and 5′‐CGGATAGTGACACCAATACC‐3′.  As control, RT‐PCR was performed using actin gene‐specific primers (At2g37620), 5′‐AAAATGGCTGATGGTGAAGACA‐3′ and 5′‐GATGGTTATGACTTGTCCAT‐3′.  RT‐PCR analysis of CA transcripts in different plant tissues and in leaves of plants exposed to varied CO2 concentrations were repeated four and two times, respectively.  Total leaf RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and PCR were carried out as for transcript analysis. All constructs were made using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen, Cergy‐Pontoise, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA of each of the six AtβCA genes was amplified using primers (see below) allowing the addition of attB recombination sites and was cloned into a pDONR221 vector using a Gateway BP Clonase enzyme mix technology (Invitrogen). One entry clone was fully sequenced before subsequent cloning in frame with an N‐terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene in the binary Gateway destination vector pB7FWG2 (Plant Systems Biology, VIB‐Ghent University, Belgium) (Karimi, Inze & Depicker 2002) by using a Gateway LR Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen). The pB7FWG2 vector allows fusion of EGFP with the CA C terminus, and expression of the resulting cDNA is placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and of the 3′ untranslated transcribed region of a nopaline synthase gene. The binary constructs were introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, and the resulting bacterial cultures were used to transform Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia‐0 by the standard flower dip method (Clough & Bent 1998).  AtβCA1: 5′‐GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGGAACCGAAGCATAC–3′, 5′‐GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTACAGAGCTAGTTTCGGA–3′; AtβCA2: 5′‐GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGGAAACGAATCATATG–3′, 5′‐GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTATAGAATGAACGGGGGA‐3′; AtβCA3: 5′‐GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGTCGACAGAGTCGTAC‐3′, 5′‐GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAGACAAGGCAAAGGCAGG‐3′; AtβCA4: 5′‐GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCTCCTGCATTCGGA‐3′, 5′‐GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAGAGAAGGCAAAAGCAGG‐3′; AtβCA5: 5′‐GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCAGCCACTCCCACAC‐3′, 5′‐GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAGACCAAACTGACCGGTC‐3′; Atβ CA6: 5′‐GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCGTTTACACTAGGTG‐3′, 5′‐GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCACTCCATATCTCTCTGTC‐3′.  Whenever necessary, protoplasts were isolated in a solution of 1% cellulases R10 (Serva, Paris, France) and 0.25% macerozyme R10 (Serva) dissolved in 2‐morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES)‐KOH buffer (50 mM, pH 5.6) containing 8 mM CaCl2 and 400 mM mannitol (O'Neill et al. 1993). Following overnight digestion, protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 3 min.  Images of green GFP fluorescence and chlorophyll red autofluorescence were monitored using a confocal laser scaning microscope (LCTCS‐SP2; Leica, Rueil‐Malmaison, France) with a 488 nm argon laser excitation. Objective HCX Plan Apo CS 40X Oil NA1.40 (Leica) was used. The fluorescence signals were collected from 500 to 535 nm for GFP and from 680 to 720 nm for chlorophyll. For mitochondria detection, just before observation, small leaf fragments (1 mm2) wereinfiltrated with the dye MitoTracker Red (CM‐H2XROS; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Excitation was performed at 561 nm using a laser diode and fluorescence collected from 590 to 610 nm.
