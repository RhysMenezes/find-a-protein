!~ABS~! During leaf senescence, chlorophyll (Chl) is broken down to nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs). These arise from intermediary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (FCCs) by an acid-catalyzed isomerization inside the vacuole. The chemical structures of NCCs from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) indicate the presence of an enzyme activity that demethylates the C132-carboxymethyl group present at the isocyclic ring of Chl. Here, we identified this activity as methylesterase family member 16 (MES16; At4g16690). During senescence, mes16 leaves exhibited a strong ultraviolet-excitable fluorescence, which resulted from large amounts of different FCCs accumulating in the mutants. As confirmed by mass spectrometry, these FCCs had an intact carboxymethyl group, which slowed down their isomerization to respective NCCs. Like a homologous protein cloned from radish (Raphanus sativus) and named pheophorbidase, MES16 catalyzed the demethylation of pheophorbide, an early intermediate of Chl breakdown, in vitro, but MES16 also demethylated an FCC. To determine the in vivo substrate of MES16, we analyzed pheophorbide a oxygenase1 (pao1), which is deficient in pheophorbide catabolism and accumulates pheophorbide in the chloroplast, and a mes16pao1 double mutant. In the pao1 background, we additionally mistargeted MES16 to the chloroplast. Normally, MES16 localizes to the cytosol, as shown by analysis of a MES16-green fluorescent protein fusion. Analysis of the accumulating pigments in these lines revealed that pheophorbide is only accessible for demethylation when MES16 is targeted to the chloroplast. Together, these data demonstrate that MES16 is an integral component of Chl breakdown in Arabidopsis and specifically demethylates Chl catabolites at the level of FCCs in the cytosol.
!~RES~! The distribution of PPD activity was shown to correlate with the occurrence of NCCs harboring a free C132-carboxyl group. For example, all investigated Brassicaceae species have PPD activity (CITATION), and O134-demethylated FCCs and NCCs have been found in canola and Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION), indicating that PPD could be responsible for this site-specific modification. A protein BLAST search of RsPPD against the Arabidopsis proteome uncovered high homology to members of the MES family of Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION). Thereby, RsPPD clustered with the members of subfamily 2, as determined by CITATION, with highest homology to MES16 (Fig. 1A). The phylogenetic tree of Figure 1A includes further MES-like EST-derived sequences from plant species for which NCC structures have been determined. The tree indicates that subfamily 2 members of the MES protein family are indeed present in other Brassicaceae species, but also in barley and maize (Zea mays), where evidence for hydrolysis of the methylester group at C132 has not been provided (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Analysis of gene expression patterns has proven successful in the past to identify potential Chl catabolic enzymes (CITATION; CITATION). When analyzing microarray expression data of the Arabidopsis MES genes using the Genevestigator tool (CITATION), MES5, MES9, and MES16 exhibited increased expression levels in senescent leaves compared with green leaves (Fig. 1B). In addition, using the ATTED tool (CITATION), MES16 was found in a network of coexpression with other Chl catabolic genes (Supplemental Fig. S1). Using semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we confirmed the senescence-regulated expression of MES16 in the wild type upon dark-induced senescence (Fig. 1C). Thereby, the expression pattern was very similar to the expression of PAO and SGR. SGR is required for the initiation of Chl breakdown and has been proposed to play a regulatory role in Chl-apoprotein complex destabilization (CITATION). From this analysis, MES16 appeared to be the most likely candidate for O134-demethylation in Arabidopsis. To investigate its enzymatic activity, recombinant MES16 was produced in Escherichia coli in fusion with an N-terminal His tag. MES16 (Fig. 2A) was able to convert Pheide a to pyro-Pheide a in a time-dependent manner. As described for RsPPD (CITATION), MES16 most likely only catalyzed methylester hydrolysis of Pheide a to O134-desmethyl Pheide a, while the subsequent decarboxylation to pyro-Pheide a occurred spontaneously without the involvement of MES16; however, this was not analyzed in more detail. When pFCC was used as the substrate for recombinant MES16, a new, more polar FCC peak appeared in reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2B), which by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (for MS data, see “Materials and Methods”) was identified as the O134-demethylated form of pFCC (O134-desmethyl pFCC). In contrast, recombinant His-tagged versions of MES17 and MES18, the two other subfamily 2 members (Fig. 1A), and MES5 and MES9, the other senescence-regulated MES proteins (Fig. 1B), were unable to demethylate pFCC (Supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). [[FIGURE]] As described for RsPPD (CITATION), MES16 was unable to demethylate CjNCC-1, an NCC isolated from senescent leaves of Cercidiphyllum japonicum (CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S2D). MES16 has been shown to hydrolyze MeJA and MeIAA (CITATION). To obtain insight into the substrate specificity of recombinant MES16, we tested its pFCC esterase activity in the presence of 100-fold molar excesses of MeJA, MeIAA, and methyl salicylic acid (MeSA) or a 10-fold molar excess of Pheide a. As shown in Figure 2E, under these conditions, pFCC demethylation was only impaired to some extent by MeIAA, indicating that in vitro, MES16 has a high preference for an FCC as substrate. To investigate the in vivo role of MES16 in relation to Chl breakdown, two independent T-DNA insertion lines, named mes16-1 and mes16-2 (Fig. 3A), were obtained from the SALK resource (CITATION). MES16 expression analysis of these mutants indicated both alleles to represent true knockout mutants (Fig. 3B). The absence of full-length MES16 transcripts in these mutants did not affect the senescence-regulated expression of PAO and SGR (Fig. 3B). The mutants did not show any phenotype during normal growth under either short-day or long-day conditions. When senescence was induced in the dark with detached leaves, mes16 mutants did not exhibit a dramatic stay-green phenotype, although, compared with the wild type, Chl was significantly retained at a low level (Fig. 3C). [[FIGURE]] When extracts of senescent leaves of mes16-1 and mes16-2 were analyzed for the presence of FCCs and NCCs using reverse-phase HPLC, major differences were observed in comparison with wild-type leaves (Fig. 4A). Thus, except for two peaks comigrating with pFCC and At-NCC-4 (CITATION), all FCCs and NCCs of the mes16 mutants, as detected by their typical fluorescence and/or absorption properties, were likely novel Chl catabolites not found before in Arabidopsis. The three major FCC fractions, tentatively named mes16-FCC-1, mes16-FCC-2, and mes16-FCC-3, and the major NCC fraction (mes16-NCC-1) were isolated from mes16-1 and analyzed by MS (for MS data, see “Materials and Methods”). As seen in Table I, all analyzed catabolites possessed an intact C132-carboxymethyl group. In addition, the respective identities of mes16-FCC-3 and mes16-NCC-1 with pFCC and At-NCC-4, the only O134-methylated catabolites detected in the wild type (CITATION), could be confirmed by MS and HPLC. To our surprise, quantification of these catabolites revealed that both mes16 lines accumulated significantly higher overall amounts of FCC and NCC (Fig. 4B). The reason for this higher quantity of Chl catabolites in the mutants is unclear at present. Moreover, while the wild type almost exclusively accumulated NCCs, senescent mes16 leaves contained high proportions of FCCs. As a consequence, senescent mes16 leaves, but not wild-type leaves, exhibited blue fluorescence when excited with UV light (Fig. 4C). Intense fluorescence could also be observed in naturally senesced mes16-1 leaves (Supplemental Fig. S3B). To investigate whether the other MES subfamily 2 members (i.e. MES17 and MES18; Fig. 1A) or other senescence-regulated MES proteins (i.e. MES5 and MES9; Fig. 1B) are involved in Chl breakdown, T-DNA insertion lines of respective genes were isolated and FCCs and NCCs were analyzed after dark-induced senescence (Supplemental Fig. S3C). None of these mutants exhibited a catabolite pattern that was different from the wild type. Together with the above-described absence of Chl catabolite esterase activity of the respective recombinant proteins (Supplemental Fig. S2), this result indicates that MES16 acts nonredundantly toward the formation of Chl catabolites that carry a free carboxylic acid function at C132. [[FIGURE]] To analyze why mes16 mutants accumulated rather high amounts of FCCs, we first investigated the subcellular localization of these Chl catabolites. To this end, Chl catabolites extracted from isolated vacuoles of senescent mes16-1 leaf material were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and compared with the catabolites of protoplasts (Fig. 5A). The pattern of FCCs and NCCs was identical in the two fractions and, given a rather low contamination of the vacuolar fraction with extravacuolar compartments, also the relative amounts of different catabolites were comparable between vacuoles and protoplasts. The major difference between these two fractions was pFCC (=mes16-FCC-3), which was absent from vacuoles. This indicated that most of the FCCs and NCCs found in mes16-1 accumulated in the vacuolar sap, as is known for wild-type Arabidopsis and other plant species (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Using confocal microscopy, vacuolar localization of mes16-FCCs was confirmed in senescent mes16-1 leaves; when excited with a 355-nm laser, mutant cells of the palisade mesophyll exhibited a strong blue fluorescence that covered the entire cellular space, indicating vacuolar origin (Fig. 5B). In contrast, wild-type mesophyll tissue only weakly fluoresced under these conditions. [[FIGURE]] These data let us assume that the isomerization of FCCs to NCCs was compromised in mes16 mutants. We speculated that this phenomenon could result from the possibility that the presence of an intact C132-carboxymethyl group in the mes16-FCCs could affect the efficiency of their isomerization to the respective NCCs. To test this, we compared the rates of FCC-to-NCC isomerization at different pH values using either pFCC (with an intact C132-carboxymethyl group) or the product of its hydrolysis with recombinant MES16, O134-desmethyl pFCC (Fig. 5C). Both FCCs were converted to the respective NCCs, but the rates of isomerization differed considerably, as judged from the half-lives of the FCC substrates under the given pH conditions. Thus, both at pH 5 and 6, the conversion of O134-desmethyl pFCC was about three times faster than that of pFCC (Table II). This delay of isomerization is likely, at least in part, responsible for the observed retention of FCCs in the mes16 mutants. A second (additional) possibility (i.e. that the vacuolar pH could be higher in mes16 and, therefore, the acid-catalyzed FCC-to-NCC isomerization could be slower as compared with the wild type) was not experimentally tested here. 4Half-lives of O134-desmethyl-pFCC and pFCC As shown above, the absence of MES16 in mes16 mutants abolished the O134-demethylation of Chl catabolites, as seen in the FCCs and NCCs, the (final) products of degradation. At the same time, recombinant MES16 was able to demethylate both Pheide and pFCC. Therefore, the question arose, what is the in vivo substrate of MES16? To answer this, we first investigated the subcellular localization of MES16 by transiently expressing a MES16-GFP fusion protein in wild-type protoplasts and analyzing GFP fluorescence with confocal microscopy (Fig. 6A). Similar to a free GFP control, MES16-GFP localized to the cytosol. The integrity of the fusion protein was analyzed on immunoblots of transformed protoplasts using an anti-GFP antiserum (Fig. 6B). This localization excluded Pheide a as a likely substrate for MES16, because PAO, the exclusive Pheide a-catabolizing enzyme of higher plants, has been localized to the chloroplast (CITATION; CITATION) and export of Pheide from senescent chloroplasts followed by reimport of O134-desmethyl Pheide is unlikely to occur (CITATION). To confirm that the in vivo activity of MES16 is restricted to the cytosol, we mistargeted C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MES16 to the chloroplast in transgenic ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and pao1. To direct MES16-HA to the chloroplast, we N-terminally fused it to the 48 N-terminal amino acids of Arabidopsis PPH, which represent the predicted chloroplast transit peptide of PPH (CITATION; Fig. 6C). Stroma localization of the chimeric construct (PPHTP-MES16-HA) in Col-0 (Col-0/PPHTP-MES16-HA) lines could be confirmed on immunoblots of protein extracts of protoplasts, chloroplasts, and subchloroplast fractions using anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 6D). We then compared the patterns of accumulating Pheide pigments in senescent leaves of the wild type, pao1/PPHTP-MES16-HA, mes16-1, and a mes16-1pao1 double mutant (Fig. 6E). While the wild type, as expected, was devoid of Pheide a, this Chl breakdown intermediate accumulated to a similar extent in pao1 and mes16-1pao1. In contrast, when targeting MES16 to the chloroplast in the pao1 background, a large proportion of the accumulating Pheide a had been converted to pyro-Pheide a. This result indicated that under natural conditions, MES16 does not have access to Pheide a, implying that the likely in vivo substrate of MES16 (in the cytosol) is an FCC. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Col-0 was used as the wild type. Ecotype Wassilewskija was also analyzed in experiments including mes18-1 (Wassilewskija background). T-DNA insertion lines were from the following collections: SALK lines (CITATION): AT4G16690-1 (mes16-1), SALK_139756; AT4G16690-2 (mes16-2), SALK_151578; AT4G37150-1 (mes9-1), SALK_030442; SAIL lines (CITATION): AT3G10870-1 (mes17-1), SAIL_503_C03; GABI lines (CITATION): AT5G10300-1 (mes5-1), GABI_453E01; FLAG lines (CITATION): AT5G58310-1 (mes18-1), FLAG_271B02. SALK and SAIL lines were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Center. The GABI line was obtained from GABI Kat, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research. The FLAG line was obtained from the Arabidopsis Resource Centre for Genomics. Homozygous plants were identified by PCR using T-DNA-, transposon-, and gene-specific primers as listed in Supplemental Table S1. Likewise, a homozygous mes16-1pao-1 double mutant was identified by PCR. Plants were grown on soil either in short days (8 h of light/16 h of dark) under fluorescent light of 60 to 120 μmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22°C or in long days (16 h of light/8 h of dark) in a greenhouse with fluence rates of 100 to 200 μmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22°C. For senescence induction, leaves from 8-week-old (short-day) plants were excised and incubated in permanent darkness on wet filter paper for up to 10 d at ambient temperature. Methylesterase homologs from canola (Brassica napus), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and maize (Zea mays) were identified by TBLASTN searches (CITATION) of MES16 with the est_others database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). EST sequences were conceptually translated. MES protein sequences were aligned and subjected to a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis using phylogeny.fr (http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/index.cgi). Phylogeny.fr (CITATION) employs MUSCLE for multiple sequence alignments, Gblocks for alignment curation, PhyML for phylogeny analysis, and TreeDyn for tree drawing and was used with the default settings. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 100 replicates. MES16 was amplified by PCR with the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) using the primers listed in Supplemental Table S1, introducing SmaI/SpeI restriction sites at the ends. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) and, after SmaI/Spel digestion, subcloned into pUC18-spGFP6 (CITATION), thereby producing a fusion of MES16 with the N terminus of GFP. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from 6-week-old short-day-grown Col-0 plants according to published procedures (CITATION; CITATION). Cell numbers were quantified with a Neubauer chamber and adjusted to a density of 2 to 3 × 106 protoplasts mL−1. Protoplasts were transformed by 20% polyethylene glycol transformation (CITATION). Transformed cells were incubated for 48 h in the dark at room temperature before laser scanning confocal microscopic analysis (DM IRE2; Leica Microsystems). GFP fluorescence was imaged at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and the emission signal was recovered between 495 and 530 nm. Free GFP expressed from empty pUC18-spGFP6 was used as a control for cytosolic localization. Proteins of fractions corresponding to 1 to 2 × 106 protoplasts were precipitated with chloroform-methanol (CITATION) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-GFP immunoblotting. For confocal microscopy of leaves, the lower epidermis and spongy mesophyll were removed from senescent leaves of Col-0 and mes16-1 using fine sandpaper. The palisade mesophyll was then observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems). FCC fluorescence was induced with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm, and the emission signal was recovered between 430 and 470 nm. A fusion protein consisting of the PPH transit peptide (amino acids 1–48; CITATION), MES16, and an HA tag (PPHTP-MES16-HA) was produced using a two-step PCR (Expand High Fidelity PCR system) with the primers listed in Supplemental Table S1. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T-easy (Promega) and, after digestion with EcoRI/HindIII, subcloned into pHannibal (CITATION). The pHannibal cassette containing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, the fusion open reading frame, and an octopine synthase terminator was excised with NotI and introduced into NotI-restricted pGreen0179 (CITATION). Arabidopsis Col-0 and pao-1 plants were transformed by the floral-dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected on hygromycin, and resistant T2 plants were used for further analysis. To verify that PPHTP-MES16-HA was targeted to the chloroplasts, protoplasts were isolated from Col-0 and Col-0/PPHTP-MES16-HA as described above. Chloroplasts were then isolated from protoplasts following published procedures (CITATION; CITATION). Chl concentration was measured for each fraction as described below. Proteins from aliquots corresponding to 15 μg of Chl were precipitated with chloroform-methanol (CITATION). In parallel, an aliquot of chloroplasts was fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions (CITATION), and proteins were precipitated as well. Proteins from the different fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by anti-HA immunoblotting. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen). After DNA digestion with RQ1 DNase (Promega), first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was performed with a nonsaturating number of amplification cycles as shown in the figures using gene-specific primers as listed in Supplemental Table S1. MES5, MES9, MES16, and MES17 cloned in pET28a (CITATION) were subcloned in pProEX Hta (Invitrogen) using EcoRI (MES5, MES16, and MES17) or EcoRI/XhoI (MES9) restriction sites. The MES18 coding sequence was amplified by PCR (Expand High Fidelity PCR system) from clone U50042 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) using the primers listed in Supplemental Table S1 and cloned into pProEX Hta via EcoRI. After sequencing, the plasmids were transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). At an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, protein expression was induced with 1.0 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside and cells were grown at 30°C overnight. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, complemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete; Roche Applied Science) before lysis with a high-pressure cell breaker (Constant Cell Disruption System; Constant Systems) at a pressure of 150 MPa. The cell lysates were examined by SDS-PAGE and anti-His immunoblotting to quantify relative levels of MES protein expression. Standard pFCC assays with MES16 (total volume of 20 μL) consisted of 0.25 μg of crude protein extracts and 15 μm pFCC. Pheide assays contained 0.85 mm Pheide and 100 μg of crude protein extracts in a total volume of 30 μL. For assays with an NCC, CjNCC-1 (CITATION) was used at 15 μm. After incubation at 25°C in darkness for different periods of time as indicated in the figures, the reactions were stopped by the addition of methanol (pFCC assay) or acetone (Pheide assay) to final concentrations of 60% or 50%, respectively. Crude protein extracts produced with empty pProEX Hta were used as controls. After centrifugation (2 min at 16,000g), samples were analyzed by HPLC as described below. For competition experiments, inhibitors were added to the pFCC assay at a final concentration of 1.5 mm (100×) for MeIAA, MeSA, and MeJA or 150 μm (10×) for Pheide. pFCC assays with MES5, MES9, MES17, and MES18 (total volume of 40 μL) consisted of 7.5 μm pFCC and a volume of Escherichia coli lysates containing an amount of recombinant protein equivalent to the amount of MES16 present in 0.25 μg of crude MES16 extract. PAO and RCCR were extracted from red pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruits as follows. Exocarp tissue was blended in a Sorvall mixer three times for 5 s each in a solution (2–3 mL g−1 fresh weight) containing 400 mm Suc, 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm polyethylene glycol 4000, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm l(+)-ascorbic acid. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth and centrifuged (10 min at 10,000g). The pellet was resuspended (25 μL g−1 fresh exocarp tissue) in 25 mm Tris-MES, pH 8, 5 mm l(+)-ascorbic acid, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated during 30 min in the dark at 4°C on a shaking plate (15 rpm) to solubilize membrane proteins. After ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000g), aliquots of the supernatant containing RCCR and solubilized PAO were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C before use. pFCC was synthesized as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, assays contained 80% (v/v) PAO/RCCR extract from red pepper (see above), 0.5 mm Pheide (CITATION), 0.2 mg mL−1 ferrodoxin (Fd), and a Fd-reducing system consisting of 2 mm Glc-6-P, 1 mm NADPH, 1 milliunit μL−1 Glc-6-P dehydrogenase, 0.1 milliunit μL−1 Fd-NADPH-oxidoreductase, and 0.1 milliunit μL−1 catalase. After 1 h of incubation at 25°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of methanol to a final concentration of 60% (v/v). The assays were then cleaned and concentrated using a C18-SepPak cartridge (Waters) prior to purification of pFCC by HPLC (see below). Pure pFCC fractions were stored in liquid nitrogen before use. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from 6-week-old short-day-grown Col-0 and mes16-1 plants after dark incubation of detached leaves for 4 d. Recovered protoplasts were digested in 10 volumes of lysis solution as described (CITATION). The progression of vacuole release was continuously controlled using the microscope, and vacuoles were purified and concentrated by centrifugation (8 min at 1,400g) using a step gradient as follows: lower phase, 1 volume of lysate; middle phase, 1 volume of a 1:1 mixture of lysis solution and betaine buffer (0.4 m betaine, 30 mm potassium-gluconate, 20 mm HEPES-imidazole, pH 7.2, 1 mg mL−1 bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol); upper phase, one-third volume of betaine buffer. Vacuoles were collected from the interface between the middle and upper phases. Contamination of Arabidopsis vacuoles with Chl was determined as described below. The activity of soluble vacuolar 3-N-acetyglucosaminidase was determined using p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, 10 μL of protoplast and vacuole fractions was incubated with 90 μL of 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 3 mm p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide. The assay mixtures were incubated on a 96-well microtiter plate at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 160 μL of 1 m Na2CO3. The absorbance of formed p-nitrophenol was read with a plate reader spectrophotometer at 405 nm (Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer; Packard). NCCs and FCCs of protoplast and vacuole fractions corresponding to equal activities of 3-N-acetyglucosaminidase were extracted with methanol and concentrated on a C18-SepPak cartridge prior to analysis by HPLC as described below for plant material. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard procedures. Proteins were labeled with monoclonal antibodies against the poly-His tag (1:5,000) or GFP (1:2,000) or with polyclonal antibodies against the HA tag (1:5,000; all from Sigma). Thereafter, primary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and proteins were visualized on a ChemiDoc XRS station (Bio-Rad) using the Immun-Star HRP Chemifluorescence kit (Bio-Rad). FCC fluorescence in senescent leaves of Col-0 and mes16-1 was visualized under UV light (366 nm) with the ChemiDoc XRS setup. Pigments were extracted from liquid nitrogen-homogenized tissue during 2 h at −20°C in 10% (v/v) 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, in acetone precooled to –20°C (5 mL g−1 fresh weight). After two centrifugation steps (4 min, 16,000g, 4°C), supernatants were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described (CITATION). The same conditions were used to analyze the products of in vitro MES assays with Pheide as substrate. Pigments were identified by their absorption spectra and quantified using peak areas at 665 nm. For Chl quantification, supernatants were analyzed spectrophotometrically (CITATION). Chl quantification of protoplast, chloroplast, and vacuole fractions was performed as follows. An aliquot of the fractions was 333-fold diluted with 20% (v/v) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, in acetone and mixed vigorously. After centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000g, Chl concentrations of the supernatants were determined spectrophotometrically according to CITATION. Plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen, and colorless catabolites were extracted with 3 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7:methanol (1:3, v/v). The reverse-phase HPLC system consisted of a C18 Hypersil ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm; Thermo Electron), which was developed with a gradient (flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1) of solvent B (100% methanol) in solvent A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) as follows (all v/v): 20% to 60% in 30 min, 60% during 10 min, to 100% in 2 min, and 100% during 5 min. For HPLC analysis of in vitro pFCC assays (esterase and isomerization assays), the column was developed with a gradient (flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1) of solvent B in solvent A as follows (all v/v): 35% to 75% in 19 min, to 100% in 1 min, and 100% during 4 min. Peak detection was performed with sequential monitoring using a PA-100 photodiode array detector (200–700 nm; Dionex) and a RF2000 fluorescence detector (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 450 nm; Dionex). Chl catabolites were identified by their absorption (FCCs and NCCs) and fluorescence (FCCs) properties. Relative amounts of FCCs and NCCs were determined using peak areas at 320 nm. For MS analysis, catabolite-containing HPLC fractions derived from MES16 enzyme assays or mes16-1 leaf extracts were mixed with 1 volume of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile and were spotted onto stainless-steel targets. MS was performed with an Ultraflex matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker). Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight MS data (percentage relative intensity, molecular formula, and type of ion) are as follows: mes16-FCC-1: 883.09 (33, C41H49K2N4O13, [M+2K]+), 845.13 (100, C41H50K1N4O13, [M+K]+), 807.16 (56, C41H51N4O13, [M+H]+); mes16-FCC-2: 683.26 (45, C35H40K1N4O8, [M+K]+), 645.30 (100, C35H41N4O8, [M+H]+); mes16-FCC-3: 667.23 (19, C35H40K1N4O7, [M+K]+), 629.25 (100, C35H41N4O7, [M+H]+); mes16-NCC-1: 883.33 (16, C41H49K2N4O13, [M+2K]+), 845.36 (100, C41H50K1N4O13, [M+K]+), 807.38 (50, C41H51N4O13, [M+H]+); O134-desmethyl pFCC: 647.14 (25, C33H37K2N4O5, [M+2K-CO2]+), 615.22 (33, C34H39N4O7, [M+H]+), 609.17 (80, C33H38K1N4O5, [M+1K-CO2]+), 571.19 (100, C33H39N4O5, [M+H-CO2]+). O134-desmethyl pFCC was produced from pure pFCC fractions using heterologously expressed MES16 and purified by HPLC. The isomerization assays consisted of 11.5 μm FCC (pFCC or O134-desmethyl pFCC) and 70 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5 or 6. Aliquots were taken after the incubation times indicated in Figure 5C, and isomerization was stopped by adding Tris-HCl, pH 8, to a concentration of 300 mm. Methanol was added to a final concentration of 35% (v/v) prior to analysis by HPLC as described above.
