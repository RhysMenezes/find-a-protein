!~ABS~! Supramolecular organization of enzymes is proposed to orchestrate metabolic complexity and help channel intermediates in different pathways. Phenylpropanoid metabolism has to direct up to 30% of the carbon fixed by plants to the biosynthesis of lignin precursors. Effective coupling of the enzymes in the pathway thus seems to be required. Subcellular localization, mobility, protein–protein, and protein–membrane interactions of four consecutive enzymes around the main branch point leading to lignin precursors was investigated in leaf tissues of Nicotiana benthamiana and cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. CYP73A5 and CYP98A3, the two Arabidopsis cytochrome P450s (P450s) catalyzing para- and meta-hydroxylations of the phenolic ring of monolignols were found to colocalize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to form homo- and heteromers. They moved along with the fast remodeling plant ER, but their lateral diffusion on the ER surface was restricted, likely due to association with other ER proteins. The connecting soluble enzyme hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), was found partially associated with the ER. Both HCT and the 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase relocalized closer to the membrane upon P450 expression. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy supports P450 colocalization and interaction with the soluble proteins, enhanced by the expression of the partner proteins. Protein relocalization was further enhanced in tissues undergoing wound repair. CYP98A3 was the most effective in driving protein association.
!~RES~! Based on data from animal systems, P450s are pictured as proteins with free lateral mobility in a slowly remodeling ER (CITATION). To test if this applies to plant enzymes, CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 were expressed as enhanced GFP (eGFP) fusion proteins in plant membranes by transfection of N. benthamiana leaves. Since these P450s are anchored to the ER through an N-terminal signal peptide, they were eGFP tagged at the C terminus. Both CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 behaved as typical ER proteins when compared with free and ER-retained eGFP (Figures 2A to 2H). Determination of C4H and C3′H activities in the microsomal membranes of transformed leaves indicated that the NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from N. benthamiana successfully reduced the P450 enzymes from Arabidopsis. Based on relative activities detected in microsomes from leaves expressing the native and tagged proteins, eGFP tagging caused 57 and 65% reduction in enzyme activity for CYP73A5 and CYP98A3, respectively (see Supplemental Table 1 online). The presence of the eGFP tag at the C terminus is expected to produce a steric hindrance for P450 interaction with its electron donor CPR, since the C terminus and P450 regions involved in electron transfer (CITATION; CITATION) are located on the same face of the P450 protein. However, the near 40% residual activity of the tagged enzymes indicates that the presence of the eGFP does not completely prevent the P450–CPR interaction. [[FIGURE]] The plant ER is described as being very dynamic and constantly remodeling (CITATION; CITATION). Time-lapse imaging of CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 as eGFP-fused proteins (see CYP98A3 in Figure 3 and Supplemental Movie 1 online) illustrates their fast movement in the plant cell together with the ER network. The samples were then treated with the actin-depolymerizing agent Latrunculin B that limits movement to diffusion but preserves the ER structure (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Lamellar ER regions were then selected for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to evaluate lateral protein diffusion on the surface of the ER. Figure 4 compares bleaching and recovery recorded with plant leaves expressing free and ER-retained eGFP, P450:eGFP, 4-CL1:eGFP, and HCT:eGFP constructs. Bleaching was close to 20%, and recovery was nearly complete within 90 s for eGFP-HDEL (Figure 4A). Bleaching was above 40% and recovery very low and limited for both P450:eGFP constructs (Figures 4B and 4C; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). No bleaching was observed for soluble free eGFP, nor for 4-CL1:eGFP and HCT:eGFP (Figures 4D to 4F). The lateral diffusion of both CYP98A3 and CYP73A5 enzymes on the surface of the ER appears thus restricted, either due to supramolecular organization or the anchoring on a membrane or cytoskeleton component. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To investigate interaction of CYP98A3 and CYP73A5 with other membrane proteins, both of them were used as baits in tandem affinity purification (TAP) experiments performed with P450s that were C-terminally tagged with the protein G - Streptavidin (GS) tag (CITATION) and expressed in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures (CITATION). TAP tagging was performed in cells grown under standard conditions and under conditions inducing differentiation to tracheary elements and secondary wall deposition, which enhances expression of the lignin pathway (CITATION). Using CYP98A3 as bait, CYP73A5 was copurified two times in three independent TAP experiments, and this occurred only under inducing conditions (Table 1; see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). Two other proteins, the P450 PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 (PAD3 or CYP71B15), reported to catalyze the final steps in camalexin synthesis (CITATION; CITATION) and an esterase of unknown function (At5g22460) copurified with both CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 only under inducing conditions. Furthermore, the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (At5g53560), another P450, CYP706A1 (and/or its very close paralog CYP706A2), with as yet unknown activity, as well as a number of structural proteins copurified with both CYP73A5 and CYP98A3, but independent from the induction conditions. Among them were several members of the reticulon family that were shown to contribute to ER tubule shaping and to interact with ER resident proteins (CITATION, CITATION). Other CYP73A5/98A3 ligands included a band7 family protein that is the Arabidopsis homolog of the ER lipid raft-associated proteins (erlins) found associated with high molecular weight protein complexes in mammalian cells (CITATION; CITATION) and two proteins containing a C2-domain (At1g51570 and SYTA) that is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding and in membrane targeting processes (CITATION). Finally, MEMBRANE STEROID BINDING PROTEIN1 (MSBP1) and MSBP2, a plant VAMP-associated protein (PVA12), and STEROL C24-METHYL TRANSFERASE2 (SMT2) interacted with both CYPs in all repeats and conditions. MSBP1 and MSBP2 can bind to progesterone, brassinolide, and stigmasterol with different affinities and presumably have a role in steroid signaling (CITATION). PVA12 was demonstrated to be important for the ER localization of sterol binding proteins (CITATION). SMT2 expression impacts sterol composition of the membrane (CITATION) and is associated with vascular patterning (CITATION). Erg6p, the yeast homolog of SMT2, has been shown to belong to an ER complex of sterol biosynthetic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CITATION; CITATION). A similar TAP experiment using as bait an unrelated P450 enzyme of unknown function (At1g13710; CYP78A5) did not identify any of the interactors in Table 1. Such a robust set of proteins interacting with both CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 thus supports the hypothesis of a specific membrane-anchoring complex limiting P450 mobility on the membrane surface. 4-CL1 and HCT are described as soluble proteins (CITATION; CITATION). Their subcellular localization was compared with that of their membrane-bound partner P450s CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 in transfected N. benthamiana. 4-CL1 and HCT were expressed as both N-terminal and C-terminal eGFP fusions to allow all possible interactions with the membranes and membrane-bound proteins. eGFP tagging of the 4-CL1 or HCT did not hamper their catalytic activities indicating that the fusion proteins were functional (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Solubility of 4-CL1 and HCT (Figures 2I and 2J) was attested by their transport into the nucleus and further supported by high mobility observed in FRAP analysis (Figures 4E and 4F). Free diffusion of both enzymes is comparable to that of free eGFP and too fast for detectable photobleaching. However, both 4-CL1 and HCT generate a fuzzy reticulate pattern in the parietal regions of the cell (Figures 2K and 2L). This reticulate pattern is due to the squeezing of the cytoplasm between the turgescent vacuole and the cell wall but might also be indicative of a partial association of the soluble enzymes with the ER as previously reported for tobacco PAL1 (CITATION). We thus analyzed the distribution of the eGFP-tagged 4-CL1 and HCT proteins near the ER tubules and compared it to the distribution of the free eGFP, eGFP fused to the HDEL ER retention signal, and to NtPAL1:eGFP by image analysis of fluorescence as recently described by CITATION. The statistical analysis of the fluorescent pixels around the ER tubules indicated a similar distribution for eGFP and 4-CL1, whereas HCT was found more closely associated with the ER (Figure 2M). To confirm membrane association of HCT, soluble fractions and washed microsomal membranes were prepared from leaves of N. benthamiana expressing the soluble tag-free protein before testing enzyme activity. Significant activity was found associated with the microsome fraction (Figure 2N). HCT activity was also detected in washed microsomes isolated from control noninfiltrated plants. Membrane association was further confirmed by immunodetection of GFP in the membrane fraction prepared after transient expression of the eGFP fusion protein (Figure 2O). Taken together, our data indicate partial association of HCT with the ER membranes, which is reminiscent of what was previously reported for PAL1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). This association can be detected with isolated membranes and in vivo. To test if P450 proteins may influence membrane association of their soluble partners, we evaluated the impact of P450 expression on the localization of HCT and 4-CL1. In a first step, each soluble protein was coexpressed with each P450. Soluble proteins were tagged with eGFP and P450s with monomeric Red Fluorescent Protein 1 (mRFP1) for confirmation of their expression in the cells selected for measurement. After optimization in standard experiments, visual assessment indicated that nearly 100% of the epidermal cells expressed the fluorescent proteins. Coexpression with CYP98A3 triggered a significant relocalization of both HCT and 4-CL1 nearer to the ER, independent of the position of the tag (Figures 5A to 5C). CYP98A3 did not influence the distribution of free eGFP, and expression of CYP71B31, a P450 enzyme involved in isoprenoid metabolism (CITATION), did not modify the distribution of both HCT and 4-CL1. Localization of the soluble proteins was little affected by the coexpression of CYP73A5, with redistribution of 4-CL1 closer to the ER detected only when eGFP was fused at its C terminus (Figures 5D and 5E). We next tested the effect of addition of the two additional partner enzymes, the latter expressed without tags to keep the steric interference of the fluorescent tags minimal (Figures 5F and 5G). Significant redistribution in the presence of CYP98A3 and HCT was observed only in the case of eGFP:4-CL1, which was not pulled closer to the ER by CYP73A5:mRFP1 expressed alone (Figure 5G). No further change in protein distribution was detected when 4-CL1 or HCT were already drawn closer to the membrane by the expression of a single P450 protein. [[FIGURE]] CYP98A3 expression thus seems to drive redistribution of HCT and 4-CL1 near the ER membrane, while CYP73A5 only has a minor effect. Supramolecular organization of the lignin pathway would imply protein–protein interaction or at least local concentration of the partners involved. Indeed, TAP-tagging experiments performed with CYP98A3 led to repeated copurification of CYP73A5 (Table 1). To further corroborate protein interaction or association, the different target proteins were coexpressed as fusion constructs with different fluorescent proteins suitable for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). First we investigated the P450-P450 self- and cross-interactions. FRET detected upon expression of different P450 combinations was compared with FRET obtained upon P450 expression with free mRFP and mRFP anchored into the cytoplasmic surface of ER via the N-terminal signal peptide of the plant sterol 14α-demethylase CYP51G1 (51-mRFP) as a negative control (CITATION). Background FRET values (between 3.6 and 5.5%) were detected between soluble free mRFP and P450:eGFP proteins (Table 2). FRET between anchored 51-mRFP and P450s yielded comparable values (between 0 and 2.7%). By contrast, a high FRET value of 22.2% between eGFP- and mRFP-tagged CYP98A3s indicated a high propensity to dimerize or oligomerize. The FRET value was also significant although lower (9.3%) upon coexpression of CYP73A5:eGFP and CYP73A5:mRFP. Tests for cross-interactions between CYP73 and CYP98 provided FRET values ranging from 9.1 to 17.2% depending on the donor and acceptor protein, which most likely reflects a variable environment caused by the fusion with the fluorescent probes. As an additional negative control, we determined the FRET values resulting from the coexpression of CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 with CYP71B31, a P450 enzyme involved in isoprenoid metabolism (CITATION), which never exceeded 6%. Taken together, our data support the formation of homo- and heteromers (dimers or higher order oligomers) of CYP98A3 and CYP73A5. Tighter protein interaction is observed with CYP98A3, alone or in combination with CYP73A5. The association of CYP98A3 and CYP73A5 with HCT and 4-CL1 was tested in the presence or absence of the other two partner enzymes (Table 3). FLIM analysis was first performed to investigate interaction of CYP73A5 (eGFP at the C terminus) with 4-CL1 and HCT (mRFP at the N or C terminus). Low FRET values (0 to 5.3%) were indicative of no or poor interaction of CYP73A5 with 4-CL1 or HCT (Table 3). However, association of CYP73A5 with HCT was significantly increased upon coexpression of CYP98A3 and 4-CL1, with FRET values reaching 8.6 to 10.3%. A similar FLIM analysis was performed to test CYP98A3 association with HCT or 4-CL1. FRET values of 10.3% indicated proximity of HCT to CYP98A3 in the absence of the other partner enzymes. This association seemed to involve specific regions of the proteins since it occurred only with the N-terminal tagged mRFP:HCT. In the latter configuration, interaction was not further enhanced by the coexpression of CYP73A5 and 4-CL1. Conversely, interaction of CYP98A3 with the C-terminal tagged HCT:mRFP required the coexpression of partner protein(s) that favored close proximity of the eGFP and mRFP labels in the complex as indicated by a high FRET value of 18.2%. No interaction of CYP98A3 with 4-CL1 was detected in the absence of CYP73A5 and HCT. However, coexpression of the latter proteins drove CYP98A3/4-CL1 association, independent of the position of the mRFP-tag on 4-CL1. Finally, we tested if it was possible to detect 4-CL1 and HCT association (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Background FRET values between 0 and 2.3% were measured between the soluble proteins with all possible combinations of fusions with fluorescent probes. Upon coexpression of the P450 enzymes, an average FRET of 6.2% was detected with the 4-CL1:eGFP and HCT:mRFP combination. While this suggests possible spatial reorganization and closer proximity of the soluble proteins in the presence of partner P450s, it remains too low to conclude. However, values reached close to 20% in a small number of cells where relocalization was clearly visible in confocal images. The factor (cell type and stress) responsible for this conditional interaction could not be identified from the inspection of the leaf tissues. The conditional interactions observed in the differential TAP tagging of the P450 membrane proteins upon induced lignification in plant cells (Table 1) raised the question whether protein interaction or association can be influenced by the physiological status of the plant and/or the metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Mechanical injury is known to activate the expression of the genes of the phenolic pathway to support lignin and suberin deposition in the wound periderm near the wound site (CITATION; CITATION), and activated expression of CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 around wounded leaf tissues was reported in Arabidopsis (CITATION). Injury might thus provide a natural context favoring protein association. Hence, we investigated enzyme localization in the cell layers located in a wound healing zone. Transfected leaves of N. benthamiana were injured with a nail board 3 h before evaluation of protein relocalization in the healing cell layer (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). No wounding effect was detected with eGFP used as negative control (Figure 6A). Relocalization was observed with eGFP:4-CL1 expressed alone or coexpressed with CYP73A5, CYP98A3, or with a combination of CYP98A3, CYP73A5, and HCT (Figure 6B). Relocalization of HCT was detected only when HCT:eGFP was coexpressed with CYP73A5 (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). [[FIGURE]] FLIM analysis was then performed to determine if this resulted in enhanced protein association (see Supplemental Figure 2C online). Wounding did not result in significant changes in FRET values upon expression of eGFP-tagged P450s in any combination with other potential partners. By contrast, a clear wound effect was observed on the 4-CL1/HCT combinations with an average FRET value of 12.0% measured in the healing zone compared with 2.1% in healthy tissues. As already mentioned above, relocalization of the soluble proteins was visible in only a fraction of the cells when all four enzymes were present (Figure 6C). This fraction increased to 50% (instead of 20%) of the cells in the wound periphery. FRET values reached 19.5% between fluorescent 4-CL and HCT in these cells (see Supplemental Figure 2C online). The wound-healing context thus seems to favor association of 4-CL1 and HCT in the presence of CYP73A5 and CYP98A3.
!~MM~! Construction of the pCAMBIA2300 (for eGFP fusion) and pCAMBIA3300 (for mRFP fusion) plasmids with tagged CYP73A5 and CYP98A3 and anchored-eGFP and mRFP1 constructs was described by CITATION. Construction of the pCAMBIA2300 and pCAMBIA3300 plasmid with the CYP71B31:eGFP/mRFP1 fusion was described by CITATION. The full-length coding sequences of HCT and 4-CL1 were amplified with appropriate primers (see Supplemental Table 3 online) and fused in 5′ or 3′ with the amplified mRFP1 or eGFP coding sequences in the pCAMBIA230035Su or pCAMBIA330035Su vectors with the PCR-based USER fusion cloning technique (CITATION). The plasmids for expression of untagged CYP73A5, CYP98A3, HCT, and 4-CL1 were constructed by amplification of the coding sequences of the respective genes and insertion of the amplicons in the vector pCAMBIA230035Su or pCAMBIA330035Su with the single insert USER cloning technique (CITATION). A comprehensive list of the primers used for the constructions is provided in Supplemental Table 3 online. All PCR-based constructs were sequence verified for proper in-frame insertion and absence of mutations. The cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-driven genes were introduced into N. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration for transient expression as described by CITATION. At 4 to 5 d after infiltration, leaf disks were excised for observation by confocal microscopy, or leaves were collected to prepare soluble extracts and microsomal membranes. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains harboring vectors for the expression of eGFP:HDEL and mRFP1:HDEL were kindly provided by C. Ritzenthaler (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Biologie Moléculaire des Plantes, Strasbourg, France). Expression of untagged proteins was confirmed by dot blot (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Fresh tissues were ground in extraction buffer (40 mM ascorbic acid, 15 mM β-mercapthoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) in a ratio of 10 mL of buffer to 1 g of fresh tissue. Grinding was performed with an Ultra-turrax T25 (IKA) by two successive runs of 1 min at 7000 rpm. The extract was filtered on Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000g. The resulting supernatant was filtered on Miracloth and ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000g at 4°C. For 4-CL1 and HCT activity tests and control dot blot with eGFP, the supernatant was kept and the resulting pellet of microsomes was resuspended in extraction buffer in a ratio of 10 mL of buffer to 1 g of fresh tissue. The mixture was ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000g at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 3 × 2 mL of recovery buffer (30% glycerol in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and carefully resuspended in recovery buffer (10 μL per gram of initial fresh tissues). Microsomes and supernatant were stored at −30°C until analysis. Total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The 4-CL1 assay was performed in a microplate reader (Synergy HT; Biotek), monitoring the absorbance of the product at 333 nm. The assay mixture contained 4 μL of fraction to analyze, 1 mM DTT, 2.5 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM p-coumaric acid, and 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Reaction was started by the addition of 0.4 mM reduced CoA (Sigma-Aldrich). Kinetics were recorded at 25°C. Specific activities (SA) were calculated from initial velocity of product formation using the extinction coefficient for p-coumaroyl CoA: ε333 nm = 21 mM−1⋅cm−1 (CITATION). The HCT assay was performed in UV-star microplates (Greiner Bio-One), monitoring the absorbance of the product at 310 nm with a microplate reader (Synergy HT). The assay mixture contained the fraction to analyze (20 to 80 µg of total proteins), 1 mM DTT, 0.68 mM shikimic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Reactions were started by addition of 0.14 mM coumaroyl CoA (see Supplemental Methods 1 online for details about the preparation). Kinetics were recorded at 30°C. Specific activities were calculated from initial velocity of product formation using the extinction coefficient for p-coumaroyl shikimate: ε310 nm = 21.7 mM−1⋅cm−1. Cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images were recorded using a C-apochromat (×63/ 1.2 W Korr; Carl Zeiss) water immersion objective lens. For wide-field observations, a ×20 Zeiss objective was used. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 488/505 to 550 nm for eGFP and 561/575 to 615 nm for mRFP1. The images were acquired using AIM version 2.8 software (Carl Zeiss) and directly analyzed with ImageJ version 1.43n3 (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The movies were acquired using a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat (×63/1.4 oil differential interference contrast M27) oil immersion objective lens. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 488/SP555 nm for eGFP. The movies were acquired and prepared using the Zen version 2009 software (Carl Zeiss). Figures were assembled with Illustrator CS4 (Adobe Systems). Image acquisition and processing was performed as described by CITATION. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with posthoc analysis was performed with the Bonferroni-Holm posthoc test to determine consistency of significant difference of the values recorded in different conditions. Calculations were performed with the XL toolbox add-in for excel (XL toolbox v3.10; http://xltoolbox.sourceforge.net/). Figures were prepared with Excel 2010 (Microsoft) and assembled with Illustrator CS4. The tissues were mounted and cell imaging was performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as above. FRAP was performed on ER regions of 90 pixels (x) over 10 pixels (y) using a high-intensity bleach mode (with argon laser at 488 nm), unidirectional scans, intensity at 40 mA, line average 2, and a scan time of 3.15 s. Five prebleaching images were recorded, and area to bleach was photobleached during 200 scans (400 during tests with soluble enzymes). After the bleach, a series of postbleaching scans were performed. The postbleach fluorescence was sampled every 3.15 s. Figures were prepared with Excel 2010 and assembled with Illustrator CS4. The tissues were mounted as described above. FLIM was performed by time-correlated single-photon counting as described by CITATION. Measurements were done on a homebuilt two-photon system based on an Olympus IX70 microscope with an Olympus ×60 1.2–numerical aperture water immersion objective (CITATION). Two-photon excitation was provided by a titanium:sapphire laser (Tsunami; Newport) that was setup to an emission wavelength of 900 nm (for eGFP excitation). Imaging was performed with a laser scanning system using two fast galvo mirrors (Model 6210; Cambridge Technology). Photons were collected using a two-photon short-pass filter with a cutoff wavelength of 680 nm (F75-680; AHF), and a band-pass filter 520 ± 17 nm (F37-520; AHF). Fluorescence was analyzed by a fiber-coupled avalanche photodiode detector (SPCM-AQR-14-FC; Perkin-Elmer), which was connected to a time-correlated single-photon-counting module (SPC830; Becker and Hickl) operated in reversed start-stop mode. The samples were scanned continuously for 1 to 5 min to obtain appropriate photon numbers for reliable statistics for the fluorescence decays. Data were analyzed using SPCimage V2.9 (Becker and Hickl), which uses an iterative reconvolution method to recover the lifetimes from the fluorescence decays. Measurements were done on the whole image with a threshold setup to 50 and with an average of two pixels. For each condition, average values of all images recorded were used to calculate FRET efficiency. FRET was calculated using the equation: FRET = 1 – (τASSAY/τALONE) = (R06/(R06 + R)) with R0 the Förster radius, R the distance between donor and acceptor, τASSAY, the lifetime of the donor in the presence of the acceptor, and τALONE the lifetime of the donor in the absence of acceptor. Standard deviation was calculated as follows: sdFRET = %FRET √((sdASSAY/averageASSAY)2 + (sdALONE/averageALONE)2). Cloning of transgenes encoding tag fusions under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures were performed as previously described (CITATION). To scale up production, cells were subcultured in 50 mL of fresh medium without antibiotics at a 1:10 dilution and grown under standard conditions. After 1 week, cells were either harvested (non-=induced condition) or washed three times with 200 mL of adapted MSMO medium (4.43 g/L MSMO [Sigma-Aldrich], 30 g/L Suc, and 520 mg/L KH2PO4, pH 5.7) without hormones (induced condition). Washed cells were subsequently transferred to a one-liter shaker flask, diluted in 400 mL of the same medium used for washing, and incubated for 40 h at standard conditions. TAP of protein complexes was performed using the GS tag (CITATION) with the following protocol modifications. For all protein extractions prior to the affinity purification steps, the detergent Nonidet P-40 was replaced by digitonin (high purity; Calbiochem, Merck). Crude protein extracts were prepared in extraction buffer without detergent. After the mixing step, digitonin was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4°C under gentle rotation. A soluble protein fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 36,900g for two times 20 min at 4°C. In all further steps, the detergent 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 was replaced by 0.2% (w/v) digitonin. Protein precipitation and separation were done according to CITATION. For the protocols of proteolysis and peptide isolation, acquisition of mass spectra by a 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and mass spectrometry–based protein homology identification based on The Arabidopsis Information Resource genomic database, we refer to CITATION. Experimental background proteins were subtracted based on ∼40 TAP experiments on wild-type cultures and cultures expressing TAP-tagged mock proteins β-glucuronidase, RFP, and GFP (CITATION).
