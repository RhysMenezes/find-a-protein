!~ABS~!  Multiple eukaryotic Hsp70 typically localized in the cytoplasm are also distributed to the intermembrane space of chloroplasts and might thereby represent the missing link in energizing protein translocation.  Protein translocation into organelles is a central cellular process that is tightly regulated. It depends on signals within the preprotein and on molecular machines catalyzing the process. Molecular chaperones participate in transport and translocation of preproteins into organelles to control folding and to provide energy for the individual steps. While most of the processes are explored and the components are identified, the transfer of preproteins into and across the intermembrane space of chloroplasts is not yet understood. The existence of an energy source in this compartment is discussed, because the required transit peptide length for successful translocation into chloroplasts is shorter than that found for mitochondria where energy is provided exclusively by matrix chaperones. Furthermore, a cytosolic-type Hsp70 homologue was proposed as component of the chloroplast translocon in the intermembrane space energizing the initial translocation. The molecular identity of such intermembrane space localized Hsp70 remained unknown, which led to a controversy concerning its existence. We identified multiple cytosolic Hsp70s by mass spectrometry on isolated, thermolysin-treated Medicago sativa chloroplasts. The localization of these Hsp70s of M. sativa or Arabidopsis thaliana in the intermembrane space was confirmed by a self-assembly GFP-based in vivo system. The localization of cytosolic Hsp70s in the stroma of chloroplasts or different mitochondrial compartments could not be observed. Similarly, we could not identify any cytosolic Hsp90 in the intermembrane space of chloroplast. With respect to our results we discuss the possible targeting and function of the Hsp70 found in the intermembrane space.
!~RES~! Early experiments proposed the existence of an imsHsp70 (Marshall et al. CITATION; Waegemann and Soll CITATION; Ko et al. CITATION; Schnell et al. CITATION; Becker et al. CITATION), while some reports question the IMS localization of an Hsp70 (Ko et al. CITATION; Ratnayake et al. CITATION). Therefore, we inspected whether the Hsp70 detected in chloroplasts is a cytosolic contamination. At first we compared cell extract, isolated chloroplasts and isolated outer envelopes from pea, all normalized to chlorophyll content based on the previous observation that 0.3 µg of total outer envelope protein correspond to 10 µg of chlorophyll from chloroplasts (Elkehal et al. CITATION). However, the cell lysate was loaded according to 25 % of the chloroplast chlorophyll. As expected, the majority of the Hsp70 is localized in the cell lysate (Fig. 1a, panel αLpHsp70, lane 1), but a significant portion of Hsp70 is localized with chloroplasts (Fig. 1a, lane 2) and even with isolated outer envelope (Fig. 1a, lane 4). Remarkably, the Hsp70 within the chloroplasts or the outer envelope is thermolysin resistant (Fig. 1a, lanes 3, 5). The efficiency of the thermolysin treatment was confirmed by the observed protease sensitivity of the two TOC components Toc159 and Toc34 (Fig. 1a, panel αToc159, panel αToc34). In contrast to Hsp70, the exclusively outer envelope localized Toc159, Toc34 and outer envelope protein of 37 kDa are enriched in chloroplasts when compared to cell lysate, because cell lysate only contains 25 % of the chlorophyll content compared to the chloroplast sample (Fig. 1a, panels αToc159, αToc34, αOep37, lane 1 vs lane 2). Moreover, the abundance of all three proteins is comparable between chloroplasts and outer envelope (Fig. 1a, panels αToc159, αToc34, αOep37, lane 2 vs lane 4). This suggests that Hsp70 is only associated with but not inserted into the membrane and thus, a significant portion is lost during envelope purification. Similarly, the abundance of the intermembrane space protein Tic22 or of the stromal small subunit of RUBISCO (SSU) is enriched in chloroplasts (Fig. 1a, panels αTic22, αSSU, lane 1 vs lane 2). They are both protease resistant (Fig. 1a, lane 3), but they are not detectable in outer envelopes (Fig. 1a, panels αTic22, αSSU, lane 4). [[FIGURE]]  To exclude that Hsp70 is simply co-purified because of association with chloroplast, we investigated the distribution of actin. Actin is known to be associated with outer envelope proteins like the chloroplast unusual positioning 1 (CHUP1) (Schmidt von Braun and Schleiff CITATION) and even an association with the chloroplast translocon is proposed (Jouhet and Gray CITATION). We detected a large amount of actin in the cell lysate (Fig. 1a, panel αActin, lane 1). However, in contrast to Hsp70, we did not detect any actin in association with isolated chloroplasts or outer envelopes (Fig. 1a, lanes 2–5). This supports the specificity of the observed chloroplast localization of the cytosolic Hsp70. The initial results suggest that a chaperone known to be localized in the cytosol exists in chloroplasts as well. In addition, the observed outer envelope association suggests a localization of Hsp70 in the intermembrane space. To further support the latter notion, chloroplasts were isolated from pea leaves and treated with thermolysin prior to hypotonic lysis. The cytosolically exposed G-domain of Toc34 was protease sensitive as judged from the Western blot with an antibody specific for this domain (Fig. 1b, lane 4). In contrast, the Hsp70 detected with the antibody against cytosolic Hsp70 from tomato (αLpHsp70; (Neumann et al. CITATION) remained protease-resistant, irrespective of whether the soluble or the membrane-associated form is analyzed (Fig. 1b, lanes 2, 4). To confirm that the Hsp70 is not inherently thermolysin resistant, chloroplasts were incubated with thermolysin in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 1c). After addition of thermolysin, both membrane protected proteins, Tic22 and Hsp70, become protease accessible and are digested (Fig. 1c, lane 4), while Toc159 is accessible without Triton treatment as judged from the occurrence of the 52-kDa fragment (Fig. 1c, lane 3), and fully degraded in the presence of detergent (Fig. 1c, lane 4). As described before (e.g. Marshall et al. CITATION; Waegemann and Soll CITATION), we observed a soluble and a membrane-bound Hsp70 fraction. Sodium carbonate or urea treatment released all Hsp70 from the membrane, while Tic110 remained membrane bound (Fig. 1d, lanes 5–8). It is worth mentioning that salt treatment enforced an increased membrane association of Hsp70 and of the stromal prokaryotic-type Hsp70 (DnaK, Fig. 1d, lane 3, 4), which might be related to the association to partially unfolded membrane proteins. The same result is observed for Hsp70 associated with outer envelope vesicles (Fig. S1). Nevertheless, we conclude that the Hsp70 is partially soluble and partially membrane attached, but not membrane embedded. The association of imsHsp70 with the membrane is not nucleotide dependent (Fig. S1). To evaluate the localization of the Hsp70 in more detail we fractionated chloroplasts from P. sativum and M. sativa into outer and inner envelope, stroma and thylakoids (Fig. 1e). The fractions were highly enriched, but not entirely free of cross-contaminations as assayed by immunostaining of outer envelope proteins (Toc34, Toc64, outer envelope protein of 21 kDa; Oep21), inner envelope proteins (Tic110, Tic40), the stroma-localized large subunit of RUBISCO (LSU) and the thylakoid-localized light harvesting complex protein (LHCP). The Hsp70 detected with the αLpHsp70 antibody was most enriched in the outer envelope fraction when compared to inner envelope or stroma of P. sativum chloroplasts (Fig. 1e, top panel). We conclude that the membrane-associated Hsp70 is associated with the outer envelope and the soluble pool of Hsp70 is not localized in the stroma. The eukaryotic nature of the detected Hsp70 protein was supported by immunostaining of cytosolic, chloroplast, outer envelope and stromal fractions with additional antibodies against eukaryotic Hsp70 proteins, namely αC70 (Qbadou et al. 2005) and the commercial αSPA820 and αSPA817, which recognized Hsp70 proteins in all fractions except stroma (Fig. 1f). The stromal Hsp70 is detected only in chloroplast and the stromal fraction (Fig. 1g, lane 5) as determined by immunostaining with antibodies specific for DnaK-like proteins of prokaryotic origin. The protein is distinct from the mitochondrial DnaK-like Hsp70 as judged from migration behavior (Fig. 1g, lane 2 vs. 3). We used αLpHsp70 antibody for immunoprecipitation to further confirm the specificity (Fig. 1h). The soluble fraction after hypotonic lysis of pea chloroplasts was incubated with αLpHsp70 (Fig. 1h, lane 1, 2) or αDnaK (Fig. 1h, lane 3, 4) followed by immunoprecipitation The results show that the eukaryotic Hsp70 from lysates of pea chloroplasts was only immunoprecipitated by αLpHsp70 (Fig. 1h, lane 2), but not by αDnaK (Fig. 1h, lane 4), while DnaK cannot be immunoprecipitated by αLpHsp70 (Fig. 1h, lane 2). Thus, we provide evidence that the antibody used recognizes a protease-resistant (Fig. 1b) eukaryotic Hsp70 (Fig. 1f–h) that is not present in the stroma (Fig. 1e, f). To further support an IMS localization of the detected Hsp70 we analyzed the protease protection of Toc34, Oep21, Hsp70 and Tic22 in outer envelope vesicles (OEVs; Fig. 1i). Hsp70 and Tic22 are thermolysin resistant, while Toc34 and Oep21 are thermolysin sensitive. However, after membrane disruption by detergent treatment, Hsp70 and Tic22 become thermolysin sensitive (Fig. 1i, lane 5). This result together with the protease resistance in chloroplasts and the identified localization strongly suggests an IMS localization of the Hsp70 protein. We aimed to identify imsHsp70 from Medicago (Fig. 1e) because the genome of M. truncatula is sequenced (http://www.medicagohapmap.org/?genome). We treated intact chloroplasts of Medicago with thermolysin prior to hypotonic lysis (Fig. 2a). The efficiency and specificity of the protease treatment was confirmed by immunostaining of Toc34, Hsp93 and the large subunit of RUBSCO (LSU; Fig. 2a, lane 1–3). While the Hsp70, the stromal Hsp93 and LSU remained protease resistant, Toc34 was protease sensitive (Fig. 2a, lane 1–3 vs. lane 4–6). The protease was inactivated by chelating of calcium ions with EDTA. Subsequently, we performed the hypotonic swelling to release the content of the stroma and the IMS. This approach was rational as a eukaryotic Hsp70 is only present in the intermembrane space, but not in the stroma (Fig. 1). [[FIGURE]]  The soluble proteins were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2b; S2). We obtained fractions where the eukaryotic Hsp70 is enriched (Fig. S2). These fractions were pooled and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2c, d). The protein pattern was comparable between non-treated (Fig. 2c, panels 1, 2) and thermolysin-treated (Fig. 2d, panel 1) samples, and the migration of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic chaperones was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2c, panels 3, 4; Fig. 2d, panel 2). The protein bands indicated (Fig. 2c, panel 2; Fig. 2d, panel 1) were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Table S1). The protein bands migrating at higher molecular weight were not analyzed as the identification of the Hsp70 was in focus of our approach. As expected from the Western blot, the first protein band could clearly be assigned to DnaK-like chaperones, while the third band contained eukaryotic Hsp70 proteins. We noticed a contamination of band 3 by the stromal Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase 1 (e.g. Rutschow et al. CITATION), the protein which is migrating as band 4 (Table S1). Thus, to further purify the imsHsp70, the soluble fraction of chloroplasts after hypotonic lysis (Fig. 2e, panel 3) or the Hsp70-containing fractions obtained by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2e, panel 1, 2) were incubated with ATP-Sepharose. A significant portion of the Hsp70 was bound to the ATP-column (Fig. 2e, lane 5-7) and subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry (Table S1). This purification enabled the isolation of fractions exclusively containing eukaryotic Hsp70 proteins. Analyzing the eukaryotic Hsp70-containing fractions of the three independent approaches (Fig. 2e), several cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms were identified (Table S1). Although Hsp70 proteins share in general high sequence conservation, the detection of the different isoforms is supported by the identification of isoform-specific peptides (Table 1, Table S1, Fig. S3).[[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] The localization of M. truncatula cytosolic Hsp70 proteins (Fig. S4) was investigated in vivo using a transient expression system in tomato protoplasts. The localization of cytosolic Hsp70s was analyzed in A. thaliana protoplasts as well to generalize the findings. To judge the different possible intracellular localizations, the self-assembling GFP system (Cabantous et al. CITATION) established for the analysis of protein localization was employed (Machettira et al. CITATION). In the saGFP system, the eleven-stranded β-barrel of GFP is split into saGFP1-10, comprising β-strands 1-10 (GS1-10), and the very short saGFP11 fragment, containing only β-strand 11 of GFP (GS11). Fluorescent GFP assembles only when the two fragments are located in the same cellular sub-compartment (Gross et al. CITATION). We used different reporters to analyze the plastid localization of cytosolic Hsp70 proteins: the cytosol-localized GS1-10, the IMS-localized monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthase 1 fused to GS1-10 (MGD1-GS1-10, Benning and Ohta CITATION), the IMS-localized processing peptidase 1 fused to GS1-10 (SP1-GS1-10, Inoue et al. CITATION) and the stroma-localized small subunit of RUBSICO fused to GS1-10 (pSSU-GS1-10). The expressed constructs did not show fluorescence by themselves (not shown), while fusions of MGD1 and SP1 to full-length GFP yielded a fluorescence signature consistent with the IMS localization (Fig. S5; Gross et al. CITATION). The specificity of the two IMS localized saGFP reporters was tested by co-expression with the IMS-localized Tic22 fused to GS11. The co-expression resulted GFP signals in certain regions in case of MGD1 as marker and in ring-like GFP signals in case of SP1, both signals surrounding the auto-fluorescence, which is consistent with the IMS localization of the proteins (Fig. 3a). The difference in fluorescence distribution might result from different expression levels. To confirm that this GFP signal does not occur by trapping a translocation intermediate SP1-GS1-10 was co-expressed with pSSU-GS11, which resulted in no GFP fluorescence. Furthermore, the functionality of pSSU-GS11 was confirmed by co-expression with pSSU-GS1-10 resulting in stromal GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3b). Thus, translocation intermediates are not arrested as such that GFP can assemble. [[FIGURE]]  Next we co-expressed the four established markers with a M. truncatula Hsp70 fused to GS11 (Medtr7g024580-GS11). GFP fluorescence was observed when co-expressing the cytosolic and both IMS marker proteins, but not with the stromal marker (Fig. 3c). The detailed inspection revealed that co-expression of MGD1-GS1-10 with Medtr7g024580-GS11 yielded a rim like structure (Fig. 3c, bottom left), while co-expression of SP1-GS1-10 with Medtr7g024580-GS11 resulted in GFP-fluorescence in certain areas (Fig. 3c, bottom right). Thus, on the one hand we confirm the cytosolic localization of the Hsp70 and on the other hand we show the GFP assembly with the IMS marker. The differential structuring of the GFP signal with the two different IMS marker proteins might reflect that one is membrane localized (MGD1) and the other (SP1) soluble in the IMS. Thus, it is possible that the latter tends to aggregation leading to the punctured structure. However, the occurrence of the GFP signal demonstrates the IMS localization. At the same time we could not confirm a stromal localization of a eukaryotic Hsp70 (Ratnayake et al. CITATION). In addition, the absence of fluorescence when co-expressing Medtr7g024580-GS11 and pSSU-GS1-10 confirms that GFP is not assembled by formation of targeting complexes because pSSU was found to be associated with Hsp70 (May and Soll CITATION). To support the finding of multiple Hsp70 proteins in the IMS, the other three identified cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms of M. truncatula (Table S1) fused to GS11 were co-expressed with the IMS marker protein SP1-GS1-10. Similar to Medtr7g024580-GS11, we observed a chloroplasts-surrounding GFP fluorescence for these proteins (Fig. 3d). In contrast, co-expression of the GS11 fused Hsp70 homologs with pSSU-GS1-10 did not yield a fluorescence signal (not shown). In line with the mass spectrometry findings, the obtained results indicate that a portion of multiple cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones of M. truncatula is localized in the IMS of chloroplasts. The observations presented (Fig. 3) point toward a localization of cytosolic Hsp70 in the IMS. To evaluate whether this is a general concept in plants the cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms 1, 2, 3 and 5 of A. thaliana fused to GS11 were co-expressed with SP1-GS1-10. We observed a ring-like GFP fluorescence surrounding the chloroplasts for all cases (Fig. 4a; Fig. S6), and fluorescence was specific for chloroplasts as judged by lysis of protoplasts (Fig. 4b). As for Hsp70 from M. truncatula, GFP fluorescence was not observed when Hsp70s from A. thaliana fused to GS11 were co-expressed with pSSU-GS1-10 (Fig. 4a and data not shown). [[FIGURE]]  Our results so far suggest that targeting of plant cytosolic Hsp70 proteins to the IMS of chloroplasts is a general phenomenon. To confirm that the result is specific for chloroplasts we probed for localization of eukaryotic Hsp70s in the IMS of mitochondria. The GS1-10 was targeted to the IMS of mitochondria by a fusion to the IMS-facing region of Tim50 (Fig. 4a). The specificity of this reporter was confirmed by co-expression with the IMS-localized Tim9 fused to GS11 (Gross et al. CITATION), which resulted in a punctuated pattern of GFP fluorescence indicative of mitochondria (Fig. 4a, right). However, when cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones of A. thaliana were co-expressed with Tim50-GS1-10 GFP fluorescence could not be observed (Fig. 4a). This suggests that cytosolic Hsp70s are not localized in mitochondrial IMS. Thus, the localization in the chloroplast IMS is specific. In addition to Hsp70 also Hsp90 was found to be involved in cytosolic preprotein targeting and in the stromal translocation process (Qbadou et al. CITATION; Inoue et al. CITATION). Therefore, we analyzed whether eukaryotic Hsp90s are localized in the IMS of chloroplasts as well. Co-expression of Hsp90 fused to GS11 with GS1-10 confirms the cytoplasmic localization of the protein (Fig. 4c). In contrast, co-expression of Hsp90-GS11 (Fig. 4c) with SP1-GS1-10 did not result in GFP fluorescence. The absence of Hsp90 in the IMS of chloroplasts confirms that only the eukaryotic Hsp70 is localized in the IMS.
!~MM~! Constructs have been generated as previously described (Gross et al. CITATION; Sommer et al. CITATION, CITATION).Corresponding amplified cDNA-fragments of Hsp70 isoforms of A. thaliana and M. truncatula were inserted into pAVA vectors containing strand 11 of saGFP at the 3´ position (Gross et al. CITATION). Plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 PLSP1, abbreviated in here as SP1; At3G24590) and the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase 1 (MGD1) fused to saGFP1-10 or GFP were generated as described (Bullmann et al. CITATION). pML94-GFP (Bionda et al. CITATION) was used for the generation of C-terminal fusions of GFP to Hsp70 proteins. Sterile tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker; Tomato Genetics Resource Center, University of California, Davis, USA) and Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia; Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA) plants were grown on gelrite-solidified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 30 or 20 g/L sucrose, respectively. Tomato and A. thaliana leaf mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from 4- to 6 week-old plants and transformed using the polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation protocol (Mishra et al. CITATION; Sommer et al. CITATION). 105 protoplasts were transformed with 20 µg plasmid DNA; if necessary, the final amount of DNA was adjusted by addition of the plasmid pRT-Neo (Tillmann et al. CITATION). For saGFP co-expression analysis, 10 µg of plasmid DNA per construct was used. Cells were incubated in light for 12 h at 26 °C. Intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins in protoplasts was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope with a HCX PL APO lambda blue 63 × NA 1.4 oil objective as in (Bionda et al. CITATION). GFP and chlorophyll fluorescence were excited at 488 nm. The emission of GFP and Alexa488 was recorded at 495–540 nm. Polyclonal antibodies against chloroplast proteins and against the C-terminus of human Hsp70 (αC70) were raised as in (Vojta et al. CITATION). The antibody against Solanum peruvianum (formerly Lycopersicon peruvianum) Hsp70 (αLpHsp70) was described (Neumann et al. CITATION). Monoclonal antibodies against human cytosolic Hsp70 (αSPA820) and spinach Hsc70 (αSPA817) were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Lörrach, Germany). The antibody against DnaK of E. coli was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hartl (MPI Martinsried, Germany). Polyclonal αGFP was supplied by Rockland (Limerick, PA, USA). The other used antibodies against Toc64, Toc75, Toc34, Toc159, Tic110, Tic40, Tic22, the outer envelope protein of 21 kDa (Oep21), the outer envelope protein of 37 kDa (Oep37), the large subunit of RUBISCO (LSU), the light harvesting complex protein (LHCP) and Hsp93 have been described (Schleiff et al. CITATION; Becker et al. CITATION; Elkehal et al. CITATION and references therein). Intact chloroplasts from P. sativum and M. sativa (Weigelt GmbH & Co. E.E. KG, Walluf, Germany) were isolated from 7- to 9 day-old and 15- to 20-day-old seedlings, respectively, grown on vermiculite, according to described procedures (Schleiff et al. CITATION; Bionda and Schleiff CITATION). Outer and inner envelope membranes from P. sativum and M. sativa were isolated from plants grown on vermiculite for 9–11 and 16–20 days, respectively (Schleiff et al. CITATION). Mitochondria were isolated as described (Rödiger et al. CITATION).  Cell fractionation was performed by differential centrifugation of cell extracts from 10- to 12-day-old P. sativum seedlings (Becker et al. CITATION). Subfractionation of chloroplasts was carried out as established for the isolation of envelope vesicles (Schleiff et al. CITATION). Mitochondria were isolated as in Rödiger et al. (CITATION).  Protein extraction: Chloroplasts (50 μg chlorophyll content) were incubated in (1) 1 M NaCl, (2) 100 mM Na2CO3 pH 11.5; (3) in 10 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 6 M urea for 30 min at 4 °C or (4) 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6 for 20 min at RT followed by centrifugation (265,000g, 10 min, 4 °C). Extraction of envelope vesicles (20 μg protein content) was performed as above by incubation for 20 min at RT. Intact chloroplasts were lysed in 20 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.4 and 5 mM EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation (100,000g, 10 min, 4 °C). Soluble fractions were supplemented with 10 % (v/v) glycerol, frozen in liquid N2, stored at −80 °C and used for the purification of imsHsp70. Outer envelope vesicles (20 μg protein) were incubated with indicated amounts of thermolysin in 25 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2 (20 min, 4 °C) in the absence or presence of 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mM EDTA and vesicles were recovered by centrifugation (265,000g, 10 min, 4 °C). Intact chloroplasts were washed with 25 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2 and treated as above with 1 μg thermolysin per 1 μg chlorophyll. For mass spectrometry, intact chloroplasts (200 µg of chlorophyll) were incubated in 50 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 330 mM sorbitol, 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 200 μg thermolysin (20 min, 4 °C). The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mM EDTA. After incubation for 5 min at 4 °C, intact chloroplasts were purified through 40 % Percoll cushion containing 5 mM EDTA (3025g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed and hypotonically lysed. The soluble fraction of P. sativum and M. sativa chloroplasts (20 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 10 % glycerol) was diluted 1:1 in 20 mM Hepes 7.4 and 200 mM KCl and applied to an anion-exchange column (MonoQ HR 5/5, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with five column volumes of E-buffer (20 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 % (v/v) glycerol at 4 °C. After washing with two column volumes of E-buffer, proteins were eluted using a gradient from 100 mM to 1 M KCl in 20 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.4, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 % (v/v) glycerol (twenty column volumes). The elution profile was monitored at 280 nm and the protein content in the fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. ATP–affinity chromatography was performed using N6-(6-Amino)hexyl-ATP-Sepharose (Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany) at 4 °C following the manufacturer´s recommendations. In brief, MonoQ-separated fractions containing imsHsp70 or the soluble extract of hypotonically lysed chloroplasts were incubated with 50 µL of pre-equilibrated ATP-Sepharose matrices (3 h, 4 °C, constant rotation). The flow-through was removed (1000g, 1 min) and beads were washed 3× with 10 column volumes of ice-cold wash buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with E-buffer. The protein content of the fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and colloidal Coomassie (G-250) staining. The excision of proteins from SDS-PAGE, the preparation of the samples and the mass spectrometry analyses were performed as in (Ladig et al. CITATION) using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF from AB SCIEX. MS/MS data sets were processed using the Data Explorer v4.8 software (Applied Biosystems). The peptide sequence query search of M. truncatula database Mt3.5 was carried out for each spot using Mascot v2.2 (Matrix Science Ltd, Elgin, SC, USA). Ion score significance threshold was at a default setting of 0.05.
