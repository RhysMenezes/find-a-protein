!~ABS~! Vitamin B6 represents a highly important group of compounds ubiquitous in all living organisms. It has been demonstrated to alleviate oxidative stress and in its phosphorylated form participates as a cofactor in >100 biochemical reactions. By means of a genetic approach, we have identified a novel mutant, rsr4-1 (for reduced sugar response), with aberrant root and leaf growth that requires supplementation of vitamin B6 for normal development. Cloning of the mutated gene revealed that rsr4-1 carries a point mutation in a member of the PDX1/SOR1/SNZ (for Pyridoxine biosynthesis protein 1/Singlet oxygen resistant 1/Snooze) family that leads to reduced vitamin B6 content. Consequently, metabolism is broadly altered, mainly affecting amino acid, raffinose, and shikimate contents and trichloroacetic acid cycle constituents. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down analyses showed that Arabidopsis thaliana PDX1 proteins can form oligomers. Interestingly, the mutant form of PDX1 has severely reduced capability to oligomerize, potentially suggesting that oligomerization is important for function. In summary, our results demonstrate the critical function of the PDX1 protein family for metabolism, whole-plant development, and vitamin B6 biosynthesis in higher plants.
!~RES~! rsr4-1 plants display several prominent aerial and root phenotypes. Flowering time under long-day conditions (16 h light) was delayed, in comparison with wild-type C24 plants (Figure 2C ), but mutant plants displayed no change in leaf number at the time of flowering, with an average of 22 rosette leaves (data not shown). However, leaf size was reduced in the mutant, resulting in decreased rosette growth and reduced fresh weight (Figure 2E). rsr4-1 develops yellowish leaves due to an ∼25% reduction of chlorophyll content (Figure 2D). The most striking change in rsr4-1 mutants was a strong reduction in primary root growth in sterile culture on minimal medium (Figures 2F to 2H). Surprisingly, addition of different vitamins to the medium revealed that this phenotype was fully complemented by the provision of pyridoxine to the mutant. This effect was specific to pyridoxine since all other vitamins tested were ineffective in complementing the mutant's root growth (Figure 2H). Likewise, additions of sugar (100 mM glucose and 60 mM sucrose) were also ineffective in reverting the phenotype (data not shown). Interestingly, addition of the different vitamin B6 vitamers to the growth medium revealed that PL was most effective in normalizing rsr4-1 root growth, whereas PLP was ineffective (Figure 2I). The presence of PL in the medium also complemented the aerial phenotypes of reduced leaf growth and bleaching (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] The short root phenotype of rsr4-1 was accompanied by early development of lateral roots, often at the base of the hypocotyl (Figure 2K). In the absence of vitamin B6, we also observed that lateral roots frequently initiated closer to each other in comparison with the wild type (Figures 2K and 2L). Another pyridoxine mutant that was recently described is sos4, which is affected in a pyridoxine kinase (CITATION). Like rsr4-1, the sos4 mutation is recessive and leads to reduced root elongation (CITATION). However, crossing of rsr4-1 with sos4 resulted in complementation of the root elongation growth in the F1 generation, demonstrating that the mutants are affected at different loci (Figure 2J). sos4 mutants also displayed defects in root hair development (CITATION). Comparison of rsr4-1 with sos4 showed that rsr4-1 had no obvious defects in root hair development, further underscoring the difference between the two mutants (Figure 2K). In addition, sos4 is hypersensitive to salt stress (CITATION), whereas we could not observe changed salt sensitivities for rsr4-1 mutants (data not shown). To analyze the nature and location of the mutated locus within the Arabidopsis genome, a cross between rsr4-1 and Columbia-0 (Col-0) was performed. In the F1 generation, 50 tested plants showed a clear loss of the vitamin B6 dependence, with all plants developing long roots in the absence of the vitamin (data not shown). The short root phenotype segregated in the F2 generation in a 3:1 pattern. From 249 plants, 183 developed a normal root compared with 66 plants with a short root (χ2 = 0.301; χ2 test with one degree of freedom), thus indicating that the pyridoxine-dependent phenotype of rsr4-1 is recessive. To identify the mutated locus in rsr4-1, 55 F2 plants with short roots were selected for a rough mapping approach using cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and simple sequence length polymorphic (SSLP) markers as described by CITATION. The mutated locus was mapped to the upper arm of chromosome 5 with closest coupling to SSLP markers CTR1,2 (979,763 bp) and nga158 (1,698,614 bp) (Table 1 ). The use of a new CAPS marker located 506,908 bp below the top of chromosome 5 showed that the number of recombinants was lower at this position in comparison with nga158 (Table 1). Based on Kosambi's map function (CITATION), we calculated the position of RSR4 to be within an area of ∼8 centimorgans from the very top of chromosome 5. Mapping Data for RSR4 Since rsr4-1 requires pyridoxine for normal growth, it appears to be highly likely that the mutant is affected in biosynthesis of this vitamin. One of the PDX1 genes, PDX1.3, is located on the upper arm of chromosome 5 within the area we identified in our rough mapping approach. Sequencing of the corresponding PDX1.3 open reading frames from C24 wild type and rsr4-1 led to the identification of a point mutation at position 162 from G to A in rsr4-1. This mutation caused an amino acid exchange from Gly to Ser (PDX1.3G54S) (Figure 3A ). Unfortunately, it remains unclear what the effect of the mutation is on the protein conformation since structural data from members of the PDX1 family are not available. Using the NNPREDICT program (CITATION), an α-helix is predicted in this area, but no obvious changes appeared to be induced by the mutation. [[FIGURE]] To confirm that the mutation found in PDX1.3 is responsible for the rsr4-1 mutant phenotype, we first tried to ectopically express a PDX1.3 cDNA in the rsr4-1 background. Unfortunately, despite several attempts, we obtained only very low transformation efficiency of the mutant, and among the few plants we did obtain, we did not isolate complemented mutants. Alternatively, to corroborate that the PDX1.3G54S mutation is responsible for the rsr4-1 mutant phenotype, an allelism test was performed in which rsr4-1 was crossed into a pdx1.3 T-DNA insertion mutant. For this cross, a T-DNA insertion mutant from the SALK center annotated as SALK_086418 was used (CITATION; CITATION). In this mutant, the insertion was located 270 bp downstream of the ATG and led to a complete loss in PDX1.3 expression (Figures 3B and 3C). RT-PCR analysis on C24 and rsr4-1 revealed that the mutation had no impact on PDX1.3G54S expression since expression was invariant in the mutant and wild type. The pdx1.3 mutant showed a weak bleaching of the leaves (data not shown) and, like rsr4-1, a shorter, pyridoxine-dependent root growth (Figure 3D). For allelism testing, the short root phenotype of both mutants was employed. To exclude heterotic effects, the parental ecotypes (Col-0 and C24) were additionally crossed in parallel. Analyses of the F1 generation revealed that the mutant cross displayed shorter roots than the control C24 × Col-0 wild-type cross, and this difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05 for the mutant compared with the wild-type cross; Student's t test) (Figures 3E and 3F), demonstrating that the mutants were allelic to one another. These results confirm that the mutation in PDX1.3 (further denoted as PDX1.3/RSR4) is indeed responsible for the rsr4-1 mutant phenotype. To further analyze changes in rsr4-1, contents of the different vitamin B6 vitamers were measured in rosette leaves from mutant and wild-type plants. PN content in both wild-type and mutant plants was very low and only detectable in one of the three samples analyzed (Table 2 , first column). The second derivative, PM, was also low in content, but unlike PN, clearly detectable. Although the amount of PM varied between the different samples (Table 2, second column), no significant changes were detectable between the wild type and rsr4-1. Determination of PL content revealed this to be the most abundant of the three vitamin B6 derivatives. Interestingly, PL content was significantly altered in the mutant (Table 2, third column), being reduced in rsr4-1 to 37% of the level found in C24. This finding is important since it demonstrates that the mutation in rsr4-1 negatively affected vitamin B6 biosynthesis. Measurements of PN, PM, and PL Contents in Rosette Leaves from 3-Week-Old Soil-Grown Plants PL is the precursor for PLP, which is a key compound for several steps in amino acid metabolism. To investigate whether the reduced PL content in rsr4-1 negatively affected metabolism, we performed metabolite analysis paying special attention to amino acid biosynthesis in rosette leaves from wild-type and mutant plants. The levels for many of the amino acids detected were increased in rsr4-1, even those that require PLP-dependent enzyme activities for their biosynthesis, such as Ile and Asp (Figure 4A ; see Supplemental Table 1 online). It is also noteworthy that constituents of the TCA cycle, such as malate, citrate, and fumarate, were highly upregulated (Figure 4B) and that shikimate, a key compound in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, was significantly reduced. Finally, relatively few changes in carbohydrate content were observed in the mutant, with the most marked change being the increased levels of the trisaccharide raffinose in the mutant (Figure 4C). Taken together, these metabolite data do not support the hypothesis that reduced vitamin B6 content correlates with reduction in amino acid biosynthesis. They do, however, reveal that changes in pyridoxine homeostasis have a broad effect on the plant metabolism and underscore the importance of vitamin B6 for metabolism in general. [[FIGURE]] CITATION showed earlier that a PDX1 homolog from Cercospora nicotianae can functionally complement a pyridoxine auxotroph pdxJ E. coli mutant. A similar approach was followed to determine enzymatic functioning of PDX1.3/RSR4 and its mutated form from Arabidopsis. Here, both PDX1.3/RSR4 and PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S cDNAs were cloned into the isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG)–inducible E. coli expression vector pCRT7/N and used for complementation analysis of a pdxJ19 E. coli mutant. Growth of the pdxJ19 mutant was optically measured at λ = 600 nm for 30 h and compared with the growth of a pdxJ19 mutant transformed with PDX1.3/RSR4, PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S, and a pdxJ expression construct in the presence or absence of PL. Figure 5A shows that the pdxJ19 mutant only grew in medium supplemented with PL. By contrast, IPTG-induced expression of both PdxJ and PDX1.3/RSR4 allowed growth of the pdxJ19 strain in PL-free medium, demonstrating complementation of the pdxJ19 mutant and participation of PDX1.3/RSR4 in vitamin B6 biosynthesis. In addition, these results confirm the ability of members of the PDX1 family to functionally complement mutations in a gene of unrelated sequence involved in pyridoxine synthesis through a different pathway. In comparison, the mutated PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S protein was not capable of complementing the pdxJ19 strain, which indicates that PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S is a nonfunctional protein with respect to vitamin B6 biosynthesis (Figure 5A), and this finding is consistent with the defects observed in the rsr4-1 mutant. [[FIGURE]] It was previously described that the yeast PDX1 homolog Snz1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae assembles into dimers and higher-order protein complexes (CITATION). For this reason, we tested interaction of all Arabidopsis PDX1 proteins and the mutated PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S. The different PDX1 genes were cloned in yeast two-hybrid vectors for interaction analysis. As shown in Figure 5B, PDX1.3/RSR4 assembled with a second PDX1.3 protein but was also able to interact with PDX1.1 and PDX1.2 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Comparable interaction patterns we observed for PDX1.1 and PDX1.2 in yeast (data not shown). PDX1.1 and PDX1.3/RSR4 could also assemble with PDX2, the second subunit of PLP synthase. Here, it is noteworthy that PDX1.2 did not assemble with PDX2. This finding is critical since CITATION reported that PDX1.1 and PDX1.3 but not PDX1.2 possess PLP biosynthetic activity. Finally, PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S completely failed to interact in the yeast assays with PDX1 and PDX2 proteins (Figure 5B). To consolidate the data from the yeast two-hybrid experiments, pull-down assays were performed with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and in vitro–translated and [35S]-Met–labeled proteins. As a first approach, we tested in vitro–translated PDX1.1, PDX1.2, and PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S for interaction with GST fusion proteins. However, all proteins except for PDX1.2 bound unspecifically to GST and glutathione beads (data not shown). We therefore decided to focus on in vitro–translated PDX1.2 and to combine this PDX1 protein with affinity-purified GST and GST fusion proteins from E. coli. As shown in Figures 5C and 5D, GST:PDX1.3/RSR4 interacted with in vitro–translated PDX1.2, whereas the GST control did not. By contrast, hardly any interaction between PDX1.3G54S/RSR4G54S and PDX1.2 was detectable. Finally, both GST:PDX1.1 and GST:PDX1.2 assembled with in vitro–translated PDX1.2, but GST:PDX2 did not. In summary, these results indicate that PDX1 proteins function in variable protein complexes and demonstrate that replacement of a single residue in PDX1.3 has a profound effect on complex formation. Based on the high homology between PDX1.1 and PDX1.3/RSR4, their ability to dimerize with each other and with PDX2, and their participation in PLP biosynthesis (CITATION), we next asked whether PDX1.1 and PDX1.3/RSR4 are functionally redundant in planta. We used an antisense approach against PDX1.1 to address this question. For this purpose, a 464-bp C-terminal fragment of PDX1.1 was cloned in antisense orientation into the binary vector pCB302-3 (CITATION). Introduction of the construct into Col-0 wild-type plants resulted in 20 out of 86 of the primary transformants displaying yellowish leaves and shorter roots (Figure 6A ), with this phenotype correlating reduced PDX1.1 gene expression (Figure 6B). Most importantly, PDX1.1 antisense lines generated a reduced and pyridoxine-dependent root growth comparable to rsr4-1 (Figure 6C). Intriguingly, the antisense effect was largely specific to PDX1.1 since PDX1.3/RSR4 expression was only slightly reduced in the antisense plants (Figure 6B). The pyridoxine-dependent root growth and appearance of yellowish leaves of the PDX1.1 antisense plants demonstrate overlapping functions of PDX1.1 and PDX1.3/RSR4 and are in keeping with the results of CITATION, in suggesting that both proteins participate in vitamin B6 biosynthesis in planta. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the effect of PDX1.3/RSR4 overexpression on plant development, we introduced a GFP:PDX1.3/RSR4 expression construct under the control of a 35S promoter (further referred to as 35S:GFP:PDX1.3) into Col-0 wild-type plants. Most of the resultant transformants displayed normal wild type–like growth. In these wild type–like plants, expression of GFP:PDX1.3/RSR4 was easily detectable (Figure 6E, 35S:GFP:PDX1.3-9 and 35S:GFP:PDX1.3-19), suggesting that overexpression of PDX1.3/RSR4 has no major impact on the plant. However, ∼20% of transformants were dramatically affected in growth: they had only very few, yellowish, and distorted rosette leaves (Figure 6D) and either died prior to the development of inflorescences (Figure 6D, 35S:GFP:PDX1.3-5 and -8) or generated small flowers that produced no seeds (Figure 6D, 35S:GFP:PDX1.3-4). It is important to note that the phenotypes were much stronger than the ones we found for rsr4-1 and apdx1.3 plants. Since we did not detect GFP:PDX1.3/RSR4 in these plants (Figure 6E, 35S:GFP:PDX1.3-5, -8, and -4), we assumed that introduction of the 35S:GFP:PDX1.3 construct led to cosuppression of both PDX1.1 and PDX1.3/RSR4. As shown in Figure 6E, RT-PCR analysis on wild-type and transgenic plants revealed that the aberrant growth clearly correlated with a reduced expression of both PDX1 genes, whereas no change was detectable for the plants expressing GFP:PDX1.3/RSR4 protein. To examine in which tissues the different members of the PDX1 family and PDX2 are expressed, RT-PCR and PDX1 promoter:GUS analysis were performed. As shown in Figure 7A , PDX1.3/RSR4 is expressed in flowers, shoots, and leaves but only very weakly in root tissue. This was surprising since the most striking phenotype of rsr4-1 was root related. A similar expression pattern was observed for PDX1.1, whereas PDX1.2 showed low expression in shoot and leaf, with clearly stronger expression in flower and root. In comparison, PDX2 was strongly expressed in all tissues examined. [[FIGURE]] For more detailed description of the PDX1 expression patterns, the different promoters of PDX1.1 (1511 bp), PDX1.2 (1808 bp), and PDX1.3/RSR4 (1136 bp) were cloned in front of a GUS reporter gene. As expected, promoter:GUS lines from PDX1.1 and PDX1.3/RSR4 (further referred to as proPDX1.1:GUS and proPDX1.3:GUS, respectively) had overlapping expression patterns being highly active in leaves and only weakly so in roots. However, proPDX1.1:GUS lines showed staining in tips of primary and lateral roots (Figure 7D), a pattern that was not observed in the proPDX1.3:GUS lines (Figure 7R). Another difference in expression was present in flowers and siliques: proPDX1.1:GUS lines showed a strong dot-like staining in pistils (Figure 7F). Furthermore, at young silique stages (∼5 d after pollination), strong staining in the endosperm was detectable in proPDX1.1:GUS lines, with no staining present in the embryo (Figure 7H). At later stages when seeds were fully developed, staining was restricted to the surrounding mantle tissue of the siliques (Figure 7I). In comparison, proPDX1.3:GUS lines showed strong staining in anthers and sepals (Figures 7J and 7K). Furthermore, proPDX1.3:GUS lines showed GUS expression only at the top and base of differentiated siliques, with no staining detectable in the seeds at all stages (Figure 7L). In proPDX1.2:GUS seedlings, a weak expression was present in the leaf vascular tissue (Figure 7S). Hardly any staining was detectable in differentiated leaves where GUS staining only appeared in the central vein and similarly weak; in flowers, we observed GUS expression only in the pistil (Figure 7U). Most interestingly, in the proPDX1.2:GUS lines was a root tip–specific expression pattern: in emerging root buds, only the very tip showed GUS expression (data not shown), whereas in older roots, a second area appeared, shortly after the root tip, that showed strong GUS expression (Figure 7V).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes C24 and Col-0 were grown in a greenhouse under standard conditions and in tissue culture on solid MS medium (CITATION). For root elongation growth assays, vitamins were supplemented to the medium (2.43 μM PN, PM, PL, or PLP, 2.5 μM biotine, 0.3 μM thiamine, 560 μM myo-inositol, and 4.06 μM nicotinic acid; Sigma-Aldrich) as recommended by CITATION. rsr4-1 was backcrossed twice into C24 to eliminate secondary mutations and to outcross the Pat(B33)-GUS transgene prior to performance of phenotypical and physiological analysis. Plants were transformed using an Agrobacterium tumfaciens–mediated transfer protocol according to CITATION. For map-based cloning of RSR4, F2 plants derived from a cross between rsr4-1 and Arabidopsis Col-0 were selected for reduced root growth on MS medium without PL. Genomic DNA was isolated by standard techniques and used for SSLP- and CAPS-based mapping of the mutated loci as described earlier (CITATION). PCR products for the CAPS marker were directly digested with KpnI to detect polymorphism. For primer sequences used in this and following sections, see Supplemental Table 2 online. PDX1.3/RSR4 promoter and full-length PDX1 open reading frames were amplified from genomic DNA. The PDX1.3/RSR4 promoter (1136 bp upstream from PDX1.3/RSR4 ATG) was cloned into the BamHI-XbaI sites of the binary vector pCB308 (CITATION). For antisense constructs, PDX1.3/RSR4 open reading frames in the suitable orientation were cut out with SacI-EcoRV and cloned into the SacI-SmaI sites of the binary vector pCB302-3 (CITATION). For expression in Escherichia coli, PDX1.3/RSR4 and PDX1.3/RSR4G54S were cloned into pCRT7/N (Invitrogen). PdxJ from E. coli was cloned into a modified pACS1 vector (Clontech). For GST fusion constructs, full-length cDNAs were cloned into the GATEWAY-compatible pDEST15 expression vector. GFP construct was generated in binary vector pK7FWG2 (CITATION). All clones were fully sequenced and controlled for correct sequence and orientation before use in the different assays. For complementation analysis, an E. coli pdxJ19 mutant (http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu:80/cgi-bin/sybgw/cgsc/Strain/11585; CITATION) was used. For assays, the pdxJ19 mutant was transformed with either wild-type pdxJ from E. coli or PDX1.3/RSR4 and PDX1.3/RSR4G54S from Arabidopsis. The different strains were grown overnight in 100 mL of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with PL (0.5 μM) and thiamine (1 μg/mL). One milliliter of the overnight cultures was added to 100 mL of M9 minimal medium (CITATION) supplemented with 0.3 mM IPTG (Sigma-Aldrich) and thiamine (1 μg/mL). Only in the case of untransformed pdxJ19 mutant was M9 culture medium supplemented with PL (0.5 μM) to control growth in parallel to a pdxJ19 culture without PL. Growth at 37°C over 30 h was optically quantified at λ = 600 nm with a Kontron Uvicon 860 photometer. Extraction of vitamin B6 was performed following a modified procedure described by CITATION using 25 g of rosette leaves from 21-d-old soil-grown C24 and rsr4-1 plants. The content of B6 vitamers was analyzed according to a modified HPLC procedure described earlier (CITATION). Each of the three samples was measured twice to assure for correct quantification of B6 vitamers. For determination of metabolite content, an established gas chromatography–mass spectrometry procedure (CITATION; CITATION) that had been adopted for Arabidopsis tissues (CITATION) was used. For this purpose, rosette leaves (100 mg fresh weight) were harvested from 21-d-old soil-grown Arabidopsis plants. Having confirmed that the absolute values determined by this method were comparable with those previously recorded in Arabidopsis using other published methods (CITATION), it was decided to present data as relative values with respect to the wild-type control as described by CITATION. For chlorophyll quantification, rosette leaves (200 mg fresh weight) from 30-d-old plants cultured in soil were ground in liquid nitrogen, and carotenoids and chlorophyll a/b were extracted twice with 80% acetone. Pigment content was immediately photometrically measured under dimmed light conditions and quantified according to CITATION. For tissue-specific expression analysis of PDX1.3/RSR4G54S and PDX1.3/RSR4 null mutants, 4-week-old, flowering, soil-grown plants were used. For RT-PCR analysis, RNA was isolated using a plant RNA isolation kit (Macherey and Nagel). RT-PCR was done using gene-specific primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online) and a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). For RNA gel blot analysis, RNA isolation, hybridization, and signal detection were done using standard techniques. The 5′- and 3′-untranslated areas of PDX1.3/RSR4 and PDX1.1 were used alongside the primers mentioned above for RT-PCR analysis to allow specific hybridization. A lexA-based yeast two-hybrid system was used as described by CITATION with pBTM116-D9 (kindly provided by Erich Wanker) as bait plasmid and pACT2 (Clontech; GenBank accession no. U29899) as prey plasmid. Both vectors were modified with a GATEWAY cassette (Invitrogen). cDNAs of PDX1 and PDX2 genes were cloned into pDONR221 (Invitrogen) and subsequently introduced into pBTM116-D9 and pACT2. For yeast two-hybrid assays, yeast cells were transformed with bait and prey plasmid constructs as described before (CITATION). Cells were grown on synthetic dextrose (SD) minimal medium (CITATION) supplemented with Leu and His (SDII). Selected colonies were diluted 1:2000 in autoclaved distilled water before transfer to SD minimal medium without supplements (SDIV) for control of interaction. Photographs of single drops from diluted colonies were taken 3 d after transfer. In vitro–translated PDX1.2 and PDX2 were synthesized with the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using l-[35S] trans-labeled Met (Amersham). For pull-down assays from reticulolysate, PDX1.2 and PDX2 were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with GST, GST:PDX1.1, GST:PDX1.2, GST:PDX1.3, GST:PDX1.3G54S, and GST:PDX2. Binding assays and washings were done in standard buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and as described before (CITATION). Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Products were detected by autoradiography. Protein extraction and GFP immunodetection were done as described before (CITATION) using a GFP antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-8334). For detection of GUS expression, seedlings and different tissues were incubated up to 24 h in GUS staining solution at 37°C according to CITATION. Pictures were taken with an Olympus C-4040 zoom digital camera mounted on a SZX12 stereomicroscope (Olympus) or an Axioskop 2 plus microscope (Zeiss). Determination of vitamin B6 was performed following a modified procedure described by CITATION. In detail, 25 g (fresh weight) of rosette material of 3-week-old soil-grown Arabidopsis C24 wild type and rsr4-1 mutant plants were powdered in liquid nitrogen and suspended in 45 mL of 0.1 M HCl. The suspension was boiled for 30 min at 120°C in a pressure cooker. After centrifugation of the suspension for 30 min at 15,000g, the supernatant was filled up to 50 mL with 0.1 M HCl. For quantitative analysis of the three vitamin B6 derivatives, the pH of this extract was adjusted to 4.8, and a volume of 12.5 mL was further subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by adding 2 mg of acid phosphatase and 15 mg of β-glucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich) solved in a total volume of 2 mL. This solution was gently shaken at 37°C in a water bath for 18 h. The pH was then adjusted to 3.0, and the solution was boiled for 15 min at 100°C to stop the enzymatic reaction. After centrifugation at 15,000g for 30 min, the supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis or to a qualitative bioassay as described below. Control reactions with standards of the phosphorylated B6 vitamers showed that under the applied conditions the enzymatic hydrolysis was quantitative. Note that the weight of the starting material of Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant rosettes was exactly equal and that the extraction procedure was performed in parallel in exactly the same manner. The content of B6 vitamers PN, PL, and PM was determined according to a modified procedure described earlier (CITATION). As eluents, solvents A (13 mM trifluoric acid), B (0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0), and C (0.5 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6) were used running a ternary gradient as follows: elution was started with 100% solvent A (0 to 15 min), increasing buffer B from 0 to 100% (15 to 20 min), followed by an increase of buffer C from 0 to 100% (25 to 30 min). After elution, the column was reconditioned with 100% A (35 to 45 min). Pyridoxine-hydrochloride, pyridoxal-hydrochloride, and PM dihydrochloride (Fluka) served as standards.
