!~ABS~! Leaf size and shape are mainly determined by coordinated cell division and differentiation in lamina. The CINCINNATA (CIN)-like TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors are key regulators of leaf development. However, the mechanisms that control TCP activities during leaf development are largely unknown. We identified the TCP Interactor containing EAR motif protein1 (TIE1), a novel transcriptional repressor, as a major modulator of TCP activities during leaf development. Overexpression of TIE1 leads to hyponastic and serrated leaves, whereas disruption of TIE1 causes epinastic leaves. TIE1 is expressed in young leaves and encodes a transcriptional repressor containing a C-terminal EAR motif, which mediates interactions with the TOPLESS (TPL)/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPR) corepressors. In addition, TIE1 physically interacts with CIN-like TCPs. We propose that TIE1 regulates leaf size and morphology by inhibiting the activities of TCPs through recruiting the TPL/TPR corepressors to form a tertiary complex at early stages of leaf development.
!~RES~! We previously identified and characterized mutants with curly leaves from a collection of activation tagged Arabidopsis mutants (CITATION; CITATION). In the present study, an additional curly leaf mutant, tie1-D, was characterized. Unlike wild-type leaves, which were flat, the tie1-D leaves were curled upwards (Figures 1A to 1C). The leaves of tie1-D were also smaller and narrower than those of wild-type plants. The leaf margins of the mutant were wavy and more serrated (Figures 1A to 1C, and see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Epidermal cells from mature leaves of tie1-D mutants were polygonal, whereas wild-type cells had a typical jigsaw shape (Figures 1D and 1E). The tie1-D mutant had much smaller leaf cells than the wild-type (Figure 1F), suggesting that TIE1 may affect leaf cell differentiation. [[FIGURE]] We determined that tie1-D was a gain-of-function mutant. The tie1-D phenotypes were caused by a single T-DNA insertion located in the intergenic region between At4g28830 and At4g28840 (Figure 1G). The T-DNA insertion cosegregated with the tie1-D phenotypes (Figure 1H) and led to a significant increase in the expression level of At4g28840 (Figure 1I). We generated the construct 35S-At4g28840 in which At4g28840 was driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and transformed it into wild-type Arabidopsis; 251 independent transgenic lines displayed hyponastic leaves (Figures 1J and 1K), indicating that overexpression of At4g28840 phenocopied tie1-D. Most transgenic lines also produced hyponastic cotyledons (Figure 1J). At4g28840 was also overexpressed under the control of its own promoter and four copies of CaMV 35S enhancers, a construct that mimics the T-DNA insertion in the tie1-D mutants. Seventy-six independent transgenic lines displayed curly leaf phenotype (Figure 1L). These results indicated that tie1-D phenotypes were caused by the increased expression levels of At4g28840. Thus, At4g28840 was designated as TIE1. TIE1 encodes a protein of 193 amino acids that contains a basic region (between residue 29 and 45) followed by a helix region (between residue 47 and 57) in the N-terminal region (Figure 2A). Interestingly, a typical EAR motif (DLELRL) is located at the C-terminal end of the TIE1 protein (Figure 2A), suggesting that TIE1 may function as a transcriptional repressor. TIE1 also contains a putative monopartite nuclear localization signal (KRGK) located in the N terminus of the TIE1 protein (Figure 2A) (CITATION). We found three genes in the Arabidopsis genome, At2g20080, At1g29010, and At2g34010, encoding proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to TIE1, which were thus designated as TIE2, TIE3, and TIE4, respectively (Figure 2B). [[FIGURE]] To test whether TIE1 is a transcriptional repressor, we first expressed TIE1 with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag in Arabidopsis under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter. Twenty-one independent transgenic plants displayed small, hyponastic leaves that were similar to those of tie1-D mutants, demonstrating that the TIE1-GFP fusion protein was functional. The TIE1-GFP protein was clearly localized in the nucleus (Figure 2C), indicating that TIE1 is a nuclear protein. Then we generated a reporter construct 35S-UAS-GUS in which the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was under the control of a synthetic promoter that contained six copies of GAL4 binding site (UAS) fused with a CaMV 35S promoter (Figure 2D). We fused TIE1 to the GAL4 DNA binding domain to generate G4DBD-TIE1 and cotransformed 35S-UAS-GUS with G4DBD or G4DBD-TIE1 into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves to determine TIE1 transcriptional activities. As expected, GUS staining was strong in leaves cotransformed with 35S-UAS-GUS and G4DBD combination (Figure 2D). However, GUS expression was severely attenuated when 35S-UAS-GUS was cotransformed with G4DBD-TIE1, suggesting that TIE1 is probably a transcriptional repressor. We then tested whether the EAR motif in TIE1 was responsible for the repression activity of TIE1. We fused the GAL4 DNA binding domain either with TIE1ΔEAR in which EAR motif was deleted or with TIE1mEAR in which the conserved Leu residues in the EAR motif were changed to Ser residues. Unlike G4DBD-TIE1, G4DBD-TIE1ΔEAR and G4DBD-TIE1mEAR did not repress GUS expression in tobacco leaves (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the EAR motif is required for the repression activities of TIE1. Recent studies revealed that TPL and TPR proteins interacted with the EAR motif to function as corepressors in auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways (CITATION; CITATION). TIE1 interacted with the TPL N-terminal region (Figure 2E), which is reported to be sufficient for TPL to interact with EAR-containing proteins (CITATION; CITATION). The interaction between TIE1 and TPL was dependent on the EAR motif, as deletion of the EAR motif (TIE1ΔEAR) or mutation of the three conserved Leu residues of the EAR motif (TIE1mEAR) abolished the interaction between TIE1 and TPL (Figure 2E). The interaction between TIE1 and TPL was confirmed in a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay (Figure 2F). Our results also showed that TIE1 interacted with all of the TPR proteins, including TPR1, TPR2, TPR3, and TPR4, but not with SAP18, which interacts with some EAR-containing transcription factors (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 2A and Supplemental Methods 1 online). Our data suggest that TIE1 probably recruits TPL, rather than SAP18, to form a transcriptional repressor complex. To test this hypothesis, we fused TIE1ΔEAR with the C-terminal portion of TPL (TPLC) (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). We expected that TIE1ΔEAR is not functional as a repressor (Figure 2D), but TIE1ΔEAR-TPLC and TIE1 should behave similarly in plants. Indeed, four independent transgenic lines in which the expression of TIE1ΔEAR-TPLC was driven by a CaMV 35S promoter led to curly leaf phenotypes similar to those observed in tie1-D (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). However, the curly leaf phenotypes may also be caused by expressing TIE1ΔEAR fused with other corepressors, such as SAP18. To further clarify the relationship between TIE1 and TPL, we crossed tie1-D to the tpl-1 mutant (CITATION). The small and up-curled leaf phenotype of +/tie1-D was largely rescued in the double mutant +/tie1-D +/tpl-1, suggesting that TPL is required for the function of TIE1 (Figure 2G). These results indicate that TIE1 functions as a transcriptional repressor during leaf development by interacting with TPL/TPRs through the EAR motif. To investigate the spatial and temporal expression pattern of TIE1, we cloned a 2790-bp-long promoter fragment of TIE1 and fused it to the GUS reporter gene to generate the construct TIE1P-GUS. Ten TIE1P-GUS transgenic lines showed similar staining patterns. GUS activities were observed in shoot apical meristem, cotyledons, and leaves (Figures 3A and 3B). In young leaves, GUS staining was strong at the leaf margins and at the base of the leaves (Figures 3A to 3C). As the leaves matured, GUS staining became weaker (Figures 3D to 3H). Initially, GUS staining was restricted to the leaf margin and the developing vascular bundles of the complete leaf blade (Figure 3D). Subsequently, staining gradually concentrated in the vascular bundles at the base of the leaves as the leaves developed (Figures 3E to 3G). No GUS staining was observed in mature leaves (Figure 3H). The expression of TIE1 in young leaves and at the leaf margins was consistent with the observed phenotypes of the tie1-D mutants in which the leaf marginal regions curled upward. [[FIGURE]] TPL was reported to be expressed in the embryo (CITATION), but it is not clear whether TPL is expressed in other tissues. To reveal the expression pattern of TPL, we cloned a 2.8-kb-long promoter fragment of TPL and fused to GUS reporter gene to generate the TPLP-GUS construct. Five of six TPLP-GUS transgenic lines showed a similar GUS staining pattern. Strong GUS activities were observed in the vascular tissues, shoot apical meristem, and cotyledons (Figure 3I). At late seedling stage, TPL was strongly expressed in young leaves (Figures 3J and 3K). We then used quantitative RT-PCR to further confirm whether TIE1 and TPL are expressed in leaves and found that TIE1 was expressed at higher levels in seedlings than in older plants or old leaves (Figure 3L). The results are consistent with those observed from the GUS staining of TIE1P-GUS transgenic lines. Meanwhile, TPL was also expressed in leaves (Figure 3M). These results indicate that TPL shows an overlapping expression pattern with TIE1 in leaves, providing spatial evidence for the interaction between these two proteins. We identified one T-DNA insertion mutant for TIE1 from the available public mutant collections (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). However, it was not a null mutant (see Supplemental Figure 3B online), and no obvious phenotypes were observed in this mutant. We therefore used the inducible insertional mutagenesis system based on Ac-Ds induction by heat shock to generate knockout mutants for TIE1 (CITATION). We first identified one T-DNA insertion mutant, WiscDsLoxHs225_11A, in which the T-DNA insertion was located at a position ∼13 kb away from TIE1 (see Supplemental Figure 3A online) and then performed the heat shock treatment on the homozygous WiscDsLoxHs225_11A mutants (see Supplemental Methods 1 online). From ∼5000 HS2 (second generation after heat shock) plants, we identified one mutant plant, tie1-455, in which the Ds jumped into the splice site of the second intron of TIE1 (see Supplemental Figure 3A online), and the expression of TIE1 was completely knocked out (see Supplemental Figure 3C online). Although tie1-455 is a TIE1 null mutant, it displayed no obvious leaf phenotype. We speculate that TIE2, TIE3, and TIE4 are functionally redundant with TIE1, since they have similar domains with TIE1 (Figures 2A and 2B) and interact with TPL and the other four TPR proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays (see Supplemental Figure 3D online). Moreover, overexpression of TIE2, TIE3, or TIE4 in Arabidopsis led to phenotypes similar to those of tie1-D (see Supplemental Figures 3E to 3H and Supplemental Methods 1 online). In order to clarify the expression pattern of these three genes, we conducted RT-PCR analysis and found that TIE3 and TIE4 were expressed in leaves, whereas TIE2 was not expressed in leaves (see Supplemental Figure 3I online), suggesting that TIE3 and TIE4 may also participate in leaf development. Because the DNA sequence of TIE3 is highly similar to TIE4 (see Supplemental Figure 3J online), we generated an RNA interference (RNAi) construct, 35S-TIE3-RNAi, to knock down the expression of both TIE3 and TIE4 (see Supplemental Figure 3K online). We transformed 35S-TIE3-RNAi into tie1-455 and found that nine independent transgenic lines displayed epinastic leaves, a phenotype that is opposite to that observed in tie1-D mutants (Figure 4A). Furthermore, three independent transgenic plants exhibited even more severe phenotypes, for instance, production of deformed leaves (see Supplemental Figures 3L and 3M online), single cotyledons, or cup-shaped cotyledons (Figures 4B and 4C), which is similar to tpl-1 mutants (CITATION). These results indicate that TIEs play pivotal roles in leaf development. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the role of TIE1 in leaf development, we expressed TIE1mEAR, which may elicit a dominant-negative effect in wild-type Arabidopsis in an attempt to determine the consequences of inactivation of TIEs. TIE1mEAR does not interact with TPL/TPRs and is no longer a transcriptional repressor (Figures 2D and 2E). However, TIE1mEAR may compete with and disrupt the endogenous TIEs. This strategy was used successfully in the study of EAR motif–containing proteins (CITATION; CITATION). Expression of TIE1mEAR by a CaMV 35S promoter or TIE1 promoter caused interesting phenotypes. Eleven independent 35S-TIE1mEAR transgenic lines displayed epinastic leaves, opposite to the leaf phenotypes observed in tie1-D mutants (Figures 4D to 4F; see Supplemental Figures 4A and 4B online). Fifteen independent TIE1P-TIE1mEAR transgenic lines also exhibited epinastic leaves (see Supplemental Figures 4C and 4D online). The leaf epidermal cells of TIE1mEAR-7 transgenic lines differentiated earlier (Figures 4G), and the cell sizes were significantly larger than those of the wild-type control (Figure 4H). These results further confirm that TIE1 and other TIEs regulate leaf development, possibly by affecting cell differentiation. To further investigate the TIE1 function, we fused the transcriptional activation domain of the VP16 protein to mutated TIE1 in which the EAR motif was either deleted or mutated. We hypothesized that overexpression of TIE1mEARVP16 or TIE1ΔEARVP16 driven by a CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic plants was not only able to play a dominant-negative role by competing with the endogenous TIEs, but also might activate the target genes of TIEs that are normally repressed. We found that fifty independent TIE1mEARVP16 transgenic lines and thirty-nine independent TIE1ΔEARVP16 transgenic lines produced epinastic leaves, a phenotype observed in TIE1mEAR transgenic lines (Figures 4I to 4L; see Supplemental Figures 4E to 4I online). Furthermore, the TIE1mEARVP16 and TIE1ΔEARVP16 lines displayed more extreme curvature in both cotyledons and leaves than those observed in TIE1mEAR lines (Figures 4I to 4K; see Supplemental Figures 4F to 4I online). Six TIE1mEARVP16 as well as four TIE1ΔEARVP16 independent transgenic lines produced single cotyledons or fused cotyledons (Figure 4M; see Supplemental Figure 4F online), which were similar to those observed in tpl-1 mutants (see Supplemental Figure 4J online) (CITATION). Notably, these epinastic and deformed leaf phenotypes were also observed in tpl-1 (see Supplemental Figures 4J and 4K online). These findings are consistent with our observation that TIE1 interacts with TPL proteins (Figure 2), again indicating that TIE1 plays an important role in leaf development. Because TIE1 does not have an apparent DNA binding domain, we hypothesized that TIE1 might bind other transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Therefore, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with TIE1 (CITATION). Although TIE1 is a transcriptional repressor in plants, the full-length TIE1 is able to activate the reporter gene in yeasts (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). Activation of the reporter in yeast by a plant repressor has been reported previously (CITATION; CITATION). We then performed deletion analysis and found that the N terminus of TIE1, residues 1 to 108, showed no transcriptional activation activity in yeasts (see Supplemental Figure 5 and Supplemental Methods 1 online). We fused this TIE1 fragment with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) to generate the bait for the yeast two-hybrid screen and identified CIN-like TCP transcription factors. To confirm the interactions between TCPs and TIE1, we cloned all of the CIN-like TCPs in Arabidopsis and fused them with the AD domain. All of the CIN-like TCPs were able to interact with TIE1 in yeast (Figure 5A). We verified the association of TCP10 with TIE1 in vivo using BiFC analysis. Clear fluorescence signals were observed in the nuclei in the combinations cCFP-TIE1 and nYFP-TCP10, whereas the controls showed no fluorescence (Figure 5B), indicating that TIE1 physically interacts with TCP10 in vivo. [[FIGURE]] The fact that the N-terminal region of TIE1 (1 to 108 residues) interacts with TCP transcription factors and the EAR motif in the C-terminal region interacts with the corepressor TPL/TPRs suggests that TIE1 may serve as a bridge between TCPs and TPL/TPRs. To test this hypothesis, we fused TCP genes with the 3′-end region of TIE1 (corresponding to the protein region from residue 109 to 193 containing the EAR motif), and the fusion construct driven by a CaMV 35S promoter was transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis (Figures 5C and 5D). We expected that the transgenic plants expressing these chimeric proteins would mimic some phenotypes of tie1-D in which TIE1 was overexpressed and TIE1 had an increased chance to bind with TCP proteins in vivo. As expected, 16 independent TCP10-TIE1C transgenic plants displayed phenotypes similar to jaw-D (Figure 5C). Eleven independent TCP17-TIE1C transgenic plants showed hyponastic leaves similar to those observed in tie1-D (Figure 5D). These results suggest that TIE1 may regulate leaf development by interacting with TCP transcription factors. To further confirm the association of TIE1 with CIN-like TCP transcription factors, we examined the expression profiles of TCP-regulated genes when the TIE1 level was altered. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of all the four class I KNOTTED-like homeobox (KNOX) genes comprising KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA (KNAT) 1, KNAT2, SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) and KNAT2, the known target genes of TCP3 (CITATION), were upregulated in leaves of tie1-D (Figure 6A). Class I KNOX genes are well known to maintain the undifferentiated state of cells in the shoot apical meristem (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The upregulation of class I KNOX genes is consistent with the phenotype of tie1-D that the leaf cells are delayed in differentiation (Figures 1D to 1F). We also examined the expression of TCP direct target genes LIPOXYGENASE2 (LOX2), ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1), Indoleacetic acid-induced protein 3 (IAA3), and the SMALL AUXIN UP RNA gene At1g29460 in the leaves of tie1-D (CITATION; CITATION) and found that these four genes were significantly repressed (Figure 6B). To investigate whether the repression of these TCP direct target genes is released by the loss of function of TPL, we tested the expression of LOX2 in the leaves of the wild type, +/tpl-1, +/tpl-1 +/tie1-D double mutants, and +/tie1-D. As shown in Figure 6C, compared with that in leaves of +/tie1-D, the repression of LOX2 in +/tpl-1 +/tie1-D was largely released. These results again suggest that TIE1 plays essential roles in leaf development by regulating some important genes through interacting with TCP transcription factors and TPL/TPRs. [[FIGURE]] It is reported that miR319 is one of the main regulators of TCP transcription factors (CITATION). Overexpression of miR319 in jaw-D mutants causes profound defects in leaf development. We recently identified a jaw-D mutant in which four copies of the CaMV 35S enhancer are located at 4125 bp upstream of the miR319b gene (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). The jaw-D mutant was designated as jaw-5D after previously reported jaw-D mutants (CITATION). In the jaw-D mutant, the expression of TCP2, TCP3, TCP4, TCP10, and TCP24 was downregulated but not silenced completely, whereas that of TCP5, TCP13, and TCP17 was not affected (CITATION). Because miR319 directly affects TCP mRNA levels and TIE1 represses TCP activities, we expected that tie1-D jaw-5D would genetically enhance each other. In contrast with the tie1-D mutant, which displayed serrated and curly leaves (Figures 7A to 7C and 7G to 7I) and jaw-5D, which also showed curvature and wavy margins on the leaves (Figures 7D and 7J) (CITATION), the tie1-D jaw-5D double mutants exhibited much more severe phenotypes by producing highly serrated and deeply lobed leaves (Figures 7E, 7F, 7K, and 7L). Interestingly, the tie1-D jaw-5D double mutant frequently produced ectopic shoots in the sinus of serrations (Figures 7M to 7P), which was consistent with the observations that STM and other meristem-associated genes were upregulated in the leaves of tie1-D (Figures 6A). This phenotype is also similar to those observed in TCP3SRDX seedlings in which ectopic shoots are generated on cotyledons (CITATION). The observed synergistic interactions between tie1-D and jaw-5D suggest that TIE1 interacts with CIN-like TCPs and inhibits their activities. [[FIGURE]] To further clarify the genetic interaction between TIE1 and TCPs, we transformed the TIE1mEARVP16 into tcp3 tcp4 tcp10 triple mutants. Five independent lines produced smaller leaves, which showed partial rescue of the larger leaves of tcp3 tcp4 tcp10 (Figures 7Q and 7R). Scanning electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the late differentiated cell phenotype of tcp3 tcp4 tcp10 leaves was also partially rescued (Figures 7Q and 7R), suggesting that overexpression of TIE1mEARVP16 probably activates other TCPs (e.g., TCP2, TCP5, TCP13, TCP17, and TCP24). We then transformed 35S-mTCP4, in which a miR319-resistant mTCP4 was driven by a CaMV 35S promoter, into wild-type Arabidopsis to generate TCP4 overexpression lines that showed similar phenotypes as previously reported (CITATION). We crossed 35S-mTCP4 line (35S-mTCP4-10) to a TIE1 overexpression line (GFP-TIE1-15). The leaves of the double overexpression lines were similar to those of GFP-TIE1-15 (Figure 7R), indicating that the leaf phenotype of GFP-TIE1-15 is epistatic to that of 35S-mTCP4-10. These observations further support that TIE1 regulates leaf development by modifying the activities of TCPs.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used, except the tpl1-1 mutant is in the Landsberg erecta background. Gain-of-function mutants tie1-D and jaw-5D were obtained from our T-DNA insertion mutant collection (CITATION). Arabidopsis seeds from the wild type, mutants, transgenic plants, and crossed plants were placed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with or without 20 µg/mL dl-phosphinothricin or 50 µg/mL kanamycin. The plates were put at 4°C for 3 d to complete synchronization before being placed at 22 ± 2°C under long-day conditions (16-h light and 8-h dark) for 7 d. Green seedlings were transferred to soil and grown under the same conditions as described above. For the BiFC and TIE1 transcriptional activity assays, Nicotiana benthamiana was grown in soil at 22 ± 2°C under long day conditions. All the primers used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion site in tie1-D and jaw-5D were identified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR as previously described (CITATION). The arbitrary primers (AD) and specific ones used in thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR were the same as those described previously (CITATION). Primers DL1, P1, and P2 were used for cosegregation analysis of tie1-D; primers DL1, jaw-5D-P1, and jaw-5D-P2 were used for cosegregation analysis of jaw-5D. PCR was performed for 26 to 40 cycles (94°C for 30 s, 56 to 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min). For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNAs of the seedlings from wild-type, GFP-TIE1-15, tie1-D and tie1-455, or young or old leaves from 35-d-old or 40-d-old wild-type and tie1-D were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the M-MLV kit (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 20 μL. The cDNA was diluted and used as a template for RT-PCR or quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with three biological repeats using SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). PCR was performed at 95°C for 2 min, 94°C for 10 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s. The relative expression level of each gene was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT (cycle threshold) method, and ACT8 was used as an internal control (CITATION). The coding region of TIE1 was isolated from the tie1-D cDNA by RT-PCR using primers TIE1-1 and TIE1-2. The DNA fragments were cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-TIE1 (with ATG near the T7 primer) and pBS-TIE1r (with ATG near the T3 primer). Alternatively, the coding region of TIE1 was isolated from the tie1-D cDNA by RT-PCR using primers TIE1-3 and TIE1-4 and cloned into pDONRP2rP3 (Invitrogen) to generate pEN-R2-TIE1-L3. The CaMV 35S enhancer tetrad was amplified from pSKI015 with the primers Enh-1 and Enh-2 and cloned into pDONRP4P1r (Invitrogen) to generate pEN-L4-4Enh-R1 (CITATION). The 2790 bp of promoter between the ATG and 98 bp upstream of the T-DNA insertion site of tie1-D was amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA using the primers TIE1P-1 and TIE1P-2 and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pENTRY-TIE1P. Alternatively, primer pair TIE1P-3 and TIE1P-4 was used for amplification of the TIE1 promoter, which was cloned into pDONRP4P1r (Invitrogen) to generate pEN-L4-TIE1P-R1. For the generation of binary vectors, the HindIII-EcoRI fragment including the CaMV 35S promoter from pWM101 was introduced into pPZP111 (CITATION) to generate pQG111. The overexpression construct of 35S-TIE1 was generated by ligation of the KpnI-PstI–digested fragments from pBS-TIE1 and KpnI-PstI–digested vector pQG111. The overexpression construct 4Enhancer-TIE1 was generated by LR reaction of four plasmids, including pK7m34GW, pEN-L4-4Enh-R1, pENTRY-TIE1P, and pEN-R2-TIE1-L3. To generate 35S-TIE3-RNAi construct, the full-length TIE3 coding region was amplified from the seedling cDNA using the primers TIE3-3 and TIE3-4. The fragment was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pENTRY-AsTIE3. 35S-TIE3-RNAi was generated by LR reaction with the plasmids pENTRY-AsTIE3 and pBIB-BASTA-35S-GWRNAi. TIE1mEAR was amplified from pBS-TIE1 using primers TIE1-1 and TIE1mEAR-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-TIE1mEAR or using primers TIE1-1 and TIE1mEARN-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-TIE1mEARN in which ATG near T3 primer direction and without the stop codon. Alternatively, primer pair of TIE1topo-1 and TIE1mEAR-2 was used to amplify TIE1mEAR and the fragment was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pENTRY-TIE1mEAR. TIE1ΔEARN was amplified from pBS-TIE1 using primers TIE1-1 and TIE1ΔEARN-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-TIE1ΔEARN in which ATG was near T3 primer direction and without the stop codon. VP16 was amplified from pTA7002 (CITATION) using primers VP16-1 and VP16-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-VP16. The dominant-negative constructs 35S-TIE1mEARVP16 and 35S-TIE1ΔEARVP16 were generated by ligation of the XmaI-PstI–digested vector pQG111, XmaI-SalI–digested fragment from pBS-TIEmEARN or pBS-TIEΔEARN, and SalI-PstI–digested fragment from pBS-VP16. TIE1P-TIE1mEAR was generated by LR reaction with the three plasmids, including pK7m24GW, pEN-L4-TIE1P-R1, and pENTRY-TIE1mEAR. To test subcellular localization, TIE1 coding regions with or without stop codon were amplified from pBS-TIE1 using primers TIE1topo-1 and TIE1-2 or TIE1topoN-2 and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO to generate pENTRY-TIE1 and pENTRY-TIE1N. pENTRY-TIE1 was cloned into pB7WGF2 using LR reaction to generate GFP-TIE1, and pENTRY-TIE1N was cloned into pB7FWG2 using LR reaction to generate TIE1-GFP. For examination of TIE1 expression, TIE1P-GUS was generated by LR reaction between the plasmids pENTRY-TIE1P and pBGWFS7. To examine TPL expression in leaves, the TPL 2.8-kb promoter was amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA with the primers TPLP-1 and TPLP-2 and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pENTRY-TPLP. The pTPLP-GUS was generated by LR reaction between pENTRY-TPLP and pHGWFS7. To generate TCP-TIE1C constructs, the coding region of TCP10, TCP17 was amplified from cDNA of wild-type plants by RT-PCR using primer pairs of TCP10-1 and TCP10N-2, and TCP17-1 and TCP17N-2. The fragments were cloned into pENTRY/D-TOPO to generate pENTRY-TCP10N and pENTRY-TCP17N, respectively. The CaMV 35S promoter was amplified from pQG111 using primers 35S-4 and 35S-5 and cloned into pDONRP4P1r (Invitrogen) to generate pEN-L4-35S-R1. The sequence coding C terminus of TIE1 was amplified from pBS-TIE1 using primers TIE1-5 and TIE1-4 and cloned into pDONRP2rP3 (Invitrogen) to generate pEN-R2-TIE1C-L3. TCP10-TIE1C and TCP17-TIE1C constructs were generated by LR reactions of plasmids, including pK7m34GW, pEN-L4-35S-R1, pENTRY-TCP10N, or pENTRY-TCP17N and pEN-R2-TIE1C-L3. To generate the TCP overexpression line, the CaMV 35S promoter was amplified from pWM101 with the primers 35SB4-1 and 35SB1R-2 and cloned into pDONRP4P1r (Invitrogen) to generate pEN-L4-35S-R1. The full-length coding region of TCP4 was amplified from Arabidopsis cDNA by RT-PCR and cloned into pENTRY/D-TOPO to generate pENTRY-TCP4. Then, the point mutation was introduced using primers TCP4m-1 and TCP4m-2 to generate pENTRY-mTCP4. 35S-mTCP4 was generated by LR reaction with pK7m24GW, pEN-L4-35S-R1, and pENTRY-mTCP4. Constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101/pMP90 and then into Arabidopsis as described previously (CITATION). The histochemical GUS staining was performed as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, tissues from TIE1P-GUS or TPLP-GUS transgenic lines were immerged in a staining buffer containing 0.5 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide. Samples were vacuumed for 10 min and then put in a 37°C incubator overnight. The staining buffer was removed, and the samples were cleared using 70% ethanol before microscopy. For 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, leaves were dissected and soaked in 1 µg/mL DAPI solution. Nuclear localization observation was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope). For scanning electron microscopy, the 5th mature leaf from 60-d-old wild-type and tie1-D plants and 5th leaves from 27-d-old wild-type and TIE1mEAR-7 transgenic lines were isolated and fixed in the FAA buffer containing 50% ethanol, 6% glacial acetic acid, and 5% formaldehyde for 4 h at 25°C. Serial ethanol dehydration and isoamyl acetate substitution were then performed. Leaves were dried at critical point in liquid CO2. Samples were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (Jeol JSM-6610LV) as described in the user manual. The areas of leaf epidermal cells were analyzed using SPOT software (SPOT Imaging Solutions). About 100 cells in the given region of leaves were measured by SPOT software, and the frequency of cells with different cell size was calculated. To test the interaction between TIE1 and TPL family proteins, the N terminus of TPL or TPRs including the C terminus to lissencephaly homology domain were amplified from Arabidopsis cDNA by RT-PCR using primer pairs TPL-1 and TPL-2b, TPR1-1 and TPR1-2b, TPR2-1 and TPR2-2b, TPR3-1 and TPR3-2b, and TPR4-1 and TPR4-2b, respectively. The products were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO to generate pENTRY-NTPL and pENTRY-NTPRs. The bait constructs pDEST32-NTPL and pDEST32-NTPRs were generated by LR reaction between these plasmids and pDEST32 (Invitrogen), respectively. The prey constructs pDEST22-TIE1, pDEST22-TIE2, pDEST22-TIE3, and pDEST22-TIE4 were generated by LR reaction between pENTRY-TIE1, pENTRY-TIE2, pENTRY-TIE3, and pENTRY-TIE4 and pDEST22 (Invitrogen). Bait plasmids and prey plasmids or the blank pDEST22 were cotransformed into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech), respectively. To verify the interactions between TIE1 and CIN-like TCPs, all the CIN-like TCP genes were cloned into pDEST22 as preys. Bait DBD-TIE1 plasmids and prey plasmids of pDEST22-TCPs or the blank pDEST22 were cotransformed into yeast strain AH109, respectively. Medium supplemented with SD-Leu-Trp-His and 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4 triazole was used for selection. For generation of 35S-UAS-GUS reporter, Gal4UAS was amplified from pTA7002 (CITATION) using primers Gal4UAS-1 and Gal4UAS-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-Gal4UAS; 35S promoter without TATA box was amplified from pBI121 using primers 35S-1 and 35S-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-35S; 35S minimum promoter, GUS, and NOS terminator were amplified from pBI121 using primers 35S-3 and NosT-2 and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pBS-GUST. The reporter construct 35S-UAS-GUS was generated by ligation of four fragments: the HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pBI121, the HindIII-SacII fragment from pBS-35S, the SacII-NcoI fragment from pBS-Gal4UAS, the NcoI-EcoRI fragment from pBS-GUST. G4BD, Gal4BD-TIE1, Gal4BDTIE1mEAR, and G4DBD-TIE1ΔEAR were amplified from pYF503 series used in the transactivation activity assays in yeasts using primers of G4BD-1, G4BD-2, TIE1-2, TIE1mEAR-2, and TIE1ΔEAR-2. The products were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pENTRY-G4BD, pENTRY-G4BD-TIE1, pENTRY-G4BDTIE1mEAR, and pENTRY-G4BD- TIE1ΔEAR, respectively. Then, the four entry plasmids were used in LR reaction with pK2GW7 to generate the effector constructs. The plasmids of reporter and effector constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101/pMP90, and then different effectors were coinfiltrated with the reporter 35S-UAS-GUS and pCam-P19 into leaves of N. benthamiana as described previously (CITATION). After incubation in dark for 24 h and then in light for 72 h, the leaves were used for histochemical GUS staining. Full-length coding sequences of TCP10 and TPL were amplified from Arabidopsis cDNA by RT-PCR using primers of TPL-1, TPL-2, TCP10-1, and TCP10-2. The products were cloned into pENTRY/D-TOPO to generate pENTRY-TCP10 and pENTRY-TPL. cCFP-TIE1 or nYFP-TIE1 was generated by LR reactions between pcCFPxGW or pnYFPxGW (CITATION) and pENTRY-TIE1. cCFP-TPL and nYFP-TCP10 were generated from LR reactions between pcCFPxGW or pnYFPxGW and pENTRY-TPL or pENTRY-TCP10. BiFC analysis was performed as described previously (CITATION) with some modifications. These plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101/pMP90. The Agrobacterium harboring cCFP-TIE1 or nYFP-TIE1 was coinfiltrated with pCam-P19 and nYFP-TCP10 or cCFP-TPL into the leaves of N. benthamiana. The empty pcCFPxGW and pnYFPxGW vectors were used as negative controls. After incubation in dark for 24 h and then in light for 72 h, the leaves were dissected for observation under the microscope (Leica SPE).
