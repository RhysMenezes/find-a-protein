!~ABS~! The mitochondrion is an important power generator in most eukaryotic cells. To preserve its function, many essential nuclear-encoded factors play specific roles in mitochondrial RNA metabolic processes, including RNA editing. RNA editing consists of post-transcriptional deamination, which alters specific nucleotides in transcripts to mediate gene expression. In plant cells, many pentatricopeptide repeat proteins (PPRs) participate in diverse organellar RNA metabolic processes, but only PLS-type PPRs are involved in RNA editing. Here, we report a P-type PPR protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, P-type PPR-Modulating Editing (PPME), which has a distinct role in mitochondrial nad1 RNA editing via RNA binding activity. In the homozygous ppme mutant, cytosine (C)-to-uracil (U) conversions at both the nad1-898 and 937 sites were abolished, disrupting Arg300-to-Trp300 and Pro313-to-Ser313 amino acid changes in the mitochondrial NAD1 protein. NAD1 is a critical component of mitochondrial respiration complex I; its activity is severely reduced in the homozygous ppme mutant, resulting in significantly altered growth and development. Both abolished RNA editing and defective complex I activity were completely rescued by CaMV 35S promoter- and PPME native promoter-driven PPME genomic fragments tagged with GFP in a homozygous ppme background. Our experimental results demonstrate a distinct role of a P-type PPR protein, PPME, in RNA editing in plant organelles.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis SALK T-DNA insertional mutant collection was screened for mutants with defects in post-embryonic development and/or seed germination. One mutant had an abnormal phenotype in progenies segregated from SALK_019722 heterozygotes, and the homozygous mutant harbored a T-DNA insertion that disrupted the coding region of the Arabidopsis At3g18020 gene (CITATION). This gene does not contain any intron; instead, it encodes an uncharacterized P-type PPR protein involved in mitochondrial RNA editing (see below). Therefore, we named it P-type PPR-Modulating Editing (PPME) protein. The homozygous ppme mutant, ppme-/-, is a null mutant with undetectable transcription, as demonstrated by RT-PCR (CITATION). PPME is expressed during almost all growth and development stages (CITATION), suggesting that it has a housekeeping role. Indeed, when heterozygous ppme (ppme+/−) seeds were germinated in soil, no ppme−/− mutants were detected in the ppme+/− self-pollinated F2 generation, for which the wild-type to ppme+/− progeny segregation ratio was 1:2 (CITATION). These results reflect defective embryonic and/or post-embryonic development in the ppme−/− mutant. Nevertheless, when ppme+/− F2 seeds were germinated on solid MS medium, small ppme-/- seedlings were recovered (CITATION), but the growth of 14-day-old ppme−/− seedlings was significantly stunted (CITATION). After continuous growth on solid MS medium for 21 days, these seedlings survived but exhibited significant dwarfing after transfer to soil (CITATION).

Genotyping revealed that 34% (80) and 66% (156) of the progeny were wild-type and heterozygous plants, respectively, and no homozygous ppme plants were found. The p-value indicates that the segregation ratio was 2:1 (heterozygous to wild-type) according to the chi-square test. To complement the defective growth of ppme−/−, CaMV 35S promoter-driven (comp1) and PPME native promoter-driven (comp2) PPME genomic fragments tagged with GFP were transformed into the ppme+/− mutant. Both constructs successfully rescued the ppme−/− phenotypes (CITATION), and RT-PCR confirmed the presence of transformed PPME expression in complementation lines (CITATION). Furthermore, at the reproductive stage, ppme−/− produced normal flowers with severely aborted siliques containing shriveled seeds, and the plants exhibited significantly reduced viability (CITATION). Therefore, the stunted phenotype of ppme−/− was caused by the loss of functional PPME, which is essential for both post-embryonic development and vegetative and reproductive growth and development. PPME encodes a protein harboring 16 degenerate pentatricopeptide motifs, and it is classified as a P-type PPR protein (CITATION). In flowering plants, most PPRs are localized to the chloroplasts or mitochondria.12 Additionally, the growth-retarded phenotype of ppme−/− is similar to the phenotypes of several Arabidopsis mitochondria-localized PPR mutants with defective mitochondrial RNA processing, including slo1 and aef1/mpr25.40,41 Next, we investigated the subcellular localization of PPME. Complete colocalization of the PPME-GFP and Mito-tracker signals was observed in root hairs of stable, complementation lines containing GFP-tagged PPME genomic fragments in a ppme−/− background (CITATION). Similar results were obtained using TargetP prediction software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/). Thus, we confirmed that PPME is a mitochondrial PPR protein that may be involved in regulating mitochondrial RNA metabolism. Figure 2.Specific localization of PPME in Arabidopsis plant mitochondria. Root hairs from 7-day-old PPMEg-GFP transgenic plants were treated with Mito-tracker to observe PPME subcellular localization.

Co-localization of the GFP (green) and Mito-tracker signals (red) in elongating root hair cells, as observed by confocal microscopy. Scale bars = 10 μm. Because most PPR proteins have been shown to function as regulators of organellar RNA metabolism,18 we first examined the effects of the PPME mutation on the splicing efficiency (Fig. S1) and abundance (Fig. S2) of all Arabidopsis mitochondrial transcripts. In general, real-time qRT-PCR revealed comparable splicing efficiencies for most mitochondrial transcripts between wild-type and CaMV 35S promoter-driven comp1 seedlings (Fig. S1A). The ppme−/− seedlings had a lower splicing efficiency for nad2 intron 1 transcripts, but this decreased efficiency was not as obvious compared with our previously characterized splicing mutants, mterf15 and slow growth 3.10,23 We examined the levels of spliced transcripts for individual mitochondrial exons and found that the nad2 exon1 to exon2 (nad2 exon1-2) transcript level was slightly reduced in ppme−/− seedlings compared with wild-type and comp1 seedlings (Fig. S1B). Then, we examined the abundances of individual mitochondrial transcripts in ppme−/−, wild-type, and comp1 seedlings. In ppme−/− seedlings, most transcripts were upregulated, as previously reported in other mitochondrial mutants,10,23 while the nad2a mRNA level was slightly downregulated (Fig. S2). Similar impairments in nad2 intron 1 splicing have been observed in several unrelated mutants with defects in mitochondrial RNA processing.20,42-44 Therefore, this phenomenon might simply be due to abnormal mitochondrial activity (see below) and may not contribute to the phenotypic defects observed in these mutants, including ppme−/− described in this study. Next, we examined another aspect of RNA metabolism–the overall mitochondrial RNA editing profiles in wild-type, ppme−/−, and complemented seedlings. To identify mitochondrial editing sites, mitochondrial transcripts were extracted from all samples and converted to cDNA. The cDNA fragments complementary to editing sites were amplified using specific primer pairs described previously40 and were subjected to DNA sequencing. Surprisingly, among all examined editing sites, only the nad1-898 and nad1-937 sites, located at positions 898 and 937 of the mitochondrial NAD1 gene, respectively exhibited completely abolished and substantially reduced editing in ppme−/− seedlings (CITATION). The reduced editing in these seedlings could be completely rescued by either CaMV 35S promoter-driven (comp1 in CITATION) or PPME native promoter-driven constructs (comp2 in CITATION). Both nad1-898 and nad1-937 are non-silent editing sites,33 leading to codon switches from CGG (Arg) to UGG (Trp) at nad1-898 and from CCU (Pro) to UCU (Ser) at nad1-937 after editing (CITATION), resulting in amino acid changes in the NAD1 subunit of NADH dehydrogenase. Figure 3.Defective editing at mitochondrial nad1-898 and nad1-937 RNA editing sites in homozygous ppme−/− seedlings.

The lower panel depicts the predicted amino acid changes after nad1-898 and nad1-937 editing.

The edited and unedited products were separated in a sequencing gel and visualized by detection of FAM fluorescence signals. The edited products are from wild-type and ppme−/− seedlings and seedlings from 2 complementation lines. To validate the sequencing results, the nad1-898 site, exhibiting complete loss editing deficiency, was analyzed using a more sensitive approach, the poisoned primer extension (PPE) assay.45 To determine the corresponding sizes of completely edited and non-edited controls, synthetic correct and mutated nucleotide sequences were used in the PPE assay (CITATION). Accumulated edited products were detected in the mitochondria of wild-type seedlings and seedlings from 2 complemented lines; however, almost no edited products were detected in the mitochondria of ppme−/− seedlings. These results are consistent with the previous sequencing results. Taken together, these findings not only suggest that defects in both the nad1-898 and nad1-937 editing sites coordinately contribute to the ppme−/− phenotype but also imply that both the Arg-to-Trp and Pro-to-Ser amino acid conversions are critical for proper mitochondrial functioning during normal Arabidopsis growth and development. Most PPRs are known as site recognition factors because of their abilities to bind to specific RNA targets. For example, Arabidopsis PLS-PPRs recognize and bind to corresponding editing sites, e.g., CRR4 directly binds to the region surrounding ndhD-1 to regulate the ndhD-1 RNA editing site.18,35 We showed that PPME influenced the editing efficiencies of both nad1-898 and nad1-937 and subsequently more closely examined this PPME-mediated regulation. First, to assess the RNA-binding capacity of PPME, a recombinant PPME protein N-terminally tagged with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and an in vitro transcribed region spanning -40 to +20 of the nad1-898 editing site were tested by RNA-electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nad1-898 was used as it exhibited completely disrupted editing in the PPME null mutant. MBP alone and the sequences surrounding atp9-83, which showed complete conversion from cytidine to uridine in both wild-type and ppme−/− seedlings in our editing screen, were used as the trans and cis negative controls, respectively, to validate the binding specificity. MBP alone had no detectable affinity for the nad1-898 or atp9-83 probe (CITATION); however, MBP-tagged PPME exhibited dose-dependent binding to the nad1-898, but not to the atp9-83, probe. The affinity between PPME and nad1-898 was completely titrated by addition of competitive cold nad1-898 probe (“+” in the right panel of CITATION). The EMSA result clearly demonstrated that PPME can bind the region surrounding the nad1-898 site, likely affecting RNA editing by this means. Figure 4.RNA-EMSA showing that recombinant PPME specifically binds to sequences surrounding the nad1-898 editing site. (A) MBP-tagged PPME recombinant proteins were co-incubated with nad1-898 probes or atp9-83 probes for sequences located up- and downstream of nad1-898 or atp9-83, respectively.

(B) Nucleotide sequences of the probes specifically designed for EMSA. The RNA sequence (from 5′ to 3′) includes the region from the -40 nucleotide of nad1-898 to the +1 nucleotide of nad1-937.

The bold solid lines indicate the regions individually probed with specific probes, and the dotted line represents the putative nad1-898 cis-element recognized by PPME. 64. (C) RNA-EMSA revealed that among the 4 different probes, PPME specifically bound to only the nad1-898 −20 to +1 and nad1-928 -30 to +1 probes. However, the 20 nucleotides (putative cis-element for nad1-928) upstream of nad1-928 that overlapped with the nad1-937 −30 to +1 region did not exhibit PPME binding activity. The atp9-83 −20 to +1 probe was used as a cis-element negative control. The + and ++ symbols denote 200 nM MBP and 100 nM MBP-PPME or 200 nM MBP-PPME recombinant protein, respectively, and 200 pM probe was used for the all RNA-EMSAs.

The bold solid lines indicate the regions individually probed with specific probes, and the dotted line represents the putative nad1-898 cis-element recognized by PPME. 64. (C) RNA-EMSA revealed that among the 4 different probes, PPME specifically bound to only the nad1-898 −20 to +1 and nad1-928 -30 to +1 probes. However, the 20 nucleotides (putative cis-element for nad1-928) upstream of nad1-928 that overlapped with the nad1-937 −30 to +1 region did not exhibit PPME binding activity. The atp9-83 −20 to +1 probe was used as a cis-element negative control. The + and ++ symbols denote 200 nM MBP and 100 nM MBP-PPME or 200 nM MBP-PPME recombinant protein, respectively, and 200 pM probe was used for the all RNA-EMSAs. Next, to validate the specificity of the cis-element for PPME binding to nad1-898 and other possible target sites, including nad1-937, 4 RNA probes specifically designed to cover and/or overlap the −25/+10 nucleotides in the areas surrounding the editing sites were used to examine affinity for PPME by RNA-EMSA (CITATION). Among the 5 different probes used, including the negative control cis-element atp9-83 −20 to +1, only the nad-898 −20/+1 and nad−928 −30/+1 regions were bound by MBP-tagged PPME (CITATION). However, the nad−937 −30/+1 probe partially overlapped with nad−928 −30/+1 but was not recognized by MBP-tagged PPME. The cis-elements required for trans-acting factor binding and RNA editing specificity have been reported to be located in regions including the −25/+10 nucleotides around the editing sites.27 In addition, a region upstream of nad1-937 near the downstream of nad1-898 is required for PPME binding. The reduced RNA editing efficiency at the nad1-937 site in the ppme mutant may be a secondary effect of the loss of interaction between PPME and nad1-898 in the downstream region. Therefore, this interaction may be critical for the binding of other trans-factors to these editing sites downstream of nad1-898. These results suggest that PPME functions as a promising editing factor that specifically binds to the typical cis-elements spanning the −20 to +10 nucleotides surrounding the nad1-898 site in vitro. Recently, several studies have suggested that PPR proteins recognize their targets by screening their targeted transcripts for combination codes 46-48 In brief, pairing of the sixth amino acid residue in each PPR motif with the first amino acid residue in the following motif may result in tracking and binding to specific nucleotides located upstream of editing sites. The PPME protein contains 16 P-type PPR motifs; 12 thus, the combination of sixth amino acid residues (6 position) in motifs 1 to 15 and the first amino acid residues (1′ position) in motifs 2 to 16 were analyzed to determine the PPR code for the nad1-898 upstream sequence (Fig. S3A). However, PPME had a less conserved combination code (the residue in the sixth position was frequently threonine or asparagine).46 Another prediction software tool, TPRpred (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tprpred),49 revealed that PPME had 17 PPR motifs, and a less commonly predicted combination code for PPME binding was obtained (Fig. S3B). Additionally, aPPRove software (http://www.cs.colostate.edu/cstop/index.php) was used to analyze the conserved combination code for PPME, but none was detected. The current known PPR combination code might not be suitable for our PPME protein, and further extensive study of amino acid changes within the PPR domains of PPME may provide new insights into PPR combination code usage. Alternatively, PPME may interact with other PPR and/or DYW domain-containing proteins to perform RNA editing, as observed in other PPR family members.32 To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated potential PPME-interacting proteins from 14-day-old seedlings complemented with GFP-tagged CaMV 35S promoter-driven or PPME native promoter-driven PPME genomic fragments (CITATION). Neither DYW-containing proteins nor PPR proteins were found. Compared with the well-characterized editing functions of PLS-type PPRs, the P-type PPR protein PPME may be a new site recognition trans-factor that modulates the RNA editing of nad1-898 in Arabidopsis mitochondria.

The stunted growth of ppme−/− is similar to that of a mutant with defective trans-splicing of mitochondrial NAD1.43 NAD1 encodes the NAD1 component of NADH dehydrogenase, which is essential for functional complex I activity in the mitochondria.50 Loss of function of NAD1 has been shown to cause disassembly of mitochondrial complex I in one PPR mutant, otp43.20 Further, a mutation of PPME resulted in the failed editing of both mitochondrial nad1-898 and nad1-937 and no change in the Arg300 or Pro313 amino acid in the NAD1 protein. Nevertheless, an amino acid comparison revealed that a Trp residue resulting from the change from Arg300 to Trp300 in nad1-898 but not a Ser residue from Pro313 to Ser313 in nad1-937 after editing is highly conserved in humans and in most plant mitochondrial NAD1 proteins (CITATION and Fig. S4). We next examined the activity of mitochondrial complex I in ppme−/− seedlings. Crude mitochondrial protein extracts were separated using native PAGE, and then NADH dehydrogenase activity was examined.10 Interestingly, complex I activity was markedly reduced in ppme−/− seedlings, and this defect could be fully rescued by either 35S::PPME-GFP (comp1) or genomic PPMEg-GFP (comp2) constructs (CITATION). These results also demonstrate the critical influences of conserved Trp300 and likely of divergent Ser313 in NAD1 on Arabidopsis mitochondrial complex I activity. Briefly, our findings suggest that abnormal developmental growth of ppme−/− is caused by decreased complex I activity resulting from loss of RNA editing of mitochondrial NAD1 transcripts. Figure 5.Accurate nad1-898 and nad1-937 editing plays an important role in Arabidopsis mitochondrial complex I activity. (A) Comparison of the amino acid identities of NAD1 C-termini from different organisms shows that the conserved edited form of nad1-898 has an amino acid change to Trp and that the less-conserved edited form of nad1-937 has an amino acid change to Ser.

!~MM~! The ppme mutant (salk_019722) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University, USA). Seeds were surface sterilized and placed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (Duchefa Biocheme, The Netherlands) containing 1% sucrose and 0.7% phytoagar (Duchefa), with subsequent stratification for 3 d at 4°C. Then, they were grown inside of a growth chamber under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 22°C. After 21-days of germination on MS medium, ppme homozygous seedlings were transferred to soil for further growth. The coding region and 4.3-kb genomic fragments of PPME were amplified using the following primers: 5′-BamHI-ATGTTCTTCGTCACTCGTCTGCG-3′, 5′-BamHI-CTATCCTGAGGTTGCAGGGTTTG-3′, 5′-BamHI-TTTGCCAGCAAAAATTTCACAG-3′, and 5′-BamHI-TCCTGAGGTTGCAGGGTTTG-3′. Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) was used for amplification, and the amplicons were ligated into a pPZP221 vector harboring a C-terminal GFP sequence followed by the nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator. An Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain, GV3101, was used for transformation with the floral dip method.62 T1 seeds from transformed ppme heterozygous plants were harvested and sprayed onto 1/2 MS medium with 125 mg/ml gentamycin. Plants with a ppme homozygous background that were transformed with constructs were selected. T3 homozygous transgenic plants were used in further experiments. PPME cellular localization was evaluated in root hair cells from homozygous PPMEg-GFP transgenic plants with a ppme homozygous background. Seven-day-old seedlings were stained with MitoTracker Orange (Molecular 587 Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and observed using a confocal microscope, with excitation at 488 nm/543 nm and BP505-530/BP560-615 IR detection filters (510 META, Zeiss). Total RNA was isolated from 0.01-g 14-day-old wild-type, homozygous ppme−/−, and complemented seedlings with a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Then, cDNA was synthesized with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers as previously described.10 The RNA splicing efficiencies of mitochondrial genes were evaluated using 2 strategies. Primers targeting either the exon-exon or exon-intron junctions of individual introns in mitochondrial genes were used for amplification. Then, the amplicons for these junctions were detected using Power SYBR Green Supermix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The spliced/unspliced ratio was calculated from the ratio of the quantity of exon-exon junctions to the quantity of exon-intron junctions, as previously described.10 The spliced products were further amplified by RT-PCR with the primer sets targeting the exon-exon junctions; PCR was performed for 35 cycles to saturation, and any unspliced products were detected. Mitochondrial RNA stability was evaluated using primer sets as previously described.9 All quantifications were normalized to 4 housekeeping genes: YSL8, RPL5B, UBC, and TUB6. All known editing sites in the coding regions of mitochondrial genes were amplified from cDNA generated from 14-day-old seedlings using previously described methods of a splicing experiment and the corresponding primer sets.40 The resulting amplicons harboring editing sites were further sequenced to determine the editing efficiency at each site. For example, the primers nad1-F3:TCTTTCCAGGAGGTTGGCCG and nad1-R3: AGAGGGCAATTCCTCGCACA were used to generate amplicons harboring nad1-898. Further sequencing was performed with the nad1-F3 primer. PPE assay was performed as previously described.63 The primer 5′-FAM-labeled CTAATGATAGAGGCAAGAACACTTTCC-3′ was used to assess the editing efficiency of nad1-898. For expression of the PPME recombinant protein, the N-terminal transit peptide of PPME was excluded. The primers 5′ EcoRI-GATAGAGCTTACTGGAGAAGACGGATACACAGTATC-3′ and 5′-HindIII-CTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTCCTGAGGTTGCAGGGTTTG-3′ were used to amplify the PPME coding region without the N-terminal transit peptide, which was then ligated into a pMAL-cRI vector. Both the PPME construct and pMAL-cRI empty vector were further transformed into the E. coli BL21 CodonPlus strain (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were expressed at 28°C after 4-hr induction with 1 mM IPTG and were then further purified using Dextrin Sepharose High-Performance Chromatography Resin (GE). The following primer sets were used to synthesize nad1-898 and atp9-83 probes, respectively, via in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega): 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACATTTCCACGATATCGTTATG-3′ and 5′-AGAGGCAAGAACACTTTCCGGCCAAGTCC-3′; and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGGTGCAAAATCAATAG-3′ and 5′-TACCGATAGCAGCTCCCGCTGAAGC-3′. Further, the following synthetic RNA oligos were used as probes to examine the regions surrounding nad1-898: nad1-898 -20 to +1: 5′-UCAAUUAAUGGGACUUGGCC-3′; nad1-898 -21 to -40: 5′-UUUCCACGAUAUCGUUAUGA-3′; nad1-928 -30 to +1: 5′-GGAAAGUGUUCUUGCCUCUAUCAUUAGCUC-3′; nad1-937 -30 to +1: 5′-UCUUGCCUCUAUCAUUAGCUCGGGUAGUCC-3′; and atp9-83 -20 to +1: 5′-GGAGCUGCUACAAUUGCUUC-3′. The probes were further labeled with γ-32P ATP for subsequent EMSA. Probes (2.5 nM) were incubated with different concentrations of MBP-PPME recombinant protein (0, 0.75, 1.5 and 3 μM) at 25°C for 30 min in 20 μl buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 180 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1.7μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 8.3% glycerol, and 20 µg/ml heparin. The reaction mixtures were finally separated on a 6.6% TBE acrylamide gel. To evaluate the influence of PPME on nad1-898 editing efficiency, 200 nM MBP, 200 pM of each probe and either 100 nM or 200 nM MBP-PPME recombinant protein were applied as described above. Crude mitochondria were obtained and native electrophoresis was performed as described previously.10 Crude mitochondria were extracted from fresh tissues (200 mg) from 14-day-old seedlings in 2 ml extraction buffer (75 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.6 M sucrose, 4 mM EDTA, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 8 mM cysteine, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 13000 g for 5 min (twice); then, the supernatants were centrifuged at 22,000 g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, with 0.3 M sucrose, after which electrophoresis was immediately performed. Crude mitochondria were washed with distilled water, resuspended in buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole/HCl, 2 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) and solubilized by addition of Lauryl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) (10%) at a DDM/protein ratio of 2.5 (w/w). After centrifugation at 100,000 g for 15 min, 10% glycerol and 0.02% Ponceau S were added to the supernatants, and they were then subjected to 4–16% native PAGE with anode buffer (25 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0) and cathode buffer (50 mM Tricine, 7.5 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.01% DDM and 0.05% Sodium deoxycholate (DOC) for 2 hr at 100 V. The native gels were washed 3 times for 5 min each and incubated with 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, with 1 mM nitroblue tetrazolium and 0.14 mM NADH. The reaction was stopped by exposure to a solution containing 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid until a dark blue signal appeared on the gel. Accession numbers: PPME: at3g18020; ppme-1: salk_019722
