!~RES~! We previously showed that SGRL transcripts are abundant in leaves during vegetative growth and decrease in senescing leaves CITATION. Thus, SGRL expression has a pattern opposite to that of SGR1 and SGR2, which are highly induced only during leaf senescence CITATION. Based on this pattern, we assumed that SGRL is not required for Chl breakdown during leaf senescence, but may have an important role in Chl catabolism and/or Chl turnover in leaves during vegetative stages CITATION. To investigate the possible roles of Arabidopsis SGRL, we produced Arabidopsis plants containing a P35S:SGRL-GFP transgene (hereafter SGRL-OX; see Methods). The expression levels of SGRL-GFP in four independent lines were evaluated by qRT-PCR and a line (#4) showing the highest expression was used in this study (CITATION A). First, we checked the SGRL-OX phenotype under salt stress (200mM NaCl). At 4days of salt treatment (DST), SGRL-OX plants exhibited early leaf yellowing, similar to SGR1-OX (P35S:SGR1-GFP) plants, as reported previously CITATION (CITATIONB). Similarly, early leaf yellowing occurred in the detached leaves of SGRL-OX (CITATIONC and D). Consistent with the Chl levels, photosystem proteins (Lhcb1, D1, and Lhca1) were also drastically decreased in SGRL-OX (CITATIONE). Furthermore, ion leakage rates, an indicator of membrane disintegration and cell death, were much higher in SGRL-OX under salt stress (CITATIONF). Notably, leaf color and Chl content of SGRL-OX leaves at the vegetative stage were similar to WT (CITATIONC and D), as well as to SGR1-OX CITATION. This probably is related to the expression of CCEs, which remain low under non-stress conditions but increase significantly under salt stress conditions (CITATION). We also found that SGRL-OX showed early leaf yellowing under other abiotic stresses, such as osmotic (CITATION), ABA-induced (CITATION), and drought stresses (CITATION), quite similar to SGR1-OX CITATION. Furthermore, we prepared other SGRL-overexpressing lines, including P35S:SGRL (non-tagged) and P35S:SGRL-FLAG. These overexpressors also showed an early leaf yellowing phenotype under salt stress conditions (CITATION). These results indicate that SGR1 and SGRL play important roles in abiotic stress-induced leaf yellowing. Under dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions, however, leaf yellowing in SGRL-OX was much slower than in SGR1-OX, but it started slightly earlier than wild type (WT) (CITATION), suggesting that the contribution of SGRL to dark-induced Chl degradation is relatively small compared to stress-induced Chl breakdown. Unlike Arabidopsis, rice contains only two SGRs, OsSGR and OsSGRL. Mutation of OsSGR (Os09g36200) caused a non-functional stay-green phenotype in rice during natural senescence and DIS CITATION, and OsSGRL-OX (Os04g59610) showed leaf yellowing even in developing leaves, similar to OsSGR-OX CITATION, indicating that both OsSGR and OsSGRL are positive regulators of Chl degradation in rice. To examine whether stress-induced leaf yellowing also requires OsSGR and/or OsSGRL, we developed Arabidopsis OsSGR-OX (P35S:OsSGR-GFP) and OsSGRL-OX (P35S:OsSGRL-GFP) plants. Expression levels of OsSGR and OsSGRL in four independent lines were evaluated by qRT-PCR (CITATION A and B). Under normal growth conditions, leaf color of both OsSGR-OX and OsSGRL-OX was similar to WT (CITATIONC), dissimilar to the leaf yellowing phenotype caused by overexpressing OsSGR and OsSGRL in rice CITATION. At 3 DST, we found that degreening of OsSGR-OX and OsSGRL-OX Arabidopsis leaves was much faster than that of WT leaves (CITATIONC), with lower Chl levels (CITATIOND) and higher ion leakage rates (CITATIONE), similar to the Arabidopsis SGR1-OX and SGRL-OX leaves (CITATION). Thus, we concluded that the biochemical functions of rice SGR and SGRL correspond to those of Arabidopsis SGR1 and SGRL, at least under abiotic stress conditions. To analyze the effect of SGRL deficiency on Chl breakdown in Arabidopsis, we isolated a T-DNA insertion mutant of SGRL (sgrl-1, SALK_084849) (CITATION A). The absence of SGRL transcripts in sgrl-1 was confirmed by RT-PCR, indicating that sgrl-1 is a knockout line (CITATIONB). Like SGRL-OX, sgrl-1 grew normally and did not show any defects throughout development (data not shown). At 5 DST, however, sgrl-1 showed a weak stay-green phenotype similar to nye1-1 CITATION (CITATIONC). Consistent with the visible phenotype, total Chl levels were higher (CITATIOND) and ion leakage rates were lower in sgrl-1 (CITATIONE). To confirm the specificity of the effect of the T-DNA insertion in sgrl-1, a complementation test was performed. The conditional stay-green phenotype of sgrl-1 leaves was recovered by introduction of 35S:SGRL (CITATION). Interestingly, the effect of nye1-1 and sgrl-1 mutations on salt stress-induced Chl degradation was additive because Chl retention in nye1-1 sgrl-1 leaves was substantially higher than in either single mutant (CITATIONC), indicating that Arabidopsis SGR1 and SGRL act additively in stress-induced leaf yellowing. We previously showed that Arabidopsis SGR1 and SGR2 localize to the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and interact with LHCII CITATION. We examined the localization of SGRL-GFP by laser scanning confocal microscopy. In SGRL-OX (P35S:SGRL-GFP) plants, GFP fluorescence overlapped with the red Chl fluorescence within chloroplasts (CITATION A). In addition, SGRL-GFP was mostly detected in membrane-enriched protein fractions extracted from mature leaves (CITATIONB), indicating that SGRL also localizes to the thylakoid membrane. We subsequently used in vivo pull-down assays to examine whether SGRL also interacts with LHCII. Indeed, SGRL co-immunoprecipitated LHCII subunits (Lhcb1, Lhcb2 and Lhcb4), but not with other photosystem subunits such as CP43, Lhca1, and Lhca2 (CITATIONC), indicating that SGRL also binds specifically to LHCII. Pairwise examination of interactions between SGRL and six CCEs by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays revealed that SGRL strongly interacts with NOL, HCAR, and RCCR, which are abundant in greening seedlings and pre-senescing leaves CITATION (CITATIOND). By contrast, interaction of SGRL with senescence-induced CCEs (NYC1, PPH, and PAO) was relatively weak compared with their interaction with SGR1 CITATION. To confirm the Y2H assay results, we performed in vivo pull-down assays using 4 anti-CCE antibodies (note that antibodies against HCAR and PPH are currently unavailable and that the anti-SGR antibody detects both SGR1 and SGR2) (CITATIONE). Because protein levels of NYC1, PAO, and SGR1 were low under salt stress compared with DIS (CITATION), we incubated SGRL-OX plants in darkness for 2days before performing pull-down assays. Under these conditions, SGRL interacted with all four tested CCEs (CITATIONE). These results indicate that, like SGR1, ectopically expressed SGRL can form a dynamic complex with CCEs and LHCII in gerontoplasts CITATION. We also found that SGRL can form homo- or heterodimers with SGR1 and SGR2 (CITATION ), similar to SGR1 and SGR2 CITATION. It can be assumed that dimer formation is also important for the regulation of SGRL activity. We subsequently measured the expression of SGR1 and SGRL under salt (150mM NaCl) and osmotic (400mM mannitol) stress conditions. Under both conditions, SGR1 expression increased until 3h of treatment (HT) and then decreased thereafter (CITATION A and B). By contrast, SGRL expression gradually decreased after 1 or 2 HT (CITATIONC and D). Notably, the increase of SGR1 expression under these abiotic stresses was less strong than that observed during DIS or natural senescence (CITATION). Furthermore, the SGRL mRNA was much more abundant than the SGR1 mRNA at the vegetative stage CITATION (CITATION ). Together, these results imply an important role for SGRL, mainly in the early phase of stress-induced Chl degradation in Arabidopsis. To examine the transcriptional relationship between SGR1 and SGRL, we further measured the mRNA levels of SGR1 in sgrl-1 mutants and the mRNA levels of SGRL in nye1-1 mutants under salt and mannitol stress conditions, but their levels were not significantly altered (CITATION), indicating that SGR1 and SGRL expression are regulated independently of each other. This may explain the additive stay-green phenotype in sgrl-1 nye1-1 mutants. In this study, we show that abiotic stress-induced leaf yellowing involves SGRL in addition to SGR1; also, SGRL strongly interacts with three CCEs (NOL, HCAR, and RCCR) and LHCII (CITATION). It is noteworthy that nye1-1 sgrl-1 double mutants showed an additive stay-green phenotype (CITATION), strongly suggesting that SGR1 and SGRL act synergistically for rapid Chl degradation in pre-senescing leaves. Thus, it appears that in addition to an SGR1-CCE-LHCII complex CITATION, SGRL can form a similar complex with three CCEs at LHCII in pre-senescing leaves under abiotic stress conditions, which possibly accelerates metabolic channeling of Chl breakdown intermediates to avoid accidental release of phototoxic Chl and Chl catabolites. During natural senescence, differences of leaf yellowing rates between SGRL-OX and WT are hardly distinguishable (data not shown); however, we consistently observed that SGRL-OX lines started leaf yellowing slightly earlier than WT, but their leaf yellowing progressed more slowly than SGR1-OX leaves during DIS (CITATION). This discrepancy between the phenotypes of SGR1-OX and SGRL-OX during DIS is not fully understood; it may be due to protein domain differences in the C-terminal region between SGR1 and SGRL. Sequence analysis of SGR and SGRL proteins from higher plants revealed that the C-terminal region of SGR subfamily members contains a cysteine-rich motif that is absent in the SGRL subfamily. This motif could be involved in redox control CITATION; thus, one could speculate that during DIS, SGR1 and SGR2 are redox-regulated, but SGRL cannot be activated by this means. This needs to be further investigated in the future, e.g. by domain swapping experiments of the C-terminal regions of SGR1 and SGRL. The other intriguing matter is the involvement of CLH1 in the stress-induced Chl degradation. During pathogen infection, Arabidopsis CLH1-RNAi plants showed a tolerant phenotype CITATION, similar to noc1, one of the mutant alleles of SGR1 CITATION. Thus, it is possible that, at least under stress conditions, CLH1 is directly involved in the Chl degradation, probably together with SGR1, SGRL, or CCEs. Further biochemical studies are necessary for revealing their functional relationship in leaf yellowing under abiotic/biotic stresses.
!~MM~! A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as wild type. The T-DNA insertion mutant sgrl-1 (SALK_084849) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, USA). Plants were grown on soil in a growth chamber at 22–24°C under cool-white fluorescent light (90–100μmolm−2 s−1) under long-day (LD; 16h light/8h dark) conditions. For dark treatment of whole plants, 3-week-old plants were transferred to complete darkness. After dark incubation, the rosette leaves were sampled under safe green light. Analyses of salt, osmotic, ABA-induced and drought stresses was performed as previously described CITATION. The full-length cDNAs of Arabidopsis SGRL (At1g44000), rice OsSGR (Os09g36200), and OsSGRL (Os04g59610) with or without stop codons were amplified by RT-PCR. After insertion into the Gateway entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen), the cDNA inserts were recombined into the binary Gateway vectors, pMDC85, pEarleyGate 202 and 205, for expressing the C-terminal GFP, FLAG, and TAP fusion tags, respectively, or pMDC32 for expressing the tag-free native SGRL protein CITATION. The primers used for cloning are listed in CITATION. Arabidopsis transgenic plants were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101)-mediated transformation by a floral dipping method CITATION. Homozygous T2 lines were identified on selective agar plates and their progenies used in this study. As a negative control for in vivo pull-down assays, transgenic plants carrying P35S:GFP were used CITATION. Total Chl was extracted from the 2nd or 3rd rosette leaves using ice-cold acetone at 4°C. Supernatants were diluted with ice-cold water to a final acetone concentration of 80%. Chl was quantified spectrophotometrically as previously described CITATION. SDS–PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as previously described CITATION. For visualization of protein bands, polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB; Sigma–Aldrich). Antibodies against GFP (Abcam), SGR CITATION, NYC1 and NOL CITATION, PAO (Agrisera, Sweden), RCCR CITATION, and photosystem proteins (Agrisera, Sweden) were used for immunoblot analysis. GFP fluorescence images were recorded with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss). An argon laser (25mW) was used to generate an excitation source at 488nm. GFP and Chl fluorescence were recorded at 525nm and 660nm, respectively. For analysis of in vivo interactions between SGRL and CCEs, total proteins were extracted from the leaves of 3-week-old plants (3 DDI), and membrane-enriched fractions were purified using the Native Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Calbiochem). Protein extracts were adjusted based on Chl concentration. To examine the interactions between SGRL and the two SGR proteins (SGR1 and SGR2) by in vitro pull-down assays, 1-week-old etiolated seedlings were used for protein extraction. Protein extracts were adjusted based on total protein concentration, and anti-GFP antibody-conjugated agarose beads (MBL, Japan) were used for pull-down experiments as described previously CITATION. The beads were washed at least three times with washing buffer (50mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.2], 200mM NaCl, 0.1% [v/v] Nonidet P-40, 2mM EDTA, and 10% [v/v] glycerol). Washed beads were boiled with 20μL of sample buffer for 5min and then subjected to SDS–PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The full-length SGRL cDNA in the entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO was inserted into the destination vector pDEST32 (bait) (Invitrogen). Prey vectors for six CCEs were previously prepared in pDEST22 CITATION. The yeast strain MaV203 was used for co-transformation of bait and prey clones, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by a liquid assay using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactoside (CPRG; Roche Applied Science) according to the Yeast Protocol Handbook (Clontech). The qRT-PCR analyses were performed as previously reported CITATION. The transcript levels of each gene were normalized to those of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, At1g16300) in Arabidopsis. The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in CITATION.
