!~ABS~! Endocytosis performs a wide range of functions in animals and plants. Clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation is an initial step of endocytosis, and in animal cells is largely achieved by dynamins. However, little is known of its molecular mechanisms in plant cells. To identify dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) involved in endocytic CCV formation in plant cells, we compared the behaviors of two structurally different Arabidopsis DRPs, DRP2B and DRP1A, with those of the clathrin light chain (CLC), a marker of CCVs, at the plasma membrane by variable incidence angle fluorescent microscopy (VIAFM). DRP2B shares domain organization with animal dynamins whereas DRP1A is plant-specific. We show that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DRP2B and DRP1A colocalized with CLC tagged with monomeric Kusabira Orange (mKO) in Arabidopsis cultured cells. Time-lapse VIAFM observations suggested that both GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A appeared and accumulated on the existing mKO-CLC foci and disappeared at the same time as or immediately after the disappearance of mKO-CLC. Moreover, DRP2B and DRP1A colocalized and assembled/disassembled together at the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis cells. A yeast two-hybrid assay showed that DRP2B and DRP1A interacted with each other. An inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, tyrphostin A23, disturbed the localization of DRP1A, but had little effect on the localization of DRP2B, indicating that DRP1A and DRP2B have different molecular properties. These results suggest that DRP2B and DRP1A participate together in endocytic CCV formation in Arabidopsis cells despite the difference of their molecular properties.
!~RES~! To examine whether DRP2B colocalizes with clathrin at the plasma membrane, we compared the fluorescent signals of DRP2B and CLC by variable incidence angle fluorescent microscopy (VIAFM). In VIAFM images of Arabidopsis cultured cells expressing GFP-DRP2B and mKO-CLC under the control of Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S), the fluorescent signals of these proteins were observed as discrete foci with diameters of 200–500 nm (FIG-REF, Left and Center). Although foci of almost pure GFP and almost pure mKO were sometimes observed (FIG-REF, Right, blue arrow and white arrowhead), most of the GFP-DRP2B fluorescent foci were colocalized with mKO-CLC foci (FIG-REF, Right). In ten 100-μm2 VIAFM images containing a total of 1385 fluorescent foci (GFP and mKO overlapping foci, GFP-only foci, and mKO-only foci), 84.1 ± 4.6% (mean ± SD) of the foci were GFP-DRP2B and mKO-CLC overlapping foci (FIG-REF). Like the DRP2B foci, most of the GFP-DRP1A foci also colocalized with mKO-CLC foci (FIG-REF, Right). As for DRP1A, in ten 100-μm2 VIAFM images containing a total of 1261 fluorescent foci, 77.3 ± 5.7% (mean ± SD) of the foci were GFP-DRP1A and mKO-CLC overlapping foci (FIG-REF). These results suggest that DRP2B, like DRP1A, is almost entirely colocalized with clathrin at the plasma membrane. [[FIGURE]] To check whether Arabidopsis DRPs generally colocalize with clathrin at the plasma membrane, we compared the fluorescent signals of CLC and DRP3A, which is involved in the fission of mitochondria and peroxisomes (CITATION, CITATION) and which differs from DRP2B and DRP1A in its domain structure (FIG-REF). In VIAFM images of Arabidopsis cultured cells, GFP-tagged DRP3A also formed discrete foci like those of GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A (FIG-REF, Left). However, GFP-DRP3A foci were much fewer in number than those of mKO-CLC and were not colocalized with mKO-CLC foci (FIG-REF, Right). These results strengthen the possibility that the colocalization with clathrin is not a common feature of Arabidopsis DRPs, but a specific feature of the DRP1 and DRP2 subfamilies. We compared the temporal behaviors of GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A foci to the temporal behavior of mKO-CLC foci. FIG-REF shows the VIAFM images of Arabidopsis cultured cells expressing GFP-DRP2B or GFP-DRP1A and mKO-CLC at the beginning (t = 0 s) of each time-lapse observation covering 120 s with 3-s intervals, respectively. Additional examples of appearing and disappearing behavior are shown in Movies S1 and S2. FIG-REF, respectively, show time-lapse images of the areas outlined by white lines in FIG-REF. In these images, interestingly, foci with only mKO-CLC fluorescence appeared in the center of the areas (FIG-REF: t = 18 and 6 s, respectively). Subsequently, GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A fluorescence also appeared on the mKO-CLC foci (FIG-REF: t = 24 and 18 s, respectively). At t = 114 and 102 s, respectively, in FIG-REF, mKO-CLC fluorescence disappeared and almost pure GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A foci remained. As time passed, the GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A fluorescence also disappeared in these areas (FIG-REF: t = 120 and 108 s, respectively). [[FIGURE]] FIG-REF show kymographs representing the time-course transition of mKO and GFP fluorescence intensities on the blue dotted line of the images at 0 s in FIG-REF. In these kymographs, GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A fluorescence (FIG-REF: blue arrowheads and arrows, respectively) appeared and disappeared later than mKO-CLC fluorescence (FIG-REF: white arrowheads and arrows). A comparison of the profiles of mKO-CLC with those of GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A (FIG-REF: red and green lines, respectively) shows that the mKO-CLC fluorescence appeared and disappeared earlier than the GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A fluorescence (FIG-REF: white arrowheads and blue arrows, respectively). These results suggest that some almost pure mKO or almost pure GFP foci observed in single-time point VIAFM images (FIG-REF and FIG-REF: white arrowheads and blue arrows, respectively) were generated during the time between the appearance and disappearance of the overlapping CLC/DRP foci. To determine what percentage of DRP2B and DRP1A foci appear or disappear later than CLC foci at the same position, we analyzed the appearing and disappearing behaviors of DRP2B foci (Movie S1) and DRP1A foci (Movie S2) on each CLC focus. In most of the appearing foci, GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A fluorescence appeared several frames later than mKO-CLC fluorescence (FIG-REF). On the other hand, in most of the disappearing foci, GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A fluorescence disappeared at the same frame as or a few frames later than the mKO-CLC fluorescence (FIG-REF). These results suggest that both DRP2B and DRP1A begin to accumulate at the vesicle formation sites of the plasma membrane after the clathrin assembly and detach from there at the same time as or immediately after the clathrin disassembly. To investigate whether DRP2B colocalizes with DRP1A in the same foci at the plasma membrane, we compared the localizations of GFP-DRP2B and mKO-DRP1A in Arabidopsis cultured cells. In VIAFM images, almost all of the GFP and mKO signals also formed discrete foci (FIG-REF, Left and Center) and colocalized with each other (FIG-REF, Right). This result suggests that DRP2B colocalizes with DRP1A at the plasma membrane. [[FIGURE]] The VIAFM images showed only small numbers of GFP-DRP3A foci (FIG-REF). To check whether DRP2B and DRP1A also colocalize with DRP3A, we compared the localization of GFP-DRP2B or GFP-DRP1A with that of mKO-DRP3A. In the VIAFM images, the signals of GFP and mKO did not overlap with each other (Fig. S1). To confirm that DRP2B and DRP1A colocalize in Arabidopsis plants, we compared the localizations of GFP fused to the C terminus of DRP2B (DRP2B-GFP) and of tagRFP fused to the C terminus of DRP1A (DRP1A-tagRFP) in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells. These two fluorescent fusions were expressed under the control of ≈1.5-kb genomic sequences immediately upstream of DRP2B and DRP1A, respectively. In the VIAFM images of Arabidopsis root epidermal cells, the fluorescent signals of DRP2B-GFP and DRP1A-tagRFP were also observed as foci, and almost all of these foci overlapped with each other (Fig. S2). In five 100-μm2 VIAFM images containing a total of 694 fluorescent foci (GFP and tagRFP overlapping foci, GFP-only foci, and tagRFP-only foci), 95.3 ± 0.9% (mean ± SD) of the foci were DRP2B-GFP and DRP1A-tagRFP overlapping foci (FIG-REF). These results indicate that DRP2B and DRP1A are expressed together and colocalize with each other at the plasma membrane in the cells (at least in the root epidermal cells) of Arabidopsis plants. To investigate whether DRP2B assembles and disassembles together with DRP1A, we compared the appearing and disappearing behaviors of DRP2B-GFP with those of DRP1A-tagRFP at the plasma membrane. FIG-REF shows the VIAFM image of Arabidopsis root epidermal cells expressing DRP2B-GFP and DRP1A-tagRFP at the beginning (t = 0 s) of each time-lapse observation covering 5 s with 200-ms intervals, respectively. Additional examples of appearing and disappearing behavior are shown in Movie S3. FIG-REF show time-lapse images of the areas surrounded by the white and blue lines in FIG-REF. In FIG-REF, DRP2B-GFP and DRP1A-tagRFP foci (shown in green and red, respectively) seemed to appear at the same time (FIG-REF, t = 3.8 s). As time passed, these GFP and tagRFP signals increased gradually. On the other hand, in FIG-REF, GFP and tagRFP signals within the area surrounded by the blue lines gradually decreased, and these fluorescent foci seemed to disappear at the same time (FIG-REF, t = 1.8 s). [[FIGURE]] FIG-REF show the profiles of DRP2B-GFP (green lines) and DRP1A-tagRFP (red lines) fluorescence within the encircled areas in FIG-REF. The fluorescence intensities at each time point were calculated by subtracting the background fluorescence (the fluorescence within the area surrounded by the white dotted line in FIG-REF) from that within the areas surrounded by the white and blue lines in each frame of Movie S3. In FIG-REF, the DRP2B-GFP and DRP1A-tagRFP profiles roughly coincided during the increasing and decreasing of DRP2B-GFP and DRP1A-tagRFP fluorescence. These results suggest that DRP2B and DRP1A assemble and disassemble together at the plasma membrane. To examine whether DRP2B interacts with DRP1A, we conducted yeast two-hybrid assays. In this experiment, we examined the interactions among DRP1A, DRP2B, and DRP3A. Our previous report using yeast two-hybrid assays showed that (1) DRP1A interacts with itself, (2) DRP3A interacts with itself, and (3) DRP1A and DRP3A do not interact (CITATION). FIG-REF show the growth of the yeast strain AH109 on a plate with synthetic defined medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD/−Leu/−Trp) for checking the transformation of both bait and prey constructs and on a plate with synthetic defined medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His) for analyzing the interactions between each combination of bait and prey. As shown in FIG-REF, DRP1A-DRP1A interactions and DRP3A-DRP3A interactions were detected, whereas interactions between DRP1A and DRP3A were not detected, in agreement with our previous report. Interestingly, DRP2B did not interact with itself, but it interacted with DRP1A in both reciprocal combinations with bait and prey. These results indicate that DRP2B and DRP1A interact with each other. [[FIGURE]] Tyrphostin A23 (tyrA23), an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells (CITATION, CITATION), was found to disturb the dynamics and to increase the size of fluorescently tagged DRP1C foci at the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells (CITATION). To investigate whether tyrA23 has similar effects on DRP1A and DRP2B, we examined its effects on the localization of DRP1A-tagRFP and DRP2B-GFP in the same cell type. Thirty minutes of exposure to 50 μM tyrA23 caused DRP1A-tagRFP foci to increase in size and fluorescence intensity but decrease in number (FIG-REF), whereas it had no such effects on the majority of DRP2B-GFP foci. However, we observed some overlapping immobile DRP1A-tagRFP and DRP2B-GFP foci of about 1 μm in diameter (FIG-REF, Right, arrowhead). These effects were not observed in nontreated cells (0.1% DMSO, FIG-REF) or in cells treated with a noneffective analog of tyrA23, tyrphostin A51 (tyrA51) (FIG-REF). These results suggest that tyrA23 treatment strongly disturbs the localization of DRP1A at the plasma membrane but has little effect on DRP2B, which implies that the molecular properties of DRP1A and DRP2B are different.

!~MM~! Transformed Arabidopsis cultured cells and plants (A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0) were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E and a CFI Apo TIRF 100 × H/1.49 numerical aperture objective) with a Nikon TIRF2 system (Nikon). The methods for growing and transforming Arabidopsis cultured cells and plants, for constructing Ti plasmids used in the transformation, and for drug treatment of Arabidopsis plants are described in SI Materials and Methods. Oligonucleotide primers used for Ti plasmid construction are shown in Table S1. Fifty microliters of culture medium and 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were placed on a slide glass (76 × 26 mm; Matsunami) and covered with a 0.12–0.17-mm-thick cover glass (24 × 60 mm; Matsunami). GFP and mKO were excited, with 488 and 561 nm lasers, respectively, both simultaneously (FIG-REF, FIG-REF, FIG-REF, and FIG-REF, Figs. S1 and S2, and Movie S3) and sequentially (FIG-REF and Movies S1 and S2). The fluorescence emission spectra were separated with a 565LP dichroic mirror and filtered through either a 515/30 (GFP) or 580LP (mKO and tagRFP) filter in a Dual View filter system (Photometrics). Images in FIG-REF, FIG-REF, and FIG-REF and Figs. S1 and S2 were acquired with a Cool SNAP HQ2 CCD camera (Roper Scientific). The images in FIG-REF were acquired with an iXonEM EMCCD camera (Andor Technology). These CCD cameras were controlled by NIS-Elements (Nikon). Each frame was exposed for 200 ms. In Movies S1 and S2, the frames were taken at 3-s intervals. In Movie S3, the frames were taken at 200-ms intervals. The acquired images were prepared and analyzed with Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems), Image pro plus 4.0 (Media Cybernetics), and Image J (National Institutes of Health). Paired plasmids of pAD-GAL4-GWRFC and pBD-GAL4 GWRFC harboring DRP1A, DRP2B, and DRP3A were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109. The methods for constructing these plasmids are described in SI Materials and Methods. Oligonucleotide primers used for plasmid construction are shown in Table S1. AH109 was deficient in producing Leu, Trp, His, and uracil. The AH109 transformants were selected on SD/−Leu/−Thr plates (synthetic defined plates deficient in both Leu and Trp). The interactions were examined independently after 2 days of growth on SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His.
