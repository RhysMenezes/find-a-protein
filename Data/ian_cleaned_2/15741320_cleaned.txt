!~ABS~! Upon activation by far-red light, phytochrome A signals are transduced through several pathways to promote photomorphogenesis. The COP1 E3 ligase represses photomorphogenesis in part by targeting transcription activators such as LAF1 and HY5 for destruction. Another positive regulator of photomorphogenesis is HFR1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. Here, we show that HFR1 colocalizes with COP1 in nuclear bodies, and that the HFR1 N-terminal region (amino acids 1-131) interacts with the COP1 WD40 domain. HFR1(ΔN), an HFR1 mutant lacking the two N-terminal, COP1-interacting motifs, still localizes in nuclear bodies and retains weak affinity for COP1. Both HFR1 and HFR1(ΔN) can be ubiquitinated by COP1, although with different efficiencies. Expression of 35S-HFR1(ΔN) in wild-type plants confers greater hypersensitivity to FR than 35S-HFR1 expression, and only seedlings expressing 35S-HFR1(ΔN) display constitutive photomorphogenesis. These phenotypic differences can be attributed to the instability of HFR1 compared with HFR1(ΔN). In transgenic plants, HFR1 levels are significantly elevated upon induced expression of a dominant-negative COP1 mutant that interferes with endogenous COP1 E3 activity. Moreover, induced expression of wild-type COP1 in transgenic plants accelerates post-translational degradation of HFR1 under FR light. Taken together, our results show that HFR1 is ubiquitinated by COP1 E3 ligase and marked for post-translational degradation during photomorphogenesis. 
!~RES~! Although HFR1 was characterized several years ago (Fairchild et al. 2000; Fankhauser and Chory 2000; Soh et al. 2000), the subcellular location of its protein product has never been examined. To investigate this issue, we transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells a gene encoding an HFR1-YFP fusion protein. Genes encoding CFP and YFP alone were used as controls. Figure 1 shows that CFP and YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol as well as the nucleus. In contrast, HFR1-YFP was found only in nuclear bodies, and this specific localization was not altered by coexpression of CFP. Results from similar experiments confirmed previous observations that COP1 localized in the cytoplasm as well as in nuclear bodies (von Arnim and Deng 1994; Seo et al. 2003). Coexpression of HFR1-YFP and CFP-COP1 demonstrated that in the majority of the cases, the two proteins localized in the same nuclear bodies. However, it is not known whether the colocalization of HFR1/COP1 in nuclear bodies may be cell-type specific in Arabidopsis.  [[FIGURE]] Interaction of several phyA signal transducers, e.g., HY5 with COP1, are known to be mediated by a COP1-interacting domain (Hardtke et al. 2000). Two copies of this consensus sequence motif are found in the HFR1 N-terminal region (amino acids 48-83; Fig. 1B). To investigate the function of this motif, we deleted the first N-terminal 101 amino acids from wild-type HFR1 to give HFR1(ΔN). The HFR1(ΔN)-YFP fusion protein, which lacks the putative COP1-interacting domain still colocalized with CFP-COP1 in nuclear bodies, suggesting that the N-terminal domain is not required for the subnuclear localization.  The colocalization of HFR1 and COP1 suggested that the two proteins may interact. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, full-length HFR1 was found to interact with full-length COP1 (Fig. 2). Deletion experiments identified the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-131) of HFR1 as the site of interaction with the WD40 domain of COP1. This region contains two copies of the putative COP1-interacting motif (amino acids 48-83) (Fig. 1B).  [[FIGURE]] To further investigate HFR1-COP1 interaction, we carried out in vitro pull-down assays. Figure 2B shows that HFR1 interacted with the COP1 WD40 domain, but not the COP1 deletion mutant containing only the RING and coiled-coil domains, confirming results obtained with yeast two-hybrid assays. Because the COP1 coiled-coil (designed coil in Fig. 2B) domain is required for dimerization, our results suggest that HFR1 is able to interact with the WD40 domain of COP1 monomer at least in vitro. Surprisingly, the deletion mutant HFR1(ΔN), which lacks the two putative COP1-interacting motifs, was also able to interact with the same WD40 domain, although with reduced affinity. Competition experiments confirmed that the full-length HFR1 has about fourfold greater affinity for the WD40 domain than HFR1(ΔN) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that, whereas the N-terminal region of HFR1 is important for binding to the COP1 WD40 domain, other regions of HFR1 also contribute to this interaction, albeit with a reduced affinity.  To see whether HFR1 and COP1 also interacted in vivo, we generated double-transgenic plants expressing 35S-HFR1-3HA and XVE-COP1-6Myc. Note that the latter is an inducible transgene whose expression is dependent on inducer treatment (Zuo et al. 2000). The extreme instability of HFR1 in vivo promoted us to block its degradation in transgenic plants by the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (see latter sections). Figure 2C shows that immunoprecipitation of COP1-6Myc, which was expressed only upon inducer treatment, also pulled down HFR1. Although the recovery of HFR1-3HA was low, the interaction was clearly specific and dependent on COP1-6Myc, as HFR1-3HA was not detected in the noninduced sample. Neither COP1-6Myc nor HFR1-3HA was detected in the absence of the monoclonal antibody or when anti-MBP antibody was used as a negative control. The low HFR1-3HA levels in the coimmunoprecipitate could be attributed to at least two factors: (1) Only a minor proportion of the total cellular HFR1-3HA was associated with COP1-6Myc, and (2) the interaction between COP1-6Myc and HFR1-3HA may be weak, and did not survive the stringent wash conditions used in our experiments.  The interaction of HFR1 with COP1 provides preliminary evidence that the former may be a substrate of the latter. We purified HFR1-3HA recombinant protein from Escherichia coli extracts and used it as a substrate in an in vitro ubiquitination reaction. Figure 3 shows that HFR1 was polyubiquitinated by COP1 E3 ligase in a reaction dependent on E1 and E2 activities. We used SINAT5, an E3 ligase that modifies NAC1 (Xie et al. 2002), as a negative control. The inability of SINAT5 to modify HFR1 indicates specificity of the reaction. Similar results were obtained using HFR1(ΔN), although the ubiquitination reaction was not as efficient and produced mainly mono- and di-ubiquitinated products (Fig. 3, cf. A and B). Nonetheless, polyubiquitinated HFR1(ΔN) could be detected upon longer exposure (data not shown). This presumably resulted from the weak interaction between HFR1(ΔN) and COP1.  [[FIGURE]] To examine the stability of HFR1 and HFR1(ΔN) in vivo, we constructed cDNAs encoding the two HFR1 proteins tagged with 3HA at the C terminus. When expressed from a CaMV35S promoter, full-length HFR1, as well as the deletion mutant HFR1(ΔN), were able to complement the hfr1-201 mutation (Soh et al. 2000) with respect to hypocotyl length under blue (data not shown) and FR light. This result indicates that the biological activity of HFR1 and its deletion mutant was not compromised by the attachment of the 3HA. Here, we focus on FR-induced photoresponses. At low fluences, transgenic lines expressing the HFR1(ΔN) mutant were hypersensitive to (FR) light with respect to hypocotyl elongation as well as cotyledon expansion (Fig. 4A, panel a). In addition, these lines also displayed constitutive photomorphogenesis in the dark with unfolded and expanded cotyledons as well as shorter hypocotyls (Fig. 4A, panel b). These results confirm previous observations of Yang et al. (2003) who used an HFR1 deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal 105 amino acids (HFR1-ΔN105). Western blot analysis revealed a much higher expression level of HFR1(ΔN) than HFR1 (Fig. 4A, panel c).  [[FIGURE]] Further work was performed with wild-type transgenic lines expressing 35S-HFR1-3HA, 35S-HFR1-6Myc, 35S-HFR1(ΔN)-3HA, and 35S-HFR1(ΔN)-6Myc (Fig. 4B). We screened five independent lines each of 35S-HFR1-3HA and 35S-HFR1-6Myc. All showed a similar phenotype with a slight hypersensitivity to low-fluence FR, as compared with wild-type plants. Figure 4B shows hypocotyl lengths and cotyledon phenotypes of two representative lines for each construct. Similar results were obtained with lines expressing HFR1(ΔN), except that some lines displayed greater hypersensitivity to FR as well as constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness. Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of full-length HFR1 protein was either very low (lines A1 and A3; tagged with 3HA) or not detectable (lines B1 and B3; tagged with 6Myc) compared with that of HFR1(ΔN) in either darkness or FR light (Fig. 4C). Among the four transgenic lines (C1, D1-3) expressing HFR1(ΔN), the phenotypic severity in darkness or in FR light correlated with the protein expression level.  Northern blot analysis of lines A1 (35S-HFR1-3HA) and C1 [35S-HFR1(ΔN)-3HA] showed that the HFR1-3HA transcript level was about twofold lower than that of HFR1(ΔN)-3HA. Nevertheless, the basal HFR1-3HA protein level was very low and at least 25-fold lower than that of HFR1(ΔN)-3HA. The HFR1-3HA level could be considerably enhanced (25- to 50-fold) by the addition of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. In contrast, only a moderate increase (two- to threefold) was seen with HFR1(ΔN)-3HA under the same conditions (Fig. 4D). We conclude that HFR1-3HA is extremely unstable as compared with the deletion mutant HFR1(ΔN)-3HA. Similar differential stability between HFR1-6Myc and HFR1(ΔN)-6Myc was also observed in lines B1 and D3 (Fig. 4D).  These results are consistent with the observation of a higher polyubiquitination efficiency of HFR1 than the deletion mutant in vitro.  We used three independent lines of HFR1-3HA-overexpressing plants to further compare the effects of MG132 on HFR1 levels in darkness and FR light (Fig. 4E). Under both conditions, HFR-3HA levels were either very low or undetectable, but can be significantly elevated by MG132 treatment. However, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, HFR1-3HA levels in all three lines were severalfold higher in FR compared with darkness, suggesting a higher steady HFR1 levels in FR light.  The instability of HFR1 in vivo raises the question of the identity of its cognate E3 ligase. Because of the observed in vitro and in vivo interactions between HFR1 and COP1, we hypothesized that HFR1 is targeted by COP1 for degradation in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed double-transgenic plants expressing 35S-HFR1-3HA and the estradiol inducible XVE-COP1-6Myc. More than 10 independent transgenic lines with similar phenotypes were obtained and three lines (#1-3) were analyzed in some detail.  Because of its extreme instability, HFR1 was almost undetectable in all transgenic lines expressing 35S-HFR1-3HA (data not shown; see also Fig. 4). However, increased accumulation of this protein could be obtained by treating transgenic plants with low concentration of MG132 (10 μM), which partially blocks proteasomal degradation. Under this condition, induced expression of COP1-6Myc clearly resulted in a decrease in HFR1-3HA levels (Fig. 5A). Northern blot analysis showed that expression of the HFR1-3HA transcripts was comparable in samples with or without MG132 (Fig. 5A).  [[FIGURE]] If COP1 acts as an E3 ligase for HFR1 in vivo, HFR1 protein levels should increase when COP1 E3 activity is compromised. We have previously shown that mutations in critical amino acid residues of COP1 block its E3 liagse activity, and in addition, COP1 RING mutant can function in a dominant-negative manner by forming inactive heterodimers with endogenous COP1 (Seo et al. 2003, 2004). We analyzed three independent transgenic lines expressing 35S-HFR1-3HA and XVE-COP1(DN)-6Myc. In contrast to induced expression of transgenic wild-type COP1 (Fig. 5A), induced expression of the dominant-negative mutant (COP1-DN) resulted in an increase, rather than a decrease, of HFR1 levels. Because no significant changes in HFR1 transcript levels were observed (Fig. 5B), our results are consistent with the notion that HFR1 is targeted by COP1 for destruction by a post-translational event.  To further confirm that COP1 triggers post-translational destruction of HFR1, we determined the time course of HFR1 levels after new protein synthesis in transgenic seedlings was inhibited by cycloheximide. Figure 5C shows that HFR1 protein had a half life of only ∼2.0 and 0.5 h in white and FR light, respectively. In both cases, induced expression of wild-type COP1 clearly accelerated HFR1 destruction rate. 
!~MM~! The YFP coding sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′ ends of full-length HFR1 cDNA and cDNA encoding the HFR1(ΔN) deletion mutant to generate HFR1-YFP and HFR1(ΔN)-YFP, respectively. Both fusion genes were transcribed from a 35S promoter. The CFP-COP1 construct was described elsewhere (Seo et al. 2003). Two micrograms of each plasmid was bombarded into the epidermis of the inner surface of onion scales using a particle gun-mediated system (Bio-Rad). Bombarded tissues were incubated in darkness for 12 h before visualization of transient expression using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM510) with a standard filter set.  Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the Matchmaker GAL4-based two-hybrid system as recommended (Clontech). Full-length HFR1 and COP1 cDNA fragments were cloned into pGADT7 and pGBT8 (Clontech) to generate the constructs AD-HFR1 and BD-COP1, respectively. HFR1 and COP1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR and cloned into pGADT7 and pGBT8, respectively. All constructs were transformed into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate method and yeast cells were grown on minimal medium/-Leu/-Trp according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Transformed colonies were plated onto minimal medium/-Leu/-Trp/-His to test for possible interactions between HFR1 and COP1.  cDNAs encoding full-length and deletion mutants of Arabidopsis COP1 cDNA were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST-COP1 encoding full-length of COP1, GST-COP1(ΔWD) encoding amino acids 1-255 of COP1, GST-COP1 (ΔRING) encoding amino acids 110-675 of COP1, and GST-COP1 (ΔRING + Coil) encoding amino acids 216-675 of COP1. cDNAs encoding full-length HFR1 and its deletion mutant HFR1(ΔN) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) to generate MBP-HFR1 encoding full-length HFR1 and MBP-HFR1(ΔN) encoding amino acids 102-292 of HFR1. To enable detection of fusion proteins in in vitro ubiquitination assays, a DNA fragment encoding three copies of hemagglutinin (3HA; Lopez-Molina et al. 2003) was inserted into pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) to generate pMal-c2-3HA. cDNAs encoding full-length HFR1 and its deletion mutant HFR1(ΔN) were cloned into pMal-c2-3HA to generate MBP-HFR1-3HA and MBP-HFR1(ΔN)-3HA, respectively. Plasmid encoding MBP-SINAT5 was described previously (Seo et al. 2003; Xie et al. 2002).  All constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 cells that were treated with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside to induce fusion protein expression. Treated cells were broken by a French pressure cell press (SIM AMINCO) in purification buffer (20 mM Tris-Hcl at pH 7.4; 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Proteins were bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for MBP-fused proteins and glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for GST-fused proteins, washed with the purification buffer, and eluted from the column using purification buffer containing 10 mM maltose (for MBP-fused proteins) or 10 mM glutathione (for GST-fused proteins).  For in vitro pull-down assays (Seo et al. 2004), 2 μg of bait protein (full-length COP1 or its deletion mutants) and 2 μg of prey protein (full-length HFR1 or its deletion mutant) were incubated at 25°C for 2 h in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl at pH 7.5; 100 mM NaCl; 0.6% Trition X-100; 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and further incubated with glutathione sepharose 4B for 2 h. After washing with buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl at pH 7.5; 100 mM NaCl; 0.6% Trition X-100), pulled-down proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Western blotting using anti-MBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For competitive pull-down assays, 1 μg of bait proteins and 500 ng of prey proteins were used.  For in vitro ubiquitination assays (Seo et al. 2003), each reaction mixture (30 μL) contained ∼100 ng protein substrate [MBP-HFR1-3HA or MBP-HFR1(ΔN)-3HA], 20 ng rabbit E1 (Boston Biochem), 20 ng human E2 UbcH5b (Boston Biochem), 10 μg His6-ubiquitin (Sigma) and 200 ng E3 (COP1 or SINAT5). Reactions were carried out at 30°C for 2 h. Ten microliters of the reaction mixtures were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and ubiquitinated MBP-HFR1-3HA or MBP-HFR1(ΔN)-3HA was detected by Western blotting with anti-HA (Santa Cruz biotechnology) antibody.  For in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, 10-d-old double-transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (35S-HFR1-3HA and XVE-COP1-6Myc) treated with MG132 (50 μM) or MG132 (50 μM) plus β-estradiol (10 μM) for 16 h were ground in liquid-N2. The powder was resuspended by homogenization at 4°C in buffer A (50 mM Tris-Hcl at pH 7.5; 100 mM NaCl; 0.2% Triton X-100; 1 mM DTT) containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation, the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation reactions. Approximately 1 mg of total protein was precleared by addition of 20 μL of protein A agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubation for 1 h at 4°C, and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. Five micrograms of anti-Myc monoclonal 9E10 (Abcam) antibody or anti-MBP monoclonal (Santa Cruz biotechnology) antibody were added to the precleared extract, and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Twenty microliters of protein A agarose beads were added to the mixture, and further incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed five times with extraction buffer and proteins were eluted by heating at 95°C for 10 min in 100 μL of 2× sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies.  The wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype and hfr1-201 (in the Columbia background; Soh et al. 2000) were used in this study. Seed sterilization and growth conditions were as described (Xie et al. 2000). Conditions for FR irradiation were described previously (Bolle et al. 2000). Plant transformation constructs were based on the plasmids pBA002 (Kost et al. 1998) and pER8 (Zuo et al. 2000). For detection of transgene expression, a DNA fragment encoding three copies of HA was inserted into pBA002 to generate pBA002-3HA. cDNAs encoding full-length HFR1 and its deletion mutant HFR1(ΔN) were cloned into pBA002-3HA to place expression of these 3HA fusions under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. XVE::COP1-6Myc was constructed for β-estradiol inducible expression in plants by cloning into pER8 (Seo et al. 2003). Plants were transformed by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens vacuum-infiltration method (Clough and Bent 1998).  Approximately 100 mg of whole Arabidopsis seedlings was frozen in liquid-N2 and ground to a fine powder using a mortar and a pestle. The powder was resuspended by homogenization at 4°C in buffer (125 mM Tris-Hcl at pH 8.8; 1% SDS; 10% glycerol; 50 mM Na2S2O5; 2 mM PMSF) containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After homogenization, the mixture was clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts (10 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using an electro transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with anti-tubulin (Sigma) or anti-HA or anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) before visualization of immunoreactive proteins using ECL kits (Amersham Biosciences). Tubulin levels were used as loading controls.  Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings using QIAGEN RNeasy Plant Mini Kits (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids, pBA002-3HA and pBA002-6Myc, which carry the 3HA and 6Myc DNA fragments, respectively, were digested with AscI/PacI, to generate 0.11-kb 3HA and 0.22-kb 6Myc DNA probes. For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing iodoacetamide, and was then blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized overnight at 65°C with either α32P-labeled 3HA DNA probe or α32P-labeled 6Myc DNA probe. The probes were prepared by using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight hybridization (0.5 M Na2PO4 at pH 7.2; 1% bovine serum albumin; 7% SDS; 0.5 mg/mL denatured salmon sperm DNA), the membrane was washed once (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 65°C for 15 min, once (0.5× SSC, 0.5% SDS) at 65°C for 15 min, and finally rinsed briefly (0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS) at 65°C. The washed membrane was then exposed to X-ray film at -70°C.  Ten-day-old double-transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (35S::HFR1-3HA/XVE::COP1-6Myc) were germinated and grown on selective medium for 10 d (16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod) before transfer to liquid MS medium and treatment with MG132 (Calbiochem) plus β-estradiol (Sigma) or MG132 alone for 16 h as described previously (Seo et al. 2003). Treated seedlings were harvested for Western and Northern blot analyses. To analyze post-translational events, seedlings treated as above were washed and transferred to fresh MS liquid medium containing 1 mM cycloheximide to block protein synthesis and then exposed to white or FR light. Proteins were extracted at the indicated times and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies.
