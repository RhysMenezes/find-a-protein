!~ABS~! Transcription factors DREB1A/CBF3 and DREB2A specifically interact with cis-acting dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT) involved in cold and drought stress–responsive gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Intact DREB2A expression does not activate downstream genes under normal growth conditions, suggesting that DREB2A requires posttranslational modification for activation, but the activation mechanism has not been clarified. DREB2A domain analysis using Arabidopsis protoplasts identified a transcriptional activation domain between residues 254 and 335, and deletion of a region between residues 136 and 165 transforms DREB2A to a constitutive active form. Overexpression of constitutive active DREB2A resulted in significant drought stress tolerance but only slight freezing tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Microarray and RNA gel blot analyses revealed that DREB2A regulates expression of many water stress–inducible genes. However, some genes downstream of DREB2A are not downstream of DREB1A, which also recognizes DRE/CRT but functions in cold stress–responsive gene expression. Synthetic green fluorescent protein gave a strong signal in the nucleus under unstressed control conditions when fused to constitutive active DREB2A but only a weak signal when fused to full-length DREB2A. The region between DREB2A residues 136 and 165 plays a role in the stability of this protein in the nucleus, which is important for protein activation.
!~RES~! Because the C-terminal region of DREB2A is rich in acidic amino acids, the transcriptional activation domain of DREB2A has been predicted to exist in this region (CITATION). To identify the transcriptional activation domain of DREB2A, we performed transactivation experiments using protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis T87 suspension-cultured cells. According to the results of the Chou–Fasman analysis for prediction of secondary structure (CITATION), the C-terminal half of the DREB2A protein, from just behind the DNA binding domain to the C-terminal end of the protein (amino acid residues 136 to 335), is divided into five parts. We constructed a series of effector plasmids without each part of DREB2A and a reporter plasmid having a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven by three copies of a DRE sequence (Figure 1A ). These plasmids were cotransfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts, and then transactivation of the reporter gene was analyzed. As shown in Figure 1B, coexpression of the full-length DREB2A (DREB2A FL) cDNA resulted in ∼5 to 10 times higher transactivation of the reporter gene than without DREB2A (control). Deletion of the C-terminal region between amino acids 254 and the C-terminal end of DREB2A decreased transactivation of the reporter gene to the basal level (Figure 1B, DREB2A 1-253). On the other hand, an internal deletion mutant lacking the region between amino acids 136 and 253 showed a similar activation level as that of the DREB2A FL (Figure 1B, DREB2A 1-135:254-335). These results indicate that the C-terminal region of DREB2A between amino acids 254 and the C-terminal end is required for transcriptional activation. [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, deletion of the region between amino acids 136 and 165 of DREB2A resulted in a significant increase of its activity (Figure 1B, DREB2A 1-135:166-335). Coexpression of this effector plasmid transactivated the GUS reporter gene ∼30 times higher than the basal level and three times higher than that of the DREB2A FL. This level of activation was equivalent to that of the DREB1A effector construct (Figure 1B). We could not detect this kind of high activation using forms of DREB2A with the other regions deleted; therefore, we named this construct the constitutive active form of DREB2A. These results suggest the presence of a negative regulatory domain in the region between amino acids 136 and 165. To further analyze the activation domain of DREB2A, we prepared fusion genes that consist of the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 (CITATION) and various DREB2A fragments. The effector plasmids were cotransfected into protoplasts of Arabidopsis T87 cells with a reporter plasmid that contains nine copies of a GAL4 binding site fused to the CaMV 35S minimal promoter and the GUS reporter gene (Figure 2A ). As shown in Figure 2B, effector constructs of GB-DREB2A 136-253 and GB-DREB2A 166-253 that lack the region between amino acid 254 and the C-terminal end of DREB2A did not activate the expression of the reporter gene. The effector construct GB-DREB2A 254-335 containing the region from amino acid 254 to the C-terminal end of DREB2A showed the highest activation levels of the reporter gene among all effector constructs. When the fragment of GB-DREB2A 254-335 was extended toward the N terminus, no further increase of reporter activity was observed (Figure 2B, GB-DREB2A 136-335 and GB-DREB2A 166-335). [[FIGURE]] The region between amino acids 254 and 335 was divided into three parts and analyzed to identify the minimum activation domain of DREB2A. Each part could not or could only weakly stimulate the expression of the reporter gene when it was fused to the GAL4 binding domain (Figure 2B, GB-DREB2A 254-281, GB-DREB2A 282-317, and GB-DREB2A 318-335), and a deletion of at least one part significantly decreased the activity of the GUS reporter compared with GB-DREB2A 254-335 (Figure 2B, GB-DREB2A 254-317 and GB-DREB2A 282-335). Although the effector construct GB-DREB2A 166-335 induced reporter gene expression at almost the same level as did GB-DREB2A 254-335, transactivation by GB-DREB2A 136-335, which contains the region between amino acids 136 and 165, was approximately one-sixth that of GB-DREB2A 254-335. These results indicate that the region between amino acids 254 and 335 functions as an activation domain of DREB2A and that the region between amino acids 136 and 165 negatively controls the transcriptional activation ability of DREB2A. Figure 2C shows schematic diagrams of the DREB2A FL and the constitutive active form of DREB2A (DREB2A CA). DREB2A is predicted to have nuclear localization signals in its N-terminal region. The ERF/AP2 DNA binding domain and an activation domain exist in the central region and the C-terminal region, respectively. DREB2A also contains a negative regulatory domain adjoining the DNA binding domain. DREB2A CA can be generated by deletion of this negative regulatory domain. To analyze the function of DREB2A, we overexpressed DREB2A CA, DREB2A 1-135:166-335, which gave the highest activity in the transient transactivation experiments (Figure 1B), in Arabidopsis plants. This constitutive active form of DREB2A was overexpressed under the control of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter (CITATION). The tobacco mosaic virus Ω sequence (CITATION) was inserted upstream of the mutant DREB2A fragment to increase the translational level. Fifty-five transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated using the vacuum infiltration method (CITATION). Expression levels of the transgene in these transgenic T2 plants were analyzed by RNA gel blot analysis, and we selected three lines, 35S:DREB2A CA-a, 35S:DREB2A CA-b, and 35S:DREB2A CA-c, that showed strong, moderate, and weak transgene expression, respectively, for further analysis (Figure 3 ). [[FIGURE]] We observed the growth of the 35S:DREB2A CA plants under normal growing conditions and compared them with control plants containing the pBI121 vector (wild type) and 35S:DREB2A FL plants overexpressing the DREB2A FL cDNA (Figures 3A to 3C). All the 35S:DREB2A CA plants showed significant growth retardation compared with the control plants, and the level of retardation was correlated with the levels of expression of the transgene and of a DREB2A target gene, RD29A (Figure 3E). By contrast, only very weak growth retardation was observed in 35S:DREB2A FL plants overexpressing DREB2A FL. The 35S:DREB2A CA plants had rounded, slightly darker leaves with short petioles. These phenotypes appeared in the 35S:DREB2A CA-a plants more notably than in the 35S:DREB2A-c plants (Figure 3D). To determine the genes downstream of DREB2A in Arabidopsis, we performed array analysis using a full-length cDNA microarray containing ∼7000 Arabidopsis full-length cDNAs (CITATION). We used three independent transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing DREB2A CA: 35S:DREB2A CA-a, 35S:DREB2A CA-b, and 35S:DREB2A CA-c. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were prepared from mRNAs isolated from the 35S:DREB2A CA and control plants, respectively, grown under unstressed control conditions. These probes were hybridized with the cDNA microarray, and the expression profiles of the ∼7000 genes were analyzed. To assess the reproducibility, we repeated each experiment three times and further analyzed the genes showing a signal intensity >2000 in at least one experiment. Table 1 lists the genes whose expression was increased more than five times in the 35S:DREB2A CA-a plants (CITATION). We regarded genes with an expression ratio >5 in the 35S:DREB2A CA-a plants as candidates for DREB2A downstream genes. Seventeen genes were identified as candidates by cDNA microarray analysis. Expression ratios of most identified genes were correlated with levels of mRNA accumulation of DREB2A CA among the three transgenic lines (see Supplemental Table 1 online; European Bioinformatics Institute ArrayExpress database; accession number E-MEXP-317). Microarray Analysis of 35S:DREB2A CA Plants In our previous study, the DREB2A protein specifically bound to six nucleotides (A/GCCGAC) of the DRE core motif (CITATION). We searched for this core motif in the promoter regions of the 17 identified genes. The 1000-bp promoter regions upstream of putative transcriptional initiation sites that are the 5′-ends of the full-length cDNA clones were used for this search (CITATION). We found the DRE motif(s) in the promoter region of 15 genes. Because many stress-inducible genes that have the DRE motif(s) contain the abscisic acid–responsive element (ABRE) core motif (ACGTGG/T) in their promoter regions, we also searched for ABRE in the promoter regions of the 17 genes. Thirteen contained the ABRE motif(s), and 12 contained both DRE and ABRE motifs in their 1000-bp promoter regions. As the DREB1A protein was also reported to bind specifically to the DRE core motif (CITATION), we compared these 17 genes with the genes downstream of DREB1A identified by CITATION. We found only eight genes in common. For further analysis of the genes that are upregulated by overexpression of DREB2A CA, we performed RNA gel blot analysis. The total RNAs isolated from the wild-type, 35S:DREB1A-b, 35S:DREB2A CA-a, 35S:DREB2A CA-b, and 35S:DREB2A CA-c plants with or without stress treatments of dehydration for 5 h and 4°C for 5 h were used for RNA gel blot analysis (Figure 4 ). The 35S:DREB1A-b plants corresponded to 35S:DREB1Ab described by CITATION, and this line showed moderate phenotypic change among the DREB1A overexpressors. Figure 4A shows expression of the DREB1A and DREB2A transgenes in the transgenic plants. DREB1A was overexpressed in the 35S:DREB1A-b transgenic plants, and the active form of DREB2A was overproduced in the 35S:DREB2A CA transgenic plants. We subjected genes whose expression ratios were >5 and the genes KIN1, KIN2, At1g22985, COR15B, COR414-TM1, and At2g02100 to RNA gel blot analysis. These latter genes, except for At1g22985, have DRE in their promoter regions and showed expression of >5 in transgenic plants overexpressing DREB1A (CITATION), whereas the expression ratios in the 35S:DREB2A CA-a plants were <5 (Table 1). Although the expression ratio of At1g22985 in the 35S:DREB2A CA-a plants was 3.4, we confirmed the expression of this gene using RNA gel blot analysis, as it encodes an interesting protein, a transcription factor that contains the ERF/AP2 DNA binding domain, suggesting the existence of further regulation of gene expression downstream of DREB2A. RNA gel blot analysis showed that accumulation of mRNAs of 11 genes under unstressed control conditions was increased in the 35S:DREB2A CA plants compared with that in the wild-type plants but not in the 35S:DREB1A-b plants (Figure 4B, lanes 1, 5, 8, 11, and 14). Most of these genes responded to drought and/or cold stress in the wild-type plants; in particular, accumulation of RD29B, At1g52690, and At1g69870 transcripts increased in response to drought stress treatment (Figure 4B, lanes 1 to 3). Figure 4C shows genes that were induced equivalently in the 35S:DREB1A-b plants and the 35S:DREB2A CA plants. Although At2g02100 and COR414-TM1 were overexpressed in the 35S:DREB1A-b plants and have DREs in their promoter regions, their expression was not increased in the 35S:DREB2A CA plants (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14). Expression of COR15A, KIN1, KIN2, and COR15B was increased in both the 35S:DREB1A and the 35S:DREB2A CA plants, but their expression levels were much higher in the 35S:DREB1A-b plants than in the 35S:DREB2A CA plants (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14). [[FIGURE]] To understand why several genes downstream of DREB2A are different from those downstream of DREB1A, we compared the DRE sequences in the promoter regions of the DREB1A- and DREB2A-upregulated genes. The genes listed in Figures 4B and 4D were selected as DREB2A- and DREB1A-upregulated genes, respectively. We searched for the DRE core motif (A/GCCGAC) in the promoter regions of the genes, using the 500-bp promoter regions upstream of putative transcriptional initiation sites at the 5′-end of the full-length cDNA clones for this search (CITATION). We found 8 and 11 DRE sequences in the promoter regions of the DREB1A-upregulated and DREB2A-upregulated genes, respectively, and analyzed them with 20 neighboring nucleotides (10 on each side) using the sequence logo programs (CITATION; Figures 5A and 5B ). [[FIGURE]] Recently, we reported that the DREB1A protein has the highest affinity to the A/GCCGACNT sequence, which we determined by detailed analysis of the promoter region of the DREB1A downstream genes (CITATION). We found A/GCCGACNT in the promoter regions of 75% of the DREB1A-upregulated genes. However, only four DRE sequences (36%) were A/GCCGACNT in the promoter regions of the DREB2A-upregulated genes. Although the last T of A/GCCGACNT is critical for the binding affinity of the DREB1A protein to DRE, the binding affinity of the DREB2A protein may not be affected by a base substitution at the corresponding position of DRE (Figure 5A; CITATION). To confirm this hypothesis, we performed a gel mobility shift assay with DNA fragments containing the ACCGACAT or ACCGACAA/C/G sequences as competitors (Figures 5C and 5D). Addition of the unlabeled DNA fragment containing ACCGACAT reduced the extent of binding of DREB1A more effectively than that of the unlabeled DNA fragment containing ACCGACAA/C/G (Figure 5D; CITATION). On the other hand, we could not detect a difference in the binding affinity of DREB2A between the DNA fragments containing ACCGACAT and those containing ACCGACAA/C/G. Among the 11 DRE sequences found in the promoter sequences of the DREB2A-upregulated genes, 1 contained GCCGAC and 10 contained ACCGAC as the DRE core motifs (Figure 5B). This low frequency of G at this nucleotide position (position 11 in Figure 5B) suggests low binding affinity of the DREB2A protein to the GCCGAC sequence. To analyze binding characteristics of DREB2A to ACCGAC and GCCGAC, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using 75-bp DNA fragments containing A/C/G/TCCGAC (Figures 5C and 5E). The addition of unlabeled ACCGACAT or GCCGACAT competitors inhibited the binding of the DREB1A protein equivalently. By contrast, the addition of an unlabeled ACCGACAT fragment was more effective at binding the DREB2A protein than the addition of an unlabeled DNA fragment containing C/G/TCCGACAT. We compared the drought and freezing stress tolerance of the 35S:DREB2A CA plants with that of the 35S:DREB1A-b and wild-type plants (Figure 6 ). The plants were grown on germination medium agar plates for 3 weeks, then transferred to soil and grown for 1 week at 22°C. For drought stress treatment, water was withheld for 2 weeks. They were then watered and grown under control conditions for 3 d. This treatment killed all wild-type plants, but ∼60% of the 35S:DREB1A-b plants survived. Like 35S:DREB1A-b, the 35S:DREB2A CA plants exhibited tolerance to drought, with survival rates of 62.8 to 83.3%. [[FIGURE]] For the freezing stress treatment, the plants were exposed to a temperature of −6°C for 30 h and returned to 22°C for 5 d. All the wild-type plants died in this treatment, whereas ∼40% of the 35S:DREB1A-b plants survived. By contrast, only 5.0 to 11.7% of the 35S:DREB2A CA plants survived (Figures 6A and 6B). These results indicate that the genes downstream of DREB2A play an important role in drought stress tolerance but are not sufficient to withstand freezing stress. We have reported that overexpression of DREB1A driven by the stress-inducible RD29A promoter is able to improve plant stress tolerance significantly with minimum growth retardation (CITATION, CITATION). Because overexpression of DREB2A CA with the CaMV 35S promoter showed a negative effect on plant growth, we tried to use this technique to overexpress DREB2A CA. We generated 20 transgenic plants overexpressing DREB2A CA cDNA driven by the RD29A promoter (RD29A:DREB2A CA). Accumulation of DREB2A mRNA and of mRNAs of its downstream gene RD29B in these transgenic plants was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. We selected lines RD29A:DREB2A CA-a and RD29A:DREB2A CA-b for further analysis. We compared these two lines with wild-type and 35S:DREB2A CA-b plants. Expression of both DREB2A and RD29B was enhanced in the 35S:DREB2A CA-b plants even under unstressed condition. By contrast, expression levels of these genes in the RD29A:DREB2A CA-a and RD29A:DREB2A CA-b plants under unstressed conditions were relatively low compared with those in 35S:DREB2A CA-b. After 30 min of dehydration, expression of DREB2A and RD29B in the RD29A:DREB2A CA-a plants was increased by 24 and 4 times, respectively, compared with that in the wild-type plants (Figure 7A ). [[FIGURE]] Growth of the RD29A:DREB2A CA plants was compared with that of the wild-type and 35S:DREB2A CA-b plants. Figure 7B shows 5-week-old plants of the wild type, 35S:DREB2A CA-b, RD29A:DREB2A CA-a, and RD29A:DREB2A CA-b. Unlike the 35S:DREB2A CA-b plants, there were no significant differences in growth between the vector control and RD29A:DREB2A CA plants. We then analyzed seed yields of these plants (Figure 7C). The seed yield of 35S:DREB2A CA-b was reduced to 40% of the wild type. By contrast, the seed yield of the RD29A:DREB2A CA-a plants was similar to that of wild-type plants grown under control conditions, and that of RD29A:DREB2A CA-b plants was 77% of the wild type. The tolerance of the RD29A:DREB2A CA plants to drought was compared with that of the 35S:DREB2A CA-b and wild-type plants (Figures 7D and 7E). Plants grown in pots were not watered for 2 weeks. Only 21.3% of the wild-type plants survived. However, the survival rates of RD29A:DREB2A CA-a and -b plants were much higher, at 88.3 and 83.3%, respectively (Figures 7E and 7F). To study subcellular accumulation patterns of the DREB2A FL protein and the DREB2A CA protein, we constructed chimeric genes with the synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) gene (CITATION) fused to DREB2A FL cDNA (35S:GFP-DREB2A FL) or DREB2A CA cDNA (35S:GFP-DREB2A CA) (Figure 8A ). The fusion genes were introduced into Arabidopsis plants and were overexpressed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. As a control, the sGFP gene was also overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Two lines of transgenic plants were analyzed for each sGFP-DREB2A construct. The accumulation of mRNA of each fusion gene was almost the same among the four lines of transgenic plants (Figure 8B). However, expression of the RD29A gene in the 35S:GFP-DREB2A FL plants was remarkably lower than that in the 35S:GFP-DREB2A CA plants (Figure 8C). Moreover, in the 35S:GFP-DREB2A FL plants, only very weak green fluorescent signals were observed in the nuclei (Figures 8D and 8E). By contrast, strong green fluorescent signals were clearly observed in the nuclei of the 35S:GFP-DREB2A CA plants (Figures 8D and 8E). These results suggest that the DREB2A CA protein is more stable than the DREB2A FL protein in the nucleus of the transgenic plant. [[FIGURE]]
