!~ABS~! A group of evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS proteins was initially defined by their ability to repress photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. It was proposed that this regulation be mediated by targeting degradation of key cellular regulators that promote photomorphogenesis. Among them, COP1 and the COP9 signalosome have been hypothesized to fulfill the roles as an ubiquitin ligase (E3) and an essential E3 modulator. Here we report that COP10 encodes a protein similar to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) variant proteins (UEV). COP10 is part of a nuclear protein complex and capable of directly interacting with both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome. Our data indicates that COP10 defines a possible E2 activity, thus validating the working hypothesis that the pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS group of proteins defined a protein ubiquitination pathway. 
!~RES~! A total of four mutant alleles of the COP10 locus have been described and are available (Fig. 1a; Materials and Methods). Three of those alleles (cop10-1, cop10-2, and cop10-3) showed a strong photomorphogenic phenotype in darkness and typically result in lethality after the seedling stage even grown under light conditions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Occasionally, a strong cop10 mutant survived on growth medium and developed small and compact rosettes without elongation of leaf petioles, and with sterile flowers (Fig. 1b). The fourth allele, cop10-4, displayed the characteristic open cotyledon phenotype only after extended growth in the dark and was identified in a screen for cytokinin-insensitive mutants (CITATION). There is no observable adult phenotype for light-growncop1-4 mutant plants.  [[FIGURE]] Based on the analysis of 1064 selected F2 plants from the mapping cross (see Materials and Methods), we located theCOP10 locus within a 60-kb region of a P1 clone (Fig. 1d), MRP15, which was completely sequenced by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (GenBank accession no. AP000603). A GENSCAN analysis (genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) of MRP15 predicted a number of open reading frames (ORFs). Database searches revealed that one of them (GenBank protein ID BAB01762), a 546-bp ORF encoding 182 amino acids, has high homology with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2). An expressed sequence tag (EST) containing a portion of the predicted ORF was also found in the database (GenBank accession no. AI999239). RT–PCR and 5′-RACE were performed to obtain the full-length cDNA forCOP10 (GenBank accession no. AY034618), which was sequenced to confirm the ORF prediction. Our previous studies have indicated that both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome are involved in ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-mediated protein degradation (CITATION;CITATION). Thus this E2-like ORF was a prime candidate for COP10. To test whether this candidate gene corresponds toCOP10, the genomic sequences of all four cop10alleles were determined for this region by direct PCR followed by sequencing. Indeed, all four cop10 alleles had single base-pair mutations in the same gene-coding region (Fig. 1e). All three severe alleles contain splicing junction mutations, whereas the weakcop1-4 allele had a nucleotide transition that changed threonine 78 to isoleucine.  To further support the conclusion that this gene corresponds toCOP10, RNA blot analysis was performed using a 3-kb genomic fragment containing the predicted gene. As shown in Figure2a, no significant difference was detected in the level of a 0.9-kb transcript between wild-type and cop10-4seedlings. Conversely, the transcripts from cop10-1,cop10-2, and cop10-3 alleles, all having single base-pair changes in splicing junctions, were reduced in abundance and varied in size compared to transcripts in wild-type seedlings, possibly due to improper splicing. To confirm further the COP10 gene identity, a 3-kb genomic fragment that contains the entire predicted coding region and regulatory sequences was introduced into homozygouscop10-4 mutants and rescued the defects of dark-growncop10-4 seedlings (Fig. 1c). Taken together, these data suggested that the E2-like ORF encode the COP10 protein.  [[FIGURE]] To analyze the COP10 protein, polyclonal antibodies specific for COP10 were raised and used for immunoblot analysis (see Materials and Methods). Immunoblot analysis showed that COP10 migrates as an expected 21-kD protein regardless of light conditions (Fig. 2b,c). Except for the weak cop10-4 allele, which has normal levels of COP10, the abundance of COP10 in the other three cop10 alleles was significantly reduced or undetectable as in the case ofcop10-1. This further confirmed the COP10 gene identity. Interestingly, expression of COP10 in cop9-1 andfus6-1 mutants, which lack COP9 signalosome, was reduced significantly compared to wild type, suggesting that the COP9 signalosome be involved in the regulation of COP10 stability (Fig. 2c). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the levels of COP10 in the cop1-5 and wild-type seedlings. In Arabidopsisadult plants, COP10 levels in flowers and leaves were similar to that in seedlings, but roots had reduced levels of COP10 (Fig. 2d). Thus the COP10 protein is present in all tissues examined albeit at variable levels. Although light or COP1 does not affect the accumulation of COP10, its accumulation depends on the COP9 signalosome.  Data base search with predicted COP10 protein sequence revealed EST clones from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and soybean (Glycine max) that encode proteins highly similar toArabidopsis COP10 (Fig. 3a). The deduced amino acid sequence of COP10 exhibited a high homology with E2 enzymes such as UBC4/UBC5 (52% amino acid identity) fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae and UBC8/UBC9 (48% amino acid identity) from Arabidopsis (Fig. 3a,c). However, the invariant cysteine residue of canonical E2 catalytic domains is replaced by a serine residue in COP10 (Fig. 3b), even though COP10 has all the other conserved amino acids of the catalytic domain of E2 enzymes (Fig.3a,b). This feature of COP10 resembles those of the ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme variant (UEV) proteins defined by TSG101 and MMS2 (or called UEV1) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). However, COP10 is phylogenetically closer to yeast UBC4/UBC5 and Arabidopsis UBC8/UBC9, than to the TSG101 or MMS2 (UEV1) families of UEVs, suggesting that COP10 defines a new group of UEV proteins. As opposed to E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzymes, UEV proteins are themselves inactive E2 variant enzymes that appear to function together with bona fide E2 enzymes (CITATION). For example, UEV1 forms a heterodimer with UBC13, and this complex catalyzes the elongation of unusual polyubiquitin chain in yeast and mammals (CITATION;CITATION; CITATION). Although COP10 is closely related to UBC4 and UBC5 family of E2 enzymes, it fails to rescue the yeast ubc4/ubc5 double mutant (data not shown). This is consistent with the hypothesis that COP10 itself is not an active E2 enzyme and likely works together with other partner(s).  [[FIGURE]] To examine whether COP10 functions as a complex in vivo, gel filtration analysis was performed (Fig. 4a). The majority of COP10 fractionates with an ∼300-kD complex, whereas only small amounts are detected in the fractions corresponding to the 21-kD COP10 monomeric form. The high molecular mass fractions of COP10 were clearly different from that of the COP9 signalosome (Fig. 4a). However, the amount of COP10 complex is greatly reduced in the COP9 signalosome mutants, such as cop9-1 and fus6-1. Furthermore, the molecular mass of the COP10 complex in cop9-1 andfus6-1 mutants was smaller (∼250 kD) compared to the wild type. This suggests that lack of the COP9 signalosome not only reduced the stability of the COP10 complex, but also affected its integrity.  [[FIGURE]] To test for the potential direct interactions between COP10 and the COP9 signalosome or COP1, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed. As shown in Figure 4b, there was a strong interaction between COP10 and the RING finger domain of COP1. This is consistent with previous observations that the RING-finger domain of E3 enzymes is the interacting site for E2 partner (CITATION). The lack of interaction between COP10 and full-length COP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system could be caused by improper conformation of the COP1 in yeast and/or absence of required accessory factors. Furthermore, we have observed interactions between COP10 and three distinct COP9 signalosome subunits (CSN3, CSN4, and CSN8) in our yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting a direct interaction between COP10 and the COP9 signalosome. Therefore, COP10 is potentially capable of direct interactions with both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome, suggesting they work together in mediating the repression of photomorphogenesis.  Because both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome act within the nucleus where they mediate the degradation of the photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factor HY5, we examined whether COP10 also colocalized within the nucleus. To this end, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated from florets of cauliflower and Western blot analysis was performed. As anticipated, COP10 was present abundantly in nuclear fractions and not detectable in cytoplasm (Fig. 4c). This result supports the notion that COP10 acts together with both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome in mediating light-regulated degradation of HY5 within the nucleus. It should be noted that COP10 lacks a recognizable nuclear targeting signal. Thus, the COP10 nuclear localization is likely mediated by other subunits within the COP10 complex. Indeed, a transient expression assay for GUS–COP10 fusion protein in onion epidermal cells resulted in only cytoplasm localization in both light and dark conditions (Fig. 4d). This result implies that COP10 itself does not contain a functional nuclear localization signal. 
!~MM~! All Arabidopsis growth conditions have been described previously (CITATION) unless otherwise stated. The cop10-1(CITATION) and cop10-4 (cin4) (CITATION) mutants were isolated from Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-O) ecotypes, respectively. Both cop10-2 (fus9-T321) andcop10-3 (fus9-U401) were isolated from the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype (CITATION; CITATION).  For the fine-mapping of the COP10 gene, an F2mapping population was generated by crossing heterozygous cop10-2(Ler ecotype) with wild type (Col-O). DNAs isolated from 1076 individual F2 plants were used for SSLP analysis (CITATION). After scoring these 2152 chromosomes, cop10-2was mapped to a region flanked by SSLP marker nga162 and ATHCHIB. Selected BAC or P1 clones in the region were used to generate RFLP markers for further fine mapping using the same F2population. The TAIL–PCR (CITATION) method was used to isolate both the right and left ends of several selected BAC clones for RFLP markers as well. To obtain the full-length cDNA for COP10, 5′-RACE were performed using 5′RACE System 2.0 (GIBCO BRL).  To complement the cop10-4 phenotype, a genomic fragment (from 76,235 bp to 79,840 bp of MRP15) that contains the whole genomic region of COP10 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pPZP221 vector (CITATION). The resulting construct was introduced intocop10-4 plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.  For RNA blot analysis, total RNA from Arabidopsis seedlings was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). Blots were prepared using RNA from equal numbers of seedlings and were probed with radioactively labeled DNA fragments (CITATION).  We generated a polyclonal COP10 antibody by cloning theCOP10 cDNA into the pET28 expression vector (Novagen). The entire ORF of the COP10 cDNA was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-TTCATAT GATGACACCTGGCGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GACTCGAGTCACTTGGCA AATCGCAATG-3′, thereby introducing aNdeI site at the 5′ terminus and an XhoI site at the 3′ terminus. This cDNA fragment was ligated into pET28c. The resulting plasmid pETCOP10 was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. The purified histidine-tagged COP10 protein was injected into rabbits as antigen. Polyclonal anti-COP10 antibodies were purified from rabbit serum using the purified GST–COP10 with glutathione sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia). For immunoblot analysis, 5- to 7-day-old seedlings were homogenized with grinding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10μM leupeptin, 1μg/mL pepstatin A, 10% glycerol). For gel filtration chromatography, 7-day-old seedlings were homogenized in grinding buffer. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and subsequently filtered though a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Total soluble protein was fractionated through a 25 mL Superdex-200 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia) with the grinding buffer. After a 7-mL void volume, consecutive fractions of 0.5 mL each were collected.  Cauliflower floret tissue was fractionated according to a described procedure (CITATION). Briefly, 10 g of cauliflower floret tissue were homogenized in a grinding buffer containing 25 mM Mes-KOH (pH 5.6), 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.35 M sucrose, 30% glycerol, and Complete mini protease inhibitor set (Boehringer) and then centrifuged at 3500g for 10 min. Supernatant was collected as a cytoplasmic fraction. For nuclear fraction, the pellet was further subjected to a Percoll gradient (32%–48%) fractionation.  To generate in-frame fusion to the C-terminal end of the GUS protein, the entire COP10 coding sequence was subcloned into pRTL2–GUS (CITATION). The resulting construct for GUS–COP10 was introduced into onion epidermal cells using a particle bombardment system as described previously (CITATION) with pRTL2–GUS used as a control.  The two-hybrid interaction assay in yeast was performed as described previously (CITATION). Truncated versions of the COP1 and each subunit of COP9 signalosome expression vector in yeast were constructed as described using pEG202 and pJG4-5 (CITATION;CITATION). A β-galactosidase plate assay for yeast was achieved on selection agar plates containing galactose and X-gal in the medium (buffered to pH 7.0). Colonies were allowed to grow at 30°C for 4 d.
