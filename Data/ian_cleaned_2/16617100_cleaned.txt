!~ABS~! The sorting determinants of glycinin, a soybean (Glycine max) 11S globulin, which mediates protein targeting to the protein storage vacuole (PSV), were investigated in maturing soybean cotyledons by transient expression assays. A C-terminal stretch of 10 amino acids of A1aB1b, a glycinin group I subunit, was sufficient to direct green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the PSV. This peptide may correspond to a C-terminal vacuolar sorting determinant (ctVSD). Because functional inhibition of this putative ctVSD of A1aB1b did not block PSV sorting of A1aB1b, we used the three-dimensional structure of A1aB1b to identify candidates for a sequence-specific determinant (ssVSD). We found that the sequence downstream of disordered region 4 could direct GFP to the PSV and that Ile-297 is critical for sorting. However, functional inhibition of the ctVSD, combined with the Ile297Gly mutation, did not abolish the vacuolar sorting of A1aB1b, suggesting that A1aB1b has a third sorting determinant in addition to ctVSD and ssVSD. A glycinin group II subunit, A3B4, lacked a ctVSD but contained a VSD reminiscent of an ssVSD and an additional sorting determinant. We also demonstrate, by expression of dominant negative mutants of small GTPases and drug treatment experiments, that the trafficking of A1aB1b is COPII vesicle–dependent and wortmannin- and brefeldin A–sensitive.
!~RES~! The last 10 amino acids (PQESQKRAVA) at the C terminus of A1aB1b, a group I subunit, are located on the molecular surface (CITATION). The ctVSDs of plant vacuolar proteins are often rich in hydrophobic amino acids, and their lengths and sequences are highly variable (CITATION). Therefore, we first analyzed whether the C-terminal 10 amino acids of A1aB1b are sufficient to direct a reporter protein to the PSV. Previously, we developed a transient expression assay system using particle bombardment of maturing soybean cotyledons. We used GFP modified by adding four contiguous Gly (GGGG) residues to its C terminus (mGFP) as a reporter in the characterization of the VSD of β-conglycinin, another major soybean seed storage protein (CITATION, CITATION). This C-terminal modification of GFP is essential, because the C-terminal region of GFP works weakly as a ctVSD (CITATION, CITATION) and a stretch of contiguous Gly residues was reported to inhibit the function of barley (Hordeum vulgare) lectin ctVSD (CITATION). As a control, we constructed a gene for a fusion protein that consists of the A1aB1b signal peptide and mGFP, and we introduced this plasmid into maturing soybean cotyledon cells by particle bombardment. In the cells expressing mGFP, fluorescence was detected in the nucleoplasm and/or the cytosol (data not shown). This was surprising because, in general, proteins having no VSDs are secreted to intercellular space (ICS). When we expressed a fusion protein that consists of the β-conglycinin signal peptide and mGFP, fluorescence was detected in the ICS (CITATION, CITATION). Thus, we considered that the signal peptide of A1aB1b was not fully functional at the N terminus of mGFP and therefore mGFP might inefficiently penetrate into the ER. Previously, we determined the three-dimensional structure of A1aB1b and demonstrated that six disordered regions exist (CITATION). Among these regions (1, 2, 3, 3′, 4, and 5), the first (disordered region 1) is positioned at the N terminus and consists of nine amino acids. We constructed a gene for a fusion protein that consists of the signal peptide and nine N-terminal amino acids (disordered region 1) of A1aB1b fused to mGFP (dis1+GFP; Figure 1A ). Both the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chitinase and the barley lectin ctVSDs can direct the reporter proteins to the PSV (nonacidic vacuole) (CITATION; CITATION). GFP fused to the lectin ctVSD (GFP:lectin) and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) fused to the chitinase ctVSD (mRFP:chitinase) were colocalized in maturing soybean cotyledon cells (Figure 2A ). Therefore, dis1+GFP was coexpressed with mRFP:chitinase (a PSV marker) in maturing soybean cotyledon cells. In cells expressing both dis1+GFP and mRFP:chitinase, dis1+GFP was detected in a reticular structure reminiscent of the ER as well as the ICS (some cells exhibited fluorescence only in the ICS), whereas mRFP:chitinase was observed only in the PSV (Figure 2B). This finding indicates that disordered region 1 of A1aB1b does not have a VSD. When dis1+GFP was appended to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of A1aB1b (dis1+GFP-CT10), fluorescence was clearly detected in the PSV in all cells expressing dis1+GFP-CT10, and several small puncta were also detected in some cells expressing dis1+GFP-CT10 (Figures 1B and 2C). The patterns of dis1+GFP-CT10 and mRFP:chitinase completely overlapped, indicating that the C-terminal 10 amino acids of A1aB1b can direct mGFP to the PSV. Furthermore, we appended six Gly residues to the C terminus of dis1+GFP-CT10 (dis1+GFP-CT10+Gly; Figure 1C) and introduced this construct into maturing cotyledon cells, because the vacuolar sorting function of ctVSDs is blocked by the addition of contiguous Gly residues. Fluorescence was observed in the ICS but not in the PSV (Figure 2D), indicating that the C-terminal 10 amino acids of A1aB1b work as a ctVSD. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We examined whether or not the C-terminal 10 amino acids were necessary for the sorting of A1aB1b to the PSV. If a truncated glycinin subunit lacking a VSD is expressed in seeds of normal soybean lines, it can assemble with endogenous glycinin subunits and is sorted to the PSV by the VSD of the endogenous glycinin subunits. Thus, it is impossible to analyze the sorting ability of truncated glycinin in seeds of normal soybean lines. Recently, mutant soybean lines lacking glycinin have been developed (CITATION; CITATION). Previously, we analyzed the trafficking of storage proteins to the PSV in the seeds of this glycinin-null line by immunoelectron microscopy and showed that these cells have a normal transport system to the PSV (CITATION). Thus, we examined the sorting of A1aB1b fused at its C terminus with mGFP (GFP modified by adding four contiguous Gly residues to its C terminus) in maturing cotyledon cells of the glycinin-null line (A1aB1bGFP; Figure 1U). We anticipated that the fusion of mGFP to the C terminus of A1aB1b would disrupt deposition in the PSV, because it is essential that ctVSDs are located at the C terminus (CITATION; CITATION). In most cells in which fluorescence was detected, it was observed in both the PSV and the ICS. Approximately 30 to 50% of total fluorescence in a single cell exists in the ICS (Figure 2E). These results suggest that although the C-terminal 10 amino acids of A1aB1b are necessary for efficient sorting to the PSV, A1aB1b contains an additional sorting determinant other than the ctVSD, one that can contribute some vacuolar sorting function. Disordered region 5 is contained within the C-terminal 10 amino acids, which can work as a VSD. The other disordered regions are prime candidates for a second VSD that would act through interaction with a receptor, because they are located on the molecular surface and have flexible structures. The region of A3B4 corresponding to disordered region 3′ of A1aB1b is not disordered (CITATION). Thus, we examined whether or not additional VSDs exist in disordered regions 2, 3, and 4. Castor bean (Ricinus communis) 2S albumin and ricin have ssVSDs located on prolinker regions (CITATION). Characterization of the NPIRL-like motif contained within the ssVSD of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) sporamin in tobacco BY2 cells (CITATION) indicated that the Ile residue in this motif can be replaced only with the Leu residue, whereas other residues are comparatively exchangeable. Similarly, Leu in the prolinker region of castor bean 2S albumin is critical for its vacuolar sorting (CITATION; CITATION). These reports indicate that an Ile or Leu residue located on the molecular surface may play an important role in vacuolar sorting. Therefore, we searched for Leu or Ile residues located on the molecular surface using the three-dimensional structure of A1aB1b (Figure 3 ). Twelve Leu or Ile residues on the molecular surface were found (indicated by boxed letters in Figure 3). However, one of these, Leu-371, which is flanked by residues Ala-370 and Ile-372, has a buried side chain and therefore is unlikely to interact with a receptor. Thus, we tested the potential role of the 11 remaining Leu and Ile residues positioned on the molecular surface as VSDs (Figures 1K to 1R). We also tested the ability of each of the disordered regions to function as a VSD (Figures 1D to 1J). We used mGFP fused to the A1aB1b signal peptide and disordered region 1 at the N terminus (dis1+GFP) as a reporter to analyze the sorting ability of additional regions. To exclude the possibility that these sequences might function as ctVSDs, we added six contiguous Gly residues to the C terminus of each construct. In most constructs, fluorescence was observed only in a reticular structure reminiscent of the ER and the ICS (Figure 1). However, in the case of dis1+GFP appended to disordered region 4 and two adjacent regions, KGGLSVIKP and ICTMRL, which correspond to the N- and C-terminal extensions, respectively, of disordered region 4 (dis1+GFP-ext dis4), we observed fluorescence in the PSV as well as the ICS and the intracellular reticular structure (Figure 4A ). Furthermore, we examined the sorting ability of the isolated SVIKP sequence (dis1+GFP-SVIKP), disordered region 4 (dis1+GFP-dis4), and disordered region 4 fused to the ICTMR peptide (dis1+GFP-dis4+ICTMR). Both dis1+GFP-SVIKP and dis1+GFP-dis4 were secreted to the ICS (Figures 4B and 4C), whereas the fluorescence of dis1+GFP-dis4-ICTMR was detected in the PSV as well as the ICS and the internal reticular structures (Figure 4D). Interestingly, the sorting ability of dis1+GFP-dis4-ICTMR was almost completely abolished by the replacement of Ile in the sequence ICTMR with Gly (dis1+GFP-dis4+GCTMR; Figures 1J and 4E). Thus, Ile in dis1+GFP-dis4-ICTMR is critical for directing mGFP to the PSV, and this sequence might work as a VSD reminiscent of an ssVSD. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we examined whether or not the mutation of this critical Ile residue downstream of disordered region 4 affected the sorting ability of A1aB1b fused at its C terminus with mGFP (A1aB1bGFP/I297G, Figure 1V). Fluorescence was observed in both the PSV and the ICS (Figure 4F), similar to the case with A1aB1bGFP (Figure 2E). Thus, the contribution of this putative ssVSD to the vacuolar sorting of A1aB1b is low, and yet another VSD in addition to the ctVSD and the ssVSD likely exists in A1aB1b. Previously, we showed that truncated α′ and α subunits (α′ and α core regions) of β-conglycinin (CITATION) and the modified proglycinin A1aB1b (CITATION) can fold correctly when expressed in Escherichia coli and that such proteins can fold correctly in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) (CITATION) and Arabidopsis (CITATION) seeds. Thus, we believe that E. coli expression systems can be used to judge whether or not truncated proteins are likely to fold correctly in soybean seed cells. If A1aB1bGFP and its derivative can fold correctly in the E. coli expression system, we can rule out potential sorting defects arising from the conformational defects that might be induced by fusion with mGFP. First, we expressed A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G in E. coli Origami(DE3). Both A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G were expressed in E. coli and were almost completely soluble (data not shown). To confirm correct folding, we then analyzed their self-assembly and fluorescence arising from GFP chromophores. Extracts produced by sonication were applied to a Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column, and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-glycinin serum (Figure 5A ). The peaks of recombinant A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G were detected in fractions 10 to 12 (the elution time of fraction 11 was ∼112.5 min). Under the same conditions, purified mature glycinin (hexamer; ∼320 kD) and proglycinin A1aB1b (trimer; 160 kD) were eluted at 102.5 and 122.0 min, respectively. If A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G self-assemble into trimers similarly to proglycinin A1aB1b, the molecular mass of each should be 242 kD. Thus, the elution times on the gel filtration column indicate that A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G self-assembled into trimers. Finally, we compared the fluorescence profiles of the GFP chromophores of A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G in fraction 11 with that of GFP (Figure 5B). The excitation and emission spectra of fraction 11 containing A1aB1bGFP or A1aB1bGFP/I297G were almost identical to those of GFP reported previously (CITATION). Thus, GFP and A1aB1b in A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G folded properly, and the fusion proteins self-assembled into trimers similarly to proglycinin in E. coli. These results imply that A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G are likely to fold correctly in maturing soybean cotyledon cells in our transient assay. Therefore, we consider it credible that A1aB1bGFP/I297G was sorted to the PSV via a third determinant. [[FIGURE]] Previously, we determined the three-dimensional structure of A3B4, a group II subunit, and demonstrated that the overall structure of A3B4 is very similar to that of A1aB1b (CITATION). However, the sequence corresponding to the ctVSD of A1aB1b (PQESQKARAVA) does not exist in A3B4, and only a C-terminal Pro residue is exposed on the molecular surface. Nonetheless, A3B4 is correctly sorted to the PSV in seeds of the soybean group I and A5A4B3 null lines (only A3B4 exists as a glycinin subunit) (CITATION), suggesting that A3B4 has a VSD distinct from a ctVSD. First, to confirm this, we examined the sorting ability of A3B4 fused at its C terminus with mGFP (A3B4GFP, Figure 1W). Although the fluorescence of A1aB1bGFP was detected in the PSV and the ICS (Figure 2E), we observed fluorescence of A3B4GFP only in the PSV and not in the ICS (Figure 6A ). Next, we investigated whether or not the region of A3B4 that corresponds to disordered region 4 appended to the sequence ICTMR of A1aB1b contains a VSD (dis1+GFP-A3B4dis4+ICTMK, Figure 1S). Fluorescence was detected in the PSV as well as in an internal reticular structure reminiscent of the ER (Figure 6B). It seems that the rate for PSV sorting of dis1+GFP-A3B4dis4+ICTMK was slower than that of dis1+GFP-dis4-ICTMR (Figure 1I). This difference in rate might be attributable to the difference in the sequence. Furthermore, we confirmed that the replacement of the Ile residue (the 326th residue from the N terminus of A3B4) in dis1+GFP-A3B4dis4+ICTMK by Gly (dis1+GFP-A3B4dis4+GCTMK, Figure 1T) completely abolished sorting to the PSV (Figure 6C). Therefore, the sequence downstream of disordered region 4 of A3B4 contains a VSD reminiscent of an ssVSD. The replacement of the Ile residue in the sequence ICTMK of A3B4GFP by Gly (A3B4GFP/I326G, Figure 1X) did not affect the sorting of A3B4GFP to PSVs at all (Figure 6D), suggesting that another VSD exists, possibly similar to the third VSD of A1aB1b. [[FIGURE]] Drugs such as brefeldin A (BFA) and wortmannin have been used to analyze trafficking mechanisms along the secretory pathway (CITATION). First, we examined the effect of BFA, which induces an ER/Golgi apparatus hybrid organelle in tobacco BY2 cultured cells (CITATION), on the sorting of dis1+GFP-CT10 and A1aB1bGFP/I297G. Previously, Arabidopsis β1,2-xylosyltransferase (CITATION) and rat sialyltransferase (CITATION) fused to fluorescent proteins were used as markers for the Golgi apparatus in tobacco BY2 cultured cells and/or leaf epidermal cells. Thus, to confirm the Golgi apparatus localization of these fusions in soybean cotyledons, we examined the localization of Arabidopsis β1,2-xylosyltransferase fused to mRFP (Xyl:mRFP) and rat sialyltransferase fused to GFP (ST:GFP). As expected, both showed spindle-like structures, which likely correspond to the Golgi apparatus, and completely overlapped each other (Figure 7A ). Thus, we used Xyl:mRFP as a Golgi apparatus marker in further experiments. dis1+GFP-CT10 and Xyl:mRFP were located in PSVs and spindle-like structures, respectively, in maturing soybean cotyledon cells cultured in medium without BFA (Figure 7B). However, in the presence of BFA, Xyl:mRFP showed a reticular pattern consistent with the redistribution of Golgi protein to the ER upon treatment with BFA, as reported previously (CITATION) (Figure 7C). However, unlike Xyl:mRFP, dis1+GFP-CT10 accumulated in globular structures and colocalized with an ER marker, mRFP-HDEL (Figure 7E). In the absence of BFA, mRFP-HDEL showed a characteristic ER reticular pattern (Figure 7D). A1aB1bGFP/I297G exhibited patterns similar to those of dis1+GFP-CT10 (Figures 8A to 8D ). These results imply that BFA induces a redistribution of Golgi proteins to a reticular ER-like structure in maturing soybean cotyledon cells, as reported previously in tobacco BY2 cells (CITATION). Furthermore, BFA treatment causes some ER residents to condense into globular structures in which both PSV and secreted proteins were localized, perhaps corresponding to an exaggerated subdomain in the ER/Golgi apparatus hybrid organelle. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we examined the effect of wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase inhibitor. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that dis1+GFP-CT10 accumulated in punctate structures of various sizes inside maturing cotyledon cells treated with wortmannin. It was reported previously that the pea vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) colocalizes with the endogenous tobacco VSR when the heterologous reporter was expressed in tobacco suspension culture cells and that this organelle corresponds to the prevacuolar compartment (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, to examine the punctate structures containing dis1+GFP-CT10 formed by wortmannin treatment, we used mRFP fused to Arabidopsis VSR1 (mRFP:VSR) and Xyl:mRFP as a prevacuolar compartment marker and a Golgi apparatus marker, respectively. We confirmed that mRFP:VSR was detected in punctate structures and was not colocalized with Arabidopsis β1,2-xylosyltransferase fused to yellow fluorescent protein (Xyl:YFP; a Golgi apparatus marker) in maturing soybean cotyledon cells in either the absence or the presence of wortmannin (Figures 9A and 9B ). When mRFP:VSR and dis1+GFP-CT10 were coexpressed in the presence of wortmannin, ∼80% of puncta (Figure 9D, arrowheads) containing dis1+GFP-CT10 were colocalized with mRFP:VSR. On the other hand, when Xyl:mRFP and dis1+GFP-CT10 were coexpressed, only ∼10% of the puncta (Figure 9E, arrowheads) containing dis1+GFP-CT10 were colocalized with Xyl:mRFP. A1aB1bGFP/I297G exhibited patterns similar to those of dis1+GFP-CT10 (Figures 10A to 10C ). Thus, we interpret these patterns as evidence that the sorting of dis1+GFP-CT10 and A1aB1bGFP/I297G to the PSV and the ICS was blocked at several steps between the Golgi apparatus and the PSV and that both of these proteins accumulate predominantly in a prevacuolar compartment in the presence of wortmannin. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Recently, dominant negative mutants of small GTPases such as SAR/ARF/RAB have been used to analyze membrane traffic in plant cells (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). We confirmed that mRNAs of SAR1 and ARF1 are synthesized in maturing Arabidopsis seed cells by RT-PCR (data not shown). To examine the effects of Arabidopsis sar1 and arf1 dominant negative mutants (sar1[H74L] and arf1[Q71L]), plasmids encoding dominant negative mutants and dis1+GFP-CT10 or A1aB1bGFP/I297G were transiently coexpressed in maturing soybean cotyledon cells. We observed no effect of the coexpression of wild-type SAR1 or ARF1 on vacuolar sorting (Figures 11A, 11C , 12A, and 12C ). However, upon coexpression of sar1[H74L], dis1+GFP-CT10 and A1aB1bGFP/I297G displayed a punctal and reticular pattern in all cells, indicating that vacuolar sorting was clearly inhibited (Figures 11B and 12B). Furthermore, arf1[Q71L] exhibited similar effects (Figures 11D and 12D). These results indicate that our transient expression assay can be applied to analyze the effect of dominant negative mutants of small GTPases and that SAR1 and ARF1 are involved in the vacuolar sorting of A1aB1b to the PSV in soybean cotyledon cells.

!~MM~! Constructs used in this work are shown in Figure 1 (not to scale). All constructs contain the promoter of the β-conglycinin α′ subunit (−963 to −1). We first constructed the A1aB1b signal peptide fused to GFP. To construct it, we used the following primers, 5′-AAAACAAAGGGAAAAAACTAGCTTGGCCATAGTATATCTTAAATTCTTTAATACGGTG-3′ (the italic and underlined letters correspond to half of the signal peptide of A1aB1b and the 3′ terminal region of the α′ subunit promoter, respectively) and 5′-CTGCTTTTCAGTGGCTGCTGCTTCGCTGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTCACC-3′ (the italic and underlined letters correspond to half of the signal peptide of A1aB1b and the 5′ terminal region of the GFP coding sequence, respectively). This DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using pBSspmGFP (CITATION) (the α′ subunit promoter, GFP fused to four contiguous Gly residues at its C terminus, and the nopaline synthase [nos] terminator were inserted into pBluescript SK−) as a template. The amplified fragment was self-ligated to construct pBSA1aB1bspmGFP. Furthermore, to construct dis1+GFP, we used two primers, 5′-TTGCTGAGGCTGCTCTCTGGAACTGAAAGCGAAGCAGCAGCCACTGAAAAGCAGAAAACAAAGGGAAAA-3′ (the italic and underlined letters indicate disordered region 1 and the signal peptide of A1aB1b, respectively) and 5′-GTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC-3′ (corresponding to the 5′ terminal region of GFP) for PCR using pBSA1aB1bspmGFP as a template. To construct dis1+GFP-CT10, we used two primers, 5′-TAGGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTT-3′ (the stop codon is indicated by boldface letters) and 5′-AGCCACAGCTCTCTTCTGAGACTCCTGAGGTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ (the italic and underlined letters indicate A1aB1b C-terminal 10 amino acids and the 3′ terminal region of GFP, respectively). The amplified fragment was self-ligated. Next, to construct dis1+GFP-CT10+Gly, dis1+GFP-dis2, dis1+GFP-ext dis3, dis1+GFP-SVIKP, dis1+GFP-NALKP, dis1+GFP-DNRIESE, dis1+GFP-TNSLENQLDQ, dis1+GFP-TLE, dis1+GFP-QTSSPDIYNPQ, dis1+GFP-TSLD, dis1+GFP-LNGR, and dis1+GFP-DTPMI, we used dis1+GFP-CT10 as a template and the primer 5′-GGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGATAGGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTT-3′ (the underlined and boldface letters indicate the sequences for six contiguous Gly residues and the stop codon, respectively) with the specific primers 5′-AGCCACAGCTCTCTTCTGAGACTCCTGAGGTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-CT10+Gly, 5′-TTGTGGTCTGCTGCTTTGTCCTCTTTGTTGAGGTTGTTGAGGCTCTTCAAATCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-dis2, 5′-TTCGTTTTCTTCTTCTTGCTGATGCTTTCCTTTCTGGCTTTGATGACCTCCTTGCTCTTGCTGATATTTTAGAAACTCTTGCTCTTGGTTCCCTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-ext dis3, 5′-TGGTTTTATCACGCTTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-SVIKP, 5′-CGGTTTGAGGGCATTTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-NALKP, 5′-TTCTGACTCTATACGGTTATCTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-DNRIESE, 5′-CTGGTCGAGCTGGTTCTCCAAGCTGTTGGTTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-TNSLENQLDQ, 5′-TTCCAGGGTTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ dis1+GFP-TLE, 5′-TTGAGGGTTGTAGATGTCAGGTGATGAAGTCTGTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-QTSSPDIYNPQ, 5′-GTCAAGGCTGGTTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-TSLD, 5′-CCGTCCATTCAATCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-LNGR, and 5′-GATCATGGGTGTATCTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT-3′ for dis1+GFP-DTPMI (the underlined and italic letters indicate the 3′ terminal region of GFP and the specific region, respectively). The amplified fragments were self-ligated. To construct dis1+GFP-dis4, dis1+GFP-ext dis4, dis1+GFP-dis4+ICTMR, and dis1+GFP-A3B4dis4+ICTMK, we amplified a DNA fragment for the α′ subunit promoter, the signal peptide and disordered region 1 of A1aB1b, the GFP coding region fused to four Gly residues, and the nos terminator using dis1+GFP as a template and the following primers: 5′-TCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′ (the underlined and italic letters indicate the sequences for the four Gly residues and the C-terminal region of GFP, respectively) and 5′-GGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGATAGGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTT-3′ (the boldface and underlined letters indicate the stop codon and the 5′ terminal region of the nos terminator with the NotI site, respectively). To amplify disordered region 4 and its extended version, we used the following primers: 5′-CCCACGGACGAGCAGCAACAAAGAC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTCGTCAATGCCATTTCTTCTT-3′ for dis1+GFP-dis4, 5′-AGCGTGATAAAACCACCCACGGACGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-AAGTCTCATGGTGCATATGGTCTCGTCAATGCC-3′ for dis1+GFP-ext dis4, and 5′-CCCACGGACGAGCAGCAACAAAGACCCCAGGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-TCTCATGGTGCATATGGTCTCGTCAATGCC-3′ for dis1+GFP-dis4+ICTMR. To amplify disordered region 4 with ICTMK of A3B4, we used the following primers: 5′-AAGTGGCAAGAACAAGAAGACGAAGACGAA-3′ and 5′-CTTCATGGTGCAAATATTTTCCTCAACCCC-3′. The fragment corresponding to disordered region 4 or its extended version was ligated to the DNA fragment for the α′ subunit promoter, the signal peptide and disordered region 1 of A1aB1b, the GFP coding region, and the nos terminator. To construct dis1+GFP-dis4+GCTMR, we used dis1+GFP-dis4+ICTMR as a template and the following primers: 5′-ATTTCTTCTGCTTTTGCTTTGGCTTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGCATTGACGAGACCGGATGCACCATGAGA-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the mutation site). To construct dis1+GFP-A3B4dis4+GCTMK, the following primers were used: 5′-ATTTCTAGTCTGACATCCTCT-3′ and 5′-GGGGTTGAGGAAAATATTGGCACCATGAAG-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the mutation site). The amplified fragments were self-ligated. To construct A1aB1bGFP and A3B4GFP, we first amplified the DNA fragments for the α′ subunit promoter and the A1aB1b and A3B4 coding regions by PCR using the following pairs of primers: 5′-CGGGGATCCGTTTTCAAATTTGAATTTTAATGTGTGTTGTAAG-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the BamHI site) and 5′-AGTATATCTTAAATTCTTTAATAC-3′ for the α′ subunit promoter, 5′-ATGGCCAAGCTTGTTTTTTCCCTTT-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCCTAAGCCACAGCTCTCTTCTGAGACTCC-3′ for the A1aB1b coding region (the boldface letters indicate the NotI site), and 5′-ATGGGGAAGCCCTTCTTCACTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTATGGGTTGACCAAAGGGCCGGAGTTTC-3′ for the A3B4 coding region (the boldface letters indicate the NotI site). The PCR products were digested by BamHI or NotI. The resultant DNA fragments (the α′ promoter plus the A1aB1b coding region or the α′ promoter plus the A3B4 coding region) were inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of pUC18 containing the nos terminator. Next, we inserted GFP at the C terminus of the coding region of A1aB1b or A3B4. The following pairs of primers were used to amplify the α′ promoter and the A1aB1b coding region inserted into pUC18 with the nos terminator: 5′-TAGGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTTC-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the stop codon) and 5′-AGCCACAGCTCTCTTCTGAGACTCC-3′ corresponded to the C-terminal region of A1aB1b for A1aB1bGFP and 5′-TAGGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTTC-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the stop codon) and 5′-TGGGTTGACCAAAGGGCCGGAGTTTC-3′ for A3B4GFP. The GFP coding region was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTCA-3′ and 5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGT-3′. The PCR product for the GFP coding region was ligated to construct the plasmid for A1aB1bGFP or A3B4GFP. The direction of the inserted fragment was checked by PCR. To construct A1aB1bGFP/I297G, the fragment was amplified by the following primers: 5′-ATTTCTTCTGCTTTTGCTTTGGCTTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGCATTGACGAGACCGGATGCACCATGAGA-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the mutation site). To construct A3B4GFP/I326G, the fragment was amplified by the following primers: 5′-CTCAACCCCATTTCTAGTCTGACATCCTCTTCCACGTGG-3′ and 5′-GAAAATATTGGCACCATGAAGCTTCACGAG-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the mutation site). The sequences of the promoter and the coding regions were confirmed by ABI Prism 310 and ABI 3100 avant DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems). We constructed the expression plasmids for GFP fused to the barley (Hordeum vulgare) lectin C-terminal propeptide (GFP:lectin), mRFP fused to the chitinase C-terminal propeptide (mRFP:chitinase), mRFP fused to the ER retention signal (mRFP:HDEL), mRFP fused to the Arabidopsis thaliana β-1,2-xylosyltransferase transmembrane and cytosolic domains (Xyl:mRFP), GFP fused to rat sialyltransferase cytosolic and transmembrane domains (ST:GFP), and Arabidopsis VSR1 transmembrane and cytosolic domains fused to mRFP (mRFP:VSR). To generate the construct for GFP:lectin, we amplified the DNA fragment using two primers (5′-CAACTCCACTCTTGTCGCAGAATGAGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTTCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GCGGCGATGGCCTCGGCGAAGACTCCTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGTGAT-3′; the underlined letters correspond to the sequences for the lectin C-terminal propeptide). To construct the plasmid for ST:GFP, we sequentially amplified DNA fragments using four different primer combinations: (1) 5′-GAACTTTTTCTTCAAGTTGGTATGAATCATAGTATATCTTAAATTCTTTAATACGGTGTA-3′ and 5′-CAGATGCCCAAGAGCCAGGAGAAAGTGGCCGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTCACCGGG-3′; (2) 5′-GAACAGGAGAAAGACCAGGATGAAGAGGCTGAACTTTTTCTTCAAGTTGGTATGAATCAT-3′ and 5′-GAGGCCCTTACACTGCAAGCCAAGGAATTCCAGATGCCCAAGAGCCAGGAGAAAGTGGCC-3′; (3) 5′-CCAAACACAGATGACTGCGAACAGGAGAAAGACCAGGATGAAGAGGCT-3′ and 5′-AAGAAAGGGAGCGACTATGAGGCCCTTACACTGCAAGCCAAGGAATTC-3′; and (4) 5′-CAAGCCAAGGAATTCCAGATGCCCAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTGTAAGGGCCTCATAGTCGCTCCCTTTC-3′. The resultant amplified fragments were self-ligated. This plasmid contains the sequence for the N-terminal 52 amino acids of the rat sialyltransferase. To generate the plasmids for mRFP:chitinase and mRFP:HDEL, we first constructed the plasmid containing the sequences corresponding to the promoter and signal peptide of β-conglycinin α′, the mRFP coding region, six Gly residues, and the nos terminator (pBSpro-sp-mRFP-nos). To generate the plasmid for mRFP:HDEL, we amplified the DNA fragment using the two primers 5′-GAGTTCGTCGTGCCTCCTCCTCCTCCTCCGGCGCCGGTGGAGTGGCGGCCCTCGGCGCG-3′ and 5′-TAGGGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGCACGTTCAAAC-3′ and pBSpro-sp-mRFP-nos as a template. On the other hand, to generate the plasmid for mRFP:chitinase, we used the two primers 5′-AAGAAGACCTCCTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′ and 5′-GTCGATACAATGTGAGCGGCCCGGCTGCAGATCGTTCAAAC-3′. The plasmids for mRFP:HDEL and mRFP:chitinase contain the sequences for the C-terminal propeptide (GLLVDTM) of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chitinase and the ER retention signal (HDEL), respectively. To generate the plasmid for Xyl:mRFP, the annealed DNA fragment corresponding to the N-terminal 35 amino acids of Arabidopsis β1,2-xylosyltransferase (5′-ATGAGTAAACGGAATCCGAAGATTCTGAAGATTTTTCTGTATATGTTACTTCTCAACTCTCTCTTTCTCATCTACTTCGTTTTTCACTCATCGTCGTTTTCA-3′ and 5′-TGAAAACGACGATGAGTGAAAAAACGAAGTAGATGATGAGAAAGAGAGAGTTGAGAAGTAACATATACAGAAAAATCTTCAGAATCTTCGGATTCCGTTTACTCAT-3′) was inserted between the promoter of β-conglycinin α′ promoter and mRFP in pBSpro-sp-mRFP-nos. To generate mRFP:VSR, we amplified the DNA fragment using the primers 5′-ACTTGCATAGGTTCAGGCAAAGTTGGAACC-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCATATATCCATATGGTGACCACTTGTGTT-3′ and the cDNA of Arabidopsis VSR1 (RIKEN Bioresource Center; identification code pda04573) as a template. Amplified fragment digested by NotI was inserted between the mRFP coding region and the nos terminator in pBSpro-sp-mRFP-nos. The resultant plasmid contains the sequence corresponding to the C-terminal 72 amino acids of VSR1. Sequences of the promoter and coding regions were confirmed by ABI Prism 310 and ABI 3100 avant DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems). The DNA for SAR1 and ARF1 subcloned by PCR from an Arabidopsis mRNA (CITATION, CITATION) was from the RIKEN Bioresource Center (identification codes pda06812 and pda07393). The coding regions of SAR1 and ARF1 were amplified by the following primers: 5′-ATGTTCTTGTTCGATTGGTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGCCCGCTTAGTTGATGTACTGAGAGAGCC-3′ for SAR1 and 5′-ATGGGGTTGTCATTCGGAAAGTTG-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCCTATGCCTTGCTTGCGATGTTGTTG-3′ for ARF1 (the boldface letters indicate the NotI site). The plasmids containing the α′ promoter and the nos terminator were amplified by the following primers: 5′-AGTATATCTTAAATTCTTTAATAC-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTTAGGCGGCCGCCTGCAGATCGTTCAAACATTTGG-3′, respectively (the boldface letters indicate the NotI site). To construct plasmids to express SAR1 and ARF1, the DNA fragments for SAR1 and ARF1 coding regions were digested by NotI and ligated with the plasmid containing the α′ promoter and the nos terminator. To construct the dominant negative mutants of SAR1 and ARF1 (sar1[H74L] and arf1[Q71L]), mutations were introduced by the following primers: 5′-ATCTGAAGACCACCCAAATCAAAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTCGTAGGGTTTGGAAAGATTAC-3′ for sar1[H74L] and 5′-ATCTTGTCTAGACCCCCAACATCCC-3′ and 5′-CCGTCCATTGTGGAGACATTACTTC-3′ for arf1[Q71L] (the boldface letters indicate the mutation sites). The amplified fragments were self-ligated. Sequences of the promoter and coding regions were confirmed by ABI Prism 310 and ABI 3100 avant DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems). Maturing soybean (Glycine max) cotyledons were taken out of their pods and immersed in 70% (v/v) ethanol to sterilize their surfaces. After rinsing with sterile water, they were cut into halves and placed on Murashige and Skoog agar plates. Particle bombardment was performed with Biolistic PDS-1000/He (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Five hundred micrograms of gold microcarriers (particle size of 1.0 μm) coated with 2 to 3 μg of plasmids was used for each bombardment. To examine the dominant negative effects of SAR1 and ARF1, ∼1 μg of dis1+GFP-CT10 or A1aB1bGFP/I297G was mixed with ∼2 μg of the plasmids for the dominant negative mutants, and then gold microcarriers were coated with them. Each sample was bombarded twice under the following conditions: vacuum, 26 to 28 inches of Hg; target distance, 9 cm; and helium pressure, 1100 p.s.i. After the bombardment, cotyledons were placed on the B5 agar plates and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 24 to 35 h. In the experiments for the drugs, wortmannin or BFA dissolved in DMSO was added to B5 medium. In control experiments, we added the same amount of DMSO as that of BFA or wortmannin to B5 medium. Thin sections (<1 mm) cut with razor blades from the surfaces of the soybean cotyledons that had been bombarded and incubated were placed on glass slides and covered with cover glasses. Fluorescent images were obtained using an MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). GFP was excited at a laser wavelength of 488 nm and detected through a filter for a laser wavelength of 506 to 538 nm. We checked >25 cells for each construct, and typical patterns are shown in Figures 2, 4, 6, and 7 to 12⇑⇑⇑⇑⇑. DNA fragments for the coding regions of A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G were amplified by the following primers: 5′-TTCAGTTCCAGAGAGCAGCCTCAGC-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCAAGCCACAGCTCTCTTCTGAGACTCC-3′ (the boldface letters indicate the NotI site). The PCR products were blunted and then digested with NotI. The resultant DNA fragments were inserted into the NcoI (filled-in) and NotI sites of pET-21d vector to construct the expression plasmids pEA1aB1bGFP and pEA1aB1bGFP/I297G. pEA1aB1bGFP and pEA1aB1bGFP/I297G were transformed into E. coli Origami(DE3) (Novagen). Cells harboring individual expression plasmids were grown to A600 = 0.6 at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium before induction of expression with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, culture was continued for 30 to 36 h at 20°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000g for 20 min at 4°C and stored at −80°C. Aliquots of the cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 11% (w/v) acrylamide as described previously (CITATION). Translational products were identified by immunoblotting. Frozen cells were resuspended in buffer A [35 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% NaN3] and disrupted by sonication on ice. Insoluble materials were separated from the soluble fractions by centrifugation at 10,000g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for a self-assembly experiment. To analyze self-assembly, extracts from E. coli expressing A1aB1bGFP or A1aB1bGFP/I297G were subjected to Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Bioscience) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using buffer A as an eluent. Fractions were collected every 5 min (2.5 mL) between 60 and 160 min. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-glycinin serum. Fluorescence intensities arising from A1aB1bGFP and A1aB1bGFP/I297G were measured in a Hitachi F-3000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 700 nm at an excitation wavelength of 489 nm. The excitation spectra were recorded from 300 to 700 nm at an emission wavelength of 511 nm.
