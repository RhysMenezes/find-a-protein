!~ABS~! Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) play an important role in the regulation of translation and the control of mRNA stability in eukaryotes, and their functions are known to be essential in many organisms. PABPs contain a highly conserved C-terminal segment termed the PABC domain. The PABC domain from human PABP interacts with the proteins PAIP1, PAIP2 and RF3 via its PAM2 motifs. These interactions are important for modulating translation. Arabidopsis has eight PABPs, an unexpectedly large number in comparison to other eukaryotes whose genomes have been sequenced. Six of the Arabidopsis PABPs contain the conserved PABC domain. In this work, we have identified PABC-interacting proteins in Arabidopsis. Two proteins, which we named CID1 and CID7, were initially isolated in a two-hybrid screen, and eleven more were predicted to be present in the Arabidopsis proteome and eleven in the rice proteome. Among the 24 PAM2-containing proteins in this set, we observed a diversity of modules of intriguing function, ranging from acidic regions similar to the PAM1 motif found in human PAIP1 and PAIP2, to domains such as the small MutS-related domain, the Lsm domains of Ataxin-2, and RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). We suggest that the large number of PABPs and PAM2-containing proteins may have evolved to provide plants with greater flexibility in modulating the metabolism of specific transcripts. We also found that two PABP genes, PAB2 (ubiquitously expressed) and PAB5 (expressed in reproductive tissues), are essential for viability, suggesting that each has a vital and specific function.
!~RES~! To obtain insights into the biological functions of PABPs in Arabidopsis we decided to search for interaction partners. Since the PABC domain of the human PABP was previously shown to mediate specific protein interactions, we reasoned that plant proteins might also use this domain as an interaction module. The PABC domain is highly conserved among diverse species. Sequence homology analysis of the eight Arabidopsis PABP genes showed that six of them contained the PABC domain and that this domain is very similar to its counterparts in the human and S. cerevisiae PABPs (see Fig. 1). The PABC domain is also present in other plant species; for instance, the rice proteome contains four PABP genes that encode PABC domains (see Fig. 1). [[FIGURE]]  A segment including the C-terminal end of PAB2 of Arabidopsis was used as bait in a search for interacting proteins in a two-hybrid screen (Gietz and Woods CITATION), as described in Materials and methods. Two classes of clones were obtained as strong interactors after screening about 1×106 transformants. One class was found 13 times and the other class three times. Sequence analysis revealed that these corresponded to two apparently unrelated genes that we named CID1 and CID7 (for CTC-Interacting Domain). Unexpectedly, the cDNA inserts selected were found to be inserted in the two-hybrid vector in unexpected ways. For both CID1 and CID7, inserts that were in the sense orientation included segments of 5′ untranslated regions that harbored several stop codons. Thus, in these cases, no hybrid protein fused to the Gal4p activation domain could be produced (Fig. 2a, clones in the sense orientation). In addition, for both CID1 and CID7 we obtained inserts in the antisense orientation with respect to the expected direction of transcription of the promoter in the vector (Fig. 2a, clones in the antisense orientation). The fact that both orientations were obtained in the two-hybrid system was intriguing. To examine the possibility that this result was revealing a bona fide interaction, CID1 and CID7 cDNAs were cloned in frame with the AD sequence in the two-hybrid vector (Fig. 2a, in frame clones). In both situations a positive interaction was obtained, indicating that CID1 and CID7 were interacting with PABC in this system. Then the GAL4 AD was removed from the in-frame clones and the interaction was again tested. Again, with both clones a positive interaction occurred, suggesting that it was independent of the AD of Gal4p, and thus that the Arabidopsis inserts themselves encoded sequences that function as activation domains in yeast. Since cDNA inserts were also obtained in the antisense orientation we reasoned that, in such cases, readthrough transcription originating from the LEU2 promoter must lead to the expression of CID1 and CID7 (Fig. 2b). [[FIGURE]]  The screen for PABC interacting clones was carried out in the presence of 5 mM 3-AT, but we found that the interactions were maintained at concentrations up to 100 mM 3-AT, both for the original clones selected and for the CID1 and CID7 sequences cloned in frame with the GAL4 AD (data not shown), indicating that these were strong interactions. The ability of CID1 and CID7 to interact with the full-length PAB2 was also tested; the expected interaction was observed, but only up to 30 mM 3-AT, suggesting that there is some element in the full-length protein, possibly the RNA-binding domains, that interferes with, and weakens, the interaction (data not shown). Inspection of the predicted CID1 and CID7 gene products revealed that both types of clones contain a domain that is highly similar to the PABC-interacting domain found in the human proteins Paip1 and Paip2 (Khaleghpour et al. CITATION; Roy et al. CITATION). This domain, known as PAM2 (PABP-interacting motif 2), consists of a 15-residue sequence that has been demonstrated to bind to the PABC domain (Khaleghpour et al. CITATION; Roy et al. CITATION). PAM2-related sequences were found at the N-terminal ends of CID1 and CID7 (Fig. 3). Sequence analysis showed that 10 and 11 residues of CID1 and CID7, respectively, were either conserved or identical to the 15 residues of the PAM2 domain of Paip2 (Fig. 3). This observation suggests that PAM2 sequences are present in Arabidopsis proteins and that they may be mediating the interaction with PABC. Since CID1 and CID7 mediate an interaction with Arabidopsis PABC independently of the activation domain present in the two-hybrid vector, we also looked for sequences that resemble transcription activation domains in these genes. Activation domains in eukaryotes can be identified by their content of glutamine, proline or acidic residues (Uesugi et al. CITATION). We readily identified discrete acidic modules in CID1 (amino acids 72–102) and CID7 (207–262) (see Fig. 3a). We speculate that such regions may function as activation domains in yeast, thus bypassing the requirement for the Gal4p AD for reporter gene activity. [[FIGURE]]  To obtain further support for the involvement of the PAM2-like sequences in the interaction, we tested the interaction of PABC with discrete fragments of CID1 and CID7 in the two-hybrid assay. Fragments that included the PAM2 domain but not the acidic modules were able to interact with PABC. Conversely, fragments that contained the acidic module or other regions of the proteins, but not the PAM-2 like sequence, showed no interaction (see Fig. 3b, c). To further demonstrate the participation of the PAM2-like sequences, a deletion mutant was generated in which five residues (STLNP) from the core sequence from CID1 were eliminated. The result of the two-hybrid assay showed that the ability to interact with PABC was lost, indicating that the interaction of PABC with CID1 was specific and that the deleted residues were important in mediating the binding (see Δ PAM2 in Fig. 3b). Two independent domains in human Paip1 and Paip2 interact with PABPs. In addition to the PAM2 motif that recognizes the PABC, acidic regions referred to as PAM1 bind to the RRMs of PABP. In Paip1, the interaction occurs with a segment containing RRMs 1 and 2, and in Paip2 with a region containing RRMs 2 and 3. We wanted to establish if other interacting domains were also present in CID1 and CID7, and if so, whether they could be detected by the two-hybrid assay. We therefore expressed segments of PAB2 containing different RRM regions, and tested their ability to interact with fragments of CID1 and CID7. In the case of CID1, no interaction with the RRM-containing segments was detected, and in the case of CID7 only weak interactions were observed. The physiological relevance of the latter interaction is thus uncertain (data not shown). A GenBank search indicated that although CID1 and CID7 are unique genes in Arabidopsis, eleven more genes encoding putative PABP-interacting proteins could be predicted in this plant. In addition, since most of the rice genome has been sequenced, we examined whether CID genes were also conserved in this monocot plant. We found that eleven genes related to the Arabidopsis genes can be predicted in the rice genome. A dendrogram indicating the similarity between these genes and showing the region containing the PAM2 motif is depicted in Fig. 4. [[FIGURE]]  To establish whether the predicted PAM2 domains were indeed able to mediate interaction with the Arabidopsis PABC, we again turned to the two-hybrid assay. Coding fragments encompassing the predicted PAM2 domains from four proteins were fused to the sequence for the Gal4p DNA-binding domain in a yeast two-hybrid vector. We tested the interaction of the products of these clones with the PABCs from the Arabidopsis PAB2 and PAB5 and with the yeast Pab1p. The PAB2 and PAB5 sequences are very similar to each other, although the expression patterns of the corresponding genes differ. The yeast PABC is very similar to other PABCs, but has a distinct specificity (Kozlov et al. CITATION). The results obtained indicated that the four proteins containing PAM2 domains showed the same type of interaction with the PABCs as the CID gene products identified in our initial two-hybrid screen, suggesting that these predicted regions are also able to mediate interaction with PABCs. The PABC regions from PAB5 and PAB2 were indistinguishable in their ability to mediate the interaction with the PAM2 motif; however, the yeast domain did not mediate any interaction (Table 1). The interactions between PABCs from either PAB2 or PAB5 and the PAM2-containing fragments of predicted CID gene products was maintained at concentrations up to 100 mM 3-AT, indicating that these were strong interactions (data not shown).[[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] Using the grouping from the dendrogram in Fig. 4 and the gene annotation data, we classified the PAM2-encoding genes from Arabidopsis and rice into four groups. Group A includes two Arabidopsis genes (CID1 and CID2) and two closely related rice genes (9635.m04692 and 9631.m02300; Fig. 5a). A search in public databases revealed that CID1 corresponded to ERD15, a previously described protein whose expression is induced after exposure to various abiotic stresses (Kiyosue et al. CITATION; Dunaeva and Adamska CITATION); no information is available about the functions of the other three genes. A common feature of the proteins in this group is that they encode acidic modules (see Fig. 5b); similar modules are found in the Paip1 and Paip2 proteins (Craig et al. CITATION; Khaleghpour et al. CITATION). In an attempt to obtain loss-of-function mutations in CID1 and CID2 we analyzed publicly available T-DNA insertion mutant lines obtained from the SALK sequence-indexed insertion mutant database (Alonso et al. CITATION). The available T-DNA insertions for both of these genes were located in 5′UTR regions (SALK_073116 and SALK_143335). We obtained homozygous plants from both lines and performed Northern analysis. This analysis detected levels of expression from these genes comparable to those in the wild-type, indicating that the T-DNA insertions do not affect transcription; thus they may not cause any loss of function (data not shown). [[FIGURE]]  Group B includes two Arabidopsis genes (CID3 and CID4) and one rice gene (9630.m02659; Fig. 6A). Interestingly these three genes may be orthologs of the Lsm genes that encode Ataxin-2 in mammals and Pbp1p in yeast; Ataxin-2 is the gene mutated in the human genetic disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (Pulst et al. CITATION), and Pbp1p interacts with Pab1p (Mangus et al. CITATION). CID3, CID4 and 9630.m02659 from rice exhibit homology to the domains Lsm (’like Sm’) and LsmAD (Lsm-associated domain) present both in Ataxin-2 and Pbp1p (see Fig. 6b). Lsm is an RNA-binding domain that participates in several aspects of cellular RNA metabolism, while LsmAD contains a clathrin-mediated trans-Golgi signal and an endoplasmic reticulum exit signal (He and Parker CITATION; Albrecht et al. CITATION). A common feature this group of CID proteins is the presence of a tandem reiteration of overlapping motifs, a similar arrangement to that observed in eRF3 (Kozlov et al. CITATION) (see Fig. 6c). The PAM2 domain in CID4 also mediated interaction with Arabidopsis PABC domains when tested in the two-hybrid assay (see Table 1), suggesting that these are functional interacting domains. Ataxin-2 also contains a PAM2 domain towards the C-terminal end, but in this case probably as a single motif (see Fig. 6c). Conversely, although Pbp1p also interacts with Pab1p, it does not contain a PAM2 motif; in this case the interaction occurs with a region that precedes the PABC motif in Pab1p (Mangus et al. CITATION). A T-DNA insertional mutant for CID4 was analyzed (Fig. 6d). Although this mutation might result in a loss of function, no readily observable morphological alterations were detected in homozygous plants (data not shown). [[FIGURE]]  Group C consists of three Arabidopsis genes (CID5, CID6, CID7) and the three rice genes 9631.m00764, 9634.m00957 and 9630.m05345 (Fig. 7a). These genes encode a PAM2 domain at the N-terminal end and a conserved 40-residue region, tentatively named the CCR (conserved central region), toward the center of the polypeptide (Fig. 7b). CID5 and CID6 are highly homologous proteins of 155 and 175 residues, respectively. CID7 and the three putative rice homologues of CID7 encode proteins of 505 to 567 residues. These four proteins display a conserved region similar to the SMR (small MutS-related) domain at the C-terminal end (Fig. 7c). This is a highly conserved region found in bacterial MutS2 proteins. MutS2 is a component of the mismatch repair system. Although SMR domains have been detected in eukaryotic organisms, the function of this domain has not been established (Moreira and Philippe CITATION; Malik and Henikoff CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  Finally, Group D consists of six Arabidopsis genes (CID8, CID9, CID10, CID11, CID12, CID13) and the five rice genes 9629.m01067, 9630.m01376, 9634.m03311, 9636.m00133 and 9637.m01163 (Fig. 8a). These encode highly related RBPs (RNA-binding proteins) containing two RRMs (RNA recognition motifs) and a basic region that resembles a bipartite nuclear localization signal. The PAM2 motif in this group is located within the first one-third of the coding sequence (Fig. 8b). CID12/RBP37, a member of this group, was previously shown to be expressed early during embryogenesis and in growing organs (Hecht et al. CITATION); there is no information available for the other ten members. T-DNA insertional mutants in five of the six genes from this group were analyzed (Fig. 8c). Lines homozygous for the T-DNA in these genes were obtained, suggesting that any loss of function that might have been caused by the insertions was compatible with viability. Furthermore, none of the mutant lines showed readily detectable morphological alterations (not shown). [[FIGURE]]  All thirteen Arabidopsis CID genes and the eleven rice orthologs encode proteins of unknown function. With the exception of CID1 and CID12, which correspond to ERD15 and RBP37, respectively, no experimental information about the function or the expression of CID genes has been published. ERD15 encodes a small hydrophilic protein and was first identified as a dehydration-induced gene (Kiyosue et al. CITATION). CID12 corresponds to AtRBP37, a RNA-binding protein that was inferred to be expressed in growing organs. No function has been established for either of these genes. To obtain a general view of the expression of CID genes, we decided to evaluate the transcriptional profiles of members of each of the four predicted groups. RNA was extracted from cauline leaves, stems, rosette leaves, immature siliques and inflorescences, and expression was assessed by RT-PCR. The patterns of expression were compared to those of PABP genes which have been previously characterized (Belostotsky and Meagher CITATION; Palanivelu et al. CITATION; Belostotsky CITATION). Transcripts of most of the CID genes analyzed were detected in all the tissues tested. In two cases, more restricted expression was observed (Fig. 9). Expression of CID5 occurred only in immature siliques. Interestingly, this pattern of expression overlapped with that of PAB3 and PAB5, which are known to be expressed specifically in reproductive tissues (Belostotsky and Meagher CITATION; Palanivelu et al. CITATION; Belostotsky CITATION). Expression of CID11 was detected in all tissues tested except for rosette leaves, indicating differential expression for this gene. Expression of CID9 and CID13 was not detected. These genes may not be transcribed, or their expression may be restricted to certain tissues or conditions. This notion is compatible with the fact that there are no cDNAs for these genes reported in databases. [[FIGURE]]  In an attempt to obtain insight into the genetics of the interactions between PABP and CID genes we pursued the characterization of knock-out mutants in PABP genes. T-DNA insertion mutant lines for PAB2 and PAB5 were obtained from the SALK sequence-indexed insertion mutant database (see Fig. 10) (Alonso et al. CITATION), and the progeny obtained from crosses between heterozygous plants was analyzed by PCR. Analysis of the T-DNA insertions in PAB2 and PAB5 identified lines lacking the T-DNA and lines harboring hemizygous T-DNA insertions, but lines homozygous for the T-DNA insertions were not obtained. This result suggested that, for PAB2 and PAB5, the homozygous T-DNA insertions were not viable (Fig. 10). It is worth mentioning that the observed segregation ratio is not compatible with an expected 1:2 between wild type and heterozygous plants, suggesting that the mutant allele might not be equally transmitted by both gametes; however, reciprocal outcrosses between heterozygous and wild-type lines will have to be performed to properly assess this result. The T-DNA insertions in PAB2 and PAB5 are located in the first exons, and are therefore expected to result in loss of function mutations. These observations suggest that these two PABP genes are essential in Arabidopsis and that, rather than being redundant, each one has a specific role. [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! The GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used as described by the supplier. The Arabidopsis thaliana Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), constructed in the plasmid pGAD10, was screened. The yeast strain CG-1945 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, gal4-542, gal80-538, cyhr 2, LYS2::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -HIS3, URA3::GAL4 17-mers(×3)-CYC1 TATA -lacZ) was cotransformed with the cDNA library and the bait plasmid, which expresses the PABC domain of PAB2. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking Trp, Leu and His and supplemented with 5 mM 3-AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole). To eliminate false positive clones, plasmid DNA was recovered from yeast colonies and transformed into Escherichia coli. This DNA was then recovered, and used to transform strain CG-1945 and strain CG-1945 harboring the PABC bait plasmid in order to retest for growth on selective media; control plasmids were always included. Clones that did not show self-activation and grew on media supplemented with 3-AT were selected for further analysis. The sequence encoding the PABC domain was cloned into pDB424 [pDB424 is a derivative of pDBLEU (Gibco, BRL) in which the LEU selection marker has been replaced by a TRP marker from the vector pRS424; P. Guzmán, unpublished)]. The PABC coding sequence was amplified from genomic DNA using the oligonucleotide primers JP32 (5′- TCTAGAATGCATCCAAGGGGTCGGATG-3′) and JP33 (5′- GAGCTCTCTAGATTAAGAGAGGTTCAA-3′) (restriction sites and additional sequences used for cloning are underlined). The PCR product was cleaved with XbaI and SacI and cloned in frame with the sequence encoding the DNA binding domain of Gal4p in pDB424; clone structure was verified by DNA sequencing. CID1 and CID7 coding regions were amplified by PCR from the Arabidopsis MatchMaker cDNA library (Clontech) using the oligonucleotide primers JP38 (5′- GAGATCTACGCGTCCATGGCGATGGTATCAGGAAGACG-3′) and JP39 (5′- GAGATCTTCAGCGAGGCTGGTGGATCTTTCTC-3′) for CID1, and the primer pair JP40 (5′- GAGATCTGGTACCCCATGAGTTTAACAAAGAAAGCAAG-3′) and JP41 (5′- GAGATCTTCAGTATATGATGACTCTAAGGAG-3′) for CID7. The primers were designed to generate in-frame fusions with the sequence encoding the activation domain of Gal4p. The PCR products were cleaved with BglII and inserted into pGAD10. Selected regions of the Cid clones were amplified by PCR from the Arabidopsis MatchMaker cDNA library (Clontech) as follows. Three fragments from CID1 were obtained using the oligonucleotide primer pairs JP15 (5′- GCATATGGCGATGGTATCAGGAAGAA-3′) and JP34 (5′- GAGATCTATCCGCGCCTTGCTGCTG-3′), JP16 (5′- GAATTCGCAGCTGTACGACAAGTG-3′) and JP17 (5′- GGATCCAGCTACATCGATATGACC-3′), and JP18 (5′- GAATTCGTAFCTGATCTTCTTCCA-3′ and JP19 (5′- GAGATCTTCAGCGAGGCTGGTGGA-3′), respectively. Three segments from CID7 were obtained using the primer pairs JP10 (5′- GCGAATTCGCCATTTACCGCCAGAGG-3′) and JP11 (5′- GAGATCTTCAGCGAGGCTGGTGGATGTT-3′), JP12 (5′- GAATTCGCACGTCAGTTCTGGAGT-3′) and JP13 (5′- GGATCCGATTGCACCAGGCTGAGA-3′), and JP09 (5′- GGATCCTGAATGATGTGACGCAGA-3′) and JP14 (5′- GAATTCATGAGTTTAACAAAGAAAG-3′). These PCR products were digested with NdeI and BglII, EcoRI and BamHI, and EcoRI and BglII, respectively, and ligated into pGADT7. A deletion mutant was generated resulting in the elimination of five amino acid residues from CID1. An inverse PCR using the phosphorylated oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTCGACGCACCTCTTTTTATTCCGGCA-3′ and 5′-TTCTCGTCTTCCTGATACCATCGCCAT-3′ was performed with a CID1 subclone that was obtained in plasmid pBS− KS+ (Stratagene). Ligation of the PCR product resulted in a plasmid with an EcoRI restriction site sequence located at the site of the deletion. Restriction and religation results in replacement of the amino acid sequence STLNP in the PAM2 motif by the sequence EF. A KpnI fragment was removed from the in-frame clones in order to delete the GAL4 AD. Protein sequence alignments were generated using the multiple alignment option in DNAsis 3.5, which utilizes the Higgins and Sharp algorithm. Protein similarity searches were carried out at the BLAST server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) using the option ’Search for short nearly exact matches’. Rice sequences were obtained from the database at The Institute for Genomic Research (http://tigrblast.tigr.org/euk-blast/index.cgi?project=osa1). T-DNA insertion lines and cDNA clones were searched for in SIGnAL (http://signal.salk.edu/). Sequences encoding PABC domains from Arabidopsis PAB5 and yeast Pab1p were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the oligonucleotide primers JP28 (5′- GGAATTCCTCGCATCTGATTTGGCT-3′) and JP29 (5′- GCTGCAGCACAGCTGCTGGATCAGCAG-3′) for PAB5, and primers JP3O (5′- GTCTAGATTCATGCCTCCAATGTTCTAT-3′) and JP31 (5′- GAGCTCTTAAGCTTGCTCAGTTTGTTG-3′) for Pab1 (restriction sites and additional sequences used for cloning are underlined). The products were cleaved with EcoRI and PstI or XbaI and SstI, respectively, and ligated into pGBKT7 or pDB424, respectively; both plasmids carry the coding sequence for the DNA-binding domain of Gal4p (Clontech). PAM2-like sequences were obtained from the genes CID4 (At3g14010), CID5 (At3g11440) and CID8 (At1g53650). The sequences were amplified from the Arabidopsis MatchMaker cDNA library (Clontech) using the oligonucleotide primers JP22 (5′- GCATATGTCACCGAGCTCGTCAATTGGT-3′) and JP23 (5′- CGGATCCTGCGATTGGAGATGAGGTGG-3′) for CID4, JP62 (5′- GGAATTCAAGCCAGGAGCATTT-3′) and JP63 (5′- GGGATCCTGCTGCAAACACCAA-3′) for CID5, and JP26 (5′- GGAATTCGATGACCTCAAACCCAAATCC-3′) and JP27 (5′- GGGATCCTGGCTTTATAGCAATCACAAA-3′) for CID8. The products were cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI (CID4 and CID5) or NdeI and BamHI (CID8), and ligated into pGADT7 carrying the coding sequence for the activation domain of Gal4p (Clontech). Samples of total RNA from different plant tissues were isolated using Concert Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I. Reactions were performed using Super Script One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) using 100 ng of RNA (DNA-free) from each sample. The thermal cycling conditions were: 30 min at 50°C, 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 35 s at 57° and 1 min at 72°C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. Amplification products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. Primers used in RT-PCR assays were designed to span two exons. The primer sequences used for RT-PCR analysis of CID genes were the following: for CID1, JP15 (5′-GCGATGGTATCAGGAAGAA-3′) and JP19 (5′-TCAGCGAGGCTGGTGGA-3′); for CID4, JP51 (5′-TCAACCGAGCTCGTCAATTGGT-3′) and JP52 (5′-TGCGATTGGAGATTGAGGTGG-3′); for CID5, JP53 (5′-GCGGTGATGATGGTTTGGTGTT-3′) and JP54 (5′-GGATGCAGCGACTTCAGTAGA-3′); for CID7, JP10 (5′-GCCATTTACCGCCAGAGG-3′) and JP11 (5′-TCAGCGAGGCTGGTGGATGTT-3′); for CID8, JP43 (5′-GAAGAAGCTTGTTGCCATGTTCA-3′) and JP44 (5′-CCGATCGTGCACCTTCTGTTT-3′); for CID10, JP60 (5′-CACCGCATACACGACAATCAAC-3′) and JP61 (5′-CCCCACCTAAACTTGCTGATGG-3′); for CID11, JP47 (5′-GCAGCAGCTACTGCTGCTGATGCA-3′) and JP48 (5′-GTTGCGGAAGAAGGAACCAGCA-3′); and for CID12, JP49 (5′-CGTGATATGAGAGAGCTTCAC-3′) and JP50 (5′-GCCATTATTAACGCGGAAGAA-3′). The primer sequences employed for RT-PCR analysis of Arabidopsis PABP genes were: for PAB2, JP13 (5′- GCCGAATTCAGTGTTCGCCGAAGTGGCG-3′) and JP14 (5′- GTCGACCTCTGACTTCTTCTGGGC-3′); for PAB3, JP58 (5′-GGAGCGAACCTGTATTTGAAGA-3′) and JP59 (5′-GCCCTGGTGCTCTAATCTGTGA-3′); and for PAB5, JP55 (5′- GGAATTCCTCGCATCTGATTTGGCT-3′) and JP56 (5′- GCTGCAGCACAGCTGCTGGATCAGCAG-3′). CF150 (At1g72150) was used as a constitutive control for RT-PCR analysis; the primer sequences for this gene were PM39 (5′-CCGACAAGGAGAAGCTTAACAAGTT-3′) and PM40 (5′-CGGCAGATTTGGATGGACCAGCAAG-3′). Genomic DNA was isolated by a method based on that of Murray and Thompson (CITATION) from the leaves of 3-week to 4-week-old mature plants grown in soil. PCRs were performed for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C and 5 min at 72°C. Gene-specific primers were used together with LB (5′-GGCAATCAGCTGTTGCCCGTCTCACTGGTG-3′), which anneals to the left border of the T-DNA. The gene-specific primers for PABP genes were: for PAB2, JP34 (5′-GCGCAGGTTCAACTTCAGGG-3′) and JP35 (5′-AAGTATCATGCAGTGCTTTGTGGTCGATGG-3′); and for PAB5, JP36 (5′-AATGGTTGATCAAGTGATCCC-3′) and JP37 (5′-CCACCACATCCATTGCAACCTTGCAAGAGA-3′). Gene specific primers for CID genes were: for CID1, JP71 (5′-GAAGCTTCAACGGGAGGTTGATTGTAC-3′) and JP72 (5′-TGCGTCGGGGTTTAGAGTAGA-3′); for CID2, JP73 (5′-GCGACTCGTGAGTGAGACTCGCTC-3′) and JP74 (5′-CGTGGCTGATAGATATGATGATTC-3′); for CID4, JP75 (5′-GGGTACCTGATGAGACTATTCCAC-3′) and JP76 (5′-TGTGGTATAGAGGTCCTCGTCG-3′); for CID8, JP43 (5′-GAAGAAGCTTGTTGCCATGTTCA-3′) and JP44 (5′-CCGATCGTGCACCTTCTGT-3′); for CID9, JP64 5′-CCAAGGGAGAAGGAGGTTAACTGG-3′) and JP65 (5′-TCACATCAGCTTGAGAAACCTGC-3′); for CID10, JP62 (5′-CCCCACCTAAACTTGCTGATGG-3′) and JP66 (5′-GCACACGAATTACCAACAGAC-3′); for CID12, JP69 (5′-TTGATGAGTGATGGACAAGTAAA-3′) and JP70 (5′-CAAAATGAAGAATCATCAAAAAC-3′), and for CID13, JP67 (5′-GCCCTGTTTGCATACATGAATT-3′ and JP68 (5′-CCCTTCACACACATAGAGAAAT-3′). PCR amplification products were resolved in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels.
