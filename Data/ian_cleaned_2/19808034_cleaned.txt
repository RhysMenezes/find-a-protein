!~ABS~! Gamma carbonic anhydrases (γCA) are widespread in Prokaryotes. In Eukaryotes, homologous genes were found only in plant genomes. In Arabidopsis and maize, the corresponding gene products are subunits of mitochondrial Complex I. At present, only γCA homotrimers of Methanosarcina thermophila (CAM) show reversible carbon dioxide (CO2) hydration activity. In the present work, it is shown that recombinant plant γCA2 could form homotrimers and bind H 14 CO 3 - . However, they are unable to catalyse the reversible hydration of CO2. These results suggest that plant γCAs do not act as carbonic anhydrases but with a related activity possibly contributing to recycle CO2 in the context of photorespiration.
!~RES~! To provide insight into the function of γCAs in plants, the cDNA encoding one complex I subunit, γCA2, was cloned in an expression vector containing a removable 6XHis tag at the N-terminus. Mitochondrial signal peptide predictions and alignments with crystallized protein homologues [2EG0, 1V3W, 1XHD and 1QRL (CAM)] were used with in order to find structural restriction to perform γCA2 deletions (CITATION ). Since the full-length cDNA produced a 30kDa recombinant protein in inclusion bodies, several deletions were assayed to obtain soluble proteins. According to the alignment analysis, a series of three constructs were performed: (2–218, 18–218 and 50–218) which were termed according to the first and last amino acid positions. Only the construct 50–218 (coding for a 21kDa protein) was expressed as a soluble protein (CITATION A and B). This recombinant protein contains all the predicted amino acids important for catalysis and Ci binding (CITATION). However, it does lack the predicted signal peptide and the non-conserved C-terminus. Accordingly, it was chosen for further analyses. The E. coli strain containing the 50–218 construct induced with IPTG as indicated in Section CITATION as grown ON at 20°C and subjected to lysis. Soluble proteins were applied to a Ni-column in order to retain the recombinant His-tagged protein. A great proportion (∼98%) was eluted with Imidazole. A 21kDa protein is recognized in a Western blot using the commercial anti-His-tag antibody (CITATIONC). The protein was stable at 4°C for more than 10days without any sign of proteolysis or precipitation. A relatively low yield of about 1mg/4l of culture was routinely obtained. The best biochemical and structurally characterized γCA is CAM from the methanogenic archeon M. thermophila (for a review see CITATION). This protein was crystallized and shown to form homotrimers that are essential for activity. In order to know the oligomerization state of recombinant γCA2, Dynamic light scattering was used. A spherical particle of 3.4nm corresponding to ∼58kDa was mainly seen (96.3% in mass) (CITATION A). Furthermore, purified recombinant γCA2 was applied to a Superose 12 column. A specie of ∼57kDa was clearly detected (CITATIONB). Accordingly, it was concluded that recombinant γCA2 folded in the form of homotrimers as previously predicted CITATION. The dehydration reaction of bicarbonate was assayed in the absence of enzyme (spontaneous reaction, SR), and in the presence of either γCA2 or Bovine Carbonic Anhydrase (BCAII). As shown in CITATION , the presence of γCA2 in the reaction mixture does not produce a significant change in the initial velocity of dehydration reaction of bicarbonate respect to the spontaneous reaction (0.0682 S.D. 0.0005aus−1 and 0.0581 S.D. 0.0003aus−1, respectively, n =3). The same observations were achieved at several concentrations of γCA2 (1–10μM) and NaHCO3 (5 and 10mM) (data not shown). Notice that sevenfold less of BCA in the reaction mixture produces a noticeable increase of the initial velocity (0.319 S.D. 0.005aus−1). It was thus concluded that recombinant plant γCA2 homotrimers do not exhibit carbonic anhydrase activity, at least, in the conditions tested. Some carbonic anhydrases from mammalian sources catalyse the reversible hydrolysis of esters CITATION. With p-nitrophenylacetate as a substrate, commercially available Bovine Carbonic Anhydrase showed an esterase activity of 34.7mol of p-nitrophenylacetate per min per mol of enzyme, in contrast no activity was detected for the plant enzyme (0.02mol of p-nitrophenylacetate per min per mol). Thus, γCA2 is one of several carbonic anhydrases CITATION for which esterase activity appears to be absent. Structural and amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that all of the CAM residues involved in Zn coordination, binding of HCO 3 - and the formation homotrimer are spatially conserved in γCA2 CITATION. Thus, bio-informatic analyses support the view that γCA2 homotrimers may retain HCO 3 - /CO2 binding capability, although the experimental evidence indicates that recombinant γCA2 (50–218) is apparently unable to catalyse the reversible CO2 hydration (CITATION). When incubated with H 14 CO 3 - , resin-retained, recombinant γCA2 binds 2.4×10−5 nanomol of Ci per ng of γCA2 protein (S.D. 1.71×10−6, n =5), corresponding to 17.95±2.74picomol in total. This level of binding was threefold greater than that observed for the resin alone or resin-retained E. coli background proteins, on an equal volume basis (CITATION ). Due to the spontaneous HCO 3 - dehydration to form CO2, the exact nature of the bonded molecule to γCA2 remains elusive.
!~MM~! Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as described previously CITATION. In silico analysis of molecular weight and extinction coefficients (ε) were determined with the Protparam tool (www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html). The apparent native molecular mass was monitored by Dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a DynaPro™ Titan from Wyatt Technology and by using a molecular exchange column (Superose 12/300 GL, GE) equilibrated in buffer A (50mM NaH2PO4, 150mM NaCl, 1μM ZnSO4, pH 7.4) Protein concentration was determined by using the A280 with a ε: 21555M−1 cm−1. The mitochondrial signal peptide of γCA2 was predicted using: MitoProt: mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter, TargetP: www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP and SignalP: www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) was performed with T-coffee: http://tcoffee.vital-it.ch CITATION. Sequences used for MSA were 2EG0 (Hypothetical Protein from G. kaustophilus), 1V3W (Ferripyochelin Binding Protein from P. horikoshii), 1XHD (Putative Acetyltransferase from B. cereus), 1QRL (carbonic anhydrase from M. thermophila). For secondary structure prediction, Jpred 3 (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/) CITATION was used. RNA from Arabidopsis thaliana was extracted and used for RT-PCR with the forward primer: 5′GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCGGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCGATAAATCACCATTGGTGGATAAAGATG, and reverse primer: GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTAATTCTCTGAGGCGTGAATCTGTGC, to generate a recombinant soluble 6XHis-tagged form of γCA2 (aa 50–218). This PCR fragment was cloned using in vitro recombination (GATEWAY, Invitrogen), in the expression plasmid pDEST17. Competent E. coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells were transformed with pDEST17-50-218 (21kDa). E. coli cells were grown at 30°C in LB containing 100μg/ml of ampicillin and 25μg/ml of chloramphenicol, and induced at an A600 of 0.6–1 with 1mM isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After additional growth for 18h at 20°C, cells were sonicated and resuspended in His binding buffer (20mM NaH2PO4 y 500mM NaCl, 30mM Imidazole, pH 7.4). The soluble protein fraction was collected after centrifugation (10000×g, 30min, 4°C). Soluble protein extract was applied to His trap HP column (GE Healthcare), then washed with five column volumes with His binding buffer. The His-tagged protein was eluted from the column with elution buffer (20mM NaH2PO4, 500mM NaCl, 500mM Imidazole, pH 8). The purified recombinant 21kDa γCA2 was dialyzed ON against 20mM NaH2PO4, 100mM NaCl and 1μM ZnSO4. Western blotting was performed to monitor purification steps using a commercial anti-HIS antibody (GE). Furthermore, the identity of the eluted protein was assigned by automated EDMAN degradation. Soluble protein extract containing His6-tagged γCA2 (21kDa) was incubated at 4°C with a Ni affinity resin (GE Healthcare) for 1h. Resin-Bound γCA2 was incubated with NaH14CO3 as previously described CITATION. The radioactivity of 14C was measured with a scintillation counter Beckman LS 7000. The dehydration of bicarbonate reaction was followed by measuring the pH change using a fluorescent pH-indicator, 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine) CITATION. Fluorescence measurements were collected with an AMINCO–Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrofluorometer equipped with a Bio SX-18 MV stopped flow (Applied photophysics). The reaction was started by mixing a solution containing KHCO3 in 0.5mM bicine–KOH at pH 8 with an equal volume of 100nM pyranine with or without enzyme in 0.5mM HEPES–KOH at pH 6.0. The fluorescence intensity change was followed by measuring fluorescent emission at 512nm after excitation at 466nm. Activity for p-nitrophenylacetate hydrolysis was determined at 25°C in a reaction mixture (1.35ml) containing 0.5ml of freshly prepared 3mM p-nitrophenylacetate in aqueous 3% (vol/vol) acetone and 0.85ml of water. The uncatalyzed rate of the reaction was determined by adding 0.15ml of 100mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1mM zinc sulfate and recording the change in A348 per min (Δε 5000M−1 cm−1). After 2min, 15μl of enzyme solution was added, and the catalyzed reaction was monitored for additional 3min CITATION.
