!~ABS~! Whereas the plastid caseinolytic peptidase (Clp) P protease system is essential for plant development, substrates and substrate selection mechanisms are unknown. Bacterial ClpS is involved in N-degron substrate selection and delivery to the ClpAP protease. Through phylogenetic analysis, we show that all angiosperms contain ClpS1 and some species also contain ClpS1-like protein(s). In silico analysis suggests that ClpS1 is the functional homolog of bacterial ClpS. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana ClpS1 interacts with plastid ClpC1,2 chaperones. The Arabidopsis ClpS1 null mutant (clps1) lacks a visible phenotype, and no genetic interactions with ClpC/D chaperone or ClpPR core mutants were observed. However, clps1, but not clpc1-1, has increased sensitivity to the translational elongation inhibitor chloramphenicol suggesting a link between translational capacity and ClpS1. Moreover, ClpS1 was upregulated in clpc1-1, and quantitative proteomics of clps1, clpc1, and clps1 clpc1 showed specific molecular phenotypes attributed to loss of ClpC1 or ClpS1. In particular, clps1 showed alteration of the tetrapyrrole pathway. Affinity purification identified eight candidate ClpS1 substrates, including plastid DNA repair proteins and Glu tRNA reductase, which is a control point for tetrapyrrole synthesis. ClpS1 interaction with five substrates strictly depended on two conserved ClpS1 residues involved in N-degron recognition. ClpS1 function, substrates, and substrate recognition mechanisms are discussed.
!~RES~! Previous phylogenetic analyses of the ClpS protein showed the evolutionary linkages among bacteria, some cyanobacteria, and a few plant species (CITATION; CITATION). To better define the evolutionary lineage of plant ClpS proteins and determine conservation of ClpS residues in angiosperms, we performed an in-depth phylogenetic analysis using a sequence alignment of 10 sequences from five cyanobacterial species, four sequences from two algal species, two moss sequences, 39 sequences from 19 vascular plant species, and E. coli ClpS as the outgroup (see Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Data Set 1 online). ClpS sequences fall into distinct phylogenetic branches following the general outline of the tree of life (Figure 1A). As shown in the cladogram, the prototype ClpS first splits into two cyanobacterial derivatives, named ClpS1 and ClpS2 (Figure 1A). The cyanobacterial ClpS1 further evolved through the green lineage from eukaryotic unicellular algae to plants including moss and angiosperms, while the ClpS2 proteins are limited to cyanobacteria. Interestingly, an alternative type of ClpS1, which we assigned ClpS1-like protein, is found in eukaryotic organisms, including both algae and moss, and some of the angiosperms (e.g., rice [Oryza sativa] but not maize [Zea mays] and Arabidopsis) (Figure 1A). [[FIGURE]] Figure 1B shows the phylogenetic analysis across the 33 mature ClpS1 sequences in moss, monocots, and dicots. A clear diversification in ClpS1 between the monocots and dicots is observed. Furthermore, ClpS1 in the five Brassicaceae species is distinct from those of other dicot species. Interestingly, the number of ClpS1 orthologs within each species varies between one (e.g., Arabidopsis and rice) and four (Glycine max); this could perhaps reflect specialization of ClpS paralogs toward specific substrates. The various studies on E. coli ClpS have defined the regions and specific residues that are important for interaction with the ClpA chaperone and substrates (see Introduction). We evaluated to what extent these critical regions and residues are conserved across the ClpS family and possible implications for ClpS functions in plastids. Previous analysis of the E. coli ClpS protein distinguished between the short and unstructured N-terminal extension (M1-P25) and the ClpS core region (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). The N-terminal extension is important for inhibition of binding of SsrA-tagged proteins and for delivery/transfer of N-degron substrates to the Clp chaperone (CITATION). The N-terminal extension is of similar length in cyanobacterial ClpS1,2, but much longer in the eukaryotic ClpS1 and ClpS1-like proteins, suggesting that substrate delivery from ClpS to the Clp chaperones is different between eukaryotes and bacteria. Indeed, unlike nonphotosynthetic bacteria, photosynthetic eukaryotes are not (yet) known to possess SsrA tagging systems. The N-terminal extensions of the eukaryotic ClpS1 and ClpS1-like proteins each have clear consensus sequences that partially overlap (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figure 1 online), such as several Gly residues and a conserved Pro. This conservation will allow testing the functional role of this N-terminal extension in substrate selection and delivery through mutagenesis. [[FIGURE]] The ClpS core region showed conservation across the ClpS protein family, but with significant diversification between the various ClpS types (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). To better understand this diversification, we determined the ClpS core consensus sequences for ClpS1 and ClpS2 in the cyanobacteria as well as ClpS1 and ClpS1-like in the angiosperms (Figure 2B). The residues Asn-34, Asp-35, and His-66 constitute the substrate pocket and are critical for binding to the α-amino group of the first N-terminal destabilizing residue of substrates in E. coli; they are 100% conserved in angiosperm ClpS1, but not in ClpS1-like or ClpS2. Of the four additional residues (Thr-38, Val-43, Val-65, and Leu-99; marked in green) involved in N-degron binding, two (Val-43 and Leu-99) are conserved in ClpS1 and ClpS1-like. Furthermore, two Met residues (Met-40 and Met-62) contribute to substrate specificity in E. coli. Met-62 is 100% conserved in ClpS1, but not in ClpS1-like or ClpS2 proteins. By contrast, E. coli residue Met-40 is replaced by Arg in all eukaryotic ClpS1 proteins and by Glu in all ClpS1-like and Phe in all ClpS2 proteins. These observations suggest that the ClpS substrate recognition mechanism for substrates with N-degrons is partially retained throughout evolution for ClpS1 and diverged more strongly in ClpS1-like and ClpS2. We note that the presence of conserved N-degrons has not been established for plastids, but the considerable conservation of residues involved in N-degron binding in E. coli provides a strong incentive to search for a plastid N-end rule (see Discussion). The ClpS E. coli chaperone binding region has three critical residues (Glu-79, Glu-82, and Lys-84) (Figure 2B). Mutagenesis of both Glu-79 and Lys-84 together resulted in a loss of interaction with ClpA, whereas Glu-82 did not seem to be important for chaperone interaction (CITATION). Glu-82 is conserved across all ClpS proteins, whereas Glu-79 is not conserved in angiosperm ClpS1, but conserved across cyanoClpS1,2 and ClpS1-like proteins. Lys-84 is not conserved in photosynthetic ClpS proteins, but either replaced by Tyr or His. (We note that Glu-79 is replaced by Ala or Val in the dicotyledons and by Ser in the monocotyledons.) The absence of strong conservation in the chaperone binding region of ClpS prompted us to consider conservation of ClpS binding residues in the ClpA/C/D chaperones and structural information. In E. coli, the N-domain of ClpA is sufficient for ClpS interaction (CITATION). Based on high-resolution x-ray structures and functional analysis, the E. coli ClpS–ClpA interaction was suggested to require two hydrogen bonds formed between the ClpS residue Glu-79 and the ClpA residues Glu-28 and Thr-81, in addition to two salt bridges between the ClpS residues Glu-82 and Lys-84 and the ClpA residues Arg-86 and Glu-23 (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). One of the salt bridges is likely maintained between Arabidopsis ClpS1 and its ClpC chaperones because corresponding residues to Glu-82 (in E. coli ClpS) and Arg-86 (E. coli ClpA) are 100% conserved (Glu-137 in ClpS1 and Arg-179/Arg-199 in ClpC1/2) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). In fact, these ClpS1 and ClpC residues are conserved in all 19 angiosperm species examined (Figures 2B and 3). However, the Arabidopsis ClpS1 residue at position 134 corresponding to E. coli Glu-79, conferring the hydrogen bond with the chaperone, appears to be eliminated by Ala substitution (Figure 2B), whereas the corresponding Thr residue (Thr-81 in E. coli ClpA) in ClpC1/2 (Thr-179 or Thr-194) is perfectly conserved (Figure 3). The salt bridge present in E. coli ClpS at position Lys-84 in Arabidopsis ClpS1 can thus no longer be formed within the ClpS1–ClpC interaction; instead, there appears to be a hydrogen bond at the ClpS1-ClpC1/2 interface, as the ClpS1 residue is changed to His (His-139) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The ClpA (charged) residue (Glu-23) is substituted with an uncharged polar residue (Asn-119 or Asn-139) in Arabidopsis (and other angiosperms) ClpC1/2 but is not conserved in angiosperm ClpD (Figure 3). The lack of conservation of the chaperone binding region makes it seem less likely that ClpS1 (or ClpS1-like) interacts with ClpD; this is consistent with the very different mRNA expression patterns between CLPS1 and CLPD in Arabidopsis, peaking respectively in young and senescing leaves. In conclusion, in silico analysis suggests that ClpS1 can interact with the chaperone modules ClpC1/C2 in a similar manner as observed for ClpS and the ClpA chaperone in eubacteria; however, experimental testing of such interaction is needed. [[FIGURE]] So far, our in silico analysis suggests that ClpS1 is a functional homolog of ClpS in E. coli. In the remainder of this article, we will examine the functional role of ClpS1 in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, determine genetic and physical interactions with ClpC1,2, and identify candidate substrates through affinity purification. To understand when and where ClpS1 plays a role in Arabidopsis, we determined the endogenous levels of ClpS1 in stems, flowers, and siliques, as well as in leaves at several points during leaf development for Arabidopsis grown on soil under continuous light (Figure 4A). ClpS1 protein accumulated exclusively in photosynthetic green tissues with high levels in young, developing leaf tissues and was nearly absent in senescing rosettes (5 to 6 weeks old). Comparable accumulation patterns were observed for its chaperone partners, ClpC1 and ClpC2, although developmental downregulation of ClpC1/2 in leaves was delayed as compared with ClpS1 (Figure 4A). By contrast, chloroplast chaperone cpHSP70 (not associated with the Clp protease) was expressed stably throughout all the green tissues examined. The proteolytic core subunit ClpR2 also showed highest accumulation in the younger rosettes (Figure 4A). Consistent with these data, the transcript levels of CLPS1 and CLPC genes show similar tissue-specific and developmental expression profiles (CITATION). ClpS1 was found only in the stromal fraction and not the chloroplast membranes (Figure 4B). These observations are consistent with a role for ClpS1 mediating regulated proteolysis in cooperation with ClpC1,2, in particular during plastid biogenesis, but not during senescence. [[FIGURE]] To test in vivo interaction between ClpS1 and ClpC1/2, we performed size-exclusion chromatography analysis of the chloroplast stromal proteome isolated from young wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings (Figure 4C). ClpC1/2 started to elute at ∼600 kD (fraction 7; marked by the 550-kD ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase [Rubisco] holocomplex), likely corresponding to ClpC hexamers, reaching a peak in fraction 9 at ∼200 kD (corresponding to dimers) and then rapidly declining to undetectable levels. We note that ClpC1/2 were previously detected as 200-kD complexes using native gels of chloroplast stroma (CITATION), whereas recombinant ClpC2 and ClpD each formed 180- to 220-kD homodimers and, upon incubation with 5 mM ATP, also ∼500- to 700-kD homohexamers (CITATION). Stromal ClpS1 eluted in fractions from ∼600 kD (fraction 7) to small monomeric proteins (fractions 11 and 12). These elution profiles are compatible with an in vivo interaction between ClpS1 and ClpC1 and/or ClpC2 and show that a significant amount of ClpS1 accumulated in complexes. To investigate direct interaction between ClpS1 and ClpC chaperones and the influence of ATP, we generated recombinant ClpS1 N-terminally fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST-ClpS) and recombinant ClpC2-(HIS)6 fusion protein. GST-ClpS was bound to a GST affinity column and used as bait. Recombinant GST was used as negative control for unspecific ClpC2 binding (Figure 4D). Proteins were eluted using laemmli buffer. These in vitro pull-down experiments showed that ClpS1 does specifically bind to ClpC2 in an ATPγS-independent manner (Figure 4D). An SDS-PAGE gel showing the input in these assays is shown in Supplemental Figure 3A online. In case of ClpC1, we used recombinant N-terminal domain of ClpC1 (residues 39 to 252) to test interaction with ClpS1 because the complete ClpC1 protein was unstable in the E. coli, as reported previously (CITATION). Importantly, this N-domain contains the predicted sites for interaction with ClpS1 (Figure 3). Using recombinant ClpS1-His6, we tested its interaction with GST-ClpC1-N-domain using GST as a negative control (Figure 4E and inputs in Supplemental Figure 3B online). Silver staining and immunoblots of the eluates clearly show a specific interaction between the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 and ClpS1 (Figure 4E), thus providing further support for a conserved ClpS1 function in substrate delivery. ClpT1 and ClpT2 are two small proteins peripherally associated with the ClpPR core and have strong similarity to the N-domain of ClpC1,2. Based on this similarity, we previously hypothesized that ClpS1 could interact with ClpT1,2 (CITATION; CITATION). To test this hypothesis, we generated recombinant ClpT1 and ClpT2 and probed for interactions with ClpS1 using the GST-ClpS1 affinity column (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). However, no interactions were observed. Furthermore, when we previously analyzed the affinity-purified ClpPRT complex using in vivo StrepII-tagged ClpR4 or StrepII-tagged ClpP3, we did identify each ClpPR subunit as well as ClpT1 and ClpT2, but we never observed ClpS1 (CITATION). Finally, we also did not observe ClpT1 or ClpT2 in the ClpS-GST experiments using stroma from wild-type chloroplasts or stroma from mutants lacking ClpS1 or both ClpS1 and ClpC1 (see below). In conclusion, the hypothesized interaction between ClpS1 and ClpT1,2 is (so far) not supported by experimental evidence. To explore the physiological significance of ClpS in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, we obtained a CLPS1 null mutant (clps1) with a confirmed T-DNA insertion in the second intron (Figure 5A). The loss of the CLPS1 mRNA accumulation was determined by RT-PCR (Figure 5B), and immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-ClpS1 antibodies showed a complete loss of ClpS1 protein (Figure 5C). Growth and development of clps1 when grown on soil were not visibly different from the wild type (Figure 5D). However, true leaves of soil-grown clps1 seedlings (stage 1.07) under short-day conditions contained 13% less chlorophyll a+b on a fresh weight basis than did those of the wild type (Figure 5E). This indicates a weak chloroplast phenotype. [[FIGURE]] We then exposed clps1 and wild-type plants to various light regimes (short/long daylength or continuous light at a range of growth light intensities between 40 and 250 μmol photons m−2 s−1), continuous dark for several days, heat (90 min or 3 h at 38°C; 38°C for 90 min, followed by 45°C for 30 min), and salinity (50, 100, 150, and 200 mM NaCl), but no significant effects were observed for the visible phenotype of clps1 compared with the wild type (data not shown). Moreover, overexpression of ClpS1 (confirmed at the ClpS1 protein level; up to 3.5-fold ClpS1 overaccumulation) in the wild-type background did not result in a visible growth phenotype (data not shown). We then tested for genetic interactions between ClpS1, the three Clp chaperones (C1, C2, and D) and the ClpPR core complex (Figure 6). T-DNA insertion mutants for CLPC1, CLPC2, CLPD were obtained from publicly available T-DNA collections and genotyped; the CLPC alleles were described in previous studies (see Table 1 for details and references). With regard to the ClpPR complex, null mutations are embryo lethal for ClpP4 and ClpP5 and seedling lethal on soil for ClpR2, ClpR4, and ClpP3 but cause only a mild phenotype for ClpR1 (summarized in CITATION). Therefore, we selected the virescent clpr2-1 knockdown mutant, which is viable on soil and has been previously characterized in detail (CITATION; CITATION). Double mutants of clps1 with these clpr2-1, clpc1-1, clpc2-1, and clpd mutants were then generated by crossing and screening the resulting F2 and F3 progenies for homozygous mutants. We also generated double mutants of clpc1-1 clpc2-2, using this leaky allele for CLPC2 because the double null allele for CLPC1 and CLPC2 is embryo or seedling lethal (CITATION). There was a clear dosage effect of CLPC2 on clpc1-1 (Figure 6A). The homozygous double mutant clpc1-1 clpc2-2 was crossed with clps1. These five ClpS1 double or triple homozygous mutant lines were then evaluated for growth and developmental phenotypes, along with the respective single and double parental lines and the wild type (Figures 6B to 6F). Despite these extensive efforts, we did not observe obvious visible effects of the clps1 null background in these other clp single or double mutants. We conclude that ClpS1 is not required for normal plant growth and development. [[FIGURE]] To further evaluate functional interactions between ClpC1, ClpC2, and ClpS1, we compared the levels of ClpS1, ClpC1, and ClpC2 in clps1, clpc1, and clps1 clpc1 (Figure 5F). We also analyzed abundance of the stromal chaperone cpHSP70 and ClpR2 as a marker for the ClpPR core. The abundance of neither cpHSP70 nor ClpR2 was significantly altered in the mutants, but ClpS1 abundance increased approximately threefold in clpc1, supporting functional interaction between ClpS1 and ClpC1. ClpC2 increased approximately threefold in clpc1 and clps1 clpc1 (Figure 5F), consistent with the genetics and supporting the observed redundancy between the two ClpC chaperones. It has been observed in E. coli that ClpA (the ClpC homolog) is destabilized in ClpS-depleted cells (CITATION), but our results indicate that in Arabidopsis chloroplasts ClpS1 accumulation levels do not influence stability of ClpC. There was no significant visible growth phenotype in clps1, nor did we observe visible synergistic or suppression effects when clps1 was crossed with other clp mutants. However, there may well be a molecular phenotype at the protein level in clps1 that would indicate its functional role. Indeed, chlorophyll content was slightly reduced in clps1 compared with the wild type (Figure 5E). Therefore, we performed a comparative quantitative proteome analysis between the stromal chloroplast fractions of the wild type and clps1 employing label-free mass spectrometry (MS)–based quantification using an LTQ-Orbitrap and spectral counting, using an optimized workflow as previously described (CITATION). For comparison, we also included the clpc1 single mutant (with virescent phenotype). Plants were grown on soil and harvested at leaf stages 1.08 to 1.09 during which ClpS1 is expressed with the highest levels in wild-type leaves. Chloroplasts were isolated and stromal proteomes extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained by Coomassie blue (Figure 7A). No obvious differences in protein patterns were observed between clps1 and the wild type, even when using larger gels (data not shown). However, accumulation levels of both large and small Rubisco subunits were clearly lower in clpc1 (Figure 7A). Protein abundances were quantified according to the number of matched adjusted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra (adjSPC). In total, 790 proteins were identified with two or more adjSPC with a total of 124,897 adjSPC (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). Based on our most recent reference plastid proteome analysis (CITATION; see The Plant Proteome Database [PPDB], http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu), 633 proteins were located in the chloroplast and matched to 97% of all adjSPC (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). This showed that the chloroplasts were highly purified. The Venn diagram of the identified plastid proteins shows excellent overlap between the three genotypes (Figure 7A). The biological replicates were very similar within the same genotype (correlation coefficient >0.97) but lower between genotypes (0.93 to 0.95), with the lowest (0.93) when comparing the wild type and clpc1 (Figure 7B). Furthermore, principle component analysis (PCA) also showed that the variation between genotypes was larger than between replicates within each genotype and that clps1 was more similar to the wild type than clpc1-1 (Figure 7B). Together this shows that (1) the quantitative proteome experiments are of high quality with little noise and (2) that clps1 has a measurable proteome phenotype but that it is different from the clpc1-1 proteome phenotype. [[FIGURE]] To evaluate general effects of loss of ClpS1 or ClpC1 on the plastid, we compared the chloroplast protein mass investments (based on the NadjSPC of assigned chloroplast proteins) across 34 functions between the three genotypes (see Supplemental Table 1 online). These functions were assigned using the MapMan bin system (CITATION) that we further curated (see PPDB). Figure 8 shows the 20 functions that were significantly affected (at P < 0.1, P < 0.05, or P < 0.01; Student’s t test) in one or more of the mutants. Clearly, clps1 showed very little proteome phenotype, with tetrapyrrole metabolism (18% down) being affected at P < 0.05 and three functions (starch metabolism, glycolysis [proteins involved in hexose phosphate conversions], and amino acid metabolism) significantly reduced at P < 0.1. By contrast, clpc1-1 showed significant effects for multiple functions (nine functions at P < 0.01), consistent with the visible growth phenotype. In particular, primary carbon metabolism in the plastid was downregulated at the level of the Calvin cycle (by 30%), glycolysis (by 41%), and photorespiration (by 24%). Functions that were upregulated included protein chaperones (by 30%), protein assembly factors (by 65%), DNA interacting proteins (by 110%), tetrapyrrole metabolism (by 18%), fatty acid metabolism (by 88%), and sulfur metabolism (by 44%). [[FIGURE]] To further clarify these molecular phenotypes, we then identified significant (P < 0.01; GLEE algorithm) differential accumulation of individual proteins between the three genotypes. The differentially expressed proteins reflect indirect effects from the loss of ClpS1 or ClpC1, but upregulated proteins are also potential substrates for ClpS1- or ClpC1-dependent proteolysis. Thirty-nine stromal proteins were upregulated and 36 were downregulated in the clps1 mutant compared with the wild type. In clpc1-1, 61 proteins were upregulated and 31 were downregulated (Figure 9; see Supplemental Data Sets 3 and 4 online). Sixteen proteins were upregulated in both genotypes and 12 were downregulated in both genotypes (Figure 9A). Only one protein, Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase H (CHLH/GUN5), showed opposite behavior between the genotypes. In the case of clps1, but not clpc1, proteins in the tetrapyrrole pathway were strongly overrepresented among affected proteins (Figure 9B; see Supplemental Table 2 online). In case of clpc1, Calvin cycle proteins (nine out 27), metabolism of vitamins (five out of 12), and minor carbohydrate metabolism (5 out of 11) were overrepresented among affected proteins (Figure 9B), consistent with the findings in Figure 8 using total abundance per function. This clpc1 molecular phenotype points to reduced photosynthetic capacity and problems in protein homeostasis, consistent with the yellow phenotype, reduced growth, and the role of ClpC1 in protein import. The more modest clps1 molecular phenotype points to destabilization of the tetrapyrrole pathway (Figures 8 and 9B), in addition to more scattered effects (see Discussion). [[FIGURE]] Figure 9C shows the quantitative response of the tetrapyrrole pathway, including 14 proteins involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and one enzyme involved in chlorophyll degradation. Out of those 14 proteins, five proteins (GSAT, ALAD, UPD1, CHLI, and GUN5) were significantly (P < 0.01) downregulated and three (SIRB, HO1, and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase) were significantly (P < 0.01) upregulated in clps1. These upregulated proteins are specifically involved in siroheme (SIRB) and heme (HO1) biosynthesis, whereas the downregulated proteins are involved in the central tetrapyrrole pathway (GSAT, ALAD, and UPD1) or specifically chlorophyll biosynthesis (CHLI and GUN5). Red chlorophyll catabolite reductase involved in removal of toxic chlorophyll catabolite (CITATION) was upregulated in clps1 but not in clpc1-1. GluTRBP/PGR7 was 11-fold upregulated (P < 0.01) in the clpc1-1 mutant but was not significantly affected in clps1. GluTR-interacting protein (GluTRBP), also named PGR7 (CITATION), helps to funnel ALA into the heme biosynthetic pathway, at the expense of chlorophyll (CITATION). GUN5 showed opposite behavior between the genotypes, with upregulation (3×) in clpc1 but downregulation (0.5×) in clps1 (Figure 9B). GUN5 was also strongly (>10×) upregulated in young clpr2-1 mutants (CITATION). Immunoblot analysis using total leaf extracts of the three genotypes (Figure 9D) showed that ∼20% of GUN5 (a 144-kD protein) accumulated as an ∼110-kD breakdown protein in clpc1 and the double mutant but not in the wild type or clps1. When including the signal from this lower mass product, total GUN5 signal was ∼1.7× stronger in clpc1 and the double mutant. In case of the MS analysis, GUN5 was even more (3.4×) increased in clpc1. We have carefully evaluated the identified GUN5 peptides, and we can conclude only that GUN5 is clearly much higher in clpc1, but we did not see strong evidence for cleavage products by MS. GUN4 levels were reduced (0.4×) in clps1 and not much changed in clpc1 or the double mutant (Figure 9D), with similar tendencies (but no statistical significance) observed by MS. GluTR is the key control point for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, whereas GUN4 improves Mg chelatase activity (CITATION). Immunoblotting using total leaf extracts showed that GluTR is upregulated in clps1 but downregulated in clpc1-1. GluTR could not be quantified by MS. To determine a possible molecular phenotype in clps1 clpc1, we performed quantitative comparative stromal proteome experiments as for the single mutants (Figure 7C). In total, 1077 proteins were identified with two or more adjSPC, giving rise to a total of 127,429 adjSPC (see Supplemental Data Set 5 online), and 793 proteins were located in the chloroplast and accounted for 95% of all adjSPC (see Supplemental Data Set 5 online). The Venn diagram shows the identified plastid proteins in the two genotypes, with 75% overlap (Figure 7C). The biological replicates were very similar, with Spearman correlation coefficients between replicates of the same genotype 0.96 (wt2) and 0.93 (clps1 clpc1), and PCA showed a clear double mutant proteome phenotype compared with the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). We first evaluated the molecular phenotype of clps1 clpc1 based on chloroplast protein mass investments in 34 functions, including statistical analysis (Figure 8; see Supplemental Table 2 online) and compared that with the single mutant analysis, as discussed above. Consistent with the visible phenotype, the double mutant showed a generally similar molecular phenotype to that of the clpc1 single mutant, with significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.01; t test) effects on eight functions. In particular, the double mutant showed downregulation of the Calvin cycle (by 30%), organic conversions (38%), and nucleotide metabolism (20%) and upregulation RNA metabolism (74%), isoprenoid metabolism (83%), vitamin biosynthesis (195%), ribosome biogenesis (100%), and metal homeostasis (52%) (Figure 8). Significance analysis (P < 0.01; GLEE) of differential accumulation of individual proteins in clps1 clpc1 compared with wild-type plants showed that 65 stromal proteins were upregulated and 19 were downregulated (see Supplemental Data Set 6 online). Comparison of the differentially expressed proteins in clps1 clpc1 to those of the single mutants shows that 22 were upregulated and four were downregulated in both clpc1 and clps1 clpc1 (see Supplemental Data Sets 3 and 6 online). This confirms that the phenotype of the double mutant strongly resembles clpc1, but with an interesting apparent molecular interaction effect on RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis (Figure 8), reflected by upregulation of proteins in both categories. In particular, RH3 DEAD box RNA helicase, RNA splice factor P67 (also named SVR7), PPR proteins AT5G46580 and pTAC2, rpoC2 RNA polymerase β (PEP-β), and several editing and splice factors were upregulated (respectively 8×, 3×, >50×, 14×, and 10×) in the double mutant. Interestingly, SVR7, pTAC2, and AT5G46580 are PPR proteins that also have a small MutS-related domain, often associated with endonuclease activity (on single strands) that might have a role in mismatch repair or genetic recombination (see Discussion). We note that RH3 was also strongly upregulated in the ClpPR core mutants clpr2-1, clpr4-1, and clpp3-1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), that RH3 is involved in RNA splicing and possibly ribosome biogenesis (CITATION), and that RNA splice factor SVR7 is a suppressor of a thylakoid FtsH protease mutant (CITATION) (see Discussion). ClpS1 showed the highest accumulation in developing rosettes where plastid protein synthesis is high. Furthermore, the proteomics phenotype of clps1 clpc1 showed a phenotype in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis factors (Figure 8), perhaps due to a synergistic clps1 and clpc1 interaction effect. Finally, one of the key functions of the Clp protease in E. coli (in particular ClpXP) is the removal of (SsrA-tagged) proteins resulting from stalled translation (CITATION). E. coli mutants that lack functional SsrA tagging showed increased sensitivity to several protein synthesis inhibitors, such as CAP, lincomycin (LIN), and spectinomycin (SPN) (CITATION). Although no SsrA tags have been found in plants, we postulated that perhaps the plastid Clp system is important to remove stalled nascent protein chains and that clps1 may show increased sensitivity to a translational defect in the chloroplast. To test the hypothesis, we grew wild-type, clps1, and clpc1 plants on agar plates (with 2% Suc) containing different concentrations of the prokaryotic-type translational inhibitors LIN (50, 75, and 100 μM), SPN (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 μg/mL), or CAP (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 μM) (Figure 10A; data not shown). These three inhibitors differ in their molecular mechanism (CITATION): (1) LIN interacts with the A- and P-site on the 50S subunit, hampering positioning of both tRNA molecules and directly inhibiting peptide bond formation; (2) SPN binds to the head region of the 30S subunit inhibiting EF-G catalyzed translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from A- to P-site; and (3) CAP occupies the position of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA, preventing peptide bond formation and resulting in stalled polysomes. Because of the capacity of CAP to stabilize/trap polysomes, it is frequently used in purification and analysis of plastid polysomes. As control, we also grew these plants on plates containing the cytosolic (80S) translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (0.3 to 0.4 μM) (Figure 10B). As expected, all three genotypes showed decreased plant growth and bleaching for the prokaryotic type inhibitors with increasing effects at increasing concentrations. However, only in the case of CAP did we observe visible and reproducible differences between clps1 and the other genotypes (the wild type and clpc1). Fresh rosette weight of wild-type seedlings was approximately fivefold reduced at 20 µM CAP and further decreased at high CAP concentrations (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). Chlorophyll and carotenoid content based on fresh weight in the wild type increased by ∼25% at 20 µM CAP and then gradually decreased (chlorophyll) or remained unchanged (carotenoids) with increasing CAP concentrations (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Importantly, growth on CAP resulted in reduced growth, development, and fresh weight (Figures 10A and 10C), as well as increased virescence and measurable loss of chlorophyll (per fresh weight) in clps1 compared with the wild type and clpc1 (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). No such differences between the wild type, clps1, and clpc1 were observed on CHX (Figure 10C). These results demonstrated a conditional phenotype in clps1 upon application of CAP, suggesting a functional linkage between protein synthesis and ClpS1-mediated proteolysis in the chloroplast, perhaps with ClpS1 playing a role in removing nascent chains from stalled ribosomes or through GluTR degradation (see also further below). It is not clear why LIN or SPN did not show similar genotype-specific effects. [[FIGURE]] To investigate this conditional phenotype in more detail, we performed a comparative proteome analysis of total leaf protein extracts of the wild type and clps1 after growth on 0, 30, or 40 μM CAP, using label-free MS-based quantification, similar to the previous experiments described above. In total, 2250 proteins were identified with two or more adjSPC, with a total of 101,634 matched adjSPC, and 767 proteins were located in the chloroplast and matched 56,857 adjSPC (56%) (see Supplemental Data Set 7 online). Increasing concentrations of CAP clearly decreased the relative plastid protein mass (by 31% at 40 μM CAP) in clps1 but not at all in the wild type, mostly by decreased investments in the light (43%) and dark (44%) reactions of photosynthesis (Figure 10D). The loss of plastid proteome is consistent with the visual and chlorophyll phenotypes, but the proteomics data did not provide an explanation for the higher sensitivity of clps1 for CAP. To identify direct candidate substrates for ClpS, we developed affinity-based experiments using recombinant GST-ClpS1 fusion protein with recombinant GST as control and the stromal proteome of clps1 clpc1 plants as source for potential ClpS1 substrates and/or ClpS1 interactors (Figure 11). We reasoned that substrates for ClpS1 should be overrepresented in stroma of clps1 clpc1 mutants, but not in the wild type. We incubated both GST and GST-ClpS1 affinity columns with isolated stromal proteome from chloroplasts isolated from young clps1 clpc1 seedlings and eluted potential interactors with reduced glutathione. The protein eluates were run on SDS-PAGE gels, stained with Coomassie blue, and the complete lane processed for protein identification and quantification by nano-liquid chromatography–MS/MS on the LTQ-Orbitrap. Figure 11A shows the SDS-PAGE image of one of three (pairwise) biological replicates. Using a similar bioinformatics workflow as for the previous proteome analysis, we identified 283 proteins (231 in plastids), with 22 proteins unique to GST controls and 191 proteins unique to the ClpS1-GST fusion affinity chromatography, and an overlap of 70 proteins (see Supplemental Data Set 8 online). The number of matched adjSPC was on average 4.5 times higher using ClpS1-GST compared with the negative control using GST, suggesting that we isolated a number of (putative) ClpS1 interactors. As expected, proteins identified with both ClpS1-GST and GST were dominated by proteins with known affinity for glutathione (e.g., glutathione transferase and glutaredoxin) and some of the very abundant stromal proteins (e.g., RBCL and Rubisco activase) and chaperones (e.g., CPN60). We further considered only the proteins uniquely identified in the ClpS1-GST affinity steps, removed additional redox proteins (various thioredoxins, and glutathione reductase and peroxidase), and required identification in each of the three replicates. This resulted in 51 remaining stroma-localized proteins. To select the most likely candidate substrates, affinity-purified proteins were required to have a 10-fold higher relative abundance (calculated based on NadjSPC) in the affinity eluates (see Supplemental Data Set 8 online) than in the stromal proteome of clps1 clpc1 or be absent in the unfractionated stroma (see Supplemental Data Set 5 online). Using this enrichment criterion, eight out of these 51 proteins remained as candidate substrates (Table 2, Figure 11B). These eight proteins were also enriched when compared with the wild type and single mutant stromal proteomes (Table 2). We consider those eight proteins as the best candidates for ClpS1 interactors and/or ClpS1 substrates; comments on their function are provided in the Discussion. [[FIGURE]] As described earlier, critical residues in ClpS1 for substrate interaction and N-degron binding have been identified in E. coli. Using this information, in vitro pull-down experiments in E. coli using ClpS1 mutated in these critical residues (D35A/D36A) allowed identification of two N-end rule substrates from ClpAS-depleted cell lysates (CITATION). We therefore created a mutant form of Arabidopsis ClpS1 harboring a double mutation in the corresponding residues D89A/N90A (Figure 2B) and repeated the affinity experiment using clps1 clpc1 stroma with three biological replicates (Figure 11; see Supplemental Data Set 8 online). In total, 110 proteins were identified (after removing glutathione interactors and thioredoxins), with 65 unique to the wild-type ClpS1 bait, 37 shared between both, and only eight unique to the ClpS1 D89A/N90A mutant construct (Figure 11). Out of the eight candidate substrates listed in Table 2, we identified five only with the wild-type ClpS1 bait, one (UVR domain protein) was identified with both baits, and the two least abundant proteins in Table 2 were not identified. This suggests that five of the candidate substrates require the conserved ClpS1 substrate binding site for interaction, whereas the interaction between the UVR protein and ClpS1 is governed by a different region. To verify the MS/MS-based analysis, we performed immunoblot analysis of the GST-ClpS1 affinity eluates using antisera against pTAC17, the UVR protein, and GluTR (Figure 11C). This confirmed that each of these is specifically enriched by the GST-ClpS1 affinity experiments, but not by GST alone. Furthermore, in agreement with the MS/MS-based quantification, pTAC17, and GluTR, but not the UVR protein, showed a near absolute requirement for the presence of the conserved DN residues in ClpS1. In E. coli, efficient degradation of a ClpS substrate is dependent on the N-degron, the presence of a short, unstructured region after the N-degron, and a short hydrophobic region in this unstructured linker region (CITATION; CITATION). We therefore explored the N-terminal region of the eight Arabidopsis candidate substrates. Because each of the substrates have predicted N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides that are removed after import into the chloroplast, we used the predicted cTP processing site (by TargetP) and mapped the peptides identified in the GST-ClpS affinity purifications onto the sequences (Figure 12). In an effort to identify N-terminal peptides with posttranslational modifications, such as deamidation or acetylation, or even an additional N-terminal residue postribosomally attached by an amino acid transferase (as in E. coli; see Introduction), we also did so-called error-tolerant searches using MASCOT. However, no additional N-terminal peptides were detected. We then predicted the secondary structure (using Jpred, http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/) and estimated the end points of the unstructured regions (immediately before α-helices or β-sheets). Finally, we color-coded hydrophobic, acidic, and basic residues (Figure 12). This collective information best describes the current information for the N-terminal sequence of the candidate substrates. [[FIGURE]] In case of the pyroxide oxidase domain (PYROX) and GluTR proteins, we likely identified the true N terminus by MS/MS as a semitryptic peptide (identified five times for GluTR and one time [with high ion score of 61] for PYROX), suggesting that these start with SAAQSS and ELSASS, respectively. For the other candidate substrates, the most N-terminal detected peptides were full tryptic, and the true N termini are likely upstream. Most of the candidate substrates had no predicted secondary structure around the N-terminal region and acidic residues (E/D) were underrepresented. These findings are consistent with patterns observed for ClpS substrates in E. coli. At this point, however, it would be premature to predict rules or motifs for chloroplast N-degrons recognized by ClpS1, given the uncertainty of the location of the N termini. Our efforts are now focused on the challenging task of determining these N-terminal residues, but also testing other recognition sites in ClpS1 candidate substrates.
!~MM~! Plant growth, genotyping, and RNA extraction were performed as described previously (CITATION), and additional growth conditions are detailed in the figure legends. The locations of T-DNA insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). The first strand was synthesized from equal amounts of total RNA with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). We tested 15, 20, 25, and 30 cycles for the primer pairs. Fifteen cycles were insufficient to visualize all transcripts, while 20 and 25 cycles best allowed us to visualize the transcripts, and we observed good linearity for 20 and 25 cycles. Primers for genomic PCR or RT-PCR analysis are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Details and references for the T-DNA insertion lines described in Table 1. For phylogenetic analysis of ClpS-related sequences, 57 ClpS proteins from Escherichia coli, five cyanobacterial species, two algal species, moss, and 19 angiosperms were aligned using MUSCLE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/). The aligned sequences were exported in Clustal format and viewed and edited (removal of gaps and/or variable extensions) in Jalview (www.jalview.org/). The alignment is available as Supplemental Data Set 1 online. Sequences were then converted in PHYLIP format, and phylogenetic trees were generated (1000 iterations) using the CIPRES Web portal (http://www.phylo.org/) using the tool RAxML HPC blackbox with the general time reversal model selected as the protein substitution matrix. RAxML bootstrap support values are shown at the nodes of the tree, in which the E. coli ClpS was designated as the outgroup, and ClpS relatives are classified into six clades. The resulting phylogenetic trees were annotated in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Sequence logos were generated using http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/. For antibiotic treatments, clps1, clpc1-1, and the wild type were grown with or without antibiotic (CAP and CHX) in half-strength Murashige and Skoog plates (0.5× Murashige and Skoog salts [Sigma-Aldrich], 1× Gamborg’s B5 vitamin [Sigma-Aldrich], 0.6% [w/v] Phytoblend [Caission Laboratories], and 2% [w/v] Suc, pH 5.7) under 10-h-light (40 µE m−2 s−1, 23°C)/14-h-dark (21°C) cycles for 14 or 20 to 21 days. For salt stress treatments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog plates with 2% Suc and 50, 100, 150, or 200 mM NaCl. For heat shock treatments, 20-d-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog plates were exposed to the following temperature stress treatments: (1) 38°C for 90 min, (2) 38°C for 3 h, or (3) 38°C for 90 min and then 45°C for 30 min. Following these treatments, plants were returned to normal growth conditions and monitored for 5 d. To test in vivo interaction between ClpS1, ClpC1, and ClpC2, chloroplasts were isolated from wild-type plants at leaf stage 1.07-1.08. Stromal proteins were prepared in the presence of ATPγS (5 mM) and separated using a Superose gel filtration column as described (CITATION). The eluates were collected and pooled into 14 fractions. Proteins in each fraction were then trichloroethanoic acid precipitated, and equal volumes were analyzed by immunoblotting and Ponceau staining. For testing the direct interaction of ClpS1 with ClpC1/C2/T1/T2, recombinant ClpS1-(His)6, ClpC2-(His)6, and ClpT1,T2-(His)6 proteins as well as GST, GST-ClpS1, and GST-N-domain of ClpC1 (residues 39 to 252) were generated in E. coli. Primer sequences used are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. ClpS1 cDNA was amplified by GST-ClpS forward and reverse primers and cloned into pGEX5X-1(GE Health Sciences) using NotI and EcoRI. To generate the site-specific mutant for Arabidopsis ClpS1 D89A/N90A (DN/AA), two pieces of cDNA was amplified using primers GST-ClpS forward/ClpS_DNAA reverse, and ClpS_DNAA forward/GST-ClpS reverse, and connected into one cDNA using GST-ClpS forward and reverse primers. After cloning using the pCR8/GW/TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and introduced into pGEX-5X-1 with NotI-EcoRI sites. For generation of recombinant GST, we used the pGEX-5X-1 vector. GST-ClpS1 and GST-ClpS1 DN/AA were expressed E. coli strain BL21 and Rosetta (DE3) cells, respectively, by adding 1 or 0.5 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h. Cells were broken by sonication in buffer containing PBS, pH 8.0, and 1 mM protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Both proteins were recovered in the soluble fraction and were further purified with a GST trap FF column (GE healthcare). After washing the GST trap column with PBS and GST elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl), proteins were eluted by 10 mM reduced GSH in the GST elution buffer and dialyzed at 4°C overnight in IPTG buffer. ClpT1 and ClpT2 were cloned out of an Arabidopsis cDNA library. The gene products were cloned into the expression vector pET-28b (Novagen). ClpT1/ClpT2 forward and reverse primers were used for cloning procedure. The plasmid pET28-ClpT1 and pET28-ClpT2 were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Proteins were induced with IPTG (1 mM final concentration) at 37°C for 3.5 h and purified by the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) His bind resin (Novagen) with a step gradient (40 to 250 mM imidazole with 30 mM increments, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and 300 mM NaCl). For ClpS1-(His)6, the gene product was amplified with ClpS-His6 primers and introduced into pET28b. The resulting vector was transformed into BL21 (DE3), and protein expression was induced at 37°C for 3.5 h with 1 mM IPTG. After purification using Ni-NTA resin, the fusion protein was dialyzed at 4°C overnight with PBS. The N-domain of ClpC1 was amplified from Arabidopsis cDNA library using ClpC1Ndomain forward and reverse primers, and the PCR product was directly cloned into EcoRI-SalI sites of pGEX-5X-1. The resulting plasmid DNA was introduced into Rosetta DE3 strain, and the ClpC1 N-domain was expressed at 37°C for 3 h with 1 mM IPTG. The N-domain protein was purified with glutathione sepharose 4B resin (GE) and 10 mM reduced glutathione and dialyzed in TBS buffer. Mature ClpC2 was amplified with Arabidopsis cDNA library and ClpC2 forward and reverse primers, and the gene product was directly introduced in NdeI-NcoI sites of the pET21a vector (Novagen). ClpC2 expression in the Rosetta DE3 strain was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37°C for 3 h. The protein was found predominantly in inclusion bodies, which were solubilized with 8 M urea. The urea-soluble lysate was subjected to affinity purification with Ni-NTA resin and 1 M imidazole, and the eluates were dialyzed against 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA. For ClpS1 interaction with ClpT1/T2 proteins or N-domain of ClpC1, GST fusions or GST and (His)6-tagged proteins were incubated for 90 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 15% glycerol, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and then the mixtures were combined with glutathione sepharose 4B resin equilibrated with the same buffer for 30 min at 4°C. The protein-bound resin was washed five times. Proteins were directly eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer at 75°C for 5 min. The input and eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. ClpS1 interaction with ClpC2 was analyzed by the same procedures except that purified ClpC2 was incubated in the presence or absence of ATPγS (4 mM) and combined with GST-ClpS1 or GST proteins. Purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against binding buffer [10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 50 mM KOAc, and 10% glycerol] and then coupled (20 min) to a GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). Arabidopsis stromal proteins (2 to 4 mg proteins) from clps1 clpc1 seedlings were diluted with the binding buffer to 20 mL and applied to the GST-ClpS- or GST-ClpS1 DN/AA-coupled column and incubated for 2 h with peristaltic pump at 4°C. The columns were washed twice with 10 to 20 mL of the binding buffer. Proteins that specifically interact with GST-ClpS1 or GST-ClpS1 DN/AA were eluted with 6 mL of 10 mM reduced glutathione in the binding buffer and concentrated to 150 μL using Amicon ultra-4 centrifuge filters (10 NMWL; Millipore). Twenty-five microliters of eluates were denatured in 4× Laemmli buffer, heated at 70°C for 10 min, separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coommassie Brilliant Blue R 250. Chloroplasts were isolated and separated into stromal and membrane fractions as described (CITATION). Total leaf proteins were extracted as described (CITATION). To quantify chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, seedlings were ground to a powder in liquid N2 and extracted with 80% acetone overnight in the dark at 4°C, followed by removal of cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at ∼15,000g. The chlorophyll and carotenoid quantifications were according to CITATION. Protein amounts were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) or the BCA protein assay kit (ThermoScientific). Total leaf extracts or stromal protein extracts were solubilized in 1% SDS and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.25. Fifty micrograms total leaf or stromal proteins were each run on Bio-Rad Criterion Tris-HCl precast gels (10.5 to 14% acrylamide gradient). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. Each of the gel lanes was cut into 10 bands followed by reduction, alkylation, and in-gel digestion with trypsin as described (CITATION). The GST-ClpS fusion protein was purified over a 1-mL GST column. After binding of the fusion protein to the column and subsequent washing with PBS buffer, ∼1 mL Factor Xa (Prozyme) in Factor Xa buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2) was loaded onto the column and allowed to incubate for 16 h at room temperature. The GST column was then assembled in tandem to an N-benzamidine column. Purified ClpS was eluted from the GST column (while GST remained bound) in Factor Xa buffer, and Factor Xa protease was purified over the N-benzamidine column to yield pure ClpS. This purified ClpS proteins was used for antisera production in rabbits using a commercial service (Cocalico Biologicals). For pTAC17 and UVR antibodies, the gene products were amplified with the specific primer sets and introduced into BamHI-XhoI (pTAC17) or EcoRI-XhoI (UVR) sites of the pET21a vector. Proteins were expressed in BL21 DE3 strain at 37°C for 3 h with 1 mM IPTG. pTAC17 protein was found in inclusion bodies and thus solubilized in 8 M urea, while UVR was soluble protein. After purification with the Ni-NTA affinity resin, both antigens were used for antisera production in rabbits (Alpha Diagnostics). For immunoblots, proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies using chemiluminescence for detection, following standard procedures. Antisera against ClpS1, pTAC17, and UVR proteins were generated in rabbits as described. Additional antisera were generous gifts from various colleagues as follows: GUN4, GUN5, CHLD, CHLI (R.M. Larkin), ClpC1 and ClpC2 (S. Rodermel), cpHSP70 (M. Nakai), GluTR (B. Grimm), and purchased from Agrisera. All MS data were collected using a LTQ-Orbitrap interfaced with a nano-liquid chromatography system and autosampler (Thermo) using data-dependent acquisition and dynamic exclusion (repeat count 2), with the Orbitrap portion operating at 100,000 resolution, essentially as described (CITATION). Peak lists (in .mgf format) were generated from RAW files using DTA supercharge software, and all .mgf files were recalibrated as by CITATION. Recalibrated files were searched with MASCOT v2.2 against TAIR10, including a small set of typical contaminants and the decoy (71,149 sequences; 29,099,754 residues). Three parallel searches (Mascot P value < 0.01; precursor ion window 700 to 3500 D) were performed: (1) full tryptic (6 ppm) with variable M-ox, Gln to pyro-Glu (N-termQ), N-term protein acetylation, and Fixed Cys-carbamido-methylation, two missed cleavages (in Mascot PR or PK does not count as missed cleavage); (2) semitryptic (3 ppm) with variable M-ox, N-term acetylation, Gln to pyro-Glu (N-termQ), and fixed Cys-carbamido-methylation, two missed cleavages; and (3) error-tolerant, full tryptic only (3 ppm) with variable M-ox and Fixed Cys-carbamido-methylation (no missed cleavage). Using a post-Mascot script, all search results were further filtered for minimum ion score of 33, but 35 for single peptide identifications. Proteins could be identified and quantified only with the full tryptic (6 ppm) search. Proteins identified by MS/MS spectra that were all shared with other proteins identified with unique peptides were discarded. The semitryptic and error-tolerant searches served to increase protein coverage; these additional search results were combined with the full tryptic search results using scripts as described (CITATION). The rationales for the selected modifications were as follows: variable M-ox is a common modification; fixed Cys-carbamido-methylation because all samples were alkylated; Gln to pyro-Glu (N-termQ) because it has been previously shown that this occurs very frequently (∼50%) (CITATION) and can be detected with great confidence due to the relatively large mass shift (−17.03 D); N-term protein acetylation in full tryptic because many proteins are N-terminally acetylated (note this occurs often after removal of N-terminal Met, but MASCOT allows for this removal of N-terminal Met, so these will be still full tryptic). N-term acetylation is semitryptic because many chloroplast proteins become N-terminally acetylated after removal cleavable transit peptide and it can be assigned with great confidence (CITATION, CITATION). PCA tests and Spearman rank correlation analyses were done using the statistical platform R. For statistical analysis of quantitative stromal protein comparison between the wild type, clps1, clpc1, and clps1 clpc1 based on the spectral counting, we used as input NadjSPC and the GLEE software, which was developed in MATLAB version 7 (MathWorks) (A. Poliakov, L. Ponnala, P.B.D. Olinares, Y. Asakura, and K.J. van Wijk, unpublished data). GLEE is essentially an improved version of the PLGEM software (CITATION), benchmarked against QSpec (CITATION), and tested by CITATION. GLEE was run in a Windows platform with a cubic polynomial equation fitting and 1000 iterations for estimation of variation.
