!~ABS~! The Toc core complex consists of the pore‐forming Toc75 and the GTPases Toc159 and Toc34. We confirm that the receptor form of Toc159 is integrated into the membrane. The association of Toc34 to Toc75/Toc159 is GTP dependent and enhanced by preprotein interaction. The N‐terminal half of the pSSU transit peptide interacts with high affinity with Toc159, whereas the C‐terminal part stimulates its GTP hydrolysis. The phosphorylated C‐terminal peptide of pSSU interacts strongly with Toc34 and therefore inhibits binding and translocation of pSSU into Toc proteoliposomes. In contrast, Toc159 recognises only the dephosphorylated forms. The N‐terminal part of the pSSU presequence does not influence binding to the Toc complex, but is able to block import into proteoliposomes through its interaction with Toc159. We developed a model of differential presequence recognition by Toc34 and Toc159.
!~RES~! Toc159 has been reported to exist in the cytosol as well as in the outer envelope membrane. A model was proposed in which Toc 159 binds to precursor proteins in the cytosol and targets them to the membrane. Owing to the implication that Toc159 functions before Toc34 in the import pathway, we thought it is important to reinvestigate this finding by following the procedure described (CITATION). Intact chloroplasts and cell debris were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation (500g). The presence of chloroplast proteins within the pellet was verified by immunoblotting (FIG-REF, lane 1). The supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation (105g, 2h). Toc159 was found in the pellet as well as in the supernatant fraction. Consistent with previously reported results (CITATION), Toc34 was restricted to the membrane pellet (lanes 2, 4). Toc64 and LHCPII were also restricted to the pellet fractions (lanes 2, 4, data not shown). Surprisingly, the outer envelope proteins Oep37 and Toc75 and the inner envelope proteins Tic110 and Tic40 were present in the soluble fractions as well (lanes 2, 4). Even after centrifugation at 3 × 105g for 2h, the integral membrane proteins Toc159, Toc75, Oep37, Tic110 and Tic40 partly remained in the supernatant (lane 5). Subsequently, we asked whether these envelope proteins are truly soluble forms or a result of partly disrupted chloroplasts leading to low‐density membrane shreds. First, we analysed the lipid content of the supernatants. We detected monogalactosyldiglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyldiglyceride (DGDG) in both supernatant fractions (FIG-REF, lanes 4, 6). The synthesis and presence of galactolipids within the plant cell is restricted to chloroplasts (CITATION), indicating the existence of chloroplast membrane shreds. Furthermore, we asked whether the ‘soluble’ form of Toc159 is present in membrane shreds by using Toc159 antiserum for coimmunoprecipitation. Translocon components as well as Oep37 were coimmunoprecipitated by Toc159 antiserum (FIG-REF, lane 2). Moreover, chloroplast lipids like MGDG and DGDG were also identified in the precipitate (FIG-REF, lane 6). In contrast, preimmunserum neither chloroplast envelope proteins nor lipids were precipitated (FIG-REF, lane 1; FIG-REF, lane 4). When the soluble nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) was immunoprecipitated (FIG-REF, lane 2), neither lipids (FIG-REF, lane 6) nor other proteins (not shown) could be detected. To confirm the lipid association of Toc159, we used antibodies against MGDG or DGDG (CITATION). Using these antibodies, we could precipitate Toc159 (FIG-REF, lane 2), confirming its lipid association. [[FIGURE]] We now asked whether membrane fragments with low protein content are not pelleted under the described conditions (CITATION). For this, proteoliposomes containing Toc75 were centrifuged (105g or 3 × 105g, 2h). Indeed, Toc75 proteoliposomes remained in the supernatant (FIG-REF, lanes 1, 2). Only after centrifugation at 6 × 105g for 2h, Toc75 proteoliposomes were recovered in the pellet fraction (FIG-REF, lane 6). We therefore investigated whether Toc159 can be pelleted out of the leaf extract at 6 × 105g. After centrifugation for 2h, Toc159 could only be detected in the pellet fraction together with Tic110 and Tic40 (FIG-REF, lanes 1, 4). In contrast, the soluble glycerinaldehyde‐P‐dehydrogenase (GAPDH) remained in the supernatant (lane 6). Additional evidence that the 6 × 105g pelleted envelope proteins are embedded in membrane fragments was obtained by treating the cell extract with phospholipases to disrupt bilayer structure and integrity. After phospholipase treatment, some of the Toc159 and Tic110 appeared in the supernatant of the 6 × 105g spin (FIG-REF, lanes 5, 6). Only Tic40 remained in the pellet (lanes 2, 3), which might be a result of aggregation. Again, the distribution of GAPDH was not affected by the addition of lipases (lanes 5, 6). Toc159 was previously described as an integral membrane protein (CITATION; CITATION). Performing immunogold labelling with antibodies against a C‐terminal portion of Toc159, we found that 80% of the gold particles are located in the interior of the vesicles. This indicates that sections of the C‐terminal part of Toc159 face towards the intermembrane space (FIG-REF, left side). In line with published results (CITATION), 80% of the gold particles while using Toc34 antibodies were detected on the outside of the outer envelope vesicles (OEVs). The integral membrane nature of Toc159 is further consistent with its resistance against extraction by a chaotropic reagent (FIG-REF, lane 1) or sodium carbonate (CITATION). For further topology studies of Toc159, OEVs were first treated with trypsin leading to the 52kDa fragment of Toc159 (FIG-REF, lanes 2, 7), which is not extractable by high pH (lane 8). When the proteolysed OEVs were Na2CO3 extracted in the presence of trypsin to digest intermembrane space‐facing regions, the 52kDa fragment was degraded to smaller fragments. This and the presence of a fairly stable peptide of 20kDa (lane 9–11, triangle) suggest the existence of intermembrane space‐facing regions of Toc159. Trypsin treatment of Triton X‐100‐solubilised OEVs revealed the same result (data not shown). In contrast, the 52kDa domain remained protease insensitive (lanes 4–6) when noncarbonate‐treated but washed OEVs were treated with trypsin. Previously, it was shown that protease treatment of OEVs results in the appearance of an 8kDa fragment of Toc34 (CITATION) and a 55kDa fragment of Toc75 (CITATION). Therefore, the proteolysis of these peptides was used as an indicator of the accessibility of intermembrane space‐facing regions after membrane disruption by carbonate treatment (lanes 12–16, square and arrow). [[FIGURE]] Taken together, we conclude that the identified soluble Toc159 indeed represents a membrane‐bound population present in lipid shreds, which do not pellet by a simple 105g centrifugation step. The results further establish that Toc159 is not a cytosolic protein and that the 52kDa M‐domain comprises an intermembrane space‐facing part, which might contain multiple membrane‐spanning regions. Thus, all interactions among precursor, Toc159 and Toc34 must occur on the membrane. Previous studies established that Toc34 binds to precursors via their transit peptide, but the question of Toc159 binding to the precursor has not been adequately addressed. Outer envelope proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, followed by renaturation. Subsequently, the binding of a 35S‐radiolabelled nonphosphorylated form of pSSU, as well as of 32P‐radiolabelled phosphorylated pSSU, to outer envelope proteins was assayed (FIG-REF). The binding was analysed in the absence or presence of GMP‐PNP. GMP‐PNP was previously found to enhance the binding of pSSU to Toc34 (CITATION), to Toc159 (CITATION) and to the Toc complex, respectively (CITATION). GMP‐PNP strongly stimulated the binding of both pSSU forms to Toc34 (FIG-REF, lanes 1–4). Similarly, the interaction of the nonphosphorylated form of pSSU with Toc159 was stimulated by GMP‐PNP (lanes 1, 2). However, no interaction of Toc159 with the phosphorylated pSSU was detected (lanes 3, 4). Furthermore, neither the phosphorylated nor the nonphosphorylated pSSU interacts with the outer envelope protein Oep37, which served as a negative control (upper part). The identity of the protein bands was confirmed by immunoblotting (lower part). The same was observed when proteoliposomes containing Toc159f, Toc34 or Oep16 were incubated with expressed and in vitro phosphorylated pSSU (FIG-REF, upper part), wheat germ in vitro translated and phosphorylated pSSU (middle part), or in reticulocyte lysate in vitro translated nonphosphorylated pSSU (lower part) in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5) or presence of GMP‐PNP (lanes 2, 4, 6). As before, Toc34 (lanes 5, 6) recognises pSSU with higher affinity in its GMP‐PNP‐bound stage. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the pSSU drastically enhances this interaction. In contrast, Oep16 and Toc159f only revealed background binding to the phosphorylated preprotein (lanes 1–4). As shown before, Toc159f interacts with the nonphosphorylated form of pSSU in a GMP‐PNP‐dependent manner (lanes 3, 4, lower part), whereas, as expected, Oep16 shows no binding at all (lanes 1, 2). [[FIGURE]] The observed nucleotide dependence of the interaction between Toc159 and the preprotein could also be assembled while incubation of immobilised pSSU with Toc159f in the absence or presence of different nucleotides. The strongest binding of Toc159f to pSSU was observed in the presence of GTP and GMP‐PNP (FIG-REF, lanes 1, 3). The less pronounced binding of Toc159 to pSSU in the presence of GTP in comparison to GMP‐PNP is probably due to a partial hydrolysis of GTP, which converts Toc159 to its GDP‐bound state with a reduced affinity to the precursor protein (lane 3). No effect on the binding efficiency of Toc159 to pSSU by adenine nucleotides was observed (FIG-REF). We therefore conclude that the interaction between Toc159 and the nonphosphorylated pSSU is GTP‐specific. To define the part of the presequence that interacts with Toc159, three peptides of the presequence of pSSU, E2, A1 or B2 (FIG-REF), were used. The peptides were coupled via a C‐terminal cysteine to thiol‐activated sepharose. Toc159f (FIG-REF, lanes 1–3) was preincubated with GTP (lanes 4–6), GMP‐PNP (lanes 7–9) or GDP (lanes 10–12), and then incubated with the affinity matrices. A strong interaction of Toc159f with the N‐terminal peptide E2 was observed under all conditions tested (lanes 3, 6, 12), except in the presence of GDP (lane 9). In contrast, the binding of Toc159f to the nonphosphorylated peptide A1 increased in the presence of GMP‐PNP in comparison to GTP or the absence of nucleotides (lanes 1, 4, 10). As before, the increment of Toc159f binding to A1 in the presence of GMP‐PNP in comparison to GTP might be caused by GTP hydrolysis of Toc159f (lanes 6–9). In contrast, Toc159f recognises the phosphorylated C‐terminal peptide (B2) to a lower extent than A1 and E2 (FIG-REF). The last result is consistent with the lack of Toc159f binding to phosphorylated pSSU (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] As a complementary approach, immobilised pSSU was incubated with Toc159f or Toc159f‐GMP‐PNP in the presence of peptides (A1, B2, E2) as competitors of binding (FIG-REF, lanes 2, 7) and the remaining interaction analysed by immunostaining. E2 preincubation reduces Toc159f binding to pSSU in the absence and presence of GMP‐PNP, suggesting a strong nucleotide‐independent interaction of Toc159f to this peptide (lanes 5, 10). A1 and B2 show no competition to pSSU binding by Toc159f in the absence and presence of GMP‐PNP (lanes 3, 8). Comparison between the competition of pSSU binding by A1 (lane 8) or E2 (lane 10) and the direct binding of Toc159 to A1 (FIG-REF, lane 10) and E2 (lane 12) in the presence of GMP‐PNP suggests that Toc159 can recognise the N‐terminal portion of the presequence even though the binding pocket for the C‐terminal portion is occupied but not vice versa. In contrast, Toc159f does not bind to the empty column material (FIG-REF, lanes 1, 6). As a control for the experiment, we performed a competition assay using isolated Toc34, which revealed the strongest inhibition of pSSU binding by the phosphorylated peptide B2 in the presence of GMP‐PNP (FIG-REF, lane 9). We conclude that a strong GTP‐independent interaction of Toc159 occurs at the N‐terminal part of the pSSU transit peptide. The results from FIG-REF and FIG-REF suggested a conversion of GTP into GDP by Toc159 in the presence of a preprotein. In order to test for a potential GTPase activity of Toc159, Toc159f was incubated with α32P‐GTP. As has been found for Toc34 (CITATION), Toc159f showed a slow endogenous GTP hydrolysis activity (FIG-REF, lane 2). Therefore, the effect of pSSU on Toc159f GTPase activity was investigated. Under the conditions used, pSSU was found to stimulate GTPase activity of Toc159f by about four‐fold (FIG-REF; for line and symbol description, see figure legend) compared to intrinsic hydrolysis. Furthermore, utilising the peptides A1, B2, E2 and the combinations A1 and E2, and B2 and E2, the stimulating activity could be localised to the peptide A1, while E2 or B2 had no influence on the GTPase activity. Interestingly, this peptide is recognised by Toc159f with lower affinity than the N‐terminal peptide E2 (FIG-REF). In contrast, GTP hydrolysis by Toc34 was not affected by addition of the peptides (FIG-REF). We further asked how the peptides A1, B2 and E2 affect the GTPase activity of the isolated complex. It had been shown previously that pSSU stimulates GTP hydrolysis of the isolated complex (CITATION). Herein, we could demonstrate a stimulating effect of the A1 peptide on the GTPase activity of the Toc complex (FIG-REF). We conclude that the increased GTPase activity of the Toc complex by A1 is due to Toc159. [[FIGURE]] Toc34 and Toc159 function as receptor proteins. One central question still remained: how is the association of the two receptor proteins regulated? As both proteins are GTPases, we asked whether GTP or GDP affects the stability of the Toc complex. Therefore, solubilised OEVs were incubated with GDP or GMP‐PNP. Subsequently, antisera against Toc34 or Toc159 were used for immunoprecipitation (FIG-REF). All the three Toc core components were coimmunoprecipitated with the same efficiency in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of GMP‐PNP by either Toc34 (FIG-REF, lanes 1, 3) or Toc159 antiserum (lanes 5, 7). In contrast, incubation with GDP leads to a reduced coimmunoprecipitation of Toc159 by Toc34 antiserum and vice versa (lanes 2, 6). Interestingly, the amount of coimmunoprecipitated Toc75 by Toc34 antiserum in the presence of GDP is reduced as well (lane 2), whereas Toc159 antiserum coimmunoprecipitates Toc75 in a similar manner regardless of added nucleotides (lanes 5–7), suggesting a nucleotide‐independent association of Toc159 and Toc75. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by using preimmunsera (lanes 4, 8) and by investigating the presence of the outer envelope protein Oep24 as control protein. Although small amounts of Oep24 were coimmunoprecipitated by the used Toc34 antiserum (lanes 1–3), it presents only a small portion of total Oep24 content in OEVs (lane OE). Furthermore, Toc75, Toc159 and Toc34 were not coimmunoprecipitated by Oep24 antibodies regardless of the added nucleotides (FIG-REF, lanes 3–5). Therefore, we consider the precipitation of Oep24 as an unspecific reaction. [[FIGURE]] To confirm our observation, the stability of the Toc complex was analysed during isolation by sucrose gradient centrifugation. OEVs were incubated with EDTA, GDP or GMP‐PNP before solubilisation and subjected to linear sucrose gradient centrifugation. In the presence of GMP‐PNP, the Toc components are enriched in higher density fractions as compared to the absence of nucleotide (FIG-REF, right and left parts). In the presence of GDP, Toc components migrate only to lower‐density fractions (middle part). Subsequently, Toc complex‐containing fractions in the absence of nucleotides (left part) were pooled and incubated in the presence and absence of GMP‐PNP or GDP. The samples were subjected to a sucrose step‐gradient centrifugation. In the presence of GMP‐PNP, the amount of Toc components, especially Toc34, is enriched in fractions of higher density in comparison to the amount in the absence of nucleotides (FIG-REF, left and middle parts). In the presence of GDP, no Toc components were found in a fraction of high sucrose concentrations (FIG-REF, middle part). The results from linear and step‐gradient analysis of the Toc complex suggest that GMP‐PNP leads to a stabilisation of the Toc complex, whereas GDP weakens the interaction between the Toc components (FIG-REF). To further determine the role of the two GTPases in Toc stability, we analysed the interaction between Toc159 and Toc34 in vitro. We used Toc159f eluted from SDS–PAGE, which contains the G‐ and M‐domain. We assume that the A‐domain might not affect this interaction as drastically, since Toc159 lacking the A‐domain is capable of promoting protein translocation in protoplasts (CITATION). Toc34 was bound to a Ni‐NTA column via a His‐tag. Subsequently, the immobilised Toc34 was incubated with GDP (FIG-REF, lanes 4–6, 9, 10) or GMP‐PNP (lanes 1–3, 7, 8). The Toc34 affinity matrix was incubated with Toc159 (lanes 1, 4) preloaded with GMP‐PNP (lanes 3, 6–8) or GDP (lanes 2, 5, 9, 10). This approach allowed a different nucleotide‐loaded stage of both GTPases. The amount of bound Toc159 was determined. The binding of Toc159 to Toc34GDP (lanes 4–6) was slightly increased in comparison to Toc34GMP‐PNP (lanes 1–3). Toc159GMP‐PNP binds to Toc34 to the same extent as nucleotide‐free Toc159 (lanes 1, 3, 4, 6). In contrast, Toc159GDP shows reduced binding to Toc34 (lanes 2, 5). As Toc34GMP‐PNP recognises pSSU with higher affinity compared to the nucleotide‐free receptor (CITATION), we investigated the effect of the pSSU transit peptide on the interaction between Toc159 and Toc34. Therefore, we incubated both receptors in the presence of GMP‐PNP with peptides covering parts of the pSSU presequence (FIG-REF). The N‐terminal peptide (E2) was combined either with peptides covering the nonphosphorylated (A1) or the phosphorylated C‐terminal part (B2). Both peptide mixtures showed a strong stimulation of the interaction between the Toc GTPases in the GMP‐PNP stage in comparison to peptide‐free conditions (FIG-REF, lanes 3, 7, 8). In contrast, the interaction between both receptors loaded with GDP was drastically reduced (lanes 5, 9, 10). Taken together, the Toc complex is stabilised by GMP‐PNP, whereas Toc159GDP favours Toc34 dissociation (FIG-REF). The binding of transit peptide further strengthened the interaction between the two GTPases in the GMP‐PNP state. Having established that Toc159 recognises the N‐terminal peptide with highest affinity, whereas the C‐terminal peptide induces the GTPase function of the receptor, we asked whether the different peptides could influence protein import. Isolated chloroplasts were preincubated with the different peptides and import initiated by the addition of radiolabelled pSSU (FIG-REF). Preincubation with B2 and E2 led to a decrease of import yield of about 50%, whereas A1 did not reveal any effect (lanes 2–4), supporting our earlier result that B2 and E2 in contrast to A1 bind strongly to Toc34 and Toc159, respectively (FIG-REF). As expected, preincubation with expressed full‐length pSSU almost completely abolishes the import of radiolabelled pSSU (FIG-REF, lane 5). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that this observation shows an effect on the core translocon, we reconstituted the isolated Toc complex in liposomes (CITATION). Proteoliposomes were incubated with radiolabelled pSSU in the presence of GMP‐PNP to stimulate binding (FIG-REF, lanes 15, 16) or GTP to promote import (lanes 23, 24). To differentiate between the bound and the imported pSSU, proteoliposomes were treated with trypsin in order to digest surface‐bound preproteins, whereas imported pSSU remains unaffected (CITATION). In the presence of GMP‐PNP, the precursor remains protease sensitive, indicating its presence on the surface of the liposomes (lane 16), while in the presence of GTP pSSU was protease resistant, indicating translocation into the proteoliposomes (lane 24). Proteoliposomes were then preincubated with the peptides A1, B2 or E2 before addition of precursor protein (lanes 1–6, 9–14, 17–22). A1 slightly reduces the binding of pSSU in the absence or presence of GMP‐PNP compared to the amount of bound pSSU in the absence of peptides (lanes 3, 11). However, A1 does not impair the import of pSSU into proteoliposomes because the protease‐protected form of pSSU was found (lane 20). In contrast, E2 reduces pSSU binding in the absence of nucleotides (lane 5) and inhibits the import of pSSU like B2 (lanes 18, 22). Under binding conditions in the presence of GMP‐PNP, B2 is the only peptide reducing pSSU interaction to the proteoliposomes (lane 9). This observation can be explained by a preceded binding of B2 to Toc34, while the interaction of Toc159 with E2 takes place at a later stage and inhibits import. Next, proteoliposomes were loaded with a stromal extract containing the precursor‐processing peptidase (CITATION). The processing event of pSSU to mSSU (mature form of pSSU) indicates a successful import reaction (FIG-REF, lane 1). To reveal the specificity of the peptides, the assays were conducted with proteoliposomes containing the Toc complex (Toc159, Toc75 and Toc34; upper part) or Toc159 and Toc75 as a minimal import‐competent unit (lower part; CITATION). The proteoliposomes were then incubated with A1, B2 or E2, before addition of the full‐length precursor. The B2 and E2 peptides are able to inhibit translocation of pSSU in proteoliposomes containing the Toc complex (lanes 5, 7, upper part), whereas only E2 prevents pSSU import into proteoliposomes containing Toc159 and Toc75 (lanes 7–8, lower part). This result supports the observation that B2 is strongly bound by Toc34 and not by Toc159, whereas E2 is only recognised by Toc159 with high affinity (FIG-REF). In contrast, the import of pSSU into proteoliposomes with the reconstituted Toc complex is only slightly reduced by the presence of A1 (lane 4, upper part). This can be explained by the low‐affinity binding of A1 by Toc34 (CITATION). Preincubation with A1 does not affect import into proteoliposomes with reconstituted Toc159 and Toc75. This result indicates a transient interaction of Toc159 to A1, because it is capable of stimulating GTP‐hydrolysis of Toc159 but it does not block the import event. To confirm the activity of the signal peptidase in all cases, membranes were solubilised to release the signal peptidase, resulting in processing of pSSU (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8). To confirm that the preprotein has to be dephosphorylated in order to be recognised by Toc159 and to be transported across the membrane, the translocation of pSSU in vitro translated in reticulocyte lysate (FIG-REF, upper part), in wheat germ lysate (resulting in phosphorylation, middle part) or pSSU purified and in vitro phosphorylated into Toc‐proteoliposomes was studied. In line with previous results, translocation of pSSU‐Ret was only achieved in the presence of GTP (lane 4; CITATION), resulting in a protease‐resistant form. When phosphorylated pSSU was used (middle, lower part), no protease‐resistant pSSU could be observed, indicating that phosphorylated pSSU cannot be translocated across the membrane.
!~MM~! The peptides A1, B2 and E2 were synthesised at the Department of Peptide and Protein Chemistry, Charite (Berlin, Germany). The used antisera were raised as described (CITATION). Lipids for reconstitution were supplied by Nutfield Nurseries (Surrey, UK), Ni‐NTA2+ column material by Quiagen (Hilden, Germany), AfTresyl Toyopearl 650M by TosoHaas (Tokyo, Japan), n‐decyl‐maltoside by Glycon GmbH (Luckenwalde, Germany) and nucleotides by Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio‐Rad Laboratories protein assay (Hercules, USA). The expression and purification of Toc34 and Toc75 were conducted as described (CITATION; CITATION). The Toc complex and Toc159 were isolated as in CITATION. Soluble leaf extract was isolated following the published protocol (CITATION), with the exception that a 3 × 105 or 6 × 105g centrifugation was performed alternatively as the final step. Lipid extraction of the soluble fractions was earlier described (CITATION). For electron microscopy, OEVs were incubated with primary and secondary 15nm gold‐labelled antibodies as described (CITATION). For analysis, cold particles were counted and data processed using Sigma Plot. Isolated OEVs (120μg protein) were pelleted (256000g, 10min, 4°C) and resuspended in 20mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 120mM NaCl, 0.5mM CaCl2, 1mM β‐mercaptoethanol. After incubation of the mixture with trypsin (0.05μg/μl final) for 15min at 20°C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1μg/μl trypsin inhibitor and PMSF (2mM final). Subsequently, membranes were extracted by incubation with Na2CO3 (100mM final) for 20min on ice, followed by recovery of the membranes (256000g, 10min, 4°C). After resuspension in 200μl buffer, the trypsin treatment was performed as described above. At indicated time points, 50μl aliquots were removed and the proteolytic reaction was stopped by protease inhibitors. OEVs were solubilised by incubation with 1.5% n‐decylmaltoside, 25mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl for 5min at 20°C. Unsolved particles were removed (105g, 10min, 4°C) and the supernatant was diluted 10 times in IP‐buffer (25mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% n‐decylmaltoside) including 0.05% egg albumin. After the addition of 15μl antiserum to the mixture, the sample was incubated for 1h at 20°C, followed by incubation with 50μl in IP‐buffer pre‐equilibrated protein‐A sepharose (Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany) for 1h at 20°C. After washing with IP buffer, the bound protein was eluted by cooking in SDS–PAGE loading buffer. The eluted fractions were separated by SDS–PAGE and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunodecorated with the indicated antisera. The coimmunoprecipitation of soluble cell extract fractions was conducted as outlined above. For binding analysis, recombinant Toc34 was coupled via a C‐terminal His‐tag on Ni2+‐NTA material to a final concentration of 0.1mg/ml column resin. The concentration of bound pSSU on Toyopearl material was 1mg/ml. The peptides of pSSU presequence were coupled to thiol‐activated sepharose to 0.6mg/ml resin. Each assay was performed with 20μl of the coated material, which was pre‐equilibrated with binding buffer (20mM Tricine (pH 7.6); 50mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X‐100, 0.1% BSA, 0.1mM DTT, 1mM MgCl2) before incubation with 250ng Toc159f for 30min at RT. Peptides of the pSSU presequence and nucleotides were added to 5μM and 0.5mM final concentrations, respectively, and incubated with Toc159 before addition to the affinity matrix. After washing the column with binding buffer, the bound protein was eluted either by 250mM imidazol in binding buffer (for Ni2+‐NTA) or with 8M urea (for toyopearl or thiol‐activated sepharose material). The eluted samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE analysis and immunoblotting. The renaturation assay was performed as described (CITATION). Nonphosphorylated 35S‐labelled pSSU was synthesised by in vitro transcription and translation (CITATION). 32P‐labelled pSSU was yielded by incubation of 10μg preprotein with wheat germ kinase fraction and 32P‐ATP (CITATION). Binding of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated pSSU was performed in coupling buffer (20mM Tricine/KOH (pH 7.6), 15mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT) in the presence or absence of 0.5mM GMP‐PNP at 20°C for 2h. After washing with the coupling buffer, bound preprotein was visualised by autoradiography. GTP hydrolysis of isolated Toc34, Toc159 and Toc complex was measured as described (CITATION). Import into isolated chloroplasts was performed as in CITATION. The synthesis of the liposomes, the reconstitution of the Toc components and the binding/import assay were performed as described (CITATION). For import competition analysis, 5μM of pSSU presequence peptides were added to the reaction mix as indicated.
