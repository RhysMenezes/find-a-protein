!~ABS~! Sgt1 is an adaptor protein implicated in a variety of processes, including formation of the kinetochore complex in yeast, and regulation of innate immunity systems in plants and animals. Sgt1 has been found to associate with SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, the CBF3 kinetochore complex, plant R proteins and related animal Nod-like receptors, and with the Hsp90 molecular chaperone. We have determined the crystal structure of the core Hsp90–Sgt1 complex, revealing a distinct site of interaction on the Hsp90 N-terminal domain. Using the structure, we developed mutations in Sgt1 interfacial residues, which specifically abrogate interaction with Hsp90, and disrupt Sgt1-dependent functions in vivo, in plants and yeast. We show that Sgt1 bridges the Hsp90 molecular chaperone system to the substrate-specific arm of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, suggesting a role in SCF assembly and regulation, and providing multiple complementary routes for ubiquitination of Hsp90 client proteins.
!~RES~! We explored a range of Hsp90 and Sgt1 constructs from different species and obtained diffracting crystals of the core Hsp90–Sgt1 complex using an N-terminal domain construct of Hordeum vulgare (barley) Hsp90 and a CS domain construct from the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue, AtSgt1a. HvHsp90 is 64% identical to yeast Hsp82 and 70% identical to human Hsp90β, whereas AtSgt1a is 32 and 36% identical, respectively, to its yeast and human homologues. The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement with the crystal structure of yeast Hsp90-N domain and the NMR structure of human Sgt1-CS domain. The crystals contain three independent copies of the complex, each with a bound ADP molecule, and has been refined at 3.3-Å resolution (see Materials and methods and CITATION). The structure of yeast and human Hsp90-N domains has been described earlier (CITATIONet al, 1997; CITATIONet al, 1997) and the barley Hsp90-N domain is essentially identical in structure (r.m.s.d. ∼0.75 and 0.67 Å, respectively for 198 and 172 common Cα positions). The mobile ‘lid' segment, which closes over the nucleotide-binding pocket in the ATP-bound closed state of the Hsp90 (CITATIONet al, 2006), is in a fully open conformation in the Hsp90-N–Sgt1-CS complex, and an ADP molecule is present in the nucleotide-binding pocket. The AtSgt1a CS domain has the same β3–β4 ‘sandwich' structure seen in the NMR structure of HsSgt1-CS domain (CITATIONet al, 2004), with small differences in the conformation of the loops connecting the β-strands. The crystal lattice is such that each of the β-sheet faces of the Sgt1-CS domain structure contacts a different Hsp90-N domain through distinct regions (CITATION). Although a single Sgt1 molecule might interact simultaneously with both-N domains in an Hsp90 dimer, this is inconsistent with the ∼1:1 binding stoichiometry suggested by ITC (CITATION). It is most likely that one of the Hsp90–Sgt1 interfaces is the biologically significant interaction, whereas the other is a lattice contact necessary for crystal formation. To identify the biologically significant interface, we analysed the conservation of the residues involved. In the case of Hsp90, which is highly conserved throughout, there was no clear difference between the two points of contact with Sgt1-CS in the crystal. However, Sgt1 showed a marked difference, with the residues involved in one interaction being very much more conserved overall, and with some contributing residues (Tyr157, Lys221 and Glu223) identical in all species (CITATION; CITATION). The conserved interface is formed by residues from strands one, two and three from the four-stranded face of Sgt1-CS and the first strand and third helix of Hsp90-N domain (CITATION). The core interaction is provided by Tyr157 from AtSgt1a, the hydroxyl group of which hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Glu6 and Lys88 of HvHsp90, whereas its aromatic face packs into a hydrophobic recess on HvHsp90 formed by the side chains of Phe8, Val92 and Lys88, and the main chain of Ser89. Sgt1 Tyr157 is absolutely conserved, as are all the interacting residues in Hsp90, apart from Ser89, which is alanine in non-plant Hsp90s. Phe168 provides a second hydrophobic interaction, packing between the side chains of Thr87, Asp144 and Asp145 on Hsp90. Phe168 is also highly conserved, being phenylalanine in plants and yeast, and methionine in metazoa. These hydrophobic interactions are supported by an extensive network of polar interactions involving Arg153, Glu155, Thr166, Lys170, Lys221 and Glu223 from Sgt1, and Ser89, Asn93, Asp144, Asp145 and Glu146 from Hsp90 (CITATION). All the Sgt1 residues involved are at least very highly conserved, whereas the Hsp90 residues, with the exception of Ser89, are invariant. The Sgt1-CS interaction site on Hsp90 does not involve the mobile lid segment nor does it impinge upon the ATP-binding pocket at the heart of the N domain (CITATION). Although the conservation pattern clearly identifies the biologically significant Hsp90–Sgt1 interface, we were concerned to verify this interaction outside the context of a crystal lattice. We examined the effect of mutations in residues on the surface of AtSgt1a-CS, on its ability to interact with the HvHsp90-N domain, using the Y2H system (CITATIONet al, 2007). Mutations of AtSgt1a-Tyr199, at the heart of the non-conserved crystal lattice contact, had no effect on the Y2H interaction with Hsp90, nor did mutation of AtSgt1a-Thr220 on the periphery of the conserved interface. However mutations of Tyr157, Phe168, Lys221 and Glu223, in the conserved interface, all significantly diminished the interaction, confirming its functional significance (CITATION). None of these mutations affected the Y2H interaction with AtRAR1, the interaction of which is mediated by a different region of the AtSgt1a-CS domain (CITATIONet al, 2007), confirming that these mutations do not disrupt CS domain folding. To confirm that this interaction was conserved across species, we used an in vitro co-precipitation assay with human homologues to follow Hsp90–Sgt1 interactions in solution (see Materials and methods), and compared the interaction of wild-type Sgt1 with mutants intended to disrupt the conserved Sgt1–Hsp90 interface. GST-tagged full-length wild-type human Sgt1 efficiently co-precipitated hHsp90β (CITATION). In contrast, Arg or Ala mutations of Tyr145 (equivalent to AtSgt1a-Tyr157), significantly decreased the ability of hSgt1 to co-precipitate hHsp90β. Using the plant system, we mutated several residues in the wheat (Triticum aestivum) Hsp90-N domain that are involved in the interface with Sgt1, which also involves the equivalent of Tyr157. Mutation of TaHsp90 Ser89 and Val92, both of which directly contact AtSgt1a Tyr157 to Glu and Thr, respectively, significantly decreased their ability to be co-precipitated by GST–AtSgt1a when compared with wild type. By contrast an Ala99Glu mutant, which is not directly involved in this interface, was efficiently co-precipitated (CITATION). Taken together, the strong conservation of the residues on the four-stranded face involved in interaction with Hsp90 and the disruption of that interaction, in vitro and in the Y2H system, by mutations on either side of that interface argue very strongly that this is the biologically authentic site of interaction between the two proteins and that it is both necessary and sufficient for that interaction. Yeast Sgt1p binds simultaneously to yHsp90 (Hsp82p) and ySkp1p, suggesting that it functions as an adaptor linking the two proteins (CITATION). We verified this interaction using the human proteins and observed co-precipitation of hSkp1 with His6-tagged hHsp90α only in the presence of hSgt1 (CITATION). With the Tyr145Arg or Tyr145Ala hSgt1 mutants, no hSkp1 was co-precipitated. However, GST fusions of both hSgt1 mutants were fully competent in co-precipitating hSkp1, confirming that the Hsp90- and Skp1-interacting regions of Sgt1 are functionally independent (CITATION). Skp1 is functionally associated with a variety of proteins containing an ‘F-box'—a small helical-coil domain that mediates interaction with the C-terminal part of Skp1 in the context of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases (CITATIONet al, 2005). Previous studies have shown that interaction with Skp1 is mediated by the TPR domain of Sgt1 (CITATION). As TPR domains are also helical-coil structures, we considered the possibility that Sgt1 might be a cryptic ‘F-box' protein and interact with the same site on Skp1. To test this, we co-expressed human Skp1 with Skp2, an F-box protein that mediates the recruitment of p27kip1 to SCF complexes (CITATIONet al, 2005), which would therefore compete with Sgt1 if it interacted with the F-box-binding site on Skp1. We found that the Skp1–Skp2 complex or a Skp1–Skp2(F-box) complex was fully able to co-precipitate Sgt1, without competitive displacement of Skp2 with increasing concentrations of Sgt1 (CITATION). This suggests that Sgt1 interacts primarily with the N-terminal lobe of Skp1 and can coexist in Skp1 complexes with Skp2 (and probably other F-box proteins), the binding site of which is in the C-terminal lobe. As well as binding F-box proteins, Skp1 binds to Cullin scaffold proteins such as Cul1, through its N-terminal lobe. Cullins couple Skp1 to the Rbx1 ring-finger protein that catalyses transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin conjugate, to a lysine on the target protein bound by the F-box protein, or to a ubiquitin molecule already attached to the target. Again, we considered the possibility that the TPR domain of Sgt1 might bind to Skp1 in competition with Cul1. Although GST–Sgt1 was able to co-precipitate Skp1 in isolation, the presence of Cul1 in the reaction decreased the co-precipitation of Skp1 in a dose-dependent manner (CITATION). In the inverse experiment, Cul1 co-precipitated Skp1, but not Sgt1 present in the same reaction (CITATION), confirming that Cul1 and Sgt1 do not interact directly, and that they bind to Skp1 with mutual exclusion. However, we were not able to decrease the amount of Skp1 co-precipitated by Cul1 with increasing amounts of Sgt1. To analyse this further, we directly determined the affinities of Sgt1 and of Cul1, for Skp1, using isothermal titration calorimetry (CITATION). Although Sgt1 bound in the low micromolar range (KD=1.64 μM), Cul1 bound Skp1 ∼70-fold more tightly, with a dissociation constant of ∼24 nM, so that Cul1 could not be competed off a Cul1–Skp1 complex by comparable levels of Sgt1. Taken together, these data are fully consistent with Sgt1 and Cul1 binding in mutual exclusion at a common or at least overlapping binding site on the N-terminal half of Skp1. Hsp90 is the hub of a nexus of physical and functional interactions with complexes involved in signalling and transcriptional regulation, the component proteins of which form the dependent clientele of the Hsp90 chaperone system (CITATION; CITATION). Sgt1 has also been implicated in the assembly and function of diverse protein complexes, including CBF3 kinetochore, SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase and adenyl cyclase complexes in yeast (CITATIONet al, 1999; CITATIONet al, 2002) and R-proteins and Nod-like receptors in plants and animals (CITATIONet al, 2002; CITATIONet al, 2004; CITATIONet al, 2005; CITATIONet al, 2007; CITATIONet al, 2007). Sgt1 therefore also has the characteristics of an interaction hub. However, it is not clear whether Sgt1 has an independent function in any of these systems, or whether it functions purely as a scaffold protein, coupling them to Hsp90. To gain some insight into this, we utilized our structural and biochemical data to engineer mutations in plant Sgt1, in vivo, which would be expected to specifically disrupt its interaction with Hsp90, but not with other known ligand proteins. Using a GFP-tagged fluorescent virus propagation assay, as described earlier (CITATIONet al, 2006; CITATIONet al, 2007), we determined the Rx-protein-mediated resistance to infection by potato virus X (PVX), of tobacco leaves (Nicotiana benthamiana) silenced for endogenous Sgt1, and heterologously complemented with wild-type or mutant AtSgt1a (see Materials and methods). Alanine mutations of Tyr199 on the three-stranded face of AtSgt1a-CS domain or of Thr220 on the four-stranded face, but not involved in direct contact with Hsp90, had no effect on the ability of the mutant protein to confer resistance to infection. Alanine mutations of Glu223 or Thr166, which are part of the Hsp90-interacting surface, also had little effect on resistance. However, alanine mutation of Tyr157, at the heart of the interface with Hsp90, or a charge reversal mutation of Lys221 close by, caused a substantial loss of resistance, comparable to an Sgt1a null (CITATION). The ability of a single missense mutation in Sgt1 that specifically disrupts its interaction with Hsp90 in vitro, to disrupt R-gene-mediated viral resistance in vivo, provides definitive evidence for the direct dependence of this class of innate immunity system on the Hsp90 chaperone system, with Sgt1 acting as a molecular scaffold coupling the two. Although yeast lacks homologues of plant R-proteins or animal Nod-like receptors, Sgt1 is essential in yeast, not least due to its involvement in the CBF3 kinetochore complex, and the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate cell cycle transitions (CITATIONet al, 1999). To determine whether essential Sgt1 functions in yeast are also dependent on its interaction with Hsp90, we engineered similar interface-disrupting point mutations, singly and in combination, into yeast Sgt1 and determined their ability to confer viability in the absence of a wild-type Sgt1 allele (see Materials and methods). Unlike the plant system, single-point mutations in either of the main hydrophobic Sgt1 interface residues (Tyr190, Phe201≡Tyr157, Phe168 in plants) had little effect (CITATION). However, double mutants abrogated viability. This is consistent with the observation of multiple missense mutations in previously identified ts SGT1 alleles (CITATIONet al, 1999). Furthermore, although viable under normal conditions, yeast harbouring Sgt1 single-point mutants were significantly more sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, than wild type (CITATION). Taken together, these data confirm the dependence of essential Sgt1 functions in yeast on its ability to form a stable complex with Hsp90. The extreme C terminus of Hsp90 consists of an MEEVD motif that provides the binding site for a range of co-chaperones containing TPR domains. Although Sgt1 possesses a TPR domain, this is not essential for Hsp90 binding (CITATIONet al, 2004; CITATION). Furthermore, a yeast TPR domain co-chaperone, Sti1 known to interact with the C terminus of Hsp90, bound simultaneously with Sgt1 (CITATION). We found that the human TPR domain co-chaperone CHIP was also able to bind to Hsp90 at the same time as Sgt1 (CITATION), showing that Sgt1 can most likely coexist in Hsp90 complexes with a range of TPR domain co-chaperones. As Sgt1 is able to couple Hsp90 to the Skp1 and F-box components of SCF E3 ligase systems, its ability to coexist in Hsp90 complexes with CHIP, an active E3 ubiquitin ligase, is particularly interesting.
!~MM~! AtSGT1a point mutations were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (BIO S&T) using AtSGT1a-pGEX-6P-1 construct. AtSGT1a WT and mutant derivates were cloned in pLexA (Clontech) as EcoRI/NotI. AtRAR1 and HvHSP90-NTD clones in pB42AD were described earlier (CITATIONet al, 2003). Interaction analyses were carried out as described in the manufacturer's protocol (MATCHMAKER; Clontech). AtSGT1a and mutant derivates were PCR amplified, cloned into pBIN61 as XbaI/BamHI and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 carrying plasmid pCH32. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing Rx:HA under the control of its own promoter were silenced for NbSGT1 as described earlier (CITATIONet al, 2006) and co-infiltrated with Agrobacterium expressing AtSGT1a or mutant derivates (OD=0.3) and PVX-GFP (OD=0.001). PVX accumulation was monitored by GFP fluorescence under UV illumination 5 days after inoculation. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YKK39 (matα ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 sgt1Δ1∷HIS31) was used as the host strain for the expression of SGT1 mutant alleles (CITATIONet al, 1999). Its viability was maintained by the SGT1 gene of the centromeric (single copy) URA3 plasmid pRS316-SGT1 (CITATIONet al, 1999). Amino-acid changes were generated in the SGT1 gene of the centromeric (single copy) LEU2 plasmid pRS315-SGT1 (CITATION), using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutations were introduced and confirmed by sequencing: Y190A, Y190R, Y90F (TAT to GCT, AGA and TTT, respectively); F201A, F201R (TTT to GCT and AGA, respectively) and the double mutants Y190R/F201R and Y190F/F201R. The S. cerevisiae strain YKK39 was transformed with pRS315-SGT1 bearing wild-type or mutant SGT1, as indicated in figure legends (CITATIONet al, 1990). Transformants were selected on drop-out media without uracil and leucine. The ability of SGT1 mutants to maintain cell viability was assessed by curing for pRS316-SGT1 by incubating the transformants on drop-out media without leucine, but containing uracil (25 mg/l) and 5-FOA (0.1%). cDNAs for H. vulgare Hsp90 and A. thaliana Sgt1a were as described (CITATIONet al, 2007). Human Hsp90β was as described (CITATIONet al, 2002). Human Skp1, Skp2, Sgt1 and Cul1 were amplified from IMAGE ESTs (4 243 711, 2 962 938, 2 985 858 and 40 118 923, respectively). Different constructs of Skp1 (residues 1–163, 1–70, 81–163 and Δ71–80) and Sgt1 were cloned into pGEX6P-1, Skp2 constructs (residues 1–411 and 89–141) were cloned into pET28a. Cul1 coding region was split into two halves (residues 1–410 and 411–776) as described earlier (CITATIONet al, 2002) and cloned into pST38 (CITATION) for co-expression. Plant and mammalian Hsp90 and Sgt1 constructs were all expressed in the Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) pLysS. Hsp90 constructs, were purified as described earlier (CITATIONet al, 1997). GST-tagged Sgt1 constructs were purified by ion exchange on Q-Sepharose and immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads. Sgt1 was then released by PreScission cleavage and further purified on a Superdex 75 PG gel-filtration column. Human Skp1, Skp2 and Cul1 constructs were all purified as described earlier (CITATIONet al, 2002). In total, 50 μg of each indicated protein (except protein in gradient titrations) was incubated in 50 μl glutathione Sepharose resin or TalonTM metal affinity resin in 200 μl of binding buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40 and 1 mg/ml BSA (pH 7.5). For gradient titration experiments, 5 μg of gradient protein was used in the first reaction, with three-fold increase in subsequent reactions (i.e. 15, 45 μg and so on). Reactions were performed overnight at 4°C. Resin was washed three times with 1 ml binding buffer later. One-fiftieth of the washed resin was resolved by SDS–PAGE, electroblotted and probed with antibody to the particular protein construct (‘α-') as indicated. Quantities of protein consumed were shown by SDS–PAGE using 10% of each input proteins and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. HvHsp90-N and AtSgt1a-CS were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio in the presence of 5 mM ADP, incubated for 30 min and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Initial multiple crystals were grown by vapour diffusion at 4°C against 26% w/v PEG4000, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 200 mM magnesium sulphate. Subsequent streak seeding into solutions of 16% w/v PEG4000, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 200 mM magnesium sulphate produced single thin plates. Crystals were harvested into reservoir solution with addition of glycerol (20% v/v) before flash cooling to 100 K. X-ray data were collected on beamline ID23 at the ESRF, Grenoble, from single crystals, and processed by using MOSFLM (CITATION) and the CCP4 package (CITATION). Crystals had space group P212121, with three copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit. The thin plate crystals have a high solvent content (59% v/v) and only gave useful diffraction to 3.3 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (CITATION) using ADP-bound yeast Hsp90-N (PDB code: 1AMW) and the solution structure of human Sgt1-CS domain (PDB code: 1RL1) as search models, built using COOT (CITATION), and refined with CNS in PHENIX (CITATIONet al, 2002), using NCS restraints. Data collection and refinement parameters are given in CITATION. Crystallographic data have been deposited in the Protein Databank with code: 2JKI
