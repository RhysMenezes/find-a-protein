!~ABS~! The balance between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability is an important determinant for various phases of plant growth; however, the detailed mechanisms regulating the C/N response are not well understood. We previously described two related ubiquitin ligases, ATL31 and ATL6, that function in the C/N response in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we used FLAG tag affinity purification and MS analysis to identify proteins targeted by ATL31, and thus likely to be involved in regulating the phase transition checkpoint based on C/N status. This analysis revealed that 14-3-3 proteins were associated with ATL31, and one of these, 14-3-3χ, was selected for detailed characterization. The interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3χ was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. In vitro assays showed that ubiquitination of 14-3-3χ is catalyzed by ATL31. Degradation of 14-3-3χin vivo was shown to be correlated with ATL31 activity, and to occur in a proteasome-dependent manner. Furthermore, 14-3-3 protein accumulation was induced by a shift to high-C/N stress conditions in Arabidopsis seedlings, and this regulated response required both ATL31 and ATL6. It was also shown that over-expression of 14-3-3χ leads to hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis seedlings to C/N stress conditions. These results indicate that ATL31 targets and ubiquitinates 14-3-3 proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system during the response to cellular C/N status.
!~RES~! To identify proteins targeted for ubiquitination by ATL31 during the C/N response, a proteomics analysis of proteins associated with ATL31 was performed. Transgenic Arabidopsis cultured cells over-expressing FLAG-tagged ATL31 containing a point mutation (C143S) in the RING domain (35S-ATL31C143S-FLAG) were generated. As the mutated ATL31C143S protein did not display ubiquitination activity (CITATION), it was predicted that target proteins would remain bound to ATL31 without ubiquitination and immediate degradation. Immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and mass spectrometry analysis revealed several specific bands. Band 1 contained the over-expressed ATL31C143S as expected. Bands 2 and 3 contained several 14-3-3 proteins with a high MS score, as calculated using the MASCOT server (Figure 1 and Table 1). The Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family contains 15 protein members that show high amino acid sequence similarity. One of these 14-3-3 proteins, 14-3-3χ, had the highest MS score in this analysis and was previously reported to be a candidate ubiquitinated protein in Arabidopsis (CITATION). We therefore selected 14-3-3χ as a representative for further detailed analysis of the potential interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3 proteins. Additional proteins were also identified within bands 2 and 3; however, they corresponded to proteins with a higher predicted molecular weight that was inconsistent with the size of bands 2 and 3. These proteins also showed a low MS score as calculated using MASCOT, and are often detected in negative control samples during similar proteomics analyses (TS, YF and JY, unpublished data), and were thus considered non-specific contaminants. [[FIGURE]]  aAGI number is the accession number of Arabidopsis genes.  bPredicted molecular mass of the identified proteins.  cMS score is the score assigned by MASCOT software after database searching. Proteins with an MS score of 30 or more are shown. To confirm the interaction between 14-3-3χ and ATL31, yeast two-hybrid analysis (Y2H) was used. The N-terminal transmembrane domain of ATL31 inhibited adequate expression and nuclear localization in yeast, and was thus removed for this analysis. Two ATL31 constructs were prepared containing either the mutated RING domain and the C-terminal region (ATL3187–368C143S) or the C-terminal domain only (ATL31169–368), and fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (Figure 2a). The full-length 14-3-3χ protein was fused to the B42 activation domain. β-galactosidase activity confirmed an interaction between ATL3187–368C143S and 14-3-3χ (Figure 2a). The C-terminal domain of ATL31 (ATL31169–368) was also shown to interact with 14-3-3χ, consistent with the expected role for this region to specify target proteins for ubiquitination by ATL family members. Similar results were also obtained for another 14-3-3 protein, 14-3-3λ, indicating that ATL31 probably interacts with multiple members of the 14-3-3 family (Figure S1A). ATL31 shares high sequence similarity and shows functional redundancy with another ATL family member, ATL6 (CITATION). The potential interaction between ATL6 and 14-3-3χ was therefore also examined by Y2H. Positive β-galactosidase activity suggested that ATL6 as well as ATL31 interacts with 14-3-3χ in yeast cells (Figure S1B). [[FIGURE]] The in vivo interaction between ATL31C143S and 14-3-3χ in plant cells was tested by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. FLAG-tagged ATL31C143S (ATL31C143S-FLAG) and Myc-tagged 14-3-3χ (Myc-14-3-3χ) were transiently over-expressed in Arabidopsis cultured cell protoplasts, and crude extracts were subject to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Western blotting analysis with an anti-Myc antibody demonstrated that Myc-14-3-3χ co-immunoprecipitated with ATL31C143S (Figure 2b). This was supported by further investigation using an anti-14-3-3 antibody, which showed multiple bands corresponding to native 14-3-3 proteins in the immunoprecipitate (Figure 2c). To evaluate the possibility that 14-3-3χ can be ubiquitinated by ATL31, 14-3-3χ was next assayed for in vitro ubiquitination in the presence of ATL31. The recombinant protein MBP–ATL31 (maltose binding protein fused to ATL31) was previously shown to have auto-ubiquitination activity in vitro (CITATION). In the current assay, MBP–ATL31 and recombinant 14-3-3χ protein fused with thioredoxin and His-tag (Trχ-His-14-3-3χ) were incubated with the required ubiquitination reaction enzymes and reagents. Western blotting analysis with anti-His antibody revealed a size shift corresponding to Trx-His-14-3-3χ that increased in intensity according to incubation time and had higher molecular weight than input protein (53 kDa; Figure 3a and Figure S2). This shift was not observed when Trx-His-14-3-3χ was incubated with MBP alone (Figure 3a) or with MBP–ATL31C143S (Figure 3b), or when the reactions did not include the E1 component (Figure 3b). These results confirmed that ATL31 has ubiquitination activity against 14-3-3χ protein in vitro. Similar activity was also observed for MBP–ATL6, which showed ubiquitination activity against 14-3-3χin vitro (Figure S3). [[FIGURE]] The stability of 14-3-3χ in plant cells was next examined using a proteasome degradation assay. Myc-tagged 14-3-3χ protein (Myc-14-3-3χ) was transiently expressed in tobacco leaves together with ATL31-FLAG or mutant ATL31C143-FLAG using agroinfiltration. Correct expression of ATL31 and 14-3-3χ, and the interaction between both proteins, was first confirmed in this system by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 4a). Protein extracts from infiltrated tobacco leaves were then incubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or with DMSO (negative control), and the stability of Myc-14-3-3χ was tested. When co-expressed with active ATL31 protein (ATL31-FLAG), Myc-14-3-3χ showed weak accumulation in the absence of MG132 treatment. Addition of MG132 inhibitor resulted in a significant increase in 14-3-3χ accumulation (Figure 4b,c), consistent with increased stability due to inhibition of proteasome activity. Relative accumulation of 14-3-3χ was also significantly greater when co-expressed with an inactive mutant version of ATL31 ligase (ATL31C143S) compared to that for active ATL31. This accumulation was similar to that observed for active ATL31 in the presence of MG132, suggesting a link between ATL31 activity and proteasome-mediated accumulation of 14-3-3χ. Addition of MG132 to extracts containing the inactive ATL31 resulted in a slight increase in 14-3-3χ, which probably represents a contribution from endogenous ATL31-like activity in the tobacco cells (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To establish whether regulation of 14-3-3χ is part of the C/N response mediated by ATL31, accumulation of 14-3-3χ protein was next evaluated in Arabidopsis seedlings growing in medium containing various amounts of glucose (0–300 mm Glc) under low nitrogen conditions (0.3 mm N). It was previously shown that Arabidopsis seedlings display C/N-dependent growth inhibition in medium containing 0–300 mm Glc/0.3 mm nitrogen, and that the single atl31 and double atl31 atl6 knockout mutant display hypersensitivity compared with wild-type plants (CITATION). Transgenic plants over-expressing FLAG-14-3-3χ mRNA in wild-type plants (FLAG-14-3-3χ in WT) were grown under various C/N ratio conditions, and accumulation of the FLAG-tagged 14-3-3χ protein was examined by Western blotting using anti-FLAG and anti-14-3-3 antibodies (Figure 5a). The anti-FLAG antibody detected only a single band corresponding to recombinant FLAG-14-3-3χ, whereas the anti-14-3-3 antibody detected the recombinant FLAG-14-3-3χ protein and multiple bands corresponding to native 14-3-3 proteins. Accumulation of FLAG-14-3-3χ protein was increased in Arabidopsis plants based on the C/N ratio of the culture medium, showing greatest accumulation at 300 mm Glc/0.3 mm N (276% greater than that under 0 mm glucose conditions) (Figure 5a,b). In contrast, the expression level of FLAG-14-3-3χ mRNA did not differ significantly change among the conditions (Figure 5c). Similar increases in protein accumulation were also observed for two major native 14-3-3 protein bands, suggesting that other 14-3-3 proteins in addition to 14-3-3χ respond to changes in C/N status. [[FIGURE]] We next examined the involvement of ATL31 activity in regulating the stability of 14-3-3χ protein in response to C/N conditions. As mentioned above, ATL6 also interacted with and ubiquitinated 14-3-3χ (Figures S1B and S3). ATL6 was also shown to have a similar function to ATL31 in regulating the plant C/N response in Arabidopsis seedlings (CITATION), and thus we examined the stability of constitutively expressed FLAG-14-3-3χ protein in an atl31 atl6 double knockout mutant background. In contrast to the results in wild-type plants, the FLAG-14-3-3χ protein hyper-accumulated under all C/N conditions in the atl31 atl6 mutant, even without addition of exogenous glucose (0 mm glucose) (Figure 5a,b). Analysis with anti-14-3-3 suggested that native 14-3-3 proteins also hyper-accumulated under all C/N conditions in mutant atl31 atl6 seedlings over-expressing the FLAG-14-3-3χ isoform (Figure 5a). Similar hyper-accumulation of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins was also observed in non-transgenic atl31 single mutant (Figure S4) and atl31 atl6 double mutant seedlings (Figure 6) compared to non-transgenic wild-type. Taken together, it was demonstrated that the stability of FLAG-14-3-3χ protein is regulated in response to the C/N status in Arabidopsis seedlings via the UPS, and that this is mediated by ubiquitin ligases ATL31 and ATL6. [[FIGURE]] The effect of over-expression of 14-3-3 protein on the C/N response in Arabidopsis seedlings was evaluated. It was previously shown that expansion of green cotyledons is inhibited in a high-C/N stress-dependent manner, and that loss of function of ATL31 and ATL6 results in hypersensitivity to high-C/N conditions (CITATION). Seeds for wild-type (WT), an over-expressor of FLAG-14-3-3χ in wild-type background (FLAG-14-3-3χ in WT), the atl31atl6 double knockout mutant (dKO) and an over-expressor of FLAG-14-3-3χ in the dKO background (FLAG-14-3-3χ in dKO) were grown on the indicated medium containing 0–300 mm Glc with 0.3 mm nitrogen, and the numbers of seedlings with expanded green cotyledons were scored (Figure 7a, b and Figure S5). In the absence of exogenous glucose, all seedlings exhibited green cotyledons. In the presence of 100 mm Glc, a slight decrease in the number of seedlings with expanded green cotyledons was observed for WT, FLAG-14-3-3χ in WT and the dKO line (80–90%), and only 40% of seedlings for FLAG-14-3-3χ in dKO showed green cotyledons under the same conditions. At a glucose concentration of 200 mm, almost no seedlings of FLAG-14-3-3χ in dKO showed expanded green cotyledons, and these seedlings exhibited strong purple pigmentation. The FLAG-14-3-3χ in WT line and dKO line also showed a low number of seedlings with green cotyledons compared to WT. Expansion of green cotyledons was completely inhibited for all plants on medium containing 300 mm Glc. Taken together, these data show that over-expression of 14-3-3χ results in hyper-sensitivity to high-C/N stress conditions, and this is enhanced by the absence of ATL31 and ATL6 activity. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Routine sub-culture and transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana MM2d and T87 suspension cultured cells were performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Wild-type Col-0, the atl31 atl6 mutant (CITATION) and other transgenic plants over-expressing FLAG-14-3-3χ in this study were grown under the conditions described previously (CITATION). The C/N response assay was performed as previously described (CITATION). Nicotiana benthamiana used for transient expression analysis was prepared as previously described (CITATION). MM2d cells were transformed with a construct containing ATL31C143S-FLAG under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (CITATION), and transgenic MM2d cells were harvested 5 days after sub-culture by centrifugation (400 g for 1 min at room temperature). Cells were frozen, ground in lysis buffer at 4°C [50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10% v/v glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, http://www.roche.com)], and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (13 000 g for 5 min at 4°C). Clarified lysate was then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) for 4 h at 4°C. After incubation, beads were washed four times for 1 min with 100 bed volumes of lysis buffer without protease inhibitor, and FLAG-associating proteins were eluted using 3xFLAG peptide (100 μg ml−1 final concentration). Eluted proteins were concentrated by acetone precipitation, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 20% v/v glycerol, 4% w/v SDS, 10% v/v β-mercaptoethanol). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS–PAGE, and specific bands were excised after detection using a Silver Stain MS kit (Wako, http://www.wako-chem.co.jp/english/index.htm). Peptides for LC-MS/MS analysis were then prepared by in-gel digestion using sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, http://www.promega.com/) (CITATION), and LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a LTQ-orbitrap XL-HTC-PAL system (Thermo Scientific, http://www.thermoscientific.com). The MS/MS spectra were compared against TAIR8 (http://www.arabidopsis.org/), and MS scores were calculated using the MASCOT server (http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html) as previously described (CITATION). Plasmids containing cDNA encoding intact or mutated ATL31 (pENTRATL31, pENTRATL3187–368 and pENTRATL31C143S) were prepared as previously described (CITATION). cDNA encoding the C-terminus of ATL31 protein (ATL31169–368) and full-length cDNA of 14-3-3χ gene (At4g09000) were amplified by PCR and introduced into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/) to generate the plasmids pENTRATL31169–368 and pENTR14-3-3χ. Primers used for PCR are listed in Appendix S1. cDNAs encoding truncated ATL31 fragments (ATL31C143S87–368 and ATL31169–368) and full-length 14-3-3χ were recombined into pEG202gw and pJG4-5gw vectors (Gateway-compatible versions of pEG202 and pJG4-5, provided by Dr Hironori Kaminaka, Faculty of Agriculture, Tottori University, Tottori City, Japan) using the Gateway system according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Transformation of the EGY48 yeast strain and determination of β-galactosidase activity was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/). Full-length 14-3-3χ was recombined into the pEG203 T-DNA binary vector (CITATION) from the pENTR14-3-3χ vector as described in the Gateway instruction manual (Invitrogen), placing the full-length 14-3-3χ gene under the control of the 35S promoter (35S-Myc-14-3-3χ). 35S-ATL31C143S-FLAG and 35S-Myc-14-3-3χ plasmids were introduced into Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells (T87) essentially as previously described (CITATION). Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and the in vitro degradation assay were performed as previously described (CITATION). The p19-pBIC vector was kindly provided by Dr Kazuyuki Mise (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Japan). The signal intensity of proteins detected by Western blotting was quantified using an LAS300 and Multi Gauge version 3.0 system (Fujifilm, http://www.fujifilm.com/). Three independent experiments were performed. Preparation of the recombinant protein and the in vitro ubiquitination assay were performed as previously described (CITATION): 500 ng of purified Trx-His-14-3-3χ and 500 ng of MBP–ATL31 were incubated in 30 μl reaction buffer [40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 25 μm MG132 (Sigma) with 50 ng mouse E1 (Wako), 250 ng UbcH5a (Wako) as E2, and 9 μg ubiquitin (Sigma)] for 0–3 h. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 20% v/v glycerin, 4% w/v SDS, 10% v/v β-mercaptoethanol), and analyzed by SDS–PAGE followed by protein immunoblotting using anti-His antibody (GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com). For Western blotting analyses, the following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-Myc (PL14; MBL, http://www.mblintl.com/), anti-GFP (JL-8; Clontech) and anti-tubulin (DM1A, Calbiochem, http://www.emdbiosciences.com/html/CBC/home.html). The anti-tubulin antibody was kindly provided by Dr Yuki Yanagawa (Plant Science Center, RIKEN, Yokohama, Japan). Antibody against purified 14-3-3ω (At1g78300) was produced in rabbit using recombinant 6 × His-tagged 14-3-3ω expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, http://www.merck-chemicals.com/). The 6 × His-tagged 14-3-3ω protein was expressed and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/). Purified His-14-3-3ω was resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained using Coomassie brilliant blue. The gel including the antigen was cut out and injected into a rabbit. Anti-14-3-3 antibody was confirmed as recognizing multiple Arabidopsis 14-3-3 proteins (Figure S6). The full-length gene encoding 14-3-3χ was recombined into the pEG202 T-DNA binary vector (p35S-FLAG-14-3-3χ) as described above. The p35S-FLAG-14-3-3χ construct was stably transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis and the atl31 atl6 mutant as previously described (CITATION). RNA isolation and reverse transcription were performed as previously described (CITATION). Primers used for PCR are listed in Appendix S1.
