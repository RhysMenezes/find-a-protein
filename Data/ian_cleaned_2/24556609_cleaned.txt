!~ABS~! Membrane trafficking in plants is involved in cellular development and the adaptation to various environmental changes. SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins mediate the fusion between vesicles and organelles to facilitate transport cargo proteins in cells. To characterize further the SNARE protein networks in cells, we carried out interactome analysis of SNARE proteins using 12 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Qa-SNAREs (SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP123, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP31, SYP32, SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43). Microsomal fractions were prepared from each transgenic root, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using micromagnetic beads coupled to anti-GFP antibodies. To identify Qa-SNARE-interacting proteins, all immunoprecipitated products were then subjected to mass spectrometric (IP-MS) analysis. The IP-MS data revealed not only known interactions of SNARE proteins, but also unknown interactions. The IP-MS results were next categorized by gene ontology analysis. The data revealed that categories of cellular component organization, the cytoskeleton and endosome were enriched in the SYP2, SYP3 and SYP4 groups. In contrast, transporter activity was classified specifically in the SYP132 group. We also identified a novel interaction between SYP22 and VAMP711, which was validated using co-localization analysis with confocal microscopy and IP. Additional novel SNARE-interacting proteins play roles in vesicle transport and lignin biosynthesis, and were identified as membrane microdomain-related proteins. We propose that Qa-SNARE interactomics is useful for understanding SNARE interactions across the whole cell.
!~RES~! To investigate the network of proteins that interact with Qa-SNAREs, we analyzed several transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express GFP-tagged Qa-SNAREs under the control of their own promoter (SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP123, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP31, SYP32, SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). Transgenic plants were grown for 10 d, and their roots were then used to prepare microsomal fractions that were subsequently used for IP analysis. We have also tried to perform IP-MS analysis using shoots and flower buds. However, there were many false-positive proteins from chloroplast proteins in the case of shoots and fewer proteins were identified in the case of flower buds. In contrast, our IP-MS methods worked well when we used microsomal fractions from roots. Isolated Qa-SNARE-interacting proteins were then identified using MS after immunoblotting with a GFP antibody had confirmed the presence of the bait proteins (Fig. 1). To improve the reliability of identification, only proteins that were detected in two or more biological replicates were defined as interacting proteins. In addition, we carried out IP-MS analysis using GFP-expressing transgenic plants as a negative control to identify false-positive data. As a result, 19, 56, 40, 38, 50, 51, 55, 31, 77, 24, 23 and 54 interacting proteins for SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP123, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP31, SYP32, SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43, respectively, were identified after the subtraction of false-positive results (Supplementary Tables S1–S12). To characterize SNARE-interacting proteins, we assigned GO slim plant terms to the proteins identified by IP-MS (Fig. 2). All SNARE-interacting proteins were grouped into six classes: SYP2 (SYP21, SYP22), SYP3 (SYP31, SYP32), SYP4 (SYP41, SYP42, SYP43), SYP111, SYP12 (SYP121, SYP122, SYP123) and SYP132 based on their localization and physiological functions (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). A 100% stacked column chart, indicating the enrichment ratio, showed that the categories of cellular component organization, cytoskeleton and endosome were specifically enriched in the SYP2, SYP3 and SYP4 families. In contrast, transporter activity was an SYP132-specific category.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We next focused on SNARE complexes consisting of Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. The Qb-, Qc- and R-SNARE proteins that interacted with each Qa-SNARE are summarized in Table 1. Each bait Qa-SNARE protein was successfully identified in IP-MS analysis, and previously reported SNARE complexes were also detected. For example, VTI11 (VPS TEN INTERACTING 11) and SYP5, a Qb-SNARE and Qc-SNARE, respectively, were identified as SYP22/VAM3/SGR3-interacting proteins. This interaction is important for vacuolar trafficking and morphogenesis by mediating membrane fusion between PVCs and vacuoles (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). Mutations in either syp22 or vti11 lead to abnormal shoot gravitropism due to the irregular distribution of amyloplasts in endodermal cells (CITATION). These results clearly indicate that IP-MS can be used to identify Qa-SNARE complexes and interacting proteins in their natural state in living cells.  VAMP727 is an R-SNARE that interacts with the SNARE complex consisting of SYP22, VTI11 and SYP5 (CITATION). In this study, VAMP711 and VAMP713, another R-SNARE localized on tonoplasts, were interacted with SYP22 (Table 1). The interaction between VAMP713 and SYP22 has already been reported in our previous study (CITATION). Here, to confirm the interaction between SYP22 and VAMP711, we examined their subcellular localization using protoplasts described in our previous report (CITATION). The monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)–SYP22 under the control of the 35S promoter was transiently expressed in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis roots and shoots expressing GFP–VAMP711 under the control of the 35S promoter. The RFP signals were detected on tonoplasts and the PVC (Fig. 3). GFP signals were observed on the tonoplasts and the PVC in addition to the PM (Fig. 3). We concluded that SYP22 and VAMP711 are therefore co-localized on the tonoplasts as a novel SNARE complex. To obtain further evidence using another method, we performed IP assay using Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP–VAMP711 (Fig. 4). The results showed that endogenous SYP22 and VTI11 were detected as VAMP711-interacting proteins. These data suggest that VAMP711 is associated with the SNARE complex consisting of SYP22, VTI11 and SYP5. Interestingly, VAMP721 was immunoprecipitated with SYP22, even though these two proteins were reported to have different subcellular localizations (CITATION, CITATION). VAMP721 is localized to the PM, TGN and cell plate, but not the tonoplasts. However, it is possible that low levels of SYP22 and VAMP721 could be co-localized and interact, or that SYP22 could generate a SNARE complex with VAMP721 under specific conditions.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] SYP111, which is expressed only at the cell plate in dividing cells, forms two different SNARE complexes: SYP111–SNAP33–VAMP721 and SYP111–NPSN11–SYP71–VAMP721 (CITATION). However, few candidate interacting proteins and no SNAREs were identified in our analysis. It is possible that the expression levels of GFP–SYP111/KNOLLE were limited in specific conditions. We also identified the interaction between SYP121 and VAMP721, but not SNAP33 (Table 1), although the SYP121/PEN1–SNAP33–VAMP721/722 ternary SNARE complex is necessary for the defense response against powdery mildew (CITATION). Moreover, SYP121, SYP122 and SYP132 co-immunoprecipitated with SYP71, NPSN11/13 and VAMP721 (Table 1). These results suggest that SYP121, SYP122 and SYP132 form a SNARE complex with NPSN and SYP71, similar to SYP111/KNOLLE. SYP122 and VAMP721 were previously described to interact with SYP121/PEN1 and the Qb- and Qc- SNARE SNAP33 (CITATION). The interaction between SYP4 and VAMP721 was identified (Table 1). Since SYP41 is known to interact with VTI12 (CITATION), SYP61 and YKT61, SYP4 may therefore generate a novel complex with VAMP721. We were unable to identify novel SNARE proteins that interact with SYP31 or SYP32 in our analysis, which may be explained by low expression levels of both proteins. Annexins are a multigene family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins that are expressed in both animal and plant species. In animal cells, annexins regulate ion channel activity, and also form Ca2+ channels (CITATION). In addition, they play a role in vesicle fusion, interact with Q-SNAREs and regulate delivery and exocytosis at the cell surface of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (a glutamate receptor) (CITATION). However, little is known about the function of plant annexins (CITATION, CITATION). Seven annexin homologs have so far been identified in A. thaliana, including ANNAT4 (annexin from A. thaliana 4). In this study, novel interactions between ANNAT4 and SYP121, SYP122, SYP123, SYP21 and SYP22 were identified (Table 1). ANNAT4 interacts with ANNAT1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner to regulate cellular responses to drought and salt stress (CITATION). Plant annexins may therefore cooperate with SNAREs to regulate vesicle fusion, and play a role in the tolerance to abiotic stresses. Caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase 1 (CCoAOMT1), an enzyme in the lignin biosynthesis pathway (CITATION), was identified as a previously unknown interacting protein for SYP111, SYP132, SYP21, SYP31, SYP32 and SYP42. Lignin, which is an integral component of the secondary cell wall, plays an important role in plant growth and development, water transport and the defense response (CITATION). CCoAOMT is localized in lignifying tissues, such as tracheary elements and xylem and phloem fibers (CITATION). CCoAOMT1, which is trafficked to its proper localization by SYPs, may therefore regulate lignin biosynthesis for growth of vascular tissues and responding to environmental changes, wounding and pathogens. This study also revealed that the Band7 family of proteins, which play a role in the formation of membrane microdomains and vesicles, interact with SYP121, SYP122, SYP132 and SYP22. In eukaryotes, the Band7 family proteins are involved in a variety of important cellular functions (CITATION). For example, flotillins are involved in signal transduction and vesicle trafficking (CITATION), prohibitins help regulate the activity of FtsH proteases (CITATION), and stomatins play a role in ion channel activity (CITATION). Although no interactions between Band7 and SYP122, SYP132 or SYP22 have been reported, Band7 and SYP121 were identified in the membrane microdomain of A. thaliana and rice (CITATION, CITATION). In addition SYP71, which was co-immunoprecipitated with SYP121, SYP122, SYP132 and SYP22, localizes to the membrane microdomain (CITATION), which contacts pathogens at their entry site. Our IP-MS data may indicate that Band7 and SYPs interacted at the PM. In this study, further novel Qa-SNARE-interacting proteins were identified; for example, disease resistance proteins belonging to the TIR-NBS class and several protein kinases (Supplementary Tables S1–S12). Previously, studies of the functions and interacting proteins of SNAREs were clarified by the accumulation of separate studies based on genetics and bio-imaging. Although these efforts have revealed several functions for SNARE proteins, there were no comprehensive interactome data, including of SNAREs localized to different organelles. We therefore believe that this Qa-SNARE interactome will allow a greater understanding of the interacting partners of SNAREs, how SNAREs interact with each other, and the function of these interactions. The identified proteins are available on the IMEx database site (http://www.imexconsortium.org/).
!~MM~! Seeds of transgenic lines of A. thaliana expressing SNARE–GFP or GFP alone (pGWB6; CITATION) were sterilized with a mixture of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite. Following this step, the seeds were kept for 3 d in darkness. Approximately 1,000 seedlings were grown vertically on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium for 10 d at 22°C under 16 h light/8 h dark conditions in each experiment. Freshly harvested roots (300 mg) were homogenized with an extraction buffer [50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 5 mM EDTA, 0.4 M sucrose, cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free (Roche)]. The extract was incubated on ice for 15 min. The incubated extract was centrifuged at 8,000×g for 20 min and then the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000×g for 60 min. The resultant pellet was lysed with a suspension buffer [1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 2.68 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4)] and incubated on ice for 30 min. IP analysis was performed according to specifications in the protocol supplied with the µMACS Epitope-Tagged Protein Isolation Kit (Militenyi Biotec). The lysates of the microsomal fraction were incubated with anti-GFP conjugated with micromagnetic beads for 30 min at 4°C and then applied to µMACS columns following column conditioning. The column was washed four times with 200 µl of suspension buffer and then with 100 µl of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) solution. Afterwards, the proteins were eluted with SDS–PAGE sample buffer. The microsomal fraction was prepared from 1,000 seedlings in one experiment and then IP-MS analysis was performed. We also performed each experiment on a different day. The IP products were utilized for immunoblotting assay and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The IP products were separated on a 12.5% (w/v) SDS–polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) for immunoblot detection. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and incubated for 2 h with anti-GFP (Nacalai Tesque). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, the membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Chemical enhancement was performed using ECL PLUS Western blot detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The enhanced signals were detected using an LAS-3000 mini system (Fujifilm). The IP products were separated using a ready-made 12.5% (w/v) SDS–polyacrylamide gel (DRC) and stained using Flamingo (BioRad). The separated proteins were sliced into five bands of equal length. Each gel band was washed twice with HPLC-grade water containing 60% (v/v) acetonitrile (Kanto Chemical)/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Next, the gel was incubated in 10 mM DTT/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at 56°C, followed by 55 mM iodoacetamide/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at room temperature. The incubated gel was washed twice with HPLC-grade water containing 60% (v/v) acetonitrile/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and dried in a vacuum concentrator. The dried gel pieces were treated with 2 µl of 10 ng µl–1 trypsin (MS grade gold; Promega)/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. The digested peptides were recovered to a new tube. The gel was treated twice with 20 µl of 0.2% (v/v) formic acid (Wako)/50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and then all extracted peptides were collected into a tube. The extracts were dried in a vacuum concentrator and dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid/5% (v/v) acetonitrile. The dissolved solution was filtered by the Ultrafree-MC Centrifugal Filters (PVDF 0.45 µm; Millipore) to avoid contamination of gel pieces. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by using a HTC-PAL/Paradigm MS4 system coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer. Trypsin-digested peptides were loaded on the L-column (100 µm internal diameter, 15 cm; CERI) using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC pump (Michrome BioResources) and an HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC analytics). Buffers were 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and 90% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (solvent B). A linear gradient from 5% to 45% B for 26 min was applied, and peptides eluted from the L-column were introduced directly into a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with a flow rate of 500 nl min–1 and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. All events for the MS scan were controlled and acquired by Xcalibur software version 2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The range of the MS scan was m/z 400–1,500, and the top three peaks were subjected to MS/MS analysis. The spectra obtained were compared with a protein database (TAIR8) using the MASCOT server (version 2.2). The mascot search parameters were as follows: set off the threshold at 0.05 in the ion-score cut-off, peptide tolerance at 10 .p.m., MS/MS tolerance at ±0.8 Da, peptide charge of 2+ or 3+, trypsin as the enzyme allowing up to one missed cleavage, carbamidomethylation on cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidation on methionine as a variable modification. The protein interactions from this publication have been submitted to the IMEx consortium (http://www.imexconsortium.org/) through IntAct [PMID:22121220] and assigned the identifier IM-22071. GO categories in all SNARE interactors were classified by using Cytoscape version 2.83 (http://www.cytoscape.org; CITATION) with the BINGO ver. 2.44 software plug-in (http://www.psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO; CITATION). A P-value cut-off of 0.05 was used to identify significantly enriched categories. According to the ratio of categorized proteins, 100% stacked column charts were generated. Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia (Col-0) seeds were sterilized and germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium. Approximately 1,500 seedlings were grown vertically for 5 d at 22°C under 16 h light/8 h dark conditions. Protoplasts were prepared from roots and shoots as described previously, with minor changes (CITATION). Roots were harvested and incubated with protoplasting solution using 15 ml per 1,500 seedlings for 2 h under gentle agitation at room temperature. For preparation of protoplasting solution, 0.625% cellulase R-10, 0.625% cellulase RS and 0.3% Macerozyme R-10 (all Yakult) with mannitol solution (0.6 M mannitol, 20 mM MES and 20 mM KCl, adjusted to pH 5.7 with 1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5) were incubated at 55°C for 8 min, and then 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol were added after cooling to room temperature. Roots and shoots treated with the cellulase solution were filtered through a 40 µm Cell Strainer (BD Falcon). Filtrates were centrifuged at 200×g at 4°C for 10 min to collect protoplasts. After discarding the supernatant, the pellets were washed once in the mannitol solution to remove cellulase completely. Protoplast pellets were then dissolved in the mannitol solution for gene transfection. Protoplast derived from roots and shoots were adjusted to a concentration of 2.5×106 cells ml–1 by counting using a hemocytometer under a light microscope, and an aliquot of protoplasts (100 µl) and plasmid (5 µg each) were used in each transfection experiment (CITATION). The protoplasts were incubated for 10–16 h after transfection, and then fluorescence images were observed with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. Shoot tissues (200 mg) harvested from A. thaliana transgenic lines expressing GFP–VAMP711 and GFP alone, which were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium for 13 d, were subjected to IP assay. IP was carried out using the µMACS Epitope-Tagged Protein Isolation Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The final eluted samples were subjected to immunoblotting assay (as described above) and detected by the appropriate antibodies: anti-GFP (Nacalai Tesque), anti-VAM3/SYP22 (CITATION) or anti-VTI11 (CITATION).
