!~ABS~! CP12 is a protein of 8.7 kDa that contributes to Calvin cycle regulation by acting as a scaffold element in the formation of a supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in photosynthetic organisms. NMR studies of recombinant CP12 (isoform 2) of Arabidopsis thaliana show that CP12-2 is poorly structured. CP12-2 is monomeric in solution and contains four cysteines, which can form two intramolecular disulfides with midpoint redox potentials of –326 and –352 mV, respectively, at pH 7.9. Site-specific mutants indicate that the C-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between CP12-2 and GAPDH (isoform A4), whereas the N-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between this binary complex and PRK. In the presence of NAD, oxidized CP12-2 interacts with A4-GAPDH (KD = 0.18 μm) to form a binary complex of 170 kDa with (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 stoichiometry, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and multiangle light scattering analysis. PRK is a dimer and by interacting with this binary complex (KD = 0.17 μm) leads to a 498-kDa ternary complex constituted by two binary complexes and two PRK dimers, i.e. ((A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2-(PRK))2. Thermodynamic parameters indicate that assembly of both binary and ternary complexes is exoergonic although penalized by a decrease in entropy that suggests an induced folding of CP12-2 upon binding to partner proteins. The redox dependence of events leading to supramolecular complexes is consistent with a role of CP12 in coordinating the reversible inactivation of chloroplast enzymes A4-GAPDH and PRK during darkness in photosynthetic tissues. 
!~RES~! CP12-2 of A. thaliana Is Intrinsically Unstructured and Monomeric—NMR analysis of CP12-2 in the oxidized state revealed that most of the amide proton resonances are localized between 8.5 and 8.0 ppm, the so-called random coil region, strongly suggesting that CP12-2 is mainly unstructured (Fig. 1). Only a few residues located at the C terminus exhibit amide chemical shifts outside the random coil range, indicating structuration (33). Consistent with the importance of disulfide bridges in this respect, the reduction of oxidized CP12-2 by DTT led to typical random coil signals (not shown), as previously described for Chlamydomonas CP12 (20).  The calculated molecular mass of recombinant CP12-2 (after proteolytic cleavage of the His tag) was 8.7 kDa. Although oxidized CP12-2 behaves as a protein of 29 kDa in size exclusion chromatography (7), MALS-QELS analysis of the protein eluted from the size exclusion column yielded a molecular mass of 9 ± 1 kDa, conclusively demonstrating that under native conditions, CP12-2 is a monomer (Table 1).    [[TABLE]]   [[FIGURE]] CP12-2 Redox Properties—To gain insight into the redox properties of CP12-2 cysteines, redox titrations were performed in the presence of DTNB as a probe to reveal free protein thiols under varying redox conditions. Fully reduced/oxidized samples were obtained following equilibration with 20 mm reduced or oxidized DTT, which was then removed by desalting. Although reduced CP12-2, whose amino acid sequence includes four Cys residues, was found by DTNB titration to contain four reactive thiols (4.5 ± 0.5), oxidized CP12-2 had none (–0.3 ± 0.1), indicating that both CP12-2 disulfides could be redox-titrated by DTT plus DTNB. Data from redox titrations of purified CP12-2 were therefore fitted to a Nernst equation for two different thiol/disulfide equilibria, equally contributing to the total redox response. At pH 7.9, the midpoint redox potentials (Em,7.9) of CP12-2 disulfides were estimated as –326 ± 2 and –352 ± 6 mV, respectively (Fig. 2).  Interaction between A4-GAPDH, CP12-2, and PRK—Size exclusion chromatography carried out in the presence of NAD, combined with MALS-QELS analysis, demonstrated that a stable binary complex of 170 ± 14 kDa was reconstituted by incubating oxidized CP12-2 (9 ± 1 kDa; MALS) with A4-GAPDH complexed with NAD (146 ± 2 kDa; MALS; Table 1). Since MALS data are independent of protein conformational effects, they do suggest that two CP12-2 molecules can bind to one A4-GAPDH tetramer, giving rise to an (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 binary complex (calculated molecular mass = 166 kDa; Table 1).  The affinity between A4-GAPDH and CP12-2 was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 3). Such interaction was characterized by a KD of 0.18 ± 0.02 μm. In agreement with MALS analysis, two binding sites for CP12-2 were detected per A4-GAPDH tetramer (n = 1.9 ± 0.2), with no evidence for different affinities between binding sites. Binding of two CP12-2 molecules to each A4-GAPDH tetramer was exothermic (ΔH =–15 kcal mol–1), and although leading to a simultaneous decrease in entropy (TΔS =–5 kcal mol–1), the process was exoergonic overall (ΔG =–9.4 kcal mol–1; Table 2).    [[TABLE]]   [[FIGURE]] The interaction between oxidized PRK and preconstituted (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 binary complexes was also investigated by multiangle light scattering. Binding of PRK (85 ± 7 kDa; MALS) to the binary complex gave rise to a ternary complex of 498 ± 6 kDa (MALS), likely to include two dimers of PRK plus two (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 binary complexes (calculated molecular mass = 488 kDa; Table 1). The stoichiometric ratio of two A4-GAPDH subunits per PRK subunit in the 498-kDa ternary complex was well compatible with the relative intensities of Coomassie-stained bands in denaturing gel electrophoresis (not shown).  Thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between PRK and (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 were also determined by ITC (Fig. 4). As in experiments of binary complex formation, data were fitted to a simple model describing the interaction on n “ligands” (PRK) to one “macromolecule” (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 with n identical binding sites. Using this model, a KD value of 0.17 ± 0.09 μm and n = 1.3 ± 0.1 were obtained. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that ternary complex assembly was largely exothermic (ΔH =–20 kcal mol–1) and exoergonic (ΔG =–9.3 kcal mol–1), despite a significant decrease in entropy (TΔS =–11 kcal mol–1; Table 2).    [[FIGURE]] The entropic penalty associated with both binary and ternary complex formation (Table 2) suggests that CP12-2 adopted a folded structure upon binding to its structured partners, a typical behavior of intrinsically unstructured proteins (34). Indeed, the assembly of complexes involving disordered proteins is often associated with an appreciable entropic cost that is paid in terms of lower binding affinity (35). This situation seems also to apply to CP12-2 and its partners (A4-GAPDH and PRK in Arabidopsis).  CP12-2 Site-specific Mutants—CP12-2 was previously shown to bind A4-GAPDH under oxidizing conditions (3, 7, 20). The roles of the two active CP12-2 disulfides were therefore investigated by use of two site-specific mutants, having either the first (Cys22) or the last (Cys73) cysteine of the sequence mutated into serine. Under reducing conditions, both mutants (C22S and C73S) behaved as wild type CP12-2 in size exclusion chromatography, but they tended to form dimers under oxidizing conditions (not shown), possibly due to intermolecular disulfides between residual free cysteines (Cys31 in C22S, Cys64 in C73S). However, most of CP12-2 mutants remained in the monomeric state even when oxidized.  Although mutant C22S interacted with A4-GAPDH similarly to wild type CP12-2 (Fig. 5, A and B), mutant C73S did not form any complex with A4-GAPDH (Fig. 5C), suggesting an essential role of the C-terminal disulfide in CP12/GAPDH interaction. In the presence of PRK, neither mutant was able to promote the formation of a ternary complex reminiscent of the 498-kDa complex of wild type CP12-2 (7) (not shown). Clearly, the N-terminal disulfide plays a role in stabilizing the link between PRK and the binary complex within the final ternary complex. 
!~MM~! Protein Expression and Purification—Heterologous expression and purification of recombinant A4-GAPDH (At3g26650), PRK (At1g32060), CP12-2 (At3g62410), and CP12-2 site-specific mutants of A. thaliana were performed as described (7). NMR analyses were performed on uniformly 15N-labeled His-tagged CP12-2 samples obtained by transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Euriso-top, France) as the sole nitrogen source. An overnight culture of 25 ml in M9 medium was transferred to 500 ml of fresh M9 medium, both supplied with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C under shaking. When optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0 units, expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Since M9 minimal medium prevented rapid cell growth, the induction phase was prolonged for 15 h before cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm; 15 min). CP12-2 was purified from the resulting pellet as previously described (7). Purified proteins were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm (7), desalted in appropriate buffers, and stored at –20 °C. Concentrations of purified proteins are all referred to native conformations (CP12-2 monomers, A4-GAPDH tetramers, and PRK dimers).  CP12-2 Site-specific Mutants—Site-specific mutants of recombinant CP12-2 were obtained as previously described (26). PCR primers were the following (mutation sites are underlined): C22S(up), 5′-AAGCTCAGGAGACTTCTGCGGGCGATCC-3′; C22S(down), 5′-ATCGCCCGCAGAAGTCTCCTGAGCTTCC-3′; C73S(up), 5′-ACAATCCTGAGACCAACGAGTCCCGTACTTACG-3′; C73S(down), 5′-TTGTCGTAAGTACGGGACTCGTTGGTCTCAGG-3′. The presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.  NMR Spectra—Uniformly 15N-labeled CP12-2, provided with His tag, was oxidized by the addition of 20 mm oxidized DTT (Sigma). After 16–18 h of incubation at 4 °C, the sample was desalted in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and concentrated. NMR samples were typically 300 or 600 μl of 1 mm CP12-2 solution in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5% (v/v) 2H2O, 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide.  Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (30) spectra were recorded with 256 and 2048 complex points in F1 and F2 dimensions, respectively, at 20 °C on a Bruker AvanceII 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) probe, including field xyz gradients.  Spectra were processed using Topspin™ version 1.3 (Bruker). Chemical shifts were referenced to internal d4-3-(trimethylsily) propionic acid, according to Ref. 31.  Analysis of Thiol Groups and Redox Titration of CP12-2—Protein thiol analyses and redox titrations were performed with pure CP12-2 in 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. Redox titration experiments were performed with 70 μm CP12-2 incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with variable ratios of reduced and oxidized DTT (20 mm total concentration) in a final volume of 500 μl. After incubation, samples were desalted with PD10 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. In order to avoid any possible DTT contamination, only the first 2 ml of eluted samples were collected. Control experiments were performed under the same conditions but in the absence of CP12-2. Absorbance at 280 and 412 nm was recorded immediately before and after the addition of 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The number of solvent-accessible thiol groups under different redox conditions was calculated from the ratio between the absorbance at 412 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 14,150 m–1 for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (thiolate) dianion) (32) and the absorbance at 280 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 8,370 m–1 for CP12-2) (7).  Redox titration results were fit by nonlinear regression (CoHort Software) to the Nernst equation for two redox components (26). Midpoint redox potentials are reported as average values ± S.D. of triplicate experiments.  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Calorimetric measurements were carried out using a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Each experiment was performed at a constant temperature of 30 °C and consisted of 25 injections of 10-μl aliquots, repeated every 200 s. All samples were degassed by stirring under vacuum before use. Heat of dilution, measured by control experiments in which samples were injected into a buffer-filled cell, was subtracted. Signals recorded in each experiment were integrated using OriginPro 7.5 software supplied with the instrument. The thermodynamic binding parameters (dissociation constant (KD), variations of enthalpy (ΔH), Gibbs free energy (ΔG), entropy (ΔS), and the number of binding sites (n)) were obtained by nonlinear regression of the integrated heat plots, according to the “one set of sites” model of the software.    [[FIGURE]] Calorimetric titrations of binary complex formation were carried out with 15 μm oxidized CP12-2 in 25 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm NAD, pH 7.5, in both sample and reference cells, whereas the syringe was filled with 52 μm A4-GAPDH in the same buffer. Although CP12-2 behaved as a ligand, it was not filled in the syringe because of its very high heat of dilution. The presence of ligand (CP12-2) in the cell and macromolecule (A4-GAPDH) in the syringe was taken into account in the elaboration of primary data.  Calorimetric titrations of ternary complex formation were performed with 5 μm preformed binary complex in 25 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm NAD, pH 7.5, in sample and reference cells, whereas the syringe was filled with 70 μm PRK dissolved in the same buffer. Thermodynamic parameters of binary and ternary complex formation are reported as average values ± S.D. of triplicate experiments.  Dynamic Light Scattering (MALS-QELS)—Purified single proteins and preformed binary and ternary complexes were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography connected to a multiangle light scattering (MALS) equipped with QELS module (quasielastic light scattering) for RH measurements. 100-μl samples were loaded on a Superdex 200HR column (GE Health-care) equilibrated in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, with 0.2 mm NAD (for A4-GAPDH, binary, and ternary complexes) or without NAD (for PRK and CP12-2). A constant flow rate of 0.6 ml min–1 was applied. Elution profiles were detected by an Optilab rEX interferometric refractometer and a Dawn EOS multiangle laser light-scattering system at 690 nm (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Data acquisition and processing were carried out using ASTRA 5.1.9.1 software (Wyatt Technology). Determination of molecular masses and hydrodynamic radii are reported as mean values ± S.D. of duplicate experiments.
