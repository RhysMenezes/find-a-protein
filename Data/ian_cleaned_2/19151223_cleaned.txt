!~ABS~! JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as repressors of jasmonate (JA) signaling. Perception of bioactive JAs by the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) causes degradation of JAZs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which in turn activates the expression of genes involved in plant growth, development, and defense. JAZ proteins contain two highly conserved sequence regions: the Jas domain that interacts with COI1 to destabilize the repressor and the ZIM domain of unknown function. Here, we show that the conserved TIFY motif (TIFF/YXG) within the ZIM domain mediates homo- and heteromeric interactions between most Arabidopsis thaliana JAZs. We have also identified an alternatively spliced form (JAZ10.4) of JAZ10 that lacks the Jas domain and, as a consequence, is highly resistant to JA-induced degradation. Strong JA-insensitive phenotypes conferred by overexpression of JAZ10.4 were suppressed by mutations in the TIFY motif that block JAZ10.4–JAZ interactions. We conclude that JAZ10.4 functions to attenuate signal output in the presence of JA and further suggest that the dominant-negative action of this splice variant involves protein–protein interaction through the ZIM/TIFY domain. The ability of JAZ10.4 to interact with MYC2 is consistent with a model in which a JAZ10.4-containing protein complex directly represses the activity of transcription factors that promote expression of JA response genes.
!~RES~! We used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to determine the homomeric interaction potential of the 12 members of the Arabidopsis JAZ family. Each full-length JAZ was fused separately to the LexA DNA binding domain (BD) and the B42 activation domain (AD). Homodimeric interactions were assessed by coexpression of the BD and AD fusion proteins in yeast cells containing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of a LexA-dependent operator. As shown in Figure 1A , JAZ1, JAZ2, JAZ3, and JAZ10.1 strongly interacted as homodimers, as determined by strong LacZ reporter activity. Weaker homomeric interactions were observed for JAZ4, JAZ5, and JAZ6, whereas the remaining five family members (JAZ7, JAZ8, JAZ9, JAZ11, and JAZ12) failed to interact. Protein gel blot analysis showed that all JAZ fusion proteins were expressed in yeast cells (Figure 1B), indicating that the absence of interaction cannot be attributed to a lack of protein expression. [[FIGURE]] We next used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to determine whether JAZ-JAZ homomeric complexes form in planta. JAZ3 was chosen for this analysis because it self-associates strongly in yeast (Figure 1A) and, when expressed as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, is localized to the nucleus (CITATION). N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (nYFP and cYFP, respectively) were fused to either the N or C termini of JAZ3 to produce four constructs (JAZ3-nYFP, JAZ3-cYFP, nYFP-JAZ3, and cYFP-JAZ3). Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation was used to coexpress each of the four possible combinations of nYFP and cYFP JAZ fusion constructs in epidermal cells of Nicotiana tabacum. Coexpression of JAZ3-nYFP and cYFP-JAZ3, but not any other combination tested, resulted in a YFP signal within the nucleus (Figure 1C). This finding confirms the Y2H results and further demonstrates that JAZ3 can self-associate in the plant nucleus. We also employed Y2H assays to systematically test all possible JAZ-JAZ heteromeric interactions in both BD/AD orientations. Out of a total of 132 possible heteromeric combinations, we observed 47 interactions of varying strengths involving all family members except JAZ7 (Table 1 ). Nine of these interactions (JAZ1-JAZ2, JAZ1-JAZ10.1, JAZ2-JAZ5, JAZ2-JAZ6, JAZ3-JAZ4, JAZ5-JAZ6, JAZ6-JAZ10.1, JAZ6-JAZ12, and JAZ9-JAZ10.1) were detected in both BD/AD orientations. Several JAZ proteins that interacted strongly as homodimers tended to interact with a larger number of JAZs. For example, JAZ1 and JAZ3 interacted with nine and seven other family members, respectively, in one or both BD/AD orientations. We also found examples of proteins (e.g., JAZ8) that did not form homomeric complexes but did interact with several other family members. We conclude that most JAZ proteins in Arabidopsis form homodimers and heterodimers in yeast. Summary of JAZ–JAZ Interactions in Yeast As an initial approach to identify sequence determinants that mediate JAZ-JAZ binding, we examined the ability of various deletion mutants of JAZ3 (Figure 2A ) to interact with full-length JAZ3 and JAZ10.1. Deletion of 140 amino acids from the N terminus of JAZ3 (ΔN), including the weakly conserved N-terminal region observed by CITATION, resulted in a slight reduction in the strength of homomeric and heteromeric interactions with JAZ3 and JAZ10.1, respectively (Figure 2B). A JAZ3 variant (Jas) that lacks both the N-terminal and ZIM domains was previously shown to interact with COI1 in a hormone-dependent manner (CITATION). This C-terminal fragment of JAZ3 failed to interact with either full-length JAZ3 or JAZ10.1 (Figure 2B). A third deletion construct (ΔJas) that lacks the Jas domain interacted strongly with full-length JAZ3 and JAZ10.1. Protein gel blot analysis confirmed that the JAZ3 deletion variants used in these experiments were expressed in yeast cells (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal region and the Jas domain are not required for JAZ3-JAZ interactions, thus implicating the ZIM domain as an important determinant for JAZ-JAZ binding. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the role of the ZIM domain in JAZ–JAZ interaction, we performed Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the highly conserved TIFY motif found in the ZIM domain of JAZ3 and all other family members (Figure 2D). We assessed the interaction of the resulting mutant JAZ3 variants with both wild-type JAZ3 and JAZ10.1 in the Y2H system. Ala substitution of Gly-185 abolished the interaction with wild-type JAZ3, whereas replacement of Thr-180, Ile-181, Phe-182, and Tyr-183 did not affect this interaction (Figure 2E). Heteromeric interaction of JAZ3 with JAZ10.1 was also disrupted by the G185A mutation as well as by an I181A mutation in JAZ3 (Figure 2E). Site-directed mutagenesis of the TIFY motif in JAZ10.1 yielded similar results. In this case, Ala substitution of either Ile-107 or Gly-111 abrogated JAZ10.1 binding to itself and to JAZ6 (Figure 2F). Protein gel blot analysis showed that all Ala-substituted mutants of JAZ3 and JAZ10.1 were expressed in yeast (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). These findings establish an essential role for the TIFY motif in JAZ–JAZ interactions. The ZIM domain was originally identified in ZIM, ZML1, and ZML2 members of the tify family (CITATION; CITATION). All three of these proteins possess a GATA-type Zn-finger DNA binding motif and are thought to act as transcription factors. If the ZIM domain functions as a protein–protein interaction determinant, we reasoned that ZIM, ZML1, and ZML2 may interact with one another. Indeed, we found that each protein homo- and heterodimerized in yeast (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). During efforts to isolate a full-length cDNA for JAZ10, we identified three distinct transcripts from this gene. These included the At5g13220.1 and At5g13220.3 transcripts that are predicted by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) to encode the longest isoform (i.e., JAZ10.1) and the JAZ10.3/JAS1.3 isoform containing a partially truncated Jas domain (CITATION). The third transcript we identified (designated At5g13220.4), which was not annotated in the TAIR database, is predicted to encode a 167–amino acid protein, designated JAZ10.4. The sequence of At5g13220.4 indicates that it is produced by the use of an alternative splice donor site in the third exon of the JAZ10 gene (Figure 3A ). This splicing event causes a frame-shift mutation that deletes the entire Jas domain and adds 20 amino acids C-terminal to Ser-147 (Figure 3B). RT-PCR was used to verify the occurrence of At5g13220.4 in wounded Arabidopsis leaves. As shown in Figure 3C, three RT-PCR products ranging in size between ∼500 and 650 bp were distinguishable by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products confirmed their identity as At5g13220.1, At5g13220.3, and At5g13220.4. RT-PCR experiments performed with transcript-specific primers also detected the At5g13220.3 and At5g13220.4 splice variants in wounded leaves (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). [[FIGURE]] The role of the Jas domain as a JAZ destabilization element (CITATION; CITATION) led us to test the hypothesis that JAZ10.1, JAZ10.3, and JAZ10.4 differentially interact with COI1. We assessed the three isoforms for their ability to interact with COI1 in a ligand-dependent manner in the Y2H system. Coronatine, a potent signal for COI1–JAZ interactions (CITATION; CITATION), stimulated JAZ10.1 binding to COI1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A ). JAZ10.3 interacted with COI1 in the presence of relatively high concentrations of coronatine (e.g., 200 μM), whereas JAZ10.4 did not interact with COI1 at any concentration of coronatine tested. Quantification of β-galactosidase activity confirmed that JAZ10.3 weakly interacts with COI1 in comparison to JAZ10.1 and that JAZ10.4 fails to bind COI1 in the presence of 200 μM coronatine (Figure 4B). Protein gel blot analysis showed that all three JAZ10 proteins were produced in yeast cells (Figure 4C). We also performed Y2H assays to determine whether the JAZ10 splice variants interact with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, MYC2. As shown in Figure 4D, all three JAZ10 isoforms interacted with MYC2 in the absence of coronatine. These findings indicate that the Jas domain is critical for interaction of JAZ10 splice variants (e.g., JAZ10.1) with COI1 but is not required for binding of JAZ10 isoforms to MYC2. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate potential functional differences between the JAZ10 isoforms, we tested whether JAZ10.3 and JAZ10.4, like JAZ10.1 (Figure 1, Table 1), form homo- and heterodimers in yeast. As shown in Figure 4E, the JAZ interaction pattern of JAZ10.3 was identical to that of JAZ10.1, with both variants partnering with eight of the 14 JAZ proteins tested. In this BD/AD orientation, JAZ10.4 interacted with the same set of eight JAZs and also formed heterodimers with JAZ2 and JAZ3 (Figure 4E). Protein gel blot analysis of protein extracts from yeast strains cotransformed with JAZ3 and JAZ10 isoforms showed that each JAZ protein was expressed (Figure 4F). We conclude that the three JAZ10 splice variants interact with a similar set of JAZs in the Y2H system. Previous studies have shown that several JAZ family members, including JAZ10.1 and JAZ10.3, are located in the nucleus (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether the modified C terminus of JAZ10.4 affects the targeting of the protein to the nucleus, we used confocal laser microscopy to examine the subcellular location of a JAZ10.4-YFP fusion protein transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells. Control experiments showed that whereas YFP alone partitions to both the cytosol and the nucleus, JAZ10.1-YFP and JAZ10.3-YFP are located predominantly in the nucleus, as previously reported (CITATION) (Figure 5 ). JAZ10.4-YFP exhibited a nuclear localization pattern that was similar to that of the other two isoforms. We conclude that the COI1-noninteracting splice variant JAZ10.4 localizes to the nucleus. [[FIGURE]] The absence of a Jas domain in JAZ10.4 indicated to us that this splice variant might exert dominant-negative effects on JA signaling, as previously observed for JAZ10.3 (CITATION) and other JAZs in which the Jas domain was removed by targeted deletion or mutagenesis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To investigate this possibility, we assessed JA-related phenotypes in transgenic plants overexpressing JAZ10.1, JAZ10.3, or JAZ10.4. As previously reported by CITATION, overexpression of JAZ10.1 and JAZ10.3 did not have overt effects on plant fertility. By contrast, we observed that ∼30% (49 of 150 plants examined) of T1 plants expressing a 35S-JAZ10.4 transgene were male sterile as a result of defects in filament elongation and anther dehiscence (Figures 6A to 6D ). These flower phenotypes, which are hallmarks of strong JA synthesis and perception mutants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), were not rescued by exogenous methyl-JA (MeJA) (data not shown). Fertilization of sterile 35S-JAZ10.4 flowers with wild-type pollen yielded F1 progeny in which the sterile phenotype strictly cosegregated with the 35S-JAZ10.4 transgene. To determine whether overexpression of JAZ10.4 affects other JA responses, we compared JA-mediated root growth inhibition in 35S-JAZ10.4 seedlings to that of wild-type, coi1-1, 35S-JAZ10.1, and 35S-JAZ10.3 seedlings (Figures 6E and 6F). As reported by CITATION, root growth of 35S-JAZ10.3 seedlings was moderately resistant to JA, whereas 35S-JAZ10.1 roots were as sensitive as wild-type seedlings to the hormone. 35S-JAZ10.4 seedlings exhibited a strong JA-insensitive root growth phenotype, which was comparable to that of coi1-1 seedlings. [[FIGURE]] The strong JA-insensitive phenotypes conferred by JAZ10.4 overexpression, together with the inability of this isoform to interact with COI1, suggested that JAZ10.4 is resistant to JA-induced protein degradation. To test this idea, we generated stable transgenic lines expressing JAZ10.1-YFP, JAZ10.3-YFP, and JAZ10.4-YFP fusion proteins under control of the 35S promoter. Root growth inhibition assays showed that the JA responsiveness of each line was essentially identical to that of JAZ10.1-, JAZ10.3-, and JAZ10.4-overexpresing plants; the root length of wild-type, 35S-JAZ10.1-YFP, 35S-JAZ10.3-YFP, and 35S-JAZ10.4-YFP seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing 50 μM MeJA was 5.6 ± 1.0 mm, 5.4 ± 0.8 mm, 11.5 ± 0.5 mm, and 16.9 ± 1.3 mm, respectively. To investigate the hormone-dependent stability of each JAZ10 isoform in vivo, we monitored YFP fluorescence in roots of 7-d-old transgenic seedlings that were either treated (for 2 h) or not treated with MeJA. In the absence of MeJA, a nuclear-localized YFP signal was observed in all three genotypes (Figure 7A ). Analysis of several independent lines (at least five lines per construct) showed that the strength of the YFP signal in 35S-JAZ10.1-YFP plants was consistently less than that in 35S-JAZ10.3-YFP and 35S-JAZ10.4-YFP seedlings (Figure 7A, Mock). Treatment with 1 μM MeJA eliminated nuclear YFP fluorescence in 35S-JAZ10.1-YFP roots but did not obviously affect the signal in 35S-JAZ10.3-YFP and 35S-JAZ10.4-YFP seedlings. Treatment of seedlings with 100 μM MeJA resulted in loss of the JAZ10.3-YFP nuclear signal, although a diffuse (presumably cytosolic) fluorescence pattern in roots was still detected. The fluorescence pattern in 35S-JAZ10.4-YFP seedlings was unaffected by 100 μM MeJA. We conclude that the relative stability of the three JAZ10 splice variants in hormone-stimulated plants is JAZ10.4 > JAZ10.3 > JAZ10.1 and that JAZ10.4 is highly resistant to JA-induced degradation. Pretreatment of seedlings with MG132, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, impaired JA-induced turnover of JAZ10.1-YFP (Figure 7B). This finding indicates that JA-induced degradation of this Jas domain–containing isoform is mediated by the 26S-proteasome pathway. [[FIGURE]] We next investigated whether the strong repression of JA responses by JAZ10.4 is dependent on a functional TIFY motif. To address this question, we generated transgenic lines that overproduce JAZ10.4I->A and JAZ10.4G->A proteins harboring I107A or G111A point mutations, respectively, in the TIFY motif of JAZ10.4. Although these mutations abrogate JAZ10.1 interaction with other JAZs in the Y2H system (Figure 2F), it was necessary to determine the effect of these mutations on JAZ10.4–JAZ interactions. As shown in Figure 8A, JAZ10.4I->A lost the ability to interact with JAZ6, JAZ10.1, JAZ10.3, and JAZ10.4. JAZ10.4G->A also failed to bind JAZ10.4 but did retain ability to interact with JAZ6, JAZ10.1, and JAZ10.3. Protein gel blot analysis of protein extracts from yeast strains cotransformed with JAZ10.1 and mutant forms of JAZ10.4 showed that the JAZ fusion proteins were expressed (Figure 8B ). These findings, together with results of experiments to assess JAZ10.4G->A and JAZ10.4I->A interaction with other members of the JAZ family (see Supplemental Figure 4 online), indicate that I107A is more effective than G111A at disrupting JAZ10.4 heterodimerization with other JAZs. [[FIGURE]] Having established the effect of I107A and G111A on JAZ10.4–JAZ interactions in yeast, we assessed JA-mediated fertility phenotypes in transgenic plants that overexpress JAZ10.4I->A and JAZ10.4G->A. Of 150 independent 35S-JAZ10.4I->A plants (T1 generation) examined, none showed defects in filament elongation, anther dehiscence, silique development, or viable seed production (Figures 8C and 8D), indicating that I107A completely suppresses JAZ10.4-mediated male sterility. In a population of 40 independent T1 35S-JAZ10.4G->A plants, 12 individuals exhibited reduced fertility; these plants produced only a few mature siliques during the latter stage of reproductive development (Figure 8C). Some flowers produced by this group of semifertile 35S-JAZ10.4G->A plants were indistinguishable from wild-type flowers, whereas other 35S-JAZ10.4G->A flowers had anther filaments that failed to fully elongate (Figures 8E and 8F). We also studied the effect of TIFY point mutations (I107A and G111A) on the JA-resistant root growth phenotype that results from JAZ10.4 overexpression. In agreement with the ability of I107A to strongly suppress JAZ10.4-mediated sterility, 35S-JAZ10.4I->A roots were as sensitive to JA-induced growth arrest as wild-type roots (Figures 8G and 8H). 35S-JAZ10.4G->A roots, by contrast, were less sensitive to JA than wild-type roots but significantly more sensitive (P < 0.0001; Student's t test) than 35S-JAZ10.4 roots. These results show that the ability of JAZ10.4 to repress JA signaling in various tissues is strongly suppressed by I107A and moderately suppressed by G111A. To test the possibility that normal JA responsiveness of 35S-JAZ10.4I->A plants results from low expression of the JAZ10.4I->A mutant protein in planta, we analyzed the level of GUS activity in stable transgenic lines that constitutively express either JAZ10.4-GUS or JAZ10.4I->A-GUS fusion proteins. In several independent transgenic lines tested (at least five lines per construct), seedlings expressing the 35S-JAZ10.4I->A-GUS transgene exhibited a pattern of strong blue staining (in roots, cotyledons, and leaves) that was similar to that of 35S-JAZ10.4-GUS seedlings (Figure 9A ), indicating that the JAZ10.4I->A-GUS fusion protein is expressed. 35S-JAZ10.4-GUS plants were male sterile and highly insensitive to JA-induced root growth arrest (Figures 9B and 9C). This finding shows that JAZ10.4-GUS, like JAZ10.4, strongly represses JA signal output. Plants overexpressing JAZ10.4I->A-GUS, however, were fully fertile and exhibited normal sensitivity to exogenous JA (Figures 9B and 9C). We also examined the subcellular localization of JAZ10.4-YFP and JAZ10.4I->A-YFP fusion proteins to determine whether I107A affects subcellular protein distribution. Following transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression of these proteins in tobacco leaf epidermal cells, laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that both JAZ10.4-YFP and JAZ10.4I->A-YFP are targeted to the nucleus (Figure 9D). These results indicate that the I107A mutant form of JAZ10.4 is expressed and targeted to the nucleus. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as the wild type for all experiments. Soil-grown plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 21°C under 16 h light (100 μE m−2 s−1) and 8 h dark. Arabidopsis was transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58C1) using the floral dip method (CITATION). A list of transgenic plants used in this study is provided in Supplemental Table 1 online. Transformed lines (T1 generation) were selected on MS plates containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and vancomycin (100 μg/mL). At least 40 independent T1 plants per genotype were transferred to soil for subsequent phenotypic analysis. We identified homozygous lines by testing T3 progeny for resistance to kanamycin. We propagated male-sterile 35S-JAZ10.4 lines by outcrossing to wild-type pollen. F1 progeny containing the transgene were selected on MS medium plates containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL). Nicotiana tabacum (cv Petit Havana) was grown in a growth chamber maintained under 17 h of light (200 μE/m−2/s) at 28°C and 7 h of dark at 18°C. Y2H assays were performed with the Matchmaker LexA system (Clontech). Full-length JAZ cDNAs were isolated as previously described (CITATION). cDNAs encoding JAZ10 splice variants were generated from RNA prepared from rosette leaves collected 1.5 h after mechanical wounding. RT-PCR reactions were performed with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the primer sets listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. JAZ cDNAs were subcloned into the Matchmaker pGILDA vector to generate fusions of the bait protein with the LexA DNA BD. These cDNAs were also subcloned into the pB42AD vector to generate fusions of the prey protein with the B42 AD. Yeast transformation and selection of transformants were conducted as described by CITATION. JAZ–JAZ interaction assays were performed as follows. A 1-mL culture of yeast transformants in SD-glucose medium (BD Biosciences) supplemented with -Ura/-His/-Trp dropout solution was grown to an OD600 of 1.0 to 1.2. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.4 mL of distilled water. Four microliters of the resulting cell suspension was placed on SD-galactose/raffinose (-Ura/-His/-Trp)-inducing media (in 96-well plates) containing 80 μg/mL of X-gal. To test the interaction of JAZ10 variants with COI1, coronatine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium before the yeast cells were plated. All photographic images of Y2H plates were taken after 48 h of incubation of the plate at 30°C. Expression of the AD and BD fusion proteins was detected by protein gel blot analysis using anti-hemagglutinin (HA; Covance) and anti-LexA (Upstate) antibodies, respectively. β-Galactosidase activity in yeast cells was measured with liquid cultures as described by the manufacturer (Clontech) using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the TIFY motif was performed with Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase according to the instructions provided with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR reactions were performed with JAZ3, JAZ10.1, and JAZ10.4 cDNAs in pB42AD or pGEM-T Easy vectors, and the mutagenic primers are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pBI-eYFP binary vector was prepared by subcloning the eYFP coding sequence into the KpnI and SacI restriction sites of the pBI-TS binary vector (CITATION; CITATION), which is a modified version of pBI121. The PCR-amplified open reading frames (without a stop codon) of JAZ10.1, JAZ10.3, JAZ10.4, and JAZ10.4I->A were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega), followed by recloning into the BamHI site of pBI-eYFP. The resulting constructs encode fusion proteins in which the JAZ C terminus is fused in frame to the N terminus of eYFP. Oligonucleotide primers used to generate these constructs are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. Agrobacterium (strain C58C1) harboring binary vector constructs were grown overnight at 28°C in YEP medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL rifampicin. Bacterial cells were resuspended in induction medium (10 mM MES, pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, and 150 μM acetosyringone) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature prior to infiltration. Leaves of 5-week-old Nicotiana tabacum plants were syringe-infiltrated with the bacterial suspension (OD600 = 0.2), and plants were maintained in a growth chamber for 2 d. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope (Carl Zeiss) and imaging software provided by the manufacturer. To visualize nuclei, tobacco leaves that were previously infected with Agrobacterium were syringe-infiltrated 2 h prior to imaging with a solution containing 10 μg/mL DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). YFP and DAPI fluorescence were monitored simultaneously by excitation at 514 nm (argon laser) and 405 nm (diode laser), respectively. YFP and DAPI fluorescence was detected after passage through band-pass 530- to 600-nm and 474- to 525-nm emission filters, respectively. The full-length JAZ3 coding sequence was cloned into the pSY728, pSY738, pSY735, and pSY736 vectors (CITATION) to generate JAZ3-nYFP, JAZ3-cYFP, nYFP-JAZ3, and cYFP-JAZ3, respectively. See Supplemental Table 1 online for primer information. These constructs were subcloned into the XhoI and SalI restriction sites of pBI-TS and transformed into Agrobacterium strain C58C1. Mixtures of two Agrobacterium strains were coinfiltrated into tobacco leaves, such that each of the four possible combinations of nYFP and cYFP JAZ3-fusion constructs was coexpressed. Imaging of protein–protein interaction was performed by confocal laser microscopy as described above. Seedlings of transgenic plants expressing JAZ10.1-YFP, JAZ10.3-YFP, and JAZ10.4-YFP fusion proteins grown for 7 d on MS plates were transferred to a 48-well microtiter plate for JA treatment. Seedlings were incubated with JA (0, 1, and 100 μM MeJA) for 2 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker with low speed (70 rpm). To test the effect of proteasome inhibition on protein stability, seedlings expressing JAZ10.1-YFP were pretreated with water or 50 μM MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h prior to 10 μM MeJA treatment. Fluorescence of JAZ10-YFP fusion proteins was analyzed with a Zeiss Axio Scope fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images were taken using the software AxioVision 4.7 provided by the manufacturer. All images shown in a single panel in Figure 7 were taken with the same exposure time and software settings. Seeds were surface-sterilized with 30% (v/v) commercial bleach for 15 min and washed 10 times with sterile distilled water. Seeds of each genotype were placed on square Petri plates (Fisher) containing MS medium that was supplemented with 50 μM MeJA. Plates were incubated at 4°C for 4 d in darkness and then incubated under normal growth conditions for the remainder of the experiment. Plates were oriented in a vertical position 6 to 7 d prior to measurement of primary root length. Wild-type (Col-0) and coi1-1 seeds (or other appropriate lines) were included as controls for JA-sensitive and JA-resistant phenotypes, respectively. Seedlings grown on MS medium as described in the legend to Figure 9 were transferred to a 48-well microtiter plate for GUS staining. Seedlings were vacuum-infiltrated with GUS staining buffer (50 mM KPO4, pH 7.2, 2 mM potassium ferricyanide, 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 2 mM X-Gluc) for 15 min and then incubated for 12 h at 37°C. A graded series of ethanol washes (up to 70% ethanol) was used to remove chlorophyll, as described previously (CITATION). Photographic images were taken with a Leica MZ16 dissecting microscope. Strong GUS staining was also observed in several (at least five per construct) independent 35S-JAZ10.4-GUS and 35S-JAZ10.4I->A-GUS lines within 2 to 3 h of incubation with the X-Gluc substrate. The nucleotide sequence of At5g13220.4 encoding JAZ10.4 has been deposited in GenBank under accession number FJ417331.
