!~ABS~! The secretory pathway is responsible for the transport of newly synthesized transmembrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to their destinations via the Golgi/ trans -Golgi network (TGN). Cargo proteins at each station are actively sorted by specific sorting signals on the cargo and the corresponding coat complexes. Here, we used the Arabidopsis regulator of G-protein signaling (AtRGS1), which contains an N-terminal potentially sensing glucose seven-transmembrane domain and a C-terminal RGS domain, as a model to uncover sorting motifs required for its cell surface expression. Expression of wild-type and truncated or mutated AtRGS1 fluorescent fusion proteins identified two cysteine residues in the extracellular N-terminus that are essential for endoplasmic reticulum exit and/or correct folding of AtRGS1. The linker between the seven-transmembrane and RGS domains contains an endoplasmic reticulum export signal, whereas the C-terminus is dispensable for the plasma membrane expression of AtRGS1. Interestingly, deletion of the RGS domain results in Golgi/TGN localization of the truncated AtRGS1. Further analysis using site-directed mutagenesis showed that a tyrosine-based motif embedded in the RGS domain is essential for Golgi/TGN export of AtRGS1. These results reveal a new role for the RGS domain in regulating AtRGS1 trafficking from the Golgi/TGN to the plasma membrane and explain the interaction between the seven-transmembrane and RGS domains.
!~RES~! To systematically examine the subcellular localization of AtRGS1 in plant cells, we constructed transgenic plants expressing AtRGS1::GFP, which is able to complement the null mutant Atrgs1 ( CITATION ). Because overexpression may cause mislocalization of a fusion protein, we used T2 transgenic plants to ensure that expression of fusion proteins and their subcellular localization are stable in our experiments. We did not observe mislocalization of the fusion proteins due to overexpression using fluorescent microscopy. Subcellular localization of AtRGS1::GFP was carefully examined in various types of cells together with transgenic plants expressing an ER marker (AtWAK2-SP::GFP::HDEL) and a Golgi marker (GmMan1 1–49 ::YFP) ( CITATION ) ( CITATION ). In pavement and hypocotyl epidermal cells, AtRGS1::GFP was evenly distributed in the plasma membrane ( CITATION ), while ER ( CITATION ) and Golgi ( CITATION ) markers were localized to punctate structures that are closely attached to the plasma membrane due to the central vacuole, which physically forces the structures near the plasma membrane in these cells. However, the structural difference in expression patterns of AtRGS1::GFP, ER, and Golgi markers was observed in root cells and guard cells. In these cells, AtRGS1::GFP was clearly distributed in the plasma membrane as well as in endosomes ( CITATION ). The ER marker displayed a perinuclear and a reticulate cortical expression pattern ( CITATION ), while the Golgi marker formed a pattern of minute clusters ( CITATION ). The different morphologies of the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane in root and guard cells provided a format in which we could clearly determine the subcellular localization of GFP-fused truncations and point mutations of AtRGS1 in the following studies. To better describe the characteristics of the AtRGS1 sequence, we divided full-length AtRGS1, which is composed of 459 amino acids (aa), into five segments: a short extracellular N-terminus (1–13 aa), a 7-TM domain (14–250 aa), a linker between the 7-TM and RGS domains (251–283 aa), an RGS domain (284–413 aa), and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (414–459 aa) ( CITATION ). To identify essential motifs for AtRGS1 trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane, we made a fusion construct consisting of the 7-TM domain of AtRGS1 and GFP, designated AtRGS 14–250 :: GFP, and transformed it into Arabidopsis plants. Confocal microscopy analysis of root cells of the resulting transgenic plants showed that AtRGS 14–250 ::GFP was primarily localized in the ER ( CITATION – CITATION ). This fluorescence pattern is quite similar to that of AtWAK2-SP::GFP::HDEL ( CITATION – CITATION ), a widely used ER marker. Confocal microscopy analysis of the root cells stained with the DNA probe, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), demonstrated that green fluorescence surrounded the blue circle that was formed via DAPI binding to DNA. To exclude the possibility that AtRGS 14–250 ::GFP might be partially localized to the Golgi and/or plasma membrane, the transgenic plants were treated with brefeldin A (BFA), a fungus-derived macrocyclic lactone that can block the recycling pathway of plasma membrane proteins and thus lead to the formation of BFA compartments ( CITATION ; CITATION ). It is well established that the Golgi and early endosomes are sensitive to BFA ( CITATION ). As shown in CITATION – CITATION , a 3-h treatment of BFA resulted in accumulation of the Golgi maker GmMan1 1–49 :: GFP and AtRGS1::GFP in the BFA compartments ( CITATION ). However, little effect of BFA on the fluorescent pattern of AtRGS 14–250 ::GFP and AtWAK2-SP::GFP::HDEL was observed ( CITATION ). These results suggest that the 7-TM domain of AtRGS1 lacks an ER export motif. The N-terminus of AtRGS1 contains two cysteine residues (Cys5 and Cys11), which are predicted to form a disulphide bond in GPCRs ( CITATION ; CITATION ). To investigate the role of the N-terminus and the two cysteine residues in trafficking of AtRGS1, we generated several mutant AtRGS1::GFP constructs that either lack the N-terminal 13 amino acids (AtRGS1 14–459 ) or contain one or two Cys–Gly mutations (AtRGS1 C5G , AtRGS1 C11G , and AtRGS1 C5,11G ) and transformed each construct into Arabidopsis plants. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that AtRGS1 14–459 ::GFP was localized to the ER in root and guard cells ( CITATION ), indicating that the N-terminus is required for ER export. Likewise, both the single (AtRGS1 C5G ::GFP and AtRGS1 C11G ::GFP) and double (AtRGS1 C5,11G ::GFP) cysteine mutations led to the retention of AtRGS1–GFP in the ER ( CITATION – CITATION ), suggesting that the two cysteine residues play a crucial role in ER export of AtRGS1. In contrast, mutations of another pair of cysteines, Cys84 and Cys153, which are also predicted to form a potential disulfide bond ( CITATION ), had no effect on AtRGS1 subcellular localization ( CITATION ). Thus, we conclude that the disulfide bond formed at the N-terminus is vital for expression of AtRGS1 at the cell surface. To identify the sorting signals required for the cell surface expression of AtRGS1, we transformed three constructs encoding truncated AtRGS1–GFP/YFP proteins, AtRGS1 1–250 ::GFP (containing the N-terminus and 7-TM domain), AtRGS1 1–283 :: YFP (AtRGS1 1–250 plus the linker), and AtRGS1 1–250+284–459 ::GFP (lacking the linker), into the wild-type Arabidopsis plants. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that, while AtRGS1 1–250 :: GFP and AtRGS1 1–250+284–459 ::GFP were localized in the ER ( CITATION , and CITATION – CITATION ), AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP was localized to cytosolic punctates that resemble the Golgi/TGN ( CITATION ). To confirm the Golgi/TGN localization of AtRGS1 1–283 :: YFP, we crossed the AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP transgenic line with a well-characterized TGN marker line expressing VHA-a1–GFP ( CITATION ). As expected, AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP largely co-localized with VHA-a1–GFP ( CITATION – CITATION ). In addition, AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP was transiently co-expressed with the Golgi marker GONST1::RFP in tobacco epidermal cells. Fluorescence imaging results showed some of the AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP-labeled particles partially overlapped GONST1::RFP ( CITATION – CITATION ), suggesting that AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP is slightly localized to the Golgi. Furthermore, the transgenic seedlings expressing AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP were treated with FM4-64, a general fluorescent marker of endocytosis. As shown in CITATION – CITATION , many of the AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP-labeled vesicles were co-localized with the FM4-64-stained membranes, indicating that AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP is mainly localized in the TGN on the secretory pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the linker of AtRGS1 contains the ER export signal. The dileucine (LL) motifs in the membrane-proximal C-terminus of GPCRs have been demonstrated to function as sorting signals for ER and Golgi/TGN exports ( CITATION ; CITATION ). We found that there are two LL motifs in the linker sequence of AtRGS1. To examine their roles in ER export, we mutated either or both of the LL motifs into alanines (AA). The resulting transgenes (AtRGS1 LL252, 253AA ::GFP and AtRGS1 LL280, 281AA ::GFP) were transformed into Arabidopsis plants ( CITATION – CITATION ), while AtRGS1 LLLL252, 253 280, 281AAAA ::GFP was transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells ( CITATION ). Unexpectedly, fluorescence imaging of the transgenic cells showed that all of the fusion proteins were localized to the plasma membrane ( CITATION – CITATION ). These data indicate that the two LL motifs located in the linker are not critical for the ER export of AtRGS1. To identify a likely ER export motif, we made four constructs expressing truncated AtRGS1 proteins with partial deletion of the linker, designated AtRGS1 1–262 ::GFP, AtRGS1 1–269 ::GFP, AtRGS1 1–276 ::GFP, and AtRGS1 1–282 ::GFP, and transformed them into Arabidopsis plants. Confocal microscopy analysis of the transgenic plants showed that, while AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP was localized to the Golgi/TGN, all of the other truncated fusion proteins were only observed in the ER ( CITATION ). These results suggest that the ER export signal is likely located in the latter portion of the linker. Our results showed that AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP is mainly localized in the TGN ( CITATION – CITATION ). To identify the TGN export signal, we expressed two truncated AtRGS1::GFP fusion proteins lacking the C-terminus (AtRGS1 1–413 ::GFP) or the RGS domain (AtRGS1 1–283+414–459 ::GFP) in Arabidopsis plants. Fluorescence imaging demonstrated that AtRGS1 1–413 ::GFP was localized to the plasma membrane and endosomes ( CITATION ) while AtRGS1 1–283+414–459 ::GFP was in the TGN ( CITATION ). These results suggest that the sorting signal required for TGN export of AtRGS1 is located in the RGS domain. To map the TGN export motif, we expressed a series of GFP fusions of AtRGS1 carrying a truncated RGS domain, designated AtRGS1 1–318 ::GFP, AtRGS1 1–355 ::GFP, AtRGS1 1–399 ::GFP, and AtRGS1 1–283+356–459 ::GFP, in Arabidopsis plants. Our results showed that all four truncated proteins were localized to the ER rather than in the TGN ( CITATION – CITATION ), suggesting that these truncated AtRGS1::GFP fusion proteins are likely misfolded and retained in the ER by the ER protein quality-control system. When these transgenic plant cells were treated with BFA, we found that root cells expressing AtRGS1 1–399 :: GFP formed BFA bodies ( CITATION – CITATION ), but no BFA bodies were detected in the transgenic plants expressing the other three fusion constructs (data not shown). We observed that the punctates labeled with AtRGS 1–283 ::YFP were also sensitive to BFA ( CITATION ). Morphological comparison revealed that the BFA bodies formed in AtRGS1 1–399 ::GFP and AtRGS1::GFP transgenic cells were filled with fluorescence while the BFA bodies in AtRGS1 1–283 ::GFP transgenic cells displayed a doughnut-like ring structure with punctate fluorescent staining inside. Taken together, these results indicate that AtRGS1 1–399 may contain TGN export signals. Because cargo proteins at the TGN are sorted by adaptor proteins, which often recognize the tyrosine-based motif of the cargo proteins ( CITATION ; CITATION ), we assumed that a similar motif was present in the RGS domain. There are three tyrosine residues at positions 317, 329, and 344 within the fragment (284–399 aa) of the RGS domain. To determine TGN sorting signals in the RGS domain, we individually mutated Tyr317, Tyr329, and Tyr344 to alanines. Subcellular localization analysis showed that both AtRGS1 Y317A ::GFP and AtRGS1 Y329A ::GFP displayed the same expression pattern as AtRGS1::GFP ( CITATION , and CITATION ), whereas the Tyr344 mutation resulted in significant retention of AtRGS1::GFP in the TGN ( CITATION ). This result was confirmed by the partial co-localization of AtRGS1 Y344A :: GFP with AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP ( CITATION – CITATION ). Thus, we conclude that the Tyr344-based motif functions as a TGN export signal for AtRGS1. The TGN is regarded as an early endosome merging the secretory and endocytic pathways in plant cells ( CITATION ; CITATION ). The different subcellular localizations of AtRGS1::GFP and AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP provided an opportunity to study whether or not the early endosome and TGN are merged in the AtRGS1 protein trafficking system. To investigate this, we crossed the transgenic line expressing AtRGS1::GFP with that expressing AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP. As previously observed, AtRGS1::GFP was distributed in the plasma membrane as well as endosomes ( CITATION ), whereas AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP was localized to the TGN ( CITATION ). In the merged GFP/YFP image ( CITATION ), the GFP-labeled endosome did not overlap with the YFP-labeled TGN. To further demonstrate this, the transgenic plants co-expressing AtRGS1::GFP and AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP were treated with BFA to which both fluorescent-labeled proteins are sensitive ( CITATION ). The resulting fluorescent signals revealed AtRGS1::GFP at the center of BFA bodies, whereas AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP was detected surrounding the BFA bodies ( CITATION ). Taken together, these data indicate that the AtRGS1-labeled endosome is distinct from the AtRGS1 1–283 -labeled TGN.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis plants (Columbia-0 ecotype) were grown in a phytotron with long-day conditions (16-h light/8-h dark) and light intensity (100 mol photons m –2 s –1 ) at 22°C. All plasmids were constructed using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen) as described ( CITATION ). The cDNA of AtRGS1 was isolated from a cDNA library by RT–PCR, and used as the template to amplify the following cDNA fragments encoding for 1–250 aa (AtRGS1 1–250 ), 1–255 aa (AtRGS1 1–255 ), 1–262 aa (AtRGS1 1–262 ), 1–276 aa (AtRGS1 1–276 ), 1–182 aa (AtRGS1 1–282 ), 1–283 aa (AtRGS 1–283 ), 1–318 aa (AtRGS 1–318 ), 1–355 aa (AtRGS 1–355 ), 1–399 aa (AtRGS 1–399 ), 1–413 aa (AtRGS1 1–413 ), 14–250 aa (AtRGS1 14–250 ), 14–459 aa (AtRGS1 14–459 ), 284–413 aa (AtRGS1 284–413 ), 284–459 aa (AtRGS1 284–459 ), 356–459 aa (AtRGS1 356–459 ), and 414–459 aa (AtRGS1 414–459 ). For constructs expressing AtRGS1 1–283+414–459 , AtRGS1 1–250+284–459 , and AtRGS1 1–283+356–459 , the amplified fragments of AtRGS1 414–459 , AtRGS1 284–459 , and AtRGS1 356–459 were ligated to AtRGS1 1–283 or AtRGS1 1–250 using a Hin dIII restriction site, respectively. Point mutations including AtRGS1 C5G , AtRGS1 C11G , AtRGS1 C5,11G , AtRGS1 C84,153G , AtRGS1 L252,253A , AtRGS1 L280,281A , AtRGS1 Y317A , AtRGS1 Y329A , and AtRGS1 Y344A were created by using the GeneTailer TM Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen). AtRGS1 1–283 was cloned into pGWB41 (35S-driven C-terminal YFP fusion); the other cDNA fragments were cloned into pGWB5 (35S-driven C-terminal GFP fusion). All constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis by the flower dip method ( CITATION ). Transgenic plants were first screened on plates containing the half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma), 1% (W/V) D-glucose, 0.7% (W/V) phytoagar, and 50 mg l –1 kanamycin. Then, 4–5-day-old seedlings were examined using an Olympus FV1000 confocal system. Transgenic plants co-expressing two fluorescence protein fusions including VHA-a1::GFP and AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP, and AtRGS1 Y344A ::GFP and AtRGS1 1–283 ::YFP were made by crossing between single transgenic plants. Fluorescence analysis was performed using LSCM (Carl Zeiss LSM510 META). For GFP detection, the excitation wavelength was 488nm and the emission was collected between 505 and 530nm. For YFP detection, the excitation wavelength was 514nm, and the emission was collected between 530 and 600nm. For DAPI detection, the excitation wavelength was 364nm, and the emission was collected over 385nm. The pictures of root cells were photographed using a ×40 oil immersion objective, and the pictures of the stomata guard cells were photographed using a ×100 oil immersion objective. The detection of the co-expression of YFP and GFP was performed according to CITATION . Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. For DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, 4–5-day-old seedlings were put in 1.5ml eppendorf tubes containing 1mL PBST with 2.86µM DAPI (Sigma; diluted from a 2.86-mM stock in water) for 5 min; the seedlings were washed with PBST four times. For BFA (brefeldin A) treatment, 4–5-day-old seedlings were first treated with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor CHX (Sigma; diluted from a 50-mM stock in DMSO) with a final concentration of 50µM for 30 min, then treated with 25µM BFA (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes; diluted from a 50-mM stock in DMSO) for 2–3 h.
