!~ABS~! Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab is one of the most important plant diseases worldwide, affecting wheat, barley and other small grains. Trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulate in the grain, presenting a food safety risk and health hazard to humans and animals. Despite considerable breeding efforts, highly resistant wheat or barley cultivars are not available. We screened an activation tagged Arabidopsis thaliana population for resistance to trichothecin (Tcin), a type B trichothecene in the same class as DON. Here we show that one of the resistant lines identified, trichothecene resistant 1 (trr1) contains a T-DNA insertion upstream of two nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) genes, AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5. Expression of both nsLTP genes was induced in trr1 over 10-fold relative to wild type. Overexpression of AtLTP4.4 provided greater resistance to Tcin than AtLTP4.5 in Arabidopsis thaliana and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae relative to wild type or vector transformed lines, suggesting a conserved protection mechanism. Tcin treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Arabidopsis and ROS stain was associated with the chloroplast, the cell wall and the apoplast. ROS levels were attenuated in Arabidopsis and in yeast overexpressing AtLTP4.4 relative to the controls. Exogenous addition of glutathione and other antioxidants enhanced resistance of Arabidopsis to Tcin while the addition of buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, increased sensitivity, suggesting that resistance was mediated by glutathione. Total glutathione content was significantly higher in Arabidopsis and in yeast overexpressing AtLTP4.4 relative to the controls, highlighting the importance of AtLTP4.4 in maintaining the redox state. These results demonstrate that trichothecenes cause ROS accumulation and overexpression of AtLTP4.4 protects against trichothecene-induced oxidative stress by increasing the glutathione-based antioxidant defense.
!~RES~! To investigate the mechanisms underlying trichothecene resistance, we screened activation tagged Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) seeds for resistance to 4 μM Tcin (1.33 mg/L). This concentration of Tcin was chosen because treatment of Arabidopsis (Col-0) leaves with 4 μM Tcin resulted in uniform leaf bleaching in detached leaf assays and caused ~90% inhibition of root growth in germination assays and strong inhibition of vegetative growth. This concentration of Tcin is also similar to the IC50 for Tcin in yeast [CITATION] as shown in CITATION. A population of ~250,000 M2 generation Arabidopsis seeds transformed with the T-DNA vector, pSKI015, which contains four copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S enhancer [CITATION], were screened. One of the resistant lines identified in our screen, trr1 (trichothecene resistant 1) grew on agar containing 4 μM Tcin, which inhibited germination and root growth of the wild type, Col-0 (CITATION). The untreated plants from the resistant line were indistinguishable from the untreated wild type plants. To identify the flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion locus in trr1, thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR was used [CITATION]. Sequence analysis indicated that the T-DNA tag was inserted into the last exon of the At5G55440 gene (CITATION), which encodes a protein of unknown function. To determine the effect of the insertion on transcription in this region, expression of At5G55440, two upstream genes (At5G55420 and At5G55430) and two downstream genes (At5G55450 and At5G55460) was analyzed using qRT-PCR with primers specific for each gene (CITATION). There was little difference in expression of At5G55420 and no expression was detected from At5G55430 or At5G55440 in either trr1 or in wild type. However in trr1, expression of At5G55450, which is ~220 bp downstream of the T-DNA insert was induced 12-fold and expression of At5G55460, which is 424 bp downstream of At5G55450, was induced 14-fold relative to wild type (CITATION). At5G55450 and At5G55460 encode two novel non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) genes, which belong to type IV nsLTPs previously designated as AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5, respectively [CITATION]. (A) Screening of the activation tagged Arabidopsis lines identified a mutant, which was able to form roots/leaves on 4 μM Tcin. (B) The T-DNA tag was inserted into the last exon of the At5G55440 gene in trr1. (C) Expression analysis of the activation tagged AT5G55440 locus and the flanking genes, At5G55420, At5G55430, At5G55450 (AtLTP4.4), At5G55460 (AtLTP4.5) and wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 by qRT-PCR. Expression levels of AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 were significantly higher in the activation tagged trr1 line compared to the wild type Col-0. (D) Immunoblot analysis of total protein (25 μg) isolated from Col-0 and 3 independent Arabidopsis lines containing AtLTP4.4:GFP or AtLTP4.5:GFP, separated on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and probed with monoclonal anti-His IgG (1:500) (GenScript) followed by Amersham ECL Plex C anti-mouse IgG (1:2500) conjugated with Cy3 and scanned using the Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The blot was stained with Ponceau S and the ~52 kD band is shown for equal loading. (E) Analysis of AtLTP4.4 RNA expression in two independently transformed Arabidopsis lines and in the LTP4.4/LTP4.5 knockout line (SALK_207859c). Error indicates S.E where n = 3 independent replicates. Two-sample unpaired t-tests for equal means were performed between the different vectors containing the nsLTPs relative to the vector control for each toxin *P<0.05 ***P < 0.001. To determine if overexpression of AtLTP4.4 or AtLTP4.5 was responsible for Tcin resistance in trr1, C-terminal GFP fusions of each gene were constructed and cloned downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter in the pEarleyGate 103 vector [CITATION]. Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed with AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP using the floral dip method [CITATION]. Homozygous lines for each construct and the vector were identified based on segregation on media containing BASTA. AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP overexpressing lines were phenotypically normal and indistinguishable from wild type plants. Immunoblot analysis showed that AtLTP4.4:GFP (39.4 kDa) was expressed at a higher level than AtLTP4.5:GFP (40.1 kDa) in three independently generated transgenic lines with each vector (CITATION). Analysis of AtLTP4.4 mRNA levels in lines #7 and #16 by qRT-PCR indicated that line #7 showed a 690-fold increase and line #16 showed a 290-fold increase in expression relative to the vector control, 35S:GFP (Col-0) (CITATION). The AtLTP4.4/AtLTP4.5 knockout line (SALK_207859c), which was phenotypically similar to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0), did not express AtLTP4.4 (CITATION). Sensitivity of the transgenic lines to Tcin was examined using detached leaf assays in liquid media and by germination assays on solid media. The detached leaf assay showed that the AtLTP4.4 overexpressing line #16 was partially protected from leaf bleaching caused by 4 μM and 8 μM Tcin (2.66 mg/L) relative to the 35S:GFP (Col-0) control (CITATION). The LTP4.4/4.5 combined knockout line (SALK_207859c) did not appear to impact sensitivity to the toxin compared to the vector control (CITATION). When transgenic lines were germinated on solid media containing Tcin, AtLTP4.4 overexpressing transgenic lines #7 and #16 had improved germination on media containing 3 μM Tcin (~1.0 mg/L) compared to 35S:GFP (Col-0) control (CITATION). AtLTP4.5 overexpressing lines were not as resistant as the AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines and were not analyzed further. The percentage of AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines able to form roots two weeks after exposure to 4 μM Tcin, determined by counting ~100 seedlings per line, and is shown in CITATION. Six different transgenic lines overexpressing AtLTP4.4 displayed significantly greater root growth at 14 days after plating compared to the control. These results demonstrate that AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines show improved resistance to Tcin. (A) Detached leaves overexpressing AtLTP4.4 (line #16) relative to 35S:GFP (Col-0) control and the LTP4.4/4.5 KO line after treatment with 4 and 8 μM Tcin for 72 h. (B) Germination of AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines # 7 and # 16 on 3 μM Tcin relative to the control, 35S:GFP. (C) Percentage of wild type and AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines able to form roots on 4 μM Tcin in 2 weeks. Error bars represent standard error (S.E.) calculated from three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, *P < 0.05, **P<0.01. Analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis leaves expressing AtLTP4.4:GFP (line #16) by confocal microscopy revealed that the GFP signal accumulated in the cell wall and in the apoplast (CITATION) and expression was also detected in the roots (CITATION). Intracellular expression of AtLTP4.4:GFP was observed in a network, characteristic of the ER (CITATION) and AtLTP4.4:GFP colocalized with the chloroplasts as indicated by the yellow signal (CITATION). Arabidopsis Col-0 transformed with the 35S:GFP vector revealed no staining around the chloroplast or the ER (CITATION). Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression analysis of AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP in tobacco leaves confirmed the subcellular localization observed in the transgenic plants. Transient expression analysis 2 days after Agrobacterium infiltration showed that AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP were localized in the extracellular space near the cell wall (CITATION). AtLTP4.4:GFP showed stronger GFP signal than AtLTP4.5:GFP and colocalization of the AtLTP4.4:GFP protein and the chloroplasts was evident by the yellow signal (CITATION). (A) Confocal microscopy analysis of line #16 expressing AtLTP4.4:GFP showing expression in the cell wall/apoplast, (B) possibly in the ER, and (C) chloroplasts (D) 35S:GFP (Col-0) control. We previously showed that trichothecenes induce mitochondrial ROS accumulation in yeast and exogenous addition of antioxidants alleviate growth inhibition by trichothecenes, indicating that toxicity of trichothecenes is at least partially a consequence of increased ROS production [CITATION]. To determine if Tcin treatment induces ROS in Arabidopsis, wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0) leaves infiltrated with Tcin for 24 h and then were stained with 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H2DCF-DA), a non-fluorescent, cell permeable dye, which is retained intracellularly following cleavage by esterases and is converted to the highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) when oxidized by ROS. Confocal microscopy analysis of the mock treatment (CITATION) revealed very light staining without highlighting any particular structure. The 8 μM Tcin treatment showed that DCF stain colocalized with chloroplasts, the cell wall, and possibly the apoplast (CITATION). Increasing the dosage of Tcin to 24 μM (~8 mg/L) intensified the DCF staining of chloroplasts (CITATION) relative to the mock treatment. Similar results were obtained when tobacco leaves were treated with DON. The mock treatment revealed very light staining without highlighting any particular structure in tobacco (CITATION). The 24 hour treatment of tobacco leaves with 10 μM DON (2.96 mg/L) revealed colocalization of DCF fluorescence with chloroplasts (CITATION). Increasing the concentration of DON to 240 μM intensified the staining of chloroplasts (CITATION). Disorganized chlorophyll autofluorescence was detected in leaf tissues treated with 240 μM DON (71 mg/L) for 24h (CITATION). Similarly, 2h treatment with 600 nM paraquat (methyl viologen) (154 μg/L) led to oxidative damage of chloroplast membranes and ultimately to bursting of the chloroplast (CITATION). Confocal microscopy analysis of ROS accumulation in wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0) leaves infiltrated with Tcin and the cell-permeable fluorogenic probe 2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) after 24 h. (A,B) Mock treatment with buffer, (C,D) treatment with 8 μM Tcin (E,F) treatment with 24 μM Tcin. (G) Intact leaf assay to quantify H2O2 levels in transgenic Arabidopsis lines #7 and #16 overexpressing AtLTP4.4 using Amplex Red. Treatment with 4 μM Tcin for 24 h induced H2O2 accumulation in the vector control (35S:GFP), but not in lines #16 and #7. Error bars indicate S.E where n = 3 independent replicates. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, ***P<0.001. We investigated if treatment of wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0) leaves with antioxidants would protect against Tcin, Arabidopsis leaves were treated with 8 μM Tcin in the presence of 2 mM vitamin C, vitamin E, or para-amino benzoic acid (PABA). Treatment with antioxidants partially protected against the bleaching effects of Tcin (CITATION). Incubation of Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings with liquid MS media containing Tcin revealed photobleaching after 16 h light/8 h dark treatment (CITATION). In contrast, continuous dark treatment provided protection from photobleaching caused by Tcin (CITATION). These results showed that Tcin treatment induces ROS accumulation in Arabidopsis and provided evidence that ROS accumulation and light play a role in Tcin-mediated tissue damage. To determine if Tcin treatment leads to ROS accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing AtLTP4.4, intact leaves from 35S:GFP control plants and from AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines #7 and #16 were exposed to 0 (mock) and 4 μM Tcin, incubated for 24 h and H2O2 levels were quantified with Amplex Red Ultra (Molecular Probes). A significant increase in H2O2 was observed when the 35S:GFP control line was treated with 4 μM Tcin relative to the mock treatment (CITATION). In contrast, H2O2 level did not increase when AtLTP4.4 overexpressing lines were treated with 4 μM Tcin. The H2O2 level in lines #7 and #16 was significantly lower relative to the control line (35S:GFP) after exposure to 4 μM Tcin. These results indicate that overexpression of AtLTP4.4 attenuates Tcin-induced ROS accumulation. To determine if nsLTP overexpression provided resistance to trichothecenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast cells overexpressing AtLTP4.4 or AtLTP4.5 were grown on increasing concentrations of type A (T-2 and DAS) or type B (Tcin and DON) trichothecenes and average IC50 values were determined (CITATION). The IC50 of yeast expressing AtLTP4.4 was significantly higher relative to cells carrying the empty vector (VC) when grown on T-2 toxin, DAS, Tcin or DON, while yeast expressing AtLTP4.5 showed significant resistance to only T-2 toxin (CITATION). To determine if the ability to confer Tcin resistance is specific to AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5, we investigated whether At2g15050 (AtLTP1.1), which belongs to type I group [CITATION], mediates resistance to Tcin. The IC50 of yeast expressing AtLTP1.1 for Tcin was similar to the vector control, indicating that AtLTP1.1 did not protect yeast against Tcin (CITATION). We previously showed that treatment with type A (T-2 and DAS) and type B (Tcin and DON) trichothecenes caused a dose-dependent increase in ROS production in yeast [CITATION]. These findings prompted us to explore ROS generation in nsLTP expressing yeast treated with trichothecenes. ROS levels were measured using the ROS-sensitive stain DCFH-DA, which only fluoresces upon contact with ROS. While 13% of the untreated vector control cells stained positive for ROS, this increased to 43–45% with T-2, 24–32% with DAS, 39–47% with Tcin and 26–30% with DON treatment (CITATION). Basal ROS levels were lower in AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 overexpressing cells relative to the vector control across the eight different trichothecene treatments (CITATION). ROS positive cells dropped to 26–32% upon T-2 treatment, 8–15% upon DAS treatment, 23–32% upon Tcin treatment and 8–19% upon DON treatment in yeast overexpressing Arabidopsis nsLTPs (CITATION). These results demonstrate that ROS generation triggered by trichothecenes is attenuated when Arabidopsis nsLTPs are expressed in yeast. (A) Trichothecene treated or untreated wild type yeast (BY4743) cells carrying the empty vector, overexpressing AtLTP4.4, or overexpressing AtLTP4.5 were stained for ROS using DCHF and analyzed by flow cytometry. ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (B) GSH and GSSG levels were quantified relative to vector control and normalized to total protein in yeast expressing AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 after 3 hour galactose induction. ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Glutathione is a major antioxidant within cells and is known to play a key role in the maintenance of the redox status and the protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying H2O2 [CITATION]. As shown in CITATION, addition of 1 mM cysteine or 250 μM GSH did not have an effect on germination percentage of 35S:GFP control line in the absence of 3 μM Tcin, but significantly enhanced germination percentage of 35S:GFP line in the presence of the toxin relative to 35S:GFP line treated with Tcin alone. Addition of 1 mM cysteine, which is a component of GSH, has been reported to increase the GSH content of Arabidopsis by ~3.6-fold [CITATION]. To determine if GSH is an essential mediator of resistance to Tcin, we explored the relationship between GSH levels and trichothecene sensitivity. Germination of wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0) was examined on plates containing buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent inhibitor of GSH synthesis, which causes GSH depletion [CITATION]. BSO treatment significantly enhanced the sensitivity of wild type Arabidopsis to a low dose (2 μM) of Tcin, which did not affect sensitivity in the absence of BSO (CITATION). These results suggested that preventing GSH depletion would lead to protection against Tcin. (A) Germination of 35S:GFP seedlings using media supplemented with 1 mM cysteine (Cys) or 250 μM glutathione (GSH) and 3 μM Tcin. Comparison of the effect of the addition of cys and GSH with Tcin to the Tcin treatment alone using ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, ***P<0.001. (B) Germination assay of 35S:GFP seedlings on media supplemented with 250 μM buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and 2 μM Tcin. Unlike 3 μM Tcin which substantially reduces the germination percentage, 2 μM Tcin did not impact germination percentage. Comparison of the effect of BSO treatment on Tcin treated or untreated samples using ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, **P < 0.01. (C) GSH and GSSG levels of mature leaves from AtLTP4.4 overexpressing line #16 and 35S:GFP control (3 biological replicates each). ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests, *P < 0.05. (D) GSH1 expression in lines overexpressing AtLTP4.4 relative to 35S:GFP line by qRT-PCR. We examined the effect of AtLTP4.4 overexpression on the glutathione level in transgenic plants by measuring the GSH and GSSG content of leaves from line #16 using the GSH-Glo Glutathione Assay kit (Promega). Overexpression of AtLTP4.4 resulted in a significant (2.9-fold) increase in reduced glutathione (GSH) and a 2.1-increase in glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in line #16 compared to the vector control (CITATION). Total GSH content was significantly higher (2.6-fold) in line #16 relative to the vector control (CITATION). To determine if GSH biosynthesis is increased in transgenic plants, we examined the expression of GSH1, which encodes glutamate-cysteine ligase, an enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of glutathione biosynthesis in the chloroplast. GSH1 expression was not significantly higher in transgenic lines #7 and #16 overexpressing AtLTP4.4 (CITATION), suggesting that the increase in GSH level was not due to the overexpression of GSH1. To determine if overexpression of Arabidopsis nsLTPs affected the GSH level in yeast, the GSH and GSSG content of yeast cells expressing AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 was analyzed using the GSH-Glo Glutathione Assay kit (Promega). Reduced GSH level was significantly higher in yeast expressing AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 (CITATION). However, yeast expressing only AtLTP4.4 showed a significant increase in the GSSG level and in the total GSH level relative to yeast harboring the vector, but not yeast expressing AtLTP4.5 (CITATION). These results demonstrated that the increase observed in the total glutathione content in the AtLTP4.4 overexpressing Arabidopsis line translated to yeast.
!~MM~! The activation tagged Arabidopsis thaliana lines in Columbia (Col-0) background were generated by Agrobacterium transformation with the pSKI015 plasmid containing the modified T-DNA vector, which contains four copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S enhancer [CITATION], and were a kind gift from Dr. Brian Gregory. In vitro germination assays on solid media in petri plates (150 mM) were used to screen for mutants resistant to the toxin. The plates contained 1X Murashige and Skoog (Gamborg Modified) Basal Media (2.5 g/L) (Sigma M0404), 50 mM Ferric EDTA, and 0.6% Phytagel (Sigma P8169) and 4 μM Tcin. Resistance was scored 30 days after seeding the plates. Resistant mutants were planted in MetroMix 360 potting soil (Sun Gro Horticulture), and grown to maturity in a growth chamber maintained at 22°C (16 h light/8 hour dark). The trr1 was characterized by thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR [CITATION]. The amplified band was sequenced and the genomic location of the insert was mapped using T-DNA express (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress). The AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 coding DNA sequence (CDS) without the stop codon were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate NT1618 and NT1619, respectively. AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP4.5 without the stop codon were cloned into the binary vector pEarleyGate 103 (BAR-35S-Gateway-GFP-His tag-OCS 3')[CITATION] to generate NT1620 and NT1621, respectively. Agrobacterium (GV3101 MP90 strain) containing NT1620 and NT1621 was used to transform Arabidopsis [CITATION]. Transformed seedlings were identified by plating out on MS agar media containing BASTA (25 μg/mL). Tcin, DAS, T-2, and DON were isolated and prepared as described previously [CITATION,CITATION]. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR Green was used to quantify expression of genes in trr1. AtLTP4.4 expression was determined in the vector control, overexpression lines, and a knockout line (SALK_207859c, Col-0), which was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GSH1, AT4G23100) expression was measured from mature leaf tissue collected from the vector control and overexpression lines. The Comparative Ct method (∆∆Ct) method was used to quantity gene expression using Actin8 for normalization relative to the Col-0 control. Fluorescence of the lower epidermis of tobacco leaf discs was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA) two to three days after infiltration with AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP. GFP and chlorophyll were excited with a 488-nm argon laser and fluorescence was detected using 495–570 nm and 650–760 nm bandpass filters, respectively. Image data were analyzed using the ZEN 2010 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Leaves from stably transformed Arabidopsis lines were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope as described above for the transient expression analysis in tobacco. Yeast strain BY4743 (MATa/α, his3Δ1/his3Δ1, leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0, LYS2/lys2Δ0, met15Δ0/MET15, ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) was used as the background for all experiments. Gateway entry vector pDONR221 was purchased from Invitrogen while the destination vector pAG425-GAL1-ccdB-HA (plasmid# 14249) was purchased from Addgene (www.addgene.com). Standard gateway cloning procedure was followed to clone AtLTP4.4 and AtLTP 4.5 genes into the destination vector, pAG425-GAL1-ccdB-HA to generate NT1754 and NT1755, respectively. The quantification of H2O2 in leaf extracts was performed using Amplex Red Ultra (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence was measured with the BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader (excitation 530 nm, emission 590 nm). The concentration of H2O2 in each sample was calculated using a standard curve. The standard curve was linear to at least 10 μM H2O2. ROS was visualized in leaf tissue by infiltrating the cell permeable fluorescent probe 2′-7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) using vacuum infiltration. Leaf disks were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA) as described above. Treated and untreated yeast cells were stained with 2',7'-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) for ROS generation. Cells were analyzed using the Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (Accuri Cytometers Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously [CITATION]. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels were determined using the GSH-Glo Glutathione Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, leaf tissue was quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in an eppendorf tube in 250 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM EDTA. The protein content of the lysate was determined by the Bradford assay. The lysate was diluted to ~0.05 mg/mL and a 15 μL aliquot was added to two adjacent wells in a 384-well white plate. To one well 1 mM TCEP was added to determine total (GSH and GSSG) glutathione concentration. 15 μl of GSH-Glo Reagent (Luciferin-NT and Glutathione S-Transferase added at a 1/100 ratio to GSH-Glo Reaction Buffer) was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes. 15 μl reconstituted Luciferin detection reagent was then added and the sample was incubated for 15 minutes. Luminescence was determined using the BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader and glutathione levels were established by comparing data to a standard curve. For GSH/GSSH quantification for yeast, cultures were spun down, supernatant removed, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The yeast pellet was resuspended in 250 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM EDTA and the cells were broken using glass beads with the MiniBeadBeater (Biospec Products). The protein content of the lysate was determined via UV absorbance using the BioTek Synergy4 spectrophotometer with the Take3 plate. The lysate was diluted to ~0.05 mg/mL concentration of protein and analyzed as described for the plant samples. The data are shown as means ± SEM and analyzed, where indicated, either by performing t-tests or by ANOVA using the Bonferroni algorithm to test differences between individual treatments. Origin 2015 (OriginLab) software was used for both graphing and for the statistical analysis.
