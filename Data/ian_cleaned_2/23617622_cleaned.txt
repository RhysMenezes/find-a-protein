!~ABS~! SNF1-related protein kinase–1 (SnRK1), the plant kinase homolog of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), is a sensor that maintains cellular energy homeostasis via control of anabolism/catabolism balance. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of p27KIP1 affects cell-cycle progression, autophagy and apoptosis. Here, we show that SnRK1 phosphorylates the Arabidopsis thaliana cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 homologs AtKRP6 and AtKRP7, thus extending the role of this kinase to regulation of cell-cycle progression. AtKRP6 and 7 were phosphorylated in vitro by a recombinant activated catalytic subunit of SnRK1 (AtSnRK1α1). Tandem mass spectrometry and site-specific mutagenesis identified Thr152 and Thr151 as the phosphorylated residues on AtKRP6- and AtKRP7, respectively. AtSnRK1 physically interacts with AtKRP6 in the nucleus of transformed BY–2 tobacco protoplasts, but, in contrast to mammals, the AtKRP6 Thr152 phosphorylation state alone did not modify its nuclear localization. Using a heterologous yeast system, consisting of a cdc28 yeast mutant complemented by A. thaliana CDKA;1, cell proliferation was shown to be abolished by AtKRP6WT and by the non-phosphorylatable form AtKRP6T152A, but not by the phosphorylation-mimetic form AtKRP6T152D. Moreover, A. thaliana SnRK1α1/KRP6 double over-expressor plants showed an attenuated AtKRP6-associated phenotype (strongly serrated leaves and inability to undergo callogenesis). Furthermore, this severe phenotype was not observed in AtKRP6T152D over-expressor plants. Overall, these results establish that the energy sensor AtSnRK1 plays a cardinal role in the control of cell proliferation in A. thaliana plants through inhibition of AtKRP6 biological function by phosphorylation.
!~RES~! The A. thaliana genome encodes seven cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 homologs (AtKRP1–7) identified on the basis of the presence of a short domain that is partially shared with mammalian cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and is involved in the interaction with CDK/cyclin complexes. However, this domain is located at the C–terminus of plant proteins but the N–terminus of mammalian proteins (Figure 1a). Furthermore, although the amino acid similarity is restricted to this short domain, all of these proteins belong to the intrinsically disordered protein family. The folding index profile of AtKRP6 and AtKRP7 was determined using the FoldIndex© prediction tool (Prilusky et al., CITATION). As shown in Figure 1(b), AtKRP6 and AtKRP7 have a highly negative folding index profile, similar to their animal counterpart p27KIP1. Indeed, using the same prediction tool, while SnRK1 and CDKA;1 were shown to contain only 29 and 33% of protein residues that are predicted to be disordered, this proportion reached 77, 78 and 91% for AtKRP6, AtKRP7 and p27KIP1, respectively. [[FIGURE]] An in silico analysis using Scan Prosite (de Castro et al., CITATION) allowed detection of potential SnRK1 consensus phosphorylation sites in several AtKRP proteins. We focused on AtKRP6 and AtKRP7, the only family members that displayed a common putative phosphorylation site in the CDK/cyclin interaction domain (Thr152/Thr151 at the N–terminal end of the domain). Interestingly, AtKRP6 also contained a second SnRK1 consensus phosphorylation site at Ser91 (Figure 1a). To investigate whether AtSnRK1 phosphorylates AtKRP6 and AtKRP7 in vitro, glutathione S–transferase (GST)-fused AtKRP6 and AtKRP7 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified (Figure S1). They were used in a reconstituted medium containing recombinant GST–AtSnAK2 (required to phosphorylate and activate AtSnRK1α1; Shen et al., CITATION; Crozet et al., CITATION) and GST–AtSnRK1α1. In the absence of AtKRP, two phosphorylated proteins were observed corresponding to GST–AtSnRK1α1 (upper band, 83 kDa), which is phosphorylated by AtSnAK2, and AtSnAK2 (lower band, 68 kDa), which is both autophosphorylated and feedback-phosphorylated by activated AtSnRK1α1 (Figure 2b, lane 1) as previously shown (Crozet et al., CITATION). Interestingly, when either AtKRP6 or AtKRP7 were present in the reaction mixture, autoradiography showed that both proteins incorporated γ32–phosphate from radiolabelled ATP (Figure 2b, lanes 3 and 5). This phosphorylation was dependent on activated AtSnRK1α1, as AtSnAK2 alone was unable to phosphorylate AtKRP6/7 (Figure 2b, lanes 2 and 4). A tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of in vitro phosphorylated AtKRP6/7 indicated that peptides containing the common consensus SnRK1 target site previously identified in silico (VRKTPT152AAEI in AtKRP6; MEKSPT151QAE in AtKRP7, Figure 1) were phosphorylated (Table 1). The AtKRP7 phosphorylation site was unambiguously identified as Thr151; however, doubt remained regarding AtKRP6 as the peptide contained two closely located threonine residues (Thr150 and Thr152). To resolve this ambiguity, a site-directed mutagenesis strategy was used and the following AtKRP6 mutated forms were produced: AtKRP6T150A, AtKRP6T150D, AtKRP6T152A and AtKRP6T152D (Figure S1). In the reconstituted medium, both the AtKRP6T150A and AtKRP6T150D mutant forms exhibited phosphorylation on Thr152, whereas AtKRP6T152A and AtKRP6T152D did not show Thr150 phosphorylation (Table 1). Thus, clearly, the AtSnRK1-dependent phosphorylation sites on AtKRP6 and AtKRP7 are at Thr152 and Thr151, respectively. To better understand the function of this post-translational modification, it was decided to focus only on AtKRP6. Bold letters indicate residues 150/152 or 151 for KRP6 and KRP7, respectively. [[FIGURE]] In order to investigate this post-translational modification in vivo, we first addressed the question of whether AtSnRK1α1 physically interacts in planta with AtKRP6. After transient expression in BY–2 tobacco protoplasts using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), YFP fluorescence was detected in several protoplasts, demonstrating that AtSnRK1α1 and AtKRP6 are interacting partners in vivo. In addition, this interaction only occurred in the nucleus (Figure 3a,b), in accordance with the known subcellular localizations of AtSnRK1α1 and AtKRP6, which are nucleocytoplasmic and nuclear, respectively (Bird et al., CITATION; Bitrián et al., CITATION). In mammals, p27KIP1 phosphorylation by AMPK on Thr170 induces its cytoplasmic re-localization (Liang et al., CITATION; Short et al., CITATION). To investigate the effect of AtKRP6 phosphorylation on its subcellular localization, chimeric AtKRP6–GFP proteins (containing AtKRP6WT, AtKRP6T152A or AtKRP6T152D) were transiently expressed in A. thaliana protoplasts. Both AtKRP6T152A and AtKRP6T152D showed nuclear localization like the WT form. Thus, it appears that, under our conditions, Thr152 phosphorylation alone does not lead to re-localization of AtKRP6–GFP to the cytoplasm (Figure S2). [[FIGURE]] To assess the biological function of AtKRP6 Thr152 phosphorylation on CDK/cyclin complexes, it was first necessary to investigate whether A. thaliana KRP6 was capable of altering cell division. To this end, a heterologous system in yeast was set up, taking advantage of the ability of A. thaliana CDKA;1 to functionally complement the absence of the unique yeast CDK CDC28. To perform more efficient complementation of the yeast cdc28 mutant, a mutated AtCDKA;1 variant, AtCDKA;1–AF, harbouring Thr14→Ala and Tyr15→Phe mutations to circumvent their potential inhibitory phosphorylation was generated (Porceddu et al., CITATION). Mutated yeast cdc28 cells, which are unable to divide at a restrictive temperature (Figure 4b), were complemented by AtCDKA;1–AF, leading to yeast cell multiplication (Figure 4c). The complemented yeast cells were then transformed with either WT or mutated AtKRP6. Interestingly, AtKRP6WT and AtKRP6T152A appeared to block cell division (Figure 4e,g), thus confirming the inhibitory function of AtKRP6 on cell division. In contrast, the phosphorylation-mimetic form AtKRP6T152D did not alter the complementation process (Figure 4i), strongly suggesting that the phosphorylation event abolishes the AtKRP6 inhibitory effects on AtCDKA;1. In order to unravel the molecular mechanism involved, the interactions of the phosphorylation-mimetic form AtKRP6T152D with CDK and cyclin partners were assessed in a two-hybrid system. It had been established previously by a two-hybrid approach that AtKRP6 interacts with A. thaliana CDKA;1 (De Veylder et al., CITATION). As shown in Figure 5(a), AtKRP6T152D and AtKRP6WT interact to a similar degree with AtCDKA;1–AF, the AtCDKA;1 variant. We then tested the interaction of AtKRP6WT and AtKRP6T152D with a D–type cyclin, the second partner in the CDK/cyclin complex, which was previously shown to be a true partner of AtKRP6 in planta (Van Leene et al., CITATION). Interestingly, the phosphorylation-mimetic form AtKRP6T152D partially lost its ability to interact with its cyclin partner (Figure 5b). Taken together, these results suggest that the inability of the phosphorylation-mimetic form AtKRP6T152D to inhibit CDK kinase activity may be due to loss of its interaction with the cyclin partner of the CDK/cyclin complex. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Finally, experiments were performed to clarify the function of AtKRP6 phosphorylation in A. thaliana. The phenotype of plants constitutively over-expressing AtKRP6 has been described previously (Zhou et al., CITATION; Liu et al., CITATION). Most of the KRP family members over-expressed in A. thaliana display several common features, including rosette size reduction, increased cell size, characteristic leaf serration and a reduced capacity of mesophyll cells to undergo callogenesis (Le Foll et al., CITATION). Here, we first confirmed that AtKRP6 over-expression (OE-AtKRP6WT) induced the same pleiotropic and gradual developmental alterations (Figures 6 and 7a–g). The severity of the phenotype is in agreement with an increase in AtKRP6 transcript levels and also with higher mRNA levels for two D–type cyclins, AtCycD3.1 and AtCycD4.1 (Figure S3). Several phenotypic classes were determined according to leaf serration, namely wt–L for plants displaying a WT-like phenotype, and LS, MS, SS and HS for lightly, moderately, severely and highly serrated phenotypes respectively (Figure 6a,c,d, line OE-AtKRP6WT). This classification of the plant population was validated by analysing several plants from each class using two others parameters: the capacity of mesophyll cells to undergo callogenesis (Figure 6b and Figure S4) and the size of leaf epidermis cells (Figure 7a–g). The ability to produce calli was quantified by weighing the leaf explants to determine the fresh weight increase factor. This factor gradually decreased (Figure 6b and Figure S4) in accordance with the severity of the serration phenotype (Figure 6a), whereas the cell size dramatically increased (Figure 7 and Figure S5). Indeed, the proportion of cells with an area above 10 000 μm2, which is very low (1.5%) in the wt–L plants, reaches 45% in HS plants (Figure 7h and Figure S5). Based on the results mentioned above, we hypothesized that At SnRK1 phosphorylation of AtKRP6 on Thr152 interferes with AtKRP6 function in planta. To assess this, we generated double OE-(AtSnRK1α1/AtKRP6WT) plants (AtKRP6 transcript levels are given in Figure S3; OE-AtSnRK1α1 plants are described by Jossier et al., CITATION). These plants (total n = 253) were classified according to their leaf serration phenotype as described above. We observed that the plants in each class of this population present the same parameters (callogenesis capacity and leaf epidermis cell area) as the plants of the corresponding class in the OE-KRP6WT population (Figure S4 for callogenesis; Figure 7h and Figure S5 for cell size). Interestingly, by comparing the distribution of the plants in the various classes for the two genotypes, we found that AtSnRK1α1 over-expression partially reversed the OE-AtKRP6 phenotype (Figure 6c,d). While the plant population over-expressing AtKRP6WT alone (total n = 343) showed variable severity of the expected developmental alterations with 12.7% classified as wt–L, 44.4% as intermediate phenotype (LS + MS), 21.4% SS and 21.4% HS, the population over-expressing AtKRP6WT together with AtSnRK1α1 displayed a shift towards the WT-like phenotype (21.1% wt–L, 42% LS+MS, 19.8% SS and 17.1% HS) (Figure 6c,d). This shift towards the WT-like phenotype is due to a slight decrease (2–4%) in the proportions of all the other classes. In OE-(AtSnRK1α1/AtKRP6WT) plants, the higher AtSnRK1α1 content allows more AtKRP6 to be phosphorylated, but not all, especially in plants containing the highest amount of AtKRP6. Consequently, OE-AtSnRK1α1 only partially reversed the OE-AtKRP6 effect. To try to get a stronger reversion, plants over-expressing the phosphorylation-mimetic form AtKRP6T152D were produced (total n = 319), and classified as above according to the serration criteria (Figure 6c,d). The same correlation was observed between the classification of plants as wt–L, LS etc. and callogenesis capacity/cell size parameters (Figure 7h and Figures S4 and S5). Remarkably, the proportions of HS and SS plants drastically decreased among the OE-AtKRP6T152D population (0.5% and 8.0%, respectively), while the proportion of wt–L plants reached 40.9% (a 3.2-fold increase compared to the wt–L class of OE-AtKRP6WT) (Figure 6c,d). This result shows a very clear effect on the OE-AtKRP6 phenotype of mimicking the AtKRP6 Thr152 phosphorylation status. Measuring the leaf rosette diameter confirmed this result. Indeed, the population of OE-AtKRP6T152D plants clearly shifted towards the large-rosette phenotype (38.5% of rosettes with a diameter of 40–49 mm; Figure 8). Collectively, these data suggest that AtSnRK1α1 phosphorylates AtKRP6 in planta, and this alters cell proliferation. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Seeds were sown directly on soil, and plants were grown in a culture chamber at 70% relative humidity with a light intensity of 180 μmol m−2 sec−1 and a day/night regime of 8 h at 21°C and 16 h at 18°C, respectively. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia wild-type (Col–0) and OE-AtSnRK1α1 plants (Jossier et al., CITATION) were transformed using the floral-dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION) using the pGREENII–0229 vector (Hellens et al., CITATION) carrying a cassette containing AtKRP6WT or AtKRP6T152D ORFs under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter and the Nos terminator. After a 4-week selection period on sand supplied with glufosinate (7.5 mg L−1), plantlets were transferred to soil and grown in a culture chamber. For each genetic background, three sets of plants were analysed. For OE-AtKRP6WT, OE-(AtSnRK1α1/AtKRP6WT) and OE-AtKRP6T152D, the mean sizes of each set are n = 114, n = 84 and n = 106, respectively. BY–2 protoplasts were obtained and transiently co-transformed as described by Le Foll et al. (CITATION) using plasmids encoding AtKRP6–YFPN (AtKRP6 ORF cloned into the pUC-SPYNE vector; Walter et al., CITATION) and AtSnRK1α1–YFPC (AtSnRK1α1 cloned into the pBiFP4 vector; Desprez et al., CITATION) or YFPC–AtSnRK1α1 (AtSnRK1α1 cloned into the pBiFP3 vector; Desprez et al., CITATION). Negative controls were obtained by co-transformation of plasmids encoding AtKRP6–YFPN and AtSK2.3–YFPC, AtSnRK2.6–YFPC (the AtSK2.3-p43YC and AtSnRK2.6-p43YC plasmids, respectively, kindly provided by S. Filleur, Université Paris 7, Institut des Sciences du Végétal Gif sur Yvette, France) or YFPC alone (pUC-SPYCE vector; Walter et al., CITATION). Protoplasts were incubated for 24 h at 25°C in the dark before confocal microscopic observations. Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts from wild-type Col–0 rosette leaves were produced and transformed as described by Yoo et al. (CITATION). Derivatives of pBi/smGFP (Jasinski et al., CITATION), carrying AtKRP6WT, AtKRP6T152A or AtKRP6T152D ORFs, were used for transient expression. Protoplasts were incubated for 10 h in the dark before confocal microscopic observations. Leaves of 30-day-old plants grown in soil were in vitro cultured as described by Le Foll et al. (CITATION). Prior to observations, the plates were incubated for 21 days at 23°C at 70% relative humidity and a light intensity of 100 μmol m−2 sec−1 under a 16/8 h day/night regime. Callogenesis capacity was quantified by weighing the leaf explants before transfer to callogenesis medium and after the 21-day incubation period. For confocal microscopy, observations were performed using a Leica-Microsystems TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an argon laser. The 488 nm laser line was used for GFP and chlorophyll excitation, and the spectral detector was set between 500 and 535 nm and between 659 and 732 nm, respectively. For YFP excitation, the 415 nm laser line was used, and the spectral detector was set between 520 and 570 nm. For cell size observations, leaf tissues were fixed in an ethanol/acetic acid solution (3:1 v/v) and rinsed in 70% ethanol. Fixed leaf tissues were cleared in a hydrate chloral/glycerol/H2O solution (8:2:1 w/v/v) before observations with a AZ100 macroscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Cell areas were determined using ImageJ 1.62 free software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and an Intuos3 pen tablet (Wacom, Vancouver, WA, USA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg leaf total RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and ImProm–II reverse transcriptase (Promega, Fichtburg, WI, USA), and used as template in PCR reactions with primers 5′-GAGGATCCATGAGCGAGAGAAAGCGAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GAGTCGACAAGTCGATCCCACTTGTAGCGACC-3′ for AtKRP6 (1.5 μl first-strand cDNA, 25 cycles with a 30 sec hybridization step at 49°C and 40 sec of elongation); 5′-GTAGAGAAGAACAGAGCAATTCGTTTC-3′ and 5′-CTGTAAACCGATGCGGTCCACTGGTAG-3′ for AtCycD3.1 (At4g34160) (1.5 μl first-strand cDNA, six cycles with a 30 sec hybridization step at 68°C, reducing by 1°C for each cycle, and 1 min elongation, and 20 cycles with a 30 sec hybridization step at 62°C and 1 min elongation); 5′-ATGGCAGAGGAGAATCTAGAACTGAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAACATAAGTCTGAGCCATCACTC-3′ for AtCycD4.1 (At5g65420) (1.5 μl first-strand cDNA, 25 cycles with a 30 sec hybridization step at 61°C and 1 min elongation); 5′-GCGAAGAAGATCAAGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GGTTAGTTGAACCCTCCTTG-3′ for AtTCTP (translationally controlled tumour protein, At3g16640) used as a constitutive control (1.5 μl first-strand cDNA, 25 cycles with a 30 sec hybridization step at 60°C and 20 sec of elongation). The fusion constructs used to produce N–terminally GST-tagged A. thaliana SnAK2 and SnRK1α1 proteins have been described previously (Crozet et al., CITATION). The coding sequences of KRP6 and KRP7 were reverse-transcribed from A. thaliana total RNA, and the resulting PCR-amplified cDNAs were inserted into the pDEST15 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described for AtSnAK2 and AtSnRK1α1 (Crozet et al., CITATION). KRP6 variant forms were generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis as described by Reikofski and Tao (CITATION), and inserted into pDEST15. GST–AtSnAK2 and GST–AtSnRK1α1 recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli and purified by glutathione–Sepharose 4B affinity gel (Sigma, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) chromatography as described by Crozet et al. (CITATION) Slight modifications were applied for GST–AtKRP6/7 expression. Escherichia coli were cultured at 37°C and induced with 500 μm isopropyl thio-β–d–galactoside at OD600 nm = 0.9 for 1.5 h. Production of recombinant proteins was validated by Western blot analyses using 10 μl ml−1 anti-GST antibodies (Calbiochem, Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 0.5 μl ml−1 horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Enhanced chemoluminescence (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was performed to detect GST-containing proteins. Kinase activity was measured in the presence of 2 μCi [γ–32P]ATP (500 μCi mmol−1) in a kinase activity buffer containing 0.1 m HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 μm (for radioactive assays) or 1 mm (for mass spectrometry analyses) ATP, 3 μg recombinant GST–AtSnRK1α1, 2 μg recombinant GST–AtSnAK2 and 2 μg of either GST–AtKRP6WT, GST–AtKRP6T150A, GST–AtKRP6T150D, GST–AtKRP6T152A or GST–AtKRP6T152D purified extract, 1‰ v/v anti-protease mixture (P9599; Sigma); 1‰ v/v of each anti-phosphatase mixture (P2850 and P5726; Sigma), at 30°C in a total volume of 30 μl. Following a 3 h incubation at 30°C, the proteins were dissociated in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide) as described by Laemmli (CITATION). Radioactive bands were revealed using a phosphor screen and Personal Molecular Imager FX system (Bio–Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). In-gel digestion was performed using the ProGest system (Genomic Solutions Ltd., Huntingdon, UK) according to a standard trypsin protocol and as described by Martin et al. (CITATION). HPLC was performed on a NanoLC-Ultra system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA, USA) as described by Zhang et al. (CITATION) with slight modifications. The pre-column cartridge was a PepMap 100 C18 column (5 μm particle size, 300 μm internal diameter, 50 mm length; Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the separating column was a C18 Biosphere column (3 μm size particle, 75 μm internal diameter, 150 mm length; Nanoseparations, Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands). Eluted peptides were analysed online using a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a nanoelectrospray interface. Ionization (1.8 kV ionization potential) was performed using stainless steel emitters (30 μm internal diameter; Thermo Electron, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptide ions were analysed using Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the following data-dependent acquisition steps: (1) full MS scan (mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 400–1400, resolution 70 000) and (2) MS/MS (normalized collision energy 30%, resolution 17 500). Step 2 was repeated for the five major ions detected in step 1. Dynamic exclusion was set to 40 sec. A database search was performed using XTandem version 2011.12.01.1 (http://www.thegpm.org/TANDEM/). Enzymatic cleavage was set as a trypsin digestion with one possible mis-cleavage. Cys carboxyamidomethylation and Met oxidation were set to static and possible modifications, respectively. The precursor mass was 100 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.02 Da. A refinement search was added with similar parameters except that semi-trypsic peptide, possible N–terminal protein acetylation and phosphorylation of serine threonine or tyrosine were searched. The UniprotKB database (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/integr8/last_release/) restricted to yeast, the modified sequence of KRP proteins, and a contaminant database (trypsin, keratins, etc.) were used. Only peptides with an E–value less than 0.1 were reported. Identified proteins were filtered and grouped using X!TandemPipeline (http://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/xtandempipeline/) as described by Zhang et al. (CITATION). In cases of identification of mutated AtKRP6 and phosphorylation sites, similarity between the experimental and the theoretical MS/MS spectra was visually checked. To take redundancy into account, proteins with at least one peptide in common were grouped. This allowed grouping of proteins of similar function. Within each group, proteins with at least one specific peptide relative to other members of the group were reported as sub-groups. AtKRP6WT, AtKRP6T152A and AtKRP6T152D ORFs were cloned into pNSG1 (vector made in our lab), a derivative of pGBT9 (Clontech, Takara, Tokyo, Japan) lacking the binding domain encoding sequence. The ORF of AtCDKA;1-AF, a dominant positive allele of AtCDKA;1 carrying two mutations (Thr14→Ala and Tyr15→Phe), was cloned into pNSG2 (vector made in our lab), a derivative of pGAD424 (Clontech, Takara, Tokyo, Japan) lacking the activation domain encoding sequence. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC28 ORF cloned into YEp13 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) was used as a positive control. Plasmids were co-transformed into the S. cerevisiae cdc28–4 thermosensitive mutant strain Ely227 (Barral et al., CITATION). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described by Jasinski et al. (CITATION). AtKRP6WT and AtKRP6T152D ORFs were cloned into pGBT9 (binding domain (BD) vector, Clontech, Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and AtCDKA;1-AF and AtCycD3;1 ORFs were cloned into pGAD424 (activation domain (AD) vector, Clontech, Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Various AD+BD combinations were co-transformed into the S. cerevisiae PJ69 strain (James et al., CITATION).
