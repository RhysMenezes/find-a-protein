!~ABS~! Under saline conditions, higher plants restrict the accumulation of chloride ions (Cl–) in the shoot by regulating their transfer from the root symplast into the xylem-associated apoplast. To identify molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon, we undertook a transcriptional screen of salt stressed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. Microarrays, quantitative RT-PCR, and promoter-GUS fusions identified a candidate gene involved in Cl– xylem loading from the Nitrate transporter 1/Peptide Transporter family (NPF2.4). This gene was highly expressed in the root stele compared to the cortex, and its expression decreased after exposure to NaCl or abscisic acid. NPF2.4 fused to fluorescent proteins, expressed either transiently or stably, was targeted to the plasma membrane. Electrophysiological analysis of NPF2.4 in Xenopus laevis oocytes suggested that NPF2.4 catalyzed passive Cl– efflux out of cells and was much less permeable to NO3−. Shoot Cl– accumulation was decreased following NPF2.4 artificial microRNA knockdown, whereas it was increased by overexpression of NPF2.4. Taken together, these results suggest that NPF2.4 is involved in long-distance transport of Cl– in plants, playing a role in the loading and the regulation of Cl– loading into the xylem of Arabidopsis roots during salinity stress.
!~RES~! Based on accumulated physiological evidence, it was hypothesized that the rate-limiting step of Cl– loading to the shoot is in the root stele and is ultimately regulated by transcription of genes encoding Cl– transporters (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Previously, a comparative transcriptomic analysis of pericycle and cortical cells in the root of Arabidopsis in response to salt (50 mm NaCl for 2 d) had been conducted using fluorescent-activated cell sorting and Affymetrix microarrays (CITATION; CITATION). The data were subsequently reanalyzed to identify stelar-expressed genes that were likely to encode membrane bound anion permeable transport proteins that had their expression reduced by salt stress. Two candidates were identified that satisfied these criteria from this preliminary screen: the known H+/NO3– symporter (AtNRT1.5/NPF7.3, At1g32450), which regulates NO3– transfer to Arabidopsis shoots (CITATION), and an uncharacterized gene, At3g45700/NPF2.4, which was annotated as a proton-dependent oligo-peptide transporter. We prioritized the uncharacterized gene for further study. NPF2.4 was preferentially expressed in the stele compared to the cortex (log2 fold change [pericycle versus cortex] = 1.76) and was down-regulated by salt (log2 fold change 0 mm versus 50 mm = −1.37). A search of the Gene Expression Omnibus Profiles database (Barrett et al., 2013) revealed that NPF2.4 was rapidly down-regulated in the root after exposure to salt in other studies (Gene Expression Omnibus accession GDS3216). NPF2.4 belongs to the NITRATE EXCRETION TRANSPORTER (NAXT) subfamily of the Nitrate Transporter 1/Peptide Transporter (NRT1/PTR) family (NPF) in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The NAXT subfamily consists of seven genes (At3g45650, At3g45660, At3g45680, At3g45690, At3g45700, At3g45710, and At3g45720), which are clustered on chromosome 3 (Fig. 1; CITATION). The NAXT subfamily was so named after the properties of NAXT1/NPF2.7 (At3g45650), a NO3– transporter in root cortical cells involved in NO3– excretion from the root (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] The candidate gene NPF2.4 harbors four exons and three introns and is predicted to encode a 548-amino acid protein, consisting of 12 transmembrane α-helices with a hydrophilic loop between transmembrane α-helices 6 and 7 (Fig. 2). The protein sequence of NPF2.4 was found to have a 64% identity and a 78% similarity to NAXT1/NPF2.7 and a 76% identity and a 85% similarity to NPF2.3, a NO3– selective xylem loader in Arabidopsis root (CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S1). [[FIGURE]] A three-dimensional (3D) molecular model of NPF2.4 was constructed using crystal structures of a proton-dependent oligo-peptide transporter from Shewanella oneidensis (PDB accession 2XUT; Fig. 2A; CITATION) and a structure of the NRT1.1/NPF6.3 H+/NO3– transporter from Arabidopsis in complex with a NO3– ion (Fig. 2B; CITATION). The putative 3D structure of NPF2.4 derived through use of both structural templates indicated the presence of a central cavity, which was common to both structural templates (Fig. 2C). The presence of Cl– ions could be simulated, and several residues, including Tyr-37, Val-141, Asn-67, and Met-334, were identified in NPF2.4 as important in forming a potential cavity essential for anion transport activity (Fig. 2D). This provides an additional basis for further study of NPF2.4 as a candidate for transporting Cl– between roots and shoots. Expression profiling by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that both NaCl and ABA treatment significantly reduced the transcript abundance of NPF2.4. The reduction in gene expression was found to be concentration dependent, with 100 mm NaCl treatment reducing NPF2.4 transcript abundance more than 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 3A). When treated with 75 mm NaCl for 5 d, the abundance of NPF2.4 mRNA in the roots was significantly reduced by almost 90% when compared with untreated plants (2 mm NaCl; Fig. 3B). Exposure to 20 µM ABA for 4 or 16 h significantly reduced NPF2.4 transcripts in the roots, with the reduction increasing over the time of the assay (Fig. 3C). [[FIGURE]] To examine the localization of NPF2.4 expression, 1.5 kb of the putative promoter sequence of NPF2.4 (proNPF2.4) was used to drive the expression of the UidA reporter gene (Fig. 4). Compared to nontransformed Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants (Fig. 4A), proNPF2.4-driven GUS activity was detected in the cells associated with the root vascular bundle in both primary and lateral roots of plants transformed with proNPF2.4:UidA (Fig. 4, B–D). GUS activity was also detectible in the vascular cells of both cotyledons and true leaves (Fig. 4, E and F). Transverse sections of 10-d-old proNPF2.4:UidA-expressing roots further demonstrated GUS activity in the root stelar cells (Fig. 4G). ProNPF2.4-driven GUS activity was also detected in flower and developing siliques (Fig. 4, H and I). [[FIGURE]] To investigate the responsiveness of the NPF2.4 promoter to salt stress, proNPF2.4:UidA plants were treated with 75 or 150 mm NaCl for 5 d on Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates. A reduction in the intensity of proNPF2.4-associated GUS activity was observed in response to salt treatments. A fluorescence-based 4-methylumelliferyl-β-galactopyranoside (MUG) assay quantified that proNPF2.4:UidA plants treated with 75 or 150 mm NaCl for 5 d had approximately 70% and 30% GUS activity, respectively, when compared with 0 mm NaCl grown plants (Fig. 5). [[FIGURE]] The 1.5-kb putative promoter region of NPF2.4 was compared with the entries of the plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE). Multiple copies of binding sites that are targets of transcription factors belonging to ABA signal transduction pathways were identified (Supplemental Table S1). To determine the subcellular localization of NPF2.4, Col-0 plants were stably transformed with GFP fused to the 3′-end of NPF2.4. GFP was detected on the periphery of root cells in the 10-d-old transgenic plants (Fig. 6A). After plasmolysis was performed to detach the plasma membrane from the cell wall, fluorescence was detected on Hechtian strands (Fig. 6B). To further verify the NPF2.4 localization, YFP was fused to the 5′-end of NPF2.4 and transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Figure 6, C to F, shows that NPF2.4-associated YFP fluorescence overlapped with the CFP fluorescence of the plasma membrane marker ECFP::Rop11 (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To test whether NPF2.4 was able to facilitate Cl– transport, two-electrode voltage clamping of X. laevis oocytes injected with NPF2.4-cRNA was performed. When the plasma membrane of NPF2.4-cRNA injected oocytes was clamped at a negative membrane potential (i.e. that common to plant cells), an inward current was induced in the presence of external Cl–, which was consistent with the efflux of anions from the oocytes into the extracellular medium through NPF2.4 (Fig. 7A; Supplemental Fig. S2A). To examine whether Cl– transport activity of NPF2.4 was affected by H+ concentration (as suggested by the original annotation of NPF2.4 as a proton-dependent oligo-peptide transporter), oocytes were incubated in 50 mm Cl– at pH values of either 7.5 or 5.5. No pH dependency of the inward current was observed (Fig. 7B; Supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). The magnitude of inward current carried by NO3– and Cl– was compared in NPF2.4-injected oocytes and controls, and it was shown that negative currents were much larger and conductance was higher when Cl– was the external anion, rather than NO3– (Fig. 7, C and D; Supplemental Fig. S2, D–G); the PCl–/PNO3– permeability ratio of NPF2.4 was calculated to be 4.4 ± 0.8 (with either 50 mm NaCl or NaNO3 in the bathing solution). To distinguish whether the observed inward currents at negative membrane potentials were associated with movements of Cl– or Na+, oocytes preinjected with NPF2.4-cRNA or water were incubated in the solutions having a constant concentration of Na+ (45 mm) with increasing concentrations of Cl– (0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mm), and the inward currents observed were larger when increased Cl– concentration in the external solution (Fig. 7E; Supplemental Fig. S2, H and I). When using solutions that have a constant concentration of Cl– (45 mm) with increasing concentrations of Na+ (0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mm), similar association between external Na+ concentrations and the size of inward currents was observed (Fig. 7F; Supplemental Fig. S2, J and K). The effect of different cations on the stimulation of Cl–-carrying currents was examined and found not to be Na+ specific; K+ also stimulated Cl–-carrying currents, whereas N-Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG+), Ca2+, and Mg2+ did not (Fig. 7G; Supplemental Fig. S2L). When Na+ was present in the absence of Cl–, no detectible currents were observed (Fig. 7, A and G; Supplemental Fig. S2L). To test if Na+ is only activating the transport of Cl– by NPF2.4, not being cotransported with Cl–, elemental content of Cl–, Na+, and K+ was measured in both NPF2.4-cRNA- and water-injected oocytes incubated in Ca2+ ringer solution for 2 d with and without a 2-h low NaCl treatment. NPF2.4-cRNA injected oocytes had a significantly lower (P < 0.001) Cl– level compared with water-injected controls. No significant difference was observed in Na+ content or K+ content between NPF2.4-cRNA injected oocytes and water-injected controls (Fig. 7H). To test whether the observed outward currents at positive membrane potentials (Fig. 7C) were due to Cl– entering the cell through NPF2.4, a unidirectional 36Cl– influx assay for NPF2.4- and water-injected oocytes was performed by incubation in solutions containing 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm NMDG-Cl spiked with low activities of 36Cl– for 60 min (Fig. 7I). Oocytes injected with NPF2.4-cRNA exhibited significantly greater uptake of 36Cl– than the water-injected oocytes in presence of NaCl. This stimulated influx was not affected by changes in pH values of 7.5 and 5.5 (Fig. 7I). When NaCl was replaced with NMDG-Cl, there was not a significant increase in the uptake of 36Cl– in NPF2.4-cRNA injected oocytes compared to water-injected controls at both pH values tested (Fig. 7I). A unidirectional Na+ uptake assay, using oocytes incubated in 100 mm NaCl solution spiked with 22Na+, confirmed that there was no transmembrane movement of Na+ through NPF2.4 (Supplemental Fig. S2M). [[FIGURE]] Putative Atnpf2.4 T-DNA knockouts were ordered from stock centers, but no plants containing an insert within NPF2.4 and/or lacking NPF2.4 expression could be identified (Supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, to elucidate the function of NPF2.4 in planta, artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) were designed to knock down NPF2.4 expression. These were transformed into Col-0 plants. qRT-PCR showed that T2 amiRNA plants had 50–80% lower transcript abundance of NPF2.4 compared with the null segregants (Fig. 8A). These amiRNA plants were shown to have significantly less Cl– in the shoot when grown under a low salt conditions (2 mm NaCl; 21–32% lower Cl–; Fig. 8B). Meanwhile, shoot NO3– content (Fig. 8C), as well as Na+ and K+ (Supplemental Fig. S4, A and B), remained similar between knockdown lines and null segregants. Under a high salt load (75 mm NaCl), when the endogenous NPF2.4 expression ordinarily decreased in such conditions (Fig. 3B), the transcript abundance of NPF2.4 in the amiRNA knockdown lines and null segregants was at a similar low level (Supplemental Fig. S4C), and no significant difference in shoot Cl– concentration was found (Supplemental Fig. S4D). Transcript levels of NPF2.5, the closest homolog of NPF2.4, were found to be unaffected in the root of NPF2.4 knockdown lines when compared with null segregants (Supplemental Fig. S4E). [[FIGURE]] To investigate the effect of constitutive overexpression of NPF2.4 on shoot Cl– accumulation, NPF2.4 was constitutively overexpressed in Col-0 plants under the control of a 35S promoter. Two independent T3 NPF2.4 overexpression lines were grown for 4 weeks in hydroponics before being exposed to 2 or 75 mm NaCl for 5 d. Greater NPF2.4 mRNA levels were observed in both NPF2.4 overexpression lines as detected by qRT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S5). After the 75 mm NaCl treatment, Cl– accumulation in the shoot was higher in both overexpression lines compared to the null segregants, with OEX-NPF2.4-2 exhibiting a significant increase of 23% (Fig. 9A). At the same time, no significant difference in shoot content of NO3– was found between the transgenic lines and null segregants (Fig. 9B). Small but nonsignificant increases in shoot Cl– accumulation were observed in NPF2.4 overexpression lines grown in 2 mm NaCl (Fig. 9C), while no alternation in shoot content of NO3– was observed (Fig. 9D). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! T-DNA knockout lines (SALK_111056 and SALK_111071), which were annotated with the T-DNA site of insertion being in the NPF2.4 gene, as well as Col-0 Arabidopsis seeds were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was grown in soil prepared following the methods described by CITATION. Plants were kept with light/dark photoperiods of either 16 h/8 h (long-day) or 10 h/14 h (short-day). Temperature was maintained between 21°C and 23°C; humidity was optimized between 60% and 75%; photon irradiance at the level of plant the leaves was approximately 120 μmol m−2 s−1. Arabidopsis plants were germinated and grown in hydroponics following the method described by CITATION. Growth conditions were similar to those for soil-grown plants. At the time of salt application, NaCl solutions of different concentrations as indicated in the text were applied to the growth solution 4 weeks after germination with supplemental Ca2+ added. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR was performed following the method described by CITATION. The primers for determining NPF2.4 expression were 5ʹ-CAGAAGCTAATCCGCAAACC-3ʹ (forward) and 5ʹ-AGGAACCAGCCATAGCACTG-3ʹ (reverse). The selected control genes and data normalizations followed the protocols described by CITATION. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW2. Proteins used in the alignment included characterized Arabidopsis NPFs and seven members of the NAXT subfamily, as shown in the table below. Protein sequences were retrieved from the Arabidopsis genome annotation database release 9 (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated using Mega5, with 5000 bootstrap iterations (CITATION). The 3D models of NPF2.4 were constructed and evaluated as described by CITATION using two structural templates: (1) a proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter from Shewanella oneidensis (CITATION; PDB accession 2XUT) and (2) a NO3– transporter from Arabidopsis in complex with the NO3– ion (CITATION; PDB accession 4OH3). The amino acid sequences of 2XUT (488 residues) and 4OH3 (553 residues, NO3– ion replaced by Cl– ion) were aligned with NPF2.4 (503 and 528 residues) using the Local Meta-Threading Server (CITATION), Alignment Annotator (CITATION), followed by manual alignment adjustments. The aligned sequences were used as input parameters to generate 3D models of NPF2.4 using modeler 9v8 (CITATION) on a Linux station, running the Fedora 12 operating system. Three types of 3D models (using 2XUT or 4OH3 as the templates, the latter with and without Cl–) were selected from 40 models based on their low value of the modeler 9v8 objective function and the most favorable DOPE energy scoring parameters (CITATION). Images of structural models were generated in the PyMol Molecular Graphics System, version 1.3 (Schrödinger LLC). A Web microRNA designer (http://wmd2.weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/mirnatools.pl; CITATION) was used to design two amiRNA constructs to knock down NPF2.4 gene expression. Two 21-bp target sequences were identified from the NPF2.4 coding sequence, allowing the generation of two independent amiRNA constructs. A set of primers (Supplemental Table S2) was used to incorporate the 21-bp amiRNA sequence into the MIR319a vector (CITATION). The amiRNA constructs then were cloned into pCR8 and transferred to pTOOL2 (CITATION) by an LR reaction (Invitrogen) and transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (CITATION; CITATION). cDNA of NPF2.4 was amplified using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) and cloned into Gateway-enabled pCR8 entry vector (Invitrogen). NPF2.4 was transferred from pCR8 to the pTOOL2 destination vector (CITATION) using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) and transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants using Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation (CITATION; CITATION). The primers 5ʹ-TAGAGAAGAAGACTATCATGGG-3ʹ (forward) and 5ʹ-GGAGGTACTTTGACTTGTGTTTGAG-3ʹ (reverse) were used to amplify 1.5 kb of the sequence upstream from the start codon of NPF2.4. This fragment was cloned into pCR8 and transferred by LR reaction into pMDC162 to drive UidA expression. The destination vector was transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants using the Agrobacterium-mediated method (CITATION; CITATION). Two-week-old T2 proNPF2.4:UidA plants were stained for GUS activity for 1 h following the protocol described by CITATION. GUS activity was visualized using a Leica MZ16FA stereo microscope (Leica Microsystems). To prepare transverse sections of roots of proNPF2.4:UidA plants, GUS-stained material was washed with milliQ water and fixed at 4°C overnight using 0.1 m phosphate buffer with 5% glutaraldehyde. Samples were washed twice with 1× PBS for 10 min each and embedded in 1% agarose. Tissue was dehydrated by 15-min incubations in an ethanol series of 50, 70, 90, and 100% (v/v). Samples were transferred to Technovit 7100 hydroxyethyl methacrylate resin solution with 2.5% (v/v) PEG400 and polymerized in thin-walled PCR tubes. Eight-micrometer-thick transverse root sections were cover slipped in DPX mountant and imaged on a Leica ASLMD compound microscope equipped with a DFC480 CCD camera. To test the effect of the salt treatments on GUS activity, proNPF2.4:UidA plants were grown vertically on 0.5× MS media for 7 d before transferred onto 0.5× MS media containing 0, 75, or 150 mm NaCl for a 5-d salt treatment. Salt-treated plants were GUS stained for 1 h and examined under a Leica MZ16FA stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems). A fluorescent MUG assay was performed to quantify the GUS activity of proNPF2.4:UidA plants after the salt treatments following the protocol described by CITATION. To determine the subcellular localization of NPF2.4 in planta, GFP6 was fused to either the 5′- and 3′-end of NPF2.4 and used for constructing GFP::NPF2.4 and NPF2.4::GFP. The coding sequence of NPF2.4 was inserted into the destination vectors pMDC44 and pMDC83 (CITATION) to generate the necessary vectors. The fusion vectors were transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated method (CITATION; CITATION). T2 transgenic plants were geminated on 0.5× MS media under hygromycin selection. Ten days after the germination, plants were stained with 10 µg/mL propidium iodide for 5 min and rinsed with deionized water. Plasmolysis was conducted on a slide by applying 10% (w/v) Suc solution on to the roots of GFP6-expressing plants. GFP (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 505–530 nm) and propidium iodide (PI) (excitation, 543 nm; emission long-pass, 560 nm) fluorescence were visualized using a LSM5 PASCAL laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) running PASCAL imaging software (version 3.2 SP2; Carl Zeiss). To determine the subcellular localization of NPF2.4 in Arabidopsis protoplasts, YFP was fused to the 5ʹ-end of NPF2.4 by cloning the coding sequence of NPF2.4 into the destination vector pattR-YFP (CITATION). A protein known to be targeted to the plasma membrane (ROP11) was used as a positive control (eCFP::ROP11; CITATION). Protoplast isolation from Arabidopsis mesophyll cells and polyethylene glycol-mediated transient transformation were conducted using the protocols described by CITATION to introduce the fusion vector. CFP (excitation, 436 nm; emission, 470–535 nm) and YFP (excitation, 514 nm; emission, 525–610 nm) fluorescence was visualized using a LSM5 PASCAL laser scanning microscope running PASCAL imaging software (version 3.2 SP2). A pGEMHE-DEST destination vector (CITATION) was developed for heterologous expression of NPF2.4 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. cRNA was transcribed from this vector using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer’s instructions and injected into the following (CITATION). Two-electrode voltage clamping was performed following CITATION. Osmolarities of all solutions were adjusted using mannitol (Sigma) to 240–260 mOsmol/kg (Fiske 210 Micro-Sample Osmometer; Advanced Instruments). Membrane currents were recorded in solutions containing 5 mm MES, 2 mm Ca-gluconate ± NMDG-Cl (or NaCl), or NMDG-NO3 (or NaNO3) as indicated. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments). Experiments were repeated using oocytes harvested from different X. laevis surgeries. X. laevis oocytes microinjected with either NPF2.4 cRNA or water were prepared for 36Cl– and 22Na+ uptake. Oocytes were incubated in Cl–-free ND96 media (96 mm sodium isethionate, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1.8 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm magnesium gluconate, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5% gentamycin, pH 7.4) for 120 min 2 d after injection. Oocytes were then incubated in uptake buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca-gluconate, 2 mm K-gluconate, 5 mm MES, and 240 mOsmol kg−1 water, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 µCi/mL of Na36Cl (Radiochemical Centre Limited) or 2 µCi/mL 22NaCl (Perkin-Elmer) for 1 h. The oocytes were washed twice with ice-cold uptake buffer, which did not contain 36Cl– or 22Na+, and each individual oocyte transferred into 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 20 µL of 0.1 m nitric acid and macerated by pipetting or transferred to scintillation vials containing 200 µL of 10% SDS and left overnight. Four milliliters of scintillation fluid was added to each scintillation vial. Radioactivity, counts per minute, of 36Cl– or 22Na+ was measured using a Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer) or a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter. Concentration of Cl–, Na+, K+, and NO3– was determined in the whole shoot of Arabidopsis seedlings. The shoot was weighed, freeze-dried, and ground into a powder. To determine Arabidopsis shoot and X. laevis oocyte Cl– concentrations, approximately 10 to 20 mg of material was digested in 2 mL of 1% nitric acid at 80°C overnight and 10 oocytes were digested in 1 mL of 1% nitric acid at 75°C for 2 h. Cl– content was analyzed using a chloride analyzer (Sherwood Scientific model 926) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The NO3– assay described by CITATION was used for the determination of the NO3– concentration in plant tissue. To examine Na+ and K+ in plants or oocytes, the youngest fully expanded leaf or incubated oocytes were harvested and digested in 1% nitric acid at 80°C overnight for plant tissues or 75°C for 2 h for oocytes following CITATION. Samples were diluted and measured relative to appropriate standard solutions using a model 420 flame photometer (Sherwood Scientific).
