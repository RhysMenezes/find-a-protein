!~ABS~! The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains six genes, AtPMT1 to AtPMT6 (Arabidopsis thaliana POLYOL/MONOSACCHARIDE TRANSPORTER 1–6), which form a distinct subfamily within the large family of more than 50 monosaccharide transporter-like (MST-like) genes. So far, only AtPMT5 [formerly named AtPLT5 (At3g18830)] has been characterized and was shown to be a plasma membrane-localized H+-symporter with broad substrate specificity. The characterization of AtPMT1 (At2g16120) and AtPMT2 (At2g16130), two other, almost identical, members of this transporter subfamily, are presented here. Expression of the AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) revealed that these proteins catalyse the energy-dependent, high-capacity transport of fructose and xylitol, and the transport of several other compounds with lower rates. Expression of their cRNAs in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that both proteins are voltage-dependent and catalyse the symport of their substrates with protons. Fusions of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized to Arabidopsis plasma membranes. Analyses of reporter genes performed with AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 promoter sequences showed expression in mature (AtPMT2) or germinating (AtPMT1) pollen grains, as well as in growing pollen tubes, hydathodes, and young xylem cells (both genes). The expression was confirmed with an anti-AtPMT1/AtPMT2 antiserum (αAtPMT1/2) raised against peptides conserved in AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. The physiological roles of the proteins are discussed and related to plant cell wall modifications.
!~RES~! In silico analyses of the Arabidopsis genome revealed five open reading frames (ORFs) for transporters with significant homology to the previously characterized Arabidopsis plasma membrane polyol transporter AtPMT5 (At3g18830; CITATIONet al., 2005). Two of these genes, AtPMT1 (At2g16120) and AtPMT2 (At2g16130), are located on chromosome 2 with their start ATGs being separated by 6881 nucleotides. Both genes are interrupted by 2 introns, and in both genes these introns are inserted at identical positions (after nucleotides 127 and 474 of the open reading frame) yielding exons that encode identical numbers of amino acids (CITATION). The first of these two introns is conserved in all AtPMT genes, the second only in AtPMT1, AtPMT2, and AtPMT5. The high degree of similarity in the coding regions of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 (93.6% identity on the amino acid level) is conserved also within their intron sequences that are 83.3% (1st intron; 91 bp in AtPMT1 and 94 bp in AtPMT2) and 68.7% identical (2nd intron; 88 bp in AtPMT1 and 92 bp in AtPMT2). Moreover, the first 500 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking sequences share 76.60% identity. Together, these data suggest that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are the result of a gene duplication in the recent history of Arabidopsis evolution. As a result of this high degree of sequence similarity, microarrays do not discriminate between AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 expression. They do show, however, that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are the PMT genes with the lowest expression levels in Arabidopsis (https://www.genevestigator.com/). Comparison of the six Arabidopsis PMT proteins. Schematic alignment of the deduced protein sequences (black bars) of AtPMT1 to AtPMT6 based on the intron positions (arrows) in the respective genes. Grey vertical bars (I–XII) indicate the positions of the predicted transmembrane helices, thin lines show two small gaps in the AtPMT4 sequence. Numbers of amino acids encoded by the different exons are indicated (white). AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs were obtained from whole-plant RNA preparations by RT-PCR. The resulting protein sequences (both 511 amino acids) confirmed predicted protein sequences (GenBank accessions: AtPMT1=NP 179209 and AAD26954; AtPMT2=NP 179210 and AAD26955). The proteins have similar molecular masses and isoelectric points (AtPMT1: 54.76 kDa, isoelectric point=9.72; AtPMT2: 54.93 kDa, isoelectric point=10.12), and these values are in the same range as those of three other AtPMTs (AtPMT3: 54.81 kDa, isoelectric point=10.16; AtPMT5: 58.10 kDa, isoelectric point=10.39; AtPMT6: 52.92 kDa, isoelectric point=9.85). To determine the functional properties of the two transporters, their cDNAs were cloned into the unique NotI site of the yeast expression vector NEV-N (CITATION). Constructs harbouring the cDNAs in sense or antisense orientation [pMV-Y (AtPMT1 sense), pMV-Y-as (AtPMT1 antisense), pYK34 (AtPMT2 sense) and pYK35 (AtPMT2 antisense)] were used to transform yeast strain EBY.VW-4000 (CITATIONet al., 1999) that has no background of monosaccharide transporter activity. The resulting strains were named VMY15 (AtPMT1 sense), VMY21 (AtPMT1 antisense), YKY6 (AtPMT2 sense), and YKY7 (AtPMT2 antisense). In a first approach, VMY15 and YKY6 cells were used for competition analyses. To this end, the transport of 14C-sorbitol was tested first, and as sorbitol was transported by both cell lines, the uptake rates for 14C-sorbitol (0.1 mM) in the presence of several potential competitors, all at a 100-fold molar excess (=10 mM; CITATION) were determined. In both strains, uptake of sorbitol was strongly reduced in the presence of xylitol, several pentoses, inositol, erythritol, inositol, and unlabelled sorbitol, with xylitol being the best competitor in both cases. Fructose was also an excellent competitor of AtPMT1-driven sorbitol uptake; mannitol and several other compounds were only poor or no competitors. This result suggested that, like AtPMT5 and PMT-type transporters from polyol-translocating species, AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are broad-spectrum sugar/polyol transporters with a preference for xylitol and fructose. Functional characterization of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in the monosaccharide transport-deficient yeast strain EBY.VW-4000. (A) AtPMT1-driven (top; strain VMY15) or AtPMT2-driven (bottom; strain YKY6) uptake of 14C-sorbitol (0.1 mM) into transgenic baker's yeast in the presence of different potential competitors that were added at a 100-fold molar excess (n=3; ±SD). (B) Transport of the indicated compounds into AtPMT1-expressing yeast strain VMY15 (open symbols) and into the strain VMY21, that expresses the AtPMT1 cDNA in antisense orientation (closed symbols; n=3; ±SD). (C) Transport of the indicated compounds into AtPMT2-expressing yeast strain YKY6 (open symbols) and into the strain YKY7, that expresses the AtPMT2 cDNA in antisense orientation (closed symbols; n=3; ±SD). (D) pH-dependence (left) and sensitivity to the uncoupler CCCP (right) of AtPMT1 (VMY15) and AtPMT2 (YKY6; n=3; ±SD). Direct transport assays were performed next with a selected set of radiolabelled substrates, including sorbitol, glucose, galactose, fructose, xylose, and xylitol (CITATION, C), ribose and inositol (not shown). All transport tests were performed at an initial substrate concentration of 0.1 mM. Although the maximal transport rates determined for AtPMT2 in YKY6 cells (CITATION) were about 50% lower than those of AtPMT1 in VMY15 cells (CITATION), the relative transport rates were quite similar for both transporters. The relative permeability sequence (xylitol>fructose>sorbitol or glucose>ribose>inositol>xylose>galactose) demonstrated that xylitol and fructose represented the preferred substrates of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. Uptake of the different substrates was also studied in the antisense yeast strains VMY21 and YKY7 (antisense controls are better than untransformed yeast cells, as they carry the same gene defect. Antisense controls are better than empty vector controls as the multicopy sense and antisense plasmids have identical sizes, which excludes that differences result from plasmid copy numbers). The rates determined in these strains were negligible (CITATION, C). pH-dependence and uncoupler-sensitivity of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 appeared similar. Transport rates increased with decreasing pH-values, but the pH-dependence was steeper for AtPMT1 than for AtPMT2 (CITATION). In agreement with this, a strong sensitivity to carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an uncoupler of proton gradients, was found for both transporters. The CCCP effect on AtPMT1 was more pronounced than on AtPMT2 (CITATION). Both sets of experiments suggested that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 function as H+-symporters. When determining the Km-values of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 for their putatively best substrate xylitol, almost identical affinities were obtained, with 0.14±0.02 for AtPMT1 and 0.18±0.01 for AtPMT2 (CITATION). In addition, the Km of AtPMT1 was determined for sorbitol [0.77±0.12 mM (graph not shown)] and the Km of AtPMT2 was determined for glucose [1.25±0.4 mM (graph not shown)]. These results confirm that xylitol is the best substrate of both transporters. Determination of the Km-values for xylitol for AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. Michaelis–Menten-type kinetics for xylitol uptake were determined (A) in AtPMT1-expressing (strain VMY15) and (B) AtPMT2-expressing (strain YKY6) yeast cells. Inserts show Lineweaver–Burke plots of the same data sets (±SD; n=3). Xenopus laevis oocytes had been used for the successful expression of cRNA of the plasma membrane H+-symporter AtPMT5 (CITATIONet al., 2005; CITATIONet al., 2005) and of several other H+-symporters (CITATIONet al., 1993; CITATIONet al., 2006, CITATION). Therefore, this system was used to analyse the putatively electrogenic transport mechanisms of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. Following the injection of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cRNAs into Xenopus oocytes, xylitol-dependent ion currents were monitored. These currents were not affected by K+, Na+ or N-methylglucamine (NMG+) ions in the bath medium (CITATION, C) pointing to protons as the symported ion species. No xylitol-induced currents were detected in water-injected controls (not shown). Characterization of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. (A) AtPMT1-expressing oocytes mediate H+-inward currents in response to xylitol (10 mM) application. The presence of KCl and NaCl (left) or of N-methylglucamine chloride (NMGCl; right) in the external bath solution did not effect the characteristics of xylitol-induced currents. Measurements were recorded at a membrane potential of –60 mV and pH 6.5 (one of nine experiments with identical results). (B) H+-currents elicited by xylitol (10 mM) were recorded at the indicated membrane potentials. The external solution contained 30 mM KCl and 65 mM NaCl and was adjusted to pH 6.5 (one of four experiments with identical results). (C) Experimental design as in (A) but with AtPMT2-expressing oocytes (one of eight experiments with identical results). (D) Same conditions as in (B) but with AtPMT2-expressing oocytes (one of five experiments with identical results). Currents induced by the polyol appeared strongly voltage-dependent. Steps in membrane potentials from 0 mV to –40 mV and –90 mV (CITATION, D) elicited gradually increasing inward currents. Thereby, membrane hyperpolarization increased the electrochemical force for protons to enter the transporter and together with the polyol released the co-transported solutes into the cytoplasm. Together these data demonstrate that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 catalyse the electrogenic, voltage-dependent symport of protons with xylitol. Although the transport activities of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in yeast and Xenopus plasma membranes (CITATION) provided indirect evidence that these proteins might be transporters of the plasma membrane, targeting of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 to other membranes in planta cannot be excluded. To identify the subcellular localization of both transporters in Arabidopsis, the open reading frame (ORF) for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was attached to the 3′-ends of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 cDNAs and the resulting constructs were used for transient expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts or in intact Arabidopsis epidermal cells. All cells transformed with these constructs (pMV-L for AtPMT1-GFP expression; CITATION, B; pYK26 for AtPMT2-GFP expression; CITATION) showed strong and specific labelling of their cell surfaces. Chloroplasts (recognized by their red autofluorescence) are clearly located inside this labelled structure. This localization supports the plasma membrane as the origin of the signal rather than the tonoplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Subcellular localization of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. (A) Subcellular localization of AtPMT1 by transient expression of an AtPMT1-GFP fusion-construct in an Arabidopsis protoplast after chemical transformation. (B) Arabidopsis epidermis cell transformed by particle-bombarded with the AtPMT1-GFP construct. (C) Subcellular localization of AtPMT2 by transient expression of an AtPMT2/GFP fusion construct in an Arabidopsis protoplast after chemical transformation. Arrows show localization of chloroplasts (red autofluorescence of chlorophyll) inside the GFP-labelled plasma membrane. All images show single confocal sections. Bars are 50 μm (A, B), 60 μm (C). For each gene two separate reporter gene constructs with the ORFs of GUS (β-glucuronidase) or GFP were generated. Promoter fragments were obtained from PCR amplifications that introduced HindIII cloning sites at the 5′-ends and NcoI cloning sites at the transcriptional start sites. Promoter/reporter cassettes were generated, inserted into pAF16 (CITATIONet al., 2005), and used to transform Arabidopsis plants. For each construct (pAtPMT1/GFP; pAtPMT1/GUS; pAtPMT2 /GFP; pAtPMT2/GUS) 20–30 transformants were analysed. During the analysis of 30 pAtPMT1/GUS plants, GUS staining was found in the hydathodes and in pollen grains germinating on stylar papillae or on agar medium (CITATION, C) in seven plants. No staining was detected in pollen grains inside the anthers (CITATION) or in released but yet ungerminated pollen grains (CITATION, C). One pAtPMT1/GUS plant showed weak staining in the vasculature of its flower stalks. Analysis of embedded cross-sections showed that this staining resulted from very low GUS activity in the cambium and from slightly stronger GUS activity in young xylem cells (CITATION). GUS stainings of pAtPMT1/GUS plants. (A) Anther of a pAtPMT1/GUS plant with no GUS activity. (B) Closed and just opening (arrow) pollen grains on agar medium. (C) Ungerminated (white) and germinated (blue) pollen grains, the latter with a well-developed pollen tube. (D) Cross-section through a flower stalk showing GUS histochemical staining in the centre of two vascular bundles. (E, F) Higher magnifications of cross-sections from flower stalk vascular bundles (ph, phloem; xy, xylem). Arrows show regions, with the typical stacks of cambium and newly formed phloem and xylem vessels. Bars are 100 μm in (A), 20 μm in (B, C), and 25 μm in (D–F). Analysis of 30 pAtPMT2/GUS plants confirmed the already described GFP expression in pollen (CITATION, B). In contrast to the GUS staining observed in pAtPMT1/GUS pollen (CITATION, C), however, this staining (i) was much stronger and (ii) was detected in pollen grains of still closed anthers (CITATION). Moreover, our analyses also revealed GUS activity in hydathodes and (weakly) in minor veins of several plants (CITATION). Finally, one pAtPMT2/GUS plant showed staining in the vasculature of the flower stalks. The latter signal resulted from low GUS activity in the cambium and from stronger GUS activity in young xylem cells (CITATION). Reporter gene analyses of pAtPMT2/GFP and pAtPMT2/GUS plants. (A) Inflorescence of a pAtPMT2/GUS plant with strong GUS staining in the mature anthers. (B) Higher magnification of an anther with very strong GUS staining in fully developed pollen grains (arrows) and in germinated and ungerminated pollen on agar medium (insert). Staining of cells in the anther surface results from the diffusion of excess stain out of the pollen grains and can even reach the sepals and petals of stained flowers (see A). (C) GFP-fluorescence (epifluorescence) in pollen grains on an opened anther from a pAtPMT2/GFP plants. No fluorescence is seen in WT anthers (insert). (D) Strong GUS staining in source leaf hydathodes and very weak GUS staining in minor veins (arrows). (E) Cross-section of a flower stalk with GUS staining in young xylem cells (ca, cambium; ph, phloem; xy, xylem). A bar indicates the region where the single-celled row of cambial cells is located. The cambial cells themselves cannot be identified. Bars are 2 mm (A, D), 200 μm (B, insert of C), 20 μm (insert of B), 100 μm (C), 25 μm (E). While GFP fluorescence could not be detected in any of the pAtPMT1/GFP plants (not shown), 100% of the pAtPMT2/GFP plants showed intense fluorescence in their mature pollen grains (CITATION). This fluorescence was detected only during the late stages of pollen development, i.e. in still closed anthers of just opening flowers. The signal increased further with ongoing anther dehiscence. No other sites of GFP fluorescence were detected. This GFP signal was absent from wild-type (WT) pollen (insert of CITATION). The observed expression of AtPMT2 in pollen is supported by data from publicly accessible microarray analyses that show strong expression of AtPMT2 exclusively in mature pollen (stage 12). However, as already mentioned, these microarray data show identical data for AtPMT1, as they do not discriminate between these two almost identical genes (https://www.genevestigator.com/; http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi). Moreover, the data presented do not show expression of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 in any other tissue, which could result from weak promoter activities in only a limited number of cells of a given organ, for example, in young xylem cells of the flower stalk. To test this possibility and to confirm or confute the GUS stainings observed in flower stalks, antisera were raised against a mixture of two peptides (peptide 1: NH2-KVLDKTSNTKEEAISR-COOH; peptide 2: NH2-SYTANKKNNSMSKDNEV-COOH) predicted to represent immunogenic regions in AtPMT1. These peptides corresponded to the regions 223–238 (central cytoplasmatic loop) and 491–507 (C-terminus) of AtPMT1. The respective regions of AtPMT2 are either identical (peptide 1) or very similar (peptide 2: NH2-YSANKKNNVMSKGKQV-COOH), and resulting antibodies were, therefore, not expected to discriminate between these proteins. Peptides for the production of potentially monospecific antibodies could not be identified. The quality of the antisera was first tested in AtPMT1-expressing or AtPMT2-expressing yeast cells. Sera from two immunized rabbits (αAtPMT1/2-R1 and αAtPMT1/2-R2) recognized AtPMT1 in detergent extracts of enriched plasma membranes from yeast cells expressing the AtPMT1 cDNA (CITATION). Most importantly, however, immunolocalizations with sections from yeast cells expressing AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 either in a sense or in an antisense orientation (i) labelled AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 equally well in sense but not in antisense sections, and (ii) labelled the cell surface exclusively, most likely the plasma membranes of these cells (CITATION). This demonstrated that, as expected, the sera do not discriminate between AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. The sera, however, appeared to be suitable to detect these proteins in immunohistochemical analysis of plant tissue. Characterization of the αAtPMT1/2 antisera in AtPMT1-expressing and AtPMT2-expressing yeast cells. (A) Western-blot (2 μg of protein per lane) of SDS-solubilized, enriched plasma membranes from AtPMT1-expressing yeast cells (s) or from cells expressing the AtPMT1 cDNA in antisense orientation (as). αAtPMT1/2 antisera from two rabbits (R1 and R2) were used at dilutions of 1:5000 and yielded prominent signals only in extracts from AtPMT1-expressing (s) cells. (B) Decoration of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 proteins at the cell surfaces of AtPMT1-expressing (AtPMT1-s) or AtPMT2-expressing (AtPMT2-s) yeast cells with αAtPMT1/2-R1 (1:1000). An overview with many cells is shown for AtPMT1, a single cell is shown for AtPMT2. No fluorescence was seen in antisense controls (AtPMT1-as and AtPMT2-as). Bars are 50 μm for the AtPMT1 sections and 3 μm for all AtPMT2 sections. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.) Based on these results, immunohistochemical analyses of cross-sections from Arabidopsis WT flower stalks were performed with unpurified αAtPMT1/2-R1 antiserum. CITATION shows that this serum labelled the same cell layers that were stained by the GUS histochemical stainings shown in CITATION (pAtPMT1) and in CITATION (pAtPMT2). No fluorescence was detected, when preimmune serum was used for these analyses (CITATION, C). The use of affinity-purified αAtPMT1/2-R1 improved the signal intensity, but did not alter the specificity of the labelling (CITATION, E). This confirmed the observed GUS staining that pointed to pAtPMT1 and pAtPMT2 activities in young xylem cells (CITATION) although this staining was only seen in a very few transgenic plants. Labelling of young xylem cells with αAtPMT1/2-R1 in Arabidopsis WT plants. (A) Epifluorescence image showing two vascular bundles of a flower stalk cross-section from an Arabidopsis WT plant (unpurified αAtPMT1/2-R1, 1:1000). (B, C) Vascular bundle of a similar section treated with preimmune serum (1:1000). (B) White-light image and (C) epifluorescence image. (D, E) White light merged with epifluorescence image (D) and epifluorescence image alone (E) of a similar image treated with affinity-purified αAtPMT1/2-R1 (1:5). Boxed regions in (A) and (E) show typical stacks of cells. Autofluorescence in (A), (C), and (D) results from autofluorescence of cell wall phenolics (ph, phloem; xy, xylem). Bars are 50 μm. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.) In publicly available T-DNA insertion libraries (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress) mutants with T-DNA insertions in an exon or intron of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 could not be found, but four lines (SALK_035269, SALK_035929, GABI_141A06, GABI_204C03) were identified that had insertions in the intergenic region between the AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 start ATGs. In three of these lines, the predicted insertions seemed to be too far upstream from the translational start sites to affect the expression of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2. Therefore, only one mutant (Salk_035269), that was predicted to carry an insertion near the translational start ATG of the AtPMT1 gene, was analysed. CITATION demonstrates that the insertion in this Atpmt1-1 mutant was 559 bp upstream from the ATG, a distance that might still be long enough to allow expression of the downstream AtPMT1 coding region. In fact, when the AtPMT1 mRNA levels were compared in three WT and three Atpmt1-1 plants (insert of CITATION) by RT-PCR, similar levels were found in all the plants analysed. Characterization of T-DNA and antisense lines. (A) Genomic organization of the Atpmt1-1 mutant allele (SALK_035269) that carries a T-DNA insertion in the 5′-flanking region (grey) 559 nucleotides upstream from the start ATG. Arrows show the position of the primers used for the characterization of the mutant. The upper right corner shows RT-PCR analyses with cDNAs from three homozygous Atpmt1-1 plants and from three WT plants. AtPMT1 bands can be amplified from the Atpmt1-1 and from the WT cDNAs. Amplified bands of ACTIN2 (ACT2) are shown as controls. (B) Representative RT-PCR analysis of five independent AtPMT1/2-antisense lines (1–5) and of a WT plant. Transcripts of ACT2, AtPMT1, and AtPMT2 were amplified with gene-specific primers (S, molecular weight standard). Only the AtPMT2 transcript is absent from all AtPMT1/2-antisense lines. In a second approach, an RNAi construct was used that was designed to reduce AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 mRNA levels simultaneously. This construct carried the region with the highest sequence conservation between AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 (nucleotides 719–1191 in the two ORFs; 96.6% identity) in opposite directions under the control of the 35S promoter. After transformation of Arabidopsis plants with this construct, a large number of independent transgenic lines was identified (pMV-RNAi1 plants). The AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 mRNA levels in these plants were then compared with the corresponding mRNA levels in WT plants. Thereby AtPMT2 expression was found down-regulated or absent from most of these plants, whereas that of AtPMT1 was not affected (CITATION). Therefore, neither the Atpmt1-1 mutant nor the pMV-RNAi1 plants were used for further analyses.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Col-0 and SALK_035269) were grown in growth chambers on potting soil under a 16/8 h light/dark regime at 22 °C and 60% relative humidity or in the greenhouse under ambient conditions. For heterologous expression of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs in yeast, strain EBY.VW-4000 was used (CITATIONet al., 1999). Escherichia coli strain DH5α (CITATION) was used for all basic cloning steps. Transformation of Arabidopsis was performed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (CITATIONet al., 1980). AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs were amplified from whole plant (Col-0) total RNA with gene specific primers [for AtPMT1: AtPUT1-5 (5′-GAC ACA GCG GCC GCA AGC TTG TAA AAG AAA TGA ATT CCT CGG GAG TTG AAC A-3′) and AtPUT1-3 (5′-GAC ACA GCG GCC GCT CAT TGT CCA TCC ACA ACT TCA T-3′); for AtPMT2: AtPUT2-5 (5′-GAC ACA GCG GCC GCA AGC TTG TAA AAG AAA TGA GTT CCT CAG GAG AAG AAC G-3′) and AtPUT2-3 (5′-GAC ACA GCG GCC GCT CAT TGT TCA TCA ACT ACT TGT T-3′)] binding to the very 5′-ends (including the start ATG) or the very 3′-ends (including the stop codon) of the cDNAs. These PCR reactions added the 15-nucleotide sequence aag ctt gta aaa gaa immediately upstream of the AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 from the start ATGs, as this sequence has repeatedly been shown to improve expression of foreign genes in yeast (CITATIONet al., 2004). Moreover, they added NotI cloning sites to both ends of the constructs. The resulting cDNAs were cloned into the yeast expression vector NEV-N (CITATION), sequenced, and used for transformation of yeast cells (CITATIONet al., 1992). If not otherwise indicated, uptake experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) as described by CITATIONet al. (1990). The uncoupler CCCP was added to a final concentration of 50 μM 5–10 s before substrate addition. For functional analysis in X. laevis oocytes AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 cDNAs were cloned into the plasmid pDK148 (CITATIONet al., 2002). cRNAs were prepared using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA). Oocyte preparation and cRNA injection have been described elsewhere (CITATIONet al., 1996). In two-electrode voltage-clamp studies, oocytes were perfused with a standard solution containing 30 mM KCl, 65 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 ,adjusted to pH 6.5 with MES/TRIS buffers. The standard solution was replaced with 100 mM NMGCl as indicated in the figures. Currents in the absence of substrates were subtracted for leak correction. Promoter fragments of 1897 bp (AtPMT1→pAtPMT1) and 1708 bp (AtPMT2→pAtPMT2) were PCR-amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA [for pAtPMT1: AtPMT1-p5 (5′-CAT GCA AG CTT TCT CAT CCA GTA GCT-3′) and AtPMT1-p3 (5′-AGG AAT CCA TGG TTT CCG TGG TGA TTG TAA AAC-3′); for pAtPMT2: AtPMT2-p5 (5′-AAG AAG AAG CTT AAC ATA TAC TTC AAT G-3′) and AtPMT2-p3 (5′-AGG AAC CCA TGG TGT CCA CCG CGA TTG TAA AAC-3′)]. The primer pairs introduced an N-terminal HindIII site and a C-terminal NcoI site that were used to clone the resulting fragments in front of the ORF of GUS in a pUC19-based plasmid. From there, (the pAtPMT1/GUS or pAtPMT2/GUS boxes were excised and inserted into HindIII/SacI-digested pAF16 (CITATIONet al., 2005) yielding the plasmids pMV-7A (pAtPMT1/GUS) and pMV-8A (pAtPMT2/GUS). For the generation of promoter/GFP fusions, the same PCR-derived promoter fragments were cloned in front of the ORF of GFP in a pUC19-based plasmid and then also cloned as HindIII/SacI fragments into pAF16 yielding the plasmids pMV-7B (pAtPMT1/GFP) and pMV-8B (pAtPMT2/GFP). The different constructs were used for transformation of Arabidopsis (CITATION). For transient expression of fusion constructs, the plasmid pSO35e was used (CITATIONet al., 2005). The coding sequences were PCR-amplified [for AtPMT1: AtPMT1c+4f (5′-GAG GCA CCA TGG AGA ATT CCT CGG GAG TTG AAC AAG GTG-3′) and AtPMT1c+1533r (5′-TGC CTC CCA TGG CTT GTC CAT CCA CAA CTT CAT TGT CTT TG-3′); for AtPMT2: AtPMT2NcoI-5′ (5′-GAC ACA CCA TGG GTT CCT CAG GAG AAG AAC G-3′) and AtPMT2NcoI-3′ (5′-GAC ACA CCA TGG CTT GTT CAT CAA CTA CTT GTT-3′)]. These primers introduced NcoI sites in font of the respective start ATG and a second NcoI site after the last amino acid of the respective ORF. These second NcoI sites replaced the stop codons of the original sequences. These modified ORFs were inserted into the unique NcoI cloning site representing the start ATG of the GFP ORF in the pSO35e plasmid. The continuous ORFs were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting constructs were used for transient expression of AtPMT1/GFP or AtPMT2/GFP in Arabidopsis protoplasts (polyethylene glycol transformation; CITATION) or in tobacco epidermis cells (particle bombardment; CITATIONet al., 2005). The position of the T-DNA insertion in SALK_035269 was determined using the left border-specific primers LBa1 (5′-TGG TTC ACG TAG TGG GCC AT-3′) and LBb1 (5′-GCG TGG ACC GCT TGC TGC AAC T-3′) and with the AtPMT1-specific primer AtPMT1p3. For production of an RNAi construct in pHANNIBAL (CITATIONet al., 2001) a 472 bp fragment corresponding to the region from 710 to 1191 in the AtPMT1 cDNA (96.6% sequence identity with the corresponding fragment of AtPMT2) was amplified with the primers AtPMT1c+719f (5′-GAC ACA CTC GAG TCT AGA ATG ACA TCA AAC GCG CAG t-3’) and AtPMT1c-1191r (5′-CTG TGT GGT ACC AAG CTT ACA AAA GTC ATC ACC GTC GT-3′) that added two restriction sites to each end. The fragment was cloned (i) between the XbaI and HindIII sites of pHANNIBAL and (ii) between the KpnI and XhoI sites of pHANNIBAL. The RNAi construct was then inserted into pAF16 yielding pMVRNAi1. Expression levels of AtPMT1, AtPMT2, and ACTIN2 were determined by RT-PCR using the primers AtPMT1c11f (5′-GGG AGT TGA ACA AGG TGT TGT GA-3′) and AtPMT1c1253r (5′-ACA GGG AAT ATC TCT GAG CA-3′), AtPMT2c550f (5′-TGG AGG TTC ATG TTA GGT ATT-3′) and AtPMT2c1253r (5′-ACG GGG AAT ATC TCT GAG GC-3′), and AtAct2g+846f (5′-ATT CAG ATG CCC AGA AGTCTT GTT-3′) and AtAct2g+1295r (5′-GAA ACA TTT TCT GTG AAC GAT TCCT-3′). For production of an anti-AtPMT1/AtPMT2 antiserum (αAtPMT1/2) two AtPMT1-derived peptides that were identical or almost identical in the AtPMT2 protein were synthesized and used to immunize two rabbits (Pineda Antikörper Service, Berlin Germany). Pre-immune sera were taken from each rabbit prior to the first immunization. Sera from bleedings performed 90 d after the first immunization were used without further purification (unpurified antisera), sera from bleedings performed 120 d after the first immunization were affinity-purified with column-bound peptides (affinity-purified antisera). This purification was performed by Pineda Antikörper Service (Berlin, Germany). Binding of αAtPMT1/2 or of preimmune serum (dilutions shown in the figure legends) to microtome sections of fixed and embedded yeast cells or plant material (prepared as described by Ramsperger et al., 2004) was visualized after incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-isomer 1-conjugate (1:300; Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) as described by CITATION. Microscopic slides were mounted in anti-fading medium (ProLong Antifade Kit; Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) and viewed under appropriate excitation light. Plasma membranes of AtPMT1-expressing yeast cells and protein extracts of these membranes were enriched as described by CITATION, separated on sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels (CITATION), and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (CITATION). AtPMT1 protein bands were detected by treatment of the filters with anti-rabbit-IgG antiserum-peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1:4000 in blocking buffer) followed by incubation with Lumi-Light Western Blotting Substrate (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Images of GFP fluorescence were made with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop, Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany) with an excitation wavelength of 460–500 nm. Emitted fluorescence was monitored at detection wavelengths longer than 510 nm. Standard protocols were used for GUS histochemical staining of plant tissues (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 0.5 mg ml−1 X-Gluc). All stainings were performed for a minimum of 24 h or longer. For analyses of flower stalk sections, stained tissue was fixed for 2 h at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed with water (3 times), cleared with 70% ethanol, dehydrated (90% and 100% ethanol), embedded in Technovit7100 according to the manufacturers protocol (Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Wehrheim, Germany), and cut with razor blades.
