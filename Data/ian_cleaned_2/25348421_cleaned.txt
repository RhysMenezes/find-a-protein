!~ABS~! Protein ID (intrinsic disorder) plays a significant, yet relatively unexplored role in transcription factors (TFs). In the present paper, analysis of the transcription regulatory domains (TRDs) of six phylogenetically representative, plant-specific NAC [no apical meristem, ATAF (Arabidopsis transcription activation factor), cup-shaped cotyledon] TFs shows that the domains are present in similar average pre-molten or molten globule-like states, but have different patterns of order/disorder and MoRFs (molecular recognition features). ANAC046 (Arabidopsis NAC 046) was selected for further studies because of its simple MoRF pattern and its ability to interact with RCD1 (radical-induced cell death 1). Experiments in yeast and thermodynamic characterization suggest that its single MoRF region is sufficient for both transcriptional activation and interaction with RCD1. The remainder of the large regulatory domain is unlikely to contribute to the interaction, since the domain and truncations thereof have similar affinities for RCD1, which are also similar for ANAC013–RCD1 interactions. However, different enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding were revealed for ANAC046 and ANAC013, suggestive of differences in binding mechanisms. Although substitution of both hydrophobic and acidic residues of the ANAC046 MoRF region abolished binding, substitution of other residues, even with α-helix-breaking proline, was less disruptive. Together, the biophysical analyses suggest that RCD1–ANAC046 complex formation does not involve folding-upon-binding, but rather fuzziness or an unknown structure in ANAC046. We suggest that the ANAC046 regulatory domain functions as an entropic chain with a terminal hot spot interacting with RCD1. RCD1, a cellular hub, may be able to interact with many different TFs by exploiting their ID-based flexibility, as demonstrated for its interactions with ANAC046 and ANAC013.
!~RES~! NAC TFs representing the phylogentic diversity of the Arabidopsis NAC family were selected for systematic analysis of the NAC C-termini, hereinafter referred to as TRDs. These included NTL8 [CITATION] of group I, ANAC046 of group II [CITATION], NAP [CITATION] and ANAC019 of group III [CITATION], ANAC013 [CITATION] of group IV and SOG1 [CITATION] of group IX [CITATION] (Figure 1a). In addition to being NAC group representatives, they also play important functional roles. ANAC019 is implicated in abiotic stress responses and functions as a positive regulator of signalling via the plant stress hormone ABA [CITATION]. NTL8, which is membrane-bound, mediates salt regulation of seed germination [CITATION] and SOG1 regulates responses to DNA damage [CITATION]. As mentioned in the introduction, NAP is implicated in senescence [CITATION] and RCD1-interacting ANAC013 is implicated in oxidative stress responses [CITATION]. ANAC046 also interacts with RCD1 [CITATION] and microarray analysis suggests that expression of ANAC046 is significantly induced during senescence [CITATION] by different stress exposures and by ABA and SA, which are associated with abiotic stress responses and plant defence respectively (Figure 1b). Analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using ANAC046-specific primers confirmed the association of ANAC046 with senescence and stress responses (Figure 1c). The selected NAC TFs all contain a structured N-terminal NAC domain and a mostly disordered C-terminal TRD (Figure 1d). However, their order/disorder patterns are different. For example, the large C-termini of ANAC013 and SOG1 contain several regions of disorder interrupted by short, putatively ordered regions, whereas the NAP TRD was predicted to be completely disordered. Different α-helix and MoRF patterns were also predicted. Whereas only a single and two α-helices were predicted for the ANAC046 and ANAC019 TRDs, respectively, the other TRDs are likely to contain several α-helices. Furthermore, whereas several MoRFs were predicted for ANAC013, ANAC019, SOG1 and NTL8, only a single MoRF, coinciding with the predicted α-helix and, therefore, representing a putative α-MoRF, was revealed for ANAC046. [[FIGURE]] To analyse the structure and interactions of the TRDs of the six NAC TFs, these regions were produced as recombinant proteins (Figure 2). The complete C-terminal region was produced and purified for ANAC046, NAP and ANAC019, resulting in the recombinant proteins ANAC046 (172–338), NAP (162–268) and ANAC019 (163–317) and ANAC013 was produced without the C-terminal predicted transmembrane α-helix to generate ANAC013 (161–498). For NTL8 and SOG1, an N-terminal histidine-tag was needed to purify soluble protein fragments, named histidine–NTL8 (156–335) and histidine–SOG (210–449), in sufficient amounts. Although the relative migration pattern of the recombinant proteins by SDS/PAGE was in accordance with their relative molecular mass values [NAP (162–268): 15.0 kDa; ANAC019 (163–317): 17.2 kDa; ANAC046 (172–338): 18.2 kDa; histidine–NTL8 (156–335): 20.3 kDa; histidine–SOG (210–449): 29.0 kDa; ANAC013 (161–498): 37.5 kDa], they displayed slow migration during SDS/PAGE compared with standard globular proteins, which is in accordance with their ID nature and previous analysis of two NAC TRDs [CITATION]. [[FIGURE]] Different protein conformational classes (native, molten globule, pre-molten globule and denaturant-unfolded for globular proteins and pre-molten globule-like and coil-like for ID proteins) have characteristic hydrodynamic dimensions and molecular mass correlations [CITATION]. This aspect was analysed by size-exclusion chromatography for the four untagged NAC TRDs. The hydrodynamic radii (Stokes radii) of ANAC046 (172–338), NAP (162–268) and ANAC019 (163–317) corresponded to pre-molten globule states, whereas ANAC013 (161–498) had a more compact structure consistent with its disorder profile (Figures 1d and 3). Since α-helices might exert long-range effects on the structure of ID regions, the putative α-helix region of ANAC046 was removed. No significant structural change was monitored by this truncation to generate ANAC046 (172–318) (Figure 3, inset). [[FIGURE]] The NAC TRDs were also analysed by CD spectroscopy. Unfolded and disordered proteins have a characteristic far-UV CD spectrum with an intensive minimum near 200 nm and an ellipticity close to zero near 222 nm [CITATION]. ID proteins may be sorted on the basis of [θ]222 (ellipticity) and [θ]200 values into coil-like and pre-molten globule-like sub-classes. Although the spectra of the six recombinant proteins showed different characteristics, they all had a minimum around 200 nm and only slightly negative ellipticities at 222 nm (Figure 4a). Both the [θ]222 and [θ]200 values suggested that histidine–NTL8 (156–335), ANAC013 (161–498), NAP (162–268) and ANAC019 (163–317) are similar, populating pre-molten globule-like ensembles, whereas the values for histidine–SOG1 (210–449) and ANAC046 (172–338) suggest more random coil-like ensembles. The estimated contents of α-helical peptide bonds [CITATION] were close to 20% for all proteins investigated [25% for NAP (162–268), 16% for ANAC046 (172–338), 21% for ANAC019 (163–317), 16% for ANAC013 (161–498), 16% for histidine–SOG1 (210–449) and 16% for histidine–NTL8 (156–335)]. [[FIGURE]] Structure formation in ID proteins is typically studied as a function of solvent conditions [CITATION] and the naturally occurring protective osmolyte TMAO has been used to induce structure in ID regions [CITATION]. The apparently simple ANAC046 TRD was selected to analyse for structure propensity. ANAC046 (172–338) contains a single tryptophan, Trp332, in the predicted MoRF region (Figure 5) and tryptophan emission was measured using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. In the absence of TMAO, the maximum emission wavelength λMax was 355.5 nm (Figure 6, inset), whereas the emission wavelength maximum showed a significant blue shift to 348.5 nm in the presence of 3.0 M TMAO, suggesting that the environment around Trp332 became more hydrophobic in the presence of TMAO. The conformational changes were followed by monitoring the wavelength of the maximum fluorescence emission intensities as a function of the TMAO concentration. After fitting (eqn 2) [CITATION], the sigmoid curve observed when plotting the signal maximum wavelength for the various TMAO concentrations resulted in the following values: R2=0.95, ΔGU-F=23.8±9.6 kJ/mol, indicative of two-state cooperative folding with burial of the hydrophobic surface of the ANAC046 (172–338). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Several studies have shown that the transcription regulatory activity of the NAC TFs resides in the C-terminal regions and is independent of the N-terminal NAC domain [CITATION,CITATION]. For a few NAC TFs, the activity has been mapped to group-specific sequence motifs [CITATION]. This aspect was investigated for NAP, ANAC013 and ANAC046, which were selected for further analysis due to their ability to interact with RCD1 (ANAC013 and ANAC046) and to serve as negative control of the interaction (NAP). Coding regions of the three NAC genes were fused to yeast GAL4 DBD (Figures 7a–7c) and analysed for their ability to activate transcription through the ability to promote selective growth of yeast. [[FIGURE]] Both full-length NAP and its TRD, NAP (163–268), activated transcription in yeast. MEME motif analysis of the C-terminus revealed only one sequence motif in the TRD, which overlapped with a predicted α-helix (Figures 1d and 7a). Both hydrophobic and charged/polar residues were among the most conserved residues of the motif (Figure 7a). The TRD was truncated from the C-terminus to remove stepwise the predicted MEME motifs, α-helices and MoRFs. This revealed that the ability to activate transcription was retained until the region with the MEME motif was removed, after which no activity was detected. Similar results were obtained from the same C-terminal truncations of full-length NAP, supporting the importance of the MEME motif region for transcriptional activation activity. Both full-length ANAC013, DBD–ANAC013(1–498) and the TRD, DBD–ANAC013 (161–498), both lacking the transmembrane region, activated transcription in yeast. MEME analyses of the TRD did not reveal any conserved sequence motifs. Stepwise C-terminal truncation of both constructs revealed that removal of the region between residue 205 and 299, containing several MoRFs and α-helices (Figure 1d), abolished the ability to activate transcription (Figure 7b). Interestingly, part of this region resembles the strong EDLL activation motif present in plant AP2/ERF TFs and other acidic activators [CITATION]. Although ANAC013 does not show an exact match (EDLV as opposed to EDLL; Figure 7b), it is a potential candidate as an activating motif. After demonstrating the ability of full-length ANAC046 and its TRD to activate transcription, analysis of C-terminally truncated versions of these suggested the importance of the MoRF region for the activity (Figure 7c). This was supported by the ability of ANAC046 (315–338) to activate transcription. Relatively few interactions have been reported between NAC TRDs and other proteins. However, the TRD of HvNAC013 has been shown to interact with the RST domain of HvRCD1 [CITATION], making it likely that ANAC046, a close homologue of HvNAC013, and ANAC013 also use their TRDs for interactions with RCD1 [CITATION]. Yeast two-hybrid assays were initially used to analyse this. As expected, the RST domain of RCD1 interacted with both full-length ANAC013 and ANAC046 and their TRDs (Figures 7b and 7c), whereas no interaction was detected with NAP (Figure 7a) [CITATION]. However, the interaction between full-length ANAC046 and DBD–RCD1 (498–573) was relatively weak and only detectable by selective growth in the presence of adenine. To analyse whether intramolecular interactions between the NAC and the TRD domains of ANAC046 could hinder the interaction between the ANAC046 and RCD1, the ability of the two ANAC046 domains to interact was analysed. No interaction was detected when the two domains were physically split (Figure 7c). C-terminal truncations were also analysed for their ability to interact with DBD–RCD1 (498-573). This suggested that residues 205–299 of ANAC013 and that the very C-terminal MoRF region of ANAC046 were responsible for the interactions (Figures 7b–7c). Surprisingly, AD–ANAC046 (315–338), containing the MoRF region of ANAC046, did not interact with the RST domain. This may be due to steric hindrance from the GAL4 AD. CD spectroscopy was subsequently used to analyse for structural changes occurring upon interaction between the RST domain and the NAC TRDs. The structure of the RST domain remains unknown. However, the far-UV CD spectrum of histidine–RCD1–RST (487–589) showed pronounced minima at 222 and 208 nm suggesting that the RST domain is dominated by α-helical structural elements (Figure 4b). A slight change of the absolute minimum towards a lower wavelength for the complex compared with the theoretical complex, obtained by adding the individual ANAC046 (172–338) and histidine–RCD1–RST (487–589) spectra, suggested that complex formation does not involve folding, but is suggestive of unfolding. Likewise, the CD spectrum of interacting ANAC013 (161–498) and histidine–RCD1–RST (487–589) showed a shift of the minimum around 200 nm towards a lower wavelength and also a decrease in the negativity at 222 nm compared with the theoretical complex suggestive of induced unfolding (Figure 4c). So, for both ANAC046 and ANAC013, complex formation with RCD1 did not result in induced folding. ITC was used to analyse the thermodynamics of the interactions between the ANAC013 and ANAC046 TRDs and the RCD1 RST domain. This technique allows determination of the affinity of an interaction, in this study reported as the dissociation constant (Kd) and the change in enthalpy of binding (ΔH), whereas the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and in entropy (ΔS), follows from these values [CITATION]. The raw titration data displaying exothermic interactions were best fitted to the ‘one set of sites’ in the Origin ITC data analysis software. The affinities of the ANAC013 TRD, ANAC013 (161–498) and the ANAC046 TRD, ANAC046 (172–338), for the RST domain, RCD1–RST (499–572), was approximately the same with Kd values of 537 nM and 609 nM respectively (Figures 8a and 8b; Table 1). The RST domain contains one binding site for each NAC TRD identified by N values of 0.96 and 1.12 respectively (Table 1). Although there is only a minor difference in ΔG for the two interactions, the relative contributions of the changes in enthalpy and entropy were different. The change in entropy for binding of ANAC013 (161–498) to RCD1–RST (499–572) is relatively small and negative, indicating that binding is enthalpically driven. In contrast, the contributions from enthalpy and entropy to binding of ANAC046 (172–338) were of approximately the same size. [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]] Since the ANAC046 TRD is simple with respect to putative interaction surfaces (Figure 1d), RCD1 binding to ANAC046 was mapped further. N-terminal truncation of ANAC046 (172–338) to generate ANAC046 (264–338) did not have a significant effect on binding (Table 1; Figure 5). By contrast and as expected from the yeast two-hybrid analysis (Figure 7c), C-terminal truncation generating ANAC046 (172–318) and ANAC046 (172–296) completely abolished binding. Binding to the synthetic peptides ANAC046 (319–338) and ANAC046 (328–338) was also analysed. Both span the MoRF region (Figure 5). ANAC046(328–338) represents a minimal region with α-helix and MoRF propensity, whereas ANAC (319–338) contains additional negatively-charged aspartic acids (Figures 8c–8d). Binding of these peptides to RCD1–RST (499–572) showed approximately the same Kd as was obtained for binding of ANAC046 (172–338) to RST. Interestingly, the relative contribution of ΔH and ΔS to binding was different, with a relatively smaller enthalpic contribution for the shortest peptide. Since the RCD1-binding motif has been suggested to span one α-helix turn and contain both hydrophobic and acidic residues [CITATION], the core of the ANAC046 RCD1-binding site was changed by single residue substitutions in ANAC046 (172–338). Changing Phe331 and Asp334 to alanine completely abolished binding when measured in vitro by ITC (Table 1). The same mutagenic changes in the corresponding GAL4 fusion proteins did not affect the ability to activate transcription in yeast (Figure 7d). However, they also abolished the ability to interact with the RST domain in yeast (Figure 7e). Whereas substitution of Glu333 with either alanine or proline did not significantly affect binding measured by ITC, the change of Trp332 into Pro decreased binding affinity. This may be explained both by a direct effect on binding and by an effect of α-helix propensity, since proline generally destabilizes α-helices. The implications in binding of Phe331 and Asp334, separated by what corresponds to approximately one α-helix turn, supports the suggestion that the binding region forms an α-helix or a turn structure, at least in the complex. The results indicated that hydrophobic Phe331 is essential for binding. However, changing negatively-charged Asp334 surprisingly also had a dramatic effect on binding, suggesting that ionic interactions are also essential for binding. The effect of the ionic strength on the interaction was therefore analysed. Although the affinity in the presence of 20 mM and 100 mM NaCl was similar, the presence of 500 mM NaCl obstructed binding (Table 1), reconfirming the significant role of ionic interactions. In conclusion, the very C-terminal region of ANAC046 is implicated in both transcriptional activity and interactions with the RST domain of RCD1. This interaction depends on both an aromatic, hydrophobic residue and an acidic residue in the ANAC046 TRD. Since different secondary structure predictions did not agree with respect to the C-terminus of ANAC046 (results not shown), the ANAC046 (319–338) peptide was analysed by far-UV CD which suggested a highly unfolded peptide (Figure 4d) with an estimated α-helix content of 14%. TFE can also be used to analyse secondary structure propensity and was used in this study to allow comparison with other similar studies [CITATION]. Addition of TFE to 10% (v/v) only marginally increased the estimated α-helical content to 18%. By contrast, addition of TFE to 40% markedly changed the CD spectrum. Thus, the global minimum was changed from 200 nm, typical of an unfolded state, to 222 nm and 208 nm, characteristic of α-helix and with an estimated α-helical content of 35% (Figure 4d).

The name and accession numbers of the NAC TFs analysed in this study are: ANAC019, At1g52890; ATAF1 (ANAC002), At1g01720; SOG1 (suppressor of γ response 1; ANAC008), At1g25580; NAP (ANAC029), At1g69490; ANAC013, At1g32870; ANAC046, At3g04060; NTL8 [NTM1 (NAC with transmembrane motif(1)-like8] (ANAC040), At2g27300. ID was predicted using DISOPRED and secondary structure was predicted using PSIPRED [CITATION]. MoRFs were predicted using MoRFpred [CITATION] and sequence motifs were predicted using MEME [multiple EM (expectation maximization) for motif elicitation] [CITATION]. Alignments and the phylogenetic tree were constructed using ClustalX 2.1 [CITATION]. Microarray data for developmental stages were obtained from the Arabidopsis electronic fluorescent pictograph browser at www.bar.utoronto.ca using ATH1 microarray samples (www.arabidopsis.org). The samples were in triplicate. The data were normalized to the GCOS (GeneChip Operating Software) method, with a target intensity value of 100 (www.bar.utoronto.ca). The signal recorded for a specific gene in each tissue was directly compared with the highest signal recorded. Perturbed ATH1 microarray samples from the Genevestigator data repository (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/) were analysed for induced expression using a stringent (>2-fold regulation; P<0.05) selection criterion. The treatments were: leaves injected with Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola for 24 h; leaf samples not watered for 7 days; leaf samples treated with 50 mM abscisic acid (ABA) for 3 h; rosette leaf treated with 250 mM NaCl for 24 h; seedlings treated with 2 mM salicylic acid (SA) for 12 h; green tissue treated with 300 mM mannitol for up to 24 h. Arabidopsis Col-0 (Columbia ecotype 0) seeds were surface-sterilized, placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar and stratified for 3 days at 4°C in the dark. Growth took place for 8 days before seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium and incubated for 16 days. Seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 50 mM ABA for 3 h, 2 mM SA for 12 h or 300 mM mannitol or 250 mM NaCl for 24 h. Plants were grown in controlled environment chambers with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle (120 μEm−2·s−1) at 22°C. Plants for senescence studies were transferred from agar to soil and harvested 17 days and 42 days after sowing (DAS). Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time RT (reverse transcription)-PCR was performed three times on 100 ng of total RNA and 100 ng of primers using Brilliant II SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix Kit (Agilent Technologies). The 2−ΔΔCT method was used to calculate relative change in transcript levels [CITATION] with actin2 as reference to determine relative expression levels. The ANAC046-specific primers 5′-GACAACACTTACCTTCCTACCCAA and 5′-TTATTATTGCCTGAACCTGCCC-3′ resulted in an amplicon length of 101 bp and the actin2-specific primers 5′-GGTAACATTGTGCTCAGTGGT GG and 5′- AACGACCTTAATCTTCATGCTGC resulted in an amplicon length of 108 bp. Specific primers were used to amplify RCD1 and NAC fragments. The PCR products were inserted into pDEST17 (Invitrogen) or pET15b (Novagen) to obtain histidine-tagged recombinant proteins and pET11a (Novagen) to obtain untagged recombinant proteins. The histidine-tagged NAC proteins were expressed in Escherischia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLyS at 37°C, harvested, resuspended in PBS, 25% (w/v) sucrose and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, treated with DNAse I (10 units/ml) for 15 min and sonicated three times. Soluble histidine–SOG1 (210–449) was purified on TALON resin using standard protocols (Clontech). Insoluble histidine–NTL8 (156–335) was dissolved in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 4.5 M urea and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged 10 min at 20000 g before affinity purification. The untagged recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP at 37°C and purified using a denaturation/renaturation procedure for ID proteins as reported previously [CITATION]. The induced cells were harvested, sonicated and resuspended as for histidine–NTL8. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml Mono Q 5/50 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 4.5 M urea and eluted with a linear gradient from 0–1 M NaCl. Subsequently, proteins were dialysed against 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl before size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex™ 75 10/300 GL (gas/liquid) column (GE Healtcare). RCD1–RST (RCD1, SRO, TAF4) (499–572) and histidine–RCD1–RST (487–589) were expressed in BL21-(DE3) at 37°C, harvested, resuspended in 50 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM 2-mercaptoehtanol and sonicated. After centrifugation for 20 min at 13000 g at 4°C, the supernatant from expression of RCD1–RST (499–572) was dialysed 3×4 h against 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.9, 20 mM NaCl at 4°C. The sample was centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 g and 4°C before application to a 6 ml cation exchange SOURCE™ 15S column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 20 mM to 1 M NaCl. The supernatant from the histidine–RCD1–RST (487–589) expression was purified on TALON resin (Clontech). Purified proteins were analysed by MALDI–TOF MS (Autoflex Bruker) and SDS/PAGE and dialysed as needed for further analysis. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex™ 75 10/300 GL column using an Äkta 900 purifier (GE Healthcare). The following proteins were used for calibration: bovine aprotinin (6.5 kDa); cytochrome c (12.4 kDa); bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa); BSA (66 kDa). Blue Dextran (2000 kDa) was used for void volume (V0) determination. Proteins for chromatography were dissolved in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl. DTT was added to a concentration of 10 mM just before protein was loaded on to the column. Stokes radii were calculated according to the method of Uversky [CITATION]. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter at a wavelength range from 250 nm to 190 nm, a scan rate of 10 nm/min, 10 accumulations and 2 s response time. Samples were recorded in a quartz cuvette with a 1-mm path length. For each spectrum, the background buffer spectrum was subtracted and the resulting spectrum smoothed using a Fast Fourier Transform filter (Jasco software). The spectra were obtained for samples containing between 5 μM and 30 μM protein in 10 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.0. The helicity percentage was estimated using the formula H=([θ]222–3000)/(−36000−3000), where [θ]222 is the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (in deg×cm2×dmol−1) [CITATION]. When TFE (trifluoroethanol) was included in the experiments, the concentrations ranged from 0%–40% (v/v). To detect intrinsic transcriptional activity and protein–protein interaction, ANAC046, ANAC013 and NAP were examined for the presence of an activation domain and for their ability to bind RCD1 using the yeast one- and two-hybrid systems. Full-length or truncated versions of the NAC TF and RCD1 encoding sequences were amplified using sequence specific primers and recombined into the pDEST32/pDEST22 vectors (Invitrogen). ANAC046 mutants were constructed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transformed into yeast strain pJ694A and assayed as described [CITATION]. ITC was used to determine the thermodynamic parameters Kd and ΔH from which ΔG and ΔS were calculated. The experiments were performed with a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare). Protein samples were dialysed against 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 and 100 mM NaCl or as indicated, centrifuged at 15000 g for 5 min and degassed for 10 min by stirring under vacuum. Experiments were performed with a concentration of titrand in the sample cell of 3–6 μM and titrator concentrations of 45–90 μM in the syringe. A total of 14 or 28 injections separated by 300 s and with a duration of 20–40 s each of 10–20 μl of titrant was injected into the sample at 25°C. Data from the ITC experiments were analysed using an Origen 7 software package (MicroCal™) by fitting data to a ‘one set of sites’ binding model. Standard errors for the thermodynamic parameters ΔH and Kd, as well as the stoichiometry N, were obtained from Origin when fitting the data. The heat of dilution was subtracted from the raw data by performing a titration of titrant against buffer or by subtracting the dilution enthalpy obtained in the last injection when the partial enthalpy change had reached a constant level. Similar results were obtained at least twice for all experiments. N-terminally acetylated and C-terminally amidated peptides were obtained from TAG Copenhagen A/S. TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide)-induced protein folding was monitored by tryptophan emission fluorescence intensity according to a modified protocol [CITATION]. The concentration of ANAC046 (172–338) was 1 μM in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 0–3 M TMAO. TMAO was diluted from a stock solution of 3.5 M TMAO. The samples were mixed, inverted six times, centrifuged briefly and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before emission scanning from 320–370 nm with scan speed 50 nm/min, excitation slit 7.5 nm, emission slit 10.0 nm and 10 accumulated scans in a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer at 298 K with excitation at 295 nm. Buffer spectra were subtracted from the raw spectra. All samples were prepared in duplicate and measured individually. The wavelength of the maximum tryptophan emission intensity for a given sample was normalized to: (1) The fraction folded was plotted as a function of the TMAO concentration and by using OriginPro 9.0.0 (64-bit) b45 (Academic) fitted to: (2) [CITATION]
