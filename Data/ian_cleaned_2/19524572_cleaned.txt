!~ABS~! Phototropin receptor kinases play an important role in optimising plant growth in response to blue light. Much is known regarding their photochemical reactivity, yet little progress has been made to identify downstream signalling components. Here, we isolated several interacting proteins for Arabidopsis phototropin 1 (phot1) by yeast two-hybrid screening. These include members of the NPH3/RPT2 (NRL) protein family, proteins associated with vesicle trafficking, and the 14-3-3 lambda (λ) isoform from Arabidopsis. 14-3-3λ and phot1 were found to colocalise and interact in vivo. Moreover, 14-3-3 binding to phot1 was limited to non-epsilon 14-3-3 isoforms and was dependent on key sites of receptor autophosphorylation. No 14-3-3 binding was detected for Arabidopsis phot2, suggesting that 14-3-3 proteins are specific to phot1 signalling.
!~RES~! Arabidopsis phot1 was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen using a random cDNA library from Arabidopsis CITATION. A total of 8×104 colonies were screened, from which 57 grew on full selection medium. Further characterisation led to the isolation of five cDNA clones encoding proteins of interest that are summarised in CITATION . Proteins known to interact with phot1, such as RPT2 CITATION were identified demonstrating the veracity of the approach. Specifically, the N-terminal region of RPT2 (amino acid residues 1–187) was isolated (CITATION) including the BTB/POZ domain (amino acid residues 32–128) which is known to be important for mediating the interaction between RPT2 and phot1 CITATION. A novel member of the NPH3/RPT2-like (NRL) family was also identified. This protein, designated NPH3-like (NPH3-L), comprised a truncated region of the protein (amino acid residues 243–433) downstream of the BTB/POZ domain which resides within the NPH3 signature region spanning amino acids 213 to 484 in NPH3-L (CITATION). In addition, we identified two ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF2 and ARF7), members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins that play important roles in the assembly and disassembly of coat proteins associated with driving vesicle budding and fusion CITATION. In each case, full-length cDNAs were isolated encoding the entire region of the protein (CITATION). Similarly, a full-length cDNA was obtained encoding 14-3-3λ (CITATION), that interacts specifically with phot1 in yeast, although weaker in comparison to the interaction between positive controls expressing murine p53 and the SV40 large T-antigen (CITATION A). Similarly, NPH3-L, ARF2 and ARF7 were not found to autoactivate the yeast two-hybrid system in the absence of phot1 (data not shown), and thus represent bona fide interacting proteins. Yeast growth was screened in the absence of continuous illumination to identify the afore-mentioned proteins. To establish whether light had any effect, yeast were grown in darkness or in continuous white light (20μmolm−2 s−1). The interaction between ARF2 and phot1 was severely attenuated in the presence of light (CITATIONB) and was specific to blue light (CITATIONC). A similar light sensitivity was observed for the interaction between ARF7 and phot1 (data not shown) suggesting that photoactivation of phot1 by blue light disrupts its binding to ARF proteins. By contrast, light had no effect on phot1 interactions with RPT2, NPH3-L and 14-3-3λ (CITATIONB). 14-3-3 proteins are key regulators of protein function in eukaryotes and preferentially bind to phospho-serine/threonine-containing motifs CITATION. Since phot1 undergoes blue light-dependent autophosphorylation CITATION, yeast growth in darkness (CITATIONB) would indicate that 14-3-3λ binding to phot1 is not dependent on the phosphorylation status of the receptor. However, previous reports have shown by far-Western blotting that a different member of the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family, 14-3-3 phi (ϕ), binds to the phosphorylated form of phot1 immunoprecipitated from V. faba CITATION and Arabidopsis CITATION. A transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing full-length phot1 fused to green fluorescent protein (phot1-GFP) under the control of the native PHOT1 promoter has been shown to complement the null phot1-5 allele CITATION. This line was therefore used to immunoprecipitate phot1-GFP from 3-day-old dark-grown seedlings to assess 14-3-3λ binding to phot1 by far-Western blotting. As shown in CITATIOND, binding of recombinant 14-3-3λ fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was not detected for phot1-GFP immunoprecipitated from dark-grown seedlings. However, a reduced electrophoretic mobility of phot1-GFP, indicative of receptor autophosphorylation, and concomitant 14-3-3λ binding was observed when seedlings were exposed to blue light. 14-3-3λ binding was also fluence-dependent, saturating at 600μmolm−2. These findings concur with studies using 14-3-3ϕ CITATION demonstrating that, at least for plant-derived phot1, 14-3-3 binding is dependent on receptor autophosphorylation. Phospho-serine residues required for the 14-3-3ϕ binding to Arabidopsis phot1 have been mapped to the intervening linker region between LOV1 and LOV2 CITATION and conform to protein kinase A (PKA)-like consensus sequences CITATION. To determine whether this was also the case for 14-3-3λ, truncation analysis from the C-terminus of phot1 was performed to assess regions important for 14-3-3 binding in yeast. Interactions between phot1 and 14-3-3λ were only evident when the LOV-linker region was present (CITATION A), indicating the importance of this peptide sequence. Arabidopsis phot1 is phosphorylated on three serine residues within this region, namely Ser350, Ser376 and Ser410 CITATION. Phosphorylation of both Ser350 and Ser376 is required for binding of 14-3-3ϕ to Arabidopsis phot1 CITATION. We therefore investigated whether these residues were also required for 14-3-3λ binding to phot1. Fragments of Arabidopsis phot1 containing both LOV domains, designated LOV1+2 were generated for this purpose. In vitro phosphorylation of LOV1+2 by the catalytic subunit of PKA resulted in strong 14-3-3λ binding as measured by far-Western blotting (CITATIONB). Although mutation of Ser350 and Ser376 to alanine substantially reduced the interaction, residual 14-3-3λ binding to phot1 in response to PKA treatment could still be detected (CITATIONB). Mutation of Ser410 to alanine (CITATIONC) abolished this interaction demonstrating an accessory role for this residue in mediating 14-3-3λ binding to phot1. While an interaction between 14-3-3λ and phot1 was readily detectable by far-Western blotting, no interaction was observed for Arabidopsis phot2. In vitro phosphorylation of the LOV1+2 region of phot2 by PKA was unable to mediate binding of 14-3-3λ (CITATION A). For independent verification, we investigated 14-3-3λ binding to phot1 and phot2 expressed in insect cells as both proteins exhibit light-induced kinase activity in this system (CITATIONB). 14-3-3λ binding was specific to phot1, but did not appear to be light dependent. This finding may coincide with the basal level of kinase activity detected for phot1 in vitro CITATION. Indeed, treatment with λ-phosphatase abolished radiolabelled phosphate incorporation in addition to 14-3-3λ binding to phot1 under dark and light conditions (CITATION). Despite showing light-dependent phosphorylation activity in insect cells, phot2 did not bind 14-3-3λ either in darkness or in response to irradiation (CITATIONB). As further confirmation, we examined whether phot2 from Arabidopsis could bind 14-3-3λ. Light-grown seedlings were used for our analysis since phot2 is poorly expressed in dark-grown Arabidopsis CITATION. Seedlings were incubated in darkness overnight to restore receptor activity to its ground state. Subsequent irradiation of seedlings with blue light resulted in an electrophoretic mobility shift for phot1 and phot2 indicative of receptor autophosphorylation (CITATIONC). Hence, identical illumination conditions were used to immunoprecipitate functional phot1-GFP and phot2-GFP from transgenic Arabidopsis (CITATIOND). Consistent with our efforts to monitor 14-3-3λ binding to phot2 in vitro and insect cells, 14-3-3λ binding was only detected for phot1-GFP. Taken together, these data imply that 14-3-3λ binding is specific to phot1. The 14-3-3-protein family comprises 13 members in Arabidopsis CITATION. Phylogenetic analysis shows that its members can be separated into two evolutionary branches: the epsilon and non-epsilon groups. 14-3-3λ is closely related to 14-3-3 kappa (κ) and in a sub-branch of the non-epsilon group (CITATION A). Thus, a peptide region unique to 14-3-3λ was used to generate antibodies specific to 14-3-3λ (see Section CITATION). A T-DNA insertion mutant lacking 14-3-3λ transcripts was used to test the antibody generated (CITATION A). No 14-3-3λ protein was detected in the T-DNA insertion mutant verifying the specificity of the 14-3-3λ antibody, as well as confirming that this allele is a null mutant (CITATIONB). Western analysis revealed that 14-3-3λ is ubiquitously expressed in wild-type plants and particularly prevalent in roots, flowers, cauline and rosette leaves (CITATIONC). Biochemical fractionation demonstrated that the majority of 14-3-3λ is soluble, however a portion of 14-3-3λ was found to associate with the membrane fraction purified from Arabidopsis (CITATIOND) indicating that 14-3-3λ, at least in part, colocalises to the same subcellular compartment as phot1 CITATION. Membrane localisation of 14-3-3λ was still observed in the phot1 phot2 double mutant indicating that its association with the membrane is not dependent on phototropins (CITATIOND). However, 14-3-3λ was found to co-purify with phot1-GFP immunoprecipitated from Arabidopsis and not with the plasma membrane marker GFP-Lti6b (CITATIONE) suggesting that 14-3-3λ and phot1 interact in vivo. We also tested the ability of phot1 to interact with other members of the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family. Epsilon (ϵ) and omicron (ο) were chosen as representative candidates from the epsilon sub-branches, whereas kappa (κ), upsilon (υ) and phi (ϕ) were chosen as further representatives of the non-epsilon group (CITATIONA). Each of these proteins were expressed as GST fusions (CITATIONB) and used for far-Western analysis with phot1-GFP immunoprecipitated from Arabidopsis alongside 14-3-3λ. Initially, binding of only 14-3-3λ and 14-3-3κ were observed (CITATIONC). Upon longer exposure, binding of 14-3-3ϕ and, to a much lesser extent, 14-3-3υ was also visible. No binding of the 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3ο was detected under these conditions implying that 14-3-3 binding to phot1 is restricted to non-epsilon family members. While binding of 14-3-3ϕ to phot1 agrees with previous reports CITATION, our findings show that phot1 has a stronger affinity for 14-3-3λ followed by 14-3-3κ (CITATIONC) consistent with their placement in the phylogenetic tree (CITATIONA). The difference in binding affinity between 14-3-3λ and 14-3-3κ was also evident upon diluting phot1-GFP proteins levels (CITATION A). A similar specificity for 14-3-3 binding was observed when using phot1 expressed in insect cells (data not shown). Like 14-3-3λ, 14-3-3κ binding was abolished upon mutation of Ser350, Ser376 and Ser410 to alanine in phot1 expressed in insect cells (CITATIONB). No binding of 14-3-3κ could be detected for phot2 expressed in insect cells (CITATIONC), as was the case for the other 14-3-3 candidates examined (data not shown) again indicating that 14-3-3 binding is a property unique to phot1.
!~MM~! Wild-type (gl-1, ecotype Columbia) and the phot1-5 phot2-1 mutant have been described previously CITATION. Arabidopsis expressing phot1-GFP CITATION, phot2-GFP CITATION and GFP-Lti6b CITATION are as described. The 14-3-3λ mutant was obtained from the SALK T-DNA mutant collection (SALK_075219). For the detection of transcripts total RNA was extracted from leaf tissue by the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacture’s instructions. cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR were performed as described CITATION. Primers used to amplify 14-3-3λ transcripts were 5′-AGGCGCTACTCCAGCGGA-3′ and 5′-CAAAGGTTATGGGGATTTTGAGA-3′. Seeds were surface sterilised and planted on filter paper on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.8% agar (w/v). Red and blue light was provided as described CITATION. Plants were grown on soil in a controlled environment room (Fitotron, Weiss-Gallenkamp, Loughborough, UK) under 16/8h 22/18°C light-dark cycle (70μmolm−2 s−1). The CLONTECH Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 was used for yeast two-hybrid analysis. Arabidopsis PHOT1 was cloned into the pGBK-T7 bait vector and used to screen a cDNA library derived from 3-day-old etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre, #CD4-22). Yeast strain AH109 was cotransformed with bait and prey plasmids and selected on synthetic dropout medium (SD) lacking leucine (Leu) and tryptophan (Trp). Contransformants were assayed for interaction on SD medium lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal). Yeast transformation, α-galactosidase assays and plasmid rescue were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Interaction tests with 14-3-3λ cDNA in the pACT2 prey vector were performed with pGBK-T7 constructs encoding regions of phot1 (amino acids 1-202, 1-307, 1-423 and 1-627). Coding sequences of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms 14-3-3λ (At5g10450), 14-3-3κ (At5g65430), 14-3-3ϕ (At1g35160), 14-3-3υ (At5g16050), 14-3-3ο (At1g34760) and 14-3-3ϵ (At1g223300) were PCR-cloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) as a translational fusion with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Recombinant 14-3-3 proteins were expressed and purified from the Escherichia coli host strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Protein expression of GST-fusion proteins and GST was induced with 1mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed with a French press and purified with GST-Bind Resin (Novagen). Proteins were eluted with 50mM reduced glutathione in 50mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. The purity and integrity of purified proteins was confirmed by 12.5% SDS–PAGE and staining with coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Bio-Rad). The LOV1+2 regions of phot1 (amino acids 180–628) and phot2 (amino acids 116–542) were expressed and purified as calmodulin binding peptide fusions and CITATION. Expression of phot1 and phot2 in insect cells was performed as described previously CITATION. Autophosphorylation assays were performed as described previously CITATION. For far-Western blotting experiments, radiolabelled ATP was omitted from the reaction. Phosphorylation of the bacterially expressed LOV1+2 proteins was performed by incubation of 10 μg of purified protein with 1000 units of bovine protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Calbiochem) in accordance with the supplier’s instructions. Total protein and microsomal membrane protein was extracted as described previously CITATION. For separation of soluble and membrane proteins, total protein extract was centrifuged at 100000g at 4°C for 75min. The supernatant was used as the soluble fraction and the pellet resuspended in extraction buffer as the membrane fraction. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford colorimetric method (Bio-Rad). GFP immunoprecipitations were performed using the μMACS GFP isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) as described CITATION. Proteins were detected with anti-phot1 and anti-phot2 polyclonal antibodies CITATION, anti-14-3-3λ purified polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide sequence VKDYRSKVESELSSVC (Eurogentec), anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Novagen), anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-UGPase antibody (AgriSera). Western blots were developed with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies and Immobilon Western chemiluminescence HRP substrate (Millipore) or alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)/nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (Sigma). Far-Western blotting was carried out according to Kinoshita and Shimazaki CITATION. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with purified GST-14-3-3 proteins or GST alone at a final concentration of 0.1mM unless otherwise stated. Protein–protein interactions were detected using monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Novagen) at 1/10000 dilution. Alignment of the 14-3-3 amino acid sequences and phylogenetic trees were produced using ClustalX CITATION. Trees were viewed using TreeView CITATION.
