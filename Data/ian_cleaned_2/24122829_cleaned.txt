!~ABS~! MicroRNA399-mediated regulation of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC24/PHOSPHATE2 (PHO2) is crucial for Pi acquisition and translocation in plants. Because of a potential role for PHO2 in protein degradation and its association with membranes, an iTRAQ (for isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation)- based quantitative membrane proteomic method was employed to search for components downstream of PHO2. A total of 7491 proteins were identified from Arabidopsis thaliana roots by mass spectrometry, 35.2% of which were predicted to contain at least one transmembrane helix. Among the quantifiable proteins, five were significantly differentially expressed between the wild type and pho2 mutant under two growth conditions. Using immunoblot analysis, we validated the upregulation of several members in PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) family and PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) in pho2 and demonstrated that PHO2 mediates the degradation of PHT1 proteins. Genetic evidence that loss of PHF1 or PHT1;1 alleviated Pi toxicity in pho2 further suggests that they play roles as downstream components of PHO2. Moreover, we showed that PHO2 interacts with PHT1s in the postendoplasmic reticulum compartments and mediates the ubiquitination of endomembrane-localized PHT1;1. This study not only uncovers a mechanism by which PHO2 modulates Pi acquisition by regulating the abundance of PHT1s in the secretory pathway destined for plasma membranes, but also provides a database of the membrane proteome that will be widely applicable in root biology research.
!~RES~! In order to minimize the complexity of proteome data and improve the detection of target proteins of low abundance, we first examined in which cellular fraction PHO2 protein is preferentially located. By immunoblot analysis using the anti-PHO2 antibody (CITATION), we detected the native PHO2 protein in the microsomal fraction isolated from the roots of the wild type but not from pho2 (Figure 1). By contrast, no signal was observed in the soluble fraction. In addition, we observed an increased level of PHO2 protein in the membrane but not the soluble fraction isolated from the roots of PHO2-overexpressing transgenic plants (Figure 1). As PHO2 is not predicted to possess any transmembrane helix domain, our results showing PHO2 enrichment in the membrane fraction suggest that PHO2 is a peripheral membrane protein. Our previous analysis of the subcellular localization of PHO2 by examining the C-terminal fluorescent protein–tagged PHO2 showed both reticular and spotted patterns (CITATION). To confirm this, we further examined the colocalization of the N-terminal fluorescent protein–tagged PHO2 in Arabidopsis protoplasts and performed statistical analysis of the subcellular colocalization of PHO2 and several subcellular markers (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). Similarly to the C-terminal fluorescent protein–tagged PHO2, the N-terminal fluorescent fusion protein was not observed at the PM or tonoplast. While the reticular pattern of PHO2 signal largely overlapped with the signals from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers At-WAK2 (CITATION) and PHF1 (CITATION; CITATION) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = 0.74 to 0.72), the punctate signal of PHO2 mainly colocalized with the markers for Golgi (r = 0.59 to 0.53) but to a lesser extent with the markers for the trans-Golgi network (r = 0.40), early endosomes (r = 0.44), and late endosomes (r = 0.31). Hence, we conclude that PHO2 is a peripheral membrane protein predominately associated with the ER and Golgi. Interestingly, although both the N- and C-terminal fluorescent protein fusions of PHO2 are functional proteins capable of complementation of pho2 by reducing the shoot Pi concentration when expressed under its native promoter (see Supplemental Figure 1B online; CITATION), we failed to observe a fluorescent signal for PHO2 in these complemented lines. The difficulty of detection of the PHO2 fluorescent fusions in planta has also been reported even when the inducible system was used (CITATION). We speculate that the PHO2 fluorescent fusion protein may be present at a very low level below the detection limit owing to its rapid protein degradation, and this possibility remains to be further examined. Given the membrane localization of PHO2 and potential engagement of membrane proteins in PHO2-mediated activities, we focused on the comparison analysis of the membrane proteomes of the wild type and pho2 by applying the method that we previously developed based on gel-assisted digestion: isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology combined with off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (CITATION). Since the function of PHO2 in the root is responsible for the Pi toxicity phenotype (CITATION; CITATION), root samples were used for analysis. The 12-d-old and 17-d-old roots grown under solid agar and hydroponic media containing 250 μM KH2PO4 were collected for isolation of membrane proteins. The elevated Pi level in the shoots of pho2 was confirmed for both growth regimes (see Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B online). After gel-assisted digestion, peptides from different samples were extracted and labeled with iTRAQ reagents, combined, and separated by strong cation exchange chromatography into 38 fractions. Each strong cation exchange fraction was desalted and analyzed in duplicate by mass spectrometry. Three biological replicates were conducted for each growth condition. The raw data generated from the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis were processed to detect MS/MS peaks using UniQua (CITATION) followed by the protein identification and quantification using MASCOT version 2.3 (Matrix Science). The processed spectra were searched against the TAIR10_pep_20110103_representative_gene_model database (December 2011; 27,416 sequences; ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Proteins/TAIR10_protein_lists/). Details of the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data processing are described in the Supplemental Methods 1 online. After combining total protein of four samples (agar-grown and hydroponic-grown wild-type and pho2 roots) from three biological replicates, we identified 659,511 peptide spectra corresponding to 7491 proteins with confidence (criteria are described in Supplemental Methods 1 online). Next, we employed various tools to annotate the membrane proteins identified. First, Transmembrane Hidden Markov Model (TMHMM) Server version 2.0 algorithm (CITATION) was used to predict the proteins containing transmembrane helices. A total of 2639 (35.2%) proteins were predicted to contain at least one transmembrane helix and are likely to be integral membrane proteins. In addition, subcellular localization was classified using the Gene Ontology (GO) database (GO:TermFinder) (CITATION) and SUBA (Arabidopsis Subcellular Database) (CITATION; CITATION). The posttranslational modifications associated with membrane anchoring, such as myristoylation, palmitoylation, prenylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, were also predicted. Collectively, these analyses yielded 4890 (65.3%) membrane or putative membrane proteins (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). To increase confidence for those proteins without a transmembrane helix, we considered the prediction reliable only if the protein was present in at least two analyses. Using this principle, a total of 3713 (49.6%) proteins were classified as membrane or membrane-associated proteins (Figure 2A). As the genome frequency of annotated membrane proteins predicted by TMHMM and GO is 24.5 and 16.7%, respectively, our results displayed a higher frequency of annotated membrane proteins (to 35.2% for TMHMM and 38.8% for GO), suggesting enrichment of membrane proteins in our analysis. Nevertheless, validation of membrane localization for those noncharacterized proteins will be required. Furthermore, we searched our data set against the most updated database of proteomic and green fluorescent protein (GFP) localization sets (April, 2013) in SUBA (CITATION; CITATION) and observed that 3489 (46.6%) proteins do not exist in the mass spectrometry database and, therefore, likely represent newly identified proteins. Identification of such large numbers of membrane proteins demonstrated the depth of our data set and the uniqueness of our methodology. The detailed descriptions including the protein scores and mass, annotation, predicted transmembrane helices, and quantification for the proteins identified are listed in Supplemental Data Set 1 online. [[FIGURE]] We next subjected the 7491 identified proteins to GO analysis. Several GO terms were significantly enriched, including catalytic activity (GO:0003824), transferase activity (GO:0016740), transporter activity (GO:0005215), and anion binding (GO:0043168) in the molecular function category as well as cellular process (GO:0009987), localization (GO:0051179), transport (GO:0006810), and establishment of localization (GO:0051234) in the biological process category (Figure 2B). Many of these categories are tightly associated with membrane proteins. For quantitative proteomic comparison between the wild-type and pho2 roots, a total of 5539 proteins with at least two identified peptides were quantified. Among them, 2081 proteins were identified from all three biological replicates and subjected to statistical analysis by one-tailed Student’s t test. We considered the difference in protein amount to be significant when the P value was <0.05 and there was at least a 1.3-fold change (Table 1). Using these criteria, we identified 59 and 20 proteins differentially expressed between the wild-type and the pho2 roots grown in solid agar and in hydroponic culture, respectively (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). We found five proteins displaying a reproducible trend of change across the two different samples grown in the solid agar and hydroponic systems in all three biological replicates (Table 1). Among them, three proteins were upregulated and two were downregulated in the pho2 mutant. The protein levels of several Pi transporters, PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3, in the PHT1 family were increased in the pho2 roots. Members of the PHT1 family localize to the PM and are thought to account for Pi uptake directly from the rhizosphere (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). When examining other annotated Pi transporters or Pi transport–related proteins in the list, we found that PHT1;4 and PHF1 proteins were upregulated in the agar-grown pho2 roots, yet did not show significant changes in the hydroponic samples (Table 1). PHF1 functions to facilitate the exit of PHT1 protein out of the ER and subsequent targeting to the PM (CITATION; CITATION). Because the upregulation of PHT1s and PHF1 proteins may be closely associated with the increased Pi uptake activity in pho2 mutants, we analyzed PHT1;4 and PHF1 along with other Pi transporters in the following analyses. It is worth noting that although PHO1 was identified only in the third biological replicate; its amount was increased in pho2 roots grown under both growth conditions (Table 1). This result reconfirms our previous finding that PHO2 directs the degradation of PHO1 (CITATION). Next, we investigated whether the alteration in PHT1 protein abundance in pho2 (Table 1) resulted from changes in gene expression at the transcript level. By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found that the transcriptional levels of PHT1;2, PHT1;3, and PHT1;4 were increased in younger seedlings, likely attributable to the low Pi concentration in the roots of younger seedlings of pho2 (see Supplemental Figures 2A and 2C online). A detailed comparison between the transcript and protein levels of PHT1s in hydroponically grown older seedlings is described below. To examine whether the increased levels of PHT1 and PHF1 proteins are responsible for Pi toxicity of pho2, we employed genetic approaches by analyzing the pht1;1 pho2 and phf1 pho2 double mutants. In contrast with the elevated Pi concentration of the pho2 shoots, the pht1;1 and phf1 single mutants displayed reduced shoot Pi concentrations compared with the wild type (Figure 3A) (CITATION; CITATION). Introduction of the mutation of PHT1;1 or PHF1 into pho2, giving rise to the pht1;1 pho2 or phf1 pho2 mutant, significantly reduced the shoot Pi concentration of pho2 by 14 or 76%, respectively (Figure 3A). Compared with PHT1;1, loss of function of PHF1 had a greater impact on reduction of shoot Pi in the pho2 mutant. The shoot Pi level in the phf1 mutant was also lower than that of the pht1;1 mutant. This could be attributed to the regulatory role of PHF1 in controlling the expression of multiple PHT1 proteins besides PHT1;1 (CITATION). Interestingly, pht1;1 pho2 and phf1 pho2 mutants had higher shoot Pi concentrations than the respective pht1;1 and phf1 single mutants, suggesting that additional factors, such as other PHT1 members revealed by our quantitative proteomic data (Table 1) or PHF1 homologs, may contribute to shoot Pi accumulation of pho2. Taken together, the genetic interaction of PHO2 with PHF1 and PHT1;1 supports the role of PHF1 and PHT1;1 in contributing to the high shoot Pi level of pho2. [[FIGURE]] To investigate to what extent the other major PHT1 members, PHT1;2, PHT1;3, and PHT1;4, may contribute to the phenotype of pho2, we generated the pht1;2 pho2 and pht1;3 pho2 double mutants; generation of pht1;4 pho2 by crossing is not feasible because of the close proximity of the PHT1;4 and PHO2 genes on chromosome 2. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, we found that the shoot Pi concentrations were pht1;1 pho2 < pht1;2 pho2 < pht1;3 pho2 (Figure 3B), indicating that PHT1;1 makes a greater contribution than PHT1;2 or PHT1;3 to the Pi accumulation in the pho2 mutant. This may be explained by a much higher transcript level of PHT1;1 relative to PHT1;2 and PHT1;3 when Pi is adequate (see below). Based on the previously observed increased mRNA level of PHT1;8 and PHT1;9 in pho2 roots, it was postulated that PHT1;8 and PHT1;9 are downstream components of PHO2 that contribute to Pi toxicity of the pho2 mutant (CITATION; CITATION). We did not identify these two proteins as candidates in our proteomic analysis and decided to examine their possible involvement using a genetic approach. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, the pht1;8 and pht1;9 single mutants did not display any apparent phenotype distinguishable from the wild type and had similar shoot Pi levels as the wild type. Notably, the shoot Pi concentrations of the pht1;8 pho2, pht1;9 pho2, and pht1;8 pht1;9 pho2 mutants remained as high as that of pho2 (Figure 3C). This result strongly argues against the involvement of PHT1;8 and PHT1;9 in the PHO2 regulatory pathway. We speculate that the upregulation of PHT1;8 and PHT1;9 transcripts is likely a result of secondary effects. In order to validate the results obtained from membrane proteomics, we raised antibodies against PHT1;1, PHT1;2, PHT1;3, PHT1;4, and PHF1 using synthetic peptides. Because of the high amino acid sequence similarity among PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3, a common peptide was used to generate an antibody recognizing all three of them (CITATION). The protein signals detected by immunoblot using these antibodies are specific because signals corresponding to the same size of protein in the T-DNA insertion mutants were not detected (phf1 and pht1;4) or reduced (pht1;1) compared with wild-type plants (see Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B online). Consistent with the data from quantitative membrane proteomics of 12-d-old seedlings, we found that the protein levels of PHT1;1/2/3, PHT1;4, and PHF1 in pho2 roots were higher than those in the wild-type controls under Pi-sufficient conditions (250 μM KH2PO4) (Figure 4A). The increased amount of PHT1 proteins in pho2 is in agreement with our previous observation of the increased Vmax of Pi uptake activity in pho2 (CITATION). Under Pi-deficient conditions (10 μM KH2PO4), the amounts of these proteins were increased compared with the Pi-sufficient conditions, and the level was similar in pho2 and wild-type plants (Figure 4A). In other words, the increase of these proteins in pho2 was observed only under Pi-sufficient conditions; the differences between pho2 and the wild type became negligible when Pi was limited. This is in line with our previous finding that the difference of Pi uptake activity between pho2 and the wild type was drastic only under Pi-sufficient conditions (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that suppression of PHO2 by miR399 under Pi deficiency is reversed when Pi is resupplied to the medium (CITATION). To examine the role of PHO2 in regulating the accumulation of PHT1 and PHF1 proteins upon Pi resupply, we examined the expression of these proteins following 3 d of Pi replenishment (250 μM KH2PO4) after 8 d of Pi starvation (10 μM KH2PO4). While the increased amounts of PHT1 proteins and PHF1 were comparable between the wild type and pho2 after the eighth day of starvation, a more rapid reduction of these proteins was observed in wild-type plants than in pho2 mutants after Pi replacement (Figure 4B). This suggests that PHO2 plays a role in downregulating the accumulation of these proteins once the Pi-starved plants sense the adequate resupply of Pi. In order to elucidate the role of PHO2 in downregulating the protein level of PHT1s and PHF1, we compared the mRNA and protein levels of PHT1s and PHF1 concurrently in the same sample of roots. In addition, because of the ambiguity resulting from transcriptional activation by reduced Pi concentrations in the roots of young pho2 seedlings (see Supplemental Figures 2A and 2C online), we focused on the analysis of hydroponically grown older seedlings [18 d old]) whose root Pi concentrations were comparable between the wild type and pho2. While the mRNA levels of PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3 showed no difference between wild-type and pho2 roots, these proteins increased significantly in the pho2 root (Figures 5A and 5B). Because the transcript level of PHT1;1 was much higher than those of PHT1;2 and PHT1;3 (more than 20-fold assuming that the amplification efficiency of different primer pairs are comparable), the protein signal detected by anti-PHT1;1/2/3 antibody in the wild type and pho2 may be contributed mainly by PHT1;1 (Figure 5A). [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, the protein signals detected by anti-PHT1;1/2/3 antibody in pht1;1 pho2 and pht1;2 pho2 double mutants remained relatively high when compared with the pht1;1 and pht1;2 single mutants, respectively (Figure 5A), supporting that PHO2 mediates the protein abundance of more than one PHT1 member as revealed by proteomic analysis. It is also worthwhile to mention that the signal detected by the anti-PHT1;1/2/3 antibody in the pht1;1 was stronger than in the wild type (Figure 5A). We suspected that this might result from upregulation of PHT1;2 and PHT1;3 in compensation for the loss of PHT1;1 (Figure 5B). However, such effect seems to be developmental stage dependent because it was not observed in younger seedlings (12 d old) (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). Consistent with the proteomics result, immunoblot analysis of PHT1;4 showed no difference between the wild type and pho2 in the hydroponically grown samples. However, more PHT1;4 protein was accumulated in the pht1;1 pho2 than pht1;1 without any significant changes of the transcript level (Figures 5A and 5B). Additionally, without the elevated transcript level, we also detected an increase in PHF1 proteins in pht1;1 pho2 compared with pht1;1. On the basis of this comparison, we conclude that PHO2 regulates the expression of PHT1s and likely PHF1 as well at the protein level. We next examined the protein stability of PHT1s and PHF1 by applying cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein translation, to wild-type and pho2 seedlings grown under Pi-sufficient conditions. The expression of PHT1;1/2/3, PHT1;4, and PHF1 proteins in the root was examined at 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after CHX treatment. Notably, the CHX treatment resulted in a more rapid decline of PHT1;1/2/3 and PHT1;4 proteins in the wild type than in pho2 (Figures 6A and 6B), suggesting that PHO2 posttranslationally regulates these PHT1 proteins, probably via degradation. The half-life of PHT1;1/2/3 and PHT1;4 is estimated to be ∼12 h in the wild-type plant (Figure 6B). By contrast, the degradation rate of PHT1;1/2/3 and PHT1;4 in pho2 was much slower. To our surprise, the PHF1 protein was not affected by 24 h of CHX treatment in either wild-type or pho2 plants (Figure 6A). We speculate that either PHF1 proteins are relatively stable or degradation of a negative regulator of PHF1 during CHX treatment is involved. [[FIGURE]] Because of the subcellular localization of PHO2 in the ER and Golgi compartments, through which PHT1s pass prior to their final destination of the PM, we next examined the physical interaction between these proteins. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves using Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration and the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system were employed. To prevent protein degradation presumably mediated by the ubiquitin conjugase activity of PHO2, we generated a PHO2 variant (PHO2C748A) with a mutation in the conserved catalytic Cys residue in the UBC domain (CITATION). When the interaction between PHO2 and PHT1;1 or PHT1;4 was examined, the reconstitution of yellow fluorescent protein signal was observed as intracellular dots only when coexpressed with PHF1, while no signal was observed in the corresponding negative controls (Figures 7A and 7B). This indicated that PHO2 is in close proximity to these PHT1s, hinting at a possible physical interaction. A previous study showed that coexpression of PHF1 with PHT1;2 in Agrobacterium-infiltrated tobacco leaves is critical to enhancing or stabilizing the expression of PHT1;2 as well as facilitating its targeting to the PM (CITATION). It is possible that PHF1-mediated ER exit of the PHT1s is a prerequisite to the potential interaction of PHO2 with the PHT1s at the post-ER compartments. The interaction of PHO2 and PHT1;4 was also validated by the split-ubiquitin Y2H system (Figure 7D). Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the interaction of PHO2 and PHT1;1 in yeast cells for unknown reasons. We also attempted to examine the interaction between PHO2 and PHF1, but we could not draw any conclusion because of inconsistent results. Instead, we detected the interaction between PHF1 and the PHT1s in both BiFC and Y2H analyses (Figures 7C, 7E, and 7F), which corroborates the role of PHF1 in facilitating targeting of PHT1s to the PM (CITATION; CITATION). The observation of interaction of PHF1 and the PHT1s in the ER (Figure 7C) was consistent with the subcellular localization of PHF1 in the ER and its function in assisting the exit of PHT1s out of the ER (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To examine whether PHO2 mediates ubiquitination of the PHT1s, we attempted to detect in vivo ubiquitinated proteins following immunoprecipitation. Total membrane proteins isolated from the Pi-replete roots of 12-d-old wild-type, pht1;1, and pho2 seedlings were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. Whereas immunoprecipitation using anti-PHT1;1/2/3 antibody was successful, anti-PHT1;4 and anti-PHF1 antibodies produced low signal or high background after immunoprecipitation. When probed with the antiubiquitin antibody, the immunoprecipitated proteins showed a smear pattern at the higher molecular weights in the wild-type sample, indicating that the presence of polyubiquitinated or multimonoubiquitinated PHT1;1/2/3 (Figure 8A). As the smeared signal was diminished in the samples of pht1;1 and pht1;1 pho2, loss of PHT1;1 greatly contributed to the reduced intensity (Figures 8A, 8B, and 8D). The remaining signal in pht1;1 and pht1;1 pho2 may result from the ubiquitination of PHT1;2 and PHT1;3. Interestingly, we did not observe a reduction in the level of ubiquitinated PHT1;1/2/3 in pho2 compared with the wild type. Considering that the EM rather than the PM is the location where PHO2 interacts with the PHT1s (see Supplemental Figure 1A online; Figure 7), we separated the total microsomal membranes into PM and EM fractions for immunoprecipitation analysis (Figure 8B). The PM and EM fractions were separated and enriched as shown by immunoblot using their respective protein markers (Figure 8C). Whereas the protein level of PHT1;1/2/3 was increased in both the PM and EM fractions of pho2 compared with the wild type, the level of ubiquitinated PHT1;1/2/3 protein was moderately decreased in the EM but not in the PM of pho2 (Figure 8B). When we normalized the intensity of ubiquitination signals in the PM and EM fractions of the wild type or pho2 with the corresponding protein level of PHT1;1/2/3, a more prominent reduction of ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 was detected in the EM of pho2 (20% of wild-type signal) than in the PM (Figure 8B). These results support the notion that PHO2 mediates the ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 at the EM rather than the PM. [[FIGURE]] We reasoned that the ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 in the PM of pho2 is independent of PHO2 because of the absence of PHO2 in the PM. It is possible that other unidentified factors in the PM are involved in the augmented ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 to compensate for the loss of PHO2 activity in the EM as the excessive Pi accumulates throughout the growth of pho2. To minimize this secondary effect, we analyzed the root samples from much younger seedlings (6 d old). As expected, the ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 was clearly reduced in total membranes isolated from pho2 (Figure 8D). Altogether, these results reveal a role for PHO2 in mediating the ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 in the EM compartment where PHO2 and the PHT1s interact.
!~MM~! Seeds of the Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Columbia-0), pho2 (CITATION), and T-DNA insertion lines of pht1;1 (SALK_088586), pht1;2 (SALK_110194), pht1;3 (GABI_557C09), pht1;8 (SALK_056529), pht1;9 (SAIL_898_C11), and phf1 (SALK_037068) were obtained from the ABRC. Loss-of-function of these mutants was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Double mutants were generated by crossing with pho2. The double and corresponding single mutants were isolated from the F2 population for comparative analyses. Seedlings were grown under Pi-sufficient conditions using one-half modified Hoagland nutrient solution containing 250 µM KH2PO4 either on agar plates supplemented with 1% Suc or in a hydroponic culture system without Suc, as previously described (CITATION). Pi starvation treatment was performed using 10 µM KH2PO4. Application of CHX (200 µM) was performed for indicated time periods on 12-d-old seedlings grown under Pi-sufficient conditions (CITATION). The 12-d-old seedlings grown on solid agar plates supplemented with 250 µM KH2PO4 were sampled or transferred to the hydroponic culture system to grow for an additional 5 d before harvest. Three biological replicates were prepared and employed in subsequent proteomics analysis. For membrane protein extraction, roots were collected and homogenized with ice-cold 0.22-μm filtered membrane extraction buffer containing 0.33 M Suc, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The crude extract was centrifuged at 2000g at 4°C for 10 min twice. The clear supernatant was then centrifuged at 400,000g at 4°C for 30 min. To exclude the nonspecific binding of soluble and loosely associated peripheral proteins, the pellet was resuspended with ice-cold 0.22-μm filtered 1 M KCl and placed on ice for at least 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 400,000g at 4°C for 30 min. The pellet was then resuspended with ice-cold 0.22-μm filtered 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11, and placed on ice for at least 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 400,000g at 4°C. After being washed with 0.1 M Na2CO3, the pellet was dried and stored at −20°C. The gel-assisted digestion was performed following a previously described protocol (CITATION). The extracted peptides were combined, concentrated in a centrifugal evaporator, and subjected to iTRAQ labeling followed by liquid chromatography–MS/MS analysis. For details, please see the Supplemental Methods 1 online. For analyzing the subcellular localization of those identified proteins, the TMHMM Server version 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) was used to predict the number of transmembrane helices, and their function and subcellular localization were categorized by GO (http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermFinder) (CITATION). Subcellular localization of the proteins was also analyzed using SUBA (Arabidopsis Subcellular Database; http://suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/) (CITATION; CITATION). For prediction of posttranslation modification associated with membranes, the following Web resources were applied: N-terminal myristoylation (Plant-Specific Myristoylation Predictor, http://plantsp.genomics.purdue.edu/myrist.html) (CITATION), S-palmitoylation (TermiNator, http://www.isv.cnrs-gif.fr/Terminator/), C-terminal prenylation (PrePS, http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS) (CITATION), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (GPI-SOM, http://gpi.unibe.ch/). All the inserted fragments of interest were amplified and cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) for sequencing and then recombined into the desired Gateway destination vectors via Gateway®LR Clonase™II (Invitrogen). To examine subcellular localization of PHO2, the expression constructs (35S:CFP-PHO2 and 35S:Red Fluorescent Protein [RFP]-PHO2) were generated using p2CWG7 (CITATION) and pUBN-RFP (CITATION), respectively, as the Gateway destination vectors. The DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of C-terminal mCherry fusion of PHF1 was recombined into pMDC32 (CITATION) to generate the construct of 35S:PHF1-mCherry. For BiFC analysis, the coding sequences of full-length PHO2C748A, PHT1;1, PHT1.4, and PHF1 were cloned into appropriate vectors driven by the UBQ10 promoter (CITATION) as indicated in Figure 7. The full-length PHF1 coding sequence was cloned into pMDC32 (35S:PHF1), and the resulting construct was used for the coexpression with PHT1;1 and PHT1;4 in the BiFC assay. All primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. Transformations of Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts for transient expression of fluorescence fusion proteins were performed as described (CITATION). The subcellular fluorescent markers used were the same as previously described (CITATION). Briefly, AtWAK2-mCherry and GmMAN1-mCherry constructs were derived from the multicolored organelle marker set (CITATION) and obtained from the ABRC. ARA7-RFP and VTI12-TFP constructs were derived from WAVE lines (CITATION) and obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. N-ST-RFP and RFP-ARA6 were previously reported (CITATION). Confocal microscopy images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO DuoScan with LCI Plan-Neofluar ×63/1.3 Imm and Plan-Apochromat ×100/1.4 oil objectives. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 458 nm/465 to 510 nm for cyan fluorescent protein and TFP, 514 nm/520 to 550 nm for yellow fluorescent protein, and 561 nm/575 to 630 for red fluorescent protein and mCherry. The anti-PHT1;1 polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised and affinity purified against a peptide of PHT1;1 corresponding to the amino acid residues 266 to 285 (ELEERVEDDVKDPRQNYGLF) (CITATION). The anti-PHT1;4 polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised and affinity purified against an internal fragment of PHT1;4 corresponding to the amino acid residues 265 to 283 (IEPEQQKLEEISKEKSKAF). The anti-PHF1 polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised and affinity purified against the C-terminal fragment of PHF1 corresponding to the amino acid residues 453 to 471 (GSSSTPSEDHSRWNLDL). The final concentration of affinity-purified antibodies used for immunoblot analysis is 20 to 100 ng/mL. Antibodies directed against fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR1, and H+-ATPase were purchased from Agrisera, and the antibody against actin was from Millipore. For total protein extraction, roots were ground in liquid nitrogen and dissolved in protein lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5% glycerol, 0.13 mM EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Membrane proteins were isolated as described above except without the wash of KCl and Na2CO3. The pelleted membrane proteins were resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer for immunoblot analysis or in ice-cold storage buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor (Roche) for immunoprecipitation. Total microsomal membranes were separated into the PM and EM fractions by two-phase partitioning according to the previous description (CITATION). Briefly, the microsomal pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of resuspension solution (345 mM Suc and 4.8 mM K-PO4 buffer, pH 7.8). Then, 3.34 g of membrane sample was added to a phase separation solution containing 6.2% (w/w) Dextran T-500, 6.2% (w/w) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.23 M Suc, 5 mM KCl, and 3.6 mM K-PO4 buffer, pH 7.8, mixed vigorously for 10 s, and equilibrated in an ice bath for 4 min. After centrifugation at 1500g for 8 min at 4°C, the upper polyethylene glycol and bottom Dextran phases were separated, resuspended (330 mM Suc, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mM PMSF), and centrifuged (100,000g for 1 h at 4°C) to yield the PM and EM fractions, respectively. A 100-µg sample of total microsomal protein or 20 µg of PM or EM protein was resuspended in 500 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and incubated with 20 μL of magnetic beads conjugated with the anti-PHT1;1/2/3 antibody at 4°C for 1.5 h with gentle shaking (CITATION). The immunoblot analysis was performed as described (CITATION). To detect the immunoprecipitated PHT1;1/2/3 proteins, the EasyBlot anti-rabbit IgG (GeneTex) was used as the secondary antibody to reduce interference caused by heavy and light chains of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal antiubiquitin antibody (P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for detecting ubiquitinated proteins. The signals on immunoblots were detected by chemiluminescence, which was captured by a charge coupled device camera in a FluorChem HD2 image system and quantified by AlphaView SA Ver.3.3.1 (Cell Biosciences). RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR were conducted as described (CITATION). For BiFC analysis, the Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana tobacco leaves was conducted as described (CITATION) with minor modifications (CITATION). The amount of p19, a gene silencing suppressor, coinfiltrated was carefully adjusted to eliminate the false positive signal in the negative controls containing only one interaction partner (Figures 7A to 7C). Split-ubiquitin Y2H assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions provided with the DUALmembrane kit (Dualsystems Biotech). The coding region of PHF1 and PHT1;4 were cloned in frame into the bait vector pTMBV4. The full-length PHO2, PHT1;1, and PHF1 coding sequences were cloned into the prey vector pDL-Nx via BamHI and SmaI sites. Yeast strain DSY-1 cells were cotransformed with the resulting constructs and plated onto synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His. The specificity of protein–protein interactions was confirmed by chloroform overlay β-galactosidase plate assay as described (CITATION). Pi concentration and uptake activity were determined as described (CITATION).
