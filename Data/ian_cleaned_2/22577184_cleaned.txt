!~ABS~! p24 proteins are a family of type I membrane proteins localized to compartments of the early secretory pathway and to coat protein I (COPI)- and COPII-coated vesicles. They can be classified, by sequence homology, into four subfamilies, named p24α, p24β, p24γ, and p24δ. In contrast to animals and fungi, plants contain only members of the p24β and p24δ subfamilies. It has previously been shown that transiently expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ5 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a consequence of highly efficient COPI-based recycling from the Golgi apparatus. Using specific antibodies, endogenous p24δ5 has now been localized to the ER and p24β2 to the Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis root tip cells by immunogold electron microscopy. The relative contributions of the cytosolic tail and the luminal domains to p24δ5 trafficking have also been characterized. It is demonstrated that whereas the dilysine motif in the cytoplasmic tail determines the location of p24δ5 in the early secretory pathway, the luminal domain may contribute to its distribution downstream of the Golgi apparatus. By using knock-out mutants and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, it is shown that p24δ5 and p24β2 interact with each other. Finally, it is shown that p24δ5 and p24β2 exhibit coupled trafficking at the ER–Golgi interface. It is proposed that p24δ5 and p24β2 interact with each other at ER export sites for ER exit and coupled transport to the Golgi apparatus. Once in the Golgi, p24δ5 interacts very efficiently with the COPI machinery for retrograde transport back to the ER.
!~RES~! In order to localize endogenous p24 proteins in Arabidopsis, peptide antibodies against two different members of the p24 family were generated. Since previous work (CITATIONet al., 2004a , CITATIONb ; CITATIONet al., 2008) was undertaken with p24δ5 (At1g21900) (CITATION), this protein was chosen as one representative of the delta subfamily for antibody generation. Moreover, it has relatively high levels of expression in different tissues, according to gene expression data of public microarray repertoires (CITATIONet al., 2004). Antibodies were produced using peptides corresponding to both the N- and the C-terminus of p24δ5. In contrast to the N-terminus, the C-terminus of Arabidopsis p24 proteins is very similar among different members of the delta subfamily (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). In particular, the C-termini of p24δ3, p24δ4, and p24δ6 share 10–11 (out of 12) residues with the C-terminus of p24δ5, while sequence homology is lower in other members of the subfamily. Therefore, C-terminal p24δ5 antibodies may also recognize p24δ3, p24δ4, and p24δ6. According to public microarray databases, p24δ4 has expression levels comparable (although lower) with those of p24δ5, while p24δ6 expression is very low and tissue specific (no data are available for p24δ3). Antibodies against both the N- and the C-terminus of a p24 protein of the beta subfamily, p24β2 (At3g07680), were also generated (CITATION; Supplementary Fig. S1). p24 proteins were extracted from membranes of Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures or from Arabidopsis roots. As shown in CITATION, antibodies against the N-terminus of p24δ5 recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight (24 kDa) in membranes from cell suspension cultures as well as in membranes from roots. In the case of p24δ5 C-terminal antibodies, a major band of ∼24 kDa was obtained in membranes from cell suspension cultures, although a double band was detected in root membranes. To characterize the specificity of the antibodies further, available T-DNA insertion mutants for p24δ5 (p24δ5-1) and p24δ4 (p24δ4-1) were used. Both mutants were found to be knock-out mutants. In addition, the p24δ4δ5 double mutant was obtained. Plants from the three lines resembled wild-type plants under standard growth conditions, either on vertical agar plates or on soil (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). Western blot analysis with the Nt-p24δ5 antibody showed that p24δ5 was absent in root membranes from the p24δ5-1 mutant or from the p24δ4δ5 double mutant, as expected for a p24δ5 knock-out mutant, but was present (at similar levels to those in the wild type) in the p24δ4-1 mutant (CITATION). These mutants were next analysed with the Ct-p24δ5 antibody, which detected two bands in extracts from wild-type root membranes. The upper band should correspond specifically to p24δ5, as it was absent in root membranes from the p24δ5-1 mutant or from the p24δ4δ5 double mutant, confirming the results obtained with the N-terminal antibody, but was present in the p24δ4-1 mutant (CITATION). In contrast, the lower band was still present in the p24δ5-1 mutant but was almost undetectable in the p24δ4δ5 double mutant (CITATION). This suggests that the lower band detected by the Ct-p24δ5 antibody corresponds to a large extent to p24δ4, and that the Ct-p24δ5 antibody does not recognize any other abundant member of the delta subfamily in Arabidopsis roots. Finally, antibodies against both the N- and the C-terminus of p24β2 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular weight of ∼22 kDa (instead of the predicted 24 kDa) (CITATION). Characterization of p24 antibodies. (A) Characterization of antibodies against Arabidopsis p24 proteins. Protein extracts were obtained from membranes of Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures (C) or Arabidopsis roots (R), as described in the Materials and methods, and analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting with affinity-purified antibodies against the p24δ5 N-terminus, p24δ5 C-terminus, p24β2 N-terminus, and p24β2 C-terminus, or with the corresponding pre-immune sera. (B) Western blot analysis of membranes from wild-type (Col-0) or p24 knock-out mutants (p24δ5-1, p24δ4-1, or p24δ4δ5) using antibodies against the Nt or the Ct of p24δ5. A 25 μg aliquot of protein was loaded in each lane. Western blot with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control. These antibodies were used to localize endogenous p24 proteins by immunogold labelling on sections cut from cryofixed Arabidopsis roots. As shown in CITATION, the N-terminal p24δ5 antibody produced a prominent labelling on ER membranes. Occasionally, some labelling was also seen on the cis-Golgi or on putative COPI vesicles (CITATION; see also CITATION). In contrast, the N-terminal p24β2 antibody showed significantly higher labelling at the Golgi apparatus, although some labelling could also be seen at ER membranes (CITATION; see also CITATION). The C-terminal p24δ5 antibody was also used to localize endogenous p24δ proteins in p24δ5 (CITATION) and p24δ4 (CITATION) knock-out mutants. As stated above, the Ct-p24δ5 antibody should recognize p24δ5 (in the p24δ4 knock-out mutant) and p24δ4 (in the p24δ5 knock-out mutant). In both mutant lines, labelling was again found at ER membranes, but also a significant labelling at the cis side of the Golgi apparatus. The labelling obtained with the Ct-p24δ5 antibody in both mutant lines was very similar to that observed in wild-type Arabidopsis roots (CITATION), suggesting that the localization of endogenous p24δ5 or p24δ4 is not significantly affected by the absence of p24δ4 or p24δ5, respectively. p24 immunogold labelling in wild-type Arabidopsis root cells Number of micrographs analysed: 10.

It was previously demonstrated that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ5 shows a uniform signal distribution throughout the ER, both in tobacco mesophyll and in Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATIONet al., 2008), as well as in BY2 cells (CITATIONet al., 2008) and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells (CITATIONet al., 2011). Whether the dilysine motif at the cytoplasmic tail of p24δ5 is sufficient for ER localization and trafficking in the early secretory pathway, or if the luminal GOLD and coiled-coil domains could also play a role has now been investigated. To this end, RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants lacking either the GOLD or the coiled-coil domains were prepared (CITATION). These constructs were used for transient expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts, since they represent a versatile, well-characterized, and reproducible system for transient expression (CITATION; CITATIONet al., 2006; CITATIONet al., 2008). Nevertheless, the localization of the different constructs was also confirmed in Arabidopsis protoplasts (see below). As shown in CITATION, both deletion mutants localized exclusively to the ER, where they co-localized extensively with the ER marker GFP–HDEL. This suggests that the steady-state localization of RFP–p24δ5 at the ER is not dependent on the GOLD or the coiled-coil domains. A deletion mutant lacking both the GOLD and the coiled-coil domains (and thus having only the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail), RFP–p24δ5 (TM-CT) (CITATION), also localized exclusively to the ER (CITATION), indicating that the dilysine motif in the cytosolic tail constitutes the minimal requirement for the steady-state localization of RFP–p24δ5 to the ER. The same ER localization was obtained when these constructs were expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Supplementary Fig. S3A–F at JXB online). Furthermore, this ER localization was not a consequence of overexpression, since all constructs localized to the ER even at very low expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S4). It was also tested whether GOLD or coiled-coil domains were involved in anterograde ER to Golgi transport of RFP–p24δ5. To this end, the three deletion mutants were co-expressed with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant, in order to inhibit retrograde Golgi to ER transport (CITATIONet al., 2008). In this case, RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants still localized to the ER, but also to Golgi-like punctae, where they co-localized with the Golgi marker Man1–GFP (CITATION), as was the case for RFP–p24δ5 (CITATIONet al., 2008). Therefore, the GOLD and coiled-coil domains do not seem to have an influence on trafficking and localization of RFP–p24δ5 in the early secretory pathway, at least when expressed individually. RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants localize to the ER but cycle between the ER and the Golgi, whilst mutants lacking the dilysine motif are transported to the pre-vacuolar compartment and the vacuole. (A–L) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC) (A), the GOLD domain (ΔGOLD) (B), or both (TM-CT) (C) show a typical ER pattern and co-localize with the ER marker GFP–HDEL. (D–F) RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC) (D), the GOLD domain (ΔGOLD) (E), or both (TM-CT) (F) co-localize partially with Man1–GFP in Golgi-like punctae upon ARF1(Q71L) mutant expression. (G and J) An RFP–p24δ5 dilysine mutant lacking the GOLD domain (ΔGOLD, CTSS) shows a prominent vacuolar labelling but it also co-localizes partially in punctae with Golgi (ST–YFP; blue) or PVC (GFP–BP80; green) markers. (H and K) An RFP–p24δ5 dilysine mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC, CTSS) shows a weak vacuolar labelling but it also co-localizes partially in punctae with Golgi (ST–YFP; blue) or PVC (GFP–BP80; green) markers. (I and L) An RFP–p24δ5 dilysine mutant with the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (TM-CTSS) co-localizes partially with the ER marker GFP–HDEL and the Golgi marker Man1–GFP. Scale bars=5 μm. In mammals, the luminal domain of p24 proteins has been proposed to play a role in trafficking of p23 (p24α) to the cell surface (CITATION). It was previously found that RFP–p24δ5 mutants lacking the dilysine motif were no longer present at the ER but were transported downstream to the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole (CITATIONet al., 2008). Therefore, it was decided to investigate whether the GOLD and/or the coiled-coil domains could play a role in RFP–p24δ5 trafficking in the absence of the dilysine motif. To this end, RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants with a mutated dilysine motif (CTSS) lacking either the GOLD or the coiled-coil domains were prepared (CITATION). As shown in CITATION, none of these mutants was found at the ER. In contrast, they localized to the Golgi (as shown by co-localization with ST–YFP), the PVC (as shown by co-localization with GFP–BP80), and the vacuole lumen. The dilysine mutant lacking the GOLD domain had a more prominent vacuolar labelling than the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain (CITATION). This suggests that the coiled-coil domain facilitates transport of dilysine mutants to the vacuole. To quantify the contribution of the coiled-coil domain and to investigate whether transport of dilysine mutants to the vacuole correlated with their degradation, the levels of the different constructs were analysed by western blotting with an RFP antibody. As shown in CITATION, when compared with those of RFP–p24δ5, the levels of RFP–p24δ5 (CTSS) were very low, although the same amounts of DNA were used for transient expression. These data suggest that once synthesized, RFP–p24δ5 (CTSS) is degraded, probably as a consequence of its transport to the vacuole, as had been previously proposed (CITATIONet al., 2008). In contrast, the levels of the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain [RFP–p24δ5 (ΔCC, CTSS)] were significantly higher, suggesting that a reduced transport to the vacuole may correlate with a reduced degradation (CITATION). Biochemical quantitation of the expression of the different constructs. Tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were electroporated in the absence (–DNA) or the presence of 30 μg of plasmid DNAs corresponding to RFP–p24δ5 (and mutant versions) and/or GFP–p24β2. At 24 h post-electroporation, protoplasts were washed, extracted in Laemmli sample buffer, and analysed by SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide) and western blot analysis with antibodies against RFP (to detect p24δ5 and mutant versions) or the p24β2 C-terminus. Note the lower molecular weight of the RFP–p24δ5 constructs lacking the coiled-coil domain. A 30 μg aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts. Finally, a dilysine mutant lacking both the GOLD and the coiled-coil domains (RFP–p24δ5, TM-CTSS) was used. As shown in CITATION, this was the only dilysine mutant which was partially localized to the ER, showing a partial co-localization with the ER marker GFP–HDEL. It also showed co-localization with the Golgi marker Man1–GFP and eventually with GFP–BP80 (data not shown), but was rarely seen in the vacuole lumen. Altogether, it seems that the absence of the luminal domain impairs trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, and downstream to the PVC and the vacuole. The lower vacuolar labelling (and increased protein levels) obtained in the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain suggests that this domain is important in trafficking beyond the Golgi apparatus. The localization and trafficking properties of a member of the beta subfamily, p24β2 (CITATION), have also been investigated. To this end, a fusion construct similar to the one used to investigate in vivo trafficking and localization of RFP–p24δ5, but with GFP instead of RFP, was prepared (CITATION). Surprisingly, the GFP signal obtained upon expression of GFP–p24β2 appeared to be very low. However, GFP–p24β2 was not present at the ER, in contrast to RFP–p24δ5, but showed a punctate pattern, and it co-localized partially with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP, in both tobacco mesophyll (CITATION) and Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATION), but not with the PVC marker ARA6–RFP (CITATION). Localization of GFP–p24β2. (A–F) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) GFP–p24β2 (A) co-localizes partially with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP (B) in punctate structures (merged image in C). (D–F) GFP–p24β2 (D) punctae do not co-localize with the PVC marker ARA6–RFP (E) (merged image in F). (G–I) Transient gene expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. GFP–p24β2 (G) co-localizes partially with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP (H) in punctate structures (merged image in I). Arrowheads point to co-localizing signals. Scale bars=5 μm. Interestingly, when co-expressed with RFP–p24δ5, the signal of GFP–p24β2 was clearly more intense and localized to punctae. In addition, it was observed that RFP–p24δ5, which showed its typical ER pattern, also localized to the same punctae under these conditions (CITATION). An increased ratio in the concentrations of GFP–p24β2 versus RFP–p24δ5 induced a progressive change in the localization of RFP–p24δ5, from its typical reticulate ER pattern to a mostly punctated one, and increased co-localization between both proteins (CITATION; Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). This suggests that GFP–p24β2 is able to interact with RFP–p24δ5 and is transported with the latter out of the ER. This co-localization was also observed when both proteins were expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Supplementary Fig. S3G–I). GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ5 co-localize in punctae via the coiled-coil domain. (A–M) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–F) GFP–p24β2 (A and D, 50 μg) and RFP–p24δ5 (B, 50 μg; E, 10 μg) co-localize in punctate structures (see merged images in C and F). (G–I) GFP–p24β2 (G) and RFP–p24δ5 (ΔCC) (H) do not co-localize (see merged image in I). (J–M) GFP–p24β2 (J) and RFP–p24δ5 (K) show extensive co-localization with 6 kDa VP–CFP (L) in punctate structures (see merged images in M). Arrowheads point to co-localizing signals. Scale bars=5 μm. To test whether p24δ5 interacts with p24β2 via coiled-coil domains, GFP–p24β2 was co-expressed with a deletion mutant of RFP–p24δ5 lacking the coiled-coil domain (CITATION). In this case, almost no co-localization was detected between both proteins (CITATION). In addition, the signal of GFP–p24β2 was weak, as it happened in the absence of RFP–p24δ5, and RFP–p24δ5 (ΔCC) showed its typical ER pattern, without punctae, even in the presence of increasing concentrations of GFP–p24β2 (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). This suggests that both proteins interact with each other via their coiled-coil domain and that this interaction stabilizes overexpressed GFP–p24β2. To quantify whether the protein levels of GFP–p24β2 were indeed dependent on the interaction with RFP–p24δ5, protoplasts expressing these proteins were analysed by western blotting with Ct-p24β2 or RFP antibodies. As shown in CITATION, GFP–p24β2 was almost undetectable when expressed alone, but its levels increased enormously upon co-expression with RFP–p24δ5, but not with RFP–p24δ5 (ΔCC). On the other hand, the protein levels of RFP–p24δ5 seem to be independent of the presence of GFP–p24β2 (CITATION). In order to narrow down the identity of the compartment(s) where RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 co-localize, RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 were co-expressed with 6 kDa VP–CFP (cyan fluorescent protein), a putative COPII/ERES marker (CITATIONet al., 2011). As shown in CITATION, a high degree of co-localization was observed between the three proteins in punctate structures, suggesting that a fraction of RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 is present in COPII-labelled structures. Whether the observed co-localization/interaction between RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 correlated with their trafficking was next investigated. To this end, both proteins were co-expressed with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant, to interfere with retrograde Golgi to ER transport. This mutant expression has been shown to redistribute RFP–p24δ5 partially from the ER to Golgi-like punctae (CITATIONet al., 2008). However, when GFP–p24β2 was co-expressed with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant, it showed a prominent vacuolar labelling and did not co-localize with ManI–RFP (CITATION). This suggests that GFP–p24β2 localizes to the Golgi at steady state but may also cycle between the ER and Golgi. Thus, when retrograde Golgi to ER transport is blocked, the protein is then transported by default to the vacuole. In contrast, when both RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 were expressed together under the same conditions [ARF1(Q71L) mutant expression], GFP–p24β2 was not transported to the vacuole but co-localized in punctae with RFP–p24δ5 (CITATION). This suggests that RFP–p24δ5 holds back GFP–p24β2 in the ER–Golgi interface. Since both proteins co-localize in punctate structures, it was speculated that some of these punctae may correspond to Golgi stacks. To check this, protoplasts were treated with brefeldin A (BFA). After 1 h treatment, a fraction of both proteins had redistributed to the ER, as is the case for standard Golgi marker proteins, for example ManI–(X)FP, which relocate to the ER under these conditions (CITATIONet al., 2011). In contrast, many of the punctate structures were BFA resistant (CITATION) and could represent the fraction of both proteins present in COPII-labelled structures. However, it was possible to observe a redistribution of both proteins to the ER after 2 h of BFA treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7 at JXB online). Altogether, these experiments indicate that RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 traffic together at the ER–Golgi interface. Coupled trafficking of RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 at the ER–Golgi interface. (A–F) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) GFP–p24β2 (A) is transported to the vacuole upon co-expression with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant and shows no co-localization with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP (B) (merged image in C). (D–F) GFP–p24β2 (D) is not transported to the vacuole upon co-expression of the ARF1(Q71L) mutant in the presence of RFP–p24δ5 (E) but both proteins co-localize in punctate structures (see merged image in F). (G–I) Treatment with BFA (1 h, 90 μM) after co-expression of GFP–p24β2 (G) and RFP–p24δ5 (H) induces a partial relocalization of both proteins to the ER, but many punctate structures still remain (merged image in I). Scale bars=5 μm. Since the above experiments suggested an interaction between p24δ5 and p24β2, it was decided to investigate this possibility further. Previous studies where a single member of the p24 family has been deleted or knocked-down showed that the protein levels of other family members were reduced, which probably reflects the fact that those p24 proteins interact with each other in hetero-oligomeric complexes (CITATION; CITATIONet al., 1999; CITATIONet al., 2000; CITATIONet al., 2007; CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2010; CITATIONet al., 2010; CITATION). Therefore, the protein levels of p24β2 in a T-DNA mutant lacking p24δ5 (p24δ5-1) were examined. To this end, protein extracts were analysed with Nt- and Ct-p24β2 antibodies. In both cases, it was found that the levels of p24β2 in the p24δ5-1 mutant were drastically reduced (∼70%) when compared with the wild type (CITATION). These results indicate that the protein levels of p24β2 are dependent on p24δ5, suggesting an interaction between these proteins. Interaction between p24 proteins. (A) Western blot analysis showing the levels of p24β2 in membranes from the wild type (Col-0) or the p24δ5 knock-out mutant (p24δ5-1), using antibodies against the Nt or the Ct of p24β2. A 25 μg aliquot of protein was loaded in each lane. Western blot with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control. (B) Immunoprecipitation of p24δ5 and p24β2 using affinity-purified antibodies against the Ct of both proteins or control beads, followed by SDS–PAGE and western blot with antibodies against p24δ5 (Nt) or p24β2 (Ct). The extract lane contains 20 μg of the membrane proteins used as input for the immunoprecipitation. To test biochemically for a direct interaction between endogenous p24δ5 and p24β2, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. To this end, affinity-purified antibodies were covalently bound to magnetic beads and were incubated in the presence of protein extracts from membrane fractions, as described in the Materials and methods. Proteins could be immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal antibodies. Under these conditions, the corresponding proteins could be only immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal antibodies. As shown in CITATION, antibodies against the C-terminus of p24δ5 immunoprecipitated p24δ5, as shown by western blot analysis with antibodies against the p24δ5 N-terminus. More importantly, immunoprecipitates containing p24δ5 also contained p24β2. The reverse was also true: antibodies against the C-terminus of p24β2 immunoprecipitated p24β2, and these immunoprecipitates also contained p24δ5 (CITATION). These experiments again suggest that there is a direct interaction between p24δ5 and p24β2.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and T-DNA mutant plants were grown in growth chambers as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2007). For immunogold electron microscopy, seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.5% agar, and the roots were harvested after 5 d. To obtain a membrane fraction from Arabidopsis roots, seedlings were grown in liquid MS medium for 15 d. Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures (LT87) (CITATIONet al., 1992) were cultivated as described (CITATIONet al., 2006). Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum var. SR1) were grown as described (CITATIONet al., 2006). The coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–p24β2 was commercially synthesized de novo (Geneart AG) based on the sequence of GFP and that of the Arabidopsis p24 protein At3g07680 (p24β2). The sequence of the fluorophore is behind the coding sequences of the p24 signal sequence (SS) and the 5' extreme end of the mature p24 coding sequence. The ΔCC, ΔGOLD, ΔCC-CTSS, ΔGOLD-CTSS, TMCT, and TMCT-CTSS mutants of red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ5 were obtained by 3' deletion of RFP–p24δ5 and synthesis of a new sequence (CITATIONet al., 2008). The coding sequences of XFP–p24β2/δ5 were cloned into the pBP30 vector (carrying the 35S promoter, CITATIONet al., 1999) through BglII/NotI. Plasmids encoding marker proteins were: RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ5-CTSS (mutant1) (CITATIONet al., 2008), ST–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (CITATIONet al., 2002), Man1–RFP and Man1–GFP (CITATIONet al., 1999), GFP–HDEL (CITATIONet al., 2000), ARA6–RFP (CITATIONet al., 2004), GFP–BP80 (CITATIONet al., 2005), and ARF1(Q71L) (CITATIONet al., 2003). All RFP-tagged proteins were tagged with monomeric RFP (mRFP) to prevent oligomerization. Similarly, only mGFP5 was used for GFP-tagged proteins. Mesophyll protoplasts from N. tabacum var. SR1 leaf cells were isolated and transfected as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2008). Unless otherwise stated, 1–50 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected and expressed for 20 h. Protoplasts from A. thaliana (LT87) cell suspension cultures were isolated as previously described (CITATIONet al., 1992). Rabbit antibodies against different Arabidopsis p24 proteins were generated by Eurogentec (Belgium, http://www.eurogentec.com) using as antigen peptides corresponding either to the N- or to the C-terminus of the indicated proteins: p24δ5-Ct (YLKRYFHKKKLI), p24δ5-Nt (IWLTIPTTGG), p24β2-Nt (IRFVIDREE), and p24β2-Ct (LFERKLGMSRV). Affinity-purified antibodies (Eurogentec) were used for immunogold labelling as well as for covalent binding to magnetic beads in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (see below). Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope. At the Metadetector, the main beam splitters (HFT) 458/514 and 488/543 were used. The following fluorophores (excited and emitted by frame switching in the multitracking mode) were used: GFP (488 nm/496–518 nm), YFP (514 nm/529–550 nm), and RFP (543 nm/593–636 nm). To verify the co-localization of fluorescent signals obtained by fast frame switching, parallel observations were performed in the line switching mode. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8 available at JXB online, there was no difference in the localization of the fluorescent signals, thus eliminating possible false co-localization events caused by the movement of organelles. Post-acquisition image processing was performed using the Zeiss LSM 5 image Browser (4.2.0.121) and CorelDrawX4 (14.0.0.567) or ImageJ (v.1.45m). Root tips from Arabidopsis were high pressure frozen, freeze substituted, embedded, labelled, and post-stained as described (CITATIONet al., 2008). Affinity-purified antibodies were used at the following dilutions: Ct-p24β2 (1:100); Nt-p24δ5 (1:10); and Ct-p24δ5 (1:10). Micrographs were taken with a JEM1400 transmitting electron microscope operating at 80 kV using a TVIPS F214 digital camera. Membrane fractions were obtained from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures (LT87) or from Arabidopsis roots. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in homogenization buffer [50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 3 mM EDTA, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma)]. Pellets were resuspended 1:1 (v/v) in homogenization buffer and cells disrupted by sonication (4×15 s). Cell extracts were separated from unbroken cells by centrifugation (10 min at 2000 g). Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation of the extracts for 1 h at 150 000 g. Arabidopsis roots (from either wild-type or mutant plants) were homogenized in homogenization buffer using a mortar and a pestle, and membrane fractions were obtained as above. Membrane pellets were extracted using a lysis buffer containing 50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (30 min at 4 °C), and extracts were obtained after centrifugation for 5 min at 10 000 g. Protein extracts were used for SDS–PAGE followed by western blot analysis or for co-immunoprecipitation. The intensity of the bands obtained after western blot was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using magnetic beads (Dynal, Invitrogen), following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, affinity-purified antibodies were covalently bound to magnetic beads (6 μg of antibody mg−1 Dynabeads). Then 150 μl (1.5 mg) of Dynabeads (with bound antibody) were incubated with 1 ml of protein extracts from membrane fractions obtained from cell suspension cultures (10 mg ml−1) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (buffering salts, pH 2.8, Dynal). Lines (Col-0 background) containing a T-DNA insertion in p24δ4 (SAIL_664_A06, p24δ4-1) and p24δ5 (SALK_016402C, p24δ5-1) were identified from the SALK T-DNA collection (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress). They were characterized by PCR as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2007). The primers used for the p24δ4 mutant (p24δ4-1) were the following: 5′GGATCCACTTAGATCTCCTCAAAATTC3′ and 5′ATACTGTACCATGCGACTCTCGAG3′. The T-DNA left border primer used was 5′TTCATAACCAATCTCGATACAC3′. The primers used for the p25δ5 mutant (p25δ5-1) were 5′GAAGACCATCGTTGTTCTCCGATGGC3′ and 5′TTGGTGATGAAGATTGTTCCC3′. The T-DNA left border and Actin7 (ACT7, At5g09810) primers used were described previously (CITATIONet al., 2007). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of p24δ4-1 and p24δ5-1 mutants was performed as described (CITATIONet al., 2007) to show the absence of p24δ4 and p24δ5 mRNA, respectively. The primers used for PCR amplification were the same as above. To generate the double mutant, the homozygous line p24δ4-1 was crossed with the homozygous line p24δ5-1. Individuals homozygous for T-DNA insertion in both p24δ4-1 and p24δ5-1 were identified by PCR with the primers described above.
