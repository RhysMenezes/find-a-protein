!~ABS~! Previously, we screened 50 000 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana carrying a PGI::LUC+ bioluminescence reporter gene mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate for mutants with phenotypes of extensively altered circadian rhythms, and identified three loci, PHYTOCLOCK 1 (PCL1), PCL2 and PCL3, whose mutations cause arrhythmia. Here we succeeded to clone the PCL1 gene and show that the PCL1 gene encodes a novel DNA binding protein belonging to the GARP protein family and is essential for a functional clock oscillator in A. thaliana. The PCL1 gene satisfies the requirements for the clock oscillator gene: (i) pcl1 null mutations caused arrhythmia in multiple circadian outputs, including expression of potential clock genes TOC1, CCA1 and LHY, and flowering lacked a photoperiodic response; (ii) PCL1 expression showed circadian rhythm in both constant light and constant dark; (iii) over‐expression of the PCL1 gene gradually caused arrhythmicity in all the multiple circadian outputs examined; and (iv) the PCL1 gene controlled its own expression via negative feedback. Therefore, the PCL1 gene is the clock oscillator gene essential to the generation of clock oscillation in the higher plant. 
!~RES~! Although several potential clock genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, none of their null mutations cause arrhythmia (Salomé & McClung 2004). In contrast, the pcl1‐1 and pcl1‐2 mutants abolish the circadian bioluminescence rhythms of plants carrying a PGI::LUC+ reporter gene (a fusion gene connecting an Arabidopsis GI promoter to a modified firefly luciferase gene) in both constant light (LL) and constant dark (DD) (Figs 1A and 6E; Onai et al. 2004). They also show arrhythmia in leaf movement, which is distinct from the circadian output of GI expression rhythms (Onai et al. 2004). Moreover, pcl1 mutations affect photoperiodic flowering induction: wild‐type strains flowered earlier in long day than in short day, but this photoperiodic response is abolished in the mutants (Fig. 2). Since both the pcl1‐1 and pcl1‐2 mutants expressed the same phenotype for circadian rhythms and photoperiodic flowering, we elected to use mainly the pcl1‐1 mutant for our experiments.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Circadian rhythms are synchronized by environmental cues such as light/dark (LD) and high temperature/low temperature (HL) cycles (Bünning 1973; Dunlap et al. 2004). In wild‐type plants carrying the PGI::LUC+ reporter gene, bioluminescence rhythms are synchronized by both LD and HL cycles (Fig. 1B,C). They show robust rhythms that peak in the light period (evening phase) in LD cycles and the high temperature period in HL cycles. In contrast, pcl1‐1 bioluminescence showed only the diurnal rhythms driven by LD or HL transitions but not autonomous circadian rhythms (Fig. 1B,C). During LD cycles, the pcl1‐1 mutant showed a rectangle‐like bioluminescence waveform, reflecting light‐dependent expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 1B). During HL cycles, the mutant again showed a square bioluminescence waveform, reflecting temperature‐dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 1C).  The bioluminescence of the pcl1‐1 mutant carrying the PGI::LUC+ reporter gene was arrhythmic and constitutively high in LL (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with GI mRNA levels (Fig. 1D). Using Northern blot analysis to examine expression of other genes in the pcl1‐1 mutant, we found that the photosynthetic gene CAB2 (Millar et al. 1995), the potential clock genes TOC1, CCA1 and LHY, and the clock‐associated gene ELF4 were expressed arrhythmically, although mRNA levels were transiently changed on the 1st day (Fig. 1E–I). The levels of CAB2, TOC1 and ELF4 mRNA were constitutively high (Fig. 1E–G) whereas those of CCA1 and LHY were constitutively low (Fig. 1H,I). These results suggest that PCL1 is essential for the generation of circadian rhythms and that the gene controls the expression of the potential clock and clock‐associated genes.  To further analyze PCL1 function in the Arabidopsis clock, we performed map‐based cloning (Fig. 3) and identified gene At3g46640 as PCL1. Both pcl1‐1 and pcl1‐2 had a nonsense mutation (Figs 3 and 4A). The predicted PCL1 protein contained a motif (Hosoda et al. 2002) that is widely observed in plant transcription factors belonging to the GARP family, including Arabidopsis type‐B response regulators such as ARR1 (Sakai et al. 1998) and ARR10 (Imamura et al. 1999) (Fig. 4A,B). The GARP motif contains a nuclear localization signal; and ARR1 and ARR10 localize in the nucleus and bind to DNA in vitro through the GARP motif (Sakai et al. 1998; Hosoda et al. 2002). In ARR10, this motif has a Myb‐related helix‐loop‐helix structure (Hosoda et al. 2002). Because both pcl1‐1 and pcl1‐2 cause truncation of the PCL1 protein proximal to the GARP motif, arrhythmia in both mutants should exhibit a loss‐of‐function phenotype. PCL1 localized in the nucleus in onion epidermal cells, as demonstrated by transient expression of GFP (green‐fluorescent protein)‐PCL1 and PCL1‐GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 4C–H). PCL1 is therefore likely to localize in the nucleus of Arabidopsis cells and function as a transcription factor. Neither the N‐terminus nor C‐terminus of PCL1 has a homology to known proteins. However, we identified a PCL1‐LIKE (PCLL) gene in the Arabidopsis genome, a putative PCL1 homolog genes (OsPCL1) in the rice genome, and expression sequence tags (ESTs) in tobacco (NbPCL1), tomato (LePCL1), potato (StPCL1), and pine (PtPCL1) (Fig. 5).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We examined PCL1 expression under constant conditions by Northern blot analysis and by bioluminescence monitoring of plants carrying a PPCL1::LUC+ reporter gene. In LL, the level of PCL1 mRNA in wild‐type plants oscillated rhythmically in a circadian manner with peaks at subjective dusk (Fig. 6A). In pcl1‐1 mutants, in contrast, the levels were arrhythmic and constitutively high. Wild‐type plants carrying the PPCL1::LUC+ reporter gene showed robust circadian bioluminescence rhythms with a saw‐toothed waveform; the increase was rapid and the decrease was gradual (Fig. 6B). The period length of the rhythm was 23.5 ± 0.3 h (mean ± SD, n = 48), and the phase was circadian time (CT) 11.5 ± 0.3. In DD, the level of bioluminescence of the wild‐type plants decreased to about 30% of the LL level within 24 h of the light to dark transition. After 24 h, it showed robust circadian bioluminescence rhythms with a longer period length (25.9 ± 0.7 h, n = 48) than it had in LL (Fig. 6C).  Rhythmic expression of the clock oscillator gene generates circadian oscillation, and disruption of the rhythmic expression abolishes multiple circadian outputs (Ishiura et al. 1998; Dunlap 1999). We constructed PCL1‐over‐expressing (PCL1‐ox) plants carrying a PGI::LUC+ reporter gene (Fig. 7A) and examined their bioluminescence rhythms (Fig. 6D,E). In both LL and DD, the rhythms are gradually lost within four cycles and bioluminescence levels were then expressed constitutively at less than half the wild‐type level. PCL1 over‐expression also gradually caused arrhythmicity in the rhythms of leaf movement (Fig. 6F) and of the mRNA levels of GI, TOC1, ELF4, CCA1 and LHY (Fig. 7B–F) within four cycles.  [[FIGURE]] Most clock oscillator genes (for example Per and Tim in animals, frq in Neurospora and kaiC in cyanobacteria) are expressed rhythmically in a circadian manner under constant conditions and control their own expression level by negative feedback (Ishiura et al. 1998; Dunlap 1999; Young & Kay 2001; Salomé & McClung 2004). In the present study, over‐expression of PCL1 repressed endogenous PCL1 expression and disrupted its circadian expression rhythm (Fig. 6G). These results suggest that PCL1 forms an autoregulatory negative feedback loop and that oscillation of expression is essential for the Arabidopsis clock. 
!~MM~! We used bioluminescence reporter strain G‐38 carrying a PGI::LUC+ reporter gene (ecotype Col‐0) (Onai et al. 2004) as the wild‐type strain unless otherwise indicated. The pcl1‐1 and pcl1‐2 mutants were originally isolated as arrhythmic mutants 23‐15D9 and 32‐5E2, respectively, and have the G‐38 genetic background (Onai et al. 2004). We used homozygous F4 plants of the mutants. They were grown on solid MS medium at 22.0 ± 0.3 °C as previously described (Onai et al. 2004). We measured bioluminescence rhythms and leaf movement rhythms as previously described (Okamoto et al. 2005a,b,c; Onai et al. 2004). Light intensity was 70 µmol m−2 s−1 from white fluorescence lamps.  Seeds were placed in Milli‐Q water (Millipore K.K., Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C for 2 days and grown on soil at 22.0 ± 0.3 °C under long‐day (16 h light/8 h dark) or short‐day (10 h light/14 h dark) conditions. Light intensity in the light period was 100 µmol m−2 s−1 from white fluorescence lamps. We determined the flowering time by counting the number of leaves (rosette and cauline leaves) when the inflorescence was 1.5‐cm high (Ohto et al. 2001).  We crossed F3 homozygotes of the pcl1‐1 mutant (ecotype Col‐0) to Ler and used F2 homozygotes from the cross for genetic mapping. We selected the F2 homozygotes by measuring the bioluminescence in LL of plants carrying a PGI::LUC+ reporter gene and confirmed their phenotypes in F3 plants. We used publicly available cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) and simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP) as markers between Col‐0 and Ler in TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two strains released from the Monsanto Arabidopsis Polymorphism Collection (Jander et al. 2002). We examined SNPs by PCR amplification following direct sequencing of the genomic DNA. Fine mapping delimited PCL1 to a 150 kb interval between SNPs F18L15‐1 and CAPS marker TOPP5. We sequenced the 150 kb region containing PCL1 in the genomes of both the pcl1‐1 and pcl1‐2 mutants and identified the two mutations by comparing their sequences to the genomic sequences of wild‐type Col‐0 and G‐38 strains. We identified the nucleotide sequences of full‐length PCL1 cDNAs from TAIR and RIKEN (RARGE; http://rarge.gsc.riken.go.jp/) EST databases and determined PCL1 gene structure by comparison with the genomic sequence. Details are described in the legend for Fig. 3.  We constructed PCaMV35S::Ω::PCL1::sGFP(S65T)::Tnos and PCaMV35S::Ω::sGFP(S65T)::PCL1::Tnos fusion genes in the plasmid pACYC177 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and transferred them into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. After 24‐h incubation at 28.0 ± 0.5 °C in DD, we observed the localization of each GFP fusion protein with confocal laser scanning microscope (FluoView 500; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). PCaMV35S::Ω::sGFP(S65T)::Tnos cassette was derived from plasmid pTH2 (Chiu et al. 1996; Niwa et al. 1999).  The PPCL1::LUC+::Tnos reporter cassette consisted of an upstream region of PCL1 (PPCL1; nucleotides (nt) 1–1020 under accession no. AB206576), the coding region of a modified firefly luciferase gene (LUC+ Promega Japan, Tokyo), and the transcriptional terminator sequence of the Agrobacterium nopaline synthase gene (Tnos). The PPCL1::LUC+::Tnos reporter cassette was inserted into the SmaI site of binary vector pBIB‐Hyg (Becker 1990) in the same direction as an HPT (hygromycin B phosphotransferase) gene cassette, giving pBIB/PCL1::LUC+. The PCaMV35S::PCL1 cassette consisted of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (PCaMV35S; nt 4951–5815 in AF485783) derived from pBI121 (Jefferson et al. 1987) and the coding region of PCL1 (nt 997–2001 in AB206576). The PCaMV35S::PCL1 cassette was inserted just upstream of Tnos in binary vector pBIB‐Hyg (HindIII‐SmaI region) in the same direction as Tnos, giving pBIB/35S::PCL1. We transferred the T‐DNA regions of pBIB/PCL1::LUC+ and pBIB/35S::PCL1 into the genome of Col‐0 and G‐38 strains, respectively, by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens‐mediated floral dip method (Clough & Bent 1998). We selected strains containing the T‐DNA in a single locus as a homozygote by standard techniques (Weigel & Glazebrook 2002) and used homozygous T3 plants as PCL1‐bioluminescence reporter plants or PCL1‐over‐expressing (PCL1‐ox) plants.  Plants were grown on solid MS medium containing 1.5% sucrose and 0.3% gelrite for 11 days at 22.0 ± 0.3 °C in LL, exposed to three cycles of LD (12 h light/12 h dark) to synchronize the circadian clock, and returned to LL. Light intensity in the light period was 50 µmol m−2 s−1 from white fluorescence lamps. At 3‐ or 4‐h intervals, we harvested ten plants of each strain in LL and immediately froze the whole plants in liquid nitrogen. We isolated total RNA from the frozen plants using RNeasy Midi kit (QIAGEN K.K., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA (5 µg) was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde gels, blotted on to BIODYNE Plus membranes (Pall, New York, NY, USA), hybridized with 32P‐labeled gene‐specific probes with Perfect‐Hyb (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals from hybridized bands were detected and quantified with a Bio‐Image Analyzer (BAS2000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). We normalized signals against the densities of Coomassie Brilliant Blue‐stained 18S rRNA. Probes for TOC1, CCA1 and LHY were labeled with [α‐32P] dCTP as described by Makino et al. (2002). Genomic DNA fragments of GI (nt 8 064 660–8 066 052 in NC_003070), CAB2 (nt 10 474 729–10 475 025 in NC_003070), ELF4 (nt 16 741 294–16 742 019 in NC_003071), and PCL1 (nt 1021–1992 in AB206576) were labeled with [α‐32P] dCTP by the random primer method. To detect only PCL1 mRNA derived from endogenous PCL1 but not from the PCaMV35S::PCL1 transgene, we synthesized an [α‐32P] UTP‐labeled RNA probe from the 3′‐untranslated region of endogenous PCL1 (nt 1992‐2237 in AB206576) by in vitro transcription using a MAXIscript kit (Ambion KK, Tokyo, Japan).
