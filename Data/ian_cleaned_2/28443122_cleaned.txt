!~ABS~! Glucosinolates (Gls) constitute a major group of natural metabolites represented by three major classes (aliphatic, indolic and aromatic) of more than 120 chemical structures. In our previous work, soluble proteins and metabolites in Arabidopsis mutants deficient of aliphatic (myb28/29) and indolic Gls (cyp79B2B3) were analyzed. Here we focus on investigating the changes at the level of membrane proteins in these mutants. Our LC/MS-MS analyses of tandem mass tag (TMT) labeled peptides derived from the cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 relative to wild type resulted in the identification of 4,673 proteins, from which 2,171 are membrane proteins. Fold changes and statistical analysis showed 64 increased and 74 decreased in cyp79B2/B3, while 28 increased and 17 decreased in myb28/29. As to the shared protein changes between the mutants, one protein was increased and eight were decreased. Bioinformatics analysis of the changed proteins led to the discovery of three cytochromes in glucosinolate molecular network (GMN): cytochrome P450 86A7 (At1g63710), cytochrome P450 71B26 (At3g26290), and probable cytochrome c (At1g22840). CYP86A7 and CYP71B26 may play a role in hydroxyl-indolic Gls production. In addition, flavone 3â€²-O-methyltransferase 1 represents an interesting finding as it is likely to participate in the methylation process of the hydroxyl-indolic Gls to form methoxy-indolic Gls. The analysis also revealed additional new nodes in the GMN related to stress and defense activity, transport, photosynthesis, and translation processes. Gene expression and protein levels were found to be correlated in the cyp79B2/B3, but not in the myb28/29.
!~RES~! Based on the MS/MS spectra of high confidence peptides derived from the WT, cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29, we identified 4673 proteins in two independent experiments using Proteome Discover (Supplementary Table CITATION). Out of these proteins, 3,132 were identified in both experiments, while 1,076 and 465 were unique to experiments 1 and 2, respectively (Figure CITATION). A total of 4,655 proteins were available for quantification based on unique TMT labeled peptides, highlighting the high efficiency of labeling. PD enrichment analysis (based on TAIR and Uniprot annotations) of the identified proteins showed 2,171 to be membrane proteins (Figure CITATION and Supplementary Table CITATION). Comparative analysis of the protein expression changes between the mutants and WT at a fold change cutoff (>1.2 and <0.8), a p < 0.05 and transmembrane domain analysis revealed 93 proteins to be increased (Figure CITATION) and 99 to be decreased (Figure CITATION). Transmembrane domain analysis revealed that 175 out of the 192 differentially expressed proteins contained at least one transmembrane domains. The rest deemed to be membrane associated proteins (Supplementary Table CITATION). Correlating the changed proteins to those involved in Gls metabolism using STRING showed new nodes and edges (Figures CITATION, CITATION). The new nodes can be categorized according to their positions in the network as directly correlated or indirectly correlated to Gls metabolism. They can also be classified according to their biological roles as secondary (stress related) and tertiary (other biological process) connections (Detailed in next sections). Venn diagrams showing numbers of identified proteins, membrane proteins, changed proteins, and their distributions.

(C) Number of significantly increased membrane proteins in cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 relative to WT at p < 0.05 and fold change >1.2. (D) Number of significantly decreased membrane proteins in cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 relative to WT at p < 0.05 and fold change < 0.8. STRING analysis of cyp79B2/B3 changed proteins in relation to known proteins in Gls biosynthesis. Known Gls biosynthetic proteins are indicated by red balls, new proteins in the GMN are indicated by gray balls, proteins changed in both mutants are indicated by italic labeling, and uniquely changed proteins in cyp79B2/B3 are indicated by non-italic labeling. Proteins involved in Gls biosynthesis, stress and defense, and other processes are labeled with green, brown, and violet labels, respectively. Connections strength are proportional to edges thickness as derived from neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, previous experiments, and text-mining information at medium confidence score. Asterisk (*) indicates manual connections based on literature. Double asterisk (**) indicates known nodes in both mutants (Mostafa et al., CITATION), and triple asterisk (***) indicates known nodes in cyp79B2/B3 (Mostafa et al., CITATION). Full names of the mapped proteins can be found in the abbreviation and protein name columns in Tables CITATION, CITATION. STRING analysis of myb28/29 changed proteins in relation to known proteins in Gls biosynthesis. Known Gls biosynthetic proteins are indicated by red balls, new proteins in GMN are indicated by gray balls, proteins changed in both mutants are indicated by italic labeling, and uniquely changed proteins in myb28/29 are indicated by non-italic labeling.

Connections strength are proportional to edges thickness as derived from neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, previous experiments, and text-mining information at medium confidence score. Asterisk (*) indicates manual connections based on literature. Double asterisk (**) indicates known nodes in both mutants (Mostafa et al., CITATION). Full names of the mapped proteins can be found in the abbreviation and protein name columns in Tables CITATION, CITATION. Nine membrane proteins showed common changes between the two mutants relative to WT, with only one protein increased while the other eight decreased (Table CITATION). By STRING mapping of the significantly changed proteins (Figures CITATION, CITATION), we found seven of the nine proteins represented new connections with the glucosinolate metabolic network (GMN). The role of probable cytochrome c (CYC2) and plastocyanin minor isoform (PETE) in electron transport process (Pesaresi et al., CITATION; Welchen et al., CITATION) makes them biologically relevant tertiary connections in GMN in a way similar to cytochrome B5 isoform C and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5b-2 (Mostafa et al., CITATION). Photosystem I reaction center subunit IV B (PSAE2), 14-3-3-like protein GF14 nu (GRF7), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (APT1), alba DNA/RNA-binding protein (F28N24.7) and triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (APE2) form other tertiary nodes. Out of this group, APT1 was the only protein directly connected to the GMN (Figures CITATION, CITATION). List of common membrane proteins showing significant changes in cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 mutants relative to WT and their biological functions. Abbreviations for the shared proteins in Figures CITATION, CITATION. Fold change at cut-off point >1.2 or < 0.8. p < 0.05. TMDs, transmembrane domains; D, Das; H, HMMTOP; S, SOSUI; T, TMPred; M, TMHMM. Sixty-four and 74 membrane proteins showed unique increases and decreases, respectively, in the cyp79B2/B3 mutant (Table CITATION). Seventy-seven new nodes were discovered by the STRING mapping of these cyp79B2/B3 proteins to the GMN (Figure CITATION). It was obvious that perturbation of the indolic Gls metabolism affected a group of stress-related membrane proteins forming new secondary nodes. Representative examples from this group are calmodulin-like protein 12 (CML12; Cazzonelli et al., CITATION), mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 37c (MED37C; Lee et al., CITATION), SNAP25 homologous protein (SNAP33; Eschen-Lippold et al., CITATION), dynamin-related protein 1E (DRP1E; Minami et al., CITATION), protein ILITYHIA (ILA; Monaghan and Li, CITATION), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC2; Guo et al., CITATION), L-ascorbate peroxidase 3 (APX3; Narendra et al., CITATION), Ras-related protein (RABA4B; Antignani et al., CITATION), annexin D1 (ANN1; Gorecka et al., CITATION; Jia et al., CITATION), hypoxia-responsive family protein (At5g27760), and malate dehydrogenase 2 (mMDH2; Jones et al., CITATION). List of membrane proteins in the cyp79B2/B3 mutant showing significant changes relative to WT and their biological functions. Abbreviations for unique proteins in Figure CITATION. Fold change at cut-off point >1.2 or < 0.8. p < 0.05. TMDs, transmembrane domains; D, Das; H, HMMTOP; S, SOSUI; T, TMPred; M, TMHMM. The role of cytochromes P450s 86A7 (CYP86A7) and 71B26 (CYP71B26) in oxidation reduction reaction and oxygen binding (Duan and Schuler, CITATION) makes them biologically relevant tertiary nodes in the GMN (Figures CITATION, CITATION). Other interesting new tertiary nodes related to Gls metabolism include division protein FtsZ homologs 1 (FTSZ1), 2-1 (FTSZ2-1), 2-2 (FTSZ2-2), curculin-like (mannose-binding) lectin family protein (At5g18470), isoform 3 of dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex 2 (At4g26910), elongation factor Tu (TUFA), ATP sulfurylase 1 (APS1), ABC transporter B family member 26 (ABCB26), flavone 3'-O-methyltransferase 1 (OMT1), Ras-related protein (RABA4A), Ras-related protein (RABB1C), endoglucanase 10 (AT1G75680), dicarboxylate/tricarboxylate transporter (DTC), probable monodehydroascorbate reductase isoform 3 (At3g52880), vesicle transport v-SNARE 11 (VTI11), DnaJ/Sec63 Brl domains-containing protein (ATERDJ2B), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid protein transfer 6 (At1g55260). Myrosin cells (myrosinase storage sites) endocytosis is controlled by SYP22 from SNARE complex and VPS9A (Shirakawa et al., CITATION). Here the decrease of VTI11 from this family is in agreement with the reduced myrosinase, nitrile specifier protein and Gls levels in the soluble proteome (Mostafa et al., CITATION) and supports the cross talk between Gls and its hydrolyzing enzymes. Predicted positions of the directly connected nodes and connected cytochrome nodes on the glucosinolate metabolic pathway. Italic indicates proteins changed in both mutants, * indicates proteins changed in cyp79B2/B3, and ** indicates proteins changed in myb28/29. Red color means increased proteins, green color means decreased proteins. Full names of the directly connected proteins can be found in the abbreviation and protein name columns in Tables CITATIONâ€“CITATION. Out of these new nodes, 15 formed direct edges with the GMN: FTSZ1, CML12, FTSZ2-2, At5g18470, At4g26910, TUFA, MED37C, APS1, SNAP33, ILA, GAPC2, OMT1, CYP71B26, ANN1, and mMDH2 in addition to the membrane associated protein (20 kDa chaperonin, CPN21). As we detected a side network correlated to indolic GMN (Mostafa et al., CITATION), here we also found a side network strongly correlated to indolic Gls metabolism as it contains nine stress-related proteins out of eleven. These proteins are xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein 4 (XTH4; Campbell and Braam, CITATION), aquaporin PIP2-2 (Javot, CITATION; Tournaire-Roux et al., CITATION), probable aquaporin PIP1-5 (Weig et al., CITATION), aquaporin PIP2-3 (Daniels et al., CITATION), probable aquaporin PIP1-4 (Li et al., CITATION), plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1B (PIP1B; Alexandersson et al., CITATION), aquaporin PIP1-3 (Kammerloher et al., CITATION), probable aquaporin PIP2-6 (Alexandersson et al., CITATION), and aquaporin PIP2-7 (Weig et al., CITATION). Other members in this side network are bifunctional inhibitor/lipid-transfer protein (At2g45180; which has a proteolytic action) and a tetraspanin-18 (TOM2AH2) with unknown functions. Membrane proteomics of the myb28/29 mutant showed 28 and 17 proteins to be significantly increased and decreased, respectively (Table CITATION). STRING analysis of the increased and decreased myb28/29 specific membrane proteins revealed 21 new nodes in the GMN (Figure CITATION). Except for the directly connected and stress-related GTP-binding nuclear protein (RAN1; Jiang et al., CITATION), other connections including 17 ribosomal proteins [e.g., 60S ribosomal protein L14-2 (RPL14B), 40S ribosomal protein S15-1 (RPS15) and 40S ribosomal protein S15-4 (RPS15D)], and actin-11 (ACT11), ADP/ATP carrier protein 1 (AAC1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (TIF3F1) formed tertiary nodes. These tertiary nodes are connected to the GMN through two bridges (directly connected nodes) which are 60S ribosomal protein L15-1(RPL15A) and 60S ribosomal protein L13-1 (BBC1). The expression changes in ribosomal proteins reflect a correlation between aliphatic Gls perturbation and the translation process in A. thaliana. List of membrane proteins the myb28/29 mutant showing significant level changes relative to WT and their biological functions. Abbreviations for unique proteins in Figure CITATION. Fold change at cut-off point >1.2 or < 0.8. p < 0.05. TMDs, transmembrane domains; D, Das; H, HMMTOP; S, SOSUI; T, TMPred; M, TMHMM. AgriGO enrichment analysis of the changed proteins was conducted at the biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) levels. By annotating 147 changed membrane proteins in the cyp79B2/B3 using SEA, we got 302 enriched GO terms for BP (Supplementary Figure CITATION), 63 for CC (Supplementary Figure CITATION), and 47 for MF (Supplementary Figure CITATION). SEA of 54 changed membrane proteins in the myb28/29 showed 45 enriched GO terms for BP (Supplementary Figure CITATION), 56 for CC (Supplementary Figure CITATION) and 2 for MF (Supplementary Figure CITATION). SEACOMPARE of the mutant revealed 271 BP, 21 CC, and 46 MF GO terms to be enriched specifically in cyp79B2/B3, while 14 BP, 14 CC, and one MF were the specifically enriched GO terms in myb28/29 (Supplementary Table CITATION). From this BP analysis, it was obvious that responses to stimuli including abiotic, chemical and stress were highly enriched in cyp79B2/B3 in addition to transport, photosynthesis and metabolic processes. In myb28/29, the most enriched BP terms were those related to translation process. This observation supported our results concerning the stimuli and translation-related proteins in the cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29, respectively (Supplementary Table CITATION). On the level of CC, the high enrichment of membrane GO terms supported the effectiveness of our membrane preparation procedure (Supplemental Figures CITATION, CITATION). To determine whether protein level changes correlated with gene transcription changes, we examined the transcript levels of 32 and 22 genes from cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/28, respectively (Supplementary Table CITATION). The two mutants exhibited different patterns of correlation. In comparison of cyp79B2/B3 to WT, the genes investigated showed a positive correlation between transcript and protein levels in both direction and degree of expression (r = 0.6579, p = 4.269eâˆ’05; Supplementary Figure CITATION). However, in comparison of myb28/29 to WT, the genes did not show correlation between the transcript and protein levels (r = 0.0887, p = 0.6945; Supplementary Figure CITATION), only three out of the 22 genes showed similar regulation at both transcript and protein levels. For example, At4g13770 encoding cytochrome P450 83A1, exhibited down-regulation in myb28/29 compared to WT (Supplementary Table CITATION). The difference in the degree of correlation in these two mutants implies that different regulatory mechanisms are involved in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes in different genotypes (Marmagne et al., CITATION; Koh et al., CITATION).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seeds were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA). The seeds of cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 were kindly provided by Dr. John Celenza (Boston University, Boston, MA, USA) and Dr. Masami Hirai (RIKEN Plant Science Center, Yokohama, Japan), respectively. The mutant genotyping and chemotyping were reported in our previous study (Mostafa et al., CITATION). Seed germination and seedling growth were conducted as previously described (Mostafa et al., CITATION). Leaves from 5-week old wild type (WT), cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at âˆ’80Â°C. Four replicates were included per genotype, and each replicate contains 2 g leaves pooled from 12 plants. Protein was extracted according to Pang et al. (CITATION) by grinding the leaf tissues in liquid nitrogen and then homogenizing on ice in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothritol (DTT), 0.5 M sucrose, and 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The protein extracts were filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged again at 100,000 g for 1.5 h at 4Â°C. The formed microsomal membrane was washed with 100 mM sodium carbonate using a glass dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1.5 h at 4Â°C. The microsome pellets were rinsed with 500 Î¼l resuspension buffer containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7), 1% triton X-100 and 0.5 M sucrose, and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. Protein was precipitated using 5 volumes ice cold 90% acetone overnight at âˆ’20Â°C, followed by washing the pellets once with ice cold 90% acetone and twice with ice cold acetone before solubilizing in 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 0.25% Triton X-100. The protein amount was assayed using an EZQ assay kit (Invitrogen Inc., Eugene, OR, USA). A total of 50 Î¼g protein from each replicate was precipitated with ice cold 90% acetone at âˆ’20Â°C overnight, followed by 20,000 g centrifugation at 4Â°C for 15 min. After washing with ice cold 90% acetone, the pellets were solubilized, reduced, alkylated and digested with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a 1:25 (w/w) ratio for 16 h at 37Â°C, followed by TMT labeling according to the TMT 6-plex kit manual (Thermo Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The WT replicates were labeled with 126 and 127 tags, cyp79B2/B3 replicates with 128 and 129 tags and myb28/29 replicates with 130 and 131 tags at room temperature for 2 h. After quenching with 8 Î¼l 5% hydroxylamine for 30 min, the labeled samples were combined and lyophilized. Two independent experiments and four biological replicates each sample were performed. The TMT labeled peptides were desalted on Macrospin C-18 reverse phase mini-column (The Nestgroup Inc., Southborough, MA, USA) and fractionated using an Agilent HPLC 1260 strong cation exchange system as previously described (Mostafa et al., CITATION). A total of 12 fractions were collected from each experiment. Each fraction was lyophilized, solubilized in solvent A (0.1% formic acid and 3% acetonitrile), and analyzed using an Easy-nLC 1000 system coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Plus MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) according to Mostafa et al. (CITATION) with minor modifications: The mobile phase gradient was ramped from 2 to 30% of solvent B (0.1% formic acid and 99.9% acetonitrile) in 57 min, then to 98% of solvent B in 6 min and maintained for 12 min. Mass analysis was performed in positive ion mode with high collision dissociation energy. The scan range was 400â€“2,000 m/z with full MS resolution of 70,000 and 200â€“2,000 m/z with MS2 resolution of 17,500. The first mass was fixed at 115 m/z, and 445.12003 m/z (polysiloxane ion mass) was used for real-time mass calibration. The MS data were searched using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) against the Arabidopsis TAIR10 database with 35,386 entries. The searching parameters were set to 300 and 5,000 Da as minimum and maximum precursor mass filters, digestion with trypsin with two missed cleavages, Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a static modification, and TMT6plex of N terminus, TMT6plex of lysine, phosphorylation of STY (serine, threonine, and tyrosine) and methionine oxidation were set as dynamic modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was 0.01 Da, spectrum grouping maximum retention time difference was 1.1 and false discovery rate was 0.01 at the peptide level. Proteins quantification based on labeled unique peptides intensities and statistical analyses were performed as previously described (Chen et al., CITATION; Mostafa et al., CITATION; Sun et al., CITATION). The proteomics data were deposited to ProteomeXchange repository (accession number: PXD005781). The relationship between the significantly changed proteins and Gls metabolic pathways (Chen et al., CITATION; Mostafa et al., CITATION) was analyzed using STRING bioinformatics tool (BaldrianovÃ¡ et al., CITATION; Ji et al., CITATION; Lim et al., CITATION). The resulted networks were visualized in the confidence view relying on gene neighborhood, fusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, literature, and available data. To determine the enriched pathways, we performed Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA) for the changed proteins and the results were compared using a cross comparison of SEA (SEACOMPARE) in the agriGO database (Silva-Sanchez et al., CITATION). To determine whether protein expression levels were correlated with transcript levels, we conducted qRT-PCR of 44 genes selected based on the proteomics data (32 for cyp79B2/B3 and 22 for myb28/28). This list of primers used in qRT-PCR is provided in Supplementary Table CITATION. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and cDNA was synthesized with ProtoScriptÂ® II Reverse Transcriptase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). qRT-PCR was performed with VeriQuest SyBr and a fluorescein kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as described previously (Koh et al., CITATION). For each reaction, three technical and three biological replicates were included. Relative expression of the target genes was calculated using the comparative Ct method (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, USA). The differences in Ct values (Î”Ct) between the target gene and two internal controls (AT4G34270 and AT5G44200) were calculated to normalize differences in the starting materials. The expression ratios of cyp79B2/B3 and myb28/29 to WT were calculated and compared to the ratios from the protein data using Pearson's r.
