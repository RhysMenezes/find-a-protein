!~ABS~! The ER body is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelle. Because ER bodies are induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in rosette leaves, they might be responsible for defense systems. Recently, we isolated nai1 mutants that have no ER body and showed that the levels of PYK10 and PBP1 (PYK10-binding protein 1: At3g16420) were decreased in nai1 mutants. PYK10 is a β-glucosidase that is localized in ER bodies. PBP1 consists of two repeated regions, each of which is highly homologous to the α-chain of jacalin, a carbohydrate-binding protein (lectin) of Artocarpus integriforia. We show in this study that PYK10 has two forms, an active form and an inactive form. The amount of active form increased during incubation of root homogenate. On the other hand, PYK10 separated into soluble and insoluble forms. Active PYK10 molecules mainly occurred as the insoluble form and inactive PYK10 molecules remain soluble. This suggests that the activation of PYK10 needs polymerization. In homogenates of both a pbp1 mutant and the wild type, PYK10 becomes insoluble, while PYK10 activity in pbp1 is only half of that in the wild type. PBP1 has an ability to interact with PYK10. Nonetheless, PBP1 does not bind active PYK10. These results suggest that PBP1 has some effect on the activation of PYK10. In addition, PBP1 was found to have a different subcellular distribution from PYK10. PBP1 may act like a molecular chaperone that facilitates the correct polymerization of PYK10, when tissues are damaged and subcellular structures are destroyed by pests.
!~RES~! A computational analysis had predicted that PBP1 is localized in the cytosol. To clarify the subcellular localization of PBP1, 7-day-old GFP-h seedlings were subjected to differential centrifugation. Equal volumes of each fraction were subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by an immunoblot analysis with anti-PYK10 and anti-PBP1 antibodies. PBP1 was found in several fractions but was most concentrated in the S100 fraction (Fig. 1A). This provides further evidence that PBP1 is a cytosolic protein because cytosolic proteins are known to be concentrated in the S100 fraction. On the other hand, PYK10 was most concentrated in the P1 fraction, which is the fraction that contains the highest concentration of ER bodies. No PYK10 was found in the S100 fraction. This result was supported by immunofluorescent staining of the P1 fraction. ER bodies in the P1 fraction were stained with anti-PYK10 antibody, but not with two kinds of anti-PBP1 antibodies (PBP1-N and PBP1-C) (Fig. 1B). These results show that the subcellular distribution of PBP1 is different from that of PYK10. To determine whether PBP1 interacts with PYK10, we attempted to immunoprecipitate PBP1 with anti-PYK10 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2 shows that PBP1 was co-precipitated with PYK10. When pre-immune serum was used, PBP1 was not co-precipitated. Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining showed that the immunoprecipitate was mainly composed of 65 kDa PYK10 and 35 kDa PBP1 (data not shown). These results indicate that PBP1 interacts with PYK10. We found that PYK10 was selectively precipitated by centrifugation of root homogenates (Fig. 3A). This raised the possibility that PYK10 forms a large complex. To examine this possibility, the pellet after centrifugation was subjected to SDS–PAGE with or without 2-mercaptoethanol followed by CBB staining. A 65 kDa major protein was detected under reducing conditions, and an ∼180 kDa major protein was found under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3A). Roots of nai1-1 GFP-h plants, which express no PYK10, had neither the 65 kDa band nor the ∼180 kDa band (Fig. 3A). The 65 and ∼180 kDa bands were recognized by anti-PYK10 antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that the 65 kDa band corresponds to PYK10 and the ∼180 kDa band contains PYK10. To determine the composition of the ∼180 kDa PYK10 complex, we subjected the pellet from the Col-0 root homogenate to two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE/SDS–PAGE). For the first dimension, the pellet was electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions. The gel was then incubated with 2-mercaptoethanol to reduce proteins and run in the second dimension. The gel was stained with either CBB or anti-PYK10 antibody. The CBB-stained gel revealed a single spot that migrated as an ∼180 kDa complex in the first dimension (under non-reducing conditions) which then separated into two spots, a 65 kDa major spot and a 42 kDa weak spot, in the second dimension under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). An immunoblot analysis with anti-PYK10 antibody showed that the 65 kDa spot was PYK10 and that the 42 kDa spot was a degraded product of PYK10 (Fig. 3C). This result indicated that the ∼180 kDa PYK10 complex consists of 65 kDa PYK10 alone. To determine how many molecules of PYK10 form the ∼180 kDa PYK10 complex, we performed a cross-link experiment with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). The pellet of root homogenate after 3 h incubation was treated with different concentrations of DSS, and then subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. As the concentration of DSS increased, two bands of ∼190 and ∼260 kDa appeared (Fig. 3D, left). Two weak bands of 70 and 75 kDa were DSS-conjugated PYK10 monomer. No significant bands were detected between 65 and ∼190 kDa. This means that the ∼190 kDa band corresponded to a PYK10 homodimer linked by DSS. The ∼260 kDa band implies that PYK10 formed a larger multimer. Immunoblot analysis with anti-PBP1 antibody revealed that the ∼190 and ∼260 kDa complexes did not contain PBP1 (Fig. 3D, right). A portion of PYK10 in a plant homogenate was easily precipitated by weak centrifugation (20,000×g for 3 min). This suggests that PYK10 formed insoluble complexes. To analyze the complexes, the pellet of a root homogenate was subjected to 2D electrophoresis [BN (blue native)/SDS–PAGE] followed by an immunoblot analysis. No difference was observed in the protein profiles between Col-0 and nai1-1 on the 1D gel of BN-PAGE (Fig. 4A). However, some differences were detected on the silver-stained gel of 2D SDS–PAGE. Two horizontally broad signals were detected on the 2D gel for Col-0 (Fig. 4B, open and closed triangles), but not on the gel for nai1-1 (data not shown). The upper signal corresponded to PYK10 (Fig. 4C), and the lower one corresponded to PBP1 (Fig. 4D). CBB staining showed that the amount of PBP1 was far less than that of PYK10 (data not shown). The sizes of the large complexes of PYK10 were estimated to be >1,000 kDa (Nijtmans et al. 2002). These results indicate that PYK10 forms insoluble complexes. PYK10 was detected starting from the origin to the 100–200 kDa front. It is probably because of the degradation of the large complexes of PYK10 during the sample preparation and the BN-PAGE. PBP1 was detected in mainly two populations; the fast-migrating population (closed bar, Fig. 4D) and the slow-migrating population (open bar, Fig. 4D) on the 1D BN-PAGE. The fast-migrating population might correspond to PBP1 monomer. The slow-migrating population might interact with PYK10 during the sample preparation and BN-PAGE. We found that, as the root extracts were incubated longer, the amount of PYK10 in the pellet increased, and the amount of PYK10 in the supernatant decreased, as shown in Fig. 5A (upper) and C. To understand how PBP1 affects the solubility of PYK10, we examined the insolubility of PYK10 in extracts from the pbp1 mutant that had a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of the PBP1 gene. pbp1 did not express PBP1 in roots (Fig. 5B, lower) and expressed the same amount of PYK10 as Col-0 (data not shown). In pbp1 root extract, the amount of PYK10 in the pellet increased during incubation as in the Col-0 root extract (Fig. 5A, lower; D). PBP1 was barely detectable in the pellet by immunoblot analysis with anti-PBP1 antibody (Fig. 5B, upper; E). The amount of PBP1 in the pellet of Col-0 did not change dramatically during the incubation. The amounts of PYK10 in the pellet and supernatant changed during incubation of root homogenates of both Col-0 and pbp1 (Fig. 5). Next, we examined how the enzymatic activity of PYK10 in the pellet and supernatant changes during incubation. PYK10 has been shown to have both β-d-glucosidase activity and β-d-fucosidase activity (Matsushima et al. 2004). Therefore, we measured both activities as ‘PYK10 activity’ (Fig. 6A–D). During incubation of root homogenates of Col-0, PYK10 activity increased in the pellet (black bars in Fig. 6E) and decreased in the supernatant (white bars in Fig. 6E). Similar changes were observed in pbp1 (Fig. 6F). The amount of PYK10 protein in the pellet (Fig. 5C, D) correlates with the PYK10 activity (Fig. 6E, F). PYK10 activity in the pbp1 extract was approximately half of that in Col-0. Total PYK10 activity, which was the sum of activities in the pellet and supernatant, increased by ∼50% during incubation of root extracts from both Col-0 and pbp1. Although a significant amount of PYK10 protein remained in the supernatant, PYK10 activity was barely detectable in the supernatant after 24 h incubation (Fig. 5C, D, 6E, F). These results indicate that PYK10 has active and inactive forms. There is a possibility that native substrates in the supernatant act as competitive inhibitors of PYK10 activity. To exclude this possibility, we analyzed the effect of boiled supernatant which has no PYK10 activity (Table 1). We added different amounts of the boiled supernatant to the pellet, and measured the PYK10 activity. The PYK10 activities did not decrease, indicating that the boiled supernatant did not inhibit the PYK10 activity. This means that there were not significant inhibitors of PYK10 activity in the supernatant. PYK10 activity in the pellet did not increase after incubation without the supernatant (data not shown). This shows that the increase of the activity in the pellet is not caused by activation of PYK10 in the pellet but by precipitation of PYK10.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) were used as wild-type plants. GFP-h is an A. thaliana (ecotype Col-0) transformed with the Pro35S:SP-GFP-HDEL gene encoding SP–GFP–HDEL, which is composed of the signal peptide of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) 2S albumin and GFP followed by an ER-retention signal, HDEL (Mitsuhashi et al. 2000, Hayashi et al. 2001). The nai1-1GFP-h plant was an ER body-deficient mutant isolated from mutagenized GFP-h plants (Matsushima et al. 2003b, Matsushima et al. 2004). We crossed nai1-1GFP-h with Col-0 to obtain F2 progeny, and isolated the nai1-1 mutant that expressed no GFP by inspecting the seedlings of F2 progeny with a fluorescence microscope and by immunoblot analysis of the seedlings with anti-PYK10 antibody. In this study, we used the nai1-1 without the GFP transgene except in Fig. 3A. pbp1, in which a T-DNA was inserted into the At3g16420 gene, was isolated from the Arabidopsis (ecotype Col-0) T-DNA insertion mutant line (salk_096213) that was provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Seeds were surface sterilized and then sown onto 0.5% (w/v) Gellan Gum (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) with MS medium (Wako) and 1% (w/v) sucrose and were grown at 22°C under continuous light conditions. To prepare anti-PBP1 antibody, a peptide derived from PBP1, CYDKSPEEVTGEEHGK, was chemically synthesized with a peptide synthesizer (model 431A; Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Cross-linking of the peptide with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and immunization of rabbit were conducted as described previously (Matsushima et al. 2003b). This antibody was named as anti-PBP1-C. We had reported another anti-PBP1 antibody as anti-At3g16420 antibody (Matsushima et al. 2004). This antibody was named anti-PBP1-N. The sample solution for SDS–PAGE was prepared in SDS sample buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol]. After SDS–PAGE, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Milipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was thoroughly dried for blocking and then incubated in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 with the antibodies for 1 h. Dilutions were as follows: anti-PYK10(IM), 1 : 30,000 (v/v) (Matsushima et al. 2003b); anti-PBP1-N, 1 : 15,000 (v/v) (Matsushima et al. 2004); and anti-PBP1-C, 1 : 15,000 (v/v). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) was diluted (1 : 5,000) to be used as a second antibody. Immunodetection was performed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of bands were quantified densitometricaly. All procedures were performed on ice or at 4°C using ice-cold buffers. Protein G–Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for the precipitation of IgG was incubated in PBST blocking buffer [137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20] containing 5% (v/v) sheep serum (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA, USA) for >2 h before use. Seven-day-old wild-type seedlings (1 g) were homogenized in 3 ml of PBST buffer. After centrifugation at 2,000×g for 10 min to remove debris, the supernatant was incubated for 26 h and then centrifuged again at 2,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant (970 µl) was incubated with 30 µl of protein G–Sepharose (50% slurry) and incubated for 8 h. Protein G–Sepharose was then removed by centrifugation to discard proteins that were bound non-specifically. The supernatant (400 µl) was incubated with 20 µl of IgG fractions purified from anti-PYK10 (IM) or pre-immune serum (Matsushima et al. 2004) for 12 h. Protein G–Sepharose (40 µl, 50% slurry) was added to the sample and incubated for 2 h. Protein G–Sepharose was then precipitated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of PBST buffer and centrifuged again. This washing step was repeated twice more. The final pellet was resuspended with 70 µl of the SDS sample buffer and incubated at 99°C for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged and the 12.5 µl of supernatant was subjected to SDS–PAGE (10% gel) followed by the immunoblot analysis. The seedlings (1.2–2.0 g) were chopped with a razor blade in a Petri dish on ice with 3.6–6.0 ml of chopping buffer that contained 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.4 M sucrose and protease inhibitor cocktail (one tablet per 50 ml, Boehringer Mannheim, Tokyo, Japan). The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth. An aliquot of the filtrate was used as the total fraction. A 2 ml aliquot of the filtrate was centrifuged at 1,000×g at 4°C for 20 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of chopping buffer and was designated as the P1 fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 8,000×g at 4°C for 20 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of chopping buffer and was designated as the P8 fraction. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000×g at 4°C for 1 h. The pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of chopping buffer and was designated as the P100 fraction. The supernatant was designated as the S100 fraction and the volume of the fraction was measured. To compare the relative distribution of PYK10 and PBP1, 0.8% (v/v) of each fraction was subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies against each of PYK10 and PBP1 (see below). The P1 pellet obtained from 8-day-old GFP-h seedlings was resuspended in fixing buffer containing 1.0% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA and 0.4 M sucrose. The P1 fraction in the buffer was incubated at 4°C on poly l-lysine-coated slides (POLY-PREP SLIDES; Sigma Diagnostics, St Louis, Mo, USA). After fixing, the slides were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM KH2PO4) plus 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 6 h. The slides were incubated in blocking buffer of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% sheep serum (CHEMICON) for 10 h. The slide was incubated with the anti-PYK10 or anti-PBP1 antibodies or the pre-immune serum (diluted 1 : 1,000 in blocking buffer) for 6 h at 4°C. After washing with blocking buffer for 15 min, the slides were incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 3 h. Dilution of secondary antibodies was 1 : 1,000. After washing for 15 min, the slides were examined with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). We used filter sets for GFP fluorescence (an excitation filter BP450–490, a diachronic mirror FT510 and a barrier filter BP515–565; Carl Zeiss) and sets for rhodamine fluorescence (an excitation filter BP546, a diachronic mirror FT580 and a barrier filter BP590; Carl Zeiss). The fluorescent images were analyzed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Seven roots of 20- to 25-day-old Col-0 or pbp1 were homogenized in 700 µl of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and were filtered through a 5 µm filter (low-binding Durapore polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Ultrafree-CL; Milipore). The flow-through fraction was designated as total extract. Each 100 µl of the total extract was incubated at 22°C for 0, 1, 3, 6, 16 or 24 h. After incubation, the total extracts were centrifuged at 20,000×g at 22°C for 3 min. The pellet was re-suspended by 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) of equal volume to the supernatant. The activities of the supernatant and the pellet were measured. The supernatant and the precipitate were subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by either CBB staining or immunoblot analysis. The supernatant and the pellet prepared as described above were used for the measurement of PYK10 activity. Protein concentration of the total extract was determined using the advanced protein assay reagent (Cytoskelton, Denver, CO, USA). We used a fluorescent substrate: 4-MU β-d-glucopyranoside (Seikagaku-kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) for β-d-glucosidase and 4-MU β-d-fucoside (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) for β-d-fucosidase. A 10 µl aliquot of the supernatant or the re-suspended pellet was added to 10 µl of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 170 µl of 59 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The solution was incubated at 35°C for 3 min. A 10 µl aliquot of 20 mM substrate was added to the solution. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 35°C using GENious (TECAN, Mannedorf, Switzerland) for kinetic analysis. The fluorescence was monitored under an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. Five roots of 22-day-old Col-0 were homogenized in 500 µl of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and were filtered through a 5 µm filter (Ultrafree-CL). The flow-through fraction was incubated at 22°C for 3 h, and was centrifuged at 20,000×g at 22°C for 3 min to obtain the pellet. The pellet was re-suspended in the various concentrations (0, 0.07, 0.7 and 35.0 mM) of DSS (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), and was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. They were subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-PYK10 antibody. Five roots of 22-day-old Col-0 or nai1-1 were homogenized in 500 µl of sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and were filtered through a 5 µm filter (Ultrafree-CL). The filtrates were incubated for 3 h and were centrifuged at 20,000×g at 22°C for 3 min. The pellets were re-suspended in 50 µl of sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and were subjected to BN-PAGE and SDS–PAGE without 2-mercaptethanol for the first dimension. BN-PAGE was carried out as described in Nijtmans et al. (2002), except that aminocapronic acid was not used. The first dimension gel was excised with a razor and rotated 90° counterclockwise. The gel strip was incubated in dissociating solution [1% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in distilled water] for 1 h. The dissociated gel strip was placed on a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, and SDS–PAGE was performed. The second dimension gel was used for immunoblot analysis or silver staining. For silver staining, the gel was treated with deampholyte buffer [50% (v/v) methanol and 7% (v/v) acetic acid] for 16 h. Silver staining was performed by the method of Yan et al. (2000).
