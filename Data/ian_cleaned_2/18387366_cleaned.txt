!~ABS~! We previously searched for interactions between plant telomere-binding proteins and found that AtTRB1, from the single-myb-histone (Smh) family, interacts with the Arabidopsis POT1-like-protein, AtPOT1b, involved in telomere capping. Here we identify domains responsible for that interaction. We also map domains in AtTRB1 responsible for interactions with other Smh-family-members. Our results show that the N-terminal OB-fold-domain of AtPOT1b mediates the interaction with AtTRB1. This domain is characteristic for POT1- proteins and is involved with binding the G-rich-strand of telomeric DNA. AtPOT1b also interacts with AtTRB2 and AtTRB3. The central histone-globular-domain of AtTRB1 is involved with binding to AtTRB2 and 3, as well as to AtPOT1b. AtTRB1-heterodimers with other Smh-family-members are more stable than AtTRB1-homodimers. Our results reveal interaction networks of plant telomeres.
!~RES~! We have shown previously that the telomere-binding proteins AtTRB1, AtTRB2, and AtTRB3 form homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes in Y2H assays CITATION. These proteins are similar to each other at the level of amino acid sequence and belong to the same family of Smh proteins CITATION. In contrast to other myb-like telomere-binding proteins, in Smh proteins the myb-like domain is N-terminal. The myb-like domain is followed by GH1/GH5 histone globular domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (CITATIONA). Interactions of AtTRB proteins were expected to be mediated by the C-terminal coiled-coil domain because this domain supports protein oligomerization CITATION. Therefore, we designed two deletion mutants AtTRB1 F1R (aa position 101–300) and AtTRB1 F2R (196–300) that comprised the C-terminus. Each construct was transformed into PJ69-4a two-hybrid strain and crossed with PJ69-4α containing full-length (FL) AtTRB constructs. Only AtTRB1 F1R construct containing both coiled-coil and GH1/GH5 histone globular domain supported the growth of PJ69-4 diploid strain on -Ade plates (CITATIONA, top panel), suggesting that the interactions are not mediated by the coiled-coil region. Instead, interactions between all three AtTRB proteins and fragments containing the GH1/GH5 histone globular domain were observed, in particular AtTRB1 FR1 (1–201), AtTRB1 F01R1 (58–201) and AtTRB1 F1R1 (101–201). Fragments containing truncated or completely deleted GH1/GH5, as in the AtTRB1 FR2 (1–106), AtTRB1 F01R12 (58–159) and AtTRB1 FR12 (1–159) constructs, lost the interaction with AtTRB1, as well as with the other AtTRB proteins. Thus, the shortest AtTRB1 fragment displaying the interaction with AtTRB proteins is F1R1 (101–201), which contains a GH1/GH5 domain and short flanking regions (CITATIONA, middle panel). The PJ69-4 cells containing the F1R1 construct were also grown on -His plates with increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,3-triazol (3-AT) to compare binding affinities to different AtTRB proteins (data not shown). At 2mM 3-AT only the interactions of F1R1 with AtTRB2 and AtTRB3 were detected (CITATIONA, bottom panel). To verify these results we used another two-hybrid strain (MaV203 strain has His3-reporter gene under a less tightly controlled promoter). When the full-length AtTRB1 or its FR1 fragment (covering both myb-like and GH1/GH5 domains) was used in the His-reporter assay, interactions with all three AtTRB proteins were positive up to 5mM 3-AT. A further increase of 3-AT to 20mM resulted in a loss of interaction with AtTRB1, while keeping interactions with AtTRB2 and 3 (CITATION). Altogether, these data suggest that heterotypic complexes of AtTRB1 are more stable than homotypic ones. To test the above Y2H results by an independent approach, co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assays were performed with the above AtTRB1 fragments. In particular, interactions were assayed between F1R1 and the three AtTRB proteins. CITATIONB shows that the myc-tagged AtTRB2 and AtTRB3 proteins are able to pull-down the F1R1 fragment while the full-length AtTRB1 is not. These results confirm a low affinity of the GH1/GH5 domain of AtTRB1 to full-length AtTRB1 (insufficient to provide a positive result in CoIP) and a higher affinity to both AtTRB2 and AtTRB3. The protein AtPOT1b is thought important for “chromosome capping” in A. thaliana and interactions previously detected with AtTRB1 may be of functional significance CITATION. CITATIONA shows that the interaction of AtPOT1b is not limited to AtTRB1, but also occurs with AtTRB2 and AtTRB3 proteins (CITATIONA). For mapping the interaction between the AtTRB1 and AtPOT1b the same AtTRB1 fragments in PJ69-4a cells (see CITATIONA) were crossed with PJ69-4α cells containing full-length AtPOT1b. Only the diploid cells with AtTRB1 fragments containing the GH1/GH5 domain grow on -Ade plates (CITATIONB and D; data not shown). These results suggest a role of the GH1/GH5 domain in binding to AtPOT1b. CoIP assays were performed using the FR1 fragment of AtTRB1 and the full-length AtPOT1b. The FR1 fragment co-precipitated with the myc-tagged AtPOT1b protein (CITATIONC). This positive result confirms the above findings obtained by Y2H. In the case of AtPOT1b the following fragments were generated and cloned into pGBKT7: POT1b F2R (135–454), POT1b FR4 (1–150) and POT1b FR5 (1–90). The PJ69-4a cells containing AtTRB1 fragment F1R1 were cotransformed with full-length (FL) and/or fragments of AtPOT1b. Only transformants containing FL, FR4 and FR5 fragments grew on -Ade plates (CITATIOND), however, a weak self-activation can be seen with fragment FR4 on the control plate. When these cells were grown on -His plates with increasing concentrations of 3-AT the addition of 3-AT to 5mM concentration abolished the self-activation of FR4 whilst keeping its specific interaction with the F1R1 fragment of AtTRB1 (CITATIOND, right panel). These results suggest that the AtTRB1-AtPOT1b interaction is mediated by the binding of GH1/GH5 domain of the AtTRB protein to the N-terminus (bearing the OB-fold domain) of the AtPOT1b protein.
!~MM~! An overview of cloned candidate telomeric DNA-binding proteins is given in CITATION . cDNA sequences of AtTRB1, AtTRB2, AtTRB3 and AtPOT1b have been cloned as described previously CITATION. To localize the interaction domains the deletion forms of AtTRB1 and AtPOT1b were generated by PCR and cloned into the vector pGBKT7 or pGADT7, respectively. Sequence-specific primers with restriction sites were used for cloning individual cDNAs as shown in CITATION . To localize the interaction domain(s) in AtTRB1, cDNA fragments were cloned in pGADT7 and denominated according to primers used (for example, the fragment F1R1 was generated using TRB1 F1 as forward and TRB1 R1 as reverse primers – see Figs. CITATION B). Similarly, AtPOT1b fragments were generated to localize the region of AtPOT1b responsible for interaction with AtTRB1 (see CITATIONC). Prior to two-hybrid screening, cloned constructs were checked for the correct reading frame and absence of mutations by DNA sequencing on an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer (Perkin–Elmer). Two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PJ69-4a and PJ69-4α were used CITATION. Protein AtPOT1b, its deletion variants and AtTRB2, AtTRB3 were expressed from the yeast vector pGBKT7 in strain PJ69-4α, and AtTRB1 and its fragments from vector pGADT7 in strain PJ69-4a. This division enabled proper combining of the proteins and their deletion variants in interaction assays. Both strains, identical except for the mating type, were mixed on Petri-dishes with YPD medium (1.1% yeast extract, 2.2% bacteriological peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar) to fuse yeast haploid cells of different strains, and incubated at 30 °C for 8–10h. The diploid cells were printed by velvet stamp onto control -Leu,-Trp selective plates (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 0.12% amino acid mixture without Leu and Trp, 2% agar, pH adjusted by NaOH to 6.8) and then onto -Ade selective plates to test the interaction (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 0.12% amino acid mixture without Ade, 2% agar, pH adjusted by NaOH to 6.8) and were incubated at 30 °C for a few days until colonies had grown. Alternatively, PJ69-4a cells were cotransformed with both pGBKT7 and pGADT7 plasmids and grown on -Leu,-Trp plates. Colonies were inoculated into YPD liquid medium and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Ten-times diluted aliquots were dropped onto both -Ade and -His plates. For a semi-quantitative test, 5μl aliquots were dropped onto selective -His plates containing increasing concentrations of 3-aminotriazol (3-AT). As the 3-AT inhibits His3 activity, the ability of yeast cells to grow on higher concentrations correlates with the higher binding affinity of the hybrid proteins. To verify our results we also used the yeast strain MaV203, where the His3-reporter gene is under a less tightly controlled promoter (Invitrogen). The drop test was executed in the similar way as with the PJ69 strain. Proteins were co-expressed from the same constructs as were used in Y2H system with an hemagglutinin tag (pGADT) or a myc-tag (pGBKT) by use of the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in 15–25μl of each reaction according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For Myc pull-down experiments, 15–25μl of in vitro-expressed proteins in total volume of 100μl of HEPES buffer (25mM HEPES, 150mM KCl, 50mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1mM DTT, 2mM PMSF, 2μg/μl leupeptine, 1μg/μl pepstatine) were mixed with 1μg anti-Myc-tag polyclonal antibody (Abcam) and incubated overnight at 4°C (Input fraction). 10μl of Protein G magnetic particles (Dynabeads, Invitrogen-Dynal) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for 1h/4 °C (Unbound fraction). The beads were washed five times with HEPES buffer and then incubated with 10μl of SDS-loading buffer for 10min/85°C to elute bound proteins (Bound fraction). Input, unbound, and bound fractions were separated by 12% SDS–PAGE and analyzed by STORM860 (GE Healthcare).
