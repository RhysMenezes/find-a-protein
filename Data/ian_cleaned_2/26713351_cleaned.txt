!~ABS~! In both animals and plants, messenger (m)RNA export has been shown to contribute to immune response regulation. The Arabidopsis nuclear protein MOS11, along with the nucleoporins MOS3/Nup96/SAR3 and Nup160/SAR1 are components of the mRNA export machinery and contribute to immunity mediated by nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLR). The human MOS11 ortholog CIP29 is part of a small protein complex with three additional members: the RNA helicase DDX39, ALY, and TAF15b. We systematically assessed the biological roles of the Arabidopsis homologs of these proteins in toll interleukin 1 receptor–type NLR (TNL)-mediated immunity using reverse genetics. Although mutations in ALY and DDX39 did not result in obvious defects, taf15b mutation partially suppressed the autoimmune phenotypes of a gain-of-function TNL mutant, snc1. An additive effect on snc1 suppression was observed in mos11-1 taf15b snc1 triple mutant plants, suggesting that MOS11 and TAF15b have independent functions. TAF15b-GFP fusion protein, which fully complemented taf15b mutant phenotypes, localized to nuclei similarly to MOS11. However, it was also targeted to cytosolic granules identified as processing bodies. In addition, we observed no change in SNC1 mRNA levels, whereas less SNC1 protein accumulated in taf15b mutant, suggesting that TAF15b contributes to SNC1 homeostasis through posttranscriptional mechanisms. In summary, this study highlights the importance of posttranscriptional RNA processing mediated by TAF15b in the regulation of TNL-mediated immunity.
!~RES~! In human and Drosophila spp., the CIP29 protein interacts with three partners, namely, DDX39, FUS/TLS, and ALY. DDX39 is an RNA helicase highly similar to UAP56, a RNA helicase well-known for its involvement in mRNA export (Carmody and Wente 2009; Chi et al. 2012; Dufu et al. 2010; Katahira 2012). FUS/TLS is a family of RNA-binding proteins that includes TATA-box binding factors (TAFs). Beyond their RNA binding capacity, TAFs influence the initiation of transcription (Dikstein et al. 1996; Mizzen et al. 1996; Pham and Sauer 2000). ALY is a nuclear protein with nucleic acid–binding ability. ALY has been shown to interfere with silencing in plants (Canto et al. 2006; Uhrig et al. 2004). Through BLAST analysis, we identified the closest homologs of DDX39, FUS/TLS, and ALY in Arabidopsis (Table 1). We then obtained homozygous T-DNA knockout lines for each gene and crossed them with snc1 plants, to monitor if mutations in these members of the CIP29 complex could affect snc1 signaling similarly as mos11. Table 1CIP29 direct and indirect interactors and their putative Arabidopsis homolog The stunted morphology of snc1 was partly suppressed in the taf15b snc1 double mutant plants (Fig. 1A). However, none of the other double mutants with snc1 resulted in snc1 suppression (not shown). In addition to their stunted morphology, snc1 plants display increased resistance to virulent oomycete pathogen H. arabidopsidis Noco2 (Li et al. 2001). To assess if taf15b could also suppress this snc1 phenotype, we performed an infection assay with H. arabidopsidis Noco2. The taf15b snc1 plants did not display a statistically significant difference from snc1 plants (Fig. 1B). Similarly to mos11-1, the single taf15b plant did not display enhanced disease susceptibility when compared with WT plants. In contrast to mos11-1 plants, taf15b plants did not display impaired mRNA export (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also assessed the capacity of taf15b to alter the constitutive resistance of snc1 to virulent bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326. In this case, the suppression of the snc1 resistance was significant (Fig. 1C). Since snc1 immune activation can be monitored by the level of expression of PR genes (Li et al. 2001), we verified if the PR gene expresssion level was affected in taf15b snc1 plants. The quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data demonstrates that snc1 plants express PR1 transcript at a level approximately 500 times (486-fold) higher than observed in unstressed WT plants (Fig. 1D). In the double mutant taf15b snc1 plants, PR1 expression level was approximately half the level observed in snc1, at 233-fold of the WT plants. For PR2 expression, similar fold changes were observed (Fig. 1D).  Fig. 1.taf15b partially suppresses the autoimmunity of snc1. A, Morphology of 4-week-old soil-grown wild type (WT), snc1, taf15b snc1, and taf15b plants. B, Two-week-old soil-grown plants were inoculated with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Noco2 at a concentration of 50,000 conidiospores per milliliter and the number of conidiospores was quantified 7 days after inoculation. Bars represent the mean of four replicates. Statistical significance was established using Student t test (P < 0.05) and statistically different results are represented by different letters. C, Five-week-old soil-grown plants were inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 at an optical density at 600 nm = 0.0001, and statistical significance was evaluated using Student’s t test (P < 0.05) D, PR1 and PR2 gene expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and was normalized with ACT1. In conclusion, among all CIP29 complex component mutants tested, taf15b is the only mutant that affects the snc1 autoimmune phenotypes, acting as a partial suppressor of snc1. Since Arabidopsis contains another FUS/TLS homolog, TAF15, we investigated whether it was redundant to TAF15b. In order to assess whether TAF15 and TAF15b were functionally redundant, we compared the morphology of taf15 and taf15b T-DNA knock-out lines to that of the taf15 taf15b double mutant. The taf15 plants are indistinguishable from WT, whereas the taf15b mutant is slightly different from WT, with slightly bigger and rounder leaves, often concave rather than convex, indicating that, in Arabidopsis, the TAF15 protein cannot functionally complement taf15b morphological phenotypes (Fig. 2A). The taf15 taf15b double mutant resembles the taf15b single mutant (Fig. 2A). To further substantiate the difference between taf15b and WT plants and between taf15b and taf15, we evaluated the number of rosette leaves when the plants were 5 weeks old, as the taf15b mutant exhibits a late-flowering phenotype. As shown in Figure 1B, taf15b and taf15b taf15 double mutant plants exhibit similar flowering-time defects, confirming that these two genes do not have redundant functions. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree generated using the full-length amino acid sequences of AtTAF15 and AtTAF15b homologs found in different plant species also shows that AtTAF15 and AtTAF15b form different clades in all species (Fig. 2C).  Fig. 2.TAF15 and TAF15b have different topology and are functionally distinct. A, Morphology of 2.5-week-old soil-grown wild type (WT), taf15b, taf15, and taf15 taf15b plants. B, Comparing flowering time in soil-grown WT, taf15b, taf15, and taf15 taf15b. Letters indicate statistical significance as determined by Student’s t test (P < 0.0001). C, Phylogeny of TAF15b-related proteins was inferred, using the full-length amino acid sequences. Alignment and tree was computed using ClustalW and a neighbor-joining alignment was used. D, Protein domain organization was inferred using the National Center for Biotechnology Information conserved domain database software. Small numbers above the proteins indicate the relative position of the domains; the numbers at the end of the protein names indicate the number of amino acids. While TAF15 and TAF15b have similarity in composition of their functional domains, their protein architecture is different. TAF15 possesses a RNA-recognition motif at its amino terminus, followed by a two–zinc finger domain, whereas in TAF15b only one zinc finger is present (Fig. 2D). The human TAF15 protein has the protein topology of AtTAF15, while FUS/TLS shares the protein topology of AtTAF15b. For further analysis, we therefore refer to AtTAF15b as the homolog of FUS/TLS rather than that of human AtTAF15. With publicly available microarray data (Winter et al. 2007), we asked whether TAF15, TAF15b, MOS11, and SNC1 gene expression was inducible by virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, avirulent oomycete pathogen H. arabidopsidis Emwa1, virulent oomycete pathogen H. arabidopsidis Noco2, and PAMP elicitor flg22. The expression of these genes was not significantly modulated in the assessed conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2). In order to assess if taf15b, taf15, or the taf15 taf15b mutations would impair the immune capacity of other NLR proteins, we evaluated the response of these mutants against the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 AvrRpt2 (Supplementary Fig. 3A), P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 AvrRPS4, and the avirulent oomycete strain H. arabidopsidis Emwa1. We also evaluated PTI, using the type III secretion–deficient bacterial strain P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC−. Response to the avirulent pathogens tested or P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC− was not affected in either single mutants or the double mutant, indicating that neither TAF15b nor TAF15 is a component involved in general NLR signaling. We also assessed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction capacity in WT, taf15, taf15b, and taf15 taf15b plants (Supplementary Fig. S4) in response to flg22. Interestingly, we observed mild yet reproducible reduction in ROS induction by flg22 in the taf15b single mutant and the taf15 taf15b double mutant. Based on the phylogeny and protein topology, we conclude that the closest homolog of AtTAF15b in humans is FUS/TLS. In addition, based on our epistatic analysis (discussed below), we conclude that AtTAF15 and AtTAF15b do not have overlapping functions in plants. Finally, neither TAF15 nor TAF15b appears to be involved in general NLR signaling. However, they do contribute to the ROS induction in PTI. Since taf15b, like mos11-1, could partially suppress the snc1 phenotype, we sought to investigate if the lack of these two proteins would have an additive effect on the suppression of the snc1 autoimmune phenotypes. While both double mutants were only partial snc1 suppressors, the triple mutant mos11-1 taf15b snc1 almost fully suppressed the stunted morphology of snc1 (Fig. 3A). However, the triple mutant plants had delayed bolting when compared with WT plants (Fig. 3A). Since snc1 dwarf morphology was fully suppressed in the triple mutant, we verified whether PR gene expression was comparable to levels observed in WT. Indeed, we observed that the PR gene expression in the triple mutant was very close to that observed in WT plants (Fig. 3B).  Fig. 3.mos11-1 taf15b snc1 triple mutant analysis. A, Morphology of wild type (WT), snc1, mos11 snc1, taf15b snc1, and mos11 taf15b snc1 plants. Soil-grown plants were photographed 5 weeks after germination. B, Expression of defense marker genes PR1 and PR2 in the indicated genotypes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed on 2-week-old plants grown on ½ Murashige Skoog plates. ACT1 was used to normalize the transcript levels. Each average represents three technical repeats. C, Growth of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Noco2 7 days after inoculation on the indicated genotypes. Spray-infection was performed on 2-week-old plants on soil with a conidiospore suspension at 100,000 spores per milliliter. Each average represents four sampling repeats. Letters indicate statistical significance as determined by Student’s t test (P < 0.02). The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Since the morphology suppression and PR gene expression suppression of the autoimmune mutant was nearly complete, we assessed the resistance of the triple mutant plants to the virulent biotrophic oomycete H. arabidopsidis Noco2. The triple mutant analysis showed an additive effect of the mos11 and the taf15b mutations in the suppression of snc1 resistance to H. arabidopsidis Noco2 (Fig. 3C). The additive effect of the taf15b mutant on the snc1 mos11 mutant, both at the morphological level, in the resistance to pathogens and the absence of mRNA export defect in taf15b suggests that MOS11 and TAF15b proteins do not have a role in the same pathway. To further assess whether Taf15b could associate with MOS11 in planta as CIP29 does with FUS (Dufu et al. 2010), we generated a stable epitope-tagged transgenic line expressing TAF15b-FLAG under the control of its own regulatory sequence (1,436 bp upstream of the start codon) in taf15b background. This construct fully complements the taf15b snc1 phenotype (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the C-terminal FLAG tag does not affect the function of TAF15b. We then crossed this line with MOS11-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (in mos11-1 background) to generate F1 plants heterozygous at both loci that could be used for coimmunoprecipitation. In MOS11-GFP, we could not immunoprecipitate TAF15b-FLAG (Fig. 4B). This result, combined with the additive effect of mos11 and taf15b in the triple mutant, suggest that MOS11 and TAF15b either do not physically interact in plants and are not involved in the same biological function or their interaction is too weak or transient to be detectable. Additionally, we queried the Plant Interactome database (Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium 2011) to search for other proteins that could interact with TAF15b. This database reported that TAF12b (Kubo et al. 2011), TAF4b, TAF14 (Choi et al. 2011), TAF5, and TAF4 all interact with TAF15b (Supplementary Table S1) but not with MOS11 or TAF15.  Fig. 4.TAF15b does not associate with MOS11 in vivo. A, Morphology of snc1, taf15b snc1, and two taf15b snc1 transgenic lines expressing AtTAF15b-FLAG transgene. Soil-grown plants were photographed 4 weeks after germination. B, Immunoprecipitation of AtTAF15b-FLAG using anti–green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody. Total protein extracts from seedlings grown on ½ Murashige Skoog plates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-GFP agarose beads. Input and eluted samples were detected by anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies. TAF15b encodes a glycine-rich protein of 42 kDa. It contains a zinc-finger domain (position 87 to 111), a RNA recognition motif (position 281 to 360) (predicted by PFAM) and is predicted to be nuclear localized by the WoLF PSORT prediction tool. Since TAF15 proteins have not been well characterized in plants, we further investigated the subcellular localization of TAF15b. When TAF15b-GFP under the control of its native promoter was transformed in the taf15b snc1 double mutant, the transformed plants displayed snc1-like morphology, indicating that TAF15b was properly expressed and the fusion gene is able to complement the taf15b defects (Fig. 5A). Although TAF15b-GFP could be observed in the nuclei (Fig. 5B), strong fluorescence was also observed as clear punctate spots in the cytosol (Fig. 5C and E), reminiscent of proteins localized to p-bodies. To assess if these could be p-bodies, we used a stable Arabidopsis transgenic line expressing the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)–labeled p-bodies marker DECAPPING 1 (Xu et al. 2006) (pDCP1:DCP1-CFP). Similar punctate spots as observed in TAF15b-GFP plants were observed (Fig. 5F, H, and J). To further confirm that Taf15b-GFP was indeed localized to p-bodies, we crossed the TAF15b-GFP line with the DCP1-CFP line and examined F1 plants. A clear CFP and GFP colocalization was observed (Fig. 5K and L; Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that TAF15b localizes to the p-bodies.  Fig. 5.Subcellular localization of TAF15b-GFP.

L, Intensity plot of GFP (TAF15b-GFP) and DCP1 (CFP) in the p-bodies transected by the solid white line in panel K. P-bodies are known to be involved in the sequestration of mRNAs, NMD, AU-rich element–mediated mRNA decay, and microRNA induced mRNA silencing (Kulkarni et al. 2010). All these components of RNA regulation and catabolism may affect transcription and translation of specific mRNAs. In addition, plant NLR proteins are known to be regulated by transacting small interfering RNAs (Zhai et al. 2011). Thus, we examined whether the level of SNC1 transcript or the level of SNC1 protein was affected in taf15b and taf15b snc1, relative to WT and snc1 plants. We did not observe significant differences in mRNA levels between WT and taf15b and between snc1 and snc1 taf15b (Student’s t-test, in both cases P > 0.1) (Fig. 6A). We then tested whether SNC1 protein accumulation is affected by taf15b, through Western blot assay using an anti-SNC1 antibody (L-i et al. 2010). We consistently observed decreased SNC1 protein level in taf15b compared with WT, and this difference in maintained in snc1 taf15b compared with snc1 (Fig. 6B and C). As the SNC1 transcription is not substantially affected by taf15b (Fig. 6A), we conclude that taf15b affects SNC1 protein accumulation through posttranscriptional mechanisms.  Fig. 6.taf15b does not affect SNC1 transcript but does reduce SNC1 protein level. A, Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the SNC1 transcript levels in various genotypes. B, Western blot using anti-SNC1 antibody to quantify the SNC1 protein levels in wild type (WT), snc1, taf15b snc1, and taf15b. The experiment was repeated four times. The same plants were used for experiments in A and B. Leaf tissue was collected from 4-week-old soil-grown plants. C, Quantification of SNC1 band intensity relative to a nonspecific band in Ponceau S in four Western blot repeats as described in B, as determined by using Image J. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation of relative SNC1 protein abundance. SNC1 protein abundance in WT (left panel) or snc1 (right panel) was set as 1. Student’s t tests were used to calculate the statistical significance between genotypes, as indicated by different letters (P < 0.05). Given the localization displayed by TAF15b and the apparent lack of a direct effect on SNC1 mRNA level, the suppression of the snc1 phenotype is likely indirect. Putative targets could be regulated by miRNA and affect TNL-mediated immunity. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the level of known miRNAs in our genetic backgrounds (Fig. 7). Northern blot analysis showed slight differences for some miRNA; however, when multiple repeats were performed, those differences were not found to be statistically significant. Therefore, we conclude that the effect of taf15b on snc1 immunity is not via an obvious alteration of miRNA levels.  Fig. 7.taf15b does alter the level of some micro (mi)RNAs. The expression level of five miRNAs (miR393, miR165a, miR393, miR398, miR156, and miR171) was assessed and quantified by Northern blot for plant genotypes WT (wild type), taf15b, snc1, mos11-1, taf15b snc1, mos11-1 snc1, and mos11 taf15b snc1. Loading control was normalized by U6 RNA. RNA was extracted from the leaves of 4-week-old plants.
!~MM~! Protein topology was searched using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Conserved Domain search tool. The phylogenetic tree was made using Colbalt Protein Alignment software, set to infer the tree using a neighbor-joining method from the full-length amino acid sequences. The species and protein models used to infer the tree are for TAF15b proteins Arabidopsis thaliana At5g58470, Glycine max XP_003518322, Arabidopsis lyrata XP_002866269, Medicago truncatula XP_003599332, Vitis vinifera XP_002269146, and for TAF, Arabidopsis thaliana At1g50300, Arabidopsis lyrata XP_002894246, Oryza sativa BAD33184, Brachypodium distachyon XP_003562545, Glycine max NP_001241952, Vitis vinifera XP_002273586, and Populus trichocarpa XP_002315063. The human protein FUS/TLS and TAF15 used to infer the topologies were AAC35285 and Q92804, respectively. Plants were grown at 22°C under 16-h-light and 8-h-dark regime. To create AtTAF15b-GFP and AtTAF15b-FLAG constructs, a genomic PCR fragment of AtTAF15b (At5g58470) with 1,436 bp upstream from the start codon was cloned into the modified binary vector pCam1305 with either C-terminal GFP or FLAG sequence by restriction enzymes BamHI and SalI. The cloning PCR was performed using primers 5′-CGCGGATCCCATTTCTCCAGAGCTATGGC-3′ and 5′-ACGCACGCGTCGACATATGGACGAGACCGGTTTC-3′. Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation was carried out with slight modification to the procedure described by Clough and Bent (1998). Briefly, the Silwet L-77 was substituted with OFX-309 and floral dip was performed twice with a 1-week interval between dippings (Mireault et al. 2014). To identify homozygous taf15b T-DNA Salk_061974 or Sail_35_B06 mutants, we used primers 5′-CAAAACAATCCACCACCATTC-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGTCAAGCAGTGCGATG-3′ to perform PCR. Similarly, to check homozygosity for the mos11-1 mutation, primers 5′-CGGCCGATAATTCGTGGACG-3′ and 5′-CACCAGTAGATAGCCCTCC-3′ were used. For presence of the T-DNA from the generic primers, LBb1.3 (ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC) was used for SALK lines and Sail-F (cgtccgcaatgtgttattaag) for SAIL lines. RT-PCR analysis of the expression of PR1 and PR2 was carried out as previously described (Cheng et al. 2011). ACT1 was used as loading control. Leaf infiltration of Pseudomonas syringae strains was performed on 4-week-old plants as described previously (Li et al. 1999). Spray infection by H. arabidopsidis Noco2 or Emwa1 was performed as described previously (Li et al. 1999). Ten-day-old plants grown on ½ Murashige-Skoog (MS) were used for observation with GFP- or CFP-tagged constructs, using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. In situ poly-A RNA hybridization was performed as previously described (Germain et al. 2010). F1 plants from a cross between plants homozygous for MOS11-GFP in mos11-1 and AtTAF15b-FLAG in Salk_061974 were used to check the association between TAF15b and MOS11 in vivo, while plants homozygous for AtTAF15b-FLAG in Salk_061974 were used as the negative control. Plants were grown on MS medium and 5 g of 2.5-week-old plants were harvested from each genotype. Nuclear extraction was performed as previously described (Wiermer et al. 2012). Nuclei (in NE-3 buffer: 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, with protease inhibitors) were sonicated using a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) at a power of 2.75 for 4 min with a 10-s pause for each 5 s of operation, to break the nuclear envelope. Nuclear samples were incubated with NHS-activated sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min to remove nonspecific binding. Nuclei were pelleted at 5, 000 × g for 30 s and were allowed to be incubated with recombinant camel GFP-binding protein–conjugated beads for 3 h. After incubation, the beads were pelleted at 20,000 × g for 5 min and were washed three times with NE-3. Subsequent Western blot was performed using anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies respectively (Roche). Eight leaf discs (4 × 4 mm) of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants were sampled using a razor blade and were floated overnight under light on sterile water. PAMP-induced ROS produced by the leaf discs were measured by a luminol-based assay (Lu et al. 2010; Trujillo et al. 2008). Luminescence was captured using a Tecan M200 plate reader.
