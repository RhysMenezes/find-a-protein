!~ABS~!   The transport of phosphate (Pi) between subcellular compartments is central to metabolic regulation. Although some of the transporters involved in controlling the intracellular distribution of Pi have been identified in plants, others are predicted from genetic, biochemical and bioinformatics studies.  Heterologous expression in yeast, and gene expression and localization in plants were used to characterize all six members of an Arabidopsis thaliana membrane transporter family designated here as PHT4. PHT4 proteins share similarity with SLC17/type I Pi transporters, a diverse group of animal proteins involved in the transport of Pi, organic anions and chloride.  All of the PHT4 proteins mediate Pi transport in yeast with high specificity. Bioinformatic analysis and localization of PHT4‐GFP fusion proteins indicate that five of the proteins are targeted to the plastid envelope, and the sixth resides in the Golgi apparatus.   PHT4 genes are expressed in both roots and leaves, although two of the genes are expressed predominantly in leaves and one mostly in roots. These expression patterns, together with Pi transport activities and subcellular locations, suggest roles for PHT4 proteins in the transport of Pi between the cytosol and chloroplasts, heterotrophic plastids and the Golgi apparatus. 
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis genome contains six genes (Table 1) that encode proteins with similarity to members of the SLC17/type I Pi transporter family, which includes mammalian type I Pi transporters, vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and sialin, a lysosomal sialic acid transporter (Reimer & Edwards, 2004). The Arabidopsis proteins, designated here as PHT4;1 through PHT4;6, have 10–12 putative membrane‐spanning domains (Arai et al., 2004), and share 31–76% similarity with each other and 23–41% similarity with the human SLC17 members (SLC17A1‐8). Multiple anion transport activities have been attributed to members of the SLC17/type I Pi transporter family, for example, Pi, chloride and glutamate transport (Werner et al., 1991; Debiec & Ronco, 1993; Ni et al., 1994; Miyamoto et al., 1995; Quabius et al., 1995; Busch et al., 1996; Bröer et al., 1998; Yabuuchi et al., 1998; Verheijen et al., 1999; Aihara et al., 2000; Bellocchio et al., 2000; Takamori et al., 2000; Uchino et al., 2000; Ishibashi et al., 2003; Morin et al., 2004; Juge et al., 2006), but nearly all of the characterized proteins also exhibit Na+‐dependent Pi transport (Werner et al., 1991; Debiec & Ronco, 1993; Ni et al., 1994; Miyamoto et al., 1995; Quabius et al., 1995; Busch et al., 1996; Bröer et al., 1998; Yabuuchi et al., 1998; Aihara et al., 2000; Ishibashi et al., 2003; Juge et al., 2006). Thus, we hypothesized that the similar PHT4 proteins might also have Pi transport functions.  To test this hypothesis, we first used RT‐PCR to obtain cDNAs corresponding to the full coding regions of each PHT4 gene, and cloned the amplicons into a yeast expression vector. Multiple splice variants are predicted for some of the PHT4 genes (http://www.arabidopsis.org/); however, we sequenced at least three independent clones for each cDNA and in all cases detected a single form that matched the respective GenBank accession listed in Table 1. We then tested each of the cDNA clones for the ability to complement the growth defect of a yeast Pi transport mutant. The yeast PAM2 strain (Martinez & Persson, 1998) lacks functional copies of both high‐affinity Pi transporter genes present in yeast, PHO84 and PHO89, and thus grows poorly when supplied with limiting amounts of Pi. The remaining low‐affinity transporters (Tamai et al., 1985; Wykoff & O'Shea, 2001) provide sufficient activity for propagation of this strain under the nonselective conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, all six members of the PHT4 family complemented the growth defect of PAM2 cells, although PHT4;1 was capable of complementation only when the region predicted by ChloroP (Emanuelsson et al., 1999) to encode an N‐terminal 59 amino acid transit peptide was deleted. All strains grew equally well when supplied with higher concentrations of Pi.  [[FIGURE]]  32Pi uptake assays were used to confirm and analyze transport mediated by each of the PHT4 proteins expressed in yeast. In all cases, net transport was linear with respect to time for at least 4 min (data not shown). Each of the cultures expressing a PHT4 protein displayed saturable Pi transport with initial rates three‐ to fourfold greater than cells carrying the empty expression vector. Because transport velocities were similar, results are shown in Fig. 2 only for the cells exhibiting the highest and lowest activities. To estimate apparent Km values, the component of net transport contributed by the yeast endogenous transport activity (background) was subtracted before nonlinear regression analysis. Background activities were determined from concurrent measurements with the control cells. In each case, the apparent Km values were similar for three independent experiments, and ranged from 0.45 ± 0.08 mm for PHT4;5 to 0.74 ± 0.06 mm for PHT4;6 (Table 2). These values differ significantly (P < 0.02) from that of the background activity, 0.99 ± 0.07 mm.  [[FIGURE]] Given the broad range of anions transported by some SLC17/type I Pi transporters (Bellocchio et al., 2000; Takamori et al., 2000), we investigated the specificity of PHT4 transporters by testing various anions for the ability to compete with Pi for uptake. Potential inhibitors were added to cells at 10‐fold molar excess to Pi, and the rates of Pi accumulation were compared with those for cells treated with water. All of the PHT4 transporters appeared highly specific for Pi under these conditions, because only arsenate, a structural analog of Pi, caused inhibition at a concentration approaching that of unlabeled Pi (Table 3). Addition of sulfate and nitrate did result in a slight reduction in Pi transport catalyzed by PHT4;2, but the basis for this inhibition is unknown. We measured the uptake of 35S‐sulfate for each of the cultures using essentially the same growth and assay conditions as for Pi (0.25 mm 35S‐sulfate, pH 4.0), but all cultures, including the control, exhibited an equivalent transport rate of 17 pmol mg cells−1 min−1. This result suggests that expression of the PHT4 proteins has no general effect on anion permeability of the yeast cells, and that PHT4;2 either does not mediate sulfate transport or does so to a degree that is effectively masked by endogenous activities.  Phosphate transport activities were assessed at pH values ranging from 3 to 6, and differences were detected in the activity profiles, but in each case, transport was maximal at pH values of 3 or 4 and declined sharply at pH 6 (Fig. 3). The magnitude of the changes in activity from pH 5 to pH 6 cannot be explained solely by a preference for the monobasic form of Pi, which would decrease only 8%. Thus, the relatively broad, acidic pH optima may reflect intrinsic properties of the transporter proteins. Treatment of cells with the protonophore carbonylcyanide m‐chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) caused a significant, concentration‐dependent decrease in the rates of Pi transport (Table 3), suggesting that transport may be dependent on the proton‐motive force, although secondary effects such as changes in cytosolic pH may also affect transport activity. Given the similarity of PHT4 proteins to transporters that mediate Na+‐dependent Pi transport (Werner et al., 1991; Miyamoto et al., 1995; Busch et al., 1996; Ishibashi et al., 2003), we investigated whether transport might be affected by Na+ concentration. Pi transport activities using our standard uptake medium, which contains approx. 30 mm Na+ (Versaw & Harrison, 2002), were compared with those measured in uptake medium in which all of the sodium salts normally present were substituted with potassium salts. Although this concentration of Na+ is more than sufficient for maximal activity of the yeast PHO89 Na+/Pi symporter (Martinez & Persson, 1998), no differences in net transport activities were detected for any of the PHT4 proteins under these conditions (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] The presence of potential organellar targeting sequences located at the N‐terminus of each of the PHT4 proteins initially led us to hypothesize that some members of this family would localize to plastids (Versaw & Harrison, 2002). Consensus subcellular localization predictions derived from 13 different programs (ARAMEMNON database, http://aramemnon.botanik.uni‐koeln.de/), suggest that PHT4;1, PHT4;2 and PHT4;3 are located in plastids, and that PHT4;6 is located within the secretory system. The predictions for PHT4;4 and PHT4;5 were ambiguous, with roughly equivalent consensus scores for plastid and mitochondrial localization. This ambiguity was resolved for PHT4;4, and the predictions verified for PHT4;1, through the use of GFP fusions, which confirmed that both of these proteins are located in chloroplasts (Ferro et al., 2003; Roth et al., 2004). Furthermore, Roth et al. (2004) used highly specific antibodies and membrane fractionation to demonstrate that PHT4;4 is located within the chloroplast inner envelope membrane.  To test the localization predictions for the other members of the PHT4 family, translational fusion constructs were prepared in which the same full‐length coding regions used for functional analyses in yeast were cloned downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and fused to the 5′ end of GFP. The constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment, and after 24 h, the leaves were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The fluorescence images revealed that transiently expressed PHT4;2‐GFP and PHT4;5‐GFP were localized to chloroplasts, which were distinguished by red chlorophyll autofluorescence (Fig. 4). By contrast, PHT4;6 co‐localized with a Golgi marker, rat sialyl transferase transmembrane‐stem region (RatST) fused to RFP (Dixit & Cyr, 2002). The localization of PHT4;3 remains unresolved because green fluorescence was not detected in leaves bombarded with the PHT4;3‐GFP construct, nor a similar truncated fusion containing the first 600 bp of the PHT4;3 coding region. Expression of these fusions in transgenic Arabidopsis also failed to yield detectable GFP signals despite the presence of transcripts, suggesting that the fusion proteins may be unstable.  [[FIGURE]] Expression of PHT4 genes in photosynthetic and heterotrophic tissues (rosette leaves and roots, respectively) was analyzed by quantitative RT‐PCR. Tissues were harvested from plants grown hydroponically for 3 wk, at which time the plants had rosette leaves but no other green tissues. As shown in Fig. 5a, large differences exist between the PHT4 genes in terms of transcript abundance and specificity for leaves and roots. PHT4;1 and PHT4;4 displayed the highest levels of expression, both in leaves. With the exception of PHT4;2 and PHT4;6, the other four members of this gene family were expressed more abundantly in leaves than in roots. This was most striking for PHT4;1 and PHT4;4, which were expressed 49‐ and 12‐fold greater in leaves than in roots, respectively, consistent with their reported chloroplast localization. However, all of the genes exhibited detectable expression in roots, and expression of PHT4;2 was essentially restricted to roots. Hence, the plastid‐localized protein members of this family may function in both photosynthetic and heterotrophic plastids, or, in the case of PHT4;2, perhaps exclusively in heterotrophic plastids. PHT4;6 was expressed ubiquitously, although slightly more strongly in roots than in leaves. Despite differences in growth conditions, expression profiles from the Genevestigator microarray databases (Zimmermann et al., 2005) closely match the patterns depicted in Fig. 5a.  [[FIGURE]] We also investigated whether transcription of PHT4 genes was influenced by Pi supply. Leaf and root tissues were harvested from plants exposed to Pi‐limiting conditions for 3 d, and the expression levels were compared with those detected under Pi‐replete conditions. Results shown in Fig. 5b indicate that this treatment was sufficient to enhance strongly expression of two known Pi‐responsive genes, IPS1 and SQD1 (Hammond et al., 2003). However, none of the PHT4 genes exhibited a change in expression > 1.8‐fold, suggesting that these genes are not responsive to Pi deprivation. 
!~MM~! Complementary DNAs for the full coding regions of each of the six PHT4 genes were produced by RT‐PCR using RNA isolated from 5‐wk‐old Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (ecotype Col‐0) plants. PCR primers were designed to introduce unique restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genes (BamHI and XhoI, respectively, for PHT4;1, and EcoRI and XhoI, respectively, for the other five genes). The cDNA amplicons were cloned into the yeast expression plasmid pWV3 (Versaw & Harrison, 2002). The PHT4;1(Δ1–59) clone was generated by PCR and lacks the first 177 bp of the PHT4;1 coding sequence, which corresponds to a 59‐amino acid putative transit peptide, and a new ATG start codon was inserted. For subcellular localization experiments, full‐length PHT4 coding sequences were amplified from the plasmids described and then cloned in frame upstream of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene in the plasmid CaMV35S‐sGFP(S65T)‐nos (Chiu et al., 1996). Cloned inserts for all plasmids were sequenced.  Constructs were tested for their ability to complement the growth defect of the yeast Pi transport‐deficient strain PAM2 (Martinez & Persson, 1998). Transformed yeast was grown in SD medium containing 0.22 mm Pi and 25 mm Na‐citrate buffer pH 4.5 to an OD600 of 1.0. OD600 was monitored with a Beckman Coulter DU530 spectrophotometer (Fullerton, CA, USA) equipped with a turbidity cell holder, and a value of 1.0 corresponded to approx. 1 mg cells ml−1. Cultures that grew to densities greater than OD600 = 1.0 were discarded or diluted once with fresh medium to an OD600 of no greater than 0.1 and regrown. This growth regime was adopted because it was determined empirically that cells grown in rich medium or to higher densities failed to yield consistent results in subsequent analyses. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water then suspended to an OD600 of 10.0, and 5 µl aliquots of serial dilutions were spotted to agar plates containing SD medium, 1 mm Pi and 25 mm Na‐citrate buffer, pH 6. Plates were incubated at 30°C for up to 3 d. For 32Pi uptake assays, transformed yeast was grown as described earlier, washed twice with ice‐cold water then suspended at 200 mg cells ml−1. Ten microliters of the cell suspension were added to 185 µl of Pi‐free medium, pH 4.0, and equilibrated at 30°C for 4 min with gentle agitation. Transport assays were initiated by addition of 5 µl of 32Pi at the desired concentration and terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice‐cold 25 mm Na‐citrate buffer followed immediately by filtration on glass fiber filters and an additional wash. The accumulated radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectroscopy. Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression.  Plants were grown in chambers at 21°C with 70% relative humidity and a 14 h photoperiod (150 µmol m−2 s−1). For expression studies, individual seeds were placed in 0.2 ml tubes containing agar‐solidified, half‐strength MS medium (Murashige & Skoog, 1962) lacking a carbon source and then stratified for 3 d at 4°C before transfer to a growth chamber. After 3–4 d in the growth chamber, the tube bottoms were removed and the seedlings were suspended in 1.5 l growth vessels (Tocquin et al., 2003) containing half‐strength MS medium (24 plants per vessel). Plants were grown for 3 wk before the solution was replaced with either the same replete medium (1.25 mm Pi) or low‐Pi medium (0.01 mm Pi). After an additional 3 d, tissues were harvested at the midpoint of the photoperiod.  Protein fusion constructs were introduced into leaves of 4‐wk‐old plants by particle bombardment using the Biolistic PDS‐1000/He particle delivery system, as described previously (Versaw & Harrison, 2002). After bombardment, leaves were incubated at room temperature on water‐saturated filter paper for 24 h before imaging with confocal microscopy. Cells were imaged with a Bio‐Rad 1024 ES confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a ×63 (numerical aperture, 1.2) water‐immersion objective (488 nm excitation, 522 nm emission for GFP; 568 nm excitation, 590 nm emission for RFP; and 488 nm excitation, 680 nm emission for chlorophyll autofluorescence). Images shown are single optical sections.  Total RNA was isolated from leaf and root tissues of 3‐wk‐old plants with TRI reagent (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and traces of DNA were removed with TURBO DNA‐free (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Two biological replicates consisting of tissues pooled from three plants were used for each analysis. One microgram RNA was used to make cDNA with a SuperScript first‐strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Expression levels were normalized to EIF‐4A2 (At1g54270) and fold changes were calculated using the ΔΔCT method. The following gene‐specific primers were used for real‐time PCR: for EIF‐4A2, (5′‐CAAGGTGTCAAGGTTCATGC‐3′) and (5′‐CAACGACAACATGAACACCA‐3′); for PHT4;1, (5′‐TCTTCTGGGGTTACCTTCTTACACAGA‐3′) and (5′‐TGAGAATTGTAGCGATTGACCACCAA‐3′); for PHT4;2, (5′‐GATGATGCCTGAGAGGATTAAGGTAGT‐3′) and (5′‐TAACAACTCTGTCGGCGTTACATAGA‐3′); for PHT4;3, (5′‐CAGAATTTATAACGTCGGAGAGAGTCAAA‐3′) and (5′‐AAAATGATTTGCTCCATCCACGAGAAAG‐3′); for PHT4;4, (5′‐TGTGAACATGAGCATTGCAATTCTT‐3′) and (5′‐CAACAGTTGCACTACTCCAGTTATATTCT‐3′); for PHT4;5, (5′‐TCCAGTCTTCCTTCTTTTGGGGTTATG‐3′) and (5′‐CGAAAGACCATGTAAAGACACCAATCT‐3′); for PHT4;6, (5′‐GATTGGTTTCGATAACGACATCAGGAA‐3′) and (5′‐ATTCCGGACCTCTAAGCTCAACTAA‐3′); for IPS1, (5′‐AGGGGATGGCCTAAATACAAAATG‐3′) and (5′‐GGGAGATAAACAAAACTCGCAGTC‐3′); and for SQD1, (5′‐CACCACCCGAAACATCTACC‐3′) and (5′‐ACCGCAATAACCATCTCCAC‐3′).
