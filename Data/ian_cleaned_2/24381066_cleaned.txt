!~ABS~! Fructose (Fru) is a major storage form of sugars found in vacuoles, yet the molecular regulation of vacuolar Fru transport is poorly studied. Although SWEET17 (for SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS17) has been characterized as a vacuolar Fru exporter in leaves, its expression in leaves is low. Here, RNA analysis and SWEET17-β-glucuronidase/-GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN fusions expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reveal that SWEET17 is highly expressed in the cortex of roots and localizes to the tonoplast of root cells. Expression of SWEET17 in roots was inducible by Fru and darkness, treatments that activate accumulation and release of vacuolar Fru, respectively. Mutation and ectopic expression of SWEET17 led to increased and decreased root growth in the presence of Fru, respectively. Overexpression of SWEET17 specifically reduced the Fru content in leaves by 80% during cold stress. These results intimate that SWEET17 functions as a Fru-specific uniporter on the root tonoplast. Vacuoles overexpressing SWEET17 showed increased [14C]Fru uptake compared with the wild type. SWEET17-mediated Fru uptake was insensitive to ATP or treatment with NH4Cl or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, indicating that SWEET17 functions as an energy-independent facilitative carrier. The Arabidopsis genome contains a close paralog of SWEET17 in clade IV, SWEET16. The predominant expression of SWEET16 in root vacuoles and reduced root growth of mutants under Fru excess indicate that SWEET16 also functions as a vacuolar transporter in roots. We propose that in addition to a role in leaves, SWEET17 plays a key role in facilitating bidirectional Fru transport across the tonoplast of roots in response to metabolic demand to maintain cytosolic Fru homeostasis.
!~RES~! A very recent report had indicated that SWEET17 (At4g15920) functions as a Fru exporter in leaf vacuoles. However, SWEET17 expression appeared to be very low in leaves (CITATION), indicating that SWEET17 may predominantly function in sink organs other than leaves. A quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis revealed that SWEET17 mRNA was expressed to high levels in roots of 2-week-old seedlings (Fig. 1). In soil-grown mature plants, some aerial organs, i.e. stems, flowers, and siliques, also accumulated high levels of SWEET17 transcripts. By contrast, expression of SWEET17 was comparatively low in both young and mature leaves (Fig. 1). The high levels of SWEET17 transcripts in roots observed here correlated well with the steady-state expression profile from the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (Supplemental Fig. S1A; CITATION) and the Translatome database (polysome-bound mRNA; CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S1B). Because steady-state mRNA levels do not necessarily reflect protein abundance (CITATION), translational fusions were analyzed. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a C-terminal translational GUS gene fusion of SWEET17 driven by the native SWEET17 promoter (SWEET17-GUS). In particular, the full length of SWEET17 gene containing all introns was used to observe the abundance and localization of the protein in planta. In 7-d-old transgenic seedlings, SWEET17-GUS fusion proteins were mainly found in cotyledons and roots (Fig. 2A). A similar expression pattern was also observed in 2-week-old seedlings (Fig. 2B), where, however, GUS activity was much reduced in aerial tissues. The expression pattern of SWEET17 proteins was also consistent with the expression pattern analyzed by plants expressing the GUS reporter driven by the SWEET17 promoter (Supplemental Fig. S1C). In roots, SWEET17 was predominantly expressed in root tips (Fig. 2C) and mature regions of roots (Fig. 2D), while only low expression was observed in the elongation zone of roots (Fig. 2C). Three independent reporter lines showed comparable patterns of GUS staining (data not shown). Hand sections of mature roots histochemically stained for GUS activity further demonstrated that SWEET17 predominantly accumulated in the root cortex (Fig. 2E). The cell type-specific expression was comparable with that of root array data from the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) and the Translatome database (Supplemental Fig. S2C). In soil-grown mature plants, expression of SWEET17-GUS was consistently observed to be high in roots and low in aerial tissues, such as leaves, stems, and flowers (Supplemental Fig. S3A). When the reaction time of GUS staining was doubled (to 4 h), low and patchy expression of the SWEET17-GUS fusion proteins was observed in mature leaves (Fig. 2F). After extended staining, some GUS activity was also observed in the vascular tissues of flowers (Fig. 2G) and the bottom of siliques (Fig. 2H) but not in seeds (Fig. 2I). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Because expression of some sugar transporters is modulated by sugar levels (CITATION), we investigated if sugars would affect the spatial pattern of expression of SWEET17. Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing SWEET17-GUS fusion proteins were grown on media supplemented with 1% (w/v) Suc for 5 d then transferred to media without or with 1% (w/v) Suc, Glc, or Fru for 2 d. Histochemical staining for GUS activity showed that SWEET17 accumulation was similar in the presence of Suc or Glc (Supplemental Fig. S3B) but highly induced by 1% (w/v) Fru in the elongation zone of roots (Fig. 2, J and K). To test whether SWEET17 expression responds to a low intracellular sugar status, seedlings expressing SWEET17-GUS fusion proteins were grown on media supplemented with 1% (w/v) Suc under 16-h daylength for 5 d then transferred to sugar-free media in the dark for an additional 2 d. Extended dark periods lead to sugar starvation (CITATION). Interestingly, accumulation of SWEET17-GUS fusion proteins in the elongation zone of roots was also highly induced in darkness (Fig. 2, J and L). The same Fru- and sugar starvation-inducible patterns in roots were observed at the transcriptional level using SWEET17 promoter:GUS fusions (Supplemental Fig. S3C). Weak induction of SWEET17-GUS expression in leaves was also observed upon exposure to darkness or by combining darkness with cold stress (Supplemental Fig. S4). These observations are consistent with a predicted role of SWEET17 as a Fru uniporter for uptake of excess cytosolic Fru or for release of the stored Fru across the vacuolar membrane to maintain Fru homeostasis. To investigate whether SWEET17 is targeted to the tonoplast also in roots, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a C-terminal translational GFP fusion of SWEET17 (SWEET17-GFP) driven by the native SWEET17 promoter. To allow possible transcriptional regulation, the full-length genomic SWEET17 gene was used. Confocal images of intact roots from homozygous transformants revealed that the fluorescence derived from SWEET17-GFP fusion proteins was predominantly present at the tonoplast of root tip cells (Fig. 3A). Vacuolar localization was evidenced by fluorescence surrounding small premature vacuoles located inside the plasma membrane that also stained with FM4-64 (Fig. 3, B and C; CITATION). A tonoplast localization was also observed in mature regions of roots as shown by fluorescence lining the inner side of the nucleus and plasma membrane (Fig. 3, d–f; CITATION). The fluorescence derived from SWEET17-GFP fusion proteins in the cytosol or at the plasma membrane was absent. As expected, tonoplast-specific localization of SWEET17-GFP was also observed in mesophyll protoplasts (Supplemental Fig. S5). Despite overall low levels of fluorescence in leaf tissues, SWEET17-GFP fluorescence in Arabidopsis protoplasts was clearly lining chloroplast autofluorescence toward the vacuole (Supplemental Fig. S5A) and not detected at the plasma membrane (Supplemental Fig. S5B). These observations may indicate that SWEET17 locates to and functions predominantly at the tonoplast of roots. [[FIGURE]] High levels of cytosolic Fru inhibit root growth and arrest seedling development (CITATION; CITATION). If SWEET17 could act as a vacuolar importer to store excess Fru in roots, as suggested by expression patterns (Figs. 2 and 3), altered expression of SWEET17 could affect intracellular Fru partitioning and thereby affect the sensitivity of roots to Fru toxicity. To test this hypothesis, Arabidopsis knockout mutants sweet17-1 and sweet17-2 with transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertions in the SWEET17 gene were obtained. While the relative root growth of the segregating wild type (ecotype Columbia; Col-TDNA) and mutants (sweet17-1 and sweet17-2) was similar when grown on media with or without 1% (w/v) Suc, root growth of sweet17-1 and sweet17-2 seedlings was significantly more sensitive to 1% (w/v) to 2% (w/v) Fru compared with the wild type (Fig. 4A). SWEET17 thus appears to contribute, at least partially, to Fru tolerance in roots. We therefore tested whether SWEET17 is also sufficient for Fru tolerance. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the full-length genomic SWEET17 gene driven by the constitutive Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. In 7-d-old seedlings, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis showed that levels of SWEET17 transcripts in homozygous overexpressing lines 35S:SWEET17-1, 35S:SWEET17-6, and 35S:SWEET17-2 were highly increased compared with plants transformed with the empty vector (Col-Vector; Supplemental Fig. S6A). In contrast to the increased sensitivity of root growth in sweet17 mutants (Fig. 4A), three independent overexpressor lines (35S:SWEET17-1, 35S:SWEET17-6, and 35S:SWEET17-2) showed enhanced tolerance compared with wild-type plants (Col-Vector-1 and Col-Vector-2) in the presence of 0.1% to 1% (w/v) Fru (Fig. 4B). Excess sugars are known to inhibit seed germination (CITATION). To examine if SWEET17 also contributes to Fru translocation during early seedling development, we compared germination rates of mutants and overexpressors subjected to excess Fru. However, after 2 to 4 d of incubation, we did not observe significant differences between the overexpressor or mutant lines and the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S6, B and C; data not shown). [[FIGURE]] The induction of SWEET17 expression by energy starvation (Fig. 2, J and L) indicates that SWEET17 may be able not only to import, but also to export Fru stored in the vacuole into the cytosol when there is a metabolic demand. To examine how the increased export activity of SWEET17 proteins affects the capacity of vacuoles to store sugars, we determined the sugar content of leaves of SWEET17 overexpressors under standard growth conditions and in response to cold stress (4°C) for 1 week. Cold stress had been shown to induce Fru accumulation in vacuoles by 2- to 10-fold within 24 h (CITATION). Under standard conditions, no dramatic differences in leaf sugar levels were observed when comparing the wild types and overexpressors (Supplemental Fig. S7A). However, under cold stress conditions, the Fru content of leaves of 35S:SWEET17-1 overexpressor plants was significantly reduced by 80% compared with the wild type transformed with the empty vector (Col-Vector; Fig. 5). No significant differences in levels of Glc, Suc, and other sugars were observed in cold-stressed overexpressors (Fig. 5; Supplemental Fig. S7B). These results provide functional evidence that SWEET17 is involved in vacuolar Fru export in planta. [[FIGURE]] The sensitivity of root growth to Fru inhibition in sweet17 mutants (Fig. 4A) and the decreased Fru content in cold-stressed SWEET17 overexpressors (Fig. 5) indicated that SWEET17 mediates bidirectional Fru-specific transport in vivo. To directly measure the transport properties of SWEET17, leaf vacuoles were isolated from overexpressor plants grown under standard conditions and used to perform time course uptake assays with [14C]Suc, [14C]Glc, and [14C]Fru. Vacuoles isolated from 35S:SWEET17-1 and 35S:SWEET17-6 mesophyll protoplasts exhibited enhanced time-dependent Fru uptake activity compared with those isolated from control leaves (Col-Vector; Fig. 6A). By comparison, the uptake activities for Glc or Suc were not significantly increased (Supplemental Fig. S8). These results show that SWEET17 can import Fru specifically into vacuoles along a concentration gradient in vivo. [[FIGURE]] To confirm if SWEET17 acts as a uniporter as indicated from phenotypes (Figs. 4 and 5), we examined the effect of ATP, the uncoupler NH4Cl (5 mm; CITATION), or a protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, 10 μm; CITATION), on Fru uptake activity mediated by SWEET17 (Fig. 6B). After an incubation time of 20 min in the presence of 0.2 mm [14C]Fru and Mg-ATP, vacuoles from plants overexpressing SWEET17 had taken up 2.5 times more Fru compared with those expressing the empty vector (Fig. 6B). The absence of ATP as well as treatments of NH4Cl or CCCP, which disrupt the preexisting proton gradient, had no significant impact on transport activity (Fig. 6B). To investigate the affinity of the vacuolar Fru transporter, we performed a concentration-dependent uptake experiment. Saturation of Fru uptake was not observed at concentrations up to 20 mm that were used here (Fig. 6C). The estimated Km and Vmax values of SWEET17 activity were 25.6 mm and 479.8 pmol Fru μL vacuole–1 min–1, respectively, demonstrating that SWEET17 is a low-affinity Fru transporter. The Arabidopsis genome contains a close homolog of SWEET17 in clade IV, named SWEET16. In a recent study, SWEET16 (At3g16690) was also shown to function as a vacuolar sugar facilitator in vascular parenchyma cells (CITATION). However, the expression of SWEET16, measured using a promoter-GUS fusion, is relatively low in most tissues, including roots (CITATION). Because SWEET16 and SWEET17 proteins share 70% amino acid identity (Supplemental Fig. S9A), we suspected that SWEET16 may play a partially redundant function with SWEET17 in roots under certain environmental stimuli. To address this hypothesis, we performed similar experiments as for SWEET17. Interestingly, the qRT-PCR analysis showed predominant expression of SWEET16 mRNA in roots compared with all aerial organs, such as leaves, stems, and flowers, in both young seedlings and mature plants (Fig. 1). The expression pattern was consistent with the developmental expression profile from the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and the Translatome database (Supplemental Fig. S1B). To investigate if SWEET17 and SWEET16 are the only SWEET genes highly expressed in roots, we performed qRT-PCR to analyze expression levels of all 17 Arabidopsis SWEET genes in roots. Under the condition tested, SWEET17 and SWEET16 genes, which are part of clade IV (CITATION), were the most highly expressed SWEET genes; a few other SWEET genes were expressed at low levels in roots (Fig. 7). The pattern was consistent with the expression profile derived from the AtGeneExpress database (Supplemental Fig. S9B). [[FIGURE]] To analyze the tissue-specific expression of SWEET16 proteins, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis expressing C-terminal translational fusions to GUS and GFP under the control of the native SWEET16 promoter (SWEET16-GUS/GFP), again using the full-length genomic SWEET16 gene. Similar to SWEET17, both SWEET16-GUS fusion proteins and promoter activity were mainly detected in roots (Supplemental Fig. S10, A and B). SWEET16 fusions accumulated predominantly in the cortex of mature roots (Supplemental Fig. S10, C and D). The cell type-specific expression was consistent with the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) and the Translatome database (Supplemental Fig. S2C). Confocal images of intact roots in homozygous transformed seedlings clearly demonstrated that the fluorescence of SWEET16-GFP fusion proteins localized to the vacuolar membrane in roots (Supplemental Fig. S10, E–G). To functionally characterize SWEET16 in planta, we obtained Arabidopsis sweet16 T-DNA insertion knockout mutants (Supplemental Fig. S11A) and generated a sweet17-1/sweet16-1 double mutant (Supplemental Fig. S11B) as well as SWEET16 overexpressor lines (Supplemental Fig. S11C). Vacuoles isolated from sweet17-1/sweet16-1 showed a marked decrease in Fru uptake activity (Supplemental Fig. S12A). Although overexpression of SWEET16 in leaves did not increase the Fru transport activity (Supplemental Fig. S12B), the Fru content in leaves was significantly decreased in response to cold stress (Supplemental Fig. S7B) compared with standard conditions (Supplemental Fig. S7A). These results imply that SWEET16 is probably involved in Fru transport in planta, although, under the conditions tested, to a much lower degree than SWEET17. Consistent with this observation, root growth of sweet16-1 and sweet16-2 seedlings was significantly more sensitive to 0.5% to 2% (w/v) of Fru than the wild type (Fig. 8A). However, compared with sweet16 single mutants, the sweet17-1/sweet16-1 double mutant did not show enhanced sensitivity to excess Fru. Overexpression of SWEET16 significantly enhanced root growth at 0.5% to 2% (w/v) of Fru (Fig. 8B). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants and mutants used in this study are all in Columbia ecotype. Arabidopsis plants were grown with potting medium or solid agar media in a controlled growth room (22°C/18°C day/night temperature, 16-h-light/8-h-dark regime of approximately 100 μmol m–2 s–1 illumination). For treatments with excess sugars, surface sterilized seeds (30% [v/v] of concentrated bleach and 0.1% [v/v] triton) were stratified at 4°C in the dark for 3 d and sown on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid media supplemented with 1% (w/v) Suc. After 5 d of growth, similar sized seedlings were transferred to one-half-strength MS media supplemented with various concentrations of Fru, Glc, or Suc as indicated. Expression patterns of reporter genes were observed after 2 d of transfer. To analyze effects on root growth, lengths of primary roots were recorded after 6 d of transfer, and the relative root growth was determined using National Institutes of Health Image J 1.46v. For sugar content analysis, plants were grown in the growth chamber under 8-h-light/16-h-dark regime for 6 weeks. For treatment of cold stress, plants were grown for 5 weeks and subsequently transferred to a cooled growth chamber (4°C) for 1 week before analysis. For vacuole isolation, plants were grown for 4 to 5 weeks in a growth chamber under 8-h-light/16-h-dark regime, then transferred to low-light condition (40 μmol m–2 s–1) for 5 d before isolation. For liquid culture, seedlings were grown for 7 d on a mesh with MS solid media containing 1% (w/v) Suc. Plants were then transferred to MS liquid media containing 1% to 2% (w/v) Suc and cultured for 16 d before analysis. The MS or one-half-strength MS media used in this study included full or half strength of MS salt, respectively, 0.05% (w/v) MES, and 1.5% (w/v) agar for solid medium (adjust to pH 5.7 with KOH). For PSWEET17:GUS and PSWEET16:GUS transcriptional constructs, SWEET17 and SWEET16 promoter fragments containing the 5′ untranslated region were amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) and specific primers (5-PSWT17-BP and 3-PSWT17-BP for PSWEET17; 5-PSWT16-BP and 3-PSWT16-BP for PSWEET16). The resulting 2,746 bp and 1,521 fragments, respectively, were first cloned into pDONR221-f1 and then transferred to a binary vector, pWUGW, that contains a GUS reporter gene using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). For SWEET17-GUS/GFP and SWEET16-GUS/GFP translational constructs, the promoter fragments were first amplified from the pDONR221-f1 clones mentioned above and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The promoter fragments were then cloned via PstI and KpnI sites into pMDC32-SWEET17 and pMDC32-SWEET16 constructs (refer to the section “Overexpression of SWEET17 and SWEET16 in Arabidopsis“) to replace the 35S promoter in those plasmids. The full PSWEET17-SWEET17 and PSWEET16-SWEET16 genomic fragments were then amplified using Phusion polymerase, cloned into pGEM-T Easy, digested, and subcloned into SacII and PstI sites of pUTKan or pGTkan harboring the GUS or GFP reporter gene, respectively. All constructs were transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 PGV3850 and flower dipping method (CITATION). Transformants were identified on one-half-strength MS medium containing 50 μg mL–1 kanamycin. For analysis of reporter gene expression, plants from six independent transgenic lines were examined for each construct. Patterns of gene expression were consistent within a construct, and representative three homozygous lines were further analyzed in other experiments. Sequences of primers are listed in Supplemental Table S1. Expression of transcriptional or translational fusions of the GUS reporter gene was analyzed by histochemical staining. Transgenic plants or excised plant tissues were stained at 37°C for 2 or 4 h as indicated using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronic acid solution (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm each of potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide, 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 0.25 mg ml–1 X-glucuronidecyclohexylamine salt). After staining, tissues were cleared by replacing the staining solution with several changes of 70% (v/v) and 90% (v/v) ethanol as necessary. Fluorescence imaging of plants expressing SWEET17-GFP and SWEET16-GFP was performed on a Carl Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope (Instrument Development Center, National Cheng Kung University). Seedlings were incubated in 6 μm of FM4-64 (Invitrogen) for 5 min before imaging to visualize the plasma membrane. GFP was visualized by excitation with an argon laser at 488 nm and spectral detector set between 500 and 545 nm for the emission. The red fluorescence of FM4-64 was visualized by excitation with an argon laser at 561 nm and spectral detector set between 566 and 585 nm for the emission. The T-DNA insertion mutants for SWEET17 (sweet17-1 and sweet17-2; CITATION) and SWEET16 (sweet16-1 and sweet16-2) were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress): SM_3_15143, as sweet16-1, and SM_3_30077, as sweet16-2. To confirm the homozygosity of T-DNA insertion lines, gene-specific primers were used to examine wild-type alleles (swt17-1-RP and swt17-1-LP for sweet17-1; swt17-2-RP and SWT17-5-UTR for sweet17-2; swt16-1-RP and swt16-1-LP for sweet16-1; and swt16-2-RP and swt16-2-LP for sweet16-2). Locations of T-DNA insertions in sweet16 mutants were confirmed by sequencing PCR products amplified with gene-specific primers (swt16-1-RP and swt16-2-RP) and the corresponding T-DNA left border primer (Spm32). The positions were located at 32 and 945 bp downstream of the translational start codon, corresponding to the fourth and the first exon in the sweet16-1 and sweet16-2 mutant, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S11A). To confirm the expression level, RT-PCR was performed with specific primers (SWT17-5-UTR and swt17-1-LP for SWEET17; SWT16-5-UTR and SWT16-3-UTR for SWEET16) to amplify the full-length of cDNA. Sequences of primers were listed in Supplemental Table S1. To express SWEET17 and SWEET16 under the control of the 35S promoter, full-length SWEET17/SWEET16 genomic sequences including all introns were amplified using Phusion polymerase with gene-specific primers (SWT17-5-UTR-BP and SWT17-3-UTR-BP for SWEET17 and SWT16-5-UTR-BP and SWT16-3-UTR-BP for SWEET16). The resulting 2,856- and 2,119-bp fragments were cloned into pDONR221-f1 and then transferred to a binary vector pMDC32 (CITATION) via Gateway technology. The resulting plasmids, pMDC32-SWEET17, pMDC32-SWEET16, and the corresponding empty vector pMDC32 without the Gateway cassette, were transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis plants using the A. tumefaciens strain C58 PGV3850 and flower dipping method (CITATION). Transformants were identified on one-half-strength MS medium containing 25 μg mL–1 hygromycin B. Six single-copy T2 lines were obtained, and three homozygous lines of highest expression were used in this study. Sequences of primers were listed in Supplemental Table S1. For aerial tissues in mature plants, total mRNA was isolated from leaves, stems, flowers, and siliques of 7- to 8-week-old soil-grown plants. For mRNA from young seedlings, shoots and roots of 2-week-old plants or 7-d-old whole seedlings grown on one-half-strength MS agar were harvested for extraction. To analyze expression in mature roots, total mRNA was isolated from roots of 23-d-old liquid-cultured seedlings. Total mRNA was isolated using TRIsure (Bioline) reagent or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacture. The resulting cDNA produced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (Qiagen) was diluted and used as the template and subjected to 25 to 30 cycles of PCR reaction (94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 40 s) using Taq DNA polymerase and a pair of gene-specific primers as indicated. Amplification of an Actin cDNA (Actin2, At3G18780) using Act2-F and Act2-R primers (Supplemental Table S1) was used to normalize results from different samples. For RT-PCR, samples were separated on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. For real-time quantitative PCR, the amplification was performed using HotStart-IT SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (USB) or KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a 7300 PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression level was determined by comparing with the expression of Actin2 (1,000 × 2–[CtSWEET–CtActin2]), where Ct represents the threshold cycle. The gene-specific primers used in qRT-PCR for 17 Arabidopsis SWEET genes were listed in Supplemental Table S1. Ground, freeze-dried Arabidopsis rosette leaf material (approximately 0.5 g fresh weight) was extracted in 800 μL ice-cold 0.7 m perchloric acid for 5 min with intermittent mixing, using a Mixer Mill (Retsch). All the subsequent steps were carried out between 0°C and 4°C. After centrifugation (5 min, 5,000g, 4°C), 600 μL of supernatant (soluble fraction) was adjusted to the pH between 5 to 6 by adding 2 m KOH, 0.4 m MES, and 0.4 m KCl (approximately 0.4 mL mL–1 supernatant). Precipitated potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000g, 4°C). For desalting, samples of the neutralized soluble fraction (250 μL) were applied to sequential 1.5-mL columns of Dowex 50 W and Dowex 1 (Sigma-Aldrich). The neutral compounds were eluted with 5 mL of water, lyophilized, and redissolved in 200 μL of water. Soluble sugars (Glc, Suc, and Fru) were separated using High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection on a Dionex PA-20 column (Thermo Scientific), according to the following conditions: eluent A, 100 mm NaOH; eluent B, 150 mm NaOH and 500 mm sodium acetate. At a flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1, the gradient was as follows: 0 to 7 min, 100% (v/v) A and 0% (v/v) B; 7 to 26.5 min, a concave gradient to 20% (v/v) A and 80% (v/v) B (maltooligosaccharide elution); 26.5 to 32 min, hold at 20% (v/v) A and 80% (v/v) B (column wash step); and 32 to 40 min, step to 100% (v/v) A and 0% (v/v) B (column reequilibration). Peaks were identified by coelution with known maltooligosaccharide standards. Peak areas were determined using Chromeleon software (Dionex, Thermo Scientific). Vacuoles were isolated as described by CITATION with some minor modifications. Firstly, to isolate mesophyll protoplasts, the abaxial epidermis of mature healthy leaves was abraded using sandpaper (P500). The abraded leaves were floated on medium A (0.5 m sorbitol, 1 mm CaCl2 2H2O, and 10 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.6) containing 1% (w/v) Cellulase R10 and 0.5% (w/v) Mazerozyme R10 for 1.5 h at 30°C. The released protoplasts were collected by centrifugation for 8 min at 400g (4°C) on a cushion of osmotically stabilized Percoll (100% [v/v] Percoll, 0.5 m sorbitol, 1 mm CaCl2 2H2O, and 10 mm MES, pH 6). The supernatant was aspired, and the sedimented protoplasts were resuspended in the residual solution, which was completed to a final Percoll concentration of 40% (v/v) with the osmotically stabilized Percoll. A Percoll gradient was formed by overlayering the suspended protoplasts with 3:7 (v/v) mix of Percoll (pH 7.2; 500 mm sorbitol and 20 mm HEPES in Percoll 100% [v/v]) and medium B (400 mm sorbitol, 30 mm potassium gluconate, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with imidazole), overlaid with medium B containing 1 mg mL–1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) . After centrifugation for 8 min at 250g (4°C), the protoplasts were recovered from the upper interphase and lysed with the same volume of prewarmed (42°C) lysis medium (200 mm sorbitol, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with KOH, 10% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.2 mg mL–1 BSA, and 1 mm DTT) under 37°C for a maximum of 10 min. Vacuoles were purified by overlaying 5 mL of the lysate with 5 mL of 1:1 fresh lysis medium/medium C (400 mm betaine, 30 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with imidazole, 1 mg mL–1 BSA, and 1 mm DTT) and 1 mL medium C. After centrifugation for 8 min at 1,300g (4°C), the vacuoles were recovered from the interface between the middle and upper layer. Microscopic analysis indicated that contamination with intact protoplasts was less than 3%. Transport experiments were performed using silicone oil centrifugation technique as described previously (CITATION). The Michaelis-Menten nonlinear least-square regression fits were calculated using the SSmicmen function without initial parameters within the nls function of R 2.14.0 (http://www.R-project.org).
