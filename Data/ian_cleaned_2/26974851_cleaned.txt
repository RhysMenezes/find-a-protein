!~RES~! Three individual plants presenting retarded growth were selected from the screened seed pools containing OE AP2/ERF transcription factors (Weiste et al., CITATION). The sequencing of OE plants identified three independent ORA47 lines: P35S:ORA47 OE1, OE2, and OE3 (Fig. 1a). The ORA47 mRNA expression level of the P35S:ORA47 OE lines was also analyzed (Fig. 1b). T3 and T4 homozygotes of these lines were used for further characterization. The rosette diameter of 35‐d‐old WT plants was between 7 and 10 cm, whereas the rosette diameters of the P35S:ORA47 plants were 2 and 4 cm. The bolting time of P35S:ORA47 was c. 35 d, which was c. 7 d after the bolting time of the WT plants when grown under normal conditions. A water stress test was applied to the 3‐wk‐old plants, and the P35S:ORA47 plants were more sensitive to water stress relative to the WT plants. A similar result was obtained in the water loss test, which was performed by drying 14‐d‐old rosettes without roots on the bench top and then weighing every 10 min to measure the rate of water loss (Fig. 1c).  [[FIGURE]] Because the P35S:ORA47 plants were sensitive to dehydration, we suspected that their endogenous proline level might be different from that of the WT plants under water stress. The OE3 and WT plants were grown under normal soil conditions for 2 wk, and then water was withheld for 7 d. The proline level was significantly higher in the WT plants than in the P35S:ORA47 plants after 7 d of water stress; however, differences were not observed when the plants were grown under normal conditions and at the early stage of water stress (Fig. 1d). We further investigated the seed germination sensitivity to ABA. At 1 μM ABA, the germination rate of the WT seeds dropped to 40%, whereas the P35S:ORA47 seeds maintained a rate of 80–100% (Fig. 1e). The germination rates of the P35S:ORA47 seeds treated with 2–3 μM ABA were also much higher than that of the WT seeds, indicating that P35S:ORA47 seed germination is insensitive to ABA. We also measured stomatal apertures using leaf epidermal strips treated with light, dark and ABA. These results indicated that ORA47 overexpression reduced the sensitivity of stomatal aperture to dark and ABA (Fig. 1f,g). We further examined stomatal movements in response to applied Ca2+ or SA, also known to close the stomata (Mori et al., CITATION; Khokon et al., CITATION). These results also showed that the stomatal aperture of ORA47OE lines did not response to Ca2+ or SA either (Fig. 1f,g). Transient expression in protoplasts showed that ORA47‐GFP was localized in the nucleus (Fig. S1), which is consistent with the function of ORA47 as a transcription factor.  To determine the ORA47 expression patterns under stress, we dried 2‐wk‐old A. thaliana plants for 15 min, and then allowed them to recover for another 15 min. ORA47 mRNA induction was detected in the first 15 min of water stress and reached a peak at 2 h (Fig. 2a). ORA47 expression was also tested by spraying 10 μM ABA on the 2‐wk‐old WT plants. In response to ABA, ORA47 induction was observed at 15 min and peaked at 30 min, and it subsequently declined dramatically (Fig. 2b).  [[FIGURE]] Histochemical β‐glucuronidase (GUS) staining was used to compare ORA47 induction among the water stress, wounding and ABA treatments. A 1.4‐kb promoter region of ORA47 was used to prepare PORA47:GUS transgenic plants. WT and PORA47:GUS T3 homozygous transgenic plants grown on § MS plates were used for GUS staining. GUS staining was detected in the vascular tissue at the cotyledon tips of the PORA47:GUS plants before the stress treatments (Fig. 2c2,c3). ORA47 was highly expressed in response to water stress, wounding, and application of 10 μM ABA (Fig. 2c4–c12). However, the ABA induction of GUS activity was lower than that observed in response to water stress or wounding.  Based on our observations that ORA47 mRNA expression was induced by water stress and ABA treatment, we searched the ORA47 promoter for ABA‐related cis‐elements using AthaMap (http://www.athamap.de/). We found that a homeodomain‐leucine zipper (HDZip) class I protein binding site (CAATTATTG) (Johannesson et al., CITATION) was located at a position between −651 and −642 (Fig. 3a). Himmelbach et al. (CITATION) reported that the homeobox protein 6 (AtHB6), a HDZip class I protein, physically interacts with ABI1 and regulates ABA signaling, and they also reported that, when the binding site is modified, AtHB6 loses its binding ability. To elucidate the roles of ATHB6 and ABI1 in ORA47 expression activation, we produced luciferase reporter constructs containing the 1.4‐kb ORA47 promoter (PORA47) and a promoter with a mutation in the putative AtHB6 binding site (PORA47‐PM) (Fig. 3b). We also cloned P35S:ORA47, P35S:AtHB6, and P35S:ABI1 as effectors (Fig. 3b). The greatest activation was achieved by the combination of AtHB6 and ABI1 (Fig. 3c), whereas only a medium level of activation was observed with AtHB6 or ABI1 alone. When the PORA47‐PM reporter was introduced with AtHB6 and ABI1 into the protoplasts, activation was not observed (Fig. 3c). The results suggested that activation of ORA47 is involved in the binding of AtHB6 to the ORA47 promoter. Thus, ORA47 may be a direct target of AtHB6 activation, and ABI1 may also be required for the increased activation of ORA47 expression. These results also indicated that ORA47 mRNA expression could not be induced by ORA47 itself (Fig. 3c).  [[FIGURE]] Because the P35S:ORA47 plants presented a drought‐sensitive and ABA‐insensitive phenotype (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that the ABA negative regulator PP2C might have been activated in the ORA47 OE lines. When we analyzed the mRNA expression levels of the ABA‐related genes in the P35S:ORA47 transgenic plants, we found that ABI2 expression in the ORA47 OE1 and OE3 lines were five‐fold and two‐fold higher than that of the WT plants, respectively (Fig. 3d). We constructed ORA47 RNAi lines for further study and found that the expression of ABI2 mRNA in the RNAi‐1 and RNAi‐4 lines was c. 57% and 70% of the expression in the WT plants, respectively (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the morphology and drought resistance of the RNAi lines were not different from those of the WT plants. To confirm the regulatory relationship between ABI, ORA47 and ABI2 under stress conditions, 2‐wk‐old WT plants and RNAi‐1 and RNAi‐4 lines were subjected to water stress, and the expression of ORA47 in the RNAi‐1 and RNAi‐4 lines was 28% and 18% of the expression in the WT plants, respectively, and the expression of ABI2 in the RNAi‐1 and RNAi‐4 lines was 30% and 15% of the expression in the WT plants, respectively (Fig. 3d). However, the ABI1 mRNA level in the RNAi‐1 and RNAi‐4 lines was approximately the same as that of the WT plants under normal conditions, whereas the level in the RNAi‐1 and RNAi‐4 lines was reduced to 79% and 69% under water stress, respectively. This result suggests that ORA47 may play an important role in regulating ABI2 gene expression under normal and water stress conditions but has less of an effect on ABI1 gene expression. Accordingly, ORA47 might act upstream of ABI2. ABI1 is a positive regulator of ORA47 expression, and, to investigate whether ABI1 acts upstream of ORA47, the ABI1, ORA47 and ABI2 mRNA levels were compared among 2‐wk‐old plants of the ABI1 knockout line abi1, the dominant mutant line abi1‐1, the Col‐0 line, and the Ler‐0 line. As shown in Fig. 3(e), ABI2 expression in the abi1 knockout mutant was reduced by 70% compared with that of the WT plants, and ORA47 expression was reduced by half. However, the ORA47 expression level was 1.7 times higher and the ABI2 expression level was 2.5 times higher in the abi1‐1 mutant line relative to the Ler‐0 line (Fig. 3f). Based on these results, which are shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f), we suggest that ABI1 might act upstream of ORA47 and ABI2.  To test the hypothesis that ABI2 is a direct downstream target of ORA47 regulation, the promoter of ABI2 was investigated. No known binding sequences of AP2/ERF domain transcription factors were found. The binding ability of ORA47 has not been investigated for the four known cis‐elements of the AP2/ERF domain transcription (Gong et al., CITATION). Subsequently, we found that ORA47 did not bind to a GCC box, which is one of the AP2/ERF binding cis‐elements, and the transcriptional activation domain of ORA47 was located in the C‐terminus between amino acids 139 and 195 (Fig. S2). This finding suggests that ORA47 might bind to an unknown cis‐element in the ABI2 promoter. To test this possibility, we generated a luciferase reporter controlled by 1015 bp of the ABI2 promoter sequence (PABI2). A transient expression assay with P35S:ORA47 as an effector showed that ABI2 promoter activity was indeed induced by P35S:ORA47 (Fig. 4a,b).  [[FIGURE]] We further divided the ABI2 1015‐bp promoter sequence into five overlapping fragments that included PABI2‐1 (−1015/−679), PABI2‐2 (−679/−405), PABI2‐3 (−405/−1), PABI2‐4 (−438/−179), and PABI2‐5 (−912/−616), and each fragment was joined with a 140‐bp 35S minimal promoter. Only PABI2‐2 and PABI2‐4 were activated by ORA47 (Fig. 4b; PABI2‐2 and PABI2‐4), and PABI2‐2 overlapped with PABI2‐4 by 34 bp (−438/−405). We then constructed a reporter containing only the 34‐bp overlapping region fused to the 35S minimal promoter and found that this reporter was activated by ORA47 to a similar extent as the full‐length promoter or PABI2‐2 construct (Fig. 4b, 34 bp). We attempted to narrow down the 34 bp further but failed to obtain clear results. Accordingly, we propose that the ORA47‐binding cis‐element is located within this 34‐bp promoter region (−438/−405) of ABI2.  To further elucidate the ORA47 binding sequence, we produced P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic lines. The ORA47‐GR fusion protein binds to dexamethasone (DEX), a ligand of GR, and then translocates to the nucleus to regulate the mRNA expression of its target genes. To identify genes that are directly regulated by ORA47, the P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic line 4 was grown under normal conditions and treated with DEX and cycloheximide (CYC) to block protein synthesis to prevent secondary transcriptional regulation downstream of ORA47 regulation. The gene expression patterns were then analyzed using a microarray.  To exclude genes that were induced by DEX and CYC as well as genes from the transgenic plant background, analyses of two sets of microarrays were performed (Fig. S3). One microarray was composed of P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic plants treated with CYC for 1 h and then DEX for 2 h and P35S:ORA47‐GR plants treated only with CYC as the control, and the other microarray was composed of P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic plants treated with CYC for 1 h and then DEX for 2 h and WT plants treated with DEX and CYC as the control. The data sets of the microarray analysis are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The common up‐regulated genes obtained from these two data sets were considered to represent the putative ORA47 direct downstream genes. The 1‐kb promoter regions of the 100 most highly up‐regulated genes (fold change > 4.1) were analyzed using the eTFBS program (http://biominer.csie.cyu.edu.tw/etfbs/) (Chen et al., CITATION). We found a conserved sequence, ACCGNCCAAT (N refers to A, T, G, C), in the promoter region of 49 of these 100 genes (Fig. 4c), and this putative cis‐element was referred to as the O‐box. The same ORA47‐binding cis‐element ((A/G)CCG(A/T)CC(A/T)) has also been found using protein‐binding microarrays (Franco‐Zorrilla et al., CITATION). A comparison of the 34‐bp ORA47‐binding region in the ABI2 promoter (Fig. 4b) with the bioinformatic predictions (Fig. 4c) led us to hypothesize that the sequence GTCGACCAAT of the ABI2 promoter (−426/−416) is the ORA47‐binding cis‐element responsible for ORA47 regulation of ABI2. The putative O‐boxes from the 500 most up‐regulated genes of the P35S:ORA47‐GR microarray data set are listed in Table S2. We then created a reporter construct in which the putative ORA47‐binding cis‐element of the ABI2 promoter (−426/−416) was deleted (PABI2▵cis; Fig. 4a), and the results showed that the luciferase reporter activity was no longer induced by ORA47. Thus, the GTCGACCAAT sequence is responsible for ORA47 up‐regulation of ABI2 and is probably the site of ORA47 promoter binding.  For the down‐regulated genes in the microarray data set, enrichment of any specific cis‐element was not observed using the eTFBS program. However, we manually searched the promoter region of the down‐regulated genes and found that certain promoters contained the conserved O‐box. A number of these promoters were selected for further experiments.  To demonstrate the direct binding of ORA47 to the putative O‐box, we performed electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) using a recombinant GST‐ORA47 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the 30‐bp DIG‐labeled probe CABI2 (probe sequence shown in Fig. 4e) specifically bound the DIG‐labeled CABI2 probe (indicated by an arrow), although the addition of the unlabeled CABI2 probe reduced the extent of the binding. A probe containing the putative O‐box in the ABI1 promoter (CABI1; TCCGTCCAAT) also showed ORA47 binding (Fig. 4d).  Because the O‐box for ORA47 binding predicted by bioinformatics was slightly different from the O‐box in the ABI2 promoter, we designed another probe corresponding to the predicted O‐box (ACCGACCAAT, labeled as Cp in Fig. 4e) and 13 other point‐mutated probes (M1–M13) to test the importance of each base for ORA47 binding (Fig. 4e). ORA47 binding to the Cp probe was similar to the binding of CABI1 and CABI2. The probes M9 and M12 also showed relatively strong binding; however, other mutated probes did not bind ORA47 (Fig. 4f). Our findings support the model summarized in Fig. 4(g), whereby ORA47 expression is regulated by the cooperative action of AtHB6 and ABI1, and ORA47 subsequently regulates the expression of ABI2 under normal and water stress conditions. ORA47 might also regulate the expression of ABI1.  Based on the earlier analysis, the consensus ORA47 binding motif is (NC/GT) CGNCCA. Once this variation in the first two bases was taken into account, we observed that many of the genes up‐regulated by ORA47 in Table S2 contained more than two O‐boxes in their 1‐kb promoter regions.  To identify the biological functions of the direct downstream genes regulated by ORA47, we scanned the 500 most up‐regulated genes in the P35S:ORA47‐GR microarray data set and identified 334 genes containing at least one putative O‐box in their promoter region. A gene ontology analysis (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/index.php) showed that ORA47 may be involved in developmental processes, stimulus responses, biological regulation, localization and transporter activity (Fig. S4) because these categories were overrepresented in the 344 putative ORA47‐regulated genes. We also observed many phytohormone‐related genes in the 334 up‐regulated genes in Table S2. The Gene Ontology Consortium website (http://geneontology.org/) was used to identify genes categorized as phytohormones.  Table S2 shows that many phytohormone genes related to biosynthesis and signaling were up‐regulated, suggesting that ORA47 might directly regulate the transcription of these genes. We selected 31 genes containing O‐boxes for further validation of ORA47 binding (Fig. 5a; Table 1) and performed ChIP assays of the PORA47:ORA47‐GFP transgenic plants subjected to several conditions. The Actin 2 ORF and NC sequence, which are located at position −1721 from the ABI2 transcription start site (Fig. 5a), were used as internal negative controls in the ChIP assay.  [[FIGURE]] Promoter binding of ORA47 was clearly dependent on both the specific gene under study and the environmental conditions to which the plants were exposed. For example, ORA47 bound to the O‐box of the ABI1 and ABI2 promoters only under normal conditions and not under stress conditions. Similarly, the ABA biosynthesis genes NINE‐CIS‐EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 3 (NCED3) and NCED9 and the ABA‐responsive gene RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION 26 (RD26) were regulated by ORA47 under normal and wounding conditions but not under water stress conditions. ORA47 presented different binding patterns with the O‐box in the promoters of JA biosynthesis genes, including DEFECTIVE ANTHER DEHISCENCE 1 (DAD1), LIPOXYGENASE 2 (LOX2), ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS), ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE 1, 2 and 3 (AOC1), AOC2, AOC3, OXOPHYTODIENOATE‐REDUCTASE 3 (OPR3), JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1), and signaling genes, including MYC2 and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 1 (ERF1), under the three conditions. Furthermore, we discovered that O‐boxes occur in the promoter regions of biosynthesis and signaling genes of additional phytohormones, including GA, BR, ethylene, SA, CK, IAA and SL (Fig. 5b; Table 1). For example, ORA47 bound to the O‐boxes of genes related to GA deactivation, including GIBBERELLIN 2‐OXIDASE 4 (GA2ox4), GA2ox6 and GA2ox8 (Schomburg et al., CITATION; Wang et al., CITATION; Jasinski et al., CITATION), the BR signaling inhibitor BRI1 KINASE INHIBITOR 1 (BKI1), and the BRI1‐LIKE 1 (BRL1) and BRL3 receptors (Caño‐Delgado et al., CITATION) under normal and wounding conditions but not under water stress conditions.  The ethylene biosynthesis gene 1‐AMINO‐CYCLOPROPANE‐1‐CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE 8 (ACS8), the signaling gene CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1 (CTR1), the SA biosynthesis gene ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1), and the signaling gene PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4) also contain the O‐box. ORA47 might regulate ACS8 and ICS1 under normal and water stress conditions, whereas ORA47 appeared only to bind to the CTR1 O‐box under wounding conditions. However, PAD4 was not controlled by ORA47 under any of the tested conditions (Fig. 5b). O‐boxes were also found in the promoters of CK biosynthesis genes (ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE 3 and 7 (ITP3 and IPT7)), SL biosynthesis genes (MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING 3 and 4 (MAX3 and MAX4)), and IAA transporter genes (PIN‐LIKES 5 (PILS5) and PIN‐FORMED 2 (PIN2)). ORA47 was bound to the O‐box of CK and IAA genes only under wounding conditions. Similar to ABA‐, GA‐ and BR‐related genes, the O‐boxes in the promoter regions of the MAX3 and MAX4 genes were bound by ORA47 under both normal and wounding conditions. ORA47 was found to bind to the typical O‐box as well as to the ‘O‐box‐like’ sequence. For example, ORA47 bound to the sequence TGCGACCAAA in the promoter of MYC2 under normal and wounding conditions, AACGCCCAAT in the promoter of PIN2 under wounding conditions, and TACGACCTAA in the promoter of ERF1 under water stress conditions (Fig. 5; Table 1). Based on these results, we concluded that CGNCC is the core sequence of the O‐box.  In the ChIP assay discussed in the previous section, it was generally unclear how the pattern of ORA47 promoter associations in different conditions correlated with expression changes, either activation or repression. In the P35S:ORA47‐GR microarray data set, we noticed that the up‐regulated genes contained the O‐box in their promoters and certain down‐regulated genes also contained the O‐box. This finding suggested that ORA47 could also mediate transcriptional suppression. To test the hypothesis that ORA47 acts as an activator and a repressor, 12‐d‐old WT plants and P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic lines 4 and 10 were treated with 20 μM DEX and then subjected to water stress or wounding (Fig. 6a), and the mRNA levels of nine selected genes that showed binding to the O‐box in the ChIP assay were measured at 0, 15 and 45 min (Fig. 6b–j). To determine whether a gene is repressed or activated, we estimated the slope of the regression curve generated from the three expression values at 0, 15 and 45 min for the WT plants and P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic lines (Table S3). If a specific gene in the transgenic line presented a higher or lower slope than that of the WT, the gene was considered to be activated or repressed, respectively. Additionally, the gene expression patterns of the WT and P35S:ORA47‐GR plants treated with DEX only and water stress or wounding without DEX were also analyzed (Fig. S5). This background information was useful for predicting whether ORA47 is an activator or repressor (for a further explanation, see the legend to Fig. S5). Accordingly, the genes NCED3, NCED9, DAD1, IPT3 and MYC2 under wounding and AOC3, OPR3 and ERF1 under water stress were found to be activated by ORA47 overexpression, whereas the gene BKI1 was repressed under wounding. NCED3 did not present promoter binding under water stress but showed repressed gene expression, suggesting that ORA47 overexpression might act as a repressor of NCED3 expression under water stress. We propose that ORA47 might act as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the gene and the conditions.  [[FIGURE]] In the previous section, we showed that ORA47 activates ABA (NCED3 and NCED9; Fig. 6b,c) and JA biosynthesis and signaling genes (DAD1 and MYC2; Fig. 6d,g) in the ORA47‐GR transgenic lines under wounding conditions. Moreover, under water stress, certain JA biosynthesis and signaling genes were activated (AOC3 and ERF1; Fig. 6e,h), although the ABA biosynthesis gene NCED3 was not (Figs 5b, 6b). Therefore, we hypothesized that JA content would be increased under both stresses, while the ABA content would only be increased under wounding in the P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic lines. To observe the physiological effect of ORA47 expression under stress, it is essential to measure the concentrations of JA and ABA in the WT and ORA47‐GR lines. Twelve‐day‐old WT plants and P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic lines 4 and 10 were treated with water stress or wounding, and the ABA and JA concentrations were analyzed (Fig. 7).  [[FIGURE]] We observed that the ABA contents in lines 4 and 10 were higher than that in the WT plants under normal conditions (Fig. 7a), and the ABA content in lines 4 and 10 was slightly but significantly increased under the DEX treatment compared with that of the WT plants (Student's t‐test). Water stress in the WT plants increased the ABA content, which showed an eight‐fold increase at 2 h compared with that recorded at baseline, whereas only 3.7‐ and 2.5‐fold increases were observed in lines 4 and 10, respectively. Wounding for 2 h slightly but significantly increased the ABA accumulation in lines 4 and 10 compared with that in the WT plants (Student's t‐test). Subsequently, we observed that the JA content was induced in transgenic lines after the DEX treatment under normal conditions (Fig. 7b). Wounding for 1 h greatly increased the JA accumulation in lines 4 and 10 compared with that in the WT plants (Student's t‐test). Water stress also increased the JA content but to a lesser extent relative to that after wounding. These results are consistent with the results of the ChIP assay (Fig. 5) and the gene expression assay of the P35S:ORA47‐GR transgenic lines subjected to the stress treatments (Fig. 6). Fig. 7(b) also shows that OPDA, an intermediate of JA biosynthesis, slightly increased under stress treatment for 1 h but still maintained low accumulation levels. The significance of the differences between the mean values for the DEX treatment, genotypes and stress treatments were assessed using a two‐way ANOVA (Table S4). The ANOVA results were consistent with those of Student's t‐test (shown in Fig. 7), thus indicating that ORA47 overexpression indeed had a significant effect on ABA, OPDA and JA accumulation when the plant was under stress conditions. 
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh ecotypes Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler‐0) were used in this study. Arabidopsis thaliana transformations performed with Col‐0 included the ORA47‐RNAi, PORA47:GUS, P35S:ORA47‐glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PORA47:ORA47‐GFP transgenic lines. To generate the ORA47‐RNAi transgenic plants, forward and reverse oligo primers of a gene‐specific ORA47 cDNA fragment (CCAAGACATTGTCAAGGGAGAAGAAG AATCGGGTTTAGTACCCGGATCCG) were synthesized and annealed using PCR and then cloned into pCR8 and the RNAi vector pB7GWIWG2(I) (VIB, Ghent, Belgium). The primers ORA47‐5 and ORA47‐3 were used for the full‐length open reading frame (ORF) of ORA47, whereas ORA47‐P‐1 and ORA47‐P‐2 were used for a 1.4‐kb promoter region of ORA47. The primers ORA47‐P‐1 and ORA47‐3 were used for PORA47:ORA47 cloning. The sequences of the primers are listed in Supporting Information Table S1. A cloned vector was introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, and wild‐type (WT) A. thaliana plants were transformed by floral dipping. The seeds of these plants were sterilized with 0.5% bleach and 0.1% Triton X‐100 and then plated on § Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium with 1% sucrose and 0.7% agar. To induce synchronous germination, the seeds were treated with vernalization in dark conditions for 3 d and then transferred to a walk‐in growth chamber at 22°C under a 16 h : 8 h, light : dark photoperiod.  The water stress and wounding conditions were modified from a previous study (Kilian et al., CITATION). For the water stress treatment, the plants were grown on a § MS plate for 12–14 d and then air‐dried using laminar flow with the cover removed for 15 min followed by recovery for 15 min before sample harvesting. In the wounding treatment, forceps were used to pinch the leaves of 2‐wk‐old plants, and then the plants were allowed to recover for 30 min.  For details of the quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT)‐PCR analysis, see Methods S1. For details of the determination of proline, ABA, 12‐oxo‐phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and JA contents, see Methods S2.  For the stomatal aperture measurements, epidermal peels were stripped from fully expanded leaves of 5‐wk‐old plants and floated in a solution of 30 mM KCl and 10 mM MES‐KOH (pH 6.15) in Petri dishes. After incubation for 2.5 h under white light at 22°C to induce stomatal opening, different concentrations of ABA, 100 μM CaCl2 or 1 mM SA (Khokon et al., CITATION; Mori et al., CITATION; Ramírez et al., CITATION) were added under light for another 2.5 h. The stomatal apertures were recorded with an Olympus BX51 system microscope and analyzed using Dp‐psw software (Olympus, Shinjuku‐ku, Tokyo, Japan). More than 130 stomata of the P35S:ORA47 OVEREXPRESSED 3 (OE3) and WT plants each were measured using the ImageJ 1.36b software (Broken Symmetry Software; http://brokensymmetry.com).  The A. thaliana protoplast transient expression assay has been described previously (Yoo et al., CITATION). The effectors, reporters, and control vectors were obtained from Dr Masaru Ohme‐Takagia (Gene Discovery Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan) (Ohta et al., CITATION) and Dr Chiu‐Ping Cheng (Institute of Plant Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan). Full‐length or partial ORA47 ORF sequences were individually cloned into pK2GW7 (VIB) as effectors (see Fig. S2a later), and the same effector construction strategy was used for ABI1, A. thaliana HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 6 (AtHB6), and ORA47 (see Fig. 3b later). The reporters were constructed using the pKGWL7 vector (VIB). Primers ORA47‐P‐1 and ORA47‐P‐2 were used to clone a 1.4‐kb region of the ORA47 promoter (see Fig. 3b later). The AtHB6 binding site with a point mutation (PORA47‐PM) was constructed based on a PCR strategy using the primers P‐ORA47‐PM‐1.2 and P‐ORA47‐PM‐2.2 (Table S1).  The reporter construct PABI2 (see Fig. 4a later) containing the 1015‐bp ABI2 promoter region between −1015 and −1 was cloned based on a PCR strategy using the primers P‐ABI2‐Fw and P‐ABI2‐Rv2, whereas the reporters PABI2‐1, PABI2‐2, and PABI2‐3 were generated by digesting the ABI2 promoter with the EcoRI and AluI restriction enzymes at positions −679 and −404. The 1‐kb ABI2 promoter DNA was digested with ApoI at −438 and −179 to generate PABI2‐4 and digested with MspI at −912 and SpeI at −616 to generate PABI2‐5. A 34‐bp reporter was cloned with the primer 34‐TATA and reporter‐R, and PABI2▵cis was cloned with P‐ABI2‐Fw, P‐ABI2‐Rv2, ABI2 Tcis‐1, and ABI2 Tcis‐2 (Table S1).  For details of the ORA47‐GR microarray analysis, see Methods S3.  The ORA47‐(GST) Glutathione S‐transferase recombination protein preparation and a gel mobility shift assay were performed as previously described (Urao et al., CITATION). A 588‐bp ORF of ORA47 was cloned into the pGEX‐6P‐1 vector at the EcoRI site and then introduced into the Escherichia coli strain DE3. The probe CABI2 (TTTTTTGTCGACCAATTTTGATTAA AGCTC) was end‐labeled in the ABI2 promoter between −432 and −402 using Digoxigenin (DIG) as the hot probe. An unlabeled probe was used for the competition assays. The DIG‐labeled probes Cp, CABI1, CABI2, and M1–M13 were generated using PCR, and the sequences are listed in Fig. 4 (see later).  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed according to Gendrel et al. (CITATION) using c. 2 g of tissue from the PORA47:ORA47‐GFP transgenic lines and WT plants. Twelve‐day‐old plants grown on the § MS plate under normal conditions or treated with water stress or wounding were harvested to run the ChIP assay. In the water stress treatment, the plants were dried using laminar airflow for 15 min and then allowed to recover for 15 min, and they were then harvested for the ChIP assay. For the wounding treatment, forceps were used to pinch the leaves, and then the plants were allowed to recover for 30 min. The chromatin was sonicated to shear to c. 500 bp. After centrifugation (13 000 g; 4°C), the chromatin in the supernatant was measured using a NanoDrop analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples with equal amounts of chromatin were immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of GFP antibody (GFP‐Trap®_M; ChromoTek, Hauppauge, NY, USA). The relative fold enrichment of the input controls (samples without GFP antibody immunoprecipitation) and bound DNA was evaluated using real‐time PCR. KAPA SYBR Premix ExTaq was used for the real‐time PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA), which was performed with a Bio‐Rad MyiQTM real‐time PCR system (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The results of the real‐time PCR were analyzed with iQ5 software (Bio‐Rad). ACTIN 2 and a noncoding (NC) sequence at position −1721 from the ABI2 transcription start site were used as internal controls to normalize the results. Three individual biological samples were evaluated.
