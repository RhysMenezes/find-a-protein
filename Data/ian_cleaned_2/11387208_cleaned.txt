!~ABS~! Arabidopsis Snf1‐related protein kinases (SnRKs) are implicated in pleiotropic regulation of metabolic, hormonal and stress responses through their interaction with the kinase inhibitor PRL1 WD‐protein. Here we show that SKP1/ASK1, a conserved SCF (Skp1‐cullin‐F‐box) ubiquitin ligase subunit, which suppresses the skp1‐4 mitotic defect in yeast, interacts with the PRL1‐binding C‐terminal domains of SnRKs. The same SnRK domains recruit an SKP1/ASK1‐binding proteasomal protein, α4/PAD1, which enhances the formation of a trimeric SnRK complex with SKP1/ASK1 in vitro. By contrast, PRL1 reduces the interaction of SKP1/ASK1 with SnRKs. SKP1/ASK1 is co‐immunoprecipitated with a cullin SCF subunit (AtCUL1) and an SnRK kinase, but not with PRL1 from Arabidopsis cell extracts. SKP1/ASK1, cullin and proteasomal α‐subunits show nuclear co‐localization in differentiated Arabidopsis cells, and are observed in association with mitotic spindles and phragmoplasts during cell division. Detection of SnRK in purified 26S proteasomes and co‐purification of epitope‐ tagged SKP1/ASK1 with SnRK, cullin and proteasomal α‐subunits indicate that the observed protein interactions between SnRK, SKP1/ASK1 and α4/PAD1 are involved in proteasomal binding of an SCF ubiquitin ligase in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! Previous studies demonstrated that the catalytic subunits of Arabidopsis SnRKs AKIN10 and AKIN11 interact through their C‐terminal regulatory domains with the yeast Snf1 kinase subunits Snf4 and Sip1, and their plant orthologues in the two‐hybrid system (Jiang and Carlson, 1996, 1997; Bouly et al., 1999; Kleinow et al., 2000). The regulatory domains of AKIN10 and AKIN11 were also shown to bind the Arabidopsis PRL1 WD‐protein, which is an SnRK inhibitor in vitro. A role for SnRKs in signalling was suggested by genetic analysis of the prl1 mutation, which leads to enhanced activation of SnRKs, transcriptional derepression of sucrose‐regulated genes, and hypersensitivity to several plant hormones, including auxin (Németh et al., 1998; Bhalerao et al., 1999). To search for novel SnRK‐binding factors, AKIN10 and AKIN11 in fusion with the Gal4 DNA‐binding domain (GBD) were used as baits in yeast two‐hybrid screens with a pACT2 cDNA library made from cultured Arabidopsis cells (Németh et al., 1998). From 5 × 107 transformants in each screen, 59 clones with AKIN10 and 52 clones with AKIN11 were obtained that grew in the presence of 50 mM 3‐aminotriazole (3‐AT) HIS3‐inhibitor and displayed LacZ reporter enzyme activity (Durfee et al., 1993). Following control self‐activation tests and interaction assays with a range of unspecific baits (Németh et al., 1998; data not shown), sequencing of prey cDNAs identified 13 protein classes that showed two‐hybrid interactions with both AKIN10 and AKIN11. One class of AKIN‐interacting factors described here was represented by five cDNAs that all encoded a full‐length Arabidopsis SCF ubiquitin ligase subunit (Gray et al., 1999), SKP1/ASK1 (S phase kinase‐associated protein/Arabidopsis Skp1‐like; DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF059294), in fusion with the Gal4 activator domain (GAD). Another class included a single cDNA that encoded a peptide carrying 93 C‐terminal amino acids from the Arabidopsis 20S proteasome subunit α4/PAD1 (Fu et al., 1998; DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF043522). A previously published full‐length α4/PAD1 cDNA (TAS‐g64; Genschik et al., 1992) was used to construct a GAD–PAD1 prey. In control two‐hybrid assays, GAD–PAD1 showed interaction with GBD–AKIN11 as expected, as well as with a GBD–ASK1 bait, indicating that α4/PAD1 could also bind to SKP1/ASK1. A reversal of bait–prey combination (GBD–ASK1 versus GAD–AKIN10) confirmed interaction of SKP1/ASK1 with AKIN10 (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] The specificity of observed protein interactions was tested by in vitro pull‐down assays using glutathione S‐transferase (GST) fusion proteins. AKIN10 and AKIN11 labelled with [35S]methionine by coupled in vitro transcription–translation were incubated with GST–ASK1 and GST proteins immobilized on glutathione–Sepharose (GS), and with the GS matrix alone. AKIN10 and AKIN11 were specifically retained on GST–ASK1, but failed to bind to the control GST and GS resins (FIG-REF). The α4/PAD1 protein was similarly labelled with [35S]methionine and loaded on GS matrices carrying immobilized GST–ASK1, GST–AKIN10, GST–AKIN11 and GST proteins. α4/PAD1 showed specific binding in vitro to GST–AKIN10, GST–AKIN11 and GST–ASK1, but not to the control GST protein, supporting the results of yeast two‐hybrid protein interaction assays (FIG-REF). A two‐hybrid screen performed with a GBD–ASK1 bait resulted in the identification of Arabidopsis cDNAs encoding AKIN10. In addition, seven cDNA classes of SKIPs were characterized. Six SKIP cDNAs encoded F‐box proteins (Table I). These carried either leucine‐rich repeats (SKIPs 1 and 2), or kelch domains (SKIPs 4 and 6; Adams et al., 2000), or no known C‐terminal motifs (SKIP3 and 5). SKIP7 corresponded to fibrillarin (AtFIB1), an Arabidopsis orthologue of the nucleolar NOP1 protein (Barneche et al., 2000; Pih et al., 2000). Measurement of LacZ reporter enzyme activity in yeast cells grown under glucose limitation and on 2% glucose (Table I) indicated that all SKIP factors, except for SKIP5, interacted with SKP1/ASK1 in a glucose‐regulated fashion, as was previously reported for two‐hybrid interactions of yeast SCF components (Li and Johnston, 1997). [[TABLE]] SKP1/ASK shared 35% sequence identity with budding yeast Skp1, which reflected a significant conservation of C‐terminal protein domains. Amino acid positions corresponding to the yeast skp1‐3 (I‐172‐N) and skp1‐4 (L‐146‐S) mutations (FIG-REF), causing G1–S and mitotic defects, respectively (Connelly and Hieter, 1996), were conserved within this region of SKP1/ASK1. Expression of SKP1/ASK1 by a methionine‐repressible Met25 promoter (Mumberg et al., 1994) suppressed only the growth defect of the skp1‐4, but not that of the skp1‐3 thermosensitive yeast mutant, indicating an incomplete functional conservation between yeast Skp1 and Arabidopsis SKP1/ASK1 (FIG-REF). Another functional difference between Skp1 and SKP1/ASK1 was shown by control two‐hybrid assays. These failed to reveal interactions between SKP1/ASK1 and yeast Snf1, as well as between yeast Skp1 and Snf1 (data not shown). By analogy, one of the 19 Arabidopsis SKP1/ASK homologues (FIG-REF; At5), SKP1_5/ASK5, which carried a unique insertion of five amino acids (SDLLQ) in the C‐terminal F‐box‐binding domain, displayed no interaction with AKIN10 and AKIN11, indicating that not all Arabidopsis SKP1 homologues shared the SnRK‐binding property of SKP1/ASK1. [[FIGURE]] The SKP1/ASK1‐binding regions of SnRKs were mapped by two‐hybrid interaction assays with a GAD–ASK1 prey using a series of baits encoding different segments of AKIN10 and AKIN11 (FIG-REF). GAD–ASK1 interacted with homologous C‐terminal SnRK peptides, which were located downstream of the UBA (Hofmann and Bucher, 1996) and yeast Snf4‐binding regions (Bhalerao et al., 1999), between amino acid positions 349 and 512 in AKIN10, and 399 and 512 in AKIN11. These SKP1/ASK1‐binding domains of AKIN10 and AKIN11 were previously observed to interact with the SnRK β and γ subunits (Kleinow et al., 2000; A.Ferrando, unpublished) and kinase inhibitor PRL1 WD‐protein (Bhalerao et al., 1999). The mapping data therefore suggested that occupation of the common SnRK‐binding sites by either of these factors would exclude binding of another factor to the same regions in AKIN10 and AKIN11. [[FIGURE]] To test this hypothesis, a competitive AKIN10 kinase‐binding assay was performed with SKP1/ASK1 and PRL1 (FIG-REF). [35S]methionine‐labelled AKIN10 was bound to GST–ASK1, then the complex was challenged with increasing amounts of PRL1 in fusion with a maltose‐binding protein (MBP–PRL1). Titration of [35S]AKIN10, using a selective pull‐down of GST–ASK1 with GS and MBP–PRL1 with amylose resin, showed that increasing the amount of competitor MBP–PRL1 protein resulted in concomitant loss of AKIN10 from the GST–ASK1‐bound fraction and accumulation of AKIN10 in MBP–PRL1‐bound form. These data indicated that PRL1 could recruit AKIN10 by disrupting its interaction with SKP1/ASK1. Protein kinase assays performed under similar conditions showed that saturation of GST–AKIN10 with increasing amounts of GST–ASK1, as well as with control MBP and GST proteins, did not alter the AKIN10 kinase activity. By contrast, MBP–PRL1 efficiently inhibited the GST–AKIN10 kinase (FIG-REF). These assays also revealed that neither SKP1/ASK1 nor PRL1 served as substrate for the AKIN10 kinase. Competition of a preformed GST–AKIN10/GST–ASK1 complex with increasing amounts of MBP–PRL1 resulted in a gradual inhibition of the kinase activity, reflecting a recruitment of AKIN10 by PRL1. As PRL1 was also found to inhibit AKIN11 (Bhalerao et al., 1999), these results suggested that the SnRK inhibitor PRL1 WD‐protein and SKP1/ASK1 may not occur in common SnRK complexes. To support this conclusion, proteins extracted from cultured Arabidopsis cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody (α‐ASK1) raised against a peptide carrying the last 21 C‐terminal amino acids of SKP1/ASK1 (FIG-REF). Western blotting of immunoprecipitated proteins with an α‐SnRK antibody, recognizing both AKIN10 and AKIN11, showed that SKP1/ASK1 co‐immunoprecipitated with a protein kinase that specifically phosphorylated the SnRK substrate peptide TRX‐KD derived from sucrose‐phosphate synthase (Bhalerao et al., 1999). By contrast, proteins immunoprecipitated with the α‐ASK1 antibody did not cross‐react with the anti‐PRL1 antibody (α‐PRL1; FIG-REF). These data were consistent with control experiments showing that the α‐PRL1 antibody (Németh et al., 1998) immunoprecipitated an active SnRK, but not SKP1/ASK1, from the same cell extracts (data not shown). The α4/PAD1‐binding SnRK domains were mapped as described above by assaying two‐hybrid interactions of a GAD–PAD1 prey with GBD baits encoding different segments of AKIN10 and AKIN11 (FIG-REF). Similarly to SKP1/ASK1, GAD–PAD1 was found to interact with the PRL1‐binding regions of SnRKs. To determine how saturation of the SnRK‐binding site with SKP1/ASK1 affects subsequent binding of α4/PAD1, a kinase competition assay was performed. [35S]methionine‐labelled AKIN10 was saturated by incubation with an excess of GST–ASK1. The preformed [35S]AKIN10–GST–ASK1 complex was then challenged with increasing amounts of His‐α4/PAD1 protein, which carried an N‐terminal His6 tag. The amount of [35S]AKIN10 in complex with GST–ASK1 was measured by pull‐down assays with GS, whereas the amount of His‐α4/PAD1 in the GST‐bound fractions was monitored by immunoblotting with an α‐His antibody (FIG-REF). A gradual increase in the amount of both [35S]AKIN10 and His‐α4/PAD1 proteins in the GST–ASK1‐bound fractions indicated that the α4/PAD1 protein, unlike PRL1, did not compete with SKP1/ASK1 for binding of the AKIN10 kinase. Rather, increasing the amount of α4/PAD1 proportionally increased the quantity of GST–ASK1‐bound AKIN10 kinase. The His‐α4/PAD1 protein could thus either recruit some residual free form of [35S]AKIN10 after saturation with GST–ASK1 or, more likely, increase the efficiency of kinase binding by forming a complex with GST–ASK1. To demonstrate the selectivity of α4/PAD1 interactions, protein extract prepared from cultured Arabidopsis cells was subjected to chromatography on Ni‐NTA–agarose carrying immobilized His‐α4/PAD1 protein. Whereas no specific protein binding was observed to the control empty Ni‐NTA matrix, both SnRK and SKP1/ASK1 proteins were detected in the His‐α4/PAD1‐bound protein fraction by immunoblotting with α‐SnRK and α‐ASK1 antibodies (FIG-REF). As observed for PRL1 and SKP1/ASK1, protein kinase assays with GST–AKIN10 and GST–AKIN11 indicated that α4/PAD1 was not a substrate for Arabidopsis SnRKs (data not shown). Consequently, α4/PAD1 appeared to be a proteasomal SnRK‐binding protein. To test this possibility, proteasome was purified in the presence of ATP from cultured Arabidopsis cells by Q‐Sepharose chromatography. The proteasomes were resolved to 26S and 20S fractions on a non‐denaturing polyacrylamide gel stained by the fluorescent peptidase substrate SUC‐LLVY‐AMC (Umeda et al., 1997a; Glickman et al., 1998). The excised 26S proteasomal bands yielded a highly purified protein fraction in which a monoclonal anti‐20S proteasome antibody (α‐20S) detected the conserved core subunits α2 and α5 (both ∼26 kDa), α1, α3 and α7 (each ∼27 kDa), and α6 (30 kDa), in addition to cross‐reacting with two larger subunits (FIG-REF). Western blotting with α‐SnRK antibody revealed the presence of an SnRK with an expected molecular mass (58 kDa) in the 26S proteasomal fraction, clearly indicating that SnRK was not ubiquitylated as a potential proteasomal substrate. Together with the protein interaction data, this suggested that specific binding of SnRK by the α4/PAD1 proteasome subunit could mediate a recruitment of SKP1/ASK1 in potential association with other SCF ubiquitin ligase subunits. Cellular localization studies lent further support to the protein interaction data suggesting a proteasomal association of SCF ubiquitin ligase subunits. The immunofluorescence staining patterns of antibodies, which detected the proteasomal α‐subunits and SCF subunits SKP1/ASK1 and cullin AtCUL1 (Gray et al., 1999), perfectly overlapped with each other and corresponded to the patterns of 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI)‐stained nuclei in different Arabidopsis tissues (FIG-REF). The antibodies did not stain the nucleoli, but labelled nuclear particles of ∼150 nm and a few larger speckles of ∼300 nm. Weak cytoplasmic staining was detected only in cells of meristems in which strong labelling of nuclei disappeared in late prophase of mitosis. In metaphase, the staining patterns with all three antibodies overlapped with the positions of mitotic spindles visualized by an anti‐tubulin antibody, but not with the positions of DAPI‐stained chromosomes (FIG-REF). This staining pattern was abolished by oryzalin treatment of tissues, which disrupted the mitotic spindles. In roots and shoot apices, and other vegetative and reproductive organs, the staining patterns did not overlap with peripheral and perinuclear networks of actin and tubulin (data not shown). In early anaphase, the signals were still visible on the poles of mitotic spindles, but also between the unstained moving chromosome groups. In late anaphase and telophase, the signals detected by the antibodies became equatorial and overlapped with the phragmoplasts, but not with the newly forming cytoplasmic plates (FIG-REF and FIG-REF). Staining of daughter nuclei was first observed when the chromatids were decondensed and surrounded by newly formed nuclear membranes. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Although these data demonstrated a perfect cellular co‐localization of SCF and 20S proteasomal epitopes, the co‐localization of proteasome with the SCF subunit SKP1/ASK1 remained to be rigorously proven. This was necessary because the anti‐SKP1/ASK1 antibody was raised against a peptide that shared at least 13 of 21 amino acids with all 19 members of the Arabidopsis SKP1/ASK family (FIG-REF). For specific detection, the SKP1/ASK1 coding region was fused to an intron‐tagged haemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence. Subsequently, SKP1/ASK1 labelled with a C‐terminal HA tag (ASK1‐HA) was expressed under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV 35S) in cultured Arabidopsis cells by Agrobacterium‐mediated transformation (Ferrando et al., 2000). Double immunostaining of transformed cells with anti‐ASK1 and anti‐HA antibodies resulted in identical staining patterns of nuclei, phragmoplasts and mitotic spindles (FIG-REF), confirming the previous cellular localization data obtained with the α‐ASK1 antibody. [[FIGURE]] To confirm that SKP1/ASK1 was indeed associated with cullin in an SCF complex, protein extract was prepared from the ASK1‐HA‐expressing cell line and loaded onto a matrix carrying immobilized anti‐HA IgG. As a control, protein extract derived from a cell line expressing an HA‐tagged β‐glucuronidase (HA‐GUS) enzyme was immunoprecipitated under identical conditions. Following specific elution of matrix‐bound proteins with HA‐peptide, western blotting with α‐AtCUL1 and α‐SnRK antibodies showed that ASK1‐HA, but not the control HA‐GUS protein, co‐immunoprecipitated with cullin and an SnRK (FIG-REF). To detect proteasomal association of the SCF subunits, proteasome was purified in the presence of ATP from the ASK1‐HA‐expressing cell line using DEAE‐Affi‐Gel blue Sepharose chromatography followed by Sephacryl S‐400 gel filtration (see Materials and methods). Fractions cross‐reacting with the α‐HA, α‐AtCUL1 and α‐20S proteasome antibodies were subjected to immunoaffinity purification on immobilized anti‐HA IgG using specific elution with HA‐peptide. Western blotting of purified proteins with α‐20S proteasome and α‐HA antibodies showed that ASK1‐HA co‐purified with proteasome α‐subunits (FIG-REF). In comparison, however, only a low amount of SnRK was recovered in association with ASK1‐HA (as was noted earlier; FIG-REF and data not shown). To test whether SnRK was lost during immunoaffinity binding to the anti‐HA IgG matrix, equal aliquots of protein fractions detected by the α‐20S proteasome antibody were immunoprecipitated separately with α‐AtCUL1, α‐SnRK and α‐HA antibodies. Western blotting of immunoprecipitated proteins showed that affinity binding to anti‐HA IgG in fact resulted in a selective loss of SnRK from an immunocomplex with ASK1‐HA and cullin (FIG-REF). Similarly, immunoprecipitation with the α‐SnRK antibody reduced the recovery of cullin, indicating that IgG binding of certain subunits disrupted the SCF complex. By contrast, similar amounts of SnRK, cullin and SKP1/ASK1 were immunoprecipitated by the α‐AtCUL1 antibody, showing that SnRK was a stoichiometric component of an SCF complex that co‐purified with α‐subunits of 20S proteasome and carried SKP1/ASK1 and AtCUL1 subunits.
!~MM~! Construction of GBD–AKIN10 and GBD–AKIN11 baits in pAS2, preparation of a pACT2 cDNA library using mRNA from Arabidopsis cell suspension, and detection of GBD fusion protein in the yeast two‐hybrid host Y190 by western blotting with anti‐Gal4p‐DB (Clontech) and α‐SnRK (α‐NPK5; Muranaka et al., 1994) antibodies were described previously (Németh et al., 1998; Bhalerao et al., 1999). Following selection of transformants on SD medium (lacking leucine, histidine and tryptophan, but containing 50 mM 3‐AT), yeast colonies were grown on nitrocellulose filters on SD plates with 25 mM 3‐AT to perform LacZ filter lift assays as described (Durfee et al., 1993; Ausubel et al., 1999). The pACT2 clones, encoding putative AKIN‐interacting factors, were isolated and transformed into yeast strains Y187 and Y190 (Durfee et al., 1993) that either carried no bait, or harboured GBD–AKIN10, GBD–AKIN11, pAS2‐lamin (Matchmaker System; Clontech), and other control baits described previously (Németh et al., 1998). The cDNAs were sequenced using an automatic ABI377 sequencer and pAS2‐specific oligonucleotide primers. To map the SKP1/ASK1 and α4/PAD1 binding domains of SnRKs, GBD baits carrying PCR‐amplified segments of AKIN10 and AKIN11 cDNAs were constructed. Amino acid positions of AKIN10 and AKIN11 sequences expressed by these baits are shown in FIG-REF. Interactions of AKIN10 and AKIN11 baits with a GAD–ASK1 prey were tested by LacZ filter assays. Similar assays were performed with a GAD–PAD1 prey, which carried a full‐length cDNA from pTAS‐g64 (Genschik et al., 1992). The SKP1/ASK1 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI–BglII fragment from pACT2 in pAS2 to construct a GBD–ASK1 bait, which was used in a two‐hybrid screen to identify SKIPs. The pACT2‐SKIP cDNA clones were transformed into yeast strains to test their interaction with GBD–ASK1, GBD–AKIN10, GBD–AKIN11 and GBD–lamin baits. The longest sequence from each class of SKIP cDNAs is displayed by the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession Nos: SKIP1, AF263377; SKIP2, AF263378; SKIP3, AF263379; SKIP4, AF263380; SKIP5, AF263382; SKIP6, AF263381; and SKIP7, AF263383. Glucose regulation of protein interactions between GBD–ASK1 and each GAD–SKIP prey, as well as between GBD–AKIN10 and GBD–AKIN11 baits and GAD–ASK1, was assayed by measuring β‐galactosidase enzyme levels in six independent transformants grown in SC medium with either 2% glucose, or 0.05% glucose and 2% each of galactose, glycerol and ethanol, as described (Jiang and Carlson, 1996, 1997; Table I). The SKP1/ASK1 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI–BglII fragment in pGEX‐3X‐2 (Pharmacia) to purify a GST–ASK1 fusion protein (Ausubel et al., 1999). DNA templates for in vitro transcription–translation (Promega TNT) were generated by PCR amplification of AKIN10 and AKIN11 coding domains using a 5′ primer with a T7 promoter sequence (5′‐AATACGACTCACTATACGGAGACCACATGGGAGGCCCGGGATCCGAAT‐3′), and a 3′ primer (5′‐ATGCACAGTTGAAGTGAACTT‐3′). GST–ASK1 and control GST proteins (10 μg of each) were immobilized on GS beads (Pharmacia) in binding buffer R [20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL] for 30 min at 4°C. Equal aliquots of GST matrices and GS beads washed with binding buffer were incubated with [35S]methionine‐labelled AKIN10 and AKIN11 for 60 min at 4°C. Following the removal of unbound proteins and washing the beads, the matrix‐bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated together with the unbound protein fractions on SDS–polyacrylamide gels, and detected by autoradiography. In kinase competition assays (FIG-REF and FIG-REF), samples of [35S]AKIN10 were bound to GST–ASK1 (5 μg) in binding buffer for 30 min and incubated with increasing amounts of MBP–PRL1 protein (0.5, 1, 2 or 5 μg) for 30 min at 24°C. Half of each sample was bound to GS, whereas the other half was bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for 60 min at 4°C. After washing with binding buffer, the matrix‐bound proteins were eluted, separated and detected as described above. In protein kinase assays, GST–AKIN10 (5 μg) was incubated either alone or with 5 μg of either GST, MBP or MBP–PRL1 in kinase buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)] for 30 min at 25°C before initiating the kinase reaction by addition of 5 μCi of [γ‐32P]ATP and 1 μg of SnRK substrate TRX‐KD (Bhalerao et al., 1999). To test the effect of SKP1/ASK1 binding on the activity of SnRKs, increasing amounts of GST–ASK1 (0.5, 1, 2 and 5 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of GST–AKIN10. In competition assays, 1 μg of GST–AKIN10 was saturated with 5 μg of GST–ASK1, then incubated with 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 μg of MBP–PRL1 for 30 min at 25°C before performing the kinase reactions for 1 h at 25°C. The phosphorylated TRX‐KD peptide was bound to Ni‐NTA–agarose (Qiagen), washed, eluted, separated by SDS–PAGE, stained, and detected by autoradiography as described (Bhalerao et al., 1999). For in vitro transcription–translation, the α4/PAD1 coding region was PCR amplified using a T7 promoter primer (see above). GST–ASK1, GST–AKIN10, GST–AKIN11 and control GST proteins (10 μg of each) were bound to GS for 30 min at 4°C in binding buffer T (25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1 g/l milk powder) and incubated with [35S]α4/PAD1 for 60 min at 4°C. The supernatant and eluted matrix‐bound [35S]α4/PAD1 fractions were separated by SDS–PAGE and detected as described above. To purify α4/PAD1 in fusion with an N‐terminal His6 tag, the coding domain was PCR amplified and cloned in pRSETb (Invitrogen) to obtain pHis‐α4/PAD1 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) LysS. Cells grown at 28°C to an OD660 of 0.6 were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl‐β‐d‐thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2 h, harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and passed through a French press to prepare a crude lysate. A cleared lysate obtained by centrifugation (12 000 g for 45 min at 4°C) was purified on a DEAE Fast Flow Sepharose column XK/16X40 using a linear gradient of 0–1 M NaCl in lysis buffer. The His‐α4/PAD1 fractions were pooled, dialysed in buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and loaded on a Ni‐NTA–agarose (Bio‐Rad) column. After washing with binding buffer and elution with buffer L (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole), His‐α4/PAD1 was obtained in apparently homogeneous form. In protein binding assays (FIG-REF), 2 μg of GST–ASK1 were first incubated in binding buffer R (see above) with [35S]AKIN10 for 30 min at 20°C, then with increasing amounts of His‐α4/PAD1 (1, 2 or 5 μg) for 30 min, and bound to GS matrix for 60 min at 4°C. Proteins were eluted from the washed GST beads with SDS sample buffer and separated on two identical SDS–polyacrylamide gels. The first gel was subjected to autoradiography to detect the GST–ASK1‐bound [35S]AKIN10 protein, whereas the second gel was immunoblotted with a monoclonal anti‐RGSHis6 antibody (Boehringer‐Roche) to detect His‐α4/PAD1 in association with GST–ASK1. To determine whether α4/PAD1 can recruit SKP1/ASK1 and SnRK from a plant protein extract, 5 μg of His‐α4/PAD1 were immobilized on Ni‐NTA–agarose for 1 h at 4°C in extraction buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM β‐mercaptoethanol, 20 μl/ml Sigma plant protease inhibitor mix]. Protein extract (6 mg) from cultured Arabidopsis Col‐0 cells was prepared in extraction buffer, cleared by centrifugation (20 000 g for 30 min and 50 000 g for 45 min), supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and 150 mM NaCl, precleared with Ni‐NTA–agarose for 2 h, and incubated with His‐α4/PAD1‐Ni‐NTA resin for 4 h at 4°C. The resin was washed with extraction buffer containing 10 mM imidazole and 250 mM NaCl, then the matrix‐bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to western blotting with α‐ASK1 and α‐SnRK antibodies (FIG-REF). The SKP1/ASK1 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI–BglII fragment in a yeast gene expression cassette that carried a methionine‐repressible Met25 promoter in plasmid p426Met25 (Mumberg et al., 1994). Budding yeast strains (Connelly and Hieter, 1996) YPH1161 [Mata, ura3‐52, lys2‐801, ade2‐101, trp1Δ63, his3‐Δ200, leu2‐Δ1, skp1Δ1::TRP1, skp1‐4:: LEU2 CFIII(CEN3.LYPH983), HIS3, SUP1] and YPH1172 (as YPH1161, but skp1‐3::LEU2) were transformed with p426Met25 carrying the SKP1/ASK1 cDNA and assayed on ura− SC medium (Bhalerao et al., 1999) for suppression of the thermosensitive skp1‐3 and skp1‐4 mutations at 25 and 37°C in the absence or presence of 1 mM methionine inhibiting the Met25 promoter. The SKP1/ASK1 cDNA was cloned in pPILY and expressed by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in Agrobacterium‐transformed Arabidopsis cells as described (Ferrando et al., 2000). A polyclonal rabbit antibody (α‐ASK1) raised against a C‐terminal SKP1/ASK1‐peptide, CKNDFTPEEEEEVRRE, was affinity purified using Affi‐Prep10 (Harlow and Lane, 1988). For immunoprecipitation, 30 mg of protein extract from Arabidopsis Col‐0 cells were precleared with protein A–Sepharose (Bhalerao et al., 1999) and bound to 350 μg of α‐ASK1 IgG immobilized on protein A–Sepharose with dimethylpimelimidate (Harlow and Lane, 1988). The IgG‐bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of ASK1 peptide [0.5 mg/ml in TBSG buffer: 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 10% (v/v) glycerol], concentrated with AMICON YM10, separated by SDS–PAGE, and subjected to either immunoblotting with α‐ASK1, α‐PRL1 (Németh et al., 1998) and α‐SnRK antibodies, or used in SnRK protein kinase assays. For immunoprecipitation of ASK1‐HA protein complexes, 30 mg of protein extract from an ASK1‐HA‐expressing cell line were precleared with protein G–Sepharose (Sigma), and loaded in repeated cycles on a column containing anti‐HA.11 IgG–beads (Babco) at 4°C for 12 h using a peristaltic pump. The column was washed with buffer A [TBS buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL], buffer B [20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL] and buffer A again. Proteins were eluted from the anti‐HA.11 IgG with HA‐peptide (Genosys; 0.5 mg/ml, in TBSG buffer); resolved by SDS–PAGE, immunoblotted separately with α‐SnRK, α‐AtCUL1 (Gray et al., 1999), α‐20S proteasome [mAB(MCP231); Affinity Research], and peroxidase‐conjugated anti‐HA (Boehringer) antibodies, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham‐Pharmacia) detection. Seed sterilization, in vitro culture and growth conditions for Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and plants, as well as establishment, maintenance and transformation of cell suspensions, were described previously (Mathur et al., 1998; Németh et al., 1998; Ferrando et al., 2000). For sampling of roots, seeds were sown on a nylon mesh placed on MS agar medium (Gibco‐BRL) containing 0.5% sucrose, and germinated in horizontal position. Samples from cultured cells, 6‐day‐old seedlings, and different organs of 5‐week‐old soil‐grown plants were fixed, embedded, sectioned and treated with antibodies as described previously (Vitha et al., 1997; Ferrando et al., 2000). The following antibodies were used: affinity‐purified rabbit polyclonal α‐ASK1 (Ferrando et al., 2000; dilution 1:300); rabbit polyclonal α‐AtCUL1 (Gray et al., 1999; 1:1000); mouse monoclonal anti‐human 20S proteasome [Affinity Research; mAB (MCP231); 1:600]; and mouse monoclonal anti‐HA IgG (Babco; 1:500). After incubation with primary antibodies, the sections were washed with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween‐20, and treated for 1 h at 20°C with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐conjugated goat anti‐rabbit IgG (Sigma; 1:150), to visualize the SKP1/ASK1 and AtCUL1 epitopes, or FITC‐conjugated goat anti‐mouse IgG (Sigma; 1:150), to detect the 20S proteasome α‐subunits. In double‐staining experiments, the rabbit α‐ASK1 antibody was used in combination with either mouse α‐20S proteasome, or mouse anti‐actin (clone C4; ICN Biomedicals; 1:150), or mouse anti‐α‐tubulin (clone DM1A; Sigma; 1:150) antibodies. The sections were stained with FITC‐conjugated goat anti‐mouse IgG in combination with a Cy™3‐conjugated anti‐rabbit IgG (H+L; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500). Arabidopsis cells expressing ASK1‐HA were similarly treated with rabbit α‐ASK1 and mouse α‐HA IgGs, then with FITC‐conjugated goat anti‐mouse and Cy™3‐conjugated anti‐rabbit IgGs. In control experiments, the primary antibodies were either omitted or replaced by rabbit serum. In competition experiments, the α‐ASK1 and α‐HA antibodies were blocked with purified GST–ASK1 protein and HA peptide, respectively. All secondary antibodies were tested for cross‐reaction. For microscopy, the sections were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween‐20 and mounted with p‐phenylenediamine‐glycerol antifade solution. Fluorescence images were examined using Leica Aristoplan and DMRB microscopes with FITC, rhodamine (Cy™3), DAPI and combined BGR filters, and recorded with a Hitachi HV‐20 camera. Proteasome was purified from Arabidopsis Col‐0 cell suspension using a modification of the procedure described by Umeda et al. (1997b). A crude lysate was prepared by homogenization of cells with liquid nitrogen in buffer H (25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mM creatinine phosphate, 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase). A cleared lysate (50 mg/ml protein) obtained by differential centrifugation (20 000 g for 30 min and 50 000 g for 45 min at 4°C) was fractionated on a Q‐Sepharose column using a linear gradient of 0–1 M NaCl. The column fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on a non‐denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was stained for 15 min using an overlay of 0.1 mM Suc‐LLVY‐AMIC (Bachem) fluorescent peptidase substrate in buffer H to detect the 26S and 20S proteasomal bands by UV (360 nM) illumination (Glickman et al., 1998). Gel sections containing 26S proteasomes were excised, resuspended in buffer I [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol], and homogenized to obtain a cleared protein sample, which was resolved by 12% SDS–PAGE for silver staining (Roth) and western blotting with α‐20S proteasome and α‐SnRK antibodies (FIG-REF). Proteasomes were similarly prepared from the ASK1‐HA‐expressing Arabidopsis cell line, with the exception that the cleared lysate (2 g of protein) was fractionated on a DEAE‐Affi‐Gel blue Sepharose column (Bio‐Rad) using a linear gradient of 0–500 mM NaCl in buffer E [25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol]. Fractions containing ASK1‐HA were detected by western blotting with anti‐HA IgG, combined, simultaneously desalted and concentrated in a Vivaspin 20 concentrator (10 kDa cut‐off; Sartorius), and further fractionated on a Sephacryl S‐400 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer E containing 100 mM NaCl. Fractions detected by α‐20S proteasome, α‐HA, α‐AtCUL1 and α‐SnRK antibodies were further purified on anti‐HA.11 IgG. A 20S proteasome–SCF fraction (15 mg of protein) was precleared with protein G–Sepharose for 4 h, then incubated with anti‐HA.11 IgG matrix for 12 h at 4°C. The resin was placed in a column, washed with buffer E containing 150 mM NaCl, and then the ASK1‐HA‐associated proteins were eluted from the α‐HA.11 IgG matrix with HA‐peptide (0.5 mg/ml in TBSG buffer) and subjected to western blotting with α‐20S proteasome and α‐HA antibodies (FIG-REF). Alternatively, the Sephacryl S‐400‐purified 20S proteasome–SCF fraction (5 mg of protein) was precleared and subjected to immunoprecipitation separately with anti‐HA.11, α‐AtCUL1, and α‐SnRK antibodies for 4 h at 4°C. The immunocomplex obtained with anti‐HA.11 IgG was bound to protein G–Sepharose, whereas immunocomplexes formed with the α‐AtCUL1 and α‐SnRK antibodies were bound to protein A–Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. The matrices were washed with buffer E containing 150 mM NaCl. The matrix‐bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer and divided into three equal aliquots, which were resolved by SDS–PAGE and subjected to western blotting separately with α‐HA, α‐SnRK and α‐AtCUL1 antibodies followed by ECL detection (FIG-REF).
