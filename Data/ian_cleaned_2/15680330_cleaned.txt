!~ABS~! Brassinosteroids (BRs) signal through a plasma membrane-localized receptor kinase to regulate plant growth and development. We showed previously that a novel protein, BES1, accumulates in the nucleus in response to BRs, where it plays a role in BR-regulated gene expression; however, the mechanism by which BES1 regulates gene expression is unknown. In this study, we dissect BES1 subdomains and establish that BES1 is a transcription factor that binds to and activates BR target gene promoters both in vitro and in vivo. BES1 interacts with a basic helix-loop-helix protein, BIM1, to synergistically bind to E box (CANNTG) sequences present in many BR-induced promoters. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants of BIM1 and its close family members display BR response phenotypes. Thus, BES1 defines a new class of plant-specific transcription factors that cooperate with transcription factors such as BIM1 to regulate BR-induced genes.
!~RES~! In the Arabidopsis genome, four proteins, designated BEH1–4 (BES1/BZR1 homolog 1–4, At3g50750, At4g36780, At4g18890, and At1g78700, respectively), show high sequence identity with BES1 and BZR1. BES1 shares 88%, 59%, 56%, 45%, and 48% identity to BZR1 and BEH1–4, respectively. To investigate if these proteins are involved in BR signaling, the BEH1, 2, 3, and 4 proteins were tagged with green fluorescence protein (GFP) at their carboxyl termini and expressed in plants. As shown in CITATION , BES1 and BEH1–4 exist in plants in at least two forms, likely phosphorylated and dephophorylated forms, and accumulate as dephosphorylated forms when treated with BL, as shown previously for both BES1 and BZR1 CITATION. Mutation of a proline to leucine in the PEST motif of BES1 or BZR1 leads to the accumulation of these proteins and constitutive BR response phenotypes CITATION. BEH2 contains this conserved proline, and a mutant form with an analogous mutation accumulated to a high level even without BL treatment CITATION. Plants that express BEH2m displayed a bes1-D phenotype (data not shown). These results suggest that BES1 functions with BZR1 and BEH1–4 in BR signaling. Consistently, a BES1 T-DNA knockout line did not show any obvious phenotype (our unpublished data). To investigate the loss-of-function phenotype of the gene family, we transformed plants with a BES1 RNAi (RNA interference) construct that includes the whole BES1 coding region. Approximately 25% of the transgenic lines displayed a semidwarf phenotype similar to weak BR loss-of-function mutants CITATION. In the PCR condition we used, both BES1 and BZR1 transcripts were reduced in RNAi plants, while the transcripts of BEH1 and BEH4 did not appear to be affected CITATION, consistent with the fact that BES1 and BZR1 are more closely related to each other than to other family members. BEH2 and BEH3 transcripts were not detected in the seedling tissues used for this experiment (data not shown). BES1 protein levels were also reduced in RNAi plants, and the extent of BES1 reduction correlated well with the phenotypes CITATION. These results indicate that reduction of BES1 and BZR1 leads to a semidwarf phenotype. Together with the observation that dominant mutations in BES1 and BZR1 result in distinct phenotypes in light-grown plants, we conclude that BES1 and BZR1, and perhaps other family members, have partially redundant functions in BR signaling. BES1 protein contains a putative NLS, followed by a highly conserved amino-terminal domain (N) shared among BES1 and family members, a BIN2 phosphorylation domain (P), a PEST motif, and a carboxyl-terminal domain (C) CITATION CITATION . A mutation in the PEST motif stabilizes the protein in bes1-D mutants, suggesting that the PEST motif is involved in BES1 degradation CITATION. To determine the functions of the other domains of BES1, we generated deletion mutants for each of the N, C, and P domains in either wild-type BES1 or bes1-D (PEST mutation) gene backgrounds CITATION and transformed the constructs into wild-type plants. Transgenic lines with roughly similar expression levels of the transgenes were chosen for further analysis (CITATION, lower panel). The accumulation of truncated proteins was analyzed by Western blotting. As reported previously, both wild-type BES1 and BES1-D are present in plants as phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms and accumulate as the dephosphorylated form in the presence of BL, although mutant BES1-D protein accumulates to much higher levels than wild-type BES1 CITATION (CITATION, lanes 1–4; upper panel shows long exposure, and middle panel shows shorter exposure). Deletion of the N, C, or P domains leads to BL-independent accumulation of truncated proteins in transgenic plants (CITATION, upper and middle panels, lanes 5–16), suggesting that these domains are all required for efficient BES1 turnover. To determine the function of these domains in BR signaling, the phenotypes of the transgenic plants in the light CITATION or dark CITATION were analyzed in the absence and presence of BRZ, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor that reduces endogenous BR levels CITATION. While transgenic plants that express wild-type BES1 displayed a wild-type phenotype and were sensitive to BRZ, plants that express BES1-D displayed a long hypocotyl and curly leaf phenotype and were resistant to BRZ when grown in either dark or light conditions CITATION, as previously reported CITATION. Expression of deletions of the N domain (BES1ΔN and BES1-DΔN) resulted in wild-type-like plants with somewhat longer hypocotyls and leaf petioles that were sensitive to BRZ CITATION, suggesting that the BES1-N domain is required for full BES1 activity. BES1ΔC and BES1-DΔC plants were smaller than wild-type and were more sensitive to BRZ in the light CITATION. The results suggest that the C domain is required for BES1 function and that truncated BES1 proteins lacking the C terminus function as dominant-negative forms. In contrast, expression of proteins that deleted BIN2 phosphorylation sites (P) (BES1ΔP and BES1-DΔP) produced plants with typical bes1-D mutant phenotypes that were resistant to BRZ in both light and dark growth conditions CITATION, indicating that the P domain is involved in BES1 turnover. We conclude that, while the N, C, and BIN2 phosphorylation (P) domains are all required for BES1 turnover, the N- and C-terminal domains are both necessary and largely sufficient for BES1 function in promoting cell elongation. To understand how each of the N, P and C domains are involved in BR signaling, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens with each domain and identified several BES1-interacting proteins. The characterization of BIM1 (BES1-interacting Myc-like 1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that was identified using BES1-C domain as bait, is reported here. From approximately 10 million yeast clones screened, 11 clones contained cDNA fragments from the Arabidopsis gene At5g08130, here designated BIM1. There are two homologs of BIM1 predicted in the Arabidopsis genome, named BIM2 (At1g69010) and BIM3 (At5g38860). BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3 are also named Arabidopsis bHLH proteins EN 126, 125, and 127, respectively CITATION. The protein sequence alignment of BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3 is shown in CITATION , and the protein structures are shown in CITATION. These proteins are predicted to have highly conserved DNA binding domains (CITATION, underlined) that are 76%, 69%, and 77% similar between BIM1/BIM2, BIM2/BIM3, and BIM1/BIM3, respectively. The predicted BIM1 bHLH domain shares 25% similarity with the bHLH domain of the Myc transcription factor CITATION. The C-terminal portions of these proteins have a stretch of 40 conserved amino acid residues (CITATION, denoted between two asterisks) that are 39%–51% similar between BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3. This domain does not have high similarity to any known proteins. BIM1 also has a predicted amino-terminal domain (about 200 amino acid residues) that is absent in BIM2 and BIM3. All the clones obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen using BES1-C domain as bait contained the carboxyl portion of BIM1, indicating that these two proteins can interact with each other in yeast through their C-terminal domains. To confirm that BIM1 and its homologs interact with BES1, we performed a GST pull-down experiment with purified proteins expressed in E. coli. As shown in CITATION, both BIM1 and BIM3 interacted with full-length BES1 or BES1-D. In addition, BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3 all interacted with truncated forms of BES1 that correspond to the N-terminal part of the protein (CITATION, indicated by lower arrow). Indeed, the N terminus of BES1 (including NLS and the N domain) interacted with BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3 (data not shown). We further found that the bHLH domain of BIM1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of BES1 CITATION. The fact that BIM1 interacted much more strongly with full-length BES1 than with the N-terminal part of BES1 in vitro indicated that the C-terminal part of BES1 is also involved in interaction with BIM1 in vitro CITATION, which is consistent with the fact these two proteins interact in yeast through their C-terminal domains. In conclusion, we found that BES1 interacts with BIM1 through two different domains: the N-terminal BES1 and bHLH domain of BIM1 as well as the C-terminal domains of BES1 and BIM1. To determine the functions of BIM1 and closely related genes in BR signaling, we generated both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants. T-DNA insertion mutants for BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3 were identified CITATION. bim1, bim2, and bim3 appeared to be null mutants since corresponding mRNA could not be detected in the mutants (see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/120/2/249/DC1/). While none of the single mutants displayed any visible phenotype, the bim1 bim2 bim3 triple mutant seedlings had shorter hypocotyls compared to wild-type controls in both light- and dark-grown seedlings CITATION . In addition, the bim1 bim2 bim3 mutant was about two times more sensitive to BRZ than wild-type seedlings in a hypocotyl elongation assay in the dark CITATION, suggesting that BIM1, BIM2, and BIM3 are involved in BR signaling. Although transgenic plants that overexpressed the BIM1 gene did not display obvious phenotypes CITATION, these plants showed reduced sensitivity to BRZ, especially with lower concentrations CITATION. Accordingly, overexpression of BIM1 in a weak bri1 mutant background partially suppressed the bri1 dwarf phenotype, with the double mutant having more expanded leaves and longer leaf petioles compared to bri1 CITATION, further suggesting a positive role for BIM1 in BR signaling. Based on the facts that BES1 and BIM1 interact with each other and that both are involved in BR responses, we hypothesized that BIM1 and BES1 may directly bind to the promoters of BR-induced genes. The promoter of the SAUR-AC1 gene that was previously shown to be induced by BL and upregulated in the bes1-D mutant was chosen to test the hypothesis CITATION. The promoter contains three predicted E box sequences (CANNTG) that are known to be the binding sites for many bHLH transcription factors CITATION. Three DNA fragments (approximately 30 base pairs each) containing each of the E boxes were synthesized, labeled, and used in DNA binding experiments with purified BES1 and BIM1 proteins expressed in E. coli. Similar results were obtained with all three probes, and the results for one of them (Ea) are shown CITATION . Both BES1 and BIM1 can bind to the promoter individually in a protein concentration-dependent manner, perhaps as homodimers (CITATION, lanes 1–6; BES1 and BIM1 are indicated by arrows on the left, see below for details). Interestingly, BES1 and BIM1 together bind to the promoter synergistically (CITATION, lanes 7–9; BES1 + BIM1 bands are indicated by arrows). Since heterodimers usually migrate somewhere between homodimers (for example, see CITATION), the position of the BES1::BIM1::DNA complex is consistent with the notion that BES1 and BIM1 form a heterodimer. The increased complex formation with increased BIM1 protein concentrations (while BES1 was kept constant) supports the idea that the complex contains BIM1 protein (CITATION, lanes 7–9). The BES1::BIM1::DNA complex was supershifted to a higher position (BES1 + BIM1 + Ab, indicated by an arrow) by antibodies, against MBP which was used to tag BES1 (CITATION, lanes 10–12), indicating that the complex contains BES1 as well. To determine if BIM1 or BES1 binds to the E box in the probe, two probes that harbor mutations either in the E box (Ea-M1: CANNTG to TCNNAA) or outside of the E box (Ea-M3) were used in the binding experiments (CITATION, lanes 13–24). BES1 binding was completely abolished in Ea-M1 (CITATION, compare lanes 18 and 14) but not in Ea-M3 (CITATION, compare lanes 22 and 14), suggesting that BES1 binds to the probe through the E box sequence. There are several BIM1 complexes that bound to the Ea probe (CITATION, lanes 4, 5, 6, and 15), and at least one of them (indicated by asterisk) bound to the probe through the E box, since it was reduced in the E box mutant Ea-M1 (CITATION, compare lanes 19 and 15). The upper complex in lanes 4–6, 15, and 19 might represent less-specific binding of BIM1 to other non-E box sequences present in the probe. More importantly, the synergistic binding of BES1 and BIM1 to the probe was completely abolished in the E box mutant Ea-M1 (CITATION, compare lanes 20 and 16) but not in the mutant with a mutation outside of the E box (CITATION, compare lanes 24 and 16). These results suggest that BES1 and BIM1 synergistically bind to the E box sequence, likely as a heterodimer. The BES1 N-terminal domain contains a bipartite NLS followed by a highly conserved motif (N), which together may serve as a DNA binding domain. This BES1 putative DNA binding domain can be aligned with sequences of BES1 homologs, as well as bHLH domains of the BIM1 subfamily and MYC CITATION. BES1 is predicted to contain a highly basic region that is very similar to the basic regions of other bHLH proteins. The Glu-13Arg-16 pair (CITATION, indicated by asterisks) that determines E box binding specificity of bHLH proteins CITATION is conserved in BES1 and BES1 family members. Although the sequence following the BES1 basic region is less conserved, it can form a helix-loop-helix structure as predicted by the Chou-Fasman method CITATION and helical wheel analysis (http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/cmg/Demo/wheel/wheelApp.html) (CITATION and data not shown). In addition, two leucine residues (indicated by asterisks) that are highly conserved in all plant bHLH proteins CITATION are also present in BES1 family members CITATION. Indeed, the BES1 DNA binding domain (NLS plus N) and BIM1's bHLH can bind to the Ea probe synergistically, and such binding was abolished with Ea-M1 as probe (CITATION, lanes 25 and 26). Our results therefore suggest that BES1 is a transcription factor with a unique DNA binding domain that can form a heterodimer with the bHLH domain of BIM1 to bind to the three E box sequences present in the SAUR-AC1 promoter CITATION. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were performed to test if BES1 binds BR target gene promoters in vivo using BES1::GFP and BES1-D::GFP transgenic plants and anti-GFP antibodies CITATION . While no significant amount of SAUR-AC promoter DNA was immunoprecipitated from the wild-type control, a detectable amount of the promoter was pulled down from the BES1::GFP transgenic plants in the presence of BL. Consistent with the fact that BES1-D protein accumulates to high levels in plants, more SAUR-AC1 promoter was found to be associated with BES1-D proteins; this was further stimulated by BL treatment (CITATION, upper panel). Similar results were obtained with a SAUR-AC1-like gene promoter, which is also regulated by BR application CITATION (CITATION, middle panel). At the same time, several other BR-induced promoters tested, including At4g25810 (encoding a XET) and At1g18400 (BEE1) CITATION, appeared not to associate with BES1 or BES1-D in vivo (see Supplemental Figure S2 on the Cell web site). These results support the interpretation that BES1 is a DNA binding transcription factor that is associated with a subset of BR-induced gene promoters in vivo. BIM1::FLAG transgenic plants were used to test if BIM1 was also associated with the BR target gene promoters in vivo. As shown in CITATION, anti-FLAG antibodies pulled down a significant amount of SAUR-AC1 promoter fragment (upper panel) and SAUR-AC1-like promoter (middle panel) from BIM1::FLAG transgenic lines but not from the control plants, indicating that BIM1 is also associated with BR target gene promoters in vivo. Since BES1 is implicated in the activation of BR-induced genes CITATION and both BES1 and BIM1 bind to the SAUR-AC1 promoter, we tested whether BES1 and BIM1 activate transcription in a transient expression assay with SAUR-AC1 and mutant SAUR-AC1 promoter::luciferase reporter constructs. As shown in CITATION, with a wild-type SAUR-AC1 promoter-luciferase reporter, expression of BES1 and especially BES1-D led to increased reporter gene expression (gray bars in groups 1–3), indicating that BES1 protein activates the SAUR-AC1 promoter in vivo. Although BIM1 did not significantly activate the SAUR-AC1 promoter by itself, coexpression of BIM1 and BES1 enhanced BES1-mediated activation of reporter gene expression (CITATION, groups 1 and 2), consistent with the fact that these two proteins bind to the E boxes in the SAUR-AC1 promoter synergistically CITATION. When all three E boxes were mutated in the SAUR-AC1 promoter, BES1- and BIM1-mediated reporter gene activation was largely abolished, and this was especially notable in experiments that involved BES1-D (CITATION, groups 4–6). These results demonstrate that BES1 and BIM1 activate BR target gene expression through the E box sequences present in a BR-induced gene promoter. To determine how BES1 and BIM1 proteins regulate SAUR-AC1 expression in plants, SAUR-AC1 transcript levels were detected in wild-type, a BIM1 overexpression line, and bes1-D mutant plants CITATION. In wild-type plants, SAUR-AC1 was induced 3-fold by BL treatment, consistent with our earlier microarray results CITATION CITATION. Overexpression of BIM1 increased BL induction of SAUR-AC1 gene expression (from 3-fold to 4.5-fold), although the basal SAUR-AC1 expression was not significantly increased CITATION. As reported previously CITATION, accumulation of BES1 (in bes1-D) led to the upregulation of basal SAUR-AC1 gene expression, but the degree of BL induction did not change CITATION. The extent of SAUR-AC1 upregulation correlated with the facts that BIM1 was only slightly overexpressed in the transgenic line used (data not shown) and that BES1 accumulated to very high levels in the bes1-D mutant CITATION. In the bim1 bim2 bim3 triple mutant, the accumulation of SAUR-AC1 mRNA after BL treatment was slightly reduced compared to wild-type (about 25% reduction) and was similar to a weak allele of bri1 (Supplemental Figure S3 and data not shown). Together with the transient expression studies, these results indicate that BES1 and BIM1 directly bind to and regulate SAUR-AC1 gene expression in vivo.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was the wild-type in all the experiments described. Seeds were germinated on 1/2 MS medium (GIBCO-BRL) plus 1% sucrose. Plants were grown either in long day (15 hr light/9 hr dark) or short day (9 hr light/15 hr dark) conditions at 22°C. BEH1–4 and BIM1–3 full-length cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR from Col-0 RNA and cloned into pCHF3-GFP CITATION or pCHF3-3FLAG, and the GFP or FLAG were fused in frame to the C termini of these proteins. For BES1RNAi, a BES1 cDNA containing the whole coding region was amplified and cloned into KpnI/EcoRI and ClaI/XbaI sites of pHANNIBAL CITATION in antisense/sense direction. The DNA fragment containing a CaMV35S promoter:1SEB-intron-BES1 was excised by NotI and cloned into the same site of the binary vector pART27 CITATION. BES1 deletions were generated with pBES1::BES1-GFP or pBES1:BES1-D::GFP CITATION by PCR amplification of different BES1 or BES1-D fragments (NLS, NLS-N, NLS-N-P, P-C, C, N). BES1ΔN/BES1-DΔN, BES1ΔC/BES1-DΔC, or BES1ΔP/BES1-DΔP constructs were obtained by ligations of NLS/P-C, NLS-N-P, or NLS-N/C fragments into the BES1 promoter GFP cassette. For recombinant protein expression, cDNA fragments were cloned into pGEX5X-1 (GST tag, Amersham Pharmacia), pET28a (6xHis tag, Novagen), or pMAL2c (MBP tag, NEB). SAUR-AC1 promoter region was amplified by PCR and cloned into a luciferase expression binary vector CITATION. All three E boxes in the SAUR-AC promoter were mutated by PCR-based mutagenesis. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The details of cloning are available upon request. Agrobacterium tumefaciens (stain GV3101) containing plasmid constructs were used to transform plants by the floral dip method CITATION. Transgenic lines were identified by selection in 1/2 MS medium plus 50 mg/l kanamycin. At least ten transgenic lines were generated for each construct. The expression of transgenes was analyzed by Northern and Western blots with appropriate probes or antibodies for BES1 CITATION, MBP (NEB), GFP (Molecular Probes), and FLAG (Sigma). Phenotypes of representative transgenic lines were analyzed and documented either with an inverted microscope (Leica) or a digital camera. At least 15 seedlings were measured for each genotype for hypocotyl elongation assays and averages, and standard errors were calculated. The Matchmaker System 3 (Clontech) was used to identify interacting proteins of BES1-C domain (amino acid residues 268–335) using an Arabidopsis cDNA library constructed with 3-day-old etiolated seedlings CITATION. T-DNA knockout lines for BIM1 (SALK-85924), BIM2 (SALK-074689), and BIM3 (SALK-79683) were identified from the SIGnAL Arabidopsis T-DNA collection CITATION. The homozygous lines were identified by PCR with primers from T-DNA vector and BIM1–3 genes. The primers used were the following: bim1 (TCGATTCCACGAATTTGGTGACTTCTGCCG; CCATGAAGCTCTGGCTCTTAAGCACAGACC), bim2 (CCGCTTGTGAGAATGTTCAGATTCTTCCTC; AGAAAGAGACCACGTGCATCACGTGACCAC), and bim3 (TGGCTGCTTCACTGAGTTGCATATGATGAG; TCATCTCCTTCAGCAAACAATCAGCCTGG). A particle bombardment instrument (Bio-Rad) was used to deliver plasmids into plant tissues according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each treatment, 2 μg each of a 35S:GUS construct (internal control), SAUR-AC1::LUC or mutant SAUR-AC1::LUC, 35S:BES1-GFP or 35S:BES1-D-GFP CITATION, and BES1::BES1-DΔC and 35S::BIM1–3FLAG plasmids were coated onto gold particles and used to bombard three 1/2 MS plates containing approximately 300 mg of 2-week-old wild-type seedlings. The bombarded tissues were incubated in the dark for 24 hr and used to prepare protein extracts with 500 μl extraction buffer containing 100 mM KPO4 (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 10 mM DTT. The luciferase activities were measured by a luminometer with luciferin and 50 μl extract using an EG&G Berthold Microplate Luminometer LB96V (Wellesley, MA). The GUS activities were measured using 50 μl extract as described CITATION. Reporter gene expression was determined by normalizing the luciferase activities with the GUS activities. The experiments were repeated twice with three duplicates each; representative results are presented. GST pull-down experiments were carried out as described previously CITATION. Protein:DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described CITATION. Briefly, oligonucleotide probes were synthesized, annealed, and labeled with P32-γ-ATP using T4 nucleotide kinase. The binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl binding buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 8.0], 50 mM KCL, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol) with about 0.1 ng probe (20,000 cpm) and indicated amount of proteins purified from E. coli. After 30 min incubation on ice, the reactions were resolved by 5% native polyacrylamide gels with 1× TGE buffer (6.6 g/l Tris, 28.6g/l glycine, 0.78 g/l EDTA [pH 8.7]). Wild-type, BES1-GFP, BES1-D-GFP, or BIM1–3XFLAG transgenic seedlings were used in ChIP experiments mostly as described CITATION. For each experiment, about 5 g of tissues from 2–3-week-old seedlings were used for ChIP with anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies. The ChIP products and input controls were used to detect specific promoters by PCR analyses. The primers used were the following: SAUR-AC1 (GCAGAAAGGAGTCAGTGATG; AAGACAGGACCACATGATTTG) and SAUR-AC-like (TGGCAAGTCTCTGCAACATC; TTGGAGCACCTAAACCAGAC).
