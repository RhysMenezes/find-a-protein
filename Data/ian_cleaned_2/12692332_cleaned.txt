!~ABS~! Characterization of components 17 and 23 of the inner mitochondrial membrane translocase (TIM17:23) from Arabidopsis indicated that there were three genes present for TIM17 andTIM23 and two for TIM44.AtTIM17 differed from the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammalian homologs in that two genes encoded proteins that were longer and one gene encoded a shorter protein. All Arabidopsis TIM23 predicted proteins appeared to lack the first 34 amino acids compared with yeast TIM23. All AtTIM17 andAtTIM23 genes were expressed but displayed different tissue and developmental profiles. Complementation of deletion mutants in yeast indicated that for AtTIM17, the extension at the C terminus not present in yeast had to be removed to achieve complementation, whereas for TIM23, a preprotein and amino acid transporter domain had to be present for complementation. Import assays with AtTIM17 and AtTIM23 indicated that they both contained internal signals for integration into the inner mitochondrial membrane in a membrane potential-dependent manner. The C terminus of imported AtTIM17-2 was susceptible to degradation by externally added protease with intact mitochondria. Removal of the 85 C-terminal amino acids resulted in import and full protection of the truncated protein. This suggests that the novel extension at the C terminus of AtTIM17-2 links the outer and inner membrane in a manner analogous to yeast TIM23.
!~RES~! We searched the Arabidopsis genome for homologs ofTIM17:23. Three homologs for TIM17 on chromosomes 1, 2 and 5 were found and called AtTIM17-1,AtTIM17-2, and AtTIM17-3, respectively (At1g20350, At2g37410, and At5g11690). The predicted proteins display 52% similarity and 44%, 47%, and 42% identity, respectively, with ScTIM17. Three homologs for TIM23 were found, two on chromosome 1 (AtTIM23-1 [At1g17530] and AtTIM23-2[At1g72750]) and one on chromosome 3 (AtTIM23-3[At3g04800]), predicted proteins displaying 35% similarity and 27%, 26%, and 22% identity, respectively, toScTIM23. Two homologs to TIM44(AtTIM44-1 [At2g20510] andAtTIM44-2 [At2g36070]) were detected on chromosome 2, predicted proteins both displayed 23% identity and 34% similarity to ScTIM44. Analysis of the predicted proteins for these homologs indicated that there were significant differences in the structures of the predicted TIM17 and TIM23 proteins (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. 1; supplementary data can be viewed at www.plantphysiol.org). In comparison with ScTIM17 with 158 amino acids, the plant homologs AtTIM17-1 and AtTIM17-2 contain a 60 and 85 amino acid extension at the C terminus of the protein, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, AtTIM17-3 was 25 amino acids shorter at the C terminus (Supplementary Fig. 1). All three were predicted to have four transmembrane regions. However, withAtTIM17-3, the fourth predicted transmembrane region was at the very end of the protein (Supplementary Fig. 1). All three of the predicted TIM23 proteins were very similar, containing 187 or 188 amino acids, 34 and 35 amino acids shorter than ScTIM23. Four transmembrane regions were predicted, similar to the yeast protein. The Arabidopsis predicted TIM44 proteins were 42 and 69 amino acids longer than ScTIM44 at the N terminus of the protein and were not predicted to contain any transmembrane regions. The N-terminal extension of the Arabidopsis proteins are predicted by TargetP to represent a mitochondrial targeting sequence and contain a potential −3R processing signal of RRF*S between amino acids 113 and 114 (CITATION; CITATION). There is no evidence of N-terminal cleavable targeting signals for the TIM17 and TIM23 proteins. None of the ArabidopsisTIM17 or TIM23 genes contains any introns. The two genes encoding TOM9 in Arabidopsis are the only other import components that do not appear to contain introns (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] We analyzed the expression of all of the genes forAtTIM17 and AtTIM23 and compared them with threeAtTIM22, which represents the other TIM (CITATION). The expression of three nuclear-encoded ribosomal genes were analyzed, with AtRPS15a located in the cytosol, AtRPS1 located in the plastid, and AtRPS13 located in the mitochondrion (CITATION; Fig.2). All TIM17,TIM22, and TIM23 genes were expressed. However changes in expression were evident between tissues and with development (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Notable differences were thatAtTIM17-1was expressed at very low levels in roots compared with all other TIM genes analyzed. In fact, it was similar toAtRPS1, which encoded a chloroplast-located ribosomal protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). AtTIM17-2 andAtTIM23-1 and AtTIM23-2 were the highest expressed forms for these genes and peaked at the earliest and latest stages of cotyledon development. The peak at the later stages of cotyledon development was not observed for AtTIM22-2, the highest expressed form for this translocase (Supplementary Fig. 3).  [[FIGURE]] Yeast TIM17 and TIM23 are essential proteins for viability, so we tested the ability of the Arabidopsis homologs to complement these genes using a gene replacement strategy (CITATION; CITATION). This strategy also had the advantage of being less harsh in that the ability of the Arabidopsis homologs to complement under normal growth conditions and was not dependent on the ability of the Arabidopsis homologs to support sporulation. The constructs tested and the ability to complement are shown in Figure 2. AtTIM17-3 and AtTIM17-2 were not able to complement a defect in the corresponding yeast gene. When the region encoding the 85-amino acid extension of AtTIM17-2was deleted, it supported growth of the deleted ScTIM17strain. AtTIM23-2 was unable to complement a yeast deletion in ScTIM23. Examination of the predicted AtTIM23 proteins indicated that although AtTIM23-3 has a preprotein and amino acid transporters (PRAT) domain, AtTIM23-1 andAtTIM23-2 lack this domain (CITATION). This domain, G/AX2F/YX10RX3DX6[G/A/S]GX3G, is present in all predicted TIM23 proteins from yeast and mammalian systems (CITATION). In AtTIM23-1 and AtTIM23-2, the Arg is replaced by a Thr. When this Thr codon at position 132 was changed to an Arg codon inAtTIM23-2, complementation of a yeast deletion inTIM23 was observed. Therefore complementation was dependent on the presence of the PRAT domain. We made a chimeric construct consisting of the region encoding first 50 amino acids of ScTIM23 fused to AtTIM23-2(y[1-50]At[1-188]TIM23), because it had been previously reported that this portion of ScTIM23 connects the inner and outer membranes and is necessary for efficient protein import and cell growth (CITATION). This construct failed to complement the deleted ScTIM23 strain, even when it was modified to contain a PRAT domain. Therefore although an Arabidopsis TIM23 gene with a PRAT domain can complement a deletion of ScTIM23, it cannot do this if the region encoding first 50 amino acids of ScTIM23 are placed in front. This suggests that while functionally similar, the plant and yeast proteins are structurally different. The ΔScTIM17 and ΔScTIM23 deletion strains complemented with AtTIM17-2Δ143-243 andAtTIM23-2(PRAT) displayed better growth at 22°C compared with 30°C. In both cases, this was slower than growth supported by the yeast gene on a plasmid, most dramatically forTIM17. We investigated the import of AtTIM17 andAtTIM23 into isolated soybean (Glycine max) cotyledon mitochondria. Additionally, we used yeast mitochondria andScTIM17 and ScTIM23 to compare the import and topology of the plant TIMs to this well-characterized system. We then characterized the topology and import characteristics ofAtTIM17-2 and AtTIM23-2 in detail because the genes encoding these proteins were highly expressed. To verify the location and intactness of mitochondria used in the in vitro import assays, we carried out western-blot analysis against proteins present in different mitochondrial locations (Fig.3). The outer membrane protein TOM20 was susceptible to protease digestion in both mitochondria and mitoplasts. The inter membrane space protein cytochrome c was only accessible to protease digestion in mitoplasts, whereas the inner membrane uncoupling protein and matrix-located HSP60 were resistant to protease digestion. These results verify the intactness of mitochondria, the rupture of the outer membrane by osmotic shock, and that the concentration of protease used did not digest known integral membrane proteins.  [[FIGURE]] Because ScTIM23 links the inner and outer membrane, we carried out import studies on AtTim23-2 to investigate if it was also accessible to externally added protease with intact mitochondria. AtTIM23-2 contains a single Met at residue 1, which provides a convenient point to investigate the location of the N terminus of this protein. We either placed two additional Met residues in front of the start codon to produce AtTIM23-2 (2M, −2, −1) or changed two Ile residues at positions 116 and 117 to Met residues to produce AtTIM23-2 (2M, 116, 117), and a combination of both, AtTIM23-2 (4M, −2, −1, 116, 117).AtTIM23-2 (4M, −2, −1, 116, 117) was imported into isolated mitochondria and produced a membrane-protected fragment of 16 kD when the outer membrane was ruptured by osmotic swelling to allow access of added protease to the inter membrane space (Fig.4, i). Import studies withAtTIM23-2 (2M, −2, −1) yielded the same results except that no protected fragment was evident when the outer membrane was ruptured (Fig. 4, ii). This was due to the position of the radiolabeled Met residues at the N terminus of the protein, making them accessible to added protease when the outer membrane was ruptured. However an inner membrane-protected fragment was detected withAtTIM23-2 (2M, 116, 117), because the added Met labels in this case were located in the predicted transmembrane region 2 and thus would be protected from digestion by added protease (Supplementary Fig. 1; Fig. 4, iii). This indicated that under normal import conditions with intact mitochondria, the N terminus of AtTIM23-2 was not accessible to externally added protease, in contrast to what has been observed with ScTIM23 (CITATION; Fig. 4, v). A chimeric protein between the first 50 amino acids of ScTIM23 and AtTIM23-2 (y[1–50]At[1–188]TIM23) was imported into both soybean and yeast mitochondria and produced an inner membrane-protected fragment upon rupture of the outer membrane. It also generated a small breakdown fragment with protease-treated mitochondria, indicating that the first 50 amino acids of ScTIM23 also appear to have some sequence at the N-terminal exposed on the outer membrane upon import into plants (Fig. 4, vi). However, this smaller breakdown product was not observed in soybean mitochondria when ScTIM23 alone was used, only when the four membrane-spanning segments of TIM23 were fromAtTIM23-2 (Fig. 4, soybean v and vi). The import signal for insertion into the inner membrane of AtTIM23-2 is located at the C terminus of the protein as deletion of residues 143 to 188 abolishes import (Fig. 4, iv). In summary, AtTIM23-2 contains an internal targeting sequence between residues 143 and 188 similar to ScTIM23. However, in contrast to the situation in yeast, the N terminus of the plant protein does not appear to be accessible to protease in intact mitochondria.  [[FIGURE]] Import studies were carried out with AtTIM17-2 to investigate its topology and to elucidate the signals that define mitochondrial localization. In contrast to AtTIM23-2,AtTIM17-2 contains numerous Met residues and a Met-rich region beginning at residue 143. This causes the production of several products upon in vitro translation. Using site-directed mutagenesis to change Met residues 1, 25, 57, and 90 to Ile residues, it was concluded that the first four bands with apparent molecular masses of 31, 28, 26, and 25 kD arose from precocious translation initiation at each of these sites, respectively (Fig. 5A). Additionally, the major band at 18 kD likely corresponds to translation initiated at the triple Met residues (position 143–146) based on a similar size comparison when this fragment was expressed alone (Fig.5A).  [[FIGURE]] Translation of AtTIM17-2 produced a precursor protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD, which upon import into mitochondria and protease treatment produced a breakdown fragment of 28 kD in a membrane potential-dependent manner (Fig. 5B, i). Rupture of the outer membrane before protease treatment yielded an inner membrane-protected fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kD. With yeast mitochondria import of AtTIM17-2 was reduced and thus only a faint breakdown fragment was apparent with intact mitochondria, but an inner membrane-protected fragment was produced upon protease treatment of mitoplasts (Fig. 5B, i). The C-terminal extension of AtTIM17-2 apparently does not contain mitochondrial targeting information because it was not imported into either soybean or yeast mitochondria when expressed (Fig. 5B, ii). The first 143 amino acids contained the mitochondrial targeting signal for insertion into the inner membrane between residues 103 and 117 (Fig.5B, iii–v). AtTIM17-2Δ143-243, which complemented a yeast deletion in ScTIM17, upon translation was imported into both soybean and yeast mitochondria with equal efficiency and protected in mitoplasts (Fig. 5B, iv). This indicates that the first 143 amino acids contained the targeting signal for insertion into the inner membrane between residues 103 and 117 (Fig. 5B, iii–v). There was no change in apparent molecular mass of this product in mitoplasts treated with protease because it was indistinguishable in size from the inner membrane-protected product seen with AtTIM17-2. In summary, under the import conditions used,AtTIM17-2 is imported into mitochondria under the direction of an internal targeting signal in a membrane potential-dependent manner. A portion of the protein appears to be accessible to externally added protease. A similar pattern of import for TIM17 and TIM23 was observed with purified Arabidopsis mitochondria, however, we routinely used purified soybean cotyledon mitochondria due to the availability of antibodies to verify mitochondrial purity and intactness and to probe intramitochondrial location. All three TIM17 and TIM23 proteins were tested for uptake into mitochondria. All proteins exceptAtTIM17-3 were imported into mitochondria, but none were imported into chloroplasts (data not shown).
!~MM~! All bioinformatic programs were used with the default settings unless specified otherwise. BioNavigator (http://www.entigen.com) was used to facilitate the analysis, including the use of programs by the Genetics Computer Group (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Sequence information for the yeast import components was obtained from theSaccharomyces Genome Database (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/). The yeast gene and protein sequences were used to search GenBank (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and The Institute for Genomic Research (http://www.tigr.org/) Arabidopsis sequence databases for homologs by BLASTN, BLASTP, and TBLASTN alignment (CITATION). Protein sequences were deduced from nucleic acid sequences using Translate (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin). Protein alignments were generated using PileUp (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin). Percentage identity and similarity between yeast and Arabidopsis proteins was calculated using Gap (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin). Prediction of transmembrane regions was performed using the DAS transmembrane prediction server (CITATION;http://www.sbc.su.se/approximately miklos/DAS/). Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis tissue using the RNeasy Plant mini protocol (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Australia). Total RNA was reverse transcribed with the appropriate reverse primer (refer to PCR primers below) using Expand Reverse Transcriptase as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Diagnostics, Sydney). Five microliters of the resulting cDNA was used in a PCR reaction with the appropriate forward and reverse primers (30 pmol each) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification profile consisted of 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension cycle of 72°C for 5 min and then 22°C for 6 min. Fragments amplified by PCR were purified by either the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit or QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Sydney) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The following PCR primers were used to clone the genes from plants and yeast: AT TIM17-1 fwd, CCCTAAAAAGTTACTTGTAG;AT TIM17-1 rev, TCAGACCTCAATAATTCCATC; AT TIM17-2 fwd, ATGGGAACACCAGAGACATC; AT TIM17-2 rev, TTACTTGAACTCAAATGATGGCACCG; AT TIM17-3 fwd, ATGGACACTAAGAAGAAATC; AT TIM17-3 rev, TTACTTGCTCCCGAACGGAGGG; AT TIM22-1 fwd, ATGGCTGATTCGAGTGCTGC; AT TIM22-1 rev, CTACTCAGGGATGCTAGTTG; AT TIM22-2 fwd, ATGGCGGCGAACGATTCTTC; AT TIM22-2 rev, TTAGAACTTCCTTGGTTTAGCTAAGG; AT TIM22-3 fwd, ATGGCGGCCGAGAATTCTTC; AT TIM22-3 rev, TCAACGAGCATGAGGAAATTTGAGC; AT TIM23-1 fwd, CGTCTCCCGTCTTCTTCTAATG; AT TIM23-1 rev, GGGCTCTAAAGATCACTCCGG; AT TIM23-2 fwd, ATGGCGGCTAATAACAGATC; AT TIM23-2 rev, TCAAATGGGCACATACCGC; AT TIM23-3 fwd, ATGGCGGATCCGATGAACCATAG; AT TIM23-3 rev, TTAGATTGGAACGAATCGC; Yeast TIM17 fwd, AATAGAGTACACGGGAGCG; Yeast TIM17 rev, CTAAGCTTGCAGAGGTTGAGAG; Yeast TIM23 fwd, ATGTCGTGGCTTTTTGGAGATAAG; and Yeast TIM23 rev, TCATTTTTCAAGTAGTCTTTTC. Total RNA was isolated three separate times from Arabidopsis tissue using the RNeasy Plant mini protocol (Qiagen). Each batch of total RNA was treated with DNaseI (Roche Diagnostics) to remove contaminating DNA and reverse transcribed using Expand Reverse Transcriptase as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Diagnostics). Primers used in the reverse transcription were random primers (Roche Diagnostics) for the analysis of transcripts in different tissues and poly-A primer (Roche Diagnostics) for the cotyledon transcript analysis. This yielded three separate lots of cDNA. The QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used to purify the cDNA before real-time PCR analysis. Three ribosomal protein genes, one for a cytosolic ribosomal protein RPS15A, one for a nuclear encoded plastid ribosomal protein RPS1, and one for a nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteinRPS13, were used for comparison against the gene expression profiles of the TIM components (CITATION). The primers used in the real-time PCR reactions for analysis of gene expression are listed below: AT TIM17-1 fwd, CGTTCAAGCTTTGAGAATG; AT TIM17-1 rev, GCTCGTTATGCGCAGTAC;AT TIM17-2 fwd, GTGAGCATGAACGCACCTCG; AT TIM17-2 rev, CAGGCATTCCTTGCATTCCAGG; AT TIM17-3 fwd, CTAAGGAACATGGCCTATACC; AT TIM17-3 rev, CAGAACTCCACCTGTAGC; AT TIM22-1 fwd, GATAGGCATCTCTTGTATGG; AT TIM22-1 rev, CTCTTGGTGTATGGGAAACG; AT TIM22-2 fwd, CACTGACGGTGACGAAGC; AT TIM22-2 rev, CAGACTGCCCTGCATCTG;AT TIM22-3 fwd, ACAAACCAGAAGTCCCCAAC; AT TIM22-3 rev, TCAACGAGCATGAGGAAATTTG; AT TIM23-1 fwd, CGTAGCTCCGATCATGAATCC; AT TIM23-1 rev, GGCTAGATAACCCGTCCCTG; AT TIM23-2 fwd, ATCCGATCATGGGTCAGACG; AT TIM23-2 rev, TGACCAGAAGAGTTCAAGATCC; AT TIM23-3 fwd, ATGGCGGATCCGATGAACC; AT TIM23-3 rev, CCGCAATTGTACCCTTGAAG; AT RPS1 fwd, TATCGCAACTGTTCTTCAGCC; AT RPS1 rev, TCAGAACTCAGCGTCAGTCC; AT RPS15A fwd, CACTGGAGGCAAGCAGAAGC; AT RPS15A rev, AAGTGTCTTAGTACGTACAAGC; AT RPS13 fwd, ATCAGCCAGTCTCTGCTTCG; and AT RPS13 rev, TCAGTTCATCACCATGCTGG. Transcript levels were assayed using the LightCycler and FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 μL with a final concentration of 0.008% (w/v) bovine serum albumin under conditions optimized to minimize primer-dimer formation and to maximize amplification efficiency. The LightCycler protocol consisted of four programs: denaturation, 95°C for 10 min; amplification, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, touchdown annealing from 85°C to 45°C decreasing 2°C per cycle for 5 s, 72°C for 15 s with single data acquisition; melting curve analysis, 95°C for 0 s, 70°C for 60 s, 95°C for 0 s with a transition rate of 0.1°C s−1 and continuous data acquisition; cooling, 40°C for 30 s. DNA was amplified from the cloned genes by PCR using the cloning primers and purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) for use as standard template DNA in real-time PCR reactions. The concentration of standard template DNA was quantitated using the PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was generated by real-time PCR analysis of 10-fold serial dilutions of the standard template DNA. Transcript levels were assessed using 10−1 dilutions of the cDNA prepared from Arabidopsis tissue of different ages. Absence of primer-dimer and/or nonspecific product accumulation was checked by melting curve analysis and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Template abundance was quantified using the second derivative maximum method of the LightCycler v3.5 software to determine the cycle at which each PCR reaction reached exponential amplification (Roche Diagnostics). From the three independent cDNA preparations, each transcript was analyzed twice giving a minimum of six replicates for each data point. These was calculated for every data point. Absolute transcript levels were calculated from the standard curve of known DNA concentration. The data for each gene was normalized by setting the data point with the most abundant transcript to 100 and adjusting the other data points of that gene relative to it. Diploid deletion strains for ScTIM17 (YJL143w) and ScTIM23 (YNR017w) were obtained from EUROSCARF (http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf; CITATION). BY4743; Mat a/α'3b his3Δ1/his3Δ1′3b leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0/LYS2Δ'3b MET15/met15Δ0′3b ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0′3b YJL143w::kanMX4/YJL143w. BY4743; Mat a/α'3b his3Δ1/his3Δ1′3b leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0/LYS2Δ'3b MET15/met15Δ0′3b ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0′3b YNR017w::kanMX4/YNR017w. The KANMX4 insertion in the appropriate gene was confirmed by PCR. Confirmation of the strains was carried out using the primer sets:Sc-TIM17-fwd, GGGTAACCCGGCATTCTTGCG;Sc-TIM17-rev, CATGGTTGAGAGAAATGGTTGG; Sc-TIM23-fwd, GGTTATTGCATTCGCCCTCC;Sc-TIM23-rev, CCGGGTTTCTACTTTCATTGG; andkanMX4-rev, CAATCATAGATTGTCGCACC. The ability of Arabidopsis homologs to complement the deletion in the yeast genes was tested by a gene replacement approach. The yeast genes for TIM17 and TIM23 were cloned into Yep352 plasmid under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenease promoter (CITATION). The Arabidopsis homologs and various deletions and chimerics to be tested for their ability to complement were cloned into p425 Gal1 (CITATION). The yeast genes were transformed into the appropriate deletion strains (ScTIM17 into YJL143w andScTIM23 into YNR017w), and transformants were selected on Western Australia-Glc minus uracil plates. These diploid cells were induced to sporulate, and tetrad dissection was carried out for each strain (CITATION). Tetrads were grown on WA minus uracil and Met or WA minus uracil and Lys to ensure the accuracy of the tetrad dissection. Tetrads that showed a 2:2 segregation for above were grown on WA minus uracil with Geneticin G418 (400 μg mL−1), and resistant colonies were used to transform with p425 Gal1 containing the Arabidopsis gene construct. Transformants were selected on WA minus uracil and Leu plates and replica plates onto WA-Gal minus Leu plus uracil (50 mg L−1), plus 5-fluoro-orotic acid (1 g L−1). The ability to grow on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid was monitored at 22°C and 30°C, and colonies were replica plated at least three subsequent times over a period of 1 month so that the ability to grow was accurately determined. At least 10 individual transformants were monitored for each gene construct. Colonies that displayed growth were cultured in liquid WA-Gal minus Leu medium and were used to determine the growth rate from anA 600 of 0.2 over a period of a week. This growth rate was compared with the parental haploid that was Geneticin resistant so the only difference between the two strains was the plasmid that carried either the ScTIM gene (Yep 352) or the plasmid that carried the Arabidopsis gene (p425 Gal1) that supported growth. cDNA for AtTIM17-2, AtTIM23-2,ScTIM17, and ScTIM23 in pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) where subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega, Melbourne). The various constructs and deletions of TIM17 andTIM23 were produced using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and standard molecular biology techniques. Precursor proteins where translated using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]Met under either the SP6 or T7 promoter (Promega). Mitochondria and mitoplasts from 7-d-old soybean (Glycine max) cotyledons and yeast were isolated as outlined previously (CITATION; CITATION;CITATION). Import assays were performed as previously described for soybean (CITATION). Import assays into yeast mitochondria varied to contain 2 mm ATP, 2 mmGTP, and 2 mm NADH. Fifty milligrams of proteinase K was added to import assays where indicated to determine whether the precursor protein was imported into mitochondria, Protease treatments of mitochondria and mitoplasts were carried out as previously described (CITATION; CITATION). Proteins were separated by 12% or 16% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained, dried, exposed to a BAS TR2040S plate for 24 h, and detected using a BAS 2500 (Fuji, Tokyo). Mitoplasts were prepared after import via osmotic swelling. The mitochondria were pelleted after import and resuspended in 10 μL of SEH buffer (250 mm Suc, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). One hundred and fifty-five microliters of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was added and incubated on ice for 20 min, and 25 μL of 2 m Suc and 10 μL of 3m KCl was added and mixed. The sample was aliquoted into two where to one proteinase K was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to stop the reaction, and mitoplasts were pelleted. Mitochondrial proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Sydney) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Millipore, Sydney) and were incubated with primary antibodies against matrix HSP60 (StressGen, Canada), intermembrane space cytochromec (BD Biosciences, San Diego), inner membrane uncoupling protein (CITATION) and TOM20 (Dr H.-P. Braun, University of Hannover, Germany). Chemiluminescence was used for detection using a LAS 1000 (Fuji).
