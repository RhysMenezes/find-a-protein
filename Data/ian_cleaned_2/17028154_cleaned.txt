!~ABS~! The sucrose nonfermenting-1 protein kinase (SNF1)/AMP-activated protein kinase subfamily plays a central role in metabolic responses to nutritional and environmental stresses. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals, the β- and γ-noncatalytic subunits are implicated in substrate specificity and subcellular localization, respectively, and regulation of the kinase activity. The atypical βγ-subunit has been previously described in maize (Zea mays), presenting at its N-terminal end a sequence related to the KIS (kinase interacting sequence) domain specific to the β-subunits (Lumbreras et al., 2001). The existence of two components, SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1) complexes containing the βγ-subunit and one SnRK1 kinase, had been proposed. In this work, we show that, despite its unusual features, the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog AKINβγ clearly interacts with AKINβ-subunits in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its involvement in heterotrimeric complexes located in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Unexpectedly, a transcriptional analysis of AKINβγ gene expression highlighted the implication of alternative splicing mechanisms in the regulation of AKINβγ expression. A two-hybrid screen performed with AKINβγ as bait, together with in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments, suggests the existence of interactions in the cytosol between AKINβγ and two leucine-rich repeats related to pathogen resistance proteins. Interestingly, this interaction occurs through the truncated KIS domain that corresponds exactly to a GBD (glycogen-binding domain) recently described in mammals and yeast. A phylogenetic study suggests that AKINβγ-related proteins are restricted to the plant kingdom. Altogether, these data suggest the existence of plant-specific SnRK1 trimeric complexes putatively involved in a plant-specific function such as plant-pathogen interactions.
!~RES~! Mammalian AMPKγ1, γ2, γ3, and yeast SNF4 were used as probes to screen the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases (nr and dbest restricted to Arabidopsis). Some of the retrieved sequences correspond partially to the AtSNF4 cDNA initially published by CITATION, but their 5′ end differs from the annotations of the corresponding bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and of AtSNF4 cDNA. Actually, 5′ RACE experiments revealed the existence of two other exons and of a long 5′ untranslated region (UTR) located upstream of the first predicted ATG of AtSNF4 related to a KIS domain. Such a structure has been previously described by CITATION in maize (ZmAKINβγ-1 and ZmAKINβγ-2) and the Arabidopsis ortholog was named AKINβγ. Interestingly, the KIS domain of these subunits is truncated compared to the KIS domains of the β-subunits and corresponds exactly to the GBD domain recently described in AMPKβ1 (CITATION; CITATION) and GAL83 (CITATION). For this reason, we propose to name this domain KIS/GBD. The AKINβγ Arabidopsis gene contains 13 exons and 12 introns encoding a 2.3-kb long cDNA corresponding to a protein of 487 amino acids (53 kD; Fig. 1A ). The length of the AKINβγ cDNA is in accordance with the 2.2-kb length found for ZmAKINβγ-1 and βγ-2 in maize (CITATION). Two kinds of PCR products were obtained and cloned after a 3′ RACE PCR, the largest including the unspliced intron 10. The two full-length cDNAs were named AKINβγ and AKINβγI (with and without intron 10, respectively). The protein sequence deduced from the AKINβγI cDNA is reduced to 394 amino acids (43.3 kD) due to the presence of a stop codon located 6 bp downstream of the beginning of intron 10. Therefore, one of the most conserved regions of the protein, mainly corresponding to the fourth CBS domain, is deleted in AKINβγI. [[FIGURE]] To determine if the presence of the two cDNAs corresponds to an artifact product obtained during the building of the shoot library or to an alternative splicing, an analysis of the expression of these two cDNAs has been performed. The small difference in size observed between the two cDNAs (100 bp) did not allow us to separate AKINβγ and AKINβγI transcripts by northern-blot experiments (data not shown). Therefore, PCR experiments were performed using two pairs of oligonucleotides designed to selectively amplify each of the two putative cDNAs. One oligonucleotide (E9Forward), common to both cDNAs, is located on the exon 9, while a second is located either on the exon10/intron10 junction (E10/E11Reverse) to amplify a fragment of 117 bp corresponding to AKINβγ cDNA (without intron 10), or in intron 10 (I10Reverse) to amplify a 175-bp fragment corresponding to AKINβγI cDNA (including intron 10; Fig. 1B). DNA from eight cDNA libraries was used as templates. The sizes of the two PCR products of 117 and 175 bp correspond to the fragments amplified using the two control cDNAs [pGEMT vectors containing either AKINβγ (−I) or AKINβγI (+I) cDNA; Fig. 1C]. AKINβγ mRNA is ubiquitously expressed. On the other hand, a high level of AKINβγI mRNA is observed when using the libraries prepared from seeds, leaves, and pollen, while it is almost undetectable in siliques, roots, hypocotyls, and etiolated seedlings. Nevertheless, whatever the organs or conditions tested, AKINβγI mRNA is always present. These data, also obtained by reverse transcription-PCR experiments (data not shown), confirm the existence of an alternative splicing event. Two-hybrid experiments and in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to study protein-protein interactions between AKINβγ/βγI and the AKINα1/α2 kinases (Fig. 2 ). The whole coding sequences of AKINβγ or AKINβγI were fused in-frame with the HA epitope and the GAL4 activation domain (AD) by cloning into the pGADT7 vector. The AKINα1 and α2 kinases were fused in-frame with the GAL4-binding domain (BD) and c-Myc epitope by cloning into the pGBKT7 vector. The two-hybrid experiments and in vitro binding assays show as expected that AKINβγ interacts with both kinases AKINα1 and α2, while no interaction was detected between AKINβγI and the kinases (Fig. 2). Therefore, the interaction between AKINβγ and the kinases appears to be lost when a region containing the fourth CBS domain (CBS4) is absent. Nevertheless, no interaction with the kinases could be detected using the CBS4 domain alone either in two-hybrid experiments or in in vitro binding assays. Thus, the domain absent in AKINβγI appears necessary but not sufficient for the interaction with the kinases. [[FIGURE]] To test whether, despite the absence of interaction with the AKINα kinases, AKINβγI protein was still able to act as a γ-subunit, we performed yeast snf4 complementation experiments. While the full-length AKINβγ protein complements the yeast snf4 mutant on medium lacking Glc as carbon source, AKINβγI protein does not (data not shown). The KIS/GBD of AKINβγ has been previously shown to interact with the kinase without the requirement of a β-subunit, suggesting the existence of dimeric complexes composed by AKINβγ and one of the kinases in which this KIS/GBD domain could play the role of a β-subunit (CITATION). To test if the existence of the KIS/GBD in a γ-type subunit prevents the formation of trimeric complexes, two-hybrid, in vitro coimmunoprecipitation and in planta BiFC experiments were performed using AKINβγ, AKINβγI, and each domain of AKINβ-subunits (Fig. 3 ). Interactions have been detected between AKINβγ and each of the three β-subunits (AKINβ1, β2, and β3; Fig. 3B, lanes FL) in vitro. The β-galactosidase activity measured for the interaction involving AKINβγ was 2.3- and 11.2-fold higher with AKINβ2 than with AKINβ3 and β1, respectively. However, no interaction was detected with these proteins when using AKINβγI in two-hybrid experiments (data not shown). These results were confirmed by BiFC experiments performed between AKINβγ fused to the N-terminal domain of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; YN-AKINβγ) and the AKINβ-subunits fused with the C-terminal domain of the YFP (YC-AKINβ; Fig. 3A). All combinations led to a YFP signal showing a clear in planta interaction between YN-AKINβγ- and YC-AKINβ-subunits. Interestingly, the YFP signal is located both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as presented in Figure 3A, for a classical β-subunit (YN-AKINβγ/YC-AKINβ2 interaction) and for the plant-specific one (YN-AKINβγ/YC-AKINβ3 interaction). No YFP signal was detected when YN-AKINβγ and YC-AKINβ1/2/3 were independently infiltrated (data not shown). Moreover, as a negative control, the PAS1 protein (CITATION) that does not interact with SnRK1 subunits was fused to YC and YN and cotransformed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves with YN-AKINβγ and YC-AKINβ1/2/3, respectively. No YFP fluorescence was detected in any case (data not shown), confirming the relevance of the previously shown interactions. [[FIGURE]] To precisely determine the domains involved in these interactions, the sequences encoding SNF4, KIS/GBD, and CBS4 domains of AKINβγ and the N-terminal, KIS, and ASC domains of AKINβ1/2/3 were subcloned into pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors and used in similar experiments (Fig. 3B). The ASC domains of all AKINβ-subunits were sufficient to direct the interaction with the SNF4 domain of AKINβγ, while the KIS/GBD of AKINβγ does not interact with any AKINβ-subunits. No interaction was detected using other domains of AKINβγ or AKINβ1/2/3 (data not shown). At present, the AKINβγ-type subunits have been described only in maize, Arabidopsis, and Medicago truncatula (CITATION; CITATION). To look for AKINβγ-related sequences in other organisms, the NCBI databases were screened using the AKINβγ sequence as a probe. The retrieved sequences from plants, mammals, yeast, D. melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans were aligned using ClustalX (CITATION). The corresponding γ-related sequences were restricted to the SNF4 region and used to draw a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4 ). The plant γ-subunits appear separated from other organisms and distributed into three subgroups corresponding to three γ-subunits previously published: PV42p from Phaseolus vulgaris (CITATION) and AKINγ (CITATION) and AKINβγ from Arabidopsis. The group including AKINβγ appears closer to the nonplant group containing the mammalian, yeast, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans sequences than to the other plant γ-proteins. Interestingly, the proteins corresponding to the nine sequences grouped with AKINβγ present the same AKINβγ atypical structure with a KIS/GBD fused to an SNF4 domain. Moreover, proteins presenting similar structures have never been found in other groups, neither in the plant PV42p and AKINγ subgroups nor in nonplant organisms. [[FIGURE]] The large number of sequences analyzed in this work show that this type of protein is present in most plant organisms and emphasizes the hypothesis proposed by CITATION that AKINβγ-type subunits could be specific to the plant kingdom. To get information about the function of the AKINβγ-type subunits in plants, we decided to search for partners of this protein by performing a two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library from Arabidopsis 3-week-old rosettes using the full-length AKINβγ cDNA as bait. Thirty-two clones presenting a β-galactosidase activity higher than three units corresponding to the basal β-galactosidase activity level of BD-AKINβγ were further analyzed and sequenced. In this article, we present the characterization of 22 of these clones. NCBI databases (nr and dbest) were screened with BLASTN and TBLASTX algorithms (CITATION) to find sequence similarities with the preys. Nine clones corresponded to two already-known members of the AKIN complex: AKINβ1 (one clone) and AKINβ2 (eight clones; CITATION). The clone corresponding to AKINβ1 is truncated to one-half of the ASC domain previously described by CITATION; position +236 after the first Met), thus lacking the Nterm, KIS domain, and part of the ASC domain. The 13 other clones encode two Arabidopsis unknown proteins that present strong similarities with the Hs1pro-1 protein encoded by a nematode resistance gene isolated in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris; CITATION). One clone, named AtHSPRO1, is assigned to BAC AL163832 on chromosome III (At3g55840). Analysis of the corresponding genomic sequence and of 13 overlapping expressed sequence tags (ESTs) found in the NCBI database suggests that this clone is full length. The 12 other clones found during the two-hybrid screen are assigned to BAC AF002019 on chromosome II (At2g40000). This cDNA, named AtHSPRO2, appears full length according to the analysis of the BAC and of the 93 available ESTs. AtHSPRO1 and AtHSPRO2 are the two Arabidopsis orthologs of the sugar beet Hs1pro-1 gene and no other related sequences have been characterized in the Arabidopsis genome. The location of these two genes in duplicated regions of chromosomes II and III could explain their high percentage of similarity (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/Arabidopsis_genome_duplication.shtml). The two Arabidopsis predicted proteins AtHSPRO1 and 2 are 75% identical and 86% similar. Both of them share 59% identity and 78% similarity with the sugar beet Hs1pro-1 protein (Fig. 5 ). Moreover, three sequences from Glycine max, Pisum sativum, and Hordeum vulgare were available in the database. The alignment of the Hs1pro-1-related proteins found in Arabidopsis, G. max (AAG44839), and P. sativum (AAF67003) highlights an N-terminal extension compared to the Hs1pro-1 protein from sugar beet (Fig. 5). The two Arabidopsis proteins present imperfect LRR but no nucleotide-binding site (NBS) or kinase domain previously described for Hs1pro-1 (CITATION; Fig. 5). The existence of a putative transmembrane domain in Hs1pro-1 has also been reported by CITATION. Nevertheless, the corresponding regions in the two Arabidopsis proteins present several differences, and the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) Arabidopsis database does not predict the presence of any transmembrane domain in these proteins. [[FIGURE]] Northern-blot experiments were performed to analyze the expression patterns of AKINβγ and of the two isolated preys and to determine if they were expressed in the same organs or conditions (Fig. 6 ). AKINβγ gene is expressed constitutively in all the organs tested, while AtHSPRO1 and AtHSPRO2 appear to be differentially expressed. AtHSPRO2 mRNA is ubiquitous, high in cotyledons, roots, and flower organs, and increases dramatically during senescence (senescent leaves 1 and 2). At the contrary, the AtHSPRO1 messenger remains undetectable or at a very low level except in roots and in senescent leaves. These data are in accordance with the number of ESTs reported for these two proteins in the MIPS Arabidopsis database. [[FIGURE]] To confirm the putative interactions between AtHSPRO1/2 and AKIN complexes and to precisely determine the domains of interaction with AKINβγ, two-hybrid experiments and in vitro binding assays were performed using the full-length sequences of the preys and the AKINβγ subdomains described above cloned in pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors (Fig. 7 ). No interaction could be detected between these two proteins and AKINα, AKINβ, or AKINβγI either in two-hybrid experiments or in in vitro binding assays (data not shown). Concerning their interaction with AKINβγ, two-hybrid (Fig. 7B) and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7C) were confirmed by BiFC experiments performed between YN-AKINβγ and YC-HSPRO1 or YC-HSPRO2. Indeed, YFP signals were detected in the cytoplasm for both YN-AKINβγ/YC-HSPRO1 and YN-AKINβγ/YC-HSPRO2, confirming the in planta interaction between AKINβγ and HSPRO1/2 (Fig. 7A). Moreover, two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays show that the AtHSPRO1 and AtHSPRO2 proteins interact preferentially with the KIS/GBD domain of AKINβγ, while only a weak interaction remains with the SNF4 domain alone (Fig. 7, B and C).

!~MM~! Wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ecotype Columbia, were grown in a culture room and were maintained in soil with a 15-h-light and 9-h-dark regime (long day). Relative humidity was 65% and temperature was 20°C/17°C during the light/dark cycle. Germinated seedlings (used for RNA extraction) were grown in the dark on a Whatman Number 1 paper imbibed by water, relative humidity was 65%, and temperature was 20°C. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) SNF4 (accession no. M30470) and mammalian AMPKγ1, γ2, and γ3 (U42412, AJ249976, and NM_017431) were used to screen the NCBI database (nr and dbest restricted to Arabidopsis) with the TBLASTN algorithm (CITATION). Three ESTs (AI999237, AV540740, and AV552460) were selected. The corresponding gene was assigned to the BAC clone AC000106 of chromosome I. NetPlantGene (CITATION) and SIM4 (CITATION) programs were used, respectively, to determine the intron/exon structure of the gene and align the different ESTs with the genomic sequence. Amplification of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs was realized by PCR experiments performed on an Arabidopsis shoot cDNA library as previously described by CITATION. To determine the expression of the two AKINβγ mRNA containing (or not) the 10th intron, PCR experiments were performed on DNA of several cDNA libraries using three specific oligonucleotides. The downstream oligonucleotide (E9Forward) 5′-ACGCCTCTTTGGGTTCTGC-3′, localized in exon 9, was used with 5′-TATCATCAGAACACAAGGACG-3′ (I10Reverse) localized into the 10th intron for the amplification of a 175-bp fragment of the cDNA containing the 10th intron or with the oligonucleotide (E10/E11Reverse) 5′-GAGCAGTTCTATCACTTCGAGA-3′ localized on the exon10/intron10 junction in order to amplify the corresponding region of the AKINβγ cDNA spliced. cDNA libraries were previously described by CITATION. Total Arabidopsis RNA were isolated in the middle of the light treatment from 48-h-old germinated seedlings (seeds 48 h after imbibition) and from green siliques according to CITATION. Total RNA from 7-d-old germinated seedlings with two cotyledons (2 Cotyledons), leaves from 3- and 5-week-old rosettes (Leaves 1 and 2), leaves from mature rosettes before flowering (Senescent Leaves 1), yellowish mature leaves during flowering (Senescent Leaves 2), stems, floral buds, flowers, and 4-week-old roots grown under aeroponic conditions (Roots) were isolated according to CITATION. Samples have been taken in the middle of the light regime. RNAs (20 μg) were electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized as previously described by CITATION. The probes have been obtained by PCR amplification using specific primers and correspond to the full-length AKINβγ, AtHSPRO1, AtHSPRO2, and EF1α cDNAs. AKINβγ full-length cDNA was cloned downstream of the Gal4 AD or BD in pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors (CLONTECH) with specific oligonucleotides modified by 5′EcoRI and 3′BamHI restriction sites (5′ATGTTTGGTTCTAC3′ and 5′TCAAAGACCGAGCAG3′) to produce BD-AKINβγ and AD-AKINβγ. Specific oligonucleotides (5′-ATGGTTCCTGCTGGT-3′ and 5′-TCAAAGACCGAGCAG-3′, 5′-ATGTTTGGTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-TATTGTATTCACTAC-3′, 5′-ATGTTTGGTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-TACCTTCGAGAGTATATGTC-3′, and 5′-AGTGATATAACTGCTCTGGC-3′ and 5′-TCAAAGACCGAGCAGGAATTG-3′) modified with 5′EcoRI and 3′BamHI restriction sites were used to amplify AKINβγ SNF4107-598 domain, AKINβγ KIS/GBD1-106 domain, AKINβγ1-403 (truncated in the 10th intron), and AKINβγ424-598 (after intron 10 including the last CBS domain), respectively, and cloned into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors (CLONTECH) to produce BD-βγ107-598/AD-βγ107-598, BD-βγ1-106/AD-βγ1-106, BD-βγ1-403/AD-βγ1-403, and BD-βγ424-498/AD-βγ424-498, respectively. All these AKINβγ constructs were tested against each α- and β-member of the AKIN complex as described by CITATION. The BD and AD constructs were used to transform the yeast strain Y190, and protein interactions were assayed using LacZ-filter lift and o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside assays and by monitoring growth on SD medium without Leu, Trp, and His (SD-LTH) containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). The vectors described above were used to produce 35S-Met-labeled proteins fused with the c-Myc or the HA epitope. These fusion proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation using a TNTT7 Quick Transcription/Translation Lysate system (Promega). A total of 5 μL of each marked protein (or peptide) was incubated together into 400 μL of immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 6 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3) at 4°C for 1 h. After 2 h of incubation at 4°C with 1 μL of c-Myc monoclonal antibody or 10 μL of HA-Tag polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH), the mixture was incubated with 6 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma P3391) at 4°C for 1 h. The Sepharose was then washed eight times with 1 mL of the immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins were then detached from the protein A-Sepharose in 20 μL of Laemmli buffer at 85°C for 5 min and separated in SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film overnight at room temperature. The yeast strain HF7C (CITATION) carrying BD-AKINβγ bait was transformed with 500 μg of DNA from a pGAD424 cDNA library (AD-prey) from Arabidopsis 3-week-old rosettes (CLONTECH). The cells were then grown on SD-LTH (CITATION). A total of 6,000 transformants were streaked on SD-LTH plates in the presence of 25 mm 3-AT. A total of 286 transformants were grown on nitrocellulose filters (Whatman No. 5) and placed on SD-LTH plates containing 10, 25, or 50 mm 3-AT to check their LacZ+ phenotype by β-galactosidase assays. Yeast DNA was extracted according to CITATION and used to transform bacterial strain MC1066. Bacteria were then streaked on minimum medium without Leu to select only the library AD plasmid. Each AD-prey isolated was used to cotransform the yeast strain Y190 (CITATION) with BD-AKINβγ. β-Galactosidase measurement (as described previously by CITATION) and a monitoring of growth on SD-LTH containing 25 or 50 mm 3-AT allowed a quantification of protein interaction and the selection of clones on the basis of high LacZ+ phenotypes and their capacity to grow on SD-LTH with a high concentration of 3-AT. After selection, the selected clones were sequenced and database screening was used to characterize the putative partners. Finally, each AD-prey was cloned in the opposite vector pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) to produce BD-prey. After transformation of the yeast strain Y190, the β-galactosidase activity was measured. AKINβ2, AKINβ3, AKINβγ, AtHSPRO1, and AtHSPRO2 full-length cDNAs were cloned in the GATEWAY-compatible vector pDONR207 (Invitrogen) prior to being transferred in the BiFC GATEWAY-modified vector developed by F. Parcy (CEA-Grenoble, France). AKINβγ was fused to the N-terminal part of the YFP (YN) to produce 35S∷YN-AKINβγ. AKINβ2, AKINβ3, AtHSPRO1, and AtHSPRO2 were fused to the C-terminal part of the YFP (YC) to produce 35S∷YC-AKINβ2, 35S∷YC-AKINβ3, 35S∷YC-AtHSPRO1, and 35S∷YC-AtHSPRO2. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in the greenhouse under 13 h light, 25°C day temperature, and 17°C night temperature for all the agroinfiltration experiments. Leaves were infiltrated (CITATION) with an exponential phase culture Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 resuspended to an OD600 of 0.5 with the infiltration medium (10 mm MES, pH 5.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm acetosyringone). For the coinfiltration, equal volumes of both cultures were mixed before agroinfiltration. Observations were performed 48 h after infiltration. Confocal microscopy was performed on an inverted Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal laser scanning microscope. Samples were excited with a 514-nm argon laser (50%) with an emission band of 510 to 550 nm for YFP detection and 640 to 700 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence. Measurements of fluorescence emission spectra were carried out with an excitation at 488 nm (25%), and emission was detected between 500 and 600 nm at 5-nm intervals. The AKINγ sequence from Arabidopsis (CAB64720), Phaseolus vulgaris PV42p (AAA91175), yeast SNF4 (accession no. M30470), human AMPKγ1, γ2, and γ3 (U42412, AJ249976, and NM_017431), and Drosophila melanogaster (DmSNF4:AF094764) were used to search for overlapping ESTs and genomic sequences from different plant or nonplant organisms in the NCBI database (dbest and nr) using the TBLASTN algorithm (CITATION). Sequences related to the γ-subunits from Caenorhabditis elegans (CeSNF4:CAC35836) were retrieved from the genomic sequence analysis using HMM (CITATION) and annotations of the BAC. Published mammals AMPKγ (Sus scrofa, ScPRKAG3: AF214520; Rattus norvegicus, RnAMPKγ: U42413; Mus musculus, MmAMPKγ1; NM_016781; and MmAMPKγ2; BC015283) and yeast Kluyveromyces lactis KlSNF4 (AJ277480) sequences were used. For each organism, overlapping sequences were used to create contigs and then translated. Full-length sequences were aligned using ClustalX (CITATION) and phylogenetic trees were generated, bootstrapped 1,000 times, and visualized by Treeview (CITATION). “Exclusions for positions with gaps” and “corrections for multiple sequences” were both set to “off.” The tree was outgrouped with PV42p and SnIP1 groups. Sequences related to SnIP1 correspond to a new group of SNF4-like protein isolated by CITATION. Names of the protein sequences deduced from EST contigs were given arbitrarily in bold, starting with the initials of the organism, “gamma” or “betagamma” for γ- or βγ-subunits, and one number when several sequences were found in the same organism. ESTs accession numbers used for each organism are listed in alphabetical order: Ghgamma1: AI730544, BF274631, AW187178; Gmgamma1: AW507983, AW348746, AI965571, AW350665, BG508480, BG041147, BI315858, BE474422, AI460404, AI495211, BF425409, BE661899, BE802388, AW100253, BE611594, AW755822; Gmgamma2: AW234285, BG726542, BF594973, BG790832, AW832024; Gmbetagamma1: BE329598, AW761384, BG045823, BI471330, AI938551, BF067362; Hvgamma1: BE413386, AL503884, BF620756; Legamma1: AW031797, AW930464, AW030495, AW931734, AW930111, AI896552, AW030567, AW221409, AW934655, BG132919, AW221379, AW616814, BE432801, AW034443, AW033795, AW033948, AW931052, AW931884, AI778239, BE435549, AI896954, BF052148, AW224492, BE441128, AW221367, AW221368, AW221366, BF051899, AI486513, AI485033, BE432466, AW222755, AW930016, BI209432, BI209432, BI207710, BG631518, BE433740; Lebetagamma1: AI896937, BE434764, AW933231, BE434544, AW033267, BG12450; Ljgamma1: AV410347, AV410863, AV412990, AV423982, AV420137, AV426298, AV428789; Mtgamma1: AA660841, AL284884, AL375470, AL375471, AL384885, AL388323, AW560279, AW573932, AW684384, AW685042, AW685140, AW686841, AW689677, AW773651, BE319326, BE942814, BF003163, BF003164, BF646632, BF649373, BG447936, BG589026, BG647811, BI266830; Mtbetagamma1: BG452241, AW774494; Stgamma1: BG590178, BE342824, BE341103, BG600892, BE342642, BG098543, BF890379; Sbgamma1: AW28645, BE363968, BE356406, AW564195, BE356340, BF421349, BE595667, BE563959, BF421265, BG465396, BG463490, BG464559, BG464134, BE594283, BG463409, BE363898, BE5945416; Sbbetagamma1: BG560098, BG241716, BF585763, AW744961, BI140637, BG412843, BG050314, BF481119, AW285543, AW285557, AW565509, AW565523, AW676933, AW745014, BE353014, BE598031, BE598304, BE598571, BE598914, BF421885, BF585679, BG050385, BG560098; Tagamma1: BE403487, BE426463, BG314395; Tabetagamma1: BG907542, BE489373, BI479562, BE415403, BE498573, BG605114, BE492292, BE445860, BG907543, BF293342; and Tabetagamma2: BE416528, BE417856, BE416027, BE417134, BE416979, BE416980.
