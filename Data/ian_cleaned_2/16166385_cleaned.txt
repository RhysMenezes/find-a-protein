!~ABS~! The transition from the juvenile to the mature phase during vegetative development in plants is characterized by changes in leaf shape. We show that GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E6 (GTE6) regulates differences in leaf patterning between juvenile and mature leaves in Arabidopsis. GTE6 encodes a novel small bromodomain-containing protein unique to plants. Mutations in GTE6 disrupt the formation of elliptical leaf laminae in mature leaves, whereas overexpression of GTE6 resulted in elongated juvenile leaves. GTE6 positively regulates the expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1), which encodes a myb-domain protein that controls proximodistal patterning of leaves. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that GTE6 is associated with the promoter and the start of the transcribed region of AS1 and up-regulates expression of AS1 through acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Genetic studies demonstrated that AS1 is epistatic to GTE6, indicating that GTE6 regulates AS1 during leaf morphogenesis. Chromatin remodeling at AS1 is a key regulatory mechanism in leaf development, which ensures the continual production of mature leaves following juvenile-adult transition, thereby maintaining the identity of the mature vegetative phase. 
!~RES~! GTE6 has eight exons and encodes a protein of 369 amino acid residues, with the bromodomain motif spanning residues 116-194 (Fig. 1A). To identify the transcription start site of GTE6, the 5′ end of the GTE6 transcript was examined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), followed by PCR. The transcription start site was mapped to 73 bp upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 1A).  In wild-type Arabidopsis, GTE6 transcripts are most abundant in flowers; low in roots, leaves, and siliques; and undetectable in 5-d-old seedlings (Fig. 1B). In the basal rosette leaves of 21-d-old wild-type plants, GTE6 transcripts are more abundant in leaves 6 and 7, which possess narrow elliptical laminae, than in leaves 1-4, which have round laminae (Fig. 1C,D), suggesting a possible correlation between GTE6 expression and the formation of elliptical leaf laminae in mature leaves.  [[FIGURE]] Differences in GTE6 expression between the juvenile and mature leaves in 21-d-old plants are not likely to be due to differences in leaf age, because GTE6 transcript levels are similar in leaves 1 and 2 at 4-21 d after leaf initiation, suggesting that GTE6 expression does not change during various times of leaf elongation and maturation (Fig. 1E).  To investigate whether GTE6 may control the development of leaf shape, we analyzed mutants from the SALK collection (Alonso et al. 2003) that contained transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertions in the promoter region of the GTE6 gene (Fig. 1A). The effect of the mutations is most obvious in leaves 6 and 7, which have round laminae (Fig. 2A; width/length ratios in Supplementary Fig. S1), rather than the elliptical laminae of leaves 6 and 7 of the wild-type plants (Fig. 1D). The T-DNA insertions resulted in fewer GTE6 transcripts in leaf 7 (Fig. 2B), suggesting misregulation of GTE6 expression. The transcript abundance of GTE6 in leaf 7 of the insertion mutants was similar to leaf 4 of the wild-type and the insertion mutant plants, suggesting that the T-DNA insertions have disrupted the activation of GTE6 expression in the mature leaves (Fig. 2B). Thus, elevated expression of GTE6 in leaves 6 and 7 of wild-type plants is important for the development of the elliptical leaf lamina.  [[FIGURE]] Phase transition during vegetative development is also characterized by changes in trichome distribution (Telfer et al. 1997). In Arabidopsis, juvenile leaves (leaves 1 to 4) have trichomes present only on the adaxial (upper) surface, whereas mature leaves (leaves 5 and above) possess trichomes on both adaxial and abaxial (lower) surfaces (Telfer et al. 1997). Trichome distribution on the rosette leaves of the insertion mutants was similar to that of the wild-type plants (Fig. 2C), indicating that GTE6 does not regulate phase transition per se but is involved in controlling development of mature leaf shapes.  [[FIGURE]] To investigate further the regulation of leaf development by GTE6, we transformed wild-type plants with a 35S::GTE6 construct containing the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter fused to the GTE6 cDNA, resulting in more GTE6 transcripts (Fig. 3A). Elevated GTE6 expression resulted in juvenile leaves showing an elongated and elliptical shape (Fig. 3B; width/length ratios in Supplementary Fig. S1). We also analyzed mutants possessing decreased amounts of GTE6 transcripts, generated using a 35S::RNAiGTE6 construct containing the CaMV 35S promoter linked to two copies of a 524-bp region of the GTE6 cDNA in inverted orientations. Database analysis of this 524-bp sequence did not identify any other Arabidopsis genes containing similar nucleotide sequences of 15 bp or more, suggesting that the 35S::RNAiGTE6 construct was specific for GTE6. Decreased GTE6 transcript levels in the 35S::RNAiGTE6 plants (Fig. 3C) resulted in shorter and broader leaf laminae in mature leaves, as compared with the corresponding leaves in the wild-type plants (Fig. 3D; width/length ratios in Supplementary Fig. S1). Control plants transformed with empty vectors were morphologically similar to wild-type plants, indicating that the phenotype of the leaves of plants containing the 35S::GTE6 and 35S::RNAiGTE6 constructs was not the result of transformation procedures (data not shown). Altered amounts of GTE6 transcripts in the 35S::GTE6 and 35S::RNAiGTE6 plants did not alter the rate of leaf production, the flowering time, or the total number of leaves in the basal rosette, suggesting that the vegetative phase was not affected. These data indicate that GTE6 is involved in the development of the leaf lamina in mature leaves. No change in flower morphology, silique structure, or root length was observed in the mutants.  The proximodistal axis of the leaf is established in part by AS1 in Arabidopsis (Byrne et al. 2000, 2001). Loss-of-function mutations in AS1 led to shorter, broader, and occasionally lobed laminae, whereas overexpression resulted in elongated and elliptical juvenile leaves (Byrne et al. 2000; Theodoris et al. 2003). Because the phenotypes of the GTE6 mutants are similar to the AS1 mutants and GTE6 is likely to regulate leaf shape by regulating the expression of genes involved in leaf development, we investigated AS1 transcript levels in the GTE6 mutants. Elevated GTE6 expression in the 35S::GTE6 plants resulted in more AS1 transcripts (Fig. 4A), whereas decreased expression of GTE6 in the RNAi plants resulted in fewer AS1 transcripts (Fig. 4B). In wild-type plants, AS1 transcripts in leaf 7 were more abundant than in leaf 4 (Fig. 4C), consistent with the observation that GTE6 transcripts were more abundant in leaf 7 than leaf 4 (Fig. 1C). No difference in the amount of AS1 transcripts was observed between leaves 7 and 4 of the T-DNA insertion mutants, suggesting misregulation of AS1 expression in the insertion mutants (Fig. 4C). We also examined the expression of AS2, which genetically interacts with AS1 to regulate leaf patterning in Arabidopsis (Semiarti et al. 2001). The expression of AS2 was not altered in the GTE6 overexpressing mutants (Fig. 4D) or in GTE6 RNAi plants (Fig. 4E). The expression of other genes involved in leaf development, such as AN (Tsuge et al. 1996), CLF (Goodrich et al. 1997), DRL (Nelissen et al. 2003), ROT3 (G.-T. Kim et al. 1999), and TPC2 (Palatnik et al. 2003) was also investigated. However, no change in the transcript levels of these genes was observed in the GTE6 mutants, suggesting that GTE6 is not regulating the expression of these genes (Supplementary Fig. S2).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Although as1 and GTE6 T-DNA insertion mutants have similar altered mature leaf phenotypes, they are different in other aspects of leaf development; e.g., GTE6 T-DNA insertion mutants have flat leaf laminae whereas as1 has curly leaf blades (Fig. 5A,B). Double mutants of as1 and GTE6 T-DNA insertion mutant have curly leaves and are morphologically more similar to as1 than GTE6 mutants, suggesting that AS1 is epistatic to GTE6 (Fig. 5C).  When GTE6 was overexpressed in as1, no change in leaf shape was observed in any of the overexpressing plants, further suggesting that GTE6 regulates leaf development through AS1 (Fig. 5D,E). Wild-type plants overexpressing AS1 have a phenotype similar to 35S::GTE6 plants; i.e., elliptical leaves 3 and 4, implicating both genes in control of mature leaf shape (Fig. 5F,G). These results provide genetic evidence that AS1 acts downstream of GTE6.  The location of the GTE6 protein in the cell was examined using Arabidopsis plants stably transformed with a 35S::GTE6-GFP construct, which expresses a GTE6-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. The GTE6-GFP fusion protein is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with its predicted role as a transcription factor. A nuclear-targeting signal is predicted in the C-terminal region of GTE6 (Fig. 1A).  To investigate whether the expression of AS1 is directly regulated by GTE6, we examined the association of GTE6 with various regions of AS1 with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, using Arabidopsis plants expressing a GTE6-GFP fusion protein. Linking GFP to the C terminus of GTE6 did not abolish the function of the protein, as shown by the phenotypes of wild-type plants transformed with 35S::GTE6-GFP, which were similar to wild-type plants transformed with 35S::GTE6; i.e., elongated and elliptical laminae in leaves 1-4. Figure 6B shows leaf 4 of three independently transformed lines of 35S::GTE6-GFP plants. Furthermore, AS1 transcripts were increased in the 35S::GTE6-GFP plants (Fig. 6C), as well as in the 35S::GTE6 plants (Fig. 4A), indicating that both GTE6-GFP and GTE6 up-regulated the expression of AS1. AS2 transcripts remained unchanged in the 35S::GTE6-GFP plants (Fig. 6C), as in the 35S::GTE6 plants (Fig. 4D).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] ChIP was performed using antibodies to GFP, as described previously (Chua et al. 2001; Gendrel et al. 2001). Coprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR using primer pairs that amplify various regions of AS1 (Fig. 6D). In three independently transformed lines of 35S::GTE6-GFP plants, the GFP antibodies coprecipitated the promoter (region P2), and the 3′ end of the intron and the 5′ end of exon 2 (region P1) of AS1 (Fig. 6E). The GFP antibodies did not coprecipitate regions P3 and P0 of AS1; these sequences were undetected even after forty rounds of PCR. GTE6 thus regulates expression by associating with a 1-kbp region containing the promoter and the start of the transcribed region of AS1, which are likely to be important regulatory regions for transcriptional control (Fig. 6E).  We next examined histone acetylation states at AS1 to investigate whether GTE6 may regulate expression through acetylation of histones. ChIP was performed using leaves 1-4 of wild-type Columbia and 35S::GTE6 plants. Histones H3 associated with the promoter and the transcribed region of AS1 (regions P2, P1, and P0) were more acetylated in leaves 1-4 of the 35S::GTE6 plants, compared with the wild-type plants (Fig. 7A-C). Histone H4 acetylation was also increased at regions P2 and P1 of AS1 in the 35S::GTE6 plants (Fig. 7A,B). Histone H4 acetylation at region P0 of exon 2 was unaltered (Fig. 7C). Elevated GTE6 expression in the 35S::GTE6 plants thus resulted in increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the promoter and the start of the transcribed region of AS1, regions where the GTE6-GFP fusion protein binds (Fig. 6E). No change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the upstream region P3 (-1855 to -1367, with +1 as translation start site) was observed (data not shown).  Histone acetylation at AS1 was examined in leaves 6 and 7 of a T-DNA insertion mutant to determine whether decreased GTE6 expression resulted in decreased histone acetylation. Leaves 6 and 7 were investigated because the shapes of these leaves were most different between the insertion mutant and the wild-type plants (Figs. 1D, 2A). The promoter and the transcribed regions of AS1 (regions P2, P1, and P0) in leaves 6 and 7 of wild-type plants were associated with high histone H3 and H4 acetylation, compared with leaves 1-4 of wild-type (Fig. 7A-F), again correlating increased histone acetylation with mature leaf shape. In leaves 6 and 7 of the insertion mutant, histone H3 acetylation at the promoter and transcribed region of AS1 (regions P2, P1, and P0) was lower than in the wild-type plants (Fig. 7D-F). Histone H4 acetylation at regions P2 and P1 of AS1 was also decreased in the insertion mutant (Fig. 7D,E). Thus, lower GTE6 expression in leaves 6 and 7 of the T-DNA insertion mutant is associated with decreased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at AS1, as compared with wild-type plants. No difference in histone H4 acetylation at region P0 of exon 2 was observed between the insertion mutant and the wild-type plants (Fig. 7F).  Following the complete sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome, GTE6 was annotated as a BET (bromodomain-Extraterminal) gene, because it contains a bromodomain and an Extraterminal (ET) domain, and was classified as a member of the GTE family of transcription factors (Pandey et al. 2002). The function of the ET domain is unknown but has been proposed to be involved in protein-protein interactions (Lygerou et al. 1994; Jeanmougin et al. 1997). The BET class of proteins includes the yeast BDF1 (Lygerou et al. 1994), the Drosophila FSH (Chua and Roeder 1995), and the vertebrate Brd2/Ring3/fsrg2, Brd4/HUNKI/MCAP, and Brd5/BRDT (Houzelstein et al. 2002). However, GTE6 was not among the 11 putative BET proteins proposed for Arabidopsis (Florence and Faller 2001). The C terminus of GTE6 contains only 9 of the 30 residues conserved in the ET domain and lacks the serine-rich motif, known as the SEED motif, that is characteristic of BET proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3; Florence and Faller 2001). The sequences flanking the bromodomain of GTE6 also do not possess similarity to animal and yeast BET proteins. Furthermore, animal and yeast BET proteins contain 2 bromodomains, whereas GTE6 contains a single bromodomain. Thus, GTE6 is not likely to be a plant homolog of the animal BET proteins. Database searches indicate that genes that possess high sequence similarities with GTE6 are present in pea, maize, and rice but not in unicellular organisms and animals, suggesting that this class of genes is unique to plants. 
!~MM~! Seeds of mutant and wild-type Columbia were surface-sterilized and germinated on 1/2 MS agar (0.24% MS salts, 0.8% agar at pH 5.9). The seeds were treated in the dark for 4 d at 4°C and transferred to 25°C under a 24-h cycle of 16 h PAR (150 μmol photons m-2/s) and 8 h dark. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed using 21-d-old plants grown on 1/2 MS agar in tissue culture plates. The T-DNA insertion mutants SALK_111787 and SALK_113361 were obtained from the SALK Institute (Alonso et al. 2003). Seeds of the as1 mutant were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre. Seeds of Columbia containing 35S::AS1 were provided by Michael Freeling (University of California, Berkeley, CA).  The transcription start site of GTE6 was mapped by 5′ RACE using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Inc.), using the method of Shaefer (1995). The primers used for the RACE reactions were GTE6raceR4 and GTE6raceR6 (Supplementary Table S1). The PCR products were sequenced to identify the transcription start site. The 35S::GTE6 construct was generated by inserting the cDNA of GTE6 into the BamHI site of pROK2 (Baulcombe et al. 1986). The 35S::RNAiGTE6 construct was generated using the intermediate vector pJH21, which contains intron 4 of the pea Lip1 gene (Sullivan and Gray 2000) inserted into the SalI-BamHI sites of pBCSK + phagemid (Stratagene). A 524-bp region of GTE6 (+587 to +1100 of GTE6 cDNA, with +1 as the translation start site) was inserted into the BglII-SalI sites of pJH21, and the same sequence, but in the reverse orientation, was inserted into the BamHI-SacI sites. The 524-bp region of GTE6 was obtained by PCR amplification. The DNA fragment containing the two copies of GTE6 separated by the intron was released by digestion with BglII and SacI, and inserted into pROK2. The 35S::GTE6-GFP construct was generated by inserting the cDNA of GTE6 into an intermediate vector pUCGFP (Haseloff et al. 1997), which contained the CaMV 35S promoter sequence, GFP, and the terminator of nos in pUC19. The 35S::GTE6-GFP sequence was excised by digestion with HindIII and EcoRI, and inserted into pROK2. Wild-type Col or as1-1 mutant was transformed with 35S::GTE6, 35S::RNAiGTE6, or 35S::GTE6-GFP with Agrobacterium strain C58C1 using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent 1998).  The double mutant of as1-1 and GTE6 T-DNA insertion mutant (SALK_113361) was generated by pollinating as1 flowers with pollen from SALK_113361. Seeds collected from F1 plants were germinated, and the segregating F2 population was screened for double mutants by PCR using the primers LBB1, GTE6p-F2, GTE6p-F3, GTE6p-R2, AS1-f, and AS1-r (Supplementary Table S1).  Epidermal peels from Arabidopsis leaves were stained with DAPI (10 mg/mL; Roche) for 15 min, washed with water, placed on glass slides, and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica Microsystems) for GFP and DAPI-DNA fluorescence.  RNA was purified using Tripure reagent (Roche), and reverse transcription was performed as previously described (Chua et al. 2004). Semi-quantitative duplex PCR was performed using primers specific for ACT8, AS1, GTE6, AN, CLF, ROT3, AS2, DRL, or TCP2 (Supplementary Table S1). PCR reactions were first performed with various dilutions of the template DNA to ensure that the PCR conditions were within the quantitative range of the amplification reaction. Typically, 28 cycles were used.  ChIP experiments were performed as described previously (Chua et al. 2001; Gendrel et al. 2001). Approximately 0.1-0.8 g leaves (leaves 1-4 or 6 and 7, as described in the figure legends) of 21-d-old Arabidopsis plants grown on 1/2 MS agar in tissue culture plates were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) under vacuum for 15 min. The plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen, and chromatin was extracted. The chromatin was sheared into fragments ranging from 400 bp to 1 kbp by sonication. The sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μL of anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology), 10 μL of anti-acetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), or 5 μL of anti-GFP (Abcam). DNA was amplified using primers specific for 18S rDNA, and various regions of AS1 (Supplementary Table S1). PCR reactions were first performed with various dilutions of the template DNA to ensure that the PCR conditions were within the quantitative range of the amplification reaction. Coprecipitated DNA was dissolved in 20 μL of TE, and typically 1 μL was used for PCR analyses. For total input samples, DNA was extracted from an aliquot of sonicated chromatin, dissolved in 80 μL of TE, and 1 μL was used for PCR. Twenty-eight cycles were used to amplify regions P1, P2, P3, or P0 of AS1, and 20 cycles were used to amplify the 18S rDNA sequence. Regions of AS1 were first amplified using AS1 primers for 8 cycles, followed by the addition of 18S rDNA primers, and the PCR was performed for another 20 cycles.
