!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis thaliana NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES1 (NPR1, also known as NIM1) protein is an essential positive regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-induced PATHOGENESIS-RELATED (PR) gene expression and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). PR gene activity is regulated at the level of redox-dependent nuclear transport of NPR1. NPR1 interacts with members of the TGA family of transcription factors that are known to bind to SA-responsive elements in the PR-1 promoter. In an attempt to identify proteins involved in SA-mediated signal transduction, we previously described the isolation of three novel genes encoding distinct albeit structurally related proteins designated NIMIN1 (for NIM1-INTERACTING1), NIMIN2, and NIMIN3 that interact with NPR1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Here, we show that NIMIN1 and NPR1 can be copurified from plant extracts, providing biochemical evidence for their interaction. We provide functional evidence for this interaction by describing transgenic plants constitutively expressing high amounts of NIMIN1. These plants show reduced SA-mediated PR gene induction and a compromised SAR, thus mimicking the described phenotype conferred by npr1. Moreover, they showed reduced RESISTANCE gene–mediated protection. These effects were dependent on the ability of NIMIN1 to interact with NPR1. Mutant plants with a T-DNA insertion in NIMIN1 as well as transgenic plants with reduced NIMIN1 mRNA levels showed hyperactivation of PR-1 gene expression after SA treatment but no effect on the disease resistance phenotype. Our results strongly suggest that NIMIN1 negatively regulates distinct functions of NPR1, providing a mechanism to modulate specific features of SAR.
!~RES~! In an attempt to identify proteins involved in SA signal transduction, we previously described the isolation of three novel genes encoding distinct albeit structurally related proteins, NIMIN1, NIMIN2, and NIMIN3, that interact with NPR1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. NIMIN2 and NIMIN3 were also shown to bind NPR1 in vitro (CITATION). To analyze whether this interaction occurs in planta, we created transgenic lines expressing NIMIN1 constitutively. To facilitate the detection of NIMIN1, a sequence encoding a c-myc:hexahistidine (His6) tag was added to the C terminus of the protein. Yeast three-hybrid analysis confirmed that the NIMIN1:myc:His6 fusion still forms a ternary complex with NPR1 and TGA factors (data not shown), as described previously (CITATION). The NIMIN1:myc:His6 gene fusion under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated gene transfer into wild-type plants (Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia [Col-0]). Thirty-two transformants were selected and 10 T0 lines were brought to homozygosity (35S:NIMIN1 lines), as inferred from segregation analysis. As shown by the protein gel blot in Figure 1A, NIMIN1:myc:His6 accumulates to high levels in lines 7.2, 9.3, 15.2, 24.3, and 27.3, to intermediate levels in line 17.6, and is hardly detectable in lines 5.1, 5.3, 14.4, and 4.4. The protein migrates at a position corresponding to 24 kD, which is close to its predicted molecular mass of 21 kD. The lines with strong NIMIN1:myc:His6 expression display subtle morphological changes: the petioles tend to be longer and the laminae are a bit shorter than in wild-type plants, but rosette size is similar to that of wild-type plants. They also appear to be earlier flowering than wild-type plants (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] As a control for the in planta interaction assay, we created transgenic lines expressing a NIMIN1 mutant that does not interact with NPR1. In our previous study, we had mapped the NPR1 interaction domain of NIMIN1 to amino acids 49 to 54 (CITATION). To identify crucial residues within the six–amino acid region that are important for the interaction with NPR1, a rational site-directed mutagenesis approach was taken based on a multiple alignment of the region of three NIMIN proteins (NIMIN1, NIMIN1b, and NIMIN2) (CITATION) and G8-1, a NIMIN-like protein from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) (CITATION). Only two consecutive Phe residues are conserved in all four proteins (Phe-49 and Phe-50 in NIMIN1). We have chosen to exchange these large hydrophobic residues by small, slightly polar Ser residues (CITATION) to disrupt the NPR1 interaction domain. The NIMIN1 mutant was designated NIMIN1-2 (Figure 1B). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we confirmed that NIMIN1-2 does not interact with NPR1 (data not shown). To create transgenic lines expressing NIMIN1-2, the cDNA was fused as the wild-type cDNA to a c-myc:His6 tag and was expressed under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Several lines were brought to homozygosity (35S:NIMIN1-2 lines), as inferred from segregation analysis. As shown by the protein gel blot in Figure 1C, NIMIN1-2:myc:His6 accumulates to a high level in line 9.4, to an intermediate level in line 16.5, and is hardly detectable in line 2.5. The subtle growth phenotype of 35S:NIMIN1 lines was also observed with 35S:NIMIN1-2 lines. To test for interaction between NIMIN1 and NPR1 in planta, we crossed 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3 and 35S:NIMIN1-2 line 9.4 to homozygous plants expressing a triple hemagglutinin epitope (HA3)-tagged NPR1 (35S:NPR1) in the npr1-1 background. 35S:NIMIN1-2 line 9.4 was chosen as a control because it exhibits similar levels of transgene expression as 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3 (Figure 1D). The resulting F1 generation was analyzed for complex formation between either NIMIN1 and NPR1 or NIMIN1-2 and NPR1 using coaffinity purification. Because NIMIN1 is localized to the nucleus (CITATION), nuclear localization of NPR1 was induced by SA treatment of F1 plants 8 h before harvesting. Total protein extracts of plants expressing similar levels of either NIMIN1:myc:His6 and HA3:NPR1 or NIMIN1-2:myc:His6 and HA3:NPR1 were prepared and incubated with nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA) as described previously (CITATION). His6-tagged NIMIN1 and NIMIN1-2, together with corresponding interaction partners, were bound to the matrix and were eluted after washing away nonspecific interactors. Protein gel blot analysis confirmed that similar amounts of NIMIN1 and NIMIN1-2, and similar amounts of NPR1, were present in the input extracts of both transgenic lines (Figure 1E, lanes 3 and 4, bottom and top panels), and similar amounts of either NIMIN1 or NIMIN1-2 were purified from these extracts (Figure 1E, lanes 1 and 2, bottom panel). As shown in Figure 1E, NPR1 was copurified with NIMIN1 (lane 1, top panel) but not with NIMIN1-2 (lane 2, top panel). This finding clearly demonstrates that interaction between NIMIN1 and NPR1 occurs in plant extracts and that interaction between NIMIN1-2 and NPR1 is disrupted not only in yeast but also in plant extracts. Next, we addressed the question of whether NIMIN1 has the potential to modulate PR gene expression. Yeast three-hybrid data suggest that NIMIN1 may be involved in PR gene regulation as part of a ternary complex with NPR1 and TGA factors. In vitro experiments failed to show that NPR1 interacts with a TGA factor bound to an activation sequence-1 (as-1)–like cis element of the PR-1 gene promoter (CITATION). To examine whether NPR1 can interact with DNA-bound TGA factors in an in vivo situation and to test whether NIMIN1 may be part of this complex, we used the yeast one-hybrid system to modulate PR gene expression. A yeast strain was created carrying the HIS3 reporter gene driven by a minimal promoter with three tandemly repeated as-1 DNA binding sites. NIMIN1 was fused to the GAL4 transcription activation domain (GAD:NIMIN1) because none of the subunits of the putative complex exhibits transcriptional activation in yeast (R. Weigel, unpublished data). If GAD:NIMIN1 is part of a complex together with NPR1 and as-1–bound TGA factor, the reporter gene is activated and the yeast cells can grow on medium lacking His. As shown in Figure 2A, only in the presence of all three subunits of the ternary complex between TGA2 and TGA6, respectively, NPR1, and GAD:NIMIN1 was reporter gene activation observed and were yeast cells able to grow on medium lacking His (sections 5 and 7). These data demonstrate the interaction between NPR1 and DNA-bound TGA factor together with GAD:NIMIN1 in an in vivo system (Figure 2B). The data indicate that an assembly of the ternary complex on the PR-1 promoter is possible. [[FIGURE]] SA and benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid inducibility of NIMIN1, and the interaction between NIMIN1, NPR1, and TGA factors in yeast, prompted us to test whether the expression of SAR marker genes is altered in 35S:NIMIN1 lines. We examined the expression of PR genes in a time-course experiment 0, 4, 8, and 24 h after SA treatment. As shown by the RNA gel blot in Figure 3A, SA-induced expression of PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 was strongly reduced in lines with high levels of NIMIN1:myc:His6 expression (similar results were obtained with all lines showing NIMIN1:myc:His6 expression presented in Figure 1A). Interestingly, induction of the endogenous NIMIN1 transcript was also repressed. This reduction was not observed in lines with low levels of NIMIN1:myc:His6. To corroborate our findings, we tested whether PR genes are also repressed in 35S:NIMIN1 lines using an independent inducing stimulus. 35S:NIMIN1 lines were challenged with the avirulent bacterial strain Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola ES4326 avrRpt2 (Psm 4326 avrRpt2) (CITATION; CITATION), and PR gene expression was examined 0, 8, 12, and 24 h after infection. As shown in Figure 3B, Psm 4326 avrRpt2–induced expression of SAR genes was reduced in lines with high levels of NIMIN1:myc:His6, whereas PR-2 and PR-5 were less strongly repressed than PR-1. Again, induction of the endogenous NIMIN1 transcript was also repressed. In lines with low levels of NIMIN1:myc:His6, PR genes were induced comparably with the wild type. These results indicate that NIMIN1 may be a negative regulator of PR gene expression. [[FIGURE]] To test whether PR gene repression is contingent on the ability of NIMIN1 to interact with NPR1, we investigated PR gene expression in 35S:NIMIN1-2 lines in a time-course experiment 0, 4, 8, and 24 h after SA treatment. As shown by RNA gel blot analysis in Figure 3C, PR gene expression in 35S:NIMIN1-2 plants did not differ from that in wild-type plants, although NIMIN1-2 was as highly expressed as NIMIN1 (Figure 1D). Induction of the endogenous NIMIN1 transcript also was not affected. This result shows that PR gene and NIMIN1 repression in 35S:NIMIN1 lines depends on the ability of NIMIN1 to interact with NPR1. Constitutive expression of NIMIN1:myc:His6 in the wild-type background may antagonize NPR1 activity and lead to a phenotype like that conferred by npr1. To investigate whether 35S:NIMIN1 lines have additional npr1-like characteristics, we tested whether the loss of SA-induced PR gene expression would coincide with impaired SAR-mediated protection against infection with a virulent pathogen. Two-week-old plants (35S:NIMIN1 lines 9.3 and 27.3, npr1-1, and Col-0) were inoculated with P. syringae pv maculicola ES4326 (Psm 4326; OD600 = 0.2) (CITATION; CITATION) with or without pretreatment with 1 mM SA or were mock inoculated (Figure 4A). Without pretreatment with SA, all plant lines tested were infected by the virulent bacterial strain and showed severe disease symptoms. Pretreatment with SA protected wild-type plants as a result of the establishment of SAR. In npr1-1 plants, however, SAR was abolished. They showed strong disease symptoms when infected with a virulent bacterial strain even after SAR-inducing treatment. Similarly, 35S:NIMIN1 lines 9.4 and 27.3 showed strong disease symptoms after SA pretreatment, indicating that the repression of SA-inducible PR gene expression coincides with an impaired SAR response. This is a second common feature of 35S:NIMIN1 lines and npr1 mutants. To confirm that the macroscopic disease symptoms reflect the bacterial growth inside the plant, we measured the bacterial titer in SA-pretreated wild-type, 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3, and npr1-1 plants at 0 and 3 d after infection (DAI). In wild-type plants, the Psm 4326 titer increased only ∼10-fold after 3 DAI. By contrast, 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3 showed an increase of approximately three orders of magnitude, similar to the situation in npr1-1 plants. This is in accordance with the observed macroscopic disease symptoms and with published data (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To examine whether 35S:NIMIN1 lines are impaired not only in SAR but also in R gene–mediated resistance, we infected 35S:NIMIN1 lines 5.1, 27.3, and 9.3 with the Psm 4326 avrRpt2 (CITATION; CITATION). To observe macroscopic symptoms, plants were dipped in a bacterial suspension (OD600 = 0.2) and the progress of infection was followed over 5 d. Wild-type and npr1-1 plants hardly showed any macroscopic signs of infection, as depicted in Figure 5A. 35S:NIMIN1 line 5.1 expressing low levels of NIMIN1:myc:His6 behaved like a wild-type plant. The Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae2 gene confers resistance against Psm avrRpt2 in these lines. By contrast, 35S:NIMIN1 lines 27.3 and 9.3, with high NIMIN1:myc:His6 expression, showed a significant number of necrotic leaves compared with wild-type plants, indicating a higher susceptibility even to an avirulent bacterial pathogen. To confirm that the macroscopic disease symptoms reflect the bacterial growth inside the plant, we measured the bacterial growth in wild-type, 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3, and npr1-1 plants at 0 and 3 DAI. As shown in Figure 5B, wild-type and npr1-1 plants did not support the growth of Psm 4326 avrRpt2, as described in the literature (CITATION; CITATION). The bacterial titer increased only ∼10-fold. By contrast, 35S:NIMIN1 27.3 plants were less well protected. At 3 DAI, these plants showed an ∼85-fold higher bacterial titer compared with wild-type plants. These results are in accordance with the observed macroscopic disease symptoms and indicate that overexpression of NIMIN1:myc:His6 also affects R gene–mediated resistance and does not merely lead to a npr1 phenocopy. [[FIGURE]] To test whether enhanced susceptibility in 35S:NIMIN1 lines is contingent on the ability of NIMIN1 to interact with NPR1, we investigated the susceptibility of 35S:NIMIN1-2 line 9.4 to Psm 4326 avrRpt2 compared with wild-type plants and 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3. Bacterial growth was measured in a titration experiment at 0 and 3 DAI. The data in Figure 5C show that 35S:NIMIN1-2 line 9.4 was as well protected against the avirulent Psm 4326 strain as the wild-type plants. In both lines, bacterial titers increased ∼10-fold at 3 DAI. These results strongly suggest that PR gene repression and enhanced susceptibility in 35S:NIMIN1 lines are attributable to the specific interaction between endogenous NPR1 and transgenic NIMIN1 and not to interference of NIMIN1 with a yet unknown factor. Using a complementary approach to verify that NIMIN1 is a negative regulator of NPR1 activity, a T-DNA insertion line for NIMIN1, designated nimin1-1 (SALK_086460), was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (Nottingham, UK). The exact position of the T-DNA insertion was determined by PCR and subsequent sequencing of the T-DNA flanking regions. The T-DNA insertion is 4 bp upstream of the start ATG, as depicted schematically in Figure 6A. Based on PCR and segregation analyses, we obtained progeny homozygous for the T-DNA insertion (nimin1-1 lines 2 and 7). RNA gel blot analysis revealed that the nimin1-1 mutant is a real knockout, because no NIMIN1 mRNA was detected after SA treatment, even after extensive exposure of the RNA gel blot, whereas in wild-type plants the transcript had already accumulated strongly at 3 h after SA treatment (Figure 6B). To examine PR-1 mRNA accumulation in nimin1-1 knockout lines, the same blot was incubated with a PR-1 probe. As shown in Figure 6B, PR-1 mRNA accumulation was stronger in nimin1-1 lines than in wild-type plants. Quantification of the signals shown in Figure 6B revealed that the difference in PR-1 signal strength was strongest at 12 h after SA induction (Figure 6C). Compared with Col-0 plants, nimin1-1 line 2 showed a 2.5-fold increase and nimin1-1 line 7 showed a 3.3-fold increase in PR-1 mRNA levels at 12 h after SA induction. Stronger PR-1 induction in nimin1-1 lines was reproducible in several experiments with RNAs from independently grown and induced plants. In a time-course experiment with plants harvested at later time points, differences were still present at 24 h after SA induction but were no longer observed after 36 or 48 h (data not shown), indicating that the amplitude but not the shutting down of PR-1 gene expression is affected in nimin1-1. Basal PR-1 expression was not notably different in nimin1-1 lines compared with wild-type plants. [[FIGURE]] To verify that the mutant phenotype is specifically attributed to the T-DNA insertion in NIMIN1 and not to unrelated T-DNA insertions or point mutations that are known to be generated as part of the transformation process (CITATION), we generated dsRNAi transgenic lines to silence the NIMIN1 gene. A second NIMIN1 T-DNA insertion line was not available from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. First, we tested NIMIN1 mRNA levels in NIMIN1 dsRNAi lines compared with wild-type and nimin1-1 lines at 8 h after SA induction (all plant lines were grown and treated in parallel). RNA gel blot analysis revealed that NIMIN1 expression was strongly reduced in 63 of 74 individuals of nine independent NIMIN1 dsRNAi lines. Figure 6D shows representative results for two individuals of two independent T2 lines. Next, PR-1 gene expression was tested using the same blots. Compared with the wild type, PR-1 mRNA levels were higher in NIMIN1 dsRNAi lines and similar to the level of a nimin1-1 line (Figure 6D). These results strongly support the hypothesis that NIMIN1 counteracts NPR1 activity and modulates PR gene expression. To test whether stronger PR-1 gene expression in nimin1-1 plants coincides with enhanced resistance against a bacterial pathogen, the mutant was subjected to infection with both Psm 4326 avrRpt2 and Psm 4326 with and without SAR-inducing treatment. Using our experimental setup, no significant changes in the defense responses of nimin1-1 plants were observed (data not shown), indicating that hyperactivation of PR-1 gene expression does not coincide with enhanced resistance.
!~MM~! To generate constructs for expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, NIMIN1 was cloned as a BamHI fragment into the BglII-cleaved vector pTrcHis2c (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), creating an in frame fusion with a c-myc and the His6 epitope tag. The NIMIN1:myc:His6 sequence was cut out as a BamHI/PmeI fragment and ligated to BamHI/SmaI-cut pUC19. NIMIN1:myc:His6 was then cut out as a BamHI/SacI fragment and cloned into the BamHI/SacI-cut vector pUC19/35S:β-glucuronidase (CITATION), resulting in the plasmid pUC19/35S:NIMIN1:myc:His6. From there, the 35S:NIMIN1:myc:His6 cassette was cloned as an EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI-opened vector pBIN19/35S:β-glucuronidase, resulting in the plasmid pBIN19/35S:NIMIN1:myc:His6. To create the NIMIN1-2 allele, the N terminus of NIMIN1 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides pUC19bck (5′-TGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGA-3′) and N1-M1 (5′-GGAAGCTTAGAGGACGTATCAATCTTC-3′) and pUC19/NIMIN1:myc:His6 as a template. Amplification with N1-M1 results in a DNA fragment coding for two amino acid exchanges (F49S and F50S) in the NPR1 interaction domain of NIMIN1 (CITATION). The amplified PCR fragment was cut with HindIII and then cloned into the HindIII-cut vector pUC19/NIMIN1:myc:His6. pBIN19/35S:NIMIN1-2:myc:His6 was cloned as described for pBIN19/35S:NIMIN1:myc:His6. To create a binary vector for the expression of a tagged version of NPR1 under the control of the 35S promoter, Gateway technology (Invitrogen) was used. The full-length cDNA of NPR1 was amplified using primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCATGGACACCACCATTGATGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTCACCGACGACGATGAGAGAG-3′. The generated PCR product was recombined into pDONR207 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pDONR207/NPR1 was further recombined into pAlligator2 (CITATION). To generate NIMIN1 dsRNAi lines, the coding sequence was amplified using primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTATATGTATCCTAAACAATTTAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCAATGCAAGATTAAGATC-3′. The amplification product was recombined into the donor vector pDONR207 using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). A second recombination step with a Gateway-compatible derivative of pFGC5491 (CITATION) yielded the binary construct pFGC5941/NIMIN1, containing a chalcone synthase intron designed to produce double-stranded RNA in plants. NIMIN1 was recombined upstream and downstream of the chalcone synthase intron in both the antisense and sense orientations. All DNA constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. To create the 3× as-1 yeast reporter gene construct, two complementary oligonucleotides [5′-AATTC(TGACGTAAGGGATGACGCATTACC)3T-3′ and 5′-CTAGA(GGTAATGCGTCATCCCTTACGTCA)3G-3′] were aligned, creating EcoRI-compatible ends at the 5′ end and XbaI-compatible ends at the 3′ end. The resulting double-stranded DNA fragment was cloned into the plasmid pHISi-1 (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). Integration, selection, and analysis of the resulting yeast strain yTSH1 (a derivative of YM4271) were performed as described by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). To express the TGA factors in yeast, their corresponding cDNAs were cloned as BamHI fragments into the BglII site of a modified pBridge plasmid (CITATION), resulting in the plasmids pGBD-/TGA2 and pGBD-/TGA6, respectively (TRP1-selectable marker). To express NPR1 in yeast, the Met-25 expression cassette of pGBD-/NPR1 (CITATION) was cloned as a StuI fragment into the PvuII-cleaved pGAD424 plasmid (BD Bioscience), resulting in the plasmid pGAD-/NPR1 (LEU2-selectable marker). The GAD:NIMIN1 fusion was cloned as described in CITATION for the GAL4BD fusion, resulting in the plasmid pGAD424/NIMIN1. To express the fusion in yeast under the control of the CUP1 promoter, pGAD424/NIMIN1 was partially digested with HindIII. The appropriate fragment was cloned into the HindIII-cleaved pCU426 plasmid (CITATION), resulting in the plasmid pCU426/GAD:NIMIN1 (URA3-selectable marker). Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Col-0) were grown in soil under controlled environmental conditions (21/19°C, 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle, and 60% relative humidity unless stated otherwise). All seeds were vernalized at 4°C for 2 d before placement in a growth environment. For pathogen infection, 10 to 20 plants were grown on the mesh of Jiffy-7 peat pots. To maintain high humidity, plant trays were covered with a lid throughout the entire growth period. Binary plasmids were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90). The resulting agrobacteria were used to transform Col-0 plants using a floral dipping method (CITATION). Transgenic plants containing pBIN19 constructs were selected on MS agar plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. To generate homozygous transgenic lines, T0 plants were selfed and the progeny of T1 plants were analyzed on MS plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. If 100% of 50 to 100 T2 seedlings were resistant to kanamycin, the T1 mother plant was scored as homozygous. To generate plants expressing HA3:NPR1 under the control of the 35S promoter, npr1-1 plants were transformed with pAlligator/NPR1. Transgenic seeds containing pAlligator/NPR1 were selected using the seed-specific green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. If all of the seeds of a T1 silique were GFP-positive, the plant was scored as homozygous. To create plants expressing HA3:NPR1 and NIMIN1:myc:His6 or NIMIN1-2:myc:His6, 35S:NIMIN1 line 27.3 or 35S:NIMIN1-2 line 9.4, respectively, was crossed with a 35S:NPR1 line (pollen donor). GFP-positive F1 seed was used to grow plants for the coaffinity purification experiment. Transgenic plants containing pFGC5941/NIMIN1 constructs were selected by spraying a solution of Basta (glufosinate) herbicide according to the manufacturer's instructions (AgrEvo, Duesseldorf, Germany). Total denaturing protein extracts were made from Arabidopsis plants by grinding plants in liquid nitrogen and adding two volumes of denaturing urea buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris-Cl, and 8 M urea, pH 8.0). The extracts were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 16,000g at 4°C. Extracts contained equal amounts of proteins, as confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 staining of a protein gel. His6-tagged proteins were enriched by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extracts were separated and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to CITATION. Subsequently, the blots were probed with an antibody against the c-myc tag (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) and the HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), according to each manufacturer's conditions. The antibody-bound proteins were detected using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Native protein extracts were prepared as described by CITATION. Copurification of NPR1 and NIMIN1 was done essentially as described by CITATION. The procedure was scaled down by a factor of 10. The yeast assay for DNA binding of the ternary complex between NIMIN1, NPR1, and TGA factor was performed essentially as described by CITATION. Total RNA was extracted from 3-week-old plants, and 10 μg of each sample was used for RNA gel blot analysis as described previously (CITATION). Each time-course experiment was done in duplicate. Blots were stripped and reprobed two to three times. Fragments used to generate probes specific to PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, ACTIN2, and NIMIN1 were amplified by PCR using primer combinations as described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). RNA gel blot analysis was performed as described (CITATION). To generate macroscopic symptoms, 3-week-old plants of each genotype were used in three different treatments: one group was sprayed with 1 mM SA at 2 and 1 d before dipping in a bacterial suspension of Psm 4326 (OD600 = 0.2; in 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.01% Silwett L-77; Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX). The second group was dipped in bacterial suspension without pretreatment with SA, and the third group was dipped in 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.01% Silwett L-77. Plants were photographed at 4 DAI. To assay the growth of bacteria in the plants, a combination of two methods was used (CITATION; CITATION). Plants were sprayed with 1 mM SA at 2 and 1 d before dipping in a bacterial suspension of Psm 4326 (OD600 = 0.002; in 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.01% Silwett L-77). One hour after inoculation, the samples for day 0 were taken. Nine leaves were excised per genotype, and leaf discs were made from these samples using a hole puncher. Three sets of three discs per genotype were added to a preweighed 2-mL tube containing 1 mL of 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.2% Silwett L-77. The tubes were then shaken on a vortex mixer set to 4 at room temperature for 10 min. After this time, 10 and 20 μL of each tube was spread onto a Petri dish of King's B medium (CITATION) containing the appropriate antibiotics. For day 3, 12 leaves were excised per genotype and four sets of three leaf discs were used for the extraction of bacteria as described above. Extract (100 μL) was added to a microwell plate, and serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared using a multichannel pipette. The bacteria were spotted in 5-μL samples onto a 150-mm Petri plate of King's B medium containing the appropriate antibiotics using a multichannel pipette. Each plate was replicated once. The plates were incubated for 2 d at 28°C. Dilutions that gave 1 to 60 colonies were counted. Each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Infection with Psm 4326 avrRpt2 was done essentially as described above but without pretreatment with 1 mM SA. A mutant carrying a T-DNA insertion in the NIMIN1 gene was identified in an insertional mutant population (ecotype Col-0) (CITATION). Genomic DNAs were isolated using the method described by CITATION. The T-DNA insertion event in NIMIN1 was confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the right and left border PCR products. Homozygous mutant plants for nimin1-1 were identified by segregation analysis using the resistance marker kanamycin and RNA gel blot analysis. PCR analysis of plants carrying a homozygous insertion consistently yielded a single band using the combination of gene-specific and T-DNA border primers; however, as a result of the large insert size, no band was found using the two gene-specific primers.
