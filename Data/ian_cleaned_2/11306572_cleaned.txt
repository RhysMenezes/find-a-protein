!~ABS~! The chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) consists of an evolutionarily conserved 54-kDa subunit (cpSRP54) and a dimer of a unique 43-kDa subunit (cpSRP43). cpSRP binds light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins (LHCPs) to form a cpSRP/LHCP transit complex, which targets LHCP to the thylakoid membrane. Previous studies showed that transit complex formation is mediated through the binding of the L18 domain of LHCP to cpSRP43. cpSRP43 is characterized by a four-ankyrin repeat domain at the N terminus and two chromodomains at the C terminus. In the present study we used the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays to analyze the function of different domains of cpSRP43 in protein complex formation. We report here that the first ankyrin repeat binds to the 18-amino acid domain on LHCP that binds to cpSRP43, whereas the third and fourth ankyrin repeats are involved in the dimerization of cpSRP43. We show further that the interaction of cpSRP43 with cpSRP54 is mediated via binding of the methionine-rich domain of cpSRP54 to the C-terminally located chromodomains of cpSRP43. Both chromodomains contain essential elements for binding cpSRP54, indicating that the closely spaced chromodomains together create a single binding site for cpSRP54. In addition, our data demonstrate that the interaction of cpSRP54 with the chromodomains of cpSRP43 is enhanced indirectly by the dimerization motif of cpSRP43. 
!~RES~! In a previous study, it was demonstrated that cpSRP43 occurs as a homodimer (CITATION). This result was based on the observation that cpSRP43, from the stroma of an Arabidopsis mutant that lacks cpSRP54 (ffc1–2), elutes from a gel filtration column at 70 kDa, which is twice the predicted monomer molecular mass. In addition, homodimerization of cpSRP43 was shown by cross-linking experiments with highly purified recombinant cpSRP43 (CITATION). Sequence analysis of cpSRP43 has shown that the protein contains four ankyrin repeats at the N terminus and two chromodomains at the C terminus (CITATION). A schematic presentation of the exact location of these sequence motifs is shown in Fig. 1. To determine which domains of cpSRP43 mediate its dimerization, we cloned the mature protein and various deletion constructs (Fig.2) into the bait plasmid pAS2 and the prey plasmid pACT2. Yeast cells were cotransformed with the indicated plasmid combinations. The ability of the cotransformed yeast cells to grow on medium lacking histidine (−His) and to express β-galactosidase indicates an interaction of the tested proteins. Table II shows that bait cpSRP43 interacts with prey cpSRP43, confirming our previous conclusion that cpSRP43 forms a homodimer (CITATION). As a first step toward analyzing which domain of cpSRP43 mediates dimerization, the interaction between mature cpSRP43 and the ankyrin repeat-containing N-terminal part of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43A-(61–258)) versus the chromodomains-containing C-terminal part of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43C-(259–376)) was tested. Table II shows that mature cpSRP43 interacts with cpSRP43A-(61–258) but not with cpSRP43C-(259–376). The notion that the self-dimerization of cpSRP43 is mediated via the ankyrin repeat domain was further confirmed by the observation that bait and prey cpSRP43A-(61–258) interact but that no interaction was seen between the two cpSRP43C-(259–376) constructs.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]] To define more clearly the region of the ankyrin repeat domain involved in dimerization, a series of truncations of cpSRP43, removing the N-terminal region outside the ankyrin repeats (cpSRP43-(125–376)), followed by successive removal of three ankyrin repeats (cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), and cpSRP43-(223–376)), was constructed (Fig. 2). Table II shows that mature cpSRP43 and cpSRP43-(125–376) both dimerized with cpSRP43-(125–376), cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), and cpSRP43-(223–376) without any obvious loss of interaction strength. These data suggest that the fourth ankyrin repeat by itself is sufficient to mediate dimerization. This result was corroborated by the finding that cpSRP43-(223–376) interacts strongly with its corresponding prey construct. The third ankyrin repeat is also capable of mediating dimerization as evidenced by the strong interaction of cpSRP43-(61–227), lacking the fourth ankyrin repeat, with cpSRP43 (Table II). When the third ankyrin repeat is also removed (cpSRP43-(61–193)), dimerization is essentially abolished. No binding was detected between cpSRP43 and cpSRP43-(61–159) containing the first ankyrin repeat only. These data together with the results from Table II indicate that the third and fourth ankyrin repeats each are capable of mediating the dimerization of cpSRP43.  Like cytoplasmic SRP54, chloroplast SRP54 is also composed of an N-terminal G domain (residues 76–370) and a C-terminal M domain (residues 371–564). To analyze which domain of cpSRP54 mediates binding to cpSRP43, mature cpSRP54 and its G and M domain were cloned in pAS2, and the interaction with cpSRP43 as prey was tested. The results show that cpSRP54 interacts strongly with cpSRP43 in the yeast two-hybrid system and that the same strength of interaction is obtained between the M domain of cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 (TableIII). No binding was observed between the G domain of cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. These data show clearly that the interaction between cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 is mediated via the M domain of cpSRP54.  [[TABLE]] To characterize the binding site of cpSRP43 for cpSRP54, we tested the binding of cpSRP54 to a series of N-terminal deletion constructs of cpSRP43. No obvious change in binding intensity was observed between cpSRP54 and mature cpSRP43, cpSRP43-(125–376), cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), or cpSRP43-(223–376) (TableIV). A pronounced lesser, but still significant, binding was detected between cpSRP54 and the chromodomains-containing C-terminal part of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43C-(259–376)) (Table IV). If the loss of binding activity between cpSRP54 and cpSRP43C-(259–376) versus cpSRP54 and cpSRP43-(223–376) is caused by a direct interaction of cpSRP54 with the fourth ankyrin repeat, we reasoned that cpSRP54 should interact with the ankyrin repeat-containing N-terminal part of cpSRP43. However, binding of cpSRP54 to cpSRP43A-(61–258) or even cpSRP43-(61–305) was not observed. Together with the above-mentioned observation that cpSRP43-(223–376) forms a dimer (Table II), these binding data indicate that cpSRP54 binds cpSRP43 via the chromodomains and suggest that binding is promoted by the dimerization of cpSRP43. Alternatively, the dimerization motif of cpSRP43 may stabilize or enhance cpSRP54 binding independently of dimerization.  [[TABLE]] To define the binding site of cpSRP43 for cpSRP54 in more detail, N- and C-terminal truncations of cpSRP43C-(259–376) were constructed, and the interaction with cpSRP54 was tested. Removal of amino acids 259–282 (cpSRP43-(283–376)), containing the first conserved region of the first chromodomain, completely abolished binding to cpSRP54 (TableIV). The C-terminal deletion of amino acid 351–376 (cpSRP43-(259–350)) had no effect on cpSRP54 binding, but additional removal of the second strongly conserved region of the second chromodomain (cpSRP43-(259–339)) resulted in a complete loss of binding activity. These data demonstrate clearly that both chromodomains contain essential elements for binding cpSRP54.  Recent studies have shown that the L18 domain, a hydrophilic region located between the second and third transmembrane domain of LHCP (Fig. 2), can efficiently bind cpSRP43 (CITATION, CITATION). We observed a strong interaction between a 33-amino acid-long region containing L18 (LHCP-(189–222)) and cpSRP43 by using the yeast two-hybrid assay (Table V). Further binding tests showed that LHCP-(189–222) interacts with the ankyrin repeat-containing region of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43A-(61–258)), but no binding was detected between LHCP-(189–222) and the C-terminal chromodomains-containing domain of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43C-(259–376)) (TableV). To map the binding site of cpSRP43A-(61–258) for LHCP-(189–222) more precisely, we tested the interaction of LHCP-(189–222) with the indicated N-terminal deletion constructs of cpSRP43 (Table V). LHCP-(189–222) binds cpSRP43-(125–376) with the same efficiency as cpSRP43, indicating that the N-terminal region outside the ankyrin repeat domain is not involved in binding (Table V). No binding was detected between LHCP-(189–222) and the constructs cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), and cpSRP43-(223–376) (TableV). These data suggest that the first ankyrin domain mediates binding to LHCP-(189–222). This assumption was confirmed by the observation that LHCP-(189–222) interacts with the cpSRP43-(61–159) containing the extreme N terminus and the first ankyrin repeat only. This interaction was weaker than the interaction with the complete ankyrin repeat domain. However, the differences in binding strength were not distinctive enough to decide clearly whether LHCP binding needs a dimeric state of cpSRP43.  [[TABLE]] We next sought to confirm the binding properties of the minimal identified interaction domains characterized by the yeast two-hybrid system by in vitrofusion protein binding assays. First, we verified that the region of cpSRP43 containing the third and fourth ankyrin repeat (cpSRP43-(190–258)) is able to form homodimers. To test this notion we cotranslated a GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) fusion protein together with cpSRP43-(190–258) and checked whether cpSRP-(190–258) is co-precipitated in a pull-down assay using glutathione-Sepharose. Control samples contained a cotranslation of GST and cpSRP43-(190–258) and a single translation of GST-cpSRP43-(190–258). Results of the binding reaction show that cpSRP43-(190–258) is specifically co-precipitated by GST-cpSRP-(190–258) and not by the unfused GST protein (Fig. 3 A). The sample containing the precipitation of GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) by itself did not contain a radiolabeled protein of the size of cpSRP43-(190–258). Therefore it can be ruled out that the radiolabeled protein in the co-precipitation of GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) and cpSRP43-(190–258) is generated by the degradation of GST-cpSRP43-(190–258).  [[FIGURE]] Second, we wanted to confirm that the interaction of cpSRP54 with cpSRP43 is mediated via binding of the M domain of cpSRP54 (cpSRP54-(371–564)) to cpSRP43-(259–350). To test that, in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43-(259–350), GST-cpSRP43, or GST were incubated with radiolabeled in vitro translated cpSRP54-(371–564), and binding was analyzed using a pull-down assay. Fig. 3 B shows that cpSRP54-(371–564) is specifically co-precipitated by GST-cpSRP43 and GST-cpSRP43-(259–350) and not by the unfused GST protein. The binding of cpSRP54-(371–564) to GST-cpSRP43-(259–350) is significantly weaker than the binding to full-length GST-cpSRP43, reflecting very well the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system.  Third, we confirmed that the first ankyrin domain of cpSRP43 binds to the L18 domain of LHCP. In vitro translated GST-cpSRP43-(61–159), GST-cpSRP43, or GST was incubated with radiolabeled in vitro translated LHCP-(189–206). Fig.3 C shows that LHCP-(189–206) binds to GST-cpSRP43-(61–159), supporting the result obtained by the yeast two-hybrid system. As in the in vivo system, this interaction was slightly weaker than the binding to the full-length GST-cpSRP43. 
!~MM~! Plasmid pAS2 (CLONTECH) was used to construct the bait plasmids encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain hybrid protein. Plasmid pACT2 (CLONTECH) was used to construct the prey plasmids encoding the Gal4 activation domain hybrid protein. All constructs encode an additional hemagglutinin epitope tag. All cDNAs encoding the L33 domain of LHCP (LHCP-(189–222)), the mature form or truncations of cpSRP43 and cpSRP54, were obtained by PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) orPwo polymerase (Peqlab) using the plasmids pAB80 (CITATION), pSPUTKGSTchaos (CITATION), and pAF1 (CITATION) as templates. The cDNA coding for mature cpSRP43 (residues 61–376) was obtained by using primers 3 and 17 (Table I). Coding sequences for the truncations of cpSRP43 were constructed by using the primer combinations: 3/18 to yield cpSRP43-(61–258), 4/17 to yield cpSRP43-(259–376), 5/17 to yield cpSRP43-(125–376), 6/17 to yield cpSRP43-(156–376), 7/17 to yield cpSRP43-(190–376), 8/17 to yield cpSRP43-(223–376), 3/20 to yield cpSRP43-(61–227), 3/21 to yield cpSRP43-(61–193), 3/22 to yield cpSRP43-(61–159), 9/17 to yield cpSRP43-(283–376), 10/17 to yield cpSRP43-(296–376), 4/25 to yield cpSRP43-(259–350), 4/24 to yield cpSRP43-(259–339), and 4/23 to yield cpSRP43-(259–320) (Table I).  [[TABLE]] The cDNA encoding mature cpSRP54 (residues 76–564), the G domain (residues 76–370), and M domain (residues 371–564) of cpSRP54 were obtained by using the primer combinations 1/15, 1/16, and 2/15, respectively. For the amplification of a 33-amino acid-long region of LHCP (residues 189–222) containing the L18 segment (CITATION), primers 11 and 19 were used. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI or PagI and BamHI and cloned into the NcoI-BamHI site of pAS2 or pACT2. For each construct, the correct insert orientation and reading frame were confirmed by sequencing.  Yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the indicated combinations of the pAS2 and pACT2 constructs according to Ref. CITATION. One half of the cells was plated on synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, and the other half was plated on synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (−Leu/−Trp/−His) and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Yeast cells were incubated for 6 days. Activation of the −his/lacZ reporter was scored by measuring the growth and assessing the β-galactosidase activity by using the filter-lift assay (CITATION). Growth was classified in (+++), (++), (+), and (−), where (+++) means that most colonies have a diameter of >1.5 mm and (−) indicates normal background growth (white-ish colonies <0.6 mm). The filter lifts were incubated for at least 1.5 h to develop a blue color ((+++), strong blue color; (++), medium blue color; (+), slight blue color; (−), no blue color development). As a positive control we cotransformed yeast cells with the control vectors pVA3 and pTD1 (CLONTECH). These cells showed strong growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His medium and developed a strong blue color after a 1.5-h incubation. As negative controls, each protein hybrid construct was cotransformed with either pAS2 or pACT2. Yeast cells cotransformed with pAS2 and the constructs cloned into pACT2 showed only background growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His plates and had no β-galactosidase activity even after 24 h of color development. Constructs encoding either deletions of cpSRP43 or mature cpSRP43 and cloned into pAS2 showed slight self-activation of the −his reporter, which led to some cell growth (+) on −Leu/−Trp/−His medium. However, all of these yeast clones showed no blue color development after 1.5 h. Yeast cells cotransformed with pACT2 and the pAS2 constructs encoding mature or deletions of cpSRP54 showed only background growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His plates and had no β-galactosidase activity even after 24 h of color development. LHCP-(189–222) cloned into pAS2 showed strong self-activation of the −his-lacZ reporter, such that only the pACT2 version of this construct was used. For fusion proteins that showed only weak or no interaction in the yeast two-hybrid experiments, an expression level comparable with full-length cpSRP43 or cpSRP54 was verified by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the hemagglutinin tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All experiments were performed at least in duplicate.  The cDNAs coding for cpSRP43-(190–258), cpSRP43-(259–350), cpSRP43-(61–159), and the M domain of cpSRP54 (residues 371–564) were obtained by PCR amplification as described above. Primer combinations 12/26 and 7/27 were used to yield cpSRP43-(190–258)/1 and cpSRP43-(190–258)/2, 13/28 to yield cpSRP43-(259–350), 14/29 to yield cpSRP43-(61–159), and 2/30 to yield cpSRP54-(371–564) (Table I). The reverse primer for the amplification of cpSRP43-(190–258)/2 was designed to introduce two additional methionine residues at the C terminus. The PCR products encoding cpSRP43-(190–258)/1, cpSRP43(259–350), and cpSRP43-(61–159) were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and ClaI and cloned into the vector fragment from the in vitro translation vector pSPUTK-GST-chaos (CITATION) digested withBamHI-ClaI. The resulting constructs encode cpSRP43-(190–258), cpSRP43-(259–350), and cpSRP43-(61–159) as GST fusion proteins. The in vitro translation vector pSPUTK-GST was created by a blunt-end ligation of the vector fragment from pSPUTK-GST-chaos (CITATION) digested with BamHI-ClaI followed by a fill-in reaction by Klenow.  The PCR products encoding cpSRP43-(190–258)/2 and cpSRP54-(371–564) were digested with NcoI and HindIII and cloned into the NcoI-HindIII site of the in vitro translation vector pGem4SS6.5Nco1 (CITATION). For each construct the correct insert orientation and reading frame were confirmed by sequencing. The translation vector encoding the L18 domain of LHCP (LHCP-(189–206)) as a preprolactin fusion was described by DeLilleet al. (CITATION).  To test if GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) dimerizes with cpSRP43-(190–258), both proteins were cotranslated in a wheat germ extract (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Control samples included a cotranslation of GST with cpSRP43-(190–258) and single translations of GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) and cpSRP43 (190). 50 μl of the two cotranslation reactions and 25 μl of in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) were diluted into an incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm KOAc, and 10 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 120 μl. The precipitation of the GST fusion proteins with glutathione-Sepharose was done as described by Tu et al. (CITATION). The eluted samples were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager.  Radiolabeled in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43, GST-cpSRP43-(259–350), GST-cpSRP43-(61–159), and GST were separated on a 13% acrylamide gel, and radioactivity was quantitated by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager. Equal picomoles of in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43, GST-cpSRP43-(259–350), GST-cpSRP43-(61–159), and GST were incubated with 20 μl of radiolabeled in vitro translated cpSRP54-(371–564) or LHCP-(189–206) as indicated. All binding reactions contained equal amounts of wheat germ extract. The proteins were diluted into an incubation buffer as described above, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The precipitation of the GST fusion proteins with glutathione-Sepharose was done as described by Tu et al.(CITATION). The eluted samples were analyzed by 15% acrylamide gels and detected by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager.
