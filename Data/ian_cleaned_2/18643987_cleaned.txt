!~ABS~! Ubiquitination plays important roles in plant development, including programmed cell death. Here, we characterize a novel membrane-bound RING motif protein, encoded by RING1, that is expressed at a low level in all Arabidopsis tissues but can be upregulated by fumonisin B1 (FB1) treatment and pathogen infection. RING1 displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro, which is dependent on the integrity of the RING motif. GFP fusion protein localization and cell fractionation experiments show that this E3 ligase is associated with the lipid rafts of plasma membranes. Knock-down of RING1 transcripts using artificial microRNA (amiR-R1159) leads to FB1 hyposensitivity, but overexpression of RING1 confers hypersensitivity. Additionally, expression of the pathogenesis-related 1 (PR-1) gene is lower and delayed in amiR-R1159 plants compared with wild-type and RING1-overexpressing plants. The FB1 hyposensitivity of amiR-R1159 plants can be rescued by expression of cleavage-resistant RING1mut transcripts. Our results suggest that RING1 acts as a signal from the plasma membrane lipid rafts to trigger the FB1-induced plant programmed cell death pathway.
!~RES~! To identify Arabidopsis E3 ligase genes induced by stress, in silico gene expression of previously generated genome-wide microarray data was analyzed. Preliminary microarray data indicated that expression of a novel RING-motif type ubiquitin E3 ligase gene, RING1 (At5g10380), was highly induced in response to the fungal toxin FB1 (data not shown). The accumulation of RING1 transcripts in response to FB1 was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Figure 1a). In addition, RING1 expression was highly induced by Pst DC3000 avr RPM1 pathogen infection (Figure 1a). These results suggested that RING1 expression is induced in response to biotic stress. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the expression pattern of RING1 in specific plant tissues and in response to various stresses, we generated an Arabidopsis transgenic line expressing a RING1 promoter::GUS reporter gene. Histochemical GUS staining of several tissues from adult RING1 promoter::GUS transgenic plants was performed in the absence of stress and in response to various stresses (Figure 1b,c). We observed a low level of GUS expression in vegetative tissues of non-stressed adult plants, such as cotyledons, leaves (Figure 1b, middle panel) and root tips (Figure 1b, left panel). However, GUS expression was highly induced in leaves and petioles after FB1 treatment (Figure 1b, right panel) compared with mock treatment (Figure 1b, middle panel). Furthermore, GUS expression was high in regions surrounding cell death lesions on leaves of FB1-treated seedlings (Figure 1b, right panel). We also examined GUS expression in RING1 promoter::GUS transgenic plants in response to infection by bacterial pathogens. GUS staining was detected in regions surrounding lesions that appeared after Pst DC3000 avr RPM1 inoculation on plant leaves (Figure 1c). These results suggested that RING1 is also involved in plant–pathogen interaction. The RING1 locus is located on chromosome 5 of the Arabidopsis genome. The coding sequence contains 903 bp without any introns (Figure 2a,b). A protein of 301 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 34 kDa was predicted from the coding region. Amino acid sequence alignments predicted a transmembrane region at the N-terminus of RING1 (residues 40–62) and a RING motif in the central region of the protein (Figure 2a,b). This RING motif contains a conserved C3H2C3-type RING domain (residues 135–176) (Figure 2b). [[FIGURE]] Based on previous work showing that proteins containing RING motifs can function as E3 ligases in vitro (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we tested whether RING1 also had E3 ligase activity. A maltose-binding protein–RING1 fusion (MBP–RING1–6myc) was affinity-purified, and its putative E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was assayed in vitro. Western blot analysis showed that purified MBP–RING1–6myc was auto-ubiquitinated (Figure 3a, lanes 4, and 5), and this reaction was dependent on E1 and E2 (Figure 3a, lanes 1 and 2). Control experiments showed that MBP alone was inactive (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that the RING motif of RING finger proteins is essential for E3 ligase activity (CITATION). We produced a mutant protein, RING1(C/S), in which the RING motif was altered by changing Cys135 and Cys138 to serine residues. In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that RING1(C/S) was inactive (Figure 3b), indicating that an intact RING motif is essential for its E3 activity. The predicted structure of RING1 included a transmembrane domain at the N-terminus of the protein, between amino acids 40 and 62, suggesting its localization in cell membranes (Figure 2a,b). To determine the cellular localization of RING1, we constructed a RING1–GFP fusion gene and monitored RING1–GFP fluorescence in Agrobacterium-infiltrated Nicotiana tabacum leaves. No GFP signal was detected on epidermal cells of tobacco leaves (data not shown). One possible explanation could be the instability of RING1, which could undergo auto-ubiquitination and self-destruction. To circumvent this problem, we constructed an inactive mutant RING1(C/S) and monitored RING1(C/S)–GFP fluorescence in Agrobacterium-infiltrated N. tabacum leaves. Figure 4(a,b) shows that the RING1(C/S)–GFP fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane. Most importantly, no GFP fluorescence was seen in the cytosol or cytoplasmic strands (Figure 4a, top left and bottom left panels), but fluorescence was detected in nuclei, cytosol and cytoplasmic strands of the GFP control (Figure 4a, bottom right panel). GFP staining of cytoskeleton structures and black hollows that represent organelles was observed in the cytoplasm (Figure 4a, bottom right panel). The detection of RING1(C/S)–GFP fusion protein with compromised E3 ligase activity suggested that the wild-type RING1 is likely to be unstable. [[FIGURE]] To confirm the localization of RING1 in plasma membranes, the Arabidopsis plasma membrane fraction was highly purified by differential centrifugation and aqueous two-phase partition (CITATION) from LexA/VP16/ER (XVE)–RING1–6myc plants induced with β-estradiol. Western blot analysis showed that RING1 protein was highly enriched in the plasma membrane fraction (data not shown). Plant plasma membrane is not homogeneous, and sub-domains called lipid rafts have been suggested to be involved in signaling events (CITATION; CITATION). Accordingly, we further isolated lipid rafts from the plasma membrane fraction, making use of their detergent insolubility at low temperature and low buoyant density on sucrose flotation gradients. Figure 4(b) shows that the RING1 protein was indeed highly enriched in the lipid raft fraction. In addition, a second RING1-related band of higher molecular weight was seen, which was probably a ubiquitinated form of RING1. From these data, we conclude that RING1 may be an unstable protein located in the lipid raft domain of Arabidopsis plasma membranes. Ubiquitination has been shown to target proteins for degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. The auto-ubiquitination activity of RING1 protein, together with its cellular accumulation after disruption of its E3 ligase activity, suggested that this protein may be unstable under normal conditions. To further investigate the stability of RING1 in vivo, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing RING1 protein tagged with 3HA or 6myc. The transgenic lines produced did not show any obvious phenotypic differences from wild-type plants. Seedlings overexpressing RING1–3HA were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) to block new protein synthesis, and RING1–3HA levels were measured over time to determine its half-life (Figure 5a). RING1–3HA rapidly disappeared 30 min after inhibition of protein synthesis, but accumulated under normal conditions in the same transgenic plants (Figure 5a, panels 1 and 2). The rapid disappearance of RING1–3HA was probably due to degradation by 26S proteasomes, as it can be halted by MG132 treatment (Figure 5a, panel 3). In the presence of MG132, ubiquitinated forms of RING1–3HA were also detected. [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, the half-life of RING1–3HA was dramatically increased in the presence of FB1 (Figure 5a, panel 4). The effect was specific because FB1 did not affect the half-life of PHY B or HFR1–3HA proteins (Figure 5b). These results suggest that RING1 protein is unstable under normal conditions but may be stabilized in response to stress conditions, particularly during plant PCD triggered by FB1 treatment. To determine whether auto-ubiquitination of RING1 was responsible for its rapid degradation, we compared the half-life of wild-type RING1–6myc and RING1(C/S)–6myc mutant proteins in vivo. The mutant protein half-life was increased from 0.5 to 1 h relative to that of wild-type RING1–6myc (Figure 5c). Like wild-type RING1–3HA, wild-type RING1–6myc also showed a half-life of 30 min, confirming that the tag indeed had no influence on protein stability (Figure 5c). This result suggests that RING1 stability is in part self-regulated in vivo through its RING motif; however, other E3 ligases are also involved in its turnover. To study the role of RING1 in Arabidopsis, we searched for RING1 knock-out lines. However, no suitable T-DNA insertion line for RING1 was available amongst existing T-DNA mutant collections. We therefore generated RING1 knock-down transgenic lines by cleavage of RING transcripts using artificial miRNAs (CITATION). We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to alter the 21 nt sequence of miR159 to the synthetic sequence 5′-UAUGAUUGAGCCGACGACGCA-3′ (amiR-R1159) directed against nucleotides 139–159 of the RING1 mRNA (Figure 6a,d). A high expression level of amiR-R1159 was obtained in selected transgenic lines (1–16, 39–1 and 55–1; Figure 6b). Northern blot analysis confirmed that these amiR-R1159 lines displayed downregulation of RING1 mRNA, even in the presence of FB1 (Figure 6c). [[FIGURE]] We also generated a mutated form of the RING1 gene (RING1mut) whose amiR-R1159 target sequences were altered to introduce mismatch pairing with amiR-R1159 (Figure 6d). Because of the nucleotide mismatches, RING1mut transcripts should be insensitive to amiR-R1159-mediated cleavage. As the mutated nucleotides of the RING1mut did not change the encoded amino acids, the mutant gene can be used to complement RING1 loss-of-function in amiR-R1159 knock-down transgenic lines. We transferred a RING1mut–3HA gene into amiR-R1159 line 1–16 to obtain a RING1mut–3HA/amiR-R1159 double transgenic plant (line 26). This double transgenic plant continued to express RING1mut transcripts even in the presence of amiR-R1159, indicating that the RING1mut transcript was indeed resistant to amiR-R1159-mediated cleavage. Moreover, expression of RING1mut–3HA protein was detected in this plant (Figure 6e), demonstrating that the RING1mut gene can complement the loss of function of RING1 in amiR-R1159 plants. Neither RING1-overexpressing plants (RING1–3HA) nor amiR-R1159 lines showed any obvious phenotype when grown on MS medium or on soil. We therefore tested the sensitivity of RING1 knock-down (amiR-R1159) and RING1-overexpressing (RING1–3HA) lines to FB1 (Figure 7a). We arbitrarily classified the response symptoms into three classes, according to the severity of the cell death phenotype: insensitive, sensitive, and extremely sensitive (Figure 7a). Seedling growth of plants displaying the extremely sensitive phenotype was strongly inhibited and new leaf formation was blocked. Furthermore, we detected macroscopic lesions on leaves that could lead to leaf death (Figure 7a, left panel). Plants with the sensitive phenotype contained macroscopic lesions on leaves and displayed developmental alterations, such as asymmetric petioles; moreover, the seedlings were bigger than those of extremely sensitive plants and new leaf formation was not inhibited (Figure 7a, middle panel). Seedlings of the insensitive phenotype grew normally like mock-treated plants and no macroscopic lesions were seen (Figure 7a, right panel). [[FIGURE]] Wild-type seedlings treated with FB1 comprised 45.8% extremely sensitive and 41.7% sensitive plants, with the remaining 12.5% seedlings being insensitive to FB1 (Figure 7b). The proportion of FB1-insensitive plants was not significantly different between the two RING1–3HA lines (2–26 and 4–1) and wild-type. Compared to wild-type, however, these two lines showed a slightly higher proportion of plants in the extremely sensitive category (Student’s t-test values of 0.07 and 0.02, respectively) and a corresponding lower proportion of plants in the sensitive category (Student’s t-test values <0.05; Figure 7b). Interestingly, in the two amiR-R1159 lines (1–16 and 39–1) analyzed, only 2.1% of seedlings were extremely sensitive to FB1 and 21.9–22.9% were sensitive, with >75% of seedlings being insensitive to FB1 (Figure 7b). Both knock-down lines were significant different from wild-type for the extremely sensitive and insensitive categories (Student’s t-test values <0.01). These results indicate that reducing the RING1 expression level leads to FB1 hyposensitivity. To show that the FB1 phenotypes of the amiR-R1159 plants were indeed due to reduced RING1 expression, we expressed a 35S–RING1mut–3HA transgene in the these plants. We found that the FB1 hyposensitivity can be converted to hypersensitivity by expression of cleavage-resistant RING1mut transcripts (Figure 7b). In addition, we compared PR-1 expression in amiR-R1159, RING1–3HA, wild-type and RING1mut–3HA/amiR-R1159 plants treated with 1 μm FB1 for various durations. In wild-type plants, PR-1 gene expression was induced after 48 h of FB1 treatment, and the induction was about fivefold at 60 h. The PR-1 expression in two RING1–3HA lines increased 6.0- and 5.8-fold at 60 h, respectively, upon FB1 treatment, and this induction was not significantly different from that of wild-type (Figure 7c). However, PR-1 expression in two amiR-R1159 lines (induction of 3.6- and 2.5-fold at 60 h) was lower than that of wild-type, but was restored to wild-type level in the complementation line (RING1mut–3HA/amiR-R1159 line 26; Figure 7c). These results indicate that RING1 gene expression promotes PR-1 induction by FB1 and implicate RING1 in defense responses.
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used in this work. Seeds were surface-sterilized and stratified at 4°C for 2 days before being plated on MS medium with/without antibiotics or sown on Florobella potting compost/sand mix (3:1) (Scotts-Sierra Horticultural Products Co., http://www.scotts.com). Plants were grown in a tissue culture room under 16 h light/8 h dark, 20–25°C. For Pseudomonas syringae infection, plants were grown on soil in a growth chamber under 8 h light/16 h dark, 20–25°C. Ten-day-old seedlings grown in MS medium were transferred to MS medium containing 1 μm FB1 (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) for 7 days. Plants (n = 32) of each line were treated with 1 μm of FB1 and the experiments repeated three times. After 7 days of treatment, FB1-induced phenotypes were classified into three categories (extremely sensitive, sensitive and insensitive) and calculated as percentage of the total plant population. Possible differences between wild-type and transgenic lines were assessed using Student’s t-test. Ten-day-old seedlings were treated with 1 μm FB1 for 3 days. Total RNA from FB1-treated and non-treated seedlings was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/). One microgram of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using MessageAmp II aRNA kits (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com), and 15 μg of labeled cDNA were used for hybridization. GeneChip hybridization and scanning were performed at the Genomic Resource Center, Rockefeller University, New York (http://www.rockefeller.edu/genomics). The RING1 (At5g10380) gene was cloned from FB1-treated seedlings using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The primers RING1-Fw (5′-CACCATGGCGTTTAATCACAGAAAAATG-3′) and RING1-Rv (5′- ACTGGTGTTACCAGTTACGGATGGCATTTGG-3′) were used for amplification of RING1 cDNA. The RING1 mutant cDNA (C135S, C138S) was generated using a PCR mutagenesis approach by amplification with the following primers: RING1-Fw, RING1-Rv, RING1-CS-Rv and RING1-CS-Fw. RING1-CS-Fw (5′-GGGAGAAGGGATAATCGATGGCACAGAGAGCTCTGTCTCATTAAACGAGTTTG-3′) blank;and RING1-CS-Rv (5′-CAAACTCGTTTAATGAGACAGAGCTCTCTGTGCCATCGATTATCCCTTCTCCC-3′) contain a SacI site (italic) and mutated residues (underlined). All cDNAs were cloned into the pENTR/D vector (Invitrogen) and then transferred to pBA-DC-HA or pER8-DC-myc binary vectors (CITATION) using LR clonase (Invitrogen). The RING1 promoter::GUS construct was obtained by transferring DNA sequence (2034 bp) upstream of the RING1 start codon to pKGWFS7 (CITATION). For protein expression in Escherichia coli, 225 bp of the RING1 5′-end codon sequence were replaced by a DNA sequence encoding the same amino acids but with codons optimized for expression in E. coli. This modified RING1 cDNA was cloned into the pMAL-DC-6myc vector, such that the 5′ end of RING1 was fused to the DNA sequence encoding maltose binding protein (NEB, http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/default.asp) and its 3′ end was fused to DNA sequences encoding a 6myc tag (CITATION). amiRNA was used to knock-down RING1 mRNA expression (CITATION) using the miR159a precursor (pre-miR159a) as the amiRNA backbone. Mutagenesis of pre-miR159a was performed by PCR amplification using amiR-R1-Fw and amiR-R1-Rv primers. The amiR-R1-Fw primer (5′-CGATAGATCTTGATCTGACGATGGAAGTGCGTCGTCGGAACAATCATACATGAGTTGAGCAGGGTA-3′) contains a BglII site (italic) and the amiR-R1159* sequence (underlined). The amiR-R1-Rv primer (5′-TTGACCCGGGATGTGCGTCGTCGGCTCAATCATAGAAGAGTAAAAGCCATTA-3′) contains an XmaI site (italic) and the mature amiR-R1159 reverse complementary sequence (underlined). PCR amplification of the miR159a precursor using the primers described above and pENTR-pre-miR159a, which contains the miR159a precursor cDNA, as a template generated a DNA fragment that was subsequently digested with BglII and XmaI. The BglII–XmaI fragment was moved into pENTR-pre-miR159a to generate pENTR-pre-amiR-RING1159. Gateway system (Invitrogen) procedures were used to transfer the amiR-R1159 precursor to the plant binary Gateway destination vector pBA-DC-6myc, generating pBA-pre-amiR-RING1159, in which the pBA-pre-amiR-R1159 sequence is placed downstream of a 35S promoter. To complement amiR-R1159 transgenic plants, we mutated the amiR-R1159 target sequence on the RING1 cDNA (RING1mut) without changing the encoded amino acids. The RING1mut cDNA was placed downstream of a 35S promoter in a binary vector to generate pKCo-RING1mut-3HA. This construct was transferred into amiR-R1159 transgenic plants for complementation of knock-down of endogenous RING1 mRNA. All constructs in binary vectors were transformed into Arabidopsis plants by the floral dip method (CITATION) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (NEB). For purification of the MBP–RING1 fusion protein, bacterial cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm PMSF, and complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The MBP–RING1 fusion protein was purified using amylose resins (NEB). All proteins were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol). Each reaction mix (30 μl final volume) contained 10 μg of recombinant ubiquitin (Sigma), 0.1 μg rabbit E1 (Boston Biochemicals, http://www.bostonbiochem.com), 0.22 μg E2 UbcH5b (Boston Biochemicals), 200 ng purified MBP–RING1–6myc, 2 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm DTT. After incubation at 30°C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped with 2× SDS–PAGE loading buffer at 100°C for 5 min. Aliquots (10 μl) for each reaction were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% SDS–PAGE gels. Ubiquitinated RING1 proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-myc or anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing either 35S–RING1–3HA or 35S–RING1(C/S)–3HA were germinated and grown on selective media for 1 week (16 h light/8 h dark) before transfer to liquid MS medium supplemented with the indicated concentrations of MG132 (Calbiochem, http://www.emdbiosciences.com) and/or CHX (Sigma). Treated seedlings were harvested at the indicated times for Western and Northern blot analyses. For β-estradiol treatment, XVE–RING1–6myc transgenic plants were grown on MS solid medium containing 1% sucrose under continuous light at 22°C for 1 week. Plants were transferred to MS liquid medium supplemented with 25 μmβ-estradiol (Sigma) for 16 h before Western blot analyses. Total RNA was extracted from leaves using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blot analyses of high-molecular-weight RNA, hybridizations were performed using gene-specific 32P-radiolabeled probes that were synthesized by random priming of cloned cDNA sequence as described by CITATION. To detect low-molecular-weight RNAs, RNA gel blots were hybridized to 32P-radiolabled oligonucleotide probes complementary to the small RNAs as described previously (CITATION). For Northern blot analyses, each lane normally contained 10 μg of total RNA, and 25S rRNA and 5S rRNA were used as loading controls. For Western blot analyses, seedlings were extracted in 20 volumes (w/v) of denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and 0.001% bromophenol blue). After incubation at 100°C for 3 min, extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 g for 3 min. Total proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, and Western blots were analyzed using anti-HA or anti-myc monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, http://www.scbt.com). Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250, and the large subunit of Rubisco (molecular mass, 55 kDa) was used as a loading control. Three-week-old tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana) were agro-infiltrated using a syringe without a needle (CITATION). Plants were maintained for 2 days at 24°C (16 h light/8 h dark). Transformed leaves were analyzed 48 h after infection of the lower epidermis. Confocal imaging was performed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems, http://www.leica-microsystems.com). For imaging expression of GFP constructs, excitation lines of an argon ion laser of 488 nm were used with a 505/530 nm band-pass filter in the single-track facility of the microscope. Post-acquisition image processing was performed using with the LSM 5 image browser (Zeiss, http://www.zeiss.com/), the Leica software and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe, http://www.adobe.com). Transgenic plants harboring RING1 promoter::GUS constructs were stained for GUS activity as described previously (CITATION). Stained plants were visualized using an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss) coupled to an Insight digital camera. All steps were performed at 4°C. Approximately 150–250 g of Arabidopsis tissues (4-week-old seedlings) were homogenized in 400 ml of grinding buffer (50 mm Tris/MES pH 8.0, 220 mm sucrose, 15 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF). The homogenate was centrifuged at 16 000 g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered and centrifuged again at 96 000 g for 35 min. The pelleted microsmoal fraction was purified by phase partition (CITATION) in an aqueous two-phase system (polyethylene glycol 3350 (Sigma)/Dextran T-500 (GE Life Sciences, http://www.gelifesciences.com), 6% each in 5 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 6 mm KCl) to obtain highly enriched plasma membrane. Detergent-insoluble membranes were obtained as described by CITATION. Triton X-100 (Sigma) (10%) was added to a ratio of detergent to plasma membrane proteins of 10 (1% final concentration), and the membranes were solubilized at 4°C for 30 min. Treated membranes were brought to a final concentration of 52% w/w sucrose, overlaid with successive 3 ml steps of 40, 35 and 30% w/w sucrose in TBS buffer, and then centrifuged for 16 h at 200 000 g in a TST41 rotor (Sorvall). Detergent-insoluble membranes were recovered above the 30–35% layers as an opaque band, and this fraction was washed in 4 ml of TBS buffer to remove residual sucrose. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, http://www.piercenet.com) to avoid interference by Triton X-100, using BSA as the protein standard. Proteins in the sucrose-density gradient were precipitated in 10% cold trichloracetic acid (TCA) for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the pellet was first washed with 10% TCA in water to remove residual sucrose and then with cold acetone before being resuspended in a loading buffer for SDS–PAGE and Western blot analysis.
