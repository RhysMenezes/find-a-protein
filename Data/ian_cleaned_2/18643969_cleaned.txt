!~ABS~! A blue-light photoreceptor in plants, phototropin, mediates phototropism, chloroplast relocation, stomatal opening, and leaf-flattening responses. Phototropin is divided into two functional moieties, the N-terminal photosensory and the C-terminal signaling moieties. Phototropin perceives light stimuli by the light, oxygen or voltage (LOV) domain in the N-terminus; the signal is then transduced intramolecularly to the C-terminal kinase domain. Two phototropins, phot1 and phot2, which have overlapping and distinct functions, exist in Arabidopsis thaliana. Phot1 mediates responses with higher sensitivity than phot2. Phot2 mediates specific responses, such as the chloroplast avoidance response and chloroplast dark positioning. To elucidate the molecular basis for the functional specificities of phot1 and phot2, we exchanged the N- and C-terminal moieties of phot1 and phot2, fused them to GFP and expressed them under the PHOT2 promoter in the phot1 phot2 mutant background. With respect to phototropism and other responses, the chimeric phototropin consisting of phot1 N-terminal and phot2 C-terminal moieties (P1n/2cG) was almost as sensitive as phot1; whereas the reverse combination (P2n/1cG) functioned with lower sensitivity. Hence, the N-terminal moiety mainly determined the sensitivity of the phototropins. Unexpectedly, both P1n/2cG and P2n/1cG mediated the chloroplast avoidance response, which is specific to phot2. Hence, chloroplast avoidance activity appeared to be suppressed specifically in the combination of N- and C-terminal moieties of phot1. Unlike the chloroplast avoidance response, chloroplast dark positioning was observed for P2G and P2n/1cG but not for P1G or P1n/2cG, suggesting that a specific structure in the N-terminal moiety of phot2 is required for this activity.
!~RES~! Phototropin consists of two functional moieties, the N-terminal photosensory moiety and the C-terminal kinase moiety (Briggs et al., 2001a,b). To investigate how each of these moieties contributes to the functional specificities of phot1 and phot2, they were exchanged between phot1 and phot2, fused to GFP (P1n/2cG and P2n/1cG), and expressed in the Arabidopsis phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant background under the control of the authentic PHOT2 promoter (Figure 1a). Full-length phot1 and phot2 fused to GFP (P1G and P2G) were expressed as controls. The resulting lines were designated as P2-P1n/2cG, P2-P2n/1cG, P2-P1G, and P2-P2G. Several independent lines that exhibited GFP fluorescence were selected for each construct and subjected to further analysis. [[FIGURE]] We first observed the morphological phenotypes in those lines (Figure 1b). The rosette leaves of the phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant curls downward (CITATION). This phenotype was complemented in all the lines. In contrast to plants expressing phot2 derivatives under the control of the 35S promoter (CITATION; CITATION), the present lines grew normally without any growth defect such as reduction in the size of the rosette leaf or male sterility. The expression levels of the introduced proteins were examined by immunoblotting of rosette leaves (Figure 2a). First, a P2-P2G line that expressed approximately endogenous levels of the introduced proteins was selected as a control line (P2-P2G 44). The expression levels in other lines were then examined with reference to P2-P2G 44. Consequently, P2-P1G 3, P2-P1n/2cG 7, and P1-P2n/1cG 35 were selected as representative lines. A few additional lines were selected for each construct and used in some experiments for confirmation of the results. We then observed GFP fluorescence in those lines. As expected, the intensity of fluorescence was comparable between those lines, both in the mesophyll (Figure 2b) and epidermis (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] The expression levels in dark-grown seedlings were examined by immunoblotting (Figure 2c). For an unknown reason, the levels of P2G in P2-P2G 44 and 49 were more than twice as high as the endogenous phot2 level. Similar over-accumulation was observed in P2-P2n/1cG but not in P2-P1G or P2-P1n/2cG. In consistent with the immunoblotting result, P2-P2G 44 and P2-P2n/1cG 35 exhibited higher GFP fluorescence than P2-P1G 3 or P2-P1n/2cG7 in cotyledon mesophyll cells, although the fluorescence in hypocotyl epidermis was comparable (Figure 2d). Hence, the lower expressers (P2-P2G 52 and P2-P2n/1cG 46) were additionally chosen for phototropic experiments (Figure 2c). We confirmed that the GFP fluorescence was weaker in these lines (data not shown). Phototropins are autophosphorylated both in vitro (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and in vivo (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) in a light-dependent manner. The autophosphorylation is accompanied by a mobility shift that is observable by SDS-PAGE (CITATION; CITATION). Hence, we examined the BL-induced electrophoretic mobility shift in vivo (Figure 3). The mature plants were adapted to continuous red light (RL) for 24 h and then treated with BL. The immunoblot analysis of the extracts indicated that all of the recombinant phototropins were autophosphorylated in response to BL. In addition, the levels of the introduced proteins were not significantly changed by irradiation with BL at 48 μmol m−2 sec−1 for 1 h in rosette leaves, although light-dependent degradation of phot1 has been reported in etiolated seedlings (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Phot1 and phot2 are mainly localized in the plasma membrane region (CITATION; CITATION). Interestingly, a fraction of P1G is released into the cytoplasm in response to BL (CITATION). More recently, relocalization of P1G into the cytoplasm was observed at higher resolution (CITATION). In contrast to P1G, a fraction of P2G is associated with the Golgi apparatus in a light-dependent manner (CITATION). Using confocal microscopy, we observed GFP fluorescence in cotyledon epidermal cells (Figure 4). As in the hypocotyl epidermis (Figure 2d), GFP fluorescence in the cotyledon epidermis was comparable between the representative lines. In all the lines, GFP fluorescence was observed mainly in the plasma membrane region, regardless of the light conditions (Figure 4a). As with P2G (CITATION), a punctate pattern appeared after irradiation with BL in P2-P1n/2cG. Irradiation with BL from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (48 μmol m−2 sec−1) effectively induced the punctate staining as well (data not shown). By contrast, the punctate structure was observed in neither P2-P1G nor P2-P2n/1cG. Instead, cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed following the light treatment in these lines as previously reported for P1-P1G (CITATION; CITATION). Hence, the C-terminal moiety was confirmed to be responsible for the distribution patterns specific to phot1 and phot2 in the light. [[FIGURE]] The appearance of punctate staining under a lower intensity of BL was also examined in P2-P2G and P2-P1n/2cG (Figure 4d). Under medium BL at 2 μmol m−2 sec−1, the punctate staining of P1n/2cG was detected within 10 min of onset of BL exposure. By contrast, punctate staining of P2G remained undetectable even after 20 min of exposure. Hence, P1n/2cG responded to BL with a higher sensitivity than P2G for the association with the punctate structures. As previously reported (CITATION), cytoplasmic fluorescence of P2G was detected in the dark (Figure 4a,b). Interestingly, similar fluorescence was observed in P2-P2n/1cG but not in P1n/2cG. In guard cells, phot1 and phot2 redundantly mediate BL-induced stomatal opening with similar sensitivity (CITATION). We examined whether the chimeric phototropins retain this activity (Figure 5). Leaf strips were prepared from the rosette leaves and treated with or without high BL (10 μmol m−2 sec−1). Consequently, we confirmed that stomata opened in response to BL in all of the lines, including wild type, P2-P1G, P2-P2G, P2-P1n/2cG, and P2-P2n/1cG. Hence, both P1n/2cG and P2n/1cG retain the ability to mediate stomatal opening. [[FIGURE]] Phot1 mediates the phototropic response in the hypocotyl at a broad range of fluence rates (0.01–100 μmol m−2 sec−1), whereas the response of phot2 is elicited only by higher fluence rates (>10 μmol m−2 sec−1) (CITATION). To determine which of the N- and C-terminal moieties is responsible for this difference in sensitivity, we examined the responses mediated by chimeric phototropins (Figure 6). The hypocotyl curvature was measured after 12-h exposure to various intensities of unilateral BL in two independent lines for each construct. In addition, we analyzed one of each of the additional lines for P2-P2G and P2-P2n/1cG in which the introduced protein was underexpressed (Figure 2c). [[FIGURE]] All the lines except the phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant efficiently responded to a higher intensity of BL (40 μmol m−2 sec−1) (Figure 6). Hence, both P1n/2cG and P2n/1cG retained the basic ability to mediate the phototropic response. However, the response to lower intensities of BL varied between the lines. The fluence response curves for P2-P1G and P2-P1n/2cG were almost identical to those for the wild type and the phot2-1 mutant, although the response was a little weaker in P2-P1n/2cG than in P2-P1G at 0.02 μmol m−2 sec−1. Hence, P1G and P1n/2cG were almost as sensitive as the endogenous phot1. By contrast, the response mediated by the endogenous phot2, P2G or P2n/1cG was much less sensitive. These lines failed to respond to BL at 0.1 μmol m−2 sec−1. It should be noted here that the C-terminal moiety affected sensitivity to some extent. Namely, a small but significant difference was observed between the P2-P2G and P2-P2n/1cG lines. The latter showed stronger curvature than the former at 2 μmol m−2 sec−1. This could not be due to the difference in expression levels because the level was higher in P2-P2G 44 or 49 than in P2-P2n/1cG 46, as judged by immunoblot analysis (Figure 2c). The chloroplast accumulation response is redundantly mediated by phot1 and phot2. However, the response mediated by phot1 is more sensitive than that mediated by phot2 (CITATION). Hence, we examined the chloroplast accumulation response under different intensities of BL (Figure 7). As expected from the previous report (CITATION), a microbeam of low BL at 0.05 μmol m−2 sec−1 led to accumulation of chloroplasts in the wild type but not in the phot1 mutant. The accumulation response was also observed in P2-P1G and P2-P1n/2cG lines, whereas neither P2-P2G nor P2-P2n/1cG exhibited the response. Hence, high sensitivity in the accumulation response was conferred by the N-terminal moiety, as is the case with phototropism. [[FIGURE]] We then examined whether chloroplasts accumulated at a medium intensity of BL (3.4 μmol m−2 sec−1), to which both phot1 and phot2 are responsive (CITATION). As expected, all the lines except P2-P1n/2cG exhibited the response (Figure 8). In the P2-P1n/2cG line, a medium intensity of BL elicited avoidance rather than the accumulation response (see below). [[FIGURE]] While both phot1 and phot2 mediate the accumulation response, only phot2 mediates the avoidance response to higher intensities of BL (CITATION). To examine the avoidance response, mesophyll cells were first irradiated with a BL beam at a medium intensity (3.4 μmol m−2 sec−1) to accumulate chloroplasts, and then the intensity was increased to 57 μmol m−2 sec−1 to elicit the avoidance response (Figure 8). Consequently, the avoidance response was observed in the wild type, the phot1 mutant, P2-P2G, and P2-P2-P2n/1cG. In the case of P2-P1n/2cG, chloroplasts accumulated with the low-BL treatment (see above). The intensity was then increased to the medium level (3.4 μmol m−2 sec−1), which elicited the avoidance response. Hence, P1n/2cG mediated the avoidance response with a higher sensitivity. In summary, all the derivatives except P1G were capable of mediating the avoidance response. Chloroplasts accumulate at the bottom of the cell in darkness. Phot2, but not phot1, is required for this specific positioning (CITATION). Therefore, we examined this phenomenon in the present lines (Figure 9). As expected from the previous report, this accumulation was observed in the wild type and P2-P2G lines, but not in the P2-P1G line, the phot2 mutant, or the phot1 phot2 double mutant. Interestingly, dark positioning was restored in the P2-P2n/1cG line but not in the P2-P1n/2cG line. Hence, the N-terminal moiety was responsible for chloroplast dark positioning. [[FIGURE]] We then examined whether the N-terminal fragment of phot2 alone could position chloroplasts at the bottom of the cell in darkness (Figure 9). For this purpose we used a transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the fragment fused to GFP under the control of 35S promoter in the phot1 phot2 double mutant background (35-P2NG/p1p2 line) (CITATION). Observation revealed that the N-terminal fragment of phot2 could not position chloroplasts at the bottom of the cell even though the fragment was accumulated at a high level in this line (CITATION). Hence, the C-terminal moiety, irrespective of its source, was required for dark positioning. We further examined whether the C-terminal fragment of phot2 could induce dark positioning using the 35-P2CG/p1p2 line, in which the fragment was expressed under the control of 35S promoter (CITATION). However, chloroplasts were not positioned at the bottom of the cell (Figure 9).
!~MM~! The wild-type (gl-1, Columbia) and phototropin mutants, phot1-5 (CITATION), phot2-1 (cav1-1, CITATION), phot1-5 phot2-1 (CITATION), were used. Plants expressing GFP (35-GFP) (CITATION) and the N- and C-terminal fragment of phot2 fused to GFP (35-P2NG/p1p2 6-2 and 35-P2CG/p1p2 9, respectively) (CITATION) under the control of the 35S promoter in the phot1-5 phot2-2 mutant background have been described elsewhere. Seeds were planted on 0.6% agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1% w/v sucrose at pH 5.8. Plants were grown at 22°C in all experiments. For immunoblot analysis, plants were grown for 3 weeks on agar plates under continuous white light (cWL) at 34 μmol m−2 sec−1. Etiolated seedlings were grown for 3 days in the dark for hypocotyl phototropic responses. For chloroplast relocation experiments, plants grown on agar plates for 14 days under cWL at 34 μmol m−2 sec−1 were transplanted onto pots of soil and additionally grown for 10 days under 16-h day/8-h night cycles of white light at about 42 μmol m−2 sec−1. For stomatal opening experiments, plants were grown on pots of soil for 4–5 weeks under the same day/night cycles. The PHOT1 cDNA with a BamHI tail at its 3′ end was fused to the GFP gene with a BamHI tail at its 5′ end to produce P1G. The 35S promoter in the binary vector 35S-nosT/pPZP211 (CITATION) was replaced with a genomic fragment corresponding to the PHOT1 authentic promoter (position −3918 to 594) (PP1-nosT/pPZP211). The P1G fragment was then inserted into PP1-nosT/pPZP211 (Pp1:P1G-nosT/pPZP211). Pp2:P2G-nosT/pPZP211, which contains the fusion gene between PP2(−3047 to −1 of the PHOT2 gene) and P2G (1–2745 of the PHOT2 cDNA fused to the GFP gene), was previously described (CITATION). The PP2(−3047 to −1 of the PHOT2 gene):P1n(1–782 of the PHOT1 gene) fusion fragment was engineered by a combination of PCR reactions as described here (Figure S1). The Pp2 and P1n fragments, with additional small overlapping sequences, were amplified by PCR. These overlapping fragments served as templates to produce the PP2:P1n fragment by the polymerase reaction. The resulting fusion fragment was then amplified in a second PCR reaction. In the actual experiments, the latter two steps were carried out consecutively in the same tube. The P1n/2cG fragment, in which the P1n (1–1857 of P1G) and P2cG (1600–2745 of P2G) were fused, and the P2n/1cG fragment, in which P2n (1–1599 of P2G) and P1cG (1858–2988 of P1G) were fused, were prepared in similar ways (Figure S1). The sequences of the primers are listed below.

The resulted constructs, Pp2:P2G, Pp2:P1G, Pp2:P1n/2cG, and Pp2:P2n/1cG, were transformed into the phot1-5 phot2-1 double mutant by the floral dip method (CITATION). The resulting transgenic lines were designated as P2-P2G, P2-P1G, P2-P1n/2cG, and P2-P2n/1cG, respectively (Figure 1a). Kanamycin-resistant T1 plants were selected on MS agar. Based on segregation of kanamycin resistance, homozygous T3 lines with a single transgene locus were selected. The anti-phot1 polyclonal antibody was produced as follows. The phot1 N-terminal fragment (Met1–Thr619):His-tag fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified with a Ni2+-column. The purified protein was injected into a rabbit with Freund’s complete adjuvant. Three booster injections with incomplete adjuvant were given at 2-week intervals. Seven days after the last booster injection, blood was drawn and the serum containing anti-phot1 polyclonal antibody was prepared. The titer and specificity of the antibody was examined by immunoblotting. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (CITATION). Crude protein extracts were prepared from mature rosette leaves or 3-day-old etiolated seedlings. The proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The antibodies used were the anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Nacalai, http://www.nacalai.co.jp/en/), the anti-phot1 polyclonal antibody (see above), and the anti-phot2 polyclonal antibody (CITATION). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out in a dark-room with the aid of a green safe light. Specimens were prepared on a glass slide and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV300 + BX60; Olympus, http://www.olympus.co.jp/en/). A band-pass filter (510–530 nm) and a long-pass filter (>610 nm) were used for GFP and chlorophyll fluorescence observation, respectively. The confocal images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems, http://www.adobe.com/). The hypocotyl curvature assay was performed as described (CITATION). In brief, the growth angle of the hypocotyl in 3-day-old etiolated seedlings treated with unilateral BL at various intensities for 12 h was measured. Blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs; peak at 470 nm, half-bandwidth = 30 nm; LSD-mB, EYELA, http://www.eyelaworld.com/) were used as the light source. The light was attenuated with dark acryl plates (S802 and S909; Takiron, http://www.takiron.co.jp/english/) when necessary. Twenty-four-day-old plants were placed under red light (RL) at 16 μmol m−2 sec−1 from LED arrays (LED-R; EYELA) for 12–14 h before the observation. Chloroplast movement was examined using a microbeam irradiation system based on a epifluorescent microscope (BX51; Olympus) essentially as described (CITATION; CITATION). The evacuated rosette leaves were irradiated on a glass slide with a BL beam from an illumination unit equipped with a halogen lamp (TH4-100; Olympus). The monochromatic BL passing through a band-pass filter (peak at 450 nm, half-bandwidth = 30 nm; S450/30 m; Chroma Technology Corp., http://www.chroma.com/) was attenuated with a combination of a dichroic mirror and neutral density filters (ND50 and ND6; Olympus). A rectangular field diaphragm was placed to narrow the irradiated area to 20 × 226 μm on the specimen surface. The visible light from a halogen lamp for observation with a CCD camera was filtered through a red acrylic filter (Shinkolite A102; Mitsubishi Rayon, http://www.mrc.co.jp/english/). For the dark-positioning experiments, 24-day-old plants were placed in the dark for 1 day before the observation. Transverse sections of evacuated rosette leaves were prepared on a vibratome (DSK, Kyoto, http://www.kyoto.zap.ne.jp/dkaih504/) and subjected to confocal microscopic observation. A few optical sections at 2-μm intervals were electronically overlaid to obtain hemispherical projections of mesophyll cells. Measurements of stomatal aperture were performed according to a previously described method (CITATION) with modifications. Leaves from 4-week-old plants were blended in distilled water in a Waring Commercial blender (Waring Commercial, http://www.waringproducts.com) for 15 sec. The blended material was filtered in 2 ml of basal reaction mixture [5 mm MES-BTP (MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; BTP, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]-propane)], pH 6.5, 5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2) in a Petri dish (35 mm diameter). Strips were then illuminated with BL superimposed on background RL for 2–3 h. After treatment, the strips were collected on a 48-μm nylon mesh and plated onto a microscope slide with a cover glass. Stomatal apertures in the abaxial epidermis were measured microscopically at ×400 magnification. Blue light (peak at 475 nm, half-bandwidth = 23.7 nm) and RL (peak at 660 nm, half-bandwidth = 24.0 nm) were from LED arrays (IS-mini; CCS, http://www.ccs-inc.co.jp/eng/).
