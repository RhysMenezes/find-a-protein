!~ABS~! Precise control of gene expression is critical for embryo development in both animals and plants. We report that Arabidopsis thaliana GLUTAMINE-RICH PROTEIN23 (GRP23) is a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that functions as a potential regulator of gene expression during early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutations of GRP23 caused the arrest of early embryo development. The vast majority of the mutant embryos arrested before the 16-cell dermatogen stage, and none of the grp23 embryos reached the heart stage. In addition, 19% of the mutant embryos displayed aberrant cell division patterns. GRP23 encodes a polypeptide with a Leu zipper domain, nine PPRs at the N terminus, and a Gln-rich C-terminal domain with an unusual WQQ repeat. GRP23 is a nuclear protein that physically interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit III in both yeast and plant cells. GRP23 is expressed in developing embryos up to the heart stage, as revealed by β-glucuronidase reporter gene expression and RNA in situ hybridization. Together, our data suggest that GRP23, by interaction with RNA polymerase II, likely functions as a transcriptional regulator essential for early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! To understand the molecular mechanisms that control gametophyte and embryo development, we performed a genetic screen for mutants with a distorted Mendelian segregation and reduced seed set (CITATION) in our collection of gene/enhancer trap lines generated by the Ac/Ds transposon system in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION). set09078 was shown to be an enhancer trap line that exhibited an aberrant segregation ratio of the kanamycin selection marker. The kanamycin-resistant (Kanr) to kanamycin-sensitive (Kans) ratio was 1.97:1 (Kanr:Kans = 1120:569) in selfed set09078 progeny, a ratio close to 2:1 (P > 0.9). This suggested that it was an embryo-lethal mutation (emb) or a gametophytic mutation. Therefore, we checked for seed set in wild-type and set09078 plants at the same developmental stage. In wild-type siliques at 7 d after pollination, full seed set was observed (Figure 1A ), whereas in set09078 plants grown under the same conditions as the wild type, 275 of 1045 ovules were small, shrunken, and aborted (Figure 1B). This finding indicates that approximately one-quarter of the ovules (275:1045) could not develop into mature seeds. [[FIGURE]] To investigate whether the mutation also affected gametophyte functions, reciprocal crosses between set09078 and wild-type plants were performed. When heterozygous set09078 plants were used as pollen donors, the F1 progeny segregated with a ratio of 0.95:1 (202 Kanr:212 Kans), and when heterozygous set09078 plants were used as egg donors, the F1 progeny segregated at 0.99:1 (190:192). Both ratios were close to 1:1 (P > 0.9), suggesting that both the male and female gametophytes are functionally normal and the mutation can fully transmit to the next generation. Together, these data indicated that the phenotype conferred by set09078 is attributable to a single recessive embryo-lethal mutation. To determine when embryo development was disrupted in the mutant, siliques at ∼7 d after pollination from heterozygous set09078 plants were dissected and cleared by the whole-mount clearing method using Herr's solution (1971). Cleared ovules were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope using differential interference contrast optics. The results showed that embryo development was arrested at the early globular stage in approximately one-quarter of the ovules, whereas the remaining 75% had already developed to the heart stage (Figure 1C). Although the normal embryos continued to develop, the arrested embryos subsequently became shriveled and finally degenerated (data not shown). The mutant embryos never reached the heart stage but arrested by the early globular stage. Despite the aberrant embryo development phenotype, no developmental defect was observed during endosperm development in the mutant ovules. To further investigate earlier developmental defects during embryogenesis, we first studied embryo development in wild-type plants. Siliques of wild-type plants at different times after pollination were made transparent with the whole-mount clearing method and examined microscopically. The typical embryo development of Arabidopsis has been reported previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Briefly, the zygote elongates along the micropyle–chalazal axis and then undergoes an asymmetric transverse cell division, giving rise to a small apical cell and a large basal cell (Figure 1D). Subsequently, the apical cell undergoes a series of mitotic divisions to form a 16-cell dermatogen embryo, including an outer layer of eight protodermal cells and eight inner cells (Figure 1E). Thereafter, cells of the upper tier and the lower tier will adopt oriented divisions either perpendicular or parallel to the apical–basal axis in a predestined pattern to increase cell number. As cell divisions progress, embryo polarity is further refined at the early heart stage (Figure 1F), and polar growth along the apical–basal axis results in the subsequent formation of late heart (Figure 1G), torpedo, and mature embryos. Concurrently, the basal cell goes through a series of transverse divisions to form a suspensor composed of a single file of 6 to 11 cells. We then determined the stage at which the set09078 embryos are arrested during embryogenesis. Siliques of the heterozygous set09078 plants grown under the same conditions and of the same age as wild-type plants were selected for detailed microscopic examination. Heterozygous set09078 siliques in which the 75% unaffected embryos developed into late globular/heart stage embryos were used to determine the terminal phenotype of the 25% homozygous mutant embryos. In younger siliques, it is difficult to distinguish the phenotypes of mutant and wild-type embryos. These studies showed that the developmental arrest of mutant embryos could occur at any time from the 1-cell to 16-cell stage. Of the 269 mutant embryos examined, 6% were arrested at the 1-cell embryo stage (Figure 1H), 19% were arrested at the 2- to 4-cell stage (Figures 1I and 1J), 38% were arrested from the 6-cell to the 8-cell stage (Figures 1K to 1M), and 18% were arrested at the 16-cell stage (Figure 1N). In addition to the arrested embryo phenotype, aberrant cell divisions were also observed. These resulted in the formation of an elongated apical cell or embryo proper (Figures 1J and 1N) instead of the typical globular embryo in wild-type plants (Figure 1E). A notable phenotype of the set09078 mutant is that ∼19% of the mutant embryos displayed aberrant positioning of the division planes and asynchronous divisions (Figures 1O to 1Q). Furthermore, asynchronous divisions of the embryo proper (Figure 1K) and suspensor cells (Figure 1L) were observed. Despite the dramatic early embryo development defect in the mutant, the number of endosperm nuclei and the length of suspensor cells appeared to be comparable to those of the wild type at the same stage. These results suggested that the mutation has pleiotropic effects but that the gene plays an essential role specifically during early embryo development. To identify the gene disrupted in the mutant, thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR was used to obtain the genomic sequences flanking the Ds element in set09078 (CITATION; CITATION). Analysis of the flanking sequences revealed that a Ds element was inserted at nucleotide position 222 bp downstream of the ATG initiation codon of the intronless At1g10270 gene (Figure 2A ). The insertion resulted in a 9-bp nucleotide duplication at the insertion site (data not shown). Based on the Arabidopsis genome sequence, there is only a single copy of the At1g10270 gene. DNA gel blot hybridization using a Ds-5′–specific probe showed that only a single Ds element was inserted in the mutant genome (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). A database search further identified two independent T-DNA insertion lines (SALK_128329 and SALK_074740) available from the ABRC (Ohio State University). T-DNAs were present at different positions in At1g10270 in these two lines (Figure 2A). The T-DNA insertion sites were confirmed by PCR analysis using a T-DNA left border primer (LBb1) (CITATION) and a gene-specific primer. Phenotypic characterization showed that the seed abortion ratios were ∼23% (170:728; P > 0.25) for SALK_074740 and 24% (168:698; P > 0.25) for SALK_128329. These ratios are consistent with the expected 25% seed abortion. Microscopic analysis revealed that the embryonic defects in these aborted seeds were similar to those in grp23 (data not shown). The segregation of T-DNA insertion was determined by PCR analyses using LBb1 and the gene-specific primer, because the NPTII gene conferring kanamycin resistance was silenced in the SALK lines (CITATION). In the selfed progeny of SALK_074740, 29 of 43 siblings contained T-DNA and 14 did not. For the selfed SALK_128329 progeny, 33 of 48 siblings contained the T-DNA insertion and 15 did not. Both lines showed a 2:1 ratio of T-DNA segregation, suggesting that the homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants were also as embryo-lethal as set09078. Together, these data strongly suggest that the embryo phenotype is tightly linked to the disruption of At1g10270 function. [[FIGURE]] To further determine whether the embryo-lethal phenotype that we observed is indeed the result of a Ds insertion within At1g10270, genetic complementation was performed. A 5577-bp genomic DNA fragment encompassing from 2262 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon to 576 bp downstream of the TAG stop codon of At1g10270 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pCAMBIA1300. This construct was introduced into heterozygous set09078 plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated infiltration (CITATION). In total, 18 independent transgenic T1 plants were obtained by double selection on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium plates containing 20 μg/mL hygromycin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. All T1 plants were allowed to self-fertilize, and their progeny were scored for the segregation of normal and aborted seeds. We found that 17 transformants displayed obvious restoration of seed set, and five independent lines were then randomly chosen for a more detailed statistical analysis. This showed that the ratio of normal to aborted seeds in T1 plants is close to 15:1 (see Supplemental Table 1 online). This finding indicated that the transgene successfully complemented the mutation. In addition, several T3 plants that are completely resistant to kanamycin and hygromycin were obtained, and they all showed full seed set (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrated that the embryo-lethal phenotype was indeed caused by the loss of function of At1g10270. Furthermore, they showed that the 5577-bp fragment harbors all of the genetic components required for the function of this gene. At1g10270 encodes a putative protein of 913 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 102 kD and a pI of 7.67. Sequence analysis revealed that there is a basic region with a putative nuclear localization signal (ERRRRKRRLR) at its N terminus. Downstream of the basic region, there is a classic Leu zipper motif in which periodic repetitions of Leu residues at every seventh position are present (Figure 2B). Interestingly, there is a 25–amino acid region rich in Pro residues (8:25) separating the nuclear localization signal and the Leu zipper domain (Figure 2B). Therefore, At1g10270 encodes a putative basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcriptional regulator. In addition, At1g10270 contains nine tandem PPR motifs downstream of the Leu zipper domain at its N terminus and a Gln-rich domain at its C terminus (Figures 2B and 2C). Therefore, we designated it GRP23, for glutamine-rich PPR protein. The nine PPR motifs were arranged in tandem from amino acid residues 181 to 576 (Figures 2B and 2C). The PPR motif, usually consisting of ∼35 amino acids, appears to have a structural similarity to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif, which in general is 34 amino acids long and is involved in protein–protein interaction (CITATION). There are three TPR motifs overlapping within the second, fourth, and eighth PPR repeats, respectively (Figure 2B). Besides the nine PPR motifs at the N terminus of GRP23, there are 79 Gln residues from amino acids 630 to 905 in the C-terminal region (Figures 2B and 2C). This indicates that the C terminus is a distinct Gln-rich domain (29% Gln). Interestingly, there are 14 discernible repeats (Wx2Qx4Qx2) with regularly spaced Trp and Gln residues within the Gln-rich region. Each repeat contains 11 amino acids, and each starts with a Trp (Figure 2B). Database search results suggest that it is an unusual structural motif unique to the GRP23 protein. We named this repeat the WQQ repeat. National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST analysis reveals a large family of related proteins that have high homology with GRP23 at the amino acid level. Most of these proteins are annotated as PPR-containing proteins. Individual alignment of GRP23 with these proteins did not reveal any long stretches of sequence identity or similarity to the Gln-rich domain; rather, they shared conserved amino acids with the PPR domain of GRP23. An alignment between GRP23 and its top three hits is shown in Figure 3 . Among these three proteins, ACT11D09.4 from Cucumis melo is most similar to GRP23, showing 62% identity and 76% similarity at the amino acid level. AAV32241.1 from Oryza sativa shares 48% identity and 66% similarity to GRP23. Another notable homolog is At3g49240 from Arabidopsis; loss of function of At3g49240 also displayed an embryo-defective phenotype (CITATION). At3g49240 encodes a predicted polypeptide of 629 amino acid residues containing 11 PPR motifs arranged in tandem. It shares 34% identity and 51% similarity with GRP23 at the amino acid level in the PPR region. There is little homology in the C terminus. These analyses indicated that GRP23 is a novel PPR protein. [[FIGURE]] The presence of the putative N-terminal nuclear localization signal and the bZIP domain suggests that GRP23 is a putative nuclear transcription regulator. To define its subcellular localization, C-terminal translational fusion of GRP23 with YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (YFP) driven by the constitutive 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus was cloned into pCAMBIA1300 to yield P35S-GRP23-YFP. The P35S-GRP23-YFP construct was subsequently introduced into wild-type plants using Agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration (CITATION). Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that in the root cells of transgenic plants harboring the P35S-GRP23-YFP transgene, the YFP fluorescence colocalized with 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) fluorescence, a DNA-specific dye (Figure 4 ). This indicated that GRP23 is indeed targeted to the nucleus. To determine whether the fusion protein is still functional, the P35S-GRP23-YFP transgene was further introduced into grp23 mutant plants by crossing. All of the F2 plants heterozygous for the Ds insertion exhibited obvious rescue of the embryo-defective phenotype (data not shown), indicating that the P35S-GRP23-YFP fusion functionally complemented the mutant phenotype. Together, these results indicated that GRP23 is indeed a nuclear protein. [[FIGURE]] We next investigated the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the GRP23 gene. At first, we used RT-PCR with total RNA from different organs, including roots, stems, leaves, inflorescences, siliques, and seedlings. As shown in Figure 5A , after 35 cycles of PCR amplification, a single band with the expected size was detectable in RNAs from roots, stems, leaves, inflorescences, siliques, and seedlings. The highest expression level was in inflorescences, siliques, and roots, and very low expression occurred in stems, seedlings, and leaves (Figure 5A). Consistently, microarray data available at the GENEVESTIGATOR (http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) showed the highest expression level of GRP23 in seeds and moderate levels in shoot apices and inflorescences (Figure 5B). A lower level of expression occurred in other tissues. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate its expression pattern, especially during embryogenesis, we used a PGRP23-GUS (for β-glucuronidase) reporter system to monitor GRP23 expression. The 2718-bp promoter region upstream of the ATG start codon plus the 347 bp of the first exon of GRP23 was used to drive the GUS reporter gene. In addition, the 576-bp 3′ fragment immediately downstream of the stop codon was also cloned behind the GUS coding sequence. Twelve independent transgenic lines expressing the PGRP23-GUS fusion protein were analyzed. A high level of GUS activity was detected in ovules of young siliques (Figures 6A and 6C ), inflorescences (Figure 6B), and pollen grains (Figure 6C). In embryo sacs, GUS activity was detected at all stages of female gametophyte development from one nucleate to the mature unfertilized embryo sac (Figures 6E and 6F). Strong GUS staining was seen in the zygote (Figure 6G), and ∼12 h after fertilization, GUS activity was detected in the apical cell, basal cell, and endosperm cells (Figure 6H). Before the globular stage, strong GUS activity was observed mainly in the embryo proper (Figures 6I and 6J). Besides in the embryo proper, weak GUS activity was also detected in the suspensor and the endosperm at the heart stage. In addition, GUS activity was observed in the apical root meristem, lateral root primordia, shoot apex, and leaf primordia (Figure 6D). These data indicated that GRP23 is expressed mostly in pollen grains and embryos, with low levels of expression in endosperm cells during sexual reproduction and in actively dividing cells during vegetative growth. [[FIGURE]] To validate the GUS expression pattern, we further performed RNA in situ hybridization. The gene-specific antisense and sense RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin. Specific mRNA signals could be detected at different stages during early embryo development. Figure 6K shows that a moderate hybridization signal was observed in the embryo proper and suspensor cell. Prominent signals were detected at the eight-cell embryo proper, suspensor, and developing endosperm cells (Figures 6L to 6N). Strong signals could be detected up to the heart stage (Figure 6O). No signal above background was observed in the control experiment when the sense RNA probe was used (Figure 6P). In summary, GRP23 is expressed preferentially both in gametophytes and in embryos and endosperm cells during embryogenesis. This expression pattern of GRP23 is in agreement with its essential role during early embryogenesis. In addition, its expression in meristematic cells suggests that GRP23 plays a role in actively dividing cells during vegetative development. To further investigate the biochemical function of GRP23, a two-hybrid screen was performed using the full-length GRP23 coding sequence fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait (pBD-GRP23). Of 1.2 × 106 transformants screened, four clones were identified, all of which contained the same gene, encoding the 36-kD subunit III (RBP36B) of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (CITATION). Reconfirming experiments showed that yeast cells cotransformed with pAD-RBP36B and pBD-GRP23 grew well in Trp-, Leu-, and His-dropout medium supplemented with 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4,-triazole (3-AT) (Figure 7 ). Meanwhile, they were able to produce an intense β-galactosidase signal (Figure 7E). In addition, both GRP23 and RBP36B showed a similar expression pattern in planta (Figure 5). These data suggest that GRP23 interacts physically with RBP36B in yeast cells and potentially in plants. [[FIGURE]] We then further identified which domain of GRP23 is required for its interaction with RBP36B. We constructed two deletion fragments of GRP23 (Figure 7A) and analyzed their ability to interact with RBP36B in yeast. The PPR domain (residues 1 to 579) and the WQQ repeat–containing Gln-rich domain (residues 602 to 913) (Figure 7A) were cloned into pGBKT7, giving rise to the plasmids pBD-PPR and pBD-WQQ, respectively. Yeast cells cotransformed with pAD-RBP36B and pBD-WQQ were still able to grow well on selective medium and produced an intense β-galactosidase signal (Figure 7). By contrast, yeast cells co-transformed with pAD-RBP36B and pBD-PPR could not grow on the same selective medium (Figure 7D). These results showed that GRP23 containing only its Gln-rich domain, by deleting the PPR domain, retained the ability to interact with RBP36B, whereas deletion of the Gln-rich domain almost totally abolished this ability. These data indicated that the Gln-rich domain of GRP23 is essential for the interaction with RNA polymerase II subunit III. To further validate the yeast data, we used the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach. BiFC detects protein interactions in living cells by relying on the fluorescence from the split YFP peptide fragments that are brought into close proximity by the two interacting proteins to which they are fused (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The full-length open reading frame sequence of GRP23 was cloned into pUC-SPYNE, and RBP36B was cloned into pUC-SPYCE, to produce GRP23-YFPN and RBP36B-YFPC, respectively. These two constructs were cobombarded into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. If they interact physically, YFP fluorescence would be restored, and YFP fluorescence was indeed observed in the nucleus of onion epidermal cells when cobombarded with GRP23-YFPN and RBP36B-YFPC (Figure 7F). By contrast, YFP fluorescence was never detected in onion epidermal cells when cobombarded with either GRP23-YFPN in combination with pUC-SPYCE or pUC-SPYNE in combination with RBP36B-YFPC (data not shown). These data suggest that GRP23 interacts physically with RNA polymerase II in living onion cells. In conclusion, we provided evidence that the nuclear protein GRP23 can interact physically with RNA polymerase II subunit III through its C-terminal WQQ repeat–containing Gln-rich domain in both yeast and plant cells. Together with the presence of the basic region adjacent to the Leu zipper domain, our data suggest that GRP23 could be a potential transcriptional regulator essential for embryogenesis.
!~MM~! Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Landsberg erecta and Columbia were sterilized with 20% bleach and 70% ethanol for 5 min, respectively, then washed five times in sterilized water and germinated on MS agar plates supplemented as required with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and/or 20 μg/mL hygromycin. Plants were grown at 22 ± 2°C in an air-conditioned greenhouse under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle. Arabidopsis transformation was performed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated vacuum infiltration (CITATION). The genetic screen of grp23 from Ds insertion lines was conducted as described by CITATION. Ds copy number was determined by DNA gel blot hybridization using a 750-bp Ds-5′ fragment as a probe. The T-DNA insertion lines SALK_074740 and SALK_128329 were obtained from the ABRC. PCR amplified by the T-DNA left border primer LBb1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) in combination with the At1g10270-specific primer P224 (5′-ATTGAACCTCCTCTCCAGGCT-3′) was used to confirm T-DNA insertion positions in these two lines. Reciprocal crosses between wild type and the mutant were performed as described (CITATION). To determine the embryo phenotype, siliques from grp23 heterozygous plants were dissected with hypodermic needles and cleared in Herr's solution containing lactic acid:chloral hydrate:phenol:clove oil:xylene (2:2:2:2:1, w/w) (CITATION; CITATION). Embryo and endosperm development was studied microscopically with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics. The number of endosperm nuclei was scored, and the length of suspensor cells was measured carefully. Micrographs were obtained with a Nikon 4500 digital camera. Besides the embryonic phenotype, the morphology of the mutant plants in other tissues, including root, stem, and leaf, was also observed carefully. The Ds flanking sequences were isolated by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). To conduct the complementation experiment, a 5577-bp GRP23 genome fragment from 2262 bp upstream of the ATG start codon to 576 bp downstream of the TAG stop condon was amplified by LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) using primers P-2262B (5′-TGTTGGATCCCTAGGAGCTTTACATTCAGAAG-3′) and P3315B (5′-CCGTGGATCCCTCCTTCTGCCTTAGCTCCTCTTA-3′). The resulting fragment was cloned into pCAMBIA1300 (http://www.cambia.org.au) to produce p1300-GRP23G. After sequence verification, this construct was introduced into heterozygous set09078 mutant plants by Agrobacterium infiltration (CITATION). Transformants were obtained by double selection on MS agar plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 20 μg/mL hygromycin. T1 plants were allowed to set seed after self-fertilization. Siliques were dissected and cleared with Herr's solution (CITATION) to study the restoration of the embryo-lethal phenotype. A 763-bp EYFP fragment released from pEYFP (Clontech) by XbaI digestion was cloned into pWM101 [M. Xia, unpublished data; the 35S enhancer promoter and poly(A) were inserted into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pCAMBIA1300] to give rise to pWM-YFP. The full-length coding sequence of GRP23 was amplified by RT-PCR using primers P1B (5′-CTGGGATCCATGTCTCTCAGTCACCTCCTC-3′) and P2739B (5′-GAGTGGATCCAAGCAGTTCCTCAACTCCACTACC-3′). The resulting fragment was then cloned into pWM-YFP at the BamHI site (underlined) in the correct direction to yield P35S-GRP23-YFP. Transgenic plants expressing the fusion gene were selected on MS agar plates containing 20 μg/mL hygromycin. YFP images of the transgenic root cells were captured with confocal laser scanning microscopy with a Zeiss confocal microscope. A 514-nm argon laser and a 560- to 600-nm filter were set for YFP scanning. DAPI staining and scanning were performed as described previously (CITATION). Total RNA was isolated from Landsberg erecta plants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was digested with RNase-free DNase (TaKaRa) and used as a template to transcribe single-stranded cDNA by reverse transcriptase XL (TaKaRa). One microliter of the synthesized cDNA was used for PCR. Mock control experiments without reverse transcription were also performed to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. For the GRP23 amplification, the primers P1 (5′-ATGTCTCTCAGTCACCTCCTC-3′) and P676 (5′-TGAGCGTTGATGATCTGATTGT-3′) were used, and primers 5′-CAGAGTCGTCAGAAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GACTGCCACTTTACATGTTGC-3′ were used to amplify RBP36B. Similarly, the ACTIN2 primers 5′-GAAGATTAAGGTCGTTGCACCACCTG-3′ and 5′-ATTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGGT-3′ were used as internal controls. After 35 cycles of amplification, PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The fragment containing 2718 bp upstream of the ATG start codon plus the first 347 bp of the exon and the fragment containing the 576-bp sequence downstream of the TAG stop codon were amplified by PCR with primer pairs P-2262B (5′-TGTTGGATCCCTAGGAGCTTTACATTCAGAAG-3′), P347B (5′-GATCGGATCCGAGAGCGTGGAGAGGAGGTTCAAT-3′) and P2718S (5′-ACAAGAGCTCAAGGTAGTGGAGTTGAGGAAC-3′), P3315S (5′-CCGTGAGCTCCTCCTTCTGCCTTAGCTCCTCTTA-3′), respectively. The resulting productions were cloned into the pBI101 vector at BamHI and SacI sites (underlined) in the correct directions to produce the PGRP23-GUS fusion construct. This construct was introduced into Arabidopsis wild-type plants by Agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on MS agar plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and stained in GUS staining buffer (10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mM Fe2+CN, 4 mM Fe3+CN, and 1 mg/mL X-Gluc [Sigma-Aldrich] in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) for 3 d at 37°C. For ovules, stained pistils were cleared in 20% lactic acid and 20% glycerol, then observed with a Zeiss microscope and documented with a Nikon 4500 camera. For whole plants, stained seedlings were first decolorized with 95% ethanol and then observed and photographed with an Olympus SZX12 microscope equipped with a camera. For probe labeling, a 676-bp GRP23 cDNA fragment was amplified using primer P1 (5′-ATGTCTCTCAGTCACCTCCTC-3′) in combination with P676 (5′-TGAGCGTTGATGATCTGATTGT-3′) and cloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega) to produce pT-GRP23. After sequence verification, the pT-GRP23 was linearized by NcoI digestion for antisense RNA probes and by SalI digestion for sense RNA probes. Antisense and sense probes were transcribed in vitro with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, and labeled using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche). Siliques were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid, and 50% alcohol and processed according to CITATION. Seven-micrometer-thick sections were used for hybridization. Prehybridization, hybridization, washing, antibody staining, and signal detection were performed as described previously (CITATION). The signal was observed with a Zeiss microscope using differential interference contrast optics and photographed with a Nikon 4500 camera. We performed the screen essentially as described previously (CITATION). We used the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7C [MATa ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 gal4-542 gal80-538 LYS2∷GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3 URA3∷GAL4 17mers(×3)-CyC1TATA-LacZ], which contains the two reporter genes LacZ and HIS3. Yeast cells were first transformed with pBD-GRP23, a plasmid containing the full-length GRP23 coding sequence fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the pGBKT7 vector (a TPR1 selection marker). Then, they were sequentially transformed with the Arabidopsis cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD-GH (a LEU2 selection marker). This cDNA library, containing ∼1.2 × 106 primary recombinants in pGAD-GH, was constructed from mRNAs isolated from Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta suspension cells using a commercial kit (Stratagene). The transformed cells were plated on synthetic dropout selection medium that lacked Trp, Leu, and His supplemented with 5 mM 3-AT to reduce the appearance of false-positive colonies. Then, the plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 to 8 d. β-Galactosidase activities were assayed as described (CITATION). To create pBD-GRP23, the open reading frame of GRP23 was amplified by PCR using the primers P2B (5′-CTGGGATCCTGTCTCTCAGTCACCTCCTC-3′) and P2739B (5′-GAGTGGATCCAAGCAGTTCCTCAACTCCACTACTACC-3′). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the single BamHI (underlined) site of pGBKT7 in the correct direction. Similarly, the coding sequences of the PPR domain and the WQQ repeat–containing Gln-rich domain of GRP23 were amplified using primers P2B (5′-CTGGGATCCTGTCTCTCAGTCACCTCCTC-3′) in combination with P2186B (5′-TGATGGATCCCCGCAGCACAGTAGTAA-3′) and P2255B (5′-TTGAGGATCCTTGCCCGGCCGGTTAGAAA-3′) in combination with P2739B (5′-GAGTGGATCCAAGCAGTTCCTCAACTCCACTACTACC-3′), respectively. The fragments were cloned into the single BamHI (underlined) site of pGBKT7 in the correct directions, giving rise to plasmids pBD-PPR and pBD-WQQ, respectively. We performed BiFC assays in vivo as described (CITATION). The open reading frame sequence of GRP23 was amplified by PCR with primers P1B (5′-CTGGGATCCATGTCTCTCAGTCACCTCCTC-3′) and P2739X (5′-TGTCCTCGAGGTTCCTCAACTCCACTACC-3′) and cloned into the plasmid pUC-SPYNE in the BamHI and XhoI sites (underlined), thus resulting in the plasmid pUC-SPYNE-GRP23 expressed as the GRP23-YFPN fusion protein. Coding sequences of RBP36B (primers 5′-GCTAGGATCCCCAGAGTCGTCAGAAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GATTCTCGAGTTCACGCATATGGGCACCG-3′) were also obtained by PCR and cloned into the plasmid pUC-SPYCE at the BamHI and XhoI sites (underlined) to give rise to the plasmid pUC-SPYCE-RBP36B expressed as the RBP36B-YFPC fusion protein. pUC-SPYNE-GRP23 in combination with pUC-SPYCE-RBP36B were coated with gold particles, as were controls. The onion (Allium cepa) epidermis was peeled and bombarded using a gene gun (PDS-100/He BiolistiK particle delivery system; Bio-Rad). Then, the bombarded samples were incubated on MS plates at 22°C for 24 h. Cells with YFP fluorescence were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy as described previously. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers NM_100901 for GRP23 (At1g10270) and NM_127100 for RBP36B (At2g15400).
