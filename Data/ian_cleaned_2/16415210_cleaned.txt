!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) orthologs of Brca2, a protein whose mutations are involved in breast cancer in humans, were previously shown to be essential at meiosis. In an attempt to better understand the Brca2-interacting properties, we examined four partners of the two isoforms of Brca2 identified in Arabidopsis (AtRad51, AtDmc1, and two AtDss1 isoforms). The two Brca2 and the two Dss1 isoforms are named AtBrca2(IV), AtBrca2(V), AtDss1(I), and AtDss1(V) after their chromosomal localization. We first show that both AtBrca2 proteins can interact with either AtRad51 or AtDmc1 in vitro, and that the N-terminal region of AtBrca2 is responsible for these interactions. More specifically, the BRC motifs (so called because iterated in the Brca2 protein) in Brca2 are involved in these interactions: BRC motif number 2 (BRC2) alone can interact with AtDmc1, whereas BRC motif number 4 (BRC4) recognizes AtRad51. The human Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins themselves can interact with either the complete (HsRad51) or a shorter version of AtBrca2 (HsRad51 or HsDmc1) that comprises all four BRC motifs. We also identified two Arabidopsis isoforms of Dss1, another known partner of Brca2 in other organisms. Although all four Brca2 and Dss1 proteins are much conserved, AtBrca2(IV) interacts with only one of these AtDss1 proteins, whereas AtBrca2(V) interacts with both of them. Finally, we show for the first time that an AtBrca2 protein could bind two different partners at the same time: AtRad51 and AtDss1(I), or AtDmc1 and AtDss1(I).
!~RES~! A typical feature of the Brca2 proteins is their ability to interact with Rad51, which was previously observed for both Arabidopsis Brca2(IV) and Brca2(V) protein isoforms in a yeast two-hybrid procedure (CITATION). A truncated 784-amino-acid-long N-terminal version of AtBrca2(IV), AtBrca2(IV)Nter (Fig. 1A ; previously called AtBrca2(IV)FS by CITATION), was also produced in the course of this work. This shorter AtBrca2(IV) comprises all four BRC domains, which was found to be sufficient for it to bind AtRad51 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (CITATION). This property of AtBrca2 was further examined by conducting coimmunoprecipitation assays between the protein products of AtBRCA2 and AtRAD51 in vitro transcribed and translated with adequate tags (Fig. 1B). Thus, we could use specific binding of one or the other target protein. We could then determine whether it bound a potential interacting partner after pairwise in vitro incubation. Following incubation of a c-myc-tagged Brca2 protein in the presence of hemaglutinin (HA)-tagged Rad51 protein, c-myc antibodies retained a complex that could be separated into two bands on a SDS-PAGE gel: one band migrated at the c-myc-AtBrca2 expected size [126.6 kD or 127.2 kD for AtBrca2(IV) and AtBrca2(V), respectively, plus 2.3 kD due to the c-myc tag], while the other band migrated at the HA-AtRad51 expected size (39.3 kD; Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5). Incubation of the truncated c-myc-AtBrca2(IV)Nter protein (85.6 kD) with HA-tagged AtRad51 similarly led to coimmunoprecipitation of both proteins in the presence of anti-c-myc antibodies (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Reciprocally, the same result was obtained if HA antibodies were used to bind the resulting complex following in vitro incubation. When c-myc-tagged Brca2 or HA-tagged Rad51 were subjected to, respectively, HA antibodies or c-myc antibodies, no protein was found to be retained following SDS-PAGE migration of the reaction product and autoradiography. Faint bands of smaller sizes, which were not seen after in vitro protein synthesis (Fig. 1B), could also be detected that may correspond to protein degradation occurring in the course of the coimmunoprecipitation experiment. Altogether, our data indicate that each AtBrca2 protein, as well as the truncated AtBrca2(IV)Nter, can coimmunoprecipitate with AtRad51 (Fig. 1B). [[FIGURE]] Using the yeast two-hybrid procedure, we previously identified AtDmc1 as a new Brca2-interacting partner. The interaction between the in vitro translated AtBrca2(IV) or (V) and AtDmc1 was similarly confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Following incubation of a c-myc-tagged Brca2 protein in the presence of HA-tagged Dmc1 protein, c-myc antibodies retained a complex comprising two proteins that migrated on a SDS-PAGE gel at the sizes predicted for c-myc-AtBrca2 and HA-AtDmc1 (39.5 kD; Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 8). In a similar assay, AtBrca2(IV)Nter coimmunoprecipitates with AtDmc1, thus restricting the Dmc1-interacting domain of AtBrca2 to its N-terminal region, in which the BRC motifs are located (Fig. 1C, lane 7). Neither AtRad51 nor AtDmc1 interacted with c-myc-AtBrca2(V)Cter, a C-terminal version of AtBrca2(V) in which the BRC motifs region was eliminated (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 9 and 10). The interactions between AtBrca2 and AtRad51 or between AtBrca2 and AtDmc1 were evidenced in the absence of any other Arabidopsis proteins, and were not affected by a DNase or RNase treatment prior to the incubation step (data not shown). Following incubation of AtRad51 and AtDmc1 in various pairwise combinations, we also established that these proteins could interact in vitro in homotypic or heterotypic combinations. These interactions had previously been observed using the yeast two-hybrid procedure but required further examination (CITATION). Upon binding of the c-myc-tagged AtRad51 onto the Sepharose column, HA-tagged AtRad51 could be coimmunoprecipitated, and, similarly, a c-myc-tagged AtDmc1 allowed coimmunoprecipitation of HA-AtDmc1, evidence of their polymerization properties. After immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluate, only one band was visible around 39 kD. The presence of both tagged proteins in this unique band was ascertained by western blot, using anti-tag antibodies (data not shown). A similar approach was used to analyze the ability of AtRad51 and AtDmc1 to assemble in vitro. HA-tagged Dmc1 retained c-myc-tagged AtRad51 in the presence of anti-HA antibodies, and, reciprocally, c-myc-AtDmc1 retained HA-AtRad51. AtRad51 and AtDmc1 are very similar in term of molecular mass (37.3 kD and 37.5 kD respectively). Nevertheless, their migration patterns can be distinguished, which allowed us to ascertain their assembly in a heterotypic fashion (Fig. 2A ). [[FIGURE]] A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to investigate the ability of the human Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins to recognize and interact with the Arabidopsis proteins. Interactions were effective between AtRad51 and either HsRad51 or HsDmc1 (Fig. 2B), suggesting enough conservation among species to allow heterologous interactions. In mammals, the BRC repeats are involved in the interaction of Brca2 with Rad51 (CITATION; CITATIONb; CITATION; CITATION). Since an interaction between Brca2 and Dmc1 has never been described in any other organism than Arabidopsis (to our knowledge), there is no clue about the region of Brca2 that is involved in binding to Dmc1. However, the conserved protein structure between Dmc1 and Rad51 (CITATION) led us to examine whether Brca2 and Dmc1 could, as in the case of Rad51, interact via the BRC domains region. A 734-bp region was defined between nucleotides (nts) 175 and 909 of the AtBRCA2(IV) cDNA, comprising all four BRC repeats, and cloned in frame with the Gal4 activation domain (AD) and binding domain (BD) of the yeast vectors pGAD424 and pGBT9 (Fig. 3A ). In a yeast two-hybrid assay, this BRC repeats-containing region was sufficient to allow binding of not only AtRad51 or AtDmc1, but also HsRad51 and HsDmc1 (Fig. 3D). [[FIGURE]] To further extend our understanding of the Brca2-interacting properties, we examined whether a BRC motif peptide could prevent AtBrca2 from interacting with either Rad51 or Dmc1. In human breast cancer cells, expression of BRC motifs can disrupt the formation of Brca2-Rad51 complexes (CITATION). Similarly, incubation of the BRC motif number 3 (BRC3), from the human Brca2, with Rad51 prevents nucleoprotein filament formation by Rad51 (CITATION). We used this same human BRC3 motif in our experiments (Fig. 3B). The interactions observed between AtBrca2 and HsRad51 or a four-BRC motifs region (Fig. 3D) and either HsRad51 or HsDmc1 suggested that conservation of the BRC motifs allowed their binding to heterologous proteins, and, consequently, that a human BRC motif could eventually perturb the interactions between AtBrca2 and AtRad51 or AtDmc1. The human BRC3 peptide was thus introduced in the coimmunoprecipitation assays in an attempt to compete out the interaction between AtRad51 or AtDmc1 and AtBrca2. In these experiments, 35S-Met-radiolabeled AtBrca2(IV) was used as a substrate for HA-AtRad51 (or HA-AtDmc1) binding. When AtRad51 was preincubated with no (Fig. 3C, lane 1) or 1 μg (Fig. 3C, lane 2) of the human BRC3 peptide prior to the addition of AtBrca2, we obtained two bands after elution, SDS-PAGE migration, and visualization by autoradiography. These bands corresponded to the AtBrca2(IV) and the HA-tagged AtRad51 predicted sizes. However, when AtRad51 was preincubated with 5 μg of the BRC3 peptide, no AtBrca2 binding could be detected. Only one band at the predicted size for HA-AtRad51 was eluted in this assay, proving that the ability of AtBrca2 to bind AtRad51 was abolished. This amount of BRC3 corresponds to a 10-fold molar excess of peptide over AtRad51 and AtBrca2 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). In human, mutations of BRC3 in key positions prevent its binding with HsRad51 (CITATION). Five micrograms of the mutated T1430A and D1420Y BRC3 peptides did not prevent the interaction between AtRad51 and AtBrca2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5). In a similar assay, preincubation of HA-AtDmc1 with 5 μg of the wild-type HsBRC3 motif did not affect binding of HA-AtDmc1 to AtBrca2. We thus examined whether any of the Arabidopsis Brca2 single BRC motifs could bind AtRad51 or AtDmc1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. As in human, the BRC motifs in AtBrca2 were numbered after their order of occurrence in the Arabidopsis protein (Fig. 3A), which does not mean that their sequence is closer to similarly numbered motifs of the human protein. The two BRC2 motifs are divergent, thus both were tested, while BRC1, BRC3, and BRC4 are identical in AtBrca2(IV) and AtBrca2(V) (Fig. 3B). An interaction was clearly evidenced between BRC2 of AtBrca2(IV) and AtDmc1 (but not AtRad51), or BRC4 and AtRad51. These interactions were eliminated when a Thr-to-Ala amino acid change was introduced at a key position (Fig. 3, B and D). The motifs involved in the fixation of Rad51 (BRC4) or Dmc1 (BRC2) are the minimum sufficient domains we could define for this interaction. When combined with other domains, an interaction is thus also obtained. We examined different combinations of the BRC repeats (Fig. 3D) and evidenced that the BRC1-BRC2 combination binds AtDmc1 and HsRad51. BRC2-BRC3, BRC3-BRC4, and BRC1-BRC2-BRC3 bind AtRad51, AtDmc1, and HsRad51 as well. Autoactivation of the BRC2 + BRC3 + BRC4 combination in the absence of any partner prevents interpretation of data with this particular construct. As previously mentioned, the whole four-motif region of Brca2 (BRC1-BRC2-BRC3-BRC4) is required for the interaction with HsDmc1. Not surprisingly, this last combination also interacts with AtRad51, AtDmc1, and HsRad51 (Fig. 3D). Two potential Dss1-encoding sequences were identified in the Arabidopsis genome named AtDSS1(I) (At1g64750) and AtDSS1(V) (At5g45010) after their chromosomal localization. Both AtDSS1 genomic DNA sequences comprise two exons and one 550-nt-long intron. Using specific primers, two different AtDSS1 cDNAs were isolated via reverse transcription-PCR that correspond to either the chromosome I (222 nt) or the chromosome V (219 nt) DSS1 cDNAs, thus revealing that both genomic sequences are transcriptionally active. These cDNAs share 90.7% identity and encode, respectively, for 74-amino-acid- (I) and 73-amino-acid-long (V) putative proteins, which are 88% identical to each other and show high conservation with their human, fungus, and yeast counterparts (Fig. 4A ). [[FIGURE]] The AtDSS1 coding sequences were fused in frame to the AD and BD of the yeast two-hybrid vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7. Potential interactions were examined between the two AtBrca2 and AtDss1 coding sequences following their introduction in pairwise combinations into the same yeast reporter strains. The assay indicated potential interactions between AtBrca2(V) and AtDss1(I) or AtDss1(V), and also between AtBrca2(IV) and AtDss1(I). No interaction was observed between AtBrca2(IV) and AtDss1(V), or between Nter-AtBrca2(IV) and AtDss1(I) or AtDss1(V) (Fig. 4B). We analyzed the in vitro interactions between the corresponding proteins in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4C). When coimmunoprecipitation was realized with c-myc-AtBrca2(V) and HA-AtDss1(I) or (V) in the presence of anti-c-myc antibodies (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2), two bands were eluted, one at the predicted size for c-myc-AtBrca2(V) and one at 11 kD [either HA-AtDss1(I) or (V)]. When we immunoprecipitated c-myc-AtBrca2(IV) and HA-AtDss1(I) in the presence of anti-c-myc antibodies, we eluted two bands around 129 and 11 kD (Fig. 4C, lane 5), whereas we obtained only one band around 129 kD when we immunoprecipitated c-myc-AtBrca2(IV) and HA-AtDss1(V) in the presence of anti-c-myc antibodies (Fig. 4C, lane 6). When the assay was performed with c-myc-AtBrca2(IV)Nter and HA-AtDss1(I) or (V) in the presence of anti-c-myc antibodies, only one band at 88 kD [c-myc-AtBrca2(IV)Nter] was obtained (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that AtBrca2(V) is able to interact with both AtDss1(I) and (V), whereas AtBrca2(IV) only interacts with AtDss1(V) in vitro. The Nter-truncated version of AtBrca2(IV) is unable to interact with AtDss1(V), indicating that amino acids that are key to binding Dss1 must be present beyond amino acid 784 in AtBrca2. A coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed after incubating together all three in vitro-translated proteins: AtBrca2(V), HA-AtRad51, and AtDss1(I). HA antibodies were used to bind the interacting complex. SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction products indicated three well defined bands that migrated at the expected sizes for AtBrca2(V), HA-tagged AtRad51, and AtDss1(I) (Fig. 5 , lane 1). Since the AtRad51 protein alone had proven unable to bind AtDss1(I) (Fig. 5, lane 3), AtBrca2(V) and AtDss1(I) were thus both retained by HA-AtRad51 binding in this particular assay. Following the same experimental strategy, we also obtained evidence that AtBrca2(V) is able to bind both AtDmc1 and AtDss1(I) (Fig. 5, lane 2). AtDss1 and AtDmc1 cannot directly interact (as shown in Fig. 5, lane 4). Our results establish that AtBrca2(V) can interact with both Rad51 and Dss1(I) or both Dmc1 and Dss1(I) in a tripartite complex. [[FIGURE]] This tripartite interaction is not observed in the presence of the truncated AtBrca2(V)Cter form. When HA-AtRad51, c-myc-AtDss1(I), and c-myc-AtBrca2(V)Cter were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA-antibodies, only one band around 37 kD was eluted (Fig. 5, lane 7). Similar results were obtained with HA-Dmc1, c-myc-AtDss1(I), and c-myc-AtBrca2(V)Cter (Fig. 5, lane 8). We previously observed that AtBrca2(V)Cter can bind AtDss1(I) or (V) (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6), thus indicating that this truncated version of AtBrca2 is still partially functional. These experiments clearly show that AtRad51 or AtDmc1 cannot directly interact with AtDss1, but that a three-partner complex can exist in the presence of a full-length AtBrca2 protein.
!~MM~! One microgram of total RNA extracted from a 2-d freshly subcultured cell suspension of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was reverse transcribed by the MMLV reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) primers and in the presence of dNTPs in a final volume of 20 μL. PCR was performed, using Dss1(I)- or (V)-specific primers (I-Nter ATCGTGAATTCATGGCGGCAGAACCGAAGGCAGCG; I-Cter GCTTAGTCGACTTATTTCTTGTCAGTACCATTCTC; V-Nter ATCGTGAATTCATGGCGGCAGAACCCAAGGCAGCT; V-Cter GCTTAGTCGACTCATTTCTTCTCACTAGCATTC) with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were cloned in frame with the BD and AD domains of pGBKT7 (EcoRI and SmaI sites) and pGADT7 (EcoRI and SalI sites; CLONTECH). The BRC motifs, in single or multiple combinations, were isolated by performing PCR reactions with different sets of primers using BRCA2(IV) or BRCA2(V) cDNAs as a matrix (CITATION): BRC1 (B1F GTGGAATTCCGGGAAGAAGCGATGCCTGGG × B1R GTGCTGCAGGGGAATTGAGCAATTTGTGTT), BRC2 (B2F GTGGAATTCAGACAAGTGGATACAGCTGAA × B2R GTGCTGCAGTCCACTCTCCCTGGGAAGAACGTT), BRC3 (B3F GTGGAATTCAGGGAGAGTGGATTTGGAGTT × B3R GTGCTGCAGAGACGACTGGTTCACATGGTT), BRC4 (B4F GTGGAATTCTTAAATCCATCTTTAAAGGTG × GTGCTGCAGTTGATCACCTCCAGCTACATC), BRC1 + BRC2 (B1F × B2R), BRC2 + BRC3 (B2F × B3R), BRC3 + BRC4 (B3F + B4R), BRC1 + BRC2 + BRC3 (B1F × B3R), BRC2 + BRC3 + BRC4 (B2F × B4R), and BRC1 + BRC2 + BRC3 + BRC4 (B1F × B4R). Mutations were introduced in motifs BRC2 and BRC4 using the following primers: B2F(m) GTGGAATTCAGACAAGTGGATACAGCTGAAACTTTGCCAATGTTCAGGGCGGCCT and B4F(m) GTGGAATTCTTAAATCCATCTTTAAAGGTGCCTCCAACAAAGTTTCAGGCTGCTGGT, which turned a consensus Thr into Ala. PCR products previously described were cloned in frame with the DB and AD of pGBT9 (EcoRI and PstI sites) and verified by sequencing. HsRad51 and HsDmc1 were provided by S. West (CITATION). AtRAD51, AtDMC1, AtBRCA2(IV), AtBRCA2(IV)Nter, and AtBRCA2(V) cDNAs sequences were introduced in pGAD424 and pGBT9 (CLONTECH), and yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted as described (CITATION). The BRCA2(IV), BRCA2(V), and AtBRCA2(IV)Nter cDNA sequences in plasmids pGAD424 and pGBT9 (CLONTECH) were used as matrix to in vitro transcribe and translate the relevant proteins. Primer pairs were designed to PCR amplify a fragment containing the expression domain of the vectors, adding a HA tag (pGAD-HA-up AAAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAGCCGCCACCATGTACCCATACGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTCCACCAAACCCAAAAAAAGAG and pGAD-HA-do ACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGAT) or a c-myc tag (pGBT9-c-myc-up AAAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAGCCGCCACCATGGAGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGGGTCAAAGACAGTTGACTGTATCG and pGBT9-c-myc-do TACCTGAGAAAGCAACCTGACCTACAGG) 3′ to the cDNAs. Primer was designed to amplify BRCA2 cDNA from the 1,070th bp to the end, to delete the N-terminal region containing the BRC domains (pGBT9-cmyc C-ter: AAAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAGCCGCCACCATGGAGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGAACTTGGAGAACCTAGCTTCAGGGGGT). When used with the pGBT9-c-myc-do oligonucleotides, the amplified fragment contains the expression domain of pGBT9 and a c-myc tag in frame with the truncated BRCA2 cDNA. RAD51, DMC1, DSS1(I) and (V), and each AtBRCA2 cDNA sequence cloned into plasmids pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) were used as matrix to in vitro produce the proteins. Primer pairs were designed to amplify the cDNAs (pGADT7do, AAGTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACG, and pGBKT7do, CATAAGAAATTCGCCCGG, plus the left border of the vector [pGADT7up, TATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACAAACC, or pGBKT7up, TCATCGGAAGAGAGTAG]). PCR was conducted with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Coupled transcription/translation was performed for each protein with the PCR products as a matrix in the presence of 35S Met (15.1 μCi/ reaction; Redivue, Amersham; TNT T7 Quick for PCR DNA kit, Promega). Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To eliminate DNA or RNA, 5 μL of the translation products were treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen) or RnaseA (Qiagen). Coimmunoprecipitation was conducted with the Matchmaker kit (CLONTECH), using anti-c-myc or anti-HA antibodies and protein A beads, as recommended. Results were analyzed after SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel by autoradiography performed with a Molecular Imager Fx Pro (Bio-Rad). Human BRC3 wild-type and mutant peptides were provided by S. West (CITATION). The lyophilized peptides were resuspended in fresh phosphate-buffered saline, and their concentration was estimated after hot NaOH hydrolysis. In vitro-translated HA-AtRad51 was preincubated for 45 min at room temperature with 0, 1, 3, or 5 μg of human BRC3 peptide. Then AtBrca2 was added, and the mix was further incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Coimmunoprecipitation was then performed using the HA antibodies as recommended by CLONTECH. The assay results were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers AJ619975 [for Dss1(I)] and AJ619976 [for Dss1(V)].
