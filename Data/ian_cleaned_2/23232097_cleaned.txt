!~ABS~! Protein ubiquitination is a reversible process catalyzed by ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs). We report the identification and characterization of UBP16 in Arabidopsis thaliana. UBP16 is a functional ubiquitin-specific protease and its enzyme activity is required for salt tolerance. Plants lacking UBP16 were hypersensitive to salt stress and accumulated more sodium and less potassium. UBP16 positively regulated plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiport activity. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a putative target of UBP16, SERINE HYDROXYMETHYLTRANSFERASE1 (SHM1), which has previously been reported to be involved in photorespiration and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. We found that SHM1 is degraded in a 26S proteasome–dependent process, and UBP16 stabilizes SHM1 by removing the conjugated ubiquitin. Ser hydroxymethyltransferase activity is lower in the ubp16 mutant than in the wild type but higher than in the shm1 mutant. During salt stress, UBP16 and SHM1 function in preventing cell death and reducing reactive oxygen species accumulation, activities that are correlated with increasing Na+/H+ antiport activity. Overexpression of SHM1 in the ubp16 mutant partially rescues its salt-sensitive phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that UBP16 is involved in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis by modulating sodium transport activity and repressing cell death at least partially through modulating SMH1stability and activity.
!~RES~! We previously reported a systematic analysis of the UBP gene family in Arabidopsis (CITATION). To further determine the specific function of each At-UBP member, T-DNA mutants were analyzed for their growth in response to salt. The ubp16 mutant exhibited reduced salt tolerance. The T-DNA insertion in this mutant (ubp16/SALK_023552) is located in the sixth exon of UBP16 and was confirmed by PCR using a UBP16-specific primer and the T-DNA left border primer. The absence of full-length UBP16 transcript in the ubp16 mutant was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1A). [[FIGURE]] When 5-d-old mutant and wild-type (Columbia-0 [Col-0]) seedlings were transferred to Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 100 mM NaCl, primary root growth of ubp16 was indistinguishable from Col-0; however, shoot tissues showed a significant reduction in growth (Figure 1B). At this concentration of salt, fresh weight in the mutant decreased 30% compared with growth in Col-0 (Figure 1C). When seedlings were grown on 120 mM NaCl, growth inhibition was more pronounced and root growth was also inhibited (Figures 1B and 1C). To complement the ubp16 salt-sensitive phenotype, a 7664-bp genomic DNA fragment (corresponding to the sequence from 1930 bp upstream of the UBP16 translation start codon to 698 bp downstream of the stop codon) was cloned into the pCAMBIA1200 vector. The resulting construct was transformed into the ubp16 mutant. T3 transgenic lines treated with salt demonstrated that the transgene rescued the mutant phenotype to wild-type salt tolerance (Figures 1D and 1E). These results demonstrate that the NaCl sensitivity of ubp16 is due to loss of UBP16 function. The transcription levels of UBP16 in the transgenic lines were similar to or lower than levels in Col-0 (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). The salt-sensitive phenotype of ubp16 was also observed in soil when plants were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 2 weeks. Under these conditions, shoot growth and chlorophyll content were significantly reduced (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1C online). Among members of the At-UBP family, UBP16 shares the highest sequence similarity with UBP17 (see Supplemental Figure 2A and Supplemental Data Set 1 online). However, the ubp16 ubp17 double mutant was not more sensitive to salt than the ubp16 single mutant (see Supplemental Figures 2B and 2C online), suggesting that UBP16 and UBP17 do not function redundantly in response to salt. To determine whether ubp16 is specifically sensitive to Na+, Col-0 and ubp16 seedlings were treated with 100 mM KCl, 100 mM NaNO3, 10 mM LiCl, or 3 mM CsCl. The ubp16 mutant was sensitive to 100 mM NaNO3 and 10 mM LiCl but did not show significant reductions in growth on medium containing 100 mM KCl or 3 mM CsCl, suggesting that ubp16 is specifically sensitive to Na+ but not K+ or Cl− (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). To determine if expression of UBP16 is regulated by exposure to salt, total RNA was extracted from Col-0 plants treated for 6 h with 100 mM NaCl or 20 µM ABA. The expression of UBP16 was induced by NaCl but not ABA treatment as determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis. As a control, the DREB1A transcription factor was included and its expression was induced by both NaCl and ABA treatments (Figure 1F). UBP16 was expressed in flowers, siliques, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, stems, and roots (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). UBP16 promoter activity was analyzed using 1930 bp of the UBP16 promoter fused to the β-GLUCURONIDASE (GUS) reporter gene. The resulting constructs were transformed into the Col-0 background. For each construct, 12 independent T2 transgenic lines were analyzed for GUS staining. Consistent with the real-time RT-PCR results, GUS expression driven by the UBP16 promoter was strong in flowers, siliques, and leaves and weak in roots (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). UBP subfamily proteins contain a conserved Cys box that is essential for their DUB activity (Figure 2A) (CITATION). To determine if UBP16 possesses DUB enzyme activity, UBP16 was translationally fused to a maltose binding protein tag. A mutated form of UBP16 in which the conserved catalytic Cys at residue 551 (Cys-551) was changed to Ser was created as a control. The two constructs were coexpressed with polyhistidine-tagged UBIQUITIN EXTENSION PROTEIN1 (UBQ1; a model substrate) in Escherichia coli. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-Ub antibody showed that UBP16 cleaved UBQ1 but UBP16Cys551Ser did not, suggesting that UBP16 is a DUB and that Cys-551 is essential for its DUB activity (Figure 2B). To further determine if the DUB activity of UBP16 is required for its function in salt tolerance, a Cys551Ser mutation was generated in UBP16 based on the UBP16 complementation plasmid, and the resulting construct was transformed into the ubp16 mutant. When T3 transgenic lines were treated with salt, lines expressing the mutated UBP16 gene did not rescue the salt-sensitive phenotype of the ubp16 mutant (Figures 2C and 2D), even though the mutated gene was expressed at a similar level to UBP16 in Col-0 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). When used as a control, wild-type UBP16 was found to rescue the mutant phenotype (Figures 2C and 2D). [[FIGURE]] To examine if Na+/K+ homeostasis is impaired in the ubp16 mutant during salt stress, 3-week-old soil-grown Col-0 and ubp16 plants were exposed to 150 mM NaCl for 10 d, and Na+ and K+ content was measured. Na+ content increased in both plants and was significantly higher in ubp16 than in Col-0 (Figure 3A). By contrast, K+ content was significantly lower in ubp16 than in Col-0 under control conditions and decreased in both plants after NaCl treatment (Figure 3A). These results suggest that UBP16 inhibits Na+ accumulation and enhances K+ accumulation. To determine if PM Na+/H+ antiport activity is altered in the ubp16 mutant, PM vesicles were isolated from mutant and wild-type seedlings treated with 250 mM NaCl for 3 d. Na+/H+ antiport activity was significantly lower in ubp16 plants than in Col-0 plants at all concentrations of NaCl assayed (Figures 3B and 3C). These data demonstrate that UBP16 is required for the regulation of PM Na+/H+ antiport activity. [[FIGURE]] Because the ubp16 mutant accumulated less K+ than Col-0 even in control conditions (Figure 3A), we determined if growth of the ubp16 mutant is altered under low K+ conditions. Five-day-old akt1 (an AKT1 K+ channel mutant), cipk23 (a mutant in CALCINEURIN B-LIKE-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE23, a regulator of AKT1) and a CIPK23 overexpression line (all of which have been characterized for their responses in low K+ conditions; CITATION), along with the ubp16 mutant and Col-0 plants, were transferred to low K+ medium containing 100 or 140 µM KCl. Consistent with previous reports, akt1 and cipk23 were more sensitive and the CIPK23 overexpression line was more tolerant to these conditions than the wild type. Under these conditions, growth of the ubp16 mutant was not significantly different than the growth of Col-0 (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). It has been shown that SCaBP8 functions mainly in shoot tissue to protect Arabidopsis from salt stress by interacting with SOS2 and activating SOS1 in the PM (CITATION; CITATION). The ubp16 mutant was less sensitive to NaCl than scabp8 but had a similar pattern of growth defect (Figure 4A). To determine if UBP16 interacts genetically with SCaBP8, a scabp8 T-DNA insertion line (CITATION) was crossed with the ubp16 mutant to generate the ubp16 scabp8 double mutant. Five-day-old seedlings of the wild type and single and double mutants grown on MS medium were transferred to MS medium without or with 50 or 100 mM NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, none of the mutants showed any significant differences in growth compared with the growth of Col-0. In response to 50 or 100 mM NaCl, shoot growth of the ubp16 scabp8 double mutant was more severely reduced than in the ubp16 and scabp8 single mutants (Figures 4A and 4B). When grown in soil and treated with 150 mM NaCl for 3 or 6 weeks, similar reductions in growth were observed (Figure 4C). Consistent with these observations, UBP16 did not interact with either SCaBP8 or SOS2 in yeast two-hybrid assays (see Supplemental Figure 7A online). These results suggest that SCaBP8 and UBP16 function in parallel to regulate the response of the plant to salt. [[FIGURE]] To identify possible targets of UBP16, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using UBP16 as bait. Two positive clones were sequenced and found to be identical to the C termini of At4g37930 and At4g13930, which encode the SHM1 and SHM4 Ser hydroxymethyltransferases, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 7A online). To narrow down the SHM-interacting domain in UBP16, the UBP16 protein was divided into two parts, UBP16-N (amino acids 1 to 500 including a zinc finger domain) and UBP16-C (amino acids 501 to 1008 including a UB C-terminal hydrolase 2 domain). The structures of the peptides are shown in Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 7B online. These fragments of UBP16 were cloned into the pGADT7 vector, and the full-length SHM1 and SHM4 coding sequences were cloned into the pGBKT7 vector. Combinations of UBP16 and SHM1 or SHM4 were cotransformed into yeast strain AH109. Both SHM1 and SHM4 interacted with the C terminus but not N terminus of UBP16 (Figure 5B; see Supplemental Figure 7C online). [[FIGURE]] To determine if this interaction takes place in vivo, SHM1- and SHM4-specific antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with E. coli–expressed SHM1 and SHM4. To evaluate the specificity of the antibodies, total protein was extracted from Col-0, shm1-1 (CITATION), and shm4-1 (SALK_113479, a knockdown mutant; see Supplemental Figure 8A online) and analyzed using immunoblot assays. Strong cross-reaction from both antibodies was detected in Col-0; no cross-reaction was observed in the shm1-1 mutant with the SHM1 antibody, and weak cross-reaction was detected in shm4-1 with the SHM4 antibody (Figure 5C). We then fused three Flag tags in a tandem repeat to the UBP16-N or UBP16-C peptides. The resulting 3×Flag-UBP16-N or 3×Flag-UBP16-C plasmids were transformed into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. The 3×Flag-UBP16-N or 3×Flag-UBP16-C peptides were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG–conjugated agarose, and coimmunoprecipitating proteins were probed with anti-SHM1 or -SHM4 antibodies. The 3×Flag-UBP16-C protein but not the 3×Flag-UBP16-N protein pulled down both SHM1 and SHM4 (Figure 5D), suggesting that UBP16 interacts with SHM1 and SHM4. Together with the results from the yeast two-hybrid assays, our data indicate that UBP16 and SHM1/SHM4 interact in vivo. UBP16 is mainly expressed in shoot tissue (see Supplemental Figures 4A and 4B online), and a mutation in UBP16 resulted in reduced shoot growth in response to salt (Figures 1B to 1D). It has been reported that SHM1 is also mainly expressed in shoots and that the shm1 mutant is sensitive to salt stress (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), while SHM4 is strongly expressed in the root (CITATION). Based on the overlapping expression patterns and mutant phenotypes of UBP16 and SHM1, we focused our studies on the functional interaction between these two proteins. We generated a SHM1 C-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion construct (SHM1-GFP) and both full-length UBP16 N- and C-terminal GFP fusion constructs (GFP-UBP16 and UBP16-GFP) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The resulting constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0. In T3 transgenic plants, the SHM1-GFP signal partially overlapped with the Mito Tracker Red mitochondrial marker (Figure 6A), which is consistent with a previous report (CITATION). More than 100 independent transgenic lines expressing GFP-UBP16 or UBP16-GFP were tested for UBP16 subcellular localization; however, GFP signal was not detectable in any lines. We also expressed these two plasmids transiently in Arabidopsis protoplasts and onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells, but no GFP signal was observed. This lack of expression may be due to the fact that the UBP16 protein is likely too large for the transgene to be expressed in the plant or is degraded by a 26S-independent pathway, as MG132 (a specific 26S proteasome inhibitor) treatment did not lead to recovery of the UBP16 GFP signal. [[FIGURE]] To further confirm that SHM1 is located in the cytoplasm, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were isolated from Col-0 plants and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-SHM1 or anti-SHM4 antibodies. Both SHM1 and SHM4 were detected mainly in the cytosol but were found at a lower level in the mitochondrial fraction (Figure 6B). Using the same protein samples, ACTIN and Cytochrome C were found in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. UBP16 is a Ub-specific protease and interacts with SHM1 in the cytoplasm. To understand the nature of this interaction, we determined if SHM1 levels change in the ubp16 mutant. Protein was extracted from 10-d-old seedlings of Col-0, ubp16, shm1-1, and shm4-1 and analyzed using immunoblot assays. The level of SHM1 protein was significantly reduced in the ubp16 mutant (Figure 7A), while SHM4 protein levels were similar in Col-0 and ubp16 (Figure 7B). In addition, SHM1 but not SHM4 protein levels were further reduced in the mutant and the wild type after 9 h of NaCl treatment (Figure 7C). Based on these results, we used a cell-free system (CITATION) to determine if the reduction of SMH1 in response to salt involves a 26S proteasome–dependent degradation process and whether UBP16 is required for this process. Protein was extracted from Col-0 and ubp16 seedlings expressing either the Pro35S:Flag-HA-SHM1 or Pro35S:Flag-HA-SHM4 transgenes that had been left untreated or were treated with 40 µM MG132, incubated at 22°C for 15, 30, or 60 min, and then analyzed using immunoblot assays with anti-FLAG antibody. SHM1 degraded rapidly in the samples without MG132 treatment; this degradation was significantly reduced with MG132 treatment (Figure 7D). The degradation of SHM1 was even more dramatic in the ubp16 mutant (Figure 7D). SHM4 did not degrade in this assay, and UBP16 did not affect SHM4 stability (Figure 7D). These results suggest that SHM1 undergoes 26S proteasome–dependent degradation and that UBP16 is likely involved in this process. [[FIGURE]] To determine if SHM1 is ubiquitinated in Arabidopsis and if UBP16 plays a role in this ubiquitination/deubiquitination process, Flag-HA-SHM1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody–conjugated agarose from the transgenic plants used in Figure 7D. SHM1 loading was determined with anti-FLAG antibody, and Ub conjugation was detected in the immunoprecipitated products using an anti-Ub antibody. SHM1 was polyubiquitinated in Arabidopsis (Figure 7E), and this Ub conjugation was higher in the ubp16 mutant than in Col-0 (Figure 7E). Pro35S:Flag-HA-SHM1 or Pro35S:Flag-HA-SOS2 (as a control; CITATION) was transformed into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, and transiently expressed Flag-HA-SHM1 and Flag-HA-SOS2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody–conjugated agarose. Immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG or anti-Ub antibody resulted in a ladder of high molecular weight proteins that were detected for SHM1 by both antibodies but not by the anti-Ub antibody for SOS2 (Figure 7F). These results demonstrate that SHM1 is ubiquitinated in planta and that SHM1 deubiquitination involves UBP16. Our studies have shown that SHM1 is found in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Figure 6B). Because ubiquitination is often involved in regulation of protein subcellular localization, we determined if ubiquitination of SHM1 affects its localization. For these assays, mitochondrial fractions were isolated from Col-0 and ubp16 seedlings left untreated or treated with 100 mM NaCl for 9 h. Consistent with previous results, SHM1 protein levels were reduced in the ubp16 mutant, and this reduction became more significant in the mitochondrial fraction in response to NaCl treatment (Figure 7G). To determine whether the reduction of SHM1 in mitochondria is due to degradation or a change in subcellular localization, proteins were separated using Suc gradient centrifugation. Total proteins were extracted from Col-0 and ubp16 plants in mitochondrial isolation buffer, and then protein samples with the same amount SHM1 (determined by immunoblot using anti-SHM1 antibodies) were separated by ultracentrifugation in a linear 5 to 50% Suc gradient. Seventeen fractions were collected (numbered from top to bottom) and analyzed using immunoblot analysis with anti-SHM1, -MAPK3, -VDAC (for VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT ANION-SELECTIVE CHANNEL PROTEIN1), and -Cytochrome C antibodies. SHM1 was observed in fractions 8 to 17 in Col-0 and fractions 7 to 12 in the ubp16 mutant (Figure 7H), and SHM1 protein colocalized with MAPK3, a cytosolic marker. Two mitochondrial markers, VDAC1 and Cytochrome C, were observed in fractions 14 to 17 in both ubp16 and Col-0 (Figure 7H). In these fractions, SHM1 was detected in Col-0 but was largely absent in ubp16 (Figure 7H). MAPK3, VDAC1, and Cytochrome C protein levels were slightly higher in ubp16 than in Col-0 due to the requirement for more total protein for the mutant than for the wild type to equalize the amount of SHM1 protein in both samples. Taken together, these results suggest that UBP16 may be involved in regulating the subcellular localization of SHM1; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced SHM1 stability in the cytosol of the ubp16 mutant causes reduced accumulation of SHM1 in mitochondria. It has been reported that mutations in SHM1 result in sensitivity to salt stress and increased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in leaves in Arabidopsis (CITATION). To determine if the ubp16 mutant has a similar phenotype, we first investigated the H2O2 content in Col-0 and ubp16 by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. The mutant accumulated higher levels of H2O2 than Col-0 after 18 h of treatment with 100 mM NaCl (Figure 8A). Col-0 and ubp16 mutant seedlings were also treated with 100 mM NaCl for 9 and 18 h, and H2O2 content was measured quantitatively with an Amplex Red Kit (Invitrogen). NaCl treatment increased H2O2 content in both the mutant and the wild type, with higher levels of H2O2 in the mutant before and after NaCl treatment (Figure 8B). When Col-0, shm1-1, and ubp16 seeds were germinated on MS medium without or with 50 or 100 mM NaCl, shm1-1 seedlings were smaller and chlorotic even on MS medium without salt. Growth of the shm1-1 mutant was further reduced when seedlings were treated with 50 mM NaCl (Figure 8C), while the shm4-1 mutant did not display any growth inhibition compared with Col-0 when geminated on MS medium with 50 mM NaCl (see Supplemental Figure 8B online). When treated with 100 mM NaCl, growth of the ubp16 mutant was reduced more than growth of the shm1-1 mutant (Figure 8C). These results suggest that UBP16 is involved in salt tolerance partly through modulating SHM1 activity and, at higher NaCl concentrations, through regulating PM Na+/H+ antiport activity. [[FIGURE]] To understand the mechanism by which SHM1 modulates salt tolerance, we monitored trypan blue staining to analyze cell death in Col-0, ubp16, shm1-1, and shm4-1. After treatment with 100 mM NaCl for 24 h, cell death was dramatically induced in shm1-1, with slightly less induction in ubp16 and little induction in Col-0 and shm4-1 (Figure 8D). We found that salt stress–induced cell death in ubp16 and shm1-1 is associated with Cytochrome C release from mitochondria (Figure 8E), a cell death marker (CITATION). The Cytochrome C release was induced in ubp16 and shm1-1 but not in Col-0 by treatment with 100 mM NaCl for 12 h. However, after treatment with 100 mM NaCl for 24 h, a release of Cytochrome C was also detected in Col-0. Treatment with 50 mM NaCl only induced Cytochrome C release from ubp16 and shm1-1 after 24 h of treatment. These results indicate that the cell death induced by salt stress in ubp16 and shm1-1 is associated with Cytochrome C release from mitochondria and that UBP16 regulates salt tolerance at least partially by modulating cell death through SHM1. To determine if SHMT activity is affected in the ubp16 mutant, crude protein extracts were isolated from 10-d-old seedlings of Col-0, shm1-1, and ubp16 and SHMT activity was analyzed following the conversion of radioactive carbon from Ser to methylene tetrahydrofolate (THF) (CITATION) (Figure 9A). Consistent with a previous report (CITATION), SHMT activity decreased dramatically in the shm1-1 mutant compared with Col-0. In the ubp16 mutant, SHMT activity was reduced to a level lower than in Col-0 but higher than in shm1-1 (Figure 9B). SHMT activity was reduced in both Col-0 and ubp16 when seedlings were treated with 100 mM NaCl for 12 h, and the reduction in ubp16 was more significant than in Col-0 (Figure 9C). [[FIGURE]] UBP16 regulates both PM Na+/H+ antiport and SHMT activities. To determine whether these activity changes in the ubp16 mutant are due to the defect in SHM1, we tested if SHM1 directly regulates Na+/H+ antiport activity. PM vesicles were isolated from seedlings of Col-0, shm1-1, and shm4-1 treated with 250 mM NaCl for 3 d, and PM Na+/H+ antiport activity was analyzed. PM Na+/H+ antiport activity in shm1-1 was significantly lower than in Col-0, while activity in shm4-1 was similar to that in Col-0 (Figure 9D; see Supplemental Figures 9A to 9C online). These results indicate that SHM1 positively modulates PM Na+/H+ antiport activity. To further confirm that the downregulation of SHMT by the mutation in UBP16 is important for the ubp16 salt-sensitive phenotype, Pro35S:Flag-HA-SHM1 and Pro35S:Flag-HA-SHM4 constructs were generated and transformed into the ubp16 mutant and Col-0. Overexpression of SHM1 but not SHM4 in the ubp16 mutant partially rescued its salt-sensitive phenotype (Figures 9E and 9F). However, overexpression of SHM1 and SHM4 in Col-0 did not confer additional salt tolerance (see Supplemental Figures 8C and 8D online). Protein levels of SHM1 or SHM4 in Col-0 and ubp16 transgenic plants was similar, as determined by immunoblot analysis with anti-SHM1 or anti-SHM4 antibodies, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 8E online).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 was used as the wild type in all experiments. The homozygous ubp16 mutant was identified from a SALK line (023552) with a T-DNA insertion in the sixth exon of At4g24560. The homozygous ubp17 mutant was identified from a SALK line (087726). The shm1-1 mutant was provided by Carmen Castresana (Campus Universidad Autónoma, Madrid, Spain). The shm4-1 and scabp8 mutants were identified from SALK T-DNA insertion lines 113479 and 056042, respectively. ubp16 was crossed with ubp17 to generate the ubp16 ubp17 double mutant for salt sensitivity analysis. ubp16 was crossed with scabp8 to generate the ubp16 scabp8 double mutant, and lines 32 and 66 were used in our analyses. Seeds were sterilized in a solution containing 20% sodium hypochlorite and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 12 min, washed five times with sterilized water, and sown on MS medium with 0.3% (for horizontal growth) or 0.5% (for vertical growth) Phytagel agar (Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were kept at 4°C for 2 d and then seeds were germinated under constant illumination (Philips TLD 30W/54 YZ30RR25) at 23°C. For salt sensitivity assays on plates, Col-0, the ubp16 mutant, the ubp16 complemented lines (Com-7 and Com-13), and the ubp16 ubp17 and ubp16 scabp8 double mutants were grown vertically on MS medium with 0.6% agar under continuous light for 5 d at 23°C. Seedlings were transferred to MS medium without or with 100 or 120 mM NaCl. After the indicated times of vertical growth, seedlings were photographed and fresh weight was measured. For salt sensitivity assays in soil, Col-0, ubp16, the ubp16 complemented lines (Com-7 and Com-13), and the ubp16 scabp8 double mutant were grown in soil under short-day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) for 3 weeks. Subsequently, the soil was irrigated with 150 mM NaCl four times every 3 d, and plants were grown for an additional 1 or 4 weeks and photographed and chlorophyll content was analyzed. To complement the ubp16 mutant, 7664 bp of the UBP16 genomic sequence was amplified with the GenomicF and GenomicR primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online) and then cloned into the KpnI and SalI sites of the pCAMBIA1200 vector. The resulting pCM1200-UBP16 genomic construct was transformed into the ubp16 mutant. To determine the role of Cys-551 in the deubiquitination activity of UBP16 and in salt tolerance, a Cys551Ser mutation was generated using the pCM1200-UBP16 genomic plasmid with the mGenomicF and mGenomicR primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online). T3 transgenic lines were confirmed by RT-PCR and lines 7 and 13 (Com-7 and Com-13) from the pCM1200-UBP16 genomic transformation and lines 1 and 2 (mCom-1 and mCom-2) from the pCM1200-UBP16Cys551Ser genomic transformation were used for salt sensitivity assays. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from 10-d-old seedlings grown on MS plates or 1-month-old plants grown in soil in the greenhouse under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod. Total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara) to remove genomic DNA. Ten micrograms of RNA was used for reverse transcription with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were used for quantitative real-time PCR amplification or RT-PCR analysis with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. ACTIN was used as an internal control. Leaves were harvested, weighed, and placed into 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes. Acetone (800 μL of an 80% solution) was added, and the samples were incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Light absorption at 665 and 649 nm was determined with a microplate reader. The concentration of chlorophyll (total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b) was calculated according to the following formula: chlorophyll a = 13.95A665 − 6.88A649; chlorophyll b = 24.96A649 − 7.32A665; and total chlorophyll = chlorophyll a + chlorophyll b. For subcellular localization, the SHM1 coding region was amplified with the gSHM1F and gSHM1R primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online) and cloned into the pCM1205-C-GFP vector using the SacI and BamHI sites to fuse the target protein to the N terminus of GFP. For GUS staining, a 1930-bp genomic DNA fragment from nucleotides 1 to 1930 bp upstream of the translational start site (ATG) of UBP16 was amplified with the PromoterF and PromoterR primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online) and then cloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of the pCM1390 vector. The plasmid was transformed into Col-0 and transgenic T3 lines or T2 lines were used for GFP observation or GUS staining, respectively. Conserved domains of the sequences of the 27 members in the At-UBP protein family were used for phylogenetic analysis. The conserved domains were defined by submitting the protein sequences to both the Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information CDART (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/lexington/lexington.cgi?cmd=rps) databases. Alignment of the assembled conserved domains was performed by ClustalW (CITATION). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA version 3.1 (CITATION) using the neighbor-joining algorithm with 1001 bootstrap replicates. To detect UBP16-mediated cleavage of Ub linked via α-amino linkages in vivo, MBP-UBP16 or MBP-UBP16Cys551Ser was coexpressed with substrate (His-UBQ1) in Escherichia coli DE3 cells. The E. coli cells were cultured at 37°C for 4 h to an OD600 of 0.8. After subsequent isopropylthio-β-galactoside (1 mM) induction for 3 h, cells were harvested and lysed in SDS loading buffer. The lysates were assayed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Ub and anti-MBP antibodies. An advanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) was used to detect the signal. Col-0 and the ubp16 mutant were grown in soil under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle for 3 weeks at 23°C, and the seedlings were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 10 d. Rosette leaves were harvested and dried at 80°C for 2 d. All samples were weighed and treated at 300°C for 1 h and 575°C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The resulting ground dry matter was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl. The Na+ and K+ contents of the samples were determined with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi Z-5000). Three-week-old plants were used for PM isolation by aqueous two-phase partitioning as described previously (CITATION). PM Na+/H+ antiport activity was detected as a Na+-induced dissipation of the pH gradient as described (CITATION). To create the UBP16 bait plasmid, the UBP16 cDNA was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector between the EcoRI and SalI sites. The N-terminal 500 amino acids of UBP16 (UBP16N) and the C-terminal 508 amino acids of UBP16 (UBP16C) were cloned into the pGADT7 vector using the NcoI and SacI sites. SHM1-FL, containing the 517 amino acids of SHM1; SHM1-C, encoding the C-terminal 257 amino acids of SHM1; SHM4-FL, containing the 471 amino acids of SHM4; and SHM4-C, encoding the C-terminal 241 amino acids were amplified by primers SHM1NF and SHM1CR, SHM1CF and SHM1CR, SHM4NF and SHM4CR, and SHM4CF and SHM4CR, respectively. All fragments were cloned into the pGBKT7 vector using the BamHI and PstI sites. Yeast transformation and growth assays were performed as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). All primers used for construction are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The UBP16N and UBP16C fragments were amplified with the fhUBP16NF/fhUBP16NR and fhUBP16CF/fhUBP16CR primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online) and inserted into the pCM1307-N-Flag-HA vector between the SalI and KpnI sites. CsCl gradient centrifugation-purified plasmids were transformed into protoplasts. Protoplast preparation and transformation were performed using standard protocols (CITATION). After overnight incubation at 23°C, the protoplasts were lysed, sonicated, and centrifuged. The transiently expressed proteins were extracted using 1 mL immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich]). The sample was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. Fifty microliters (5%) of the supernatant was collected as input. The rest of the supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 20 μL anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. After incubation, the agarose was washed thoroughly approximately four to five times with 1 mL immunoprecipitation buffer per wash. All the immunoprecipitation steps were performed on ice or at 4°C. Proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG, anti-SHM1, and SHM4 antibodies. Recombinant SHM1 and SHM4 proteins prepared from E. coli were used as antigens for polyclonal antibody production in mouse. The SHM1 and SHM4 coding sequences were amplified with the SHM1F/SHM1R and SHM4F/SHM4R primers, respectively, and cloned into the modified pMAL-p2x vector between the BamHI and XhoI sites. Protein induction and purification was performed according to protocols from NEB. Recombinant proteins were purified with amylose resin, and 2 mg of purified recombinant protein was used for mouse immunization. Serum after immunization was used for antibody tests with samples from plant tissues from Col-0 and the shm1-1 and shm4-1 mutants. Ten-day-old seedlings of Col-0 and the ubp16 mutant were harvested and homogenized in mitochondrial isolation buffer (0.4 M mannitol, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tricine, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.8). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C at 10,000g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was overlaid on the top of a 5 to 50% linear Suc gradient and centrifuged at 100,000g for 16 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, 250 μL of each fraction was collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-SHM1 antibody. The VDAC1 and Cytochrome C proteins were used as markers for mitochondria, while MAPK3 and ACTIN were used as cytosolic markers. Anti-VDAC1 antibody was purchased from Agrisera (catalog number AS07212). H2O2 accumulation was measured using two approaches. For DAB staining assays, seedlings grown on MS plates for 10 d were left untreated or treated with 100 mM NaCl for 18 h and then incubated in staining buffer (0.1 mg/mL DAB dissolved in 0.1M HCl, pH 5.0). After 8 h, seedlings were destained (acetic acid:glycerin:ethanol = 1:1:3). For the Amplex Red H2O2/peroxidase assay, 10-d-old seedlings were left untreated or treated with 100 mM NaCl for 9 or 18 h and harvested. Detection of H2O2 accumulation was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings were harvested and ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Total proteins were extracted in degradation buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 4 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, and 10 mM ATP as described (CITATION). Cell debris was removed by two 10-min centrifugations at 17,000g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. MG132 (Calbiochem) was added to the degradation assays as indicated. All mock controls used an equal amount of solvent for each drug. The mixtures were incubated at 22°C, and samples were collected at the indicated times for determination of SHM1 and SHM4 abundance by immunoblot assays. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings of Col-0, ubp16, and shm1-1 were left untreated or treated with 50 or 100 mM NaCl for 12 or 24 h and ground in homogenization buffer (0.4 M mannitol, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tricine, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.8) for 1 min at 4°C. Extracts were centrifuged at 15,000g for 5 min at 4°C. Five percent of the supernatant was collected as the total fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 min at 4°C. After this two-step centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and collected as the mitochondrial fraction. Samples of total, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti–Cytochrome C antibody. VDAC1 was used as a marker for mitochondria and MAPK3 as a marker for the cytosol. Trypan blue staining is used for assessing cell death in Arabidopsis. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings of Col-0, ubp16, shm1-1, and shm4-1 were left untreated or treated with 100 mM NaCl for 24 or 48 h and then covered with staining solution (two volumes of ethanol and one volume of lactophenol were mixed and the final concentration of trypan blue was 1 mg/mL) in a six-well microtiter plate and heated in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The plate was incubated at room temperature overnight. The staining solution was removed and the seedlings covered with destaining solution (staining solution without trypan blue) and incubated for ∼2 to 6 h. The destaining solution was replaced and the samples incubated for an additional 12 h. The seedlings were covered with 70% glycerol for subsequent microscopy. Crude extracts for analysis of SHMT activity were prepared by grinding ∼400 mg of leaf tissue in 300 μL of extraction buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5 mM EDTA), and the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 4°C at 20,000g for 10 min. SHMT activity was tested by following the conversion of radioactive carbon from Ser to methylene THF. The assay was performed with 0.25 mM pyridoxal 5′ phosphate, 2 mM THF, 0.4 mM Ser [3-3H] Ser (33 Ci/mmol), and the crude extract in a final volume of 100 µL. Enzyme assays were performed at 37°C for 20 min. Then, 25 μL of the reaction mixture was streaked onto Whatman DE.81 paper. After drying the filter, unreacted Ser was removed by washing the filter three times with 20 mL of water for 20 min each. The radioactivity associated with methylene THF was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
