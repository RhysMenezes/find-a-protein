!~ABS~! The identification of a family of NAR2-type genes in higher plants showed that there was a homolog in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), AtNAR2.1. These genes encode part of a two-component nitrate high-affinity transport system (HATS). As the Arabidopsis NRT2 gene family of nitrate transporters has been characterized, we tested the idea that AtNAR2.1 and AtNRT2.1 are partners in a two-component HATS. Results using the yeast split-ubiquitin system and Xenopus oocyte expression showed that the two proteins interacted to give a functional HATS. The growth and nitrogen (N) physiology of two Arabidopsis gene knockout mutants, atnrt2.1-1 and atnar2.1-1, one for each partner protein, were compared. Both types of plants had lost HATS activity at 0.2 mm nitrate, but the effect was more severe in atnar2.1-1 plants. The relationship between plant N status and nitrate transporter expression revealed a pattern that was characteristic of N deficiency that was again stronger in atnar2.1-1. Plants resulting from a cross between both mutants (atnrt2.1-1 × atnar2.1-1) showed a phenotype like that of the atnar2.1-1 mutant when grown in 0.5 mm nitrate. Lateral root assays also revealed growth differences between the two mutants, confirming that atnar2.1-1 had a stronger phenotype. To show that the impaired HATS did not result from the decreased expression of AtNRT2.1, we tested if constitutive root expression of a tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) gene, NpNRT2.1, previously been shown to complement atnrt2.1-1, can restore HATS to the atnar2.1-1 mutant. These plants did not recover wild-type nitrate HATS. Taken together, these results show that AtNAR2.1 is essential for HATS of nitrate in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! The interaction of AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 proteins was tested using a mating-based split-ubiquitin system (mbSUS) that allows detection of interacting membrane proteins (CITATION). Both CrNRT2.1 and AtNRT2.3 proteins were used to assay the specificity of the interaction. The C. reinhardtii protein CrNRT2.1 is involved in a two-component system with CrNAR2.1 (CITATION) and has 55% sequence similarity with AtNRT2.1 (EMBOSS-Align, program Needle, EBlossum 62). The Arabidopsis AtNRT2.3 protein has more than 76% similarity with AtNRT2.1, but expression of the gene is almost undetectable in all conditions (CITATION), making it an unlikely partner for AtNAR2.1. Each potential partner was fused to the N (Nub)- or C (Cub)-terminal domain of the ubiquitin protein. In mbSUS, the interaction between the two membrane-bound fusion proteins leads to the reconstruction of the ubiquitin protease activity and release of the protein A-LexA-VP16 (PLV) transcription factor fused to the Cub domain (CITATION). Two types of reporter genes are under the control of the PLV transcription factor, allowing growth tests on selective media (His and Ade auxotrophy) and β-galactosidase activity assays (LacZ). The NRT2 cDNAs were cloned in the pNXgate and pXNgate plasmids and tested in combination with AtNAR2.1 cDNA clones in the pMetYCgate. Growth of diploid cells under selective conditions revealed interaction of AtNAR2.1-CubPLV with NubG-AtNRT2.1 and NubG-AtNRT2.3, but not with NubG-CrNRT2.1 (Fig. 1A ). The NRT2-NubG constructs never showed interaction in combination with AtNAR2.1-CubPLV (data not shown). Testing the β-galactosidase activity provides more quantitative results (Fig. 1B). The activity detected when AtNAR2.1-CubPLV was in combination with NubG-AtRNT2.1 was 2 and 16 times higher than in combination with NubG-AtNRT2.3 and NubG-CrNRT2.1, respectively. These results indicate that the strongest interaction occurs between AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1, much more than between any other NRT2 protein and AtNAR2.1. In the yeast system, the AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 proteins can interact in a specific manner and form a membrane complex. [[FIGURE]] To test if AtNAR2.1 and AtNRT2.1 constituted an Arabidopsis two-component nitrate transport system, both mRNAs were tested in the Xenopus oocyte heterologous system (CITATION). Oocytes were injected with various combinations of NRT2/NAR2 mRNA, including single injection with one or the other mRNA. Oocytes were assayed for nitrate transport activity using enriched 15N nitrate (CITATION). Measurement of 15N enrichment in single oocytes showed that only the combination of AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 provided a significant uptake when compared with the water and single injected oocytes (Fig. 2 ). A very important result is the negative result obtained with AtNRT2.3. Despite some sequence similarity between AtNRT2.1 and AtNRT2.3 (see above), no functional nitrate uptake system could be reconstituted with the AtNRT2.3/AtNAR2.1 combination in oocytes (Fig. 2). These results show that only the co-injection of AtNAR2.1 together with AtNRT2.1 mRNA results in high-affinity nitrate transport in Xenopus oocytes. [[FIGURE]] The atnrt2.1-1 mutant has already been shown to have altered HATS activity and growth at low nitrate concentrations (CITATION). Plants were grown in hydroponics with only nitrate as the N source at two different concentrations, high (6 mm) and low (0.2 mm). At these two levels of concentration, the nitrate supply was not limiting as the nutrient solutions were frequently replaced and wild-type growth was not significantly different (see Supplemental Fig. S1, a–d). By contrast, growth of the atnar2.1-1 mutant was severely decreased at the low nitrate concentration and this effect was stronger than that measured for atnrt2.1-1 plants (see Supplemental Fig. S1a). The shoot and root biomasses of the atnar2.1-1 mutant were only 10% and 48%, respectively, of the wild-type biomass (Supplemental Fig. S1, c and d), and the shoot to root biomass ratio was strongly reduced to 0.9 (Supplemental Fig. S1b). There was no growth difference between the wild type and both types of mutants when the plants were supplied at the higher nitrate concentration (Supplemental Fig. S1, a–d). Analysis of shoot and root nitrate content revealed no differences between wild-type and mutant plants when grown at high nitrate concentration (180 and 50 μmol g−1 fresh weight [FW], respectively, for shoot and root; see Supplemental Fig. S1, e and f). When grown at low nitrate concentration, the wild-type shoot and root nitrate content were decreased by half compared to high nitrate, but in contrast nitrate was almost undetectable in either shoot or root of the atnar2.1-1 mutant. For comparison and confirming earlier work (CITATION), when grown at low nitrate concentration the shoot nitrate content of the atnrt2.1-1 mutant was more decreased than the root nitrate content (43% and 77%, respectively, of the wild type). The total amino acids of wild-type tissues were increased when plants were grown at low nitrate concentration. Root amino acids increased by 162% of the value for wild-type plants grown at the higher nitrate concentration (Supplemental Fig. S1, g and h). In contrast, when grown at a lower nitrate concentration, the shoot and root amino acids concentrations both decreased to 37% for atnar2.1-1 and 80% for atnrt2.1-1 mutants when compared with the values at higher nitrate. The mutant atnar2.1-1 showed only 40% and 29%, respectively, of the shoot and root wild-type amino acids concentrations when grown at the lower nitrate concentration. Analysis of total N content revealed no significant difference between the genotypes under high nitrate supply with around 6% and 5% DW, respectively, for shoots and roots (see Supplemental Fig. S1, i and j). But on the low nitrate concentration, while the wild-type total N content was only slightly reduced, the dramatic decrease of nitrate and amino acid content in the root and shoot of the atnar2.1-1 mutant led to decreased total N content, to only 2.2% and 2.7% DW in shoot and root, respectively. The total N content of the atnar2.1-1 plants grown on low nitrate supply is similar to values measured in wild type after 10 d of N starvation (M. Orsel, unpublished data). At the end of the experiment used to obtain biomass data (Supplemental Fig. S1), the same plants were used to measure nitrate influxes at 0.2 and 6 mm 15NO3− external concentrations to discriminate between the activities of nitrate HATS and LATS. Growing on 6 mm nitrate, wild type and mutants showed the same HATS activity (see Supplemental Fig. S2a). When grown at the lower nitrate concentration (0.2 mm NO3−), wild-type plants showed increased HATS activity, which reached 120 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW. This classical response of HATS to low nitrate supply was lost in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant, which showed only 25 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW (21% of the wild-type 15NO3− influx). For the atnar2.1-1 mutant, the nitrate HATS activity was only 4 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW, even lower than that measured for the atnrt2.1-1 mutant. This rate was only 3% of the wild-type 15NO3− influx and was less than the atnar2.1-1 HATS activity for plants growing on 6 mm nitrate (20 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW). To evaluate root 15NO3− influx resulting from the activity of the LATS, nitrate influx at 0.2 mm 15NO3− was subtracted from that measured at 6 mm 15NO3− (Supplemental Fig. S2, a and b). The calculated values showed no significant differences between the mutants and the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S2c), indicating that LATS activity at high and low nitrate growth concentrations was not affected in the atnar2.1-1 mutant and as was shown previously for the atnrt2.1-1 mutant (CITATION). Root expression levels of genes involved or potentially involved in HATS activity were studied by relative quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (see Table I ). AtNAR2.1 was highly expressed in wild type and the atnrt2.1-1 mutant, both at the same level as the constitutive reference EF1α. Only residual expression could be detected in the atnar2.1-1 mutant, as the specific primer set used corresponded to the cDNA sequence upstream of the T-DNA insertion. This result appears to contrast with data in the paper by CITATION, but this difference can be explained by the differing primer sets used for the PCR and/or the slightly different method. AtNRT2.1 transcripts were never detected in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant as AtNRT2.1 gene was deleted by the T-DNA insertion. On low nitrate concentration, root AtNRT2.1 expression was induced in wild-type roots but repressed in the atnar2.1-1 mutant. The expression level of AtNRT2.1 was decreased by 50% compared to the plants grown at the high nitrate concentration. There was no significant difference in AtNRT1.1 expression between wild type and mutants grown on high nitrate (close to 40% of EF1α), and this level was maintained when wild-type plants were grown on 0.2 mm nitrate. But in both atnrt2.1-1 and atnar2.1-1 mutants, AtNRT1.1 expression levels were decreased to 12% and 7% of EF1α, respectively, under low nitrate conditions (Table I). As shown previously, expression of both AtNRT2.4 and AtNRT2.5 on 0.2 mm nitrate in wild type and the atnrt2.1-1 mutant was enhanced (CITATION). The increase was even greater for the atnar2.1-1 mutant, with AtNRT2.4 and AtNRT2.5 10 and 40 times more strongly expressed when compared with the wild type. Relative gene expression level in roots of wild-type (Ws), atnrt2.1-1, and atnar2.1-1 plants grown under different nitrate regimes Relative expression level was determined on the same plants as described for Figure 3; values are means ± sd of three replicates (pooling three to five plants). Results are given as a percentage of the EF1α gene used as a constitutively expressed reference. Nd., Not detectable (below 0.01% EF1α). The AtNRT2.1 gene has been shown to be specifically involved in the component of HATS that is inducible by both N starvation and nitrate (CITATION; CITATION). Results from the first set of hydroponic experiments showed that AtNAR2.1 was a component of HATS (see above). To test if the atnar2.1-1 mutant was impaired in the N starvation-inducible component of HATS, wild-type plants and atnar2.1-1 mutants were grown for 6 weeks in hydroponics at 6 mm nitrate and then transferred for 24 h to an N-free medium (Fig. 3 ). In wild-type plants, both AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 expression levels were increased by the transfer to N-free supply (5.8 and 2.7 times, respectively; see Fig. 3). This induction coincided with increased HATS activity; the root 15NO3− nitrate influx rate at 0.2 mm increased from 100 to 166 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW when wild-type plants were transferred to an N-free supply (Fig. 3A). On high nitrate supply, the HATS activity for the atnar2.1-1 mutant was similar to wild-type plants, but there was no induction of this transport system by the transfer to N-free medium. Actually, HATS activity was decreased by 75% when compared with the influx measured on high nitrate supply (Fig. 3A). The expression of AtNRT2.1 was maintained at the same level as that measured on high nitrate supply (Fig. 3C). Therefore, in contrast to wild type, there was repression of HATS in the atnar2.1-1 mutant transferred to N-free medium that cannot be explained by decreased expression of AtNRT2.1. [[FIGURE]] To determine if AtNAR2.1 was involved in both constitutive and nitrate-inducible HATS, wild-type plants and atnrt2.1-1 and atnar2.1-1 mutants were grown in vitro on Gln, a reduced N source, for 10 d and then transferred to a low nitrate concentration supply for 24 h (Fig. 4 ). When plants were grown on Gln medium, the nitrate HATS activity for both atnrt2.1-1 and atnar2.1-1 mutants was decreased to 63% and 54%, respectively, of the wild-type activity (Fig. 4A), indicating that both AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 are components of HATS that are not dependent on previous nitrate exposure. After transfer to a low nitrate concentration for 24 h, the root 15NO3− nitrate influx at 0.2 mm was only slightly increased in the wild type and unchanged for both mutants. But both AtNAR2.1 and AtNRT2.1 relative expression levels were increased after transfer to a low nitrate concentration (Fig. 4, B and C). The relative expression level of AtNRT2.1 increased by 6.5- and 4.5-fold in wild-type and atnar2.1-1 plants, respectively. AtNAR2.1 gene expression was increased by 3-fold over that detected in the wild type and doubled in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant background. The high N status of wild-type plants grown on Gln might explain the absence of an increase in HATS by transfer to low nitrate medium even if both AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 are induced. [[FIGURE]] In summary, as expected for two partners involved in one system, AtNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1 are both regulated by nitrate availability: They are induced by sudden N starvation and by low nitrate concentration versus Gln. Both genes are essential for iHATS but also seem to be involved in cHATS. To provide proof that the atnar2.1-1 plant has a stronger phenotype than the atnrt2.1-1, a cross between the two mutants was generated and grown alongside the parent plants. Plants were grown in vitro for 6 d on agar plates containing 10 mm nitrate and then transferred to either 0.5 or 10 mm nitrate (Fig. 5 ). The double atnrt2.1-1 atnar2.1-1 mutant showed the same phenotype as the atnar2.1-1 mutant (Fig. 5). The root 15NO3− nitrate influx on 0.2 mm was only 4 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW for both genotypes, representing, respectively, 50% and 7% of HATS activity in atnrt2.1-1 and wild type (Fig. 5A). The expression level of AtNAR2.1 was unchanged in the wild type under the two growth conditions, but induced by 2.5-fold in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant background on 0.5 mm nitrate. Only residual expression of AtNAR2.1 could be detected in both the atnar2.1-1 mutant and the double mutant due to the T-DNA insertion (Fig. 5B). Six days after transfer to 0.5 mm, AtNRT2.1 gene expression was increased by 1.7-fold in the wild type, but not detectable under any condition in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant or the double mutant due to the gene deletion (Fig. 5C). There was no significant induction of AtNRT2.1 expression in the atnar2.1-1 mutant background on 0.5 mm nitrate. At low nitrate concentration, both mutants, atnar2.1-1 and the double mutant, had decreased shoot biomass with very similar levels around 1.8 mg FW (Supplemental Fig. S5). The decrease was less severe in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant, with the biomass only changing to 2.6 mg FW (Supplemental Fig. S5). Furthermore, the residual HATS activity remaining in both the double and atnar2.1-1 mutants on low nitrate concentration supply was significantly lower than that measured in the wild type and atnrt2.1-1 mutant. There is evidence for an epistatic interaction, with the atnar2.1-1 phenotype appearing to be stronger than that of the atnrt2.1-1 mutation. [[FIGURE]] To determine if NpNRT2.1 from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia complements the atnrt2.1-1 phenotype restoring functional HATS (see CITATION), without interacting with a NAR2.1-type partner, RolDNpNRT2.1X atnar2.1-1 plants were generated by crossing and assayed for root 15NO3− influx (HATS activity) at 0.2 mm nitrate (Fig. 6 ). Plants were grown in vitro on high nitrate (10 mm) and then transferred to low nitrate (0.5 mm) concentration. The RolDNpNRT2.1X atnar2.1-1 plants displayed the same phenotype as the atnar2.1-1 plants when grown on a low nitrate concentration: the shoot biomass was reduced to 30% of the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S6). Under the same conditions, the nitrate HATS activity was decreased to 5 μmol 15NO3− h−1 g−1 root DW for both RolDNpNRT2.1X atnar2.1-1 and atnar2.1-1 plants, representing only 9% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 6). In the atnar2.1-1 genotype background, while NpNRT2.1 was strongly expressed (data not shown), the HATS activity was not restored. NpNRT2.1 cannot restore functional HATS by itself, and the AtNAR2.1 gene product is necessary for the system. Therefore, functional complementation of HATS in atnrt2.1-1 plants (CITATION) must be explained by the interaction between NpNRT2.1 and AtNAR2.1. The results using RolDNpNRT2.1X atnar2.1-1 plants also show that the impaired HATS of the atnar2.1-1 mutant does not result from the decreased expression of AtNRT2.1. [[FIGURE]] Changes in LR growth are a sensitive and easily measurable response of plants to N limitation (CITATION; CITATION). To analyze the impact of AtNAR2.1 disruption on the root architecture, wild type and mutants were grown on vertical agar plates on a nitrate-rich medium (10 mm) for 6 d and then transferred to low nitrate (0.5 mm) medium until day 13 (Fig. 7 ). As previously described (CITATION), the primary root growth of the wild type was not affected by the transfer to low nitrate medium (data not shown), but the total LR length was significantly increased 4 d after transfer when compared with plants remaining on 10 mm nitrate supply (Fig. 7A). The increase in the total LR length was due to both increases in the mean length of individual LRs from 3 d after transfer (Fig. 7C) and enhanced LR appearance 5 d after transfer (Fig. 7D). The stimulation of LR appearance was particularly significant on the portion of primary root that was newly developed after the transfer (Fig. 7E). [[FIGURE]] When the atnar2.1-1 mutant was transferred to 0.5 mm, the total LR length was slightly increased after 3 d, earlier than for the wild type (Fig. 7A; Supplemental Fig. S7a), but this difference was not statistically significant and was not sustained. After 5 d on 0.5 mm, the total LR growth rate of the atnar2.1-1 mutant was significantly lower than that measured on 10 mm (Fig. 7B) and for wild-type plants on 0.5 mm (see Supplemental Fig. S7b). There was a significant increase in the mean LR length occurring 3 d after transfer of the roots, earlier than for wild type (Fig. 7C). Nonetheless, the mean length of LRs was not statistically different between atnar2.1-1 and wild type during the 5 d after transfer to 0.5 mm (Supplemental Fig. S7c). There was a significant decrease in the number of LRs initiated by the atnar2.1-1 mutant 5 d after transfer to 0.5 mm when compared with 10 mm, but not wild-type plants on 0.5 mm (Fig. 7D; Supplemental Fig. 7d). The decrease was particularly noticeable and statistically significant for the number of LRs initiated on the portion of the primary root newly developed after the transfer when compared to the mutant on 10 mm and wild type on 0.5 mm (Fig. 7E; Supplemental Fig. S7e). In summary, the atnar2.1-1 mutant has a different phenotype from wild type in the LR response to transfer to low nitrate supply. Although the total LR length increase was not significantly different from the wild type, there were differences in the pattern of LR development. Initially, LR growth was faster than wild type, but by 5 d it was significantly slower. In addition, after 5 d on 0.5 mm nitrate supply, fewer new LR were initiated by the atnar2.1-1 mutant when compared with the wild type.
!~MM~! The interaction of the NRT2 transporters and the AtNAR2 proteins was tested using mbSUS (CITATION). Full-length cDNAs of NRT2 transporters were cloned in frame with the Nub subdomain of ubiquitin in pNXgate and pXNgate plasmids (TRP1, AmpR), and introduced in the yeast strain THY.AP4 (MATa ura3 leu2 lexA∷lacZ∷trp1 lexA∷HIS3 lexA∷ADE2). The AtNAR2.1 cDNA was cloned in frame with the Cub subdomain of ubiquitin in pMetYCgate (LEU2, AmpR) and introduced in the yeast strain THY.AP5 (MATα URA3 leu2 trp1 his3 loxP∷ade2). Diploid cells were created by mating, and interaction between the Nub and Cub fusions was tested by analysis of reporters (His and Ade auxotrophy, and β-galactosidase activity). For growth assays, diploid cells were grown in liquid synthetic dextrose (SD) −LT (Leu, Trp) minimal media containing 50 μm Met (Minimal SD Base and DO Supplement; BD Bioscience) at 28°C overnight. Culture concentrations were adjusted at OD600 = 1 and diluted 10, 100, and 1,000 times. Five microliters of each dilution was plated on solid agar plate SD −LT or SD −LTHA (Leu, Trp, His, Ade) minimal media containing 50 μm Met and incubated at 28°C for 3 d. Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed by harvesting 4-mL cultures at OD600 = 0.6 and resuspending cells in 400 μL of Z buffer. Cells were lysed by three cycles of incubation at 37°C and subsequent freezing in liquid nitrogen, and then agitated with glass beads using the TissueLyser (Qiagen). Cell debris was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant was used for assays. In microtiter plates, different volumes of protein aliquots were incubated with 40 μL o-nitrophenylglucoside (4 mg mL−1). The kinetics of change in absorbance was measured at 405 nm (accumulation of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside). Total protein content of the aliquots was determined according to Bradford using the Bio-Rad reagent as described previously (CITATION). The values are means ± sd of three replicates; results from a representative experiment are shown. Full-length cDNA were cloned by PCR in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), fully sequenced, and digested with NotI. cDNA fragments were blunted using the Klenow fragment, and subcloned in the EcoRV site of the pT7TS expression vector containing the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 3′-UTR of the Xenopus β-globin gene (CITATION). For in vitro synthesis of mRNA, pT7TS clones were linearized by digestion with BamHI. Capped full-length mRNAs were synthesized using a T7 RNA transcription kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE; Ambion). Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (CITATION) and stored in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.80 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, adjusted at pH 7.4 with NaOH). Healthy oocytes at stage V or VI were injected with 50 nL of water (nuclease free) or different mRNAs at 1 μg μL−1 each. After 3-d incubation at 18°C, five to 10 oocytes were incubated in 3 mL of ND96 solution enriched with 0.5 mm Na15NO3 (atom% 15N: 98%) during 16 h at 18°C. For experiments done at acidic external pH, HEPES buffer (Sigma) was replaced by MES buffer (Sigma) at the same concentration. The oocytes were then thoroughly washed four times with ice-cooled 0.5 mm NaNO3 ND96 solution and dried at 60°C. The 15N to 14N ratio of single dried oocyte was measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (model Integra CN; PDZ Europa). The delta 15N was calculated as described previously (CITATION). The values are means ± sd of five replicates; results from a representative experiment are shown. Seed stocks of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh) from the Wasselewskija (Ws) ecotype were used for all experiments. The mutant atnrt2.1-1 (formerly atnrt2a, renamed according to the nomenclature proposed by CITATION) was isolated in the T-DNA insertion collection of INRA Versailles (CITATION). This mutant provides a functional knockout of the genes AtNRT2.1 (At1g080900) and AtNRT2.2 (At1g08100) due to a T-DNA insertion. The mutant atnar2.1-1 was isolated in the same T-DNA insertion collection using the FLAGdb search tool for the At5g50200 gene. The isolated line was backcrossed with wild-type (Ws) plants and crossed with the mutant atnrt2.1-1 to obtain the double mutant atnrt2.1-1 atnar2.1-1. The atnar2.1-1RolDNpNRT2.1 plants have been obtained by crossing the atnar2.1-1 mutant with wild-type (Ws) plants transformed with the RolDNpNRT2.1 construct described by CITATION. Primer sets for the T-DNA (Tail A: AAA TTG CCT TTT CTT ATC GA) and At5g50200 (Forward: CCC ACA CAA GAT CAT AGC C; Reverse: CAA AAG GAA TTG GTA AAC AAG) have been used for genotyping the plants and sequencing the T-DNA flanking region. Using the AtNAR2.1 gene sequence, two FST (568D06 and 598H04) were identified in the FLAGdb database. The sequences correspond, respectively, to the left-border and right-border flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion. The T-DNA insertion led to a 73-bp deletion including the last 68 bp of the coding sequence and 5 bp of the 3′-UTR. We note that a 71-bp deletion size is described for the previously described Atnrt3.1-2 mutant (CITATION), but we believe it is the same mutation. The deletion was in the sequence encoding the last 22 amino acids (over 210), containing half of the predicted transmembrane domain, Aramemnon database (CITATION). The mutant, named atnar2.1-1, was backcrossed to the wild type (Ws ecotype) and the physiological impact of AtNAR2.1 disruption was studied in comparison to the disruption of AtNRT2.1 and AtNRT2.2 genes in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant (CITATION; CITATION). For the atnar2.1-1 growth phenotype analysis (Supplemental Figs. S1 and S2; Table I), plants were grown under hydroponic culture conditions on 6 mm NO3− or 0.2 mm NO3− medium in Sanyo growth chamber with 8-h-light/16-h-dark cycle at 21°C/17°C, respectively, 70% relative humidity, and 150 μmol m−2 s−1 irradiation as described (CITATION). Note that the light conditions are slightly different from those used previously, so the tissue amino acid concentrations of wild type (see Supplemental Fig. S1) are therefore slightly higher than reported previously (CITATION), presumably as more carbon is available. For each genotype and nutritional condition, three to five plants were pooled and 15NO3− influx was assayed as described below. Immediately after, roots were separated from the shoots and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized to a powder to allow 15N and metabolite analysis as well as total RNA extractions. Three independent experiments were performed and results from a representative one are shown. For the 24-h N-starvation experiments (Fig. 3), plants were grown on 6 mm NO3− for 41 d in the same conditions as described above and transferred into N-free culture medium or new 6 mm NO3− medium for 24 h. The N-free solution contains 2.5 mm K2SO4, 2.2 mm CaCl2 instead of 1 mm K2SO4, 0.7 mm CaCl2. Pools of one to three plants were harvested 24 h after transfer, and 15NO3− influx was assayed as described below. Samples were homogenized to a powder to allow 15N analysis and total RNA extractions. Two independent experiments were performed and results from a representative one are shown. For the in vitro experiments (Figs. 4–7⇑⇑), the basic medium contained 0.5 mm CaSO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm H2PO4, 2.5 mm MES (Sigma), 72 μm NaFeEDTA, 10 μm MnSO4, 24 μm H3BO3, 3 μm ZnSO4, 0.9 μm CuSO4, 0.04 μm (NH4)6Mo7O24, adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH. This basic medium was supplemented with 10 mm KNO3, 0.5 mm KNO3, or 5 mm l-Gln (Sigma) for each type of experiment. The K+ concentration was adjusted to 10 mm by addition of K2SO4 in media with 0.5 mm KNO3 or 5 mm l-Gln. These nitrate concentrations differ from those used in the hydroponics and were chosen because they enable a direct comparison of Arabidopsis phenotypes in previously published work (e.g. CITATION). The Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized, sown on 10- × 10-cm plate on 50 mL of solid medium (1% Difco BACTO AGAR; BD Biosciences), and stored for 3 d at 4°C in the dark. Plates were incubated vertically at 22°C, with 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle and a light intensity of 140 μmol m−2 s−1. A 1-cm band of solid media was removed at the top of each plate to facilitate shoot growth, and six to eight plantlets were transferred onto fresh growth media as indicated. Plants were harvested at the indicated stage; 15NO3− influx was assayed as described below on pool of three plants, and total RNA was extracted from a pool of six plants from the same experiment. Two independent experiments were performed and results from a representative one are shown. Influx of 15NO3− was assayed as described previously (CITATION). The plants were transferred first to 0.1 mm CaSO4 for 1 min, then to complete nutrient solution containing either 0.2 mm or 6 mm 15NO3− (atom% 15N: 99%) for 5 min, and finally to 0.1 mm CaSO4 for 1 min (300 mL for plants grown in hydroponics, and 20 mL for plants grown in vitro). After homogenization, an aliquot of the frozen powder was dried overnight at 80°C and analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (model Integra CN; PDZ Europa). Influx of 15NO3− was calculated from the total N and 15N content of the roots (1 mg DW). An aliquot of the corresponding shoot powder was also analyzed to determine total N content. The values are means ± sd of four to five replicates. An aliquot of the powder was weighed (50 mg FW) and extracted in a four-step ethanol water procedure for determination of the nitrate content (μmol g−1 FW) and a Rosen evaluation of free-amino acid concentration (μmol g−1 FW) as already described (CITATION). The values are means ± se of three replicates. Total root RNA was extracted with the Gen Elute Mammalian Total RNA kit from Sigma-Aldrich, modified by adding a DNase step, which was performed with the Qiagen RNase-free DNase kit. Gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR as described (CITATION): first strands were synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) and oligo(dT)15 primers (Promega). The PCR was performed on a LightCycler instrument (Roche) with the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit for PCR (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the 24-h N starvation and the in vitro experiments, total root RNA was extracted with the same Gen Elute Mammalian Total RNA kit but followed by a treatment with the Deoxyribonuclease I kit (amplification grade) from Sigma. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed on ABI PRISM 7700 using the SuperScript III Platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR kit with SYBR Green from Invitrogen for the first-strand synthesis and the quantitative PCR according to manufacturer's protocol. Specific primer sets were used for each tested gene: AtNRT2.1 (F: AGT CGC TTG CAC GTT ACC TG; R: ACC CTC TGA CTT GGC GTT CTC), AtNRT2.4 (F: CAG TTC CTT CCG ACT CAT CA; R: GCA ACA CCA GCA TTT CCG AC), AtNRT2.5 (F: CTC TGC TTT CGC CGT TCT CTT GTT C; R: CGC TGC TAT AAT CCC TGC TGT CTG G), AtNRT1.1 (F: AGA CCG AAC CAA AAG AAC GA; R: CCA CGA TAA CCG CAG CAA CC), and AtNAR2.1 (F: CCA GAA GAT CCT CTT TGC TTC ACT; R: CCC AAT CGA GCT TAG CGT CCA). Expression levels of tested genes were expressed as a percentage of the constitutive AtEF1A4α (At5g60390) gene expression level (F: CTG GAG GTT TTG AGG CTG GTA T; R: CCA AGG GTG AAA GCA AGA AGA). Arabidopsis seedlings were cultured in vitro (see above method) and root growth was analyzed as described previously (CITATION). The root systems in vertical agar plates were scanned daily at 300 dpi (ScanJet 6300C; Hewlett-Packard). Root growth parameters were determined after analysis of scanned images using the ImageJ analysis software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Statistical comparisons of means between treatments or genotypes were performed using the pooled Student's t test using Sigmaplot software (Systat Software UK).
