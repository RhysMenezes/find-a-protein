!~ABS~! Lateral root formation is an important developmental component of root systems in vascular plants. Several regulatory genes for lateral root formation have been identified from recent studies mainly using Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we isolated two dominant mutant alleles, crane-1 and crane-2, which are defective in lateral root formation in Arabidopsis. The crane mutants have dramatically reduced lateral root and auxin-induced lateral root formation, indicating that the crane mutations reduce auxin sensitivity. In addition, the crane mutants have pleiotropic phenotypes in the aerial shoots, including long hypocotyls when grown in the light, up-curled leaves and reduced fertility. The crane mutant phenotypes are caused by a gain-of-function mutation in domain II of IAA18, a member of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor family which is expressed in almost all organs. In roots, IAA18 promoter::GUS was expressed in the early stages of lateral root development. In the yeast two-hybrid system, IAA18 interacts with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19, transcriptional activators that positively regulate lateral root formation. Taken together, our results indicate that CRANE/IAA18 is involved in lateral root formation in Arabidopsis, and suggest that it negatively regulates the activity of ARF7 and ARF19 for lateral root formation.
!~RES~! Although the arf 7 arf19 double mutant has an obvious lateral root formation deficiency phenotype (Okushima et al. CITATION), each of the single mutants, arf 7 and arf19, has milder or almost no abnormal phenotype in lateral root formation, presumably because of the functional redundancy between ARF7 and ARF19 (Tatematsu et al. CITATION, Okushima et al. CITATION, Wilmoth et al. CITATION). To identify novel factors that cooperatively regulate lateral root formation with ARF7 and ARF19, we screened ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized M2 seedlings for enhancers of the arf 7-1 and arf19-4 single mutants. About 150 M2 lines were affected in lateral root formation, and >30 of them were double mutants with a previously known mutation, such as shy2/iaa3, slr/iaa14, tir3, arf 7 (for arf19-4) and arf19 (for arf 7-1), which have been reported to affect lateral root formation (data not shown). Among the remainder, we identified two independent lines from arf 7-1 and arf19-4, respectively, which had almost the same phenotypes as each other, but which did not resemble mutants that had been described previously. We named these two mutants crane-1 and crane-2, respectively, after the origami crane bird. Genetic analysis indicated that the crane-1 and crane-2 mutations are dominant. Even after the backcrossing away from the arf 7-1 or arf19-4 mutation, each crane mutation caused almost identical phenotypes to the original crane-1 arf 7-1 and crane-2 arf19-4 double mutants. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of the single crane mutations on lateral root formation and other developmental events, rather than as a genetic enhancer of arf 7 or arf19. The primary roots of 15-day-old light-grown wild-type Col seedlings produced many lateral roots, which are dramatically reduced in crane-1 and crane-2 (Fig. 1A). In 8-day-old seedlings, the length of primary roots was 51.0 ± 8.5 mm (mean ± SD) for Col and 39.5 ± 9.5 mm for crane-2 (Fig. 2A), and the total number of lateral roots was 9.0 ± 2.8 for Col and 2.2 ± 1.8 for crane-2 (Fig. 2B). Lateral root density, which is the number of lateral roots cm−1 primary root, was 1.8 ± 0.6 for Col and 0.6 ± 0.5 for crane-2 (Fig. 2C).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The aerial parts of these crane mutants also have several distinctive phenotypes (Fig. 1B–H). The cotyledons and rosette leaves of Col are almost flat or slightly down-curled, whereas they are up-curled on the crane mutants (Fig. 1C–E). In addition, crane mutants are dwarfed (Fig. 1B), have longer hypocotyls (Fig. 1C, D, H), shorter stamens (Fig. 1F, G) and lower fertility rates (data not shown) than the wild type. The gravitropic responses of seedling roots and hypocotyls are not dramatically affected by the crane-2 mutation (Supplementary Fig. S1). In Arabidopsis, the development of a lateral root is described in nine stages (Malamy and Benfey CITATION). The formation of a lateral root primordium is initiated by pericycle cell division in a transverse orientation (anticlinal cell division, stage I). Subsequently, some of the divided cells in stage I divide in a longitudinal orientation (periclinal cell division) that produce two layers from a single pericycle cell layer (stage II). After stage II, the lateral root primordium is formed through further cell division and differentiation (stages III and IV). To determine which stages of lateral root development are affected in the crane mutants, we analyzed the expression of a cell cycle marker gene, pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS, in the crane-2 primary root. In the pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS line, the chimeric protein containing the destruction box of CycB1;1 fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) is expressed under the control of the CycB1;1 promoter (Colón-Carmona et al. CITATION). As CycB1;1 is expressed only at around the G2–M transition of the cell cycle (Doerner et al. CITATION, Fukaki et al. CITATION), GUS activity (foci) of 8-day-old light-grown pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS seedlings was detected in the dividing cells of the root pericycle where lateral root initiation occurs, as well as in the primary root apical meristem (Fig. 3A, B, E). In contrast, the 8-day-old light-grown pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS/crane-2 seedlings have a smaller number of GUS foci around the root pericycle cells than pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS/Col seedlings, although foci were detected at the primary root apical meristem (Fig. 3C, E). These observations indicate that the crane mutation reduces the division of pericycle cells in the early stages of lateral root initiation, probably the first anticlinal cell division of the pericycle.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The crane mutant in lateral root formation and other developmental phenotypes indicates that the crane mutation alters sensitivity to auxin. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effects of exogenous auxin, naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), on crane-2 root growth. Five-day-old Col and crane seedlings grown on NAA-free medium were transferred to NAA-free or NAA-containing medium and incubated for an additional 4 d. In both Col and crane-2, 0.1 μM NAA reduced the growth of primary roots to a similar extent [32.0 ± 7.1% of control in Col; 43.0 ± 19.1% of control in crane-2 (n = 12); no significant difference was observed between Col and crane-2. (P > 0.05, by Student's t-test)] (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Col seedlings treated with 0.1 μM NAA formed >10 lateral roots per individual (n = 12) whereas the crane-2 seedlings treated with 0.1 μM NAA formed 6.3 lateral roots per individual (n = 12) (P < 0.01, by Student's t-test), indicating that the crane-2 mutant has reduced sensitivity to 0.1 μM NAA in auxin-induced lateral root formation (Fig. 4B). However, 1 μM NAA inhibited primary root growth and induced lateral root formation in the crane-2 mutant similar to Col (Fig. 4A, B). In contrast, as described previously (Fukaki et al. CITATION), slr-1/iaa14 was more resistant to exogenous 0.1 μM NAA in the root growth inhibition assay (Fig. 4A) and produced almost no lateral roots in response to 1 μM NAA (Fig. 4B). These observations indicate that the auxin sensitivity of crane-2 roots is attenuated but not as inhibited as in the slr-1 mutant.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] DR5::GUS is a useful reporter gene for studies on auxin-responsive gene transcription in Arabidopsis (Ulmasov et al. CITATION) and is widely used for visualizing auxin response maxima; it can be useful for following endogenous free auxin distribution (Benková et al. CITATION). DR5::GUS expression was observed in the crane-2 background around the distal regions of primary and lateral roots (Fig. 4C–F) and was enhanced by treatment with 1 μM NAA (data not shown) as observed in the wild-type Col. As described above, some of the pleiotropic phenotypes characteristic of crane mutants are observed among the dominant mutants of Aux/IAA genes such as slr/iaa14 (Liscum and Reed CITATION). Among the 29 Aux/IAA genes found in the Arabidopsis genome, the mutants axr5/iaa1 (Yang et al. CITATION), shy2/iaa3 (Tian and Reed CITATION), bdl/iaa12 (Hamann et al. CITATION), slr/iaa14 (Fukaki et al. CITATION), axr3/iaa17 (Rouse et al. CITATION), msg2/iaa19 (Tatematsu et al. CITATION) and iaa28 (Rogg et al. CITATION) have been reported previously. All these mutants have an amino acid alteration in domain II of their respective Aux/IAA protein, but no mutants like crane with the phenotypes including long hypocotyls, up-curled leaves and reduced lateral root formation had been reported. The crane locus could not be genetically mapped because not enough F2 seeds were produced due to the very low fertility of F1 plants from a cross between crane and Ler. Therefore, in order to isolate the crane gene, the DNA sequences of IAA2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33 and 34 were compared in wild-type Col, crane-1 and crane-2 genomic DNA. Both crane-1 and crane-2 have a single-nucleotide missense mutation in IAA18, a member of the Aux/IAA genes (Fig. 5A).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The IAA18 protein consists of 267 amino acids and has four conserved domains among all of the Aux/IAA proteins (Fig. 5A). The crane-1 and crane-2 mutations cause the Gly99Arg and Gly99Glu substitutions in domain II, respectively (Fig. 5A). To confirm that CRANE encodes IAA18, we examined whether the 4 kbp genomic fragment containing IAA18 with the crane-2 mutation gives the crane phenotypes in the wild-type background (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Among four independent transgenic lines harboring the 4 kbp fragment, three lines had reduced lateral root formation compared with the non-transgenic controls (Fig. 6A). In addition, these lines had the same developmental abnormalities as crane (Fig. 6A–D and data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Previously, a Gly99Glu substitution in domain II (i.e. crane-2) was reported as iaa18-1 in unpublished results by Nagpal and Reed (Reed CITATION). The iaa18-1 allele was not described in detail but defects in cotyledon phyllotaxy, long hypocotyl, short root and up-curled leaves were associated with the mutant (Reed CITATION, Liscum and Reed CITATION). However, it has not been confirmed whether the iaa18-1 phenotypes are caused by the domain II mutation in the IAA18 gene, but our observation that the two crane mutants have long hypocotyls, short primary roots and up-curled true leaves, as well as fused cotyledons at a very low rate and that the crane phenotypes are caused by the domain II mutation in IAA18 indicates that the iaa18-1 and crane mutants are co-allelic and that they are gain-of-function mutants in IAA18. To examine the function of the IAA18 gene in the wild type, we analyzed the GABI-Kat line 800H03, which has a T-DNA insertion at the end of the third exon of the IAA18 coding region. No obvious phenotype was observed in this line (data not shown), suggesting that IAA18 functions redundantly with other Aux/IAAs, as is the case with Aux/IAA genes (Overvoorde et al. CITATION). Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) was used to determine the expression pattern of IAA18 in five different organs of Arabidopsis. IAA18 was expressed in the aerial parts and roots of seedlings, rosette leaves, cauline leaves and inflorescences, though expression in roots was lower than in other organs (Fig. 7). This result is consistent with other published microarray data (Zimmermann et al. CITATION, Schmid et al. CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We also examined the IAA18 expression pattern using transgenic plants harboring GUS fused to the 2.0 kb upstream region of IAA18 (pIAA18::GUS, see Supplementary Fig. S2). In the pIAA18::GUS seedlings, GUS expression was observed only in the pericycle where lateral roots are initiated and only during the early stages of lateral root development (Fig. 7B, D, E). No GUS staining was observed in emerged lateral roots or in the primary root meristem (Fig. 7C, F, G). GUS expression in the pericycle was enhanced by 1 μM auxin treatment for 5 h (Fig. 7H), suggesting that IAA18 is expressed in an auxin-dependent manner. In the pIAA18::GUS seedlings, neither cotyledons nor true leaves had apparent GUS staining (data not shown), suggesting that the upstream region used in this experiment may not be sufficient to allow the complete native expression pattern of IAA18, like the case of the pIAA14::GUS line (Fukaki et al. CITATION). SLR/IAA14 functions cooperatively with ARF7 and ARF19 for initiating lateral root formation, and IAA14 protein interacts directly with ARF7 and ARF19 in a yeast two-hybrid system (Fukaki et al. CITATION). IAA18 is co-expressed with ARF7 and ARF19 at the lateral root initiation site (Fig. 7; Okushima et al. CITATION), suggesting that IAA18 interacts with ARF7 and ARF19. Yeast two-hybrid experiments between IAA18 and ARF7 or ARF19 were performed to determine if IAA18 protein also interacts with ARF7 and ARF19. The results showed that IAA18 directly interacts with both ARF7 and ARF19 in yeasts (Table 1), suggesting that CRANE/IAA18 functions with ARF7 and ARF19 for lateral root formation in planta. 
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) accession, slr (Fukaki et al. CITATION), arf 7-1 (SALK_040394; Okushima et al. CITATION) and arf19-4 (SALK_009879, obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; Wilmoth et al. CITATION) lines were used. pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS seeds were kindly supplied by Peter Doerner (University of Edinburgh, UK). DR5-GUS seeds were kindly supplied by Tom Guilfoyle (University of Missouri-Columbia, USA). The axr3-1 and axr3-3 mutant seeds were kindly supplied by Ottoline Leyser (University of York, UK). Seeds were surface-sterilized with 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, and plated on Murashige–Skoog medium containing 1.0% (w/v) sucrose solidified with 0.5% (w/v) gelan gum or 1% (w/v) agar. Kanamycin and hygromycin were added to a final concentration of 50 μg ml−1 from an aqueous 50 mg ml−1 stock. Plates and plants transferred to soil were grown at 23°C under constant white light. About 5,000 each of arf 7-1 and arf19-4 mutant seeds were mutagenized with EMS as described previously (Fukaki et al. CITATION). M2 seeds were harvested and sown on the MS plates to screen for mutants with decreased numbers of lateral roots. The crane-1 and crane-2 mutants were isolated from arf 7-1 and arf19-4 M2 populations, respectively. These crane arf double mutants were backcrossed to the wild-type Col, and the resulting F1 generation was crossed with Col to separate the crane mutation from the arf mutation. The arf 7-1 and arf19-4 mutations caused by T-DNA insertion were detected by PCR with the LB-specific primer (5′-GTTGCCCGTCTCACTGGTGAAAAG-3′) and gene-specific primers as follows: 5′-TGTTGCACTCCTCTTTGAACC-3′ and 5′-TGGACTTTTGCTGACCCACGA-3′ for arf 7-1, and 5′-GATGAACAGGAGAGAAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGTTGCATCGAGAAATCCT-3′ for arf19-4. pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(NT)-GUS (Colón-Carmona et al. CITATION) and DR5::GUS (Ulmasov et al. CITATION) were crossed with crane-2 by artificial pollination. The resultant F2 seedlings expressing reporter genes were stained and observed as described previously (Malamy and Benfey CITATION). For analysis of auxin-induced DR5::GUS expression in crane-2, 7-day-old seedlings of DR5::GUS/crane-2 were transferred to MS plates with or without 1 μM NAA, incubated for 4 h, and stained. Five-day-old Col and crane seedlings grown on NAA-free MS plates were transferred to MS plates with or without 1 μM NAA and incubated for an additional 4 d. These plates were photographed with a Nikon COOLPIX2500, and root length and number of lateral roots were tallied using ImageJ software (Abramoff et al. CITATION) and NeuronJ plug-in (Meijering et al. CITATION). The genomic region containing domain II of the selected Aux/IAA genes (IAA2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34) was amplified from Col, crane-1 and crane-2 mutant DNA with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. PCR products were purified and directly sequenced by standard methods using these PCR primers and BigDye Terminator v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Lincoln Centre Drive Foster City, CA, USA). IAA18 was amplified from Col cDNA using the primers: 5′-ATGGAGGGTTATTCAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-TCATCTTCTCATTTTCTCTT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRV site of the pGreenII (Hellens et al. CITATION) and pBluescriptSK+ vectors (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), and confirmed by sequencing using the primers: M13(–20) (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and M13RV (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACAC-3′). To produce the transgenic plants expressing the mutated IAA18 gene, a 3,956 bp genomic region that spans IAA18 was amplified from Col DNA using the primer set: 5′-TATGATGGGATGGTAAATGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGAGTCCAGACAAAGA-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptSK+ and subcloned into vector pBI301H, a derivative of pBI101 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) made by the authors, using the EcoRI and SalI sites. This construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58MP90 and transformed into Col plants by the floral dipping method (Clough and Bent CITATION). Total RNA was extracted from several Col seedling and adult plant organs using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). cDNAs for each sample were synthesized by reverse transcription using Reverse Transcriptase XL (AMV) (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). IAA18 expression was analyzed using a Smart Cycler® II System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the primers: 5′-TCGCTGGCAAATACTTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CACTGGACCAGGAGCAGTTC-3′. For an internal control, ACT2 expression was also analyzed using the primers: 5′-TTGTTCCAGCCCTCGTTTGT-3′ and 5′-TCATGCTGCTTGGTGCAAGT-3′. A 2,003 bp fragment including the upstream region and 59 bp of open reading frame was amplified from Col genomic DNA using the primer set: 5′-TATGATGGGATGGTAAATGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATCATCAAGTCAAGCAG-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pBI301. This construct was transformed into Col plants as described above. T2 seedlings were stained and observed as described previously (Fukaki et al. CITATION). Yeast two-hybrid experiments between IAA18 and ARF7 or ARF19 were performed as described previously (Fukaki et al. CITATION). IAA18/pAD-GAL4-2.1 was constructed from a XhoI–PstI fragment of IAA18/pBluescriptSK+ and pAD-GAL4-2.1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers for the genes mentioned in this article are as follows: ARF7 (At5g20730), ARF19 (At1g19220), IAA14/SLR (At4g14550), IAA18/CRANE (At1g51950).
