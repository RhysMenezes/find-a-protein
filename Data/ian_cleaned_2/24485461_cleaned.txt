!~ABS~! Auxin regulates numerous plant developmental processes by controlling gene expression via a family of functionally distinct DNA-binding auxin response factors (ARFs), yet the mechanistic basis for generating specificity in auxin response is unknown. Here, we address this question by solving high-resolution crystal structures of the pivotal Arabidopsis developmental regulator ARF5/MONOPTEROS (MP), its divergent paralog ARF1, and a complex of ARF1 and a generic auxin response DNA element (AuxRE). We show that ARF DNA-binding domains also homodimerize to generate cooperative DNA binding, which is critical for in vivo ARF5/MP function. Strikingly, DNA-contacting residues are conserved between ARFs, and we discover that monomers have the same intrinsic specificity. ARF1 and ARF5 homodimers, however, differ in spacing tolerated between binding sites. Our data identify the DNA-binding domain as an ARF dimerization domain, suggest that ARF dimers bind complex sites as molecular calipers with ARF-specific spacing preference, and provide an atomic-scale mechanistic model for specificity in auxin response.
!~RES~! All ARFs carry a conserved DBD at their N terminus (CITATION A). This domain is often followed by an MR that directs transcriptional changes and a C-terminal domain (III/IV) that mediates protein-protein interactions (CITATION). It is well established that domain III/IV is essential for the heterotypic ARF-Aux/IAA interactions that render ARF activity auxin dependent (CITATIONA; CITATION). The same domain has been proposed to mediate ARF-ARF interactions (CITATION), but whether this is biologically meaningful has not been established. The ARF DBD is sufficient for binding auxin-responsive promoters (CITATION). Its B3 subdomain is found in other transcription factors (CITATIONA; (CITATION) and was shown to bind DNA in RAV1 (CITATION), which suggests domain modularity. Interestingly, phylogenetic trees based on sequence alignments of only the DBD strongly resemble those derived from entire ARF proteins (CITATION available online), raising the possibility that variations in this domain contribute to the distinct properties of ARFs. To gain insight into the mechanism of DNA binding by ARFs, we expressed and purified the DBD of ARF1 and ARF5/ MP. These two ARFs are phylogenetically distant (CITATION), and their divergence occurred early in land plant evolution hundreds of millions of years ago (CITATION). Based on mutant phenotypes and misexpression analysis, ARF1 and ARF5 are functionally divergent (CITATION), although both proteins are able to bind the same generic core DNA motif (CITATION). Both proteins were purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The structure of ARF1-DBD was solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) on a seleno-methionine (SeMet) derivative, and the resulting model was used for molecular replacement on the other structures (CITATION). We obtained two distinct structures of ARF1-DBD (solved to 1.45 and 2.67 Å resolution) and one of ARF5-DBD (2.15 Å). All three models subtly differed in the topology of several loops but showed the same overall structure (CITATIONB–1D, CITATION A, and S2B). The crystal structures reveal that the ARF DBDs are composed of three distinct structural domains. One is the B3 domain (residues 120–226 in ARF1-DBD and 154–260 in ARF5-DBD; CITATIONC), which folds in a seven-stranded open β barrel structure (CITATIONB and 1D), similar to the B3 domains of Arabidopsis RAV1 (CITATION) and Atlg16640 (CITATION). Remarkably, the B3 domain in ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD is embedded in a larger fold context. The regions N- and C-terminal to the B3 domain together form a single second domain (CITATIONB and CITATIONA–S2C) that is very similar between ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD (CITATIONB and 1C) and constitutes a dimerization domain (DD, see below). Thus, the B3 domain appears to be an insertion in the DD. Structure similarity searches (DALI [(CITATION)]; PDBeFold [CITATION]) on the DD show that there are no homologs in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), hence it defines a hitherto unknown fold, characterized by an antiparallel five-stranded central β sheet that is highly curved (∼100°), resulting in a taco-like shape (CITATIONB–1D and CITATIOND). Finally, the last 80 C-terminal residues form a third separate ancillary domain (AD) that tightly interacts with the DD. The AD folds in a small five-stranded β-barrel-like structure. Structural similarity searches identified the Tudor domain of the human PHD-finger protein 20 (PDB entry 3QII), but the hydrophobic cage that recognizes methylated lysine residues (CITATION) is missing from the ARF-DBD-AD. Strikingly, in all crystal structures, ARF-DBDs homodimerized through their DD (CITATIOND and CITATIONA–S3C). The dimer interface contacts include hydrophobic interactions (CITATIONF) between several highly conserved residues (CITATIOND and S3E), which indicates that this is most probably a physiologically meaningful interaction. It is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds, some mediated by water molecules (CITATIONE). Interestingly, α helix 6 (α6) of both monomers is juxtaposed and centered at a conserved (CITATIOND and S3E) glycine residue (G245 in ARF1-DBD and G279 in ARF5-DBD). Other residues of this helix (A248, T249, and A253; in ARF5: A282, A283, and A287) engage in hydrophobic interactions (CITATIONE and 1F), whereas the P233–S238 loop (ARF5: P267–S272) fits into a groove of the opposite monomer and involves interactions between S235 (ARF5: S269) on one monomer and K265 and E85 (ARF5: N299 and D118) on the other (CITATIONE, CITATIOND, and S3E). To address whether dimerization is induced by the crystallization conditions or whether this also occurs in solution, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used for ARF1-DBD. Although neither monomer nor dimer models explained the scattering data, a monomer:dimer equilibrium improved the fit dramatically (CITATION A). Hence, homodimerization also occurs in solution, and given that both ARF1 and ARF5 dimerize, this is likely a general property of ARF-DBDs. To next determine whether ARF-DBD homodimerization is required for biological function, we mutated several amino acids in the dimerization interface of ARF5/MP (CITATION ) and tested the ability of mutant proteins to replace the wild-type protein in vivo. The arf5/mp mutant is unable to establish an embryonic root and, as a consequence, forms rootless seedlings (CITATION). Adventitious roots can, however, be induced postembryonically, and mutant plants have distinctive growth defects, including aberrant flowers or even naked, pin-like inflorescences (CITATION). Importantly, although S269N, G279A and N299S mutations did not impair ARF5 activity during embryonic root formation (CITATION), G279E, G279I, A282N, and A287N mutations all compromised ARF5 function in vivo (CITATION and CITATIONB). In some cases, these mutated ARF5/MP proteins even induced dominant-negative defects in wild-type plants (CITATIONC). To ascertain that the failure of these mutant proteins to complement the arf5/mp mutant is due to alterations in dimerization properties, rather than abnormal folding behavior, secondary structures were determined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Consistent with the solubility of purified mutant proteins, none showed deviations in its CD spectrum (CITATION ), suggesting that all fold normally. Hence, this analysis shows that amino acids at the dimerization interface, in particular in the α-6 helix (G279, A282, and A287), are required for ARF5/MP function in vivo. To address whether these mutations indeed interfere with homodimerization in the context of a full-length ARF protein that also carries the C-terminal interaction domain (III/IV), we employed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based interaction assay. Here, interactions between CFP- and YFP-tagged ARF5 are quantified in mesophyll protoplasts (CITATIOND; CITATION), and we have previously used this assay to demonstrate ARF-Aux/IAA interactions in vivo (CITATION). In this assay, wild-type ARF5 showed clear homodimerization as measured by a decrease in the average lifetime of the ARF5-CFP donor (expressed as FRET efficiency; CITATIONE). As expected from the position of the glycine in the dimerization interface, G279A, G279I, and G279E mutations significantly decreased the FRET efficiency and hence impair dimerization (CITATIONE). To determine the relative contribution of the DBD and domain III/IV in homodimerization, a truncated ARF5 protein was generated in which domain III/IV was deleted (CITATION). Homodimerization still occurred, albeit at lower efficiency (CITATIONE). Similarly, the ARF3 protein, which naturally lacks domain III/IV (CITATION), was also able to homodimerize (CITATIONE; compare with ARF3-CFP/free YFP control). Hence, the DBD is sufficient for dimerization in vivo, but interactions through domain III/IV may help to stabilize dimers. Indeed, when the G279I mutation was introduced in the truncated ARF5 protein lacking domains III/IV, FRET efficiency dropped to background levels (CITATIONE). Collectively, these data show that ARF proteins form dimers through interactions between their DNA-binding domains and that this DBD dimerization is required for ARF function in vivo. Sequence alignments show that the amino acids at the dimerization surface are deeply conserved in the ARF family (CITATIOND and S3E), suggesting that this capacity is both widespread and ancient. The interaction surface is composed of many intermolecular interactions (CITATIONE and 1F), which suggests that the interaction may be robust. Indeed, several mutations in residues at the surface (S269N, G279A, and N299S) are tolerated in vivo (CITATION). To test whether such mutations indeed affect the interaction surface, we purified and crystallized the ARF1-G245A mutant (analogous to ARF5-G279A) and solved its structure to 2.3 Å resolution (CITATION). This showed an overall dimeric structure similar to wild-type ARF1-DBD (CITATIONC). As predicted, the structure showed a disturbed dimerization interface (CITATIONF) in which the 2-fold symmetry is broken and the 233–238 loop of one monomer could not bind the opposing monomer. In summary, the ARF interaction is robust and adaptive, as it tolerates a mutation that significantly affects the interaction surface. Yet, as more drastic mutations (G279E and G279I) in the same residue that measurably interfere with dimerization (CITATIONE) impair biological function (CITATION), we conclude that DBD dimerization is essential for in vivo function of ARF5. Based on promoter analysis of an auxin-responsive gene in soybean, a canonical auxin-response element has been defined as TGTCTC (CITATION). ARF1 was first identified in a screen for factors binding this motif (CITATION). An inverted repeat of the same element, spaced by seven nucleotides (CITATION A; ER7), was shown to be efficiently bound by ARF1 (CITATION). To determine the structural basis for DNA binding, we cocrystallized ARF1-DBD and a double-stranded ER7 oligonucleotide and solved its structure to 2.9 Å (CITATION and CITATIONB). The DNA binding interface is located at the tips of the U-shaped dimer. The two B3 domains bind to the inverted AuxRE elements located at both extremes of the oligonucleotide, and the connecting DNA sequence bridges the gap between the B3 domains (CITATIONB). The DNA adopts a B-DNA conformation and is bent by 40°. The structures of apo-ARF1-DBD (without DNA) and DNA-bound ARF1-DBD are very similar, except that the B3 domains are rotated relative to the DDs by 25° (CITATIONC and 3D). As a similar conformational difference is seen between the different apo structures of ARF1 and ARF5 (CITATIOND and CITATIONA), it appears that the B3 domain displays an intrinsic flexibility with respect to the DD and that DNA binding locks the protein into a conformation. Comparing apo- and DNA-bound structures shows that the N-terminal α1 helix functions as a pivot point on which the B3 domain is balanced, and the loops that connect the B3 domain to the DD run down on both sides of the helix (CITATIONC). Interestingly, these loops are mostly disordered in the structures, which indicates flexibility. Given the dimerization of the DBD and the binding of each TGTCTC element to one of the monomers, this structure now explains the efficient binding of ARF1 to an inverted repeat sequence, as well as the constraints of the spacing between repeats (CITATION). Binding of two AuxRE sites by an ARF dimer suggests that DNA binding may be cooperative. To test whether this is the case, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with immobilized oligonucleotides. Both ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD showed binding to ER7 (CITATIONE and 3F and CITATION). Binding was sequence specific, as mutating both AuxRE sites completely abrogated binding (CITATIONE and 3F and CITATION). Consistent with cooperative binding, mutating only one of the two AuxRE sites reduced the affinity more than 2-fold (CITATIONE, 3F, CITATIONF, and S3G and CITATION). This cooperative binding behavior of wild-type ARFs predicts that mutations that disturb dimerization should affect DNA binding affinity. We tested this prediction by performing SPR measurements using S269N, G279E, and A282N mutant proteins. Indeed, all three proteins showed a clear reduction in DNA binding affinity to the ER7 oligonucleotide (CITATIONG and CITATION). These findings show that dimerization of the ARF DBD generates cooperative DNA-binding behavior. As dimerization is important for in vivo function of ARF5, this suggests that cooperative DNA binding is essential for normal ARF function. We next addressed the structural basis for specific DNA binding. The B3 domain recognizes the DNA largely at the major groove of both TGTCTC elements (CITATION A, 4B, CITATION C, and S5D). The B3 β barrel is positioned laterally to the DNA with the axis of the barrel almost parallel to the axis of the DNA double helix. Two adjacent β strands (β5 and β8) run over the major groove, parallel to the two sugar-phosphate backbones. The loops connecting these strands (R181–R186 and H136–G137; ARF5: R215–R220 and H170–G171), located on either side of the barrel, further penetrate the major groove and make interactions that contribute to specific DNA base recognition (CITATIONA). In addition to these base contacts, DNA binding involves interactions of the DNA backbone with residues S131, S140, T191, and S194 (CITATIONB; ARF5: S165, S174, T227, and S230). In summary, ARF1 binding to the canonical TGTCTC motif involves both base contacts and backbone interactions, and the specific contacts involve only the 5′ bases on one strand, which explains why this part of the motif is critical for ARF DNA binding (CITATION). To determine whether the residues that mediate DNA binding in the crystal structure are also required for DNA binding in solution and for ARF function in vivo, several residues were individually mutated to alanines. Even though CD analysis showed that these mutant proteins showed normal overall structure (CITATION), SPR analysis of ARF5-H170A (ARF1: H136) and ARF5-R215A (ARF1:R181) proteins revealed that, in both cases, ER7 binding was significantly reduced (CITATIONC and CITATION), which supports a role in DNA binding. Correspondingly, neither of the H170A and R220A (ARF1: R186) mutants could restore normal development to the arf5/mp mutant, whereas the P218A (ARF1: P184) mutant was still partially functional (CITATION). These findings support the validity of the protein-DNA contacts observed in the complex structure and show the atomic basis for DNA recognition by ARF proteins. Intriguingly, when comparing the DNA-binding amino acids among and between ARF1 and ARF5, all appear to be almost completely conserved (CITATIOND, 4E, and CITATIONC). This finding raises the question whether ARF1 and ARF5 bind qualitatively different sequences. Even though a generic AuxRE has been defined, no systematic exploration of sequence space has been reported. To determine the spectrum of binding motifs of each protein, we carried out a protein-binding microarray (PBM; CITATION) analysis with recombinant ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD. This analysis is saturating for 6-mers (CITATION) and allows statistical and quantitative evaluation of intrinsic binding site preference for the ARF-DBDs. However, longer motifs such as inverted AuxRE repeats that would be expected for ARF dimers cannot be reliably identified. Strikingly, the preferred binding site of both ARF1 and ARF5 appears to be TGTCGG (CITATIONF and 4G), rather than the “canonical” AuxRE TGTCTC (CITATION). It should be noted, however, that the latter is found as an enriched motif, although the former is strongly preferred (CITATIONG). We did not observe a significant difference in the motifs bound by ARF1-DBD or ARF5-DBD (CITATIONG), which is consistent with the invariance of DNA-contacting residues (CITATIOND and 4E). We therefore conclude that the B3 domains of ARF1 and ARF5 do not have qualitatively distinct DNA binding specificity but bind the same spectrum of motifs with quantitatively different efficiency. We next tested which residues in the ARF5 protein contribute to sequence-specific DNA binding by performing PBM analysis on mutant proteins. Sequence-specific binding was lost when either P218 or R215 residues were mutated (CITATION ), whereas H170A and G171A mutations did not affect binding specificity. This analysis thus helps identify residues within the B3 domain that confer binding specificity (R215 and P218) and distinguish these from residues that contribute to DNA affinity (H170; CITATIONC). We next analyzed DNA-binding specificity of proteins impaired in dimerization. Neither ARF5-S269N nor ARF5-G279E altered the PBM binding profile (CITATION). This shows that dimerization contributes to DNA binding affinity, but not to the specificity of DNA motif recognition. We found that ARF proteins are extremely conserved at both their dimerization interface and their DNA-contacting residues. As a consequence, both ARF1 and ARF5 dimerize and bind qualitatively similar sequences. A key unanswered question therefore remains how different genes can be selected by different ARFs. We noticed that the largest variation between ARF1 and ARF5 DBDs is in the loops that connect the B3 and DD domains (CITATION A). Therefore, in addition to quantitative differences in binding of the two ARF DBDs to distinct sequence motifs, one could envisage differences in binding of ARF dimers to complex motifs with varying spacing between AuxRE sites. To test this hypothesis, we performed SPR experiments using ER7 oligonucleotides in which the spacing between the two inverted TGTCTC sites was changed to 5 (ER5), 6 (ER6), 8 (ER8), or 9 (ER9). Both ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD bound to ER8 with similar efficiency as ER7 binding (CITATIONB and 6C and CITATION). Affinity of ARF1-DBD to ER5, ER6, and ER9 was strongly reduced (CITATIONB and CITATION) to a level comparable to that of ER7 with one TGTCTC site mutated (CITATIONE and CITATION) or to that of a mutant impaired in dimerization (CITATIONG and CITATION). In contrast, ARF5-DBD retained significant binding to all ER versions, although binding efficiency to ER5, ER6, and ER9 was slightly reduced compared with ER7 and 8 (CITATIONC and CITATION). Hence, in addition to quantitative differences at the level of binding sites, ARF1 and ARF5 markedly differ in their ability to bind complex motifs depending on the spacing of the two binding sites. Such complex sites, with appropriate spacing, are indeed found in the promoters of direct and physiologically relevant ARF5/MP target genes (CITATIOND; CITATION). In the case of LEAFY, mutating this site abrogated MP-dependent gene regulation (CITATION), which suggests that it represents a physiologically relevant binding site.
!~MM~! Regions corresponding to the DBD of Arabidopsis ARF1 (At1g59750; residues 1–354) and ARF5 (At1g19850; residues 1–390) were amplified from cDNA clones using primers as listed in CITATION using Phusion Flash polymerase (Finnzymes) and cloned in an expression vector pTWIN1 (New England Biolabs) to generate fusions with chitin-binding domain (CBD) and Intein. ARF-DBD-CBD fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta DE3 (Novagen). Protein expression was induced by 0.3 mM IPTG for 20 hr at 20°C, and proteins were purified from cell-free extracts by affinity chromatography on a chitin column followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200PG column, both using an Akta Explorer 100 (GE Healthcare). Full details on expression and purification are described in the CITATION. All crystals were grown at 20°C using sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments. Initial screens were performed using 80–200 nl droplets on 96-well plates using a Cartesian robot. Additive screens on initial hits showed improved crystal size and longevity with GSH/GSSG. Additional trials using the reducing agents GSH and DTT confirmed the dependence of crystal growth and stability on the reduction potential of the environment. Oligonucleotides used for crystallization were obtained from Biomers (Ulm, Germany). Full details on crystallization conditions, data collection, processing, structure determination, and refinement are given in CITATION. SAXS data of ARF1-DBD (concentration 3.2 mg/ml) were collected at beamline BM29 (ESRF, Grenoble). BSA references were used for calculating the molecular mass of ARF1-DBD. Measurements were carried out at 293 K, within a momentum transfer range of 0.01 Å−1 < s < 0.45 Å−1. Calculation of the theoretical scattering curves of monomeric and dimeric ARF1 against the scattering data was performed using CRYSOL (CITATION). SPR measurements were performed using eight 2-fold dilution steps (800 nM, 400 nM, 200 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 12.5 nM, and 6.25 nM) of purified ARF-DBD proteins on a Biacore 3000 platform using double-stranded biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (5′-biotin; Eurogentec; CITATION) immobilized on SA chips (GE Healthcare). Data were analyzed with Scrubber2-T200 (BioLogic Software Pty Ltd). Circular dichroism was performed on 0.1 mg/ml dilutions of purified ARF DBD proteins in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH 7.4) using a 1 mm quartz cell in a J-715 CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Traces are averages of 20 spectra and smoothed over 3 nm windows. Mutations were introduced into cDNA fragments corresponding to the ARF DBDs through PCR using primers as listed in CITATION, and fragments were cloned into pTWIN1. The wild-type and mutated cDNA of ARF5-DBD were amplified and used to replace the genomic DBD in an 8.5 kb MP genomic fragment (CITATION) using the unique restriction sites XhoI and BamHI. Wild-type and mutant versions of the full-length ARF5 cDNA or a fragment truncated after T794 (after CITATION) were LIC cloned (CITATION) using primers as listed in CITATION into the PMON999 (Monsanto) vector and fused to sCFP3A or sYFP2 and transiently expressed in A. thaliana Columbia ecotype mesophyll protoplasts under the 35S promoter for FRET-FLIM assays. The ARF3 plasmids were previously described (CITATION). PBM11 was performed on ARF1-DBD, ARF5-DBD, and their mutated versions H170A, G171A, R215A, P218A, S269N, and G279E according to CITATION) with modifications detailed in the CITATION. Heterozygous plants of the mp-B4149 strong allele (CITATION) were transformed with a pGREEN vector carrying the construct pMP::MP and its different mutated versions by floral dipping with A. tumefaciens. Seeds carrying the transgene were screened on MS media with 15 mg/ml phosphinotricin (PPT). Segregation of the monopteros phenotype in the T2 generation was checked to determine the genotype of the T1 plants. The percentage of rootless seedlings observed in the progeny of heterozygous T1 plants was used to determine whether the transgene could rescue the phenotype. Transfections were performed as described (CITATION) using Arabidopsis (Columbia wild-type) mesophyll protoplasts. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 X system equipped with a 63× 1.20 NA water immersion objective lens. sCFP fluorophore was excited using a pulse diode laser (40 nm) at a frequency of 40 mHz. Donor fluorescence was recorded via an external fiber output connected to the Leica SP5 X scan head and coupled to a Hamamatsu HPM-100-40 Hybrid detector (Becker & Hickl), which has a time resolution of 120 ps. Donor fluorescence emission was obtained using a 470–500 nm band pass filter. Images of 128 × 128 pixels were acquired with acquisition times of 120 s. FRET-FLIM analysis in Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts was performed as described previously (CITATION). Extended Experimental Procedures Protein Expression and Purification Regions corresponding to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Arabidopsis ARF1 (At1g59750; residues 1-354) and ARF5 (At1g19850; residues 1-390) were amplified from cDNA clones using primers as listed in CITATION using Phusion Flash polymerase (Finnzymes), and cloned in an expression vector pTWIN1 (New England Biolabs), modified for Ligation-Independent Cloning (LIC; (CITATION) to generate fusions with Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) and Intein. An adaptor, generated by annealing primers WB017 (5′-ctagaaataattttgtttaactttaagaaggagaattcttactcccaatcaatg-3′) and WB018 (5′- gcacattgattgggagtaagaattctccttcttaaagttaaacaaaattattt −3′), was ligated into XbaI/SapI-digested pTWIN1vector. ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD were LIC-cloned in the EcoRI site introduced through the adaptor. All clones were confirmed by sequencing. ARF-DBD-CBD fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta DE3 (Novagen). For all except the ARF1-DBD-SeMet protein, three liters of Difco Terrific Broth (BD), supplemented with 100 mg/l ampicillin was inoculated with 30 ml of an overnight culture and after growth to OD600 of 0.5-0.7, protein expression was induced by adding 0.3 mM IPTG and switching temperature from 37°C to 20°C and continue growth for 20 hr. For ARF1-DBD-SeMet protein, cells were grown over night at 37°C in LB medium, and diluted twice 1:100 in M9 medium supplemented with amino acids (L-Lys, L-Phe and L-Thr at 100 mg/l; L-Iso, L-Leu and L-Val at 50 mg/l) and 50 mg/l L-Selenomethionine, and grown to OD600 of 0.5. Next, expression was induced as above. Cells (appr. 75 g) were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and resuspended in 50 ml extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40 and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8, 10 mg of DNase and 0.2 mM PMSF). Cells were lysed by passing the suspension twice through a French Pressure cell at 10,000 psi and cell free extract was generated by centrifugation for one hour at 50,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a chitin column (New England Biolabs) with 25 ml bed volume, and washed with 10 column volumes wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) using an AKTA explorer 100 (GE Healthcare). ARF-DBD proteins were eluted by 1 hr incubation with 40 mM DTT in wash buffer. Proteins were concentrated into a final volume of approximately 1 ml using Amicon ultra-15 10K spin filters, and next passed over a Superdex 200PG size-exclusion chromatography column with dimensions 26 mm by 100 cm. Protein was eluted in washing buffer with 1 mM DTT. ARF-DBD proteins typically eluted at approximately 350 ml, and were concentrated using Amicon ultra-15 10K spin filters, and stored until use at −80°C. Protein concentration was measured at 280 nm (value of 1.2 corresponded to 1 mg/ml) using a Nanodrop 2000C (Thermo scientific). About 20 mg of ARF1-DBD and 10 mg of ARF5-DBD was obtained from a typical isolation, and purity was typically > 95% based on Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE. Crystal Growth and Data Collection ARF1-DBD-SeMet Crystals were grown from a 1+1 μl drop of, respectively, 7 mg/ml protein solution and crystallization buffer (2.0-2.3 M NaFormate, 100 mM MES 6.5, 50 mM KI, 10 mM GSH/GSSG).

A 1:1 mixture of ARF1DBD and ER7, respectively was prepared with final concentration of ARF1DBD of 4 mg/ml. Crystals were grown from a 100 nl+100 nl drop of, respectively, complex and crystallization buffer (10% PEG 20K, Glycine pH 8.5, 7.5% propanediol). The needle-shaped crystals appeared after 5 days and reached maximum size after 15 days. The crystals were frozen in crystallization buffer supplemented with 15% glycerol. X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at beamline ID14-1 (ESRF, Grenoble). ARF1-DBD G245A Mutation Abbreviation: A1D-G245A.

Block-shaped crystals appeared after 1 day and grew to their maximum size in 2 days and were immediately frozen in crystallization buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol. X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at beamline XALOC (ALBA, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain). All data were processed using iMosflm (CITATION) and SCALA (CITATION). Structure Determination and Refinement The initial structure was solved using the hkl2map interface (CITATION) to SHELXC/D/E (CITATION) using SAD data measured at the Se K absorption edge on SeMet ARF1-DBD. Refinement was performed using REFMAC v. 5.7.0032 (CITATION) of the CCP4 program suite (CITATION). Visualization and manual adjustments were done using Coot v. 0.7 (CITATION). The refinement statistics and model validation parameters of the crystal structures are given in CITATION. Figures were prepared using Pymol (CITATION) and the ESPript Server (CITATION). The ClustalW online server was used for sequence alignments (CITATION). SAXS Measurements A volume of 25 μl of ARF1-DBD, purified as described above, was diluted with 50 μl of buffer BS (20 mM TRIS 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM DTT) and immediately concentrated to a final concentration of 3.2 mg/ml over a 10 kDa centricon (Sigma-Aldrich). SAXS data were immediately collected at beamline BM29 (ESRF, Grenoble), using the concentrators flow-through as buffer. BSA references were used for calculating the molecular mass of ARF1DBD. Measurements were carried out at 293 K, within a momentum transfer range of 0.01 Å−1 < s < 0.45 Å−1, where s = 4πsin(θ)/λ and 2θ is the scattering angle. No measurable radiation damage was detected on comparison of three successive time frames of 10 s exposure. Buffer subtraction and extrapolation to infinite dilution, as well as evaluation of the Guinier region and calculation of the Porod volume were performed by the program PRIMUS (CITATION) in accordance with standard procedures. Calculation of the theoretical scattering curves of monomeric and dimeric ARF1 against the scattering data was performed using CRYSOL (CITATION). Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore 3000 platform. Labeled oligonucleotides (1 μM 5′-biotin; Eurogentec; CITATION) were made double stranded by incubation with 1.2 μM nonlabeled complement at 99°C and slowly cooled before being immobilized on an SA chip (GE Healthcare) to 100 to 120 response units. Proteins were diluted in SPR buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween20 and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4) in eight two-fold dilution steps (800nM, 400 nM, 200 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 12.5 nM, 6.25 nM). Flow during the measurement of the sensorgram was 40 μl per minute. Samples were injected starting with a buffer injection and then the lowest (6.25 nM) concentration. After each injection the chip was regenerated by injection of 40 μl 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Flow channel 1 was always underivatized and used as a reference blank in analysis. Data were analyzed with Scrubber2-T200 (BioLogic Software Pty Ltd) with normalization to zero over 10 to 30 s before injection, cropped to remove SDS wash and aligned at injection start. The signal from the closest buffer injection was subtracted. Equilibrium binding constants (KD) were derived by plotting the average RU values of the last 10 s of protein injection prior to washing, relative to protein concentrations (CITATION). Protein-Binding Microarrays PBM11 (CITATION) was performed on ARF1-DBD, ARF5-DBD and their mutated versions H170A, G171A, R215A, P218A, S269N and G279E. The synthesis in situ of double-stranded DNA and processing of slides were as described (CITATION) but omitting the blocking steps. The binding mixture volume was adjusted to 170 μl and contained 2% milk, 0.5 μg of denatured herring sperm DNA and 135 μl of the protein extract supernatant. This was obtained by dissolving the pellet of a 25 ml bacterial culture (as described above) in 1.5 ml of AP2 binding buffer 4X [10 mm 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (TRIS)-HCl pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 200 mg ml−1 BSA, 0.2% nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol(NP40)] with 1 mM PMSF. The pellets were dissolved by vortexing then sonicated and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, after which the supernatant was used. The binding mixture was deposited onto the slide, covered with a LifterSlip (22 × 65 mm; Erie Scientific, http://www.eriescientific.com/) and incubated in a humid chamber for 2.5 hr at room temperature. Slides were washed three times in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-1% Tween 20 (5 min), 3 × in PBS-0.01% Triton X-100 (5 min) and dried. DNA–protein complexes were incubated with 20 μg of rabbit polyclonal serum against Chitin Binding Domain (MBL, https://ruo.mbl.co.jp) in PBS–2% milk for 16 hr at room temperature. Slides were washed 3 × in PBS-0.05% Tween 20, 3 × in PBS-0.01% Triton X-100 (5 min each wash) and dried. Labeling of DNA–protein complexes was performed by incubating the microarrays with 0.4 μg of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) DyLight 550 conjugated (ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS–2% milk for 3 hr at room temperature, followed by the same washes as before and the slides were then dried for scanning. Two different images were obtained for each microarray at DNA Microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies) and quantified in the Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies). One corresponded to double-stranded DNA at 635 nm. The second image was obtained after labeling of DNA–protein complexes at 532 nm. The combination of the files, normalization and adjustment of the probe intensities and transformation to a list of scores for all the k-mers considered was carried out with the PBM Analysis Suite (CITATION). The best-scored motif, represented as an energy-based matrix, was converted into a graphical logo with the on-line tool enoLOGOS (http://biodev.hgen.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/enologos/enologos.cgi). Regions corresponding to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Arabidopsis ARF1 (At1g59750; residues 1-354) and ARF5 (At1g19850; residues 1-390) were amplified from cDNA clones using primers as listed in CITATION using Phusion Flash polymerase (Finnzymes), and cloned in an expression vector pTWIN1 (New England Biolabs), modified for Ligation-Independent Cloning (LIC; (CITATION) to generate fusions with Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) and Intein. An adaptor, generated by annealing primers WB017 (5′-ctagaaataattttgtttaactttaagaaggagaattcttactcccaatcaatg-3′) and WB018 (5′- gcacattgattgggagtaagaattctccttcttaaagttaaacaaaattattt −3′), was ligated into XbaI/SapI-digested pTWIN1vector. ARF1-DBD and ARF5-DBD were LIC-cloned in the EcoRI site introduced through the adaptor. All clones were confirmed by sequencing. ARF-DBD-CBD fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta DE3 (Novagen). For all except the ARF1-DBD-SeMet protein, three liters of Difco Terrific Broth (BD), supplemented with 100 mg/l ampicillin was inoculated with 30 ml of an overnight culture and after growth to OD600 of 0.5-0.7, protein expression was induced by adding 0.3 mM IPTG and switching temperature from 37°C to 20°C and continue growth for 20 hr. For ARF1-DBD-SeMet protein, cells were grown over night at 37°C in LB medium, and diluted twice 1:100 in M9 medium supplemented with amino acids (L-Lys, L-Phe and L-Thr at 100 mg/l; L-Iso, L-Leu and L-Val at 50 mg/l) and 50 mg/l L-Selenomethionine, and grown to OD600 of 0.5. Next, expression was induced as above. Cells (appr. 75 g) were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and resuspended in 50 ml extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40 and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8, 10 mg of DNase and 0.2 mM PMSF). Cells were lysed by passing the suspension twice through a French Pressure cell at 10,000 psi and cell free extract was generated by centrifugation for one hour at 50,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a chitin column (New England Biolabs) with 25 ml bed volume, and washed with 10 column volumes wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) using an AKTA explorer 100 (GE Healthcare). ARF-DBD proteins were eluted by 1 hr incubation with 40 mM DTT in wash buffer. Proteins were concentrated into a final volume of approximately 1 ml using Amicon ultra-15 10K spin filters, and next passed over a Superdex 200PG size-exclusion chromatography column with dimensions 26 mm by 100 cm. Protein was eluted in washing buffer with 1 mM DTT. ARF-DBD proteins typically eluted at approximately 350 ml, and were concentrated using Amicon ultra-15 10K spin filters, and stored until use at −80°C. Protein concentration was measured at 280 nm (value of 1.2 corresponded to 1 mg/ml) using a Nanodrop 2000C (Thermo scientific). About 20 mg of ARF1-DBD and 10 mg of ARF5-DBD was obtained from a typical isolation, and purity was typically > 95% based on Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE.
