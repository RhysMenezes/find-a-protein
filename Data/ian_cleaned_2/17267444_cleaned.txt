!~ABS~! The actin-nucleating ARP2-ARP3 complex controls cell shape in plants in many different cell types. Its activity is controlled by a multimeric complex containing BRK1 (also known as HSPC300), NAP1, SRA1, ABI and SCAR/WAVE. In this study, we focus on the function of the five putative SCAR homologues in Arabidopsis and we provide biochemical evidence that AtSCAR2 can activate the ARP2-ARP3 complex in vitro. Among the single mutants, mutations in only AtSCAR2 result in a subtle or weak phenotype similar to ARP2, ARP3 and other `distorted' mutants. Double-mutant analysis revealed a redundancy with AtSCAR4. Systematic application of the yeast two-hybrid system and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) revealed a complex protein-interaction network between the ARP2-ARP3 complex and its genetically defined regulators. In addition to protein interactions known in other systems, we identified several new interactions, suggesting that SPIKE1 may be an integral component of the SCAR/WAVE complex and that SCAR proteins in plants might act as direct effectors of ROP GTPases.
!~RES~! In order to assess the function of the Arabidopsis SCAR/WAVE homologues, we analysed several insertion mutants in the four AtSCAR genes and in AtSCAR-LIKE. For each line we isolated a homozygous mutant line and determined the exact insertion site. The GABI-KAT line 447E03 (scar1-1) has an insertion in the fourth exon of AtSCAR1, 2369 bp downstream of the ATG. The SALK line 039449 (scar2-1) has an insertion after 498 bp in the second intron of AtSCAR2, the SALK line 036419 (scar2-2) in the sixth exon after 2116 bp, and the SALK line 124023 (scar2-3) in the sixth exon after 3503 bp. The SALK line 630493 (scar3-1) has an insertion in the third exon of AtSCAR3, 1221 bp downstream of the ATG. In the SALK line 616410 (scar4-1) the insertion was found in the third intron of AtSCAR4 after 694 bp, and in the GABI-KAT line 126B09 (scar4-2) in the seventh exon after 2235 bp. The SALK line 555413 (scar-like1) has an insertion in the first intron of AtSCAR-LIKE 480 bp downstream of the ATG, the SALK line 504474 (scar-like-2) has an insertion in exon four after 1473 bp, and the GABI-KAT line 411H03 (scar-like-3) in exon seven after 6591 bp (Fig. 1A). RT-PCRs were carried out by amplifying a fragment located 3′ of all the insertions to determine the expression levels in the mutants. We detected no expression in at least one allele of each of the four AtSCAR genes and AtSCAR-LIKE, indicating that these represent real null-mutants (Fig. 1A). In a previous study it was shown that AtSCAR2 is normally only expressed in cotyledons, siliques and rosette leaves but not in flower buds or roots (CITATION). In our hands, AtSCAR2 expression was found in all tissues analysed including the root, the cotyledons, the stem, the rosette leaves, the cauline leaves and the inflorescence (Fig. 1B). In addition the expression profiles of the other Arabidopsis SCAR homologues were different to that previously published (Fig. 1B). In particular, we found that all Arabidopsis SCAR homologues are expressed in roots. In addition we showed that AtSCAR1 transcript is specifically absent in seedlings and that AtSCAR-LIKE is absent in the stem. In order to test whether the four AtSCAR genes and AtSCAR-LIKE gene are involved in ARP2-ARP3 complex-dependent cell morphogenesis, we analysed cell types known to be affected in arp2-arp3 complex mutants including trichomes, epidermal pavement cells, root hairs and hypocotyls cells. All three atscar2 alleles analysed in this study exhibited a weak distorted phenotype reminiscent of arp2-arp3 complex mutant trichomes. Branches of atscar2 trichomes are often twisted and variable in length (Fig. 2A-F). The effect on branch formation was studied using the criteria developed in Zhang and co-workers (CITATION). The branch positioning defect was quantified by measuring the distance between the first and the second branch point of 100 trichomes of ten leaves in each mutant line. Also, the relative arrangement of atscar2 branches was affected (Fig. 2D,E,F) in a manner similar to arp2-arp3 complex mutants (CITATION). In wild-type trichomes, the second branch is found on average 11 μm above the first branching point. In the three alleles of atscar2 analysed in more detail, SALK-039449 (scar2-1), SALK-036419 (scar2-2) and SALK-124023 (scar2-3), the branch point was found 34, 33 and 31μ m above the first branching point. Using the Student's t test we confirmed that the interbranch zone lengths of the three mutants are significantly different from wild type (P=0.0001, t=9.27). This indicates that the relative positions of branch points are affected in atscar2 mutants. The distance between the two branch points in the mutant lines of the other three AtSCAR genes and AtSCAR-LIKE was not significantly different from wild type (Fig. 2Q).   [[FIGURE]] Epidermal cell lobe phenotypes associated with ARP2-ARP3 complex mutations and mutations of ARP2-ARP3 complex regulators suggest that ARP2-ARP3 complex activity affects the development of plant epidermal lobes by influencing either the magnitude of lobe expansion (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) or cell-cell adherence following lobe intercalation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Surprisingly, the atscar2 mutants showed well-developed epidermal lobes. In order to detect a mild lobing phenotype we quantified the lobe formation by calculating the complexity of 100 individual pavement cells on ten mature rosette leaves per mutant line using the formula: complexity= (perimeter)2/(4×p×area). Compared with wild-type plants (complexity=2.4) none of the mutant lines of the four AtSCAR genes and AtSCAR-LIKE showed a significant difference concerning the pavement cell complexity. In arp2-arp3 complex mutants the hypocotyl epidermal cells also show morphogenetic defects when grown in the dark. During etiolation, hypocotyl cell elongation is drastically increased and represents a challenging mode of growth for some cytoskeletal mutants. As shown in Fig. 2G-I, the dark-grown atscar2 lines occasionally exhibit severe cell expansion and adherence defects such that in some instances cells tear out of the epidermal tissue layer and bend away from the surface. This phenotype was absent in the other atscar and atscar-like mutants. Root hair growth was normal in all atscar and atscar-like mutants.   [[FIGURE]] The aspects of the atscar2 phenotype described above are due to either reduced or misdirected cell growth. It was therefore surprising to find that the petioles of the cotyledons are drastically elongated in atscar2 mutants (Fig. 2J,K,L). This phenotype was also found in a mutant affecting ARP2-ARP3 complex function, the distorted1 mutant, and in a regulator of the ARP2-ARP3 complex, the nap1 mutant called gnarled (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The analysis of the cellular phenotype revealed that the elongation of the petiole is due to increased cell elongation of petiole cells. In wild-type petioles the epidermal cells are, on average, 0.82 mm long. The average length in homozygous SALK-039449 (scar2-1) and SALK-124023 (scar2-3) lines is 1.67 mm and 2.1 mm, respectively. This twofold increase in average cell length indicates that the ARP2-ARP3 pathway counteracts cell elongation in these cells. The petioles in the other atscar and atscar-like mutants were normal. One explanation for the finding that atscar2 mutants show a weak phenotype and that the other atscar mutants show no obvious phenotype is a redundancy of gene function between members of the AtSCAR family. We tested this possibility by creating various double mutants. A striking enhancement of the atscar2 phenotype was found when atscar2 mutants were combined with atscar4 alleles. Both atscar2; atscar4 double mutants and mutants homozygous for atscar2 and heterozygous for atscar4 showed an equally severe phenotype indistinguishable from strong `distorted' mutants (Fig. 2M-P). This indicates that in an atscar2 mutant background the reduction of AtSCAR4 gene dosage leads to a severe phenotype reflecting a redundant action between the two genes. All other double-mutant combinations tested, including atscar1; atscar3, atscar1; atscar5, atscar3; atscar4, atscar2; atscar-like showed no obvious actin-related phenotype. The similarity between aspects of the atscar2 phenotype to arp2-arp3 complex mutants would suggest that AtSCAR2 activates the Arabidopsis ARP2-ARP3 complex. Rabbit muscle skeletal G-actin (10% pyrenelated) at a concentration of 4 mM was polymerised in the presence of bovine ARP2-ARP3 (500 nM) and either AtSCAR2 GST-VCA (160 nM) or GST only. In animals, the VCA domain brings together actin monomers and the actin-nucleating ARP2-ARP3 complex and consists of three homology domains (V, which binds to an actin monomer; C, cofilin homology domain; A, acidic region that associates with the ARP2-ARP3 complex) (CITATION). Fig. 3 shows that ARP2-ARP3 activity is stimulated by AtSCAR2 GST-VCA, whereas AtSCAR2 GST-VCA alone does not accelerate polymerization. Consequently AtSCAR2 has the potential to act as an activator of the ARP2-ARP3 complex in vivo. Epidermal lobe phenotypes exhibited by mutant subunits of the ARP2-ARP3 complex and by mutant arp2-arp3 complex regulators suggest that ARP2-ARP3 complex activity affects the development of pavement cell lobes and the subsequent intercalation of lobes between neighbouring epidermal cells. Mutations of the maize HSPC300 homologue BRICK1 and Arabidopsis ARP2 and ARP3 are associated with the loss or mis-localisation of F-actin structures within epidermal lobes (CITATION; CITATION). The AtSCAR2 protein fused to GFP was created and proven to be functional by demonstrating that it can rescue the atscar2 mutant phenotype. As we could not detect fluorescence in these lines, we expressed AtSCAR2-GFP in single epidermal pavement cells transiently by particle bombardment. AtSCAR2-GFP localises to the cytoplasm of initiating cell lobes without any preference to particular cell regions (Fig. 4). Occasionally we found apparent concentrations in lobes, but this was always colocalised with co-transformed cytoplasmic RFP.   [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] Arabidopsis retains five SCAR isoforms, yet mutant alleles of only one isoform produce `distorted'-like phenotypes. Combining atscar2 alleles with atscar4 alleles is sufficient to reproduce the null-phenotype of arp2-arp3 complex mutants. The requirement for a total of five isoforms could be explained by functional specialisation between the AtSCAR isoforms. We addressed the question of functional specificity among the members of the protein families involved in the ARP2-ARP3 complex regulatory pathway by analysing protein-protein interactions. In Arabidopsis NAP1, SRA1 and HSPC300/BRICK1 are single copy genes, whereas SCAR/WAVE is represented by five, ABI by four, and ROP by eleven homologous genes. We used a systematic yeast two-hybrid approach to test all possible combinations of interactions between components of the ARP2-ARP3 complex, the SCAR/WAVE activator complex, representative ROPs and SPIKE1 and whether they can dimerise. We applied BiFC technology to detect and confirm interactions in planta. With this technique we focused on the most relevant and in particular the new unexpected interactions. In total we tested 67 different protein combinations with the BiFC system. In 45 cases we could reconfirm the yeast two-hybrid result in planta (Table 1).    Summary of protein-interaction tests involving components of the Arabidopsis ARP2-ARP3 complex and upstream regulators  In addition to known or expected interactions, the resulting network of interactions revealed several interesting novel possible functional relationships (Fig. 6, Table 1). The array of yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed partnering selectivity between the members of SCAR/WAVE and ABI proteins (Fig. 6, Table 1). Interaction with all four ABI proteins was found in the case of AtSCAR3 only. AtSCAR2 interacts with ABI1, 2 and 4, AtSCAR1 and AtSCAR-LIKE interact with ABI 1 and 2, whereas no interaction between AtSCAR4 and any ABI protein could be found. Several combinations were selected for confirmation in BiFC assays (Table 1). Interactions between these proteins were always found in the cytoplasm without preference to the plasma membrane or the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the five SCAR homologues from A. thaliana differ in their ability to interact with the HSPC300 homologue BRICK1. Interaction could be detected between HSPC300/BRICK1 and AtSCAR1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas AtSCAR4 and AtSCAR-LIKE were not able to activate reporter gene expression in yeast (Fig. 6, Table 1). Both examples tested in BiFC were found to interact in the cytoplasm. We found that BRICK1 homodimerises, and physically interacts with all four ABI proteins. HSPC300/BRICK1 homodimerisation (Fig. 5G,H) and the interaction between HSPC300/BRICK1 and ABI4 have been confirmed in planta by BiFC (Table 1). A physical interaction between HSPC300/BRICK1 and ABI proteins indicates potential cooperativity in a ternary complex formed by HSPC300/BRICK1, ABI and AtSCAR proteins, equivalent to the interactions within the animal complex suggested by the work of Gautreau et al. (CITATION). We further found that NAP1 also homodimerises and interacts with two ABI proteins (ABI 1 and 2) and with SRA1 (Fig. 6, Table 1). NAP1 might therefore act as an adaptor protein recruiting SRA1 to the SCAR/WAVE complex in a manner similar to that reported for the mammalian NAP1 protein (CITATION). Several anchoring possibilities link subunits of the SCAR/WAVE complex with the ARP2-ARP3 complex. In accordance with published data, the ARP2-ARP3 subunits ARPC3 and ARP3 seem to be central in this respect. We identified interactions between both ARP3 and ARPC3 and AtSCAR3, HSPC300/BRICK1 and ABI1 and 2. ABI4 interacted only with ARP3. Furthermore, AtSCAR1 and AtSCAR2 have been found to interact with ARPC3. AtSCAR4, AtSCAR-LIKE and ABI3 did not bind to components of the ARP2-ARP3 complex (Fig. 6, Table 1). That AtSCAR4 shows no interactions with components of the ARP2-ARP3 complex is surprising as it has been shown that the C-terminus can activate the bovine ARP2-ARP3 complex (CITATION). Whether this finding is due to our particular experimental setup or whether this reflects that the rest of the AtSCAR4 protein can regulate the binding to the ARP2-ARP3 complex remains to be determined. Interactions of AtSCAR1 and AtSCAR2 with ARPC3, and interactions between HSPC300/BRICK1 and ARP3 and ARPC3, respectively, have been confirmed by BiFC in planta. We also assessed the interactions between components of the ARP2-ARP3 complex. Based on the two-hybrid system, ARPC4 functions as an integral component as it interacts with ARPC1, ARPC2, ARPC3 and ARPC5. Two of these interactions have exemplarily been confirmed in planta (Fig. 6, Table 1). Similar protein interactions have been detected by yeast two-hybrid analyses in the human ARP2-ARP3 complex (CITATION). Our data indicate additionally direct contact between ARP2 and ARP3. With the exception of a physical interaction of ARPC4 and ARPC5, our data fit with the inter-subunit contacts revealed by the 3D structure of the bovine complex (CITATION), indicating a structural conservation from mammals to plants. Our protein interaction network reveals a novel interesting link between AtSCAR proteins and ROP GTPases. For the yeast two-hybrid assays we used either the unmodified full-length ROP cDNAs or single point mutations leading to the constitutively active (CA) form or, for the ROP7 protein, the dominant negative (DN) form. The constitutively active form carries the amino acid exchange Glycine 15 to Valine (ROP7CA), Glycine 17 to Valine (ROP2CA, ROP11CA), Glycine 27 to Valine (ROP8CA), and the dominant negative form the Threonine 20 to Asparagine exchange (ROP7DN). The unmodified ROP5 interacted with AtSCAR1, AtSCAR2 and AtSCAR4; ROP7 interacted in both the wild type and the constitutively active form with AtSCAR2 but did not interact with AtSCAR2 in the dominant negative form; ROP8 interacted in both forms with AtSCAR2 and AtSCAR3, whereas only the unmodified form interacted with AtSCAR1, and constitutively active ROP11 interacted with AtSCAR1, AtSCAR2 and AtSCAR4 (Fig. 6, Table 1). These findings are very interesting because, to our knowledge, no interactions between SCARs and small Rho-like GTPases have been reported previously. The constitutively active and the dominant negative forms of ROP7 interacted differentially with AtSCAR2 indicating that AtSCAR2 might be a downstream effector of ROP7. Because this question cannot be unambiguously answered with the yeast two-hybrid system, we applied the BiFC technology to investigate the interactions between ROP GTPases and AtSCAR proteins in planta. Upon co-expression of either wild-type ROP7 or the constitutively active form with AtSCAR2 in onion cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts, respectively, we observed a strong fluorescence signal localised to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5A-C,E). In contrast, co-expression of the dominant negative form of ROP7 and AtSCAR2 did not result in any detectable yellow fluorescence (Fig. 5D). ROP GTPases cycle between the predominant inactive GDP-bound state in the cytoplasm and a membrane-associated active GTP-bound state. Transiently expressed wild-type ROP7 protein should mainly exist in the inactive form in the cytoplasm with a fraction of activated protein at the plasma membrane. The fact that in both the wild type and the constitutively active form we observe the reconstituted fluorescence signal only at the cell periphery indicates that AtSCAR2 interacts specifically with the activated form of ROP7, which is associated with the plasma membrane. Similarly we could detect a BiFC signal specifically at the plasma membrane upon co-expression of ROP2 and ROP8 with AtSCAR2.   [[FIGURE]] Similar to the mammalian SRA1 protein, the Arabidopsis SRA1 was previously shown to interact specifically with the activated form of a small Rho-like GTPase (ROP) ROP2 in plants (CITATION). We also tested this combination with two different vector systems with both possible bait and prey combinations and with the full length ROPs as well as with ROPs that carry a C-terminal deletion typically used in yeast two-hybrid systems to avoid artefacts due to mislocalisation. In our hands, however, none of the tested ROPs including ROP2, ROP 5, ROP7, ROP8 and ROP11 showed interaction with SRA1. In order to further assess the upstream regulation of the AtSCAR proteins and AtSCAR-LIKE we included the SPIKE1 protein in our analysis. Because of its sequence similarity to DOCK180 it has been speculated that SPIKE1 is a potential upstream regulator of ROPs (CITATION). We found interactions of SPIKE1 with wild-type forms of ROP2, ROP5 and ROP8, and with the constitutively active form of ROP11. This could support the proposed role of SPIKE1 as a ROP-GEF, but so far, we have not been able to confirm these yeast two-hybrid results with BiFC (Table 1). Another interesting finding from our systematic protein interaction analyses is a direct interaction between SPIKE1 and all four ABI proteins and four of five AtSCAR proteins. Interactions with ABI1 and with AtSCAR2, respectively, have been confirmed by BiFC (Fig. 5F, Table 1). This finding suggests SPIKE1 is a novel integral component of the Arabidopsis SCAR/WAVE complex.
!~MM~! All mutant lines were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre and GABI-Kat. Seeds were sterilised with 100% ethanol and treatment with 4% NaHCl2 solution with 0.01% Triton X100 followed by several washings with sterile water. Plants were grown on MS media with 1% glucose under continuous light at 22°C or in soil under long day conditions at 20°C. To confirm the T-DNA insertions in the AtSCAR genes, PCRs on genomic DNA with the following primers were carried out: AtSCAR1: GK_447E03: 447E03_fw (5′-CCACTGTTGCTCAGACA-TTGAC-3′), 447E03_rev (5′-GTGCTGCTACATCAGAGCTAC-3′) and the T-DNA specific primer 8409. AtSCAR2: SALK_039449: LP_39449 (5′-TATGGCTGGTCTCGTTGGCAT-3′), RP_39449 (5′-CACATTCAAAACACCATGAGCA-3′); SALK_036419: LP_36419 (5′-CCACCATGGAGTCGGAAACAG-3′), RP_36419 (5′-GGCAACGACCATCACGTTCTT-3′); SALK_57481: LP_57481 (5′-TGGAATCCGTTGTTGTAAAGCG-3′), RP_57481 (5′-GGTGTCCCTCCATTCCTCCAC-3′); SALK_36419: LP_36419 (5′-CCACCATGGAGTCGGAAACAG-3′), RP_36419 (5′-GCAACGACCATCACGTTCTT-3′); SALK_124023: LP_124023 (5′-CGGGAGTAGAGAAATTGGCGG-3′), RP_124023 (5′-GCTCTGATGGTGGAGACCCAA-3′) and the T-DNA specific primer LBb1. AtSCAR3: SALK_087926: LP_087926 (5′-GCTGGGAAAAGGATTAGGAGAA-3′), RP_087926 (5′-AAATTTTTGTTGCAAGTTAATTGAT-3′); SALK_630493: LP_630493 (5′-GCAAATGTCTTCCTGGAGTGA-3′), RP_630493 (5′-TGTCTTGACCCAAGGTGTCTG-3′) and the T-DNA specific primer LBb1. AtSCAR4: SALK_616410: LP_616410 (5′-CATGTGATGTCCGTGAATCCT-3′), RP_616410 (5′-CTATGGAATCAATCCCTTGGC-3′); GK_126B09: 126B09_fw (5′-GGCCAGTCTGGTTATCGTGATCG-3′), 126B09_rev (5′-CCAGGATTTGGTCAGCCGCAG-3′) and the T-DNA specific primers LBb1 (SALK) and 8409 (GK). AtSCAR-like: SALK_555413: LP_555413 (5′-GAGCGCTGACTCTATCCGTCT-3′), RP_555413 (5′-CTCTGTTTCATTTCTGCTGCG-3′); SALK_504474: LP_504474 (5′-GTGCTTCACTTTGTTCTTGCG-3′), RP_504474 (5′-GTAGGCTCTGAGTGGCATCCT-3′); GK_411H03: 411H03_fw (5′-CATCAGATTCCCACAGCTCAG-3′), 411H03_rev (5′-GAAGGTGAAGTACATAATGAGCC-3′) and the T-DNA specific primer LBb1 (SALK) and 8409 (GK). The PCR products were sequenced and the exact positions of the inserts determined. Full-length cDNAs encoding the proteins investigated in this study were amplified by PCR using primers containing attB1 and attB2 sites for GATEWAY recombination as described by Invitrogen. PCR products were recombined into pDONR201 (Invitrogen), and the resulting clones were further transferred to yeast two-hybrid vectors (pAS-attR and pACT-attR; J.F.U., unpublished), and to BiFC vectors (pBatTL; J.F.U., unpublished) by GATEWAY recombination (Invitrogen). Details of the numerous constructs and primers will be provided on request. The cDNA encoding the N-Terminal 346 amino acids of AtSCAR2, which contains the SCAR homology domain, was amplified with the primers WAVE4_fw (see above) and WAVE4_F1_rev (5′-attB2-tcatCCA CGGACCTCATTGTATGTAG-3′). For protein expression, the C-terminal fragment of AtSCAR2 encoding the last 153 amino acids containing the VCA domain was amplified using the primers 384VCAGATF (5′-attB1 TCCCTGATGCTTCAAATGCAGAAACTG-3′) and 384VCAGATR (5′-attB2-GATTTCAAGAATCACTCCAACTATCTG-3′). A C-terminal fragment encoding the last 236 amino acids of AtSCAR2 containing the VCA domain was amplified for use in yeast two-hybrid assays using the primers WAVE4_rev (5′-attB2-tTCAAGAATCACTCCAACTATCTG-3′) and WAVE_F2_fw (5′-attB1-CCTTATCAGGAGTGCATAGAGG-3′). The amplified cDNAs were inserted into pDONR201 or pDONR207 (Invitrogen). For localisation and rescue experiments, SCAR2 cDNA (CITATION) was transferred to GFP vector pMDC43 (CITATION) to form a GFP-SCAR2 fusion. Functionality of the GFP-SCAR2 fusion protein was proven by rescue of the scar2 mutant. Rescued plants were verified by testing homozygosity of the scar2 mutant alleles and the presence of the rescue construct. Total RNA was isolated by using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Centre) from the following tissues of wild-type Arabidopsis plants: seedlings, roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, stems and inflorescence. RNA was treated with DNaseI (MBI). First strand cDNA was then synthesised with the RevertAid H-Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI). A total of 33 cycles of PCR were performed with the indicated primers. Different dilutions of cDNA preparations were amplified with actin-specific primers to yield equal amounts of cDNA for each tissue. The normalised dilutions were then used for amplification with AtSCAR/WAVE-specific primers. The following primers were used for expression analysis: wave1-fw (5′-TTCGGAAATAAGTAGTGGCACTCATAG-3′); wave1-rev (5′-CCTCTTGCTTTCTCGGATACCTTCTG-3′); wave2-fw (5′-TGGTCGGGAGATTGTGGGAG-3′); wave2-rev (5′-TCCTTTCTGCGGAAACCACTAG-3′); wave3-fw (5′-CCACAGGACGCATATGAGGG-3′) wave3-rev (5′-GGCCAATCCGTCTTCCAGACA-3′); wave4-fw (5′-ACCAGCCACCATGGAGTCGGAAAC-3′) wave4-rev (5′-CCTTTCTTCCATCATTGCCTCCCT-3′) wave5-fw (5′-CCTATATAGCCCCTCAGAAGACCTACTTGTGC-3′) wave5-rev (5′-GCATCTTTCAGAGACGGGCATGAGAT-3′). cDNA isolated from each of the atscar and atscar-like mutants was treated in the same manner. The normalisation of cDNA was done by performing PCR with elongation factor 1-specific primers. The equally concentrated dilutions of cDNA were used to carry out the expression analysis of AtSCAR and AtSCAR-LIKE in each of the mutant alleles. The following primers were used to amplify a fragment 3′ of the T-DNA insertion (42 cycles): AtSCAR1: fw (5′-CAGAAGCTGGAGACTTCTTGC-3′), rev (5′-GAGAGACTCGAGATCATGTGTCGCTATCGCTCCATG-3′). AtSCAR2: fw (5′-ACCAGTGAGGCTGACAATTATGTGGACG-3′), rev (5′-AAACTTCCATCCCCACCCCAGCTG-3′). AtSCAR3: fw (5′-GCATGGTGACTTCTGCTCC-3′), rev (5′-GAGAGACTCGAGATTACGTATCACTCCATGTATCGC-3′). AtSCAR4: fw (5′-GAGCCTCAGGTTGATCACC-3′), rev (5′-GAGAGAGCGGCCGCACTCACTCGCTCCAGCTATCTG-3′). AtSCAR-LIKE: fw (5′-CCTATATAGCCCCTCAGAAGACCTACTTGTGC-3′), rev (5′-GCATCTTTCAGAGACGGGCATGAGAT-3′). The AtSCAR2 VCA domain was transferred using LR enzyme mix into GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham) containing the gateway cassette (Invitrogen). This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS Rosetta 2 expression cells (Novagen). Cells were induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM at 37°C for 3 hours. GST-tagged protein was recovered using glutathione sepharose 4B (Amersham) and dialysed against G-buffer. After buffer exchange the protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Polymerisation assays were performed using 4 mM actin in G-buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.02 % NaN3) with 10 % of monomers pyrenelated. Bovine ARP2-ARP3 was supplied by Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO, USA), and handled according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerisation was induced by the addition of 10× KME (500 mM KCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM Imidazole pH 6.5). Pyrene fluorescence was monitored using a PTI spectrofluorimeter equipped with a rotating multi-sample turret. For a general description of this method, see Mullins and Machesky (CITATION). Particle bombardment was carried out using a helium Helios gene gun (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Microcarriers of 1.0 μm diameter were prepared for DNA coating by washing several times with 70% ethanol and resuspending in a 50% v/v glycerol solution. The microcarriers were then coated with 1 mg of plasmid per 0.5 mg of gold (equivalent to one cartridge) as described by Kemp et al. (CITATION). Helium at a pressure of 150 psi was used for microcarrier acceleration. The bombarded cells were then placed at 22°C in an illuminated growth chamber and analysed after 24 hours. Arabidopsis cell suspension culture (Columbia ecotype; grown in MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L NAA and 0.1 mg/L KIN) was maintained as described previously (CITATION). Protoplast isolation and polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection was performed according to Mathur and Koncz (CITATION). The transfected cells were incubated at 23°C for 16 hours in the dark before microscopic observation. Yeast strains AH109 (CITATION) and Y187 (CITATION), were maintained in standard yeast full media or selective dropout media (Clontech) using standard conditions. Transformation of plasmids into yeast was done according to the LiAc transformation method (CITATION). Interaction of hybrid proteins was tested by crossing singly transformed cells or by co-transformation of yeast cells with subsequent plating onto synthetic dropout medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and onto synthetic dropout medium lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine supplemented with 3-20 mM 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). Recombinant hybrid proteins were tested for self-activation and nonspecific protein-binding properties. The adequate 3-AT concentrations suppressing unspecific reporter activation were determined individually for every bait construct.
