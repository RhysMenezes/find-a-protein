!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis wall-associated receptor kinase, Wak1, is a member of the Wak family (Wak1–5) that links the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix. By the yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that a glycine-rich extracellular protein, AtGRP-3, binds to the extracellular domain of Wak1. Further in vitro binding studies indicated that AtGRP-3 is the only isoform among the six tested AtGRPs that specifically interacts with Waks, and the cysteine-rich carboxyl terminus of AtGRP-3 is essential for its binding to Wak1. We also show that Wak1 and AtGRP-3 form a complex with a molecular size of ∼500 kDa in vivo in conjunction with the kinase-associated protein phosphatase, KAPP, that has been shown to interact with a number of plant receptor-like kinases. Binding of AtGRP-3 to Wak1 is shown to be crucial for the integrity of the complex. Wak1 and AtGRP-3 are both induced by salicylic acid treatment. Moreover, exogenously added AtGRP-3 up-regulates the expression of Wak1, AtGRP-3, and PR-1 (for pathogenesis-related) in protoplasts. Taken together, our data suggest that AtGRP-3 regulates Wak1 function through binding to the cell wall domain of Wak1 and that the interaction of Wak1 with AtGRP-3 occurs in a pathogenesis-related process in planta. 
!~RES~! To identify proteins that bind to the extracellular domain of Wak1, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screen (CITATION). A library of Arabidopsis seedling cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain was screened against the construct encoding the extracellular domain of Wak1 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Among the positive clones, of interest was AtGRP-3, which is a member of a previously described family of glycine-rich secreted cell wall proteins (CITATION). While we were trying to isolate full-length AtGRP-3 cDNA by PCR, we identified a closely related sequence that is 81% identical to AtGRP-3 and lacks ∼25 amino acids near the amino terminus (Fig. 1 A). This short form of AtGRP-3 will hereafter be referred to as AtGRP-3S.  [[FIGURE]] To confirm the interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3, the extracellular domain of Wak1 (ED/pGBT9) and full-length AtGRP-3 (AtGRP-3/pGAD424) or AtGRP-3S (AtGRP-3S/pGAD424) fusion constructs were cotransformed into a yeast reporter strain HF7c. The transformants were then tested for their ability to grow on selective plates lacking histidine and the expression of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 B). The results indicated that both AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S bind to the extracellular domain of Wak1.  To further confirm the interaction of Wak1 with AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S, an in vitro binding assay was performed (Fig.1 C). Purified GST (lane 1) or GST-extracellular domain of the Wak1 fusion protein (GST-ED) (lane 2) was incubated with the in vitro translated [35S]Cys-labeled AtGRP-3S (lane 3) or AtGRP-3 (lane 4). The resulting complexes were isolated by glutathione-Sepharose beads. Both AtGRP-3S and AtGRP-3 bound to GST-ED (lanes 6 and 8) but not to GST alone (lanes 5 and 7), indicating that Wak1 specifically interacts with both AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S.  FiveWak genes (Wak1–Wak5) (CITATION) and multipleAtGRP genes (CITATION, CITATION) from Arabidopsis have been identified previously. The complete Arabidopsis genome sequence also reveals the existence of additional Wak and GRP family members. Therefore, we tested whether the interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3 shown above is isoform-specific or whether it merely represents one of the general interactions between Waks and AtGRPs. The purified GST-ED was incubated with the in vitro translated [35S]Cys- or [35S]Met-labeled AtGRPs. The resulting complexes were collected by glutathione-Sepharose beads and separated on an SDS-gel (Fig.2 A). The results demonstrated that Wak1 binds only to AtGRP-3 but not to other tested AtGRPs (AtGRP-2, 4, 6, 7, 8). The binding specificity of AtGRP-3 was then tested against the five Wak isoforms. The in vitrotranslated [35S]Cys-labeled AtGRP-3 was incubated with the purified GST-ED of the Wak fusion proteins, and the complexes were analyzed (Fig. 2 B). The results indicated that AtGRP-3 binds to Wak1, Wak3, and Wak5. We obtained the same results with AtGRP-3S (data not shown), implying that AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S may play similar physiological roles. Notably, AtGRP-2, -4, -6, -7, and -8 did not bind to any of the Wak isoforms (data not shown), indicating that AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S are unique among AtGRPs in their ability to interact with Waks.  [[FIGURE]] We next localized the region in AtGRP-3 that is responsible for the interaction with Wak1. Constructs for the amino- and carboxyl-terminal deleted forms (AtGRP-dN and AtGRP-dC, respectively) and the carboxyl-terminal region (AtGRP-CT) of AtGRP-3 were generated (Fig.2 C). The proteins were in vitro translated and subjected to the in vitro binding assay with GST alone or GST-ED (Fig. 2 D). Interactions were observed with full-length AtGRP-3, AtGRP-dN, and AtGRP-CT but not with AtGRP-dC, indicating that the cysteine-rich carboxyl terminus is essential for the association of Wak1 and AtGRP-3.  We have generated anti-Wak1 and anti-AtGRP-3 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The anti-Wak1 antibody specifically recognized only the ED of Wak1 but not those of other tested Wak proteins (Fig. 3 A). Western blotting of Arabidopsis protein extracts with anti-Wak1 antibody detected two bands that migrate as ∼78- and 100-kDa proteins on an SDS-gel. Because the expected size of Wak1 is 78 kDa, the slowly migrating band is likely to be a post-translationally modified form (e.g. glycosylated) of Wak1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). Anti-AtGRP-3 antibody recognized an 18-kDa band that is larger than the expected 12 kDa of AtGRP-3 (lane 2). This discrepancy is unlikely to be due to a post-translational modification, because the in vitro translated (Fig. 1 C) or recombinant AtGRP-3 protein purified from E. coli (Fig.3 A) also migrated as an 18-kDa protein. Protein extracts from Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to immunoprecipitation with preimmune or anti- AtGRP-3 antibody (Fig.3 C). The precipitated proteins were separated on an SDS-gel and probed with anti-Wak1 antibody. The results showed that both 78- and 100-kDa Wak1 proteins were co-precipitated with AtGRP-3, indicating that Wak1 and AtGRP-3 form a complex in vivo. As KAPP has been shown to interact with a number of plant receptor-like kinases (CITATION), we tested whether KAPP is also associated with the Wak1·AtGRP-3 complex. The proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-AtGRP-3 antibody were probed with anti-KAPP antibody, which recognized a 65-kDa KAPP protein on a Western blot (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). The presence of KAPP in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 C) suggests that KAPP is a component of the complex that includes Wak1 and AtGRP-3.  To further analyze the protein complex of Wak1, AtGRP-3, and KAPP, protein extracts of Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to size exclusion chromatography. The fractions were then probed with anti-Wak1, anti-AtGRP-3, and anti-KAPP antibodies (Fig.4 A). The molecular sizes were extrapolated from a standard curve prepared with a set of marker proteins. Wak1 proteins were present in two complexes with the apparent molecular sizes of 500 and 200 kDa, respectively. It is noticeable that 100- and 78-kDa Wak1 proteins were separated into the 500- and 200-kDa complexes. AtGRP-3 was fractionated along with the 500-kDa complex but not with the 200-kDa complex. This suggests that AtGRP-3 is stably associated with the 100-kDa Wak1 in the 500-kDa complex. AtGRP-3, which runs as a 48-kDa protein, is likely the unbound form of AtGRP-3. KAPP was detected mostly in the range of 500 to 600 kDa, implying the association of KAPP with a number of receptor-like kinases as reported (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] To elucidate the role of AtGRP-3 in the formation of the 500-kDa complex, we analyzed protein extracts of protoplasts by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4 B). AtGRP-3 was completely absent in the protoplasts as determined by Western blotting. In the absence of AtGRP-3, Wak1 was detected mostly in the 200-kDa complex (−AtGRP-3). Upon the addition of the recombinant AtGRP-3 protein to protoplasts, Wak1 reappeared associated with the 500-kDa complex, and the added AtGRP-3 was also eluted along with the 500-kDa complex (+AtGRP-3). These data suggest that AtGRP-3 is essential to the structural integrity and/or probably the formation of the 500-kDa complex that includes Wak1 and AtGRP-3. The recombinant AtGRP-dC, which lacks the 35 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, was ineffective (+AtGRP-dC), suggesting that the direct interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3 is critical for the formation and/or maintenance of the integrity of the 500-kDa complex.  In an effort to evaluate the biological relevance of the interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3, we examined the expression pattern of Wak1 and AtGRP-3 inArabidopsis tissues by Northern analysis. Wak1and AtGRP-3 were co-expressed predominantly in leaves and stems (Fig. 5 A), which is consistent with previous reports (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). It was also shown thatWak1 expression is induced by SA and that this induction requires the positive regulator NPR1/NIM1 (CITATION). We thus analyzed the expression of Wak1 and AtGRP-3 in response to SA. Northern analysis showed that both AtGRP-3 andWak1 were induced upon SA treatment (Fig. 5 B). This induction was abolished by mutation in npr1 and by overexpression of nahG, which degrades SA (CITATION, CITATION) (Fig. 5 C). These data suggest that the functions of Wak1 and AtGRP-3 are closely related and implicated in the SA signaling.  [[FIGURE]] We tested by RT-PCR whether the treatment of protoplasts with AtGRP-3 resulted in the regulation of gene expression (Fig. 6). The expression ofWak1 and AtGRP-3 was up-regulated by the addition of AtGRP-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, Aand C), indicating that Wak1 andAtGRP-3 are in a positive feedback loop that enhances AtGRP-3·Wak1 signaling. The addition of AtGRP-3 to protoplasts also induced PR-1, a molecular marker of SA-dependent defense response, but not PDF1.2 (for plantdefensin), a molecular marker of jasmonic acid-dependent defense response (CITATION, CITATION). It is worth noting that the expression of Wak1 andAtGRP-3 was induced by SA (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to AtGRP-3, the exogenously added AtGRP-dC and bovine serum albumin scarcely affected the expression level of the tested genes (Fig. 6,B and D). Taken together with the fact that AtGRP-3 binds to Wak1 in a specific manner, these data suggest that AtGRP-3 is a physiological ligand of Wak1 and that the AtGRP-3·Wak1 signaling pathway is involved in the SA-dependent defense response.

!~MM~! The MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used for screening. TheArabidopsis cDNA library was constructed in GAL4 activation domain vector (pGAD424) as described (CITATION). The bait construct was prepared by cloning the region for the extracellular domain of Wak1 (amino acids 178–334) into the GAL4 binding domain vector (pGBT9). The HF7c yeast strain was sequentially transformed with the bait construct and then with the cDNA library. Transformants (9 × 106) were screened for activation of theHIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. The full-lengthAtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S genes were isolated from the cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The interaction between the two proteins was quantitated by a liquid β-galactosidase assay usingO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate.  For Waks, the coding region for the extracellular domain was cloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions include amino acids 25–334 of Wak1, 23–328 of Wak2, 23–327 of Wak3, 23–331 of Wak4, and 20–280 of Wak5. AtGRP-3 (amino acids 25–145) was constructed in pET15b vector (Novagen), which produced a fusion protein with the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag. Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with the constructs were grown in LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A 600 0.4–0.5. The expression of Wak and AtGRP-3 proteins was then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 30 °C or for 2 h at 37 °C, respectively. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material and incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for Waks or with Ni2+ProBond (Invitrogen) for AtGRP-3. Fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions.  GST-Wak fusion proteins (3–5 μg) and [35S]Met or [35S]Cys-labeled in vitro translated AtGRPs were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B resins were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The resins were washed three times with the binding buffer and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography.  Polyclonal antibodies were raised in mouse to recombinant AtGRP-3 protein and in rabbit to Wak1-specific peptide (amino acids 98–112). The specificities of antibodies were confirmed with both recombinant proteins and plant extracts (Fig. 3, A and B). In Western analysis, the proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with these antibodies. The antibody-bound proteins were detected by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  [[FIGURE]]  Arabidopsis leaf tissues were incubated in protoplast isolation buffer (1% Cellulase Onozuka R-10, 0.25% Macerozyme R-10, 400 mm mannitol, 8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MES, pH 5.6, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 25 °C for 2.5–3 h with gentle shaking at 50–75 rpm, as described (CITATION). The isolated protoplasts were filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh and centrifuged for 10 min at 60 × g. The pelleted protoplasts were gently resuspended and washed two times with 500 mmmannitol. The protoplasts were resuspended to 1 × 106cells/ml in K3 medium (400 mm sucrose, 4.3 g/l Murashige and Skoog salts, 100 mg/liter myo-inositol, 250 mg/liter xylose, 460 mg/liter CaCl2, 10 mg/liter thiamine, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine, 1 mg/liter nicotinic acid, pH 5.8, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The isolated protoplasts were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or purified AtGRP-3 proteins at room temperature for the indicated time. The protoplasts were then harvested by centrifugation. In this step, most of unbound AtGRP-3 proteins are removed from protoplasts.  Protein extracts fromArabidopsis seedlings and protoplasts were prepared in extraction buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, protein phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I (Sigma), 1% Triton X-100). For gel filtration, proteins were extracted in extraction buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, protein phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein extracts were further centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad assay system.  An aliquot (1 mg of protein) in buffer A was incubated with preimmune or immune serum in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.  Protein extracts in buffer B were applied to size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography. Proteins were fractionated over a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the running buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.  RNA was extracted using 0.5 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.)/106 cells of protoplasts. Contaminated genomic DNA from total RNA was removed as described (CITATION). Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with 6 units of RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C. The activity of DNase I was inactivated by boiling. The RNA was then cleaned up using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed with 0.1 μg of total RNA using the Acess RT-PCR system (Promega).
