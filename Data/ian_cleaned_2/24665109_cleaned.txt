!~ABS~! In Arabidopsis thaliana, the degree of methylesterification (DM) of homogalacturonans (HGs), the main pectic constituent of the cell wall, can be modified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs). In all organisms, two types of protein structure have been reported for PMEs: group 1 and group 2. In group 2 PMEs, the active part (PME domain, Pfam01095) is preceded by an N-terminal extension (PRO part), which shows similarities to PME inhibitors (PMEI domain, Pfam04043). This PRO part mediates retention of unprocessed group 2 PMEs in the Golgi apparatus, thus regulating PME activity through a post-translational mechanism. This study investigated the roles of a subtilisin-type serine protease (SBT) in the processing of a PME isoform. Using a combination of functional genomics, biochemistry and proteomic approaches, the role of a specific SBT in the processing of a group 2 PME was assessed together with its consequences for plant development. A group 2 PME, AtPME17 (At2g45220), was identified, which was highly co-expressed, both spatially and temporally, with AtSBT3.5 (At1g32940), a subtilisin-type serine protease (subtilase, SBT), during root development. PME activity was modified in roots of knockout mutants for both proteins with consequent effects on root growth. This suggested a role for SBT3.5 in the processing of PME17 in planta. Using transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, it was indeed shown that SBT3.5 can process PME17 at a specific single processing motif, releasing a mature isoform in the apoplasm. By revealing the potential role of SBT3.5 in the processing of PME17, this study brings new evidence of the complexity of the regulation of PMEs in plants, and highlights the need for identifying specific PME–SBT pairs.
!~RES~! To identify putative PME–SBT pairs, we used the Expression Angler tool of the Bio-Analytic Resource for Plant Biology (BAR, http://bar.utoronto.ca/welcome.htm) and PME17 as the query. Among the top ten genes that were found to be co-expressed with PME17, SBT3.5 ranked number one with an R-value of 0·832 (Fig. 1A). Other genes on this list included amino acids biosynthesis-related (At2g29470, At1g06620, At2g38240) and response to stress-related (At2g35980, At4g37990) genes. Other SBTs (At1g32960) and other cell-wall-related genes were potentially co-expressed with PME17, but with much lower R-value (data not shown). To confirm PME17–SBT3.5 co-expression, we first used RT-qPCR to measure the relative expression of PME17 and SBT3.5 in various organs and developmental stages [mature seeds, siliques (S3–8 DAF, S9–17 DAF), flowers buds, stems, roots and leaves] of Arabidopsis Col-0. As compared with stably expressed reference genes, the relative expression of both genes followed the same trend in all organs and developmental stages tested, except for flower buds and mature seeds, where PME17 was expressed at very low levels, while SBT3.5 was strongly expressed (Fig. 1B, C). Expression of both genes was particularly high in roots of plants grown in vitro.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To localize the expression of PME17 and SBT3.5, approx. 1·5 kb of their promoters was PCR amplified and cloned upstream of a GUS coding sequence. Following plant transformation, GUS staining was visualized in light-grown seedlings during development. PME17 and SBT3.5 promoters were particularly active in roots, from 2 d after germination onwards (Fig. 2). Our results show that the activities of the promoters were overlapping, in particular in the root-hair zone, in lateral roots and in the root outer cell layer. While PME17 and SBT3.5 promoter activities were higher in primary roots than lateral roots, no apparent activity was detected in the central cylinder of the roots. Analysis of sequences revealed that specific transcription factor binding sites were conserved when comparing the PME17 and SBT3.5 promoters, including putative DNA binding sites for ARF, BES1/BIM1–3, BLR or LFY transcription factors (Supplementary Data Table S2). These transcription factors are known to regulate the expression of genes involved in control of cell-wall modifications and plant development.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Proteins from 10-d-old roots and cell-wall-enriched extracts isolated from Ws, Col-0, pme17–1 and sbt3.5–1 were resolved by SDS–PAGE and identified using LC-MS Orbitrap analyses. Thirty proteins that are potentially involved in HG modifications were identified in these extracts, including PME17 and SBT3.5 (Table 1). The analysis further revealed 13 specific peptides mapping PME17, ranging from amino acids 222 to 488, resulting in 56 % coverage of the predicted PME domain (Pfam01095, Fig. 3A). In contrast, no peptide mapping the putative PMEI domain (Pfam04043) was detected. Fourteen peptides ranging from amino acids 174 to 774 were identified for SBT3.5, covering 25 % of the sequence of the mature protease lacking SP and prodomain. Peptides were identified within the subtilase domain (Pfam00082), the protease-associated (PA) domain as well as in the fibronectin-III (Fn-III) domain, including the extreme C terminus (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Data Table S3). This suggests that SBT3.5, in contrast to, for example, cucumisin, is only processed at the N terminus of the protein. This is consistent with the reported relevance of the Fn-III domain and the C terminus for secretion and the stability of SBTs (CITATION; CITATION) and appears to be a common feature of Arabidopsis SBTs, given that for the majority of SBTs retrieved in our study, peptides mapping the C-terminal Fn-III domain of the protein were identified (Table S3). After sequence comparisons (Supplementary Data Fig. S1), the tomato subtilase (SlSBT3) was used as a template for the structural modelling of the SBT3.5 isoform (Supplementary Data Fig. S2). SBT3.5 showed the same overall structural organization as SlSBT3 with RMSD = 1·36 Å, TM score = 0·95298 for the modelled monomer, and RMSD = 6·73 Å, TM score = 0·60861 for the homodimer, respectively (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Two T-DNA insertion lines were identified for both PME17 and SBT3.5. The insertions were localized in the first exon and in the intron for pme17–1 (FLAG_208G03) and pme17–2 (SALK_059908), respectively. For SBT3.5, the insertions were localized in the first and second intron for sbt3.5–1 (SAIL_400F09) and sbt3.5–2 (GABI_672C08), respectively (Fig. 4A). PCR on 10-d-old root cDNAs confirmed pme17–1, sbt3.5–1 and sbt3.5–2 as true KO lines, while pme17–2 was a knock-down line which displayed, as assessed by qPCR, 100-fold reduction of target gene expression compared with the wild-type (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Levels of PME17 and SBT3.5 transcripts were further measured in the sbt3.5 and pme17 mutant backgrounds showing that SBT3.5 expression was significantly increased in the two pme17 mutant alleles. In parallel, PME17 transcript levels were increased by twofold in sbt3.5 mutants (Fig. 4C). Apparently, the plant compensates for the loss of PME17 function by overexpressing SBT3.5, and vice versa, which will need to be further investigated. pme17–1 and sbt3.5–1 were also confirmed as KO mutants by proteomic analysis, which did not detect any PME17- or SBT3.5-derived peptides in 10-d-old root cell wall-enriched protein extracts in mutants compared with respective wild-types (Table 1). Interestingly, peptides matching the mature part of PME17 were identified in sbt3.5–1, suggesting that other root SBTs (Table 1) could compensate for the lack of SBT3.5 and thus process PME17 into a mature active protein. In addition, peptides mapping to several other cell-wall proteins [SBTs, polygalacturonases (PGs), PMEs, pectin acetylesterases (PAEs)] were identified in roots of wild-type (Ws and Col-0), pme17–1 and sbt3.5–1, and some of these proteins appear to be differentially expressed in wild-type and mutant contexts. This included At3g62110 (PG), for which peptides were identified in sbt3.5–1 but not in the corresponding wild-type roots (Col-0). Peptides mapping At4g30020 (AtSBT2.6), At5g04960 (AtPME46) and At4g12390 (AtPMEI) were identified in pme17–1 but not in the corresponding wild-type (Ws). In contrast, peptides mapping AtSBT2.5 and At3g62110 were identified in Ws but not in pme17–1. These observations indicate that mutations in PME17 and SBT3.5 have consequences that go far beyond the sole extinction of the genes of interest, and these indirect effects may contribute to some of the phenotypes observed in the mutants.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The defects in PME17 and SBT3.5 expression lead to transient delay in germination at 24 h (Supplementary Data Fig. S3), which was unlikely to be related to changes in the release and structure of seed coat mucilage (data not shown), and a small but significant increase in the length of the primary root after 10 d of culture (Fig. 4D). Averages of 6 and 3 % increase in root length over the wild-type were observed for pme17 and sbt3.5 mutants, respectively. The results were similar for both mutant alleles, with a more marked effect for pme17–1 and sbt3.5–1. Thus, we further investigated the consequences of the mutations on PME activity and cell wall structure in these two lines. Using similar protein extraction procedures as described for proteomic analysis, we measured total PME activity in pme17–1 and sbt3.5–1 roots. A significant 20 and 13 % decrease in total PME activity was observed for pme17–1 and sbt3.5–1, respectively (Fig. 5A). The loss of SBT3.5 function could thus impair the processing of root-expressed PMEs, with consequent effects on the production of mature active isoforms. The decrease in total PME activity was related, at least for pme17–1, to a decrease in the activity of a PME isoform (pI = 9) revealed by IEF (Fig. 5B). In contrast, no apparent changes in the balance between the activities of PME isoforms could be observed when comparing sbt3.5–1 and wild-type plants. In accordance with proteomic analysis, this showed that PME17 was effectively processed in sbt3.5–1 by root-expressed SBTs, which could potentially compensate for the disappearance of SBT3.5. Together with in silico analysis, these results suggest that PME17 could be part of a pool of basic PME isoforms which also includes the previously identified PME3 (CITATION). To investigate whether the decrease in total PME activity in the pme17–1 mutant could be related to changes in the expression of some other PME and PMEI genes, the expression of PME2, PME3, PME32, PMEI4 and PMEI7 was assessed by RT-qPCR in 10-d-old roots. These five genes were previously reported to be expressed in roots and to play a role in pectin modifications during development (CITATION; CITATION). Our results showed that the expression of PME3 was significantly down-regulated (<2-fold) and that of PMEI4 up-regulated (>5-fold) in the pme17–1 mutant compared with the wild-type (Supplementary Data Fig. S4).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next we assessed the consequences of the mutations in PME17 and SBT3.5 on root cell-wall structure using FT-IR microspectroscopy at the site of the main promoter activities in the root-hair zone. A strong and highly significant (P < 0·001) increase in absorbance at 1735–1712 cm–1, the wavenumber assigned to one pattern of ester linkages, was observed for pme17–1 compared with the wild-type (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed for pme17–2 (Supplementary Data Fig. S5). A higher abundance of ester linkages is in accordance with the observed decrease in total PME activity in the mutant and confirms the biochemical activity of PME17. Significant differences in absorbance were also observed for other wavenumbers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In particular, a decrease in the absorbance for wavenumbers corresponding to amide bonds (1558 and 1511 cm–1), cellulose (1426, 1370 and 1317 cm–1), xyloglucan (1370 cm–1), pectin (1320 and 833 cm–1) and carboxylate of the pectin ester group (1630–1600 and 1400 cm–1) was observed in pme17–1 compared with the wild-type. In contrast, the absorbance for wavenumbers corresponding to the polysaccharide fingerprint of cellulose (1115 and 1033 cm–1), xyloglucan (1130, 1075 and 1042 cm–1) and pectin glycosidic link (1146 cm–1) were significantly increased in pme17–1 compared with wild-type. This suggests that alteration of PME activity had consequent effects on other cell-wall polymers. Although FT-IR spectra for the sbt3.5 mutants showed no overall drastic changes, a significant decrease (P < 0·01) in the absorbance for wavenumber 1785 cm–1 was observed in the sbt3.5 mutants (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Data Fig. S5). This wavenumber could correspond to a distinct pattern of methylester (for instance in the distribution of methylesters on the HG chain), as chemical environment surrounding methylesters in the cell wall could lead to a shift of absorbances. Although the changes observed between wild-type and mutant for this specific wavenumber were similar for pme17 and sbt3.5, the lack of strong differences in the absorbance for 1735–1712 cm–1 in sbt3.5 suggests potential compensatory effects within the SBT gene family. To assess if SBT3.5 can indeed process full-length PME17 and mediate the release of the PME domain into the apoplasm, transient co-expression experiments were performed in N. benthamiana, followed by apoplastic protein extraction and western blotting. For this, expression constructs for a C-terminally myc-tagged version of PME17 were agro-infiltrated in tobacco leaves with SBT3.5 (Fig. 6A) in the presence or absence of EPI1 and EPI10, SBT inhibitors belonging to the Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors (CITATION). Following apoplastic washes, equal amounts of extracted proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE (Fig. 6B), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-c-Myc antibodies (Fig. 6C). In the absence of SBT3.5, two bands in a molecular mass range of 35–38 kDa were detected in the apoplasm (Fig. 6C). This suggests that, even though a single RKLL sequence was identified, two processing motifs could be present in the PME17 amino acid sequence, both of which are cleaved by an endogenous tobacco subtilase/protease. An additional band at a molecular mass close to 61 kDa probably represents the non-processed form of PME17. The recovery of this non-processed form in apoplastic washes is likely to be explained by a slight contamination (5 %) with cytosolic content, as measured through an α-mannosidase enzymatic assay (Supplementary Data Table S4). When SBT3.5 was co-infiltrated with PME17, the larger band disappeared, suggesting that PME17 is cleaved by SBT3.5 at at least one of the two processing sites, probably the RKLL motif. An additional lower band was detected that could indicate the presence of N-terminal degradation products of PME17. In the presence of the SBT inhibitor EPI, no difference in the processing of PME17 was revealed. These results indicate that SBT3.5 is able to process PME17 and because both proteins are co-expressed in Arabidopsis roots where they are co-targeted to the secretory pathway and apoplasm, they support a role for SBT3.5 in the maturation and regulation of PME17 in vivo.

!~MM~! Homozygous pme17–1, pme17–2, sbt3.5–1 and sbt3.5–2 mutants were isolated from FLAG (INRA, Versailles, France), SALK (SIGnAL, USA), SAIL (Syngenta, Basel, Switzerland) and GABI (CeBiTec, Bielefeld, Germany) T-DNA insertion collections, using gene-specific forward and reverse primers and T-DNA left border specific primers (Supplementary Data Table S1). Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild-types, mutants and prom:GUS lines) from ecotypes Col-0 and Ws were grown on 0·5× MS solid media (Duchefa, Cat. No. M0221.0001) containing 1 % sucrose and 0·05 % MES monohydrate at pH 5·8. Seeds were treated for 3 d at 4 °C to synchronize germination, and placed in a phytotronic chamber (16-h photoperiod at 120 μmoL m–2 s–1 and 22 °C constant temperature) for in vitro seedling growth. Plants grown on soil were placed in a phytotronic chamber (16-h photoperiod at 100 μmoL m–2 s–1, 70 % relative humidity and 23 °C/19 °C day/night temperature). Transfer to the chamber is referred to as t = 0 for all experiments. Seedlings were harvested at 10 d for RNA and protein extractions and at various time points (1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 d) to determine the activity of the promoters. Various organs were harvested from adult plants for RNA extraction. For root length measurements, 90 seedlings were analysed using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and the NeuronJ plugin, for each of the three biological replicates, and data were statistically analysed using the parametric Student's test (Statistica v9.1, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). To determine the germination rate, non-sterilized seeds were sown on nutrient-free media, cold-treated for 3 d and transferred to the growth chamber as already mentioned for seedling growth. Germination was followed from 24 to 72 h. Data shown are the means with standard errors (SE) of four replicates, with 30 seeds per replicate. Statistical analyses were performed using a non-parametric Mann–Whitney test with the Statistica software (Statistica v9.1, StatSoft). In-vitro-grown seedlings (10-d-old roots and leaves) and organs from plants grown on soil [young and old leaves, stem, flowers buds, siliques from 3 to 8 and 9 to 17 d after fertilization (DAF) and mature seeds] were dissected and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg tissue, using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; Cat. No. 15596–026), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Genomic DNA was removed using Turbo DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA; Cat. No. AM1907), according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA synthesis was performed using 4 μg of RNA, 50 μm oligo (dT)20 and the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen; Cat. No. 18080–400), using manufacturer's protocol. Semi-quantitative and RT-qPCR analyses were performed on 1/20 diluted cDNA. For RT-qPCR, the LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA; Cat. No. 04887352001) was used in 384-well plates in the LightCycler® 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche). The CT values for each sample (crossing threshold values are the number of PCR cycles required for the accumulated fluorescence signal to cross a threshold above the background) were acquired with the LightCycler 480 software (Roche) using the second derivative maximum method. Primers used are shown in Supplementary Data Table S1 (see also Fig. 4A). Stably expressed reference genes (PEX4, CLA, TIP41, At4g26410 and APT1), selected using GeNorm software (CITATION), were used as internal controls to calculate relative expression of target genes, according to the method described by CITATION. 1·5 kb upstream of the AtPME17 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) were amplified from arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA using the Phusion® Taq polymerase (Finnzymes, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat. No. F-540L) and specific forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Data Table S1). The amplified fragment was recombined into pENTR™/D-TOPO® entry vector (Invitrogen; Cat. No. K2400–20) using attL1 and attL2 recombination sites. After sequencing, the promoter was recombined upstream of the GUS coding sequence into the destination vector pKGWFS7,1 (Gent, http://www.psb.ugent.be/), using LR clonase (Invitrogen; Cat. No. 11791–020), following the manufacturer's instructions. Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 was transformed by the plasmid and used for subsequent plant transformation. Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed by the floral dip method (CITATION). T1 transformants were selected on 50 μg mL–1 kanamycin and T2 plants were used for the experiments. The promoter region of AtSBT3.5, 1560 bp upstream of the start codon, was amplified by PCR from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA using specific primers (pSBT3.5-F and pSBT3.5-R, Supplementary Data Table S1) and cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen). After sequence confirmation, the promoter fragment was subcloned into the plant expression vector pGreen 0029 (CITATION) upstream of the coding sequence for a GUS–GFP fusion protein exploiting the NotI and BamHI restriction sites that were included in the PCR primers. The construct was co-transformed with the helper plasmid pSOUP into A. tumefaciens GV3101 and transformed into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants by floral dip (CITATION). T1 transformants were selected on BASTA and T2 plants were used for the experiments. GUS assays were performed as described previously (CITATION), with some modifications. Plant samples were harvested and immediately pre-fixed in ice-cold 80 % acetone over 20 min at –20 °C, then washed three times with distilled water. They were vacuum infiltrated twice for 10 min using GUS staining solution [100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH7 (Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4), 0·1 % Triton X100, 10 mm EDTA, 0·5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 0·5 mm potassium ferricyanide and 1 mg mL–1 X-gluc (Duchefa Biochimie, Haarlem, the Netherlands; Cat. No. X1405)) and incubated at 37 °C for different time periods, depending on GUS lines and developmental stages. Samples were destained in 70 % ethanol and images were acquired using a SteREO Discovery V20 stereo microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cell-wall-enriched proteins from 10-d-old roots were extracted from 50 mg frozen material using 50 mm sodium acetate and 1 m lithium chloride buffer at pH 5, for 1 h at 4 °C under shaking. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were filtered using an Amicon ultra centrifugal filter 0·5 mL/10 kDa (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; Cat. No. UFC5010BK) to remove salts. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (CITATION) using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; Cat. No. 500–0006). Equal amounts of proteins (wild-type and mutant) were resolved on SDS-PAGE using Mini-protean® TGXTM gels (Bio-Rad; gradient 4–20 %, Cat. No. 456–1094) at a constant voltage of 200 V for 45 min. Proteins were stained with Coomassie blue (Bio-Rad; Blue G250, Cat. No. 161–0787) and destained with distilled water. Each SDS–PAGE band was manually excised from the gels to be hydrolysed according to CITATION. All digested peptide mixtures were separated online using nanoLC and analysed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The experiments were performed on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system coupled with an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The peptide mixtures were injected onto a nano trap column (Acclaim C18, 100 μm i.d. × 2 cm length) with a flow rate of 5 μL min–1 and subsequently gradient eluted with at a flow rate of 300 nL min–1 from 2–25 % acetonitrile/0·1 % formic acid over 60 min, followed by second linear increase from 25 to 55 % over 20 min. Xcalibur 2·3 software was used for mass data acquisition. Full MS scans were acquired at high resolution (full width at half maximum, FWHM, 60 000) in an Orbitrap analyser [mass-to-charge ratio (m/z): 400–2000], while collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra were recorded in centroid mode with low resolution on the ten most intense ions in the linear ion trap. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive mode in a data-dependent mode to automatically switch between orbitrap-MS and linear trap MS/MS (MS2) as previously described (CITATION). CID spectra were recorded in centroid mode at low resolution on the ten most intense ions in the linear ion trap. For accurate mass measurements the lock mass option was enabled in both MS and MS/MS mode and the polydimethylcyclosiloxane (PCM) ions generated in the electrospray process from ambient air (17) [protonated (Si(CH3)2O))6; m/z = 445·120025] were used for internal recalibration in real time (CITATION). For protein database searches of MS/MS spectra, data were processed using ProteomeDiscoverer 1·3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Mascot 2·4 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA). Database searches were run against Swissprot from UniProtKB release 2011–09 non-indexed, on any taxonomy, for tryptic peptides with up to two miscleavages, and carbamidomethylation of cysteins (+57·022 uma) and methionin oxidation (+15·995 uma) variable modifications. Protein identifications were validated only if at least two different sequences (in doubly and/or triply charged state) were identified as first candidates in the protein. Mass accuracy tolerance was set to 10 p.p.m. in MS mode and to 0·8 Da in MS/MS mode. The level of confidence for peptide identifications was estimated using the Percolator node with decoy database searching. Strict FDR (false discovery rate) was set to 0·01, relaxed FDR was set to 0·05 and validation was based on the q-value. Total PME activity was measured on cell-wall-enriched protein extracts using citrus pectins (DM 85 %, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; Cat. No. P9561–2G) and the alcohol oxidase-coupled colorimetric assay adapted from CITATION. Data are the means with their SE of three technical and three independent biological replicates. Statistical differences were determined using a non-parametric Mann–Whitney test with the Statistica software (Statistica v9.1, StatSoft). PME isoforms were separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using a 0·5-mm-thick polyacrylamide gel containing a mixture of pharmalytes to form a pH 6–10·5 gradient. The gel was placed horizontally on a cooled plate and anode (25 mm aspartic acid and 25 mm glutamic acid) and cathode (2 m ethylenediamine, 25 mm arginine and 25 mm lysine) strips were positioned at the top and bottom ends of the gel. Pre-focusing was performed (3000 V max., 15 W max. and 15 mA constant, for 20 min) and equal total PME activities, as determined by the colorimetric assay, were loaded into each well. Focusing was realized with the following conditions: 3000 V max., 50 mA max. and 25 W constant for 50 min followed by 5 min at 30 W constant. After IEF, PME activities were visualized following incubation in 1 % citrus pectins (DM 85 %, Sigma; Cat. No. P9561–2G) and subsequent staining in 0·01 % ruthenium red (Sigma; Cat. No. R2751). Seven-day-old seedlings grown on a plate were collected and incubated in absolute ethanol for 1 week. The samples were subsequently incubated twice in 80 % ethanol for 5 min at 100 °C, twice in absolute acetone for 5 min at 100 °C and stored in water. Seedlings were squashed between two BaF2 windows and thoroughly rinsed in distilled water for 2 min. The samples were then dried on the window at 37 °C for 20 min. For each condition, 10–15 spectra were collected in the root hair area, where PME17 and SBT3.5 are strongly expressed, for individual seedlings, from three independent cultures (five seedlings from each culture), as described by CITATION. An area of 30 × 30 μm was selected for FT-IR microspectroscopy, using a Thermo-Nicolet Nexus iN 10 MX spectrometer equipped with a continuum microscope accessory (Thermo Scientific). Normalization of the data and the discriminant variable selection method were performed as described by CITATION. Various absorbance wavenumbers were assigned to cell-wall polymer bonds according to the literature (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The protein sequence of AtSBT3.5, without signal peptide (SP) and prodomain, was used for homology searches in the protein data bank (PDB). The best template suitable for the protein was selected using different servers: I-tasser (CITATION), Sparks-X (CITATION), 3D-Jury (CITATION), HH-Pred (CITATION) and FUGUE (CITATION). The model of AtSBT3.5 monomer was built using the tomato Solanum lycopersicon SBT, SlSBT3 (PDB code: 3I6S, CITATION) as a structural template. The tertiary structure was modelled using Modeller 9v11 (CITATION), based on the sequence alignment obtained from FUGUE (CITATION). To determine homodimer 3-D structure prediction, two protein sequences of AtSBT3.5 without SP and prodomain were fused and a model was built using SlSBT3 homodimer as template, using similar methods as for the monomer model. Structural models were visualized and labelled in PyMol software (CITATION). Potentially important amino acid residues were identified according to the literature (CITATION; CITATION). Root mean-square deviation (RMSD) values and template modelling (TM) score values were determined according to TM-align (CITATION). A TM-score >0·5 means the structures share the same fold. The coding sequence of AtPME17, without stop codon, was amplified from clone pda01681 (RIKEN, http://www.brc.riken.jp/lab/epd/catalog/cdnaclone.html), using Phusion®Taq polymerase and specific forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Data Table S1). The Gateway procedure was used for PME17, with the destination vector ImpGWB417 (CITATION, CITATION). The open reading frame of AtSBT3.5 was amplified by PCR from pUni51 clone (Clone U19516; Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, https://abrc.osu.edu) with specific primers (Table S1) and cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO-vector (Invitrogen). The sequence was verified and the fragment cloned into the EcoRI sites of pART7, between the CaMV-35S promoter and the terminator sequence. The expression cassette was then subcloned into pART27 (CITATION). N. benthamiana plants were grown for 6 weeks in the greenhouse (25 °C, 12 h photoperiod). For transient expression of PME17 and SBT3.5, they were infiltrated with suspensions of A. tumefaciens C58C1 harbouring the expression constructs (PME17–4 × myc in ImpGWB417 and SBT3.5 in pART27) and pART27 as the empty vector control. For enhanced protein expression, the bacteria were always co-infiltrated with another C58C1 strain containing the p19 silencing suppressor. For co-expression of PME17 and SBT3.5, the respective constructs were co-infiltrated at equal optical density, and for the expression of PME17 alone, the PME17 construct was co-infiltrated with bacteria containing the empty vector pART27. Five days after agro-infiltration, three leaves from 3–4 plants were pooled and vacuum-infiltrated with 50 mm Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7·0, containing 300 mm NaCl. Apoplastic washes were collected by centrifugation at 1000 g at 4 °C for 7 min. Apoplastic proteins were analysed by SDS–PAGE (CITATION) and western blot using monoclonal mouse anti-myc (9E10 hybridoma supernatant, 1:20; ATCC number CRL-1729) as the primary antibody, and horseradish-conjugated antimouse IgG (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA; 1:5000) as the secondary antibody. Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence on X-ray film. For total protein extraction, the leaf material was ground in 1·5 mL extraction buffer (0·5 m Na-acetate, pH 5·2, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 % activated charcoal) per gram fresh weight and the extract cleared by centrifuging (15 000 g, 4 °C, 2 min). To determine the degree of cytoplasmic contamination, α-mannosidase activity was assayed in apoplastic washes and total protein extracts. Ten microlitres of apoplastic and total protein extracts was incubated with 0·5 mg substrate (4-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside) in 0·1 m Na-acetate buffer, pH 5·2. After 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 10 % Na-carbonate and absorption was measured at 405 nm. α-Mannosidase activity was calculated as OD405 per gram fresh weight and the contamination of the apoplastic wash was estimated as percentage of the activity in total protein extracts.
