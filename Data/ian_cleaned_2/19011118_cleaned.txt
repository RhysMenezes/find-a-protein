!~ABS~! The floral regulators GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play key roles in the photoperiodic flowering responses of the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The GI-CO-FT pathway is highly conserved in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the circadian clock proteins LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK–ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) not only repressed the floral transition under short-day and long-day conditions but also accelerated flowering when the plants were grown under continuous light (LL). LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant repressors of flowering time. SVP protein accumulated in lhy;cca1 plants under LL. We propose a model in which LHY and CCA1 accelerate flowering in part by reducing the abundance of SVP and thereby antagonizing its capacity to repress FT expression under LL.
!~RES~! To investigate how the clock genes LHY and CCA1 affect the flowering response to photoperiod, we examined lhy;cca1 double mutants. The lhy-12;cca1-1 and lhy-11;cca1-1 double mutants exhibit early flowering and earlier circadian phase of expression of the flowering-time genes GI and CO under SD (10 h of light/14 h of dark) and LD (16 h of light/8 h of dark) (CITATION, CITATION). By contrast, we observed that lhy-12;cca1-101 plants flower later than wild-type plants under LL (Figures 1A to 1C , cca1-101; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). This indicates that LHY and CCA1 are required for the acceleration of flowering in wild-type plants under LL. In addition, the lhy-12;cca1-101 plants flowered earlier as the dark period was extended (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that the requirement for LHY and CCA1 to delay flowering in light was reduced as the duration of darkness was extended. This effect is in contrast to that observed with other Arabidopsis mutants affecting daylength responses, which exhibit either earlier flowering (elf3) (CITATION) or later flowering (gi and co) than wild-type plants (Figure 1B) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) but do not show a reversed response relative to the wild type dependent on the diurnal conditions. [[FIGURE]] We next analyzed the expression patterns of flowering-time genes in lhy-12;cca1-101 plants under LL. Consistent with the delayed-flowering phenotype, FT mRNA levels were markedly lower in lhy-12;cca1-101 mutants than in wild-type plants under LL (Figure 2A ; see Supplemental Figure 2D online). However, under these conditions, the mRNA level of GI, a gene that acts upstream of FT in the photoperiod pathway, was only slightly lower in lhy-12;cca1-101 than in wild-type plants (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figure 2A online). To test whether GI, the most upstream factor of the photoperiodic flowering pathway, is involved in the late flowering of lhy;cca1 plants under LL, we investigated a triple mutant, lhy-11;cca1-1;gi-3. The lhy-11;cca1-1;gi-3 plants flowered significantly later than lhy-11;cca1-1 and gi-3 under LL (Figure 2B). This indicated that LHY/CCA1 and GI encode components of independent genetic pathways that promote the flowering of wild-type plants under LL. These results suggested that the slight decrease of GI expression did not explain the late flowering of lhy-12;cca1-101 plants in LL. Under LL, the CO mRNA level in lhy;cca1 was lower than that in wild-type plants, suggesting that lhy;cca1 might affect CO expression (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figure 2B online). [[FIGURE]] We showed that FT mRNA was detectable in both the wild type and lhy-12;cca1-101 under LD (Figure 2C). Arabidopsis plants show rhythmic expression of clock-controlled genes under temperature cycles (CITATION). Under LL, a temperature cycle entrained both wild-type and lhy-12;cca1-101 plants (Figure 2D). Although high CO expression in wild-type and lhy-12;cca1-101 plants under these conditions coincided with exposure to light, FT expression was detected only in wild-type plants and not in lhy-12;cca1-101 plants (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 2G online). The lhy-12;cca1-101 double mutant flowered later than wild-type plants even under these conditions (Figure 2E). These results indicate that the late-flowering phenotype of lhy-12;cca1-101 under LL is not due simply to the slight decrease of GI or CO mRNA but, rather, to the direct suppression of FT transcription independently of GI or CO or to the negative regulation of CO protein activity (CITATION). To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the GI-independent late flowering of lhy;cca1 plants, we screened for ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)–induced mutations that caused earlier flowering of lhy;cca1 plants under LL. One of these suppressor mutations occurred in SVP, which encodes a MADS box transcription factor and is a previously described repressor of flowering (Figure 3C ) (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To map the svp-3 mutation, we crossed lhy-12;cca1-102;svp-3 with the Columbia (Col) wild type. F2 plants with fewer leaves than the wild types (Landsberg erecta [Ler] and Col) in LL were used for mapping. Rough mapping located svp-3 between the genetic markers nga1145 and nga1126 on chromosome 2. Fine mapping of svp-3 showed that the mutation is in a region between BACs F14M13 and T9I22. The interval between these two markers is ∼40 kb. To identify the molecular lesion in svp-3, we amplified and sequenced a set of PCR fragments covering the SVP region from lhy-12;cca1-102;svp-3. Genetic mapping and sequencing identified a single mutation (G to A) on the border of the first intron and the second exon of SVP (Figure 3C). This mutation, svp-3, appears to cause a missplicing of SVP mRNA (Figure 3D), possibly leading to a loss of functional SVP. These results indicate that SVP is required for late flowering of lhy-12;cca1-102 under LL; indeed, the lhy;cca1;svp triple mutant line showed an early-flowering phenotype similar to that of wild-type plants under LL (Figures 3A and 3B). The impact of the svp-3 mutation on the abundance of the mRNAs of the flowering genes FT and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1 (SOC1) was tested in lhy-12;cca1-102;svp-3 under LL (Figure 3E). Consistent with the flowering times under LL, the level of FT mRNA in lhy-12;cca1-102;svp-3 plants was higher than that in lhy-12;cca1-102 plants but lower than that in svp-3 LL (Figure 3E). By contrast, the expression of GI and CO, which act earlier in the photoperiod pathway than FT and SOC1, was not affected by svp-3 in the light period that is important for the determination of flowering (Figure 3E) (CITATION; CITATION). In addition, ft-1;soc1 mutations largely suppressed the early flowering of svp-3 (Figure 3F), whereas gi-3;svp-3 and co-2;svp-3 double mutants flowered earlier than co-2 and gi-3 single mutants (Figure 3G). These results suggest that increased levels of FT and SOC1 mRNA in lhy-12;cca1-102;svp-3 mutants may be responsible for the partial suppression of the late flowering of lhy-12;cca1-102 by svp-3 in LL and that repression of FT in lhy;cca1 plants under LL may cause the late-flowering phenotype under these conditions. We did not find a significant difference in SOC1 mRNA level between wild-type and lhy;cca1 plants under LL. FLC also encodes a MADS box protein that represses flowering (CITATION). We found that the flc mutation enhanced the early flowering of svp (Figure 4A ) and that SVP interacted with FLC in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 4B). These results suggested that these two proteins might have partially redundant roles in the repression of flowering. Furthermore, 35S:FLC plants exhibited phenotypes similar to those of lhy;cca1 in LL, such as late flowering (Figure 4C), negative regulation of FT expression (see Supplemental Figure 3F online), and dark-green/curled leaves (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). LHY and CCA1 mRNA levels were not affected by 35S:FLC in LL (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). In addition, lhy-11;cca1-1;flc-101 and lhy-11;cca1-1;flc-102 triple mutants were generated, and these triple mutants flowered earlier than lhy-11;cca1-1 (Col) in LL (Figure 4D). The flc mutation did not affect the flowering time of co (CITATION). The lhy-12;cca1-101 plants exhibited dark-green/curled leaves in LL (Figure 1A), but co did not (data not shown). Therefore, late flowering of lhy;cca1 in LL is unlikely to be explained solely by the downregulation of CO mRNA or protein levels. These results indicate that the delay in flowering caused by LHY and CCA1 under LL requires known floral repressors, such as SVP and FLC, as well as the classical GI-CO pathway for floral activation. [[FIGURE]] Although SVP is required for the late flowering of lhy;cca1 plants in LL (Figures 3A and 3B), lhy;cca1 did not affect the level of SVP mRNA in LL (Figure 5C ). The lhy;cca1 double mutant is sensitive to light (CITATION), and one possible explanation for the late-flowering phenotype of lhy;cca1 in LL is that light may increase SVP activity to delay flowering. In LL, the late-flowering phenotype of 35S:SVP was much stronger than that in LD (Figures 5D and 5E; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Consistent with the difference of flowering times, expression levels of FT and SOC1 in 35S:SVP plants under LL were lower than those under LD (see Supplemental Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D online). GI and CO expression was not affected by 35S:SVP (see Supplemental Figures 3A, 3B, and 3E online). [[FIGURE]] To understand the molecular mechanism for the delay of flowering time under LL, we used immunoblots to examine changes of SVP protein levels in lhy;cca1, SVP-ox, svp-31, and control plants under LL. We detected an accumulation of SVP protein in lhy;cca1 and SVP-ox (Figure 6A ) plants in LL. As controls, we found an increased level of SVP protein in SVP-ox plants, whereas no detectable level of SVP protein was found in svp-31 plants. This result is consistent with the delayed flowering of lhy;cca1 and can explain why the svp mutation suppressed the late-flowering phenotype of lhy;cca1 under LL. We detected two bands by protein gel blotting using the SVP-specific antibody (Figure 6A). Two types of cDNAs (NP179840 and ABU95407 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database) that correspond to different lengths of SVP proteins (240 and 235 amino acids) have been identified. Those probably generated by alternative splicing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=proteinandid=156778051) are likely to be responsible for the two bands. [[FIGURE]] The late-flowering phenotype of lhy;cca1 was observed under LL but not under LD and SD. To test whether the accumulation of SVP protein in lhy;cca1 was affected by light/dark cycles, the SVP protein abundance was examined under LD. Zeitgeber time (ZT) is shown as hours from dawn. Seedlings of wild-type plants were harvested at dawn (ZT 0) and then every 4 h for 24 h. SVP protein accumulation showed a diurnal change under LD (Figure 6B). The SVP protein abundance was at trough level at ZT 16, 20, and 24 in the wild type (Ler). Higher accumulation of SVP protein was detected at ZT 4, 8, and 12 in the wild type (Ler). The amplitude of the diurnal rhythm in SVP protein accumulation was reduced in lhy;cca1, and trough levels of SVP protein in lhy;cca1 were higher than those of the wild type (Ler). These results also indicate that both LHY and CCA1 play key roles in the control of SVP protein accumulation.
!~MM~! The wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana Ler ecotype was used unless specified otherwise. The lhy-11;cca1-1 (CITATION), lhy-11;cca1-1;gi-3, lhy-11;cca1-1;co-2, lhy-11;cca1-1;ft-1 (CITATION), co-2 (CS55), ft-1 (CS56), fca-1 (CS52) (CITATION), gi-3 (CS51; CITATION), lhy-21;cca1-11 (Wassilewskija; CS9380; Hall et al., 2003), and 35S:FLC (Ler; Michaels and Amasino, 1999) mutants have been described previously. T-DNA insertion alleles of SVP (svp-31, 1005231108; svp-32, 4123010) and FLC (flc-101, 4551274; flc-102, 1005389859) in the Col background were obtained from the ABRC. The 35S:SVP transgenic plants in Ler were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation of a construct containing the SVP cDNA linked to the 35S promoter from the pBI121 vector (CITATION). Plants were grown on soil (Jiffy Mix; Sakata) in controlled-environment rooms or in a plant incubator (CF-305; TOMY) at 24°C under LD (16 h of light /8 h of dark), SD (10 h of light/14 h of dark), or LL unless specified otherwise. For the temperature cycle analysis, plants were grown on soil in a plant incubator (CF-305; TOMY) under LL with the temperature cycle 16 h at 24°C/8 h at 20°C. Approximately 5000 lhy-12;cca1-101 (Ler) seeds were mutagenized by imbibition in 0.3% EMS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 9 h, followed by washing with 0.1 M Na2SO3 (twice) and distilled water for 30 min (five times). M2 seeds were collected in pools, with each pool containing ∼20 M1 plants. Approximately 13,000 M2 seeds representing ∼1300 M1 plants after mutagenesis of lhy-12;cca1-101 seeds were sown on soil and screened for the early-flowering mutants under LL. The enhancer mutations in the lhy-12 background were backcrossed to Ler wild-type plants twice before phenotypic analysis. Flowering time was measured by scoring the number of rosette and cauline leaves on the main stem. Data are presented as means ± se. Double and triple mutants were made by crossing lines homozygous for each mutation. F2 plants homozygous for one of the mutations were self-fertilized, and F3 families were identified in which phenotypes characteristic of the second mutation were visible. Protein extraction was performed as described previously (CITATION). SVP-specific antibodies were produced against synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid 218 to 233 region of SVP (STGAPVDSESSDTSLR). The synthesized peptides were conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier. Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits (Invitrogen). For immunoblot analysis, 30 μg of Arabidopsis leaf total protein was separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. After blocking for 1 h in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature, the membrane was incubated in the same buffer with the SVP antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature. After washing three times in TBST buffer, the blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham) and the complexes were made visible by ECL Plus protein gel blotting detection reagents (Amersham) following the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 20,000 lhy-12 seeds were mutagenized by imbibition in 0.3% EMS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 9 h, followed by washing with 0.1 M Na2SO3 (twice) and distilled water (five times). M2 seeds were collected in pools, with each pool containing ∼20 M1 plants. Approximately 50,000 M2 seeds representing ∼5000 M1 plants after mutagenesis of lhy-12 seeds were sown on soil and screened for early-flowering mutants under SD conditions (10 h of light/14 h of dark) in a greenhouse. RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde denaturing gels and transferred to Biodyne B membranes (Nippon Genetics). Hybridization was done in 0.3 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% BSA overnight at 65°C. The blot was washed with 0.2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. Full-length GI cDNA was used as a probe (CITATION). Images were visualized using a BioImaging Analyzer (BAS 5000; Fuji Photo Film); signal intensity was quantified with Science Lab 98 Image Gauge software (version 3.1; Fuji Photo Film). PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and transferred to Biodyne B membranes (Nippon Genetics). RT-PCR products were cloned by the pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega), and plasmids were extracted for PCR templates to amplify DNA fragments. The fragments were 32P-radiolabeled to be probes with specific activity to detect each gene. Membranes were hybridized with the radioactive probe DNAs in hybridization solution that contained 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sarkosyl, 0.75% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), and 5% dextran sulfate sodium salt at 65°C for 16 h. The blot was washed first with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min and then with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 65°C. The hybridization signal was visualized using a BioImaging Analyzer (BAS 5000; Fuji Photo Film); signal intensity was quantified with Science Lab 98 Image Gauge software (version 3.1; Fuji Photo Film). Sequence analysis for the results shown in Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 1 online was performed using the CEQTM DTCS-Quick Start kit (Beckman Coulter) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the yeast two-hybrid assay, each gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGBKT7 or pGADT7 vector (Clontech Laboratories) (CITATION). For interaction studies, plasmids containing fusion proteins were cointroduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 and grown on medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His in the presence of 0.5 and 1 mM 3-aminotriazole. pGBKT7-53, which encodes a fusion between the GAL4DNA-BD and murine p53, and pGADT7-T, which encodes a fusion between the GAL4AD and SV40 large T-antigen, were used as positive controls (53/T).
