!~ABS~! Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY38 and WRKY62, encoding two structurally similar type III WRKY transcription factors, are induced in a Nonexpressor of PR Gene1 (NPR1)–dependent manner by salicylic acid (SA) or by virulent Pseudomonas syringae. Disease resistance and SA-regulated Pathogenesis-Related1 (PR1) gene expression are enhanced in the wrky38 and wrky62 single mutants and, to a greater extent, in the double mutants. Overexpression of WRKY38 or WRKY62 reduces disease resistance and PR1 expression. Thus, WRKY38 and WRKY62 function additively as negative regulators of plant basal defense. WRKY38 and WRKY62 interact with Histone Deacetylase 19 (HDA19). Expression of HDA19 is also induced by P. syringae, and the stability of its induced transcripts depends on SA and NPR1 in infected plants. Disruption of HDA19 leads to compromised resistance, whereas its overexpression results in enhanced resistance to P. syringae. Thus, HDA19 has a role opposite from those of WRKY38 and WRKY62 in basal resistance to the bacterial pathogen. Both WRKY38 and WRKY62 are transcriptional activators in plant cells, but their activation activities are abolished by overexpressed HDA19. Interaction of WRKY38 and WRKY62 with HDA19 may act to fine-tune plant basal defense responses.
!~RES~! WRKY proteins can be classified into three groups (CITATION). The first group contains two Cys2His2 zinc-finger motifs, and the second group contains only one Cys2His2 zinc-finger motif. The third group of WRKY proteins contains a single Cys2HisCys motif. Based on this classification, WRKY38 and WRKY62 belong to group III WRKY proteins, each with a single Cys2HisCys motif (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). Besides the conserved WRKY domains, the two proteins share substantial levels of homology at their N termini, but the sequence similarity at their C termini is relatively low (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). WRKY transcription factors are thought to function by binding their cognate TTGACC/T W-box cis elements in the promoter regions of target genes and activating or repressing their expression (CITATION). A number of isolated WRKY proteins have been shown to bind W-box sequences (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To examine the DNA binding activity of WRKY38 and WRKY62, we expressed the genes in Escherichia coli, purified the recombinant protein, and assayed their binding to an oligonucleotide that contains a TTGACC W-box sequence (P12a; see Supplemental Figure 1B online) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A protein/DNA complex with reduced mobility was detected when purified recombinant WRKY38 or WRKY62 protein was incubated with the P12a probe (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). Binding of the WRKY proteins to a mutant probe (mP12a) in which the TTGACC sequence was changed to TTGAAC was not detectable (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). Thus, binding of WRKY38 and WRKY62 to the TTGACC W-box sequence is highly specific. To determine the subcellular location of WRKY38 and WRKY62, we constructed green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to the C termini of the two WRKY proteins. The fusion constructs, driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, were directly bombarded into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. The transiently expressed WRKY38-GFP and WRKY62-GFP fusion proteins were localized exclusively to the nucleus (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). By contrast, GFP was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). To analyze the involvement of WRKY38 and WRKY62 in plant basal defense, we analyzed their expression in response to the virulent P. syringae pv tomato strain DC3000 (PstDC3000). As shown in Figure 1A , WRKY38 and WRKY62 transcripts were undetectable in healthy uninfected plants or in plants infiltrated with 50 mM MgCl2 (mock inoculation). In plants infiltrated with PstDC3000, transcripts for WRKY38 or WRKY62 remained undetectable at 4 h after inoculation (HAI) but were elevated at 8 and 12 HAI before declining to almost basal levels by 24 HAI (Figure 1A). To determine the role of SA in pathogen-induced WRKY38 and WRKY62 expression, we compared their pathogen-induced expression in wild-type plants with those in the SA signaling–defective npr1-3 mutant and the sid2-3 mutant (SALK_133146), which contains a T-DNA insertion in the SID2 gene important for SA biosynthesis (CITATION; CITATION). As shown in Figure 1B, transcripts for both WRKY38 and WRKY62 were elevated at 8 and 12 HAI in pathogen-infected wild-type plants but not in the pathogen-infected sid2 and npr1 mutants. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the levels of WRKY38 and WRKY62 transcripts were elevated 8- to 10-fold at 8 and 12 HAI in wild-type plants but not in the sid2 and npr1 mutants (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Thus, induction of WRKY38 and WRKY62 by the virulent bacterial pathogen is dependent on SA and NPR1. [[FIGURE]] To further determine the involvement of SA in the induction of WRKY38 and WRKY62, we examined their expression in wild-type plants after spraying with water (control) or 1 mM SA. Expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 was induced by SA but not by water (Figure 1C). Unlike in pathogen-inoculated plants, transcripts for both WRKY38 and WRKY62 were elevated at 4 h after SA spraying, indicating that SA induces their expression more rapidly than PstDC3000 inoculation. The transcripts for the two WRKY genes remained highly expressed during the following 8 h after SA spraying before declining to near basal levels, as observed in pathogen-inoculated plants (Figure 1C). In the npr1-3 mutant, SA-induced expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 was completely abolished (Figure 1D). Thus, SA-induced expression of WRKY38 and WRKY62 is NPR1-dependent. The expression data suggest that WRKY38 and WRKY62 function downstream of NPR1 in SA-mediated defense signaling pathways. To analyze the role of WRKY38 and WRKY62 directly, we identified T-DNA insertion or transposon-tagged mutants for both WRKY38 and WRKY62. The wrky38-1 mutant (WiscDsLox489-492C21; Columbia [Col-0] ecotype) contains a T-DNA insertion in the second intron, while wrky38-2 (RATM11-6950-1_H; Nossen-0 [No-0] ecotype) contains a Ds transposon insertion in the last exon of the WRKY38 gene (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). The wrky62-1 (GABI_016H10; Col-0 ecotype) and wrky62-2 (RATM11-6212-1_G; No-0 ecotype) mutants contain a T-DNA and a Ds transposon insertion, respectively, in the second exon of the WRKY62 gene (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). Homozygous mutant plants were identified by PCR with WRKY38- or WRKY62-specific primers. RNA gel blot analysis failed to detect WRKY38 or WRKY62 transcripts of the expected sizes in the respective homozygous mutants after SA treatment (see Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C online). To determine possible functional redundancy, we also generated the wrky38-1 wrky62-1 (Col-0 ecotype) and wrky38-2 wrky62-2 (No-0 ecotype) double mutants through genetic crossing. The wrky38 and wrky62 single and double mutants showed no differences in growth, development, or morphology from wild-type plants. To determine possible changes of the mutants in plant basal disease resistance, we inoculated them with PstDC3000 and monitored both bacterial growth and disease symptom development. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B , the wrky38 and wrky62 single mutants had 2.5- to 4-fold reductions in the growth of the bacterial pathogen. The single mutants also developed significantly less severe disease symptoms than wild-type plants after infection (Figures 2C and 2D). A greater reduction (8- to 11-fold) of bacterial growth was observed in the wrky38 wrky62 double mutants relative to that in the wild-type plants (Figures 2A and 2B). The marked reduction in bacterial growth in the double mutants was accompanied by a substantially reduced development of disease symptoms (Figures 2C and 2D). These results suggest that WRKY38 and WRKY62 function additively with a negative role in basal resistance to the virulent bacterial pathogen. [[FIGURE]] To further examine the roles of WRKY38 and WRKY62, we overexpressed the WRKY genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Constructs containing a full-length WRKY38 or WRKY62 cDNA driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were transformed into Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype), and transgenic plants were identified by selection for antibiotic resistance. RNA gel blotting identified several transgenic plants that contained elevated levels of WRKY38 or WRKY62 transcripts even in the absence of SA treatment (see Supplemental Figures 3D and 3E online). Two transgenic lines that constitutively expressed WRKY38 or WRKY62 at elevated levels and contained a single T-DNA locus in their genomes, based on the ratio of antibiotic resistance phenotypes in progeny, were chosen for further study. Constitutive overexpression of a number of Arabidopsis WRKY genes, such as WRKY7 and WRKY18, resulted in reduced growth, altered flowering time, and changed leaf morphology (CITATION; CITATION). Analysis of F3 homozygous plants from WRKY38- or WRKY62-overexpressing transgenic plants revealed no differences in growth, development, or morphology from wild-type plants. Following inoculation with PstDC3000, the transgenic WRKY38 and WRKY62 overexpression lines displayed greater bacterial growth (∼4- to 6-fold) than wild-type plants (Figure 3A ). The inoculated leaves of WRKY38- and WRKY62-overexpressing plants also developed more severe disease symptoms than those of wild-type plants after infection (Figure 3B). For comparison, the npr1-3 mutant had ∼10-fold higher bacterial growth than wild-type plants and developed even more severe disease symptoms than the WRKY38- or WRKY62-overexpressing plants (Figures 3A and 3B). These results support the hypothesis that WRKY38 and WRKY62 have negative roles in basal resistance to the bacterial pathogen. [[FIGURE]] SA plays an important role in Arabidopsis resistance to PstDC3000 (CITATION). To investigate how WRKY38 and WRKY62 repress plant basal resistance to PstDC3000, we examined SA-regulated PR1 expression in both the knockout mutants and overexpression lines following infection of the bacterial pathogen. After PstDC3000 infection, there were higher levels of PR1 transcripts at 1, 2, and 3 d after inoculation (DAI) in the wrky38 and wrky62 mutants than in the wild-type plants. In addition, the wrky38-1 wrky62-1 double mutant (in Col-0 ecotype) had higher levels of PR1 transcripts than the wrky38-1 and wrky62-2 single mutants in three of the four independent experiments performed, while the wrky38-2 wrky62-2 double mutant (in No-0 ecotype) had higher levels of PR1 transcripts than the wrky38-2 and wrky62-2 single mutants in all four experiments (Figures 2E and 2F). By contrast, WRKY38- and WRKY62-overexpressing lines expressed lower levels of PR1 than wild-type plants after PstDC3000 infection (Figure 3C). Thus, altered resistance to PstDC3000 is correlated with altered expression of SA-regulated PR1 genes in the mutants and overexpression lines for WRKY38 and WRKY62. To further investigate the role of WRKY38 and WRKY62 in SA-regulated defense gene expression, we examined the sensitivity of the mutants and overexpression lines to SA for PR1 expression. The mutant and overexpression plants were sprayed with various concentrations of SA and examined for PR1 expression 24 h later. As shown in Figure 4 , the wrky38-1 and wrky62-1 single mutants had slightly higher levels of PR1 transcripts than wild-type plants, particularly after treatment with relatively higher concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 mM) of SA. The wrky38-1 wrky62-1 double mutant had substantially higher levels of PR1 transcripts than wild-type plants at all of the SA concentrations tested (Figure 4). By contrast, the WRKY38- and WRKY62-overexpressing lines accumulated lower levels of PR1 transcripts than wild-type plants after treatment of different concentrations of SA (Figure 4). Thus, WRKY38 and WRKY63 negatively regulate plant responsiveness to SA for PR1 expression. [[FIGURE]] To study how WRKY38 and WRKY62 repress plant basal defense, we next attempted to isolate their interacting proteins. The commonly used Gal4 two-hybrid system based on interaction-dependent transcriptional activation of reporter genes, however, is not useful because both WRKY38 and WRKY62 act as transcriptional activators in yeast cells (data not shown). Therefore, we used the yeast CytoTrap system based on interaction-dependent activation of the Ras signaling pathway and cell growth in a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant (CITATION). The yeast mutant contains a temperature-sensitive mutation in the cdc25 gene encoding a guanyl nucleotide-exchange factor, which binds and activates Ras. In these screens, we used a fusion protein of WRKY62 with the human homolog of yeast cdc25, hSOS, as bait. The temperature-sensitive yeast strain transformed with the bait construct failed to grow at the restrictive temperature (37°C). We screened >107 independent transformants of a cDNA prey library generated from SA-treated Arabidopsis plants. The screens yielded one group of cDNAs that all encoded HDA19 (CITATION; CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). We subsequently tested their interactions in plant cells using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in Agrobacterium tumefaciens–infiltrated tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves (CITATION). WRKY62 was fused to the N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fragment and HDA19 was fused to the C-terminal YFP fragment. When WRKY62-N-YFP was coexpressed with HDA19-C-YFP, a strong BiFC signal was observed predominantly in the nuclear compartment, based on staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Figure 5 ). Since WRKY38 is structurally and functionally related to WRKY62, we also examined its interaction with HDA19 in plant cells using the BiFC assay. Indeed, when WRKY38 was fused to the terminal YFP fragment and coexpressed with HDA19-C-YFP in tobacco leaves, a BiFC signal was also observed predominantly in the nuclear compartment (Figure 5). Control experiments in which WRKY38-N-YFP or WRKY62-N-YFP was coexpressed with unfused C-YFP protein or unfused N-YFP was coexpressed with HDA19-C-YFP did not show any fluorescence (Figure 5). These experiments provide strong evidence that both WRKY38 and WRKY62 form complexes with HDA19 in the nuclear compartment of plant cells. Interactions of WRKY38 and WRKY62 with HDA19 in the nucleus are consistent with the subcellular localization of WRKY38, WRKY62, and HDA19 in the nuclear compartment (see Supplemental Figure 1C online) (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To determine the specificity of interactions, we analyzed interactions of three other WRKY proteins with HDA19 by BiFC. We fused WRKY48 (a group II WRKY protein) and WRKY70 (a group III WRKY protein) to the N-terminal YFP fragment but found no BiFC signal when the two constructs were coexpressed with HDA19-C-YFP in tobacco leaves (data not shown). We also fused WRKY18 to the N-terminal YFP fragment, coexpressed it with HDA19-C-YFP in tobacco leaves, and again found no BiFC signal (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). We have previously shown that WRKY18 interacts with WRKY40 based on both yeast two-hybrid assays and in vivo immunoprecipitation (CITATION). Indeed, when WRKY40 was fused to the C-terminal YFP fragment and coexpressed with WRKY18-N-YFP in tobacco leaves, a strong BiFC signal was observed predominantly in the nuclear compartment (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). To further analyze their interactions in plant cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation with MYC-HDA19 and FLAG-WRKY38 or FLAG-WRKY62 transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. The protein complexes immunoprecipitated by the anti-MYC antibody from protein extracts of leaves coexpressing MYC-HDA19 and FLAG-WRKY38 or MYC-HDA19 and FLAG-WRKY62 generated positive interactions to the anti-FLAG antisera (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). By contrast, the immunoprecipitation from protein extracts of leaves expressing MYC-HDA19 and FLAG-WRKY18 produced no cross-reactivity to the antisera (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). As a first step to characterize the role of HDA19 in plant resistance to PstDC3000, we analyzed its expression in wild-type plants after infection of the bacterial pathogen. The HDA19 transcript levels were very low before inoculation and at 12 HAI (Figure 6A ). However, HDA19 transcripts were readily detected by RNA gel blot analysis in pathogen-inoculated plants at 24 HAI and continued to increase gradually during the next 24 h. No significant induction of HDA19 was observed in plants infiltrated with MgCl2 (Figure 6A). Thus, expression of HDA19 is induced by PstDC3000. In addition, transcripts for HDA19 were elevated in SA- or methyl jasmonate (MeJA)–treated plants (Figure 6B), although the induction was delayed when compared with those of WRKY38 and WRKY62 in SA-treated plants (Figure 1A). Pathogen-, SA-, and MeJA-induced expression of HDA19 was also detected by quantitative RT-PCR (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). [[FIGURE]] To analyze the signaling pathways that lead to HDA19 expression, we examined pathogen-induced changes of HDA19 transcript levels in mutants defective in SA, JA, or ET signaling. In the sid2-3 and npr1-3 mutants, defective in SA biosynthesis and signaling, respectively, expression of HDA19 was still induced, based on increased levels of HDA19 transcripts (Figure 6C). Interestingly, the induced HDA19 transcripts were reduced in size, most likely due to increased degradation, although the possibility of alternative degradation cannot be completely ruled out (Figure 6C). In the coi1-1 and ein2-1 mutants, there were slightly higher basal levels of HDA19 transcripts than in wild-type plants in two of the three experiments performed (Figure 6C). After pathogen infection of the mutants, HDA19 transcripts were also elevated, and the accumulated transcripts appeared to be intact as in the wild-type plants (Figure 6C). Thus, the stability of HDA19 transcripts accumulated in pathogen-infected plants appears to be dependent on SA signaling. To determine its role in plant basal disease resistance, we identified two T-DNA insertion mutants for HDA19 (hda19-3 and hda19-4) that both contain a T-DNA insertion in the first exon of the gene (see Supplemental Figure 7A online). We inoculated the hda19 knockout mutant plants with PstDC3000 and monitored both bacterial growth and disease symptom development. As shown in Figure 7A , the hda19 mutants had an approximately fivefold increase in the growth of the bacterial pathogen. The mutants also developed more severe disease symptoms than wild-type plants after the infection (Figure 7C). Thus, unlike WRKY38 and WRKY62, HDA19 functions as a positive regulator in basal resistance to PstDC3000. [[FIGURE]] To further examine the roles of HDA19, we overexpressed the gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. A construct containing a full-length HDA19 cDNA driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was transformed into Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype), and transgenic plants were identified by selection for antibiotic resistance. RNA gel blotting identified transgenic plants that contained elevated levels of HDA19 transcript even in the absence of pathogen infection (see Supplemental Figure 7B online). Those F1 lines with high levels of HAD19 transcripts (lines 1, 8, and particularly 9) showed significantly abnormal leaves, as observed previously (CITATION). Two representative transgenic lines that constitutively expressed HDA19 at elevated levels and contained a single T-DNA locus in their genomes, based on the ratio of antibiotic resistance phenotypes in progeny, were chosen for further study. Analysis of F3 homozygous plants from the two HDA19-overexpressing transgenic lines revealed little differences in growth, development, or morphology from wild-type plants. Following inoculation with PstDC3000, the transgenic HDA19 overexpression lines displayed substantially less bacterial growth (approximately fourfold to fivefold) than wild-type plants (Figure 7B). The inoculated leaves of HDA19-overexpressing plants also developed less severe disease symptoms than those of wild-type plants after infection (Figure 7D). These results support the notion that HDA19 has a positive role in basal resistance to the bacterial pathogen. To investigate the molecular basis for the altered plant basal resistance against PstDC3000, we analyzed PR1 expression in the hda19-3 mutant and HDA19-overexpressing transgenic plants after infection with the bacterial pathogen. After PstDC3000 inoculation, the levels of PR1 transcripts were reduced in the hda19 mutant relative to those in the wild-type plants (Figure 7E). On the other hand, the levels of PR1 transcripts in the HDA19-overexpressing plants were higher than those in wild-type plants, particularly at later stages of infection (i.e., at 48 and 72 HAI) (Figure 7F). These results suggest that HDA19 is a positive regulator of SA-regulated PR1 gene expression. Histone deacetylases catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histone tails and often repress the transcription of genes by reducing the access of DNA by transcription factors (CITATION). Since HDA19 has a role in plant basal defense opposite to those of WRKY38 and WRKY62, it is possible that HDA19, through physical interaction, can reduce the transcriptional regulatory activity of the two transcription factors in plant cells. To test this possibility, we analyzed the transcriptional activation or repression activity of WRKY38 and WRKY62 using a transgenic system previously used for the analysis of WRKY7 (CITATION). In this system, the transcriptional regulatory activity of a protein is determined through assays of a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in stably transformed plants. The GUS reporter gene is driven by a synthetic promoter consisting of the −100 minimal CaMV 35S promoter and eight copies of the LexA operator sequence (see Supplemental Figure 8A online). Due to the minimal 35S promoter used, these transgenic plants constitutively expressed low levels of the GUS reporter gene, thereby making them suitable for assays of transcription activation or repression by determining increases or decreases in GUS activities following coexpression of an effector protein. To generate the WRKY38 and WRKY62 effectors, we fused their coding sequences with that of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of LexA. The fusion construct was subcloned behind the steroid-inducible Gal4 promoter in pTA7002 (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 8A online) and transformed into transgenic plants that already contain the GUS reporter construct. Unfused WRKY38, WRKY62, and LexA DBD genes were also subcloned into pTA7002 and transformed into transgenic GUS reporter plants as controls (see Supplemental Figure 8A online). Transgenic plants containing both the reporter and an effector construct were identified through antibiotic resistance screens. To determine how the effectors influence GUS reporter gene expression, we determined the changes of GUS activity in these transgenic plants following induction of the effector gene expression by spraying 20 μM dexamethasone (DEX), a steroid. In the transgenic plants that expressed the unfused WRKY38, WRKY62, or LexA DBD effector gene, the ratios of GUS activities measured before DEX treatment to those measured after DEX treatment were close to 1 (see Supplemental Figure 8B online). These results indicated that induced expression of WRKY38, WRKY62, or LexA DBD alone had no significant effect on expression of the GUS reporter gene. In the transgenic plants harboring the LexA DBD-WRKY38 or LexA DBD-WRKY62 effector gene, induction of the fusion effector after DEX treatment resulted in an approximately fourfold to sixfold increase in GUS activity (see Supplemental Figure 8B online). These results indicate that WRKY38 and WRKY62 are transcriptional activators in plant cells. To determine how HDA19 affects the transcriptional activation activity of WRKY38 and WRKY62, we crossed the transgenic 35S:HDA19-L1 line with transgenic plants harboring both the GUS reporter and an effector gene. A transgenic line harboring an empty vector was also crossed with the transgenic reporter/effector double transformants as controls. As shown in Figure 8 , in the progeny plants from the control cross with no constitutive HDA19 overexpression, induced expression of the fused LexA-WRKY38 or LexA-WRKY62 effector gene after DEX treatment resulted in 3.5- to 6-fold induction in GUS activity, which was similar to that observed in their respective parental reporter/effector lines (see Supplemental Figure 8B online). On the other hand, in the progeny plants that constitutively overexpressed HDA19, induced expression of the fused LexA-WRKY38 or LexA-WRKY62 effector after DEX treatment resulted in no significant change in GUS activity (Figure 8). Thus, overexpressed HDA19 effectively abolished the transcriptional activation activity of WRKY38 and WRKY62. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the histone deacetylase activity of overexpressed HDA19 is required to abolish the transcription activation activity of WRKY38 and WRKY62, we generated a mutant HDA19 (HDA19m) with Ala substitutions for His-148 and His-149, two evolutionarily invariant His residues located in a highly conserved motif of RPD3-type histone deacetylases, to which HDA19 belongs (see Supplemental Figure 9 online) (CITATION; CITATION). Ala substitutions for the two conserved His residues in RPD3-type histone deacetylases such as yeast RPD3 and Hos2 abolish their catalytic activity (CITATION; CITATION). When overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, HDA19m was unable to alter plant growth or disease resistance (data not shown). However, HDA19m interacted with WRKY38 and WRKY62 based on BiFC (see Supplemental Figure 5 online) and coimmunoprecipitation assays (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). A transgenic 35S:HDA19m line with the levels of HDA19m transcripts similar to those in the transgenic 35S:HDA19-L1 line was identified by RNA gel blotting and crossed with transgenic plants harboring both the GUS reporter and an effector gene. As shown in Figure 8, in the progeny plants that constitutively overexpressed HDA19m, induced expression of the fused LexA-WRKY38 or LexA-WRKY62 effector after DEX treatment resulted in 3.5- to 5-fold induction in GUS activity, which was similar to that observed in their respective parental lines (Figure 8). Thus, overexpressed HDA19m did not abolish the transcription activation activity of WRKY38 and WRKY62. To determine whether the ability of overexpressed HDA19 to abolish the transcription activation activity of a transcription factor is correlated with physical interaction, we examined the effect of overexpressed HDA19 on the transcription activation or repression activity of WRKY18 and WRKY48, which do not interact with HDA19 based on BiFC (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). However, induced expression of the LexA DBD-WRKY18 effector gene had no significant effect on the GUS activity of the transgenic reporter/effector plants, indicating that WRKY18 has little transcription activation or repression activity in plant cells (data not shown). On the other hand, in the transgenic plants harboring the LexA DBD-WRKY48 effector gene, induction of the fusion effector after DEX treatment resulted in an ∼20-fold increase in GUS activity (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). This result indicated that WRKY48 is a strong transcription activator. The transgenic plants harboring both the GUS reporter and the LexA DBD-WRKY48 effector gene was then crossed with the transgenic 35S:HDA19-L1 line. In the progeny plants that constitutively overexpressed HDA19, induced expression of the fused LexA-WRKY48 after DEX treatment resulted in an ∼20-fold induction in GUS activity, which was similar to that observed in the progeny derived from a cross with a control line transformed with an empty vector (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Thus, overexpressed HDA19 did not significantly affect the transcription activation activity of WRKY48. To analyze the functional interaction of the SA-regulated WRKY genes with HDA19 in plant disease resistance, we examined the effects of overexpression of WRKY62 on plant responses to PstDC3000 in both the wild-type and hda19 mutant backgrounds. The transgenic 35S:WRKY62-L1 line was crossed with the hda19-3 mutant, and the hda19-3/35S:WRKY62 plants in the F2 generation were identified by PCR and RNA gel blotting and compared with wild-type, hda19-3 mutant, and 35S:WRKY62-L1 plants for responses to PstDC3000. Following inoculation with the virulent bacterial pathogen, overexpression of WRKY62 in the wild-type background (35S:WRKY62-L1) caused an approximately fivefold increase in bacterial growth (Figure 9A ). Overexpression of WRKY62 in the hda19-3 mutant background (hda19-3/35S:WRKY62-L1), on the other hand, led to an ∼15-fold increase in bacterial growth (Figure 9A). The inoculated leaves of the hda19-3/35S:WRKY62-L1 plants also developed more severe disease symptoms than those of hda19-3 and 35S:WRKY62-L1 plants after infection (Figure 9B). These results support the functional interaction of WRKY62 with HDA19 in plant disease resistance. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, mutant, and transgenic plants used in the study were all grown in growth chambers at 22°C and 120 μE·m−2·s−1 light on a 12-h-light/12-h-dark photoperiod. To generate the WRKY38 and WRKY62 recombinant proteins, their full-length cDNAs were cloned into pET32a (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Induction of expression and purification of recombinant His-tagged proteins were performed according to the protocol provided by Novagen. The purified proteins were dialyzed overnight against a nuclear extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 30 μg/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4°C. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were labeled to specific activities of ∼105 cpm/ng using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. DNA and protein complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 30 min and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA at 4°C. The WRKY38 and WRKY62 cDNAs were amplified and fused with the GFP gene in-frame in a pBluescript II SK vector. The empty GFP plasmid was used as a control. The plasmid was isolated using Qiagen kits, concentrated to ∼1 μg/μL, and used to coat the gold particles for bombardment experiments. Transient expression of the GFP fusion genes in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells through particle bombardment and subsequent localization of the proteins were performed as described previously (CITATION). For RNA gel blot analysis, total RNA (5 μg) was separated on agarose–formaldehyde gels and blotted to nylon membranes. Blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled gene-specific probes. Hybridization was performed in PerfectHyb plus hybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 68°C. The membrane was then washed for 10 min twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) and 1% SDS and for 10 min with 0.1× SSC and 1% SDS at 68°C. The probes used in RNA gel blotting were as follows: WRKY38, an ∼450-nucleotide 3′ fragment obtained by XbaI/XhoI digestion of a full-length cDNA clone isolated from a cDNA library (in ZAP Express λ vector from Stratagene) prepared from Arabidopsis plants harvested 4 h after spraying with 2 mM SA (CITATION); WRKY62, an ∼400-nucleotide 3′ fragment obtained by HindIII/XhoI digestion of a full-length cDNA clone; HDA19, a 747-nucleotide internal HindIII fragment from its full-length cDNA clone; and PR1, a 410-nucleotide PCR fragment amplified from the Arabidopsis genomic DNA using two PR1-specific primers (5′-TTCTTCCCTCGAAAGCTCAA-3′ and 5′-CGTTCACATAATTCCCACGA-3′). Total RNA was isolated from treated leaves and treated with DNA-free (Ambion) to remove contaminated genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Diluted first-strand cDNA was used as template, and real-time PCR was conducted with both ubiquitin primers (5′-GAAGGCGAAGATCCAAGACAAG-3′ and 5′-TCCCGGCGAAAATCAATC-3′) and gene-specific primers (WRKY38, 5′-CGCCATGCGGTTGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-TAACTTGAAAGCGGTCCACCAT-3′; WRKY62, 5′-CCAACCAGCTGCTCATCATG-3′ and 5′-GGCCAAATCCTCCCTTTCC-3′; HDA19, 5′-GACTGTGATTACAACACACCGT-3′ and 5′-AATTGCCGCCAGTATCCAT-3′). The PCR was set up using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and run on the ABI Prism 7000 system. The relative specific mRNA abundance was calculated using ubiquitin as an internal control. The wrky38-1 (WiscDsLox489-492C21; in Col-0 ecotype) and wrky38-2 (RATM11-6950-1_H; in No-0 ecotype) mutants each contain a Ds transposon in the second intron and the third exon of the WRKY38 gene, respectively. Homozygous wrky38 mutant plants were identified by PCR using a pair of primers corresponding to sequences flanking the Ds tagging sites (pW38F, 5′-ATGAACTCCCCACACGAAAAG-3′; pW38R, 5′-AAAGTAAAACTGATCATAACGATCCCA-3′). The wrky62-1 (GABI_016H10; in Col-0 ecotype) and wrky62-2 (RATM11-6212-1_G; in No-0 ecotype) mutants each contain a T-DNA insertion and a Ds transposon in the second exon of WRKY62. Homozygous wrky62 mutant plants were identified by PCR using a pair of primers corresponding to sequences flanking the insertion sites (pW62F, 5′-ATGAACTCTTGCCAACAAAAGGCT-3′; pW62R, 5′-TGATGATAAGTCGTGAGATGTCCA-3′). The hda19-3 (SALK_139445) and hda19-4 (SALK_139443) mutants each contain a T-DNA insertion in the first exon of the HDA19 gene. Plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR using a pair of primers corresponding to sequence flanking the T-DNA insertion site (pHDA19F, 5′-CGCTCACTACGGTCTCCTTC-3′; pHDA19R, 5′-TAAAGAACACGCTGCAAACG-3′). The sid2-3 mutant (SALK_042603) contains a T-DNA insertion in the fourth intron of the SID2 gene. Homozygous sid2-3 mutant plants were identified by PCR using a pair of primers flanking the insertion site (pSID2F, 5′-TAGTTAGTGTGGCCATGCTAAG-3′; pSID2R, 5′-CCTAATTCCACGAGCCAAAA-3′). An EcoRI/HindIII fragment that contains the CaMV 35S promoter with double enhancers, multiple cloning sites, and 35S terminator was excised from pFF19 and cloned into the same sites of the transformation vector pOCA28 to generate pOCA30 (CITATION). To generate the 35S:WRKY38 construct, the cDNA fragment that contains the full coding sequence and 3′ untranslated region of WRKY38 was excised with SacI and KpnI from a cloning plasmid and subcloned into the same restriction sites of pOCA30 in the sense orientation behind the 35S promoter. The 35S:WRKY62 construct was generated in a similar way by subcloning the full-length cDNA for WRKY62 into the SmaI and XbaI sites of pOCA30. To generate the 35S:HDA19 construct, the cDNA fragment that contains the full coding sequence and 3′ untranslated region of HDA19 was excised with SpeI and XhoI from a cloning plasmid and subcloned into the XbaI and SalI sites of pOCA30 in the sense orientation behind the 35S promoter. HDA19m with Ala substitutions for the catalytic His-148 and His-149 residues was generated by overlapping PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Briefly, two pairs of primers (pA408, 5′-ATCGAGCTCGTCGACGTAATGGATACTGGCGGCAA-3′/pA409, 5′-TCGCACTTCTTAGCGGCAGCGAGACCACCA-3′ and pA410, 5′-TGGTGGTCTCGCTGCCGCTAAGAAGTGCGA-3′/pA411, 5′-AGCATAAAATGCCTCCTCCA-3′) were first used to amplify two DNA fragments from the full-length HDA19 cDNA clone. The amplified two fragments were then used as templates for overlapping PCR using pA408 and pA411 as primers to amplify a DNA fragment of ∼530 bp corresponding to the 5′ region of the HDA19 coding sequence with introduced mutations. The fragment was digested with SacI and used to replace the corresponding wild-type SacI fragment of the full-length HDA19 cDNA clone. Arabidopsis transformation was performed by the floral dip procedure (CITATION). The seeds were collected from the infiltrated plants and selected in Murashige and Skoog medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Kanamycin-resistant plants were transferred to soil 9 d later and grown in a growth chamber for further analysis. Pathogen inoculations were performed by infiltration of leaves of at least six plants for each treatment with the Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 strain (OD600 = 0.0001 in 10 mM MgCl2). Inoculated leaves were harvested 3 d after infiltration and homogenized in 10 mM MgCl2. Diluted leaf extracts were plated on King's B medium supplemented with rifampicin (100 μg/mL) and kanamycin (25 μg/mL) and incubated at 25°C for 2 d before counting the colony-forming units. WRKY62-interacting proteins were identified using the CytoTrap two-hybrid system as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The Arabidopsis pMyr two-hybrid cDNA library was prepared from Arabidopsis plants harvested 4 h after spraying with 2 mM SA. The WRKY62 cDNA was inserted into the pSOS plasmid to generate bait plasmids. The pMyr cDNA library and the corresponding bait plasmid were used to transform yeast strain cdc25H. Yeast transformants were plated onto the synthetic glucose minimal medium lacking uracil and Leu [SD/glucose(−UL)]. After growth at 25°C for 2 to 4 d, the colonies were replica-plated on the SD/galactose(−UL) plates and kept at 37°C. Those positive clones that grew on the SD/galactose(−UL) plates but not on the SD/glucose(−UL) plates were saved and analyzed further. Plasmid DNA was recovered from positive yeast colonies, transformed into E. coli strain DH5α, and isolated for DNA sequencing. DNA sequences for the N-terminal 173–amino acid EYFP (N-YFP) and C-terminal 64–amino acid (C-YFP) fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned into the plant expression vectors pOCA30 (CITATION) and pFGC5941 to generate pOCA-N-YFP and pFGC-C-YFP, respectively. The WRKY18, WRKY38, WRKY62, WRKY48, and WRKY70 coding sequences were inserted into pOCA-N-YFP to generate the N-terminal in-frame fusions with N-YFP, whereas HDA19 and WRKY40 were introduced into pFGC-C-YFP to form C-terminal in-frame fusions with C-YFP. The resulting clones were verified through sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101), and infiltration of tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) was performed as described previously (CITATION). Infected tissues were analyzed at 16 to 24 h after infiltration. Fluorescence and DAPI staining were visualized by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system. To generate the FLAG- or MYC-tagged proteins, cDNA fragments for WRKY38, WRKY62, and HDA19 were generated by PCR amplification and subsequently subcloned into a tagging plasmid behind the FLAG or MYC tag sequence as described previously (CITATION). The tagged genes were subcloned into the plant transformation vector pOCA30, introduced into A. tumefaciens (strain GV3101), and infiltrated into tobacco as described previously (CITATION). Preparation of protein extracts, immunoprecipitation, and detection of interacting proteins with protein gel blot analysis were performed as described previously (CITATION). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing a GUS reporter gene driven by a synthetic promoter consisting of the −100 minimal CaMV 35S promoter and eight copies of the LexA operator sequence were described previously (CITATION). To generate effector genes, the DNA fragment for the LexA DBD was digested from the plasmid pEG202 (Clontech) using HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites in pBluescript. The full-length WRKY18, WRKY38, WRKY48, and WRKY62 cDNA fragments were subsequently subcloned behind the LexA DBD to generate translational fusions. The LexA DBD-WRKY fusion genes were cloned into the XhoI and SpeI sites of pTA2002 behind the steroid-inducible promoter (CITATION). As controls, the unfused LexA DBD, WRKY38, and WRKY62 genes were also cloned into the same sites of pTA7002. These effector constructs were directly transformed into the transgenic GUS reporter plants, and double transformants were identified through screening for antibiotic (hygromycin) resistance. Determination of the activation or repression of GUS reporter gene expression by the effector proteins was performed as described previously (CITATION).
