!~ABS~! Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is triggered by hormone defense cues and is associated with the onset of expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes that encode for anti-microbial proteins in plants. In the case of PR-1, transcriptional activation involves promoter-specific recruitment of transcription factors such as TGA2 through a mechanism that may involve transient physical interaction with the NPR1 protein. This stimulus-inducible recruitment process has yet to be fully explained at the functional and mechanistic level. To investigate this question further, we initially looked to see whether NPR1 preferentially forms a complex with the DNA bound or unbound fraction of TGA2. As shown here, NPR1 appears to preferentially interact with the non-DNA bound fraction of TGA2. We subsequently mutated this transcription factor to identify key residues in its conserved carboxyl terminal (CT) domain that mediate complex formation with NPR1. These approaches revealed that two non-overlapping regions of the CT domain of TGA2 bind independently to NPR1. The specificity and biological significance of these findings were inferred with a mutant form of NPR1 that fails to activate SAR in vivo. These and other findings raise the possibility that NPR1 may transiently interact with the DNA unbound fraction of TGA2 to promote its recruitment to an active form on cognate target promoters.
!~RES~! While it has been shown that NPR1 affects recruitment of TGA transcription factors to promoter DNA, the mechanism by which this activity occurs is largely unknown. Because NPR1 in vitro does not form a stable association with TGA transcription factors on DNA (23; our unpublished data), we surmise that it may instead affect promoter recruitment of these DNA-binding factors. We were thus initially interested to see whether NPR1 has a preference for interacting with the DNA unbound or bound forms of TGA2. The following experimental strategy was used to investigate this question (CITATION ). Recombinant histidine-tagged TGA2 (35 μg input, I) was applied to a DNA-affinity column containing the double-stranded LS7 cis-element. LS7 is an activating sequence CITATION previously shown to be bound in vitro by TGA2 CITATION. In our experiments, as expected, the flowthrough (FT) fraction (∼50% total input) consists of the DNA-inactive form of TGA2, while the eluted (E) fraction is highly enriched for the fraction of TGA2 that is competent to bind DNA. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining showed that unbound and eluted fractions contain roughly similar amounts of TGA2 (CITATIONB). Subsequently, the DNA-binding activity of the two fractions was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (CITATIONC), which shows that 10ng of either input or eluted TGA2 protein bound the LS7 DNA probe (lanes 3 and 5), whereas TGA2 from the flowthrough fraction failed to bind probe (lanes 6 and 7). These findings suggest that differences in TGA2 binding activity are related to conformational/structural properties of the polypeptides in the two fractions. TGA2 from these fractions was then tested with an in vitro assay (CITATIOND) for its ability to bind NPR1 or, as the negative control, a mutant NPR1 (i.e., npr1–2) protein that lacks in vivo biological activity CITATION. While > 20% of TGA2 from input and flowthrough fractions bound NPR1 (lanes 6 and 7), < 1% of TGA2 from the eluate fraction bound NPR1 (lane 8). This level of interaction is similar to that seen with the NPR1 mutant (npr1–2; lanes 3–5). Together, these results indicate that NPR1 binds preferentially to the DNA-inactive form of TGA2. Efforts to characterize how NPR1 regulates TGA transcription factors will require a better understanding of the molecular determinants of these protein–protein interactions. While domains and residues in NPR1 that are important for interactions with TGA transcription factors have recently been identified by mutagenesis to a limited extent CITATION, complementary regions in specific TGA transcription factors that are necessary for binding of NPR1 are less well defined. This prompted us to test various mutant forms of TGA2 to identify NPR1 binding sequences. Previous studies using yeast two-hybrid screens with NPR1 as bait revealed that the moderately conserved CT domain of the TGA transcription factor family is necessary and sufficient for this interaction CITATION. Consequently we focused on the NPR1-binding role of this domain, by using GST fusion proteins of CT domain sequences (CITATIONA) in an NPR1 interaction assay. Our choice of sequences for nested deletions (Δ248 to Δ146) relied on a computational analysis CITATION of predicted coiled-coil motifs in TGA2; in other polypeptides, such motifs are known to mediate protein–protein interactions CITATION. Comparable amounts of recombinant GST and GST-TGA2 proteins were used in GST pull-down assays with [35S]-labeled NPR1 (CITATIONB) as ligand. While the negative control (GST) in this assay failed to bind NPR1 (lane 2), GST-TGA2 bound the labeled input NPR1 protein (lane 3). GST fusion proteins of mutants TGA2Δ248 (lane 4), Δ223 (lane 5), and Δ216 (lane 6) bound NPR1 to a degree that was comparable to that seen with full-length TGA2. TGA2Δ146, on the other hand, failed to bind NPR1 (lane 7). These results suggest that NPR1 recognizes TGA2 sequences that span residues 1–216. To further delineate this NPR1 binding region, we made a nested 5′ deletion series of CT domain sequences of TGA2 (CITATIONA) that were then used in GST pull-down assays with [35S]-labeled NPR1 or npr1–2 (CITATIONB). As expected, both full-length TGA2 and TGA2/CT 96–330 comparably bound NPR1 (lanes 4 and 6) but not npr1–2 (lanes 3 and 5). In addition to results cited above, residues 271–330 were also found to bind NPR1 (lanes 7–10). The simplest explanation for these data is that the CT domain of TGA2 contains two independent NPR1 binding sites, termed here as site A (1–216) and site B (271–330). Lastly, to further delineate site A, we tested several additional truncated polypeptide sequences of TGA2 (CITATIONA). We found that TGA2/CT polypeptides residues 96–216, 129–216, and 147–216 were unable to bind NPR1 (CITATIONB, lanes 3–5), unlike CT domain residues 247–330 that served as the positive control (lane 6). These results imply that additional sequences in the proximal basic/leucine-zipper region which lies upstream of the CT domain are required for site A binding activity. As neither of the two predicted coiled-coil motifs in TGA2 appeared to be required for NPR1 binding as inferred from CITATION, we looked to see whether they might instead play a role in mediating dimer stabilization and DNA-binding activities. While prior work has shown that most bZIP transcription factors require only the leucine-zipper region for dimerization, members of the TGA transcription factor family in addition require CT domain sequences to create the stable dimeric form that binds DNA CITATION. In vitro DNA-binding assays have previously served as an indirect measure of the dimerization potential of TGA transcription factors CITATION. We therefore tested whether each of the polyhistidine-tagged TGA2 proteins (CITATIONA) was able to bind DNA. Similar amounts of each TGA2 protein (CITATIONB) were used in gel-shift experiments with the LS7 probe (CITATIONC). Results indicate that many of the carboxyl-terminal deletions showed a marked reduction in their ability to bind DNA, although in several cases some residual activity was detected. For example, deletions of residues 271–330 markedly diminished, but did not ablate, DNA binding by this mutant TGA2 protein. Mutations that eliminated amino acids 248–330 or 223–330 further diminished, but did not completely inhibit, DNA-binding activity. In contrast, eliminating residues 216–330 or 146–330 completely abolished protein dimerization (C. Johnson, unpublished data) and DNA-binding activity. Consistent with results above, mutations that disrupt the two coiled-coil motifs do not significantly affect DNA-binding activity. From these data, we conclude that apart from the two coiled-coil motifs, residues 216 to 330 quantitatively contribute to dimerization and DNA-binding functions in TGA2.
!~MM~! The full-length cDNA of TGA2 (At5g06950) was generated using two different sets of oligonucleotides. In the first case, TGA2 cDNA was prepared using 5′-TTTGAATTCTCTGCTGATACCAGTCCGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-TTTATCGATGTCACTCTCTGGGTCGAGCAAGCC-3′ oligonucleotide primers and pET-23a TGA2 (gift from Eric Lam) as template. The product was then digested with EcoRI and ClaI and ligated into a pBluescript KS+ FLAG vector CITATION.

The different 5′ oligonucleotides used are listed below: TGA2/CT 96–216: 5′-CACCATGATTTCAGGCACAGGAGA-3′ TGA2/CT 129–216: 5′-CACCATGAACGAGCTGAGGTCTGCTCTGAAT-3′ TGA2/CT 147–216: 5′-CACCATAATAGTCGATGGTGTGATGGCTCACTATG-3′ TGA2/CT 96–216: 5′-CACCATGATTTCAGGCACAGGAGA-3′ TGA2/CT 129–216: 5′-CACCATGAACGAGCTGAGGTCTGCTCTGAAT-3′ TGA2/CT 147–216: 5′-CACCATAATAGTCGATGGTGTGATGGCTCACTATG-3′ The full-length cDNA of NPR1 (At1g64280, a kind gift from Xinnian Dong) was amplified by PCR with 5′-CACCATGGACACCACCATTGATGGATTCGCCG-3′ and 5′-TCACCGACGACGATGAGAGAGTTTAC-3′ oligonucleotides as primers. The resultant product was subcloned into designated pDEST vectors as above. The npr1–2 mutant CITATION was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type NPR1 using 5′-CCTAAAGGAGTTTCTGAATACGCAGACGAGAATTGCT-3′ (mutation is underlined) and the corresponding reverse complement oligonucleotide. All constructs were sequenced to verify the absence of unexpected mutations in their reading frames. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)- or poly-histidine (6 × His)-tagged versions of TGA2 polypeptides were expressed in E. coli strain BL21-AI (Invitrogen) following induction by arabinose. Soluble tagged recombinant proteins from cell lysates were purified as described by the manufacturer, using GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or TALON (BD Biosciences) resins as appropriate. Protein samples were quantified using a Lowry-based method (DC kit, BioRad) and analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-staining. Plasmid templates of NPR1 or npr1–2, or His-tagged TGA2 polypeptides were synthesized in vitro by coupled T7 transcription and reticulolysate-mediated translation reactions (TnT kit, Promega) containing either non-radioactive or [35S]-labeled methionine (Easytag, 1000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer). Oligonucleotide concatamers of LS7 (sense, TTACTTACGTCATAGATGTGGC, and antisense, GCCACATCTATGACGTAAGTAA) were covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then His-tagged recombinant TGA2 protein (∼0.5 mg) isolated as described above was added to the LS7 resin (∼350μg bound DNA) in a column that was pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min the column was washed with 2 × 5 ml (2 column vol.) of binding buffer, which was collected as the flowthrough fraction. Further washes did not result in any detectable protein in this fraction. DNA-bound protein was eluted with 2 ml binding buffer containing 350 mM KCl and concentrated, and then washed and equilibrated in 100 mM KCl in HEPES buffer, using an Amicon Ultra-4 device (Millipore). The recovered samples were quantified with a Lowry-based method (DC kit, BioRad) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-staining. Glycerol was added to 10% final concentration to the concentrated fractions, which were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until needed. DNA-binding reactions (30 μl) contained 15 μl of 2× binding buffer (40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM DTT, and 40% glycerol), 1 μg poly dI·dC, 1 μg BSA, 0–4 μl reticulocyte lysate (T7 coupled TnT kit, unlabeled protein) or 1–10ng (2.4–24 fmol) recombinant protein and 1 μl 32P-labeled probe (∼104cpm/ng DNA). The probe used in binding assays was the TTACTTACGTCATAGATGTGGC sequence of the LS7 promoter element, which was previously shown to bind TGA2 CITATION. DNA-binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10min and fractionated on a 5% native PAGE gel in 1× TBE at 8 V/cm for 90min. PAGE gels were subsequently vacuum-dried and visualized by autoradiography. Radiolabeled NPR1 and npr1–2 were prepared by coupled in vitro coupled transcription and translation (see above). These inputs were then used for binding assays with either His- or GST-tagged versions of TGA2. In the case of His-tagged TGA2 fractions from the LS7 column, binding reactions (50 μl) were done at room temperature for 10 min with 5 μl reticulocyte lysate and 2 μg protein in binding buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40 (Igepal CA630, Sigma)] and 20 μl (packed volume) TALON resin (BD Biosciences). Following 3 × 5 min washes, histidine-tagged proteins and associated proteins were eluted from the resin with 30 μl Laemmli loading buffer, fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, 1μg of recombinant GST or GST-TGA2 protein was coupled to 50 μl (packed volume) GSH-Sepharose resin, and mixed with 10 μl of [35S]-labeled wild-type or mutant NPR1 in 100 μl binding buffer (1 × PBS + 1% NP-40). Binding reactions were done at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 3 × 5 min washes with 1 ml binding buffer to remove unbound NPR1. The remaining bound NPR1 protein was eluted from the resin with 30 μl Laemmli loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography.
