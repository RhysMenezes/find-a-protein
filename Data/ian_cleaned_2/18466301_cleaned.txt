!~ABS~! Based on our previous findings, we proposed a pathway for the participation of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) in heat-shock (HS) signal transduction. The specific mechanism by which CaM regulates activation of heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs) is not known. CaM-binding protein kinases (CBK) are the most poorly understood of the CaM target proteins in plants. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that AtCBK3 interacts with AtHSFA1a. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to confirm the interaction between AtCBK3–YFP and AtHSFA1a–CFP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purified recombinant AtCBK3 phosphorylated recombinant AtHSFA1a in vitro. We also describe the results of both downregulation of AtCBK3 expression and ectopic overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana. The T-DNA insertion AtCBK3 knockout lines had impaired basal thermotolerance, which could be complemented by transformation of plants with the native gene. Overexpression of AtCBK3 resulted in plants with increased basal thermotolerance. Results from real-time quantitative PCR and protein gel-blot analyses suggest that AtCBK3 regulates transcription of heat-shock protein (HSP) genes and synthesis of HSPs. The binding activity of HSF to the heat-shock element (HSE), the mRNA level of HSP genes and synthesis of HSPs were upregulated in AtCBK3-overexpressing lines after HS, but downregulated in AtCBK3 null lines. These results indicate that AtCBK3 controls the binding activity of HSFs to HSEs by phosphorylation of AtHSFA1a, and is an important component of the HS signal transduction pathway.
!~RES~! In eukaryotic cells, the expression of HSP genes is mediated by HSFs, the terminal components of a signal transduction pathway mediating the response to HS. We proposed previously a pathway for the participation of Ca2+/CaM in HS signal transduction (CITATION). To address the questions of how CaM regulates activation of HSF and whether the HSFs can be phosphorylated by CBK, a yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the interaction between several AtCBKs (AtCBK1–3) and AtHSFA1a. The capacity of the yeast strain AH109 to grow on synthetic medium lacking Trp, Leu, His and adenine, and the β-galactosidase activity were the interaction reporters. In the absence of prey constructs, yeast strains expressing AtHSFA1a grow very slowly on medium lacking Trp, Leu, His and adenine, taking 12 days to grow, and the β-galactosidase reporter was also stimulated to a very low level, requiring 11 h for the filter assay to turn blue. The interaction between AtHSFA1a and AtCBK3 results in quicker growth on selection medium (only 4 days to grow; Figure 1a, image 4), while AtHSFA1a co-transformed with AtCBK1 or AtCBK2 result in no increase in growth rate over AtHSFA1a alone (Figure 1a, images 2 and 3). To confirm the interaction, the yeast strains that grew on medium lacking Trp and Leu were used to carry out filter assay. The interactions between AtHSFA1a and AtCBK3 (Figure 1b, image 4) or AtCBK2 (Figure 1b, image 3) were positive using the X-Gal filter assay, and the color changed to blue in a similar time (approximately 2 h). Thus AtCBK3 can interact with AtHSFA1a but AtCBK1 cannot, and there is the possibility of a weak or transient interaction between AtCBK2 and AtHSFA1a. [[FIGURE]] The in planta interaction between AtHSFA1a and AtCBK3 was confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET; CITATION; CITATION). We examined protein interactions in onion epidermal cells co-expressing AtHSFA1a–CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and AtCBK3–YFP (yellow fluorescent protein). The method used, FRETN, includes a normalization for the donor and acceptor concentrations (CITATION). Both AtHSFA1a–CFP and AtCBK3–YFP were present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figure 1c, images 1 and 2). Images 3 and 4 in Figure 1(c) are the FRET images before and after correction, respectively. The corrected FRET images show interaction between CFP and YFP, and indicate that AtHSFA1a and AtCBK3 interact in vivo. CITATION created a FRET model system for the quantitative FRET method. They concluded that ‘Donor and acceptor concentration should be of the same order of magnitude, and stable FRET measurements can only be achieved in the range of donor-to-acceptor ratios 0.1–10’ (CITATION). In our FRET experiment, the fluorescence of YFP ranged from 500 to 600, while that of CFP ranged from 100 to 200, so the fluorescence ratio is within the range 0.2–0.3. Brightness is the product of extinction coefficient and quantum yield (CITATION), and YFP has a greater brightness than CFP (YFP = 51; CFP = 13), hence the ratio is 0.8–1.2 after brightness correction (correction coefficient = 51/13 = 3.92). The in planta interaction between AtHSFA1a and AtCBK2 was also tested and shown to be negative (Figure S2). Because AtHSFA1a and AtCBK3 interact in vivo, AtHSFA1a might be a phosphorylation substrate. Both proteins were expressed as GST fusions in yeast (SP-Q01), and purified by GST affinity chromatography (Figure S3). The GST fusions were confirmed on immunoblots using anti-GST antibodies (Figure 2a). The in vitro results indicate that AtHSFA1a was specifically phosphorylated by AtCBK3 in the presence of calcium and CaM (Figure 2b, lane 3). The kinase assay was also performed using purified AtCBK2, which could not phosphoralate AtHSFA1a (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] As a step toward determining the function of AtCBK3, the expression pattern of a promoter–GUS fusion was determined in transgenic A. thaliana (Figure 3a). The promoter was active throughout the organs and tissues of young seedlings, as well as in flowers and siliques, indicating that expression of AtCBK3 is not organ- or tissue-specific. Analysis by real-time PCR confirmed above results (Figure 3b). These results suggest the promoter was active throughout the 10–14-day-old seedlings, so we used 10- or 14-day-old seedlings as material in the following experiments. [[FIGURE]] To genetically dissect the function of AtCBK3, we screened T-DNA insertion alleles of the AtCBK3 gene using lines deposited at the SALK Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (http://signal.salk.edu). A single T-DNA insertion line for AtCBK3 was identified (SALK-071004), and designated cbk3. As shown in Figure 4(a), the T-DNA in line cbk3 is inserted into the 7th intron. Analysis by RT-PCR revealed that expression of the AtCBK3 gene was almost completely suppressed in the mutant compared with the wild-type (WT; Figure 4b). For complementation analysis, we constructed a binary vector containing the whole coding region of the AtCBK3 gene under the control of the 35S promoter (pCAMBIA1300-35S:AtCBK3). Real-time quantitative PCR (real-time PCR) was used to study the expression of transgenic plants containing the complementation construct. The results show that most transgenic plants containing the construct expressed the AtCBK3 mRNA at a level comparable with that of WT plants. The complemented transgenic lines cbk3/AtCBK3 12–2 and 5–4 expressed a comparable level of AtCBK3 mRNA, while line cbk3/AtCBK3 24–3 showed about twofold greater expression of the AtCBK3 transcript (Figure 4c). Analysis by RT-PCR confirmed that expression of the AtCBK3 gene in the complemented mutant lines 12–2, 5–4 and 24–3 was rescued (Figure 4d). [[FIGURE]] No significant phenotypic changes were observed in line cbk3 compared with WT plants. The cbk3 mutant plants were then tested for differences in their responses to heat stress. Seedlings of 10-day-old cbk3 mutant, WT and complemented mutant plants were subjected to 45°C for 30 min, then returned to 22°C. The cbk3 mutant plants were impaired in basal thermotolerance (Figure 5a), and exhibited a significant delay in growth after heat treatment. Expression of AtCBK3 in line cbk3 was able to complement the heat sensitivity. Of ten homozygous lines obtained, six exhibited increased or similar thermotolerance compared to WT, but much higher thermotolerance than the mutant. The thermotolerance of the independent lines cbk3/AtCBK3 12–2 and 5–4 was the same as that of the WT, and line cbk3/AtCBK3 24–3 grew better than the WT after heat stress. The rescue of thermotolerance in the complemented mutant lines was confirmed by calculation of the survival rate. The 10-day-old seedlings were subjected to a 45°C HS for 30 min followed by recovery at 22°C for 7 days, and were then used to calculate the survival rate. The complemented mutant lines 12–2, 5–4 and 24–3 all exhibited higher survival rates after heat stress than mutant line cbk3, similar to the WT (Figure 5b). [[FIGURE]] Transgenic AtCBK3-overexpressing plants were prepared using the binary vectors pCAMBIA1300-35S:AtCBK3 or pCAMBIA1300-35S:AtCBK3-GFP. Twenty-eight independent T3 lines with a single copy of 35S:AtCBK, together with 23 independent T3 transgenic lines with a single copy of 35S:AtCBK3-GFP, were generated. The basal thermotolerance of the transgenic plants was tested and compared with that of WT or control plants transformed with the empty pCAMBIA1300 vector (plants 1300). Homozygous AtCBK3 transgenic plants, and WT or control plants 1300, were plated and grown for 10 days. All seedlings were exposed to 45°C for 45 min, and then returned to 22°C. Almost half (46%) of the 35S:AtCBK3 and 61% of the 35S:AtCBK3–GFP lines exhibited increased thermotolerance compared with WT or control plants 1300. To ensure that the phenotypic changes observed were caused by overexpression of the AtCBK3 transcript, total RNA was isolated from seedlings of four 35S:AtCBK3 transgenic lines (11–6, 60–2, 34–3, 76–2) and three 35S:AtCBK3–GFP transgenic lines (22–2, 5–6, 3–2) showing higher basal thermotolerance. Using real-time PCR analysis, we observed clear overexpression of the AtCBK3 gene in all transgenic lines tested, especially 35S:AtCBK3 line 34–3 and 35S:AtCBK3–GFP line 5–6. Line 34–3 had a 12-fold increase, while line 5–6 showed a 7-fold increase in AtCBK3 transcript levels compared to WT (Figure 6a,d). The basal thermotolerance of the 10-day-old transgenic seedlings, especially 35S:AtCBK3 line 34–3 and 35S:AtCBK3–GFP line 5–6, was increased compared with WT or control plants 1300. Most of the WT or control plants 1300 died after incubation at 45°C for 45 min. The AtCBK3-overexpressing plants survived this lethal stress. They exhibited a delay in growth after the heat stress, but turned green and resumed growth after 7 days of recovery at 22°C (Figure 6b,e). The survival rate of seedlings after the heat stress was calculated. The survival rate of AtCBK3-overexpressing transgenic lines including 35S:AtCBK3 lines and 35S:AtCBK3–GFP lines was higher than that of WT or control plants 1300 (Figure 6c,f). These results confirm the role of the AtCBK3 gene in improving the basal thermotolerance of A. thaliana seedlings. [[FIGURE]] Heat-shock proteins are induced by HS, and play an important role in acquisition of thermotolerance by plants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To understand whether expression of the AtCBK3 gene affects the expression of HSP genes, which subsequently affect thermotolerance of A. thaliana seedlings, a gel mobility shift assay was used to analyze the difference in binding activity of HSFs to HSEs in the cbk3 mutant plants, WT and three independent AtCBK3-overexpressing lines (34–3, 76–2, 11–6) after HS. Samples of whole-cell extracts from 10-day-old seedlings were heat-shocked at 37°C for 30 min, and a gel mobility shift assay was performed. Figure 7(a) shows that the binding activity of HSF was weaker in the cbk3 mutant line, but stronger in the three AtCBK3-overexpressing lines (34–3, 76–2, 11–6) than in WT plants. [[FIGURE]] Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of AtHSP18.2, AtHSP25.3, AtDjA2 (HSP40) and AtHSP83 in the cbk3 mutant plants, complemented mutant plants (line 12–2), WT and three independent AtCBK3-overexpressing lines (34–3, 76–2, 11–6) after incubation at 37°C for 1 h using real-time PCR. After HS, expression of all the HSP genes tested in the cbk3 mutant seedlings was only half of that in the WT seedlings. Overexpression of AtCBK3 in the cbk3 mutant was able to reverse the inhibition of expression of HSP genes. The mRNA level of HSP genes tested in the complemented line cbk3/CBK3 12–2 was comparable to that in the WT plants. Expression of the four HSP genes in the various AtCBK3-overexpressing lines was higher than that in the WT plants. In particular, the expression of AtHSP18.2, AtHSP25.3 and AtHSP83 in line 34–3 was 2–3-fold higher than that in the WT plants (Figure 7b–e). The effect of AtCBK3 on the synthesis of HSPs was also tested. Both 14-day-old WT seedlings and independent AtCBK3-overexpressing lines were treated at 37°C for 2 h or maintained at 22°C. Protein samples were separated by SDS–PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The HSP18.2 was detected using anti-Arabidopsis HSP18.2 antiserum. The chloroplast-localized sHSP (ClsHSP, small HSP) AtHSP25.3 was detected using anti-tomato ClsHSP antiserum. The results show that neither AtHSP25.3 nor AtHSP18.2 were expressed at 22°C, but were induced by HS. The accumulation of both AtHSP25.3 and AtHSP18.2 proteins in the AtCBK3-overexpressing lines (11–6, 34–3, 76–2) was higher than that in WT under HS conditions (Figure 8). Thus, changes in the expression of HSP genes in both cbk3 mutant plants and AtCBK3-overexpressing plants are linked to the change in thermotolerance. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The coding regions of AtHSFA1a, AtCBK1, AtCBK2 and AtCBK3 were amplified using the primer pairs listed in Table S1, then AtHSFA1a was ligated with NcoI/PstI-digested pGBKT7 (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/), and AtCBK1, AtCBK2 and AtCBK3 were ligated with BamHI/XhoI-, XhoI- and SmaI/BamHI-digested pGADT7 (Clontech), respectively. The yeast two-hybrid constructs pGADT7-AtCBK1/AtCBK2/AtCBK3 and pGBKT7-AtHSFA1a were introduced into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) using the lithium acetate method. Cells were plated onto selective medium lacking Trp and Leu, then putative transformants were transferred to medium lacking Trp, Leu, His and adenine. The activity of β-galactosidase was monitored using the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-β-d-galactoside (X-Gal) in a colony-lift filter assay (CITATION). Two constructs were created for FRET measurements. The coding region of AtHSFA1a was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CATGCCATGGGTTTTGTAAATTTCAAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CATGCCATGGCGTGTTCTGTTTCTGA-3′. The coding region of AtCBK3 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CATGCCATGGGGATGTGTCATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CATGCCATGGCAGCTTTTTGTAAGGT-3′. The PCR products were digested with NcoI (site underlined) and cloned into the plasmid pAVA-CFP or pAVA-YFP. pAVA-AtHSF1-CFP and pAVA-AtCBK3-YFP were co-transformed into onion epidermis cells by microprojectile bombardment and co-expressed. We also transformed pAVA-AtHSFA1a-CFP or pAVA-AtCBK3-YFP into onion epidermis cells separately. The onion cells were plated onto half-strength MS agar plates and incubated at 22°C for 20 h, then observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Three filter sets (Sutter Instrument Company, http://www.sutter.com) were used for the FRET measurements: (i) the donor filter set, consisting of an ET430/24x excitation filter and an ET470/24m emission filter; (ii) the acceptor filter set, consisting of an ET500/20x excitation filter and an ET535/30m emission filter; (iii) the FRET filter set, consisting of an ET430/24x excitation filter and an ET535/30m emission filter. The p-FRET (processed FRET) signal was calculated using the software MetaMorph 6.2 (Metamorph, http://www.moleculardevices.com/pages/software/metamorph.html) based on the equation: p-FRET = Raw FRET − A*accepter − B*donor, where coefficient A is the mean threshold intensity of acceptor images from the FRET filter set/mean threshold intensity of acceptor images from the acceptor filter (Figure S1), and coefficient B is the mean threshold intensity of donor images from the FRET filter set/mean threshold intensity of donor images from the donor filter set (Figure S1). To express AtCBK3 and AtHSFA1a in yeast cells as chimera with glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the AtCBK3 coding region was amplified by PCR from AtCBK3 cDNA using the forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGGGGATCTGTCATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACATGCATGCCTAAGCTTTTTGTAAG-3′. The PCR product was restriction digested, then ligated with the yeast expression vector pESP-2 (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com/) previously digested with BamHI and SphI. The AtHSFA1a coding region was amplified by PCR from the AtHSFA1a cDNA with using the forward primer 5′-GAAGATCTTATGTTTGTAAATTTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAAGATCTCTAGTGTTCTGTTTC-3′) primers. The PCR product was restriction-digested, then ligated with pESP-2 previously digested with BglII. The expression constructs were transformed into Schizosaccharomyces pombe SP-Q01 (Stratagene), and positive colonies were identified by their ability to grow on Edinburgh minimal medium (Stratagene) supplemented with thiamine. The GST fusion proteins were induced by growing the cells in Edinburgh minimal medium without thiamine, then the yeast cells were harvested, lysed and clarified by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 20 min. Clarified supernatants were applied to GST affinity columns (Stratagene), which were washed extensively with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% glycerol. Specifically bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The free glutathione was removed using a Centriprep concentrator (Millipore, http://www.millipore.com), and the buffer was exchanged for storage buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). All procedures were performed at 4°C, unless stated otherwise. One microgram of recombinant AtCBK3 or GST (control), 5 μg of AtHSFA1a and 1 μm, CaM were incubated in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP). Phosphorylation was initiated by adding 25 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP, followed by incubation at 30°C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding a one-fifth volume of 5× SDS–PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE, and the gels were vacuum-dried for autoradiography. Seeds of A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were surface-sterilized, plated on MS medium containing 1.0% w/v sucrose and 0.8% agar, and kept at 4°C for 3 days. Plants were then grown to the flowering stage in lit growth chambers at 22°C and approximately 100 μmol photons m−2 sec−1 on a 16 h day/night cycle. A T-DNA insertion line for AtCBK3 (SALK-071004) was obtained from the SALK Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory. Plants homozygous for the cbk3 insertion were used for further analysis. Assays of basal thermotolerance were conducted essentially as described by CITATION. Plates were exposed to a 45°C HS for 30 or 45 min, and then allowed to recover at 22°C for 7 days. Seedlings were photographed to record viability. The survival rate was determined as follows. The seedlings were grown under the same conditions and with the same heat treatment as above. After 7 days of recovery at 22°C, the survival of seedlings was monitored. The seedlings that were still green and producing new leaves were scored as surviving. The survival rate is the ratio of surviving seedlings to total seedlings planted. Each data point is the mean value from five independent experiments (50 seedlings per experiment). The AtCBK3 promoter was isolated by PCR using genomic DNA as the template and the forward primer 5′-AACTGCAGTCAAATCATTGCCTTCCAAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGAGAATTGTCAATTCGAAACGAAAAG-3′. The 1838 bp PCR fragment was ligated with PstI/XbaI-digested pCAMBIA1300 (CAMBIA, http://www.cambia.org). Ecotype Columbia plants were transformed by floral dip (CITATION); transformants selected on medium containing 25 μg ml−1 hygromycin. Histochemical staining for GUS expression was performed according to the method described by CITATION. Plants were incubated in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, containing 10 mg ml−1 X-Gluc and 0.02% v/v Triton X-100 at 22°C for 16 h. After staining, plants were washed with 70% ethanol for 1 h, followed by 100% ethanol for 3 h at room temperature. Transcript abundance in wild-type, T-DNA insertion mutant plants and complemented mutant lines was determined by RT-PCR. Denatured total RNA (1 μg) plus the forward primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGGATCTGTCATGGAAAACC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCGAATCTTTGACTCAGAAGC-3′ were used with the One Step RNA RT-PCR kit (Takara, http://www.takara.com). Reverse transcription proceeded for 30 min at 50°C, followed by 94°C for 2 min, then 30 cycles of PCR at 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The actin transcript was used as the internal control, with the forward primer 5′-AGGCACCTCTTAACCCTAAAGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGACAACGGAATCTCTCAGC-3′. The AtCBK3 coding region was amplified by PCR from AtCBK3 cDNA using the forward primer 5′-GCTCTAGAAACAATGGGGATCTGTCATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGACTAGTCTAAGCTTTTTGTAAG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300 digested with XbaI and SpeI. For construction of the AtCBK3–GFP fusion, the AtCBK3 cDNA was used as the template and amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′- GCTCTAGATTCAATGGGGATCTGTCATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCCAGCTTTTTGTAAGGTC-3′. The fragment was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300-35S:GFP using XbaI and BamHI sites. The constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. The pCAMBIA1300-35S:AtCBK3 vector was introduced into both the cbk3 mutant and WT plants, and the pCAMBIA1300-35S:AtCBK3-GFP vector was introduced into WT plants, by the floral dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected on MS medium containing 25 μg ml−1 hygromycin; homozygous transformants were used in all analyses. Primer pairs for real-time PCR were designed using Primer Express (Perkin-Elmer, http://www.perkinelmer.com; Table S2). Gene-specific primers were chosen so that the PCR products were 80–130 bp. Total RNA (2 μg) was treated with Dnase I and used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers and Taqman reverse transcription reagent (Applied Biosystems, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/) at 25°C for 10 min and then 48°C for 30 min. For real-time PCR, the reaction mixture consisted of cDNA first-strand template, primer mix (5 μm) and SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 25 μl. The PCR conditions were: 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. The reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). A relative quantification real-time PCR method was used to compare expression of the genes in mutant and overexpressing lines with WT (CITATION). Relative quantification describes the change in expression of the target gene in a test sample relative to calibrator sample. Here actin was used as the internal control. The sample of WT was used as the calibrator, with the expression level of the sample set to 1. Each data point is the mean value from biological triplicate determinations. Fourteen-day-old seedlings were treated at 37°C for 2 h, then 200–300 mg plant material were ground in liquid N2, mixed with 600 μl buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, containing 400 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mm PMSF), then clarified by centrifugation (12 000 g for 20 minutes). Samples corresponding to 30 mg of protein were resolved by SDS–PAGE, then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated for 12 h at room temperature in PBS containing 5% w/v non-fat dry milk, and then incubated in PBST containing the appropriate antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. Extraction of whole-cell extracts from 10-day-old A. thaliana seedlings was performed according to the method described by CITATION. Heat shock was applied by incubating the whole-cell extract in a water bath at 37°C for 30 min. The sequences and labeling of HSE oligonucleotides and the gel mobility shift assay were performed as described by CITATION.
