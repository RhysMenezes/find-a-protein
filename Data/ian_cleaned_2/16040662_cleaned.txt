!~ABS~! Degradation of unsaturated fatty acids through the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway requires the participation of auxiliary enzymes in addition to the enzymes of the core β-oxidation cycle. The auxiliary enzyme Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) isomerase has been well studied in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals, but no plant homolog had been identified and characterized at the biochemical or molecular level. A candidate gene (At5g43280) was identified in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) encoding a protein showing homology to the rat (Rattus norvegicus) Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, and possessing an enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase fingerprint as well as aspartic and glutamic residues shown to be important for catalytic activity of the mammalian enzyme. The protein, named AtDCI1, contains a peroxisome targeting sequence at the C terminus, and fusion of a fluorescent protein to AtDCI1 directed the chimeric protein to the peroxisome in onion (Allium cepa) cells. AtDCI1 expressed in Escherichia coli was shown to have Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity in vitro. Furthermore, using the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate in yeast peroxisomes as an analytical tool to study the β-oxidation cycle, expression of AtDCI1 was shown to complement the yeast mutant deficient in the Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, thus showing that AtDCI1 is also appropriately targeted to the peroxisome in yeast and has Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity in vivo. The AtDCI1 gene is expressed constitutively in several tissues, but expression is particularly induced during seed germination. Proteins showing high homology with AtDCI1 are found in gymnosperms as well as angiosperms belonging to the Monocotyledon or Dicotyledon classes.
!~RES~! The search for a Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase in Arabidopsis was first performed through homology searches using the BLASTP program available on The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database (www.arabidopsis.org) with protein sequences for the Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase from yeast and rat (Rattus norvegicus). The Arabidopsis genome contained only one protein of unknown function, encoded by At4g16210, showing low, but significant, homology to the yeast Dci1p (E = 2×10−6). In contrast, analysis with the rat protein sequence revealed the existence of seven Arabidopsis proteins with E-values higher than 5×10−10. These proteins are, in decreasing order, At5g43280 (E = 1×10−60), At4g16800 (E = 1×10−19), At4g16210 (E = 3×10−16), At1g60550 (E = 1×10−12), At3g06860 (E = 2×10−11), At2g30650 (E = 3×10−11), and At4g29010 (E = 8×10−10). All these proteins contain regions with homology to the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase fingerprint (Interpro domain IPR001753; www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan). Genes At3g06860 and At4g29010 encode the previously characterized peroxisomal multifunctional enzymes, while At2g30650 codes for a peroxisomal hydroxybutyryl-CoA hydratase (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Of the remaining proteins, only At4g16210 and At5g43280 possess a peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS), namely a PTS1 at the C terminus, indicating their potential localization in the peroxisome, and only At5g43280 showed correct alignment with the rat Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase with regard to the Asp and Glu residues defined to be important for catalytic activity (CITATION; CITATION; Fig. 1). The protein encoded by At5g43280 was thus assigned the name AtDCI1 and analyzed in further detail. [[FIGURE]] AtDCI1 encodes a protein of 278 amino acids with a predicted pI of 7.6 and a calculated Mr of 29,920. Figure 1 shows the alignment of the Arabidopsis protein with human (Homo sapiens), rat, and yeast Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerases. Based on the Blosum62 matrix, AtDCI1 exhibits 39%, 37%, and 18% amino acid identity to rat, human, and yeast Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerases, respectively. The Arabidopsis protein is thus more closely related to the mammalian enzyme than to the yeast counterpart. AtDCI1 shares with other Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerases the hydratase/isomerase fingerprint found between amino acids 118 and 138, but does not contain a predictable mitochondrial transit peptide as found in the mammalian homologs. The protein AtDCI1 contains the tripeptide Ala-Lys-Leu at the carboxy end, a major PTS1 in plants conforming to the consensus sequence Ser-Lys-Leu (CITATION). In order to confirm the peroxisomal nature of AtDCI1, the localization of a fusion protein between an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) at the N terminus and AtDCI1 protein at the C terminus was analyzed by a transient transformation assay of onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells with the corresponding gene fusion. As a control, a second plasmid carrying a fusion gene between an enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and the peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) was used. The EYFP:AtDCI1 and ECFP:MDH gene constructs were transformed either individually or together in onion epidermal cells and the fluorescence was examined by confocal microscopy after 12 h. Control experiments have determined that fluorescence of the EYFP and ECFP could be detected without cross-interference when expressed in the same cells (data not shown). Cells expressing the EYFP:AtDCI1 have a punctate fluorescence pattern that was expected for proteins located in the peroxisomes (Fig. 2A). In cells cotransformed with the EYFP:AtDCI1 and ECFP:MDH gene constructs, the fluorescence pattern observed with the EYFP:AtDCI1 matched precisely the pattern observed with the ECFP:MDH, revealing that AtDCI1 is a peroxisomal protein (Fig. 2, B and C). [[FIGURE]] The ability of the AtDCI1 protein to catalyze the conversion of Δ3,5-dienoyl-CoA to Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA in an in vitro assay was tested. The AtDCI1 gene was modified to add a His-tag at the N terminus of the protein and the final construct cloned in an Escherichia coli vector allowing gene expression and protein synthesis under the control of a T7 promoter (see “Materials and Methods”). Enzyme assays were performed either with crude extracts from cells expressing AtDCI1, with AtDCI1 protein purified from the bacterial extract on a nickel affinity column, or from crude extracts from cells transformed with the expression plasmid without the AtDCI1 gene (negative control plasmid). Isomerization of a Δ3,5-dienoyl-CoA to a Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA can be followed by monitoring changes of the UV absorption spectrum (CITATION; CITATION). The Δ3,5-dienoyl-CoA has a maximum absorption peak at 240 nm, whereas the Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA has a maximum absorption peak at 260 nm and a shoulder peak at 300 nm. The difference of absorption at 300 nm is thus used to monitor the formation of the product of the Δ3,5,Δ2,4 isomerization reaction. A diagram showing the in vitro reaction cascade used is presented in Figure 3A. Synthesis of the substrate for the isomerization assay is achieved from the reaction of arachidonoyl-CoA (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA) with the yeast acyl-CoA oxidase, which also possesses an intrinsic Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity, resulting in the formation of 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA. This reaction can be followed by an increase in the absorption at 240 nm (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Enzyme assays with crude extracts from bacteria expressing the AtDCI1 protein were compared to extract from bacteria transformed with the negative control plasmid and grown under the same conditions. The conversion of 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA to 2,4,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA via the isomerization of the intermediate 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA was shown to be strictly dependent on both the expression of the AtDCI1 protein in E. coli (Fig. 3B, comparison of the black and white circles) and the prior incubation of the starting substrate 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA with the yeast acyl-CoA oxidase (Fig. 3B, white diamonds). No increase in A300 was observed if extracts from bacteria transformed with the negative control plasmid were used or if the acyl-CoA oxidase was omitted from the reaction cascade. The reaction cascade from 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA to 2,4,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA was also monitored by the 220- to 340-nm absorbance spectra (Fig. 3C). Thus, the conversion of 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA to 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA by the yeast acyl-CoA oxidase and its intrinsic Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity is shown by the increase in A250 (Fig. 3C, white square and black diamond), while the isomerization of 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA to 2,4,8,11,14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA was followed by the dramatic increase in A300 (Fig. 3C, white triangle). The specific activity of the extracts measured in the linear range of activity using 100 μm arachidonoyl-CoA were 5.32 ± 0.26 μmol min−1 mg−1 (n = 3) for crude extracts and 16.63 ± 6.72 μmol min−1 mg−1 (n = 5) for nickel column affinity-purified fractions. The potential presence of a Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity associated with the AtDCI1 protein was assayed as described by CITATION with crude and purified extracts. No such activities could be detected (data not shown). The Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity of the AtDCI1 protein was tested in vivo through the expression of the plant protein in a yeast mutant having a deletion in the Dci1 gene (YOR180c), encoding the Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (Dci1p), and expressing a bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase targeted to the peroxisome. Synthesis of PHA in the peroxisome of yeast and Arabidopsis has previously been shown to be a valuable tool to monitor the in vivo carbon flux through the β-oxidation pathway (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In this system, PHA is synthesized from the polymerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates generated by the β-oxidation of fatty acids via the activity of a PHA synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa modified for peroxisomal targeting (CITATION). The Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity can be monitored in yeast synthesizing peroxisomal PHA from the β-oxidation of the fatty acid 10-cis,13-cis-nonadecadienoic acid (H.M. Bogdawa, Y. Poirier, and S. Marchesini, unpublished data). Based on current knowledge of the activity of yeast auxiliary enzymes involved in β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, degradation of 10-cis,13-cis-nonadecadienoic acid gives the intermediate 2-trans-5-cis-undecadienoyl-CoA (CITATION; CITATION). This intermediate can be further metabolized via several pathways that are distinguishable by the nature of the 11-carbon 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA generated. Thus, in one pathway independent of the Dci1p, the intermediate 3-hydroxy,5-cis-undecenoyl-CoA is generated, while the intermediate 3-hydroxyundecanoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxy,4-trans-undecenoyl-CoA are generated by two other pathways requiring the participation of the Dci1p (Fig. 4). Whereas the intermediates 3-hydroxy,5-cis-undecenoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyundecanoyl-CoA are substrates for the bacterial PHA synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs with an unsaturated bond on the fourth carbon, such as 3-hydroxy,4-trans-undecenoyl-CoA, are known to be very poor substrates for the PHA synthase (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). Thus, the monomer 3-hydroxy,5-cis-undecenoic acid and 3-hydroxyundecanoic acid in PHA synthesized from cells degrading the fatty acid 10-cis,13-cis-nonadecadienoic acid are markers of the carbon flux through the pathways that are independent or dependent, respectively, of the Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. [[FIGURE]] The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry profiles of the 11-carbon monomers present in PHA synthesized in yeast cells grown in media containing 10-cis,13-cis nonadecedienoic acid are shown in Figure 5. Hydroxyacid monomers present in PHA are identified with the prefix H, followed by the number of carbons and the number of unsaturated bonds. While both the H11:1 and H11:0 monomers are present in wild-type cells, only the H11:1 monomer is detectable in the dci1Δ mutant, thus confirming that the generation of the intermediate 3-hydroxyundecanoyl-CoA is dependent on the presence of the Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase encoded by Dci1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Expression of the Arabidopsis AtDCI1 gene in the dci1Δ strain resulted in a PHA containing both the H11:1 and H11:0 monomers (Fig. 5C), thus revealing that AtDCI1 possesses Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity in vivo. [[FIGURE]] The temporal and spatial expression profile of AtDCI1 was determined by northern-blot analysis. Transcript level of AtDCI1 in whole seedlings strongly increases upon germination, decreasing slightly from day 2 to day 4, and increasing again at day 5 and day 7 (Fig. 6A). A similar pattern of expression was also observed for the AtAIM1 gene encoding the peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme, with the exception of the high expression level of AtAIM1 present in hydrated seeds at 4°C (0 d after imbibition [DAI]; CITATION). The AtDCI1 gene appears to be expressed at a similar level in green leaves, senescing leaves, flowers, and floral stems, but at lower level in roots. [[FIGURE]] The sequences available in public databases were used to identify homologs to AtDCI1 in a large spectrum of plants, including both a gymnosperm (Pinus taeda) and several angiosperms belonging to the Monocotyledon (Oryza sativa, Zea mays) or Dicotyledon (Nicotiana benthamiana, Lycopersicon esculentum, Citrus sinesis, Medicago truncatula) classes. An alignment of the sequences revealed a high level of amino acid conservation distributed throughout the protein with the exception of a region of low homology corresponding to amino acids 74 to 93 in AtDCI1 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, DCI1 from monocots have an additional 12- to 14-amino acid extension at the N terminus compared to dicots. This N-terminal extension does not appear to contain any targeting information to a subcellular compartment (data not shown). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Searches against the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sequence database were done using the BLASTP algorithm available from the TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/Blast). The characterized Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerases cited in this article are from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; ScDci1p; YOR180c; CITATION; CITATION), rat (Rattus norvegicus; RnECH1; NP_072116; CITATION), and humans (Homo sapiens; HsECH1; AAH17408; CITATION). Protein sequences of the Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase from Arabidopsis, rat, human, and yeast were aligned using ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). Genes homologous to the Arabidopsis Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase in other plants were searched by TBLASTN using the AtDCI1 sequence and performed against Oryza sativa and Nicotiana benthamiana expressed sequence tag (EST) collections available on GenBank. The DCI1 in O. sativa and N. benthamiana are encoded by the EST XM_463670 and EST CK294507, respectively. For other plants, genes homologous to AtDCI1 were found by TBLASTN using sequences available on the plant genome database (http://www.plantgdb.org; CITATION). Accession references for the corresponding EST or Genome Survey Sequence (GSS) contigs are Zea mays ZmGSStuc04-27-04.27328; Lycopersicon esculentum LeTUC02-10-21.12451; Citrus sinensis CsTUC04-08-17.4127; and Medicago truncatula MtTUC04-08-17.5308. For Pinus taeda, the deduced PtDCI1 gene was derived from the assembly of ESTs CF470462 and CF400188. Escherichia coli DH5α was used to maintain and propagate all plasmids, according to CITATION, with the exception of Gateway native plasmids (pDEST17, pDONR207), which were maintained in E. coli DB3.1 (Invitrogen, Brenda, The Netherlands). For experiments aimed at protein expression in E. coli, the strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS was used. The bacterial expression vector pDEST17-AtDCI was constructed by Gateway recombination. High-fidelity (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) PCR was performed on pYE352-AtDCI (see yeast section) using the primers AttB1-DCI 5′-(AttB1)TAATGACAATGGAGTCATAC-3′ and AttB2-DCI 5′-(AttB2)TCAAAGTTTAGCAAACCG-3′. The product was recombined in a BP reaction to the pDONR207 plasmid (Invitrogen), resulting in the plasmid pDONR207-AtDCI. This entry clone was finally LR recombined with pDEST17 (Invitrogen) to result in the pDEST17-AtDCI. Bacteria carrying this plasmid were grown to saturation in selective Luria-Bertani medium at 37°C. This starter culture was used to initiate a selective NCYZM medium culture. Cells were grown at 29°C to an OD600 of approximately 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside, and grown for 4 to 8 additional hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by four cycles of 10-s sonication followed by 30 s on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was adjusted to 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. His-tagged proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography with His-select nickel affinity gel (Sigma, St. Louis), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzymatic assays were performed essentially as previously described (CITATION). Arachidonoyl-CoA and yeast acyl-CoA oxidase were purchased from Sigma and 100 μm and 0.2 units were used, respectively, per assay in a volume of 500 μL of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA. Optical density measurements were made with an Ultrospec 2000 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The plasmids pCAT-ECFP-MDH and pCAT-EYFP-Not have previously been described (CITATION). In-frame fusion of AtDCI with the EYFP was achieved by amplifying AtDCI1 from pYE352-AtDCI with the primers dci-YFP-5′ 5′-TAAGGGCCCTGACAATGGAGTCA-3′ and dci-YFP-3′ 5′-TAATCTAGAGTATCAAAGTTTAGCAAA-3′, restricting the fragment with Bsp120I and XbaI and inserting the fragment into pCAT-EYFP-Not digested with NotI and XbaI. Plasmids were precipitated on gold beads and transformed into the epidermis of fresh onions (Allium cepa) as previously described (CITATION). Tissues were left 12 h in the dark on solid medium containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts. Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg). Wavelengths were set on appropriate parameters for YFP and CFP. Images were analyzed and combined using Leica confocal software. They represent the flat projection of images acquired at maximal frequency with a step size of 0.6 μm on depth of 22 μm; colors are artificial. Wild-type yeast strain BY4742 (matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and the isogenic dci1Δ mutant (YOR180c::kanMX4) were obtained from EUROSCARF (www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/index.html). Plasmids were transformed into yeast strains by the lithium acetate procedure (CITATION). Yeast strains were propagated on selective media composed of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% Glc, and appropriate dropout supplement (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The yeast shuttle plasmid Yiplac111-PHA containing the PHAC1 synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa modified for peroxisomal targeting by the addition, at the carboxyl end of the protein, of the last 34 amino acids of the Brassica napus isocitrate lyase, has previously been described (CITATION). The shuttle plasmid pYE352-AtDCI was constructed by replacing the catalase A gene from pYE352-CTA (CITATION) by AtDCI. This was achieved by amplification of AtDCI from the cDNA clone AI996999 (Genome Systems, St. Louis) with high-fidelity polymerase (Roche) using the primers 5′-CACGCGAGCTCATCATCACTGT-3′ and 5′-CAACCTCGAGACTGTATCAAAG-3′, followed by restriction with SacI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing. For experiments analyzing PHA synthesis in cells growing in media containing 10-cis,13-cis-nonadecadienoic acid, a stationary phase culture of cells grown in selective media containing 2% Glc was harvested by centrifugation, cells were washed once in water, and resuspended at a 1:10 dilution in fresh selective media containing 0.1% (w/v) Glc, 2% Pluronic-127 (w/v; Sigma), and 0.05% (v/v) 10-cis,13-cis-nonadecadienoic acid. Cells were grown for an additional 3 to 4 d before harvesting them for PHA analysis as previously described (CITATION). 10-cis,13-cis-Nonadecadienoic acid was purchased from Nu-Check-Prep (Elysian, MN). Seeds of Arabidopsis, accession Columbia (Col-0), were sterilized and plated on media containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts, 1% Suc, and 0.8% agar. Plates were first placed at 4°C for 48 h before placing them under constant illumination (70 μE m−2) at 21°C (defined as 0 DAI). After 15 DAI, plants were transplanted into soil under the same light and temperature conditions. Whole plants were collected from plates from 0 to 7 DAI. Green leaves, senescent leaves (30%–50% chlorotic), stems, and flower buds were collected from plants grown in pots 40 DAI. Roots were harvested 7 DAI on plants grown in liquid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2% Suc. Total RNA was extracted with hot borate protocol (CITATION) for seedlings from 0 to 5 DAI and with the LiCl protocol (http://www2.unil.ch/ibpv/WWWPR/Docs/rna_preparation.htm) for all other samples. Northern blots were made with 20 μg of total RNA, according to CITATION. [32P]dCTP-labeled probes were made by random priming using the prime-a-gene labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI) and purified on the ProbeQant kit (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in sodium phosphate buffer, 25 mm, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.372 g L−1 EDTA at 65°C. Washes were done at 65°C, twice for 10 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, then twice for 10 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Autoradiographic signals were quantified using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). For ratio calculations, the autoradiographic signals were divided by the negative intensity of the ethidium bromide signal of the corresponding sample. Upon request, all novel materials described in this publication will be made available in a timely manner for noncommercial research purposes.
