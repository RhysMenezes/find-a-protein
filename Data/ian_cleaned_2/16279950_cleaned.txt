!~ABS~! Proton pump interactor, isoform 1 (PPI1) is a novel interactor of the C‐terminus of Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane H+‐ATPase (EC 3.6.3.6) (Morandini P, Valera M, Albumi C, Bonza MC, Giacometti S, Ravera G, Murgia I, Soave C & De Michelis MI (2002) Plant J31, 487–497). We produced two fusion proteins consisting of, respectively, the first 88 amino acids or the entire protein deleted of the last 24 hydrophobic amino acids, and we show that the latter protein has a threefold higher affinity for the H+‐ATPase. PPI1‐induced stimulation of H+‐ATPase activity dramatically decreased with the increase of pH above pH 6.8, but became largely pH‐independent when the enzyme C‐terminus was displaced by fusicoccin‐induced binding of 14‐3‐3 proteins. The latter treatment did not affect PPI1 affinity for the H+‐ATPase. These results indicate that PPI1 can bind the H+‐ATPase independently of the C‐terminus conformation, but is not able to suppress the C‐terminus auto‐inhibitory action. 
!~RES~! The C‐terminus of isoform 1 of the PM H+‐ATPase of A. thaliana (AHA1) interacts with the first 88 amino acids of PPI1 [CITATION], indicating that the PM H+‐ATPase binding site of PPI1 is localized therein. Indeed, fusion proteins containing the first 88 amino acids of PPI1, linked either to a His‐tag (His6PPI188) or to GST, interact with A. thaliana H+‐ATPase in the PM and stimulate its activity [CITATION]. However, other parts of the protein may be important for regulation of the interaction. As the entire PPI1 protein was difficult to handle due to low solubility (unpublished results from the authors' laboratory), we expressed in Escherichia coli a truncated protein devoid of the hydrophobic C‐tail, with a His6‐tag at the C‐terminal end, far away from the interaction site (PPI1588His6). The fusion protein was purified by Ni‐NTA affinity chromatography and its ability to interact with the H+‐ATPase C‐terminus was tested against another fusion protein harboring the last 104 amino acids of AHA1 fused to GST, GST–AHA1(846–949). Figure 1 shows that PPI1588His6 and GST–AHA1(846–949) bound each other in overlay experiments both when a membrane spotted with GST–AHA1(846–949) was incubated with PPI1588His6 (Fig. 1A) and when PPI1588His6 was spotted and the membrane incubated with GST–AHA1(846–949) (Fig. 1B); the signals were specific as no signal was detected when free GST was spotted and the membrane incubated with PPI1588His6 (Fig. 1A) or when an unrelated His‐tagged protein was spotted and the membrane incubated with GST–AHA1(846–949) (Fig. 1B).  [[FIGURE]] The ability of PPI1588His6 to activate the H+‐ATPase in PM isolated from cultured A. thaliana cells was compared to that of His6PPI188. Figure 2 shows that both proteins stimulated the H+‐ATPase activity assayed at pH 6.4 in a concentration‐dependent manner, but PPI1588His6 was about threefold more effective than His6PPI188. The k0.5 values evaluated from five independent experiments were 0.4 ± 0.1 µm for PPI1588His6 and 1.7 ± 0.2 µm for His6PPI188. Thus, all the following experiments were performed with PPI1588His6.  [[FIGURE]] The analysis of the effect of PPI1588His6 on the dependence of PM H+‐ATPase activity on the concentration of MgATP (Fig. 3) showed that stimulation decreased with the increase of PPI1588His6 concentration. Consequently, PPI1588His6 only slightly increased Vmax but substantially lowered the apparent Km for MgATP.  [[FIGURE]] Activation of the PM H+‐ATPase by cleavage or by displacement of the auto‐inhibitory C‐terminal domain is strongly pH‐dependent, increasing with the increase of pH beyond the relatively acidic pH optimum of enzyme activity [CITATION, CITATION-CITATION]. The dependence of H+‐ATPase activation by PPI1588His6 on the pH of the assay medium is completely different: Fig. 4 shows that the effect of PPI1588His6 on H+‐ATPase activity was very high at pH 6.0, but decreased with the increase of pH, virtually disappearing above pH 7.0. As a consequence, the pH optimum for enzyme activity is slightly more acidic in the presence of PPI1588His6 than in its absence.  [[FIGURE]] A completely different picture emerged when the effect of PPI1588His6 on H+‐ATPase activity was assayed in PM isolated from FC‐treated cells. FC determines a stable association of 14‐3‐3 proteins to the C‐terminus of the H+‐ATPase, locking the enzyme in an active conformation [CITATION, CITATION, CITATION-CITATION]. Consequently (Fig. 5), enzyme activity stayed high throughout the pH range examined (up to pH 7.1). Addition of PPI1588His6 further enhanced the H+‐ATPase activity in a pH‐independent manner.  [[FIGURE]] The different conformation of the enzyme C‐terminus in PM isolated from control or FC‐treated cells may alter the accessibility of PPI1588His6. To test this possibility, we analyzed PPI1588His6‐induced activation of the H+‐ATPase in the two PM fractions as a function of PPI1588His6 concentration. Assays were performed at pH 7.0 to ensure at the same time effective auto‐inhibition and reliable measurements of PPI1 effect in control PM. The results reported in Fig. 6 show that stimulation of the H+‐ATPase activity in PM isolated from control or FC‐treated cells similarly increased with the increase of PPI1588His6 concentration; the k0.5 values evaluated from three independent experiments were 0.24 ± 0.06 and 0.19 ± 0.02 µm, respectively, for control PM and PM from FC‐treated cells.

!~MM~!  Escherichia coli XL10 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for recombinant DNA work while BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and BL21(DE3) Codon plusTM pRil strains (Stratagene) were employed as hosts for protein expression. All strains were grown in Lennox broth base (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA).  Bacterial transformation was according to the protocol of [CITATION]. Soluble proteins were assayed with the Bio‐Rad protein assay (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with γ‐globulin as a standard, while membrane proteins were assayed according to [CITATION] with bovine serum albumin as a standard.  A DNA fragment coding for the first 588 amino acids of PPI1 protein was amplified from clones isolated previously [CITATION] using the following primers: gatggatcccatATGGGTGTTGAAGTTGTA annealing around the start codon of the Ppi1 ORF and gactcgagATTAGTCGACTTCTTACGC annealing just before the putative transmembrane domain (capital letter in the sequence represent nucleotides matching target sequence). The PCR product was cloned into pET‐32b plasmid (Novagen) deleted of the thioredoxin gene, using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was transferred into E. coli strain XL10 and the frame and the identity of the cloned fragment verified by sequencing. The construct with the N‐terminal portion of PPI1 has been previously described [CITATION].  The DNA fragment coding for the last 104 amino acids (Ser846–Val949) of AHA1 was amplified from EST clones 49E5 from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Ohio State University, OH, USA) using the following primers: ggatcccatatgAGCGGAAAGGCGTGG and ggatcctcaCACAGTGTAGTGA. The PCR product was cloned into pGEX‐2TK vector for fusion to GST, using the BamHI restriction site. The frame and identity of the PCR product were checked by sequencing.  The plasmid encoding the PPI1 protein truncated of its terminal 24 hydrophobic amino acids with a His6‐tag at its C‐terminus (PPI1588His6) was transformed into BL21(DE3) Codon plusTM pRil strain (Stratagene) and its expression was induced in liquid cultures at 37 °C (0.6–0.7 D595) with 1 mm isopropyl thio‐β‐d‐galactoside (IPTG). After 1 h of induction, cells were cooled on ice, centrifuged and stored at −80 °C. Cells pellets were lysed in the presence of 0.4%N‐lauroyl sarcosine [CITATION] and sonicated until a clear, non viscous solution was obtained. Particulate matters were removed by centrifugation (15 min at 12 000 g) and the soluble fraction loaded onto a Ni2+‐NTA agarose affinity column. Protein was purified essentially as described by the Ni‐NTA supplier (Qiagen, Milan, Italy). Eluted fractions were monitored by SDS/PAGE, pooled and concentrated by centrifugation with Vivaspin 15R (cut‐off 30 kDa; Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany). Imidazole was removed by repeated cycles of concentration‐dilution with 1 mm BTP‐Hepes pH 8.0, glycerol 10% (w/v) Brij 58 (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was added to the sample (0.1 mg·mL−1) in the first concentration cycle.  The expression of the N‐terminal portion of the protein (His6PPI188) was done in the same conditions of PPI1588His6, but with 3 h of induction. Protein was purified essentially as described by the Ni‐NTA supplier (Qiagen). Eluted fractions were monitored by SDS/PAGE, pooled and concentrated by centrifugation with Vivaspin 6 (cut‐off 5 kDa; Vivascience AG). Imidazole was removed as described above.  The C‐terminus of AHA1 fused to GST, GST–AHA(1846–949) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)Codon plusTM pRIL (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C until D595 of 0.6 was reached, then 1 mm IPTG was added and the culture grown for 2 h. GST–AHA(1846–949) was purified by affinity chromatography on Glutathione Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The purification procedure was performed under native conditions as described in the manufacturer instructions except for the addition of 0.1% (w/v) lysozyme and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X‐100 during cell lysis.  His6‐ACA81−116 was produced as described by Luoni et al. [CITATION].  Cell suspension cultures of A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg were grown as described in [CITATION]. In vivo treatment with FC was performed for 120 min by adding the phytotoxin to the culture medium at the final concentration of 10 µm. Cells were harvested by a double centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min; highly purified PM fractions were obtained by a two‐step aqueous two‐phase partitioning system as described in Olivari et al. [CITATION].  The interaction between PPI1588His6 and the C‐terminus of the PM H+‐ATPase was tested both by incubating with PPI1588His6 a membrane on which GST–AHA(1846–949) (5 µm) had been spotted, and, vice versa, by incubating with GST–AHA(1846–949) a membrane on which PPI1588His6 (3 µm) had been spotted. Fusion proteins were spotted (2 µL of each) onto 0.2 µm nitrocellulose and incubated for 3 h at room temperature in blocking solution [1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mm KNO3, 2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, 40 mm BTP/Mes pH 6.4]. Membranes on which GST–AHA(1846–949) was spotted were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the same blocking solution with the addition of 1 µm PPI1588His6 and interaction was detected by immunodecoration with antiserum against the N‐terminus of PPI1. Membranes on which PPI1588His6 was spotted were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the same blocking solution with the addition of 1 µm GST–AHA(1846–949) and interaction was detected by immunodecoration with antiserum against the C‐terminus of the H+‐ATPase. The antiserum against the N‐terminus of PPI1 was raised in rabbit using His6PPI188 as antigene. Immunodecoration was performed by incubating the membrane for 2 h at room temperature with the antiserum diluted 1 : 1000 in 20 mMTris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween20. The antiserum against the C‐terminus of the H+‐ATPase was raised in rabbit using as antigene the highly conserved sequence Arg912–Tyr943 of A. thaliana proton pump isoform 2 (AHA2) conjugated to ovalbumin. Immunodecoration was performed by incubating the membrane for 2 h at room temperature with the antiserum diluted 1 : 1000 in 20 mMTris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween20. After several washes, signal detection was performed with an ECL anti‐rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1 : 5000 in the same solution reported above.  Unless otherwise specified, PM H+‐ATPase activity was assayed in 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mm KNO3, 2.3 mm MgSO4, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, 1 µg·mL−1 oligomycin, 100 µg·mL−1 Brij 58, 5 µm carbonyl cyanide p‐trifluromethoxy‐phenylhydrazone, buffered with 40 mm BTP‐Mes (pH 6.4–6.8) or BTP‐Hepes (pH 7–7.3), 2 units·mL−1 pyruvate kinase, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.3 mm ATP.  Plasma membranes (0.5–1 µg protein) were incubated at 0 °C for 15 min with or without the specified PPI1 fusion proteins in 90 µL of assay medium in absence of ATP, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate; all samples contained the same volume of 1 mm BTP‐Hepes pH 8.0, 10% glycerol. The volume was then adjusted to 100 µL with assay medium containing ATP, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate and the reaction was carried out for 60 min at 30 °C. Released Pi was determined as described in De Michelis and Spanswick [CITATION]. The PM H+‐ATPase activity was evaluated as the difference between total activity and that measured in the presence of 100 µm vanadate (less than 10% of total activity at pH 7; less than 5% of total activity at pH 6.4). Reported data are the results from one experiment with three replicates representative of at least three experiments; SE of the assays did not exceed 3% of the measured value.
