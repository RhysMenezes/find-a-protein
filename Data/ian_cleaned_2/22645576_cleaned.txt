!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis thaliana SFD1 (suppressor of fatty acid desaturase deficiency1) gene (also known as GLY1) is required for accumulation of 34:6 (i.e., 18:3–16:3) monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and for the activation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), an inducible defense mechanism that confers resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens. SFD1, which has been suggested to be involved in lipid-based signaling in SAR, contains a putative chloroplast transit peptide and has glycerol-3-phosphate synthesizing dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) reductase (also referred as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) activity. The goals of this study were to determine if the DHAP reductase activity and chloroplast localization are required for SFD1’s involvement in galactolipid metabolism and SAR signaling. The crystal structure of a Leishmania mexicana glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to model SFD1 structure and identify Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 as potential catalytic site residues in SFD1. Mutational analysis of SFD1 confirmed that Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 are critical for SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity, and its involvement in SAR. SFD1 proteins with these residues individually substituted by Ala lacked DHAP reductase activity and were unable to complement the SAR defect of the sfd1 mutant. The SFD1–Ala279 protein was also unable to restore 34:6-MGDG content when expressed in the sfd1 mutant. In vivo imaging of a green fluorescent protein-tagged SFD1 protein demonstrated that SFD1 is targeted to the chloroplast. The N-terminal 43 amino acids, which are required for proper targeting of SFD1 to the chloroplast, are also required for SFD1’s function in lipid metabolism and SAR. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity is required in the chloroplast for lipid metabolism and defense signaling.
!~RES~! Sequence alignment of the SFD1 protein to other known GPDHs predicted an NAD-dependent GPDH domain corresponding to amino acid residues 267–411 at the C-terminal half of SFD1, and an NAD-binding domain (residues 88–250) in the N-terminal half of the protein (Figure CITATIONA; Nandi et al., CITATION). A highly conserved NAD+/NADH-binding GxGxxG motif is present beginning at amino acid 94 (Figure CITATIONA). The crystal structure of the Leishmaniamexicana GPDH (LmGPDH) holo enzyme in complex with NADH revealed that amino acids Lys125, Lys210, and Asp263 of LmGPDH are in the vicinity of the nicotinamide moiety of NADH (Suresh et al., CITATION). Further study of a ternary complex involving LmGPDH with the substrate DHAP and the product NAD+ confirmed that amino acids Lys125, Ser155, Ala157, Lys210, Asn211, Asp263, Thr267, Ser273, Arg274, and Asn275 are part of the active site region (Suresh et al., CITATION; Choe et al., CITATION). Alignment of the LmGPDH sequence with the SFD1 amino acid sequence revealed that these amino acids are conserved in SFD1 and correspond to amino acids Lys194, Ser226, Ala228, Lys279, Asn280, Asp332, Thr336, Ser342, Arg343, and Asn344 in SFD1 (Figure CITATIONB). In LmGPDH, Lys125, and Lys210 have been shown to form H-bonds with the O-2 atom of DHAP, from which a proton is removed during the oxidation of G3P to DHAP. Furthermore, replacement of Lys125 and Lys210 with Ala or Met in LmGPDH disrupted its enzyme activity (Choe et al., CITATION). To further determine if Lys194 and Lys279 in SFD1 correspond to Lys125 and Lys210 of LmGPDH, a homology model was generated using SWISS-MODEL3, a protein modeling server (Arnold et al., CITATION), and the RasMol molecular graphics visualization tool4. Analysis of the derived model of the SFD1-WT protein indicated that the overall structure of SFD1 is similar to that of LmGPDH (Figure CITATION) and includes 17 helices, 12 strands, and 29 turns. Based on this model (Figure CITATION), SFD1 amino acids Lys194 and Lys279 are located in the same position as amino acids Lys125 and Lys210 in LmGPDH. This model also predicts that Asp332 in SFD1, which corresponds to Asp263 in LmGPDH, is adjacent to Lys194 and Lys279 (Figure CITATION) and thus is likely involved in SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity. Proposed structure of wild type and mutated SFD1 proteins based on the structure of a Leishmania mexicana G3P dehydrogenase. A ribbon model of the Leishmania mexicana 1EVYA GPDH enzyme based on its crystal structure is shown. The structure of the wild type SFD1 protein (SFD1-WT) and the SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 proteins in which residues Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 are replaced by Ala (denoted as beads), were modeled based on the structure of 1EVYA with the SWISS-MODEL and RasMol 2.7.4.2 www.rasmol.org softwares. To determine if Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 are critical for SFD1’s enzymatic activity, recombinant wild type, and mutant SFD1 proteins in which these amino acids were replaced by Ala were produced in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins had a His-tag at the C-terminal end, which facilitated their purification over a Ni-column. As shown in Figure CITATIONA, the WT and mutant SFD1 proteins exhibited the expected molecular mass of ∼45 kDa. SFD1-WT demonstrated DHAP reductase activity (Figure CITATIONB) with Michaelis–Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 0.33 μM for DHAP (Table CITATION). Apparent Vmax for SFD1-WT was 49 μmol mg−1 min−1 (Table CITATION). Replacement of any one of the three residues, Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 with Ala in the SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 recombinant constructs resulted in complete loss of SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity (Table CITATION). DHAP reductase activity of WT and mutant SFD1 protein. (A) Immunodetection of the recombinant SFD1 proteins with anti-His-tag antibody. (B) DHAP reductase activity of the purified recombinant SFD1-WT and SDF1Δ43 proteins. DHAP reductase activity was measured as the rate of decrease in A340 nm due to oxidation of NADH to NAD+. No activity was detected with the recombinant SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 proteins. (C) Functional complementation of an E. coli G3P auxotrophic mutant by WT and mutant SFD1 proteins. Growth of the E. coli DHAP reductase-deficient strain BB20-14 expressing the WT and mutant SFD1 constructs on minimal liquid M9 medium with or without 0.1% glycerol. The empty pET28c vector-transformed E. coli provided the negative control. Cell growth was determined by measuring the optical density at A600. G+, supplemented with glycerol; G−, without glycerol. DHAP reductase activity of WT and mutant SFD1 proteins. nd, No activity detected. Further confirmation of the importance of Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 for SFD1’s enzymatic activity was obtained by expressing the Ala-substituted mutant proteins and the SFD1-WT protein in the E. coli gpsA mutant strain BB20-14. This E. coli mutant lacks a GPDH activity resulting in G3P auxotrophy, which can be complemented by glycerol (Cronan and Bell, CITATION) and by the expression of SFD1 (Kachroo et al., CITATION; Nandi et al., CITATION). As shown in Figure CITATIONC, unlike the SFD-WT construct, the SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 mutant constructs were unable to complement the G3P auxotrophy of the E. coli gpsA mutant strain BB20-14. The Ala substitutions in SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 are predicted to not have any significant impact on the structure of SFD1 (Figure CITATION). Taken together the above results confirm that Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 are critical for SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity. To determine if SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity is required for its involvement in SAR, the SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 mutant constructs were expressed from the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S gene promoter in the sfd1-1 mutant background. Plants transformed with the SFD1-WT and empty vector provided the positive and negative controls, respectively, for these experiments. The WT accession Nössen and sfd1-1 mutant plant provided additional controls. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed that compared to the sfd1-1 mutant and sfd1-1 mutant plants transformed with the pMDC32 empty vector (Vect), the SFD1 transcript accumulated at high levels in transgenic plants with the wild type SFD1 (SFD1-WT) and SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 mutant constructs (Figure CITATIONA). To monitor SAR in these transgenics, a mix of plants derived from three independent transgenic lines for each construct were used. SAR was induced by inoculating (1° inoculation) three fully expanded lower leaves of each plant with a suspension (in 10 mM MgCl2) of an avirulent strain of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto–avrRpt2). Three days later, four upper leaves were challenged (2° inoculation) with P. syringae pv. maculicola (Pma), a virulent pathogen, and bacterial numbers in these Pma-inoculated leaves monitored 3 days post inoculation (3 dpi). Plants that received a 1° inoculation of 10 mM MgCl2 provided the negative control for comparing the extent of SAR-enhanced resistance to Pma. As shown in Figure CITATIONB, in the WT plant Pma numbers were significantly lower in the plants that received a 1° inoculation of Pto–avrRpt2 than in those that were treated with 10 mM MgCl2, indicating that SAR was activated. In contrast, as previously demonstrated (Nandi et al., CITATION; Chaturvedi et al., CITATION), SAR was not activated in the sfd1-1 mutant. Pma numbers were comparable in the upper leaves of the sfd1-1 mutant plants that were previously treated with 10 mM MgCl2 or Pto–avrRpt2. Like the sfd1-1 mutant and the empty vector (Vect) transformed sfd1-1 mutant plants, SAR was also not activated in transgenic plants transformed with the SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 mutant constructs, confirming that these amino acids, which are critical for SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity are also required for SFD1’s involvement in SAR. Systemic acquired resistance in sfd1-1 transgenic plants expressing the wild type and mutant SFD1. (A) RT-PCR analysis of the SFD1 transgene expression in leaves of the sfd1-1 mutant plants transformed with the empty pMDC32 vector (Vect), the wild type (SFD1-WT) and the SFD1Δ43, SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala279, and SFD1–Ala332 mutant constructs, and the SFD1–GFP and SFD1Δ43–GFP protein fusion expressing constructs. RNA extracted from non-transformed sfd1-1 mutant provided the negative control (−). The attR1-F plus a reverse primer (SFD-RCt) specific for the C-terminus of SFD1 were used for the PCR reaction to monitor expression of the SFD1 transgenes. This primer pair does not detect expression of the genomic SFD1. Expression of the ACTIN gene, ACT8, provided the control for RT-PCR. (B) SAR conferred resistance against P. syringae pv. maculicola in the wild type (WT) Arabidopsis accession Nössen plant, the sfd1-1 mutant, and sfd1-1 mutant plants transformed with the indicated constructs. SAR was induced by prior inoculation of a lower leaf with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 carrying the avrRpt2 avirulence gene (black bars). Plants similarly treated with 10 mM MgCl2 (white bars) provided the mock control for SAR. Three days after the primary inoculation the distal leaves were challenged with P. syringae pv. maculicola (Pma). Pma numbers were monitored 3 days post inoculation. Each bar represents the average colony forming units (CFU) of Pma ± SD in three samples each containing five leaf disks. An *indicates significant (P < 0.05) differences in bacterial numbers relative to the corresponding mock control. Expression of SFD1-WT also complemented the galactolipid defect of the sfd1-1 allele. As previously demonstrated and shown in Figures CITATIONA,B, the sfd1-1 mutation resulted in a reduction in the content of the plastid synthesized 34:6-MGDG. Furthermore, a corresponding increase in 36:6-MGDG, which is synthesized from DAG derived from the ER pathway, was also observed in the sfd1-1 mutant. To determine if the DHAP reductase activity of SFD1 is essential for its involvement in lipid metabolism, 34:6- and 36:6-MGDG content were compared between the SFD1-WT and SFD1–Ala279 transgenic plants. The WT and the sfd1-1 mutant provided additional controls. As shown in Figure CITATIONA, in comparison to the SFD1-WT plants, 34:6-MGDG content as a fraction of total MGDG was lower in the SFD1–Ala279 plant and 36:6-MGDG content was higher. The 34:6- and 36:6-MGDG contents in the SFD1–Ala279 plant were comparable to those in the sfd1-1 mutant plant, thus confirming that Lys279, and hence SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity is critical for its involvement in Arabidopsis lipid metabolism. 34:6- and 36:6-MGDG content in sfd1-1 transgenic plants expressing wild type and mutant SFD1. (A) 34:6- and 36:6-MGDG content in the wild type accession Nössen (WT), sfd1-1, and sfd1-1 transformed with the SFD1-WT and SFD1–Ala279 mis-sense mutant. (B) 34:6- and 36:6-MGDG content in the WT, sfd1-1, and sfd1-1 transformed with the empty pMDC32 vector (Vect) and the SFD1Δ43 construct. In (A,B), all values are the average (±SD) of five independent samples given as the fraction of 34:6- and 36:6-MGDG species relative to the total MGDG content. An *denotes significant (P < 0.05) differences relative to the WT. A **denotes significant (P < 0.05) differences relative to all other genotypes. As mentioned above and indicated in Figure CITATIONA, iPSORT predicts that SFD1 has at its N-terminus a chloroplast targeting sequence. Furthermore, proteomics studies have identified SFD1 in the envelope fraction of chloroplasts (Joyard et al., CITATION). We tested chloroplast localization of SFD1 in transgenic plants that expressed SFD1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP was fused to the last (carboxyl terminal) amino acid of SFD1. RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of the transgene in the SFD1–GFP plants (Figure CITATIONA). Expression of the SFD1–GFP fusion also complemented the SAR defect of the sfd1-1 mutant (Figure CITATIONA), confirming that the fusion protein was biologically functional. By comparison, expression of GFP alone was unable to complement the SAR defect of the sfd1-1 mutant. The GFP fluorescence (green) and red autofluorescence of chloroplasts was monitored in protoplasts isolated from the SFD1–GFP transformed sfd1-1 plants, and, as controls in protoplasts isolated from sfd1-1 plants expressing GFP and the non-transformed sfd1-1 plants. As shown in Figure CITATIONB, protoplasts derived from the SFD1–GFP transformed line exhibited a GFP fluorescence pattern that overlapped very well with the red autofluorescence of chloroplasts, confirming that SFD1–GFP fusion is localized to the chloroplast. By contrast, in protoplasts expressing GFP alone, strong green fluorescence was observed outside the chloroplasts. As expected, green fluorescence was not observed in protoplasts derived from the non-transformed sfd1-1 plants. The N-terminal 43 amino acids of SFD1 are required for targeting SFD1 to the chloroplast. (A) SAR conferred resistance against P. syringae pv. maculicola (Pma) in the wild type (WT) Arabidopsis accession Nössen plant, and in transgenic sfd1-1 mutant plants that express GFP or the SFD1–GFP and SFD1Δ43–GFP constructs in which the GFP coding sequence is fused in frame to the C-terminus of the SFD1 protein. Refer to legend to Figure CITATIONB on details for the induction of SAR. An *indicates significant (P < 0.05) differences in Pma numbers in plants that were previously treated with an avirulent pathogen (black bars) relative to plants that received a prior mock treatment (white bars). (B) The green fluorescence of GFP and red autofluorescence of chloroplasts were observed in protoplasts isolated from leaves of 4-week-old sfd1-1 mutant, and transgenic sfd1-1 mutant plants expressing GFP, SFD1–GFP, and SFD1Δ43–GFP. Merged images of green fluorescence of GFP and red autofluorescence of chloroplasts are also depicted. To determine if the N-terminus of SFD1, which contains the predicted chloroplast targeting sequence, is required for targeting SFD1 to the chloroplast, a SFD1Δ43–GFP construct was generated in which the N-terminal 43 amino acids of SFD1 were deleted and GFP was fused to the last (carboxyl terminal) amino acid of SFD1. RT-PCR confirmed that the SFD1Δ43–GFP construct was expressed in the transgenic plants (Figure CITATIONA). Protoplasts derived from transgenic sfd1-1 plants expressing the SFDΔ43–GFP construct were observed for GFP fluorescence pattern. As shown in Figure CITATIONB, the GFP fluorescence pattern of SFD1Δ43–GFP showed a punctate pattern that did not overlap with the red autofluorescence of chloroplasts, thus indicating that the N-terminal 43 amino acids are required for proper targeting of SFD1 to chloroplasts. The SFD1Δ43 protein expressed and purified from E. coli (Figure CITATIONA) exhibited DHAP reductase activity with an apparent Km of 0.2 μM for DHAP and Vmax of 41 μmol mg−1 min−1 (Figure CITATIONB; Table CITATION). In addition, this construct efficiently complemented the G3P auxotrophy of the E. coli gpsA mutant strain BB20-14 (Figure CITATIONC), thus indicating that the N-terminal 43 amino acids of SFD1 are not critical for its DHAP reductase activity. However, expression of SFD1Δ43 in transgenic plants did not complement the MGDG defect of the sfd1-1 mutant (Figure CITATIONB). Furthermore, SFD1Δ43 was unable to restore SAR in the sfd1-1 mutant background (Figure CITATIONB). Similarly, the SFD1Δ43–GFP fusion was unable to complement the SAR defect of sfd1-1 (Figure CITATIONA). Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal 43 amino acids, which are required for targeting SFD1 to chloroplasts, are critical for SFD1’s involvement in SAR and lipid metabolism.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown at 22°C in growth chambers/rooms programmed for 14 h light (100 μE m−2 s−1) and 10 h dark cycle in autoclaved peat-based planting mixture (Premier Pro Mix-PGX, Premier Tech Horticulture5). A suspension (107 cfu ml−1 in 10 mM MgCl2) of an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 carrying the avrRpt2 avirulence gene (Pto–avrRpt2) was infiltrated (1° inoculation) into three fully expanded leaves to activate SAR, as previously described (Chaturvedi et al., CITATION). 10 mM MgCl2-infiltrated plants provided the mock controls. Three days later, four upper leaves were challenged (2° inoculation) with a suspension (105 cfu ml−1) of the virulent pathogen P. syringae pv maculicola ES4326 (Pma). Three days after the 2° inoculation the Pma-inoculated leaves were harvested and bacterial counts in leaf disks (area = 0.28 cm2) determined as previously described (Chaturvedi et al., CITATION). A total of 15 leaf disks (three replications of five leaf disks in each sample) were analyzed for each treatment. DNA containing wild type, truncated and mutant versions of the SFD1 open reading frames were cloned in the pET28c vector (Novagen6) to generate SFD1-WT (full length), SDF1Δ43 (lacks DNA encoding the N-terminal 43 amino acids of SFD1), and SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala297, and SFD1–Ala332 in which Lys at amino acids 194 and 279, and Asp at 332 were replaced by Ala, respectively. The pET28c− SFD1-WT clone was generated by ligating the SFD1 cDNA from the plasmid U10925 (obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Ohio State University7) into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pET28c. Two sets of PCR reactions were set up in which the wild type SFD1 clone in pET28c (SFD1-WT) was used as a template to generate the SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala297, and SFD1–Ala332 mutant constructs. For construction of SFD1–Ala194 the first set of PCR reactions utilized the forward mutagenic primer SFD1-a1 and the T7-R primer (Table CITATION) to amplify SFD1 sequences 3′ to the region spanning amino acid 194. The second set of reactions involved the T7-F primer and the reverse mutagenic primer SFD1-a2 to amplify SFD1 sequences 5′ to the region spanning amino acid 194. Both reaction products were subsequently combined, diluted, and used as a template in a PCR reaction with the T7-F and T7-R primers. The resultant PCR product was treated with EcoRI and SalI (New England Biolabs8) and the digested amplicon cloned between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pET28c to yield pET28c− SFD1–Ala194. The SFD1–Ala297 and SFD1–Ala332 constructs were similarly made using the SFD1-b1 and SFD1-b2, and SFD1-c1 and SFD1-c2 mutant primers, respectively. To generate the pET28c− SDF1Δ43 construct, the PCR product derived with the SDF1Δ43-F1 and SDF1Δ43-R1 primers was first ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega9). The insert was subsequently excised with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the BamHI and SalI linearized pET28a vector. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and lack of any other unwanted alterations. The sequences of primers used in this study are provided in Table CITATION. Primers used in this study. To generate clones for expressing wild type and mutant versions of SFD1 in planta, the pET28c− SFD1-WT, pET28c− SFD1–Ala194, pET28c− SFD1–Ala279, and pET28c− SFD1–Ala332 vectors were used as templates in PCR reactions to amplify the SFD1-WT, SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala297, and SFD1–Ala332 DNA with the SFD1-F start and SFD1-R stop primers. To generate a clone for expressing SFD1Δ43 in planta, the pET28c− SFD1Δ43 plasmid was used as a template in PCR with the primers SFD1Δ43-F2 and SFD1Δ43-R2stop. The amplified products were cloned into pCR®8/GW/TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). The inserts in the resultant plasmids were fully sequenced and used for the LR recombination reaction with the destination vector pMDC32 (Invitrogen; Curtis and Grossniklaus, CITATION), which contains the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S gene promoter. To generate constructs expressing SFD1–GFP and SFD1Δ43–GFP in Arabidopsis, the pET28c− SFD1-WT and pET28c− SFD1Δ43 plasmids were used as templates in PCR reactions with the primer pairs SFD1-Fstart plus SFD1-RCt, and SFD1Δ43-F2 plus SFD1Δ43-R2Ct, respectively. The amplified products were cloned into the pCR®8/GW/TOPO® vector. The resultant plasmids were used in the LR recombination reaction with destination vector pMDC83, such that the GFP coding sequence in pMDC83 was fused in frame to the C-terminal amino acid of the SFD1 protein (Curtis and Grossniklaus, CITATION). The pMDC32 empty vector and pMDC83 empty vectors were obtained through LR reaction of pCR®8/GW/TOPO® empty vector with pMDC32 and pMDC83, respectively. pMDC32 and pMDC83 plasmids containing the desired inserts were electroporated into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Presence of the corresponding plasmids in the GV3101 transformants was confirmed by PCR. GV3101 transformants containing pMDC32 or pMDC83 with inserts of interest were used to transform sfd1-1 mutant plants by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION). Hygromycin resistant seeds were selected on MS agar plates supplemented with hygromycin (20 μg ml−1). Expression of the transgene was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Plants from three independently derived transgenic lines for each construct were mixed and used for SAR bioassays and lipid analysis. Leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted using an acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform mix (Chomczynski and Sacchi, CITATION). The isolated RNA was purified and used in the RT-PCR. The PCR primers for the ACT8 gene (At1g49240) were as previously described (Pegadaraju et al., CITATION). To confirm expression of the hygromycin resistance selection marker (data not shown) and the chimeric SFD1 transgenes, the RT step was followed by PCR with Hyg-F plus Hyg-R, and the attR1-F plus a reverse primer (SFD1-RCt) specific for the C-terminus of SFD1, respectively. Primer sequences can be found in Table CITATION. The PCR with the Hyg-F plus Hyg-R primers was performed with the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 45 s, 72°C for 1 min, with final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR with the attR1-F plus the SFD1-RCt primers was performed with the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s, 72°C for 1 min, with final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Leaves were cut from the 4-week-old transgenic plants and used for enzymatic protoplasts isolation. Protoplasts were prepared by incubating leaves at room temperature for 2 h in a solution containing 1% cellulase, 0.3% macerozyme, 0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM KCl, and 20 mM MES (pH 6.0). The protoplasts were washed with the protoplast storage buffer (0.5 M mannitol, 20 mM KCl, 4 mM MES pH 6.0) before analysis. GFP fluorescence and chloroplast autofluorescence were monitored using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M optical microscope connected with a Hamamatsu camera and Yokogawa Confocal Scanner Unit CSU10. Excitation wavelengths/emission filters were 488 nm/band-pass 505–535 nm for GFP and 488 nm/band-pass 672–712 nm for chloroplast autofluorescence. The entire system was controlled with Simple PCI software from Hamamatsu Corporation. A recombinant SFD1-WT, SDF1Δ43, and mis-sense mutant fusion proteins (SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala297, and SFD1–Ala332) containing a 6× His-tag were expressed from the pET28c vector in E. coli and then purified under native conditions over an affinity Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). E. coli strains BL21 containing (WT) and mutant SFD1 plasmids were cultured in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin at 37°C. Induction of SFD1 and mutant proteins expression was achieved by adding 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested and broken down through sonication. Induction of protein and further purification were performed according to suggested protocols (The QIAexpressionistTM, QIAGEN). The protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), with BSA used as a standard. The BL21 strain harboring the pET28c empty vector was cultured and treated in parallel as a control. To determine the pH optimum for SFD1, recombinant SFD1 protein was incubated at 30°C in a reaction mixture containing 0.16 mM NADH, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM DHAP in 100 mM HEPES buffer of varying pH. The final volume of the reaction mix was 500 μl. The pH optimum for SFD1’s DHAP reductase activity was determined to be 7.2. The assay was based on the DHAP-dependent oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and consisted of two stages. The background of NADH oxidation was first determined in reaction mixtures without DHAP, after which DHAP was added at 5–200 μM and the reductase activity measured. The activity measured was the rate of decrease in A340 due to oxidation of NADH to NAD+. For measuring the kinetic constants the reaction was conducted at pH 7.2. The GraphPad Prism 5 program was used to determine kinetic constants. The WT SFD1 protein retained DHAP reductase activity when kept overnight at room temperature. The enzyme was unstable if left at 4°C or lower temperature. Stability of the SFD1 protein was achieved by storage in 2 M glycerol and addition of 1 mM DTT. To reactivate the enzyme it was heated to 30°C for 10 min. Escherichia coli gpsA mutant strain BB20-14 (Cronan and Bell, CITATION) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. BB20-14 was maintained in M9 medium (Sambrook et al., CITATION) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 1 mM MgSO4, 100 μM CaCl2, and 1% glycerol (v/v). BB20-14 was transformed with empty pET28c vector and pET28c vectors containing cDNA of SFD1-WT, SDF1Δ43 and different mis-sense SFD1 versions. The transformation mix was plated on M9 agar supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg mL−1), 0.4% glucose, 1 mM MgSO4, 100 μM CaCl2 and 0.1% glycerol (v/v). Kanamycin-resistant colonies were inoculated into liquid M9 medium containing kanamycin (50 μg mL−1), 1 mM IPTG, 1 mM MgSO4, 100 μM CaCl2 with or without 0.1% glycerol. Bacteria were grown at 37°C for 2 days and the absorbance at A600 was determined. Lipids were extracted using the protocol available at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center website10 and analyzed by MS as previously described (Xiao et al., CITATION). Unfractionated lipid extracts were introduced by continuous infusion into the ESI source on a triple quadrupole MS/MS (API 4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at 30 μl/min. MGDG was detected as [M + NH4]+ in positive ion mode with Neutral Loss of 179.1. The lipids in each class were quantified in comparison to 2.01 nmol 16:0–18:0-MGDG and 0.39 nmol di18:0-MGDG internal standards.
