!~ABS~! Chloroplast division in plant cells is accomplished through the coordinated action of the tubulin-like FtsZ ring inside the organelle and the dynamin-like ARC5 ring outside the organelle. This coordination is facilitated by ARC6, an inner envelope protein required for both assembly of FtsZ and recruitment of ARC5. Recently, we showed that ARC6 specifies the mid-plastid positioning of the outer envelope proteins PDV1 and PDV2, which have parallel functions in dynamin recruitment. PDV2 positioning involves direct ARC6–PDV2 interaction, but PDV1 and ARC6 do not interact indicating that an additional factor functions downstream of ARC6 to position PDV1. Here, we show that PARC6 (paralog of ARC6), an ARC6-like protein unique to vascular plants, fulfills this role. Like ARC6, PARC6 is an inner envelope protein with its N-terminus exposed to the stroma and Arabidopsis parc6 mutants exhibit defects of chloroplast and FtsZ filament morphology. However, whereas ARC6 promotes FtsZ assembly, PARC6 appears to inhibit FtsZ assembly, suggesting that ARC6 and PARC6 function as antagonistic regulators of FtsZ dynamics. The FtsZ inhibitory activity of PARC6 may involve its interaction with the FtsZ-positioning factor ARC3. A PARC6–GFP fusion protein localizes both to the mid-plastid and to a single spot at one pole, reminiscent of the localization of ARC3, PDV1 and ARC5. Although PARC6 localizes PDV1, it is not required for PDV2 localization or ARC5 recruitment. Our findings indicate that PARC6, like ARC6, plays a role in coordinating the internal and external components of the chloroplast division complex, but that PARC6 has evolved distinct functions in the division process.
!~RES~! We identified PARC6 by BLAST (CITATION) shortly after the identification of ARC6 by a map-based approach (CITATION). The PARC6 locus (At3g19180) encodes a predicted protein product that shares ∼21% identity with Arabidopsis ARC6 and is predicted by ChloroP (CITATION) to bear a chloroplast transit peptide at its N-terminus (Figures 1a and S1 in Supporting Information). Consistent with this prediction, the N-terminus of PARC6 (amino acids (AA) 1–76) targets a YFP fusion protein to the chloroplast stroma in tobacco (Figure S2). [[FIGURE]] In contrast to ARC6, which contains one transmembrane helix that anchors it in the IEM (CITATION), Arabidopsis PARC6 has two predicted transmembrane domains (Figures 1a and S1) based on output from Aramemnon (CITATION). Multiple sequence alignment between PARC6, ARC6, and Ftn2 proteins from several organisms revealed two major regions of similarity, one near the N-terminus and the other near the C-terminus (Figures 1a and S1), suggesting that these regions of PARC6, ARC6, and Ftn2 may have related functions. Several small regions conserved within, and unique to, PARC6 family members were also evident upon close examination of the alignment (Figure S1); these regions may harbor functions that are specific to PARC6 proteins. Notably, the conserved proline that resides within the central motif of the predicted J-domain of most ARC6/Ftn2 family members (CITATION) (Figures 1a and S1) is not evident in PARC6 sequences, suggesting that PARC6 does not function as a DnaJ-like co-chaperone. While ARC6-like sequences are found in cyanobacteria, algae, and mosses, PARC6 sequences have only been detected in vascular plants (tracheophytes), suggesting that PARC6 emerged as a chloroplast division factor in this group of organisms. Consistent with this observation, phylogenetic analysis shows that PARC6 and ARC6 sequences from tracheophytes cluster into distinct clades and that both of these proteins may have diverged from a common ARC6-like ancestor (Figure 1b). As postulated previously (CITATION), ARC6 is more closely related to cyanobacterial Ftn2 than is PARC6 (Figure 1a,b), suggesting that ARC6 and Ftn2 share greater functional similarity than PARC6 and Ftn2. These results, in combination with the sequence similarities and differences highlighted above, suggest that PARC6 arose as a result of gene duplication and divergence in primitive vascular plants and that it has probably evolved functions distinct from those of ARC6 within the tracheophyte lineage. The similarity of PARC6 to ARC6 led us to investigate its role in plastid division. We identified a T-DNA insertion (SALK_100009) in the first exon of PARC6 (parc6-1; Figure 2a) and characterized homozygous lines for chloroplast morphology and number (Figure 2c). [[FIGURE]] parc6-1 mutants are less drastically impaired in chloroplast division than arc6 mutants (compare Figure 2c, f), but mesophyll cells in parc6-1 mutants contain nearly 10-fold fewer chloroplasts (6.7 ± 2.4 chloroplasts per cell, n = 15 cells) than those in wild type (59.7 ± 11.2 chloroplasts per cell, n = 15 cells). parc6-1 mesophyll cell chloroplasts possess characteristics of chloroplasts in both arc3 and arc5 mutants (CITATION). Like arc3 mutants, parc6-1 mutants exhibit a heterogeneous mixture of chloroplast sizes within individual cells (Pyke and Leech, 1992, 1994; CITATION) (Figure 2c). Like arc5 mutants, parc6-1 mutants have some chloroplasts with prevalent constrictions (Figure 2c, arrowheads), suggesting a block in dynamin (ARC5) function (CITATION; CITATION). We also identified two additional alleles of PARC6, parc6-2 and parc6-3, in a forward genetic screen (Figure 2d, e). These alleles confer phenotypes similar to those in parc6-1. parc6-2 behaves as a dominant-negative mutation while parc6-1 and parc6-3 are recessive to the wild-type allele. These phenotypes show that PARC6 is a bona fide plastid division protein and suggest that PARC6 could influence operation of the division machinery through ARC3, ARC5, or the ARC5 recruitment factors PDV1 and PDV2. To examine the subcellular localization of PARC6, we generated a transgene encoding PARC6 fused to GFP expressed under control of the CaMV 35S promoter (35S:PARC6–GFP). This transgene was capable of complementing the division defect in parc6-1 mutants (Figure S3), indicating that it generates a functional protein product. Following selection of T2 individuals, we examined epidermal cells in young leaves for expression of the fusion protein. PARC6–GFP localized to the middle of ovoid, partially constricted, and deeply constricted plastids (Figure 3a, b), though whether it formed a complete ring during the early stages of division was not clear as the GFP signal in these plastids was very weak. The GFP signal was most evident in deeply constricted plastids as single foci (Figure 3b), suggesting concentration of the fusion protein at the isthmus connecting plastids just prior to their separation. In some plastids, PARC6-GFP was localized at the organelle surface in a single spot at one pole (Figure 3c), perhaps representing the persistence of the fusion protein at the pole following separation of the daughter plastids. A similar pattern of localization has been observed in Arabidopsis for both PDV1 and ARC5 (CITATION), but not for ARC6 or PDV2 (CITATION; CITATION), though ARC6–YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) localized to a punctate ring when expressed transiently in tobacco (CITATION). In addition, we observed both polar and medial localization of PARC6–YFP at the chloroplast periphery in transiently transfected tobacco leaf cells (Figure S4), reminiscent of ARC3 localization in similar experiments (CITATION). In tobacco, dual localization in the same plastid may be a consequence of overexpression as we did not observe both medial and polar localization in the same plastid in Arabidopsis parc6-1 mutants complemented with the PARC6–GFP transgene (Figure 3a–c). In both Arabidopsis and tobacco, PARC6–GFP was associated with the periphery of the chloroplast (Figures 3 and S4), suggesting it is localized in the envelope membrane. [[FIGURE]] To verify that PARC6 is an envelope membrane protein, we examined the fractionation of native PARC6 protein in isolated pea chloroplasts using an antibody generated against the region of Arabidopsis PARC6 residing between the transit peptide and the first predicted transmembrane domain (AA 77–356, Figure 1a). The antibody detected a protein migrating at ∼116 kDa in whole-cell extracts from pea (Figure 3d, lane 1) and a competition assay in which the antibody was pre-incubated with the immunizing antigen confirmed that this protein is native pea PARC6 (Figures 3d and S5). This protein was enriched in fractions containing isolated intact chloroplasts (Figure 3d, lane 2) and chloroplast membrane fractions (Figure 3d, lane 3), suggesting that PARC6 is a chloroplast envelope protein. To more precisely define PARC6 localization and investigate its topology, we carried out protease protection assays with isolated intact pea chloroplasts to assess the susceptibility of native PARC6 to the proteases thermolysin, which does not penetrate the outer envelope, and trypsin, which enters the IMS (CITATION). In untreated chloroplasts, PARC6 was enriched in the membrane fraction (Figure 3e, left panel). Following treatment of chloroplasts with thermolysin, PARC6 remained intact (Figure 3e, middle panel) and associated with the membrane fraction (Figure 3e, middle panel). Treatment of chloroplasts with trypsin resulted in a complete loss of the signal corresponding to the full-length PARC6 protein and the appearance in the membrane fraction of a smaller PARC6-derived fragment migrating at ∼40 kDa (Figure 3e, right panel, arrowhead). The susceptibility of pea PARC6 to trypsin but not thermolysin suggests that PARC6 resides in the IEM. The mass of this fragment and its recognition by the antibody, along with the presence of an N-terminal transit peptide (Figures 1 and S2) and the homology between ARC6 and PARC6 (Figures 1 and S1), are consistent with a topology placing the N-terminus of PARC6 in the stroma. However, these data do not indicate the location of the C-terminus of the protein, as our PARC6 antibody only recognizes the N-terminus of PARC6. Based on the strong transmembrane prediction of Arabidopsis PARC6 AA 574–596 (TM2, Figure 1a), we suspect that the C-terminus of PARC6 also resides within the chloroplast stroma, with the middle region looping into the IMS. However, because Arabidopsis PARC6 has been recalcitrant to in vitro translation, we have been unable to perform in vitro chloroplast import and fractionation studies like those used to define ARC6 topology (CITATION); such experiments will be necessary to confirm this preliminary PARC6 topology. Based on the combination of in vivo localization and in vitro topological data, we conclude that PARC6 localization is distinct from that of ARC6, consistent with a unique role for PARC6 in chloroplast division. Because ARC6 acts as a positive regulator of FtsZ assembly (CITATION), we examined the organization of FtsZ in homozygous parc6-1 mutants by immunostaining to determine if PARC6 also affects FtsZ assembly in vivo. In contrast to the short FtsZ filaments observed in the enlarged chloroplasts of arc6 mutants (CITATION), we observed long FtsZ filaments that appeared to be multiple rings or spirals within the larger chloroplasts of parc6-1 (Figures 4b and S6). The elongated FtsZ filaments observed in parc6-1 were not due to a change in FtsZ1 or FtsZ2 levels, which were similar to those in the wild type (Figure S7). Additionally, we observed tubular chloroplasts containing clusters of FtsZ rings (Figure 4c, arrowheads), reminiscent of the multiple Z-rings observed in arc3 mutants (CITATION). These results suggest that PARC6 might act as an antagonist of ARC6, with PARC6 inhibiting FtsZ assembly, and also implicate PARC6 in the functioning of the plastidic Min system (CITATION; Fujiwara et al., 2004, 2008; CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] The effect of PARC6 depletion on Z-ring morphology led us to test for interaction between the putative N-terminal stromal region of PARC6 (AA 77–356) and both families of Arabidopsis FtsZ using two-hybrid assays. However, neither FtsZ1 nor FtsZ2 interacted with PARC6 (Figure 4e). This result was somewhat surprising given the high affinity of ARC6 for FtsZ2 (CITATION). Based on the heterogeneity in chloroplast size in parc6-1 (this study) and arc3 mutants (Pyke and Leech, 1992, 1994; CITATION), the effect of PARC6 on FtsZ ring and filament morphology (Figure 4c), and the ARC3-like localization of PARC6 in tobacco (Figure S4) (CITATION), we decided to test for interaction between PARC6 and ARC3 by two-hybrid assay. In contrast to ARC6 (CITATION), the N-terminus of PARC6 interacted strongly and specifically with the predicted mature ARC3 protein (Figure 4d,f). Interestingly, the PARC6–ARC3 interaction requires the membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) domain (CITATION) (Figure 4d,f), a region of ARC3 that was shown previously to inhibit a specific interaction between ARC3 and FtsZ1 (CITATION). To investigate the functional relationship between ARC6 and PARC6, we generated parc6arc6 double mutants and compared their phenotypes with those of both parental mutants and wild-type plants (Figure 5a–d). parc6arc6 plants (Figure 5d) possess mesophyll chloroplast phenotypes that are more like those of arc6 mutants (Figures 5c and 2f) than parc6 mutants (Figures 5b and 2c), suggesting that PARC6 acts downstream of ARC6 during chloroplast division. [[FIGURE]] If PARC6 acts downstream of ARC6, we expected that ARC6–GFP should localize normally to chloroplast constriction sites in parc6 mutants. To test this, we examined ARC6–GFP localization in Col-0 and parc6 mutants using a Pro-ARC6:ARC6–GFP transgene that was used previously to examine ARC6 localization in Arabidopsis (CITATION). Consistent with ARC6 acting upstream of PARC6, we observed localization of ARC6–GFP to sites of constriction in young leaf cells of both wild-type (Figure 5e) and parc6 mutants (Figure 5f). From these data, we conclude that PARC6 acts downstream of ARC6 and that PARC6 is not required for localization of ARC6 to sites of chloroplast constriction. We previously reported that ARC6 interacts directly with PDV2 and positions PDV2 at the division site (CITATION). We also showed that ARC6 is required for equatorial positioning of GFP–PDV1, though direct interaction between ARC6 and PDV1 could not be detected. Consequently, we hypothesized the presence of at least one factor that acts as an intermediary between ARC6 and PDV1. To test whether PARC6 is required for PDV1 localization, we examined GFP–PDV1 localization (CITATION) in Col-0 and parc6-1 mutants. We were unable to observe any GFP–PDV1 signal at sites of chloroplast constriction in parc6-1 mutants (Figure 6b), though GFP–PDV1 localized properly to dividing chloroplasts in the wild type (Figure 6a), was expressed in both wild-type and parc6-1 backgrounds based on immunoblotting (Figure S8), and can functionally complement the pdv1 mutant (CITATION). Taken together, the PDV1-like localization of PARC6 in Arabidopsis (Figure 3a–c) and the loss of PDV1 localization in parc6 mutants (Figure 6b) indicate a major role for PARC6 in positioning PDV1 at the division site. [[FIGURE]] Consistent with PARC6 acting downstream of ARC6 (Figure 5a–f) and ARC6-dependent positioning of PDV2 (CITATION), we observed YFP–PDV2 at sites of chloroplast constriction in parc6-1 mutants as well as in the wild type (Figure 6c,d). Further, in agreement with our previous finding that either PDV1 or PDV2 are capable of recruiting ARC5 to the division site (CITATION), we also observed GFP–ARC5 positioned correctly in parc6 mutants despite loss of PDV1 positioning (Figure 6e,f). If PARC6 and ARC6 are responsible for positioning PDV1 and PDV2, respectively, at the division site, we predicted that PDV1 and PDV2 should localize independently of each other. To confirm this, we expressed GFP–PDV1 in pdv2-1 mutants and YFP–PDV2 in pdv1-1 mutants. GFP-PDV1 localized to the mid-plastid in the pdv2-1 background (Figure 7b), indicating that PDV2 is not required for PDV1 localization. Similarly, YFP–PDV2 localized to the mid-plastid in the pdv1-1 background (Figure 7d). We conclude that PDV1 and PDV2 localize to the division site independently of one another – PDV1 through PARC6 and PDV2 through ARC6. [[FIGURE]]

Evolutionary history (Figure 1b) was inferred by neighbor-joining (CITATION) following multiple sequence alignment (Figure S1) with MEGA4 (CITATION) using an identity matrix. The bootstrap consensus-tree inferred from 1000 replicates represents the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (CITATION). Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in fewer than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches (CITATION). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method (CITATION) and are given as the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option). There were 441 positions in the final dataset. Tissue preparation was carried out as described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Quantitative analysis of Col-0 and parc6-1 phenotypes was performed using the distal 3–4 mm of the largest leaf present on plants 30 days after sowing. 35S:PARC6TP–YFP and 35S:PARC6–YFP constructs were made using the Gateway System (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/). PARC6 cDNA was used as a template for PCR. The transit peptide of PARC6 (PARC6TP) or the full-length PARC6 coding sequence were amplified using primers PARC6-1 and PARC6-2, and PARC6-1 and PARC6-3 (Figure S9), respectively, and cloned into pDONR207 by BP reaction. 35S:PARC6TP–YFP and 35S:PARC6–YFP constructs were generated by LR reactions of the respective entry clones with the binary destination vector pDest-35S-X-YFP-6 × His (a gift from the J. Hu Laboratory, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA). Microscopy was performed using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 Confocal microscope (http://www.olympus.com/). For localization of PARC6 in Arabidopsis, a genomic PARC6 sequence was amplified from Col-0 using PARC6-9 and PARC6-10 (Figure S9), cloned into a SmaI site within pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com/). The insert was excised with BamHI and cloned into a BglII site within pCAMBIA1302 (CITATION). This vector was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciensGV3101 and the plants were transformed by floral dipping (CITATION). Transgenic individuals were selected as described previously (CITATION). For visualization of PARC6–GFP, T2 seed was selected and GFP fluorescence in surviving 14-day-old plants was assessed in young expanding leaves using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a 60 × /1.2 water immersion objective, a GFP filter set (Ex 450–490, Em 500–550), and a QImaging Rolera-XR cooled CCD camera. Image acquisition was controlled by Micro-Manager version 1.33 (http://www.micro-manager.org/). The coding sequence for the N-terminus of mature PARC6 (PARC6 AA77–357) was cloned into pHIS9 (CITATION) and His-tagged protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta DE3 (Novagen, http://www.emdbiosciences.com/html/NVG/home.html). The insoluble recombinant protein was solubilized with 6M urea and purified using Ni-agarose. Subsequent SDS-PAGE removed urea and purified the antigen. After brief Coomassie-blue staining, the antigen was excised from the gel and rabbit antibodies for PARC6 were generated by Covance Research Products, Inc. (http://www.covance.com/). Exsaguination serum was used at 1:5000 for immunoblotting. Two and a half microliters of anti-PARC6 serum was incubated with 500 μl of cell lysate expressing antigen (Figure S5, left) or the empty vector (Figure S5, right) at room temperature for 4 h. After a 5-min centrifugation at 16 000 g, supernatant was recovered and diluted 1:25 in 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3,propanediol (TRIS)-buffered saline (TBS) prior to immunoblotting. Pea chloroplast isolation and fractionation into membrane and soluble fractions was performed as described previously (CITATION). Trypsin digestion of intact chloroplasts was performed as described (CITATION), except 25 μl of 1 μg μl−1 trypsin was used, and 50 μl of 1 μg μl−1 trypsin inhibitor was used to quench trypsin activity. Thermolysin digestion of intact chloroplasts was performed in a similar way to trypsin digestion, except 5 mm CaCl2 was used to quench thermolysin activity. Tissue preparation, fixation, and immunofluorescence analysis were carried out as described previously (Vitha et al., 2001, 2003; CITATION). pGADT7 and pGBKT7 were used for two-hybrid analysis (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/). Primers used for cloning are shown in Figure S9. PARC677–356 was generated using PARC6-4 and PARC6-5, using a PARC6 cDNA template that was generated by RT-PCR. This product was cloned into pGADT7 using NdeI and NotI. The FtsZ1-1 two-hybrid clone was generated using primers FtsZ1-1a and FtsZ1-1b from an FtsZ1-1 cDNA (AY113896). This product was cloned into pGBKT7 using NdeI and NcoI. The FtsZ2-1 two-hybrid clone was generated using FtsZ2-1a and FtsZ2-1b from an FtsZ2-1 cDNA (AF089738). This product was cloned into pGBKT7 using NdeI and NcoI. ARC3 PCR product representing the mature protein-coding sequence was generated using ARC3-1 and ARC3-2 from ARC3 cDNA. This was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, http://www.promega.com/) and transferred to pGBKT7 using NdeI and BamHI sites for placement in pGBKT7. ARC3-MORN product representing the mature protein-coding sequence lacking the MORN domain was generated using ARC3-1 and ARC3-3 (Figure S9) from an ARC3 cDNA. This product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy and transferred to pGBKT7 using NdeI and BamHI. HIS3 reporter assays were performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). arc6-1 was crossed to parc6-1 and parc6 arc6 double mutants were identified by genotype. SALK genotyping primers PARC6-6, PARC6-7, and PARC6-8 were used as described (CITATION) for identifying homozygous parc6-1 plants (Figure S9). An NlaIII-containing derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker (CITATION) was used to identify the arc6-1 mutation using ARC6-1 and ARC6-2. The product generated from these two primers harbors an additional NlaIII site when arc6-1 genomic DNA is amplified. Lines homozygous for both mutations were used for double mutant analysis. Transgenes for Pro-ARC6:ARC6-GFP, Pro-PDV1:GFP-PDV1, Pro-PDV2:YFP-PDV2, and Pro-ARC5:GFP-ARC5 were introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Following selection of T1 individuals, young leaves of transgenic plants were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Flower buds were collected from lines shown in Figure 6(a, b), ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen, and boiled in sample buffer. Protein extract from 2.5 mg of ground tissue was loaded for SDS–PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Genie Apparatus (Idea Scientific, http://www.ideascientific.com/). The membrane was dried and Ponceau-stained before probing with JL-8 anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) at 1:1000 dilution in TBS-T blocking buffer containing 4% non-fat dry milk. Whole-cell extracts for anti-FtsZ1-1 and anti-FtsZ2-1 immunoblots (Figure S7) were prepared by grinding tissue from 11-day-old plate-grown plants in liquid nitrogen. The resulting powder was homogenized in five volumes of Extraction Buffer (25 mm TRIS, pH 7.4 containing 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). An equal amount of loading buffer was added to this homogenate before boiling. Four microliters of each sample was loaded for SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with FtsZ1-1 or FtsZ2-1 antibodies at 1:15000 in 5% blocking buffer.
