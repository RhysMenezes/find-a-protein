!~ABS~! Amino acids serve as transport forms for organic nitrogen in the plant, and multiple transport steps are involved in cellular import and export. While the nature of the export mechanism is unknown, overexpression of GLUTAMINE DUMPER1 (GDU1) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) led to increased amino acid export. To gain insight into GDU1’s role, we searched for ethyl-methanesulfonate suppressor mutants and performed yeast-two-hybrid screens. Both methods uncovered the same gene, LOSS OF GDU2 (LOG2), which encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. The interaction between LOG2 and GDU1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down, in vitro ubiquitination, and in planta coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation indicated that LOG2 and GDU1 both localized to membranes and were enriched at the plasma membrane. LOG2 expression overlapped with GDU1 in the xylem and phloem tissues of Arabidopsis. The GDU1 protein encoded by the previously characterized intragenic suppressor mutant log1-1, with an arginine in place of a conserved glycine, failed to interact in the multiple assays, suggesting that the Gdu1D phenotype requires the interaction of GDU1 with LOG2. This hypothesis was supported by suppression of the Gdu1D phenotype after reduction of LOG2 expression using either artificial microRNAs or a LOG2 T-DNA insertion. Altogether, in accordance with the emerging bulk of data showing membrane protein regulation via ubiquitination, these data suggest that the interaction of GDU1 and the ubiquitin ligase LOG2 plays a significant role in the regulation of amino acid export from plant cells.
!~RES~! The physiological consequences of GDU1 overexpression have been studied extensively, but the mechanism by which GDU1 activates amino acid efflux remains unclear. GDU1 is unlikely to be a transporter; thus, it must interact with other proteins to activate efflux. A screen for interacting proteins was performed using a yeast two-hybrid strategy, in which the region C terminal to the putative transmembrane domain of GDU1 (cGDU1; amino acids 61–158) was used as bait against an Arabidopsis cDNA library. Three clones, whose inserts contained partial open reading frames of genes At3g09770 and At5g03200 (Supplemental Fig. S1, A and C), were shown to restore yeast prototrophy when coexpressed with cGDU1 in the yeast two-hybrid screen. At3g09770 and At5g03200 encode members of the same subfamily of RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligases (CITATION; CITATION). At3g09770 and At5g03200 were named LOG2 (see below) and LOG2-LIKE UBIQUITIN LIGASE1 (LUL1), respectively. The three other paralogs were designated LUL2 (At3g53410), LUL3 (At5g19080), and LUL4 (At3g06140). Full-length LOG2 and LUL1 also interacted with cGDU1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A). Yeast coexpressing LUL1 and cGDU1 grew slower than yeast coexpressing LOG2 and cGDU1, while the proteins were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). This observation was consistent with the activity of the lacZ reporter gene. β-Galactosidase activity of yeast cells was 0.14 ± 0.13 nmol o-nitro phenol (ONP) h−1 0.10−7 cells when cGDU1 was coexpressed with LUL1 and 3.02 ± 0.18 nmol ONP h−1 0.10−7 cells when coexpressed with LOG2, suggesting that the interaction between cGDU1 with LUL1 was weaker compared with that of LOG2. [[FIGURE]] In addition to the presence of a C-terminal C3HC4 RING finger domain and a predicted N-terminal myristoylation site (see below), the five LOG2 subfamily members contain a functionally uncharacterized region N terminal to the RING finger that was previously designated Domain Associated with RING2 (DAR2; Supplemental Fig. S1C; CITATION). LOG2-like genes are present in the genomes of diverse taxa, including monocots, lower plants, and mammals, but surprisingly not in fungi. While LOG2 function has not been studied in plants, the mammalian homolog MAHOGUNIN RING FINGER1 (MGRN1) plays an unclear role in the down-regulation of melanocortin signaling and the maturation of endosomes (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). MGRN1 contains a large C-terminal domain not found in plant LOG2/LUL proteins (Supplemental Fig. S1C) that seems to play an important role in endosomal trafficking (CITATION), suggesting divergence in function from plant LOG2/LULs. The interaction of cGDU1 with LOG2 and LUL1 was tested by glutathione S-transferase (GST) in vitro pull-down assays. The interaction of GST-LOG2 with cGDU1 was the only one to be detected (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 2), indicating that cGDU1 binds directly to LOG2 and more strongly to LOG2 than to LUL1 in this assay. The interaction between GDU1 and LOG2 was then tested in planta using proteins transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Wild-type LOG2 was expressed at levels too low to be suitable for coimmunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Hypothesizing that autoubiquitination may contribute to protein instability, we generated a LOG2 mutant with a catalytically inactive RING domain (LOG2CC354+357AA, called mLOG2; see below and Fig. 2C), which could successfully be expressed at high levels. Full-length GDU1 and mLOG2 with C-terminal Myc or hemagglutinin (HA) tags were then coexpressed in N. benthamiana leaves, and the Myc-fused protein was immunoprecipitated. Independent of which protein contained the Myc epitope tag, GDU1 and mLOG2 coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 3), showing that the interactions detected by yeast two-hybrid and in vitro assays are observed in planta as well. It had previously been reported that the EMS-generated log1-1 mutant, corresponding to a G100R substitution in the VIMAG motif of GDU1, suppresses multiple features of the Gdu1D phenotype (CITATION, CITATION). Although the C-terminal domains of the seven Arabidopsis GDUs show limited sequence conservation outside the VIMAG domain, all cGDUs could interact with LOG2 in yeast, and most could interact with LUL1 (Fig. 1A). This suggested that the interaction with LOG2 is mediated through the VIMAG domain. To test the hypothesis that the G100R mutation alters the interaction with LOG2, the interactions of cGDU1G100R (log1-1) and Δ-cGDU1 (in which the whole VIMAG domain has been deleted) with LOG2 and LULs were tested using the yeast two-hybrid system. While these mutations did not alter protein abundance (data not shown), neither log1-1 nor Δ-cGDU1 could interact with LOG2 or LUL1 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these results, flag-tagged cGDU1G100R failed to interact with GST-LOG2 in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1B, lane 5), and coimmunoprecipitation of GDU1G100R and mLOG2 expressed in N. benthamiana was greatly reduced (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). These data indicate that the GDU1-LOG2 interaction requires the conserved VIMAG domain of GDU1 and that the suppression of the Gdu1D phenotype observed in log1-1 plants (CITATION) may result from the loss of interaction with LOG2. To systematically characterize interactions between the LOG2/LUL and GDU families, yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted between the C-terminal domains of all Arabidopsis GDUs and LOG2/LUL proteins. In contrast to LOG2, cGDU-LUL interactions were typically specific for a pair of bait-prey combinations (Fig. 1A). LUL2 and LUL3 interactions were observed only for cGDU2 or cGDU3, and LUL4 did not interact with any cGDU. As expected, deletion of the VIMAG motif from cGDU1 abolished all LUL interactions. The interaction between GDU and LOG2-like proteins appears to be facilitated by the VIMAG motif of the GDUs and a conserved domain among LOG2 homologs (most likely DAR2; see below). LOG2 had previously been shown to polymerize ubiquitin in vitro (CITATION). To examine the E3 activities of the LOG2 paralogs, GST fusions of LOG2 and LUL1 to -4 were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and assayed with ubiquitin pathway proteins (E2, E1, and ubiquitin). Mirroring previously published results with LOG2 (CITATION; CITATION), LUL1 to -4 were active, forming high-Mr ubiquitinated proteins in the presence of all ubiquitin pathway components, while omission of the E2 prevented their production (Fig. 2A). [[FIGURE]] Only the proteins demonstrated to interact with GDU1 (i.e. LOG2 and LUL1 [Fig. 1]) were tested for ubiquitination of cGDU1 using in vitro assays. Only LOG2 could ubiquitinate cGDU1 above the background of the E3 reaction (Fig. 2B). Substitution to Ala of two zinc-coordinating Cys residues (mLOG2) or an Ile residue in the RING domain (LOG2I321A) was previously described for other RING E3s to abolish E3 activity or hinder association with E2s, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). As predicted, these modifications of LOG2 led to abolished or compromised cGDU1 ubiquitination, respectively (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, truncation of the nonconserved 125-amino acid region N terminal to DAR2 did not impede cGDU1 ubiquitination by LOG2 (Fig. 2C). cGDU1G100R (log1-1) was then assayed with or without LOG2-V5-His6 in the presence of ubiquitin pathway components. While cGDU1 formed ladders in the presence of LOG2, only weak monoubiquitination of cGDU1G100R was observed (Fig. 2D). These data show that the decreased interaction of cGDU1G100R with LOG2 (Fig. 1B) results in decreased in vitro ubiquitination of cGDU1G100R and suggest that the specificity determinants of the GDU1-LOG2 interaction lie in the DAR2 of LOG2. The interaction between GDU1 and LOG2, confirmed so far in vitro and after coexpression in planta, is physiologically relevant only if the two proteins are expressed in the same cell types. To investigate LOG2 expression pattern, the LOG2 promoter region fused to the coding sequence of the uidA gene from E. coli, encoding GUS, was introduced into the Arabidopsis genome. GUS activity was detected in vascular tissues of roots, leaves, and stems (Fig. 3, A–D), and more precisely in both phloem and xylem parenchyma cells, as revealed by stem cross-sections (Fig. 3C). The LOG2 promoter was active in all shoot cells: a light background staining appeared in leaves and in nonvascular parenchyma cells of the stems (Fig. 3, A and C). Examination of lightly stained plants showed that this background staining did not result from diffusion of the product of the histochemical reaction out of the vascular tissues (data not shown). The presence of staining in roots up to the division zone indicated that the LOG2 promoter is active in the root phloem (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the LOG2 promoter was only active in cells from the root stele and root tip; even with longer reaction time, no staining could be observed in the cortex and epidermis (Fig. 3, D and E). In reproductive organs, strong GUS activity was detected in the style, connective tissue, and the base of the flower (Fig. 3, F and G), which persisted along the development of the silique (data not shown). Finally, the LOG2 promoter was active in pollen grains (Fig. 3H). The observed expression pattern is in good agreement with quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results (Supplemental Fig. S2), the AtGenExpress data set (CITATION), and the Arabidopsis Gene Expression Database (CITATION), where stronger expression was detected in vasculature-rich tissues (stems), pollen, columella, and phloem and xylem cells (data not shown). The expression pattern of LOG2 largely overlaps with that of GDU1, shown to be expressed in the vasculature of roots, stems, and petioles (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] GDU1 is predicted to be a single-pass transmembrane domain protein (CITATION). In order to interact with GDU1, LOG2 needs to be recruited to the same membrane(s). Confocal imaging of Arabidopsis protoplasts transiently expressing GDU1-GFP had suggested that GDU1 was targeted to the plasma membrane (CITATION). We created transgenic Arabidopsis that overexpressed Myc-tagged GDU1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. One line, designated 35S-GDU1-Myc, showed stable expression of GDU1-Myc over several generations and recapitulated the smaller leaf size and overaccumulation of amino acids seen in the activation-tagged gdu1-1D line (Supplemental Fig. S3; Supplemental Table S1). To examine the subcellular localization of GDU1, rosette leaf proteins were fractionated into cytosolic and total microsome fractions, after which total microsomes were further processed into plasma membrane-depleted vesicles (PDVs) and plasma membrane-enriched vesicles (PEVs). GDU1-Myc was highly enriched in the microsomal fraction compared with the soluble fraction, confirming membrane localization (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Similar to the plasma membrane-localized PMA2 used as a control (CITATION; CITATION), GDU1 was enriched in PEVs compared with PDVs (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating enrichment at the plasma membrane. Consistent with these results, GDU1-GFP transiently expressed in N. benthamiana epidermal cells localized at the plasma membrane and in small dots (Fig. 5A), which could be labeled with the endosome marker FYVE-GFP (CITATION; Fig. 5B). Limited overlap was found with fluorescent markers specific to the Golgi apparatus, and no localization could be detected in mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, or the cytosol (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To explore the membrane association of GDU1, microsomes from 35S-GDU1-Myc leaves were isolated and treated with NaCl, alkaline sodium carbonate, or Triton X-100 detergent (i.e. reagents that extract peripheral, lumenal, or integral membrane proteins, respectively; CITATION; CITATION). GDU1 was retained in the microsomal pellet after incubation with salt or base, whereas it was solubilized by the detergent (Fig. 4B). In accordance with earlier characterizations of protein-membrane interactions (CITATION; CITATION), this result indicates that GDU1 is an integral membrane protein. LOG2 was found to interact directly with cGDU1 in vitro (Fig. 1B) and to coimmunoprecipitate with GDU1 in planta (Fig. 1C), but unlike GDU1, LOG2 lacks a predicted transmembrane domain. To determine whether LOG2 is membrane associated, microsomes, PDVs, and PEVs were prepared from Arabidopsis stably expressing LOG2-HA under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. 4C) or after transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves (Fig. 4D, left). Mirroring the localization profile of GDU1, LOG2 was found primarily in the total microsomal fraction and enriched in PEVs. In accordance with these data, expression in N. benthamiana epidermal cells of LOG2-GFP led to a continuous fluorescence at the cell periphery, suggesting plasma membrane localization (Fig. 5C, left). This pattern was identical to the pattern obtained with BRI1, a known plasma membrane protein (CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S4). Microsomal LOG2-Myc expressed in N. benthamiana was, like GDU1, resistant to NaCl, but some protein was released with alkaline sodium carbonate and Triton X-100 detergent, indicating a weaker association with the membrane than GDU1 (Fig. 4E, left). We reasoned that the membrane association of LOG2 could result from covalent lipid modifications such as myristoylation, prenylation, or palmitoylation. Myristoylator (CITATION) and The MYR Predictor (http://mendel.imp.ac.at/myristate/SUPLpredictor.htm) predicted N-myristoylation sites for LOG2 and LUL1-4. Moreover, in vitro myristoylation of LUL1 was recently demonstrated (CITATION). To experimentally verify that LOG2 could be myristoylated, LOG2 and the corresponding G2A mutant (bearing a substitution known to inhibit N-terminal myristoylation; CITATION) were expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription-translation systems in the presence of [3H]myristic acid or [3H]Leu. These lysates contain the enzymes necessary for myristoylation (CITATION). Both proteins were expressed at similar levels, and LOG2 incorporated [3H]myristic acid. As expected, LOG2G2A was not myristoylated (Fig. 4F). Similar to LUL1 and LOG2, LUL3 was also myristoylated in a Gly-2-dependent manner (Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that all LOG2-like proteins are myristoylated in planta. To determine whether myristoylation affects LOG2 localization in planta, plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from N. benthamiana transiently expressing mLOG2-HA or mLOG2G2A-HA. While both proteins were found primarily in the microsomal fraction, mLOG2G2A was depleted from PEVs compared with wild-type mLOG2 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that LOG2 myristoylation is important for localization to the plasma membrane. Extraction of mLOG2G2A with sodium carbonate and Triton X-100 was markedly enhanced compared with mLOG2 (Fig. 4E), showing that the G2A mutation reduced the strength of binding to the membrane. While wild-type LOG2-GFP located exclusively at the plasma membrane in N. benthamiana, LOG2G2A-GFP also localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C, middle). In accordance with biochemical data (Fig. 4D), the fluorescence pattern of LOG2G2A-GFP overlapped extensively with cytosolic mCherry (Fig. 5D), suggesting that suppression of myristoylation prevented a fraction of LOG2 from being anchored to the membrane. To assess the effect of the G2A mutation on the GDU1-LOG2 interaction in planta, GDU1-HA was coexpressed with mLOG2-Myc or mLOG2G2A-Myc in N. benthamiana, and Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated as in Figure 1C. GDU1 coimmunoprecipitated with less efficiency with mLOG2G2A than mLOG2 (Fig. 4G), indicating that myristoylation enhances the LOG2 interaction with GDU1 in planta. The localization of the LOG2-GDU1 interaction was further studied by expressing in N. benthamiana mLOG2 and GDU1 fused to mCherry and GFP, respectively. LOG2-expressing Agrobacterium strains were infiltrated at low density, leading to heterogeneous expression in the epidermis, while GDU1-expressing Agrobacterium was infiltrated at a density enabling expression in all cells. GDU1 localized at the plasma membrane and in endosomes in cells expressing mLOG2 at low levels (Fig. 5E, middle cell) but mainly at the plasma membrane in cells expressing mLOG2 at higher levels (Fig. 5E, lateral cells). This change in localization pattern suggests that the interaction of LOG2 and GDU1 stabilized GDU1 localization at the plasma membrane. The observation that disruption of the LOG2-GDU1 interaction by the log1-1 mutation suppresses the Gdu1D phenotype (CITATION) suggested that LOG2 is involved in the pathway altered by GDU1 overexpression. To test this hypothesis, gdu1-1D was crossed with a plant carrying a T-DNA insertion (log2-2) in the first intron of LOG2 (Supplemental Fig. S1B). Reduction of LOG2 wild-type mRNA in the homozygous log2-2 mutant was confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S6). In log2-2 gdu1-1D double homozygous plants, GDU1 mRNA levels remained unaffected by the log2-2 mutation (Supplemental Figs. S7, A and B, and S8C). Five-week-old log2-2 and wild-type plants had similar rosette sizes, while as previously observed, gdu1-1D individuals exhibited characteristically smaller rosettes (Fig. 6A). In contrast to gdu1-1D segregants, gdu1-1D log2-2 double mutant plants developed rosettes similar in size to wild type (Fig. 6A) and grew to normal height (data not shown), indicating suppression of the Gdu1D growth phenotype in the log2-2 background. [[FIGURE]] gdu1-1D plants have been shown to be more tolerant to toxic concentrations of amino acids compared with the wild type (CITATION). To determine whether this other aspect of the Gdu1D phenotype is suppressed in the gdu-1D log2-2 double mutant, the susceptibilities of wild type, log2-2, gdu1-1D, and gdu1-1D log2-2 seedlings to 10 mm Phe, Met, and Leu were compared. Wild-type, log2-2 and gdu1-1D log2-2 plants did not grow in the presence of these amino acids, while most gdu1-1D plants developed green cotyledons (Fig. 6B). The phenotype of the soil-grown plants and amino acid tolerance assays indicate that the loss of LOG2 expression suppresses all characterized aspects of the Gdu1D phenotype. Of the available T-DNA insertion lines, only the log2-2 T-DNA was found to repress LOG2 transcript accumulation. To confirm the results obtained with the log2-2 line, four artificial microRNAs (amiRNAa, -b, -c, and -d) directed against the LOG2 transcript were created (Supplemental Fig. S1B). The amiRNAs were expressed in the gdu1-1D line under the control of the cassava vein mosaic virus (CsVMV) promoter (CITATION), a viral promoter of activity comparable to that of the CaMV 35S. The CsVMV promoter was used to avoid silencing of GDU1, driven in gdu1-1D by the 35S enhancer. Similar results were obtained with amiRNA expression as seen with the log2-2 mutation in the gdu1-1D background. Transformants created using LOG2-amiRNAa and -b had a phenotype similar to wild-type plants in the T2 generation at the expected 75% ratio (Fig. 7A). This phenotypic change occurred while GDU1 transcripts remained at levels similar to the progenitor line (Supplemental Fig. S8A). Amino acid tolerance to Leu, Phe, and Met was tested for five lines (three from LOG2-amiRNAa and two from LOG2-amiRNAb). The tolerance of the transformants was intermediate between gdu1-1D and the wild type, with lines a2 and b3 showing almost wild-type susceptibility on Leu and Phe (Fig. 7B; Supplemental Fig. S8B). [[FIGURE]] While the expression of LOG2-directed amiRNAs did suppress the Gdu1D phenotype, it was not resolved if the suppression affected GDU1 protein content. The 35S-GDU1-Myc line (see above) was used to probe GDU1 protein accumulation in a parallel experiment. amiRNAb was expressed in the 35S-GDU1-Myc line. Similar to the above results, expression of LOG2-amiRNAb in 35S-GDU1-Myc suppressed the Gdu1D phenotype in most of the transformants. Four independent transformation lines (lines 249A to -D) were chosen and studied for GDU1-Myc protein accumulation, LOG2 and GDU1 mRNA contents, and amino acid levels. Lines 249A and -D exhibited a mild Gdu1D phenotype, while lines 249B and -C showed wild-type morphology (Fig. 7C). Expression of LOG2-amiRNAb led to an 80% decrease in LOG2 mRNA in the four lines (Fig. 7D). GDU1 mRNA content was not significantly changed compared with the untransformed control, with about 5,000-fold overaccumulation compared with the wild type (Fig. 7D). Amino acid contents were reduced in the suppressed lines but were not equivalent to those in the wild type (Supplemental Table S1). Significantly, GDU1-Myc protein content was only slightly increased by the expression of LOG2-amiRNAb (Fig. 7D). A suppressor mutation, log2-1, was isolated in the same screening that led to the isolation of the log1-1 mutation (CITATION; Fig. 8A; Supplemental Text S1). Analyses of phenotypic segregation after crosses of log2-1 with the wild type and the gdu1-5D parental line validated the hypothesis that log2-1 is a single recessive mutation, independent of the log1-1 mutation (Supplemental Text S1). Positional cloning of log2-1 showed that the mutation was very close to the LOG2 gene (Supplemental Fig. S9). Sequencing of the LOG2 gene in log2-1 revealed the presence of a G-to-A mutation 35 bp after the ATG, leading to an Arg-to-Lys mutation (R12K; Supplemental Fig. S1B). Transformation of the log2-1 gdu1-5D double mutant by a genomic fragment containing the wild-type LOG2 gene complemented the log2-1 mutation. This complementation proved that suppression of the Gdu1D phenotype in the log2-1 gdu1-5D double mutant resulted from the R12K mutation in LOG2 (Fig. 8A). [[FIGURE]] The fact that log2-1 is recessive suggested a loss-of-function mutation, but, despite extensive trials, no difference in functional properties has been found to date between LOG2R12K and LOG2: the R12K mutation did not impair the ubiquitin ligase activity of the protein (Fig. 8B) or the ability to ubiquitinate cGDU1 in vitro (Fig. 8E). In addition, yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and in planta coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that LOG2R12K interacted with GDU1 very similarly to LOG2 (Figs. 1C and 8, C and D). LOG2R12K-GFP also localized to the plasma membrane like wild-type LOG2-GFP in transiently transformed N. benthamiana leaves (Fig. 5C, right). The R12K mutation had no effect on GDU1-Myc accumulation when log2-1 was introduced into the 35S-GDU1-Myc line (Fig. 8F). Leading to significant suppression of the Gdu1D phenotype with no detectable effect on the LOG2-GDU1 interaction, the nature of the defect in LOG2R12K is currently unknown.
!~MM~! Transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; ecotypes Columbia-0 [Col-0] and Col-7) plants were procured via the floral dip method (CITATION) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90). Seed harboring the log2-2 T-DNA (Syngenta Arabidopsis Insertion Library accession 729_A08; CITATION) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. gdu1-1D log2-2 double homozygote plants were identified in the F2 generation of a cross between gdu1-1D pollen and log2-2 ovules via PCR of genomic DNA (for primer sequences, see Supplemental Table S2). Phenotypic analyses of gdu1-1D log2-2 and gdu1-1D amiRNA-LOG2 double mutant plants were performed on homozygous F3 and T4 individuals, respectively (except for segregation of the GDU1 overexpression phenotype of gdu1-1D amiRNA-LOG2 double mutant plants on soil, which was carried out on T2 individuals). 35S-GDU1-Myc log2-1 double homozygotes were identified in the F2 generation of a cross between the pollen of the log2-1 single mutant, obtained from a cross of the log2-1 gdu1-5D double mutant with Col-7, and 35S-GDU1-Myc ovules via analysis of antibiotic resistance and phenotype. For transient expression, leaves of 5-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana plants were infiltrated with a suspension of A. tumefaciens carrying constructs of interest according to CITATION. To assess amino acid sensitivity, surface-sterilized seeds were sown on agar plates comprising 1× Murashige and Skoog salts (CITATION), 1% (w/v) Suc, 2.5 mm MES, 0.5 μg mL−1 pyroxidine-Cl, 0.1 μg mL−1 myoinositol, 0.8% (w/v) BactoAgar (BD Biosciences), pH 5.7, and 10 mm amino acids. Plants were grown for 14 d in an incubator (24 h of light, 50 μmol m−2 s−1, 22°C). Primer sequences used for cloning and site-directed mutagenesis are listed in Supplemental Table S2. For the yeast two-hybrid screen, the region encoding the C-terminal domain of GDU1 (residues 61–158) was cloned into pGBKT7 or pGBT9 (Clontech) using specific primers and the EcoRI and PstI sites. For the yeast two-hybrid interaction matrix, cDNAs encoding the C-terminal soluble part of the GDUs and the full sequences of LOG2 and LULs were amplified by PCR with primers containing the attB Gateway sequences, cloned into pDONRZeo (Invitrogen), sequenced, and transferred into pACT2 and pGBT9 vectors, which were previously made Gateway compatible by insertion of the Gateway cassette (R. Pratelli and G. Pilot, unpublished data). To obtain GST- and V5-tagged LOG2 and LUL1, the coding sequences were amplified by PCR, cloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) using the Gateway technology, and recombined into pDEST15 and pET-DEST42 (Invitrogen), respectively. flag-cGDU1 was produced similarly with the destination vector pEAK2 (CITATION). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to create RING-dead LOG2 (LOG2C354/C557AA; mLOG2) RING-weak LOG2 (LOG2I321A), and myristoylation-inhibited LOG2 (LOG2G2A). For the in vitro myristoylation assay, LOG2 was recombined into pEXP2 and pET-DEST42 (Invitrogen). GFP and mCherry fusion constructs were created by Gateway cloning into pPWGTkan and pPWMTkan, derivatives of pJHA212K (CITATION), where the Gateway cassette was inserted between the CaMV 35S promoter and the eGFP or mCherry coding sequence (R. Pratelli and G. Pilot, unpublished data). The HA fusion construct used for Arabidopsis transformation was obtained by Gateway cloning into pGWB14 (CITATION). HA and Myc fusions used for transient assays in N. benthamiana were obtained using vectors similar to pPWGTkan, where a double HA tag or a triple Myc tag replaced the eGFP. The GDU1 VIMAG domain was deleted by cloning next to each other in pBluescript two PCR fragments corresponding to the regions upstream and downstream of the domain and sharing an EcoRI site at the exact place of the VIMAG domain. The resulting construct was used as a template for PCR toward Gateway cloning into pDONR221 (Invitrogen). amiRNAs were designed following the guidelines found in WMD3 (http://wmd3.weigelworld.org/; CITATION). The primers corresponding to pRS300 (CITATION) used for amplification of the miRNAs contained the Gateway attB sites. The final PCR fragment was cloned into pDONRZeo (Invitrogen), sequenced, and transferred into the pSWsNkan binary vector, another derivative of pJHA212K (CITATION, R. Pratelli and G. Pilot, unpublished data), between the CsVMV promoter (CITATION) and the terminator of the small subunit of the Rubisco from pea (Pisum sativum; accession no. X00806). For log2-1 complementation, a XhoI-PstI 8.5-kb genomic DNA fragment from bacterial artificial chromosome F11F8 containing the wild-type LOG2 gene was cloned into the pTkan binary vector, a derivative of pJHA212K. For screening, the bait plasmids were cointroduced along with an Arabidopsis cell cDNA library (CITATION) into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) using the TRAFO protocol (CITATION). About 2 million transformants were selected on SC medium lacking Leu, Trp, His, and adenine (2% Glc, 6.7 g L−1 yeast nitrogen base without amino acid [BD Biosciences], pH 6.3, and dropout amino acid mix). Plasmids were extracted from the colonies displaying auxotrophy for the four amino acids and introduced back into yeast together with the cGDU1 construct. The inserts of the eight plasmids restoring yeast growth on selective medium were then sequenced. For interaction matrices, yeast strains AH109 (MATa) and Y187 (MATα) were transformed as described above with the prey and bait vectors, respectively, and selected on medium lacking Trp or Leu. Several colonies were scrapped and resuspended together in 250 μL of water. Prey-bait pairs were mixed together (10 μL of each suspension and 50 μL of water), and 5 μL was spotted on YPDA (1% [w/v] yeast extract, 2% [w/v] bacto peptone, 2% [w/v] Glc, 80 mg L−1 adenine, and 1.5% agar) for mating. After overnight growth at 30°C, the cell spots were scrapped and resuspended in 100 μL of water, and 5 μL was spotted on SC medium lacking Trp and Leu. After growth at 30°C for 2 d, the spots were scrapped and resuspended in 100 μL of water, and 5 μL was spotted on SC medium lacking Trp, Leu, adenine, and His. Growth was assessed after 2, 3, and 6 d to identify positive interactions. β-Galactosidase activity of yeast was measured using a protocol obtained from Clontech (manual no. PT3024-1). Briefly, cells grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Z buffer), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid N2 and at 37°C. The broken cell suspension (100 μL) was added to 900 μL of 800 μg mL−1 ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside in Z buffer and incubated for several hours at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μL of 1 m Na2CO3, and optical density at 420 nm was measured. GST-, V5-His6-, and His6-flag fusion proteins were expressed in BL21-pLysS Escherichia coli essentially as described by CITATION with a few modifications. The lysis buffer comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5× Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) for GST-tagged proteins and was supplemented with 20 mm imidazole for His-tagged proteins. Cells were lysed by sonication. For GST proteins, glutathione bead slurries were brought to 20% (v/v) glycerol after the final wash, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. His-tagged proteins were eluted from nickel Sepharose beads, brought to 20% glycerol, and flash frozen. His6-flag-cGDU1 was purified likewise, except that buffers contained 50 mm K2HPO4-KH2PO4, pH 5.75, in place of Tris-HCl. To further purify cGDU1, eluted protein was centrifuged through a 30-kD NMWL Amicon concentrator (Millipore), and the eluate was concentrated and buffer exchanged in a 5-kD NMWL Amicon concentrator with 50 mm K2HPO4-KH2PO4, pH 5.75, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5× Complete Protease Inhibitors. The final retentate was brought to 20% glycerol and flash frozen. In vitro pull-downs were performed as described by CITATION with the following differences: GST proteins on beads were washed once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5× Complete Protease Inhibitors (wash buffer) prior to being mixed with a soluble prey protein in 400 μL of wash buffer and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. Proteins were eluted by suspending beads in 60 μL of elution buffer (wash buffer + 50 mm glutathione) and shaking at 4°C for 15 min. In vitro ubiquitination assays were conducted essentially according to CITATION with slight modifications: 4 μg of bovine ubiquitin (Sigma-Aldrich), approximately 2 μg of GST- or V5-His6-LOG2, and approximately 1.5 μg of His6-flag-cGDU1 were used. Reactions were quenched with 10 μL of 5× Laemmli sample buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 32% [v/v] glycerol, 6.4% [w/v] SDS, 0.32% [w/v] bromophenol blue, and 200 mm DTT), boiled for 5 min, and separated via SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by western blot using anti-flag-linked horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturers’ recommendations or anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Anti-ubiquitin antibodies were raised against bovine full-length ubiquitin prepared according to CITATION by Aves Labs, affinity purified, and used at 1:5,000 dilution. Proteins were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. Three days after infiltration, 500 mg of leaves was ground with 1.5 mL of extraction buffer on ice (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm DTT, and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitors). Homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000g and 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through several layers of Miracloth (EMD Biochemicals) and quantitated using the Bradford assay (Fermentas). Proteins were coimmunoprecipitated use the ProFound c-Myc Tag IP/Co-IP Kit (Pierce): 3 mg of proteins was placed on a rotary wheel overnight at 4°C in a coimmunoprecipitation spin column with cMyc-agarose; after washing, the proteins were eluted three times with 10 μL of the supplied elution buffer and neutralized by 1.5 μL of 1 m Tris, pH 9.5. One microliter of coimmunoprecipitation eluate and 10 μg of total proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4%–12% polyacrylamide MES gel; Invitrogen) and western blotting. Proteins were transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) and detected using anti-cMyc (clone A-14; Santa Cruz; 1:10,000) or anti-HA (clone 3F10; Roche Diagnostics; 1:5,000) primary antibodies, anti-rabbit or anti-rat (Thermo Scientific) secondary antibodies, and the ECL-Plus western-blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Endomembranes were prepared from Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana according to CITATION with the following modifications: 5 to 30 g of 8-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings, 5-week-old Arabidopsis rosette leaves, or N. benthamiana leaves 3 d after infiltration were homogenized with a Waring blender in 60 mL of homogenization buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.33 m Suc, 2 mm ascorbic acid, 1.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% [w/v] polyvinylpolypyrrolidone). The sensitivity of GDU1 or LOG2 membrane association to detergent, salt, and pH was examined as described by CITATION with a 1-h incubation on ice. PEVs and PDVs were purified from total microsomes according to CITATION: upper phases 4 and 5 were combined to afford PEVs, while lower phase 1 was extracted five times with fresh upper phase to afford PDVs. Plasma membrane enrichment and depletion were qualitatively assessed with the α-PMA2 antibody (M. Boutry, Université Catholique de Louvain). Protein concentration was assessed by the Bradford or bicinchoninic acid protein assays. About 3 kb of the region upstream from LOG2 ATG was amplified by PCR and cloned using BamHI and PstI in pUTkan (CITATION). GUS histochemical staining was performed as described (CITATION). N. benthamiana epidermis cells were visualized with the Zeiss LSM510 META confocal system on an Axio Observer.Z1 microscope using a C-Apochromat 40× water-immersion, numerical aperture 1.2 objective (Carl Zeiss), a 488-nm argon multiline gas laser, and a 543-nm helium-neon gas laser, with band-pass 505 to 550 and long-pass 560 emission filters, respectively. Serial images were captured and processed by the Zen 2009 software (Carl Zeiss) using maximal projection. Genomic DNA was extracted from Arabidopsis plants using the cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide method (CITATION). Total RNA was extracted either with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) or by 1 mL of TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperScript III system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For quantitative PCR, the efficiency-calibrated method was implemented (CITATION). Five microliters of primer mix (1 μm each) and 5 μL of the RT product (made from 2 μg of total RNA) diluted 50 times were mixed with 10 μL of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to the following cycles: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 times at 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 1 min (in a 7300 Real Time PCR System; Applied Biosystems). Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze dried, weighed, and ground with three 3-mm glass beads in an Ultramat Amalgamator (SDI, Inc.). Amino acids were extracted from the dry powder by 200 μL of 10 mm HCl and 200 μL of chloroform. After vortexing for 2 min, the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000g, and 150 μL of the supernatant was dried under vacuum. The dried extract was solubilized in 500 μL of 50% acetonitrile in water and 0.05% heptafluorobutyric acid, and the metabolites were separated by ion-pairing liquid chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Supplemental Text S2).
