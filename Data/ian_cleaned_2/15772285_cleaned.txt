!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1 (snc1) mutant contains a gain-of-function mutation in a Toll Interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding-Leu-rich repeat–type resistance gene (R-gene), which leads to constitutive activation of disease resistance response against pathogens. In a screen for suppressors of snc1, a recessive mutation, designated mos3 (for modifier of snc1,3), was found to suppress the constitutive pathogenesis-related gene expression and resistance to virulent Pseudomonas syringae maculicola ES4326 and Peronospora parasitica Noco2 in snc1. In addition, mos3 is also compromised in resistance mediated by Resistance to Peronospora parasitica 4 (RPP4), Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola (RPM1), and Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 4 (RPS4). Single mutant mos3 plants exhibited enhanced disease susceptibility to P. s. pv maculicola ES4326, suggesting that MOS3 is required for basal resistance to pathogens as well. mos3-1 was identified by map-based cloning, and it encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to human nucleoporin 96. Localization of the MOS3-green fluorescent protein fusion to the nuclear envelope further indicates that MOS3 may encode a nucleoporin, suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking plays an important role in both R-gene–mediated and basal disease resistance.
!~RES~! Mutants that lost the snc1 morphological phenotypes of small stature and curly dark-green leaves were identified in the M2 population of fast neutron-mutagenized snc1 or snc1 npr1-1. The progeny of these plants were further analyzed for the expression of the pBGL2–β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in the M3 generation. Approximately 50 recessive mutants with no constitutive GUS staining were obtained and subsequently named mos (for modifier of snc1). Among them, three are mutant alleles of PAD4 (CITATION), a gene that was previously shown to be required for snc1 signaling (CITATION). The rest fall into 14 complementation groups mapped to loci that contain no known essential components of R-gene signaling. Here, we report the characterization and cloning of mos3-1. The isolated mos3-1 snc1 plants are of intermediate size. The leaves of these plants are lighter green and no longer curly (Figure 1A), and the mos3-1 mutant flowers slightly earlier than wild-type plants. Real-time RT-PCR was used to compare the SNC1 expression level in snc1 and mos3-1 snc1, and no significant difference was observed (data not shown). The constitutive pBGL2-GUS reporter gene expression in snc1 was completely suppressed by the mos3-1 mutation (Figure 1B). RT-PCR analysis showed that endogenous PR-2 (BGL2) was no longer constitutively expressed (Figure 2). The constitutive expression of PR-1 in snc1 was suppressed in mos3-1 snc1 as well (Figure 2). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] When mos3-1 snc1 (pBGL2-GUS) was backcrossed with snc1 (pBGL2-GUS), the F1 progeny exhibited snc1 morphology, indicating that mos3-1 is a recessive mutation. Among the 44 F2 progeny, 35 had GUS staining, suggesting that the suppression of pBGL2-GUS expression by mos3-1 is caused by a single recessive mutation (expected ratio: 3:1, χ 2 = 0.48; P > 0.1). Previously, snc1 was shown to accumulate high levels of SA (CITATION). To determine whether mos3-1 affects the SA level in snc1, total SA and free SA in the mos3-1 snc1 plants were determined. As shown in Figure 3, the free SA in mos3-1 snc1 is approximately fourfold lower than that in snc1, whereas the total SA in mos3-1 snc1 is ∼10-fold lower, indicating that the signal leading to increased SA synthesis in snc1 is absent or dramatically reduced by the mos3-1 mutation. The SA level in the single mutant was similar to that in the wild-type plants (Figure 3). [[FIGURE]] To test whether the constitutive pathogen resistance in snc1 was affected by the mos3-1 mutation, mos3-1 snc1 plants were inoculated with the virulent bacterial pathogen P.s.m. ES4326 or oomycete pathogen P.p. Noco2. Whereas snc1 plants were resistant to these two pathogens, the mos3-1 snc1 double mutant lost the resistance completely. The bacterial growth in mos3-1 snc1 was significantly higher than that in wild-type plants but considerably lower than the bacterial growth in the snc1 pad4-1 plants (Figure 4). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the mos3 single mutant is more susceptible to the virulent bacterial pathogen P.s.m. ES4326, bacterial growth in mos3-1, pad4-1, and Columbia wild-type plants was compared. As shown in Figure 5A, bacterial growth in mos3-1 is ∼20-fold higher than that in the wild-type plants. In pad4-1 plants, the bacterial growth is one order of magnitude higher compared with the mos3-1 plants. [[FIGURE]] To test whether mos3-1 affects functions of genetically defined R-genes, mos3-1 plants were inoculated with P. parasitica Emoy2 (P.p. Emoy2). In the Columbia ecotype, wild-type plants are resistant to P.p. Emoy2, and the resistance is mediated by RPP4 (CITATION), a TIR-NB-LRR–type R-gene closely related to SNC1. As shown in Figure 5B, mos3-1 was more susceptible than the wild type, but less susceptible than the rar1-21 control plants, suggesting that RPP4-mediated resistance to P.p. Emoy2 is partially compromised by mos3-1 mutation. P.p. Emoy2 infected mos3-1 leaves also displayed trailing necrosis (see Supplemental Figure 1 online), which is a phenotype often associated with partial loss of R-gene–mediated resistance. In addition, mos3-1 supports significantly higher growth of bacterial strains carrying either avrRps4 or avrB (Figures 5C and 5D), suggesting that mos3-1 partially affects the resistance mediated by RPS4 and RPM1 as well. To map the mos3-1 mutation, mos3-1 snc1 (in the Columbia ecotype background with pBGL2-GUS) was crossed with Landsberg erecta (Ler)-snc1 (with no pBGL2-GUS) to generate a segregating population. For crude mapping, 24 plants homozygous at the mos3-1 locus were identified in the F2 progeny on the basis of lack of snc1 morphology. Linkage was found on the bottom of chromosome 1. When the marker F28K19 on chromosome 1 was used, two recombinants were found, whereas when the marker F23A5 was used, no recombinant was found, indicating mos3-1 is south of F28K19 and closely linked to F23A5 (Figure 6A). Because F23A5 is the last BAC clone on the south end of chromosome 1, mos3-1 is most likely to be flanked by these two markers. [[FIGURE]] For fine mapping, 720 randomly chosen F3 plants derived from F2 plants heterozygous for mos3-1 and carrying the homozygous pBGL2-GUS reporter gene were genotyped with the markers F28K19 and F23A5. A total of 51 recombinants between these two markers were found, and their seeds were collected. The phenotypes of the recombinants were subsequently determined by assessing the segregation of GUS staining and the snc1 morphological phenotype in their progeny. The phenotypes of all 51 recombinants were perfectly correlated with the genotypes at marker F23A5, suggesting that mos3-1 is tightly linked to this marker. Further analysis of the 51 recombinants with additional markers indicated that mos3-1 was positioned to the south of F5I6-8, located at position 89 kb of the BAC clone F5I6 (Figure 6A). The distance between marker F5I6-8 and the south end of chromosome 1 is ∼165 kb. This region in mos3-1 snc1 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. A single A-to-C point mutation was found in At1g80680. The cDNA of the gene was then obtained by sequencing three overlapping RT-PCR fragments covering the gene and found to be consistent with the annotation of At1g80680 (GenBank accession number NM_106716). The GenBank accession number for MOS3 is AY942798. At1g80680 is identical to PRE (GenBank accession number AF411839), suggesting that mos3-1 may be allelic to pre, which was reported at the Arabidopsis Conference 2001 to have an early flowering phenotype (C. Alonso-Blanco, I. Ausin, L. Ruiz-Garcia, and J.M. Martinez-Zapater, Molecular analysis of FVE and PRE: Two genes involved in the autonomous flowering promotion pathway. 12th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, 23–27 June, 2001, Madison, WI.). Microarray analysis of snc1 and wild-type plants indicated that there is no significant difference in the expression level of At1g80680 in the wild type and snc1 (data not shown). Comparison of the cDNA sequence and the genomic sequence revealed that At1g80680 consists of six exons. The A-to-C mutation in mos3-1 occurs at the 3′ intron acceptor site at the junction between the fifth intron and the sixth exon (Figure 6B). This mutation results in a deletion of 52 nucleotides in the cDNA. BLAST analysis of At1g80680 shows that it encodes a protein with high similarity to the human nucleoporin Nup96 and the C-terminal part of the yeast nucleoporin Nup145 (Figure 7). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that MOS3 is At1g80680, a plasmid expressing the cDNA of At1g80680 driven by the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus was transformed into mos3-1 snc1. Among 12 transgenic plants obtained, 10 displayed snc1 morphology. Expression of the pBGL2-GUS reporter gene was also restored in the transgenic plants with snc1 morphology, suggesting that MOS3 is At1g80680. Furthermore, progeny of two independent transgenic lines carrying the MOS3 transgene were tested for resistance against P.p. Noco2. As shown in Figure 8, constitutive resistance to P.p. Noco2 was restored in the transgenic plants. [[FIGURE]] At the same time, we obtained two additional mutant alleles of At1g80680 from the ABRC. mos3-2 (Salk_109959) contains a T-DNA insertion in the fifth exon, and mos3-3 (Salk_117966) contains a T-DNA insertion in the second intron of At1g80680 (Figure 6B). Because the mos3-1 single mutant is more susceptible to the virulent bacterial pathogen P.s.m. ES4326, we tested mos3-2 for enhanced disease susceptibility to this pathogen. As shown in Figure 5A, mos3-2 supports ∼20-fold more bacterial growth than wild-type plants To test whether mos3-2 and mos3-3 are allelic to mos3-1, the homozygous lines were crossed with mos3-1 snc1. Because morphology of snc1 is recessive (CITATION), plus snc1 and mos3-1 are located on different chromosomes, if mos3-2 is not allelic to mos3-1, then 3/16 of the F2 progeny is expected to have snc1 morphology. Among 240 F2 plants from the cross between mos3-2 and mos3-1 snc1, none has the snc1 morphology, suggesting that mos3-2 is allelic to mos3-1. Similar results were obtained from the cross between mos3-1 snc1 and mos3-3. Furthermore, five independent mos3-2 snc1 lines were obtained from the F2, and the morphology of these lines is indistinguishable from that of mos3-1 snc1, further suggesting that MOS3 is At1g80680. To determine the subcellular localization of the MOS3 protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the C terminus of MOS3. In wild-type transgenic plants expressing the MOS3-GFP fusion protein under the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus, GFP fluorescence was observed predominantly on the nuclear rim (Figures 9A and 9B), suggesting that MOS3 is localized to the nuclear envelope. By comparison, GFP in the 35S-GFP control plants was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 9C). To determine whether the MOS3-GFP protein is functional, mos3-1 snc1 plants were transformed with the pBI-MOS3-GFP construct. As shown in Figure 9D, transgenic plants expressing the MOS3-GFP fusion protein displayed snc1 morphology, suggesting that the MOS3-GFP can complement the mos3-1 mutation, and the fusion protein is correctly localized in Arabidopsis plants.

!~MM~! All plants were grown at 22°C under 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles. The snc1 or snc1 npr1-1 mutant seeds were treated with fast neutron at a dose of 60 Gy by Andrea Kodym (Agriculture and Biotechnology Laboratory, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria). In the primary screen, ∼150,000 M2 plants representing ∼10,000 M1 families were grown on soil and screened for loss of the snc1 morphological phenotype. Seeds from the putative mutants were subsequently plated on MS medium and tested for loss of the constitutive pBGL2-GUS reporter gene expression by GUS staining. Mutants with no constitutive GUS staining were backcrossed with snc1, and the morphology of the F1 plants was analyzed to determine whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. RNA used for gene expression analysis was extracted from 20-d-old plants grown on MS medium using the Totally RNA kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Reverse transcription was performed using the RT-for-PCR kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The primers used for amplification of Actin1, PR-1, PR-2, and SNC1 were described previously (CITATION). Infection of wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana with Pseudomonas syringae maculicola ES4326 was performed on 4-week-old plants and infection of Peronospora parasitica Noco2 was performed on 2-week-old seedlings as described (CITATION). SA was extracted and measured using a previously described procedure (CITATION). To introgress the Columbia snc1 mutation into the Landsberg ecotype background, snc1 was backcrossed with wild-type Landsberg plants six times. A single line homozygous for snc1 was selected from the F2 population of the sixth backcross and designated Ler-snc1. This line was confirmed to contain homozygous Landsberg sequences at each arm of the five chromosomes. To map the mos3-1 mutation, mos3-1 was crossed with Ler-snc1. Crude mapping was performed on the F2 plants homozygous for mos3-1, and fine mapping was performed on F3 plants derived from F2 plants heterozygous for mos3-1 while carrying the homozygous pBGL2-GUS reporter gene. Both morphology and GUS staining of the progeny were used to confirm the phenotypes of the mapping lines. The markers used for mapping were designed according to the Monsanto Arabidopsis polymorphism and Landsberg sequence collections (CITATION). Marker F28K19 was amplified with primers 5′-CTTAATAAAGTTGGTTCAACCG-3′ and 5′-GTTGCCATTAGCAAGCTGTC-3′, and the Columbia fragment was 29 bp shorter than the Landsberg fragment. Marker F23A5 was amplified with primers 5′-AAGTTTTCGAGATGCGCTGC-3′ and 5′-CACCTTTTGCTTTGGCCGTC-3′, and the Columbia fragment was 35 bp shorter than the Landsberg fragment. Marker F5I6-1 was amplified with primers 5′-AACTATACAGGCCGCATTAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCGCCTTTGCCACGCCA-3′, and the Columbia fragment was 99 bp shorter than the Landsberg fragment. Marker F5I6-8 was amplified with primers 5′-CGTGACAGCGCTGGCTGAG-3′ and 5′-CGTTCTGGTTTCGTCTGGAG-3′, and the single nucleotide polymorphism was detected by sequencing the PCR fragments. To confirm that the mutation identified in At1g80680 is mos3-1, full-length cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned into pBI1.4T (CITATION) and transformed into mos3-1 snc1 plants by the floral dipping method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on MS plates containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin. The T-DNA insertion mutants mos3-2 and mos3-3 were obtained from the ABRC (CITATION). Plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR using primers 5′-GGGATTTGTTGCACAGCTTC-3′ and 5′-ACTCATTCACGCTTCTAAGG-3′, which flank the insertions. To identify the mos3-1 single mutant, mos3-1 snc1 was crossed with wild-type plants containing pBGL2-GUS. F2 plants were genotyped for the mos3-1 and snc1 mutations by PCR. Lines homozygous for mos3-1 with no snc1 mutation were kept as mos3-1 single mutants and used for further analysis. To fuse MOS3 to the GFP gene, full-length MOS3 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pBS-GFP5 vector (CITATION). The resulting plasmid was sequenced to confirm that the fusion was in frame without PCR mistakes. The fragment containing the MOS3-GFP fusion was subsequently excised and cloned into pBI1.4T to obtain pBI-MOS3-GFP. pBI-MOS3-GFP was used to transform mos3-1 snc1 and the wild-type plants; transgenic plants were selected on MS medium containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin. Roots of the transgenic seedlings were examined for GFP by confocal microscopy as described previously (CITATION).
