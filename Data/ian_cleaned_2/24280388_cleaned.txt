!~ABS~! Plant cells face unique challenges to efficiently export cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mobile Golgi stacks. Coat protein complex II (COPII) components, which include two heterodimers of Secretory23/24 (Sec23/24) and Sec13/31, facilitate selective cargo export from the ER; however, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate their recruitment to the ER membrane, especially in plants. Here, we report a protein transport mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, named maigo5 (mag5), which abnormally accumulates precursor forms of storage proteins in seeds. mag5-1 has a deletion in the putative ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens Sec16, which encodes a critical component of ER exit sites (ERESs). mag mutants developed abnormal structures (MAG bodies) within the ER and exhibited compromised ER export. A functional MAG5/SEC16A–green fluorescent protein fusion localized at Golgi-associated cup-shaped ERESs and cycled on and off these sites at a slower rate than the COPII coat. MAG5/SEC16A interacted with SEC13 and SEC31; however, in the absence of MAG5/SEC16A, recruitment of the COPII coat to ERESs was accelerated. Our results identify a key component of ER export in plants by demonstrating that MAG5/SEC16A is required for protein export at ERESs that are associated with mobile Golgi stacks, where it regulates COPII coat turnover.
!~RES~! Seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis contain two major storage proteins, 12S globulin and 2S albumin, but no precursors of these proteins. Immunoblotting with a specific antibody against each of these storage proteins showed that in seeds of the mag5 mutant (designated mag5-1), precursor forms of both storage proteins were abnormally accumulated (Figure 1A, p12S and p2S). This suggested that mag5-1 has a defect either in the transport pathway from the ER to PSVs or in the conversion of precursors to mature forms. The former defect generates a 17-kD precursor of 2S albumin, whereas the latter defect generates 15- and 16-kD precursors of 2S albumin (CITATION). As mag5-1 accumulated a 17-kD precursor of 2S albumin, is it likely to have defective transport machinery (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained with the other known mag mutants (Figures 1A and 1B): mag2-1 has a defect in a homolog of RINT-1/TIP20 on the ER (CITATION), whereas mag4-1 has a defect in a homolog of the Golgi tethering factor p115 (CITATION). mag2-1 and mag4-1 both contained the 17-kD precursor of 2S albumin. Therefore, the mag screen successfully identified factors responsible for protein transport from the ER to vacuoles. [[FIGURE]] Map-based cloning and DNA sequencing revealed that mag5-1 has a 34-bp deletion in the first exon of At5g47480 (Figure 2A, top). Consistent with this, the RT-PCR product of mag5-1 generated using primers that flanked the deletion (F1 and R1 primers) was shorter than that of the wild type (Figure 2B). Sequencing analysis of MAG5 cDNA in mag5-1 revealed that the deletion caused a frameshift and a stop codon (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Therefore, although mag5-1 produces a transcript (Figure 2C), the mutant is likely null. To further link the mag5 phenotype to disruption of the At5g47480 gene, we isolated two allelic mutants with a T-DNA insertion in the ninth or first exon of At5g47480 that we named mag5-2 and mag5-3, respectively (Figure 2A, top). Based on a lack of detectable At5g47480 transcripts, both mag5-2 and mag5-3 were RNA-null mutants (Figure 2C). Consistent with this, immunoblots clearly showed that mag5-2 and mag5-3 both accumulated abnormal levels of the precursors of storage proteins (Figure 2D), similar to mag5-1. These results, together with the complementation test results (see below), indicate that mutation of At5g47480 is responsible for the mag5 phenotype. [[FIGURE]] The At5g47480 protein (1350 amino acids) has low sequence similarity to human Sec16A (2357 amino acids) and yeast Sec16 (2195 amino acids;see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The central region of At5g47480 containing 223 amino acids has 31% identity to the corresponding region of human Sec16A, whereas the C-terminal region of At5g47480 containing 330 amino acids has 25% identity to the corresponding region of human Sec16A. The C-terminal region of At5g47480 containing 40 amino acids has 43% identity to the corresponding region of yeast Sec16p. These C-terminal and central regions are conserved domains among Sec16 proteins and are proposed to mediate the interactions of Sec16 proteins with other COPII components (CITATION). Thus, it seems possible that the At5g47480 protein is a homolog of Sec16. Here, we designate the At5g47480 gene as MAG5/SEC16A. The Arabidopsis genome has another gene (At5g47490) that is similar to MAG5/SEC16A and is situated next to MAG5/SEC16A in the genome. The At5g47490 protein shares 68% identity and 75% similarity with MAG5/SEC16A and is hereafter designated as SEC16B. We established three mutants of SEC16B (sec16b-1, sec16b-2, and sec16b-3; Figure 2A, bottom), all of which were RNA-null mutants (Figure 2C). None of the sec16b mutants exhibited abnormal accumulation of storage protein precursors in seeds (Figure 2D). This is consistent with the fact that expression of SEC16B is lower than that of MAG5/SEC16A in maturing seeds (ATTED-II database). We examined whether the lack of MAG5/SEC16A induces defects at the subcellular level. Live-cell imaging is not feasible in seeds; therefore, we compared the seed cells of the three mag5 mutants with those of the wild-type plants using immunoelectron microscopy. In wild-type seed cells, the storage proteins 12S globulin and 2S albumin were localized in electron-dense PSVs (Figures 3A and 3B, WT). By contrast, all mag5 mutants (mag5-1, mag5-2, and mag5-3) developed abnormal structures that contained electron-dense cores ∼1 µm in diameter (Figure 3A, arrowheads). Immunoelectron analyses of the mag5 mutants revealed that 2S albumin was present in the cores of these structures, whereas 12S globulin was detected in the matrix region (Figure 3B). These features resemble those of MAG bodies observed in mag2 (CITATION) and mag4 (CITATION) mutants, which are defective in trafficking between the ER and the Golgi. A defect in transport at the ER/Golgi interface of the mag5 mutants may lead to the generation of MAG bodies in seed cells in the mag5 mutants. [[FIGURE]] To test whether loss of MAG5/SEC16A also caused defects in Golgi membrane traffic in other tissues, the knockout line mag5-2 was stably transformed with the Golgi marker sialyl transferase (ST)-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) (CITATION). In epidermal cells of wild-type plants, ST-GFP clearly localized in the Golgi (Figure 4A, left panel). However, in the mag5-2 background, ST-GFP was partially distributed in the ER and Golgi (Figure 4A, right panel). To establish whether this abnormal distribution of ST-GFP was linked to defects in ER export, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses of ST-GFP (CITATION).The fluorescence recovery rate of the marker was compared between the mutant and wild-type plants. ST-GFP cycled in and out of the Golgi significantly more slowly in the mag5-2 mutant than in the wild type (Figure 4B), although the mobile fraction of ST-GFP (i.e., the percentage of available mobile protein) was similar in the two backgrounds (Figure 4C). Consistent with these results, when ER export was indirectly inhibited using brefeldin A, which disrupts COPI assembly at the Golgi (CITATION), ST-GFP redistributed to the ER to a greater extent in the mag5-2 mutant compared with the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Taken together, these data demonstrate that protein export from the ER is affected by the lack of functional MAG5/SEC16A. [[FIGURE]] To determine the subcellular distribution of MAG5/SEC16A, we introduced genomic MAG5/SEC16A-GFP, whose expression was driven by the native MAG5/SEC16A promoter (ProMAG5/SEC16A:MAG5/SEC16A-GFP), into the mag5-1 mutant and obtained seven independent T1 lines. Storage protein precursors did not accumulate in T2 seeds from any of these T1 lines (Figure 5A), indicating that the expression of MAG5/SEC16A-GFP under the control of the native promoter rescued the mag5 phenotype. Hence, MAG5/SEC16A-GFP is functional in vivo. The transgenic plants expressing MAG5/SEC16A-GFP under the native MAG5/SEC16A promoter exhibited flluorescent punctate structures in epidermal cells of cotyledons (Figure 5B). Similarly, transgenic plants that expressed MAG5/SEC16A-GFP under the control of the 35S promoter displayed punctate fluorescent structures (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). The transgenic plants had a healthy phenotype and a normal morphology (see Supplemental Figure 4 online), indicating that overexpression of MAG5/SEC16A-GFP does not significantly disrupt plant growth. [[FIGURE]] To determine the distribution of MAG5/SEC16A with respect to secretory organelles, GFP-MAG5/SEC16A was coexpressed with several specific markers: an inert luminal marker of the ER, ER-YK (CITATION); a marker of the most cis-Golgi cisternae, ERD2-YFP (for yellow fluorescent protein) (CITATION); a marker of trans-Golgi cisternae, ST-mRFP (for monomeric red fluorescent protein) (CITATION); and trans-Golgi network marker YFP-SYP61 (CITATION). Confocal microscopy analyses showed that GFP-MAG5/SEC16A overlapped with ERD2-YFP (Figure 5C) and ST-mRFP (Figure 5D). GFP-MAG5/SEC16A was present in cup-like punctate structures within the ER-YK–labeled ER network (Figure 5E, inset). GFP fluorescence was not uniform in these structures and was more intense in some regions (Figure 5E, inset, arrow). Nonetheless, the punctate appearance of GFP-MAG5/SEC16A was maintained in cells irrespective of the abundance of the marker (i.e., Figure 5D [lower expressing cell] and Figure 5F [higher expressing cell]). We also found that GFP-MAG5/SEC16A partially overlapped with the ER-YK signal (Figure 5E) and to a lesser extent with ERD2-YFP and ST-mRFP (Figures 5C and 5D). MAG5/SEC16A did not overlap with YFP-SYP61 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). The differences in distribution of MAG5/SEC16A and the Golgi marker with respect to a single focal imaging plane could account for an apparent lack of codistribution. To examine this, we performed time-lapse microscopy in cells coexpressing GFP-MAG5/SEC16A and ST-YFP and ensured coincident distribution of the structures labeled by MAG5/SEC16A and the Golgi markers over time (see Supplemental Figure 6 and Supplemental Movie 1 online). To explore the distribution of GFP-MAG5/SEC16A with respect to the ER, we acquired consecutive optical slices of cells coexpressing GFP-MAG5/SEC16A and ER-YK for three-dimensional reconstruction and rendering. GFP-MAG5/SEC16A was surrounded by a cup-shaped subdomain of the ER (Figure 5F). These data indicate that MAG5/SEC16A is localized in structures that are associated with mobile Golgi stacks. To identify MAG5/SEC16A-interacting proteins, extracts from whole seedlings of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing MAG5/SEC16A-GFP under the control of the 35S promoter were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Figure 6A) or silver staining (Figure 6B). Full-length MAG5/SEC16A-GFP and degradation products were concentrated in the precipitates along with other proteins. Linear Trap Quadrupole (LTQ)-Orbitrap mass spectrometry identified MAG5/SEC16A with the highest score (Figure 6C). SEC16B was also listed by the software (see Supplemental Table 1 online), although we could not distinguish any unique peptides of SEC16B. The Arabidopsis genome has two closely related SEC13 genes, SEC13A and SEC13B (CITATION). Interestingly, these SEC13 proteins were detected with the second and third highest scores with high amino acid coverage, and unique peptides were identified for both (Figure 6C; see Supplemental Figure 7 online). [[FIGURE]] The interaction of MAG5/SEC16A with COPII proteins was also examined using a yeast two-hybrid assay. In agreement with the immunoprecipitation analysis, MAG5/SEC16A interacted with SEC13A and SEC13B (Figure 6D). In yeast, Sec13 forms a heterodimer with Sec31 as part of the COPII coat (CITATION; CITATION). The Arabidopsis genome encodes two putative SEC31 orthologs (CITATION). We detected an interaction between MAG5/SEC16A and SEC31A (Figure 6D) and of SEC31A and SEC31B with both SEC13A and SEC13B (see Supplemental Figure 8 online). These results suggest that MAG5/SEC16A functions in concert with COPII components. The dynamic relationship between MAG5/SEC16A and COPII components was analyzed. Plant SEC24, SEC23, SEC13, and SAR1 have all been used as COPII coat markers (CITATION; CITATION, CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Coexpression analyses showed that MAG5/SEC16A fusion proteins had a largely overlapping distribution with YFP-SEC24A and SEC13A-GFP (Figure 7), indicating that the distribution of MAG5/SEC16A within the cell coincides with that of COPII markers. This result, taken together with the association of MAG5/SEC16A with cup-shaped ER, suggests that MAG5/SEC16A could be an ideal marker of the plant ERESs. [[FIGURE]] Next, we compared the dynamics of MAG5/SEC16A and SEC24A. COPII coat proteins are rapidly turned over (associate and dissociate) at ERESs (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In mammalian cells, Sec16 cycles on and off the membrane at a slower rate than other COPII components (CITATION). To compare the dynamics of MAG5/SEC16A with those of COPII coat proteins at plant ERESs, FRAP experiments were conducted in leaf epidermal cells of either the mag5-1 mutant rescued with Pro-MAG5/SEC16A:MAG5/SEC16A-GFP (Figure 8A) or the transgenic line expressing a functional fusion protein of SEC24A (YFP-SEC24A; Figure 8B) (CITATION) using latrunculin B to depolymerize actin (CITATION) and inhibit ERES movement (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Spot-bleach FRAP was conducted as described previously (CITATION; CITATION), and the data were fitted to a single exponential (Figures 8C and 8D). MAG5/SEC16A-GFP cycled on and off ERESs with an average half-time of recovery of 5.99 ± 0.31 s (number of beached ERESs = 13) (Figure 8E). This turnover was significantly slower than that of YFP-SEC24A, which had an average half-time of recovery of 3.13 ± 0.18 s (P < 0.0001; number of bleached ERESs = 15). To compare the availabilities of MAG5/SEC16A-GFP and YFP-SEC24A for cycling on and off ERESs, the mobile fractions of the two fusion proteins were measured. A significantly smaller proportion of MAG5/SEC16A-GFP (53.15 ± 2.15%) was mobile compared with that of YFP-SEC24A (65.77% ± 1.36%) (P < 0.0001; number of bleached ERESs = 13) (Figure 8F). Similar results were obtained from experiments using leaf epidermal cells of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants expressing GFP-MAG5/SEC16A or YFP-SEC24A (Figures 8G to 8L) and from experiments using stable Arabidopsis transformants expressing MAG5/SEC16A-GFP (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). GFP-MAG5/SEC16A had an average half-time of recovery of 4.64 ± 1.00 s, which was much slower than that of YFP-SEC24 (2.02 ± 0.46 s) (Figure 8K). The mobile fraction of GFP-MAG5/SEC16A (57.29% ± 0.62%) was lower than that of YFP-SEC24A (82.35% ± 0.47%) (Figure 8L). These data indicate that ERES protein kinetics is conserved among species (i.e., the COPII coat is turned over more rapidly than MAG5/SEC16A). To test whether deficiency of MAG5/SEC16A affects the membrane associations of COPII components, we prepared microsomal and soluble fractions from wild-type and mag5-1 seedlings expressing SEC13A-GFP or YFP-SEC24A and then subjected these fractions to immunoblot analyses (Figure 9). The fraction of SEC13A-GFP that associated with membranes did not significantly differ between wild-type and mag5-1 seedlings. Similarly, the fraction of YFP-SEC24A that associated with membranes did not significantly differ between wild-type and mag5-1 seedlings. Furthermore, the fraction of endogenous SAR1 protein that associated with membranes did not significantly differ between wild-type and mag5-1 seedlings. Overall, these data suggest that loss of MAG5/SEC16A does not quantitatively affect the membrane association of the COPII coat components to ERESs. [[FIGURE]] Next, we aimed to establish the effects of loss of functional MAG5/SEC16A on the dynamic assembly of COPII coat at ERESs. Therefore, we analyzed the dynamic cycling of inner and outer COPII coat components on and off ERESs in the mag5-1 background by stably expressing fluorescent fusion proteins of SEC13 and SEC24, respectively. FRAP analyses showed that cycling of these two COPII coat components on and off ERESs was significantly faster in the mag5-1 mutant than in wild-type plants (Figure 10). These data indicate that the cycling of COPII components on and off ERESs is higher in the absence of MAG5/SEC16A than in the presence of MAG5/SEC16A, which supports a regulatory role of MAG5/SEC16A in COPII coat assembly at ERESs in plants.

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used as the wild type. Arabidopsis T-DNA–tagged lines were screened as described previously (CITATION). Dry seeds (0.1 mg) from a mixture of one to 20 lines were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then to immunoblot analysis with anti-12S globulin and anti-2S albumin antibodies to detect storage protein precursors. Eight lines (mag mutants) were isolated that abnormally accumulated storage protein precursors. The mag5-1 line described in this article was derived from a pool of T-DNA–tagged lines that was prepared with the Ti plasmid pBI121. The T-DNA insertion mutants were obtained as follows: WiscDsLoxHS202_06C (mag5-2) from The European Arabidopsis Stock Center; SALK_070608 (sec16b-1), SALK_125584 (sec16b-2), and SALK_144775 (sec16b-3) from the ABRC at Ohio State University; and GABI_147G11 (mag5-3) from Genomanalyse im Biologischen System Pflanze (GABI-Kat). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (CITATION). For immunoblotting, we newly generated antibody against 2S albumin, designated as anti-2S3M, using the synthetic peptide (C)AARAVSLQGQHGPFQSRKIY, whose sequence was derived from the mature region of Arabidopsis 2S3 (At4g27160). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and then injected into a rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich Japan). Blots were probed with anti-12S globulin α-subunit (anti-12S, diluted 10,000-fold), (CITATION), anti-2S albumin (anti-2S3M, diluted 5000-fold), anti-GFP (JL-8, diluted 5000-fold; Clontech), anti-VSR1 (diluted 5000-fold; CITATION), anti-AtALEU (diluted 5000-fold; CITATION), or anti-SAR1 (diluted 500-fold; Agrisera) antibodies. Signals were detected with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). For electron microscopy, dry seeds were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR white resin (London Resin), as described previously (CITATION), with a modification in that the fixative contained 10% DMSO. Ultrathin sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (model JEM-1015B; JEOL) at 100 kV. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (CITATION) with the following antibody dilutions: anti-12S, 1: 2000; anti-2S, 1:1000; and AuroProbe EM anti-rabbit IgG (H+T), 1:30 (15-nm gold; GE Healthcare). The mag5-1 homozygous mutant (ecotype Columbia-0) was crossed with ecotype Landsberg erecta plants to generate a mapping population. F2 seeds were obtained by self-fertilization of the F1 plants. To isolate protein and genomic DNA from one seed grain, each F2 seed was individually homogenized in 50 μL of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 1% [w/v] SDS, 0.5% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% [v/v] glycerol). The extracts (15 µL) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to select mag5-1 mutant plants. The genomic DNA of mag5-1 mutant plants was analyzed using a combination of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers and simple sequence length polymorphism markers (CITATION; CITATION) with data obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (http://www.Arabidopsis.org). Approximately 20 recombinant plants from the F2 progeny were screened for the mag5 phenotype for rough mapping. The position of the mag5 gene was mapped to the middle of chromosome 5. For fine-scale mapping, genomic DNA was isolated from 421 F2 plants. The nucleotide sequence was determined from both strands using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator cycle sequence reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer (Prism 3100; Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was isolated from wild-type and mag5 plants using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to reduce genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was performed using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (GE Healthcare) with an oligo(dT)12-18 primer. PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 2 min and 30 to 40 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 45 s or 4 min. The primers used for PCR were provided in Supplemental Table 2 online. ACTIN2 was used as a control (CITATION). The PCR products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel analyzer; Qiagen) or sequencing. The fluorescent proteins used in this study were based on fusion with mGFP5 (CITATION) and enhanced YFP (Clontech). MAG5/SEC16A was subcloned into the binary vector pVKH18-En6 under the control of the constitutive promoter cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CITATION). The coding region of MAG5/SEC16A was amplified by PCR with mRNA from wild-type leaves (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The amplified fragment was inserted into pENTER/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to produce the entry clone (see Supplemental Table 3 online). We performed an L/R recombination reaction to transfer the fragment of the entry clone into the destination vector pFAST R05 (CITATION) for the expression of MAG5/SEC16A-GFP driven by the 35S promoter. ProMAG5/SEC16A:MAG5/SEC16A was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of wild-type plants. The amplified fragment was inserted into pENTER/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to produce the entry clone. Then, the stop codon and 3′ untranslated region of MAG5/SEC16A were deleted (see Supplemental Table 2 online). We performed the L/R recombination reaction to transfer the fragment of the entry clone into the destination vector pGWB4 (CITATION) for the expression of MAG5/SEC16A-GFP driven by the native promoter (see Supplemental Table 3 online). The expression vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101) by electroporation. Wild-type or mag5-1 mutant plants were transformed with Agrobacterium by the floral dip method (CITATION). T1 seeds were selected under the fluorescence stereomicroscope (for T1 seeds carrying pFAST R05) (CITATION) or in a medium containing 30 mg/L of hygromycin (for T1 seeds carrying pGWB4) to establish independent transgenic lines. Four-week-old tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Petit Havana) greenhouse plants grown at 25°C were used for Agrobacterium (strain GV3101)–mediated transient expression (CITATION). The bacterial optical density (OD600) used for plant transformation was 0.05 for all constructs. Fluorescent images were captured with confocal laser scanning microscopes (LSM 510 and LSM780; Carl Zeiss) using line switching mode. For mGFP5 and YFP imaging, settings matched those of earlier studies (CITATION; CITATION). FRAP analyses were conducted as described (CITATION). Single-channel and colocalization analyses were performed using 1 Airy Unit pinhole size. FRAP analyses were performed using fully open pinhole settings. For experiments based on comparative analyses, images were acquired using the same laser intensity, line averaging, and brightness/contrast settings. Postacquisition analyses were performed with Zeiss AIM software. PaintShop Pro software was used for further image processing. For three-dimensional image acquisition and rendering, images were acquired at maximum speed using scan average = 1. Z-stacks were assembled with the Zeiss AIM software and deconvoluted using Image J software (Deconvolution and 3D plug-ins). Cotyledons from 10-d-old plants were treated with 100 µg/mL of brefeldin A for different times and immediately mounted on microscope slide for observation with a confocal microscope. Spot bleaching and quantification of recovery and mobile fraction rates were performed on individual ERESs as described earlier (CITATION; CITATION). Half-time and mobile fraction values represent the average ± sd for 13 to 40 independent spot-bleach experiments per sample. The statistical significance of the experiments was determined using a Student’s two-tailed t test for two samples assuming equal variance. Immunoprecipitation was performed with µMACS epitope tag protein isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). Whole seedlings of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP (1.0 g) or MAG5/SEC16A-GFP (4.0 g) were homogenized on ice in 3 or 12 mL of extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor (complete cocktail tablets; Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 9100g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were mixed with magnetic beads conjugated to an anti-GFP antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixtures were applied to µColumns (Miltenyi Biotec) in a magnetic field to capture the magnetic antigen-antibody complex. After extensive washing with the buffer, immunoaffinity complexes were eluted with 50 μL of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 6% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. For in-gel digestion, the protein components of the immunoprecipitates were separated on a 3-cm-long SDS gel. The gel slice isolated from each lane was cut into three fractions according to molecular mass: a <40-kD fraction, a 40- to 100-kD fraction, and a >100-kD fraction. Each excised gel fraction was treated with 100% (v/v) acetonitrile for 15 min and then dried in a vacuum concentrator. The dried gel was treated with 10 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 56°C for 45 min, followed by 55 mM 2-iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min in darkness. The gel was washed with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and then dried in a vacuum concentrator. The dried gel was treated with 0.01 mg/mL of trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. The digested peptides were recovered with 50 μL 5% (v/v) formic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, followed by 50 μL 5% (v/v) formic acid in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile. The extracted peptides were combined and then evaporated to 10 μL in a vacuum concentrator. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses were performed using the LTQ-Orbitrap XL-HTC-PAL system. Trypsin digests were loaded onto the column (100-µm internal diameter and 15-cm length; L-Column; CERI) using the Paradigm MS4 HPLC pump (Michrom BioResources) and HTC-PAL Autosampler (CTC Analytics) and were eluted by a gradient of 5 to 45% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid for 26 min. The eluted peptides were introduced directly into an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo) with a flow rate of 500 nL/min and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The range of the mass spectrometry scan was mass-to-charge ratio 450 to 1500. The top three peaks were subjected to MS/MS analysis. MS/MS spectra were analyzed by the Mascot server (version 2.3) in house (CITATION) (http://www.matrixscience.com/) and compared with proteins registered in TAIR10 (The Arabidopsis Information Resource). The Mascot search parameters were set as follows: threshold of the ion score cutoff, 0.05; peptide tolerance, 10 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, ±0.8 D; and peptide charge, 2+ or 3+. The search also was set to allow one missed cleavage by trypsin, a carboxymethylation modification of Cys residues, and a variable oxidation modification of Met residues. The coding regions of SEC13A, SEC13B, SEC31A, and SEC31B were amplified by PCR with mRNA from wild-type leaves (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The primers used for cloning of SEC13B were as described (CITATION). The amplified fragments were inserted into pENTER/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to produce the entry clones. We performed an L/R recombination reaction to transfer the fragments of the entry clones into the destination vector either pDEST-GBKT7 or pDEST-GADT7 (CITATION) (see Supplemental Table 3 online). The products, referred to as BD- or AD- in Figure 6D and Supplemental Figure 8 online, were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 strain (Matchmaker III; Clontech). Transformed yeasts were selected on SD/-Leu/-Trp plates and the interactions were examined on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade plates. pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors were used for negative control. The wild-type plants, transgenic plants expressing SEC13A-GFP, transgenic plants expressing YFP-SEC24A (CITATION), mag5-1 plants, mag5-1 plants expressing SEC13A-GFP, and mag5-1 plants expressing YFP-SEC24A were used. The fractionation was performed essentially as described previously (CITATION). Five-day-old seedlings were homogenized in a mortar on ice in triple volume (SEC13A-GFP and SAR1) or double volume (YFP-SEC24A) of buffer (100 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.3 M Suc, and protease inhibitor [complete cocktail tablets; Roche]). The homogenate was filtered through a cell strainer (70 μm) by centrifugation at 20g. An aliquot of the filtrate was used as a total fraction. The filtrate was centrifuged at 1000g and 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000g and 4°C for 1 h to obtain supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fraction. Each of total fractions, P1, P100, and S100, was subjected to immunoblot analysis. The statistical significance of the experiments was determined using a Student’s two-tailed t test for two samples assuming equal variance.
