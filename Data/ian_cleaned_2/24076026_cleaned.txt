!~RES~! Some cystatins and their interacting partners have been reported. For example, barley cystatins were shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to interact with cathepsin l-like proteases in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex CITATION. Here, using full-length AtCYSb as bait in a Y2H screen, we identified several putative interacting proteins, one of which was Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent nuclease (AtCaN2). To confirm the interaction between AtCYSb and AtCaN2, pGBKT7-AtCYSb and pGADT7-AtCaN2 were generated and transformed into Y2HGold cells. As shown in CITATION A, yeast cells grew well and turned blue on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade+X-α-Gal+AbA medium when both AtCYSb and AtCaN2 were present, but not when either plasmid was absent, indicating that AtCYSb and AtCaN2 interact with each other in yeast. To examine whether AtCYSb interacts with AtCaN2 in vitro, a GST pull-down assay was performed. GST-fused AtCYSb (GST-AtCYSb) was bound to resin and mixed with a solution containing His-tagged AtCaN2 (His-AtCaN2). After incubation, GST-AtCYSb was eluted from the resin and His-AtCaN2 in the eluate was analyzed by immunoblotting. Specific signals of His-AtCaN2 were detected only when both AtCYSb and AtCaN2 were present (CITATIONB), indicating that AtCYSb interacts with AtCaN2 in vitro. The interaction between AtCYSb and AtCaN2 in plant cells was examined with a BiFC assay. Green fluorescence was observed when AtCYSb-nGFP and AtCaN2-cGFP were expressed together in onion cells, similar to the GFP signals which were distributed throughout the cytosol (CITATIONC). This result suggests AtCYSb and AtCaN2 interacts each other in the cytosol. Subcellular localization of AtCYSb and AtCaN2 was also examined in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells. The fluorescence signals of AtCYSb-GFP and AtCaN2-GFP were similar to the GFP signals and were distributed throughout the cytosol in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In addition, the GFP control was not only distributed throughout the cytosol, it also appeared in the nuclei or nuclei membrane and probably in the ER (CITATION ). AtCaN2 mRNA expression was observed in different growth stages of Arabidopsis plant tissues. AtCaN2 mRNA was not expressed in young roots and siliques (lanes YR and Ys); the abundance of AtCaN2 mRNA was low in young leaves, stems, and senescent siliques (lanes YL, YS, and Ss), but high in senescent leaves and stems (lanes SS and SL) (CITATION A). Expression of AtCaN2 mRNA under stress was also observed (CITATIONB). For 10mM NaHCO3 stress, AtCaN2 mRNA peaked at 6h, and then began to decline gradually in leaves. AtCaN2 mRNA peaked at 6 and 12h, then declined after treatment in roots. In the presence of 10mM H2O2, AtCaN2 gene expression was induced within 6h after treatment, declined at 12h, and then increased after treatment in leaves. AtCaN2 mRNA expression peaked at 6h and was maintained through 24h after treatment in roots. Under cold stress, AtCaN2 mRNA expression peaked at 24h in leaves and roots. These results show AtCaN2 is involved in the responses to multiple abiotic stresses. The nuclease AtCaN2 degrades nucleic acids CITATION and the interaction between AtCYSb and AtCaN2 was demonstrated by in vitro pull-down assay (CITATIONB) and BiFC (CITATIONC). We considered the possibility that the degradation of nucleic acid carried out by AtCaN2 might be influenced by AtCYSb. To test this hypothesis, the nuclease activity of AtCaN2 against λDNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (CITATION A and B). In the presence of GST-AtCYSb protein alone, λDNA was not degraded (CITATIONA). In the presence of His-AtCaN2 protein alone, λDNA was degraded, with the extent of degradation increasing with time (CITATIONA). However, in the presence of GST-AtCYSb and His-AtCaN2, the activity of AtCaN2 against λDNA was inhibited (CITATIONA). In another experiment, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a control instead of GST-AtCYSb. The λDNA was degraded thoroughly in the presence of His-AtCaN2 alone or in the presence of BSA and His-AtCaN2, indicating that BSA could not inhibit AtCaN2 activity (CITATIONB). Our results suggest AtCaN2 nuclease activity may be directly regulated by AtCYSb in vitro. Abiotic stresses seriously affect plant growth and development, also leading to a series of physiological and molecular changes during plant growth CITATION. The complex plant response to abiotic stress involves many genes and biochemical molecular regulatory mechanisms. In this study, AtCYSb in Arabidopsis cells and seedlings was strongly induced by multiple abiotic stresses and over-expression of AtCYSb in transgenic yeast and Arabidopsis increased resistance to high salt, drought, oxidation, and cold stresses CITATION. AtCaN2 expression was also induced by salt, oxidative, and cold stress (CITATIONB), indicating that AtCaN2 is involved in the responses to multiple abiotic stresses. The interaction between AtCYSb and AtCaN2 was demonstrated by pull-down (CITATIONB) and BIFC (CITATIONC), leading us to speculate that AtCYSb and AtCaN2 participate in the plant stress defense mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction between a cysteine protease inhibitor and a nuclease. Further studies are needed to determine how the interaction between AtCYSb and AtCaN2 is involved in the defense against abiotic stresses. Other cysteine proteinase inhibitors CITATION and nucleases CITATION are involved in various types of PCD, which will also be the focus of our future studies. These results may be important for understanding the plant defense mechanisms against different environmental stresses by genetically modulating the cysteine proteinase inhibitor genes.
!~MM~! Y2H experiments were performed with the Matchmaker™ Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System as described by the manufacturer (Clontech). Mate & Plate™ Library—Universal Arabidopsis was purchased from Clontech. This yeast two-hybrid library was transformed into yeast strain Y187 for mating and screening. The open reading frame (ORF) of AtCYSb was PCR-amplified with primers 5′- GAATTCATGATGAGAAGCCG-3′ and 5′- GGATCCTGTCATGGT GTTGC-3′ (EcoRI and BamHI sites are underlined). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pGBKT7, generating pGBKT7-AtCYSb. This plasmid was used as bait for the Y2H screen. The ORF of AtCaN2 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GAATTCATGGGTAACGCTCT-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGCTATTTCCTTAGT-3′ (EcoRI and SacI sites are underlined). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SacI and cloned into the EcoRI-SacI site of pGADT7, generating pGADT7-AtCaN2. To confirm the result of the Y2H screen, pGBKT7-AtCYSb and pGADT7-AtCaN2 constructs were co-introduced into the yeast strain Y2HGold. After transformation, colonies grown on SD media lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD/-Leu/-Trp) were spotted on SD/-Leu/-Trp and SD media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine and containing Aureobasidin A (AbA), X-α-gal (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade+AbA+X-α-gal) to assess the expression of 4 reporter genes (HIS3, ADE2, AUR1-C, and MEL1) activated by a positive interaction between the proteins of interest. For the in vitro pull-down assay, the ORF of AtCYSb was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GGATCCATGATGAGAAGCCG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTAGTCATGGTGT T-3′ (BamHI and SalI sites are underlined). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI, and cloned into the BamHI-SalI site of the protein expression vector pGEX-6p-3 in-frame to the coding sequence of glutathione S-transferase (GST). The resultant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to induce GST-AtCYSb. Construction of the expression plasmid pQE-30-AtCaN2, expression, and isolation of His-AtCaN2 was performed as described CITATION. Equilibration of the immobilized glutathione resin, immobilization of the GST-AtCYSb protein, capture of the His-AtCaN2 protein, and elution of the “bait-prey” protein were performed with the ProFound™ Pull-Down GST Protein: Protein Interaction Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The elution containing complexed GST-AtCYSb and His-AtCaN2 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting. Signals were detected with CDP-Star (Tropix) using a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-4000 (Fujifilm, Japan). The vector for BiFC was constructed by replacing GFP in pBS-35S-GFP CITATION with the N-terminus (154 aa) or C-terminus (80 aa) of mVenus, yielding pBS-35S:VN154 and pBS-35S:VC80. The ORF of AtCYSb was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-CCCGGGAGAATGATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGTCATGGTGTTG CT-3′ (SmaI and SpeI sites are underlined). The PCR product was digested with SmaI and SpeI and cloned into the SmaI-SpeI site of pBS-35S:VN154, generating pBS-35S: AtCYSb-VN154. pQE-30-AtCaN2 was digested with KpnI and SalI, and the AtCaN2 ORF was inserted into the KpnI-SalI site of pBS-35S:VC80, generating pBS-35S: AtCaN2-VC80. A mixture of an nGFP construct and a cGFP construct (500ng each) were used for particle bombardment to co-express proteins of interest in onion epidermal cells. Images were collected on a confocal scanning-laser imaging system (Olympus Fluoview, FV500). Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as the plant material. Plant tissues at different growth stages were collected for gene expression analysis. For time course analysis of gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings, seeds were geminated and grown at 22°C for 3weeks before treatment. After treatment, the leaves and roots were harvested for Northern blot analyses. Total RNA from Arabidopsis was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (10μg) from Arabidopsis was fractionated on 1% (m/v) agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes. Hybridizations were carried out at 50°C using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes for the coding region of AtCaN2. Hybridization signals were detected with CDP-Star (Tropix) on a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-4000 (Fujifilm, Japan). The ORF of AtCYSb was amplified using the following primer pair: 5′-CCCGGGAGAATGATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGTCATGGTGTTGCT-3′ (SmaI and SpeI sites are underlined), the PCR product was digested with SmaI and SpeI and inserted into the SmaI-SpeI site of the pBI121 (MCS)-GFP, generating pBI121 (MCS)-AtCYSb-GFP. The ORF of AtCaN2 was amplified using the following primer pair: 5′-GGTACCATGGGTAACGCTCT-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTTTCCTTAG TCTA-3′ (KpnI and SalI sites are underlined); the PCR product was digested with KpnI and SalI and inserted into the KpnI-SalI site of pBI121 (MCS)-GFP, generating pBI121 (MCS)-AtCaN2-GFP. pBI121 (MCS)-GFP, pBI121 (MCS)-AtCYSb-GFP, or pBI121 (MCS)-AtCaN2-GFP were introduced stably into Arabidopsis using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral dip CITATION. Protoplasts of transgenic plants were prepared from leaves as described CITATION. Confocal microscopy was performed with a FV500 confocal scanning-laser imaging system (Olympus, Japan). His-AtCaN2 and GST-AtCYSb fusion proteins were purified as described CITATION. The protein concentrations of GST-AtCYSb and His-AtCaN2 were measured using a Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) G-250 reagent and bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard. To measure nuclease activity, approximately 1μg GST-AtCYSb protein and 1μg His-AtCaN2 protein were incubated in 30μl nuclease reaction buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 10mM CaCl2, pH 7.0) containing 0.5μg nucleic acid substrate (λDNA) at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA followed by incubation at 70°C for 10min. The reaction products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. BSA was used in place of GST-AtCYSb in a control experiment using the same reaction conditions.
