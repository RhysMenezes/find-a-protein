!~ABS~! The light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domain that belongs to the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain superfamily is a blue light sensory module. The Arabidopsis thaliana PAS/LOV PROTEIN (PLP) gene encodes three putative blue light receptor proteins, PLPA, PLPB, and PLPC, because of its mRNA splicing variation. PLPA and PLPB each contain one PAS domain at the N-terminal region and one LOV domain at the C-terminal region, while the LOV domain is truncated in PLPC. RNA gel blot analysis showed that PLP mRNA was markedly expressed after exposure to salt or dehydration stress. Yeast two-hybrid screening led to the isolation of VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE 2 (VTC2), VTC2-LIKE (VTC2L), and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 proteins (BLH10A and BLH10B) as PLP-interacting proteins. The molecular interaction of PLPA with VTC2L, BLH10A or BLH10B, and that of PLPB with VTC2L were diminished when yeasts were grown under blue light illumination. Furthermore, the possible binding of flavin chromophore to PLPA and PLPB was demonstrated. These results imply that the LOV domain of PLPA and PLPB functions as a blue light sensor, and suggest the applicability of these interactions to blue light-dependent switching in transcriptional regulation in yeast or other organisms.
!~RES~! There are three PLP splice variants in the annotation database of The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), which we named PLPA, PLPB, and PLPC. PLPA encodes a protein of 397 amino acids while PLPB encodes a protein of 399 amino acids where two amino acids (Ser and Asn) are inserted into the LOV domain. PLPC encodes a protein of 358 amino acids and a frame shift causes deletion of 46 C-terminal amino acids and addition of the last seven amino acids (Fig. 1). Therefore, the LOV domain of PLPC lacks the last β-structure (βE) (Crosson et al. CITATION). A cDNA library of 6.3 × 105 clones was screened by means of the yeast two-hybrid system with PLPA as bait. To construct the cDNA library, a mixture of RNAs prepared from rosette leaves of A. thaliana plants that had been subjected to salt stress and dehydration stress was used, because PLP mRNA was markedly expressed in plants exposed to those stress treatments (Fig. 2). As a result, five clones were isolated for PLP-interacting proteins. Three of them were partial clones for VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE 2 (VTC2, Jander et al. CITATION), and two others were those for VTC2 paralog (VTC2L) and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BLH10) (Hackbusch et al. CITATION). Full-length cDNAs for VTC2 and VTC2L were obtained from RIKEN BRC. BLH10 has two splice variants that were named BLH10A and BLH10B. BLH10A lacks its entire homeodomain, while the homeodomain of BLH10B exists at its C-terminal region. cDNA of BLH10A was obtained from RIKEN BRC while that of BLH10B was obtained by RT-PCR. Interactions of PLPA and PLPB with the full-length proteins of VTC2, VTC2L, BLH10A, and BLH10B were also examined using the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3). PLPA interacted with all four proteins, while PLPB interacted with VTC2 and VTC2L but not with BLH10A or BLH10B. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  Since PLPA and PLPB have an LOV domain, they may function as blue light receptors. The LOV domain of PHOT2 binds its C-terminal protein kinase domain in the absence of blue light (Matsuoka and Tokutomi CITATION). Therefore, the effect of light illumination on the interaction of PLPA and PLPB with their interacting proteins was examined. Interactions of PLPA with VTC2L, BLH10A, and BLH10B, and that of PLPB with VTC2L were diminished or not detected under blue light illumination at 100 μmol m−2 s−1, while those interactions were detected in the dark or under illumination with other light (red, far-red, and green) (Fig. 4). By contrast, interactions of PLPA and PLPB with VTC2 were detected regardless of light conditions. [[FIGURE]]  Next, the effect of blue light intensity on the two-hybrid interaction was examined (Fig. 5). The interaction of PLPA with VTC2L was weakened at 100 μmol m−2 s−1 or higher intensity, while that of PLPB with VTC2L was undetectable at that intensity. The interaction of PLPA with BLH10A was undetectable above 50 μmol m−2 s−1, while that of PLPA with BLH10B was weakened above that intensity. The interaction of PLPA or PLPB with VTC2 was not affected even at 190 μmol m−2 s−1. [[FIGURE]]  To exclude the possibility that PLPs or PLP-interacting proteins were unstable under blue light illumination, the expression of these proteins was detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6). Both PLPA and PLPB were detected with anti-c-Myc antibody, and PLP-interacting proteins were detected with anti-HA antibody in extracts from yeast cells grown in the dark. When yeasts were grown under blue light at the intensity that affected the two-hybrid interactions, no significant difference in protein expression was detected between the presence and absence of blue light. These results indicate that blue light in itself specifically diminishes the interactions of PLPA or PLPB with PLP-interacting protein(s). [[FIGURE]]  To determine if PLPs bind the flavin chromophore and show photochemical reaction, recombinant PLPA and PLPB were prepared using an E. coli system. Figure 7 shows the UV–visible absorption spectra of PLPA (a) and PLPB (b) in solution. Both spectra show an absorption peak at around 450 nm, although the peak in the PLPA spectrum is extremely small. The absorption may be ascribed to oxidized flavin; in particular, the minor peak appearing at 370 nm in the PLPB spectrum supports this notion (Claiborne CITATION). However, these spectra lack vibrational structures in the main peak, which are characteristic of flavin chromophore in proteins, such as the LOV domains of phototropins and FKF1 in the dark state (Salomon et al. CITATION; Zikihara et al. CITATION). Furthermore, the spectra did not exhibit any photoreactivity (data not shown). These observations suggest that the absorption peaks originate in free flavin in solution and not in that bound to the proteins. However, since free flavin could be eliminated during the GST-glutathione region purification procedure, the remaining flavin is concluded to be bound to the proteins at least in the crude extracts from the E. coli system. During the purification procedure, e.g., thrombin cut of GST-tag, bound flavin chromophore was dissociated from the apoprotein. From the absorption spectrum, the ratio of flavin to apoprotein was estimated to be ca. 1% in the PLPB solution. [[FIGURE]]  Next, we examined whether the LOV domains of PLPA and PLPB bind flavin chromophore and show photoreactivity. The LOV domains of PLPA, PLPB, LKP2 (Yasuhara et al. CITATION), and ZTL (Más et al. CITATION), and the PAS domains of PLP were prepared also as GST-fusion proteins. Since the results of the full-length preparation suggest the dissociation of flavin chromophore during the thrombin cut, absorption spectra were measured without this purification procedure. Surprisingly, however, no peak corresponding to the absorption of both free and bound flavin was found in either PLPA-LOV or PLPB-LOV domain solution (see Fig. S1a in electronic supplementary material). Both domains were associated with large amounts of molecular chaperones, particularly GroEL, compared with the preparation of LKP2-LOV or ZTL-LOV domain (Fig. S2 in electronic supplementary material) that binds photoreactive flavin (Fig. S1a, b in electronic supplementary material). These findings suggest that the LOV domains of both PLPA and PLPB are folded improperly in the protein moiety, and this may explain the weak binding of flavin to these LOV domains. The possibility that the PAS domain binds flavin was excluded, based on the absorption spectra (Fig. S1a, b in electronic supplementary material).
!~MM~!  Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia accession was grown on germination medium (GM) containing 0.8% agar under long-day conditions of 16 h light and 8 h dark at 22°C (Valvekens et al. CITATION; Kiyosue et al. CITATION). Stress treatments (cold, dry, NaCl, and ABA) were performed according to Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki (CITATION) using three-week-old plants for 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from whole rosette plants of A. thaliana harvested before or after the stress treatment described above, separated on agarose gel containing formamide, and transferred on to a Nylon membrane, as previously reported (Kiyosue et al. CITATION). A digoxigenin-11-dUTP (DIG-dUTP)-labeled RNA probe prepared from the full-length coding region of PLPB was used for hybridization according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Chemiluminescence signals were generated with a CDP-Star visualization kit (GE Healthcare UK, Buckinghamshire, UK) and detected with a light capture system (Model AE-6955: ATTO, Japan). Plasmid DNA templates for sequencing were prepared and DNA sequences were determined as described previously (Yasuhara et al. CITATION). GENETYX (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan) and Sequencher (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) software systems were used for DNA sequence analysis.  PLPA cDNA (AB038798) was isolated by screening cDNA libraries (CD4-13, CD4-14, CD4-15, and CD4-16) (Kieber et al. CITATION) using a PCR fragment for the LOV domain that had been amplified by PCR from T20F6 BAC DNA. PLPA cDNA was PCR amplified with primers containing a BamHI site, subcloned into pCR2TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), digested with BamHI, ligated in frame to pGBK-T7 vector, and sequenced for verification. Full-length cDNAs of PLPB (AT2G02710), VTC2 (AT4G26850), VTC2L (AT5G55120), and BLH10A (AT1G19700) were obtained from RIKEN BRC. BLH10B cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR. Each gene was amplified by PCR to attach appropriate restriction enzyme cleavage sites, subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), sequenced entirely, and inserted into pGADT7. The following primers were used for PCR: 5′-AGAGTCTGTATGTTGAAAATCAAAAGAGTT-3′ and 5′-AGAGCTCTCACTGAAGGACAAGGCACTCGG-3′ for VTC2; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTTGTTGAAGATCAAAAGA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAATTAGAGACAGCCTCTTCTT-3′ for VTC2L; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGCAGTTTATTACACAAGT-3′ for BLH10A and BLH10B forward primers; 5′-AGGATCCCTAACAATCTGAATTTGTTCCTT-3′ for BLH10A reverse primer; and 5′-AGGATCCTCACACAACAAAGTCGTGTAAGT-3′ for BLH10B reverse primer. Construction of the cDNA library and subsequent two-hybrid screening were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Matchmaker Library Construction and Screening Kit, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), using RNA isolated from rosette leaves of A. thaliana plants that had been exposed to salt or dehydration stress for 10 h. The two-hybrid assay was performed as described elsewhere (Yasuhara et al. CITATION). To test the effect of various light conditions, yeast colonies were cultured under blue, green, red, and far-red light illumination at an intensity of 100 μmol m−2 s−1 (LED System, Sanyo, Osaka, Japan). For immunoblot analysis, yeast cells were grown on SD-Leu, Trp agar medium for 4 days at 30°C in the dark or under blue light illumination at appropriate intensities. A similar number of cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were resuspended in 400 μL extraction buffer (40 mmol L−1 Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 8 mol L−1 urea, 5% SDS, 0.1 mmol L−1 EDTA, 0.4 mg mL−1 bromophenol blue, 0.8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 6.2 μg mL−1 pepstatin A, 1.86 μmol L−1 leupeptin, 9.0 mmol L−1 benzamidine, 23.0 μg mL−1 aprotinin, and 0.77 mg mL−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized. Crude cell extract (12 μL) was loaded on to each lane and proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and electro-transferred on to PVDF membranes. Protein blots were incubated with anti-c-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody and detected with ECL (GE Healthcare UK). Full-length coding regions of PLPA and PLPB were cloned into a pGEX4T3 expression vector (GE Healthcare UK) as a fusion protein with GST. The following primers were used for PCR: PLP forward: 5′-AGGATCCATGTCCTTAACGAAATCTTCAGA-3′, reverse: 5′-AGTCGACTTAGCATGTCACCATCAATGAGC-3′. PLPA and PLPB proteins with Gly–Ser at the N-terminus were prepared using the Escherichia coli expression (E. coli) system under dim red light illumination, as described elsewhere (Zikihara et al. CITATION) except that the induction was performed with 0.2 mmol L−1 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18°C and that the purification by gel-filtration column chromatography was omitted. The purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Microcon YM-10 instrument (Millipore), and stored at 4°C until use. UV–visible absorption spectra of the sample solutions were acquired with a UV-3310 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature (25°C). Irradiation of sample solutions in a cell fitted into the cell holder of the spectrophotometer was performed with an array of blue-light-emitting diodes (λ max = 468 nm, 100 μmol m−2 s−1) for 30 s.
