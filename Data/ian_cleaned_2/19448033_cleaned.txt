!~ABS~! The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway plays an important role in the regulation of Na+/K+ ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previously, we reported that the calcium binding proteins SOS3 and SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCaBP8) nonredundantly activate the protein kinase SOS2. Here, we show that SOS2 phosphorylates SCaBP8 at its C terminus but does not phosphorylate SOS3. In vitro, SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8 was enhanced by the bimolecular interaction of SOS2 and SCaBP8 and did not require calcium ions. In vivo, this phosphorylation was induced by salt stress, occurred at the membrane, stabilized the SCaBP8-SOS2 interaction, and enhanced plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity. When a Ser at position 237 in the SCaBP8 protein (the SOS2 phosphorylation target) was mutated to Ala, SCaBP8 was no longer phosphorylated by SOS2 and the mutant protein could not fully rescue the salt-sensitive phenotype of the scabp8 mutant. By contrast, when Ser-237 was mutated to Asp to mimic the charge of a phosphorylated Ser residue, the mutant protein rescued the scabp8 salt sensitivity. These data demonstrate that calcium sensor phosphorylation is a critical component of SOS pathway regulation of salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! The SOS3 and SCaBP8 calcium sensors have been shown to specifically function in the salt stress response of Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION) but perform unique functions in the regulation of SOS2. One possible mechanism underlying this difference in regulation is that the SCaBP8 protein may require an additional modification, such as phosphorylation by SOS2. To test this, we monitored SOS2 phosphorylation of SOS3 or SCaBP8 in vitro and, surprisingly, found that SOS2 phosphorylated SCaBP8 but not SOS3 (Figure 1A ). SCaBP8L, a mis-spliced cDNA of SCaBP8 that retains the seventh intron and encodes a 211–amino acid protein truncated at its C terminus (CITATION), was not phosphorylated by SOS2 (Figure 1A), indicating that the phosphorylation site in SCaBP8 is located in its C terminus. Because SCaBP8 is a calcium binding protein that is thought to sense calcium signals triggered by salt stress to activate SOS2 (CITATION; CITATION), we determined if calcium is required for SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8. To do this, 0.5 mM calcium or 5 mM EGTA were included in the SOS2 kinase assays. The results indicate that phosphorylation is not enhanced by the presence of calcium (Figure 1B). [[FIGURE]] To determine the SOS2 phosphorylation site in SCaBP8, we generated three additional SCaBP8 truncated proteins with C-terminal deletions: glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SCaBP81-201, GST-SCaBP81-213, and GST-SCaBP81-234 (Figure 1C). None of these proteins were phosphorylated by SOS2 (Figure 1D). These results indicated that the phosphorylation site must be in the last 12 amino acids of the SCaBP8 C terminus as the SCaBP81-234 construct had only these 12 amino acids removed. To map the phosphorylation site, we mutated all of the Ser and Thr residues in this region to Ala. When Ser-237 was changed to Ala (SCaBP8S237A), the mutant protein was no longer phosphorylated by SOS2 (Figure 1E). As a control, Thr-242 was also mutated to Ala. While SCaBP8T242A was still phosphorylated by SOS2, the double mutant SCaBP8S237A/T242A (containing both the T242A and S237A mutations) was not (Figure 1E). Our results demonstrate that Ser-237 is the only amino acid phosphorylated by SOS2 in vitro. When we compared the C-terminal sequences of the SCaBP/CBL family members, Ser-237 was found to be conserved in eight of the SCaBP proteins, including SOS3 (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). SCaBP8 has been shown to interact with SOS2 via a FISL motif in the SOS2 kinase (CITATION). Deletion of this motif or a change in a Thr in the SOS2 kinase loop to Asp (T/D) has been shown to increase SOS2 activity (CITATION). To test if the interaction between SCaBP8 and SOS2 is required for phosphorylation, recombinant SOS2 protein, SOS2 protein with the FISL motif deleted (SOS2DF), and SOS2 protein with the combined FISL deletion and T/D change (SOS2T/DDF) were used in our in vitro kinase assays. SOS2T/DDF had the highest activity both in terms of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the substrate Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), followed by SOS2DF and SOS2 (Figures 2A and 2B ). These results are consistent with data described by CITATION. However, when SCaBP8 was used as a substrate, the SCaBP8 phosphorylation level was significantly higher in the assay with wild-type SOS2 protein compared with the assays with SOS2DF or SOS2T/DDF protein (Figures 2C and 2D). These data suggest that, while SOS2-SCaBP8 interaction is not essential for SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8, this interaction dramatically enhances the phosphorylation. Additional support for this conclusion came from experiments in which we added FISL peptide to our SOS2-SCaBP8 kinase assays. The results showed that blocking the SOS2–SCaBP8 interaction with added FISL peptide significantly reduced SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8 (Figures 2C and 2D). [[FIGURE]] To determine if SCaBP8 is phosphorylated by SOS2 in planta, phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with the chemically synthesized phosphorylated peptide C-TAFPpSFIFNTE-NH2 (phosphorylated form). To select the phospho-specific antibodies, the serum was first incubated with the phosphopeptides that had been coupled to SulfoLink resin. After washing the column, the phospho-specific antibodies were eluted at pH 2.7 and immediately neutralized. The antibodies were then run over a column containing the unphosphorylated polypeptide C-TAFPSFIFNTE-NH2 to remove antibodies not specific for the phosphoserine. The flow-through was collected and characterized (CITATION). To evaluate the specificity of the antibodies for the Ser-237 phosphorylation site, SCaBP8 proteins were incubated with SOS2 protein in kinase buffer in the presence or absence of ATP. The proteins were then separated using SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. A strong cross-reaction was detected only when SCaBP8 was incubated with both SOS2 and ATP (Figure 3A ). In the absence of ATP, a very weak signal appeared only after a significantly longer exposure. These results suggest that the antibodies specifically recognize phosphorylated Ser-237 in SCaBP8. [[FIGURE]] To examine SCaBP8 phosphorylation in vivo, we generated 35S:6myc-SCaBP8, 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237A, and 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237D transgenic lines in wild-type Arabidopsis (Columbia-0 [Col-0] background) and 35S:6myc-SCaBP8 transgenic lines in the sos2 mutant background. Total proteins were extracted from 10-d-old seedlings of these four transgenic lines and subjected to immunoblots using either anti-myc or anti-phosphoserine237 antibodies. Anti-cmyc (anti-myc) antibody readily detected myc-labeled SCaBP8 in all transgenic plants, but no signal was observed when anti-phosphoserine237 antibodies were used. Because the SOS pathway specifically functions in the response of Arabidopsis to growth in salt, we reasoned that SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8 might be induced by salt stress. To test this, transgenic plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl or water for 12 h, and proteins were extracted and assayed by immunoblotting. The phosphoserine237 signal was detected only in protein extracts from wild-type plants expressing myc-SCaBP8 treated with NaCl (Figures 3B and 3C). No phosphoserine237 signal was seen in wild-type plants expressing either myc-SCaBP8S237D or myc-SCaBP8S237A (Figure 3B) or in sos2 mutant plants expressing myc-SCaBP8 (Figure 3C). Nearly equal amounts of myc-SCaBP8, myc-SCaBP8S237A, or myc-SCaBP8S237D protein were present in the assays as demonstrated by immunoblots with anti-myc antibodies (Figures 3B and 3C). Our data demonstrate that SOS2 specifically phosphorylates SCaBP8S237 and that this phosphorylation is induced by salt stress. To further determine whether the phosphorylation is specific to NaCl stress, the 35S:6myc-SCaBP8 transgenic plants in the wild-type background were treated with NaCl, KCl, or mannitol. Immunoblots showed that phosphorylation was detected only after NaCl treatment even when similar amounts of myc-SCaBP8 protein were present in each treatment (Figure 3D). To determine if calcium affects this phosphorylation, transgenic plants were treated with 5 or 50 mM CaCl2, and proteins were analyzed by immunoblot assays. Calcium treatment did not significantly enhance phosphorylation (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8 reached a maximum level at NaCl concentrations between 150 and 200 mM and declined at higher NaCl concentrations (Figure 3E). The SCaBP8 phosphorylation level increased gradually with longer NaCl treatments (Figure 3F). SCaBP8 recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane in yeast and Arabidopsis (CITATION). To determine if SOS2 phosphorylates membrane-bound SCaBP8, the 35S:6myc-SCaBP8 transgenic plants were treated with NaCl, and membrane and soluble proteins were isolated and used in immunoblot assays with anti-phosphoserine237 antibody. The phosphorylation of SCaBP8S237 was detected in total protein extract and in the membrane protein fraction, but not in the soluble protein fraction (Figure 4A ). Arabidopsis AHA2 and MAPK3 antibodies were used as markers to label the membrane and soluble fractions, respectively. Using anti-myc antibodies, myc-SCaBP8 protein was detected in all three fractions. These results suggest that the phosphorylated SCaBP8 protein is membrane bound. [[FIGURE]] Previously, we demonstrated that a 25–amino acid hydrophobic domain in the N terminus of SCaBP8 is required for plasma membrane localization in yeast and onion cells (CITATION). To determine the importance of plasma membrane localization for SCaBP8 function in salt tolerance, we removed this peptide from SCaBP8 (SCaBP8DN) using PCR-based mutagenesis. The truncated protein was fused to a myc-tag, expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, and transformed into wild type and the scabp8 mutant. T2 seed from >50 independent T1 transgenic lines in the scabp8 background were tested for salt tolerance; none could rescue the mutant phenotype, suggesting that this peptide is essential for SCaBP8 function in salt tolerance (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). To further demonstrate that this peptide is essential for SCaBP8 localization to the membrane in Arabidopsis, we separated membrane and soluble protein fractions from the transgenic plants expressing SCaBP8DN. The myc-SCaBP8DN protein could be detected in the total protein extract and soluble protein fraction but was below detection levels in the membrane fraction (Figure 4A). When we examined the phosphorylation status of SCaBP8DN in transgenic scabp8 plants, the phosphorylated protein was also below the level of detection (Figure 4B). As a control, we purified SCaBP8DN and SOS2 proteins from Escherichia coli, incubated them in kinase buffer with or without ATP, and analyzed the phosphorylation using our anti-phosphoserine237 antibodies. As shown in Figure 4C, SOS2 phosphorylated SCaBP8DN in vitro. Together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation event occurs after SCaBP8 reaches the membrane. Additional support for SCaBP8 phosphorylation after it reaches the membrane came from studies in which we demonstrated that phosphorylation of SCaBP8 is not required for targeting to the plasma membrane. These studies were based on analysis of the subcellular localization of SCaBP8S237A and SCaBP8S237D mutant proteins in yeast using the Sos Recruitment System (CITATION). This system can monitor the interaction between a plasma membrane–located protein and a cytoplasmic protein fused to the human hSos protein, a functional homolog of the yeast Ras GEF CDC25. When two proteins interact at the plasma membrane, the human hSos protein restores Ras activation and rescues the thermosensitive yeast mutant cdc25-2 (CITATION). We have shown previously that SCaBP8 recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane of yeast (CITATION). Mutant proteins SCaBP8S237A and SCaBP8S237D were coexpressed with the reporter fusion protein SOS2:hSos to test whether recruitment of the protein kinase to the plasma membrane was affected by mutation of Ser-237 in SCaBP8. As shown in Supplemental Figure 4 online, the S237A and S237D mutations did not significantly affect the targeting of SCaBP8 to the plasma membrane or the recruitment of SOS2. Moreover, when the targeting of SCaBP8 and SCaBP8S237A to the plasma membrane was monitored directly in the presence of the wild-type SOS2 protein or an inactive SOS2 kinase (with a mutation in an essential Lys residue at position 40; SOS2K40N), no difference in subcellular localization was found. To determine if phosphorylation of SCaBP8 at Ser-237 is required for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, we transformed 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237A and 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237D into the scabp8 mutant. T2 seed from >100 independent T1 transgenic lines from each transformation were tested for their growth in salt. In 93 lines out of a total of 112 independent transgenic lines harboring SCaBP8S237D, the salt-sensitive phenotype was completely suppressed. Partial rescue was seen in 14 lines, while scapb8 mutant levels of sensitivity were seen in only five lines. These numbers are comparable to the complementation rates reported previously for the 35SP:SCaBP8 construct (CITATION). These results suggest that mimicking the phosphorylation status of Ser-237 made SCaBP8 fully functional in Arabidopsis. By contrast, no transgenic line was found among 121 T2 lines harboring SCaBP8S237A in which the salt-sensitive phenotype of scabp8 was fully suppressed. Complementation was partial in 78 lines and negligible in the remaining 43 lines. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of SCaBP8 is essential for salt tolerance (Figure 5 ). RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of SCaBP8 was similar in the 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237A, 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237D, and 35S:6myc-SCaBP8DN transgenic lines (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), demonstrating that differences in complementation were not due to differences in levels of transgene expression. [[FIGURE]] To uncover the biological function of SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8, we determined whether phosphorylation affected the ability of SCaBP8 to bind calcium and to interact with, activate, or recruit SOS2 to the plasma membrane. In vitro, we did not detect a significant difference between SCaBP8 and SCaBP8S237A in calcium binding assays or the activation of SOS2. In yeast, both SCaBP8 and SCaBP8S237A recruited SOS2 to the plasma membrane (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). However, in yeast two-hybrid assays, mutation of Ser to Ala in SCaBP8S237A significantly decreased the interaction between the mutant protein and SOS2 when compared with wild-type SCaBP8 (Figure 6A ). By contrast, the SCaBP8S237D mutation, which mimics a phosphorylated Ser residue, enhanced the interaction with SOS2 (Figure 6A). These interaction differences were not due to differences in levels of SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237A, or SCaBP8S237D expression (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). To examine this interaction in planta, we generated 35S:6myc-SOS2 transgenic plants and transformed 35S:3flag-SCaBP8, 35S:3flag-SCaBP8S237A, or 35S:3flag-SCaBP8S237D into protoplasts of a T3 homozygous line expressing 35S:6myc-SOS2 (CITATION). Protein extracts were sonicated, myc-SOS2 was immunoprecipitated, and flag-SCaBP8 was detected via immunoblot analysis. In comparison to SCaBP8 and SCaBP8S237D, the amount of SCaBP8S237A protein pulled down by SOS2 was substantially reduced (Figure 6B). [[FIGURE]] SCaBP8 recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane, and this complex activates SOS1 in yeast (CITATION). To determine if phosphorylation of SCaBP8 affects the capacity of the SCaBP8-SOS2 complex to activate SOS1, yeast cells expressing SOS1 and SOS2 were transformed with empty vector or the SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237A, or SCaBP8S237D construct. The transformed yeast strains were incubated on AP media containing 200 or 300 mM NaCl for 3 d (Figure 7A ). SCaBP8S237D in combination with SOS2 activated SOS1 to levels similar to what has been seen for the wild-type SCaBP8-SOS2 complex. However, the activity of SOS1, measured as yeast growth in NaCl, was significantly reduced when SCaBP8S237A mutant protein was used (Figure 7A). These results suggest that full activation of SOS1 by SCaBP8-SOS2 requires the phosphorylation of SCaBP8. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether SCaBP8 affects the activity of SOS1 in Arabidopsis, Na+-induced dissipation of a pH gradient (ΔpH), which is monitored by a Na+-induced increase in quinacrine fluorescence that is positively related to Na+/H+ exchange activity, was examined. Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from 5-week-old plants of the wild type and the scabp8 mutant treated with 250 mM NaCl for 3 d. As shown in Figures 7B and 7C, plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiport activity was reduced in scabp8 plants compared with the wild type. The initial rate of dissipation of ΔpH by 100 mM NaCl was 75 units/min/mg protein in wild-type plants compared with 55 units/min/mg protein in scabp8. Over a range of NaCl concentrations between 0 and 100 mM, plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiport activity was consistently lower in scabp8 than in the wild type. Together with our yeast data, reduced Na+/H+ transport activity in scabp8 plants demonstrates that SCaBP8 is involved in the regulation of SOS1 activity. Next, we analyzed whether the phosphorylation of SCaBP8 also affects SOS1 activity. Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from the scabp8 mutant, and purified SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237D, or SCaBP8S237A protein was added to the Na+/H+ antiport assays. In the presence of 250 ng/mL SCaBP8, Na+/H+ antiport activity in scabp8 plants was slightly higher than activity in wild-type plants (Figure 7). Stimulation of Na+/H+ antiport activity in scabp8 mutant vesicles by SCaBP8S237D was greater than of SCaBP8; however, little effect of SCaBP8S237A was observed. Boiled recombinant SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237D, or SCaBP8S237A proteins did not have any effect on antiport activity. These data demonstrate that the phosphorylation of SCaBP8 is critical for the regulation of plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiport activity.
!~MM~! To produce SCaBP8L, SCaBP81-201, SCaBP81-213, SCaBP81-234, SCaBP8S237A, SCaBP8T242A, and SCaBP8S237AT242A GST fusion proteins, the DNA fragments were amplified with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The SOS2 FISL motif was amplified from the pGEX-2TK-SOS2 plasmid using the primer pairs 5′-CGGGATCCATGATGAATGCCTTTGAGATG-3′ and 5′-AGCGTCGACTCAGTCAAATAGTGCAGATAAA-3′. These PCR products were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector at the BamHI and SalI sites. All primers and plasmid constructs used in these studies are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. All constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The recombinant proteins (including SCaBP8, SOS3, and SOS2) were purified with glutathione sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Kinase buffer included 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ATP, and 1 mM DTT. Kinase assays (total volume of 20 μL) were started by adding 1 μg protein and 0.5 μL of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi), and the mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 30 min (CITATION). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 6× SDS loading buffer and were incubated at 95°C for 5 min. The proteins were separated using 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 followed by exposure to a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were captured by a Typhoon 9410 phosphor imager (Amersham Biosciences), and signals were quantified by ImageQuant 5.0 software. Anti-phosphoserine237 polyclonal antibodies were made by AbMart (www.ab-mart.com.cn). Two 9–amino acid peptides (corresponding to amino acids 232 to 243 of SCaBP8) with N-terminal Cys residues, C-TAFPpSFIFNTE-NH2 (phosphorylated form) and C-TAFPSFIFNTE-NH2 (nonphosphorylated form), were also synthesized by AbMart. The Ser-237 phosphospecific peptide (C-TAFPpSFIFNTE-NH2) was used to produce polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies, and the nonphosphorylated peptide (C-TAFPSFIFNTE-NH2) was used for screening and purification. 35S:6myc-SCaBP8, 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237A, 35S:6myc-SCaBP8S237D, and 35S:6myc-SCaBP8DN plasmids were constructed by excising the DNA fragments with BamHI and SalI from GST-SCaBP8, GST-SCaBP8S237A, GST-SCaBP8S237D, and GST-SCaBP8DN plasmids and cloning them into the pCAMBIA1307-6myc binary vector downstream of the myc tag. The resulting constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, scabp8, or the sos2 mutant. T3 homozygous lines were treated with different concentrations of NaCl for the times indicated or with 100 mM KCl or 100 mM mannitol for 12 h. Plant protein was extracted using 2× cold extraction buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2× protease inhibitor (Roche), and 2× phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). The resulting samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with primary anti-SCaBP8-phosphoserine237 or anti-cmyc (Sigma-Aldrich; M4439) antibodies, and chemiluminescence signals were detected by film. Transgenic plants were homogenized with extraction buffer. Total crude homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 10,000g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 4°C for 60 min at 140,000g to generate microsomal membrane (a mixture of small membrane vesicles and fragments arising from the plasma membrane, tonoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus) and soluble protein fractions. Seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis, transgenic plants, and the scabp8 mutant were sterilized in a solution containing 20% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed five times with sterile water, and sown on MS medium with 0.6% (w/v) Phytagel agar (Sigma-Aldrich). The plates were placed at 4°C for 2 d, and then the seeds were germinated vertically at 23°C under continual illumination. Four-day-old seedlings were transferred onto MS medium with salts added as described. SOS2 coding sequence was amplified with the following primers: 5′-TGGAATTCATGACAAAGAAAATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAAAACGTGATTGTTCTGAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then cloned into pGADT7. SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237A, and SCaBP8S237D were amplified from the GST-SCaBP8, GST-SCaBP8S237A, and GST-SCaBP8S237D plasmids with the primer pairs 5′-TGGAATTCATGGAACAAGTTTCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-AGCGTCGACTCAGTCTTCAACCTCAGTGTT-3′ and cloned into pGBKT7 with EcoRI and SalI. Yeast strain AH109 expressing pGADT7-SOS2 (prey) was transformed with pGBKT7-SCaBP8, pGBKT7-SCaBP8S237A, or pGBKT7-SCaBP8S237D (baits). Transformed yeast cells were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking Trp and Leu. Empty prey or bait vector was transformed with SOS2 or different SCaBP8 proteins as negative controls. Interaction was determined on synthetic complete medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and supplemented with 2.5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma-Aldrich). All bait proteins were tested for self-activation; none were found to activate the two reporter genes His3 or LacZ. The coding sequences of SOS2, SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237A, and SCaBP8S237D were translationally fused downstream of the c-myc or flag tags and cloned into the pCAMBIA1205 vector. The plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. After overnight incubation, the protoplasts were lysed, sonicated, and centrifuged. Ten microliters of anti-myc agarose conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with the extract supernatant overnight at 4°C. After washing five times in 1 mL of extraction buffer, the coimmunoprecipitation products were detected via immunoblot analysis. Both anti-myc (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-flag (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilutions, and chemiluminescence signals were detected by film. Plasma membrane–enriched vesicles were isolated from 5-week-old plants using aqueous two-phase partitioning as described by CITATION. All steps were performed at 4°C or on ice. Plants were homogenized in isolation buffer containing 0.33 M sucrose, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM ascorbate, 0.2% (w/v) casein, 0.6% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1 mM PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor, and 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Two to four milliliters of homogenization buffer were used per gram of tissue. The homogenate was filtered through one layer of miracloth and centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min. The supernatant then was centrifuged for 50 min at 80,000g to obtain a microsomal pellet that was resuspended in a buffer containing 0.33 M sucrose, 3 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor, and 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8. The suspension was added to a phase mixture to obtain a phase system consisting of 6.2% (w/w) Dextran T-500 and 6.2% (w/w) polyethylene glycol 3350 in 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, buffer containing 0.33 M sucrose and 3 mM KCl. The final upper phases were collected, diluted with resuspension buffer containing 0.33 M sucrose, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor, and 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and centrifuged for 50 min at 100,000g. The resulting pellet was collected and resuspended with the above-described resuspension buffer containing 1 mM EDTA. Na+/H+ antiport activity was measured as a Na+-induced dissipation of the pH gradient (ΔpH; i.e., a Na+-induced increase in quinacrine fluorescence) as described by CITATION. Recombinant SCaBP8, SCaBP8S237D, or SCaBP8S237A protein (250 ng/mL) was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with plasma membrane vesicles isolated from scabp8 mutant plants. An inside-acid ΔpH was formed in the vesicles by the activity of the H+-ATPase and measured as a decrease (quench) in the fluorescence of quinacrine (a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe). Assays (2 mL) contained 5 μM quinacrine, 3 mM MgSO4, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM 1,3-bis[Tris(hydroxylmethyl)methylamino]propane-HEPES, pH 6.5, 250 mM mannitol, and 50 μg/mL of plasma membrane protein. Reactions were mixed by inversion several times and then placed in a dark chamber in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500). Reactions were equilibrated in the dark with stirring for 5 min before beginning fluorescence readings. The assay was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 3 mM, and formation of ΔpH was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 430 and 500 nm, respectively. When the maximum ΔpH was formed (reached steady state), NaCl was added to initiate Na+ transport. At the end of each reaction, 10 μM (final concentration) of the protonophore m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to dissipate any remaining ΔpH. Specific activity was calculated by dividing the initial rate by the mass of plasma membrane protein in the reaction (Δ%F/min per mg of protein). Unless indicated, all data represent means ± se of at least three replicate experiments.
