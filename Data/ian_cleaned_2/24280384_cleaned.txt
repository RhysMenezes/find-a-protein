!~ABS~! Apical growth in pollen tubes (PTs) is associated with the presence of tip-focused ion gradients and fluxes, implying polar localization or regulation of the underlying transporters. The molecular identity and regulation of anion transporters in PTs is unknown. Here we report a negative gradient of cytosolic anion concentration focused on the tip, in negative correlation with the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. We hypothesized that a possible link between these two ions is based on the presence of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs). We characterized anion channels and CPK transcripts in PTs and analyzed their localization. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tagging of a homolog of SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED1 (SLAH3:YFP) was widespread along PTs, but, in accordance with the anion efflux, CPK2/CPK20/CPK17/CPK34:YFP fluorescence was strictly localized at the tip plasma membrane. Expression of SLAH3 with either CPK2 or CPK20 (but not CPK17/CPK34) in Xenopus laevis oocytes elicited S-type anion channel currents. Interaction of SLAH3 with CPK2/CPK20 (but not CPK17/CPK34) was confirmed by Förster-resonance energy transfer fluorescence lifetime microscopy in Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in living PTs. Compared with wild-type PTs, slah3-1 and slah3-2 as well as cpk2-1 cpk20-2 PTs had reduced anion currents. Double mutant cpk2-1 cpk20-2 and slah3-1 PTs had reduced extracellular anion fluxes at the tip. Our studies provide evidence for a Ca2+-dependent CPK2/CPK20 regulation of the anion channel SLAH3 to regulate PT growth.
!~RES~! In lily and tobacco, pollen tube growth is associated with quasi-steady or oscillatory anion effluxes at the tip, always correlated with growth rate; furthermore, the large efflux at the tip is accompanied by a steady, nonoscillatory anion influx behind the tip (>10 to 15 µm; CITATION). From the chemo-osmotic point of view, the rapid anion flux variations associated with the pollen tube tip favor a passive anion channel–driven ion translocation mechanism rather than a carrier-driven transport. To investigate the physiological role of Cl− in pollen tube growth, we measured N. tabacum pollen tube diameters under various extracellular anion concentrations. The pollen tube diameter increased during an increase in extracellular Cl− concentration from 0.4 to 1, 10, 25, and finally 50 mM Cl−. In seven time-series experiments of the same Cl− concentration series, the tube diameters were 10.2 ± 1.3 µm, 10.3 ± 1.5 µm, 10.8 ± 1.1 µm, 11.2 ± 1.0 µm, and 12.0 ± 0.9 µm, respectively. The diameter increased by 18% in 50 mM Cl− compared with the 0.4 mM control medium. We thus hypothesized that the extracellular anion concentration changes feedback on cytosolic anion homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we performed live-cell imaging experiments on biolistically transformed N. tabacum pollen tubes. We expressed the genetic anion-sensitive probe Chloride-Sensor to monitor changes in anion level (CITATION). This cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) based FRET sensor for anions has a relatively high anion sensitivity (Kapp ∼30 mM) in contrast with previous genetically encoded anion sensors (CITATION). Chloride-Sensor–expressing tobacco pollen tubes were exposed to an increase in extracellular chloride concentration. False color–coded ratio images of such a pollen tube recording are exemplified in the time series displayed in Figure 1A (see Supplemental Movie 1 online). To visualize the dynamic anion distribution of the whole time-series experiment, we generated a kymograph of the pollen tube ratio signal (Figure 1B). A kymograph is an intuitive way to present ratio intensity dynamics in one dimension over time. Standard growth conditions with 0.4 mM Cl− in the medium revealed a cytosolic anion gradient. High ratio values, symbolizing high anion concentrations, were apparent in the region 20 to 50 µm behind the tip. In contrast, the tip and subapical region (0 to 10 µm behind the tip) as well as the base of the tube (≥50 µm behind the tip) revealed a relatively low ratio value (Figures 1A and 1B). This anion distribution pattern was maintained during an increase in extracellular chloride concentration (1, 10, 25, and 50 mM Cl−), but the overall ratio intensity signal increased in stepwise fashion after each gradual concentration increase (Figures 1A and 1B). The application of 25 µM 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB), an efficient anion channel blocker (CITATION), resulted in a dramatic decrease in ratio signal, growth arrest (Figures 1A and 1B), and, eventually, pollen tube death. Interestingly, pronounced growth oscillations were observed after the application of ≥10 mM chloride, symbolized by the alternating modification of the kymograph slope (Figure 1B), as indicated by the arrows in Figure 1C. A detailed analysis of pollen tube growth velocity (red) and apical cytosolic anion concentration ([anion]cyt, black) in Figure 1D demonstrates an apparent correlation in terms of period, and that these periods are in counter-phase. A burst of growth was always accompanied by a decrease of the tip-focused ratio value, equivalent to a decrease in anion concentration in the pollen tube tip (Figure 1D). This observation is in line with vibrating probe studies using anion-selective extracellular electrodes, demonstrating anion effluxes at the tip, which is most pronounced when the outburst of a growth cycle begins (CITATION). Interestingly, the period of the simultaneous growth and apical anion oscillations increased with increasing extracellular Cl− concentrations. A possible interference of the Chloride Sensor ratio signal through the well-described pH gradient in growing pollen tubes was evaluated using the ratiometric cytosolic pH-sensor pHluorin (CITATION). Again, we biolistically transformed tobacco pollen and performed cytosolic pH measurements during an increase in extracellular Cl− concentration, using an experimental design similar to the one described for Figure 1. If a pronounced pH effect within the Chloride Sensor ratio signal exists, one would expect a similar cytosolic ratio signal using the two probes. Interestingly, an elevation in extracellular chloride concentration increased the apical pH gradient at the tip (see Supplemental Figure 1 online); however, the relative anion concentration in the extreme tip does not vary in such a fashion (Figure 1). In addition, a change in cytosolic pH could not be detected in the zone behind the subapical region (∼20 to 40 µm behind the tip) (see Supplemental Figure 1 online), where a pronounced increase in the Chloride Sensor ratio value occurs (Figure 1). A comparison of the ratio signal of both probes thus illustrated their fundamental differences along growing pollen tubes during an increase in the extracellular chloride concentration and point to negligible crosstalk (Figure 1; see Supplemental Figure 1 online) within our experimental design. Interestingly, the apical pH gradient started to oscillate when we increased the extracellular chloride concentration (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). [[FIGURE]] On in vitro growing conditions (especially in tobacco and lily), it is well established that pollen tubes tend to display oscillations in growth rate, which are associated with changes in tip-localized [Ca2+]cyt changes in various species (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). A set of CPKs was recently demonstrated to regulate anion channel activity in guard cells (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To test whether a relationship exists between anion and Ca2+ homeostasis at the pollen tube tip, we expressed the [Ca2+]cyt reporter Yellow-Cameleon YC3.6 (CITATION). Transiently transformed tobacco pollen grains were grown in medium containing 0.4 mM chloride and [Ca2+]cyt was monitored upon the application of 10 mM chloride, as in Figure 1. The false color–coded kymograph of time-lapse images of a representative pollen tube expressing YC3.6 time is presented in Figure 2A. Simultaneous analysis of the tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradient and growth rate (Figure 2B) demonstrates a weakly oscillating tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradient under standard growth conditions (Figure 2). Upon application of 10 mM chloride, however, pronounced growth alterations were recorded and tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt started to oscillate robustly. High [Ca2+]cyt at the tip correlated with increased growth velocity, which corresponded with a reduction in cytosolic anion concentration at the tip (Figure 1), indicating a temporal coupling of anion and Ca2+ homeostasis. In support of this observation, switching back from 10 mM to 0.4 mM extracellular chloride (wash-out) resulted in a dampening of the [Ca2+]cyt and growth velocity oscillations. Application of 5 µM NPPB, however, abolished the tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradient and reduced growth velocity (Figure 2; see Supplemental Movie 2 online). [[FIGURE]] To identify anion channels expressed in pollen tubes, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with cDNA (n = 5) from in vitro grown Arabidopsis pollen tubes. The transcript numbers of SLAC/SLAH-type and ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER/QUICKLY ACTIVATING ANION CHANNEL (ALMT/QUAC)-type anion channel proteins (known or postulated) were normalized to 10,000 actin2/8 transcripts. Relative transcript numbers of SLAH3 and ALMT12 were 919.8 ± 108.8 and 401.8 ± 122.4, respectively (Figure 3A). Transcripts of SLAC1 were at the detection level (10.5 ± 1.2 relative transcripts), whereas other members of the SLAC/SLAH family (namely SLAH1, SLAH2, and SLAH4) appeared not to be expressed in pollen tubes (Figure 3A). Both SLAH3 and ALMT12 were thus considered as pollen anion channels (Figure 3A). Employing a SLAH3 promotor–β-glucuronidase (GUS) line, SLAH3 expression was confirmed in pollen grains and pollen tubes within the pistil of Arabidopsis (Figure 3B). Because SLAH3 was already identified as a target of CPK action in guard cells, we decided to focus on the effect of SLAH3 on pollen tube performance. First we biolistically transformed N. tabacum pollen tubes and determined the subcellular localization of SLAH3. The fusion protein of YFP:SLAH3 (see Supplemental Figure 2 online) and SLAH3:YFP (Figure 3D) showed a uniform plasma membrane fluorescence with a slight tendency to decrease toward the apex. In contrast with the plasma membrane anion channel, soluble YFP (Venus) could be detected throughout the cytosol (Figure 3C). [[FIGURE]] The S-type anion channel SLAH3 is expressed in guard cells and mesophyll cells and its activation depends on trans-phosphorylation of CPK21/CPK23 (CITATION). We hypothesized that in the context of tip growth, pollen tube expressed CPKs could also interact with SLAH3. On the basis of results of a database analysis (http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de/) and transcriptomic data from CITATION, we cloned the 12 pollen-expressed CPKs and transiently expressed them as YFP fusion proteins in N. tabacum pollen tubes. The CPK family comprises 34 members that can be divided into four subgroups (CITATION). The majority of CPK family members harbor a putative N-terminal myristoylation and/or palmitoylation site, suggesting that they are membrane- or membrane-associated target proteins (CITATION). CPK4, CPK11, and CPK26 are relatively closely related proteins from subgroup I. These kinases are predicted to lack a myristoylation site (CITATION) and they indeed revealed a cytoplasmic fluorescence signal when fused to a YFP protein (Figure 4, top left). CPK14, CPK16, CPK24, and CPK32 from subgroups III and IV are predicted to be myristoylated and appeared to have a dual-subcellular localization. A minor plasma membrane fluorescence signal was detected, which was absent from the tip. However, the main fluorescent signal of CPK24 was visible in the vegetative nucleus (Figure 4, top right) and that of CPK14, CPK16, and CPK32 (Figure 4, bottom left) at the membrane of the generative cell. A more diffuse plasma membrane fluorescence of CPK6:YFP was detected in the base of the pollen tube with an increasing intensity toward the grain but it was absent from the membrane on the first 50 to 60 µm (Figure 4, second row, on right). Closely related CPK2 and CPK20, from subgroup I, are specifically expressed in pollen tubes and root hairs (M. Böhmer and T. Romeis, unpublished data). CPK2:YFP and CPK20:YFP revealed a plasma membrane fluorescence signal exclusively at the growing pollen tube tip (Figure 4, mid right). Tissue-specific GUS activity of transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying ProCPK2::GUS or ProCPK20::GUS showed strong promoter activity in pollen (see Supplemental Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 1 online) and a tip-localized plasma membrane CPK2:YFP signal was confirmed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying ProLeLAT52::CPK2:YFP (see Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 1 online). Double loss-of-function mutants of the similar (93% amino acid identity) CPK17 and CPK34 are impaired in pollen tube growth and subsequently in fertilization (CITATION). Both CPK17 and CPK34 are localized to the plasma membrane of the pollen tube tip (Figure 4, bottom right), but their physiological target proteins are not known. The subcellular localization of CPK2, CK20, CPK17, and CPK34 at the tip is in line with our hypotheses of CPK-induced anion channel activation. To test whether posttranscriptional modifications at the N-terminus are important for unique plasma membrane targeting of the latter CPKs, we generated point mutation constructs eliminating myristoylation and/or palmitoylation sites of CPK34 and CPK2. Eliminating either myristoylation or palmitoylation resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of both CPK proteins (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). An N-terminal YFP fusion of CPK34 and CPK2 prevented correct plasma membrane targeting as well, and gave rise to cytosolic fluorescence in pollen tubes expressing YFP:CPK34 or YFP:CPK2 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). These results strongly indicate the necessity of posttranslational modification for the distinct subcellular localization patterns of membrane-associated pollen CPKs presented in Figure 4. [[FIGURE]] Next we hypothesized that pollen tube CPKs phosphorylate SLAH3 in a calcium-dependent fashion, similar to previous studies of the guard cell anion channels SLAH3 and SLAC1, which are activated via CPK21/CPK23 phosphorylation when coexpressed (Geiger et al., 2009, CITATION, CITATION). To identify interacting partners for SLAH3 among the putative CPK candidates localized to the pollen tube tip, we performed FRET-FLIM. Therefore, CPK17 and CPK34 as well as CPK2 and CPK20 with a C-terminal mTurquoise (CFP) fusion were either expressed alone or coexpressed with SLAH3:YFP in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. The CFP (donor) fluorescence lifetime was recorded under both conditions. Expression of CPK17 and CPK34 fused to CFP alone resulted in an average fluorescence lifetime of 3.159 ± 0.009 ns (n = 41) and 3.142 ± 0.006 ns (n = 38), respectively (Figure 5A, open bars). No significant reduction of the average fluorescence lifetime was detectable when CPK17:CFP or CPK34:CFP were coexpressed with SLAH3:YFP (Figure 5A, filled bars). The average fluorescence lifetimes of CPK2:CFP (n = 37) and CPK20:CFP (n = 37) alone were 3.130 ± 0.009 ns and 3.133 ± 0.005 ns, respectively, and were thus comparable with the average lifetimes of CPK17:CFP and CPK34:CFP alone. However, the average fluorescence lifetime was significantly reduced to 3.070 ± 0.012 ns (n = 35) and 3.081 ± 0.010 ns (n = 37), respectively, when CPK2:CFP and CPK20:CFP were coexpressed with SLAH3:YFP (Figure 5A). These results indicated a specific interaction of CPK2 (P ≤ 0.0002) and CPK20 (P ≤ 0.0001), but not CPK17 and CPK34, with the anion channel SLAH3. The average lifetime of CFP alone and a CFP:YFP fusion (2 amino acid linker) were compared as an additional control and gave rise to a strong reduction of the fluorescence lifetime from 3.172 ± 0.007 ns (n = 15) to 2.410 ± 0.035 ns (n = 16) in CFP:YFP expressing cells. A fluorescence lifetime reduction of 60.51 ps in CPK2 and 51.86 ps in CPK20 coexpressed with SLAH3 was much less than the decrease in the CFP:YFP fusion protein (762 ns), most likely because of the transient nature of the interaction between CPKs and their target proteins. [[FIGURE]] YFP BiFC was also used to test the association between SLAH3 and the different CPKs. Results and controls are shown in Supplemental Figure 6 online. However, in control experiments, a fluorescence complementation could be detected with a coexpression of the C-terminal half of a YFP (YC) and the N-terminal half of the YFP (YN) alone or CPK11:YN + YC in the cytoplasm, CPK34:YN + YC at the membrane of the apex, and CPK21:YN + YC, SLAH3:YC + YN and CPK34:YN + SLAH3 uniformly at the plasma membrane (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). When BiFC constructs of YC:SLAH3 and CPK2:YN were coexpressed, it was difficult to find and image intact pollen tubes, because the majority collapsed and died. Interestingly, we detected a plasma membrane fluorescence complementation exclusively at the apex (see Supplemental Figure 6 online), pointing to a specific SLAH3/CPK2 complex forming only at the pollen tube tip. In combination with the FRET-FLIM results, these data suggest that SLAH3 and CPK2 interact. However, the pleiotropic localization responses observed for the different controls, most likely because of a general overexpression of the proteins, would advise for caution for direct conclusions from the BiFC data. To further detail the interaction between SLAH3 and tip-localized pollen-specific CPKs in relation to anion channel function, we took advantage of the two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique. We injected the cRNA of SLAH3 fused to the C-terminal half of YFP together with a variety of elongation factor (EF)-hand truncated (ΔEF) CPK versions (CITATION; CITATION). CPK34, CPK17, CPK2, and CPK20 were fused to the N-terminal half of YFP in X. laevis oocytes to analyze ion currents and BiFC. In this type of experiment, BiFC conclusions are directly verifiable by the induction of currents. EF hand-truncated CPK versions were used because their kinase activity is independent of oocyte cytosolic Ca2+ variations. To resolve anion currents, voltage-clamped oocytes were exposed to a depolarization voltage pulse of 0 mV to allow channel activation, followed by 20-s voltage pulses ranging from +40 to −180 mV in 20-mV decrements. These voltage steps were followed by a 3-s voltage pulse to −120 mV. S-type anion channel activity is characterized by slow deactivating currents upon voltage steps from depolarized to hyperpolarized membrane potentials, whereas instantaneous or slowly activating currents are recorded in the depolarized voltage range. The expression of SLAH3:YC alone (as a negative control) or coexpression of SLAH3:YC with CPK17:YN or CPK34:YN did not elicit macroscopic anion currents (Figure 6A). However, coexpression of CPK2:YN or CPK20:YN with SLAH3:YC resulted in instantaneous currents (P ≤ 0.0001) with typical time-dependent S-type anion channel deactivation kinetics (Figure 6A). CPK21, which is known to activate SLAH3 (CITATION), was coexpressed as a positive control and gave rise to macroscopic currents (P ≤ 0.0001) comparable to those with CPK2 (Figure 6A). In line with a phosphorylation-dependent anion channel activation, point mutation versions of CPK2 (CPK2D310A) and CPK20 (CPK20D258A), rendering the kinase inactive, did not result in macroscopic SLAH3 currents. Mean steady state SLAH3 currents at −100 mV are presented upon coexpression with the CPKs as indicated in Figure 6B and revealed −11.3 ± 0.8 µA with CPK21 (n = 8), −9.90 ± 2.3 µA with CPK2 (n = 11), and −6.7 ± 1.6 µA with CPK20 (n = 11). For SLAH3:YC alone (n = 10), coexpression of the anion channel with CPK17 ΔEF:YN (n = 8), CPK34 ΔEF:YN (n = 6), CPK2D310A ΔEF:YN (n = 4), or CPK20D258A ΔEF:YN (n = 4) did not elicit macroscopic currents (Figure 6B). As expected, oocytes expressing SLAH3:YC alone exhibited no yellow fluorescence signal upon spectroscopic analysis (Figure 6C). Coexpression of SLAH3:YC with CPK17 ΔEF:YN or CPK34 ΔEF:YN resulted in weak YFP fluorescence, whereas CPK21 ΔEF:YN, CPK2 ΔEF:YN, CPK20 ΔEF:YN, CPK2D310A ΔEF:YN, and CPK20D258A ΔEF:YN showed a bright membrane BiFC signal, indicating a physical interaction between SLAH3 and CPK2, CPK20, and CPK21 (Figure 6C). [[FIGURE]] Double-barreled electrodes were used to impale growing Arabidopsis pollen tubes on a semi-solid medium to characterize anion currents using the TEVC technique. Wild-type and mutant pollen grains were germinated in parallel by dotting freshly harvested flowers on semi-solid medium (medium composition is indicated in the figure legends and in the Methods). To resolve pollen tube anion currents, a potassium-free medium was used to exclude typical time-dependent hyperpolarization activating K+ currents (CITATION; CITATION), which occur in the presence of ≥1 mM extracellular potassium (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). An increase in medium NO3− concentration from 1 to 5, 20, and 40 mM, while maintaining constant Ca2+ (20 mM) and nominal 0 mM K+ concentration, resulted in a current amplitude increase in the negative and positive voltage range (Figure 7A). Negative or positive currents represent anion efflux from or influx into the cell, respectively. Increasing NO3− media concentrations resulted in a reversal potential shift toward more positive potentials. The reversal potentials at 5, 10, 20, and 40 mM medium NO3− concentration were −57.1 ± 3.2 mV, −48.1 ± 5.3 mV, −45.7 ± 3.0 mV, and −39.2 ± 8.9 mV, respectively. According to the Nernst equation, this indicates a cytosolic NO3− accumulation with increasing media anion concentration from 0.6 mM NO3− to 1.9 mM, 3.6 mM, and 8.9 mM, respectively (see Supplemental Table 2 online). In line with a 20 times higher NO3− to Cl− permeability, and an extracellular NO3−-dependent SLAH3 channel activation, we recorded higher anion currents in NO3− (n = 10) compared with Cl− (n = 12) conditions (Figure 7A, inset). A plot of the steady state current/voltage (I/V) relation demonstrated an up to 1.7-fold increase in negative current for pollen grown in a 40 mM NO3−-based versus 40 mM Cl− -based medium (Figure 7A, inset). Because of the high variation in currents, only a significant difference in the voltage range from −200 to −160 mV was apparent. These S-type currents could be blocked by 10 and 50 µM of the anion channel blockers niflumic acid (NA) (n = 5) and NPPB (n = 6) by 78% and 70% at −200 mV, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 8 online). Currents were significantly blocked (P ≤ 0.05) at all voltages applied except −40 and −20 mV for NPPB and at −40 mV for NA. These anion channel blockers are weak acids and acidify the cytoplasm of growing pollen tubes (see Supplemental Figure 9 online) but a cytosolic acidification per se, for example through acetate, does not have an effect on anion currents (see Supplemental Figure 8 online) or pollen growth (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). This demonstrates that both channel blockers specifically block S-type anion channels under our experimental conditions. To investigate the in vivo function of SLAH3, CPK2, and CPK20, we isolated T-DNA insertion lines of SLAH3 (see Supplemental Figure 10 and Supplemental Table 5 online), CPK2, and CPK20 alleles (see Supplemental Figure 11 and Supplemental Table 6 online). We performed voltage clamp experiments with slah3-1 (GABI 371G03), slah3-2 (SALK_085191) as well as double cpk2-1 cpk20-2 (SALK_059237 and SALK_073448) mutants and recorded anion currents in pollen tubes grown in chloride as well as nitrate-based medium. We used double cpk2-1 cpk20-2 mutants to avoid gene redundancy, because CPK2 and CPK20 are both expressed in pollen tubes and closely related proteins (63% amino acid identity). Similar to patch-clamp analysis of anion currents in lily pollen tube protoplasts (CITATION), our analysis revealed depolarization-activated, slowly deactivating currents in wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0), whereas typical S-type anion currents were absent or strongly reduced in slah3-1, slah3-2, and cpk2-1 cpk20-2 mutant cells (Figure 7B). A plot of the steady state currents from membrane voltages clamped from −200 mV to +80 mV (Δ = 20 mV) revealed significantly reduced anion currents in slah3-1-, slah3-2, and cpk2-1 cpk20-2 pollen tubes in both chloride-based (see Supplemental Figure 12 online) and nitrate-based solution, pointing to a function for CPK2 and CPK20 in S-type anion channel regulation (Figure 7C). The steady state currents were significantly reduced (P ≤ 0.05; all statistics by paired Student’s t test) in slah3-1 at voltages from −200 to −60 mV and 0 to +80 mV and in slah3-2 at voltages from −200 to −40 mV and 0 to +80 mV, whereas the currents recorded for cpk2-1 cpk20-2 were significantly reduced from −200 to −160 mV and from 0 to +80 mV. The steady state current of Col-0 wild-type pollen was −2.4 ± 0.3 nA (n = 27), that of cpk2-1 cpk20-2 pollen was −1.4 ± 0.3 nA (n = 12), and those of slah3-1 and slah3-2 pollen were −0.9 ± 0.1 nA (n = 13) and −1.1 ± 0.2 nA (n = 10), respectively, at a membrane potential of −200 mV (Figure 7C). Tip-focused anion efflux was quantified by means of ion-selective vibrating microelectrodes in Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0, slah3-1, and cpk2-1 cpk20-2 double mutant pollen tubes. In contrast with mean anion fluxes of 24,958 ± 4589 pmol cm−2 s−1 in wild-type Col-0 (n = 15), slah3-1 and cpk2-1 cpk20-2 double mutant pollen tubes were characterized by reduced anion fluxes with 20,059 ± 3936 pmol cm−2 s−1 (n = 9) and 20,528 ± 3454 pmol cm−2 s−1 (n = 15), respectively (Figure 7D). However, because of the great variation in fluxes, we could not confirm this variation to be statistically significant. Pollen tubes of slah3-1 and cpk2-1 cpk20-2 double mutants demonstrated a reduced growth rate compared with Col-0 (Figure 7E). Mean growth rates of 2.57 ± 0.18 µm s−1 in the wild type were recorded, whereas slah3-1 was characterized by a growth rate of 2.36 ± 0.19 µm s−1, and that of cpk2-1 cpk20-2 mutants was significantly reduced to 1.68 ± 0.16 µm s−1 (P ≤ 0.01). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 plants were grown on soil and cultivated in growth chambers for 4 to 6 weeks under short-day conditions (8 h light/16 h darkness, 22/16°C) and after that in a greenhouse in long-day conditions (12 h light/12 h darkness, 22/16°C) with illumination provided by 100 μmol m−2 s−1 fluorescent tubes (25 W, 230 V, Osram TL70 F32T8/TL 741; Philips). Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed using A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 as wild type. In the case of transcript quantification, the pollen tube growth medium was composed of the following (in mM): 1 MES, 1.6 H3BO3, 1 KCl, 3 CaCl2, and 7 CaNO3. The standard medium for electrophysiological measurements with Arabidopsis pollen tubes consisted of the following (in mM): 1 MES, 1.6 H3BO3, and either 20 CaCl2 or 20 CaNO3. For media with different anion concentrations, Ca(gluconate)2 was used to ensure unaltered Ca2+ concentrations. TEVC measurements of Arabidopsis pollen were performed in medium containing the following (in mM): 1 MES, 1.6 H3BO3, supplemented with either 1 or 10 K-Gluconate to resolve K+-channel activity. Osmolarity of all Arabidopsis pollen media was adjusted to 370 mosmol kg−1 (Vapor Pressure Osmometer 5520; Wescor) with D(+)-Suc and pH was adjusted to 6.5 with Tris. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cultivars Petit Havana SR1) plants were grown on soil with a day/night regime of 10 h/14 h, and a temperature of 22 to 24/20 to 22°C provided by a 30 klux white light (SON-T Agro 400W; Philips) until flowering for pollen collection. Pollen used in all assays was collected from anthers immediately after anthesis and used fresh or frozen at −20°C. Tobacco pollen germination medium consisted of the following (in mM): 1 MES, 0.2 CaCl2, and 1.6 H3BO3. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 with Tris and osmolarity was adjusted to 400 mosmol kg−1 (Vapor Pressure Osmometer 5520) with D(+)-succhrose. Essentially, Ca2+ was kept constant and K+ was not added to the medium for the application of different Cl− concentrations. To elevate Cl− only, we adjusted its concentration with HCl and buffered the medium with Tris. Osmolarity was kept the same in all Cl− solutions and was adjusted with Suc. Suc content in the medium with 50 mM chloride was ∼11%. Thus, we assumed that we were working with Suc concentrations that were saturating in terms of Suc-transporter capacity in all media. For transient transformation of mesophyll protoplasts, Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 plants grown on soil were kept under short-day conditions for 4 to 5 weeks. Mesophyll protoplasts were prepared using the tape-Arabidopsis sandwich method (CITATION). In TEVC studies, oocytes were perfused with Tris/MES buffers. The standard solution contained the following (in mM): 10 MES/Tris (pH 5.6), 1 Ca(gluconate)2, 1 Mg(gluconate)2, 100 NaNO3, and 1 LaCl3. Osmolality was adjusted to 220 mosmol/kg with d-sorbitol. Particle bombardment was performed using a homemade biolistic device similar to the PDS-1000/He biolistic system (Bio-Rad). A 4.3-way valve allowed application, hold, and release of the vacuum (–0.8 bar) to the chamber while a magnetic valve controlled helium-pressure (8–9 kp/cm2) pulse injection. Approximately 2.5 mg tungsten particles (Bio-Rad) of 1.0-µm diameter were coated with 10 µg plasmid DNA according to the Bio-Rad instruction manual (CITATION). Particles diluted in water were placed on a filter (VWR International GmbH) screwed in position right behind the pressure valve. The parameters of particle travel distance were as follows: 7 cm between the filter and a grid (0.5-mm mesh width) and 5 cm between the grid and the pollen. Bombardment of hydrated N. tabacum pollen grains (either fresh or frozen) was spotted on 1% agarose plates containing standard tobacco growth medium. After transformation, tobacco pollen were transferred to dishes glued to precision cover slips of 0.17 ± 0.1 mm (Assistent) previously coated with 0.01% poly(l-Lys) (Sigma-Aldrich) and mixed with 40°C warm tobacco medium containing low melt agarose (Carl Roth) resulting in a final agarose concentration of 1%. On a 40°C hot plate, pollen grains were allowed to sink to the bottom of cover slip glass, needless medium was discarded, and the remaining medium was allowed to solidify at room temperature. This procedure allowed pollen tubes to grow on the surface of the cover slip, in a manner that was suitable for imaging. Widefield-imaging of N. tabacum pollen tubes was performed on an inverted Zeiss microscope AxioObserver (Carl Zeiss AG). Hardware and data management were performed via VisiView software (Visitron Systems). Fluorophores were excited with the VisiChrome High-Speed Polychromator System (Visitron Systems). Fluorescence was captured through either a ×40 or ×60 objective (C-Apochromat 40×/1.2 W Korr or C-Apochromat 63×/1.20 W Korr; Carl Zeiss) and a 512 × 512 pixel Evolve EMCCD camera (Photometrics). For CFP or YFP illumination, excitation wavelengths of 420 nm or 505 nm were used, respectively, and fluorescence emission was reflected via a dual-band dichroic mirror 440/520 and filtered with a dual-band emitter 464/547 (Semrock Inc.). A 6-position high-speed filter wheel (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd.), mounted at the side port, equipped with a CFP (ET 470/24 nm) and YFP (ET 535/30 nm) bandpass filter (Chroma Technology Corporation,), was used to separate the emission wavelengths of CFP and YFP. For YC3.6 illumination, CFP emission was recorded under CFP excitation at 420 nm (CFP@CFP) and YFP under CPF excitation (YFP@CFP). The Cl− sensor was illuminated the same way and YFP was recorded at YFP excitation (YFP@YFP) and ratio analysis was performed with three channels. Because the emission spectrum of eYFP, the fluorescence FRET acceptor protein in the Cl− sensor, is dependent on H+ concentrations (CITATION), the YFP@CFP/CFP@CFP ratio of the Cl− sensor possesses degrees of pH dependency originating from the pH gradient in pollen tubes. To subtract the pH dependency of the FRET ratio signal, the YFP@CFP channel was divided by the YFP@YFP channel prior to the division by the CFP@CFP channel, which is pH independent (CITATION). The pH-probe pHluorin was excited at 390 nm and 470 nm and emission was filtered through a dichroic mirror (500 nm) and bandpass filter (HQ 535/25 M; AF Analysentechnik). Image processing was performed using MacBiophotonics ImageJ v1.46 (National Institute of Health). Simultaneous pollen tube growth and ratio analysis were performed with a self-made script for the Octave 3.2.4 free software (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). Data were processed and plotted with Igor Pro 5.02 software (Wavemetrics Inc.). Because of the probe photobleaching and phototoxicity that occur during long-term live-cell imaging experiments, we were not able to determine cross-correlation in the subsecond range between the cytosolic anion as well as Ca2+ and H+ gradients and growth velocity in detail. For documentation of the oocyte BiFC results and the subcellular localization of CPK2:YFP in Arabidopsis pollen tubes, images were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP5 II; Leica Microsystems) equipped with Leica HCX IRAPO 25×/0.95 and HCX PL APO 63×/1.20 W CORR CS objectives, respectively. Voltage clamp experiments on pollen tubes were performed by impalement with double-barreled electrodes using a drift-free piezo-driven Sensapex Micromanipulator. Double-barreled electrodes were pulled from two borosilicate capillaries with filament (outer diameter 1 mm, inner diameter 0.58 mm; Hilgenberg). The two capillaries were aligned, heated, and twisted 360° in a customized vertical electrode puller (L/M-3P-A; List Medical Electronic) and finally pulled on a horizontal laser puller (P2000; Sutter Instruments), as described previously (CITATION). Both barrels were filled with 300 mM KCl and connected by means of Ag/AgCl wires to the microelectrode amplifier (TEC-05X; NPI Electronic) equipped with head stages of ≥1013 Ω input impedance. Voltage clamp protocols were applied with PULSE software (HEKA Electronics). Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 1 kHz. Arabidopsis pollen tubes were grown on the top of a semisolid medium containing 1.5% low-melt agarose. To ensure a high germination rate, only freshly opened flowers were used and dipped on the surface of the semisolid medium. Germinated pollen tubes were covered with liquid medium 2 to 3 h after dipping in medium with the same composition (for media composition see the section on plant material, growth conditions, and media), prior to electrode impalement. After impalement, the membrane potential was recorded until values reached a plateau, usually within 10 to 30 s. Pollen tubes were voltage clamped at the free running membrane potential only to perform current recordings and when voltage pulses in the range of −200 mV to +80 mV (Δ20 mV increments) were applied. TEVC recordings were performed with Xenopus laevis oocytes 2 to 3 d after cRNA injection with a Turbo TEC-01C amplifier (NPI Electronic). The electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl and had typical input resistances of 2 to 6 MΩ. Voltage clamp protocols were applied with Patchmaster software (HEKA Electronics). Starting from a holding potential of 0 mV, single 20-s voltage pulses were applied in 20-mV decrements from +60 to −200 mV followed by a 3-s voltage pulse to −120 mV. Instantaneous currents (Iinst) were extracted directly after the voltage jump from the holding potential of 0 mV to 50-ms test pulses ranging from +70 to −150 mV. Data points with error bars represent the mean ± sd, and statistical significance was verified by a paired Student's t test. Extracellular anion flux measurements were performed as follows. Arabidopsis pollen grains were collected from fresh flowers and germinated in liquid medium containing the following: 500 µM KCl, 500 µM CaCl2, 125 µM MgSO4, 500 µM H3BO3, 125 µM HEPES, and 15% of Suc at pH 7.5. After at least 3 h of incubation at 21.5°C, measurements were performed on growing pollen tubes that were at least 150 µm in length. The respective growth rate was evaluated simultaneously with the extracellular anionic fluxes, defined as the total length grown during the experiment divided by the amount of time spanned. Extracellular anionic flux at the pollen tube tip was estimated with the ion-selective vibrating probe (CITATION; CITATION). Anion-specific microelectrodes were fabricated from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass capillaries and pulled with a Sutter P-97 electrode puller (Sutter Instruments), baked at 230°C overnight and then internally covered with N,N-dimethyltrimethylethylsilamine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min. Electrodes were backfilled with 100 mM KCl and subsequently front-loaded with a 30-µm column of the anion-selective liquid cocktail (chloride ionophore I cocktail A; Sigma-Aldrich). A silver/silver chloride wire was inserted into the back of the electrode and a dry electrode (DryRef-2; World Precision Instruments) was used as a reference. Electrode calibration was performed by measuring the Nernst potential of three different Cl− concentration solutions (0.1, 1, and 10 mM KCl). Electrode positioning and vibrating was performed with a stepper-motor–driven three-dimensional positioner. Data acquisition, setting of the voltage parameters, and the three-dimensional electrode micromanipulator were controlled via ASET software (Science Wares and Applicable Electronics). The ion-selective probe vibrated with an excursion of 5 µm, completing the cycle of acquisition in 4 s, which includes a tunable settling time after each move, two measurement periods, and the respective excursion time. All measurements were obtained as close as possible to the tip membrane without touching the tube. Background voltage values were taken after each measurement ∼500 µm away from any other pollen grain or tube, and the values were subtracted from the millivolt differential recordings during data processing using a custom made Microsoft Excel sheet. Fluxes were calculated using Fick’s law and the chloride diffusion coefficient in aqueous solution at 25°C (−2.03 × 10−5 cm−2 s−1). A GUS staining assay (CITATION) was performed on fully opened flowers of the ProSLAH3::GUS reporter gene line grown as described in the section on plant material, growth conditions, and media. Flowers were submerged in 1 mL staining solution (containing the following [in mM]: 100 sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 1 EDTA pH 8.0, 5 potassium ferricyanide, 5 potassium ferrocyanide, 1% Triton-X-100, and 1 mg/ml X-Gluc) and vacuum infiltrated for 5 min. The samples were incubated overnight at 37°C followed by several washing steps with 70% ethanol to destain specimens. Documentation was performed with a Keyence VHX-100k digital microscope and was processed via MacBiophotonics ImageJ v1.46 software. A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 pollen were collected via the vacuum cleaner method (CITATION) and germinated/grown by placing pollen grain covered-gaze directly on semisolid medium containing 1.5% agarose. After 5 h, the tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground using glass beads. RNA isolation of pollen tubes was performed using oligo dT Dynabeads (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some minor modifications. Ground pollen tube samples were mixed with lysis buffer, agitated for 2 min, and centrifuged and the supernatant was then mixed with 30 μL activated Dynabeads. After 30 min on a rotation mixer, beads were washed consecutively with buffer containing lithium dodecylsulfate and with non-lithium dodecylsulfate–containing buffer. After every washing step, the beads were separated from the supernatant by magnetic force. Washed mRNA was eluted from the Dynabeads in 8 μL elution buffer at 72°C. The purified mRNA was subsequently used for cDNA synthesis performed by adding 0.4 μL poly(T) primer (100 µM), 0.5 μL deoxynucleotide triphosphate (10 mM), and 2.5 μL 10× Master Mix, incubated at 72°C for 2 min and then placed on ice. Reverse transcriptase was added and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 42°C. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to the Abgene SYBR Green assay in an Eppendorf Realplex cycler. For transcription quantification, cDNA was diluted 1:20 in H2O containing 10 µg/ml t-RNA. Samples (2 µl) were mixed with 10 μL SYBR Green Mix and a gene-specific primer mix (8 µl). A detailed list of the qRT-PCR primers used is presented in Supplemental Table 3 online. In addition to the pollen cDNA samples, an internal standard curve (range, 1 fg/µl to 0.001 fg/µl) for each gene was quantified. Transcripts were normalized to 10,000 molecules of actin2/8 using standard curves calculated for the individual PCR products. FRET-FLIM measurements between mTurquoise (CFP) (CITATION) and Venus (YFP) (CITATION) were performed as described previously (CITATION) using the Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP system combined with a Nikon TE 300 inverted microscope. Two-photon excitation pulses were generated by a Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent Mira) pumped by a 5-W Coherent Verdi laser. Pulse trains of 76 MHz (150 fs pulse duration, 860 nm center wavelength) were produced. The excitation light was directly coupled to the microscope and focused into the sample using a CFI Plan Apochromat ×60 water immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.2. CFP emission was detected using the nondescanned single photon counting Hamamatsu HPM-100-40 Hybrid detector (Becker & Hickel), using a 480DF30 bandpass filter. Images with a frame size of 64 × 64 pixels were acquired. Donor fluorescence lifetimes (CFP) were analyzed using SPCImage 3.50 software (Becker and Hickl) and a two-component decay model. The statistical significance of differences between donor-only and donor-acceptor combinations was determined using Student’s t test. To analyze the subcellular localization of the ion channels and CPKs used in this study, their cDNA was cloned into a plant expression vector as described by CITATION with a cloning technique based on a uracil-specific-excision reagent (USER-Friendly) combined with a proof-reading DNA polymerase (CITATION). The plant expression vector used was based on a pSAT vector containing either the full-length YFP or N- or C-terminal halves upstream or downstream of a USER cassette. Similar to studies described previously (CITATION), gene expression was ensured through the promoter and terminator sequence of the ubiquitin10 and ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase enzyme downstream and upstream of the USER cassette, respectively. The primers used to amplify the cDNAs are listed in Supplemental Table 4 online. Plasmid DNA was amplified in competent Escherichia coli mrf' cells, verified via enzyme restriction as well as sequencing and purification with the Qiagen Midi Kit. For X.laevis oocyte experiments, the cDNAs of SLAH3 as well as EF hand-truncated versions of CPK21, CPK2, CPK20, CPK17, and CPK34 were cloned into oocyte (BiFC) expression vectors (based on pGEM vectors), by an advanced uracil-excision–based cloning technique as described by CITATION. For functional analysis, cRNA was prepared with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion). Oocyte preparation and cRNA injection were performed as described (CITATION). For oocyte BiFC and electrophysiological experiments, 10 ng cRNA was injected each. The identities of cpk2-1 cpk20-2, slah3-1, and slah3-2 loss-of-function T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis lines were verified via PCRs. A detailed description and primer list used for genotyping are presented in Supplemental Tables 5 and 6 online.
