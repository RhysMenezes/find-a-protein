!~ABS~! The recognition of ubiquitylated substrates is an essential element of ubiquitin/26S proteasome‐mediated proteolysis (UPP), which is mediated directly by the proteasome subunit RPN10 and/or RPN13, or indirectly by ubiquitin receptors containing ubiquitin‐like and ubiquitin‐associated domains. By pull‐down and mutagenesis assays, we detected cross‐species divergence of the major recognition pathways. RPN10 plays a major role in direct recognition in Arabidopsis and yeast based on the strong affinity for the long and K48‐linked ubiquitin chains. In contrast, both the RPN10 and RPN13 homologs play major roles in humans. For indirect recognition, the RAD23 and DSK2 homologs (except for the human DSK2 homolog) are major receptors. The human RAD23 homolog is targeted to the 26S proteasome by the RPN10 and RPN13 homologs. In comparison, Arabidopsis uses UIM1 and UIM3 of RPN10 to bind DSK2 and RAD23, respectively. Yeast uses UIM in RPN10 and LRR in RPN1. Overall, multiple proteasome subunits are responsible for the direct and/or indirect recognition of ubiquitylated substrates in yeast and humans. In contrast, a single proteasome subunit, RPN10, is critical for both the direct and indirect recognition pathways in Arabidopsis. In agreement with these results, the accumulation of ubiquitylated substrates and severe pleiotropic phenotypes of vegetative and reproductive growth are associated with the loss of RPN10 function in an Arabidopsis T‐DNA insertion mutant. This implies that the targeting and proteolysis of the critical regulators involved are affected. These results support a cross‐species mechanistic and functional divergence of the major recognition pathways for ubiquitylated substrates of UPP.

!~RES~! To examine potential differences in the substrate selectivity and structural divergence of the major ubiquitin receptors of UPP across species, we determined their ubiquitin chain binding properties and associated structural elements/residues. We first compared binding properties among Arabdopsis, human and yeast homologs of the major ubiquitin receptors RPN10, RPN13, RAD23, DSK2 and DDI1, with either K48‐ or K63‐linked ubiquitin chains consisting of two to seven ubiquitin units (Table 1). Whereas a K48‐linked ubiquitin chain of more than four ubiquitin units is the predominant targeting signal for UPP [CITATION], the K63‐linked ubiquitin chain is the predominant signal for DNA repair, endocytosis and signal transduction [CITATION-CITATION]. The major ubiquitin receptors were expressed and purified as glutathione S‐transferase (GST)‐tagged wild‐type or mutated variants (Table S1). The preferences of various ubiquitin receptors for particular chain types and lengths were examined using GST pull‐down analysis, in which the profiles of the pulled‐down and input chains were compared by immunoblotting.  Whereas Arabdopsis and yeast RPN10 had significantly stronger affinities for long and K48‐linked ubiquitin chains rather than the K63‐linked chains, the human RPN10 homolog (S5a) showed strong affinities for long ubiquitin chains of both linkage types (Table 1 and Fig. S1). The distinct chain‐type preferences of RPN10 from different species were confirmed by competitively pulling‐down mixtures of tetra‐ubiquitin chains containing an equal amount of both linkage types, which could be distinguished by their distinct electrophoretic mobilities (data not shown). A similar, strong affinity for either the K48‐ or K63‐linked tetra‐ubiquitin chain was also reported previously for S5a [CITATION].  The novel base subunit RPN13 was found to be a new proteasomal ubiquitin receptor [CITATION, CITATION]. Distinct ubiquitin chain binding properties were observed for the Arabdopsis, human and yeast RPN13 homologs. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2A, Arabdopsis RPN13 exhibited a weak affinity for K48‐linked chains of three and four ubiquitin units and for K63‐linked chains of various lengths. By contrast, human RPN13 had a strong and approximately equivalent affinity for both K48‐ and K63‐linked chains, revealing that the binding is similar to that of human S5a (RPN10). It appears that human RPN13 prefers chains of more than three and four ubiquitin units for the K48‐ and K63‐linked chains, respectively (compare the input and eluted chain profiles in Fig. S2A). Moreover, yeast RPN13 did not interact with either K48‐ or K63‐linked chains.  A significant amount of high molecular mass ubiquitylated proteins from crude Arabdopsis extracts can be pulled‐down readily by GST‐fused Arabdopsis or human RPN13 (Fig. S2B, left), indicating a role for ubiquitylated substrate recognition. In agreement with the stronger ubiquitin chain binding activity, a relatively higher level of ubiquitylated proteins was associated with human RPN13. By contrast, no ubiquitylated proteins can be precipitated using yeast RPN13.  As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S3, distinct ubiquitin chain binding properties were also detected with the Arabdopsis, human and yeast UBL–UBA ubiquitin receptors examined, except with the RAD23 homologs. Similar to Arabdopsis RPN10 (Fig. S1), RAD23 homologs from Arabdopsis, humans (hHR23b) and yeast had significantly stronger affinities for longer K48‐linked chains than for K63‐linked chains (Fig. S3A,B). However, the human DSK2 homolog (PLIC‐1) had moderate affinity but a clear preference for K63‐linked chains (Fig. S3A). This contrasts to the preference for longer, K48‐linked ubiquitin chains displayed by the Arabdopsis DSK2 homologs (Table 1 and data not shown). Furthermore, yeast DSK2 showed strong and nearly equivalent affinities for the K48‐ and K63‐linked ubiquitin chains (Fig. S3B). A similar preference for either K48‐ or K63‐linked tetra‐ubiquitin chains was observed previously for the isolated UBA of yeast DSK2 [CITATION]. This was confirmed by comparing the pull‐down of tetra‐ubiquitin chains of either linkage type (data not shown). In the case of DDI1 homologs, we observed weak affinities for both K48‐ and K63‐linked chains when using the human and yeast homologs (Table 1 and Fig. S3A,B). These results are similar to those obtained with Arabdopsis DDI1 (Table 1 and data not shown).  To examine the cross‐species divergence of the structural requirements for the recognition of ubiquitylated substrates, we determined the involved structural elements/residues of the major ubiquitin receptors (Table 1). RPN10 homologs from Arabdopsis, humans and yeast contain three, two and one UIMs, respectively, of which Arabdopsis uses the first UIM (UIM1) for binding ubiquitin chains [CITATION, CITATION] (Table 1, and data not shown). Involvement of the UIMs of the human and yeast RPN10 homologs in binding to K48‐ and K63‐linked ubiquitin chains was determined using single or double UIM mutations. Five critical hydrophobic residues within UIM1 (216–220; LALAL) and/or UIM2 (287–291; IAYAM) of the human RPN10 homolog (S5a) and UIM of yeast RPN10 (228–232; LAMAL) were replaced by asparagines. Mutation of UIM abolished the binding activity of yeast RPN10 to the ubiquitin chains of both linkage types (Fig. S1B, GST–Scrpn10–uim), indicating that UIM plays a critical role in ubiquitin chain binding. Mutation of UIM2 of the human RPN10 homolog S5a abolished binding to the K48‐ and K63‐linked chains almost completely, whereas mutation of UIM1 reduced binding to both chain types significantly (Fig. S1A, GST–S5a–uim2 and GST–S5a–uim1). Double‐site mutation abrogated the binding activity completely (GST–S5a–uim1_2), indicating that the two UIM sites of S5a are the primary structural motifs for ubiquitin chain binding. The association of a stronger binding defect with the UIM2 mutation suggests a more critical role for UIM2. It is apparent that the amount of precipitation of the K48‐ and K63‐linked ubiquitin chains associated with wild‐type S5a cannot simply be attributed to an additive effect of the two single UIM‐containing variants (Fig. S1A), and this observation supports a cooperative binding mode for the two UIMs of the human RPN10 homolog (S5a).  The residues of human RPN13 that are critically involved in ubiquitin binding have been identified by molecular docking, based primarily on the crystal structure of mammalian RPN13, and these residues are located within a novel ubiquitin‐binding domain PRU [CITATION]. In general, the corresponding residues are conserved in Arabdopsis RPN13, but they diverge significantly in yeast RPN13 (Fig. S4). These findings are in agreement with the observation that yeast RPN13 is unable to bind both ubiquitin chains and conjugates. Several critical residues of mammalian RPN13, including L56, F76, D79 and F98, have been shown to be essential for ubiquitin binding using mutagenesis and in vitro pull‐down assays [CITATION]. Binding to both the K48‐ and K63‐linked ubiquitin chains was affected drastically when the corresponding residues of Arabdopsis and human RPN13 were mutated individually to A, R, Q (or N) and R, respectively (Figs S4–S5), indicating that the same interfaces in Arabdopsis and human RPN13 appear to be critical for ubiquitin chain binding (Table 1).  RAD23 homologs from Arabdopsis, humans or yeast contain two UBA domains (UBA1 and ‐2), in which each of the UBAs of Arabdopsis RAD23 contributes additively to the binding of K48‐linked ubiquitin chains (Table 1 and data not shown). The roles of the UBAs in ubiquitin chain binding of human and yeast RAD23 homologs were determined using single‐ or double UBA mutations (Table 1 and Fig. S6A,B). Three conserved residues implicated in ubiquitin binding within each UBA were replaced with alanines; these residues were 200–202 (MGY) and 376–378 (LGF) in the human homolog hHR23b and 158–160 (MGY) and 367–369 (LGF) in yeast RAD23. As shown in Fig. S6A, mutation of UBA1 or UBA2 of human hHR23b reduced the binding activity of K48‐ or K63‐linked ubiquitin chains significantly, indicating that both UBAs are critical for the binding of ubiquitin chains of both linkage types. It appears that the amount of K48‐linked ubiquitin chain pulled‐down by the wild‐type protein is approximately the additive contribution of the two single UBA site‐containing mutants. Mutation of both sites completely abrogated the chain binding activity (uba1_2) of both linkage types, indicating that the two UBA sites of human hHR23b are the primary structural motifs responsible for ubiquitin chain binding. For yeast RAD23, the mutation of UBA1, but not of UBA2, abrogated the binding activity to ubiquitin chains of either linkage type almost completely, indicating that UBA1 plays a major role in binding of the ubiquitin chain (Fig. S6B). Mutation of both sites also abrogated the binding activity for both linkage types completely (Fig. S6B, uba1_2).  The human DSK2 homolog (PLIC1) and yeast DSK2 and DDI1 each contain a single UBA; the role of these UBAs in ubiquitin chain binding was determined (Table 1 and Fig. S6C). No sequence similar to the UBA was identified in human DDI1, suggesting that a potentially novel structural motif is involved in ubiquitin binding. Two conserved residues believed to mediate the interaction with ubiquitin within the various UBAs were replaced by alanines; these are 557–558 (MG) of the human DSK2 homolog (PLIC1), 342–343 (MG) of yeast DSK2 and 401–402 (LG) of yeast DDI1. Mutation of the UBA of human and yeast DSK2 homologs abolished binding to ubiquitin chains of both linkage types, as did the equivalent UBA mutants of the Arabdopsis DSK2 homologs (Table 1 and Fig. S6C). The UBA mutation of yeast DDI1 also abolished binding to K63‐linked ubiquitin chains. However, although it was significantly reduced, we clearly detected binding of the UBA‐mutated yeast DDI1 to K48‐linked ubiquitin chains. This contrasts with the complete abrogation of binding associated with a similar UBA mutation of Arabdopsis DDI (Table 1 and data not shown). This indicates a possible variation in the chain‐binding interface in yeast DDI1.  With respect to the indirect recognition of ubiquitylated substrates by UBL–UBA factors, it is not known whether the same proteasomal docking sites are used in a given species and whether the docking sites and associated interfaces are conserved across species. Arabdopsis uses RPN10, but not RPN1 and RPT5, to receive RAD23 and DSK2 through separate sites (UIM3 and UIM1, respectively) (see below and Table 2). We determined the potential role and associated domains/residues of the human and yeast RPN10 homologs in the recognition of UBL–UBA factors using pull‐down assays (Table 2 and Figs 1–2). Human and yeast RPN10 homologs were expressed and purified as T7‐tagged wild‐type or mutated variants; the UBL–UBA factors, including the RAD23, DSK2 and DDI1 homologs, were expressed and purified as GST‐tagged wild‐type or mutated variants (Table S1).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] As shown in Fig. 1A, the human RPN10 homolog (S5a) was pulled‐down readily by the GST‐fused RAD23 (hHR23b) or DSK2 (PLIC1) homolog, but not by DDI1. By contrast, yeast RPN10 was pulled‐down by GST‐fused DSK2, but not RAD23 and DDI1 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that, as for Arabdopsis RPN10, the human RPN10 homolog (S5a) can function as a potential docking subunit for both the RAD23 and DSK2 homologs. However, yeast RPN10 can serve as a docking subunit for DSK2 but not for RAD23 (Table 2).  The involvement of the UIM in the human and yeast RPN10 homologs in recognition of the RAD23 and/or DSK2 homologs was determined (Table 2) using single and double UIM mutations similar to those used in the chain‐binding analyses. Compared with wild‐type human S5a, recovery of the UIM1 or UIM2 mutant by GST‐fused hHR23b or PLIC1 was significantly reduced or completely abolished, respectively (Fig. 1A, uim1 and uim2). This indicates that UIM1 and, in particular, UIM2 of S5a play a critical role in the recognition of hHR23b and PLIC1. The amount of wild‐type S5a precipitated using GST‐fused hHR23b or PLIC1 did not reflect additive contributions from the two single UIM mutants. This indicates possible cooperation between UIM1 and UIM2 in S5a in the interaction with hHR23b and PLIC1 (Fig. 1A), in a way that is similar to their roles in ubiquitin chain binding (Fig. S1A). As expected, recovery of the double UIM mutant by either GST‐fused hHR23b or PLIC1 was also abrogated completely (uim1_2). For yeast RPN10, the UIM mutation abolished its recovery by GST‐fused DSK2. This indicates that it is critical for DSK2 recognition, in addition to its role in ubiquitin chain binding (Fig. 1B, uim).  Because the UIMs of RPN10 homologs are involved in recognition of the RAD23 and/or DSK2 homologs, it is rational to suggest that the potential hydrophobic patches in the UBLs of the RAD23 and DSK2 homologs, which are equivalent to the hydrophobic patch containing L8, I44 and V70 in ubiquitin, are involved in the association with the RPN10 homologs. In general, residues that correspond to L8, I44 and V70 of ubiquitin in the UBLs of the RAD23 and DSK2 homologs from Arabdopsis, humans and yeast are conserved. However, we observed a clear divergence in the corresponding residues in the UBLs of the yeast RAD23 and DDI1 homologs (Fig. S7), supporting their inability to associate with the RPN10 homolog. We examined the role and potential divergence of hydrophobic patches in the UBLs of the RAD23 and/or DSK2 homologs from Arabdopsis, humans and yeast in binding to RPN10. Two conserved residues that were equivalent to L8, I44 or V70 of ubiquitin in the UBLs of the RAD23 and DSK2 homologs from Arabdopsis and humans were replaced separately by alanine (Fig. S7). Replacement of the residue corresponding to L8 or I44 of ubiquitin in Arabdopsis RAD23 and I44 or V70 of ubiquitin in Arabdopsis DSK2 abrogated the RPN10 interaction (Table 2 and data not shown). Whereas similar replacements in the human RAD23 homolog (hHR23b; L8A) and the DSK2 homolog (PLIC1; I79A and V105A) abrogated the interaction with the human RPN10 homolog (S5a), replacement of the residue corresponding to I44 of ubiquitin in human hHR23b (I47A) did not (Fig. 2A). In yeast DSK2, replacement of the residue that corresponds to I44 or V70 of ubiquitin (I45 and V71, respectively) or their adjacent residue (L44 or L70, respectively) did not affect the association with RPN10 (Fig. 2B). Only the double‐alanine mutation at positions 44–45 (LI) or 70–71 (LV) and a UBL deletion mutant (UBLΔ; residues 1–73 deleted) of yeast DSK2 abolished the association with RPN10 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the UBLs of the human RAD23 and DSK2 homologs and yeast DSK2 play a role in the association with the RPN10 homolog. Furthermore, we detected a clear structural divergence in the UBL interfaces of human hHR23B and yeast DSK2, compared with the corresponding homologs in Arabdopsis (Table 2).  We further examined the overall structural conservation of the interfaces between RPN10 and RAD23 or DSK2 homologs using cross‐species interaction analyses. Wild‐type and single or double UIM variants of the RPN10 homolog from one species were tested using GST pull‐down assays to assess their ability to interact with the RAD23 (Fig. 3A–C) or DSK2 homologs (Fig. 3D–F) from different species. As shown in Fig. 3A, the single‐site mutation of UIM3 (uim3), but not of UIM1 or ‐2 (uim1 or uim2), abolished the association of RPN10 with the RAD23 homolog from humans or Arabdopsis. Furthermore, the double UIM mutant (uim1_2) containing an intact UIM3 motif associated with the Arabdopsis and human RAD23 homologs, but the double UIM mutants (uim2_3 and uim1_3) containing intact UIM1 or UIM2 motifs, respectively, did not. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 3B, human S5a was capable of interacting in a cooperative manner with the RAD23 homolog from humans or Arabdopsis through UIM2 and, to a lesser extent, UIM1. Interestingly, whereas the Arabdopsis and human RAD23 homologs were capable of interacting with yeast RPN10 through UIM (Fig. 3C), yeast RAD23 did not bind to yeast RPN10 or to the Arabdopsis and human RPN10 homologs (Fig. 3A–C, upper). These results indicate that the interfaces of the RPN10–RAD23 interaction are conserved in Arabdopsis and humans, and that UIM3 of Arabdopsis RPN10 and both UIM sites of human S5a play critical roles. However, whereas the UIM motif of yeast RPN10 is conserved through evolution for association with the RAD23 homologs from Arabdopsis and humans, the UBL of yeast RAD23 has diverged.  [[FIGURE]] Using single and double UIM mutations, we found that RPN10s from Arabdopsis and yeast were capable of interacting with DSK2 homologs from other species through UIM1 and UIM, respectively, as seen with DSK2 from their own species (Fig. 3D,F). For the human RPN10 homolog (S5a), both UIM1 and UIM2 facilitated association with the Arabdopsis and yeast DSK2 homolog (Fig. 3E). Whereas UIM2 played a more critical role in the interaction with the DSK2 homolog of both humans and Arabdopsis, UIM1 played a more critical role in the interaction with yeast DSK2 (Fig. 3E). The latter probably evolved to cope with the divergent UBL interface detected in yeast DSK2 (Fig. 2B).  As reported recently, the base subunit RPN13 is also capable of binding to UBL–UBA factors [CITATION]. We determined the roles and associated interfaces of Arabdopsis, human and yeast RPN13 homologs in the recognition of UBL–UBA factors (Table 2). Arabdopsis, human and yeast RPN13 and RPN10 (for comparison) homologs were purified as T7‐tagged proteins (Fig. 4A), and the UBL–UBA factors, including the RAD23, DSK2 and DDI1 homologs, were purified as GST‐tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B,D, Arabdopsis (AtRPN13) and yeast (ScRPN13) RPN13 homologs were recovered using GST‐fused DSK2, but not RAD23 and DDI1, homologs from their respective species. However, recovery occurred at a significantly lower level compared with the RPN10 homolog pulled‐down using GST‐fused Arabdopsis RAD23 homologs or DSK2a (Fig. 4B), or using GST‐fused yeast DSK2 (Fig. 4D). Human RPN13 was recovered using GST‐fused human hHR23b or PLIC1, but not DDI1, at a level slightly lower than that of S5a recovered using the respective GST‐fusion (Fig. 4C). The data indicate that Arabdopsis or yeast RPN13, which has a minor role compared with RPN10, is capable of functioning as a recognition subunit for DSK2, and that human RPN13 is capable of serving as the recognition subunit for both hHR23b and PLIC1.  [[FIGURE]] It is logical to propose that the interfaces/residues in the PRU domains of Arabdopsis and human RPN13 responsible for ubiquitin chain binding (Fig. S5) are also involved in recognition of the UBL–UBA factors. The same single‐residue mutants of RPN13 from Arabdopsis or humans as constructed for the ubiquitin‐binding experiments were used to determine their role in the recognition of RAD23 and/or DSK2 homologs. A few residues, including E72 and F91 (corresponding to D79 and F98 in mammalian RPN13), are also conserved in the potential PRU domain in yeast RPN13 (Fig. S4). Therefore, we mutated E72 and F91 to Q72 and R91, respectively, and tested their role in the recognition of yeast DSK2. In addition, we mutated L43 in yeast RPN13 at a position one residue away from F45 (corresponding to L56 of mammalian RPN13) to alanine, and tested this mutant also. All the tested residues appear to be critical for the interaction between the RPN13 and DSK2 homologs from Arabdopsis, yeast and humans. When compared with wild‐type proteins from Arabdopsis (Fig. 5A), yeast (Fig. 5B) and humans (Fig. 5C), the levels of the RPN13 variants recovered using the GST‐fused DSK2 homologs from the respective species were reduced drastically. However, apart from a slight reduction in the recovery of human RPN13 variant A56 using GST‐fused hHR23b, human RPN13 variants were recovered at a level equivalent to wild‐type RPN13 (Fig. 5D, Human). These observations indicate that Arabdopsis, human and yeast DSK2 homologs might be recognized by RPN13 homologs from the respective species using the conserved interfaces in the PRU domains [CITATION, CITATION], which are also critical for ubiquitin binding. Interestingly, the interface of the PRU of human RPN13, which is critical for the interaction with ubiquitin and PLIC1, is not required to bind hHR23b.  [[FIGURE]] Because the conserved residues of the PRU domain of Arabdopsis, human and yeast RPN13 homologs have roles in the interaction with the DSK2 homolog from the respective species, we decided to test the hydrophobic patches within the UBLs of the DSK2 homologs for their involvement in the interaction with RPN13. The potential involvement of the hydrophobic patch in the UBL of hHR23b was also examined. The UBL variants constructed for analysis of the association of RPN10 with human hHR23b and the DSK2 homologs from Arabdopsis, humans and yeast were examined for their association with RPN13. Whereas the recovery of human RPN13 was abrogated when the GST‐fused I79A or V105A PLIC1 variant was used (Fig. 6B), recovery of Arabdopsis RPN13 was abrogated using the GST‐fused Arabdopsis I61A DSK2a variant, but not the V87A variant (Fig. 6A). All the residues tested in yeast DSK2 affected RPN13 recognition. However, I45 and L44 appear to be more critical for the interaction with RPN13 than V71 and L70 (Fig. 6C). Recovery of yeast RPN13 was abolished when the GST‐fused I45A or L44A DSK2 single mutant, or the LI–AA (44–45) double mutant, was used. The recovery of yeast RPN13 was reduced significantly when using GST‐fused V71A, L70A or LV–AA (70–71) DSK2 mutants. As expected, the recovery of yeast RPN13 was abolished using the GST‐fused DSK2 UBL deletion mutant (Fig. 6C, UBLΔ). These results indicate clearly that structural divergence exists at the interfaces of the UBLs of Arabdopsis, human and yeast DSK2 homologs for RPN13 association.  [[FIGURE]] Human RPN13 was recovered at a similar level using the GST‐fused hHR23b or hHR23b variants (Fig. 6B; L8A and I47A), indicating that the hydrophobic patch in the UBL of hHR23b is nonessential for RPN13 association. This corroborates the aforementioned observation that the ubiquitin‐binding interface in the human RPN13 PRU is not critical for association with hHR23b (Fig. 5D), and that novel interfaces are probably involved.  We examined the overall structural conservation of the interfaces between the RPN13 and DSK2 homologs further using cross‐species interaction analyses. Arabdopsis RPN13 was recovered at a reduced efficiency using the GST‐fused human and yeast DSK2 homologs when compared with the level that was recovered using GST‐fused Arabdopsis DSK2a (Fig. 5A). Mutation of critical residues in the Arabdopsis RPN13 PRU disrupted this interaction (Fig. 5A). Human RPN13 was recovered at a similar level using GST‐fused human or yeast DSK2 homologs (Fig. 5C). The mutation of critical residues in the PRU of human RPN13 also disrupted the interaction (Fig. 5C). Yeast RPN13 was recovered only when using GST‐fused yeast DSK2, and not when using GST‐fused Arabdopsis or human DSK2 homologs (Fig. 5B). Our results suggest that the overall structure of the RPN13–DSK2 interface is conserved across species. However, the lack of cross‐species interaction between yeast RPN13 and either the human or Arabdopsis DSK2 homologs is in agreement with the observation of a greater divergence at critical positions on the PRU interface for yeast RPN13 (Fig. S4).  Interestingly, human RPN13 and its single‐mutation variants were recovered using GST‐fused Arabdopsis or yeast RAD23 homologs at a level similar to the recovery level observed when using GST‐fused hHR23b (Fig. 5D). This suggests that the interface of hHR23b responsible for its interaction with human RPN13 is conserved in the Arabdopsis and yeast RAD23 homologs. It also suggests that the interfaces of the Arabdopsis and yeast RPN13s, which correspond to the interface of human RPN13 that mediates the interaction with the RAD23 homologs, are divergent or have been deleted. In agreement with this suggestion, neither the Arabdopsis nor yeast RPN13 homolog was recovered when using GST‐fused hHR23b (data not shown).  As reported previously, RPN1 is the primary docking subunit for RAD23 in yeast [CITATION]. Yeast DSK2 also competes slightly for the interaction between RAD23 and the 26S proteasome, indicating that DSK2 can also be recognized by RPN1 [CITATION]. However, a direct interaction between Arabdopsis RPN1 and UBL–UBA factors, including the RAD23 and DSK2 homologs and DDI1, was not detected (data not shown). To confirm the possible role of yeast RPN1 and RPN10 in the recognition of RAD23 and DSK2, respectively, and to explore whether other potential proteasome subunits are important for the recognition of RAD23, DSK2 and DDI1, we searched for direct binding partners from the subunits of the regulatory particle (RP) of the 26S proteasome using yeast two‐hybrid (Y2H) analyses.  As shown in Fig. S8A, yeast RAD23, DSK2 and 17 RP subunits, including RPT1–6, RPN1–3 and RPN5–12, were analyzed as C‐terminal GAL4‐BD fusions and as C‐ and N‐terminal GAL4–AD fusions. DDI1 was tested as N‐ and C‐terminal GAL4–AD fusions. After analyzing all possible BD/AD fusion combinations between the RP subunits and UBL–UBA factors (Fig. S8A), we detected interactions between DSK2 and RPN10, and between RAD23 and RPN1 (Fig. S8D). An interaction between RAD23 and RPT6 was also detected. However, the interactions between RAD23 and RPN1 and RAD23 and RPT6 were weak, and only one of the two Y2H reporters (HIS3) was activated. These results support the observation that the recognition of RAD23 is mediated by RPN1 in yeast [CITATION]. In addition, the stronger Y2H interaction also suggests that the recognition of DSK2 could potentially be mediated by RPN10.  Based on in vitro interaction analyses, Arabdopsis RPN10 appears to play a critical role in both the direct and indirect recognition of ubiquitylated substrates of UPP. In agreement with this idea, rpn10‐1, a reported T‐DNA insertion mutant, has been shown to have pleiotropic phenotypes including a reduction in germination, growth rate, stamen number, genetic transmission through the male gametes, hormone‐induced cell division and seed set, as well as increased sensitivity to abscisic acid [CITATION]. A slight accumulation of ubiquitylated substrates and a specific and drastic stabilization of ABI5 were observed with rpn10‐1, indicating a defect in substrate targeting [CITATION]. The RPN10 protein in rpn10‐1 was expressed as a NPT‐II fusion, in which a C‐terminal fragment containing UIMs was truncated. This fusion protein was expressed at a very low level compared with that of RPN10 in wild‐type. However, the chimeric RPN10 was assembled into the 26S proteasome in rpn10‐1 at near wild‐type levels [CITATION].  We predicted that more severe phenotypes would be associated with a complete loss of RPN10 function. A new T‐DNA insertion mutant line of RPN10 in a Col‐0 background was obtained, and is designated here as rpn10‐2. In this line, the T‐DNA insertion was located in the fourth intron (Fig. 7A). A homozygous T‐DNA insertion line was obtained by segregating T2 plants (Fig. 7B, left); neither the wild‐type RPN10 transcript (Fig. 7B, right) nor its protein (Fig. 7C, upper) was detected, indicating that rpn10‐2 is a null mutant. As expected, rpn10‐2 showed more severe pleiotropic phenotypes than rpn10‐1. Phenotypes included: reduced growth rate; larger, thicker, lanceolar, serrated rosette and cauline leaves; delayed flowering time; reduced axillary inflorescences; longer internodes; increased length of pedicels; increased accumulation of anthocyanin; abnormal flower organ number; larger flower organs; larger petal cells; prolonged life cycle; delayed leaf senescence; increased plant height; defective male and female gametophytes; and infertility (Fig. 7D and data not shown). We also detected the accumulation of ubiquitylated substrates and free di‐ubiquitin (Fig. 7C, middle). Except for the gametophyte phenotypes, all the phenotypes (including conjugate accumulation) can be complemented when a wild‐type RPN10 coding region that is driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was reintroduced into rpn10‐2 (Fig. 7C,D and data not shown). Part of the reason for the lack of complementation of the gametophyte phenotypes is probably because of an absence of 35S promoter expression in the anthers [CITATION]. The detailed phenotypes of the rpn10‐2 plants and the complementation analyses are described in a separate study (Y.L. Lin and H. Fu, unpublished results).  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The GABI‐Kat T‐DNA insertion line GK‐734B02 (in the Col‐0 background) designated here as rpn10‐2 was ordered from the European Arabdopsis Stock Center (University of Nottingham, Loughborough, UK). The T‐DNA insertion site was determined by sequencing a PCR fragment amplified from the junction using the primer pair GABI‐LB2 and RPN10‐3′a. To complement the rpn10‐2 phenotypes, the Arabdopsis RPN10 coding region was amplified from first‐strand cDNAs using the primer pair cRPN10–Sma and cRPN10–Sst (these added SmaI and SstI restriction sites, respectively) and cloned into pBI121, downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter [CITATION]. This construct was mobilized into Agrobacterium GV3101 using a freeze–thaw method. Arabdopsis was transformed as described previously [CITATION]. To grow Col‐0, rpn10‐2 or complemented rpn10‐2 Arabdopsis, we surface sterilized the seeds using 20% bleach and 0.05% Tween 20 and stratified them for 3 days on plates at 4 °C in the dark. The seeds were germinated on half‐strength MS solid medium (0.8% agar, pH 5.8) supplemented with 1% sucrose. Two‐week‐old seedlings were transferred to soil (equal parts of humus, vermiculite and perlite) and grown using a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod with a light intensity of ∼ 120 μmol·m−2·s−1 at 22 °C.  For genotyping, a single rosette leaf was mashed in 600 μL of extraction buffer using a SH‐48 homogenizer (J&H Technology, Taipei, Taiwan) and the genomic DNA was extracted as described [CITATION]. For RT‐PCR, total RNA was isolated from 30‐day‐old rosette leaves using TRIzol according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND‐1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Three micrograms of total RNA were used for first‐strand cDNA synthesis in a 20 μL reaction using poly(T), random primers and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Sterile water was added to achieve a final volume of 150 μL, and 2.5 μL was used as the template for each PCR. The PCR primer pairs used to detect the endogenous RPN10, T‐DNA insertion, RPN10 complementation construct, RPN10 coding region and a UBQ10 cDNA fragment were RPN10‐5′b/RPN10‐3′B, RPN10‐3′B/GABI‐LB4, 35S‐Fw‐T/RPN10‐3′B, cRPN10‐Sma/cRPN10‐Sst and UBQ10‐5′/UBQ10‐3′, respectively. The sequences of the primers used are listed in 5′ to 3′ direction as follows:  RPN10‐3′a, CACCCGTGAATCACGGTGTGCTGGAAG; RPN10‐5′b, GAGTTTGACATCAATTTGCTACTTGCGTC; RPN10‐3′B, CTGCGGCCGCTGCAGCAGCTGCCGCAG; GABI‐LB2, GCTGATCCATGTAGATTTCCCCGGACATG; GABI‐LB4, CACGGATGATCTCGCGGAGGGTAG; 35S‐Fw‐T, CTCGGATTCCATTGCCCAGCTATCTG; cRPN10–Sma, TCCCCGGGATGGTTCTCGAGGCGACTATG; cRPN10–Sst, ATGAGCTCTCACTTCTTCTCATCCTCGCC; UBQ10‐5′, GTGGTGGTTTCTAAATCTCGTCTCTG; UBQ10‐3′, GAAGAAGTTCGACTTGTCATTAGAAAG.  To prepare crude protein extracts for the detection of RPN10, CSN5 and the ubiquitylated conjugates by immunoblotting, we ground rosette leaves in liquid nitrogen using an equal volume of pull‐down binding buffer (see below) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or 2 vol of sample buffer (to detect the ubiquitylated conjugates). Samples were dissolved by vortexing, incubated on ice for 5 min, centrifuged at 16 000 g and 4 °C, and filtered using 0.45 μm filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA). For pulling‐down endogenous Arabdopsis ubiquitin conjugates, we prepared the crude Arabdopsis extract from the upper parts of 1‐month‐old plants using pull‐down binding buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), 50 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) and 50 μmN‐ethylmaleimide (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The protein concentration was determined using Protein Assay reagent (Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).  The coding sequences for wild‐type, site‐mutagenized and deletion variants of Arabdopsis, yeast and human ubiquitin receptors were generated by PCR and inserted into either pET42a or pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) to yield constructs that encoded for GST/HIS‐ or T7/HIS‐tagged proteins, respectively (Table S1). Site‐directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuickChange Kit with PfuTurbo and paired primers that were centered at the mutation sites according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Double‐site mutants were generated by sequential mutagenesis. The coding sequences for human S5a (U51007), hHR23b (D21090), PLIC1 (BC010066), DDI1 (NM032341) and RPN13 (NM175573) were amplified using PCR from first‐strand cDNAs prepared from human HeLa S3 cells (Stratagene). The coding sequences for yeast RAD23, DSK2 and DDI1 were PCR‐amplified or subcloned (DSK2) from Y2H constructs (see the Doc. S1 and Table S1). The coding sequence for yeast RPN13 (U20939) was isolated from genomic DNA prepared from the DF5 strain [CITATION]. All expression constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).  The various recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells using the pET28a or pET42a expression plasmids (Novagen). Bacterial cultures were induced at D600 = 0.6 for protein expression with 1 mm isopropyl thio‐β‐d‐galactoside and incubated at 16, 30 or 37 °C depending on the construct. Escherichia coli cells were resuspended in 1× GST‐ or HIS‐binding buffer (Novagen), supplemented with 200 μg·mL−1 lysozyme, 0.1% NP‐40, 10% glycerol and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Resuspended cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and sonicated on ice for 5–10 min (15% power, 30‐s pulses with 30‐s intermittent pauses; Misonix XL2020, Farmingdale, NY, USA). His‐ and GST‐tagged recombinant proteins were purified by immobilized metal‐ or glutathione‐affinity chromatography, respectively (Novagen) using buffers and procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Purified proteins were dialyzed and concentrated in GST pull‐down binding buffer (see below) using Microcon Ultracel YM‐30 filter units (Millipore Corp.).  GST pull‐down experiments were performed using immobilized glutathione according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, the glutathione resin (25 μL final bed volume for each reaction) was washed five times with 400 μL of binding buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25 °C, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% NP‐40). GST‐fused baits were then individually immobilized on the resin in 400 μL of binding buffer for 2 h on ice (gently mixed by inverting). The immobilized baits were washed five times with 400 μL of binding buffer. A specific prey was then added, and the resin complexes were incubated for 2 h on ice, with gentle mixing by inverting. After five washes with 400 μL of binding buffer, the pulled‐down products were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer, analyzed by SDS/PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using chemiluminescence (Perkin–Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) or color development. The NaCl concentration in the binding buffer was increased to 150 mm when analyzing the interactions between the UBL–UBA factors and the RPN10 or RPN13 variants. To detect the ubiquitin chains or conjugates, the proteins were transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm; Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) following separation by SDS/PAGE. The membrane was then sandwiched between two glass plates and autoclaved for 20 min in transfer buffer to assist epitope exposure. For other immunoblotting assays, poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes were used (Perkin–Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). To visualize the pulled‐down ubiquitin chains, conjugates and T7‐tagged recombinant proteins, we used either rabbit anti‐human ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or mouse anti‐T7 primary serum (Novagen). Horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated goat anti‐(rabbit IgG) serum or anti‐(mouse IgG) serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as secondary antibodies. To detect RPN10, CSN5 and the conjugates from the Arabdopsis crude extracts, we used primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against Arabdopsis RPN10, CSN5 (custom‐made by Genesis Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan or purchased from Biomol, respectively), or human ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). These were used in conjunction with an alkaline phosphatase‐labeled goat anti‐(rabbit IgG) serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the substrates Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indolyl phosphate (Sigma‐Aldrich). The K48‐ and K63‐linked ubiquitin chains (Ub2–7) and tetra‐ubiquitin were purchased from BostonBiochem (Cambridge, MA, USA).  The presence of UIM, UBA and other protein domains was detected using available web programs from the ExPASy proteomics server (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, http://www.expasy.ch/). Routine sequence analyses were performed using version 10.3 of the wisconsin gcg package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA).
