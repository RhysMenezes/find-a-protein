!~ABS~! Suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3) is involved in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)-dependent small-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways in Arabidopsis. However, the roles of SGS3 in those pathways are unclear. Here, we show that SGS3 interacts and colocalizes with RDR6 in cytoplasmic granules. Interestingly, the granules containing SGS3 and RDR6 (named SGS3/RDR6-bodies) were distinct from the processing bodies where mRNAs are decayed and/or stored. Microscopic analyses and complementation experiments using SGS3-deletion mutants suggested that proper localization of SGS3 is important for its function. These results provide novel insights into RDR6-dependent siRNA formation in plants.
!~RES~! We first examined the subcellular localization of SGS3. SGS3–mCherry fusion protein (SGS3:mCherry) was expressed in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana by agroinfiltration. At 2dpi, we observed SGS3:mCherry localization in certain granules in the cytoplasm, as previously reported (CITATION A and CITATION) CITATION. A previous study reported that RDR6 mainly localizes in the nucleus CITATION. However, considering that SGS3 functions together with RDR6 CITATION, RDR6 should also localize in the same cytoplasmic granules. Therefore, we next examined the localization of RDR6. As shown in CITATIONB and CITATION, RDR6–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein (RDR6:GFP) was mainly localized to cytoplasmic granules, similar to SGS3:mCherry. We then coexpressed SGS3:mCherry with RDR6:GFP and observed that the green and red signals merged perfectly in the same cytoplasmic granules (CITATIONC and CITATION). Next, we examined whether the SGS3 granules are related to some well known organelles like chloroplasts, mitochondria or Golgi apparatus. The granules were not merged with such characterized organelles CITATION. To test the interaction between SGS3 and RDR6, we performed bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) analysis. We coexpressed yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)N:SGS3, which has the N-terminal half of YFP at the N-terminus of SGS3, and YFPC:RDR6, which has the C-terminal half of YFP fused to the N-terminus of RDR6, in N. benthamiana leaves. At 2dpi, we detected BiFC signals in the cytoplasmic granules (CITATIOND and CITATION). As negative controls, we checked another three combinations (YFPN plus YFPC, YFPN:SGS3 plus YFPC, and YFPN plus YFPC:RDR6), and confirmed that no BiFC signals were detected. YFPN plus YFPC was shown in CITATION. These results show that SGS3 and RDR6 specifically interact in the cytoplasmic granules. Dicer-like 4 (DCL4) cleaves dsRNAs synthesized by RDR6 into siRNAs, and is indispensable for siRNA pathways in which RDR6 is involved CITATION. A previous paper reported that DCL4 localizes in the nucleus by using a partial N-terminal region of DCL4 CITATION. Based on SGS3 and RDR6 localization data, we hypothesized that full-length DCL4 localizes not only in the nucleus, but also to SGS3/RDR6-bodies. To test this, we generated a full-length DCL4–Venus fusion construct (DCL4:Venus) and expressed that in N. benthamiana leaves together with a nuclear marker, nucleolin:mCherry. At 2dpi, we observed DCL4:Venus localization only in nuclei (CITATIONE) and failed to detect cytoplasmic granules. Processing-bodies (P-bodies) are well characterised cytoplasmic granules. We and other groups have shown the existence of P-bodies in plants by characterizing Arabidopsis decapping enzymes, AtDCP1 and AtDCP2, which make certain cytoplasmic granules CITATION. In addition, we have recently shown that Arabidopsis argonaute (AGO)1, which is involved in miRNA, TAS1/TAS2-ta-siRNA, sense-transgene silencing and anti-virus silencing pathways CITATION, also localized in P-bodies [Fujioka et al., unpublished data]. Because SGS3, RDR6 and AGO1 function together in some silencing pathways, we tested whether the granules containing SGS3 and RDR6 are in fact P-bodies. We first co-expressed either SGS3:GFP or RDR6:GFP together with DCP1:mCherry, which is a plant P-body marker. Interestingly, granules containing SGS3 and RDR6 did not overlap with those containing DCP1 (CITATION A and B). We then co-expressed YFPN:SGS3 and YFPC:RDR6 together with DCP1:mCherry and observed that BiFC fluorescence of YFPN:SGS3 and YFPC:RDR6 did not overlap with the fluorescence of DCP1:mCherry (CITATIONC). These results indicate that granules consisting of SGS3 and RDR6 (hereafter referred to as SGS3/RDR6-bodies) are different from P-bodies. It should be noted that some SGS3/RDR6-bodies were located adjacent to P-bodies (CITATION), suggesting that SGS3/RDR6-bodies may have some functional relationships with P-bodies. SGS3 has three domains referred to as ZF, XS, and CC (CITATION A). To investigate which domains are important for the localization of SGS3, we made a wild-type SGS3 construct and three deletion constructs, SGS3ΔZF, SGS3ΔXS, and SGS3ΔCC, which have respective deletions in the ZF, XS, and CC domains, fused with GFP at their C termini (named as SGS3:GFP, SGS3ΔZF:GFP, SGS3ΔXS:GFP, and SGS3ΔCC:GFP, respectively). Typical localization patterns of these constructs and parental SGS3:GFP are shown in CITATIONB–E and the observed number of granules is shown in CITATIONF. We verified the expression of these proteins by Western blot analysis (CITATIONG). The numbers of granules of SGS3ΔXS:GFP or SGS3ΔCC:GFP were greatly decreased compared with that of SGS3:GFP and SGS3ΔZF:GFP. In addition, granules containing SGS3ΔXS:GFP and SGS3ΔCC:GFP showed different shapes compared with those containing SGS3:GFP; almost all SGS3ΔXS:GFP granules and some SGS3ΔCC:GFP granules localized together and formed large granules (CITATIOND and E). These results indicate that the XS and the CC domains are important for proper SGS3 localization. To examine the importance of ZF, XS, and CC domains for SGS3 function in planta, we introduced wild-type SGS3 or the deletion constructs of SGS3 attached with a FLAG epitope under control of the native SGS3 promoter and terminator into the sgs3-13 mutant CITATION (CITATION A). Leaves of sgs3-13 plants curled downward and were narrower than those of Col-0 plants as reported previously CITATION (CITATIONB). T1 plants of the sgs3-13 mutant transformed with SGS3:FLAG (SGS3 in sgs3-13) showed round leaf phenotype like Col-0 plants. This result indicated that the sgs3-13 mutant was fully complemented by our parental SGS3:FLAG transgene. On the other hand, sgs3-13 mutants transformed with either SGS3ΔZF:FLAG, SGS3ΔXS:FLAG or SGS3ΔCC:FLAG (SGS3ΔZF in sgs3-13, SGS3ΔXS in sgs3-13 or SGS3ΔCC in sgs3-13), all T1 plants showed narrow leaf phenotypes like the sgs3-13 plants (CITATIONB). These results suggest that the ZF, XS, and CC domains are all important for SGS3 function in planta. Indeed, a ta-siRNA, siR255, of each mutant (SGS3ΔZF in sgs3-13, SGS3ΔXS in sgs3-13 or SGS3ΔCC in sgs3-13) was not restored although that of SGS3 in sgs3-13 was restored (CITATIONC).
