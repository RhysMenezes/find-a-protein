!~ABS~! Compared with the well-studied biochemical function of NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN1 (NAP1) as a histone chaperone in nucleosome assembly/disassembly, the physiological roles of NAP1 remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we define the NAP1 gene family members in Arabidopsis, examine their molecular properties, and use reverse genetics to characterize their biological roles. We show that the four AtNAP1-group proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers, can bind histone H2A, and are localized abundantly in the cytoplasm and weakly in the nucleus at steady state. AtNAP1;4 differs from the others by showing inhibitor-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and tissue-specific expression, restricted to root segments and pollen grains. The other three AtNAP1 genes are ubiquitously expressed in plants and the AtNAP1;3 protein is detected as the major isoform in seedlings. We show that disruption of the AtNAP1-group genes does not affect normal plant growth under our laboratory conditions. Interestingly, two allelic triple mutants, Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-1 and Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-2, exhibit perturbed genome transcription, and show hypersensitivity to DNA damage caused by UV-C irradiation. We show that AtNAP1;3 binds chromatin, with enrichment at some genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, and that the expression of these genes is downregulated in the triple mutants. Taken together, our results highlight conserved and isoform-specific properties of AtNAP1 proteins, and unravel their function in the NER pathway of DNA damage repair.
!~RES~! AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 share 74–83% identity with each other, and 41–43% identity with AtNAP1;4, but only share <23% identity with NRP1 and NRP2 (for sequence alignments, see Figure S1). The functional NAP1 exists as a stable dimer (CITATION), and previous studies using pull-down assays revealed that the tobacco proteins Nicta;NAP1;3 and Nicta;NAP1;4 self-bind and bind between each other (CITATION). The Arabidopsis proteins NRP1 and NRP2 also self-bind and bind between each other (CITATION). We first investigated direct protein–protein interactions among AtNAP1 proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Figure 1(a), AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 can self-bind and bind between each other. It is interesting to note that in spite of its more diverged sequence, AtNAP1;4 shows a higher binding activity with AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3. As expected for controls, the transcriptional factors ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) and AS2 show a positive binding activity, as has been previously reported by CITATION, and two empty vectors or combinations of one empty vector with one AtNAP1-expressing vector (excepting AtNAP1;4) do not show positive results. Because of its autoactivation when cloned in the pGBKT7 vector, the self-binding activity of AtNAP1;4 could not be examined in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We further investigated protein–protein interactions in pull-down assays. Total protein extracts from plants expressing YFP-AtNAP1;2, YFP-AtNAP1;3 or YFP-AtNAP1;4 were precipitated by beads coated with 6xHis-AtNAP1;1, 6xHis-AtNAP1;2, 6xHis-AtNAP1;3, 6xHis-AtNAP1;4 or 6xHis-NRP1. As shown in Figure 1(b), YFP-AtNAP1;2, YFP-AtNAP1;3 and YFP-AtNAP1;4 bind 6xHis-AtNAP1;1, 6xHis-AtNAP1;2, 6xHis-AtNAP1;3 and 6xHis-AtNAP1;4, but not 6xHis-NRP1. H2A-YFP was found to bind 6xHis-fused AtNAP1 proteins as well as NRP1 (Figure 1b). Taken together, these results indicate that different AtNAP1 isoforms can form homodimers and heterodimers, but not with NRP1. [[FIGURE]] We investigated the subcellular localization of AtNAP1 proteins in living cells by using YFP as a marker of visualization. YFP alone is small enough to diffuse across the nuclear envelope, and is localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco BY2 cells (not shown). YFP-AtNAP1;1, YFP-AtNAP1;2, YFP-AtNAP1;3 and YFP-AtNAP1;4 were all found to be localized primarily in the cytoplasm of transgenic Arabidopsis (Figure 2a–d) and BY2 cells (Figure 2e–h). Treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) revealed that YFP-AtNAP1;4 (Figure 2i), but not the other AtNAP1 isoforms (data not shown), shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in transgenic tobacco BY2 cells. [[FIGURE]] In order to facilitate the analysis of endogenous AtNAP1 proteins, we searched for antibodies recognizing AtNAP1 proteins. The antibody produced earlier against Nicta;NAP1;4 (CITATION) recognized the recombinant proteins AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 with similar affinities, but did not cross-react with AtNAP1;4, NRP1 or NRP2 (Figure 3a). Western blot analyses on total protein extracts of 9-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings revealed that AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 are present at this growth stage (Figure 3b). Comparison of wild-type with mutants (see later for mutant descriptions) indicates that AtNAP1;3 migrates at a higher molecular-weight position, and is present at a much more abundant level in the wild-type extract compared with AtNAP1;1 and AtNAP1;2 (Figure 3b). Both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (CITATION) and northern analyses (not shown) indicate that although the AtNAP1;4 transcript level is barely detectable (see below for the specific expression of AtNAP1;4), the transcript levels of AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 are similarly high. It is thus likely that a post-transcriptional mechanism differentially regulates the protein synthesis and/or stability of AtNAP1;3, compared with AtNAP1;1 and AtNAP1;2. [[FIGURE]] We further examined the cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of AtNAP1 proteins by subcellular fractionation. As shown in Figure 3(c), the AtNAP1 proteins (mostly AtNAP1;3) are found in the total and cytoplasmic fractions, and are also found in the nuclear fraction, but at a much lower level. The controls, dimethyl-histone H4 lysine 4 (H3K4m2) as a nuclear marker and tubulin as a cytoplasmic marker, yield the expected results (Figure 3c), thereby validating our fractionation. These results are consistent with previous observations on the predominant cytoplasmic localization of AtNAP1 proteins, and provide additional information by showing that small quantities of AtNAP1 proteins are present in the nucleus. The detection of AtNAP1 proteins in the nucleus conforms their proposed histone chaperone activities in nucleosome assembly/disassembly. Previous RT-PCR analysis revealed that AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 genes are ubiquitously expressed in all material examined, including seedlings, roots, stems and young flower buds, whereas the expression of AtNAP1;4 was undetectable using up to 30 cycles of amplification (CITATION). To test the possibility that AtNAP1;4 is expressed in a low number of cells of specific types, we fused the β-glucuronidase (GUS) cDNA to the genomic clone of AtNAP1;4 (Figure 4a). The clone contained the exons and introns, as well as 619 bp of the upstream sequences from the predicted translational start site of the AtNAP1;4 gene. Consistent with the RT-PCR study, AtNAP1;4::AtNAP1;4-GUS activity was undetectable in most plant tissues examined, except the root segment covering the apical end of the differentiation zone, the elongation zone of the root (Figure 4b) and the mature pollen within the anthers of open flowers (Figure 4c,d). This tissue-specific expression of AtNAP1;4::AtNAP1;4-GUS was reproducibly observed in eight independent transgenic lines. Re-examination by RT-PCR revealed that AtNAP1;4 transcripts were detectable from wild-type inflorescences using 41 cycles of amplification (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To investigate the function of AtNAP1, we obtained T-DNA insertion lines from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm). One T-DNA insertion mutant allele each was identified for AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;4, and two independent mutant alleles were identified for AtNAP1;3 (Figure 5a). In all of these insertion lines, the T-DNA segregated as a single locus. Homozygous (hereafter called mutant) plants were obtained for each of these T-DNA insertion lines by self-pollination. For convenience, the mutants Atnap1;1-1, Atnap1;2-1, Atnap1;3-1, Atnap1;3-2 and Atnap1;4 were named m1, m2, m3-1, m3-2 and m4, respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the full-length transcripts of the corresponding genes were undetectable in the mutant plants (Figure 5b), indicating that T-DNA insertions caused the loss of function of the AtNAP1 genes. None of the mutants showed detectable growth modifications. The increased growth of leaves previously reported for Atnap1;1-1 (CITATION) was not reproduced under our in vitro culture and glasshouse growth conditions. [[FIGURE]] Considering their overlapping expression pattern and their high conservation of protein sequences and properties, it is likely that AtNAP1 genes have redundant functions. Because AtNAP1;4 differs from the other three AtNAP1 genes and shows a tissue-specific expression, we subsequently focused our work on m1, m2, m3-1 and m3-2 to obtain double and triple mutants to investigate overlapping functions. Through crosses between different mutants, selfing segregation and PCR genotyping (see Figure S2), we obtained the double mutants Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 (m12), Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;3-1 (m13-1), Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;3-2 (m13-2), Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-1 (m23-1) and Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-2 (m23-2), as well as the triple mutants Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-1 (m123-1) and Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 tnap1;3-2 (m123-2). Remarkably, all these double and triple mutants show a wild-type phenotype (Figure 5c for m123-1; data not shown for other mutants). RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the corresponding AtNAP1 genes were knocked down in the mutants (Figure 5b). Western blot analysis also confirmed that the corresponding AtNAP1 proteins were undetectable in the mutants (Figure 3b). In addition, we noticed that AtNAP1;3 levels were elevated in m1, m2 and m12, and that AtNAP1;1/AtNAP1;2 levels were elevated in m3-1 compared with wild-type seedlings (Figure 3b), suggesting a homeostatic compensation mechanism. Nonetheless, AtNAP1;4 transcripts were undetectable in the seedlings of all mutants (including m123-1 and m123-2) and the wild-type by RT-PCR, using up to 41 cycles of amplification. This last observation did not support the assumption that AtNAP1;4 could be ectopically expressed, which would compensate for the loss of function of other AtNAP1 proteins in the mutants. Plants with loss-of-function of AtNAP1 genes grow in a macroscopically similar manner to wild-type plants under our laboratory in vitro culture and glasshouse growth conditions. This is unexpected in view of the predicted fundamental function of NAP1 in nucleosome assembly. To investigate the molecular phenotypes of the mutant plants, we performed global transcriptome analysis. To avoid the redundancy problem of different AtNAP1 genes, we focused on triple mutant analysis using the Affymetrix ATH1 array, which contains more than 22 500 probe sets, representing approximately 24 000 Arabidopsis genes (http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/arab.affx). In 6-day-old seedlings, 402 genes were found to be downregulated and 86 genes were found upregulated in both m123-1 and m123-2 mutants, compared with the wild type (Figure 6a). As expected, AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2 and AtNAP1;3 were among the downregulated genes. Among the differentially expressed genes found in triple mutants, some are potentially involved in protein phosphorylation, gene transcription, phytohormone and stress responses, and DNA repair (Table S1). We further investigated the expression of some DNA repair genes by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Consistent with transcriptome data, we found that the expression of AtCEN1, AtCEN2 and AtXPB, genes involved in the NER pathway (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), is downregulated by more than twofold in the m123-1 mutant compared with the wild type (Figure 6b). The NER pathway gene AtXPC (CITATION) was among the downregulated genes found in the m123-2 mutant, but not in the m123-1 mutant (Table S1). RT-PCR confirmed the downregulation of AtXPC in the m123-2 mutant (not shown), and also revealed a downregulation of about 1.5-fold in the m123-1 mutant (Figure 6b). In contrast, the other genes examined, including AtXPD, AtXPF, AtXPG and AtRAD23-1, which are potentially involved in the NER pathway (CITATION), as well as AtRAD51, AtRAD54 and AtATM, which are involved in the double-strand break (DSB) DNA repair pathway (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), did not show major changes of expression in the mutant (Figure 6b). This is also consistent with transcriptome data. Analysis of gene expression in response to UV treatment revealed that expression of AtCEN1, AtCEN2 and to a lesser degree AtXPB is induced by UV in both the wild type and the m123-1 mutant, albeit at a weaker level in the mutant (Figure 6c). It indicates that AtNAP1 proteins are dispensable for initiation, but have an expression enhancer role for these genes. [[FIGURE]] The downregulation of some genes involved in the NER pathway prompted us to investigate the physiological phenotype of Atnap1 triple mutants in response to DNA damages. We tested plant growth in the presence of bleomycin and hydroxyurea, inhibitors of the DSB repair pathway and DNA synthesis, respectively. No significant difference was observed between m123-1 and wild-type plants in response to these inhibitors (data not shown). Interestingly, compared with the wild type, both m123-1 and m123-2 triple mutants exhibit a more pronounced reduction in growth and pale-green phenotype in response to UV-C damage (Figure 7a). The recovery rates of m123-1 and m123-2 were much lower than that of the wild type after UV-C treatment (Figure 7b). We further investigated the efficiency of DNA repair by cell extracts of wild-type, m123-1 and m123-2 mutant plants using a previously described in vitro assay (CITATION). In this assay, the DNA repair efficiency is evaluated by incorporation of DIG-labeled dUTP in a UV-damaged plasmid DNA. As shown in Figure 7c, cell extracts prepared from the mutant plants show a less efficient DNA repair efficiency than that from the wild-type plants (Figure 7c). Taken together, our data indicate that AtNAP1 genes play important roles in the NER pathway, which is involved in the repair of DNA lesions caused by UV-C. [[FIGURE]] Using ChIP assays, we investigated the chromatin-binding activity of AtNAP1;3 at DNA repair genes. ChIP fractions from the m12 and m123-1 mutant plants were analyzed by quantitative PCR using gene-specific primers (see Table S2 for primer information). The values were normalized by input so as to minimize the variation introduced by the variable efficiency of the primers, then the values obtained in m12 (in which AtNAP1;3 is present) were subtracted from those obtained in m123-2 (in which AtNAP1;3 is absent) so as to enhance the specificity of detection of AtNAP1;3, and finally the relative binding activity at different regions within the promoters (P) and exons (E) of the genes were referenced against that at AtACT2-P, which is given a value of 1 (Figure 7d). The binding activity of AtNAP1;3 at AtCEN1-E, AtRAD51, AtRAD54 and AtATM was found to be similar to that at AtACT2, whereas the binding activities at AtCEN1-P, AtCEN2 and AtXPB1 were about 1.3–1.9-fold higher. This higher binding activity correlates with the downregulation of AtCEN1, AtCEN2 and AtXPB1 found in the triple mutants m123-1 and m123-2, thus suggesting that AtNAP1 proteins are positive regulators of expression of these NER-pathway genes.
!~MM~! All A. thaliana alleles were derived from the Columbia ecotype. Atnap1;1-1, Atnap1;2-1, Atnap1;3-1, Atnap1;3-2 and Atnap1;4-1 alleles correspond to SALK_013610, SALK_131746, SAIL_373_H11, SAIL_84_B01 and BX290796 of T-DNA insertion lines from the ABRC. Different combinations of double and triple mutants were obtained in our laboratory by genetic crossing (see Figure S1). In vitro plant culture was performed on agar-solidified MS medium M0255 (Duchefa, http://www.duchefa.com), supplemented with 0.9% sucrose. Plants were grown at 21°C under 16-h light/8-h dark conditions. The AtNAP1;1, AtNAP1;2, AtNAP1;3 and AtNAP1;4 cDNAs were obtained by RT-PCR using primer pairs N123P1/N1P2, N123P1/N2P2, N123P1/N3P2 and N4P1/N4P2 (Table S2), respectively. The resulting PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T vector and then sequenced to confirm the absence of sequence errors, resulting in pGEM-T-AtNAP1;1, pGEM-T-AtNAP1;2, pGEM-T-AtNAP1;3 and pGEM-T-AtNAP1;4. The AtNAP1 cDNAs were then subcloned into the pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com). Constructs of AS1 and AS2 were described previously (CITATION). Protein–protein interactions were examined according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Clontech). The AtNAP1 cDNAs were cut from the pGEM-T vector, fused with the 3′ end of YFP cDNA and then subcloned under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in the pCAMBIA1301 binary vector (CAMBIA, http://www.cambia.org). The resulting plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and the resulting strains were used to transform Arabidopsis plants and tobacco BY2 cells, as described previously (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants expressing H2A-YFP were also described previously (CITATION). The AtNAP1 cDNAs were cut from the pGEM-T vector and subcloned into the pET-30a vector (Novagen, http://www.emdbiosciences.com/html/NVG/home.html) to produce 6xHis-tagged recombinant proteins. Vectors for 6xHis-NRP1 and 6xHis-NRP2 were previously described by CITATION. The production and purification of 6xHis-tagged recombinant proteins were performed as described by CITATION. A 10-mg portion of purified recombinant 6xHis-AtNAP1;1, 6xHis-AtNAP1;2, 6xHis-AtNAP1;3, 6xHis-AtNAP1;4 or 6xHis-NRP1 protein was coupled to 1 ml of BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham, now part of GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com). The resulting resin was used in the pull-down assays, according to a previously described protocol (CITATION). Total protein extracts from about 10 g of 2-week-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing YFP-AtNAP1;2, YFP-AtNAP1;3, YFP-AtNAP1;4 or H2A-YFP were each distributed equally to the aforementioned five recombinant protein-coated resins. A quarter of each pull-down fraction was used for Western blot analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore, http://www.millipore.com). The membrane was blotted with specific antibodies. The antibodies used in this study are: the anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, now part of Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Molecular-Probes.html) at a dilution of 1:5000, the anti-Nicta;NAP1;4 mice polyclonal antibodies (CITATION) at a dilution of 1:2000, the anti-dimethyl H3K4 (cat. no. 07-030; Millipore) at a dilution of 1:2000, the anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (cat. no. T6199; Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) at a dilution of 1:10 000. The epifluorescence and differential interference contrast images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope (model LSM510; Zeiss, http://www.zeiss.com). For subcellular fractionation, about 2 g of 9-day-old seedlings were infiltrated with extraction buffer [400 mm sucrose, 10 mm 2-(N-morpholine)-ethanesulphonic acid (MES), pH 5.3, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mm DTT and 1x complete protease inhibitor] and ground in 9 ml of the same buffer. After passage through a 100-μm filter, the lysate was layered on top of a discontinuous gradient consisting of successive 4-ml layers of iodixanol 15% and 45% in the extraction buffer. The discontinuous gradient was centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min at 4°C. the cytoplasmic fraction was obtained from the top of the 15% iodixanol layer, and the nuclei fraction was obtained from the 15/45% iodixanol interface. The pure nuclei were washed three times with the extraction buffer. A 10-mg portion of whole-cell extract and the corresponding equivalent cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were used for Western blot analysis. The genomic fragment of AtNAP1;4 was PCR amplified using primers N4-Pro-5′ and N4-Pro-3′ (see Table S2), and was then cloned into the HindIII–SmaI restriction sites of vector pBI101, resulting in pAtNAP1;4::AtNAP1;4-GUS. This construct contains a 619-bp upstream section of the predicted translational start site, and all exons and introns of AtNAP1;4, and is fused in frame with the reporter GUS at the last exon. The construct was introduced into Arabidopsis plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A histochemical GUS enzyme activity assay was performed as described by CITATION. The essential results were reproducibly obtained from more than 10 plants for each transgenic line. Total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega, http://www.promega.com) and quantitative RT-PCR with the kit from Takara (http://www.takara-bio.com). The gene-specific primers used in the PCR analysis are presented in Table S2. Six-day-old homozygous m123-1, m123-2 and wild-type Col (control) seedlings were harvested, and total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen). The microarray analyses were performed by using Affymetrix gene chips at Shanghai Huaguan Biochip (http://www.hgbiochip.com/english.html). Data analysis was performed using genespring 5 software (Silicon Genetics, now part of Agilent, http://www.agilent.com). The expression profiles, each in duplicate, of m123-1 and m123-2 plants were compared with those of wild-type Col plants (m123-1 versus Col and m123-2 versus Col). Genes of m123-1 and m123-2 mutant plants exhibiting the same increase or decrease in expression level in each replicate were considered as upregulated or downregulated, respectively. In addition, a threshold of twofold or greater change was used for producing the final lists of upregulated and downregulated genes in m123-1 and m123-2. To evaluate the plant response to UV, 8-day-old in vitro germinated plants were irradiated with a dose of 3750 J m−2 of UV-C (254 nm) using a Minerallight-Lamp (UVP, http://www.uvp.com) three times every 24 h. Plants were immediately returned to the growth chamber after each exposure. The phenotype was observed 13 days after the last UV treatment. For analysis of gene expression in response to UV treatment, 6-day-old seedlings were irradiated three times with 500 J m−2 UV-C, and then incubated for recovery in a growth chamber for 2 h before RNA isolation. The in vitro DNA repair assay was performed according to the method described by CITATION. The linearized pGEX plasmid was treated by UV-C (450 J m−2) using the Stratalinker (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com) to increase the DNA damage. We used 25 μg of plant protein extracts per time point mixed with 300 ng of UV-C-treated pGEX, together with 300 ng of linearized pBSK plasmid, which was not pre-treated by UV-C. Incorporation of DIG-labeled 2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate (dUTP) in the plasmids was detected as previously described by CITATION. About 2 g of 6-day-old seedlings were used for ChIP analysis, which was performed as described by CITATION. The gene-specific primers used in the ChIP analysis are presented in Table S2.
