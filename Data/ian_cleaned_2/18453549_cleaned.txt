!~ABS~! Organelle (mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants) genomes lost a large number of genes after endosymbiosis occurred. Even after this major gene loss, organelle genomes still lose their own genes, even those that are essential, via gene transfer to the nucleus and gene substitution of either different organelle origin or de novo genes. Gene transfer and substitution events are important processes in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. Gene loss is an ongoing process in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of higher plants. The gene for ribosomal protein S16 (rps16) is encoded in the chloroplast genome of most higher plants but not in Medicago truncatula and Populus alba. Here, we show that these 2 species have compensated for loss of the rps16 from the chloroplast genome by having a mitochondrial rps16 that can target the chloroplasts as well as mitochondria. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Oryza sativa, whose chloroplast genomes encode the rps16, we show that the product of the mitochondrial rps16 has dual targeting ability. These results suggest that the dual targeting of RPS16 to the mitochondria and chloroplasts emerged before the divergence of monocots and dicots (140–150 MYA). The gene substitution of the chloroplast rps16 by the nuclear-encoded rps16 in higher plants is the first report about ongoing gene substitution by dual targeting and provides evidence for an intermediate stage in the formation of this heterogeneous organelle.
!~RES~! Although the order and number of genes on the chloroplast genome are highly conserved in higher plants (CITATION), it has been reported that the rps16 is missing from the chloroplast genome of P. alba and P. trichocarpa (CITATION; CITATION) and M. truncatula (CITATION). This indicates that the rps16 should be transferred from the chloroplast to the nuclear genome in these species. Therefore, a TBlastN search in TIGR EST database of the Medicago and Populus genera (default parameter) was conducted by using the RPS16 amino acid sequence from the A. thaliana chloroplast genome (CITATION) as a query. Two independent ESTs encoding RPS16 protein were found in each species, from which we obtained RT-PCR products (GenBank accession numbers: P. alba, AB365529 and AB365530 and M. truncatula, AB365526 and AB365527). The deduced amino acids from the 2 rps16 genes in each species indicate that high amino acid identity remains between both genes (P. alba 55% and M. truncatula 48%) (fig. 1). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] There has been no report that the mitochondrial rps16 is encoded in the mitochondrial genome to date. And, it has been reported that the mitochondrial rps16 was transferred from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus at early stages of eukaryotic evolution (CITATION). This strongly suggests that the 2 copies of the nuclear-encoded rps16 found in P. alba and M. truncatula are the genes transferred from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome and that the duplication occurred in the past. Importantly, RPS16 proteins were predicted to be localized in the mitochondria by the localization prediction programs, TargetP and Predotar. However, homologues of the rps16 in the EST database of the Medicago and Populus genera have never been found. This raises the possibility that mitochondrial ribosomal protein is located not only to the mitochondria but also to the chloroplasts. Here, it should be noted that localization prediction programs predicted that they would be located to the mitochondria. To evaluate the possibility of the chloroplast-targeting ability of the nuclear-encoded rps16 in angiosperms, we attempted to determine the organelle to which 4 rps16 genes in M. truncatula and P. alba were located. Their open reading frames (ORFs) obtained by RT-PCR were fused to the upstream of the gene for GFP. The chimeric genes were introduced into A. thaliana suspension cells (Alex) by A.tumefaciens–mediated transfection. Expression of the genes was monitored 5 days after its introduction using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The locations of the chimeric GFP proteins and the mitochondria stained by MitoTracker were visualized as green and red signals, respectively. Chloroplasts (plastids in suspension cells) were also visualized as red signals by chloroplast-targeted RFP. The GFP-fused proteins of M. truncatula RPS16-1 showed the same pattern as the red signals of chloroplast-targeted RFP (fig. 2A): They were located only in the plastids. On the other hand, those of M. truncatula (RPS16-2) and P. alba (RPS16-1 and RPS16-2) showed the same pattern as that of the red signals derived from MitoTracker and chloroplast-targeted RFP (fig. 2A): They were dually targeted to both the mitochondria and plastids. These results strongly suggest that the nuclear-encoded rps16 genes in M. truncatula and P. alba have substituted for the RPS16 protein encoded in chloroplast genomes. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] O. sativa and A. thaliana, whose chloroplast genomes encode the rps16 (CITATION; CITATION), each have 2 rps16 genes in independent nuclear loci (GenBank accession numbers: O. sativa, Os09g0498100 and Os08g0517900 and A. thaliana, At4g34620 and At5g56940). The 2 rps16 genes in each species retained high amino acid identity between them (O. sativa 87% and A. thaliana 57%), as found for M. truncatula and P. alba. The deduced amino acids of RPS16 in higher plants show similarities (fig. 1). This suggests that the rps16 genes in A. thaliana and O. sativa, whose chloroplast genomes encode the rps16, also have the capability of dual targeting to the mitochondria and chloroplasts, similarly to P. alba and M. truncatula. To evaluate this possibility, the deduced amino acids from 4 rps16 genes in A. thaliana and O. sativa were fused to the upstream of the gene for GFP and introduced into A. thaliana suspension cells (Alex). Results indicate that in A. thaliana, RPS16-2 could be dually targeted to the mitochondria and plastids. Interestingly, the RPS16-1 could not be located to the mitochondria clearly, although it could be targeted to the plastids (fig. 2B). In O. sativa, both RPS16 proteins could be localized in the mitochondria and chloroplasts (fig. 2B). The above results strongly suggest that the gene substitution event of the chloroplast rps16 had already occurred via the dual targeting ability of the nuclear-encoded rps16, that is, in the intermediate stage in A. thaliana and O. sativa. The above 4 plants (A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. alba, and M. truncatula) have 2 copies of the rps16 in their nuclear genome. However, in some plants, Blast search results suggest that only a single copy of the rps16 is encoded in the nuclear genome. For example, we could find only a single copy of the rps16 in L. esculentum, V.vinifera, and L. japonicus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that their rps16 genes were grouped into the dual targeting rps16 genes (fig. 3). Of them, we obtained RT-PCR products of the nuclear-encoded rps16 in L. esculentum, and the ORF of this gene was fused to the upstream of the gene for GFP. We confirmed that GFP-fused RPS16 protein from L. esculentum has the dual targeting ability to the mitochondria and plastids (fig. 2B). This result strongly suggests that the gene substitution of the chloroplast rps16 is in the intermediate stage in L. esculentum because the L. esculentum chloroplast genome also contains the rps16 (CITATION), as does A. thaliana and O. sativa. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We showed that the nuclear-encoded rps16 genes were dually targeted to the mitochondria and chloroplasts in A. thaliana, L. esculentum, and O. sativa whose chloroplast genomes encode the rps16. The results suggest that the gene substitution of chloroplast rps16 is the intermediate stage in them. Our results also suggest that the chloroplast-encoded rps16 has already been silenced and has become a pseudogene by the nuclear-encoded rps16. It is reported that chloroplast-encoded rps16 has become a pseudogene in Phaseolus vulgaris because of the generation of nonsense mutation (CITATION). The chloroplast genomes of M. truncatula and P.vulgaris in legumes have already lost and silenced rps16, respectively. There is a possibility that the chloroplast-encoded rps16 has already been silenced in legumes. The complete chloroplast genome sequences of G. max (CITATION) and L. japonicus (CITATION) are available in legumes, and their chloroplast genomes encode rps16. Therefore, to confirm whether or not the chloroplast-encoded rps16 is active, we conducted RT-PCR experiment in 4 plants: G. max, L. esculentum, L. japonicus, and O. sativa. In A. thaliana, the expression analysis for genes containing intron on chloroplast genome was thoroughly performed by CITATION, and they revealed that the chloroplast-encoded rps16 is transcribed and spliced (CITATION). In the results of RT-PCR, spliced mRNAs of the chloroplast-encoded rps16 genes were detected and we confirmed that spliced transcript actually encoded the chloroplast-encoded rps16 by sequencing (fig. 4B). This result strongly suggests that the gene substitution of the chloroplast rps16 is the intermediate stage in A. thaliana, G. max, L. esculentum, L. japonicus, and O. sativa. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] It was revealed that RPS16 proteins are located to the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Generally, transferred genes from an organelle to the nucleus must obtain a sequence in the upstream of mature protein targeting the gene product to the organelle (CITATION). However, in comparison of RPS16 proteins in angiosperms to RPS16 protein in E. coli, no N-terminal extension sequence is found in higher plants such as angiosperms (fig. 1). This suggests that mitochondrial rps16 genes have acquired targeting information within their mature proteins. To determine the location of the mitochondrial and chloroplast-targeting signals, we prepared deleted constructs of A. thaliana rps16-2. Sequences corresponding to the N-terminal 30, 50, 80, 85, and 90 amino acids of the A. thaliana rps16-2 were fused to the gene for GFP. GFP-fused proteins of the sequence encoding the N-terminal 30 amino acids of A. thaliana RPS16-2 showed ambiguous localization in the cell (data not shown). On the other hand, the other GFP-fused proteins showed specific localization patterns in the cell. In the case of the N-terminal 50 amino acids, the GFP-fused protein could be located in the mitochondria and slightly in the plastids (fig. 2C). The GFP fused to the N-terminal 80 and 85 amino acids also showed a similar localization pattern to that of the N-terminal 50 amino acids. The GFP-fused protein of the N-terminal 90 amino acids was able to localize in the mitochondria and plastids because similar localization patterns were found in all ORF-fused proteins (fig. 2C). Our results strongly suggest that important amino acids for mitochondrial and chloroplast-targeting signals are contained within the N-terminal 50 and 90 amino acids, respectively.
!~MM~! A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. cultivar Columbia, O. sativa L. variant Nipponbare, M. truncatula cv. Jemalong, L. esculentum cv. Micro-Tom, and P. alba were used as plant material. A. thaliana and L. esculentum were grown in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a long-day photoperiod (18:6 h light:dark cycle). O. sativa plants were grown in a growth chamber at 28 °C in the dark. M. truncatula was grown in a greenhouse at about 25 °C. Populus alba was grown in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a long-day photoperiod (16:8 h light:dark cycle). A. thaliana cell suspensions (Alex provided by Prof. M. Umeda [Nara Institute of Science and Technology]) were maintained as described by CITATION. Total RNA was isolated from the green leaves of A. thaliana, Glycine max, L. esculentum, Lotus japonicus, M. truncatula, O. sativa, and P. alba using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Isolated RNA was further purified by incubation with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of purified RNA, 0.5 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, and 20 pmol of random hexamer primer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resultant cDNAs were used as templates to amplify the following constructs. The primer pairs for the amplification of each gene are as follows: A. thaliana rps16-1 (At4g34620) cDNA, P1 and P2 primers; A. thaliana rps16-2 (At5g56940) cDNA, P3 and P4 primers; L. esculentum rps16 cDNA, P5 and P6 primers; M. truncatula rps16-1 cDNA, P7 and P8 primers; M. truncatula rps16-2 cDNA, P9 and P10 primers; P. alba rps16-1 cDNA, P11 and P12 primers; and P. alba rps16-2 cDNA, P13 and P14 primers. These primers are designed from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. GenBank accession numbers are: M. truncatula rps16-1, DW017996; M. truncatula rps16-2, AC138526; L. esculentum, BG124842; P. alba rps16-1, AJ779938; and P. alba rps16-2, AJ773205. To confirm the expression of the chloroplast-encoded rps16 genes in each plant, reverse transcribed–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using following primers: G. max, P15 and P16 primers; L. esculentum, P15 and P17 primers; L. japonicus, P18 and P19 primers; and O. sativa, P20 and P21 primers. These primers amplified the spliced rps16 mRNA in each plant (see Fig. 4A). cDNA was denatured at 94 °C for 2 min and amplified with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. Primer sequence data of P1–P21 are described in supplementary table 1 (Supplementary Material online). RT-PCR was conducted using KOD Plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and their products were subsequently cloned into the pGEM T-easy Vector systems (Promega, Madison WI) after an adenosine addition according to the manufacturer's instructions. Independent clones were sequenced using universal primers or randomly designed primers. The fragments for green fluorescent protein (GFP)–fused proteins in this study were amplified by each RT-PCR product or full-length cDNA of rice as templates with the following primers: A. thaliana rps16-1, P22 and P23 primers; A. thaliana rps16-2, P24 and P25 primers; O. sativa rps16-1 (Os09g0498100), P26 and P27 primers; O. sativa rps16-2 (Os08g0517900), P28 and P29 primers; L. esculentum rps16, P30 and P31 primers; M. truncatula rps16-1, P32 and P33 primers; M. truncatula rps16-2, P34 and P35 primers; P. alba rps16-1, P36 and P37 primers; and P. alba rps16-2, P38 and P39 primers. In the case of the constructions for N-terminal 50 and 90 amino acids in A. thaliana rps16-2, P40 and P41 primers were used with P24, respectively. After digestion by each restriction enzyme, all polymerase chain reaction products were cloned in-frame upstream of the gfp coding sequence. This was regulated by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and a 3′ nopaline synthase transcription terminator (CITATION). The nucleotide sequence of the resultant plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each resulting product was amplified using P42 and P43 primers and cloned into a pENTR/DTOPO vector (Invitrogen). Furthermore, to be cloned into the pHGW binary vector, an in vitro reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, using LR clonase (Invitrogen). Primer sequence data of P23–P43 are described in supplementary table 2 (Supplementary Material online). Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed by the pHGW binary vector (spectinomycin resistance) harboring gfp-fused rps16 genes and pGWB8 binary vector (kanamycin resistance) harboring chloroplast-targeted red fluorescent protein (RFP) infected into A. thaliana suspension cells (Alex) was prepared according to Mathur et al. (1998). Five days after infection, the fluorescence of GFP and RFP was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope, as described by CITATION. Mitochondria were stained by MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Invitrogen) according to CITATION. Mitochondria and chloroplasts in the cell were visualized as red signals by MitoTracker and RFP, respectively. We used the available plants EST database provided by the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The Blast search was conducted using TIGR Unique Gene Indices (http://tigrblast.tigr.org/tgi/). Subcellular localization of the protein was predicted by TargetP (CITATION) and Predotar (CITATION) version 0.5 (http://www.inra.fr/predotar/). Each program was conducted using default parameters. ClustalX (ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/) was used for the multiple alignment of protein sequences. A sequence matrix of 32 RPS16 proteins was obtained by multiple alignment using ClustalX version 2.01 (CITATION). Based on the resulting matrix of 203 characters, phylogenetic analysis was performed by Bayesian approach in MrBayes 3.1.2 (CITATION; CITATION) using the WAG (CITATION) model. Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling was performed with 1 cold and 3 heated chains that were run for 5,000,000 generations. Starting trees were random, trees were sampled every 100th generation, and the posterior probabilities were estimated on the 30,000 trees (burn-in = 20,000). GenBank accession numbers for the deduced amino acid sequences used in alignment and the phylogenetic analysis are as follows.
