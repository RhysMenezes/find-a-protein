!~ABS~! p24 proteins are a family of type I membrane proteins localized to compartments of the early secretory pathway and to coat protein I (COPI)- and COPII-coated vesicles. They can be classified, by sequence homology, into four subfamilies, named p24α, p24β, p24γ, and p24δ. In contrast to animals and fungi, plants contain only members of the p24β and p24δ subfamilies, the latter probably including two different subclasses. It has previously been shown that transiently expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ5 (p24δ1 subclass) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at steady state as a consequence of highly efficient COPI-based recycling from the Golgi apparatus. It is now shown that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 (p24δ2 subclass) also localizes to the ER. In contrast, transiently expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)–p24β3 mainly localizes to the Golgi apparatus (as p24β2) and exits the ER in a COPII-dependent manner. Immunogold electron microscopy in Arabidopsis root tip cells using specific antibodies shows that endogenous p24δ9 localizes mainly to the ER but also partially to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, endogenous p24β3 mainly localizes to the Golgi apparatus. By a combination of experiments using transient expression, knock-out mutants, and co-immunoprecipitation, it is proposed that Arabidopsis p24 proteins form different heteromeric complexes (including members of the β and δ subfamilies) which are important for their stability and their coupled trafficking at the ER–Golgi interface. Evidence is also provided for a role for p24δ5 in retrograde Golgi–ER transport of the KDEL-receptor ERD2.
!~RES~! The localization of endogenous p24δ5 and p24δ4 (p24δ subfamily) and p24β2 (p24β subfamily) in Arabidopsis root cells was previously shown (CITATIONet al., 2012). The localization of p24δ9, in a branch of the p24δ subfamily different from that of p24δ5 or p24δ4, and of p24β3, the second member of the p24β subfamily in Arabidopsis, has now been investigated. To this end, peptide antibodies were generated against the N-terminus of both proteins, which, in contrast to the C-terminus, shows a high variability among different p24 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). p24 proteins were extracted from membranes of Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures or from Arabidopsis roots. As shown in CITATION, antibodies against the N-terminus of p24δ9 recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight (24kDa) in both membrane extracts, while antibodies against the N-terminus of p24β3 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular weight of ~22kDa. Interestingly, p24β2 and p24β3 showed a slightly different electrophoretic mobility, which in addition was also different from that of p24δ5 and p24δ9 (CITATION). These differences in electrophoretic mobility were also obvious when the luminal N-terminal portion of both p24δ5 and p24β2 with a C-terminal (His)6-tag was expressed in bacteria (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). Bacterial extracts were used to characterize further the specificity of the antibodies. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, antibodies against the N-terminus of p24δ9 did not recognize the N-terminus of p24δ5 (in contrast to Nt-p24δ5 or His antibodies), while antibodies against the N-terminus of p24β3 did not recognize the N-terminus of p24β2 (in contrast to Nt-p24β2 or His antibodies). These antibodies were used to localize p24δ9 and p24β3 by immunogold labelling on sections cut from cryofixed Arabidopsis roots. As shown in CITATION, the N-terminal p24δ9 antibody mainly labelled ER membranes, as was found previously for endogenous p24δ5 and p24δ4 (CITATIONet al., 2012). Occasionally, some labelling was also seen on the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the N-terminal p24β3 antibody mainly labelled the Golgi apparatus, although some labelling could also be seen at ER membranes (CITATION). This localization is very similar to that previously shown for endogenous p24β2 (CITATIONet al., 2012). Characterization of antibodies against Arabidopsis p24 proteins. Protein extracts were obtained from membranes of Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures (C) or Arabidopsis roots (R), as described in the Materials and methods, and analysed by SDS–PAGE (14% acrylamide) and western blotting with antibodies against the p24δ9 N-terminus and p24β3 N-terminus, or with the corresponding pre-immune sera. Western blotting with antibodies against p24δ5 and p24β2 (CITATIONet al., 2012) is also shown. Note the slightly different electrophoretic mobility of p24δ5/p24δ9, p24β2, and p24β3. Localization of p24δ9 and p24β3 by immunogold labelling on cryofixed Arabidopsis roots. (A) Labelling with antibodies against Nt-p24δ9 at the ER. (B) Labelling with antibodies against Nt-p24β3 at the Golgi apparatus and the ER. Arrowheads point to gold particles. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; G, Golgi apparatus; MVB, multivesicular body. It was previously demonstrated that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ5 localizes to the ER at steady state but cycles between the ER and Golgi (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012). Arabidopsis p24 proteins of the delta subfamily have been suggested to belong to two different subclasses, p24δ1 and p24δ2, with different localization and trafficking properties (CITATION). In particular, members of the p24δ1 subclass (which comprise p24δ3–p24δ6) localized exclusively to the ER, while members of the p24δ2 subclass (which comprisee p24δ7–p24δ11) localized to both the ER and Golgi when transiently expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells (CITATION). Therefore, the trafficking properties of RFP–p24δ5 (p24δ1 subclass) and RFP–p24δ9 (p24δ2 subclass) were compared. In marked contrast to the data of CITATION, it was found that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 localizes exclusively to the ER, both in tobacco protoplasts (CITATION–CITATION; Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online) and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells (CITATION–CITATION). In both cases, RFP–p24δ9 co-localized extensively with the ER markers GFP/YFP–HDEL but not with the Golgi markers ManI–GFP/YFP. At low expression levels, it showed a pattern nearly indistinguishable from that of RFP–p24δ5. At higher expression levels, it partially localized to dots, or even to ring-like structures, probably artefacts of overexpression. However, none of these structures was found to co-localize with the Golgi markers ManI–GFP/YFP (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 seems to localize exclusively to the ER, like RFP–p24δ5 (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012). Localization of RFP–p24δ9. (A–I) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) RFP–p24δ9 (A) co-localizes extensively with the ER marker GFP–HDEL (B) (merged image in C). (D–F) RFP–p24δ9 (D) does not co-localize with the Golgi marker Man1–GFP (E) (merged image in F). (G–I) RFP–p24δ9 (G) does not co-localize with the Golgi marker Man1–GFP (H) upon ARF1 (Q71L) expression (merged image in I). (J–O) Transient gene expression in tobacco leaf epidermal cells. (J–L) RFP–p24δ9 (J) co-localizes extensively with the ER marker YFP–HDEL (K) (merged image in L). (M–O) RFP–p24δ9 (M) does not co-localize with the Golgi marker Man1–YFP (N) (merged image in O). Scale bars=5 μm. In order to investigate if transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 also cycles between the ER and Golgi, as does RFP–p24δ5, RFP–p24δ9 was co-expressed with the GTP-restricted ARF1(Q71L) mutant, which prevents COPI-mediated Golgi–ER recycling (CITATIONet al., 2003). This treatment has been shown to redistribute RFP–p24δ5 partially to the Golgi apparatus (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012). Interestingly, this treatment did not change the ER localization of RFP–p24δ9 (CITATION–CITATION). The trafficking properties of (X)FP–p24β3 were also investigated. Similar to GFP–p24β2, YFP–p24β3 showed a punctate pattern, which partially co-localized with the Golgi markers ERD2–CFP (CITATION–CITATION) or ManI–RFP (CITATION–CITATION). When co-expressed with the GDP-restricted ARF1(T31N) mutant, which causes relocalization of Golgi markers to the ER (CITATIONet al., 2002), YFP–p24β3 completely redistributed to the ER, where it co-localized with both ERD2–CFP (CITATION-CITATION) and Man I–RFP (CITATION–CITATION). This was also the case for YFP–p24β2 (Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). These data suggest that transiently expressed p24β2 and p24β3 mainly localize to the Golgi apparatus, as had been observed for the endogenous proteins. When GFP–p24β2 or YFP–p24β3 was co-expressed with Sec12, to inhibit COPII-dependent ER export, both proteins were mainly localized to the ER, together with the Golgi marker Man I–RFP (CITATION–CITATION). This suggests that both proteins exit the ER in a COPII-dependent manner. In contrast to GFP–p24β2, co-expression of YFP–p24β3 and Sec12 not only led to a complete reticular pattern, but some dots were also very obvious (CITATION–CITATION). To test for the identity of these dots, YFP–p24β3 and Sec12 were co-expressed with 6kDa VP–CFP, a COPII/ERES marker (CITATIONet al., 2011). As shown in CITATION–CITATION, many of the YFP–p24β3 punctae co-localized with 6kDa VP–CFP, suggesting that at least a fraction of YFP–p24β3 may accumulate at ERES under these conditions. Localization of YFP–p24β3. (A–L) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) YFP–p24β3 (B) co-localizes with the Golgi marker ERD2–CFP (A) in punctate structures (merged image in C).

(A–C) GFP–p24β2 (A) co-localizes with ManI–RFP (B) in the ER upon Sec12 overexpression (merged image in C). (D–F) YFP–p24β3 (D) co-localizes with ManI–RFP (E) in the ER upon Sec12 overexpression, but also in punctate structures (merged image in F). (G–I) YFP–p24β3 (H) co-localizes partially with the COPII/ERES marker 6kDa VP–CFP (G) in punctate structures upon Sec12 overexpression (merged image in I). Scale bars=5 μm. As had been observed with GFP–p24β2 (CITATIONet al., 2012), the signal obtained for YFP–p24β3 in the CLSM when expressed alone was relatively low. When the levels of GFP–p24β3 were analysed by western blotting, a relatively low signal was also detected (CITATION, lane 2). The stability of p24 proteins depends on their interactions with other family members (CITATIONet al., 2012). Therefore, transiently expressed individual proteins may be more susceptible to protein degradation. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the degradation of p24β2 and p24β3, both proteins were expressed in the presence of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, or E-64, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases. Western blot analysis shows that the levels of both p24β2 and p24β3 significantly increased in the presence of E-64 (CITATION, lane 4), but not in the presence of MG-132 (CITATION, lane 3), suggesting that both proteins are mainly degraded by cysteine proteinases in acidic compartments. Stability of p24 proteins of the beta subfamily. Tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were electroporated in the absence (–DNA) or the presence of 30 μg of plasmid DNAs corresponding to GFP–p24β2 (upper panel) or GFP–p24β3 (middle panel), in the absence (Control) or the presence of MG-132 or E-64. At 24h post-electroporation, protoplasts were washed and homogenized to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant, which was then centrifuged to obtain a total membrane fraction. Membranes were extracted in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide) and western blot analysis with antibodies against Ct-p24β2 or GFP (to detect p24β3). A 30 μg aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts. Western blotting with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control (lower panel). p24 proteins are thought to form hetero-oligomeric complexes, via their coiled-coil domains, which are essential for their trafficking and localization. It has been previously shown that p24δ5 and p24β2 interact with each other, probably at ERES, for their coupled transport to the Golgi apparatus (CITATIONet al., 2012). This analysis has now been extended to other members of the p24δ and p24β subfamilies. As shown in CITATION–CITATION, when GFP–p24β2 was co-expressed with RFP–p24δ9, the signal of GFP–p24β2 was clearly more intense than when expressed alone, but still localized to punctae. In addition, it was observed that RFP–p24δ9 showed its typical ER pattern but also localized to the same punctae under these conditions (see also CITATION). The punctae where both proteins co-localize overlapped extensively with the Golgi marker ERD2–YFP (CITATION–CITATION), but also with the COPII/ERES marker 6kDa VP–CFP (CITATION–CITATION). This suggests that GFP–p24β2 is able to enhance the ER exit of RFP–p24δ9 and its transport to the Golgi apparatus, as happens with RFP–p24δ5 (CITATIONet al., 2012). This was also the case when GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ9 were transiently co-expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells: while RFP–p24δ9 localized exclusively to the ER when expressed individually (CITATION–CITATION), it also localized to punctae when co-expressed with CFP–p24β2. Under these conditions, the punctae containing CFP–p24β2 showed an almost complete co-localization with RFP–p24δ9 (Supplementary Fig. S5 at JXB online). Whether GFP–p24β3 showed the same trafficking characteristics as GFP–p24β2 was next investigated in co-expression experiments. As shown in CITATION–CITATION, GFP–p24β3 punctae showed only a partial co-localization with either RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9 (see also CITATION). Strikingly, GFP–p24β3 did not significantly change the ER localization of RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9, in contrast to GFP–p24β2 (CITATION–CITATION). Co-localization of RFP–p24δ5/δ9 and GFP–p24β2/β3 in co-expression experiments In A, measurements were made on 10 separate cells upon double co-expression (CITATION), and calculated with ImageJ 1.47i and the plugins JACoP (Bolte S, Cordelieres FP 2006) and PSC Colocalization (CITATIONet al., 2008). In B, measurements were made on 5–10 separate cells upon quadruple co-expression (CITATION–CITATION), out of four independent experiments, and calculated with ImageJ 1.47i and the plugin ColocalizeRGB.

(A–C) GFP–p24β2 (A) co-localizes extensively with RFP–p24δ9 (B) in punctate structures (merged image in C).

(A–P) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–H) CFP–p24β2 (A, E) and RFP–p24δ9 (C, G) co-localize with the Golgi marker ERD2–YFP (B, F) in punctate structures (merged images in D and H). (I–P) YFP–p24β2 (J, N) and RFP–p24δ9 (K, O) co-localize with the ERES/COPII marker 6kDa VP–CFP (I, M) in punctate structures (merged images in L and P). Scale bars=5 μm. Triple or quadruple co-expression experiments were performed next. First, the two p24β proteins (CFP–p24β2 and YFP–p24β3) were co-expressed with either RFP–p24δ5 (CITATION–CITATION) or RFP–p24δ9 (CITATION–CITATION) (triple co-expression). In both cases, there was a partial co-localization of the three proteins in punctate structures. When CFP–p24β2, YFP–p24β3, RFP–p24δ5, and RFP–p24δ9 were expressed together (quadruple co-expression) (CITATION–CITATION), various degrees of co-localization between these proteins were obtained (see CITATION). However, the most striking observation was that CFP–p24β2 remained mostly punctate, while in most of the protoplasts YFP–p24β3 was clearly less punctate and much more reticular. Under these conditions, RFP fluorescence (including both RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ9) was mostly reticular (CITATION–CITATION). Finally, the two p24δ proteins (RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ9) were co-expressed with either GFP–p24β2 or GFP–p24β3. Under these conditions, GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ5/9 extensively co-localized in punctate structures (CITATION–CITATION). In contrast, GFP–p24β3 was only partially punctate and significantly redistributed to the ER, where it partially co-localized with RFP–p24δ5/9 (CITATION–CITATION).

Co-expression of p24 proteins of the beta and delta subfamilies (III). (A–L) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–F) GFP–p24β2 (A, D) and RFP–p24δ5/δ9 (B, E) co-localize extensively in punctate structures (merged images in C and F). (G–L) GFP–p24β3 (G, J) relocalizes partially to the ER, where it co-localizes with RFP–p24δ5/δ9 (H, K) (merged images in I and L). Scale bars=5 μm. To quantify whether the levels of GFP–p24β proteins might depend on their trafficking properties, protoplasts were analysed by western blotting following the co-expression experiments shown above (CITATION). Since the N-terminal p24β3 antibodies could not detect transiently expressed GFP–p24β3 by western blotting, GFP antibodies, which recognized both GFP–p24β2 and GFP–p24β3, were used instead. The results are summarized in CITATION. As has been shown previously (CITATIONet al., 2012), the levels of GFP–p24β2 increased significantly upon co-expression with RFP–p24δ5. It has now been found that the levels of GFP–p24β2 also increased significantly when co-expressed with RFP–p24δ9. On the other hand, the levels of GFP–p24β2 or GFP–p24β3 were not significantly increased when both proteins were expressed together. In the case of GFP–p24β3, its levels increased upon co-expression with RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9, but increased much more in the quadruple co-expression. Levels of p24β2 and p24β3 in co-expression experiments Quantification of western blots from two different co-expression experiments like the one shown in CITATION, using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The amount of p24β3 was calculated as the difference between the intensity of GFP (which includes the signal of both GFP–p24β2 and GFP–p24β3) and that of p24β2. Western blots in the linear range of detection that showed comparable intensities for p24β2 and GFP in the co-expression of p24β2+p24δ5 and p24β2+p24δ9 were selected. Biochemical analysis of co-expression experiments. Tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were electroporated in the absence (–DNA) or the presence of 25 μg of the indicated plasmid DNAs. At 24h post-electroporation, protoplasts were washed and homogenized to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant, which was then centrifuged to obtain a total membrane fraction. Membranes were extracted in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide) and western blot analysis with antibodies against RFP (to detect RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ9), the p24β2 C-terminus, or GFP (to quantify the amount of both GFP–p24β2 and GFP–p24β3). A 30 μg aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts. Western blot with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control. Previous studies where a single member of the p24 family had been deleted or knocked down showed that the protein level of other family members was reduced, which probably reflects the fact that these p24 proteins interact with each other in hetero-oligomeric complexes (CITATION; CITATIONet al., 1999; CITATIONet al., 2000; CITATIONet al., 2007; CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2010; CITATIONet al., 2010; CITATION). Therefore, the protein levels of p24δ4, p24δ5, p24δ9, p24β2, or p24β3 were examined in knock-out/knock-down mutants. T-DNA insertion knock-out mutants lacking p24δ5 (p24δ5-1) and p24δ4 (p24δ4-1) had already been characterized (CITATIONet al., 2012). As no T-DNA insertion knock-out mutant for p24δ9 (δ2 subclass) was found in the Salk collection, a knock-out mutant for p24δ10 (δ2 subclass) was analysed (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). Plants from the three lines resembled wild-type plants under standard growth conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6). As T-DNA insertion mutants for p24β2 or p24β3 are not available in mutant collections, amiRNA was used to knock down p24β2 or p24β3 (Supplementary Fig. S6). No distinct phenotype was observed in amiR-p24β2 or amiR-p24β3 knock-down lines when compared with wild-type plants under standard growth conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6). Protein extracts from roots of wild-type (Col-0) plants, T-DNA knock-out insertion mutants, and amiR-p24β2 and amiR-p24β3 lines were analysed by western blotting with the corresponding antibodies (CITATION). It was previously shown that the T-DNA mutant lacking p24δ5 showed p24δ4 levels comparable with those of the wild type. The same was true for the levels of p24δ5 in the p24δ4 mutant (CITATIONet al., 2012). However, both mutants (p24δ4-1 and p24δ5-1) showed reduced levels of p24δ9, p24β2, and p24β3 (CITATION). In contrast, the T-DNA mutant lacking p24δ10 did not show reduced protein levels of p24δ5, p24β2, or p24β3, but showed a 2.5-fold increase in the protein levels of the highly related p24δ9 (CITATION). Finally, the lines expressing amiRNAs were analysed for p24β2 or p24β3. Expression of p24β2 and p24β3 was reduced by ~85% in the amiR-p24β2 and amiR-p24β3 lines, respectively (CITATION). In addition, the amiR-p24β2 line showed reduced protein levels of p24δ5, p24δ9, and p24β3, while the amiR-p24β3 line showed reduced protein levels of p24δ5, p24δ9, and p24β2 (CITATION). These results suggest that p24 proteins do interact with other family members to form heteromeric complexes. Levels of p24 proteins in knock-out (KO) mutants or amiRNA lines. Western blot analysis with antibodies against the N-terminus of p24δ5, p24δ9, or p24β3, or the C-terminus of p24β2 in membranes from the wild type (Col-0) or the indicated KO mutants or amiRNA lines (see text for details). The expected positions for p24δ5/δ9, p24β3, and p24β2 (according to the western blot analysis shown in CITATION) are shown by arrowheads. Molecular weight markers are indicated on the left. A 25 μg aliquot of protein was loaded in each lane. Western blotting with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control. Lower panel shows a quantification of the levels of each of the proteins in each mutant calculated as a percentage of the levels present in wild-type (Col-0) membranes (mean±SD from three independent experiments). To test biochemically for interactions between endogenous p24 proteins, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using C-terminal p24δ5 or p24β2 antibodies (CITATIONet al., 2012). As shown in CITATION, antibodies against the C-terminus of p24β2 caused the co-immunoprecipitation of p24δ5, p24δ9, and p24β3, while antibodies against the C-terminus of p24δ5 caused the co-immunoprecipitation of p24δ9, p24β2, and p24β3. As a control, control beads or N-terminal p24β2 antibodies, which have previously beeen shown to be unable to immunoprecipitate p24β2 (CITATIONet al., 2012), were used. Pull-down experiments were also performed using membrane fractions from protoplasts co-expressing RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9 and GFP–p24β2 or GFP–p24β3, using an RFP-trap for the pull-down of RFP-tagged proteins (p24δ5 or p24δ9) and GFP antibodies for the western blot analysis of the interacting proteins (p24β2 or p24β3). As shown in CITATION, RFP–p24δ5 pulled-down GFP–p24β2 and, to a lesser extent, GFP–p24β3, but not ManI–GFP (used as a negative control). Similarly, RFP–p24δ9 pulled-down both GFP–p24β2 and GFP–p24β3 (CITATION). This suggests that heterotypic interactions can occur between Arabidopsis p24 proteins from the beta and delta subfamilies. Interactions between p24 proteins. (A) Co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous p24 proteins was performed using affinity-purified antibodies against the C-terminus of p24β2 (IP anti-p24β2-Ct) or p24δ5 (IP anti-p24δ5-Ct). As a control, control beads (IP Control) or antibodies against the N-terminus of p24β2 (IP anti-p24β2-Nt) were used. Immunoprecipitates were analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blot with antibodies against the N-terminus of p24δ5, p24δ9, and p24β3, or the C-terminus of p24β2. Extract lane contains 20 μg of the membrane proteins used as input for the immunoprecipitation. The expected positions for p24δ5/δ9, p24β3, and p24β2 (according to the western blot analysis shown in CITATION) are shown by arrowheads. Molecular weight markers are indicated on the left. (B) Pull-down assays of RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9 from membranes of protoplasts co-expressing the indicated proteins using an RFP-trap (see text). As a control, pull-downs were performed from membranes of untransfected protoplasts (–DNA) or protoplasts co-expressing RFP–p24δ5 and ManI–GFP. Bound proteins were analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting with antibodies against RFP (to detect RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9) or GFP (to detect GFP–p24β2, GFP–p24β3, or ManI–GFP). In the case of protoplasts co-expressing RFP–p24δ5 and ManI–GFP, no RFP signal was detected in the 90kDa region (expected position for ManI–GFP) and no GFP signal was detected in the 50kDa region (expected position for RFP–p24δ5) (data not shown). I, input (5% of the membrane extracts used for the pull-down assay); U, unspecific binding (proteins bound to control blocked magnetic particles); P, pull-down. Finally, a functional analysis of p24 proteins in Arabidopsis was attempted. Since the single knock-down/knock-out mutants that were characterized did not show any obvious phenotypic alteration, a gain-of-function approach was tried, by overexpressing specific p24 proteins and testing for an influence on the trafficking of putative cargos. For these studies, the focus was on p24δ5, since its trafficking was previously characterized in the early secretory pathway and mutants were readily available (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012). However, the drawback of this strategy is the fact that specific p24 cargos have not yet been identified in plants. Since p24 proteins of the delta subfamily have been proposed to play a role in retrograde Golgi–ER transport (CITATIONet al., 1998, CITATION; CITATIONet al., 2008), it was thought that one good candidate might be ERD2, a receptor which retrieves KDEL/HDEL-containing cargo from the Golgi to the ER. Indeed, there is one previous report showing that mammalian p23 (p24δ subfamily) interacts with ERD2 and is involved in its retrograde Golgi–ER transport (CITATIONet al., 1998, CITATION). Therefore, ERD2–YFP was transiently co-expressed with increasing amounts of RFP–p24δ5. When expressed alone, ERD2–YFP localized mainly (76% of analysed protoplasts) to punctate Golgi structures, with a faint ER staining (CITATION–CITATION). Overexpression of RFP–p24δ5 produced a significant redistribution of ERD2–YFP from the Golgi to the ER. As quantified in CITATION, Golgi localization of ERD2–YFP decreased to 38% in the presence of RFP–p24δ5. In the remaining protoplasts, ERD2–YFP localized either to the ER (17% of the protoplasts) or to both the ER and Golgi (45% of the protoplasts) (CITATION–CITATION). These experiments suggest that p24δ5 may play a role in retrograde Golgi–ER transport of ERD2. This was not a general effect on Golgi proteins, since the standard Golgi marker ManI–GFP was still Golgi localized under the same conditions (CITATION–CITATION). Interestingly, this effect was not observed when we used an RFP–p24δ5 mutant lacking the KK motif at the C-terminus, which is necessary for interaction with the COPI coat and therefore for retrograde Golgi–ER transport of p24δ5 (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012). Under these conditions, RFP–p24δ5(ΔKK) and ERD2–YFP extensively co-localized in punctate structures (CITATION–CITATION), which, based on previous results with this mutant, should correspond either to the Golgi or to the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012). In addition, RFP–p24δ5(ΔKK) (but not ERD2–YFP) was also localized to the vacuole, as has been shown previously (CITATIONet al., 2008). RFP–p24δ5 [but not RFP–p24δ5(ΔKK)] partially relocalizes ERD2–YFP to the ER. (A–J) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) RFP–p24δ5 (B) caused a partial relocalization of ERD2–YFP (A) to the ER, although ERD2–YFP also showed a punctate localization (ER and Golgi localization) (merged image in C). (D–F) ERD2–YFP (D) and RFP–p24δ5(ΔKK) (E) (which also shows vacuolar localization) almost completely co-localized in punctate structures (merged image in F). (G–I) RFP–p24δ5 (H) did not significantly change the localization of ManI–GFP (G) (merged image in I). (J) ERD2–YFP showed mostly a Golgi localization when expressed alone. (K) Quantification of the localization of ERD2–YFP expressed alone (Control) or in the presence of RFP–p24δ5. Eighty protoplasts (from four independent experiments), showing comparable expression levels of ERD2–YFP, ManI–GFP, and RFP–p24δ5, were analysed per condition, using identical laser output levels and imaging conditions. The localization of ERD2–YFP was assigned as Golgi (punctae), ER and Golgi, or ER, and calculated as a percentage. Error bars represent the SEM. Images in the panels show the most representative pattern found for each condition. Scale bars=5 μm.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and T-DNA mutant plants were grown in growth chambers as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2007). For immunogold electron microscopy, seedlings were grown on MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium containing 0.5% agar, and the roots were harvested after 5 d. To obtain a membrane fraction from Arabidopsis roots, seedlings were grown in liquid MS medium for 15 d. Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures (LT87) (CITATIONet al., 1992) were cultivated as described (CITATIONet al., 2006). Plants of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana were grown from surface-sterilized seeds on MS medium with 2% (w/w) sucrose in a controlled room at 25 °C with cycles of 16h light and 8h darkness. Wild-type Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown from surface-sterilized seeds on soil in a controlled room at 22 °C with a 16h daylength. The coding sequences of red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ9, cyan fluorescent protein/green fluorescent protein (CFP/GFP)–p24β2, or GFP/yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–p24β3 were synthesized commercially de novo (Geneart AG), based on the sequences of GFP/CFP/YFP/RFP and that of the Arabidopsis p24 proteins At1g26690 (p24δ9), At3g07680 (p24β2), and At3g22845 (p24β3). All RFP-tagged proteins were tagged with monomeric RFP (mRFP) to prevent oligomerization. Similarly, only mGFP5 was used for GFP-tagged proteins. The sequence of the fluorophore was always located behind the coding sequence of the p24 signal sequence and the 5ʹ extreme end of the mature p24 coding sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). The coding sequences of RFP–p24δ9 or XFP–p24β2/β3 were cloned into the pBP30 vector (carrying the 35S promoter; CITATIONet al., 1999) through BglII/NotI. Mesophyll protoplasts from N. tabacum var. SR1 leaf cells were isolated and transfected as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2008). Unless otherwise stated, 1–50 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected and expressed for 20h. Protoplasts from A. thaliana (LT87) cell suspension cultures were isolated as previously described (CITATIONet al., 1992). Where indicated, inhibitors (50 μM E-64, 100 μM MG-132) were added to the protoplast medium 30min after electroporation, before the 20h overnight incubation to allow for expression of the different constructs. Transient expression mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens was performed in 4- to 6-week-old tobacco plants (wild type, N. benthamiana) as described previously (CITATIONet al., 2011). Plasmids encoding marker proteins were: GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ5 (CITATIONet al., 2008; CITATIONet al., 2012), Man1–RFP and Man1–GFP (CITATIONet al., 1999), GFP–HDEL (CITATIONet al., 2000), ERD2–CFP/YFP (CITATIONet al., 2002), 6kDa VP–CFP (CITATION), Sec12 (CITATIONet al., 2003), ARF1(T31N) (Lee et al., 2003), and ARF1(Q71L) (CITATIONet al., 2003). Rabbit antibodies were generated by Eurogentec (Belgium, http://www.eurogentec.com) using as antigens peptides corresponding to the N-terminus of p24δ9 (LHFELQSGRT) or p24β3 (LSVTVNDEE). Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microsope (CLSM). At the Metadetector, the main beam splitters (HFT) 458/514 and 488/543 were used. The following fluorophores (excited and emitted by frame switching in the multitracking mode) were used: GFP (488nm/496–518nm), CFP (458nm/464–486nm), YFP (514nm/529–550nm), and RFP (543nm/593–636nm). Post-acquisition image processing was performed using the Zeiss LSM 5 image Browser (4.2.0.121) and CorelDrawX4 (14.0.0.567) or ImageJ (v.1.45m). Root tips from Arabidopsis were high pressure frozen, freeze substituted, embedded, labelled, and post-stained as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2008). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: Nt-p24β3 (1:100) and Nt-p24δ9 (1:100). Micrographs were taken with a JEM1400 transmission elctron microscope operating at 80kV using a TVIPS F214 digital camera. Membrane fractions were obtained from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures (LT87), Arabidopsis roots, or tobacco protoplasts as described previously (CITATIONet al., 2012). Protein extracts were used for SDS–PAGE followed by western blot analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, or pull-down experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from Arabidopsis cultures were performed using magnetic beads (Dynal, Invitrogen), as described previously (CITATIONet al., 2012). Pull-down experiments from tobacco protoplasts expressing RFP-tagged proteins were performed using RFP-Trap magnetic beads (Chromotek), following the recommendations of the manufacturer. For western blot analysis, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk/0.1 % Tween-20, incubated for 1h at room temperature with the primary antibodies, washed, and incubated with peroxidase-labelled sheep anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 1h at room temperature. After washing, the immune complexes were detected by the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminiscent Substrate (Pierce, Thermo Scientific). The intensity of the bands obtained after western blot was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Western blot with an antibody against the plasma membrane ATPase (CITATIONet al., 2012) was used as a loading control. Antibodies against RFP and GFP were obtained from Clontech and Life Technologies, respectively. A line (Columbia, background) containing a T-DNA insertion in p24δ10 (SALK_144586C, p24δ10–1) was identified from the SALK T-DNA collection (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress). It was characterized by PCR as previously described (CITATIONet al., 2007). The primers used for this mutant were the following: 5ʹ-CCGGTAACAATTACCATCACG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-ACGAAGTACCC AAGGTTCCAC-3ʹ. The T-DNA left border and Actin7 (ACT7, At5g09810) primers used were described previously (CITATIONet al., 2007). Reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) analysis of the p24δ10–1 mutant was performed as described (CITATIONet al., 2007) to show the absence of p24δ10, and the primers used were 5ʹ-CAAAGTGTATCGCCGAAGACATC-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GCATCC CTGCAACTCCTATGCAGA-3ʹ. p24δ 4–1, p24δ 5–1, and p24δ4δ5 mutant lines have been described previously (CITATIONet al., 2012). Due to the lack of p24β2 and p24β3 knock-out T-DNA insertion mutants in mutant collections, artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) were used to knock down the expression of the genes. The β2-directed amiRNA construct was designed using a Web-based program (http://wmd2.weigelworld.org) (CITATIONet al., 2006; CITATIONet al., 2008). The pRS300 plasmid was used as a template to create the amiRNA (CITATIONet al., 2008). Primer sequences were the following: I, 5ʹ-ATAATCAGTGCA AACGACGCGATCTCTCTTTTGTATTCC-3ʹ; II, 5ʹ-GATCGCG TCGTTTGCACTGATTATCAAAGAGAATC AATGA-3ʹ; III, 5ʹ-GATCACGTCGTTTGCTCTGATTTTCACAG GTCGTGATATG-3ʹ; and IV, 5ʹ-GAAAATCAGAGCAA-ACGAC GTGATCTACATATATATTCCT-3ʹ. The final amiRNA PCR product was digested at the KpnI and BamHI sites flanking the sequence encoding the amiRNA hairpin. The resultant product was ligated into the pCHF3 vector (CITATIONet al, 2007) using the KpnI and BamHI sites. The β3-directed amiRNA construct was purchased from Open Biosystems (AMR4844-99730584). Transformation of Arabidopsis was conducted according to the floral dip method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on half-strength MS medium containing appropriate antibiotics. Transgenic lines segregating 3:1 for antibiotic resistance were selected in the T2 generation of each transformation, and the T3 homozygous generation was used to characterize silencing by RT–PCR as above. Primer sequences for p24β2 were 5ʹ-AGGGTACGATCGTATTACTAG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GACACGAGACA TGCCGAGTTTGCG-3ʹ and for p24β3 were 5ʹ-CGACAAGCGAA GATCCATG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GACACAAGACCTCGCTCTGAGG-3ʹ. For further studies, the homozygous lines amiR-p24β2 and amiR-p24β3 that showed the best silencing for p24β2 and p24β3, respectively, were selected (Supplementary Fig. S6 at JXB online). RT–PCR analysis showed no silencing of p24β3 in the amiR-p24β2 line, while 20% p24β2 silencing was detected in the amiR-p24β3 line obtained from the amiRNA construct purchased from Open Biosystems (data not shown).
