!~ABS~! In land plants polar auxin transport is one of the substantial processes guiding whole plant polarity and morphogenesis. Directional auxin fluxes are mediated by PIN auxin efflux carriers, polarly localized at the plasma membrane. The polarization of exocytosis in yeast and animals is assisted by the exocyst: an octameric vesicle-tethering complex and an effector of Rab and Rho GTPases. Here we show that rootward polar auxin transport is compromised in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana loss-of-function mutants in the EXO70A1 exocyst subunit. The recycling of PIN1 and PIN2 proteins from brefeldin–A compartments is delayed after the brefeldin-A washout in exo70A1 and sec8 exocyst mutants. Relocalization of PIN1 and PIN2 proteins after prolonged brefeldin-A treatment is largely impaired in these mutants. At the same time, however, plasma membrane localization of GFP:EXO70A1, and the other exocyst subunits studied (GFP:SEC8 and YFP:SEC10), is resistant to brefeldin-A treatment. In root cells of the exo70A1 mutant, a portion of PIN2 is internalized and retained in specific, abnormally enlarged, endomembrane compartments that are distinct from VHA-a1-labelled early endosomes or the trans-Golgi network, but are RAB-A5d positive. We conclude that the exocyst is involved in PIN1 and PIN2 recycling, and thus in polar auxin transport regulation.
!~RES~! We previously described symptoms of the A. thaliana exo70A1 mutant pointing to possible changes in auxin homeostasis or signalling (Synek et al., CITATION). Further analysis revealed new deviations supporting such a notion. We observed a loss of root waving and a skewing to the opposite side, compared with the wild type (WT), in plants cultivated on agar plates inclined at 50° (Figure 1a). Also, distinctly larger root caps caused by accumulation of border-like cell layers were obvious in 7-day-old exo70A1 seedlings (Figure 1b,c). Microscopic inspection of the root columella cells revealed a reduced level of statolite starch, as evaluated by image analysis after Lugol's staining (exo70A1, 2063 ± 1660 pixels, n = 6; WT, 7501 ± 2915 pixels, n = 8; Student's t-test P = 0.0004; Figure 1b). However, root gravitropism was unaffected, as the only root gravitropic defect observed in exo70A1 plants was transient primary root disorientation during seed germination. Whereas only 3% of WT primary roots started to grow in a direction differing by more than 45° from the gravity vector (n = 370), as many as 25% of exo70A1 roots showed such disorientation (n = 117). Normal root growth direction, however, was established in those seedlings in the 3 days after germination. [[FIGURE]] The ProDR5:GUS auxin response reporter (Ulmasov et al., CITATION) was used to reveal defects of exo70A1 roots in auxin metabolism, transport or signalling. The GUS signal was weaker in the root tips of 4-day-old light-grown exo70A1 seedlings than in the WT (exo70A1, 27.5 ± 4.5, n = 10; WT, 40.1 ± 5.3, n = 10; Student's t-test P = 0.0003; Figure 1c). Furthermore, rootward (acropetal) transport of [3H]indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) from the shoot–root transition zone was assayed, and was found to be decreased by ~40% in exo70A1-2 (disintegrations per minute, DPM = 829 ± 91; n = 10) compared with the WT (DPM = 1321 ± 69; n = 10; Student's t-test P < 0.0001; Figure 1d). A comparable decrease in auxin transport was also detected for exo70A1-1, another exo70A1 mutant allele, but not for GFP:EXO70A1 complemented exo70A1-2 plants (Figure S1). Subsequent analyses of ProDR5:GUS expression after external application of IAA locally on the shoot–root transition zone confirmed our previous observation (Figure 1e). In WT plants, IAA was transported towards the root tip and induced ProDR5:GUS expression along the vascular tissue within 3 h, thereby reporting efficient IAA canalization into the stele and transport to the root tip (Figure 1e). In exo70A1, on the contrary, IAA was accumulated around the region of application, was improperly canalized and the GUS signal along most of the vascular tissue length was still absent 3 h after application (Figure 1e; quantitative analysis in Figure S2), indicating that the rootward auxin transport was retarded. The observed decrease in rootward auxin transport is more consistent with what has been reported for loss of PIN function (25–35%) rather than the greater decreases (60–80%) seen in abcb mutants (Blakeslee et al., CITATION). Consistent with an impact primarily on PIN-mediated auxin transport, the ABCB19 inhibitor gravacin (Rojas-Pierce et al., CITATION) inhibited the rootward transport in exo70A1 only 15% more than in the WT, and the AUX1/LAX auxin uptake inhibitor 1-NOA had no less effect on transport in exo70A1 when applied to seedlings 1 h after auxin application (Figure 1d). We conclude that rootward PAT is severely affected in Arabidopsis exo70A1 mutants, possibly in a PIN-dependent way. The exo70A1 mutant accumulates a portion of PIN2:GFP in abnormally expanded endomembrane compartments that can be visualized with FM4-64 dye 30 min after application, and that are absent in the WT (Figure 2a). These compartments were observed in all exo70A1-2 seedlings analysed with an average incidence of 7.0% of root cells per plant (12 plants, total cell number = 330). We did not detect such compartments in any WT plant analysed (n = 12, total cell number = 290). In the case of exo70A1-1 (Figure S3), we detected the abnormal compartments with an average incidence of 6.5% in all mutant seedlings studied (10 plants, total cell number = 353). Again, no such compartment was detected in WT plants (n = 9, total cell number = 338). The difference in the incidence of these abnormal compartments between WT and mutant plants was tested using the generalized linear models with binomial distribution of errors (GLMbinom). The weight of each individual plant in the model was proportional to the number of cells analysed. The significance of GLMbinom was tested through the χ2 test (Faraway, CITATION) and found to be highly significant (P < 0.0001). [[FIGURE]] These abnormal endomembrane compartments are positive for YFP:RAB-A5d, a marker of recycling endosomes (Geldner et al., CITATION) (Figure 2b), but are clearly distinct from the early endosome/trans-Golgi network marked by the VHA-a1:GFP marker (Dettmer et al., CITATION) (Figure 2c). A significant difference between WT and exo70A1 mutant cells was also observed in the re-establishment of the localization of PIN1 and PIN2 to the PM after BFA-induced internalization and subsequent BFA removal (GLMbinom P < 0.0001; the numbers of analysed seedlings and cells are indicated in Table S1). A 2-h BFA treatment resulted in the internalization of PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP in both WT and exo70A1 plants (Figure 3a,b). Washout of BFA resulted in the re-establishment of PM localization of both PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP after 30 min in the WT. In contrast, BFA compartments containing GFP-tagged PINs were still present in cells even 90 min after the washout in exo70A1 seedlings (Figure 3a,b). To exclude that the disaggregation of BFA compartments after BFA washout was affected by different accumulation of BFA compartments after 2 h of BFA treatment, we compared the proportion of affected cells after 2 h of BFA treatment in both WT and exo70A1 expressing PIN2:GFP. We found no difference between both genotypes (GLMbinom P > 0.05; Table S1). [[FIGURE]] We observed the relocalization of both PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP proteins from BFA compartments to the apical PM domain after a prolonged 12 h of BFA treatment in WT cells, which is consistent with a previous report by Kleine-Vehn et al. (CITATION). In contrast, such relocalization was significantly impaired in exo70A1 mutants, where PIN proteins remained accumulated mainly in BFA compartments (GLMbinom, P < 0.0001; Table S1; Figure 3a,b), pointing strongly to the EXO70A1 function in the recycling of PINs between endomembrane compartments and the PM. Although we observed the partial relocalization of PIN1:GFP from basal to apical PM, referred to as transcytosis in the WT, it was not so pronounced in exo70A1 cells (Figure 3a). Despite the fact that BFA compartments were still present after prolonged BFA treatment, partial PIN2:GFP super-apicalization, i.e. the relocalization of PINs to the middle of the apical membrane, was documented in exo70A1 epidermal cells (Figure 3b). To confirm results from both transient and prolonged chronic BFA treatment, and to eliminate possible artefacts caused by GFP fusions, we also visualized the effect of BFA using anti-PIN1 and anti-PIN2 antibodies (Figure S4) as well as FM4-64 (Figure S5). These experiments provided data identical to results obtained with GFP-tagged PIN1 and PIN2, and fully proved our observations. Similar defects in PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP recycling, after both transient and prolonged BFA treatment, were also observed in the sec8-m1 mutant partially complemented by ProLAT52:SEC8 (Cole et al., CITATION) (Figure 3a,b). Again, the difference between WT and mutant plants was highly significant (GLMbinom, P < 0.0001; Table S1). Loss of EXO70A1 function also affected the trafficking of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, a transmembrane protein that constitutively cycles between endomembrane compartments and the PM through BFA-sensitive trafficking (Geldner et al., CITATION). BFA treatment of WT and exo70A1 seedlings expressing BRI1:GFP resulted in the formation of BRI1-positive BFA compartments (Figure 4); recycling of BRI1:GFP back to the PM was significantly delayed after the washout, and relocalization of BRI1:GFP from BFA compartments to the PM after prolonged BFA treatment was blocked in exo70A1 mutants (Figure 4). In both cases, the difference between WT and mutant plants was highly significant (GLMbinom, P < 0.0001; Table S1). These results suggest that the EXO70A1 exocyst subunit is required for a more general recycling of PM proteins. [[FIGURE]] After transformation of heterozygous exo70A1 plants with Pro35S:GFP:EXO70A1, the restoration of WT phenotypes was observed in exo70A1 homozygotes (Figure S6). GFP:EXO70A1 was localized evenly at the PM, partially in the cytoplasm and at post-cytokinetic cross walls in both transformed mutant plants and WT (Figure 5a; Fendrych et al., CITATION). We also recorded a similar localization for other exocyst subunits ProSEC8:GFP:SEC8 and Pro35S:YFP:SEC10 (Figure 5a). The PM localization of all exocyst subunits tested was resistant to treatment with 50 μm BFA for 2 h (Figure 5b). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Mutant Arabidopsis lines exo70A1 (Synek et al., CITATION) and sec8-m1 (Cole et al., CITATION) have been described previously, as well as lines expressing ProDR5:GUS (Ulmasov et al., CITATION), VHA-a1:GFP (Dettmer et al., CITATION), YFP:RAB-A5d (Geldner et al., CITATION), PIN1:GFP (Benková et al., CITATION), PIN2:GFP (Xu and Scheres, CITATION) and BRI1:GFP (Russinova et al., CITATION). The preparation of Col-0 lines expressing GFP:EXO70A1 and GFP:SEC8 was described in Fendrych et al. (CITATION). The SEC10 CDS was cloned into a modified pVKH vector using SpeI and SalI sites to yield the YFP:SEC10 fusion, and the construct was used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Col-0 plants. Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized (10 min in 20% commercial bleach and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water; Bochemie, http://www.savo.eu) and dispersed onto agar plates with growing medium: half-strength MS salts (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose (Fluka, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Fluka), vitamins, 1.6% (w/v) plant agar (Duchefa, http://www.duchefa.com), buffered to pH 5.7. Stratification was performed at 4°C for 3 days. Seedlings were either grown vertically or grown on an inclined agar surface (at a 50° angle from the horizontal) in a climate chamber held at 22°C under long-day conditions (16 h of light per day). Rootward auxin transport was measured in 7-day-old seedlings, as described in Blakeslee et al. (CITATION), with the following modifications: a 20-nl droplet of 1 mm IAA ([3H]IAA 25 Ci mmol−1; GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com/amarshamrads) was applied to the root–shoot transition zone. The 1-NOA inhibitor (20 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) was applied 1 h after the initiation of assays by pipetting 1-μl droplets in 0.3% agarose at the root–shoot transition zone. Gravacin (20 μm; Chembridge, http://www.chembridge.com) was applied after 1 h as 5-μl droplets on the surface of each primary root, with the solution restricted to the chromatography paper strip supporting this section of the root. As roots of light-grown exo70A1 seedlings are on average about 30% shorter than WT roots (Synek et al., CITATION), only exo70A1 and WT seedlings with comparable root length were used for the measurements. Auxin transport was visualized in 7-day-old seedlings expressing ProDR5:GUS similarly as described in Rashotte et al. (CITATION). Plantlets were treated with an application of 10 μm IAA (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 1% agar cylinder on the root–shoot junction for 3, 6 or 12 h. For GUS staining, seedlings were vacuum infiltrated with staining solution [50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 250 μm K3Fe(CN)6, 250 μm K4Fe(CN)6, 2% Triton-X and 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronic acid (X-GlcA); Duchefa, http://www.duchefa.com) for 1 h and then incubated at 37°C until proper colour development. Tissue was stepwise cleared (by 30 min) in 20% ethanol, 40% ethanol, a mixture of ethanol : acetic acid (3:1), 40% ethanol and 20% ethanol, and then mounted in 50% glycerol for imaging. To evaluate the staining intensity, we counted the number of pixels for which the signal in the blue channel was stronger than a threshold value. To test for significant differences between WT and mutant plants, we first used the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality and subsequently applied the Student's t-test. Five-day-old seedlings were stained for 15 min with Lugol's solution, followed by a 10-min wash. Images of root tips were analysed with imagej: the intensity of the signal was evaluated as the number of pixels of brightness darker than 45 on the 256-degree grey scale. To test for a significant difference between WT and mutant plants, we first used the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality and subsequently applied the Student's t-test. Seedlings were transferred from agar plates into six-well cell culture plates containing half-strength MS liquid medium supplemented with 50 μm BFA (50 mm stock in DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated under light conditions in a climate chamber for 2 h. DMSO in the same final concentration (0.1%) was added to negative controls. The washout of BFA was performed by the transfer of seedlings to medium without the drug. Seedlings were labelled by FM4-64 (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) at a final concentration of 5 μm 30 min before observation. After fixing 4-day-old seedlings in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2.5 h under low pressure we followed the procedure described by Friml et al. (CITATION), employing an InsituPro roboter, except we used an MTSB buffer (50 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgSO4, pH 6.9) for the whole procedure instead of PBS. Both the goat anti-PIN1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, http://www.scbt.com) and the chicken anti-PIN2 antibody (Agrisera, http://www.agrisera.com) were diluted 1:300. Secondary antibodies anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) and anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:600. Seedlings expressing ProDR5:GUS or stained with Lugol's solution (Sigma-Aldrich) were documented using an Olympus BX-51 microscope with an Olympus DP50 camera attached (Olympus, http://www.olympus.com). Seedlings expressing fluorescently labelled proteins and immunolabelled seedlings were observed using a Zeiss LSM 5 DUO confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Zeiss C-Apochromat 40 × /1.2 water-corrected objective (Zeiss, http://corporate.zeiss.com). For live imaging, we used a chambered coverglass Lab-Tek II (Thermo Scientific, http://www.nuncbrand.com) in which seedlings in half-strength MS liquid medium were fixed under a block of agar.
