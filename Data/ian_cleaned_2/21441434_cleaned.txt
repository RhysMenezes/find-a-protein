!~ABS~! The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an essential ubiquitin protein ligase, regulates mitotic progression and exit by enhancing degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as CYCB1;1, whose transcripts are upregulated by DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). DUO1 is required for cell division in male gametophytes and is a target of microRNA 159 (miR159) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Whether APC/C is required for DUO1-dependent CYCB1;1 regulation is unknown. Mutants in both APC8 and APC13 had pleiotrophic phenotypes resembling those of mutants affecting microRNA biogenesis. We show that these apc/c mutants had reduced miR159 levels and increased DUO1 and CYCB1;1 transcript levels and that APC/C is required to recruit RNA polymerase II to MIR159 promoters. Thus, in addition to its role in degrading CYCB1;1, APC/C stimulates production of miR159, which downregulates DUO1 expression, leading to reduced CYCB1;1 transcription. Both MIR159 and APC8–yellow fluorescent protein accumulated in unicellular microspores and bicellular pollen but decreased in tricellular pollen, suggesting that spatial and temporal regulation of miR159 by APC/C ensures mitotic progression. Consistent with this, the percentage of mature pollen with no or single sperm-like cells increased in apc/c mutants and plants overexpressing APC8 partially mimicked the duo1 phenotype. Thus, APC/C is an integrator that regulates both microRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of CYCB1;1 and degradation of CYCB1;1.
!~RES~! DCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA biogenesis in plants (CITATION), and seeds from dcl1 null alleles cannot be obtained due to embryo lethality. However, a weak allele of dcl1, dcl1-14 (in which the T-DNA insertion is located in the promoter region, SALK_056243; see Supplemental Figure 1A online), showed curly leaves, abnormal reproductive development, and reduced miRNA levels (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1C online) but is fertile. We therefore performed a genetic screen after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of dcl1-14, aimed at the isolation of mutants with enhanced or suppressed phenotypes. We isolated a mutant with much more severe developmental phenotypes than those of dcl1-14. The pleiotropic phenotypes included distorted leaf shapes, abnormal shoot meristem development, and a delay in the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage (Figures 1A and 1B). Moreover, the mutant had severely abnormal flower and silique development, including bushy inflorescences and shorter siliques (Figures 1C and 1D). We showed that these phenotypes were dcl1-14 independent by backcrossing to wild-type plants. Therefore, the mutant without dcl1-14 background was used for our subsequent analyses. Collectively, these pleiotropic developmental defects suggested that the mutated gene had roles at multiple stages of plant development. [[FIGURE]] To further understand the basis of these heritable pleiotropic phenotypes, we examined their inheritance in F2 progeny from a cross of a mutant plant (Columbia [Col]) to a wild-type Landsberg erecta plant. The genotype was determined for 661 F2 plants with obvious mutant phenotypes, which comprised ~10% of the F2 population. Characterization of Col/Landsberg erecta polymorphisms throughout the genome showed that all plants with the mutant phenotype were homozygous for the Col haplotype at one region on chromosome 3, suggesting that a disrupted gene in this region was responsible for the mutant phenotype. This region was narrowed down to an interval between BAC clones F18E5 and T8O5 (five recombinants and two recombinants, respectively, out of 1322 chromosomes examined). We sequenced the genes in this region and found a point mutation (G to A) in the coding region of APC8. This mutation resulted in the conversion of a highly conserved Asp (Asp-309) to an Asn at a position adjacent to the TPR domain (Figure 1F). To confirm that this mutation was responsible for the phenotype, a genomic fragment was fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and introduced into the mutant. The morphological phenotypes were fully rescued in 23 of 25 plants (Figure 1E). Therefore, we concluded that the phenotypes were due to the mutation in APC8 and designated this allele apc8-1. To determine whether Arabidopsis APC8 is a functional ortholog of APC8 found in other eukaryotes, we tested whether Arabidopsis APC8 was able to functionally complement an APC8 mutant in fission yeast. We introduced full-length cDNAs of both APC8 and mutant apc8-1 (APC8 D to N) into a yeast expression vector under the control of the Gal promoter. These constructs were then transformed into the temperature-sensitive cut23-174 mutant, which has a lesion in the APC8 gene in S. pombe. This mutant can grow at 28°C but not at 37°C (CITATION). Expression of wild-type APC8 rescued the yeast mutant strain at the restrictive temperature, whereas an empty vector or the mutant apc8-1 did not (Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover, a construct in which the Asp was changed to Glu (APC8 D to E) only partially complemented the yeast mutant at 37°C (Figures 2A and 2B), which reinforces the idea that the conserved Asp is important for APC8 function. [[FIGURE]] Microarray analyses indicated that APC/C genes were ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis tissues (CITATION). To validate the expression pattern of APC8, we performed RT-PCR analyses using cDNA samples from different Arabidopsis tissues. APC8 expression was detected in a variety of vegetative and reproductive tissues (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). To substantiate the RT-PCR analyses, we constructed different promoter-reporter constructs. The β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter was expressed in almost all tissues examined, including leaves, shoot apical meristems, inflorescences, and siliques (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). During male gametophyte development, the GFP reporter was detectable at the unicellular and bicellular stages but appeared less intense at the tricellular stage (see Supplemental Figure 2C online). We therefore examined the subcellular localization of a pAPC8:APC8-YFP fusion protein during male gametophyte development. This protein fusion construct complemented the apc8-1 phenotypes completely (Figure 1E), showing that YFP-tagged APC8 was functional. Foci of APC8-YFP were visible in the nuclei and cytoplasm of unicellular microspores (Figure 3A) and bicellular pollen (Figure 3B), but only a very faint signal was detected in tricellular pollen (Figure 3C), and no signal was detectable in mature pollen (Figure 3D). Moreover, the foci of APC8-YFP varied in different microspores and pollen grains (Figure 3). [[FIGURE]] Microscopy analysis showed that the siliques in apc8-1 had many (~66%) apparently undeveloped ovules (Figure 4A), which led to obviously reduced seed set (Figure 4B). The mutant was backcrossed to the wild type, and the F1 was allowed to self-pollinate. Only ~10% of the F2 progeny had the mutant phenotypes, instead of the expected 25%. These results suggested that the mutant had transmission problems. Reciprocal crosses with wild-type plants showed that transmission through the female was mildly affected but was strongly perturbed through the male (Table 1). To rule out the possibility that disturbed male transmission was specific to APC8, we analyzed the T-DNA insertion allele of another APC/C component, APC13 (SALK_027397, here named apc13-2), which was reported to have a bonsai phenotype (CITATION) similar to that of apc8-1. We found slightly reduced seed set in apc13-2 (Figure 4B), and reciprocal crosses with wild-type plants indicated that male transmission was more affected than female transmission (Table 1). [[FIGURE]] Genetic Analysis of apc8-1 and apc13-2 Because decreased APC/C function resulted in a reduced seed set phenotype, we next tested whether increased APC/C function had an effect on seed set. We generated transgenic plants overexpressing APC8 under the control of the HISTONE THREE RELATED 10 (HTR10) promoter. HTR10 is specifically expressed in the male germ line, and HTR10 accumulates in generative cell nuclei and subsequently in sperm cell nuclei (CITATION). We obtained 24 independent T1 lines; T2 plants from five T1 lines with single copy insertions were used for further analyses. The T-DNA cassette carrying APC8 also contained a pollen-specific marker (LAT52-GFP), which we used to confirm homozygous plants. We measured the relative expression levels of APC8 RNA in these plants by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and compared the expression levels with those in wild-type plants (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). We also scored the seed set (see Supplemental Figure 3B online). All T2 progenies tested showed higher (3.4- to 15.2-fold) APC8 expression levels (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). These plants also had, on average, 27% reduced seed set (see Supplemental Figure 3B online), indicating that the higher APC8 levels in the male germline disrupted seed set. Given the importance of cell cycle regulation by APC/C (CITATION) and the dynamic expression of APC8 during male gametophyte development (Figure 3), we suspected that disrupting APC/C function might lead to disorganized cell divisions during male gametophyte development. Indeed, when mature pollen from apc8-1 plants was stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), the proportion of uninucleate cells was 45% and binucleate cells was 37%, whereas in wild-type plants, these proportions were 8 and 9%, respectively (Figures 4C). Introduction of wild-type APC8 into apc8-1 completely rescued these defects of male gametophyte development (Figure 4C), confirming that apc8-1 was responsible for these phenotypes. The defects in pollen maturation in apc13-2 showed a similar trend but were less severe than those in apc8-1 (Figure 4C). A representative HTR10:APC8 transgenic T2 plant (line 8-2) showed increased incidence of bicellular pollen, but no change in the incidence of unicellular pollen (Figure 4C), consistent with the specific expression of HTR10 in the male germline. If the vegetative cell and the generative cell fail to divide in apc/c mutants and in APC8 overexpression lines, the expectation might be that further DNA replication would not occur. We therefore investigated DNA content in the vegetative cell nuclei and the generative cell-like nuclei in apc8-1 and in the generative cell-like nuclei in an HTR10:APC8 plant (line 8-2). Relative to the nuclear DNA content in the wild type, nuclear DNA content in both the vegetative cell nuclei and the generative cell-like nuclei in apc8-1 was significantly increased, to nearly 2C (Figure 4D), suggesting that in apc8-1, pollen containing only a vegetative cell nucleus and pollen containing a single sperm cell both finish DNA replication but cannot enter the subsequent mitosis. As expected, the nuclear DNA content in the generative cell-like nuclei in HTR10:APC8-expressing plants increased, also to nearly 2C (Figure 4D). To examine whether pollen cell fate was disturbed, we introduced pHTR10:HTR10-mRFP (CITATION) into apc8-1. This marker was observed in sperm cell nuclei of apc8-1 mature pollen (see Supplemental Figure 3C online), indicating that sperm cells in apc8-1 had not lost their gametic fate. Taken together, our results indicate that APC/C plays an important role in mitotic cell cycle progression during male gametophyte development, promoting tricellular pollen formation. Because apc8-1 was identified while looking for miRNA accumulation mutants, we hoped to determine the molecular mechanism by which APC8 regulates male gametophyte development by examining whether apc8-1 was compromised in miRNA accumulation. Of 10 tested miRNAs, miR159 accumulation was obviously reduced (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Figure 4A online), and this molecular phenotype was rescued by wild-type APC8 (Figure 5A), suggesting that APC8 was involved in the miR159 biogenesis pathway. We also found obvious reductions in accumulation of miR166, miR172, miR173, and miR319, but no detectable changes for miR156, miR164, miR167, miR168, and miR171 (see Supplemental Figure 4A online), suggesting that the role of APC8 in miRNA biogenesis is locus specific. Similar defects in mature miR159 accumulation were observed in apc13-2 (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). miR159 is encoded by three genes (MIR159a, MIR159b, and MIR159c) (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To investigate which step in miR159 biogenesis was affected, we used qPCR to examine whether primary (pri) miRNA transcription of each MIR159 was affected in the pollen of apc/c mutants. We detected reduced pri-miR159 transcription from all three MIR159 genes in apc8-1 and apc13-2, most notably an ~70% decrease for MIR159c in apc8-1 (Figure 5B). As expected, overexpression of APC8 resulted in increased pri-miR159 transcription (Figure 5B). To further confirm these results and to determine the expression patterns of each MIR159 during male gametophyte development, we generated constructs in which the promoter regions of MIR159a, b, or c were fused to GFP. We introduced these constructs into wild-type and apc/c mutants and examined multiple transgenic lines for each construct. In the wild type, MIR159a-GFP, MIR159b-GFP, and MIR159c-GFP were strongly expressed at the unicellular microspore stage, detectable at the bicellular stage, but undetectable at the tricellular stage; their expression was restricted to vegetative cell nuclei (Figure 5C). By contrast, in apc8-1, none of these reporter gene fusions was detectable at any stage of male gametophyte development. Consistent with the much weaker phenotypes in apc13-2 than in apc8-1 described above, we observed only a slight reduction of expression of the three MIR159-GFPs in apc13-2 (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). Since GFP signal intensity was not a quantitative measure of reporter gene expression, we performed qPCR to determine the levels of GFP mRNA in inflorescences. Indeed, GFP mRNA levels were lower in apc/c mutants than in the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 4C online). These results indicate that APC/C is required for miR159 biogenesis during male gametophyte development and that it acts at the transcriptional level. Although we showed that in the apc/c mutants the levels of pri-miR159 and the activities of the MIR159 promoters were compromised, the defects in MIR gene transcription in apc/c mutants could be an indirect effect of reduced expression of certain known genes in the miRNA biogenesis pathway. To evaluate this possibility, we first examined the expression of several miRNA biogenesis pathway genes in apc8-1 by qPCR. None of these genes was affected in apc8-1 (see Supplemental Figure 5A online). Furthermore, the protein levels of these genes were comparable to those in the wild type (see Supplemental Figures 5B and 5C online). Therefore, the reduced pri-miRNA and mature miRNA levels in the apc/c mutants are unlikely due to reduced expression of miRNA biogenesis genes. This result prompted us to examine whether APC/C plays a direct role in the transcription of MIR genes. Pol II is responsible for MIR transcription in animals and plants (CITATION; CITATION; Kim et al., 2011). Therefore, we next examined Pol II occupancy at promoters of several MIR genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an antibody against the largest subunit of Pol II (RPB1). We monitored MIR159a, MIR159b, MIR159c, MIR166a, MIR167a, and MIR171a using Actin2 as a positive control (Figures 6A and 6B). Pol II occupancy was enriched at regions encompassing the transcription start sites at these loci (MIR159b_1 and MIR159b_2 represent two regions flanking two transcription start sites in MIR159b loci, respectively), over the no antibody ChIP that served as a negative control (Figures 6A and 6B). Pol II occupancy at these loci was significantly reduced in apc8-1 (Figure 6B). These results indicate that APC/C promotes Pol II recruitment to MIR genes. [[FIGURE]] Because miR159 biogenesis was perturbed in these apc/c mutants, we next asked whether this perturbation had biological significance. Since DUO1, an miR159 target (CITATION), was reported to play a role in twin sperm cell formation (CITATION), we first used qPCR to examine whether DUO1 expression was affected in the pollen of apc/c mutants. The mRNA level of DUO1 in apc8-1 was increased ~2-fold (Figure 7A), consistent with the notion that DUO1 is negatively regulated by miR159. By contrast, DUO3, which has a function similar to that of DUO1 but is not a miR159 target, had similar expression levels in apc8-1 and wild-type pollen (Figure 7A). A similar trend was observed for apc13-2 (Figure 7A). As expected, DUO1 levels were reduced in HTR10:APC8 pollen (Figure 7A). To substantiate the above result, we compared the expression level of DUO1-mRFP at different stages during pollen development in wild-type or apc8-1 plants containing the pDUO1:DUO1-mRFP construct. We consistently observed a slightly increased intensity of DUO1-mRFP signals through early bicellular stage to mature pollen in apc8-1 (Figure 7B). Therefore, our results demonstrate that APC/C plays a role in miR159 biogenesis that is important for miR159-dependent DUO1 repression. [[FIGURE]] As increased DUO1 expression was observed in apc/c mutants (Figure 7) and CYCB1;1 expression was reported to be promoted by DUO1 (CITATION), we speculated that APC/C might affect not only the stability of CYCB1;1 but also expression of CYCB1;1. To test this hypothesis, we compared CYCB1;1 mRNA levels in wild-type and apc8-1 pollen by qPCR. There was significantly more CYCB1;1 mRNA in apc8-1 than in the wild type (Figure 8A). Similarly, increased CYCB1;1 mRNA was also observed in apc13-2 (Figure 8A). Taken together, these results indicate that APC/C can regulate CYCB1;1 expression. [[FIGURE]] To determine if CYCB1;1 accumulates during male gametogenesis in these apc/c mutants, we introduced pCYCB1;1:CYCB1;1-GFP into wild-type, apc8-1, and apc13-2 plants. In the wild type, CYCB1;1-GFP was detected only in the nucleus of unicellular microspores and in the vegetative nucleus of bicellular pollen, but not in tricellular or mature pollen (Figure 8B), consistent with microarray results (CITATION). By contrast, CYCB1;1-GFP accumulated in nuclei of both the vegetative cell and sperm cells of tricellular and mature pollen from apc8-1(Figure 8B) and apc13-2 (see Supplemental Figure 6A online). The CYCB1;1-GFP accumulation in vegetative nuclei and expanded expression in sperm cell nuclei at the tricellular stage in these apc/c mutants suggest that APC/C is necessary for removal of CYCB1;1 during male gametophyte development. To further support the observation of accumulated CYCB1;1-GFP in apc8-1, we used immunoblots to examine the total protein levels of CYCB1;1-GFP in inflorescences from multiple individual wild-type and apc8-1 transgenic plants expressing pCYCB1;1:CYCB1;1-GFP. CYCB1;1-GFP was greatly increased in apc8-1 (see Supplemental Figure 6B online), further indicating that disruption of APC8 function caused the failure of CYCB1;1 degradation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that APC/C, in addition to its known role in regulating CYCB1;1 degradation, can regulate CYCB1;1 at the mRNA level.
!~MM~! The pDUO1:DUO1-mRFP and pHTR10:HTR10-mRFP seeds were kindly provided by David Twell and Fred Berger, respectively. The pDCL1:DCL1-YFP and pHYL1:HYL1-YFP plasmids were kindly provided by David L. Spector. T-DNA insertion mutants (SALK_027397, apc13-2; SALK_056243, dcl1-14) were obtained from the ABRC. The Schizosaccaromyces pombe temperature-sensitive apc8 strain (Cut23-174, FY9688) was obtained from the Yeast Genetic Resource Center in Japan (YGRC/NBRP). The Arabidopsis thaliana apc8-1 mutant was genotyped by ApoI digestion of the PCR fragment generated using primers APC8F2 and APC8R2; the fragment in the mutant is 25 bp smaller than that in the wild type, which is detectable when separated on a 3% agarose gel. APC8 was amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA with primers APC8F1 and APC8R1 (see Supplemental Table 1 online), cloned into pENTR-D/TOPO (Invitrogen), and then transferred into the plant expression destination vector pGWB40 (CITATION). The resulting plasmid was introduced into apc8-1 plants by agroinfiltration for complementation (CITATION). For APC8 promoter analysis, a 2.4-kb fragment upstream of the ATG was amplified using primers APC8F1 and APC8R7 and was subcloned into pENTR-D/TOPO and then transferred into the plant expression vectors pGII-NLS3XGFP (CITATION) and pMDC164 (CITATION). For yeast complementation, full-length cDNAs of APC8 and APC8-1 were amplified from leaves of Col-0 and apc8-1 plants, respectively, using RT-PCR and primers APC8F3 and APC8R3, and then cloned into the pYPGE15 yeast expression vector (Brunelli and Pall, 1993). The amino acid Asp was changed to Glu by site-directed mutagenesis using primers APC8F11 and APC8R11. These plasmids were introduced into the S. pombe temperature-sensitive Cut23-174 mutant (CITATION). For the HTR10:APC8 overexpression construct, we first generated a modified vector pB7WG2*. The vector pB7WG2 (CITATION) was digested with SacI and SpeI to replace the 35S promoter with the HTR10 promoter and then digested with KpnI and ApaI to insert the LAT52-GFP cassette. A LR reaction was performed between the TOPO vector containing the full-length APC8 cDNA and pGWB7*. For CYCB1;1 expression analysis, a genomic fragment of CYCB1;1, including a 2.5-kb fragment upstream of the ATG and downstream sequences to the stop codon, was amplified with primers CYCB1;1F1 and CYCB1;1R1 and subcloned into pENTR-D/TOPO and then transferred into the plant expression destination vector pMDC107 (CITATION). For MIR159 expression analysis, fragments of 1.9, 2.4, or 1.6 kb upstream of the first nucleotide of MIR159a, MIR159b, and MIR159c, respectively, were subcloned into pENTR-D/TOPO and then transferred into the plant expression vector pGIINLS3XGFP (CITATION). The primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. A single colony of cut23-174 was grown in YEA medium (5 g/L yeast extract, 30 g/L Glc, 225 mg/L adenine, 225 mg/L His, 225 mg/L Leu, 225 mg/L Lys hydrochloride) for 2 to 3 d at 28°C. One microgram of DNA of pYPGE15, pYPGE15-APC8, pYPGE15-APC8DΔE, or pYPGE15-APC8DΔN was transformed into 100 μL freshly made competent cells. After incubation at 28°C for 2 h, the cell suspension with each plasmid was divided and plated on YEA plates, one incubated at 28°C and the other at 37°C. Colonies were observed after 2 to 3 d. A single colony from each plate was diluted 1:10, 1:100, or 1:1000 and spotted onto YEA plates for 2 to 3 d of growth. Photographs were taken after 2 to 3 d. For quantitation, a single colony from each plate was cultured in YEA liquid medium for 2 to 3 d at 28°C and then inoculated into fresh YEA liquid medium to a starting OD600 of 0.2 to 0.3 and then OD600 was measured after growth for 12 or 24 h. Three colonies were analyzed from each genotype, with two biological replicates. Pollen dissected from closed buds and open flowers from 10 to 15 individual transgenic T1 plants was stained with DAPI for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Images were acquired with an Axiovert microscope (Zeiss) under the epifluorescence channel (the excitation/emission wavelengths are 365 nm/397 nm [DAPI], 470 nm/505 to 530 nm [GFP], 500 nm/535 nm [YFP], and 545 nm/605 nm [RFP]) using an AxioCamRM camera and AxioVision 4.8.1 software. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe). Seed set analysis was according to CITATION. DNA content was determined as described by CITATION with modifications. Mature pollen from various genotypes was stained by DAPI. Relative DNA content of vegetative cell nuclei (Col-0 plants), vegetative cell-like nuclei (apc8-1), sperm cell nuclei (Col-0 plants), and generative cell-like nuclei (apc8-1 and HTR10:APC8 plants) were measured by DAPI fluorescence. Images were analyzed for fluorescence with AxioVision 4.8.1 software. A net value for each nucleus was obtained by subtracting a corresponding background reading from the cytoplasm. To standardize the relative fluorescence per C value of DNA, we first set the average net value of vegetative cell nuclei and sperm cell nuclei using wild-type mature pollen as 1C. Total RNA was isolated from inflorescences of Col-0, apc8-1, apc13-2, and APC8-YFP apc8-1. Small RNA hybridization for miRNAs was performed as described (CITATION). The 5′ end-labeled (32P) antisense oligonucleotides were used to detect U6 and miRNAs. Radioactive signals were detected with a phosphor imager. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed with three technical replicates for each of three biological replicates using a MyIQ Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad). The difference between the cycle threshold (Ct) of target genes and the Ct of control primers (ΔCt = Cttarget gene – Ctcontrol) was used to obtain the normalized expression of target genes. Primers are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. ChIP was performed according to CITATION. Pol II occupancy at several miRNA loci was determined by ChIP using anti-RPB1 antibody and 2-week-old seedlings from Col-0 and apc8-2, respectively. DNA present in the immunoprecipitates was quantified by qPCR relative to total input DNA. The results shown were consistent in two biological replicates. Commercial anti-RPB1 (Abcam) was used. The primer sets used for the PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. Tissue from 10 to 15 individual PAPC8-GUS transgenic T1 plants was fixed in 90% acetone for 2 to 3 h and then stained for 12 h in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, and 1 mM X-Gluc, then washed in 70% ethanol three times. Images were taken with a Nikon SMZ800 stereoscope. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe). Inflorescences were ground into powder in liquid nitrogen, agitated vigorously after adding 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed for 2 to 3 h at 80 V, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Mouse anti-GFP (Clontech) and anti-Hsc70 (Stressgen) antibodies were used at 1:2000 and 1:10,000 dilutions, respectively. HEN1 antibody and AGO1 antibody were made by X.C.’s lab. Detection was with an ECL plus detection kit (GE).
