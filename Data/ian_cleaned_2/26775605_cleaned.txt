!~ABS~! BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) was initially identified as a co-receptor of the brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRI1. Genetic analyses also revealed that BAK1 and its closest homolog BAK1-LIKE 1 (BKK1) regulate a BR-independent cell-death control pathway. The double null mutant bak1 bkk1 displays a salicylic acid- and light-dependent cell-death phenotype even without pathogen invasion. Molecular mechanisms of the spontaneous cell death mediated by BAK1 and BKK1 remain unknown. Here we report our identification of a suppressor of bak1 bkk1 (sbb1–1). Genetic analyses indicated that cell-death symptoms in a weak double mutant, bak1–3 bkk1–1, were completely suppressed by the loss-of-function mutation in SBB1, which encodes a nucleoporin (NUP) 85-like protein. Genetic analyses also demonstrated that individually knocking out three other nucleoporin genes from the SBB1-located sub-complex was also able to rescue the cell-death phenotype of bak1–3 bkk1–1. In addition, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, DRH1, was identified in the same protein complex as SBB1 via a proteomic approach. The drh1 mutation also rescues the cell-death symptoms of bak1–3 bkk1–1. Further analyses indicated that export of poly(A)+ RNA was greatly blocked in the nup and drh1 mutants, resulting in accumulation of significant levels of mRNAs in the nuclei. Over-expression of a bacterial NahG gene to inactivate salicylic acid also rescues the cell-death phenotype of bak1–3 bkk1–1. Mutants suppressing cell-death symptoms always showed greatly reduced salicylic acid contents. These results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, especially of molecules directly or indirectly involved in endogenous salicylic acid accumulation, is critical in BAK1- and BKK1-mediated cell-death control.
!~RES~! To understand the molecular mechanisms of BAK1- and BKK1-mediated cell-death control, we transformed an activation-tagging vector (pBASTA-AT2) into bak1–3 bkk1–1 to screen for genetic modifiers of the double mutant (Yuan et al., CITATION). Within T2 progeny generated from approximately 16 000 self-pollinated T1 lines, one of the suppressors showed a fully rescued cell-death phenotype, which was subsequently named sbb1–1 (suppressor of bak1 bkk1) (Figure 1a). After back-crossing bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 with bak1–3 bkk1–1, all the F1 progeny exhibited a phenotype similar to bak1–3 bkk1–1. However, in the F2 progeny, approximately a quarter of the plants showed a wild-type (WT)-like phenotype and three-quarters exhibited a typical cell death phenotype (Table S1), suggesting that a single recessive locus is responsible for the suppression phenotype. Molecular cloning of the genomic sequences flanking the T–DNA insertion site revealed that a T–DNA was inserted in the sixth exon of At4g32910, which encodes a putative NUP85-like protein (Figure 1b and Figure S1). Confocal microscopic analysis indicated that the SBB1–GFP fusion protein is indeed localized on the nuclear envelope (Figure 1c). An sbb1–1 single mutant was then generated by back-crossing bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 with Col–0. The second T–DNA insertion allele of SBB1, sbb1–2/nup85–1 (SALK_086258C), was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Figures 1b and 2a). RT–PCR analyses showed that transcripts of full-length SBB1 were not present in either sbb1–1 or sbb1–2 mutants (Figure S2), confirming that both alleles are null alleles. Neither allele alone displays any visible phenotypes compared to Col–0 (Figure 2a). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To examine whether cell death in bak1–3 bkk1–1 is truly suppressed by removal of SBB1, trypan blue staining was used to detect dead cells in the cotyledons of bak1 bkk1 sbb1 triple mutant plants and various other mutants. The results showed that cell death only occurs extensively in the bak1–3 bkk1–1 double mutant, but not in WT, sbb1 single mutants, or bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–2 triple mutants (Figure 2b–g). In our previous studies, we found that the SA-responsive genes PR1, PR2 and PR5 are significantly up-regulated in the bak1–4 bkk1–1 double mutant compared to Col–0 (He et al., CITATION). Expression of these three genes is drastically elevated in the bak1–3 bkk1–1 double mutant compared to Col–0, but greatly suppressed in the bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–2 triple mutants (Figure 2h–j). Consistent with this, the endogenous level of total SA is increased in the bak1–3 bkk1–1 double mutant and is almost restored to a WT-like level in the bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–2 triple mutants (Figure 2k). To further confirm that sbb1 is responsible for suppression of cell death in bak1–3 bkk1–1, a vector expressing SBB1 genomic DNA, driven by a native promoter (pSBB1::SBB1g), was transformed into the bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 triple mutant, and the results showed that pSBB1::SBB1 g recapitulates the cell-death phenotype (Figure 3a–f). The genetic backgrounds were verified by RT–PCR analyses (Figure S3). Relative expression of PR genes and the endogenous SA level in bak1–3 bkk1–1 were partially restored by pSBB1::SBB1g (Figure 3g–j). These results demonstrate that the putative nucleoporin SBB1 negatively regulates BAK1- and BKK1-controlled cell death. [[FIGURE]] To verify that the cell death seen in both the bak1–4 bkk1–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 double mutants is SA-dependent, we over-expressed NahG, a bacterial gene that encodes a hydroxylase that inactivates SA (Gaffney et al., CITATION), in the double mutants. Over-expression of NahG partially rescued the cell-death phenotype of the null double mutant bak1–4 bkk1–1 (He et al., CITATION), and almost fully restored the dwarf and cell-death phenotypes of the weak double mutant bak1–3 bkk1–1 (Figure 4a–d). The relative expression of PR genes and the endogenous SA content in bak1–3 bkk1–1 were restored to WT-like levels by 35S::NahG (Figure 4e–h). These results suggest that the cell death in bak1 bkk1 is SA-dependent. Although the bak1–3 bkk1–1, sbb1–1, sbb1–2, bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–2 plants did not display distinctive phenotypes when grown on SA-free medium for 2 weeks, bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–2 were less sensitive to exogenous SA treatment than the bak1–3 bkk1–1 double mutant (Figures 4i and S4). Our results indicate that, compared to bak1–3 bkk1–1, SA accumulation is restored in the bak1 bkk1 sbb1 triple mutants. These data suggest that SBB1 modulates cell death by altering the endogenous level of SA in bak1–3 bkk1–1. It is likely that SA is one of the main regulators of the cell death seen in the bak1 bkk1 double mutants. [[FIGURE]] The NUP107–160 sub-complex, located on the outer ring of the nuclear pore complex, is the largest sub-complex conserved in vertebrates and plants. In vertebrates, NUP75, a homolog of SBB1, belongs to the NUP107–160 sub-complex (Alber et al., CITATION; Zuccolo et al., CITATION). In plants, The NUP107–160 sub-complex contains eight putative NUPs, NUP160/SAR1, NUP133, NUP107, NUP96/MOS3/SAR3, SBB1/NUP85, NUP43, SEH1 and SEC13, for which only limited functions have been determined in plants (Zhang and Li, CITATION; Parry et al., CITATION; Xu and Meier, CITATION; Tamura et al., CITATION; Wiermer et al., CITATION; Tamura and Hara-Nishimura, CITATION). The specificity and overlapping functions of putative members of the NUP107–160 sub-complex prompted us to test whether additional NUPs other than SBB1 in this sub-complex contribute to BAK1- and BKK1-mediated cell-death control. Seven available T–DNA insertion mutants of the NUPs in the NUP107–160 sub-complex were crossed with bak1–3 bkk1–1 to generate triple mutants (Figures 5a–c and S5a–d). RT–PCR analyses verified the genetic backgrounds of these mutants (Figure S6a–g). Trypan blue staining showed that individual knockout of SEH1, NUP160 or NUP96, but not NUP107, NUP133, NUP43 or SEC13, is able to almost fully rescue the cell-death phenotype of bak1–3 bkk1–1 in cotyledons (Figures 5e–p and S5e–t). The expression of PR genes and endogenous SA levels were drastically down-regulated in the bak1–3 bkk1–1 seh1–1, bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup160–3 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup96–1 triple mutants compared to bak1–3 bkk1–1 (Figure 5u–w). Although the expressions of PR genes and endogenous SA contents were partially suppressed in bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup133–3, bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup107–1, bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup43–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 sec13b–1 compared to bak1–3 bkk1–1 (Figure S5u–x), the SA levels remain relatively high in the triple mutants, and the suppression of SA levels was not enough to suppress the cell death of bak1–3 bkk1–1. These results indicated that four members of the NUP107–160 sub-complex play more significant roles in BAK1- and BKK1-mediated cell-death control. [[FIGURE]] Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is an essential means of subcellular communication between cytoplasm and nucleus (Heese-Peck and Raikhel, CITATION), in which the nuclear pore complex plays a central role. Studies of plant NUPs are still in their infancy compared to those in vertebrates, humans and yeasts. Identification of novel components associated with the plant nuclear pore complex largely relies on proteomic approaches. Recently, Tamura et al. (CITATION) discovered 24 NUPs using interactive proteomics and linear ion trap mass spectrometer analyses. Using SBB1-GFP transgenic plants, we used a proteomic method to discover novel components associated with SBB1. After immunoprecipitation followed by an LC-MS/MS assay, a number of SBB1-interacting proteins, including DEAD-box RNA helicases, were obtained (Appendix S1). It was previously reported that some DEAD-box RNA helicases and RNA-binding proteins contribute to plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses (Gong et al., CITATION; Li et al., CITATION; Germain et al., CITATION; Guan et al., CITATION). Transient expression of 35S-DRH1-YFP showed that DRH1 localizes in the nucleus (Figure S7). We therefore selected DEAD-BOX RNA HELICASE 1 (DRH1, At3g01540) (Okanami et al., CITATION), which was co-immunoprecipitated with SBB1, for further analyses. A bak1–3 bkk1–1 drh1–1 triple mutant was subsequently generated by genetic crossing (Figure 5d). The genetic backgrounds were verified by RT–PCR analyses (Figure S6h). The dwarfism, cell-death phenotype, expression of PR genes and endogenous SA content of bak1–3 bkk1–1 were all suppressed by the loss-of-function mutation of DRH1 (Figure 5q–t,x). To further investigate whether DRH1 is associated with the NUP107–160 sub-complex, we performed yeast two-hybrid analyses to examine interactions of DRH1 with members of the NUP107–160 sub-complex. The results showed that DRH1 is able to physically interact with NUP107, suggesting that DRH1 is indeed associated with the NUP107–160 sub-complex (Figure S8). These results indicate that DRH1 is indeed required for BAK1- and BKK1-mediated cell-death control, possibly by coordinating with NUPs. The fact that sbb1 and drh1 suppress the cell-death phenotype of bak1–3 bkk1–1 suggests that RNA regulation such as mRNA export is critical for cell-death control. Thus, whole-mount in situ hybridization of mRNA was performed in various sbb1 and drh1 mutants. Our data showed extensive mRNA accumulation in the nuclei of the sbb1–1 and drh1–1 single mutants, as well as the bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1, bak1–3 bkk1–1 seh1–1, bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup160–3, bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup96–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 drh1–1 triple mutants (Figure 6a–l). Translocation of mRNAs is also more or less blocked in the nuclei of nup133–3, nup107–1 and nup43–1 single mutants and bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup133–3, bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup107–1 and bak1–3 bkk1–1 nup43–1 triple mutants, but not in sec13b–1 or bak1–3 bkk1–1 sec13b–1 mutants (Figure S9). These results clearly indicate that, in addition to SEH1, NUP160 and NUP96, whose functions in RNA export have been reported previously in Arabidopsis (Parry et al., CITATION; Wiermer et al., CITATION), SBB1, DRH1, NUP133, NUP107 and NUP43 also contribute significantly to mRNA export. To examine whether the SA biosynthetic mRNAs remain in the nuclei, we chose sbb1–1 and drh1–1 mutants, which are able to fully restore the cell-death phenotype of bak1–3 bkk1–1, for further investigation. We analyzed the relative expression of EDS1, EDS5, PAD4 and SID2, key genes that regulate SA biosynthesis, in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of Col–0, sbb1–1 and drh1–1 mutants. However, expression of these genes was too low to be detectable in separated cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions, even when using 400 ng of cDNA as the template for a 45-cycle amplification, especially for SID2. In addition, expression of these SA-related genes was not obviously increased in the nuclei of sbb1 and drh1 mutants compared with Col–0 (Figure S10), suggesting that mutations of SBB1 or DRH1 affect export of certain unknown mRNAs that may indirectly regulate SA production.

!~MM~! All of the Arabidopsis seeds used in these studies are in the Col–0 background. Plants were grown at 22°C under long-day growth conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) in a greenhouse except for those specified treatments. bak1–3 bkk1–1 was generated by genetic crossing as previously described (He et al., CITATION). A pBASTA-AT2 activation-tagging binary vector was transformed into bak1–3 bkk1–1 using the floral-dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION; Yuan et al., CITATION). sbb1–1 was identified in T2 progeny that are resistant to BASTA herbicide. bak1–3 bkk1–1 sbb1–1 was crossed with Col–0 for several generations to segregate bak1–3 bkk1–1, and back-crossed with bak1–3 bkk1–1 to segregate other possible T–DNA insertions in the genome. Mutants obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center were crossed to generate double or triple mutants. PCR and RT–PCR were performed to verify genotypes. The T–DNA lines used in these studies are sbb1–2/nup85–1 (SALK_086258C), seh1–1 (SALK_022717C), nup160–3 (SAIL_877_B01), nup96–1 (SALK_117966), drh1–1 (SALK_063362C), nup133–3 (WiscdsLox354H11), nup107–1 (SALK_057072C), nup43–1 (SALK_000711) and sec13b–1 (SALK_045825C). The primers used for nup mutant background verification by RT–PCR are listed in Table S2. Adapter ligation-mediated PCR was used to amplify the flanking genome sequences of the T–DNA from pBASTA-AT2-transformed plants (O'Malley et al., CITATION). Sequencing and RT–PCR were performed in the sbb1 mutant. The full-length coding sequence or genomic DNA with the 1520 bp promoter of SBB1 were amplified by regular PCR and cloned using a Gateway® cloning approach (Invitrogen, www.thermofisher.com/cn/zh/home/brands/invitrogen.html). A pBASTA-35S-NahG plasmid was constructed by PCR and Gateway® cloning from an NahG transgenic plant. Leaves of soil-grown seedlings were used for trypan blue staining as described previously (He et al., CITATION). Seven-day-old seedlings were used for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation and RNA and protein analyses as described previously (Wiermer et al., CITATION). Two micrograms of total RNA were used for reverse transcription with M–MLV (Invitrogen, www.thermofisher.com/cn/zh/home/brands/invitrogen.html). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II (TaKaRa, www.takara.com.cn), and relative expression of genes compared to ACT2 was calculated using the ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, CITATION). The primers used were PR1–F (5′-CATACACTCTGGTGGGCCTTA-3′), PR1–R (5′-CGCTAACCCACATGTTCACG-3′), PR2–F (5′-CGGGACGAGTGTGGAAAAC-3′), PR2–R (5′-ATAGCTTTCCCTGGCCTTCT-3′), PR5–F (5′-TCACCCACAGCACAGAGACA-3′), PR5–R (5′-CAATGCCGCTTGTGATGAAC-3′), EDS1–F (5′-GCTTACCTAACCGAGCGCTAT-3′), EDS1–R (5′-TGTCCGGATCGAAGAAATCT-3′), EDS5–F (5′-GTGGCCGTTTATCCTTGTTG-3′), EDS5–R (5′-AATGATCGTTGCTGCAGCTA-3′), PAD4–F (5′-TCTCCACCTCAATTTCACGAT-3′), PAD4–R (5′-GGCCAGAATTGTTCATTGCT-3′), SID2–F (5′-GCCGCCACTGAAAGGCTAAT-3′), SID2–R (5′-AGAAGATCGGGACGACCAAC-3′), ACT2–F (5′-TGTGCCAATCTACGAGGGTTT-3′) and ACT2–R (5′-TTTCCCGCTCTGCTGTTGT-3′). Seeds were surface-sterilized and grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.7) supplemented with 1% sucrose, 0.6% agar and various concentrations of SA, and then placed in a growth chamber at 22°C under 16 h light/8 h dark. Two-week-old seedlings were photographed and weighed. The treatments were repeated four times, and at least ten seedlings were measured for each genotype under each treatment. Student's t test was used to examine the significance of difference in fresh weights between WT plants and the mutants. SA extraction from plants was performed as described previously with some modifications (Marek et al., CITATION). Briefly, 0.1 g of 3-week-old soil-grown plants were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Then 1 ml of 90% methanol was added to the ground tissues and vortexed. The mixture was centrifuged at 14 000 g for 10 min, followed by extraction with another 0.5 ml of 100% methanol. The supernatants of the extractions were combined and vacuum-dried. The residue was re-suspended using 250 μl hydrolysis buffer (0.1 m NaAC, pH 5.5). Ten units of β–glucosidase (Sigma, www.sigmaaldrich.com/) were added, and the solution was incubated at 37°C for 90 min followed by addition of 250 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Then 1 ml of extraction solvent (100:99:1 ethyl acetate/cyclopentane/isopropanol) was added, followed by vortexing. The organic phase was vacuum-dried for HPLC analyses. Total proteins were extracted from 35S-SBB1-GFP transgenic plants using extraction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% v/v Triton X–100, 0.1% v/v Tween–20 and 1% protein inhibitor cocktail (Sangon, www.sangon.com/). Immunoprecipitation was performed using α–GFP antibodies (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated proteins was separated by SDS–PAGE, and analyzed by (LC-MS/MS were performed by BGI, http://www.genomics.cn/), as described previously (Tamura et al., CITATION). Leaves of 7-day-old seedlings grown on half-strength MS medium were fixed in formaldehyde – acetic acid – ethanol solution, and poly(A)+ RNAs were hybridized with a 5′-Alexa Fluor 488-labeled oligo(dT)45 probe as described previously (Gong et al., CITATION; Wiermer et al., CITATION). The probed RNA signals were observed under a FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, www.olympus-global.com). The methods for DRH1 cloning and transient expression in protoplast of Arabidopsis leaves are described in Methods S1. The method for the yeast two-hybrid assay is described in Methods S2.
