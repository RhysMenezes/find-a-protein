!~ABS~! Werner syndrome is associated with mutations in the DNA helicase RecQ3 [a.k.a. Homo sapiens (hs)WRN]. The function of hsWRN is unknown although biochemical studies suggest a role in DNA ends stability and repair. Unlike other RecQ family members, hsWRN possesses an N-terminal domain with exonuclease activity, which is stimulated by interaction with the Ku heterodimer. While this interaction is intriguing, we do not know whether it is important for hsWRN function. Although flies, worms, fungi and plants do not have RecQ-like (RQL) helicases with an intrinsic exonuclease activity, they possess proteins having domains homologous to the hsWRN exonuclease. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (at) encodes multiple RQL and a single protein with homology to the WRN exonuclease domain, atWEX (Werner-like Exonuclease). Here we show that atWEX has properties that are similar to hsWRN. atWEX binds to and is stimulated by atKu. Interestingly, stimulation by Ku is species-specific, as hsKu does not stimulate atWEX exonuclease activity. Likewise, atKu fails to enhance the exonuclease activity of hsWRN. Thus, in spite of the differences in structural organization, the functional interaction between WRN-like exonucleases and Ku has been preserved through evolutionary radiation of species, emphasizing the importance of this interaction in cell function.
!~RES~! We wanted to examine atWEX exonuclease activity and its relationship to hsWRN and Ku. For this purpose, we isolated cDNAs for atWEX, atKu70 and atKu80 and cloned them in frame with a flag-epitope tag into baculovirus expression vectors. Each protein was expressed and purified from insect cells by affinity purification (CITATION). To demonstrate that they possess their respective activities, each recombinant protein was first tested in biochemical assays. Recombinant atKu was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays for its ability to bind to DNA. As shown in CITATION, the addition of atKu to a reaction mixture containing a radiolabeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligomer resulted in the formation of a strong protein–DNA complex, indicating that atKu, like the homologous human factor (CITATION), binds to linear dsDNA molecules. We then examined the exonuclease activity of recombinant atWEX. Incubation of atWEX with radiolabeled, dsDNA substrates produced strong hydrolysis of 3′ recessed ends (CITATION, lanes 2–4), and somewhat less efficient hydrolysis of 3′ overhang or blunt ends (CITATION, lanes 7–9, and CITATION, lanes 2–4). A mutant atWEX (encoded by the wex-2 allele) missing the conserved exonuclease domain III did not show any hydrolytic activity (CITATION, lanes 5 and 10, CITATION, lane 5), indicating that the observed activity was intrinsic to atWEX and not caused by a co-purifying contaminant. Next, we determined whether atWEX binds to atKu. For this purpose, Sf9 insect cells were infected with various combinations of recombinant baculoviruses expressing epitope-tagged atWEX, atKu80 and atKu70. Extracts from the infected cells were incubated with the appropriate antibody resin to capture flag-atWEX (CITATION) or myc-atKu70 (CITATION), and the resulting immunoprecipitated products were resolved by SDS–PAGE. The presence of atKu80 in the flag-atWEX immunoprecipitation reaction, or atWEX in the myc-atKu70 immunoprecipitation reaction, was monitored by western blot with HA and flag antibodies, respectively. The results of these experiments indicate that both atKu70 and atKu80, as a complex or as single subunits, co-immunoprecipitated with atWEX. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation reactions confirmed that atWEX bound to Ku through interactions with both subunits (data not shown). The overall identity between H.sapiens and Arabidopsis Ku70 and 80 is 48 and 43%, respectively (BLASTP 2.2.10 analysis). Notwithstanding this limited sequence identity, atWex also binds to hsKu (CITATION), suggesting conservation in the interaction domains between these two factors. The possibility that this interaction was mediated by tethering of the proteins to DNA was discounted by treatment of the extracts with DNAseI (CITATION). In conclusion, these results indicate that atWEX, as observed with hsWRN, binds to Ku. We next examined whether atKu influences the exonuclease activity of atWEX. To this end, purified recombinant proteins were incubated with radiolabeled dsDNA substrates and the products of the reactions were examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in CITATION (lanes 2–4), the addition of atKu to the reaction mixture resulted in increased hydrolysis of 3′ recessed and blunt ended DNA substrates, indicating that atKu stimulates the nucleolytic activity of atWEX, as shown previously for hsWRN and hsKu (CITATION). Stimulation of atWEX activity by atKu was also observed on double-stranded oligomers with a 3′ overhang (data not shown). There appears to be, however, a quantitative difference between atWEX and hsWRN exonuclease activity, with the latter displaying more dramatic activation by Ku. We then examined whether the stimulation of atWEX and hsWRN exonuclease activities by Ku was conserved across species by assaying heterologous combinations of these proteins. Interestingly, while atKu was very effective at stimulating atWEX exonuclease activity on both 3′ recessed and blunt DNA ends, hsKu failed to significantly enhance atWEX exonuclease activity on both substrates (CITATION, lanes 5–7). Rather, stoichiometric amounts of hsKu slightly inhibited atWEX exonuclease activity on substrates with a 3′ recessed DNA end (CITATION, compare lanes1 and 5), but not on DNA substrates with blunt ends. The addition of a 4-fold excess of hsKu to atWEX, however, resulted in a minor but reproducible increase in exonuclease activity on the 3′ recessed ends (lane 7). The inability of Ku to stimulate the activity of the heterologous exonuclease was more dramatic in the reciprocal experiment, as hsWRN exonuclease activity was stimulated by hsKu (lanes 9–11), but not by its Arabidopsis counterpart atKu (lanes 12–14). Thus, a limited functional interaction was displayed by atWEX and hsKu, but not by hsWEX and atKu.
!~MM~! RNA was extracted using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) from flower buds of Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia (Col-0) er105 for wild-type atWEX, from the mutagenized derivative of Col-0 er105 for wex-2, and from Col-0 (for atKu70 and atKu80). A first strand cDNA segment containing the complete open reading frame of the target genes was synthesized by RT–PCR using RT–MMLV and random hexamers according to established protocols. The following primers for each gene were designed with NdeI sites (underlined) adjacent to the start ATG using Primer3 and then used to amplify the cDNA with Klentaq LA (Clontech). atWEX, 5′-CCATATGTCATCGTCAAATTGGATCGACGAC-3′ and 5′-TGAGCCACTGACAGCATCAGGAA-3′; atKu70, 5′-CATATGGAATTGGACCCAGATGATG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTCCCATCAAAAACAGACAA-3′; atKu80, 5′-CATATGGCACGAAATCGGGAGGGTTT-3′ and 5′-TTGTTAGCTCTCGAGCATTGACTCTTGT-3′. PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was then prepared using a plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by the Big-Dye fluorescent chain-terminator method. The sequence was analyzed using Sequencher (v4.1.2). The wex-2 allele (W226*) of the atWEX gene (At4g13870) was identified in a TILLING screen (CITATION). This mutation disrupts a restriction site for the enzyme NlaIV, facilitating genotyping. Flag-tagged atWEX, HA-atKu80, His-atKu80, myc-atKu70 and atKu70 were expressed individually or in various combinations in sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. The cDNAs coding for these factors were cloned into a pVL-based vector, and were then cotransfected with linearized BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) into sf9 cells to generate the recombinant baculoviruses. Cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressing FlagWEX were lysed in Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris, pH7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.7% Nonidet P-40) and FlagWEX was purified by chromatography on anti-Flag M2 agarose (Sigma). Cells infected with two recombinant baculoviruses expressing His-atKu80 and atKu70 were lysed in NTN buffer (0.7% NP-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8 and 100 mM NaCl) and the atKu complex was then purified by chromatography on a nickel-sepharose column (Pharmacia). All the buffers were supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors [1 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and 5mg/ml aprotinin]. Baculovirus amplification and sf9 cells were maintained as described in (CITATION). Recombinant hsWRN and Ku were purified from baculovirus-infected sf9 cells as described previously (CITATION). Sf9 cells infected with the appropriate recombinant baculoviruses were harvested 42–48 h postinfection and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in NTN containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and 5 mg/ml aprotinin), and incubated on ice for 20–30 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 18 000 g for 30 min at 4°C and then incubated with the appropriate resin [anti-flag agarose (Sigma); anti-HA agarose (Bethyl Inc.); nickel-sepharose (Pharmacia)] for 1–2 h at 4°C on a nutator. The beads were then washed four times with Low Salt Binding Buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl) (50 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a SDS–polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting using the appropriate antibodies [anti-Flag M2 (Sigma), anti-HA, anti-myc (Bethyl Inc.)]. When indicated, the extract was incubated with 0.5 U/µl DNAse I (Invitrogen) at 25°C for 15 min before the immunoprecipitation reaction. Exonuclease activity was measured with the following DNA substrates: 20-oligomer A1 (5′-CGCTAGCAATATTCTGCAGC-3′), 20-oligomer A2 (5′-GCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCG-3′) complementary to A1, and 46-oligomer A3 (5′-GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAAATCGGCGCG-3′) partially complementary to A1. Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with radiolabeled ATP. The appropriate oligonucleotides were annealed by boiling and slow cooling to room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 40 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, DNA substrates (∼40 fmol, 100 000 c.p.m.), and 50–200 fmol of atWEX protein, 100 fmol of WRN, 50–200 fmol of atKu or hsKu in a final volume of 10 µl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10–20 min and then the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 µl of a formamide-dye solution (95% formamide, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% bromphenol blue and 0.5% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 95°C for 3 min, DNA products were resolved by either 12 or 16% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The 20mer (A1) oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ end with radiolabeled ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed to a partially complementary 46mer (A3). Radiolabeled oligonucleotide (80 fmol and 200 000 c.p.m.) was incubated with increasing amounts (100–400 fmol) of atKu in 10 µl of buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol) at 25°C for 10 min. The samples were then resolved by electrophoresis through a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 10 V/cm in the cold room. The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and subjected to autoradiography.
