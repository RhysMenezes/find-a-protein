!~ABS~! The translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (Tic) plays a central role in plastid biogenesis by coordinating the sorting of nucleus-encoded preproteins across the inner membrane and coordinating the interactions of preproteins with the processing and folding machineries of the stroma. Despite these activities, the precise roles of known Tic proteins in translocation, sorting, and preprotein maturation have not been defined. In this report, we examine the in vivo function of a major Tic component, Tic110. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana Tic110 (atTic110) is essential for plastid biogenesis and plant viability. The downregulation of atTic110 expression results in the reduced accumulation of a wide variety of plastid proteins. The expression of dominant negative mutants of atTic110 disrupts assembly of Tic complexes and the translocation of preproteins across the inner envelope membrane. Together, these data suggest that Tic110 plays a general role in the import of nuclear-encoded preproteins as a common component of Tic complexes.
!~RES~! As a first step in our analysis, we examined the expression profile of atTic110 and investigated its interactions with other import components for clues to a general or specialized role in protein import. We examined the tissue distribution of atTic110 in Arabidopsis by immunoblotting extracts of various tissues using anti-atTic110 serum (Figure 1A). AtTic110 was present in flowers, leaves, stems, and roots (Figure 1A, top panel), although its levels in roots were significantly lower compared with other tissues. As a control, we immunoblotted the same protein extracts with an anti-atToc75 serum. AtToc75 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, consistent with its roles as a component of multiple import pathways into and across the envelope (CITATION; CITATION). The expression of atToc75 exhibited a similar distribution to atTic110, although the relative levels of the two proteins varied in some tissues (Figure 1A, compare leaf and root samples). These data demonstrate that atTic110 is present in green and nongreen tissues, indicating that it functions in various plastid types and is not restricted to chloroplasts. [[FIGURE]] Recent genetic and biochemical analysis of Toc components indicate that atToc159 and its related family members, atToc132 and atToc120, assemble to form structurally and functionally distinct Toc complexes (CITATION; CITATION). We tested whether atTic110 associates with all or a subset of Toc complexes by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-atToc120, -atToc132, or -atToc159 IgG-Sepharose. As shown in Figure 1B, atTic110 is detected in association with all three Toc complexes. On the basis of these data, we conclude that atTic110 is a common component of Tic complexes that associate with multiple Toc complexes to form functional import sites. The varied activities assigned to Tic110, including preprotein and chaperone binding, as well as its presence in multiple import complexes suggest that it plays a central role in the preprotein import apparatus. To examine whether atTic110 has a detectable physiological function, we identified Arabidopsis plants from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory collection (CITATION) carrying a T-DNA insertion (SALK_094678) that disrupts the atTIC110 locus. PCR analysis of the T-DNA/atTIC110 junction established that the insertion disrupted the gene at 40 bp downstream of the start ATG start codon (Figures 2A and 2B). We refer to this line as attic110-1. DNA gel blot analysis gave a single T-DNA hybridizing band in genomic DNA isolated from heterozygous attic110-1 plants that had been digested with two different restriction enzymes, demonstrating that attic110-1 had a single T-DNA insertion in its genome (Figure 2C). [[FIGURE]] PCR analyses of the atTIC110 locus in the progeny of self-crossed attic110-1 plants failed to identify homozygous knockout plants. Furthermore, segregation of the T-DNA–linked kanamycin resistance gene gave a ratio of 62.3% resistance to 37.7% sensitive, a value close to the expected ratio of 67% resistant and 33% sensitive plants if the knockout of atTIC110 was fatal and prevented the production of viable seed. Thus, with a very high probability, the knockout of atTIC110 is not viable. Visual analysis of the siliques of self-crossed heterozygous attic110-1 plants (Figure 2D, left panel) indicated that approximately one-quarter (26.5%) of the seeds failed to develop (Figure 2E). Examination of these embryos by microscopy confirmed that they aborted very early in development before the globular stage of embryogenesis (Figure 2D, right panel). Subsequent to the analysis of the attic110-1 line, we identified a second T-DNA insertion line. The segregation and phenotypic properties of the two lines were indistinguishable (data not shown), confirming that atTIC110 null mutants are lethal. We conclude that disruption of atTIC110 leads to seed abortion during an early state of embryogenesis, confirming that atTic110 is an essential gene in Arabidopsis. Similar results were recently reported by the Jarvis group (CITATION) with independent atTIC110 T-DNA insertion lines. This group also provided evidence that heterozygous atTIC110/attic110 plants accumulated lower amounts of a wide array of plastid proteins and exhibited a noticeable pale phenotype compared with wild-type plants. The phenotype of attic110-1 is consistent with a role for atTic110 in plastid biogenesis, but the lethality of the mutation prevented us from establishing that the defect was specific for protein import. To further analyze the role of atTic110 in vivo, we took advantage of Arabidopsis plants transformed with the atTic110 cDNA fused to a hexahistidine tag (atTic110His) under the control of the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus. Although most transformed plants appeared normal, serious pale phenotypes arose at a relatively high frequency. Some seedlings exhibited uniform albino phenotypes upon germination and eventually arrested in growth and died (Figure 3A, top panel), whereas other plants developed pale sectors at later ages (Figure 3A, bottom panel). [[FIGURE]] We anticipated that silencing of the atTIC110 gene caused the pale/albino phenotype. To confirm this possibility, we immunoblotted proteins from wild-type plants and atTic110His transformed plants exhibiting normal and pale phenotypes with anti-atTic110 serum. In the pale plants, atTic110 protein was at undetectable levels (Figure 3C, lane 2), indicating that the pale phenotype resulted from the reduction in atTic110 expression. Examination of chloroplast ultrastructure in the pale sectors of silenced plants by transmission electron microscopy indicated a strongly reduced content of thylakoid membranes and starch granules compared with wild-type plants (Figure 3B). We conclude that the plastids in the silenced plants fail to develop into normal chloroplasts. The atTic110 silenced plants showed significant reductions in representative nonphotosynthetic proteins (Hsp93 and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit) as well as photosynthetic proteins (protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, 23-kD oxygen evolving complex protein, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase [Rubisco] small subunit protein, and light harvesting complex protein) (Figure 3C; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). All of these proteins are targeted to plastids via transit peptides. By contrast, two outer envelope membrane proteins that are targeted to plastids independent of transit peptides, atToc159 and atToc34, exhibit increased or stable accumulation in the silenced plants, respectively (Figure 3C). The general defect in the accumulation of a wide variety of proteins targeted to the interior compartments of plastids via transit peptides is in agreement with the embryo lethal phenotype of attic110-1 and supports a general role for Tic110 in import across the envelope in both green and nongreen plastids (CITATION). Although the reduction of atTic110 expression is consistent with an essential role in plastid biogenesis, these analyses did not address the specific functions of atTic110 in the import process. In an attempt to examine the molecular basis of atTic110 activity, we generated several atTic110 deletion constructs and expressed these proteins in Arabidopsis. In addition to atTic110His, we generated four constructs, designated as atTic110SolHis, atTic110NHis, atTic110CHis, and atTic110TM–green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B, all of the deletion constructs were successfully expressed in Arabidopsis at levels exceeding authentic atTic110. To examine the proper localization of the constructs, we tested their presence and protease sensitivity in isolated chloroplasts. AtTic110SolHis has previously been shown to localize to the plastid stroma and behave as a soluble protein in Arabidopsis (CITATION). atTic110NHis, atTic110CHis, and atTic110TM-GFPHis all fractionated with isolated chloroplasts, indicating proper targeting of the constructs to the organelle (Figure 4C, lanes 1, 4, and 7). The topology of these proteins in chloroplasts was further confirmed by trypsin treatment of isolated intact chloroplasts. Trypsin can permeate the outer membrane but not the inner membrane of intact chloroplasts (CITATION). All three constructs, as well as native atTic110, were resistant to trypsin treatment, whereas atToc75, an outer membrane component, was digested (Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that all of the deletion constructs were properly targeted to chloroplasts. [[FIGURE]] Plants stably expressing atTic110His, atTic110SolHis, and atTic110TM-GFP exhibited no apparent phenotypes (data not shown), indicating that these constructs do not interfere with the function of endogenous atTic110. By contrast, plants overexpressing either atTic110NHis or atTic110CHis showed significant phenotypes. Seedlings of both lines were markedly pale (Figure 5A). Although the atTic110NHis plants showed a uniformly pale phenotype, plants overexpressing atTic110CHis showed variegated cotyledons (Figure 5A, top panels). The expression of atTic110NHis or atTic110CHis resulted in a significant growth defect, reducing the size of adult plants >50% on soil (Figure 5A). The growth defects and visible phenotypes were not reversed by growing plants on agar plates supplemented with sucrose, indicating that the effects of atTic110NHis or atTic110CHis are not limited to photosynthetic functions. [[FIGURE]] Chloroplasts in the atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis plants exhibited abnormal ultrastructure when examined by transmission electron microscopy. The cotyledons from atTic110NHis plants contain undeveloped plastids similar to proplastids (Figure 5B, cotyledon). In their true leaves, thylakoid membranes are present, but the number of granal stacks is significantly reduced (Figure 5B, true leaf). The plastids in atTic110CHis plants consistently showed underdeveloped granal stacks in sections from cotyledons and true leaves (Figure 5B). The visible phenotypes and disruption of plastid morphology suggest that overexpression of atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis exert dominant negative effects on the function of endogenous atTic110, resulting in the disruption of normal plastid development. To investigate the effects of atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis expression in more detail, we examined the levels of a variety of plastid proteins in these plants. First, we examined the accumulation of representative stromal proteins that are constitutively expressed in plastids or those that represent major components of the photosynthetic machinery specific to chloroplasts. Proteins such as Rubisco small subunit (SSU) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit (PDH-E1α) have been shown to use distinct Toc complexes for import across the outer envelope membrane (CITATION). Remarkably, the levels of all stromal proteins examined were significantly decreased in both atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis expressing lines, with the photosynthetic proteins exhibiting the most dramatic decrease (Figures 6A and 6B; see Supplemental Figure 2A online). The levels of atToc159 were not significantly affected in either line, consistent with the fact that its targeting does not involve a transit peptide (Figures 6A and 6B). These data are consistent with the reduced accumulation of a broad range of stromal proteins in atTIC110 silenced plants and the association of Tic110 with multiple Toc pathways. We conclude that atTic110 plays a general role in transit peptide mediated targeting to the stroma. [[FIGURE]] To test whether the phenotypes of plants expressing atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis result from defects in protein import, we investigated the import efficiencies of plastids isolated from the overexpressing plants. We focused on the import of the precursor to Rubisco SSU (preSSU), a substrate with a high import efficiency in wild-type plants because of the limitation in the yields of plastids from the dominant negative plants. To discriminate between effects on import at the outer and inner membranes, we incubated the plastids with 0.1 mM ATP to promote maximal insertion of preSSU across the outer membrane or 5 mM ATP to promote complete translocation across both outer and inner membranes (CITATION). In the presence of 0.1 mM ATP, the insertion of preSSU across the outer membrane in atTic110NHis or atTic110CHis chloroplasts was virtually unaffected (Figures 7A and 7B). On the basis of these results, we conclude that atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis do not significantly affect the activity of the Toc complex. [[FIGURE]] In the presence of 5 mM ATP, atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis chloroplasts exhibited a dramatic decrease in import capacity. The atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis chloroplasts imported <50% of preSSU compared with the wild-type control (Figures 7A and 7B). The import defect also is apparent in the low levels of import observed in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP (Figure 7A). The import of preSSU under these conditions was 15 and 35% of the levels of the wild type in atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis, respectively (Figure 7B). These data confirm that atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis disrupt translocation at the inner envelope membrane, leading to defects in plastid biogenesis and plant growth. The dominant negative effects of atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis suggest that these proteins are partially functional and therefore inhibit the activity of the Tic complex by competing with authentic atTic110 for molecular interactions that are essential for import. Two such interactions that previously have been confirmed are the association of Tic110 with Hsp93 and Tic40 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To examine these associations, isolated chloroplasts from the atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis lines were treated with the homobifunctional, cleavable cross-linker dithio-bis succinimidyl propionate (DSP) to covalently stabilize the molecular complexes (CITATION; CITATION). The total membrane fractions from these reactions were dissolved with detergent, and the atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis complexes were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA) chromatography. We used chloroplasts from wild-type plants and chloroplasts accumulating atTic110His as negative and positive controls for the chromatography, respectively. Figure 8A demonstrates that all three hexahistidine-tagged constructs are efficiently precipitated by Ni-NTA. The precipitation is selective for the hexahistidine-tagged proteins because authentic atTic110 from wild-type extracts does not bind to the matrix (Figure 8A, lane 5). As expected, Hsp93 and atTic40 copurify with atTic110His (Figure 8A, lane 6). In contrast with atTic110His, Hsp93 and atTic40 are not detected in atTic110NHis or atTic110CHis eluates (Figure 8A, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that both constructs lack the determinants necessary to stably associate with these two proteins. The stromal Hsp70, a protein not associated with Tic complexes (CITATION; CITATION), is not detected in any of the Ni-NTA eluates, indicating that the cross-linking and precipitations are specific (Figure 8A). [[FIGURE]] Overloading of the immunoblots of the atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis eluates reveals the presence of a significant amount of authentic atTic110 that coprecipitates with atTic110NHis (Figure 8A, lane 9). The presence of both hexahistidine-tagged and untagged forms of atTic110 in the precipitate suggests that multiple copies of Tic110 are present in Tic complexes and could account for part of the dominant negative effect of this construct. The ability of atTic110NHis to mimic some critical interactions, such as direct or indirect self-association, but lack the determinants for other interactions, such as binding to atTic40 and Hsp93, could generate disabled Tic complexes that disrupt translocon function. In addition to its interactions with other Tic components, previous studies in pea (Pisum sativum) have shown that a fraction of Tic110 (∼5%) associates with Toc components to form supercomplexes (CITATION). Preproteins trapped in the process of import are enriched in supercomplexes, indicating that they correspond to functional translocons at the envelope (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To examine the ability of atTic110NHis or atTic110CHis to associate with Toc components, we quantitatively immunoprecipitated detergent-solubilized chloroplast membranes from wild-type, atTic110NHis, or atTic110CHis plants with IgG-Sepharose containing antibodies against atToc33, the Arabidopsis Toc34 ortholog. Figure 8B indicates that the three core Toc components, atToc33, atToc75, and atToc159, are efficiently immunoprecipitated by this method (CITATION). As previously demonstrated with pea chloroplasts, a fraction of authentic atTic110 coprecipitates with the Toc components (Figure 8B, lane 4). atTic110NHis also efficiently coimmunoprecipitates with atToc33 (Figure 8B, lane 5), indicating that this mutant possesses the determinants required to associate with Toc components. The amount of atTic110NHis coimmunoprecipitating with atToc33 is substantially higher than authentic atTic110. Previous studies proposed that supercomplex formation is dynamic (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, the increased amounts of atTic110NHis in supercomplexes could result from its relatively high levels of expression or a propensity to get trapped in supercomplexes. The ratio of atTic110NHis to authentic atTic110 in supercomplexes (7.1:1) is similar to the ratio of the two proteins in the total membrane fraction (8.25:1) (Figure 8B, compare lanes 2 and 5), consistent with the idea that assembly of Tic110 into supercomplexes is proportional to its expression level. To confirm this possibility, we examined the relative amounts of authentic atTic110 that coimmunoprecipitate with atToc33 in the line overexpressing atTic110His. As with atTic110NHis, the amount of atTic110His in supercomplexes increases significantly (Figure 8C, compare lanes 3 and 4) and appears to be proportional to its relatively high levels of expression (Figure 8C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4). These observations are consistent with the proposal that the assembly of supercomplexes is dynamic and indicate that the distribution of Tic110 represents an equilibrium situation between supercomplexes and a state that is not associated with Toc components. The ability of atTic110NHis to assemble with Toc components (Figure 8B) and its ability to associate with authentic atTic110 (Figure 8A) raises the possibility that the association of atTic110NHis with authentic atTic110 (Figure 8A, lane 9) might be mediated by supercomplex formation. Indeed, atTic110 is not detected in atTic110NHis eluates from Ni-NTA chromatography of chloroplast membranes that previously had been quantitatively depleted of supercomplexes by anti-atToc33 Sepharose chromatography (Figure 8B, compare lanes 7 and 8). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the association appears to be exclusive to supercomplexes. On the basis of the data in Figure 8, we conclude that additional dominant negative effects of atTic110NHis derive from its ability to associate with Toc complexes and thereby generate inactive or partially active import sites. In contrast with atTic110NHis, low levels of atTic110CHis are detected in the anti-atToc33 immunoprecipitates (Figure 8B, lane 6). The ratio of atTic110CHis to authentic atTic110 in supercomplexes (3:1) is significantly lower than that observed in total membrane fractions (10.3:1) (Figure 8B, compare lanes 3 and 6). It appears that atTic110CHis is less efficient than native atTic110 at assembling into supercomplexes. Nonetheless, the 3:1 ratio of atTic110CHis to atTic110 is likely to be sufficient to interfere with the function of supercomplexes in this line. The results in Figures 6 and 7 indicate that the dominant negative constructs disrupt the import of stromal proteins across the inner envelope membrane. In addition to these soluble proteins, we wished to examine the effects of the deletion mutants on the import and insertion of integral inner envelope membrane proteins. To test these possibilities, we examined the accumulation and membrane association of several envelope membrane proteins in the dominant negative lines. The accumulation of atToc75 in atTic110CHis or atTic110NHis plants was not significantly different from that in wild-type plants (Figures 9A and 9B; see Supplemental Figure 2B online). This is consistent with results from the atTIC110 silenced plants (Figure 3). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the rate of insertion of atToc75 is affected in these lines, the data suggest that the full activity of atTic110 is not required for the targeting and insertion of atToc75. As representative integral inner membrane proteins, we examined the accumulation of atTic40, IEP37, and atTic110 itself in the atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis expressing lines. Although we did not detect a significant effect on atTic40 accumulation, the accumulation of IEP37 and atTic110 was moderately reduced by ∼32 and ∼25% in the two lines, respectively (Figures 9A and 9B; see Supplemental Figure 2B online). [[FIGURE]] The modest effects on the accumulation of IEP37 and atTic110 in the dominant negative lines suggested that the import of these proteins was not severely affected by atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis. Next, we examined the membrane association of the inner membrane markers using alkaline extraction as a measure of membrane integration to test whether they were properly inserted into the inner membrane in the atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis lines. The Rubisco large subunit was used as a control for a soluble protein. As expected, authentic atTic110, atTic40, atToc75, and IEP37 partitioned predominantly with the membrane fraction after alkaline extraction of whole chloroplasts from wild-type plants (Figure 9C, lanes 1 and 2). A similar pattern of distribution was observed in atTic110NHis expressing plants (Figure 9C, lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, the amounts of atTic110CHis and authentic atTic110 in the soluble fraction of the atTic110CHis plants increased significantly (Figure 9C, lanes 5 and 6). In the case of authentic atTic110, we found that ∼40% of the total protein was consistently observed in the soluble fraction compared with <20% in wild-type and atTic110NHis plants (Figure 9D). Approximately 20% of atTic110CHis itself was observed in the soluble fraction (Figure 9C, lane 6). We also observed a slight increase in the levels of atTic40 in the soluble fraction in this line (Figure 9C, compare lanes 2, 4, and 6), but the increase was too small to provide reliable quantitation. We did not observe measurable amounts of soluble IEP37 in the atTic110CHis plants. The displacement of atTic110 to the soluble fraction in atTic110CHis plants suggested that the proper insertion of this component was disrupted in this line. To investigate this in more detail, we examined the rate of inner membrane insertion using an in vitro import assay with in vitro–translated [35S] pre-atTic110 to determine whether or not the rate of insertion was reduced in atTic110CHis mutant chloroplasts. Although both mutants showed a time-dependent accumulation of imported atTic110, the overall levels of atTic110 import were significantly lower than those observed in wild-type chloroplasts (Figures 10A and 10B), consistent with the data in Figure 7. We next measured the fraction of imported [35S] atTic110 that remained soluble during the course of the import assay. The highest levels of the soluble form of imported atTic110 were observed at 2 min and decreased in a time-dependent manner in wild-type chloroplasts (Figures 10C and 10D). A similar pattern was observed in atTic110NHis chloroplasts (Figures 10C and 10D). By contrast, the amount of soluble atTic110 in atTic110CHis chloroplasts continued to accumulate during the import assay and reached a maximum at 20 min (Figures 10C and 10D). These data suggest that the overexpression of atTic110CHis interferes with the proper sorting or insertion of authentic atTic110 to the inner membrane, resulting in its displacement to the stromal fraction. The mislocalization of authentic atTic110 likely makes additional contributions to the dominant negative effects of atTic110CHis. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The atTic110His and atTic110SolHis constructs were identical to the pre-atTic110 and pre-atTic11093-966 constructs, respectively, that were described previously (CITATION). The atTic110NHis and atTic110CHis constructs, corresponding to the regions indicated in Figure 4, were generated by PCR-based cloning. For atTic110TM-GFP, the transmembrane domain of atTic110 was amplified by PCR and inserted into pCL60, a pBluescript SK+–based vector containing GFP (CITATION). All constructs were subcloned into the NcoI and XbaI sites of the pCAMBIA3300.1 binary vector. All these constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana via Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation by the floral dip method (CITATION). The T-DNA insertion line (SALK_094678) in the atTIC110 gene (GenBank accession number AY099850) was identified in silico in the T-DNA collection of the Salk Institute Genome Analysis Laboratory (CITATION) using primers indicated in Figure 2A. Siliques of TIC110/tic110 plants were observed using a dissecting microscope, and embryos were observed by Nomarski optics. Chloroplasts were isolated from 15- to 20-d-old seedlings grown on 0.5× MS plates supplemented with sucrose as described previously (CITATION). Isolated intact chloroplasts were separated into membrane and soluble fractions by lysis in 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, followed by centrifugation at 200,000g for 20 min. The pellets (membrane fraction) were directly dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The soluble proteins were recovered by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and dissolved into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Intact chloroplasts were treated with trypsin as described previously (CITATION). Total protein extracts from Arabidopsis were obtained by directly homogenizing leaves in SDS-PAGE sample buffer unless specified. To avoid proteolytic degradation, the extraction buffer was supplemented with 2000-fold diluted protease inhibitor cocktail for plant cell extracts (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO). Extraction of total proteins from different organs of soil-grown plants was done as described (CITATION). Antisera to atToc159, atToc132, atToc120, atToc75, atToc33, atToc34, SSU, large subunit, and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase were described previously (CITATION). The anti-atTic110 serum was generated to amino acids 370 to 966 of atTic110 that had been expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (CITATION). The light-harvesting complex protein and OE23 antibodies were a generous gift of Kenneth Cline (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). The anti-FtsZ, anti-PDH-E1α, anti-atTic40, and anti-Hsp93 sera were generous gifts of Katherine Osteryoung (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI), Douglas Randall (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO), Hsou-min Li (Academia Sinica, Taiwan, China), and Kenneth Keegstra (Michigan State University), respectively. All immunoblots of atTic110CHis and atTic110CHis expressing plants were performed with extracts obtained from plate-grown plants. The preparation of cotyledons and true leaves from transgenic and wild-type plants for electron microscopy was performed as described previously (CITATION). The grids were observed using a Philips-Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (Hillsboro, OR). [35S]Met-labeled Arabidopsis preSSU and pre-atTic110 were generated in a coupled transcription-translation system containing reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The mixture of preSSU was depleted of free nucleotides by gel filtration as described previously (CITATION). Chloroplast import assays were performed using intact chloroplasts as described (CITATION). For cross-linking, isolated chloroplasts were incubated in the dark for 30 min to deplete internal ATP and reducing potential. The depleted chloroplasts were subsequently incubated with 2.5 mM DSP on ice for 15 min in the dark (CITATION). The reaction was quenched by incubating with glycine at a final concentration of 50 mM on ice for an additional 15 min. For Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions, the total membranes (400 μg of chlorophyll) of DSP cross-linked chloroplasts were solubilized in 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail for 10 min on ice. The solubilized membrane was diluted to 6 M urea in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The denatured extracts were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 30 μL of Ni-NTA resin for 1 h at room temperature. The bound proteins were eluted by SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. To cleave the cross-linker, the samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min in the presence of 100 mM DTT before SDS-PAGE. Immunoaffinity chromatography on anti-atToc33 IgG-Sepharose under native conditions was performed with total membranes (800 μg of chlorophyll) from DSP cross-linked chloroplasts as described previously (CITATION). The eluates and total membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.
