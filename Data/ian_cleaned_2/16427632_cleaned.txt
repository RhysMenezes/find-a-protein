!~ABS~! WNK (with no lysine (K)) protein kinases are found in many eukaryotes and share a unique active site. Here, we report that a member of the Arabidopsis WNK family (AtWNK8) interacts with subunit C of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) via a short C-terminal domain. AtWNK8 is shown to autophosphorylate intermolecularly and to phosphorylate Arabidopsis subunit C (AtVHA-C) at multiple sites as determined by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Furthermore, we show that AtVHA-C and other V-ATPase subunits are phosphorylated when V1-complexes are used as substrates for AtWNK8. Taken together, our results provide evidence that V-ATPases are potential targets of WNK kinases and their associated signaling pathways.
!~RES~! A GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid screen of an Arabidopsis cDNA library with AtVHA-C as the bait protein was performed to identify potential regulators of the V-ATPase. Among the positive clones we identified five independent inserts encoding fragments of the C-terminal domain of AtWNK8. Four unrelated bait proteins were tested and did not show interaction with AtWNK8 thus excluding the possibility of a false positive result (data not shown). In order to evaluate the specificity of this interaction, we searched databases for related proteins of AtWNK8. These searches revealed that the genome of the dicotyledenous model plant Arabidopsis encodes 11 kinases (AtWNK1-11) whereas the monocotyledonous model rice encodes only seven kinases (OsWNK1-7) with the unique lysine placement characteristic of the WNK family. Compared to mammalian WNKs, plant WNKs are much smaller proteins with a predicted molecular weight of about 60–70kDa. With the exception of AtWNK11 and OsWNK5, which consist only of the highly conserved N-terminal kinase domain, all other plant WNKs have a highly divergent C-terminal domain of about 300 amino acids. The only region of conserved sequence found within this domain overlaps with the autoinhibitory domain identified in mammalian WNK1 CITATION (CITATION A). Only a subset of plant WNKs (AtWNK3, 6, 7, 8, 10; OsWNK2, 4) contains a predicted short coiled-coil domain at their extreme C-terminal end, which shows weak similarity to the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of mammalian WNKs. Outside this region, similarity can only be detected between family members that arose from recent duplications (AtWNK6 and 7, 1 and 9, 8 and 10). The coiled-coil domain predicted adjacent to the autoinhibitory segment of mammalian WNKs, as well as the S- and P-rich regions and the SH3-domain binding motifs CITATION are absent from plant WNKs. Size and domain structure of plant WNKs are similar to PkpA CITATION, the first member of the WNK family identified in the filamentous fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Interestingly, the genomes of the unicellular eukaryotes Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Phytophtora sojae and Giardia lamblia do encode WNK kinases. Their size is similar to plant WNKs and the consensus sequence of the potential autoinhibitory segment is conserved (CITATIONB) in some of the WNKs from unicellular organisms. Phylogenetic analysis of kinase domain sequences from all kingdoms (CITATIONC) indicates that the WNKs represent an ancient clade of highly conserved protein kinases that have evolved considerable variability outside their catalytic domains. To determine if the interaction was specific for AtWNK8, the C-terminal domains of the other Arabidopsis WNK family members were cloned into a GAL4-AD vector and tested for interaction with AtVHA-C (CITATION , data not shown for AtWNK6). Neither AtWNK10, the protein most closely related to AtWNK8, nor any other family member was found to interact with AtVHA-C in the yeast two-hybrid system, indicating that the interaction between the two proteins is highly specific. To substantiate the yeast two-hybrid analysis and to determine the interaction domain of AtWNK8, we analyzed the interaction with AtVHA-C in Far-Western experiments. Full length, as well as N- and C-terminal deletion constructs of AtWNK8 fused to GST, was expressed in E. coli (CITATION A). Because wildtype AtWNK8 could not be expressed as a GST-fusion protein, all the constructs used for the interaction studies carried an amino acid exchange (D157A, see below for details). After native purification (CITATIONB), the proteins were slot blotted on to a membrane, which was then incubated with purified AtVHA-C and subsequently probed with an antibody against AtVHA-C. In comparison to GST, which served as a negative control, AtVHA-C was found to bind to full length AtWNK8 (CITATIONC). Strong binding was also detected with both ΔN1 and ΔN2, which consists of the most C-terminal 110 amino acids and includes the predicted coiled-coil domain. Weaker signals that were not clearly different from the background of GST, were detected for the C-terminal deletions. These results confirmed the interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid system and indicated that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain is sufficient for binding of AtWNK8 to AtVHA-C. To test for kinase activity, AtWNK8 was expressed in E. coli. Whereas GST-tagged wildtype AtWNK8 could not be obtained, expression as an intein-fusion protein allowed purification of the native kinase and the two mutants K41M and D157A. K41 corresponds to the essential lysine residue conserved in all WNKs, whereas D157 represents the essential aspartate found in the active center of all protein kinases and both mutants are therefore presumed to be kinase-inactive. In contrast to the purified mutant proteins, the wildtype protein ran at a higher molecular weight (CITATION A). Incubation with [γ-32P]ATP resulted in phosphorylation of wildtype AtWNK8, whereas the two mutants were inactive as expected (CITATIONA), thus demonstrating that AtWNK8 is an active protein kinase that displays autophosphorylation. The GST-fusion proteins used in the Far-Western analysis carried either the D157A mutation, or a deletion of the entire kinase domain and should thus not have kinase activity. We therefore used them as substrates in kinase assays to determine if autophosphorylation of AtWNK8 can take place intermolecularly (CITATIONB). Except for ΔC2, all the kinase-inactive GST-fusions were substrates for phosphorylation by wildtype AtWNK8, indicating that autophosphorylation can take place intermolecularly and is not restricted to the kinase domain of AtWNK8. In contrast to ΔC1, ΔC2 includes the conserved domain that has been shown to be autoinhibitory in mammalian WNKs. The lack of transphosphorylation of ΔC2 along with the reduced autophosphorylation signal of full length AtWNK8 indicates that the autoinhibitory function of this domain is conserved in plants. Having shown that AtWNK8 and AtVHA-C physically interact and that AtWNK8 is an active protein kinase, it remained to be determined if and where AtVHA-C is phosphorylated. Recombinant full length, as well as N- and C-terminally truncated AtVHA-C (134-267), was used as substrate in a kinase assay and was shown to be phosphorylated by AtWNK8 (CITATION A). Tryptic digestion of phosphorylated AtVHA-C followed by MALDI-TOF analysis allowed the identification of six phosphorylated peptides (CITATION , CITATIONB). All peptides contain two or more serine or threonine residues so that individual phosphorylated residues could not be determined. We therefore used a model of AtVHA-C, based on the recently published crystal structure of its yeast homolog VMA5 CITATION, to assess the likelihood of individual residues being phosphorylated by their predicted surface positions. Combined with in silico phosphorylation site predictions CITATION, our results suggest that residues S116, T204, S211, S212, S253, and S331 (CITATIONB) are the most likely sites for phosphorylation of AtVHA-C by AtWNK8. Among the V-ATPase subunits, subunit C is one of the least conserved showing only about 30% sequence identity between yeast and Arabidopsis. Of the potential AtWNK8 target sites, only S211 is conserved in all eukaryotes, whereas all others are only found in a subset of sequences. It was therefore of interest to see if the subunits C from other species are also recognized by AtWNK8. Surprisingly, the AtVHA-C homologs from S. cerevisiae (Vma5p), M. sexta and C. elegans were all phosphorylated by AtWNK8 (CITATION A), however binding of AtWNK8 ΔN2 was only detected for AtVHA-C and weakly for subunit C from C. elegans but not for S. cerevisiae and M. sexta in Far-Western experiments (CITATIONB). We tested whether AtVHA-C could also be phosphorylated when it is integrated into the V1-complex. As it is difficult to isolate sufficient amounts of intact complexes from Arabidopsis, we made use of the fact that V1-complexes lacking subunit C (V1(-C)), can be isolated from the midgut of Manduca larvae CITATION. After incubation with AtVHA-C overnight, the protein complex eluted earlier from the size exclusion column compared with the V1(-C) ATPase – indicating that AtVHA-C was indeed reconstituted into the Manduca V1-complex (data not shown). Aliquots of the gel filtration fractions corresponding to V1(-C), V1(+AtVHA-C) and unbound C were used as substrates in phosphorylation assays with and without AtWNK8 and were subsequently separated by SDS–PAGE (CITATION A). Autoradiography revealed that not only AtVHA-C, but also the Manduca subunits A, G and either B or H, which were not separated after SDS–PAGE due to their similar molecular weights, were phosphorylated (CITATIONB). The control reactions, in which no kinase was added, showed clearly that the detected phosphorylation signals are not due to autophosphorylation or ATP-binding but are dependent on the presence of AtWNK8.
!~MM~! The yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2: GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3: MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-LacZ; Clontech) was used to test interaction between AtVHA-C and the C-terminal sequences of AtWNK1-10. AtVHA-C was PCR-amplified and after sequence analysis cloned into pGBKT7 (BamHI/ PstI). AtWNK 1–5, 7–10 C-termini were amplified by PCR using a Arabidopsis Col-0 cDNA library as template, subcloned for sequence analysis and cloned into pGADT7 vector (Cfr9I/ XhoI). Yeast cells were cotransformed according to standard protocols with bait and prey plasmids and transformants were selected on synthetic dropout plates lacking Trp and Leu. To test for interaction, cells were grown on selective synthetic media lacking Trp, Leu, His and Ade. pEG-AtWNK8 was used for site-directed mutagenesis at position D157 to alanine (D157A) and the mutation verified by DNA sequencing. AtWNK8 FL (full length), ΔN1, ΔN2, ΔC1, ΔC2 were amplified by PCR (template pEG-AtWNK8 D157A) and cloned into pGEX4T3 – translationally fused to an N-terminal GST-tag. Restriction sites used for cloning were BamHI and Bsp120I. A C-terminal His-tag was introduced through the reverse primers. Proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 (BF− dcm, ompT, hsdS ( r B - m B - ) gal λ (DE3)) by GSH-affinity chromatography according to standard protocols. Wildtype and mutant (K41M/ D157A) AtWNK8 was expressed using the IMPACT™-CN system (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, D). The coding sequence (1692 bp) was amplified by PCR using pEG-AtWNK8 or pEG-AtWNK8 D157A as template and cloned into pTYB2 (NdeI/Cfr9I). The mutation K41M was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, using AtWNK8 in pTYB2 as template. Proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21DE3 cells and purified by chitin affinity chromatography. Purification of subunit C from Arabidopsis (AtVHA-C) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Vma5p) was performed as described in CITATION, respectively. The C-subunit of Caenorhabditis elegans (CeVha11) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET28a (BamHI/HindIII). The plasmid for expression of M. sexta V-ATPase C subunit was kindly provided by Prof. H. Wieczorek (University of Osnabrück). Proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli BL21DE3 cells by Ni2+-affinity chromatography according to standard protocols. The integrity of the proteins was tested by Coomassie staining and their concentration measured by Bradford analysis. Proteins were slot blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated in blocking buffer (TBS containing 2% (w/v) protein powder) (1h), and the putative interaction partner was added for >1h in the same buffer (2–10μg/ml). After intensive washing (TBS-T) the interaction was detected by immunostaining of the bound protein using a specific antibody (>1h at RT). Unspecifically bound antibodies were eliminated through washing steps with TBS-T. Membrane was incubated with HRP conjugated goat-anti-rabbit-IgG antibodies (blocking buffer; 1h at RT). Signals were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent (Pierce Perbio, Bonn, D). AtWNK8 kinase (0.05μg) was incubated with 0.3μg substrate for 30min at 30°C in optimized kinase assay buffer (25mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2mM EDTA, and 5mM MnCl2). The ATP concentration was 25μM containing 5μCi [γ-32P]ATP (0.1μM) per reaction. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 140mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 20% Glycerol, 0.01% Bromophenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubating at 95°C for 5min. Samples were separated on SDS–PAGE, and after gel drying exposed on an X-ray screen for 1–2h at RT. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AtVHA-C containing bands were cut from the gel and destained overnight with a solution of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 40% ethanol. The protein was digested in gel with trypsin (Promega) according to Roos et al. CITATION except that the bands had been washed three times with acetonitrile before drying them in a speed vacuum concentrator. Digested samples were desalted with a C18ZipTip (Millipore) and eluted with CHCA (10mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) or FA (8mg/ml 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) matrix solution. 1–2μl of matrix-analyte solution was spotted onto the MALDI plate and allowed to dry. Peptide mass mapping was performed by matrix assisted laser desorption-ionisation/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Bruker Reflex III™ MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). The peptide map was acquired in reflectron positive-ion mode with delayed extraction at a mass range of 500–6000Da. The instrument was calibrated using a calibration mixture (Applied Biosystems). For interpretation of the protein fragments the PEPTIDEMASS CITATION program available at Expasy web site (www.expasy.ch/tools/peptide-mass.html) was used. Megalign (Clustal method) was used for sequence alignments; the phylogenetic tree is a result of a full heuristic distance analysis with 1000 bootstraps replicates in Paup4.0b10.
