!~ABS~! SNF1-related kinases (SnRK1s) play central roles in coordinating energy balance and nutrient metabolism in plants. SNF1 and AMPK, the SnRK1 homologs in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals, are activated by phosphorylation of conserved threonine residues in their activation loops. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) GRIK1 and GRIK2, which were first characterized as geminivirus Rep interacting kinases, are phylogenetically related to SNF1 and AMPK activating kinases. In this study, we used recombinant proteins produced in bacteria to show that both GRIKs specifically bind to the SnRK1 catalytic subunit and phosphorylate the equivalent threonine residue in its activation loop in vitro. GRIK-mediated phosphorylation increased SnRK1 kinase activity in autophosphorylation and peptide substrate assays. These data, together with earlier observations that GRIKs could complement yeast mutants lacking SNF1 activation activities, established that the GRIKs are SnRK1 activating kinases. Given that the GRIK proteins only accumulate in young tissues and geminivirus-infected mature leaves, the GRIK-SnRK1 cascade may function in a developmentally regulated fashion and coordinate the unique metabolic requirements of rapidly growing cells and geminivirus-infected cells that have been induced to reenter the cell cycle.
!~RES~! We first asked if the GRIKs specifically phosphorylate SnRK1 in vitro using recombinant Arabidopsis proteins. For the in vitro kinase assays, we produced wild-type GRIK1 and GRIK2 as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins. We also generated kinase-inactive forms of GRIK1(K137A) and GRIK2(K136A), which carried mutations in their ATP binding sites. The Arabidopsis genome encodes three SnRK1 α-subunit genes, including the functional SnRK1.1 and SnRK1.2 and unexpressed SnRK1.3 (CITATION; CITATION). In this study, we focused on the N-terminal regions of SnRK1.1 (amino acids 1–341) and SnRK1.2 (amino acids 1–342), which include the kinase domains (KDs) and are catalytically active (CITATION). We have designated these truncated proteins as SnRK1.1(KD) and SnRK1.2(KD), respectively. Both proteins include 22 amino acids at their C termini that are in the equivalent position to the AMPKα autoinhibitory region (CITATION; CITATION). However, it is unlikely that these residues are functionally equivalent in SnRK1 and AMPK because of their low sequence identity and lack of similarity in their predicted secondary structures. His6-tagged SnRK1.1(KD, K48A) and SnRK1.2(KD, K49A) were mutated in their ATP binding motifs to inhibit autophosphorylation activity. We also produced His6-tagged, inactive forms of full-length SnRK2.4(K33A) and the SnRK3.11 kinase domain (residues 1–334, K40A) as representatives of the functionally distinct SnRK2 and SnRK3 kinase subfamilies (CITATION). All of the recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli to preclude copurification of potential regulatory partners that are conserved across eukaryotes (CITATION; CITATION). Various combinations of recombinant GRIK and SnRK proteins were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and phosphorylation was monitored by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE and transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. We detected GRIK autophosphorylation in the reactions containing wild-type GRIK1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4) and GRIK2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4) but not in those containing the corresponding kinase-inactive mutants (lanes 5 and 6). Both SnRK1.1(KD, K48A) (lane 1) and SnRK1.2(KD, K49A) (lane 2) were radiolabeled in the presence of wild-type GRIK1 and GRIK2 but not in reactions containing the kinase-inactive GRIKs (lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, 32P-labeling of SnRK2.4(K33A) (lane 3) and SnRK3.11(KD, K40A) (lane 4) in the presence of the wild-type GRIKs was minimal. Together, these results demonstrated that GRIK1 and GRIK2 specifically phosphorylate the SnRK1 kinase domain. [[FIGURE]] SNF1 and AMPK activating kinases phosphorylate a conserved Thr that is located 11 residues upstream of the invariant subdomain VIII Glu in the activation loops of SNF1 and AMPK (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The activation loop sequences of SnRK1 are nearly identical to SNF1 and AMPK, including the conserved Thr residue (Fig. 2A). To determine if the GRIKs phosphorylate this Thr, we substituted Ala residues in place of the Thr residues in SnRK1.1(KD, T175A) and SnRK1.2(KD, T176A). Neither SnRK1 activation loop mutant (lanes 2 and 4) was radiolabeled in kinase assays containing wild-type GRIK1 (Fig. 2B) or GRIK2 (Fig. 2C) and [γ-32P]ATP, even though efficient phosphorylation of SnRK1.1(KD, K48A) (lane 1) and SnRK1.2(KD, K49A) (lane 3) was detected in parallel reactions. [[FIGURE]] We then asked if antibodies that recognize a human AMPKα phospho-T172 activation loop peptide (pT172 antibodies) can cross-react with GRIK-phosphorylated recombinant SnRK1 on immunoblots (Fig. 2D). The pT172 antibodies recognized SnRK1.1(KD, K48A) (compare lanes 1 and 5, and lanes 7 and 11) and SnRK1.2(KD, K49A) (compare lanes 3 and 6, and 9 and 12) after incubation with wild-type GRIKs but not the kinase-inactive forms. The pT172 antibodies also failed to detect SnRK1.1(KD, T175A) (lanes 2 and 8) or SnRK1.2(KD, T176A) (lanes 4 and 10) in reactions containing the wild-type GRIKs. These data established that the GRIKs phosphorylate the conserved Thr in the SnRK1 activation loop. The activation loops of SnRK2 and SnRK3 kinases contain Thr or Ser residues at the equivalent positions to the SnRK1/SNF1/AMPK loops, but the flanking sequences are less conserved (Fig. 2A). We tested three SnRK2.4 and SnRK3.11 activation loop mutants with Ala substitutions in place of the Thr or Ser residues in the GRIK kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP to monitor phosphorylation. SnRK2.4(K33A,S158A) (lane 6), SnRK2.4(K33A, T159A) (lane 7), and SnRK3.11(KD, K40A, T168A, T169A) (lane 9) were weakly labeled in the presence of GRIK1 (Fig. 2B) or GRIK2 (Fig. 2C). However, SnRK2.4(K33A) (lane 5) and SnRK3.11(KD, K40A) (lane 8), which have wild-type activation loop sequences, were also weakly labeled in parallel reactions, indicating that the GRIKs do not phosphorylate the activation loops of SnRK2.4 or SnRK3.11. The specificity of a protein kinase for its substrate is in part reflected by its affinity for the unphosphorylated substrate (CITATION). To investigate GRIK-SnRK1 interactions, we asked if His6-tagged, wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) copurified with GST-tagged GRIK1 or GRIK2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin. When equal molar concentrations of GST-GRIKs and SnRK1.1 were mixed, approximately 20% of the His6-SnRK1.1 was pulled down by the resin in the presence of GST-GRIK1 (Fig. 3, lane 2) or GST-GRIK2 (lane 4), indicating that SnRK1.1 had similar binding affinity for the two GRIKs. In contrast, <2% of His6-SnRK2.4 incubated with GST-tagged GRIK1 (lane 7) or GRIK2 (lane 9) was in the bound fraction. Neither SnRK1.1 nor SnRK2.4 was in the bound fraction in the GST control (lanes 1 and 6). Together, these results showed that the GRIKs form stable complexes with SnRK1.1 but not SnRK2.4 in vitro, consistent with their phosphorylation specificities. Interestingly, both kinase-inactive GRIK1(K137A) and GRIK2(K136A) displayed substantially less binding capacity for SnRK1 (lanes 3 and 5) relative to wild-type GRIKs, suggesting that the GRIK autophosphorylation site and/or the SnRK1 transphosphorylation site is important for the GRIK-SnRK1 interaction. [[FIGURE]] We asked if GRIK-catalyzed phosphorylation of SnRK1 impacts its kinase activity in vitro by examining the activity of His6-tagged, wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) in the presence or absence of functional GRIK. SnRK1.2(KD) was not included in these studies because of technical problems expressing the wild-type recombinant protein in E. coli. Initially, we examined the effect of GRIK1 (Fig. 4A) or GRIK2 (Fig. 4B) on SnRK1.1 activity in reactions containing [γ-32P]ATP by SDS-PAGE. Wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) was labeled in the presence of both wild-type GRIKs (lane 5), but no labeling was seen in reactions with mutant (lane 7) or no GRIK protein (lane 6), indicating that untreated, wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) was not active in the assay. Strikingly, wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) incorporated more label and displayed reduced mobility on SDS gels in comparison to the kinase domain mutant, SnRK1.1(KD, K48A) (compare lanes 4 and 5), indicative of the presence of additional phosphate groups. The extra phosphate groups were not detected for the kinase-inactive SnRK1.1(KD, K48A) (lane 4). Thus, the reduced mobility of wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) was not due to sequential phosphorylation by the GRIKs and, instead, reflected its autophosphorylation activity. SnRK1.1(KD, T175A) was not labeled in the presence of functional GRIKs (lane 3), indicating that phosphorylation of the activation loop is required for SnRK1.1 autophosphorylation. [[FIGURE]] We next used an SnRK1 peptide substrate to measure the magnitude of the effect of GRIK-catalyzed phosphorylation on SnRK1 activity in vitro. The peptide was derived from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) SPS, which is inactivated by SnRK1 phosphorylation (CITATION). Other studies established that the SPS peptide, KGRMRRISSVEMMK, is phosphorylated at S158 (underlined) in a Ca2+-independent manner by SnRK1 purified from spinach (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Using filter binding assays to monitor 32P-labeling of the SPS peptide (Fig. 4C), we detected a low but measureable level of kinase activity for wild-type SnRK1.1(KD) by itself but not for the kinase-inactive SnRK1.1(KD, K48A). The activation loop mutant SnRK1.1(KD, T175A) had trace activity that was lower than its wild-type counterpart. When functional GRIK1 or GRIK2 was included in the reactions, wild-type SnRK1.1 activity was increased 7-fold, while no increase was observed in the reactions containing the kinase-inactive and activation loop mutant forms. Neither GRIK1 nor GRIK2 alone phosphorylated the SPS peptide, and their kinase-inactive forms did not impact wild-type SnRK1 activity. Taken together, these data established that the GRIKs activate SnRK1 by specifically phosphorylating the conserved Thr residue in its activation loop. We examined the biochemical properties of GRIK phosphorylation of SnRK1 using the pT172 antibodies in immunoblot assays. For both GRIK1 and GRIK2, there was no detectable difference in SnRK1.1 phosphorylation in reactions containing Mg2+ and Mn2+ (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). The presence or absence of Ca2+ also had no effect on SnRK1.1 phosphorylation (compare lanes 3 and 4). We detected slight differences in SnRK1.2 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of the various divalent cations, with the highest level occurring in the presence of Mg2+ (lane 5). The 5′-AMP had no detectable effect on GRIK-mediated phosphorylation of SnRK1.1 and SnRK1.2 (Fig. 5B), consistent with previous reports that 5′-AMP enhances SnRK1 activity by inhibiting its dephosphorylation (CITATION). SnRK1.1 and SnRK1.2 phosphorylation levels were also not impacted by 20 μm STO-609 (Fig. 5C), which inhibits CaMKKβ but not LKB1 activity in vitro (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Earlier studies showed that GRIK1 and GRIK2 proteins only accumulate in the SAM and very young leaves (<0.5 cm in length) of healthy Arabidopsis rosette plants and in older leaves of geminivirus-infected plants (CITATION). Using the pT172 antibodies, we detected activated SnRK1 on immunoblots of protein extracts from the SAM and young leaves (Fig. 6A, lane 1) and leaves infected with Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV; Fig. 6B, lane 2). GRIK1 was also detected in these extracts by its antibodies. However, unlike GRIK1, activated SnRK1 was also found in extracts from expanding (Fig. 6A, lane 2), mature (lane 3), and senescing leaves (lane 4). The level of activated SnRK1 was similar in young, expanding, and mature leaves and slightly lower in senescing leaves. There was no detectable difference in the amount of activated SnRK1 in mock versus CaLCuV-infected leaves (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Based on these results, we can conclude that the GRIK accumulation and activated SnRK1 patterns overlap, consistent with the GRIKs acting upstream of SnRK1 in young tissues and during geminivirus infection. Our data also suggested that a protein kinase(s) unrelated to the GRIKs phosphorylates SnRK1 in mature tissues. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Columbia-0 plants were grown in soil at 20°C in a Percival reach-in chamber with 8/16-h light/dark cycle and a light intensity of 15,000 Lux. Leaves at different developmental stages were collected from 6-week-old rosette plants. CaLCuV-infected leaves (0.5–1.5 cm long) were collected 12 d postinoculation from 7-week-old plants agroinoculated with pNSB1090 and pNSB1091, which contain partial tandem copies of CaLCuV A and B DNAs, respectively (CITATION). The mock control was from plants inoculated with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carrying the corresponding empty cloning vector. Protein and RNA extraction procedures have been described previously (CITATION; CITATION). SnRK cDNA clones were obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center stock numbers U24028 (SnRK1.1), U21346 (SnRK1.2), U24136 (SnRK2.4), and U24696 (SnRK3.11). The GRIK1 cDNA clone (CITATION; CITATION) has been described previously. A GRIK2 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from the SAM and young leaves of Arabidopsis Columbia-0 plants (Supplemental Materials and Methods S1). Detailed protocols for plasmid construction are described in Supplemental Materials and Methods S1. Site-directed mutants were generated with Stratagene's QuikChange system using complementary primer pairs containing designed mutations. For expression in Escherichia coli, the cDNAs were amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and cloned into pET16b or pGEX-5X-3 for His6-tagged or GST-tagged proteins, respectively. Proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells after induction by 0.5 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside for 16 h at 16°C. Bacteria were broken by sonication, and the tagged proteins were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) or glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) resins according to manufacturers' instructions. Purified proteins were dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl) and stored in TBS with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 50% glycerol at −20°C. GRIK1 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified recombinant His6-GRIK1 as antigen (Cocalico Biologicals). The IgG fraction was purified using Protein G Sepharose 4B (Sigma-Aldrich). The GRIK2 C terminus peptide antibodies have been described previously (CITATION). The human AMPKα phosphor-T172 peptide polyclonal antibodies (pT172 antibodies), GST polyclonal antibodies, and a His6 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, GE Healthcare, and CLONTECH, respectively. Proteins (50 μL per lane for plant proteins) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for antibody binding. Immunoblots of E. coli-produced proteins were visualized using fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies and an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Immunoblots of plant proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescencent substrate (Pierce). For assays with protein substrates, a 50-μL reaction containing approximately 250 nm of the kinase and the substrate in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.1 μCi/μL [γ-32P]ATP was incubated at 30°C for 20 min. An equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to stop the reaction, and a 40-μL aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography followed by immunoblotting of total proteins on the membrane. When pT172 antibodies were used to assay SnRK1 phosphorylation, only unlabeled ATP was included in the reaction, and phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting. The kinase inhibitor STO-609 was from Sigma-Aldrich. When the plant SPS peptide acetyl-KGRMRRISSVEMMK (GenScript) was used as substrate (CITATION), the reactions were stopped by transferring 40-μL aliquots to P81 filter paper discs, which were rinsed three times with 75 mm H3PO4 and dried. Bound radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. GST-tagged proteins (150 nm) were incubated with His6-tagged proteins (150 nm) in 500 μL TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 22°C for 30 min followed by addition of 20 μL bed-volume of glutathione-Sepharose and incubation for another 30 min with rotation. The resin was washed three times in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound proteins were eluted in 100 μL SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and 40-μL aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using GST and His6 antibodies.
