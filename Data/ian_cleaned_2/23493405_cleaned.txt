!~ABS~! Asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins is an essential cotranslational and posttranslational protein modification in plants. The central step in this process is the transfer of a preassembled oligosaccharide to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Despite the importance of the catalyzed reaction, the composition and the function of individual OST subunits are still ill defined in plants. Here, we report the function of the highly conserved OST subunit OST3/6. We have identified a mutant in the OST3/6 gene that causes overall underglycosylation of proteins and affects the biogenesis of the receptor kinase EF-TU RECEPTOR involved in innate immunity and the endo-β-1,4-glucanase KORRIGAN1 required for cellulose biosynthesis. Notably, the ost3/6 mutation does not affect mutant variants of the receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1. OST3/6 deficiency results in activation of the unfolded protein response and causes hypersensitivity to salt/osmotic stress and to the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Consistent with its role in protein glycosylation, OST3/6 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with other subunits of the OST complex. Together, our findings reveal the importance of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) OST3/6 for the efficient glycosylation of specific glycoproteins involved in different physiological processes and shed light on the composition and function of the plant OST complex.
!~RES~! The pattern recognition receptor EFR senses bacteria through recognition of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) EF-Tu, resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity (CITATION). A forward genetic screen aimed at the discovery of proteins involved in the biogenesis and function of EFR resulted in the identification of elf18-insensitive (elfin) mutants (CITATION; CITATION). One mutant, elfin23-7, was mapped to an approximately 83-kb region on the bottom of chromosome I (Fig. 1A). Sequencing of candidate genes in this region identified a single base pair change (G678A) in the intronless open reading frame of At1g61790, introducing a premature stop codon (Fig. 1B). [[FIGURE]] At1g61790 encodes a 346-amino acid protein with a predicted N-terminal signal peptide, a lumenal domain, and four C-terminal transmembrane helices (Fig. 1D). An amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 1C) and in silico prediction of a conserved membrane protein topology (Fig. 1D; Supplemental Table S2) suggest that At1g61790 encodes a plant homolog of Ost3p/Ost6p, which are known subunits of the yeast OST complex. Consequently, we renamed elfin23-7 as ost3/6-1 and refer to the gene product of At1g61790 as OST3/6. Apart from OST3/6, the Arabidopsis genome contains another intronless gene (At1g11560) coding for a putative ortholog of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p that is here referred to as OST3/6-LIKE1. The amino acid sequence of OST3/6 displays 65% identity (80% similarity) to OST3/6-LIKE1, and the overall protein topology is conserved between OST3/6 and OST3/6-LIKE1. Extraction of data from microarray experiments (CITATION) reveals that OST3/6 is widely expressed in Arabidopsis, and OST3/6 transcript expression correlates well with the expression of other genes coding for OST subunits like STT3A and DAD1 (Supplemental Fig. S1; Supplemental Table S3). In contrast, OST3/6-LIKE1 displays organ-specific expression with low levels in whole seedlings, higher expression levels in stems and stamens, and no clear coexpression with genes for other OST subunits (Supplemental Fig. S2). Measurement of seedling growth inhibition in response to elf18 treatment suggested that the biogenesis and/or the function of the Leu-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) EFR are compromised in the ost3/6-1 mutant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, seedling growth inhibition mediated by flg22 that is recognized by the related LRR-RK FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2; CITATION) was similar to wild-type plants (data not shown), showing that ost3/6-1 is sensitive to flg22 treatment similar to efr-1 and the previously characterized stt3a-2 mutant (CITATION; CITATION). Consistent with this findings, the oxidative burst triggered by elf18 was almost abolished (Fig. 2B), while oxidative bursts triggered by two other PAMPs, flg22 and chitin (recognized by the LysM-RK CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1 [CERK1]; CITATION; CITATION), were not drastically altered (Fig. 2B). To test whether elf18-induced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pto) DC3000 is also affected in ost3/6-1, we pretreated plants with elf18 and investigated the inhibition of pathogen growth. Notably, elf18-induced bacterial resistance was severely impaired in the mutant (Fig. 2C), while pretreatment with flg22 did not alter the growth of Pto DC3000 in ost3/6-1 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the ost3/6-1 mutation led to an increase in susceptibility toward the hypovirulent strain Pto COR− upon spray infection comparable to that caused by loss of EFR (Fig. 2D; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Since EFR is heavily glycosylated (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we hypothesized that N-glycosylation of EFR is altered in the ost3/6-1 mutant, potentially leading to altered accumulation and/or function of EFR. We generated ost3/6-1 efr-1 double mutants expressing GFP-tagged EFR under the control of the native promoter. Immunoblot analysis monitoring the EFR-GFP levels revealed that EFR-GFP accumulation is reduced in independent homozygous ost3/6-1 efr-1/pEFR:EFR-GFP lines when compared with efr-1/pEFR:EFR-GFP (Fig. 2E). These observations show that OST3/6 function is required for EFR biogenesis similar to previously described mutants with defects in glycosylation or ER quality control (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The introduction of a premature stop codon by the ost3/6-1 mutation suggests that a truncated 225-amino acid protein is generated that is not fully functional. Consequently, we hypothesized that a deficiency in OST3/6 causes alterations in protein N-glycosylation leading to protein underglycosylation, a defect that has already been described previously for other Arabidopsis OST subunit mutants (CITATION; CITATION). First, we analyzed the overall N-glycosylation profile of glycoproteins extracted from rosette leaves. The total N-glycan pool was unchanged (Supplemental Fig. S3), showing that the mutant does not affect the biosynthesis or processing of N-glycans. However, SDS-PAGE separation and subsequent immunoblot analysis with antibodies against complex N-glycans revealed an overall reduced signal intensity, indicating the presence of lower amounts of complex N-glycans (Fig. 3A). A lectin blot with concanavalin A, which binds mainly to terminal mannosyl and glucosyl residues of glycoproteins, showed that the mobility of individual bands is altered (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting with protein-specific antibodies demonstrated that the ER-resident protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which harbors two N-glycosylation sites and is commonly used as a reporter to monitor underglycosylation, is not affected in ost3/6-1 (Fig. 3C). By contrast, in the alg10-1 mutant, which is deficient in the last biosynthetic step of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly and consequently displays reduced glycosylation efficiency (CITATION), faster migrating PDI forms were detectable upon SDS-PAGE separation. Another glycoprotein, β-thioglucoside glucohydrolase2 (TGG2), containing four Asn-linked glycans (CITATION), displayed higher mobility in ost3/6-1 compared with the wild type, indicating that TGG2 is hypoglycosylated in ost3/6-1 (Fig. 3D). The restoration of complex N-glycan formation due to reduced or completely impaired glycosylation of a misfolded N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (CGL1-GnTI) protein is another sensitive tool to monitor alterations in glycosylation efficiency in Arabidopsis mutants (CITATION; CITATION). We crossed ost3/6-1 to cgl1 plants and analyzed the generation of complex N-glycans in the ost3/6-1 cgl1 double mutant. Consistent with a role of OST3/6 in the glycosylation of proteins, we detected the restoration of complex N-glycosylation in ost3/6-1 cgl1, which was not observed in ost3/6-1 gntI control plants that contain a gntI null allele instead of the leaky cgl1 allele (Fig. 3E). This finding provides evidence that N-glycosylation site occupancy of CGL1-GnTI is also reduced in the ost3/6-1 genetic background. [[FIGURE]] Underglycosylation caused by genetic lesions or chemical treatment with tunicamycin triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR; CITATION; CITATION). To monitor induction of the UPR in ost3/6-1, we performed quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR and monitored the expression of genes coding for ER-resident proteins that are typically activated during ER stress (CITATION). As for stt3a-2, the expression of genes for binding proteins (At5g28540 [BiP1] and At5g42020 [BiP2]), a calreticulin (At1g09210 [CRT2]), and a PDI (At1g21750 [PDI5]) was significantly increased in ost3/6-1, suggesting that the defect in ost3/6-1 triggers the activation of the UPR (Fig. 3F), similar to STT3A-deficient plants. The deficiency of OST3/6 in ost3/6-1 affects the biogenesis and function of EFR but seems to have little effect on the response mediated by the related heavily glycosylated LRR-RK FLS2. To investigate whether proper OST3/6 function is required for the biogenesis or functionality of mutant variants of the LRR-RK BRI1 (CITATION), we crossed ost3/6-1 to the weak bri1 alleles bri1-9 and bri1-5 and analyzed the suppression or enhancement of the bri1-9 or bri1-5 dwarf phenotype (CITATION). The bri1-9 and bri1-5 plants contain mutant alleles of the BRI1 gene and express structurally altered but still functional BRI1 proteins that are retained in the ER by different quality control processes, including glycan-dependent mechanisms (CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). The ost3/6-1 bri1-9 and ost3/6-1 bri1-5 double mutants were indistinguishable from bri1-9 and bri1-5, revealing that underglycosylation in ost3/6-1 neither rescues the bri1-9/bri1-5 phenotypes nor enhances their growth phenotypes (Fig. 4A). This finding suggests that the mutated BRI1 variants are not substrates of OST3/6. [[FIGURE]] Another candidate protein that is sensitive to alterations in glycosylation is the endo-β-1,4-glucanase KOR1 (CITATION), which plays a yet unclear role during cell wall formation and cellulose synthesis. KOR1 has eight potential glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain, and genetic interactions of the weak KOR1 allele rsw2-1 (CITATION) with different N-glycan-processing mutants indicate that N-glycans play a crucial role for KOR1 (CITATION; CITATION). We analyzed KOR1 expression by immunoblotting in ost3/6-1 and found that KOR1 accumulation is considerably reduced in the mutant (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested if OST3/6 deficiency enhances the phenotype of rsw2-1. In comparison with rsw2-1, the ost3/6-1 rsw2-1 double mutant displayed a severe growth phenotype with very short roots similar to stt3a rsw2-1 (CITATION; Fig. 4C). In summary, our data show that OST3/6 function is required for KOR1 biogenesis, presumably by assisting in the transfer of oligosaccharides to selected KOR1 glycosylation sites. Although the ost3/6-1 plants display a severe underglycosylation defect, these plants do not show any developmental or morphological phenotype under normal growth conditions (Fig. 4A). Underglycosylation mutants are frequently more sensitive to salt stress and tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Germination of ost3/6-1 on medium containing 120 mm NaCl (Fig. 5A) resulted in decreased root growth. Increased sensitivity to NaCl was also observed when 6-d-old seedlings were transferred to Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 120 mm NaCl and grown for an additional 14 d (Fig. 5B). These effects were even more pronounced under higher salt concentrations (Supplemental Fig. S4). When ost3/6-1 was grown for 2 weeks on MS medium supplemented with 350 mm mannitol, swelling of roots and enhanced lateral root formation were observed (Fig. 5C). Transfer of 6-d-old ost3/6-1 seedlings to MS plates containing 0.5 µg mL−1 tunicamycin resulted in the formation of an increased number of pale seedlings (Fig. 5D). A germination assay confirmed that ost3/6-1 is much more sensitive to tunicamycin than wild-type and alg10-1 plants (Fig. 5E). [[FIGURE]] In a previous study, it was found that the lew3 mutant, which displays underglycosylation of proteins due to a defect in the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide precursor, is more sensitive to NaCl, tunicamycin, and abscisic acid (ABA; CITATION). To investigate differences in ABA sensitivity, we performed a germination assay in the presence of two different ABA concentrations. In contrast to lew3, ost3/6-1 germination was not impaired by ABA (Supplemental Fig. S4). We could not identify additional ost3/6 alleles in our forward genetic screen, and there are no OST3/6 transfer DNA knockout mutants available to corroborate that the detected phenotypes are caused by OST3/6 deficiency. To confirm that the observed phenotypes are indeed caused by the molecular lesion in ost3/6-1, we expressed OST3/6-GFP under the control of its native promoter in ost3/6-1. Immunoblot analysis using anti-TGG2 antibody revealed that the underglycosylation defect was restored in the ost3/6-1/pOST3/6:OST3/6-GFP transgenic plants (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this finding, the transgenic seedlings were as tolerant to increased salt concentrations as wild-type plants (Fig. 6B), and elf18-induced seedling growth inhibition was triggered in ost3/6-1 expressing pOST3/6:OST3/6-GFP (Fig. 6C). Restoration of TGG2 glycosylation was also observed when OST3/6-GFP was expressed under the control of the ubiquitin10 gene promoter in ost3/6-1 (Supplemental Fig. S5). By contrast, expression of neither pOST3/6-LIKE1:OST3/6-LIKE1-GFP (Fig. 6A) nor pUBQ10:OST3/6-LIKE1-GFP (Supplemental Fig. S5) in ost3/6-1 resulted in the compensation of the TGG2 glycosylation defect. It is interesting that no OST3/6-LIKE1-GFP could be detected in these transgenic lines by immunoblotting, suggesting that OST3/6-LIKE1-GFP is not properly expressed at all or is highly unstable compared with OST3/6. [[FIGURE]] To analyze the molecular defect caused by the ost3/6-1 mutation in more detail, we performed qRT-PCR analysis. OST3/6 transcript levels were clearly reduced in seedlings and leaves (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the nonsense mutation in ost3/6-1 leads to OST3/6 mRNA decay. To assess whether the truncated protein can be produced in plants, we generated a construct where the 225-amino acid OST3/6-1 protein is fused to GFP and transiently expressed the OST3/6-1-GFP fusion protein in Nicotiana benthamiana. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against GFP confirmed the stable production of the truncated variant when expressed under the control of heterologous regulatory sequences (Fig. 7B). Next, we tested whether the topology of OST3/6-1 is altered due to the absence of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1C). To this end, we analyzed the glycosylation status of OST3/6 and OST3/6-1. OST3/6 contains a single N-glycosylation site at position Asn-108 in the large lumenal domain that is also present in OST3/6-1. Digestion with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) caused shifts in mobility upon SDS-PAGE separation, indicative of OST3/6 glycosylation with an oligomannosidic N-glycan (Fig. 7C). The presence of Endo H-sensitive glycoforms revealed that the large N-terminal domain of OST3/6-1 is also facing the ER lumen, demonstrating that the protein topology is not altered due to the protein truncation (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the presence of an oligomannosidic N-glycan further indicates that the truncated variant is like OST3/6 retained in the ER and not processed by Golgi-located glycosylation enzymes. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that OST3/6-1-GFP is predominantly located in the ER when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana (Fig. 7D). Together, these findings suggests that the reduced mRNA levels in ost3/6-1 contribute significantly to the observed OST3/6 deficiency, while the distinct role of the C-terminal domain with three additional transmembrane helices for OST3/6 function remains elusive. [[FIGURE]] A role of OST3/6 in protein glycosylation suggests that it localizes to the ER. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed transgenic ost3/6-1/pOST3/6:OST3/6-GFP plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, the fluorescence intensity was quite low, and no distinct subcellular location could be seen. Consequently, we expressed transiently the GFP-tagged OST3/6 protein under the control of the UBQ10 promoter in N. benthamiana leaves. Analysis of the OST3/6-GFP fusion protein by confocal microscopy of epidermal cells revealed a reticular distribution pattern resembling ER localization (Fig. 8A). To confirm this finding, we coexpressed OST3/6-GFP with GnTI-CaaaTS-monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP), which carries a mutated form of the Golgi-marker GnTI and localizes mainly to the ER (CITATION). In addition, we performed colocalization experiments with other tagged OST subunits like STT3A-mRFP and Arabidopsis OST4B-mRFP, a putative ortholog of yeast Ost4p (Fig. 8, B and C). All of the expressed proteins displayed ER-like labeling and colocalization with OST3/6-GFP, consistent with a possible function of OST3/6 as an OST subunit in the ER (Fig. 8, D–F). [[FIGURE]] In yeast, it has been proposed that Ost4p acts as a bridge and mediates the interaction of Ost3p with the catalytic subunit Stt3p (CITATION). In addition, Ost4p was found to regulate the recruitment of either Ost3p or Ost6p into two distinct yeast OST subcomplexes (CITATION). To further investigate whether OST3/6 is part of such a complex and interacts with other OST subunits, we transiently coexpressed OST3/6-GFP with tagged forms of STT3A (STT3A-HA) and OST4B (OST4B-mRFP) in N. benthamiana leaves and performed coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. In our first Co-IP experiment, we coexpressed STT3A-HA with OST4B-mRFP. Immunoblotting revealed the copurification of STT3A-HA (Fig. 9A). In subsequent experiments, we observed the binding of OST3/6-GFP to STT3A-HA (Fig. 9B) and the interaction of OST3/6-GFP with OST4B-mRFP (Fig. 9, C and D). Notably, the interaction is not compromised when the truncated OST3/6-1-GFP form is coexpressed instead of OST3/6 (Supplemental Fig. S6). In summary, our data suggest that OST3/6 is part of an OST3/6-OST4B-STT3A subcomplex that has been described previously in yeast (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and Nicotiana benthamiana were grown under long-day conditions (16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod) at 22°C and 24°C, respectively, as described previously (CITATION). The mutants alg10-1, alg10-1 gntI, alg10 cgl1 (CITATION), gntI (CITATION), stt3a-2 (CITATION), cgl1 (CITATION), efr-1 (CITATION), fls2c efr-1 (CITATION), rsw2-1 (CITATION), bri1-9, and bri1-5 (CITATION) are all available from previous studies (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Tunicamycin, ABA, and other chemicals for seedling germination and growth assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Screening of elfin mutant plants was performed as described in detail previously (CITATION). To identify the ost3/6-1 (elfin23-7) mutation, elfin23-7 plants in the ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) background were crossed to wild-type plants of the Landsberg erecta ecotype. Genomic DNA from elfin23-7 seedlings in the segregating F2 population was extracted and used for subsequent PCR analysis. The mutation was mapped to the bottom of chromosome I using a combination of simple sequence length polymorphism markers generated by comparing the Monsanto Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta Sequence Collection (http://www.arabidopsis.org/browse/Cereon/index.jsp) with the Col-0 sequence and markers from the Arabidopsis Mapping Platform (http://amp.genomics.org.cn/). The flg22 and elf18 peptides were purchased from Peptron, and chitin was purchased from Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry. Seedling growth inhibition, oxidative burst, and infection assays were performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). In brief, for the bacterial infection assays, Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strains were grown overnight on solid L medium, and bacteria were then scraped off and dissolved in 10 mm MgCl2. The suspensions were adjusted to optical density at 600 nm (OD600) = 0.2 and diluted to OD600 = 0.02 (for spray-infection assays) and OD600 = 0.0002 (for induced-resistance assays). For the spray-infection assays, 0.4 µL mL−1 Silwet L-77 was added, and the sprayed plants were kept under high humidity for 3 d. For the induced-resistance assays, bacteria were syringe infiltrated using a needleless syringe into leaves either preinfiltrated with water or 1 µm PAMP for 24 h. Four-week-old short-day-grown plants were used for both assays. Plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen using a mixer mill, resuspended in 10 µL of phosphate-buffered saline per mg of plant material, and centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, denatured at 95°C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Protein gel blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The membranes were probed with anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; CITATION), anti-PDI (CITATION), anti-TGG2 (CITATION; kindly provided by Ikuko Hara-Nishimura), and anti-KOR1 antibodies (generated by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide CSGEEEATGKIDKNT; Genscript). Endo H (New England Biolabs) and PNGase F (New England Biolabs) digestions were done as described in detail recently (CITATION). The ost3/6-1 efr-1/pEFR:EFR-eGFP-HA lines were generated by crossing ost3/6-1 with efr-1/pEFR:EFR-eGFP-HA (CITATION). Immunoblot detection of EFR-GFP was performed as described previously (CITATION) with HRP-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (Insight Biotechnology). RNA was extracted from 35 mg of 7-d-old seedlings grown on 0.5× MS medium supplemented with 1.5% Suc or from 35 mg of leaves from soil-grown 4-week-old plants using the SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 2 µg of extracted RNA in a total volume of 40 µL using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Primers for quantitative PCR are listed in Supplemental Table S4. cDNA was quantified using iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) with an iCycler (Bio-Rad). The cycle threshold values were calculated using CFX Manager 2.1 software (Bio-Rad), and the relative expression values were determined using UBQ5 gene expression as a reference and the comparative cycle threshold method (CITATION). PCR was done at least twice, and at least three independent biological experiments were performed. Significant differences between wild-type and mutant genotypes were tested using a two-tailed Student’s t test (Graphpad Software). The full-length OST3/6 coding sequence including the promoter region was cloned in a two-step process into the binary expression vector p20F (CITATION). First, the OST3/6 promoter and part of the 5′ coding region were amplified using oligonucleotides At1g61790_5F and At1g61790_6R, and the PCR product was HindIII/BamHI digested and cloned into HindIII/BamHI-digested p20F. In the second cloning step, the OST3/6 coding region was amplified with At1g61790_1F and At1g61790_7R, SacI and BamHI digested, and cloned into the SacI/BamHI-digested p20F vector containing the OST3/6 fragment from the first cloning step. The resulting binary expression vector was designated pOST3/6:OST3/6-GFP. The corresponding pOST3/6-LIKE1:OST3/6-LIKE1-GFP construct was generated by PCR amplification of the OST3/6-LIKE1 promoter and coding sequence using At1g11560_3F and At1g11560_4R. The resulting PCR product was HindIII/BamHI digested and cloned into p20F. For the pUBQ10:OST3/6-GFP construct, the full-length OST3/6 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using At1g61790_3F and At1g61790_7R, BamHI digested, and cloned into BamHI-digested vector p40. Binary expression vector p40 is derived from p20F by replacing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter with the Arabidopsis ubiquitin10 promoter (CITATION). The vector for expression of the truncated OST3/6-1 fused to GFP was generated by PCR amplification using the primers At1g61790_3F and At1g61790_10R. The PCR product was BamHI digested and cloned into BamHI-digested p20F. The pUBQ10:OST3/6-LIKE1-GFP construct was generated by PCR amplification of the full-length OST3/6-LIKE1 coding sequence using primers At1g11560_11F and At1g11560_4R. The PCR product was XbaI/BamHI digested and cloned into XbaI/BamHI-digested p40. All binary vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain UIA143 as described previously (CITATION). The constructs for the expression of STT3A-mRFP and STT3A-HA were generated by PCR amplification of the STT3A coding region from Arabidopsis cDNA using primers STT3A_1F and STT3A_2R. The PCR product was subcloned, excised from the cloning vector by XbaI/BamHI digestion, and ligated into XbaI/BamHI-digested binary expression vector p31 (mRFP fusion) and vector p60 for the expression of a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged protein (CITATION). The binary expression vector for OST4B-mRFP was generated by PCR amplification of the OST4B coding region from Arabidopsis cDNA using primers At5g02502_3F and At5g02502_4R. The PCR product was XbaI/BamHI digested and cloned into p31. Transient expression in N. benthamiana was done by infiltration of leaves as described previously (CITATION). For coexpression experiments, resuspended agrobacteria were diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 for OST3/6-GFP, an OD600 of 0.05 to 0.10 for STT3A-mRFP, an OD600 of 0.05 for OST4B-mRFP, an OD600 of 0.05 for the ER marker protein GnTI-CaaaTS-mRFP, and an OD600 of 0.03 for OST3/6-1-GFP. Sampling and imaging of fluorescent proteins were performed 2 d after infiltration using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope as described in detail recently (CITATION). Postacquisition image processing was performed in Adobe Photoshop CS. Transient expression of fluorescent protein fusions was performed by infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves as described previously (CITATION). For coexpression experiments, resuspended agrobacteria were diluted to an OD600 of 0.2 for OST3/6-1-GFP, OST4B-mRFP, and OS9-mRFP (CITATION), OD600 of 0.3 for OST3/6-GFP, and OD600 of 0.4 for STT3A-HA. One gram (fresh weight) of infiltrated leaf tissue (for purification of STT3-HA, 2 g of infiltrated leaves was used due to lower expression levels of STT3-HA) was harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder using a mixer mill, and resuspended in 3 mL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma) supplemented with 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The samples were placed on ice for 30 min with mixing every 10 min. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 3,500g for 7.5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was centrifuged again for 7.5 min at 7,800g at 4°C and finally at 11,600g for 7.5 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was discarded, and the cleared supernatant (referred to as “total”) was diluted with 2× dilution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail. To equilibrate the GFP-Trap-A or RFP-Trap-A beads (Chromotek), 25 µL of slurry was resuspended in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and spun down at 600g for 1 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the washing step was repeated twice. The beads were resuspended with 500 µL of ice-cold dilution buffer and transferred to the protein extracts followed by an incubation step with end-over-end mixing for 1 h at 4°C. The samples were centrifuged at 400g for 3 min at 4°C, and the beads were washed three times with dilution buffer. In a fourth wash step, the salt concentration in the dilution buffer was increased to 250 mm NaCl. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 90 µL of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, loaded onto Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad), and boiled for 5 min at 95°C. The eluate was again loaded onto Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns and boiled for 5 min at 95°C. Eluted proteins (referred to as “IP:RFP-Trap” or “IP:GFP-Trap”) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. For the detection of GFP fusion proteins anti-GFP (MACS Miltenyi Biotec), for mRFP-tagged fusion proteins anti-RFP (5F8; Chromotek), and for HA-tagged proteins anti-HA (Roche) antibodies were used.
