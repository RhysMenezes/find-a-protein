!~ABS~! A possible MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade of Arabidopsis thaliana was identified on the basis of both yeast 2-hybrid analysis and complementation analysis of yeast mutants. Specific protein-protein interactions between ATMPK4 (a MAPK) and MEK1 (a MAPKK) and interactions between MEK1 and ATMEKK1 (a MAPKKK) were detected by using the 2-hybrid system. A growth defect of the yeast mpk1Δ mutant was reversed by coexpression of ATMPK4 and MEK1. Coexpression of the N-terminal deletion form of ATMEKK1 increased the ability of MEK1 to suppress a growth defect of the yeast pbs2Δ mutant. These results suggest that ATMPK4, MEK1, and ATMEKK1 may interact with each other and constitute a specific MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis. This is the first demonstration of a possible MAPK cascade in plants.
!~RES~! We have already isolated 9 cDNAs for Arabidopsis MAPKs CITATION. Based on their amino acid sequences, they can be classified into 4 subgroups: group 1 (ATMPK1, ATMPK2, and ATMPK7), group 2 (ATMPK3 and ATMPK6), group 3 (ATMPK4 and ATMPK5) and group 4 (ATMPK8 and ATMPK9) CITATION. For this study we chose 4 MAP kinases, ATMPK1, ATMPK3, ATMPK4, and ATMPK8, one from each subfamily. To test which ATMPKs interact with MEK1, we constructed vectors to express ATMPKs and MEK1 fused to the LexA binding domain (LBD), VP16 activation domain (VAD), and Gal4 activation domain (GAD) in the tester strain, L40. CITATION summarizes the protein-protein interactions between MEK1 and the ATMPKs tested in this study. As shown in CITATION, interaction between ATMPK4 and MEK1 was detected, based on both growth on His-lacking medium and β-galactosidase activity. Although the LBD-ATMPK4 itself had relatively high background activity of both growth on His-lacking medium and β-galactosidase activity, when coexpressed with MEK1 this background activity decreased. A protein-protein interaction between ATMPK4 and MEK1 might cause conformational change of the LBD-ATMPK4 fusion, and might result in a decrease in the background activity. We also detected positive interaction between GAD-ATMPK4 and LBD-MEK1 (CITATION). We did not detect interactions between MEK1 and other Arabidopsis ATMPKs (ATMPK1, ATMPK3, and ATMPK8) or X. laevis MPK1 CITATION. These results suggest that MEK1 interacts specifically with ATMPK4. Interaction between ATMEKK1 and MEK1 was detected, based on both growth on His-lacking medium and β-galactosidase activity (CITATION). Neither MEK1 nor ATMEKK1 fusion proteins interacted with VAD or LBD proteins, which were used as controls. We did not detect interactions between MEK1 and a mammalian MAPKKK, Raf, or between ATMEKK1 and a yeast MAPKK, Ste7. These results suggest that ATMEKK1 may interact specifically with MEK1. Arabidopsis MAPKs (ATMPKs) are 40–46% identical in amino acid sequences to S. cerevisiae MPK1 CITATION. Expression of Xenopus MAPK suppressed the defect associated with loss of S. cerevisiae MPK1 CITATION. This suggests that ATMPKs might be able to complement the yeast mpk1 mutant. To test this, cDNAs for ATMPK1, ATMPK3, ATMPK4, and ATMPK8 were transformed into the mpk1 mutant (DL456). We constructed high-copy-number plasmids (pNV7-ATMPKs) in which cDNAs encoding ATMPKs are expressed under the control of the galactose-inducible yeast GAL7 promoter CITATION. The mpk1 mutant cannot grow at 37°C without 1 M sorbitol CITATION. Therefore, the ability of ATMPKs to complement the growth defect associated with the mpk1Δ::TRP1 allele (in strain DL456) was tested on galactose-containing medium at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1 M sorbitol. Expression of the ATMPKs did not complement the growth defect (data not shown). Two-hybrid analysis suggested that MEK1 (MAPKK) may interact with ATMPK4 (MAPK). Therefore we next examined whether MEK1 can activate ATMPK4 in S. cerevisiae (CITATION ). When the mpk1 mutant cells were transformed with both ATMPK4 and MEK1, they were able to grow at the restrictive temperature. However, coexpression of MEK1 and 3 other ATMPKs (ATMPK1, ATMPK3, and ATMPK8) did not complement this defect. These results suggest that MEK1 not only interacts with but also may activate ATMPK4, at least in S. cerevisiae CITATION. Arabidopsis MEK1 is 36–41% identical in amino acid sequence to members of the MAPKK family from yeasts and animals CITATION. Expression of rat SEK (MAPKK) suppressed the defect associated with the loss of S. cerevisiae PBS2 CITATION. This suggests that MEK1 might be able to complement defects in yeast MAPKK mutants, such as ste7, mkk1/mkk2, and pbs2. To test this, MEK1 cDNA was transformed into the pbs2 mutant (TM334) (CITATION ). We constructed high-copy-number plasmids (YEp51-MEK1) in which cDNA encoding MEK1 is expressed under the control of the GAL7 promoter CITATION. The mutant cannot grow at 30°C in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl. Therefore the ability of MEK1 to complement the growth defect of the pbs2Δ cells was tested on galactose-containing medium in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl. The pbs2 mutant cells expressing MEK1 could grow in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl (CITATIONE) but not in the presence of 0.9 M NaCl (CITATIONF). Two-hybrid analysis suggested that ATMEKK1 may interact with and activate MEK1 (CITATION). Therefore, we then examined whether ATMEKK1 could increase the ability of MEK1 to complement the pbs2 defect. When the pbs2 mutant cells were transformed with both MEK1 and ATMEKK1ΔN (the N-terminal deletion form of ATMEKK1), they could grow even in the presence of 0.9 M NaCl (CITATIONF). ATMEKK1WT (the full-length form of ATMEKK1) did not increase the ability of MEK1 to complement the pbs2 defect under the same conditions (CITATIONF). Coexpression of MEK1 and ATMEKK1 (or ATMEKK1ΔN) did not complement the ste7 or mkk1/mkk2 mutant defects (data not shown). These results suggest that ATMEKK1 not only interacts with but also may activate MEK1, at least in S. cerevisiae CITATION, and that deletion of the N-terminal regulatory domain of ATMEKK1 may activate kinase activity, like other MAPKKKs such as Ste11, Bck1, Raf, and Ssk2 CITATION.
!~MM~! The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were L40 CITATION, 1788 CITATION, DL456 CITATION, TM222 CITATION, and TM334 CITATION. Escherichia coli strains XL-1 and JM109 were used for propagation of plasmid DNAs. Yeast strains were grown on YPD medium containing 2% glucose, 2% Bacto Peptone (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), 1% Bacto Yeast Extract (Difco), and 0.04% adenine sulfate. Yeast transformations were done by the lithium acetate method CITATION. Transformants were selected on SD medium containing 2% glucose and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), supplemented with amino acids when required. Standard yeast genetic manipulations were performed as described previously CITATION. Standard molecular biological techniques were used for plasmid construction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequencing CITATION. The plasmid vectors used for the yeast 2-hybrid analyses were pVP16 CITATION, pBTM116 CITATION, and pGAD424 (Clontech). PCR was used to generate fragments of the coding sequences of ATMPK1 CITATION, ATMPK3 CITATION, ATMPK4 CITATION, ATMPK8 CITATION, MEK1 CITATION, ATMEKK1 CITATION, Fus3 CITATION, Ste7 CITATION, and Xenopus MPK1 CITATIONcompatible for cloning into the vectors. The plasmid vectors used for complementation analyses were YEpGAP112 CITATION, pNV7 CITATION, and YEp51 CITATION. The DNA fragments of the coding sequences of ATMPK1 CITATION, ATMPK3 CITATION, ATMPK4 CITATION, ATMPK8 CITATION, MEK1 CITATION, ATMEKK1 CITATION, and ATMEKK1ΔN (encoding residues 288–608) were subcloned into the vectors. For qualitative assays, cotransformed yeast colonies were plated on the same selective medium to test for protein interaction. The test used a β-galactosidase activity assay on a filter with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) or growth in the absence of histidine in medium containing 5–30 mM 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). For quantitative assays, cells of each transformant were cultured in medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by the o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay method CITATION. The yeast mpk1Δ mutant DL456 CITATIONwas transformed with 2 plasmids, one containing MAPKs (ATMPKs CITATION), the other containing a MAPKK (MEK1 CITATION), and transformants carrying both plasmids were selected. Complementation analyses were performed as described previously CITATIONwith minor modifications. The pbs2Δ mutant TM334 CITATIONwas transformed with 2 plasmids, one containing MEK1 MAPKK CITATION, the other containing ATMEKK1 MAPKKK CITATION, and transformants carrying both plasmids were selected. Complementation analyses were performed as described previously CITATIONwith minor modifications.
