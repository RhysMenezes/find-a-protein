!~ABS~! Floral transition in plants is regulated by an integrated network of flowering genetic pathways. We show that an Arabidopsis PIN1-type parvulin 1, Pin1At, controls floral transition by accelerating cis/trans isomerization of the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in two MADS-domain transcription factors, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) and AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24). Pin1At regulates flowering, which is genetically mediated by AGL24 and SOC1. Pin1At interacts with the phosphorylated AGL24 and SOC1 in vitro and with AGL24 and SOC1 in vivo and accelerates the cis/trans conformational change of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs of AGL24 and SOC1. We further demonstrate that these Ser/Thr-Pro motifs are important for Pin1At function in promoting flowering through AGL24 and SOC1 and that the interaction between Pin1At and AGL24 mediates the AGL24 stability in the nucleus. Taken together, we propose that phosphorylation-dependent prolyl cis/trans isomerization of key transcription factors is an important flowering regulatory mechanism.
!~RES~! To investigate the biological function of Pin1At, we first examined the effect of modulating Pin1At expression in Arabidopsis. Since insertion mutants were not available in public resources, transgenic plants with antisense suppression of Pin1At were generated. Among 56 transgenic lines containing Pin1At N-terminal antisense fragment driven by a double cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Pin1At-AS), 30 plants showed late flowering under long days (LDs) (Figures 1Figures 1A and 1B). Under both long and short days (SDs), representative Pin1At-AS plants with reduced expression of Pin1At flowered much later than wild-type plants (Figures 1Figures 1E, 1F, and S2S2A). On the contrary, among 39 transgenic plants containing Pin1At cDNA under the control of 35S promoter (35S:Pin1At), 21 showed early flowering under LDs (Figures 1Figures 1C and 1D). Representative 35S:Pin1At lines with overexpression of Pin1At showed early flowering under both LDs and SDs (Figures 1Figures 1E, 1F, and S2S2B). In addition, these plants also exhibited serrated rosette and cauline leaves (Figure 1Figure 1D). These observations suggest that Pin1At at least affects flowering and leaf development. [[FIGURE]] To examine the flowering pathways that regulate Pin1At, we examined its expression in various environmental conditions and flowering mutants. In wild-type Col plants under LDs, Pin1At expression gradually increased during floral transition occurring from 9 to 13 days after germination (Figure 2Figure 2A) and decreased afterwards. On the contrary, its expression was not significantly changed under SDs within 21 days after germination. These results suggest that the photoperiod pathway affects Pin1At expression. Further examination of Pin1At expression revealed that its expression was affected by CONSTANS (CO), but not FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) (Figure S3Figure S3). Pin1At expression was also affected by vernalization (Figure 2Figure 2B), but not by autonomous pathway mutants and GA treatment (Figures S4 and S5Figures S4 and S5). Notably, dramatic downregulation of a flowering repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), in FRI FLC, wherein the dominant allele of FRIGIDA (FRI) causes high expression of FLC by vernalization, did not enhance the upregulation of Pin1At (Figure 2Figure 2B), indicating that vernalization regulates Pin1At in an FLC-independent manner. Regulation of Pin1At by the vernalization pathway partly explains that manipulation of Pin1At expression affects flowering time in SDs, under which the LD photoperiod pathway is not activated. [[FIGURE]] Since the photoperiod and vernalization pathways converge on the regulation of Pin1At expression, we speculated that Pin1At function may be relevant to flowering regulators located downstream of several genetic pathways, such as SOC1, FT, and AGL24 (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). Thus, we performed genetic crossing to identify potential interacting regulators of Pin1At. While downregulation of Pin1At in Pin1At-AS caused late flowering, it did not affect early flowering conferred by constitutive expression of CO and FT (Figure 1Figure 1G). On the contrary, early flowering of 35S:SOC1 and 35S:AGL24 was delayed in Pin1At-AS background (Figure 1Figure 1G). These observations imply that promotion of flowering by SOC1 and AGL24 is partially dependent on Pin1At. We further crossed 35S:Pin1At with several late-flowering loss-of-function mutants (Figure 1Figure 1H). 35S:Pin1At promoted flowering in co-1 mutants, indicating that Pin1At could act downstream of or in parallel with CO. Comparatively, 35S:Pin1At only slightly promoted flowering in soc1-2 and agl24-1 mutants. In particular, early flowering of 35S:Pin1At was completely suppressed by soc1-2 agl24-1 (Figure 1Figure 1H), suggesting that 35S:Pin1At function is mediated by AGL24 and SOC1. We further found that the mRNA expression of AGL24 and SOC1 was not affected by suppression or overexpression of Pin1At (Figure S6Figure S6A). Pin1At mRNA expression was also not significantly affected by AGL24 and SOC1 (Figure S6Figure S6B). These observations demonstrate that Pin1At and flowering time regulators SOC1 and AGL24 are mutually dependent for their function in flowering, which is, however, not mediated by mutual transcriptional regulation. Pin1At mRNA was expressed in all the tissues examined, with the highest expression in cauline and rosette leaves (Figure S7Figure S7). Pin1At transcripts were localized in the shoot apical meristem during the floral transition (Figures 2Figures 2C and 2D) and later in the inflorescence shoot apical meristem and emerging floral meristems (Figures 2Figures 2E and 2F). Expression of AGL24 and SOC1 was also shown to be upregulated in the shoot apical meristem during the floral transition (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION), which is concomitant with the Pin1At expression, indicating that they could interact to control flowering time. We then investigated the subcellular localization of Pin1At by Arabidopsis protoplast transfection assay using a fusion construct of Pin1At-GFP. Like 35S:GFP, Pin1At-GFP localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figures 2Figures 2Gâ€“2J), implying that Pin1At may exert its function in multiple cell organelles. To investigate whether AGL24 and SOC1 interact with Pin1At, we first tested their phosphorylation status, because PIN1-type isomerases bind only to phosphorylated substrates (CITATION, CITATION). Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from 35S:AGL24-6HA, where AGL24-6HA retains the same biological function as AGL24 in promoting flowering (CITATIONLiu et al., 2008), revealed two specific bands recognized by HA antibody (Figure 3Figure 3A). The lower faint band with a molecular mass of approximately 31 kDa was consistent with the predicted size of the fusion protein AGL24-6HA. As phosphorylated proteins often have slower mobility on an SDS-PAGE gel, the dominant upper band was probably the phosphorylated form of AGL24-6HA. To test this, 35S:AGL24-6HA protein extracts were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) for different time points. Immunoblot analysis showed that the amount of the major (upper) band was gradually reduced (Figure 3Figure 3C), resulting in the increased intensity of the lower band. This suggests that the slow- and fast-migrating bands represent the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of AGL24-6HA, respectively. Similarly, immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from 35S:SOC1-9Myc, where SOC1-9Myc promotes flowering as SOC1 (CITATIONLiu et al., 2008), also showed two bands with different mobility (Figure 3Figure 3B). After CIAP treatment, the intensity of the slow- and fast-migrating bands was reduced and increased (Figure 3Figure 3D), respectively, indicating that SOC1-9Myc proteins also exist as the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. [[FIGURE]] We further performed immunoblot analysis to examine the temporal phosphorylation status of AGL24 and SOC1 in developing plants (Figure 3Figure 3E). The phosphorylated form of AGL24-6HA was prominently expressed in 35S:AGL24-6HA over the developmental stages from young vegetative plants (day 4) to bolting plants (day 28). The phosphorylated form of SOC1-9Myc was highly expressed in 35S:SOC1-9Myc at all stages examined, while the amount of its unphosphorylated form gradually increased. Thus, phosphorylation of AGL24 and SOC1 proteins occurs in developing plants, indicating that their function is likely regulated by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. To examine if Pin1At directly interacts with SOC1 and AGL24, we performed GST pull-down assays. The phosphorylated AGL24-6HA and SOC1-9Myc from 35S:AGL24-6HA and 35S:SOC1-9Myc plants, respectively, were pulled down by GST-Pin1At, but not by GST control beads (Figures 3Figures 3F and 3G). Because the amount of AGL24-6HA and SOC1-9Myc unphosphorylated forms was low in the plant extracts, CIAP-treated proteins were further tested if Pin1At also interacts with the unphosphorylated proteins (Figures 3Figures 3H and 3I). Although the unphosphorylated proteins increased significantly after CIAP treatment, they were not pulled down by GST-Pin1At. These results indicate that Pin1At specifically interacts with the phosphorylated SOC1 and AGL24 in vitro. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis (CITATIONOhad et al., 2007), which examines protein-protein interactions through monitoring the fluorescence emitted by reconstitution of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein from two fragments (N- and C-terminal halves) fused to two interacting proteins, revealed the direct interaction of Pin1At-AGL24 (Figure 3Figure 3J) and Pin1At-SOC1 (Figure 3Figure 3K) in the nuclei of living plant cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis on the protein extracts from 35S:AGL24-6HA 35S:Pin1At further confirmed the in vivo interaction of AGL24 and Pin1At (Figure 3Figure 3L). As PIN1-type isomerases specifically recognize phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs, we examined whether phosphorylation of AGL24 and SOC1 occurs at Ser/Thr-Pro motifs using the mitotic phosphoprotein monoclonal-2 (MPM-2) antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in many phosphoproteins (CITATIONDavis et al., 1983). MPM-2 antibody detected the phosphorylated forms of AGL24-6HA and SOC1-9Myc, but not the unphosphorylated forms resulting from CIAP treatment (Figures 3Figures 3M and 3N), suggesting that the Thr-Pro motif in AGL24 and Ser-Pro motifs in SOC1 are phosphorylated. We further used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine if Pin1At catalyzes the cis/trans conformational exchange of the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in SOC1 and AGL24 at per residue resolution. To this end, we synthesized the phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated peptidesâ€”SLIIF(p)SPKGKLYE, which were derived from one of the two Ser-Pro motifs in SOC1, and SSYDSG(p)TPLEDDSD, which were derived from the only Thr-Pro motif in AGL24â€”and determined their conformational exchanges in response to Pin1At. Because of slow exchange between proline cis and trans conformations, many residues in both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides displayed two distinct sets of 1H signals in the ROESY (rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy) and TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy) spectra (Figures 4Figures 4A, 4B, S8, and S9S8, and S9). Only partial assignment of the peptide signals was obtained on the basis of the TOCSY and ROESY experiments due to severe signal overlap. The cis and trans populations of the peptides, regardless of their phosphorylation status, were âˆ¼10% and 90%, respectively, as estimated from the intensities of well-resolved peaks in the one-dimensional 1H spectra. [[FIGURE]] In the absence of Pin1At, no exchange cross peaks were observed in the ROESY spectra of the phosphorylated AGL24 and SOC1 peptides (Figures 4Figures 4A and S8S8A), indicating that the exchange between the cis and trans conformations is too slow on the NMR timescale (<0.1 sâˆ’1). In contrast, in the presence of Pin1At, we detected the exchange peaks resulting from proline isomerization in AGL24- and SOC1-phosphorylated peptides (Figures 4Figures 4B and S8S8B). Taking the intensities of cross and diagonal peaks of Leu204 and Thr202 amide protons from the phosphorylated AGL24 peptides, we further calculated the isomerization rates from cis to trans (kctcat) and from trans to cis (ktccat) conformations (Figures 4Figures 4C and 4D). The values of kctcat and ktccat obtained from Itt and Itc intensities for Thr202 were 8.7 and 0.8 sâˆ’1, respectively, while the respective values for Leu204 were 9.8 and 1.3 sâˆ’1 (Figures 4Figures 4E and 4F). The results measured from two different residues were consistent and revealed that the exchange rate from the cis to trans conformation (kctcat) was about 8â€“10 times larger than that from the trans to cis conformations (ktccat), which was expected from the trans and cis population ratio (âˆ¼9:1). The isomerization rates catalyzed by Pin1At (kctcat and ktccat) were significantly higher than those without Pin1At (kct and ktc) (Figure 4Figure 4F), demonstrating that isomerization of phosphorylated AGL24 peptides was dramatically enhanced by Pin1At (Figure 4Figure 4G). On the contrary, the nonphosphorylated peptides (both AGL24 and SOC1) displayed no exchange peaks in both the presence and absence of Pin1At (Figure S9Figure S9). These findings, together with the protein interaction results shown by GST pull-down and BiFC assays (Figures 3Figures 3F to 3K), suggest that Pin1At binds to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in AGL24 and SOC1 and catalyzes their cis/trans isomerization. Compared to their homologs in other species, plant PIN1 homologs contain an extra four amino acid insertion in their PPIase domains (Figure S1Figure S1). Deletion of these four amino acids has been shown to abolish the ability of Pin1At to rescue the lethal phenotype of yeast Ess1 mutation under nonoverexpression conditions, indicating its critical role in mediating the substrate interaction of Pin1At (CITATIONYao et al., 2001). We thus constructed the Pin1At mutant protein (mPin1At) with deletion of these four amino acids to test their function in mediating Pin1At enzyme activity. While GST-mPin1At was still able to bind to the Myc-tagged AGL24 and SOC1 (Figure S10Figure S10), NMR analysis revealed that there was no isomerization of AGL24 peptide by mPin1At (Figure S11Figure S11), suggesting that these plant-specific amino acids are essential for the enzyme activity of Pin1At. To test whether this four amino acid insertion is relevant to Pin1At function in the control of flowering time, we have overexpressed the mutated Pin1At in Arabidopsis and obtained 25 transgenic plants. All of these transgenic plants showed similar flowering time as wild-type plants under LDs (data not shown), which is different from the early flowering phenotypes exhibited by overexpression of wild-type Pin1At (Figure 1Figure 1E), further indicating that Pin1At function in flowering time control depends on its isomerization function. If Pin1At effect on flowering is mediated through its interaction with phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in SOC1 and AGL24, mutagenesis of these motifs would affect flowering time. Thus, we substituted Thr202 with Ala in the Thr-Pro motif of AGL24 and Ser49 and Ser195 with Ala in the Ser-Pro motifs of SOC1 in their respective genomic constructs (Figure 5Figure 5A). Previous studies have demonstrated that the native AGL24 and SOC1 genomic fragments used in this study are able to largely rescue late flowering of their respective loss-of-function mutants (CITATION, CITATION). The average flowering time of agl24-1 or soc1-2 mutants transformed with their respective native genomic fragments was around 14 rosette leaves, which was comparable with that of wild-type plants (12 rosette leaves) (Figures 5Figures 5B and 5C). However, agl24-1 mutants transformed with the mutated Thr-Pro motif construct, gAGL24-AP, and soc1-2 mutants transformed with the mutated Ser-Pro motif construct, gSOC1-2AP, flowered much later with around 18 and 22 rosette leaves, respectively (Figures 5Figures 5B and 5C), demonstrating that mutation of Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in AGL24 and SOC1 delays flowering. [[FIGURE]] To study if the mutations in Ser/Thr-Pro motifs affect the ability of AGL24 and SOC1 as substrates of Pin1At-mediated isomerization, we further tested whether Pin1At could catalyze the isomerization of the mutated Thr-Pro motif in AGL24. To this end, we synthesized a peptide, SSYDSGAPLEDDSD, in which TP was mutated into AP, and examined its conformational change by NMR spectroscopy. No conformational exchange was observed in the absence or presence of Pin1At (Figure S12Figure S12), suggesting that the Thr-Pro motif is essential for AGL24 to serve as a Pin1At substrate. To confirm that Pin1At affects flowering through these Ser/Thr-Pro motifs, we further crossed the representative transgenic lines (agl24 + gAGL24, agl24 + gAGL24-AP, soc1 + gSOC1, and soc1 + gSOC1-2AP) that showed an average flowering time of their respective populations with 35S:Pin1At agl24-1 and 35S:Pin1At soc1-2. While overexpression of Pin1At promotes flowering, this effect was compromised by the mutations of Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in SOC1 and AGL24 (Figure 5Figure 5D), thus corroborating that the Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in AGL24 and SOC1 are indispensable for Pin1At function in promoting flowering. Similar to the expression levels of AGL24 and SOC1 (Figure S6Figure S6A), the localization of AGL24 and SOC1 in the shoot apical meristem during floral transition was also not affected by suppression or overexpression of Pin1At (Figure S13Figure S13), further suggesting that Pin1At does not regulate AGL24 and SOC1 at the transcriptional level. To elucidate how Pin1At affects the function of AGL24 in the control of flowering time, we examined AGL24 protein expression in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions extracted from 2-week-old wild-type, Pin1At-AS, and 35S:Pin1At plants by western blot analysis using a specific anti-AGL24 antibody (CITATIONLiu et al., 2009). AGL24 protein expression was detected only in the nuclear fraction, with a higher level in 35S:Pin1At and a lower level in Pin1At-AS (Figure 6Figure 6A), suggesting that Pin1At activity regulates phosphorylated AGL24 protein accumulation in the nucleus. As CIAP treatment of the nuclear protein from wild-type plants resulted in a shift of the upper band to a lower band with an expected size of AGL24 (Figure 6Figure 6B), the upper band detected by AGL24 antibody before CIAP treatment should be the phosphorylated form of AGL24. This demonstrates that the endogenous AGL24 protein exists dominantly as the phosphorylated form, which is consistent with the observation on AGL24-6HA in 35S:AGL24-6HA (Figures 3Figures 3A and 3E). [[FIGURE]] As human PIN1 regulates the turnover of many interacting proteins (CITATIONLu and Zhou, 2007), it is possible that Pin1At regulates the AGL24 level through mediating its protein stability. To test this possibility, we treated 2-week-old seedlings with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and found that AGL24 had a half-life of about 2â€“3 hr in the absence of new protein synthesis (Figure 6Figure 6C). Downregulation of Pin1At in Pin1At-AS plants decreased AGL24 protein stability with a half-life of less than 2 hr, whereas upregulation of Pin1At in 35S:Pin1At increased AGL24 half-life to 4â€“6 hr, suggesting that Pin1At indeed interacts with the phosphorylated AGL24 to regulate its stability in the nucleus.
!~MM~! Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia or Landsberg erecta were grown in LDs (16 hr light/8 hr dark) or SDs (8 hr light/16 hr dark) at 23Â°C Â± 2Â°C. The flowering time was measured by scoring the total number of rosette leaves after bolting. To generate 35S:Pin1At construct, the full-length Pin1At cDNA fragment containing 44 bp 3â€² untranslated region was amplified using primers Pin1At-F1 and Pin1At-R1 (Table S1Table S1). The amplified fragment was digested and cloned into the pGreen 0229-35S binary vector (CITATIONYu et al., 2004). Based on this construct, we generated 35S:mPin1At, in which the four plant-specific amino acids (as shown in Figure S1Figure S1) were deleted using the QuikChange II XL-Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). To generate the Pin1At antisense construct, a 216 bp N-terminal fragment was amplified by Pin1At-F2 and Pin1At-R2 (Table S1Table S1). This fragment was also cloned into the pGreen 0229-35S binary vector. For the complementation test, the plasmids containing gAGL24 and gSOC1 were produced as previously described (CITATIONLiu et al., 2008). Two genomic constructs, gAGL24-AP and gSOC1-2AP, which contain the mutations from Thr residue to Ala in AGL24 and Ser residue to Ala in SOC1, respectively, were further generated using the QuikChange II XL-Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For the subcellular localization study, the Pin1At full-length cDNA was fused at the N terminus of GFP in the modified pGreen 0229-35S vector. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in triplicates on 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) (CITATIONLiu et al., 2007). Semiquantitative PCR and nonradioactive in situ hybridization were performed as previously described (CITATIONYu et al., 2004). Primer sequences used for gene expression analysis were listed in Table S1Table S1. Arabidopsis protoplast transfection by pGreen 0229-GFP and pGreen 0229-Pin1At-GFP was performed as previously published (CITATIONSheen, 2001). The GFP localization and chlorophyll red autofluorescence were observed under the fluorescence light microscopy (Zeiss LSM510; Oberkochen, Germany). Proteins were extracted from 2-week-old wild-type, 35S:AGL24-6HA, and 35S:SOC1-9Myc plants and immunoprecipitated with anti-AGL24, anti-HA, and anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. After immunoprecipitation, the protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were washed twice with alkaline buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2 [pH 8.8]) and then once with CIAP buffer with protease inhibitors. The beads were resuspended in CIAP buffer and incubated with CIAP at 37Â°C. Mock-treated control samples were incubated in the same volume of the reaction buffer without CIAP. The samples were subsequently spun for 1 min at 13,000 rpm to pellet the bead-bound complex. After removing the supernatant, 2Ã— SDS protein sample buffer was added for further immunoblot analysis. Full-length cDNAs of SOC1, AGL24, and Pin1At were cloned into primary pSAT1 vectors (CITATIONTzfira et al., 2005). The resulting cassettes, including a fusion protein and a constitutive promoter, were cloned into pGreen binary vector HY105 and transformed into Agrobacterium. For BiFC experiments, 3-week-old tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves were coinfiltrated with Agrobacterium as previously described (CITATIONSparkes et al., 2006). GST-Pin1At fusion construct was prepared by cloning the coding region of Pin1At into the SpeI-XhoI sites of pET42a expression vector. Based on this construct, we generated the GST-mPin1At fusion construct using the same method for generating 35S:mPin1At. E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the plasmids were induced by IPTG, harvested, and lysed. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ). The beads with the bound GST-Pin1At were washed for subsequent pull-down assays. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 800 MHz NMR spectrometer at 25Â°C. All spectra were recorded on peptide samples containing 20 mM phosphate buffer (90% H2O and 10% D2O [pH 6.5]) with or without Pin1At or mPin1At. The peptide concentration was 2.4 mM, and the Pin1At concentration was 0.03 or 0 mM for the samples of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated AGL24 peptides (SSYDSG[p]TPLEDDSD) (GL Biochem; Shanghai, China), respectively. The peptide concentration was 0.15 mM, and the Pin1At concentration was 0.004 or 0 mM for the samples of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated SOC1 peptides (SLIIF[p]SPKGKLYE), respectively, because these two peptides have relatively low solubility in aqueous solution. For all experiments, 256 Ã— 512 complex points were acquired with spectral widths of 7200 Ã— 9600 Hz in t1 Ã— t2 dimensions and an interscan delay of 1 s. For phosphorylated AGL24 peptide, ROESY spectra (CITATIONBax and Davis, 1985a) were acquired at a series of mixing times: 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 110 ms, and a spin-lock field strength of 4 kHz and 16 scans. For nonphosphorylated AGL24 peptide, one ROESY spectrum was recorded at a mixing time of 110 ms, a spin-lock field strength of 4 kHz, and 16 scans, while TOCSY experiments (CITATIONBax and Davis, 1985b) were carried out at a mixing time of 75 ms and 8 scans. For phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated SOC1 peptides, ROESY spectra were recorded at a mixing time of 110 ms, a spin-lock field strength of 4 kHz, and 96 scans, while TOCSY spectra were acquired at a mixing time of 75 ms and 64 scans. Ratios of cross to diagonal peak intensities for cis and trans conformations in the ROESY spectra depend on the forward (kctcat) and backward (ktccat) rate constants of a two-state exchange process (cis â†” trans) and the mixing times (tm). Changes of the ratios with the mixing times were fit using Equations (1), (2) to determine the forward and backward rates (CITATIONPastorino et al., 2006):
