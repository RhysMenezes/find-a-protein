!~ABS~! We characterized the pcb2 (pale-green and chlorophyll b reduced 2) mutant. We found through electron microscopic observation that chloroplasts of pcb2 mesophyll cells lacked distinctive grana stacks. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the pcb2 mutant accumulated divinyl chlorophylls, and the relative amount of divinyl chlorophyll b was remarkably less than that of divinyl chlorophyll a. The responsible gene was mapped in an area of 190 kb length at the upper arm of the 5th chromosome, and comparison of DNA sequences revealed a single nucleotide substitution causing a nonsense mutation in At5g18660. Complementation analysis confirmed that the wild-type of this gene suppressed the phenotypes of the mutation. Antisense transformants of the gene also accumulated divinyl chlorophylls. The genes homologous to At5g18660 are conserved in a broad range of species in the plant kingdom, and have similarity to reductases. Our results suggest that the PCB2 product is divinyl protochlorophyllide 8-vinyl reductase.
!~RES~! The pcb2 mutant has a pale-green phenotype (Fig. 1). In the F2 populations of a backcross with wild-type Columbia (Col), normal and mutant plants segregated in a ratio very close to 3 : 1 (85 : 32; χ2 = 0.34; P = 0.56). This result indicates that the pcb2 mutation was inherited in a single recessive manner. The growth rate of the pcb2 mutant was severely reduced compared with the wild-type. The thylakoid membranes of the pcb2 chloroplasts were arranged in a disorderly fashion and did not develop distinct grana stacks; extensive adhesion of two to a few thylakoid membranes was observed instead (Fig. 2). There were no distinct differences in the size and the number of chloroplasts between the wild-type and the mutant. Starch granules were not found in the mutant chloroplasts, suggesting the reduction of photosynthetic activity in the mutant. The chlorophylls in leaf extracts were separated chromatographically and the peaks that were assumed to be chlorophylls a and b from their retention time and absorption spectrum were compared. The comparative amounts of chlorophylls between wild-type and pcb2 were calculated from the peak areas at 660 nm. The amounts of chlorophylls a and b extracted from the pcb2 plants were approximately one-half and one-quarter of that from the wild-type, respectively (Fig. 3A, B). The peaks corresponding to chlorophylls a and b of the pcb2 mutant were eluted a little earlier than those of the wild type (Fig. 3C). Peaks 1′ and 2′ in Fig. 3B are recovered, and their spectra in diethyl ether are compared with those of the chlorophyll a and b standards. The result showed that the peaks shifted from 430 to 435 nm (chlorophyll vs. peak 2′, Fig. 3D) and from 455 to 462 nm (chlorophyll b vs. peak 1′, Fig. 3E). The profiles of these spectra are consistent with those of divinyl chlorophylls (Shedbalkar and Rebeiz 1992). The mass spectra obtained for chlorophyll a and b standards showed major ions at m/z 912 [M + NH4]+ and m/z 926 [M + NH4]+, whereas the corresponding peaks (peaks 1′ and 2′, Fig. 3) from the pcb2 mutant showed major ions at m/z 910 [M + NH4]+ and m/z 924 [M + NH4]+, respectively. The mass of 2 Da shifted from the standards is equivalent to the mass changing in the reduction of a –CH=CH– double bond to a –CH2–CH2– single bond. In a previous study, we mapped pcb2 to a locus at the upper arm of chromosome 5 (Nakanishi et al. 2004). Further analysis using 442 F2 seedlings revealed that PCB2 is located between PAT1.2 [simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) marker, AGI position; 5,397 kb] and dPCB2 [derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker, AGI position; 6,335 kb]. Three recombinations were observed in 884 chromosomes between PAT1.2 and the pcb2 locus, one in 884 chromosomes between the pcb2 locus and dPCB2. Calculating the recombination ratio, the presumed area was narrowed to a range of about 190 kb where 49 genes are predicted (Fig. 4A, B). According to TargetP (Emanuelsson et al. 2000) and the PSORT program (Nakai and Horton 1999), products of four genes are suggested to localize in the chloroplast. By means of DNA sequence analysis of these four genes, one of them, At5g18660, had a single nucleotide substitution at the 85th residue (cytosine to thymine) resulting in a stop codon in the pcb2 mutant, instead of glutamine in the wild-type (Fig. 4C). In order to confirm that At5g18660 is the gene causing the pcb2 mutation, we carried out complementation and antisense analysis. A genomic copy of At5g18660 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter was introduced into the pcb2 mutant (sense) and wild-type (antisense) by the floral dipping method (Fig. 5A). The resultant transgenic plants bearing the 35S-At5g18660 sense gene had green leaves (Fig. 1C) and normal chlorophylls (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the transgenic plants suppressed with antisense DNA turned out to show the same phenotype as the pcb2 mutant (Fig. 1D, 5B). The reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) analysis of At5g18660 mRNA in leaves showed that PCB2 was expressed in the wild-type and the pcb2 complemented plants, but not in the pcb2 mutant, nor in antisense suppressed plants (Fig. 5C, D). Thus, a mutation in At5g18660 seems to be responsible for the pcb2 phenotype. We examined the tissue-specific expression pattern of PCB2 in various organs by RT–PCR. PCB2 was expressed highly in leaves, stems and flower buds, and slightly in roots (Fig. 6A). To determine the subcellular localization of the PCB2 protein, the sGFP gene was fused to the 3′ end of the PCB2 gene, generating the PCB2-sGFP chimeric gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. 6B). Confocal laser scanning microscopic observation revealed that the PCB2–sGFP protein localized in chloroplasts in mesophyll cells (Fig. 6C). The PCB2 gene encodes an uncharacterized protein with a transit peptide to chloroplast (Fig. 7). A BLAST search revealed that there are no other genes significantly similar to PCB2 in the genome of A. thaliana. Referring to the DDBJ database, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that encode proteins highly homologous (>55% identities) to PCB2 were found in various species of dicots (Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula, Lycopersicon esculentum, etc.), monocots (Oryza sativa, Triticum turgidum, etc.), a moss (Physcomitrella patens), a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus sp. WH8102) and a photosynthetic bacterium (Chlorobium tepidum TLS), but not in yeast and animals. None of these homologous proteins have been characterized yet. The search also yielded the noteworthy information that PCB2 has similarity to some reductases such as NADH dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase and isoflavone reductase (27 and 26% identities, respectively). Another feature of the PCB2 protein is the presence of a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues that constitute a putative transmembrane domain near its C-terminus (Fig. 7, asterisks).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) were used. The pcb2 mutant was isolated from the EMS mutant library of Col as a pale-green mutant (Nakanishi et al. 2004). Seeds were sterilized in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite with 0.05% Tween-20, then kept at 4°C in the dark for 2 days. The seeds were germinated on a 1% sucrose agar plate containing 1/1,000 volume of liquid fertilizer (Hanakoujo; Sumika-Takeda-Engei, Tokyo, Japan) at 40% humidity and in a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle at 22°C. Seedlings 2 to 4 weeks old were transferred to rock wool (NICHIAS, Tokyo, Japan) and grown under the same conditions. To fine map PCB2, an F2 population was generated from a cross between pcb2 and Ler wild-type. Markers used for PCR-based mapping were nga106 (TAIR Accession No. Genetic Marker: 1945512), ciw8 (TAIR Accession No. Genetic Marker: 2005439) and PAT1.2 (TAIR Accession No. Genetic Marker: 1945631). These are SSLP markers (Bell and Ecker 1994). dPCB2B was designed to distinguish Ler from Col by the unique restriction site of BamHI as a dCAPS marker (Neff et al. 1998). Primers used for creating dPCB2B on PCR were dPCB2B-F (5′-agttcttgtctcttgatgcctggat-3′) and dPCB2B-R (5′-aagttcgttaaagcagcagcaccaa-3′). The PCR-amplified fragments of the four genes which had a transit peptide into the chloroplast from the pcb2 genome were sequenced directly with a DSQ-2000L (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and an ABI PRISM 310 (Applied Biosystems, CA, U.S.A.). Primers used for PCR were At5g18570-F1 (5′-tttatcagagaaacaaatggcttcc-3′), At5g18570-R1 (5′-cggttcaatccaatgaccga-3′), At5g18660-F1 (5′-atgtcactttgctcttccttcaacg-3′), At5g18660-R1 (5′-ctacacagcaaactcatttcgc-3′), At5g18820-F1 (5′-ccggttccaaaaactcggtc-3′), At5g18820-R1 (5′-caccactttgtgagcaaagg-3′), At5g18910-F1 (5′-cttctctctttctctctctttccc-3′) and At5g18910-R1 (5′-tcatctccaatcctcagcag-3′). Full-length PCB2 genomic DNA was amplified by PCR with a set of primers, At5g18660-F1 and At5g18660-R1. The fragment was cloned into a T-vector pXcmKn12 by TA-cloning (Cha et al. 1993) to create the plasmids having the insert in both orientations. Two kinds of HincII–SacI fragments containing PCB2 were released from each plasmid and subcloned into the SmaI–SacI site of the pSMAK251 vector generating pKS-PCB2 and pKA-PCB2. pKS-PCB2 encodes sense mRNA under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and pKA-PCB2 encodes antisense mRNA (Fig. 5A). The vector pSMAK251 was a gift of Dr. H. Ichikawa, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan. To create pGWB5-PCB2 (Fig. 6B), we used GATEWAY™ Technology (Invitrogen, CA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The entire coding region of PCB2 was amplified by PCR using attB1-At5g18660-Fw (5′-aaaaagcaggctggatgtcactttgctcttccttc-3′) and attB2-At5g18660-Rv (5′-agaaagctgggtagaagaactgttcaccgagtt-3′) as primers. The genomic DNA of wild-type (Col) was used as a template. The fragment was amplified again with ‘adapter primers’ and then introduced into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) using ‘BP recombination reaction’ to generate the ‘entry clone’ of At5g18660. The binary vector was constructed using an ‘LR recombination reaction’ between the entry clone and the destination vector pGWB5. The vector pGWB5 was a gift of Dr. T. Nakagawa, Shimane University. All plasmids were transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 strain by electroporation (GENE PULSER II; Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). The pKA-PCB2 and pGWB5-PCB2 plasmids were introduced into wild-type (Col) by floral dipping as described by Clough and Bent (1998). The pKS-PCB2 plasmid was introduced into PCB2/pcb2 heterozygous plants. Seeds from transformed plants were selected on 1% sucrose agar plates containing 1/1,000 liquid fertilizer and 20 µg ml–1 kanamycin. To select the pcb2/pcb2 homozygous plants from the (T1) plants, the PCR-amplified genomic DNAs were sequenced directly. Primers used for PCR and sequencing were At5g18660-F3 (5′-ggatcttcactttctcgcac-3′) and At5g18660-R2 (5′-taatgccttgcctggtccac-3′), corresponding to positions outside of the introduced sense At5g18660 fragment (Fig. 4C). T1 and T2 progeny were used for phenotype analysis. Total RNA was extracted from leaves using a PURESCRIPT Cell and Tissue RNA Isolation Kit (Gentra System, MN, U.S.A.). After DNase I treatment, complementary DNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer with ReverTraAce (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The cDNA synthesized from 10 ng of total RNA was used for PCRs with Ex-Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan). At5g18660-F2 (5′-gagaagagtgggattagagg-3′), At5g18660-F3 and At5g18660-R2 were used as PCB2-specific primers; actin2-F (5′-ggaaggatctgtacggtaac-3′) and actin2-R (5′-tgtgaacgattcctggacct-3′) were used as a control for constant expression (Andersson et al. 2003). The temperature cycles were: 94°C for 4 min; 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min; and finally 72°C for 7 min. Chlorophylls were extracted by soaking approximately 5 mg of fresh 16-day-old whole plants in 100% acetone at 4°C in complete darkness. The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were separated on an octadecylsilyl (ODS) column [4.6 mm i.d.×150 mm: LUNA 5u C18 (2), Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, U.S.A.] with solvent (methanol : acetonitrile : acetone = 1 : 3 : 1) at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml min–1 at 40°C (Zapata et al. 2000) using an LC10Avp system (Shimadzu). Elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 660 nm using a diode array detector (SPD-M10Avp, Shimadzu). The spectrum graph of eluted peaks was developed from records in the detector. Two fractions corresponding to divinyl chlorophylls a and b were separated, then the eluate was blown dry using nitrogen gas and dissolved in diethyl ether. Their absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (DU7400, BECKMAN) between 350 and 700 nm. Liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectometry (MS) was carried out using an LCMS-2010A system (Shimadzu) equipped with an STR ODS II column (15 cm length×2.0 mm i.d., Shinwa Chemical Industries, Ltd) and an ESI source. Materials extracted by acetone from pcb2 leaves and the standard chlorophylls a and b (from spinach, Sigma, St. Louis, U.S.A.) were separated with methanol at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1 at 40°C. The mass spectra between 200 and 1,000 m/z were obtained with positive ion mode. Leaf segments were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) for 2 h at room temperature, and washed with the same buffer for 10 min at room temperature. The washing step was repeated six times. They were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) for 2 h at room temperature. The fixed samples were dehydrated through a series of acetone solutions. Ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife on a Sorvall MT2-B ultramicrotome and transferred onto copper grids. The sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 10 min followed by lead citrate for 2 min at room temperature. The specimens were observed on a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. T2 progeny of the pGWB5-PCB2 transformant were subjected to confocal microscopic analysis (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). The non-fused sGFP transformant nA5-4 was used as a control (Niwa et al. 1999). Green fluorescence and red autofluorescence from chlorophyll were monitored by Kr/Ar laser excitation as described (Niwa et al. 1999).
