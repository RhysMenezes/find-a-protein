!~ABS~! Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins serve as intracellular sensors to detect pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses. Transcription of the NB-LRR-encoding Resistance (R) genes needs to be tightly controlled to avoid inappropriate defense activation. How the expression of the NB-LRR R genes is regulated is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1 (snc1) mutant carries a gain-of-function mutation in a Toll/Interleukin1 receptor-like (TIR)-NB-LRR-encoding gene, resulting in the constitutive activation of plant defense responses. A snc1 suppressor screen identified modifier of snc1,9 (mos9), which partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1. Positional cloning revealed that MOS9 encodes a plant-specific protein of unknown function. Expression analysis showed that MOS9 is required for the full expression of TIR-NB-LRR protein-encoding RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 4 (RPP4) and SNC1, both of which reside in the RPP4 cluster. Coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that MOS9 associates with the Set1 class lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) methyltransferase Arabidopsis Trithorax-Related7 (ATXR7). Like MOS9, ATXR7 is also required for the full expression of SNC1 and the autoimmune phenotypes in the snc1 mutant. In atxr7 mutant plants, the expression of RPP4 is similarly reduced, and resistance against Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Emwa1 is compromised. Consistent with the attenuated expression of SNC1 and RPP4, trimethylated H3K4 marks are reduced around the promoters of SNC1 and RPP4 in mos9 plants. Our data suggest that MOS9 functions together with ATXR7 to regulate the expression of SNC1 and RPP4 through H3K4 methylation, which plays an important role in fine-tuning their transcription levels and functions in plant defense.
!~RES~! The mos9 mutant was identified from a suppressor screen of snc1 single mutant (CITATION). The size of the mos9 snc1 double mutant plant is much bigger than that of snc1 but still exhibits snc1-like twisted leaves (Fig. 1A). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the elevated PR1 and PR2 expression in snc1 is largely reduced by mos9, although not to wild-type levels (Fig. 1, B and C). The free and total salicylic acid (SA) content in mos9 snc1 double mutant plants was 30% lower when compared with that of snc1 plants (Fig. 1, D and E) but still higher than those of the wild type. When mos9 snc1 double mutant plants were challenged with the virulent oomycete pathogen Ha Noco2 or the bacterial pathogen Psm ES4326, they produced more spores and supported more bacterial growth than snc1 plants but not to the level of the wild type (Fig. 1, F and G). Taken together, mos9 partially suppresses all autoimmune phenotypes of snc1. [[FIGURE]] To identify the molecular lesion in mos9 that leads to the suppression of snc1, mos9 snc1 (in ecotype Columbia [Col-0] accession) was crossed with ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) with snc1 introgressed (Ler-snc1; CITATION). Linkage analysis on 24 F2 plants that had lost the snc1 morphology revealed that the mos9 locus is located on the top arm of chromosome 1 between markers T28P6 and F3F19 (Fig. 2A). Further mapping with over 1,000 F2 plants narrowed the mos9 mutation to the region between markers T28K15 and T12C24. Unfortunately, with this population, we could not narrow the region beyond this 250-kb region. [[FIGURE]] To further resolve the position of the mos9 mutation, we transformed mos9 snc1 plants with a set of overlapping transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) clones (JAtY, John Innes Center) covering the 250-kb region. Only one clone, JAtY51H02, complemented the mos9 phenotype (Fig. 2B; Supplemental Table S1). By subtracting the regions covered by the noncomplementing clones from JAtY51H02, the mos9 lesion could be confined to a small region containing six candidate genes (Fig. 2C). Because mos9 was identified from a fast neutron-mutagenized population and fast neutron induces deletion mutations, the coding sequences of these candidate genes were amplified from mos9 snc1 to test whether any of them has been deleted in the mutant. Two genes, At1g12520 and At1g12530, could not be PCR amplified from mos9 snc1, suggesting that mos9 contains a deletion mutation affecting both genes. Direct transgenic complementation using the genomic region of At1g12520 or At1g12530 driven by their native promoter was used to test which gene is MOS9 (CITATION). As shown in Figure 2, D and E, only mos9 snc1 transgenic plants carrying At1g12530 exhibited snc1-like morphology and enhanced resistance against Ha Noco2. Of 12 transgenic lines carrying At1g12530 in mos9 snc1, 11 showed snc1-like morphology, indicating that At1g12530 complemented the mos9 defects. Together with the complementation data from JAtY51H02 clone (Supplemental Table S1), we concluded that MOS9 is At1g12530. Sequence analysis of MOS9 revealed that it encodes a plant-specific protein of 193 amino acids with no discernible motifs or domains. In Arabidopsis, MOS9 has a remote paralog, At1g56420 (Supplemental Figs. S1A and S2). MOS9 and At1g56420 seem to be evolving independently and at different rates, with MOS9 evolving faster than At1g56420 (Supplemental Fig. S2). MOS9 homologs in other plant species, including Arabidopsis lyrata, are more divergent, while those of At1g56420 are highly conserved. A survey of coding regions of MOS9 in 75 Arabidopsis accessions revealed that there are at least 11 alleles present in the population containing 24 polymorphic sites, 15 of which are nonsynonymous changes resulting in amino acid substitutions. By contrast, At1g56420 shows seven alleles with six polymorphic sites, only two of which lead to amino acid substitutions. Codeml analysis (CITATION) indicates that two of the individual amino acid residues (39 D and 156 K) in MOS9 could be positively selected under positive selection model 8 with posterior probabilities 0.703 and 0.707, respectively (Supplemental Table S2). However, there was no indication of positive selection in At1g56420 (Supplemental Table S3). To obtain the mos9 single mutant, mos9 snc1 was crossed with wild-type Col-0 plants. Lines homozygous for mos9 and the wild type for SNC1 were selected as the mos9 single mutant. As shown in Figure 3A, mos9 is morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type plants. [[FIGURE]] To test whether MOS9 contributes to basal defense against virulent pathogens, mos9 plants were challenged with Psm ES4326 at a concentration of optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.0001. Wild-type plants usually develop no disease symptoms at this low dose 3 d after infiltration. Like wild-type plants, mos9 plants support similar bacterial growth 3 d after inoculation, whereas the susceptible control, Col-0-eds1 (enhanced disease susceptibility 1), carries 1,000 times more bacteria (Fig. 3B). Therefore, MOS9 does not seem to contribute to basal resistance. To determine whether MOS9 is required for resistance mediated by other TIR-type R proteins, we challenged mos9 single mutant plants with Ha isolates Emwa1 and Cala2 and Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (P.s.t.) DC3000 carrying avrRps4 that can be recognized by TIR-type NLRs RPP4 (CITATION), RPP2 (CITATION), and Resistance to P.s.t. avrRps4 (RPS4) (CITATION), respectively. Resistance mediated by RPP4 is compromised in mos9 plants (Fig. 3C). mos9 supported growth of approximately 1,500 spores per seedling, while less than 200 spores were observed on the wild type. However, resistance mediated by RPS4 (Supplemental Fig. S4A) and RPP2 (data not shown) is not affected in mos9 plants. Another large class of plant NLRs is the CC type. To test whether MOS9 contributes to resistance mediated by CC-type NLRs, we challenged mos9 single mutant plants with P.s.t. DC3000 carrying the avirulent effectors avrPphB, avrRpt2, or avrRpm1 that can be recognized by plant CC-type NLRs RPS5 (CITATION), RPS2 (CITATION; CITATION), and RPM1 (CITATION), respectively. As shown in Supplemental Figure S4, B to D, mos9 single mutant plants were as resistant as wild-type Col-0 plants when challenged with bacterial pathogens carrying these avirulent effectors. These data suggest that MOS9 does not contribute to resistance mediated by these CC-type NLR proteins. Because mos9 only affects resistance responses mediated by snc1 and RPP4, we tested whether the expression of snc1 and RPP4 is affected in the mos9 mutant background. As shown in Figure 3D, the steady-state expression level of SNC1 is reduced in mos9 single mutant, whereas that of snc1 is about 67% in the mos9 snc1 double mutant as that in snc1. Moreover, SNC1 transcript levels in mos9 single mutant remains lower than that in wild-type plants, even after pathogen challenges (Fig. 3E). Like SNC1, the steady-state and the induced RPP4 transcript levels are also reduced in the mos9 single mutant plants (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that mutation in MOS9 affects the expression levels of SNC1 and RPP4. Alternatively, the steady-state and the pathogen-induced expression of RPM1 and RPS2 in mos9 are similar to that of wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S4, E and F), indicating that MOS9 has no effect on the transcription of these R genes. Because protein sequence analysis of MOS9 yielded very little information, we first investigated its subcellular localization. MOS9 was expressed by its native promoter and with GFP fused to its C terminus. MOS9-GFP fully complemented mutant phenotypes associated with the mos9 mutation, and mos9 plants carrying the MOS9-GFP construct restored resistance against Ha Emwa1 (Fig. 4A). This suggests that the construct expressing MOS9-GFP fusion protein localizes and functions as the wild-type MOS9 in planta. Whereas GFP alone under constitutive 35S promoter control was localized everywhere inside the cell, weak fluorescence of the MOS9-GFP fusion protein was mostly detected inside the nuclei in both root cells, guard cells, and leaf pavement cells (Fig. 4B). [[FIGURE]] Because we could not exclude the possibility that MOS9 also localizes to other cellular compartments, we also carried out subcellular fractionation on complementing mos9 mutant plants expressing MOS9-GFP. As shown in Figure 4C, MOS9-GFP signal can be detected in both nuclear and nuclei-depleted fractions. Taken together, MOS9 seems to be a protein predominantly localizing to the nucleus. To better understand how MOS9 regulates the expression levels of SNC1 and RPP4, we searched for MOS9-associating proteins by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Because a large portion of MOS9-GFP protein is located inside the nucleus, the affinity purification experiment was carried out on the nuclear fraction of MOS9-GFP plants using anti-GFP microbeads. A nuclear fraction of wild-type plants was used as negative control. SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining showed that two proteins, one about 150 kD and the other about 65 kD copurified with the MOS9-GFP bait protein (Fig. 5A). MS analysis showed that the large protein is ATXR7, a nuclear Set1 class H3K4 methylase of 159 kD, and the smaller protein is High Chlorophyll Fluorescence Phenotype173 (HCF173; 66 kD), a protein with weak similarities to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (Fig. 5B). Both proteins were not detected in the wild-type control sample. Because HCF173 localizes to the chloroplasts (CITATION), it is likely a false positive interactor from chloroplast contamination. We therefore focused our further analysis on ATXR7. [[FIGURE]] H3K4 methyltransferases ATXR7 and ATX1 are required for proper activation of FLC through H3K4 methylation (CITATION). The identification of ATXR7 as a protein associated with MOS9 prompted us to test whether ATXR7 is required for snc1 mutant phenotypes. We first introduced atxr7-1 into snc1 to determine whether a mutation in ATXR7 can suppress snc1 like mos9. As shown in Figure 6, atxr7-1 not only partially suppresses the stunted growth morphology of snc1 (Fig. 6A), but also suppresses the enhanced disease resistance of snc1 against the virulent oomycete pathogen Ha Noco2 (Fig. 6B). The suppression of enhanced disease resistance of snc1 is also reflected by reduced snc1 and PR gene expression in atxr7-1 snc1 double mutant plants (Fig. 6, C–E). Unlike mos9 and atxr7, a mutation in the ATXR7 paralog ATX1 cannot suppress the stunted growth morphology or the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1 (Supplemental Fig. S3). These data suggest that both MOS9 and ATXR7 are required for full expression of snc1 and snc1-mediated autoimmunity. Consistent with reduced transcripts of snc1, snc1 protein levels were reduced in both mos9 snc1 and atxr7 snc1 mutant backgrounds when compared with that of snc1 plants (Fig. 6F). Similar reduction in SNC1 protein level was also observed in mos9 and atxr7 single mutants (Supplemental Fig. S5). [[FIGURE]] We further tested whether ATXR7 is required for RPP4-mediated disease resistance against Ha Emwa1. As shown in Figure 7A, atxr7 mutant plants supported much higher growth of Ha Emwa1 than the wild type. The susceptibility of atxr7 is similar to that of mos9 and rpp4 plants (Supplemental Fig. S6). The growth of Ha Emwa1 is similar to that in mos9 plants. Interestingly, when the mos9 atxr7 double mutant plants were challenged with Ha Emwa1, no additive effect is observed; the growth of the oomycete is similar to that in the single mutants. These data suggests that MOS9 and ATXR7 function in the same biological process relating to immunity. This is consistent with the earlier biochemical data that MOS9 is able to pull down ATXR7, and they seem to function together in a protein complex. Similar to SNC1, expression of RPP4 is also reduced in atxr7 (Fig. 7B), suggesting that reduced expression of RPP4 results in compromised resistance to Ha Emwa1 in atxr7-1. Suppression of snc1 by atxr7 (Fig. 6) and similar susceptibility to Ha Emwa1 in mos9 atxr7 double mutant when compared with that of mos9 and atxr7 single mutants (Fig. 7A) suggest that MOS9 and ATXR7 function together in the same genetic pathway in regulating snc1- and RPP4-mediated resistance. [[FIGURE]] Because H3K4 methylation is correlated with transcriptional activation and ATXR7 functions as a H3K4 trimethyltransferase, we further investigated whether MOS9 plays a role in the regulation of H3K4me3 levels in the promoter regions of SNC1 and RPP4 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using an antibody that specifically recognizes H3K4me3 marks. Real-time PCR was carried out on the DNA samples from the ChIP assays using primers specific to DNA close to the start codon of SNC1 and RPP4. As shown in Figure 7C, the amount of the housekeeping gene Actin7 is similarly pulled down in both wild-type and mos9 plants in chromatin-immunoprecipitated samples using both H3 and H3K4me3 antibodies, indicating that MOS9 does not affect general H3K4me3 marks. However, with regards to SNC1 and RPP4, reduced H3K4me3 marks were observed in mos9 plants compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 7D), suggesting that MOS9 contributes to the level of H3K4 trimethylation at these loci.
!~MM~! All plants were grown at 22°C under a 16-h-light/8-h-night regime. mos9 snc1 was identified from a fast neutron-treated snc1 mutant population previously described (CITATION). In brief, the M2 population of fast neutron-treated snc1 (carrying pPR2::GUS reporter gene system) was first screened for suppression of snc1’s dwarf and stunted growth morphology. These putative mutants were further tested for suppression of constitutive defense phenotype of snc1 by carrying out GUS staining. Mutants that showed reduced or no GUS staining were studied further. Gene expression analysis was carried out by extracting RNA from 2-week-old plate-grown or 4-week-old soil-grown plants using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion). The extracted total RNA (0.4 μg) was then reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Expression analysis for PR1, PR2, and Actin1 was performed as previously described (CITATION), with cDNA samples being normalized by real-time PCR using Actin1 and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Gene-specific primers for reverse transcription-PCR analyses used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Infection experiments with Pseudomonas and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis strains were performed as described (CITATION). In brief, infection of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Noco2 was performed on 2-week-old seedlings by spraying with an Ha Noco2 spore suspension at a concentration indicated in figure legends. Plants were maintained at 18°C under 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycles with 80% humidity, and the infection was scored 7 d after inoculation by counting the number of conidia spores per gram of tissue (when plants of different treatments are of different sizes) or per plant (when plants of different treatments are of similar sizes) using a hemocytometer or using a 0 to 5 disease rating system as previously described (CITATION). The induced R gene expression experiments were done by infiltrating 4-week-old soil-grown plants with 10 mm MgSO4 (mock) or Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (OD600 = 0.1) carrying specific avirulence effector indicated in the figure legends. Two full leaves from each plant and six plants per genotype were used for each treatment. The infiltrated leaves were collected 4 h after infiltration and subjected to total RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription to generate cDNA for R gene expression analysis. The induced R gene expression was calculated relative to uninduced wild-type cDNA samples. Positional cloning of mos9 was performed as previously described (CITATION). The markers used to map mos9 were designed according to the insertion-deletion polymorphisms between the genomic sequences of Col-0 and Ler provided by Monsanto on The Arabidopsis Information Resource homepage (https://www.arabidopsis.org/Blast/cereon.jsp). Primer sequences for these markers are listed in Supplemental Table S2. JAtY clones were individual clones from the TAC library, which consists of clones that provides 14× coverage of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Col-0 genome. Overlapping JAtY clones covering the 250-kb mapping region were obtained from the John Innes Centre. Plasmids from each clone were extracted from 4 mL overnight Escherichia coli. culture (in Luria-Bertani medium supplement with 25 μg mL–1 kanamycin) using standard alkaline lysis method. Extracted plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation method. Successfully transformed A. tumefaciens were grown in 400 mL Luria-Bertani medium (supplement with 25 μg mL–1 kanamycin) at 28°C for 24 to 48 h (until OD600 reached 0.8) with constant shaking. A. tumefaciens cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in dipping solution (5% [m/v] Glc and 0.02% [v/v] Silwet-77). All constructs were transformed into mos9 snc1 plants using the floral dip method (CITATION) to generate transgenic lines for complementation analysis. For the construction of pGreen0229-pMOS9::MOS9, which was used for transgene complementation of mos9 snc1, the genomic sequence covering the MOS9 coding region plus 1.8-kb 5′ upstream and approximately 0.4-kb 3′ downstream sequence was PCR amplified using primers 5′-CGCGGATCCGACGTGGAGACGATCGGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCATCCGACACTAGGTTCTTG-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and the digested fragment was cloned into pGreen0229 vector (CITATION). For construction of pCambia1305-pMOS9::MOS9-GFP, which was used for subcellular localization of MOS9-GFP and immunoprecipitation of MOS9-GFP experiments, the genomic sequence covering the MOS9 coding region without the stop codon plus the 1.8-kb 5′ upstream sequence was PCR amplified using primers 5′-ccgGAATTCcatccgacactaggttcttg-3′ and 5′-CGCggatccGCCAAAGCCAGGAGGGAGTTC-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and the digested fragment was cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1305 vector that contained a GFP tag (http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/home.html). All constructs were transformed into designated genotypes using the floral dip method (CITATION) to generate transgenic lines for subsequent analysis. Mutants described in this study were PCR genotyped using the following primers. For genotyping mos9, which was generated using fast neutron bombardment, primer pairs 4269391_F: ggcgtagacggattgaacgg and At1g12530_R: tgatgcatcatgaagccctg were used. A fragment with approximately 1.4 kb can be amplified from wild-type MOS9 but not from homozygous mos9 mutant. Seeds of ATX1 and ATXR7 mutants were obtained from Richard M. Amasino (CITATION); they are transfer DNA insertional mutant alleles and were genotyped by using the primer pairs listed in Supplemental Table S2. For total protein extraction, 0.1 g leaf tissue of 4-week-old soil-grown plants was harvested in liquid nitrogen and ground into fine powder. Samples were homogenized in extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2% [w/w] SDS, and 2% [v/v] β-mercaptoethanol). After 5 min of centrifugation at 4°C at 13,200 rpm, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 4× Laemmli loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 min. Protein samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and followed by Western-blot analysis. Approximately 3 g of 2-week-old plate-grown plants were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to fine powder, and homogenized in 1.5 V of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25% [w/w] glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5mm MgCl2, and 250mm Suc) at 4°C. The homogenate was sequentially filtered through a 100- and 30-μm nylon mesh. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500g for 10 min. The nuclei pellet was washed three times with nuclei resuspension buffer with Triton X-100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25% [w/w] glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% [v/w] Triton X-100) at 4°C and washed one time with nuclei resuspension buffer without Triton X-100. The final nuclei pellet was resuspended in 300 µL 2× Laemmli loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 min. For Western-blot analysis, the nuclear fraction was loaded 2 times more than the nuclei-depleted fraction. Approximately 20 g of 2-week-old plate-grown plants were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to fine powder, and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25% [w/w] glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm Suc) at 4°C. Two samples were prepared simultaneously. Wild-type Col-0 plants were used as negative control, and MOS9-GFP transgenic plants were used for immunopurification. Nuclei were purified as above and then resuspended in 2 mL ice-cold NE-2 buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 20% [w/w] glycerol, 0.2% [v/w] Triton X-100, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma]) and then subjected to sonication for 4 min with 5-s on and 10-s off intervals to completely release nuclear proteins. The supernatant was mixed with 50 μL of anti-GFP MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated at 4°C for 1 h; the MicroBeads-bound target protein was magnetically precipitated on columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The columns were then washed eight times, each time with 1mL NE-3 buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 20% [w/w] glycerol, 0.2% [v/w] Triton X-100, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) before proteins were eluted with 60 μL 95°C preheated 1× SDS loading buffer. The samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining using ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit (Sigma). The protein bands specific to MOS9-GFP were excised for Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis. Gel bands at the same positions of the Col-0 treatment were also excised. The MS data from MOS9-GFP were compared with that of Col-0 to rule out false-positive identifications. ChIP was performed as described previously (CITATION), with some modifications. In brief, approximately 8 g of 2-week-old seedlings grown on MS plate were collected and cross linked with 1% [v/w] formaldehyde for 20 min and the cross linking was terminated by adding 2 m Gly to final concentration of 0.125 m and vacuum infiltrated for 5 min. After rinsing seedlings with distilled water for five times, tissues were ground into fine power using liquid nitrogen and nuclei purified as described above. Nuclei pellet was resuspended in 1 mL ChIP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% [w/w] SDS, 1× Protease inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated with a Fisher 550 Sonic Dismembrator for 2 min (15 s on and 60 s off, power 4.0) to yield DNA of an average fragment size of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 kb. Sonicated chromatin was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min to pellet the debris, and the supernatant was collected into a new 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. The soluble chromatin solution was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% [v/w] Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 1× Protease inhibitor, and 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to decrease the SDS concentration to 0.1% [w/w]. Chromatin solution was precleared with no antibody-conjugated Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare; 17-1279) at 4°C for 1 h with gentle rotation, and 1 μL of α-H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8580) antibody was added to approximately 2.5 mL of diluted chromatin solution and incubated at 4°C overnight. Thirty microliters of prewashed Protein A Sepharose beads were added to each sample to pull down the antibody for 2 h at 4°C. After washing with different washing buffers, immunocomplex was eluted twice from the beads with 250 μL of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1% [w/w] SDS). Eluted immunocomplex was reverse cross linked by adding 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm at 65°C overnight. Protein was removed by adding proteinase K, and DNA was extracted using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), extraction methods and precipitated by ethanol. The immunoprecipitated DNA was resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer and subjected to real-time PCR analysis with primers listed in Supplemental Table S4.
