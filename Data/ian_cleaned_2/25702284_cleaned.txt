!~ABS~! Trafficking of seed storage proteins to protein storage vacuoles is mediated by carboxy terminal and internal sorting determinants (ISDs). Protein modelling was used to identify candidate ISDs residing near surface-exposed regions in Arabidopsis thaliana cruciferin A (AtCruA). These were verified by AtCruA fusion to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and expression in developing embryos of A. thaliana. As the presence of endogenous cruciferin was found to mask the effects of weaker ISDs, experiments were conducted in a line that was devoid of cruciferin. In total, nine ISDs were discovered and a core determinant defined using a series of alanine scanning and deletion mutant variants. Coupling of functional data from AtCruA ISD-YFP fusions with statistical analysis of the physiochemical properties of analogous regions from several 11/12S globulins revealed that cruciferin ISDs likely adhere to the following rules: (1) ISDs are adjacent to or within hydrophilic, surface-exposed regions that serve to present them on the protein’s surface; (2) ISDs generally have a hydrophobic character; (3) ISDs tend to have Leu or Ile residues at their core; (4) ISDs are approximately eight amino acids long with the physiochemical consensus [hydrophobic][preferably charged][small or hydrophobic, but not tiny][IL][polar, preferably charged][small, but not charged][hydrophobic, not charged, preferably not polar][hydrophobic, not tiny, preferably not polar]. Microscopic evidence is also presented for the presence of an interconnected protein storage vacuolar network in embryo cells, rather than discreet, individual vacuoles.
!~RES~! In silico modeling of the monomeric form of AtCruA revealed five surface-exposed regions, four of which were spatially analogous to the DRs found in the soybean 11S proglycinin A1aB1b trimer (Adachi et al. CITATION) (Fig. 1). Previous studies indicated that these regions may either contain ISDs or help to display them on the surface of the protein (Maruyama et al. CITATION; Petruccelli et al. CITATION). Extending these studies, we appended the AtCruA DR, as well as surface-exposed amino acids adjacent to them, to YFP and expressed the fusion proteins in A. thaliana plants (Table 1). Initially, a single construct containing a region with a known ISD (the AtCruA DR4 + C′ region analogous to that containing the G. max glycinin ISD) was expressed in wild type A. thaliana plants, as well as in a plant line devoid of cruciferin. The rationale for this was based on the notion that competition with endogenous cruciferin for receptor molecules makes identification of weaker individual sorting determinants difficult in a wild type background (Maruyama et al. CITATION). Indeed, we observed strong PSV localization with the known ISD linked to YFP in the cruciferin-deficient mutant, but only limited or no PSV localization in the wild type line (Fig. 2). As in earlier studies (Maruyama et al. CITATION; Petruccelli et al. CITATION), we appended either four or six glycine residues to the putative ISDs, since this places the determinants in an internal context and blocks a weak cryptic, PSV sorting determinant present near the carboxyl terminus of YFP (Tables 1, 2). [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]] [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] DR1 resides at the amino terminus of the protein and is situated at the base of the β-barrel that defines the cupin domain. YFP fused to DR1 along with the amino acids carboxyl terminal to it was neither secreted nor localized to the PSV. Rather, the majority of the protein remained within the cell in what appears to be the endomembrane system (Fig. 3). YFP fused to DR2 along with the amino terminal amino acids was mostly secreted, though a small amount was observed in the PSV. YFP fused to DR2 with the carboxyl terminal amino acids was also secreted, but a higher proportion was found in the PSV suggesting that this region contains a weak ISD. Similar to DR2, YFP fused to DR3 and the amino terminal amino acids was mostly secreted, while YFP fused to DR3 and the carboxyl terminal amino acids was secreted and localized to the PSV in approximately similar proportions. The region between DR3 and DR4 is an α-helical region that interacts with the α-helical region upstream of DR5 to form the trimer. This was examined separately as an ISD was found previously in this area; that being the NIFGRF motif in the A. hypochondriacus 11S globulin amaranthin (Petruccelli et al. CITATION). Indeed, YFP fused to the DR3-DR4 region was strongly localized to the PSV. DR4 forms an extended loop that laps onto the β-barrel of the adjacent protomer to further stabilize the trimer. YFP fused to DR4 and either the amino or carboxyl terminal amino acids was strongly localized to the PSV. The region carboxyl terminal to DR4 contains the amino acids ICSAR at the same location as the ICTMR ISD of the G. max A1aB1b glycinin (Maruyama et al. CITATION). DR4 and carboxyl terminal amino acids from A. thaliana CruB (AtCruB), which contains LCTMR at the analogous location, was more effective in directing YFP to the PSV. DR5 comprises the carboxyl terminal amino acids and was shown to contain both a carboxyl terminal sorting determinant (ctSD) and an ISD (Nishizawa et al. CITATION). We examined the area upstream of this which forms an α-helical region that, as noted above, interacts with the DR3 to DR4 α-helical region of an adjacent protomer in the trimer. DR5 is at the end of AtCruA and was shown to contain a putative ctSD (Shimada et al. CITATION); therefore, this region was excluded from the construct. However, when fused to the region upstream of DR5, YFP was strongly localized to the PSV indicating that a strong ISD was also present. [[FIGURE]]  The identification of ISDs and an associated physiochemical property ISD consensus was conducted using a combination of empirical and informatics approaches and is described in detail below. In brief, regions adjacent to the DRs in AtCruA were tested for their ability to localize YFP to the PSV (above). 13 amino acid blocks centered on Ile or Leu were then compiled from regions that exhibited some ability to localize YFP to the PSV, as well as from the analogous regions in the other A. thaliana cruciferins. A consensus for each position was developed based on over-representation of amino acid physiochemical properties relative to random surface exposed regions. Application of this physiochemical consensus back to AtCruA yielded a list of putative ISDs that were appended to YFP and tested in planta. A refined physiochemical consensus was then determined by comparing only functional AtCruA determinants. Mutation analysis was used to better define the length of the ISD and amino acids critical to their function. Finally, hidden Markov models (HMM) were used to identify an ISD consensus for each individual determinant by comparison to analogous regions in other 11S globulins. Nine of the ten regions tested in the first generation constructs showed some level of PSV localization. In earlier studies, substitution of the Ile or Leu residue was shown to inactivate the vacuolar targeting ISDs in glycinin (Maruyama et al. CITATION), conglycinin (Nishizawa et al. CITATION), ricin (Frigerio et al. CITATION), R. communis 2S albumin (Brown et al. CITATION) and Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) sporamin (Matsuoka and Nakamura CITATION). In accordance, a second set of constructs was designed to identify individual ISDs within the regions flanking the DRs with either Ile or Leu at the core of the determinant (Table 1). In total, 26 Ile/Leu residues were present in the regions that showed some PSV targeting in the first generation constructs. A tiered screening process was used to select regions more likely to be ISDs. Initially, three regions in which the Ile/Leu was within three amino acids of the end of the tested regions were excluded since the ISD is likely to be incomplete. Subsequently, the AtCruA regions (Ile/Leu plus 6 flanking amino acids) were aligned with the homologous regions of AtCruB, AtCruB’ and AtCruC. It is worth noting that all of the 23 remaining AtCruA Ile/Leu regions were conserved in at least one other AtCru member. The list was further refined by removing three putative ISDs obtained from very weak PSV targeting regions (DR2 + N′ and DR3 + N′), leaving 19 putative AtCruA ISDs and 52 putative ISD sequences from all four cruciferins (Supplemental Table 2). The frequency of individual amino acids at each position was calculated, but no consensus was obvious. Subsequently, the representation of amino acids with or without specific chemical properties (Livingstone and Barton CITATION) was determined for each position. Two methods were then used to identify a physiochemical consensus. Firstly, the most common physiochemical properties at each position (over 50 %) were determined (Supplemental Table 3.1) yielding the following consensus: [small or polar or hydrophobic][small or hydrophobic][polar or hydrophobic][small or hydrophobic][polar][small or polar or hydrophobic][IL][polar][small or polar or hydrophobic][small or hydrophobic][polar or hydrophobic][small or polar or hydrophobic][small or polar or hydrophobic], which can also be written as [any][ACDFGHIKLMNPSTVWY][ACDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVWY][ACDFGHIKLMNPSTVWY][CDEHKNQRSTWY][any][IL][CDEHKNQRSTWY][any][ACDFGHIKLMNPSTVWY])[ACDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVWY][any][any] or [any][not EQR][not P] [not EQR][not AFGILMPV][any][IL][not AFGILMPV][any][notEQR][not P][any][any]. Secondly, recognizing that some physiochemical properties are more common in surface exposed regions, an average and standard deviation for each property in the regions tested was determined (Supplemental Table 3.2) by comparison to a reference set comprising 51 eighteen amino acid blocks from surface exposed regions in the four A. thaliana cruciferins (Supplemental Tables 3.3 and 3.4). This resulted in a similar, but more refined consensus that included fewer amino acids than the first as follows: [any][hydrophobic, not charged][any][hydrophobic, not polar][not hydrophobic][hydrophobic][IL][polar, not hydrophobic][small, not charged][any][hydrophobic][tiny][any], which can also be written [any][ACFGILMTVWY][any][AFGILMV][DENPQRS][ACFGHIKLMTVWY][IL][DENQRS][ACGNPSTV][any][ACFGHIKLMTVWY][ACGS][any] or [any][not DEHKNPQRS][any][not CDEHKNPQRSTWY][not ACFGHIKLMTVWY][not DENPQRS][IL][not ACFGHIKLMPTVWY][notDEFHIKLMQRWY][any][not DENPQRS][not DEFHIKLMNPQRTVWY][any]. Several factors were considered when determining the length of the putative ISDs to test in the second generation constructs. Firstly, the ISDs in amaranthin (NIFRGF) and glycinin (ICTMR) include four amino acids downstream of the Ile residue, the last of which coincided with the highly significant (1 % confidence level) amino acid in the consensus at Position 11 (Supplemental Table 3.2). Position 12 was also highly significant, but with a requirement for a tiny amino acid that is provided by the first Gly in the hexa-glycine appendage. Secondly, the amaranthin and glycinin ISDs included either no or a single amino acid upstream of the Ile/Leu; however, amino acids with significantly over-represented physiochemical properties were found one, two, three and five residues upstream of the Ile/Leu at consensus Positions 6, 4 and 2, respectively. Since the penultimate amino acid in YFP conforms to the consensus for Position 2, the second generation constructs consisted of eight amino acids (three upstream and four downstream of the Ile/Leu). When the two related eight amino acid consensuses were applied to the regions flanking the DRs in AtCruA, 15 of the 22 potential ISDs were identified by one or both methods as having less than three mismatches (Supplemental Table 4). Eleven ISDs were selected for further analysis, including the regions analogous to the amaranthin and glycinin ISDs. In addition, the putative ISD from AtCruB (EETLCTMR) was included since it was more similar to the glycinin ISD (ICTMR) than that found in AtCruA (EETICSAR). When these eight amino acid sequences were fused to YFP, 11 of 12 showed some PSV-localization activity (Table 1). The original YFP fusion to DR2 indicated that weak ISDs may reside in the amino and carboxyl terminal regions. Fusion of the amino terminal GKVIPGCA (ISD1) or carboxyl terminal VEHIRSGD (ISD2) sequences to YFP directed only a small amount or none of the fusion protein to the PSV, respectively. The DR3-DR4 region contained three putative individual ISDs, including QKNIFNGF (ISD3) which is in an analogous position to the NIFGRF determinant from amaranthin. The AtCruA QKNIFNGF sequence was a relatively strong sorting determinant and directed most of the YFP to the PSV, as did ALKIDLQT (ISD4). The AQALKIDL sequence which comprises part of the ISD4 determinant was weaker and directed only some of the YFP to the PSV. In the original construct, DR4 and the amino terminal region strongly directed YFP to the PSV. The FGVIRPPL (ISD5) sequence from this region also functioned as an ISD, though more weakly in this context. The DR4 and carboxyl terminal region was a relatively strong ISD. This region contains the sequence ICSAR in AtCruA and LCTMR in AtCruB which are similar and in analogous locations to the glycinin A1aB1b sorting determinant ICTMR. The YFP fusion containing the CruA EETICSAR sequence was mostly secreted; however, the fusion protein containing the CruB EETLCTMR, which is more similar to the glycinin determinant, was partially directed to the PSV. The region amino terminal to DR5 strongly localized YFP to the PSV and three individual sorting determinants were found in this region. TSVLRGLP (ISD7) was a strong sorting determinant, while LEVITNGF (ISD8) and FNTLETTL (ISD9) were weaker, but did direct some YFP to the PSV. To further define the minimal requirements for an ISD, a series of alanine scanning and deletion mutants were generated based on the AtCruA QKNIFNGF sequence (denoted as ISD3) (Table 2). The analogous region in amaranthin (GNIFRGF) is also a known ISD (Petruccelli et al. CITATION). The QKNIFNGF sequence was a moderate to strong ISD and directed about half of the YFP to the PSV, with the remainder secreted to the apoplast (Fig. 4). Mutational analysis of an ISD with intermediate strength allowed identification of changes that either reduced or improved sorting efficiency. Replacement of the Asn by Ala greatly increased the proportion of YFP that was secreted, though a small amount was still directed to the PSV. Replacement of the Ile, which was presumed to be at the core of the motif, or the Phe residue immediately adjacent to it with Ala, reduced, but did not abolish sorting of YFP to the PSV. Replacement of the second Asn had no effect on sorting of YFP to the PSV. Interestingly, replacement of the glycine with alanine, both of which have similar physiochemical properties, slightly increased ISD function resulting in exclusive localization of the YFP to the PSV. Conversely, deletion of Gln or Gln and the adjacent Lys residue from the amino terminus of the ISD greatly decreased the proportion of YFP sorted to the PSV. Similarly, deletion of one or more of the carboxy terminal amino acids severely affected ISD function, suggesting that the minimal functional length of this particular ISD is at least eight residues. Interestingly, deletion of the Gln, Lys and Asn residues restored ISD sorting capacity. This might be due to amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of YFP (LYK) that are now in these positions, the first and third of which conform to the consensus. [[FIGURE]]  Attempts were made to identify an ISD consensus among 7 ISDs that directed at least some YFP to the PSV. The secondary structure surrounding the core I/L residue in the A. thaliana cruciferin ISDs was determined by Predict Protein, as well as by homology modeling using either the G. max proglycinin (PDB:2d5f) and B. napus cruciferin (PDB:3kglA) as templates. No β-sheet structure was detected in any of the ISDs and no apparent consensus was found as to the location or length of α-helical regions (Supplemental Table 5). The physiochemical properties of the most functional A. thaliana ISDs were also compared (Table 3) which yielded the following consensus: [hydrophobic][preferably charged][small or hydrophobic, but not tiny][IL][polar, preferably charged][small, but not charged][hydrophobic, not charged, preferably not polar][hydrophobic, not tiny, preferably not polar], which can also be written as [ACFGHIKLMTVWY][DEHKR][DFHIKLMNPTVWY][IL][CDEKHNRSTWY][ACGNPSTV][AFGILMV][FILMV]. Of note, was the preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids adjacent to charged and/or polar amino acids. Hydrophobic amino acids are normally in reduced abundance on the surface of proteins and this may impart the ISD with a unique a physiochemical signature.[[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] An attempt was also made to define an ISD consensus using hidden Markov models (HMM). Initially, seven ISDs from AtCruA (ISD3, ISD4, ISD5, ISD6, ISD7, ISD8 and ISD9) were aligned and used to generate a HMM. ISD1 and ISD2 were excluded since they are weak or non-functional. ISD6 was also a weak determinant, but was included since it is analogous to the amaranthin ISD. When the TAIR database was searched with this model, no results were returned. To increase the power of the HMM, the analogous AtCruB and AtCruC ISD regions were included in the analysis. A search of the TAIR database with this HMM returned all three cruciferins with 5 of 7 (ISD3, 5, 6, 8 and 9) input ISDs (Supplemental Table 6). When the search was extended to the B. rapa and B. oleracea databases, cruciferin was identified with the same 5 of 7 input ISDs. When the search was further extended to all plant sequences in the NCBI refseq database, no hits were returned (Supplemental Table 6). This was not unexpected since the HMM was based on short peptide sequences which have an increased likelihood of being present by chance within a larger database causing the e-value to drop below the significance threshold. When analogous ISD regions from a variety of dicots were aligned it was noted that there was more conservation of ISDs within a group than between ISD groups (Supplemental Table 7). Analogous regions corresponding to seven functional A. thaliana ISDs (ISD1, ISD3, ISD4, ISD5, ISD6, ISD7 and ISD8) were aligned and used as input to create HMMs for each ISD. ISD9 was excluded since it was not conserved outside the Brassicaceae. When the individual ISD alignments were used as HMM input and the resulting models used to search the TAIR, B. rapa or B. oleracea databases, ISD1, ISD3, ISD6 and ISD8 returned cruciferin or cruciferin-like proteins, while ISD4, ISD5 and ISD7 did not (Supplemental Tables 8.1–8.7). In some cases, proteins that were unlikely to be targeted to the PSV were returned, but all of these were predicted to contain multiples of a single ISD which inflated the scores. In total, three A. thaliana, four B. rapa and five B. oleraceae cruciferins were identified (Supplemental Table 8.8). A search of the plant delimited NCBI refseq database with these HMM models failed to return any cupin domain proteins. As before, this is likely due to the short length of the input sequences relative to the large size of the database searched. Two dimensional images of embryo cells accumulating fluorescent protein fusions in this and other studies show what appear to be numerous, discreet PSVs of varying sizes, shapes and fluorescent intensities (Figs. 2, 3, 4). During the course of the localization studies above, it was noted that when YFP was appended to a strong ISD and expressed in the cruciferin-deficient plant line, the YFP signal co-localized completely with PSV autofluorescence. A similar observation was made previously with red fluorescent proteins attached to ricin or phaseolin PSV sorting determinants (Hunter et al. CITATION). When we examined Z-stacks of the PSV fluorescence, connections between the PSVs appeared to be present. To explore this further, high resolution Z-stacks of embryo cells in seeds of a cruciferin-deficient line expressing SP-YFP-DR5 + N′ were combined to form a three dimensional image of the PSVs. The PSV autofluorescence and YFP signals again co-localized; however, PSV autofluorescence was preferred for imaging since it was observed with a shorter 2-photon excitation wavelength (720 nm instead of 920 nm) resulting in better resolution, and had a better signal to noise ratio that yielded a cleaner image. Two-photon confocal microscopy was used to minimize bleaching in the large Z-stack. This analysis revealed that the PSVs are not discreet, individual, spherical entities, but rather are part of an interconnected network (Fig. 5; Supplemental Movie 1). Irregular shaped nodes that appear as distinct vacuoles when observed on a single plane by conventional microscopy were shown to be fused to other nodes or connected by short passages. For two cells, the ratio of cell (2525 and 2656 μm3) to PSV (1103 and 1215 μm3) volume was determined which indicated that the total volume of the cell occupied by the PSV network ranged from 43.9 to 45.7 %. [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! Constructs to identify and characterize ISDs comprised the AtCruA signal peptide (MARVSSLLSFCLTLLILFHGYAA) fused to the N-terminus of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP, Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) followed by putative sorting determinants from AtCruA and in one case AtCruB. Four or six glycine residues were appended to the C-terminus to mask any cryptic carboxy terminal protein sorting determinants as per Maruyama et al. (CITATION) and Petruccelli et al. (CITATION). The constructs were generated using SOEing PCR (Horton et al. CITATION). The sequences of all primers are provided in Supplemental Table 1. The first generation constructs used to identify putative ISDs used oligonucleotides of 121–226 bp in length that were cloned into pUC57 after synthesis (BIO BASIC Inc., Markham, ON, Canada). The oligonucleotide encoding the signal peptide also encoded the first seven amino acids of eYFP. The other oligonucleotides encoded the last seven amino acids of eYFP, followed by the AtCruA region to be tested and four glycine residues. Each oligonucleotide was flanked by BfuAI restriction sites. PCR primers were generated by digestion with BfuAI which cuts precisely four nucleotides 3′ (sense strand) and eight nucleotides 3′ (anti-sense strand) from the recognition site leaving termini that were complementary to eYFP. The oligonucleotide encoding the AtCruA signal peptide also contained a KpnI restriction site internal to the BfuAI, while the oligonucleotides encoding the sorting determinants contained a SacI restriction site internal to the BfuAI to allow for subsequent subcloning of the constructs into a plant transformation vector. The first SOEing PCR reaction fused the signal peptide to eYFP, while the second reaction incorporated the ISD. The second set of constructs comprised the AtCruA signal peptide fused to the amino terminus of eYFP, followed by eight amino acids encoding a putative ISD fused to six glycine residues. Constructs were generated by amplifying the SP-YFP using the forward primer Pnap_CRA_F-Kpn-2 and construct-specific reverse primers which encoded the ISD to be tested and glycine residues followed by a SacI restriction site. Four to six bp extensions were included adjacent to the termini of the SacI and KpnI restriction sites to allow efficient digestion of the PCR product. The third set of constructs comprised the AtCruA signal peptide fused to the amino terminus of eYFP, followed by a modified ISD based on QKNIFNGF fused to six glycine residues. Two types of modifications were tested: (1) A series of alanine scanning mutants, and (2) a series of serial deletions of the QKNIFNGF sequence. Constructs were generated using the same methods as in the second set above. For all constructs, the resultant PCR products were digested with KpnI and SacI and cloned into pMDC32-N in Escherichia coli DH10B (Invitrogen). pMDC32-N is a derivative of pMDC32 (Curtis and Grossniklaus CITATION) in which the CaMV 35S promoter was replaced with the seed-specific napin promoter (1934 bp upstream of the start codon of At4g27160). Napin and cruciferin are the main SSP in A. thaliana and the genes encoding them have very similar expression patterns according to the ABRC microarray database (Zimmermann et al., CITATION). The plasmids were then introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 pMP90 for plant transformation.  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia and a cruciferin deficient line were propagated under controlled conditions (16-h ~800 W m2 light at 21 °C and 8-h dark at 16 °C). To generate the cruciferin deficient plant line the following T-DNA insertion lines obtained from either the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Centre (www.abrc.osu.edu) or GABI-Kat (www.gabi-kat.de) were used: cruACRUBCRUC (SALK 002668, T-DNA inserted in the second exon of At5g44120), CRUAcruBCRUC (SALK 045987, T-DNA inserted in the fourth exon of At1g03880) and CRUACRUBcruC (GK-283D09, T-DNA inserted in the first exon of At4g28520). A homozygous triple-knockout line (cruAcruBcruC or CRU-) was obtained by several rounds of conventional crossing and selection with appropriate PCR primers (Withana-Gamage et al. CITATION).  Arabidopsis thaliana plants were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION) modified to include a 30 s exposure to vacuum (25 mmHg) immediately after dipping. This was found to reduce the tissue damage observed when the vacuum was applied during the dipping procedure (Bechtold et al. CITATION) and improved transformation efficiency. Plants transformed with the neomycin phosphotransferase (NptII) selection marker were identified as follows. Seeds were sterilized (incubated with shaking in 95 % ethanol for 5 min, 30 % bleach + 0.05 % Tween 20 for 15 min, and rinsed 5 times with sterile water), and then placed at 4 °C for 2-5 days in sterile 0.1 % agar. Sterile seeds were germinated and grown on ½ MS agar (0.22 % Murashige and Skoog basal salts, 0.10 % MES, 1 % sucrose, 0.7 % agar, pH 5.7), with 300 µg/ml Timentin and 50 µg/ml kanamycin for 7–20 days. Epi-fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate the localization of the various cruciferin-YFP fusion constructs. Mature A. thaliana seeds were soaked in ½ MS for 2-3 h. The embryos were removed from the seed coat by gently pressing them between a slide and a cover slip in ½ MS and transferred to a drop of ½ MS on a new slide for live cell imaging. Embryos were viewed on a Zeiss Imager.Z1 compound microscope outfitted with an Apotome. A 40X apochromat water-immersion lens (NA 1.2) was used in conjunction with the YFP filter (excitation wavelengths 490–510 nm, emission wavelengths collected 520–550 nm) and a DIC lens (for bright field images). Autofluorescence was negligible as it only became visible with exposure times over 3 s (generally 4–5 s) and most images of YFP were taken with exposure times of 1.5 s or less. Control images of the non-transformed line were taken over a range of settings; however, at the exposure times used to visualize YFP in PSV these were dark fields. Exposure times for every sample were noted since the levels of expression varied between independent events/lines per construct and poorly expressing lines were excluded from the analysis to avoid long exposure times. Images were viewed and exported in.TIFF format using Axiovision 4.8.2. For each construct, five cotyledons from each of three independent transformed lines were viewed. If a consensus phenotype was not obvious, two additional independent lines were assessed. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize PSVs in three dimensions. Mature A. thaliana seeds containing the SP-YFP-DR5 + N′ construct which is completely localized to the PSV were soaked in ½ MS for 2–3 h. The embryos were removed from the seed coat by gently pressing them between a slide and a cover slip in ½ MS and transferred to a drop of ½ MS on a new slide for live cell imaging. Embryos were viewed on a Zeiss LSM 710 compound microscope outfitted with a tunable Sapphire laser (set to 720 nm) and an Argon laser (458, 488, and 514 nm laser lines). The YFP signal was detected using 514 nm excitation and a 518–621 nm emission filter. PSV autofluorescence was detected using 2-photon imaging with 720 nm excitation, a long pass 480 nm filter and a non-descanned detector. In the cruciferin-deficient line, the SP-YFP-DR5+ N′ signal co-localizes with PSV autofluorescence. At 720 nm excitation, only PSV autofluorescence was detected, while the YFP was not excited, allowing exclusive imaging of PSVs. A 40X apochromat water-immersion lens (NA 1.1) was used to obtain a Z-stack of 45 high quality images (pixel size 0.159 × 0.159 × 0.3 µm, averaging 4 scans per line to reduce noise). Images were deconvolved using AutoQuant X2 (blind PSF, 10 cycles, medium noise). At 720 nm excitation with a lens numerical aperture (NA) of 1.1 and a condenser NA of 0.55, the theoretical resolution was 0.5 μm (Inoue CITATION). Imaris 7.2.3 software was used to create 3D images from the Z-stack data. The theoretical structure of AtCruA was predicted using the SWISS-MODEL server (Arnold et al. CITATION; swissmodel.expasy.org). The template identification tool was used to identify the best template for modeling AtCruA. The settings used for the InterPro Domain Scan were: HMMPfam, HMMTigr, ProfileScan, SuperFamily, BlastProDom. The settings for the Gapped Blast Query were: E-value cut off (0.000001), Matrix [Blosum62, 11(G), 1E] and Alignments (50). Chain A from the crystal structure of procruciferin, 11S globulin from Brassica napus (PDB 3KGL) with a resolution of 2.98 angstroms (Tandang-Silvas et al. CITATION) had the best alignment and was used as the template for homology modeling (Zdobnov and Apweiler CITATION). The quaternary structure of AtCruA was assumed by the SWISS-MODEL server to be identical. The constructed model was structurally aligned to the template using SWISS-PDB Viewer (www.expasy.org/spdbv). Untemplated regions in the model, Arg125-Ser132 and Arg263-Glu286, were modeled using the ModLoop server (http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modloop). Energy minimization was performed with the Gromos96 implementation in SWISS-PDB. The energy calculated for the AtCruA model was −23,971 kJ/mol. The trimer was assembled using the Matchmaker function in Chimera with the following default settings: Alignment algorithm (Needleman-Wunsch); Matrix (Blosum62, gap extension penalty 1, iterate by pruning long atom pairs until no pair exceeds); 2.0 angstroms. Imaging of the protein was done in Chimera (www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera). The physiochemical property of amino acid R-groups was assessed as per the scheme of Livingstone and Barton (CITATION). Secondary structure was determined using Predict Protein (www.predictprotein.org), as well as by homology modeling using either the G. max proglycinin (PDB:2d5f) or Brassica napus cruciferin (PDB:3kglA) as templates. Hidden Markov models (HMM) were developed using HMMER (Eddy, CITATION) and searched against the TAIR (TAIR10_pep_20101214.fasta, downloaded June 14/2011 from ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Proteins/TAIR10_protein_lists/), Brassica rapa (Brapa_197_July_2014_annotated.fa, downloaded July 14/2014 from http://www.plantgdb.org/XGDB/phplib/download.php?GDB=Br), Brassica oleraceae (B.oleracea_v1.0.scaffolds_proteins.txt, downloaded July 15/14 from http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/login.htm) and NCBI refseq protein (downloaded July 18, 2013 from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/) databases. The 11/12S globulins used were: A. hypochondriacus amaranthin (Genbank X82121); A. thaliana CruA (At5g44120), CruB (At1g03880), CruB’ (At1g3890) and CruC (At4g28520); Arachis hypogaea Ara H 3 (PDB 3C3 V); B. napus cruciferin (PDB 3KGL); Cucurbita maxima 11S globulin (PDB 2E9Q); G. max glycinin A1aB1b (PDB 1FXZ) and A3B3 (PDB 2DH5); Pisum sativum legumin (PDB 3KSC).
