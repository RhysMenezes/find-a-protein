!~ABS~! Plant pathogens are perceived by pattern recognition receptors, which are activated upon binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Ubiquitination and vesicle trafficking have been linked to the regulation of immune signaling. However, little information exists about components of vesicle trafficking involved in immune signaling and the mechanisms that regulate them. In this study, we identified Arabidopsis thaliana Exo70B2, a subunit of the exocyst complex that mediates vesicle tethering during exocytosis, as a target of the plant U-boxâ€“type ubiquitin ligase 22 (PUB22), which acts in concert with PUB23 and PUB24 as a negative regulator of PAMP-triggered responses. We show that Exo70B2 is required for both immediate and later responses triggered by all tested PAMPs, suggestive of a role in signaling. Exo70B2 is also necessary for the immune response against different pathogens. Our data demonstrate that PUB22 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Exo70B2 via the 26S Proteasome. Furthermore, degradation is regulated by the autocatalytic turnover of PUB22, which is stabilized upon PAMP perception. We therefore propose a mechanism by which PUB22-mediated degradation of Exo70B2 contributes to the attenuation of PAMP-induced signaling.
!~RES~! In order to gain insight into the function of PUB22, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H) to identify proteins targeted for ubiquitination. We chose PUB22 as bait because our previous genetic data indicated that PUB22, together with PUB24, played the main role in the downregulation of PAMP-triggered signaling (CITATION). PUB22 is a modular protein that consists of a U-box domain that mediates the interaction with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and four armadillo (ARM) repeats responsible for the interaction with the target protein (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We used as bait only the ARM repeats domain without the U-box (PUB22ARM, residues 76 to 435) in order to prevent ubiquitination and the potential degradation of the target in yeast. We obtained several potential targets, including two clones encoding the N terminus of Exo70B2, a homolog of the yeast Exo70p subunit of the exocyst complex (Figure 1B; see Supplemental Table 1 online). These clones define the interaction site to the first 144 amino acids of Exo70B2 (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). We also confirmed via Y2H that the full-length PUB22 was able to interact with the full-length Exo70B2 (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1C online). Exo70B2 also interacts with other subunits of the exocyst complex, supporting its role as a functional component of the exocyst complex (CITATION). To confirm the interaction between PUB22 and Exo70B2 in vivo, we employed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) with split yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Coexpression of cMyc-nYFP-PUB22ARM, containing only the ARM repeats domain, with cYFP-Exo70B2 in Arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in the complementation of fluorescence localized to punctae, supporting an interaction in vivo (Figure 2A). This result corroborates that the ARM repeats are responsible and sufficient for the interaction with Exo70B2. By contrast, no signal could be observed by coexpression of PUB22U-box, containing only the U-box domain, with cYFP-Exo70B2 (Figure 2A). nYFP-PUB22ARM was also not able to interact with the homologous exocyst subunit Exo70A1 (Figures 2A and 1A). Protein accumulation was confirmed by immunoblot (Figure 2B). We further confirmed the interaction by coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP). cMyc epitope-tagged Exo70B2 coimmunoprecipitated YFP epitope-tagged PUB22 (Figure 2C). [[FIGURE]] To test whether the interaction between Exo70B2 and PUB22 is direct, recombinant Exo70B2 tagged with maltose binding protein (MBP) was incubated in vitro with recombinant PUB22 tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST). GST-PUB22 was readily pulled down, showing that it physically bound MBP-Exo70B2, confirming that the interaction is direct (Figure 2D). Using Y2H, no interaction was detected with any other subunits of the exocyst complex with the exception of the C terminus of Exo84 (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1C online). Interestingly, structural modules with a high degree of homology in the N terminus of Exo70p and the C terminus of Exo84p have been determined in yeast (CITATION). PUB22 was shown to act in concert with its close homologs PUB23 and PUB24 in the regulation of PAMP-triggered responses (CITATION). We therefore tested PUB23C18A and PUB24C30A, inactive ligase mutant variants. In both cases, they were able to complement fluorescence in the presence of cYFP-Exo70B2, suggesting that they also interact in vivo (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). PUBs act as scaffolds by bringing the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and the target protein into close proximity, thus mediating ubiquitination and conveying specificity to the process (CITATION). Our data suggested that the interaction between PUB22 and Exo70B2 does not require an external stimulus, such as PAMPs, and is therefore to some extent constitutive. We previously showed that PUB22 is an active ubiquitin ligase with the ability to autoubiquitinate (CITATION). Autoubiquitination activity can lead to protein degradation by the 26S proteasome (CITATION). To test whether autocatalytic ubiquitination mediates PUB22 stability, we expressed HA-PUB22 and an inactive mutant variant HA-PUB22C13A, which is unable to bind ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. This mutant accumulated to much higher levels than wild-type PUB22, indicating that autocatalytic ubiquitination may indeed occur and result in degradation (Figure 3A). A logical consequence of this observation would be that PUB22 must be stabilized in order to be able to ubiquitinate its target with high efficiency. We therefore tested whether treatment with flg22, the conserved epitope of the bacterial PAMP flagellin, led to the stabilization of PUB22. Indeed, the abundance of PUB22 increased markedly 1 h after treatment with flg22 (Figure 3A). Inhibition of the 26S proteasome also increased PUB22 abundance, indicating that it mediates PUB22 turnover (Figure 3A). Since PUB22 is involved in the regulation of early PAMP-triggered responses, we analyzed the kinetics of its stabilization. Treatment with flg22 resulted in the transient accumulation of PUB22, which became evident as early as 5 min after treatment and decreased back to basal levels after 180 min (Figure 3B). Proteasome inhibition also resulted in a rapid increase of PUB22 levels, which in contrast with the results of flg22 treatment, remained high at 3 h after treatment (Figure 3B). Therefore, PAMP-mediated PUB22 stabilization potentially represents a regulatory mechanism of target ubiquitination. [[FIGURE]] We next assayed the ability of PUB22 to use Exo70B2 as a substrate in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. In the presence of all required components, recombinant GST-PUB22 ubiquitinated MBP-Exo70B2, as evidenced by the increase in the molecular size of the target (Figure 4A). No ubiquitination was detectable in absence of any of the required components. Furthermore, a point mutation in a conserved amino acid in the PUB22 U-box domain abolished ubiquitination of MBP-Exo70B2 (Figure 4A). Thus, MBP-Exo70B2 can be used as a substrate by GST-PUB22. Moreover, the presence of Exo70B2 reduced PUB22 autoubiquitination in vitro (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). [[FIGURE]] We then assayed Exo70B2 levels after PAMP perception in vivo. Treatment with flg22 induced the gradual reduction of cMyc-Exo70B2 within the first 60 min (Figure 4B). By contrast, protein levels remained unchanged in the pub22 pub23 pub24 triple mutant background. Moreover, overall Exo70B2 protein accumulation was higher in the pub triple mutant background compared with the wild type (Figure 4B). To rule out that this was a general effect, we examined the protein accumulation of cMyc-Exo70A1, an Exo70B2 homolog that does not interact with PUB22 (Figure 1A). Exo70A1 accumulation was independent of the genetic background and was not altered by flg22 treatment (Figure 4B). We next analyzed the effect of PUB22 specifically on Exo70B2 levels. Coexpression of the full-length cMyc-nYFP-PUB22 and cYFP-Exo70B2 resulted in a weak complementation of fluorescence (Figures 4C and 4D). Surprisingly, flg22 treatment did not lead to major changes in the number of cells displaying fluorescence (Figure 4D). However, Exo70B2 protein levels moderately decreased, in line with previous results (Figure 4E). PUB22 levels, on the other hand, displayed a clear increase, as it was stabilized by flg22 (Figure 4E). Hence, the absence of clear changes in cells displaying fluorescence reflects the increase of PUB22 levels. Accordingly, inhibition of the 26S proteasome or coexpression with an inactive PUB22C13A mutant resulted in higher levels of Exo70B2 (Figure 4E) and a higher number of cells with fluorescence (Figure 4D). Together, these data indicate that Exo70B2 is a ubiquitination substrate of PUB22 and that Exo70B2 ubiquitination by PUB22 leads to its degradation in vivo. This process is potentially regulated by the stability of PUB22 through autocatalytic ubiquitination leading to its degradation, which is inhibited by treatment with flg22. To determine whether Exo70B2 plays a role in PTI, we analyzed independent T-DNA insertion mutant lines (exo70B2-1, SALK_091877; and exo70B2-3, GK-726G07; see Supplemental Figure 4A online). Both alleles do not display any obvious developmental defects; flowering and seed yield under normal growth conditions are comparable to wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0), similar to the previously described pub22 pub23 pub24 mutant (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). Because PUB22 was defined genetically as a negative regulator of PTI and it targets Exo70B2 for degradation, we predicted that Exo70B2 acts as a positive regulator of PTI. Thus, exo70B2 null mutants should display attenuated PTI. To test this, we first assayed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Perception of flg22 is mediated by the PRR FLS2 (CITATION). Activation of FLS2 leads to an oxidative burst, one of the first measurable responses of plants in response to PAMP perception (CITATION). Mutation of pub22, pub23, and pub24 additively derepresses this response, which is strongest in the pub22 pub23 pub24 triple mutant (CITATION). As predicted, both exo70B2 alleles were less sensitive than wild-type Col-0 to flg22, as evidenced by a reduced production of ROS (Figure 5A). This indicates that Exo70B2 functions as a positive regulator of signaling in immunity and supports the idea that it contributes to the enhanced responsiveness of the pub triple mutant. Derepressed responses in pub22 pub23 pub24 extended to all tested PAMPs and also oligogalacturonides (CITATION). Correspondingly, the oxidative burst was compromised in exo70B2 in response to all tested elicitors, including elf18, the conserved epitope of bacterial transcription factor EF-Tu (CITATION); chitin, a cell wall component of fungi (CITATION; CITATION); and Pep1, an endogenous DAMP (Figure 5A; CITATION). This also indicates that Exo70B2 is involved in the regulation of signaling mediated by different PRRs, independently of BAK1 because BAK1-indepenent chitin responses were also affected (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] We further confirmed a function of Exo70B2 in early PAMP responses by testing MAPK activity after flg22 elicitation. exo70B2-3 plants exhibited reduced MAPK3 activity compared with Col-0 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). Thus, exo70B2 mutants displayed reduced PAMP-triggered signaling in all early signaling markers, which is the opposite of the pub22 pub23 pub24 mutant (CITATION). Later responses to PAMP perception include the transcriptional activation of genes involved in immunity (CITATION). Similar to the decreased oxidative burst and MAPK activity, the transcriptional response in exo70B2 to flg22 was reduced for five PTI marker genes: At4g20780 (encoding a Ca2+ binding protein), RbohD (encoding an NADPH oxidase), and the transcription factor genes WRKY11, WRKY22, and WRKY29 (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the induction of PR1, a marker gene for the salicylic acid pathway, was also compromised after infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst; Figure 5C). To assay the impact on sustained flg22-triggered FLS2 signaling, we tested the root growth inhibition by flg22. Wild-type Col plants displayed a 40.1% decrease in root growth compared with untreated controls, consistent with previous reports (CITATION). Enhanced PTI signaling in pub22 pub23 pub24 resulted in a stronger growth inhibition of 62%. In line with the previous data, root growth inhibition in exo70B2 mutants was distinctly reduced to almost half compared with the wild type, with 20.8 in exo70B2-1 and 23.5 in exo70B2-3 (Figure 5D), further demonstrating the importance of Exo70B2 in PAMP-triggered signaling. Nevertheless, exo70B2 mutants displayed mild phenotypes for some of the assayed responses. We hypothesized that this is due to overlapping function of homologs, such as Exo70B1, which shows the highest sequence similarity (53% amino acid identity; Figure 1A). To test this, we generated exo70B1 alleles and the exo70B1-1 exo70B2-1 double mutant (see Supplemental Figure 6A online). exo70B1 mutants showed a reduction of the flg22-triggered ROS production (see Supplemental Figure 6B online). However, this phenotype was not significantly enhanced in exo70B1-1 exo70B2-1 double mutants when compared with exo70B1 alleles. Similarly, root growth inhibition by flg22 in exo70B1-1 was reduced in comparison to the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 6C online). Nevertheless, the double mutant phenotype was also comparable to exo70B2-1, indicating that Exo70B1 and Exo70B2 apparently do not functionally overlap, although both are required for PTI signaling. To assay further the role of Exo70B2 in immunity, we analyzed phenotypes of exo70B2 in response to infection by pathogens of Arabidopsis. To mimic a natural Pst infection, we spray-inoculated plants, which allows the detection of resistance phenotypes related to PAMP perception, as previously shown for FLS2 receptor-like kinase mutants (CITATION). As reported previously, pub22 pub23 pub24 plants were more resistant to the virulent Pst as a consequence of the hyperactivation of immune responses, which result from derepressed PAMP-triggered signaling (Figure 6A). By contrast, both exo70B2 alleles were immunocompromised and showed a clear increase in the bacterial growth (Figure 6A). This was also reflected by the stronger development of disease symptoms, such as leaf yellowing (Figure 6B). [[FIGURE]] Activation of immunity by PAMPs prior to infection has a protective effect by priming immune responses for posterior infection (CITATION). This is manifested by reduced growth of virulent Pst in plants that have been pretreated with flg22. We performed this experiment with exo70B2 plants and observed that the mutants displayed an enhanced bacterial growth in comparison to the wild-type parent (Figure 7). Thus, the protective effect of flg22 pretreatment prior to infection with Pst was less effective in exo70B2 plants. [[FIGURE]] To complement our analysis, we challenged mutant plants with the obligate biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) isolate Emco5, which is virulent on wild-type Col-0 (CITATION). exo70B2 plants exhibited an enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype compared with Col-0 (Figure 8A). This result indicates that Exo70B2 plays an important role in immunity against bacterial and oomycete pathogens (Figures 6A and 8A). [[FIGURE]] The pub22 pub23 pub24 plants display enhanced cell death in response to Hpa infection (CITATION). By contrast, exo70B2 plants were not able to mount the same degree of cell death as the wild type (Figures 8B and 8C). Cell death foci, as detected by Trypan blue staining, were divided into three categories according to size. The size of cell death foci in exo70B2 plants was reduced, as seen by a 20% reduction of cotyledons with moderate size lesions and a corresponding increase in those with small lesions (Figures 8B and 8C). Because cell death is normally associated with effector-triggered immunity, our observations support a model in which PTI is mechanistically similar to effector-triggered immunity and, therefore, that PAMP signaling can induce cell death, as previously proposed (CITATION). Together, Exo70B2 contributes to the activation of PTI during pathogen invasion and to the activation of cell death during Hpa infection. If Exo70B2 is a target of PUB22, then the exo70B2 mutant should partially suppress the phenotypes of the pub22 pub23 pub24 triple mutant. To address this hypothesis, we generated a pub22 pub23 pub24 exo70B2-1 quadruple mutant that we used to test epistasis. Bacterial growth was higher in the quadruple mutant than in the pub22 pub23 pub24 parent, indicating that exo70B2 was able to suppress partially the enhanced resistance phenotype of the triple mutant (Figure 6A). Moreover, the oxidative burst triggered by flg22 was also reduced in pub22 pub23 pub24 exo70B2-1 compared with pub22 pub23 pub24 (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). In addition, a similar, although mild, epistatic effect of exo70B2 on pub22 pub23 pub24 was present in the root growth inhibition (Figure 5D). Suppression of tested responses was only partial, suggesting additional important targets that participate in PAMP-triggered responses. The genetic interaction of Exo70B2 with pub22 pub23 pub24 underscores its importance in PTI, while at the same time it reveals a higher order complexity highlighted by the manifold ligase and target homologs and potentially additional targets yet to be identified.
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana exo70B2-1 (SALK091877), exo70B2-3 (GK726G07), exo70B1-1 (GK114C03), and exo70B1-2 (GK156G02) mutants (Col-0 background) were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The pub22 pub23 pub24 mutant was previously described (CITATION). All plants for pathogen inoculation experiments, oxidative burst assays, and transient transformation via microbombardment were grown at 21Â°C and 70% relative humidity under short-day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark). exo70B1 alleles and exo70B1-1/exo70B2-1 for ROS assays were grown under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark). For sterile conditions, seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar media supplemented with vitamins and 1% Suc at 22Â°C in short-day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark). Protoplasts were isolated from 5-week-old plants as previously described (CITATION). Y2H screening was performed by Hybrigenics. The coding sequence for amino acids 76 to 435 of PUB22 (At3G52450) was cloned into pB27 as a C-terminal fusion to LexA (N-LexA-prolyl 4-hydroxylase-C) and transformed into the yeast strain L40. A random-primed Arabidopsis (wild-type Col-0) 1-week-old seedling cDNA library constructed into pP6 was transformed into yeast strain Y187. After mating, 62.4 million clones (6.2-fold the complexity of the library) were screened. Prey fragments of the positive clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced at 5â€² and 3â€² junctions. The resulting sequences were used to identify the corresponding interacting proteins in the GenBank database (National Center for Biotechnology Information) using a fully automated procedure. PUB22, PUB22C13A, PUB22ARM, and PUB22U-box were cloned into pESPYNEgw (nYFP) and Exo70B2 into pESPYCEgw (cYFP; CITATION) via LR reaction (Invitrogen). Constructs were transformed in mesophyll protoplasts as described previously (CITATION). Plasmid DNA (1 Âµg/ÂµL) of each construct was mixed with mCherry coding construct (1 Âµg/ÂµL), and 100 Âµg total DNA was used to transform 1 mL of mesophyll protoplasts derived from 5- to 6-week-old plants. Reconstitution of split YFP was assessed by confocal imaging 1 d after transformation. For imaging, a LSM710 (Zeiss) was employed with the following settings: YFP excitation, 488 nm; emission band pass, 505 to 550 nm; red fluorescent protein (RFP) excitation, 543 nm; and emission band pass, 560 to 615 nm. Flg22 treatment and inhibition of the 26S proteasome was performed 1 d after transformation. For proteasome inhibition 20 ÂµM AM114 (Calbiochem) was used. Confocal imaging was conducted 1 h after flg22 treatment and 3 h after proteasome inhibition. To analyze protein levels, protoplasts were pelleted (200g, 1min) and resuspended in protein extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 8 M urea, 30% glycerol, 0.1 M DTT, and 0.005% OrangeG). After denaturing (65Â°C, 10 min) samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein gel blots using anti-cMyc (Sigma-Aldrich) and polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP; Invitrogen) antibodies. cMyc-tagged Exo70B2 and HA-tagged PUB22 constructs were generated by cloning the coding sequences into pGWB418 and pGWB415 (CITATION) via LR reaction (Invitrogen). Constructs were transformed in protoplasts (50 Âµg DNA/1 mL protoplasts), and protein levels were assessed as described above using anti-cMyc and anti-HA (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. cMyc-tagged Exo70B2 and YFP-tagged PUB22C13A under the control of a 35S promoter were generated by cloning the coding sequence of PUB22C13A into pGWB418 (CITATION) and pEARLEYGATE104 (CITATION) via LR reaction (Invitrogen). Constructs were transformed in mesophyll protoplasts as described in the Supplemental Methods 1 online. For Immunoprecipitation, 1 mL of transfected protoplasts were pelleted (200g, 1min) and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 ÂµM ZnCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 ÂµM AM114, 100 ÂµM 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 15 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (15.000g, 10 min), and the supernatant was incubated with anti-cMyc beads (Clontech) for 3 h at 4Â°C with gentle shaking. Beads were collected and washed five times with extraction buffer. Proteins were eluted with 2Ã— LDS buffer (12.5 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, and 0.005% OrangeG) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-cMyc (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-GFP (Invitrogen) antibodies. Leaf discs (0.125 cm2) of 7-week-old plants were incubated overnight in water in a 96-well titer plate using one leaf disc per well. ROS produced by leaf discs were measured by a luminol-based assay (20 Âµg/mL horseradish peroxidase and 30 Âµg/mL luminol). Luminescence is shown as relative light units and was measured with a 1450 Micro Beta Jet Luminescence Counter (Perkin-Elmer) and signal integration time of 2 s. Total RNA was extracted using TriFast peqGOLD (Peqlab) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Two micrograms of DNaseI (Fermentas) treated RNA was reverse transcribed with Maxima Reverse transcriptase following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Fermentas). Real-Time quantitative PCR was performed using the Maxima SYBR Green mix (Fermentas) in a CFX384 qPCR System (Bio-Rad). Gene induction was calculated using the Bio-Rad software. Reaction volume was 20 Î¼L and contained 10 Î¼L of the reaction mix, 0.5 nmol of each primer, and 2 Î¼L of cDNA. PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min incubation at 50Â°C and 3 min denaturation at 95Â°C followed by 45 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 s, 60Â°C for 10 s, and 72Â°C for 20 s. Subsequently, a dissociation curve was performed. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Seeds were sterilized and grown on 1Ã— MS agar media supplemented with vitamins and 1% Suc. Seeds were stratified at 4Â°C for 2 d and grown for 5 d in short-day conditions vertically (8 h light/16 h dark). Seedlings were then transplanted on square Petri dishes with MS agar media supplemented with flg22 (1 ÂµM) or DMSO (0.01%). Length of the main root was scored 7 d after transfer root growth was measured using Image J software. For bacterial growth experiments, 6-week-old plants were spray inoculated with a solution of 5 Ã— 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL Pst as described by CITATION. Bacterial growth was measured 4 d after inoculation. To analyze flg22-induced resistance effect, 6-week old plants were infiltrated with 100 nm flg22. After 24 h, the same leaves were challenged by infiltrating 1 Ã— 105 cfu/mL Pst DC3000. Bacterial growth was assessed 2 d after inoculation. Hpa isolate Emco5 infections were performed as described (CITATION) with suspensions of 5 Ã— 104 spores/mL, sprayed on 2-week-old seedlings under short-day conditions and scored 2 weeks after infection by counting sporangiophores. For the visualization of cell death, plants were briefly boiled in a 50% ethanol trypan blue-lactophenol solution and cleared with chloral hydrate overnight as described. For pull-downs, recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli lysates were immobilized on amylose resins (New England Biolabs), incubated for 1 h at 4Â°C with E. coli lysate containing interacting partner, eluted, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The generation of the GST-PUB22, GST-PUB23, and GST-PUB24 fusion constructs and mutant variants and purification was performed as previously described (CITATION). Exo70B2 was cloned into pMAL-c2X using EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. Recombinant MBP-Exo70B2 proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Recombinant His-UBA1 and His-UBC8 were purified using Ni-Ted resin (Macherey-Nagel). Purified proteins were used for in vitro ubiquitination assays. Each reaction of 30 Î¼L final volume contained 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 200 ng E1 His-UBA1, 200 ng E2 His-UBC8, 500 ng of E3s, and 1 Âµg of MBP-Exo70B2. The reactions were incubated at 30Â°C for 3 h and stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubating for 5 min at 65Â°C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using 7% SDS-PAGE followed by detection of ubiquitinated substrate by immunoblotting using anti-MBP (New England Biolabs) and antiubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. An alignment between Arabidopsis Exo70 proteins (available as Supplemental Data Set 1 online) was generated using ClustalW with a Blosum62 cost matrix, and the tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method, with bootstrap values (1000 replicates) shown as percentages.
