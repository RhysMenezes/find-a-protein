!~ABS~! ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) is a basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, central for the regulation of seedling photomorphogenesis. Here, we identified a B-BOX (BBX)–containing protein, BBX25/SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG, as an interacting partner of HY5, which has been previously found to physically interact with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1). BBX25 physically interacts with HY5 both in vitro and in vivo. By physiological and genetic approaches, we showed that BBX25 is a negative regulator of seedling photomorphogenesis. BBX25 and its homolog BBX24 regulate deetiolation processes and hypocotyl shade avoidance response in an additive manner. Moreover, genetic relationships of bbx25 and bbx24 with hy5 and cop1 revealed that BBX25 and BBX24 additively enhance COP1 and suppress HY5 functions. BBX25 accumulates in a light-dependent manner and undergoes COP1-mediated degradation in dark and light conditions. Furthermore, a protoplast cotransfection assay showed that BBX24 and BBX25 repress BBX22 expression by interfering with HY5 transcriptional activity. As HY5 binds to the BBX22 promoter and promotes its expression, our results identify a direct mechanism through which the expression of BBX22 is regulated. We suggest that BBX25 and BBX24 function as transcriptional corepressors, probably by forming inactive heterodimers with HY5, downregulating BBX22 expression for the fine-tuning of light-mediated seedling development.
!~RES~! BBX21, BBX22, and BBX24 have been reported to physically and genetically interact with HY5 (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since BBX25 shares 69% amino acid sequence similarity with BBX24, we examined whether BBX25 also interacts with HY5 using full-length and truncated versions of BBX25/HY5 (Figures 1A and 1B). Expression of full-length and mutated versions of BBX25 and full-length HY5 were confirmed by immunoblotting (see Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B online). BBX25 expressed together with Gal4-DBD alone did not activate transcription, but, when expressed with Gal4-DBD-HY5, resulted in an ∼28-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity compared with that of the vector control (Figure 1C). Previous reports suggest that the B-boxes in BBX21 and BBX22 are necessary for the interaction with HY5 (CITATION, CITATION). To see whether the B-boxes in BBX25 were also required for the interaction with HY5, we individually substituted two conserved Asp residues in the B-boxes to Ala. The substituted proteins in BBX25 were named D20A, D72A and D20A, and D72A (Figure 1A). Whereas the substitution in D20A resulted in a drastic reduction in β-galactosidase activity, substitutions in D72A and D20A and D72A resulted in complete abolition of the interaction compared with wild-type levels (Figure 1C). Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, in vitro pull-down assays also demonstrated that BBX25 interacts with HY5. These assays showed that HY5 was not able to pull down the mutated versions of BBX25 (D20A, D72A and D20A, and D72A) but that it was able to pull down wild-type BBX25 (Figure 1D). These results suggest that BBX25 interacts with HY5 through its B-boxes. [[FIGURE]] To determine the subcellular localization of BBX25 and to further characterize its interactions with HY5, we examined whether BBX25 physically interacts with HY5 in the nucleus using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to BBX25 and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused to HY5 were coexpressed in onion epidermal cells and checked for the occurrence of FRET. The bleaching of the acceptor (YFP-HY5) resulted in an increased emission from CFP-BBX25 (Figures 1E, bottom panel, and 1F), indicating that FRET had occurred between the two proteins prior to the bleach. However, in control photobleaching experiments using the same microscope settings, we detected no FRET between untagged CFP and YFP (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Furthermore, to map which domain of HY5 is responsible for the interaction with BBX25, we used different truncated versions of HY5 (ΔZIP, ΔbZIP, and ΔN77) fused to the DNA binding domain Gal4-DBD (Figure 1B). Expression of the truncated versions of HY5 was confirmed by immunoblot (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). Quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase activity indicated that BBX25 strongly interacts with the full-length version of HY5 and the ΔN77 truncated version of HY5 (Figure 1F). However, deletion of the bZIP domain (either ΔZIP or ΔbZIP) in HY5 resulted in a drastic reduction of β-galactosidase activity (Figure 1G), suggesting that the bZIP domain of HY5 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction with BBX25. Collectively, the results from yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and FRET experiments demonstrate that BBX25 physically interacts with HY5. To examine the physiological role of BBX25 in light-mediated seedling development, we obtained two independent T-DNA insertion lines for BBX25 and designated them as bbx25-1 (SAIL_786_F08) and bbx25-2 (SM_3.17575). Genotyping and sequencing of both T-DNA lines revealed that bbx25-1 and bbx25-2 have T-DNA insertions in the promoter and in the first intron of the gene, respectively (Figure 2A). The RNA gel blot results showed that the bbx25-2 mutant carried a null allele of BBX25, whereas the bbx25-1 mutant showed reduced expression of BBX25 transcripts compared with the Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild type (Figure 2B). Since BBX25 expression is light modulated (CITATION), we monitored the expression of BBX25 in 4-d-old dark-grown wild-type and bbx25-1 seedlings exposed to white light (WL) between 0 and 10 h. In wild-type seedlings, BBX25 transcripts were 50-fold increased at 1 h of light, reached 90-fold maximum expression at 4 h of light, and then gradually decreased (Figure 3C). By contrast, the bbx25-1 mutant showed a reduced fivefold increase at 1 h of light and the 40-fold expression peak was detected after 8 h of light (Figure 3C). In addition, 4-d-old bbx25-1 seedlings grown in constant WL accumulated half of the wild-type transcripts, providing further evidence for a reduced BBX25 activity in the bbx25-1 mutant (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). These results indicate that bbx25-1 is a reduced functional allele of BBX25. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To carry out a detailed phenotypic analysis of the role of BBX25 in response to light, we studied the phenotypes of BBX25-overexpressing lines (OE1 and OE2;, see Supplemental Figure 3B online) and mutants (bbx25-1 and bbx25-2). Col-0, bbx25-1, bbx25-2, OE1, and OE2 seedlings were grown in different light conditions for 6 d to examine the hypocotyl length. bbx25-1 and bbx25-2 seedlings displayed significantly shorter hypocotyls, whereas BBX25-overexpressing lines showed larger hypocotyls than Col-0 seedlings in WL (Figures 2D and 2E) and monochromatic light conditions (R, FR, and blue light [BL]; see Supplemental Figure 4 online). We concluded that BBX25 is directly involved in light signaling and functions as a negative regulator of seedling photomorphogenesis irrespective of light quality. To see whether BBX25 has functions overlapping with those of BBX24, we generated (see Supplemental Figure 5 online) and characterized a bbx25-2 bbx24-1 double mutant. The hypocotyl of bbx25-2 bbx24-1 double mutant seedlings was significantly shorter than that of each of the single mutants, thus suggesting an additive genetic interaction between BBX24 and BBX25 independently of the light treatment (Figures 3A to 3D). In addition, 5-d-old wild-type seedlings showed low levels of anthocyanin in all light conditions, whereas bbx24 and bbx25 single mutant seedlings showed an increase of 30% in their anthocyanin levels and bbx25-2 bbx24-1 double mutant seedlings an increase of >300% compared with wild-type seedlings (Figures 3E to 3H). Again, the stronger enhancement of anthocyanin accumulation in bbx25-2 bbx24-1 compared with single mutants indicates that BBX25 and BBX24 act additively. To investigate the genetic relationship between BBX25 and HY5, we generated a homozygous bbx25-2 hy5-215 double mutant. Whereas hy5-215 seedlings showed longer hypocotyls than wild-type seedlings, bbx25-2 hy5-215 double mutant seedlings showed slightly but significantly shorter hypocotyls than hy5-215 in WL and even in R and BL (Figure 4A; see Supplemental Figure 6 online). These data suggest that BBX25 function is partially HY5 dependent. To understand this phenomenon further, we generated a bbx25-2 bbx24-1 hy5-215 triple mutant. The triple mutant had significantly shorter hypocotyls than the bbx25-2 hy5-215 double mutant in WL and different monochromatic light conditions (Figure 4A; see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Taken together, these results suggest that both bbx25-2 and bbx24-1 can partially and additively suppress the hy5-215 hypocotyl phenotype. [[FIGURE]] Since the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 double mutant accumulates significantly more anthocyanin than the single mutants (Figures 3E to 3H), we wanted to know whether enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in the double mutant is HY5 dependent. Although the anthocyanin content in hy5-215 is extremely low in WL, the absence of BBX25 and/or BBX24 in the hy5 background induces the accumulation of anthocyanin, achieving wild-type levels in the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 hy5-215 triple mutant (Figure 4B). By contrast, the anthocyanin content was comparable to that of hy5 in double and triple mutant seedlings grown under monochromatic light conditions (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). Expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, such as CHS and CHI, further confirms the anthocyanin content results. Col-0 seedlings grown in the dark for 4 d and then treated with WL for 1 and 2 h showed increased expression of CHS and CHI (Figures 4C and 4D). In the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 double mutant, the expression of both genes was two- to threefold higher than that of the wild type, and null expression was detected in the hy5-215 single mutant. Moreover, bbx24-1 bbx25-2 hy5-215 triple mutant seedlings showed a slight but significant recovery of CHS and CHI expression compared with hy5-215 but not under R, FR, and BL conditions (Figures 4C and 4D; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). These results suggest that BBX25 and BBX24 regulate anthocyanin gene expression in a HY5-dependent manner. Since COP1 is a central negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, we investigated whether bbx25 alone and together with bbx24 influence the cop1 phenotype. We used two weak cop1 alleles, cop1-4 and cop1-6, to generate bbx25-2 cop1-4 and bbx25-2 cop1-6 double mutants. Five-day-old dark-grown cop1 seedlings displayed a strong photomorphogenic phenotype, whereas the hypocotyls of bbx25-2 bbx24-1 and of their respective single mutants were indistinguishable from the wild-type ones (Figure 5A). By contrast, bbx25-2 cop1-4 and bbx25-2 cop1-6 seedlings showed shorter hypocotyls than cop1-4 and cop1-6 (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Figure 9A online). To further investigate the genetic action of BBX24 and BBX25 on COP1 signaling, we constructed bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-4 and bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-6 triple mutants. Five-day-old dark-grown seedlings of bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-4 and bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-6 showed hypocotyls 61 and 49% shorter, respectively, than their corresponding cop1 single mutants (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Figure 9A online). Similar results were found when seedlings were grown in different light conditions (Figure 5B; see Supplemental Figure 9B online). These results demonstrate that bbx25-2 and bbx24-1 additively enhance the cop1 hypocotyl phenotype in dark and light conditions. [[FIGURE]] The cop1 mutant accumulates more anthocyanin in both dark and light conditions (CITATION). While neither the bbx24-1 nor the bbx25-2 single mutants showed altered anthocyanin levels, the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 double mutant accumulated slightly but significantly more anthocyanin than the wild type in the dark (Figure 5C). Even more, bbx25-2 cop1-4 and bbx25-2 cop1-6 double mutants showed an increase of 175 and 163% in anthocyanin content, respectively, and the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-4 and the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-6 triple mutants showed an increase of 344 and 288% in anthocyanin content over their respective cop1 alleles (Figure 5C). The anthocyanin levels correlated well with the accumulation of CHS and CHI transcripts in 5-d-old dark-grown seedlings (Figures 5D and 5E). These results demonstrate that BBX25 and BBX24 act additively in the COP1 signaling pathway of hypocotyl length, anthocyanin accumulation, and gene expression. To know how BBX25 protein stability is regulated and whether or not COP1 has any role in the modulation of its stability, we generated transgenic lines overexpressing GFP-BBX25 in Col-0 and cop1-6 mutant background. Overexpression of GFP-BBX25 in the cop1-6 background but not in Col-0 led to longer hypocotyls in the dark (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were either mock treated with DMSO or treated with the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 and then kept in the dark for 1 h more. Immunoblot experiments showed that BBX25 fusion protein was clearly visible in the MG132-treated seedlings but not in mock-treated seedlings. Similarly, when 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings were treated with 2 and 4 h of WL, the BBX25 fusion protein was found to be more stable with MG132 than that of the mock-treated seedlings, suggesting that MG132 can block the degradation of BBX25 even in light conditions (Figure 6A). To know whether BBX25 degradation is mediated by COP1, we examined the BBX25 fusion protein in cop1-6 mutant background. Four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were either mock treated or treated with MG132 and incubated either in the dark or WL for 1 h and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The BBX25 fusion protein was clearly visible in both dark- and WL-grown seedlings either mock treated or treated with MG132 (Figure 6B), indicating that COP1 is mediating BBX25 degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the increased stability of BBX25 in cop1 mutant background is not due to an increase in BBX24 transcript levels (Figure 6C). [[FIGURE]] In order to find target genes of BBX24 and BBX25, we analyzed the expression of light-regulated genes like BBX18-BBX23, HY5, and HYH in 4-d dark-grown Col-0 and bbx24-1 bbx25-2 seedlings treated with WL for 2 and 4 h. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that among the genes tested, only BBX22 showed significantly higher expression in bbx25-2 bbx24-1 than in Col-0 seedlings (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). These results suggest that BBX25 and BBX24 together negatively regulate the expression of BBX22. Previously, it has been shown that HY5 promotes the expression of BBX22 by directly binding to its promoter (CITATION) and that COP1 ubiquitylates and degrades BBX22 protein in the dark (CITATION; CITATION). Furthermore, BBX22 physically and genetically interacts with HY5 and enhances the function of HY5 by regulating hypocotyl growth and anthocyanin accumulation (CITATION; CITATION). To study in detail how the expression of BBX22 could be affected in both bbx25-1 and bbx24-2 single and double mutants, we monitored the expression of BBX22 in seedlings exposed to WL between 0 and 24 h. BBX22 expression increased in a light-dependent manner, with a peak at around 6 h, and then decreased to levels similar to those at 0 h (Figure 7A). Whereas the induction of BBX22 in both bbx24-1 and bbx25-2 single mutants was found to be slightly elevated compared with Col-0, the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 double mutant showed nearly twofold higher BBX22 accumulation than single mutants, suggesting that BBX25 and BBX24 act additively to downregulate the expression of BBX22. [[FIGURE]] Next, we asked whether the negative regulation of BBX22 by BBX25 and BBX24 is through the altered stability of HY5 and/or COP1. Protein extracts of Col-0, bbx25, bbx24, and bbx24 bbx25 double mutants of 4-d-old WL-grown seedlings were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Neither HY5 nor COP1 was altered in the single and double mutants compared with Col-0 (Figure 7B), suggesting that the increased expression of BBX22 in the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 double mutant is independent of HY5 and COP1 protein levels. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the negative regulation of BBX22 could be due to an altered HY5 action. To this end, we fused 1000 bp of the BBX22 promoter to the luciferase reporter gene. The ProBBX22:LUC reporter was transfected into mesophyll protoplasts along with Pro35S:RnLUC (an internal control of transformation efficiency) and the effectors Pro35S:HY5, Pro35S:BBX25, Pro35S:BBX25(D72A), and Pro35S:BBX24 in different combinations (Figure 8A). The BBX22 promoter activity was null for the vector control, BBX24, BBX25, BBX25(D72A), and BBX24 BBX25 effectors (Figure 8B). However, the cotransfection of HY5 and BBX25(D72A) with ProBBX22:LUC resulted in ∼20-fold activation of the BBX22 promoter, whereas the cotransfection of HY5 with either BBX25 or BXB24 moderately induced the BBX22 promoter activity (Figure 8B). These results suggest BBX25 and BBX24 repress the activation of BBX22 promoter activity by interfering with HY5 action. Since both BBX25 and BBX24 physically interact with HY5 through its bZIP domain, they probably reduce the function of HY5 by forming inactive heterodimers. In fact, the results demonstrate that the mutated version of BBX25 is not able to form heterodimers with HY5. [[FIGURE]] SAS is an adaptive strategy that triggers plant elongation responses in low R:FR light to escape from shade and reach out to the sunlight. BBX21 and BBX22 act as negative factors for hypocotyl growth in dark conditions (CITATION). Furthermore, the bbx21 bbx22 cop1 triple mutant can partially restore the SAS phenotype, suggesting that BBX21 and BBX22 together interact genetically and antagonistically with COP1 under SAS (CITATION). To understand the genetic relationship between BBX25 and BBX24 with HY5 and COP1 in the SAS pathway, we studied the single, double and triple mutant phenotypes under simulated shade conditions. In high R:FR light, bbx24-1 and bbx25-2 displayed hypocotyl elongation similar to that of the wild type. However, bbx24-1 but not bbx25-2 mutants showed significantly shorter hypocotyls than Col-0 seedlings in low R:FR (Figure 9A). Furthermore, the bbx24-1 bbx25-2 double mutant is significantly shorter than bbx24-1 specifically under shade conditions. These results suggest that BBX24 and BBX25 are partially redundant in the promotion of the hypocotyl shade avoidance response. In addition, hy5-215 and bbx24-1 bbx25-2 hy5-215 seedlings had longer hypocotyls than the wild type both in high and low R:FR, suggesting that HY5 is not involved in hypocotyl elongation by shade. We also explored the genetic relationship between COP1, BBX24, and BBX25. cop1-4 and cop1-6 seedlings displayed significantly shorter hypocotyls than wild-type ones both in high and low R:FR, and bbx24 and/or bbx25 mutations in cop1 backgrounds displayed the same phenotypes as cop1, indicating that the functions of BBX24 and BBX25 under shade are completely dependent on COP1 (Figure 9B). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The mutants used in this study were bbx25-1 (SAIL_786_F08), bbx25-2 (SM_3.17575), and bbx24-1 (Salk_067473). The bbx24-1, bbx25-1, bbx25-2, hy5-215, cop1-4, and cop1-6 alleles are in the Col-0 accession. Seeds were surface sterilized and plated on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.8% Bactoagar (BD Biosciences) and 1% Suc. The plates were then cold treated at 4°C for 3 d and then transferred to light chambers maintained at 22°C with the desired wavelength and intensity of light. For all monochromatic light assays, the plates were transferred to continuous WL for 3 h to induce uniform germination. The plates were then transferred to monochromatic light conditions, incubated at 22°C for the indicated number of days, and measured essentially as previously described (CITATION, CITATION). Physiological experiments were repeated two or three times, and only a representative one is shown. For genotyping of homozygous bbx25-1, the T-DNA primer LB3 was used along with gene-specific primers BBX25LP and BBX25RP, whereas for bbx25-2 genotyping, transposon-specific primer Spm1 was used along with gene-specific primers BBX25LP and BBX25RP. For homozygous bbx24-1 genotyping, the T-DNA primer LBb1 was used along with gene-specific primers BBX24LP and BBX24RP (see Supplemental Table 1 online). For the generation of double and triple mutants, first, bbx25-2 and bbx24-1 were crossed to generate the bbx25-2 bbx24-1 double mutant. The bbx25-2 bbx24-1 double mutant was crossed with cop1-4, cop1-6, and hy5-215 to obtain F1. Through phenotyping and genotyping of F2 plants, we identified different double (bbx25-2 cop1-4, bbx25-2 cop1-6, bbx24-1 cop1-4, bbx24-1 cop1-6, and bbx25-2 hy5-215) and triple (bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-4, bbx24-1 bbx25-2 cop1-6, and bbx24-1 bbx25-2 hy5-215) mutant combinations. To generate transgenic lines overexpressing BBX25, the full-length BBX25 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from cDNA of 4-d-old light-grown Col-0 seedlings using the primers BBX25OEFP and BBX25OERP (see Supplemental Figure 1 online) and cloned into the pAVA321 vector with NcoI-BglII sites. The expression cassette was subcloned into the pPZP222 binary vector, which was then transformed into the GV3101 Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then into Col-0 plants by the floral dip method (CITATION). In T3 plants, several independent transgenic lines carrying a single-copy transgene were identified, and two of them (OE1 and OE2) were selected for further analysis. For yeast two-hybrid experiments, we cloned full-length and mutated versions of BBX25 (BBX25D20A and BBX25D72A) and BBX25 (D20A and D72A) cDNA into the yeast expression vector pYX141 and full-length HY5 cDNA into the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-DBD) vector pAS2-1 (see Supplemental Table 1 online for primers). The constructs used for HY5 are described elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION). We confirmed the expression of different wild-type and mutated versions of BBX25 proteins by immunoblotting, using polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against full-length BBX25. Meanwhile, full-length and truncated versions of HY5 proteins were examined by immunoblotting using anti-Gal4-DBD antibody. The β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by CITATION in yeast strain Y187. For the FRET acceptor photobleaching experiments, the pAM- PAT-35SS-YFP-HY5 (CITATION) and pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-BBX25 constructs were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment and incubated. Cells were visualized 30 h after particle bombardment using the confocal microscope through a Plan-Neofluor 403/1.3 oil (differential interference contrast) objective. Live-cell images were acquired using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with an LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss). The multitracking mode was used to eliminate spillover between fluorescence channels. The CFP was excited by a diode 405 laser and the YFP by an argon-ion laser (514 nm), both at low intensities. After increasing the intensity of the 514-nm laser, the YFP fluorescence from the acceptor, YFP-HY5, was bleached. The bleaching of the acceptor resulted in an increased emission from CFP-BBX25, indicating that FRET had occurred between the two proteins prior to the bleach. Similarly, in control photobleaching experiments using the microscopic settings, FRET between untagged CFP and YFP was examined. Regions of interest were selected and bleached with 100 iterations using the argon-ion laser at 100%. At least 10 different nuclei were subjected to FRET, and average intensities before and after bleaching were plotted on the graph. In vitro protein–protein interaction studies were performed as described by CITATION, with some modifications. Wild-type and mutated DNA fragments encoding full-length BBX25 were cloned into the pET20b (+) vector to generate a C-terminal 6×His fusion. The full-length coding sequence of HY5 and BBX24 was cloned into the pMAL vector to generate N-terminal fusion of the maltose binding protein (MBP) tag (MBP-HY5). The proteins were overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) or an amylose resin column (GE Healthcare). For in vitro pull-down experiments, 1.5 µg of MBP and MBP-HY5 prey proteins was bound to an amylose resin column by incubating with PBS, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4°C. Excess unbound protein was washed off and further incubated with 1.5 µg of BBX25-His bait proteins in 250 μL binding buffer for 3 h at 4°C in in vitro pull-down buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% [v/v] glycerol, 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% [v/v] protease inhibitor cocktail, and Nonidet P-40) and washed four times with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in equal volume of 2× SDS buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS- PAGE gel, and the proteins were detected using anti-His antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich; A7058). For the analysis of GFP-BBX25 protein dynamics in hypocotyl cell nuclei, at least 10 to 12 seedlings grown in the respective growth conditions were subjected to fluorescence microscopy analysis and pictures taken with a ×40 objective. Fluorescence signals were detected for GFP (excitation of 488 nm; emission of 505 to 550 nm). In all the experiments, the scans were done with identical microscope settings. For the analysis of light-dependent protein accumulation, plants were treated with 100 μM MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) or DMSO (mock control) for 1 or 4 h as indicated at the time of each experiment. Protein gel blot analysis was performed using the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Fisher Scientific) following the instructions described in the user’s manual. Protein extracts were prepared from wild-type, mutant, or transgenic seedlings. Approximately 100 mg of seedlings was harvested in a microcentrifuge tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground in 200 mL of grinding buffer (400 mM Suc, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 2.5 mM EDTA), and PMSF was added (0.5 mL for every 100 mL of grinding buffer). The protein extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the debris. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and an aliquot of 5 mL was taken out in a separate tube to estimate protein concentration by Bradford assay. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Prestained protein markers (GE Healthcare) were used for molecular mass determination. The samples were then transferred to Hybond C-Extra (GE Healthcare) at 100 mA for 2 h in trans-blot semidry transfer apparatus following the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl) and probed with GFP (monoclonal), HY5 and COP1 (polyclonal antibodies), or antiactin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich; A0480). For the protoplast assay, Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cell protoplasts were prepared and transfected as described by CITATION. The promoter-reporter used was a 1000-bp fragment of the BBX22 promoter driving firefly luciferase (pPCV814-BBX22-Luc). Full-length HY5, BBX25, BBX25D74A, and BBX24 driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (pRTL-HY5, pRTL2-BBX25, pRTL2-BBX25, and pRTL2-BBX24) were used as the effectors. For the reporter detection, the Dual Luciferase system was used (Promega Biotech). Renilla luciferase driven by a full-length cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (pRNL) was used as an internal control. To characterize the nature of the mutations in BBX25 and BBX24, we studied the expression of mRNA in bbx25-1, bbx25-2, and bbx24-1 mutant genotypes grown for 15 d under 12 h light/12 h dark and harvested just before dawn when the transcripts are reportedly high (CITATION). Total RNA was extracted from 15-d-old plants grown in a 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycle, using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen), and 20 µg was loaded for the RNA gel blot analysis. BBX25 (amplified with BBX25 RNA-FP and BBX25 RNA-RP) and BBX24 (amplified with BBX24 RNA-FP and BBX24 RNA-RP) C-terminal fragments were used as probes to detect transcript levels in the wild type and different bbx24 and bbx25 mutant backgrounds. For quantitative PCR analysis, RNA was extracted from WL- and red light–treated 4-d-old seedlings using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen), and RNA was subjected to on-column DNase I digestion following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). RNA (1 µg) was converted into cDNA using the Revert Aid H minus first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). The cDNA was diluted 1:20 with sterile MQ water. The reaction was set up in 20-μL volume with 2 μL of template using the iTaq Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed on an optical 96-well plate in an ABI PRISM 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycle used was 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 35 s. Gene-specific primer pairs (see Supplemental Table 1 online) were designed using Primer3 and BLAST software from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/primer3). Anthocyanin content was measured as described by CITATION. For shade experiments, we used a light growth chamber with mercury lamps (General Electric HR175/R/DX/FL39 mercury 33026; PAR = 100 µmol m−2 s−1 and R:FR = 2.3) under a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/ 8 h dark) at 22°C. Seedlings were grown for 5 d under WL with a high R:FR or exposed to low R:FR (R:FR = 0.35) obtained by incandescent lamps (Philips R19-100R20/FL/S) covered by Paolini filters (Paolini 2031; La Casa del Acetato) and placed laterally into the growth chamber. Spectral photon fluences of WL and shade conditions were obtained using a Li-Cor Integrating quantum/radiometer/photometer (Li-188B). PAR and R:FR ratios were measured using a SpectroSense2 attached with a SKR-1850SS2 light sensor (Skye Instruments).
