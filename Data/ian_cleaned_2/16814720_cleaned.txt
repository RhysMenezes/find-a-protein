!~ABS~! Potassium is an essential mineral element for plant growth and development. Although it is known that plants absorb and transport K+ through membrane transporters, it remains unclear how these transporters are regulated. Here we show that the protein kinase CIPK23, encoded by the LKS1 gene, regulates K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions. Lesion of LKS1 significantly reduced K+ uptake and caused leaf chlorosis and growth inhibition, whereas overexpression of LKS1 significantly enhanced K+ uptake and tolerance to low K+. We demonstrate that CIPK23 directly phosphorylates the K+ transporter AKT1 and further find that CIPK23 is activated by the binding of two calcineurin B-like proteins, CBL1 and CBL9. We propose a model in which the CBL1/9–CIPK23 pathway ensures activation of AKT1 and enhanced K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions.
!~RES~! Arabidopsis low-K+-sensitive (lks) mutants were isolated from EMS-mutagenized M2 seedlings (see CITATION). Among a number of putative M3 mutants, lks1 showed significant lks phenotype. On low-K+ (LK, 100 μM) medium, the lks1 mutants (lks1-1 and lks1-2) stopped growing after 4 days, and their cotyledons and leaves showed chlorotic phenotype after 10 days ( CITATIONA). The growth of wild-type seedlings also slowed down under LK conditions, but their leaves remained healthy (CITATIONA). As leaf chlorosis is a typical symptom under K+-deficient conditions (CITATION), we took leaf chlorosis as the standard lks phenotype for further analysis in this study. We noted that root growth of the lks1 mutants maintained a faster pace of elongation than the wild-type during the first 4 days after transfer to LK medium (CITATIONA). It should also be noted that the lks phenotype of the mutants was high ammonium dependent (see CITATION in the CITATION available with this article online), which is consistent with the previous report (CITATION). Genetic analyses showed that lks1-1 and lks1-2 harbor monogenic recessive mutations in a nuclear gene and that the two mutations in two independent lines, lks1-1 (in Landsberg erecta background) and lks1-2 (in Columbia background), are allelic to each other (CITATIONA and CITATION). The analyses of the F2 generations from a cross between either lks1-1 and wild-type (Ler) or lks1-2 and wild-type (Col) revealed a 3:1 segregation ratio of wild-type over lks1 (CITATION). Map-based cloning was carried out using an F2 population, and LKS1 was located within BAC clone F12P21 of chromosome I (CITATIONB) and finally identified to encode CIPK23 (At1g30270; CITATIONB), a member of the CBL-interacting protein kinase family (CITATION). CIPKs form a plant-specific family of Ser/Thr kinases structurally similar to the SNF1 kinase from yeast and AMPK from mammalian systems (CITATION). The single-nucleotide mutation C1317T in the lks1-1 allele (CITATIONB) caused a change of Ala199 to Val in the amino acid sequence located at the activation loop, a highly conserved domain in CIPKs (CITATION). The mutation C3039T in the lks1-2 allele led to Leu447-to-Phe substitution in the domain near the C terminus of CIPK23 (CITATIONB). A T-DNA insertion line (SALK_036154) containing a T-DNA insertion in the seventh intron of LKS1 (CITATIONB) was named lks1-3 in this study. CITATIONC shows that the T-DNA insertion in lks1-3 disrupted the transcription of the LKS1 gene. The lks1-3 mutants, like lks1-1 and lks1-2, displayed the lks phenotype (CITATIOND), indicating that these mutations are allelic. The F1 generations of the lks1-3 × lks1-1 and lks1-3 × lks1-2 crosses exhibited the same lks phenotype as their parents (CITATIOND; CITATION), further confirming that the phenotype of lks1 alleles resulted from loss of function of the LKS1 gene. Tissue expression profiles of the LKS1 gene were analyzed by creating transgenic plants carrying the LKS1 promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion. Histochemical GUS activity analysis indicated that CIPK23 was broadly expressed in whole seedlings (CITATIONE). In particular, GUS activity was high in vascular bundles (CITATIONE–1H). In root tissues, LKS1::GUS activity was strong in cortex and endodermis cells (CITATIONG and 1H) that are involved in K+ uptake and translocation (CITATION). The results suggest that CIPK23 may play an important role in K+ uptake and translocation. The quantitative results of GUS enzymatic activity assays showed that CIPK23 expression was induced when plants were grown on LK medium (CITATIONI). Northern blot analysis further confirmed that the low-K+ treatment strongly induced the expression of LKS1 in roots (CITATIONJ). To gain more information on the function of CIPK23, we constructed LKS1-overexpressing lines and analyzed the phenotype of these plants. The elevated expression of LKS1 mRNA in transgenic lines was verified by Northern blot ( CITATIONA). All LKS1-overexpressing lines showed very significant low-K+-tolerant phenotype compared to the control lines (CITATIONB). The phenotype tests showed that, in LK medium, the seedlings of the LKS1-overexpressing lines kept growing even after 1 month, whereas the lks1 mutants died completely after 3 weeks (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of LKS1 enhances plant tolerance to low-K+ stress. One of the potential mechanisms for this phenotype may be associated with K+ uptake. To test this possibility, we determined the K+ uptake rates of the lks1 mutants, LKS1-overexpressing lines, and wild-type plants. Two independent LKS1-overexpressing lines showed the highest K+ uptake rates among all tested materials (CITATIONC), whereas the K+ uptake rates of the lks1 mutants were the lowest (CITATIONC). As shown in CITATION, the LKS1-overexpressing lines had the highest Vmax and the lowest Km and Cmin for K+ uptake among the plants tested, while the lks1 mutants had much lower Vmax and increased Km and Cmin compared to wild-type plants (CITATION). Compared with the lks1-3 mutants, the Vmax for K+ uptake of two LKS1-overexpressing lines increased by about 40%, while the Km for K+ uptake of these two transgenic lines decreased to 89 μM and 81 μM, respectively, compared to 105 μM for wild-type plants and 135 μM for lks1-3 mutants. The results demonstrate that overexpression of LKS1 results in significant increases in the maximum K+ uptake rate and K+ uptake affinity. The Cmin for K+ uptake of the LKS1-overexpressing lines Col+LKS1-2 and Col+LKS1-4 was decreased to 33 μM and 35 μM, respectively, compared to 61 μM for the wild-type plants (CITATION), indicating that the LKS1-overexpressing plants may initiate K+ uptake at much lower [K+] compared to wild-type plants. Some studies in animal cells have shown that K+ transporters, such as Kv channels, are regulated by protein kinases (see the review by CITATION). The finding that CIPK23 participates in the regulation of K+ uptake in Arabidopsis led us to hypothesize that CIPK23 may regulate K+ uptake by phosphorylation of a K+ transporter (or transporters). To test the hypothesis, we first screened for potential downstream targets of CIPK23 by examining phenotypes of the various Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines for K+ transporter genes. The candidates for the targets were selected based on their possible functions in K+ uptake and/or their expression patterns (CITATION). The selected T-DNA insertion mutants included akt1 (SALK_071803), atkc1 (SALK_140579), kup1 (SALK_148762), kup3 (SALK_002622), hak5 (SALK_005604), etc. The flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion sites were verified, and RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the expression of the selected genes was disrupted in these mutants ( CITATIONA; CITATION). Among these mutants, akt1 showed the same lks phenotype as lks1 (CITATIONB; CITATION). The atkc1 mutants exhibited a phenotype similar to lks1 and akt1 mutants in their root growth during the first 4 days under low-K+ stress; however, the leaves of atkc1 mutants did not show chlorotic phenotype like lks1 mutants did (CITATIONB). It has been reported that both AKT1 and AtKC1 are preferentially expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots (CITATION) where LKS1 promoter activity is strong as well (CITATIONG and 1H). The same or similar phenotypes of the lks1, akt1, and atkc1 mutants and similar expression patterns of LKS1, AKT1, and AtKC1 genes suggested that CIPK23 may regulate AKT1 and/or AtKC1. To test whether CIPK23 would interact with AKT1 and AtKC1, we used the yeast two-hybrid method to test the potential interaction of the cytosolic region of AKT1 (cAKT1) or AtKC1 (cAtKC1) (CITATION) with CIPK23. cAKT1 includes 564 amino acids from His294 to Ser857, and cAtKC1 includes 333 amino acids from His330 to Phe662. As shown in CITATIONC, CIPK23 specifically interacted with cAKT1, but not with cAtKC1, consistent with the observation that the akt1 and lks1 mutants displayed the same phenotype (CITATIONB). However, CIPK9, which is closely related to CIPK23, did not interact with cAKT1 in the yeast two-hybrid assays (CITATION), which demonstrates the specific interaction of CIPK23 with AKT1. The in vivo interaction between these two proteins was confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (CITATION). The BiFC results shown in CITATIOND not only demonstrate the in vivo interaction between two tested proteins but also show the specific localization of the interacting proteins at the plasma membranes (PM). In vitro protein phosphorylation assays further demonstrated the interaction of these two proteins. A constitutively active form of CIPK23 (CIPK23(CA)) is generated by deleting the binding site of CBLs (FISL/NAF motif) (CITATION) and changing Thr190 to Asp in the activation loop (CITATION). CIPK23(CA) was produced as a GST fusion and was used to phosphorylate the cytosolic region of AKT1 and AtKC1. The results showed that CIPK23 phosphorylated cAKT1, but not cAtKC1 (CITATIONE). The genetic evidence further proved this notion. Compared with the transgenic lines of SUPER::LKS1 in a wild-type or lks1 background (CITATIONB), the transgenic lines of SUPER::LKS1 in the akt1 background (verified by Northern blot; CITATIONF) did not rescue the lks phenotype (CITATIONG). All of these data are consistent with the hypothesis that AKT1 functions downstream of CIPK23. Further evidence demonstrating this conclusion came from the similar kinetic parameters of K+ uptake for lks1 and akt1 mutants (CITATIONH; CITATION). Compared with the Vmax for K+ uptake of wild-type plants, the Vmax for K+ uptake of the lks1-2, lks1-3, and akt1 mutants similarly decreased by 23%, 23%, and 17%, respectively (CITATION). The Km and Cmin for K+ uptake of these three mutants were also changed to a similar extent (CITATION). The results of K+ content measurements showed that, among the tested materials, the root K+ content of wild-type plants (Col) and the LKS1-overexpressing line (Col+LKS1-4) was much higher than that of the lks1 and akt1 mutants after cultured in MS medium for 4, 7, or 10 days ( CITATIONA), while wild-type plants and the LKS1-overexpressing line had shoot K+ content similar to that of the lks1 and akt1 mutants (CITATIONB). The LKS1-overexpressing line had the highest K+ content in both roots (CITATIONC) and shoots (CITATIOND) after growth in LK medium for 4, 7, or 10 days. In addition, the K+ content in shoots of lks1 and akt1 mutants was not significantly different from that in shoots of wild-type plants under the normal conditions (CITATIONB), whereas the K+ content in shoots of lks1 and akt1 mutants was significantly different from that in shoots of wild-type plants under low-K+ conditions (CITATIOND). The results suggest that CIPK23-regulated AKT1 may play important roles in translocating K+ from roots to shoots at the root endodermis and vascular tissues when plants are subjected to low-K+ stress. This may explain the chlorotic phenotype in the lks1 and the akt1 mutants under the low-K+ stress. AKT1-overexpressing lines were also constructed and tested, but no significant low-K+-responsive phenotype was observed (data not shown). It has been reported that AKT1 expression level is high in roots (CITATION) and that this expression is not induced by K+ starvation (CITATION). This, together with our results, suggests that the expression level of AKT1 is sufficient to meet the need for K+ uptake under most conditions and that the limitation for AKT1 function may lie in its phosphorylation status regulated by CIPK23. Activity of a CIPK is regulated by one or more CBLs (CITATION), a unique family of calcium binding proteins in plants (CITATION). Yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted to identify the particular CBL (or CBLs) that interacts with CIPK23. As shown in CITATIONA, CIPK23 interacted with six members of the CBL family, including CBL1, CBL2, CBL3, CBL5, CBL8, and CBL9. Quantitative β-galactosidase activity assays showed that, among these six CBLs, CBL1 and CBL9 displayed the strongest interaction with CIPK23 (CITATIONB). To test the genetic link between these CBLs and LKS1, the T-DNA insertion lines for these two CBL genes were tested for their potential low-K+ sensitivity. Expression of CBL1 and CBL9 was disrupted in cbl1 (SALK_110426) and cbl9 (SALK_142774) mutants, respectively, and in cbl1 cbl9 double mutants (CITATIONC; CITATION). Although the cbl1 and cbl9 single mutants did not show the typical lks phenotype under LK conditions, the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants showed the same lks phenotype as the lks1 or akt1 mutants (CITATIOND), indicating that CBL1 and CBL9 have overlapping functions. The low-K+ sensitivity of the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants was complemented after the mutants were transformed by CBL1 (CITATIONE and 5F) driven by its own promoter. Furthermore, wild-type plants transformed with SUPER::CBL1 or SUPER::CBL9 ( CITATIONA) showed enhanced low-K+-tolerant phenotype (CITATIONB; CITATION) similar to the LKS1-overexpressing lines (CITATIONB). However, overexpression of CBL1 or CBL9 in the lks1 mutants did not complement the low-K+ sensitivity of lks1 mutants (CITATIONB), and overexpression of LKS1 in the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants did not complement the low-K+ sensitivity of the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants (CITATIONC and 6D). This genetic evidence demonstrates that CBL1 and CBL9 are the upstream positive regulators of CIPK23. Although CBL5, like CBL1 and CBL9, showed strong interaction with CIPK23 in our yeast two-hybrid assays (CITATIONA and 5B), the CBL5-overexpressing lines in wild-type background did not show any significant enhancement of low-K+ tolerance under low-K+ stress (CITATION). Thus, CBL5 may not be involved in regulation of the AKT1-mediated K+ uptake pathway. As mentioned above, the CBLs specifically interact with the FISL/NAF domain of the CIPKs (CITATION). As shown in CITATIONE, the FISL-deletion form of CIPK23 (CIPK23-FISL) lost its interaction with CBL1 or CBL9. The in vivo interaction between CIPK23 and CBL1 or CBL9 was confirmed using BiFC assays as shown in CITATIONF. In addition, BiFC results also demonstrated that the two pairs of interacting proteins were specifically localized at the PM (compare to CITATION), which is consistent with the notion that the CIPK23-CBL1 (or CIPK23-CBL9) complex regulates the activity of PM-localized AKT1. Furthermore, deletion of the FISL/NAF domain resulted in nonfunctional CIPK23 in vivo. Overexpression of LKS1(CA) in wild-type plants or in the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants did not increase low-K+ tolerance of the transgenic plants (CITATIONG and 6H). In addition, overexpression of CBL1 or CBL9 significantly increased K+ content in both roots and shoots under low-K+ conditions (CITATIONI and 6J), while the disruption of CBL1 and CBL9 expression in the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants decreased K+ content, particularly in shoots (CITATIONI and 6J). Transgenic plants harboring CBL1::GUS and CBL9::GUS constructs were produced to analyze the promoter activity of these two genes in different plant tissues. The GUS histochemical assays showed that expression patterns of CBL1 and CBL9 were similar to CIPK23 and were particularly abundant in root tips and vascular bundles in the stem and the leaf (data not shown). Given that both CIPK23 and AKT1 are abundantly expressed in root tips and vascular bundles, these results may further support the notion that CBL1 and CBL9 regulate CIPK23/AKT1-mediated K+ uptake. Arabidopsis KAT1-mediated K+ currents have been successfully and repeatedly recorded in Xenopus oocytes (see the review by CITATION and references therein). However, observation of AKT1-mediated K+ currents has not been successful in Xenopus oocytes so far, although Arabidopsis AKT1 (CITATION), and its ortholog in potato, SKT1 (CITATION), -mediated K+ currents have been recorded in insect cells. Considering that the activity of AKT1 is regulated by CIPK23 and CBL1 (or CBL9), we hypothesized that coexpression of AKT1 with CIPK23 and CBL1 (or CBL9) may activate AKT1-mediated K+ currents in oocytes. Not surprisingly, as shown in CITATIONA, AKT1-mediated K+ inward currents were activated under hyperpolarization conditions after the cRNAs of AKT1, CIPK23, and CBL1 were coinjected into the oocytes. Substitution of CBL1 cRNA with CBL9 cRNA showed the same results (data not shown). The absence of either CIPK23 or CBL1 (or CBL9) resulted in complete inactivation of AKT1 activity (CITATIONA). Furthermore, substitution of either CBL1 cRNA with CBL5 cRNA or CIPK23 cRNA with CIPK9 cRNA also resulted in complete inactivation of the AKT1 currents (CITATIONA). In addition, substitution of CIPK23 cRNA with CIPK23(CA) cRNA also resulted in inactivation of the AKT1 currents, which is consistent with our BiFC assay results finding that FISL/NAF-deleted CIPK23 did not interact with CBL1 or CBL9 (CITATIONF). The AKT1-mediated inward currents were external K+ dependent, and the AKT1 channels were highly selective for K+ over Na+ (CITATIONB and 7C). The measured reversal potentials (Erev) of AKT1 currents at various external [K+] correlated well with the theoretical K+ equilibrium potentials (CITATIOND) under the indicated conditions. CITATIONE show the AKT1-mediated inward currents under the low-K+ conditions. Similar to the previous observations reported by CITATION and CITATION, the time-dependent endogenous inward currents were developed when the control oocytes (injected with water) were hyperpolarized to membrane potentials more negative than −160 mV. This hyperpolarization-activated endogenous inward current was K+ independent (compare the three upper recordings at different external [K+] shown in CITATIONE). However, after the coexpression of AKT1 together with CBL1 and CIPK23, the time-activated and external-K+-dependent inward currents were observed at 100 μM external K+ when the membrane voltages were clamped to more negative than about −150 mV. The estimated Erev for K+ currents at 100 μM external K+ was about −150 mV. Given that the estimated [K+] in oocytes is between 80 mM and 120 mM (CITATION), the K+ equilibrium potentials (EK) are between −169 mV and −179 mV at 20°C. The shift of Erev to more positive voltages might partially result from hyperpolarization-activated endogenous membrane permeability to other ions (CITATION), and it might be also partially induced by a possible slight permeability of AKT1 to Na+, particularly at low-K+ (100 μM) and high-external-Na+ (95.9 mM) conditions, even though AKT1 channels are highly selective for K+ over Na+. To further confirm the regulation of AKT1-mediated inward K+ currents by CIPK23 and CBL1 (or CBL9) in vivo, patch-clamp whole-cell recordings were conducted using root-cell protoplasts. As shown in CITATIONF and 7G, inward K+ currents were activated in the presence of CIPK23 as well as CBL1 and CBL9 (wild-type) and inactivated in the absence of CIPK23 (lks1 mutant) or in the double mutant of CBL1 and CBL9 (cbl1 cbl9 mutant). The inward K+ currents in the root cells of AKT1 overexpressors were not significantly different from those in the root cells of wild-type plants (CITATIONF and 7G), which is consistent with our observation that the AKT1-overexpressing lines did not show enhanced low-K+-tolerant phenotype (data not shown).
!~MM~! For the low-K+-sensitive (lks) Arabidopsis mutant isolation, EMS-mutagenized M2 seeds were germinated on MS medium containing 0.8% (w/v) agar and 3% (w/v) sucrose at 22°C under constant illumination at 60 μmol m−2 s−1 for 4 days. Then, M2 seedlings were transferred to LK medium to screen for the putative lks mutants, whose cotyledons showed chlorotic phenotype after 7–10 days. The [K+] for the LK medium was determined by testing phenotypes of wild-type (wt) Arabidopsis seedlings in medium containing different [K+], and the final [K+] in the LK medium was 100 μM throughout this study. The LK medium was made by modification of MS medium. KNO3 and KH2PO4 in MS medium were replaced by NH4NO3 and NH4H2PO4, respectively; 0.8% (w/v) K+-depleted agar (see CITATION) was added; and the final [K+] was 100 μM, adjusted by adding KNO3 and determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The putative lks mutants were grown under normal conditions to harvest M3 seeds, and the lks phenotype was further confirmed with M3 seedlings in LK medium. The selected M3 mutants were backcrossed with the wt plants, and phenotypes of their F1 and F2 generations were tested in LK medium for genetic analyses. The T-DNA insertion lines, including lks1-3 (SALK_036154), akt1 (SALK_071803), atkc1 (SALK_140579), kup1 (SALK_148762), kup3 (SALK_002622), hak5 (SALK_005604), cbl1 (SALK_110426), and cbl9 (SALK_142774) were ordered from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://www.arabidopsis.org/abrc/). The information for the molecular confirmation of the T-DNA insertion lines is summarized in CITATION. For seed harvest and hybridization, Arabidopsis plants were grown in potting soil mixture (rich soil:vermiculite = 2:1, v/v) and kept in growth chambers at 22°C with illumination at 120 μmol m−2 s−1 for a 14 hr daily light period. The relative humidity was approximate 70% (±5%). The lks1-1 (Landsberg erecta background) mutants were crossed with Columbia wild-type plants, and the lks1-2 (Columbia background) mutants were crossed with Landsberg erecta wild-type plants to create mapping populations. A total of 3700 individual F2 plants were selected for chromosomal mapping of LKS1. The LKS1::GUS construct was generated by fusing the LKS1 promoter fragment (2.57 kb) in front of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) coding sequence in pCAMBIA1381 vector. The SUPER::LKS1 construct was generated by cloning the coding sequence of LKS1 into pBIB vector under control of the SUPER promoter (CITATION). The constructs of CBL1::GUS, CBL9::GUS, SUPER::CBL1, SUPER::CBL5, SUPER::CBL9, and SUPER::LKS1(CA) were generated. For the generation of complementation lines of the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants, CBL1 was cloned into pCAMBIA1300 vector. To introduce the Thr190-to-Asp mutation and create the FISL/NAF deletion construction for constitutively active CIPK23, primer-based site-directed mutation (5′-GGTGTTCCACAGGTGTCGTGAAGTAACCCATCC-3′, 5′-GGATGGGTTACTTCACGACACCTGTGGAACACC-3′) and the deletion (5′-GAAGAAGGACTCAAAACACCAGTAAAACAAATGGGGCTGG-3′, 5′-AGTTTTTCGTTTCACCAGCCCCATTTGTTTTACTGGTGTTTTGAGT-3′) were generated, respectively. Arabidopsis transformation with Agrobacterium (strain GV3101) was carried out by the floral dip method (CITATION). The T3 homozygous transgenic plants of LKS1::GUS, CBL1::GUS, and CBL9::GUS were stained by submersion in staining solution (CITATION). GUS-stained plants and tissues were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS and, after dehydration, embedded in hydroxyethyl methacrylate (LR White) and sliced into 3 μm sections. Extractable GUS enzymatic activity was quantitatively determined. For low-K+ inducement analysis, 7-day-old seedlings were treated in 1/2 MS or low-K+-containing medium for 12 hr. Total RNA of roots or shoots was isolated separately. In assays of mRNA expression in the transgenic lines, total RNA of whole seedlings was isolated. Probes were labeled with 32P using random primer labeling reagents (Pharmacia) and hybridized to RNA blotted onto nylon membrane. Hybridization signals were imaged using a phosphorimager. For K+-depletion experiments (CITATION), 7-day-old seedlings were pretreated in starvation solution (0.2 mM CaSO4, 5 mM MES [pH 5.7] adjusted with Tris) at 22°C for 48 hr. The tests began 5 min after transfer of seedlings to the depletion solution (0.25 mM KNO3, 0.2 mM CaSO4, 5 mM MES [pH 5.7] adjusted with Tris). The experiments were conducted at 22°C in the light (60 μmol m−2 s−1). The solution samples were collected at different time points as indicated. For K+ content measurements in plant tissues, the 4-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were transferred from MS medium to LK medium and treated for different times as indicated. The plant tissues were treated in a muffle furnace at 575°C for 5 hr and then dissolved in 0.1N HCl. [K+] of the samples was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The coding sequences of CIPK23, CIPK23-FISL, and CIPK9 were cloned into pAS2 vector. The coding sequences for cytosolic regions of AKT1 (from H294) and AtKC1 (from H330) (CITATION) as well as the coding sequences for CBLs were cloned into the pACT2 vector. The vectors were transformed into yeast strain AH109 for yeast two-hybrid tests. The positive clones of CIPK23/AKT1 and CIPK23/CBL complexes were selected and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. BiFC assays were performed as described previously (CITATION). For generation of the BiFC vectors, the coding regions of LKS1 and LKS1-FISL were cloned via XbaI-XhoI into pUC-SPYCE, resulting in CIPK23-YC and CIPK23-FISL-YC; the coding regions of CBL1 and CBL9 were cloned via BamHI-XhoI into pUC-SPYNE, resulting in CBL1-YN and CBL9-YN; and the coding region of AKT1 was cloned via XbaI-XhoI into pUC-SPYNE, resulting in AKT1-YN. Mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from 5-week-old wild-type plants (ecotype Columbia) and transformed with the tested pairs of constructs as described (http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb/protocols_reg.html). Fluorescence of YFP in the transformed protoplasts was imagined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss) after the protoplasts were incubated at 23°C for 12–18 hr. The respective coding sequences were cloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Pharmacia) to generate GST-CIPK23 (CA, constitutively active), GST-cAKT1 (the cytosolic region), and GST-cAtKC1 (the cytosolic region) (CITATION) constructs. These GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and were purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The in vitro kinase assays were performed in buffer (containing, in mM: 20 Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 2.5 MnCl2, 2.5 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 DTT; 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP was added in a final volume of 50 μl) at 25°C for 30 min. Reaction aliquots (25 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and exposed to the phosphorimager. The coding sequences of AKT1, LKS1, CIPK9, CBL1, CBL5, CBL9, and LKS1 (CA) were cloned into pGEMHE vector. The cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega). Oocytes were isolated from X. laevis and injected with cRNAs. The oocytes were injected with distilled water (50 nl as control), AKT1 cRNA (28 ng in 50 nl), AKT1 and CIPK23 cRNA mixture (14:14 ng in 50 nl), AKT1 and CBL1 cRNA mixture (14:14 ng in 50 nl), AKT1 and CIPK23(CA) cRNA mixture (14:14 ng in 50 nl), the cRNA mixture of AKT1, CIPK23, and CBL1 (12:8:8 ng in 50 nl), the cRNA mixture of AKT1, CIPK9, and CBL1 (12:8:8 ng in 50 nl), or the cRNA mixture of AKT1, CIPK23, and CBL5 (12:8:8 ng in 50 nl). Before used in voltage-clamp recordings, the injected oocytes were incubated at 17°C in modified Barth's solution containing (in mM) 88 NaCl, 1.0 KCl, 0.91 CaCl2, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, and 10 HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) supplemented with gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Whole-cell recordings were performed 2 days after cRNA injection. A two-electrode voltage-clamp technique was applied using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments) at room temperature (∼20°C). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 M KCl. The bath solution contained (in mM) 96 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2). To analyze the external K+ dependence of AKT1 currents, the K+ concentration in the bath solution was changed by substitution of KCl with an equivalent amount (in mol) of NaCl. Whole-cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized through a Digidata 1322A AC/DC converter using Clampex 9.0 software (Axon Instruments). Root-cell protoplasts were isolated from 5-day-old primary roots of Arabidopsis seedlings. The enzyme solution was prepared by dissolving 1.5% (w/v) cellulysin (Calbiochem), 1.5% (w/v) cellulase RS (Yakult Honsha Co.), 0.1% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 (Seishin Pharmaceutical Co.), and 0.1% (w/v) BSA in standard solution containing (in mM) 10 K+ glutamate, 2 MgC12, 1 CaC12, 350 sorbitol, and 5 MES (pH 5.8) adjusted with Tris. The primary roots were cut into small pieces and incubated in the enzyme solution at 23°C for 40 min to release root-cell protoplasts. The protoplasts were filtered through 80 μm nylon mesh and washed with standard solution. The mixture was centrifuged at 160 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended with standard solution and kept on ice before use. Standard whole-cell recording techniques were applied (CITATION). The contents of the bath and pipette solutions for the whole-cell recordings were the same as described (CITATION). The patch-clamp recordings were conducted at about 20°C in dim light. Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) connected to a computer via an interface (TL-1 DMA Interface, Axon Instruments).
