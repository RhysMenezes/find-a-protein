!~ABS~! Plant mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in important processes, including stress signaling and development. In a functional yeast screen, we identified mutations that render Arabidopsis thaliana MAPKs constitutively active (CA). Importantly, CA-MAPKs maintain their specificity toward known activators and substrates. As a proof-of-concept, Arabidopsis MAPK4 (MPK4) function in plant immunity was investigated. In agreement with the phenotype of mpk4 mutants, CA-MPK4 plants were compromised in pathogen-induced salicylic acid accumulation and disease resistance. MPK4 activity was found to negatively regulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced reactive oxygen species production but had no impact on callose deposition, indicating that CA-MPK4 allows discriminating between processes regulated by MPK4 activity from processes indirectly affected by mpk4 mutation. Finally, MPK4 activity was also found to compromise effector-triggered immunity conditioned by the Toll Interleukin-1 Receptor–nucleotide binding (NB)–Leu-rich repeat (LRR) receptors RPS4 and RPP4 but not by the coiled coil–NB-LRR receptors RPM1 and RPS2. Overall, these data reveal important insights on how MPK4 regulates plant defenses and establishes that CA-MAPKs offer a powerful tool to analyze the function of plant MAPK pathways.
!~RES~! To identify mutations triggering constitutive kinase activation, we adapted a yeast functional screen developed by Engelberg and coworkers (CITATION). Our laboratory previously showed that Arabidopsis MPK6, together with the MAP2K MKK2, rescues the salt sensitivity of a yeast strain mutated in the MAP2K PBS2 and the MAPK HOG1 (CITATION). In the absence of MKK2, MPK6 does not restore growth of pbs2Δhog1Δ on high salt, indicating that MPK6, without its upstream MAP2K, is not functional. In these conditions, mutations triggering MPK6 constitutive activity should restore the pbs2Δhog1Δ salt growth. We performed a screen on pbs2Δhog1Δ yeast expressing a randomly mutated MPK6 open reading frame (ORF) population. When replicated on 400 to 600 mM NaCl, very few colonies were recovered. To exclude MPK6-independent recovery of salt tolerance, plasmids were extracted, retransformed into pbs2Δhog1Δ, and confirmed by growth on salt. Finally, 27 MPK6 candidate clones were identified and sequenced, revealing mutations in one to six residues in MPK6 (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Y144C, Y144F, and R274H mutations were found in 12, nine, and four clones, respectively, indicating that they are important for pbs2Δhog1Δ complementation. To confirm that pbs2Δhog1Δ complementation is linked to an increased MPK6 activity, MPK6 protein variants were immunoprecipitated from yeast using a specific anti-MPK6 antibody. The MPK6 kinase activity was subsequently assayed by the ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP), a common artificial substrate for MAPKs. Under these conditions, the activity of wild-type MPK6 was barely detectable, whereas all MPK6 mutants phosphorylated MBP efficiently (Figure 1A). This shows that the MPK6 mutants that complement pbs2Δhog1Δ have a higher catalytic activity. [[FIGURE]] Sequence analysis of the candidate clones pointed to Tyr-144 and Arg-274 as important residues for kinase autoactivity because their mutations were identified in 25 out of 27 clones (Figure 1B). One of the two remaining clones exhibited three mutations, including D218G and E222A, in the kinase activation loop (Figure 1B). Since the double mutants in these residues showed high intrinsic activity after immunoprecipitation from yeast, we chose the mutations Y144C and D218G/E222A for further characterization. To confirm the importance of these residues, we generated three MPK6 single mutants, MPK6Y144C, MPK6D218G, and MPK6E222A, and the double mutant, MPK6D218G/E222A, without the additional mutations obtained in the yeast screen. The respective MPK6 kinases were purified as recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli cells, an expression system lacking MAPK activators. Wild-type MPK6 did not show significant kinase activity; however, MPK6Y144C and MPK6D218G/E222A strongly phosphorylated MBP (Figure 1C). By contrast, the single mutations D218G and E222A did not increase MPK6 activity, suggesting that MPK6D218G/E222A activity is not a result of an additive effect of each mutation but rather of a synergistic effect. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of the 20 Arabidopsis MAPKs (see Supplemental Figure 1 online) showed that most MAPKs of the groups A, B, and C have a Tyr residue at the equivalent position of MPK6 Tyr-144. Despite the fact that the activation loop sequences are not very conserved among MAPKs, we identified the equivalent positions of the MPK6 D218 and E222 for the groups A, B, and C. In order to test if the corresponding mutations trigger autoactivity in the other MAPKs, we mutated the corresponding residues of MPK3 and MPK4, which are among the most studied MAPKs in plants (see Supplemental Figure 1 online for positions). Hexa-His–tagged, wild-type MPK3 and MPK4 and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli for purification. We failed to purify the 6xHIS-MPK3D193G/E197A, and we expressed it as PERIPLASMIC-6xHIS-MALTOSE BINDING PROTEIN (periHisMBP)–tagged protein. CA-MPK4 forms (Figure 1D), and the periHisMBP-MPK3D193G/E197A variant (Figure 1E) showed higher activity than the respective wild-type proteins, whereas MPK3 activity was not increased by the T119C mutation (Figure 1F). Since MPK3 possesses a Thr instead of a Tyr residue in the MPK6 Tyr-144 homologous position, we hypothesized that substitution of this Thr, like the Cys and Phe substitutions of Tyr-144 in MPK6, allows MAP2K-independent MPK3 activity. To test this hypothesis, we created the MPK3T119Y mutant, mimicking the wild-type MPK6 form, which was expected to have decreased kinase activity. Kinase assay showed a reduced MPK3T119Y intrinsic activity compared with wild-type MPK3 and MPK3T119C (Figure 1F). These results indicate that the residues identified in the yeast screen to activate MPK6 provide a strategy to render MAPKs constitutively active. To test whether the kinase preference for the residues surrounding the phosphorylation site was not affected by the CA mutations, we took advantage of a semidegenerate peptide array tool (CITATION). This array consists of 198 peptide pools, and each pool has as a putative phosphorylation site (Ser/Thr) at its central position and is degenerate for all other positions except a fixed residue at one of the nine positions surrounding the phosphosite (between −5 and +4). The level of phosphorylation of each peptide by the kinase indicates the preferred residues for each position surrounding the phosphorylation site. Active MPK6Y144C and MPK6D218G/E222A were first tested and both showed an increased phosphorylation on peptides with Pro at position +1 and to a lesser extent to peptides with Pro at the −2 position (Figure 2A). Moreover, we saw a preference for charged amino acids at position +2. This result is in agreement with wild-type MPK6 specificity determined previously (CITATION). Assays for wild-type MPK3, MPK3T119C, and MPK4Y124C gave similar results, indicating that the CA mutations do not change the phosphorylation motif preference of the MAPKs (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). [[FIGURE]] We next used yeast two-hybrid assays to examine whether the specific interactions between MAPKs and known interacting substrates and activating MAP2Ks are affected by the CA-MAPK versions. Wild-type and CA forms of MPK3, 4, and 6 were fused to the GAL4 binding domain and coexpressed in the reporter strain together with several known substrates fused to the GAL4 activation domain. In accordance with previous reports (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we observed that CA-MPK3 exclusively interacts with VIRE2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (VIP1), CA-MPK4 with MAP KINASE SUBSTRATE 1 (MKS1), and CA-MPK6 with ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 104 (ERF104). In some cases, CA mutations appeared to affect the strength of the interactions but not its specificity (Figure 2C). Similar results were obtained with their corresponding activating MAP2Ks (Figure 2B): CA-MPK3 specifically interacted with MKK4, CA-MPK4 with MKK2, and CA-MPK6 with both MKK2 and MKK4. Taken together, these data indicate that the CA-MAPK versions do not change the specificity of the kinases toward their cognate MAP2Ks nor to their specific target substrates. mpk4 homozygous plants are dwarfed (CITATION). We took advantage of this phenotype to test whether CA-MPK4 versions can functionally replace the endogenous MPK4. We generated mpk4-2 lines transformed with the MPK4WT, MPK4Y124C, or MPK4D198G/E202A constructs, tagged with c-Myc at the C terminus (further referred to as K4WT, K4Y, and K4DE lines, respectively). Wild-type and CA-MPK4 constructs largely restored a wild-type morphological phenotype in all independent transgenic lines (n = 6, 10 and six lines of K4WT, K4Y, and K4DE, respectively; Figure 3A), suggesting that the cascade specificity is conserved in CA-MPK4 plants. Our first attempts to biochemically characterize these transgenic lines revealed that the antibody raised against the C terminus of the MPK4 native protein does not detect the C-terminally tagged MPK4 fusion proteins. Therefore, to test if the CA-MPK4 kinase is constitutively active when stably expressed in planta, we immunoprecipitated CA-MPK4 from the corresponding lines using anti-c-Myc antibody. All K4DE lines showed increased MPK4 activity compared with K4WT lines (Figure 3C) but, surprisingly, not the K4Y lines (Figure 3B). We determined that the increased MPK4 kinase activity of a K4DE line is ∼10% of the total flg22-induced wild-type MPK4 activity, indicating that the enhanced activity of CA-MPK4 in untreated lines is still lower than the full activation level obtained upon pathway stimulation (Figure 3D). Moreover, we observed that MPK4 was still activatable in the K4DE lines. We then used K4DE plants for further characterization. [[FIGURE]] As MEKK1 functions upstream of MPK4 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we hypothesized that CA-MPK4 may suppress the mekk1 dwarf phenotype by reactivating downstream events controlled by the MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 cascade. To test this hypothesis, we crossed heterozygous mekk1-1 plants with the K4DE1 line. The generated mekk1-1/mekk1-1 plants expressing MPK4D198G/E202A produced viable seeds and developed normally but showed curlier leaves than wild-type plants (Figure 3E). This result confirms that MPK4 acts downstream of MEKK1 and that CA-MPK4 activity is sufficient to suppress MEKK1 deficiency. mpk4 mutant plants display enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen P. syringae, suggesting that MPK4 is a negative regulator of plant defenses to biotrophic pathogens (CITATION). According to this model, we reasoned that K4DE lines would be more susceptible to P. syringae infection. K4DE lines were first analyzed for their response to spray inoculation with virulent P. syringae pv tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Bacterial titers at 3 d after inoculation were similar in Columbia-0 (Col-0) and K4WT leaves, but increased bacterial numbers were recovered from leaves of K4DE plants (Figure 4A), indicating that the higher MPK4 activity in K4DE lines compromises disease resistance. In order to distinguish if MPK4 functions in stomatal and postinvasive defenses, we quantified Pst DC3000 growth after inoculation through syringe infiltration. In this assay, the K4DE lines showed similar resistance levels as those observed in Col-0 and K4WT plants (Figure 4B), suggesting that MPK4 may play a role in stomatal-based defenses to bacterial entry into the apoplast rather than in postinvasive immunity. In agreement with this finding, mpk4 stable transgenic plants expressing functional MPK4-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) fusion under its own promoter displayed strong fluorescence in guard cells (Figure 4C). [[FIGURE]] We first investigated whether MPK4 could function during epidermal differentiation to control stomatal number; however, when compared with wild-type lines, no differences in stomatal densities were observed in K4DE lines (Figure 4D). Alternatively, MPK4 could be involved in stomatal aperture modulation in response to pathogens. To test this possibility, we therefore monitored the stomatal closure response of wild-type and K4DE lines after Pst DC3000 and flg22 treatments (Figure 4E; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Stomates in the three K4DE lines tested opened in response to light and closed in response to 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL Pst DC3000 and 5 µM flg22 in a similar fashion as Col-0 plants. These results suggest that MPK4 function in plant immunity is not related to the regulation of stomatal closure in response to pathogen recognition. To further understand the role of MPK4 in plant immunity, we tested the contribution of MPK4 to PTI by testing the CA-MPK4 lines for the activation of various PTI hallmarks. As MPK3 and MPK6 are known to be important regulators of PTI, we tested whether CA-MPK4 would affect the flg22-induced activation of the other MAPKs using an anti-phospho-ERK1 antibody that detects the active forms of wild-type MAPKs. The activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was similar in the wild type and the three K4DE lines, showing maximal activation at 15 min (Figure 5B). This result indicates that the CA mutations in MPK4 do not affect PAMP-dependent activation of other MAPK signaling pathways and suggests that CA-MPK4 lines can be used to define events specifically controlled by MPK4. The PAMP-induced RbohD-dependent oxidative burst is one of the fastest known PTI-related responses, occurring within minutes after PAMP treatment (CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether MPK4 has a role in regulating PAMP-induced ROS production, we measured the flg22-induced oxidative burst in leaf disks of adult plants. Col-0 and K4WT plants responded to flg22 treatment with a similar peak of ROS production, whereas K4DE lines exhibited a strong reduction of the oxidative burst (Figure 5C), indicating that MPK4 activity negatively regulates PAMP-induced ROS production. Callose deposition is another defense response that occurs after PAMP detection (CITATION). In resting conditions, none of the lines showed any callose depositions in leaves, but infiltration of flg22 into the leaves triggered strong callose deposition appearing as aniline blue–stained spots (Figure 5C). When compared with Col-0 and K4WT, K4DE lines showed no statistical difference in flg22-induced callose deposition. Given that mpk4 mutant plants display constitutive ROS and callose accumulation (CITATION), the analysis of CA-MPK4 lines allows discrimination between responses regulated by MPK4 activity and secondary effects of the mpk4 mutation. [[FIGURE]] To further assess the role of MPK4 in PTI, we used the type III secretion mutant Pst DC3000 hrcC, which is impaired in effector delivery and therefore induces mainly PTI (CITATION). Bacterial quantification after spray inoculation showed that K4DE lines are significantly more susceptible to Pst DC3000 hrcC than Col-0 and K4WT lines (Figure 5A). These results indicate that even if MPK4 activity does not control all PAMP-induced responses, MPK4 performs an important role in PTI. To investigate the function of MPK4 during ETI, we challenged K4DE lines with the avirulent strain Pst DC3000 expressing the effector AvrRps4. In Arabidopsis, AvrRps4 triggers ETI through recognition mediated by the TIR-NB-LRR RPS4 (CITATION; CITATION). Disease symptoms as well as bacterial growth were more pronounced on leaves of the K4DE lines at 3 d after inoculation (Figures 6A and 6B). As expected, eds1-2 mutant plants showed hypersusceptibility to Pst DC3000 AvrRps4 (CITATION). Since the mpk4 resistance phenotype is linked to the constitutive accumulation of SA, we also assessed if the K4DE lines behave in an opposite way and accumulate less SA than K4WT lines in response to pathogen treatment. Col-0 and the K4WT lines accumulated similar amounts of SA at 24 h after spray inoculation with Pst DC3000 AvrRps4, whereby the K4DE lines showed lower pathogen-induced SA accumulation (Figure 6C). This result suggests that the reduced SA accumulation in K4DE plants could contribute to the reduced resistance of K4DE lines to P. syringae. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the role of MPK4 in ETI, we analyzed the resistance of CA-MPK4 lines to strains of Pst DC3000 expressing the effectors AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2. In Arabidopsis, AvrRpm1 and AvrRpt2 trigger ETI following recognition by the CC-NB-LRR–type receptors RPM1 and RPS2, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). Interestingly, K4DE lines exhibited complete resistance against Pst DC3000 AvrRpm1 and Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 similar to Col-0 and K4WT plants (Figures 7A and 7B). [[FIGURE]] These data suggest that the function of MPK4 in ETI may be limited to resistance mediated by TIR-NB-LRR receptors. To assess this possibility, we examined the resistance conferred by the TIR-NB-LRR RPP4 to the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis by trypan blue staining of leaves for pathogen structures and plant cell death (CITATION). Leaves of Col-0 and K4WT displayed the hypersensitive response–associated localized cell death, but the K4DE lines showed reduced RPP4-mediated resistance as manifested by the occurrence of a trailing necrosis and limited hyphal growth (Figure 7C). As expected, eds1-2 plants displayed complete susceptibility visible by the free hyphal growth and pathogen sporulation. These results suggest that MPK4 functions broadly during TIR-NB-LRR resistance signaling but with a stronger impact on the resistance conferred by certain TIR-NB-LRRs.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, Col-0 eds1-2 (CITATION), mekk1-1 (Salk_052557), and mpk4-2 (Salk_056245) derived lines were grown either on soil or on plates (half-strength Murashige and Skoog [MS], 1% Suc, 1.2% agar, and 0.5% MES, pH adjusted to 5.7 with KOH) in long-day conditions. For pathogen assays and callose deposition, plants were grown for 4 to 5 weeks in Percival growth cabinets in short days at 22°C and 70% humidity. PCR reactions used iProof enzyme (Bio-Rad). Gene ORFs were amplified from Col-0 cDNA and recombined in pDNR207 using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). The primers are described in Supplemental Table 2 online, and the protocol was kindly provided by Lurin and coworkers (http://www-urgv.versailles.inra.fr/atome/protocols.htm). Clones with and without the stop codon were amplified, allowing N- and C-terminal protein fusions. Clones were systematically sequenced. For functional studies, ORFs were recombined using the LR enzyme mix following the manufacturer’s indications (Invitrogen) in devoted plasmids (see Supplemental Table 3 online). When necessary, mutations were introduces in ORFs using a site-directed mutagenesis classical protocol (CITATION). Briefly, complementary primers carrying a mutation(s) were used in a 20-cycle PCR reaction on the appropriate vector substrate with a long extension time (>5 min) and the iProof enzyme (primer sequences in Supplemental Table 2 online). Mixture was digested by DpnI (NEB Biolabs) and directly transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Candidate clones were resequenced for the part of interest. To perform the genetic screen in yeast, MPK6 ORFs were LR recombined in pDR195gtw to generate pDR195gtw-MPK6. The PCR fragment of randomly mutated MPK6 ORF was produced using the Mutazyme II kit (Stratagene), with pDR195gtw-MPK6 as substrate and DR_F/DR_R primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online). pDR195 was linearized using BamHI and cotransformed with MPK6 randomly mutated PCR fragments into hog1Δpbs2Δ yeasts using a classical lithium/polyethylene glycol/heat shock method (CITATION). Yeast cells having reconstructed the pDR195gtw-MPK6 plasmids were selected on synthetic complete (SC; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without carbohydrate and amino acids, 0.5% NH4SO4, 2% d-Glc, and 2% BactoAgar) medium lacking uracil (SC + 0.2% dropout minus uracil (US Biological), pH 5.6 adjusted with NaOH). Colonies were replicated on yeast extract peptone dextrose medium supplemented with 2% BactoAgar and 400 to 600 mM NaCl. To extract plasmids from yeast clones, pellets from 2-mL overnight cultures were resuspended in 200 μL buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS). Glass beads (0.3 g) and 200 μL of phenol were added, followed by 3 min of vigorous shaking at room temperature. Phases were separated (15,000 rpm, 5 min) and a second phenol extraction was performed with the supernatant. DNA was precipitated from the supernatant with 30 μL of 3 M sodium acetate and 800 μL of 96% ethanol for 10 min at −20°C, followed by 20 min centrifugation at 4°C. The pelleted DNA was washed with 70% ethanol and air-dried for 1 h. DNA was resuspended in 50 μL of TE buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8), and used to transform E. coli for amplification and sequencing. To measure MPK6 activity from yeast expressing wild-type pDR195gtw-MPK6 and mutants, the supernatants of 5 mL overnight cultures were resuspended in 300 μL yeast lacus buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 15 mM EGTA, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaF, 0.5 mM NaVO3, 15 mM B-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL leupeptin, and 5 µg/mL aprotinin) and ground at 4°C using 0.3 mg glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Two hundred microliters of the supernatant cleared off beads and cell debris were used for the immunoprecipitation with anti-At-MPK6 antibody (polyclonal; Davids Biotechnologie) as previously described (CITATION). Cultures (0.1 to 0.3 liters) were grown at 37°C until they reached an OD of 0.5 to 0.6. Protein expression was induced overnight at 25°C using 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were spun down and stored at −20°C. The frozen pellet was thawed on ice and gently resuspended in the lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 2 mg/mL lysozyme, and 0.1% Triton). After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing the soluble protein was incubated for 30 min with 2 mL of cobalt resin. The matrixes were washed three times (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole) and elution from the columns performed with 500 μL 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The protein solution was then dialyzed overnight (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20% glycerol), and the concentration was determined with Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE. In vitro kinase assay activity with purified kinases (0.6 to 1 µg purified) and kinase assay on semidegenerate peptide arrays were performed as previously reported (CITATION). PC2 (see sequence in Supplemental Text 1 online, containing 9xc-Myc) and GFP tags were amplified with PC2_F/PC2_R and GFP_S/GFP_R primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online) from pC2n1 (kindly provided by H. Mireau) and pCAMBIA1302 vectors, respectively, cloned in pGEMTeasy (Promega), and sequenced. The BglII DNA fragment containing PC2 tag and the BamHI DNA fragment containing the GFP were then subcloned in the unique compatible BamHI site of pGREEN0229-MPK4L, previously described by CITATION, to generate pGREEN0229-MPK4L (locus)-PC2 and pGREEN0229-MPK4L-GFP, respectively. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Point mutations were introduced as described above to generate pGREEN0229-MPK4LY124C-PC2 and pGREEN0229-MPK4LD198G/E202A-PC2. These vectors were transformed in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying pSOUP (CITATION). The progeny of mpk4-2/MPK4 plants were transformed by floral dipping (CITATION). In the progeny, Basta-resistant plants were genotyped to identify mpk4-2/mpk4-2 plants as previously described (CITATION). Qualitative yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using yeast strain MaV203 (CITATION) and Gateway vectors pDEST22 for GAL4-AD fusion and substrates and a modified pDEST32 (carrying a kanamycin-resistant gene) for GAL-BD fusion (Invitrogen). Cells were cotransformed with the two two-hybrid plasmids using a classical lithium/polyethylene glycol/heat shock method (CITATION) and selected on medium lacking Trp and Leu (SC with 0.2% dropout-T-L [US Biological] at 30°C for 2 d). Colonies were grown overnight in the same medium without agar and then diluted 200 times, and 5 μL were spotted on an SC plate (SC with 0.2% dropout-T-L-H [US Biological] and with indicated concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. For kinase activity measurement, 2-week-old seedlings grown in liquid MS plates were used. flg22 peptide solution (1 µM) was added to media and gently mixed, and the plants were incubated for 15, 30, or 45 min. Stress was stopped by liquid nitrogen freezing. For each treatment, at least 10 plants were used. For radioactive kinase assay, immunoprecipitation of MPK4 was done as previously described (CITATION; CITATION) using anti-c-Myc antibody. For direct immunoblotting, samples were ground using a homogenizer, proteins were extracted in 2 volumes of Laemmli buffer two times, boiled for 5 min, and debris pelleted. Anti-MPK3 and anti-MPK4 antibodies were raised against MIYQEAIALNPTY and ELIYRETVKFNPQDSV epitopes, respectively. Anti-pTEpY (4370s; Ozyme), anti-c-Myc (C3956; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-MPK6 (Davis) were purchased. ROS detection using leaf discs from long-day-grown plants was performed as described previously (CITATION). ROS production was assessed using a TECAN infinite M200 spectrophotometer The callose assay was performed following a protocol described previously (CITATION) on 4- to 5-week-old plants grown under short days. At least three independent plants were used in each biologically independent experiment, where four rosette leaves were sampled from each plant. Four biologically independent experiments were performed. Callose deposition was visualized with a Leica M216F fluorescence microscope at ×100 magnification and with a Leica 10447354 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter. Callose experiments were scored blind. Leaves from 3- to 4-week old plants were used for stomatal aperture measurements. Epidermal strips were prepared from the abaxial epidermis as previously described (CITATION) and incubated in 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 6.0, 30 mM KCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 for 2 h under light (300 µE⋅m−2⋅s−1) to promote ostiole opening. To induce closure, flg22 (at indicated concentrations) or Pst DC3000 (final concentration 108 cfu/mL) was directly diluted in the buffer in contact with epidermal peels. Control and flg22-treated peels were incubated under light for 2.5 h, whereas Pst DC3000–treated peels were incubated under light for 1 h. Stomatal aperture measurements were performed with a light microscope (Optiphot-2; Nikon) fitted with a Lucida camera and a digitizing table linked to a personal computer. Sixty aperture widths were measured blind for each genotype. Spray and injection infections with Pst DC3000, Pst DC3000 hrcC mutant, Pst DC3000 AvrRps4, Pst DC3000 AvrRpm1, and Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 and determination of bacterial titers were performed on 4- to 5-week-old plants as previously described (CITATION; CITATION). Spray inoculations were performed with bacterial suspensions at 108 cfu/mL in 10 mM MgCl2 with 0.04% Silwet L-77. Infiltration experiments were performed with bacterial suspensions at 105 cfu/mL in 10 mM MgCl2. At least four plants of each genotype were used per experiment ,and the experiments repeated at least three times. Bacterial numbers in mutant or transgenic lines were compared with Col-0 using a two-tailed Student's t test. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolate Emwa1 was inoculated onto 2-week-old seedlings at 5 × 104 spores/mL as previously described (CITATION). To assess plant cell death and H. arabidopsidis infection structures, trypan blue staining of the leaves was performed 6 d after inoculation. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. SA contents were determined after bacterial spray inoculation as previously described (CITATION) except that 10 µM EDTA was added to the HPLC eluent. GFP signals due to MPK4-GFP fusion were monitored with a confocal microscope (TCS SP2-AOBS; Leica). MPK6 structure was predicted from the crystallized structure of ERK2 (PDB-ID: 2erkA) using SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) and visualized using SWISS-pdbviewer.
