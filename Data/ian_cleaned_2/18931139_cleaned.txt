!~ABS~! In plants, myoinositol signaling pathways have been associated with several stress, developmental, and physiological processes, but the regulation of these pathways is largely unknown. In our efforts to better understand myoinositol signaling pathways in plants, we have found that the WD40 repeat region of a myoinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5PTase13; At1g05630) interacts with the sucrose nonfermenting-1-related kinase (SnRK1.1) in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. Plant SnRK1 proteins (also known as AKIN10/11) have been described as central integrators of sugar, metabolic, stress, and developmental signals. Using mutants defective in 5PTase13, we show that 5PTase13 can act as a regulator of SnRK1 activity and that regulation differs with different nutrient availability. Specifically, we show that under low-nutrient or -sugar conditions, 5PTase13 acts as a positive regulator of SnRK1 activity. In contrast, under severe starvation conditions, 5PTase13 acts as a negative regulator of SnRK1 activity. To delineate the regulatory interaction that occurs between 5PTase13 and SnRK1.1, we used a cell-free degradation assay and found that 5PTase13 is required to reduce the amount of SnRK1.1 targeted for proteasomal destruction under low-nutrient conditions. This regulation most likely involves a 5PTase13-SnRK1.1 interaction within the nucleus, as a 5PTase13:green fluorescent protein was localized to the nucleus. We also show that a loss of function in 5PTase13 leads to nutrient level-dependent reduction of root growth, along with abscisic acid (ABA) and sugar insensitivity. 5ptase13 mutants accumulate less inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in response to sugar stress and have alterations in ABA-regulated gene expression, both of which are consistent with the known role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in ABA-mediated signaling. We propose that by forming a protein complex with SnRK1.1 protein, 5PTase13 plays a regulatory role linking inositol, sugar, and stress signaling.
!~RES~! Besides containing a conserved inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase catalytic domain, 5PTase13 also contains five WD40 repeat regions in the N terminus that may allow for unique protein interactions. Three other genes in the Arabidopsis genome, 5PTase12 (At2g43900), 5PTase14 (At2g31830), and FRA3 (At1g65580), encode similar proteins (CITATION; CITATION), and the amino acid identity of the WD40 repeat region varies from 45.5% to 75.3% among these proteins (Supplemental Table S1). We used the amino acid sequences corresponding to these WD40 repeat regions in BLASTp searches and obtained 12 related sequences with e-values less than 1. ClustalW and PAUP4.0 were used to generate phylogenetic trees using parsimony (Fig. 1 ), which showed that the 5PTase WD40 repeat regions are contained on a separate branch, thus indicating that they are more similar to one another than to other WD40 repeat regions. [[FIGURE]] The similarity of the 5PTases (CITATION) suggests that these proteins may function in a redundant manner. Microarray data from GENEVESTIGATOR (CITATION) indicates that FRA3 is broadly and abundantly expressed compared with 5PTase12, 5PTase13, and 5PTase14 (Supplemental Fig. S1A). We conclude that the WD40-containing 5PTases are a small group of proteins with the potential to form protein complexes and that functional redundancy may be present. To investigate the ability of the WD40 regions of 5PTase13 to participate in protein complexes, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. The 533 N-terminal amino acids from 5PTase13 containing the WD40 repeats were used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an Arabidopsis 3-d-old etiolated seedling cDNA library. We screened over 1 million yeast transformants and obtained a positive clone containing the C-terminal domain of the SnRK1.1 gene (At3g01090; also known as AKIN10). We retransformed this positive clone into yeast and verified the interaction (Fig. 2 ). Negative controls, including the empty DNA binding domain and activation domain vectors, established that SnRK1.1 binds to the WD40 repeat region of the 5PTase13 protein in yeast. [[FIGURE]] To examine the interaction between 5PTase13 and SnRK1.1 in vitro, we fused the sequence encoding the Xpress epitope tag to the C terminus of the WD40 repeat region of 5PTase13 (13WDX) and the V5 epitope tag sequence to the C terminus of SnRK1.1 (SnRKV5) and expressed both proteins in Escherichia coli. The SnRKV5 construct directs the expression of a 61.7-kD protein detected by an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody, and in most cases we detected two SnRKV5 bands, perhaps as a result of phosphorylation or proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 3 , lane 1). The 13WDX construct directs the expression of a 65.9-kD protein detected by an anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3, lane 2). These interactions are specific, as SnRKV5 is not detected by the anti-Xpress antibody and 13WDX is not detected by the anti-V5 antibody (data not shown). To determine whether the SnRK1.1 recombinant protein can “pull down” 13WDX, immunoprecipitations using anti-V5:protein A-Sepharose beads were performed, and the resulting complex was then analyzed by western blotting with an anti-Xpress antibody (Fig. 3, IP lanes). As shown in Figure 3, the WD40 repeat region from 5PTase13 (13WDX) is only detected in this pull-down assay when it has been incubated in the presence of SnRKV5. We conclude that the WD40 repeat region from 5PTase13 and SnRK1.1 can form a protein complex in vitro. [[FIGURE]] SnRK1.1, along with its closely related gene family member SnRK1.2, encodes a Suc nonfermenting-1-related kinase implicated as a central integrator of energy signaling and metabolic regulation in yeast, plants, and animals. The interaction of 5PTase13 and SnRK1.1 is novel and is perhaps unique to plants in that yeast and animal 5PTases do not contain WD40 regions. This interaction may indicate that InsP3 signal termination via 5PTase13 function affects the SnRK1 “energy sensor” in plants. Data obtained from the GENEVESTIGATOR database indicate that SnRK1.1, SnRK1.2, and 5PTase13 are detected in most plant tissues examined, although 5PTase13 expression levels are very low compared with SnRK1 gene expression (Supplemental Fig. S1B). To further explore the link between InsP3 signaling and the energy sensor, SnRK1.1, we isolated two independent T-DNA insertion mutants in the 5PTase13 gene. Two potential mutants were identified in the SALK T-DNA database and named 5ptase13-1 (SAIL_350_FO1) and 5ptase13-2 (SALK_081991) and were compared with their corresponding wild-type accessions (Fig. 4A ). The presence of the T-DNA insertion was verified by diagnostic PCR in each mutant using genomic DNA and primers specific for the T-DNA left border (LB) and gene-specific primers that flank the T-DNA insertion (Fig. 4, A and B). The resulting LB gene-specific fragments were sequenced, indicating that in 5ptase13-1 mutants, a second T-DNA insertion is found in tandem in the fourth exon (Fig. 4, A and B, LB-R band). This is in contrast to the previously reported analysis by CITATION showing that the 5ptase13-1 mutant contains a single T-DNA insertion. [[FIGURE]] Using primers specific for the 3′ end of 5PTase13, we detected a PCR product in both wild-type lines used (CS60000 and CS908) but not in 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutants (5PTase13 in Fig. 4C). Using primers that amplify the 5′ end, we detected a 1.68-kb product in both wild-type lines and in the 5ptase13-1 mutant, but not in 5ptase13-2 (Fig. 4C). We conclude that the 5ptase13-2 mutant is totally lacking 5PTase13 expression and that both 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutant lines do not express transcripts capable of encoding a full-length 5PTase13 protein. To examine how the loss of 5PTase13 affects the expression of its binding partner SnRK1.1, we examined the expression of SnRK1.1 and its closely related isoform, SnRK1.2, in 7-d-old dark-grown 5ptase13 and wild-type seedlings. The results reveal that there are no large changes in SnRK1.1 and SnRK1.2 in 5ptase13 mutants (Fig. 4D). As shown in Figure 4D, we found that FRA3 expression remains unchanged in 5ptase13 mutants, and 5PTase14 expression is barely detectable but also unchanged. In contrast, the expression of 5PTase12 is increased in both 5ptase13 mutant lines, revealing a possible means of compensation for the loss of 5PTase13 function (Fig. 4D). Under standard laboratory conditions, 5ptase13 mutants did not exhibit any abnormalities in plant growth or development. Since CITATION previously reported that 5ptase13-1 mutants are altered in cotyledon vein development, we carefully examined both 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutants and their corresponding wild-type accessions for cotyledon vein development, as described by CITATION. Using 7-d-old light-grown seedlings of wild-type and 5ptase13 mutant soil-grown plants, we found no evidence for a cotyledon vein phenotype (Supplemental Tables S2 and S3). Our analysis revealed that 33.3% of total WT1 cotyledons and 26.18% of total 5ptase13-1 cotyledons have abnormal patterns and that only 15.9% of total WT2 cotyledons and 19.4% of total 5ptase13-2 cotyledons can be classified as abnormal (Supplemental Table S3). Thus, there is variation in cotyledon vein development within different wild-type accessions, but not between 5ptase13 mutants and their matched wild-type accessions. To determine whether 5PTase13 affects SnRK1 function, we measured the activity of SnRK1 in 5ptase13 mutants and wild-type seedlings grown under various nutrient conditions. It is well documented that SnRK1 regulates multiple transcription cascades in response to sugar or energy deprivation (CITATION); however, whether in planta SnRK1 activity changes under various nutrient conditions is not known. To address this, we measured SnRK1 activity from 7-d-old wild-type seedlings grown under low light (40 μE) with different added nutrients to establish various “low-energy” conditions: no nutrients (agar and water alone), low nutrients (0.5× Murashige and Skoog [MS] salts and agar), and optimal nutrients (0.5× MS salts, agar, and 3% Suc). In addition, we examined a stressful level of added sugar (0.5× MS salts, agar, and 6% Glc). For this work, we used a well-established SnRK1 assay (CITATION) and incubated a sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) substrate peptide (CITATION), radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of plant protein extract for 30 min. Validation that these conditions are in the linear range of product accumulation is shown in Supplemental Figure S2. As expected from its role as a low-energy sensor, SnRK1 activity is higher in seedlings grown on low nutrients compared with extracts prepared from seedlings grown on optimal nutrients or 6% Glc (Fig. 5 ). Figure 6A shows that the activity of SnRK1 significantly increases in 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutants when seedlings are grown with no nutrients (8.1- and 11.3-fold increases, respectively). In contrast, SnRK1 activity decreases in 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 seedlings compared with wild-type seedlings when grown with low nutrients (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the decline in SnRK1 activity is even more dramatic when 6% Glc is added (7.1- and 3.3-fold reduction, respectively; Fig. 6C). We conclude that a loss of 5PTase13 function affects SnRK1 activity, and the impact differs depending on nutrient availability. Our data support a role for 5PTase13 as a negative regulator of SnRK1 activity in the absence of nutrients and as a positive regulator when either low nutrients or 6% Glc is present. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To explore whether 5PTase13 regulates SnRK1.1 stability, we used a similar approach as CITATION to examine the stability of recombinant V5-tagged SnRK1.1 (SnRKV5) in a cell-free degradation assay with wild-type or 5ptase13 extracts. The time course of SnRKV5 degradation with wild-type seedling extracts indicated that SnRKV5 is mostly degraded within 60 min (Fig. 7A ). MG132, a proteasome-specific inhibitor, blocked SnRKV5 degradation in both 5ptase13 and wild-type extracts (Fig. 7B), indicating that SnRKV5 is destroyed by the 26S proteasome pathway in these assays. [[FIGURE]] To test the hypothesis that 5PTase13 destabilizes SnRK1.1 under the no-nutrient conditions, we examined a 30-min time point for analysis as a midpoint to total SnRKV5 degradation. The data indicate no difference in SnRKV5 stability in wild-type and 5ptase13 extracts under the no-nutrient conditions (Fig. 7C). In contrast, when extracts are prepared from seedlings grown on low nutrients, we find less SnRKV5 accumulation in 5ptase13 extracts compared with wild-type extracts (Fig. 7D). We conclude that under the low-nutrient conditions, 5PTase13 is required to stabilize SnRKV5 protein and slow its degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the increased degradation of SnRKV5 seen with the low-nutrient conditions correlates well with the lower SnRK1 activity levels measured in 5ptase13 mutants under these same nutrient conditions (Fig. 6B). In contrast, 5PTase13 is not required to stabilize SnRKV5 when seedlings are grown with no nutrients, and this is consistent with the switch in SnRK1 activity levels we found in 5ptase13 mutants grown with no nutrients (Fig. 6A). However, since we did not observe an increase in SnRKV5 stability in 5ptase13 extracts prepared from the no-nutrient conditions, we speculate that there is an additional mechanism that influences the elevated SnRK1 activity in 5ptase13 mutants under these conditions. We compared 5ptase13 mutants with SnRK1.1 mutants, which have a small reduction in root growth under the low-nutrient conditions and exhibit enhanced root growth with 1% to 3% Suc (CITATION). 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutants exhibited reduced root growth under no-nutrient and low-nutrient conditions and no change in root growth when exogenously supplied with 3% Suc (Fig. 8, A–C ). A similar trend in nutrient-dependent root growth reduction of 5ptase13 mutants was also found when seedlings were grown in the dark (data not shown). This indicates that along with a decrease in SnRK1 activity (Fig. 6B), 5ptase13 mutants grown on the low-nutrient conditions have the same root phenotype as the SnRK1.1 mutants (CITATION), suggesting that the decrease in root growth may be an outcome of decreased SnRK1 activity. However, since the 5ptase13 mutants grown with no nutrients have elevated SnRK1 activity (Fig. 6A), we conclude that under these conditions the decrease in 5ptase13 mutant root growth cannot be a function of lower SnRK1 activity and most likely involves another mechanism. [[FIGURE]] To test whether 5PTase13 is required for sugar and ABA responses, we analyzed age-matched seeds for germination in the presence of 0%, 1%, 3%, or 6% Glc or 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 6%, or 11% Suc. At low concentrations of sugar, there were no differences in the germination of wild-type and 5ptase13 seeds in the dark or light (data not shown). However, at a high exogenous sugar concentration (6% Glc and 11% Suc) in the dark, we found that 5ptase13 mutants were significantly less sensitive to sugar (Fig. 8D; Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). We saw the same trend in sugar insensitivity when 5ptase13 mutant seeds were germinated in the presence of 6% Glc in the light, although the sugar insensitivity was less apparent (Supplemental Fig. S3). This sugar insensitivity was also noted for 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutant seeds germinated in the presence of 11% Suc, in which maximal increases of 2.5- and 2.2-fold for 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2, respectively, were noted compared with wild-type seeds (Supplemental Fig. S4). Germination in the presence of mannitol, a nonmetabolizable sugar, was not altered, indicating that the sugar insensitivity of 5ptase13 mutants is not due to a general osmotic stress tolerance (Fig. 8D). We also germinated 5ptase13 mutant seeds in the presence of 0, 1, 2, and 3 μm ABA and measured the impact on germination during a 6-d period. As expected, germination of wild-type seeds was delayed by ABA in a concentration-dependent manner during the 6-d period under light conditions (Fig. 8, E and F). In contrast, 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutant seeds were ABA insensitive, reaching 100% germination on day 2 in the presence of 1 μm ABA and 78% to 90% on day 6 in the presence of 3 μm ABA (Fig. 8, E and F). Since we did not find reduced seed dormancy in our mutants (data not shown), this ABA insensitivity of 5ptase13 mutants most likely does not correlate with changes in de novo synthesis of ABA (CITATION) and is in accordance with the previously reported results for ABA insensitivity of the 5ptase13-1 mutant (CITATION). To determine whether there are differences in the expression patterns of Glc- and/or ABA-regulated genes (RD29A, KIN1, and CAB1 genes; CITATION) in 5ptase13 mutants, we examined expression in 4-d-old dark-grown wild-type and 5ptase13 seedlings exposed to 6% Glc for 3 d (Fig. 9A ). Treatment with 6% Glc strongly induced the expression of RD29A and KIN1 in wild-type seedlings. In contrast, 5ptase13-1 and 5ptase13-2 mutants grown in 6% Glc contained much smaller increases in RD29A and KIN1 transcript levels (Fig. 9A), indicating that induction of these genes is diminished, but not abolished, in 5ptase13 mutants. The regulation of CAB1, on the other hand, was not significantly altered in 5ptase13 mutants. [[FIGURE]] To ensure that the alterations noted in 5ptase13 mutants are due to loss of 5PTase13 expression, we expressed a 5PTase13:GFP fusion under the control of the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in wild-type and 5ptase13-1 plants (13:GFP and 13-1/13:GFP plants, respectively). We examined two lines of 13-1/13:GFP plants with good expression of the transgene (Fig. 9B) along with wild-type and 5ptase13-1 plants in ABA-sensitivity assays. Both 13-1/13:GFP lines exhibited more ABA sensitivity in germination assays compared with 5ptase13 mutants (Fig. 9C). Since 5ptase13-1 mutants contain decreased SnRK1 activity under low-nutrient conditions compared with wild-type plants (47%; Fig. 6B), we also measured SnRK1 activity in the 13-1/13:GFP-1 and 13-1/13:GFP-2 lines and found, as expected, similar or increased SnRK1 activity compared with wild-type plants (140% ± 10% for 13-1/13:GFP-1 and 102% ± 5% for 13-1/13:GFP-2). We conclude that expression of the 5PTase13:GFP transgene complements the 5ptase13-1 mutant. We examined whether the Glc insensitivity of 5ptase13 mutants is accompanied by alterations in mass InsP3 levels by measuring mass InsP3 levels. The results in Figure 10 indicate that neither 5ptase13-1 nor 5ptase13-2 mutant seedlings differ significantly from wild-type seedlings in their InsP3 mass levels under control conditions. When wild-type seedlings are exposed to 6% Glc for 3 d, mass InsP3 levels increase 2.8- to 3.7-fold, which is a statistically significant elevation. However, when 5ptase13 mutants are grown for 3 d in the presence of 6% Glc, mass InsP3 level changes are smaller, with an increase of 1.6- to 2-fold over basal levels, and statistically significant only in the 5ptase13-2 mutant. More importantly, the Glc-stimulated InsP3 levels in both 5ptase13 mutants differ significantly from the Glc-stimulated InsP3 levels in wild-type seedlings. We conclude that 5ptase13 mutants are impaired in their ability to accumulate InsP3 in response to Glc and that this correlates with the sugar and ABA insensitivity noted in the germination assays. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the subcellular location of the 5PTase13 protein, we performed imaging experiments with 5ptase13-1 mutants complemented with the 5PTase13:GFP construct (13-1/13:GFP plants) and wild-type plants containing the same 5PTase13:GFP construct. As the 5PTase13:GFP construct we used allowed for complementation of the ABA and sugar insensitivity phenotype in 5ptase13-1 mutants (Fig. 9, B and C), it is likely that this fusion protein undergoes the same posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization as the native 5PTase13 protein. We analyzed T2 progeny from two independent 13-1/13:GFP lines with fluorescence deconvolution microscopy and found a similar pattern in both lines. GFP fluorescence was associated with the nucleus in many, but not all, cells in cotyledon epidermis (Fig. 11, B and C ), hypocotyls (data not shown), and roots (Fig. 11, D–I). Nuclei from some but not all guard cells contained the 13:GFP protein (Fig. 11C). To confirm the nuclear localization, we stained 13-1/13:GFP seedlings with the nuclear dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and imaged GFP and DAPI fluorescence simultaneously (Fig. 11, D–I). Once again, we found 13:GFP fluorescence in only a portion of root nuclei, while DAPI fluorescence was present in all nuclei. We conclude that 5PTase13 protein is located in the nucleus of seedlings and that its presence in the nucleus is restricted in some cells. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! BLASTp was used to identify 12 related WD40 regions. ClustalW and PAUP4.0 were used to generate phylogenetic trees using parsimony. One thousand bootstraps were performed. The Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3 was used (BD Biosciences Clontech). The cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1 to 533 of 5PTase13 was amplified by PCR and ligated into pGBKT7 bait vector (BD Biosciences Clontech), verified by DNA sequencing, and transformed into yeast strain AH109. The yeast strain AH109 containing the 5PTase13 WD40 repeat domain was transformed with an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 3-d-old etiolated seedling cDNA library (Thelogis). Screening for interactors was performed with SD/-Ade-His-Leu-Trp, 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and 20 μg mL−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside plates. Candidate clones that grew were rescued from yeast and retested in the original bait and control strains. Prey plasmids that passed all tests were sequenced to identify the Arabidopsis gene insert. Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia was used for all experiments. Growth conditions of soil-grown plants have been described (CITATION). Regular-light conditions were 100 μE for 16-h days, while low-light conditions were 40 μE for 16-h days. 5ptase13-1 (At1g05630, SAIL_350_F1) and 5ptase13-2 (SALK_081991) mutants were identified from the SIGnAL database (CITATION). Methods for PCR screening of mutants has been described (CITATION) and utilized SALK and SAIL LB primers and 5PTase13 gene-specific primers (13-1for, 13-1rev, 13-2for, and 13-2rev; Supplemental Table S4). The resulting PCR fragments were sequenced to map the T-DNA insertions. Conditions for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR have been described previously (CITATION) and used the primers listed in Supplemental Table S4. Amplification of the WD40 region of 5PTase13 was performed using primers 13WD40for and 13WD40rev. Conditions for actin (CITATION), KIN1 (CITATION), and RD29A (CITATION) amplification have been described and generate 428-, 342-, and 715-bp products, respectively. Each RT-PCR experiment was independently repeated at least two times to verify the observed changes in expression. Age-matched seeds used for assays were harvested from plants grown in parallel on the same shelf in a growth room, and seeds were harvested on the same day and ripened for 6 weeks at room temperature. Seeds were surface sterilized and plated on no salts or 0.5× MS salts solution (pH 5.7) containing 0.8% agar. Seeds were stratified on plates at 4°C for 3 d and germinated at 23°C in the light or dark. For seed germination and root growth assays, seeds were plated on medium containing 0%, 1%, 3%, or 6% Glc or mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 6%, or 11% Suc (Sigma-Aldrich) in the light or dark at 23°C. Germination was scored as positive when the radicle protruded through the seed coat. For ABA sensitivity experiments, ABA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100% ethanol and added to cooled, sterile medium at a final concentration of 1, 2, or 3 μm ABA. The germination assay was performed as before. Hormone/sugar treatment experiments were repeated two or three times. The entire open reading frame (encoding 535 amino acids) of At3g01090 was amplified with gene-specific primers SnRK1.1pFor and SnRK1.1pRev (Supplemental Table S4) and ligated to pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector. This resulted in pSnRKV5, which directed expression of a 61.7-kD SnRK1.1 protein with a C-terminal 6xHis tag and V5 epitope tag (Invitrogen). The WD40 repeat region of 5PTase13 was amplified with gene-specific primers WD40For and WD40Rev (Supplemental Table S4) and ligated to pCRT7/NT-TOPO vector. This resulted in p13WDX, which directed expression of a 65.9-kD protein that corresponds to the WD40 region of 5PTase13 and an N-terminal 6xHis tag and Xpress epitope (Invitrogen). For expression, pSnRKV5 and p13WDX were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Invitrogen), and the resulting recombinant proteins 13WDX and SnRKV5 were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose columns (Invitrogen). SnRKV5 protein appeared on the SDS protein gel as two separate bands. These bands represented an active SnRKV5 recombinant protein as determined by the SnRK1 activity assay. For the immunoprecipitation, between 40 and 90 ng of the purified and dialyzed proteins was used. The immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out as described by CITATION. Western-blot conditions were as described previously (CITATION). For detection of either the V5 or the Xpress epitope tag, a 1:5,000 dilution of the mouse anti-V5 or anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody, followed by a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham), was used. Purified positope protein (175 ng; Invitrogen) was loaded on the same gel to estimate the amount of recombinant V5- or Xpress-tagged proteins. Whole 7-d-old seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamide, 3 mm glycerophosphate, and plant protease cocktail; Sigma). After centrifugation at 13.2 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant to 40% saturation while stirring for 10 min at 4°C and centrifuged for 15 min at 13.2 rpm and 4°C. Precipitated protein was resuspended in 50 μL of fractionation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamide, 3 mm glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, and plant protease cocktail; Sigma). Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method (CITATION), and equal amounts of protein were added to each assay. SnRK1 activity assay was performed as described by CITATION with slight modifications. Protein extract (5 μg in 5 μL) was mixed with 5 μL of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0), 5 μL of sterile water, 5 μL of SPS peptide stock solution (peptide sequence RDHMPRIRSEMQIWSED; 200 μm), and 5 μL of labeled ATP stock solution (5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm unlabeled ATP, and 125 mm magnesium chloride). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30°C, and 10-μL aliquots were spotted twice onto P81 paper. The pieces were washed three times in 125 mm phosphoric acid for 20 min each and transferred to scintillation vials for counting. Two different control reactions were examined along with each reaction assay. The first reaction control contained no SPS peptide, and the second control contained no protein extract. Activity was expressed as nanomoles of phosphate incorporated into peptide per minute per milligram of protein. The assay was performed using two independently prepared extracts and three replicates of each extract. Conditions described by CITATION were followed. Briefly, 7-d-old light-grown seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm NaCl), and centrifuged at 13.2 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Purified recombinant SnRK1.1-V5 (SnRKV5; 500 ng) and total cell extracts (30 μg) were mixed in a reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm ATP) and incubated at 30°C for the indicated times. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Amersham). Ponceau S staining was performed to ensure that equivalent amounts of extracts were analyzed. The 3,408-bp coding region of 5PTase13 minus the stop codon was amplified by high-fidelity PCR, confirmed by sequencing, cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and recombined via the Gateway system (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's instructions into pK7FWG2. The resulting 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter:5PTase13:GFP construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens by cold shock and was used in the transformation of 5ptase13-1 and wild-type plants as described (CITATION). 13-1/13:GFP seedlings were identified on kanamycin plates and by screening for GFP production using a Zeiss Axioimager microscope equipped with fluorescence optics. Two independent complemented lines with detectable GFP expression (13-1/13:GFP-1 and 13-1/13:GFP-2) were used in growth assays and for subcellular localization. Seven-day-old seedlings were used for imaging utilizing Axiovision software (Zeiss). Z-stack series of 15 to 20 1-μm sections were collected, and deconvolution with an iterative algorithm was applied. The resulting deconvolved images were reconstituted into a single image using the maximal intensity projection function of Axiovision. To visualize nuclei, seedlings were stained with 1 μg mL−1 DAPI (Molecular Probes) solution for 5 min, excess liquid was removed, and the seedlings were mounted in water. Photographs were taken with a Zeiss MC100 camera. GFP was imaged with a filter set consisting of an excitation filter of 540 to 580 nm, a dichroic mirror of 595 nm, and a barrier filter of 600 to 660 nm. DAPI staining was visualized with a standard UV fluorescence filter set. Filters containing whole 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings were floated on a 6% Glc solution (0.5× MS salts, pH 5.7) or on a control solution (0.5× MS salts, pH 5.7, only) in the dark for 3 d and then frozen in liquid nitrogen at the end of the treatment. Tissues were harvested and mass InsP3 measurements were made as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). The assays were performed in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated two times. Raw values for InsP3 in Glc-treated samples are as follows: WT1, 1,313 ± 203 pmol g−1; WT2, 1,313 ± 372 pmol g−1. The histological analysis was performed as described (CITATION) with slight modifications. Seven-day-old wild-type and mutant cotyledons of soil-grown seedlings in a growth room were fixed in ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid solution (6:3:1) overnight at 4°C and cleared sequentially in 80% ethanol, 95% ethanol overnight at 4°C, and 10% NaOH for 1 h at 42°C. Cotyledons then were stained briefly (30 s to 2 min) in 0.002% safranin-O (Sigma). Specimens were mounted on slides in 50% glycerol and visualized with differential interference contrast on a Zeiss Axioimager microscope and Spot digital camera (Zeiss). A total of 50 cotyledons per variant were used.
