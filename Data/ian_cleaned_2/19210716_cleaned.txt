!~ABS~!   ZIP transporters (ZRT, IRT‐like proteins) are involved in the transport of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and other divalent metal cations. The expression of IRT3, a ZIP transporter, is higher in the Zn/cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri than is that of its ortholog in Arabidopsis thaliana, which implies a positive association of its expression with Zn accumulation in A. halleri.  IRT3 genes from both A. halleri and A. thaliana functionally complemented the Zn uptake mutant Spzrt1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe; and Zn uptake double mutant zrt1zrt2, Fe‐uptake mutant fet3fet4 and conferred Zn and Fe uptake activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By contrast, the manganese (Mn) uptake mutant smf1 phenotypes were not rescued. Insufficient Cd uptake for toxicity was found.  Expression of IRT3‐green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in Arabidopsis root protoplasts indicated localization of both IRT3 proteins in the plasma membrane.  Overexpressing AtIRT3 in A. thaliana led to increased accumulation of Zn in the shoot and Fe in the root of transgenic lines. Therefore, IRT3 functions as a Zn and Fe‐uptake transporter in Arabidopsis. 
!~RES~! To characterize the IRT3 in A. halleri, cDNA corresponding to IRT3 was cloned by RT‐PCR from leaf tissues of A. halleri ssp. gemmifera. Primers were designed according to the sequence of the AtIRT3 coding region for the amplification of AhIRT3 cDNA. The 5′ and 3′ sequences were obtained by use of RACE, as described in the Materials and Methods section. The deduced amino acid sequence of AhIRT3 was 381 amino acids. AhIRT3 contains eight predicted transmembrane domains, similar to AtIRT1, AtIRT2 and AtIRT3, and a histidine‐rich putative metal‐binding domain with high similarity to AtIRT3 (91% identity) and AhZIP4 (78% identity) (Vert et al., 2001). The amino acid residue E103 in AtIRT1 suggested to be responsible for Zn transport (Rogers et al., 2000) is conserved in AhIRT3, but the Fe‐ and Mn‐responsible residue D100 of AtIRT1 is not conserved in AhIRT3. Sequence alignment of AtIRT1, AtIRT2, AtIRT3, AtZIP4 and AhIRT3 indicated that AhIRT3 protein has the highest sequence homology to AtIRT3 protein apart from a deletion in the N‐terminus (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic tree of available ZIP and IRT gene sequences revealed all known IRT or ZIP genes from both A. halleri and A. thaliana clustered together as pairs (see the Supporting Information, Fig. S1). It also showed that the IRT3s and the Fe‐regulated transporters IRT1s/IRT2s belong to distinct phylogenetic clades. By contrast, IRT3 clustered closely with ZIP4s and several ZNT transporter genes from Thlaspi species, which implies that IRT3s may be functionally more related to Zn transporters.  [[FIGURE]] As a first step for the functional characterization of IRT3 proteins, we tested whether IRT3 genes can complement S. pombe and S. cerevisiae mutants. Both AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 complemented the Zn uptake deficiency of a S. pombe mutant strain disrupted in SpZrt1 (Boch et al., 2008). Unlike mutant cells carrying the empty vector, cells expressing AtIRT3 or AhIRT3 were able to grow at low external Zn concentrations supplied in regular media (Fig. 2).  [[FIGURE]] To further examine the uptake activity of other metals, we also tested whether IRT3 genes can complement other S. cerevisiae mutants. As shown in Fig. 3, both AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 complement the Zn uptake‐deficient double mutant zrt1zrt2 as efficiently as does AtIRT1. Interestingly, both IRT3 genes can complement fet3fet4 at low pH but not at high pH conditions (Fig. S2). Neither AtIRT3 nor AhIRT3 confers the ability to take up Mn thus unable to complement the smf1 mutant. When expressed in a wild‐type strain BY4741, in contrast to the expression of AtIRT1, no toxicity phenotype was seen in yeast cells expressing AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 in the presence of Cd (Fig. 3c,d). Thus, IRT3 genes from both Arabidopsis species function similarly in yeast and are potential Zn and Fe transporters. However, the Fe transport activity of AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 is much less than or different from that of AtIRT1.  [[FIGURE]] Following yeast complementation studies, we tested AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 expressed in S. cerevisiae zrt1zrt2 for their 65Zn uptake activity. We performed the uptake experiments in the presence of 10 µm Zn as a substrate. AtIRT3‐ and AhIRT3‐dependent Zn uptake was low at the pH condition used but still significantly different from that of the empty vector control (Fig. 4a). AtIRT1 was used as a positive control. The Zn uptake activity of AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 was comparable to that mediated by AtIRT1 for 20 min after the addition of Zn.  [[FIGURE]] On the basis of complementation results, to investigate Fe uptake ability of the two heterologously expressed IRT3 proteins, we tested competition by Fe in comparison with that in AtIRT1. Figure 4b shows that 65Zn uptake was strongly inhibited with Fe by c. 50% for all three proteins tested.  The 65Zn uptake ability of AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 and Fe inhibition of the uptake further support the proteins’ abilities in the uptake of Zn and Fe in yeast (Fig. 3). More detailed kinetic analyses are needed to reveal the full biochemical properties of these two transporters, but these are currently beyond the scope of the present study.  To characterize the subcellular localization of IRT3 proteins in plant cells, CaMV35S promoter‐driven chimeric genes encoding a C‐terminal GFP fusion of AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 proteins were constructed. The recombinant DNA was purified and transfected into A. thaliana root protoplasts for transient expression. The GFP signals for both constructs of AtIRT3–GFP and AhIRT3–GFP were enriched on the plasma membrane, whereas cytosolic GFP remained only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). Together with yeast complementation data, this finding suggests that both IRT3 proteins function as Zn and Fe‐uptake transporters in the plasma membrane.  [[FIGURE]] Using Q‐PCR, we investigated the expression of IRT3 genes in both A. thaliana and A. halleri under different Zn and Fe conditions. In general, the expression of IRT3 was higher in A. halleri than in A. thaliana. Under normal conditions, AhIRT3 was expressed approx. threefold higher than AtIRT3 in both root and shoot tissues. Both AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 could be induced under Zn‐deficient conditions and repressed by excess Zn (Fig. S3). Moreover, under Zn‐deficient conditions, AtIRT3 in A. thaliana was induced to a substantially higher level in shoots than roots, reaching an expression level similar to or higher than that of AhIRT3 in A. halleri. This Zn regulation of IRT3 expression is consistent between A. halleri ssp. gemmifera (this study) and A. halleri ssp. halleri (Talke et al., 2006).  To examine the expression pattern of AtIRT3, a 597 bp fragment upstream of AtIRT3, containing the putative promoter region (528 bp) of intergenic sequences (633 bp) and partial 5′UTR, was fused with a GUS reporter gene for transforming A. thaliana. Among 12 transgenic lines checked, nine lines showed GUS activity. One of the nine lines showed weak GUS activity. The GUS staining indicated that the AtIRT3 promoter was constitutively expressed in all tissues and at all stages (Fig. 6a,c,e,g,i,k,m). Histochemical studies revealed that GUS activity was downregulated under excess Zn and upregulated under Zn deficiency in seven PAtIRT3:GUS transgenic plants but not in PCaMV35S:GUS transgenic plants and one of eight lines with strong GUS activity (Fig. S4). Although GUS activities of plants grown under different Zn conditions do not differ greatly, the data suggest that transcriptional regulation may be involved in the differential IRT3 transcript accumulation in response to environmental Zn availability.  [[FIGURE]] Detailed cytohistology confirmed the ubiquitous activity of the AtIRT3 promoter in all living cell types in leaf, including guard cells (Fig. 6o) and trichomes (data not shown). A similar phenomenon was also observed in the root (Fig. 6p) and root hairs (data not shown). The AtIRT3 promoter was especially active in root stele, and GUS activity was clear in passage cells (Fig. 6p).  From the results described, we conclude that AtIRT3 and AhIRT3 share qualitatively comparable biochemical properties in metal transport. To investigate whether the high expression of IRT3 contributes to high accumulation of Zn, we constructed A. thaliana transgenic lines heterologously overexpressing AtIRT3 driven by a CaMV35S promoter. The expression of AtIRT3 in the root and shoot of four transgenic lines was confirmed by RT‐PCR (Fig. 7a). The transgenic lines showed no obvious phenotype. The dry weight of these transgenic lines did not significantly change under Zn treatments (Fig. S5). Metal content analysis indicated that roots in all four lines accumulated Zn levels similar to that of the wild‐type when grown in the normal condition (Fig. 7b). Two lines, OE2‐6 and OE6‐7, with relatively high expression of AtIRT3 (Fig. 7a), accumulated substantially higher levels of Zn (up to 25% more) in shoots than did the wild type (Fig. 7b). Intriguingly, the level of Fe was markedly higher (by more than twofold in OE2‐6) in the roots of all transgenic lines than in wild‐type roots (Fig. 7b). The concentrations of additional divalent essential metals, Mn, Cu, Mo, Mg and Ca, were also comparable in the root and shoot of wild‐type and transgenic lines (Fig. S6).  [[FIGURE]] Taken together, these data indicate that the increased expression of AtIRT3 specifically resulted in high levels of Zn accumulation in the shoot and Fe accumulation in the root without affecting the accumulation of Mn, Cu, Mo, Mg or Ca. 
!~MM~! To clone AhIRT3, total RNA was extracted from A. halleri ssp. gemmifera with use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). First‐strand cDNA was synthesized with the oligo‐dT (5′‐(T)24VN‐3′) primer from l µg of total RNA with use of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers designed according to the sequence of AtIRT3 were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of full‐length AhIRT3. A SMART RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for cloning the 5′ and 3′ extended sequence. The RACE‐Ready cDNA samples were diluted 10 times with tricine‐ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer for the subsequent RACE‐PCR reaction. Two gene‐specific primers, 5′‐TCCAGAGGCAATGGCTGCTACTTCA‐3′ and 5′‐GCAACCAAGGGAACAACAATACCCG‐3′, were designed according to the AhIRT3 sequence for use in 5′ and 3′ RACE, respectively.  To express IRT3 genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, AtIRT3 (containing 1.2‐kb of full‐length coding sequence) was PCR amplified from cDNA by use of a 5′ primer (5′‐GAGTCGACAATGTTCTTCGTCGATGTTCTTT‐3′) with a SalI restriction site, and a 3′ primer (5′‐AGGAGCGGTTAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGAGAA‐3′) with a BsrBI restriction site. The PCR fragment was restricted with SalI and BsrBI and cloned into the pSLF173 (Forsburg & Sherman, 1997) vector for expression in S. pombe. The same strategy was used to clone AhIRT3 into pSLF173 with a 5′ primer (5′‐GACTCGAGAATGGCTGCTACTTCATCTAAT‐3′) containing an XhoI site and a 3′ primer (5′‐AGGAGCGGTTAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGAGAA‐3′) containing a BsrBI site.  To express IRT3 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a NotI PCR fragment of the AtIRT3 1.2‐kb of full‐length coding sequence was amplified, restricted and cloned into the pFL61 vector with a 5′ primer (5′‐GAGCGGCCGCATGTTCTTCGTCGATGTTCTTT‐3′) and a 3′ primer (5′‐AGGCGGCCGCTTAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGAGAA‐3′) containing a designed NotI site for expression in S. cerevisiae. The same strategy was employed to clone AhIRT3 into pFL61 with a 5′ primer (5′‐GAGCGGCCGCATGGCTGCTACTTCATCTAAT‐3′) and a 3′ primer (5′‐AGGCGGCCGCTTAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGAGAA‐3′), and AtIRT1 with a 5′ primer (5′‐GAGCGGCCGCATGAAAACAATCTTCCTCGTAC‐3′) and a 3′ primer (5′‐AGGCGGCCGCTTAAGCCCATTTGGCGATAATCGACAT‐3′).  To construct C‐terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with AtIRT3, the full‐length AtIRT3 coding region was PCR amplified with a 5′ primer (5′‐AGTCTAGAATGTTCTTCGTCGATGTTCTTT‐3′) and a 3′ primer (5′‐ATGGATCCAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGA‐3′), restricted and cloned into XbaI and BamHI sites of p326GFP to create the in‐frame fusion of AtIRT3 and GFP, designated AtIRT3/326GFP. A 5′ primer (5′‐AGTCTAGAATGGCTGCTACTTCATCTAATGTT‐3′) and a 3′ primer (5′‐ATGGATCCAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGG‐3′) were used for AhIRT3/326GFP cloning.  We used the CaMV35S promoter to drive overexpression of AtIRT3 in A. thaliana. A PCR fragment of full‐length AtIRT3 coding sequence was PCR amplified with a 5′ primer (5′‐GAACATGTTCTTCGTCGATGTTCTTTGG‐3′) and a 3′ primer (5′‐AGCACGTGTTAAGCCCAAATGGCAAGAGAAGA‐3′), restricted with PciI and PmlI, and cloned into the NcoI and PmlI sites of pCAMBIA1305.1. To examine the promoter activity of AtIRT3, of 597 bp, the 528 bp upstream sequence of AtIRT3 5′‐UTR containing the promoter and partial 5′‐UTR regions according to the annotation in The Arabidopsis Information Resource was PCR amplified with a 5′ primer (5′‐GAAAGCTTGTATGATGTATTATTGCAAATTTGC‐3′) containing a HindIII site and a 3′ primer (5′‐GACCATGGAAATATGAGAATCAGACAGATC‐3′) containing a NcoI site, then restricted and cloned into pCAMBIA305.1 to create PAtIRT3:GUS (ß‐glucuronidase)/pCAMBIA1305.1 for the promoter activity assay.  Sequence alignment and phylogenic tree were analyzed with Biology WorkBench at San Diego Supercomputer Center, CA, USA (http://workbench.sdsc.edu/). The Phobius web server (http://phobius.cbr.su.se/) was used to predict transmembrane domains (Kall et al., 2007).  The S. cerevisiae strains ZHY3, DDY4, smf1 and BY4741, were grown and transformed as previously described (Rogers et al., 2000) under the selection of URA on the plasmids pFL61 and derivatives with AtIRT1, AtIRT3 and AhIRT3. The transformed yeast strains were grown on synthetic defined media (SD) supplemented with 20 g l−1 d‐glucose and necessary auxotrophic supplements for complementation test. YPD media were used for growth control of stains examined. In growth‐test experiments, 5‐µl drops of yeast culture at an optical density of 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 were spotted onto medium. Yeast strains of zrt1zrt2 ZHY3 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 zrt1::LEU2 zrt2::HIS3) were grown on SD/–ura medium (pH 5.8) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 0, 0.5 or 0.75 mm ZnCl2. Yeast strains of fet3fet4 DDY4 (MATa can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet3::HIS3 fet4::LEU2) were grown on SD/–ura medium (pH 5.5, 5.7 or 6, containing 50 mm 2‐(N‐morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES)) supplemented with 0, 50, 100 or 200 µm FeCl3. Yeast strains of smf1 (BY4741; MATa his3 leu2 met15 ura3 YOL122c::kanMX4) were grown on SD/–ura medium (pH 5.8) containing 0 or 5 mM ethylene glycol‐bis(beta‐aminoethyl ether)‐N,N,N′,N′‐tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The yeast wild‐type strains BY4741 (MATa his3 leu2 met15 ura3) were grown on SD/–ura medium (pH 6) containing 0, 5, or 10 µm CdCl2.  The S. pombe strains, wild‐type and Spzrt1 mutant harboring with the empty vector pSLF173 and IRT3 genes, were grown in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) plus 1 µm thiamine as described previously (Boch et al., 2008). Expression of IRT3 genes was under the control of the nmt1 promoter, which is suppressed by thiamine. A concentration of 1 µm in the medium results in low expression levels. For growth assays, cells were first cultivated in EMM + thiamine + 20 µm Zn2+, then harvested, washed with H2O and diluted to an optical density (OD) of 0.05 into Zn2+‐free EMM + thiamine, supplemented with different Zn2+ concentrations. Growth was determined after 22 h.  Zinc uptake assays were performed with S. cerevisiae zrt1zrt2 expressing AtIRT1, AtIRT3 or AhIRT3 in pFL61 as described by Zhao & Eide (1996). Stationary‐phase cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.3 in SD/–ura medium containing 1 mm EDTA and grown to an exponential growth phase. Cells were washed once in uptake buffer (10 mm MES, 2% (w : v) glucose, pH 6.1), and cell density was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells per 0.5 ml (OD600 = 0.4). The uptake assay was started by adding Zn2+ containing 65Zn2+ (final concentration 10 µm). Cells were incubated at 30°C in a shaking water bath, and 0.5 ml samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 µm) at the indicated times. Filters were washed with 10 ml of ice‐cold SSW (1 mm Na‐EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Na3‐citrate, pH 4.2). Cell‐associated 65Zn2+ was measured by use of a liquid scintillation counter (LS6500; Beckman, Munich, Germany).  Competition studies were done in parallel by adding 10 µm 65Zn2+ (control) or 10 µm 65Zn2+ plus 20 µm of FeCl2. An amount of 1 mm Na‐ascorbate was added to the FeCl2 culture and its control to keep Fe in a reduced state. After 5 min, 0.5 ml samples were filtered and washed as above.  Asexual propagation of A. halleri ssp. gemmifera seedlings from Fumuro, Japan, were as described previously (Chiang et al., 2006). A. halleri cuttings at the six‐leaf stage were transferred to new phytagel media for 2 wk to generate roots. Both A. halleri and A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia‐0) were cultured in the growth chamber with light intensity at 70 µmol m−2 s−1 under a 16‐h light : 8‐h dark cycle at 22°C. To detect IRT3 expression, rooted A. halleri or A. thaliana seedlings were grown for 4 wk or 2 wk, respectively, in half‐strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) phytagel media, then transferred to normal (half‐strength MS), iron‐deficient (lack of iron with additional 100 µm FerroZine), Zn‐deficient (lack of ZnSO4) and excess Zn (additional 100 µm ZnSO4 for A. thaliana and 1 mm ZnSO4 for A. halleri) media for 5 d. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the plasmid 35S:AtIRT3/pCAMBIA1305.1 was used to transform A. thaliana, Col‐0, by in planta transformation. Fourteen‐day‐old Arabidopsis root tissues were used for protoplast isolation modified from the methods for mesophyll protoplasts (Sheen, 2001); http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb/protocols_reg/protocols_reg_.php). Instead of cutting leaf tissue, we cut roots to small pieces before cell wall digestion.  For localization experiments, p326GFP, AtIRT3/326GFP and AhIRT3/326GFP were introduced separately into root protoplasts with solution consisting of 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.2 m mannitol and 0.1 M CaCl2. After transfection, the protoplasts were incubated in a Zn‐deficient condition (W5 solution with 10 µm N,N,N′,N′‐Tetrakis‐(2‐pyridylmethyl)‐ethylenediamine (TPEN); Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in the dark at room temperature overnight before observation by confocal microscopy.  Roots and shoots were harvested separately and washed with 10 mm CaCl2 for 20 min and H2O for 10 min. Samples were dried at 70°C for 3 d. Shoot samples (c. 60 mg) and root samples (c. 20 mg) from 25 plants were transferred into a Teflon vessel and digested with 2 ml 65% HNO3 and 0.5 ml H2O2 (both Suprapur; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a MarsXpress microwave digestion system (CEM, Matthews, NC, USA). Tomato leaves (SRM‐1573a) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were used as a reference. The volume of the solution after digestion was adjusted to 8 ml with H2O and filtered by use of a 0.45‐µm membrane filter. The concentrations of Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mo, Mg and Ca in digested samples were analysed by use of inductively coupled plasma‐optical emission spectrometry (ICP‐OES) (OPTIMA 5300; Perkin‐Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). The concentration of each element in the sample was determined in triplicate.  The GFP fluorescence of root protoplasts transfected with AtIRT3/326GFP and AhIRT3/326GFP was observed on confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The samples were visualized with excitation set at 488 nm and emission signal recovered between 500 and 530 nm for GFP, and excitation at 543 nm and emission signal recovered above 560 nm for autofluorescence signal. For GUS staining, plant tissues were incubated in GUS solution containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mg ml−1 5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indoyl‐β‐d‐glucuronide (X‐Gluc), 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X‐100 at 37°C for 5 h or 16 h. The stained tissues were sequentially bleached with 50%, 75% and 95% ethyl alcohol to remove chlorophyll. For histological observations, stained roots and leaves of 18‐d‐old PAtIRT3:GUS transgenic plants (1 × 1 mm) were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in LR white resin (London Resin Company, London, UK). Then the block was trimmed and cut in thin cross‐sections (3 µm) by use of a Leica UltraCut E microtome (Leica, Solms, Germany). Cross‐sections were observed with a AXIO Imager Z1 (Carl Zeiss) and photographed with a digital camera AxioCam HRc (Carl Zeiss).  Total RNA from A. halleri‐ or A. thaliana‐treated tissue was isolated by use of the pine tree method as described (Chang et al., 1993). One‐microgram samples of total RNA were used for synthesizing cDNA. For RT‐PCR, transcript‐specific primers for 5′ (5′‐TCTCAGCAACAGAGTCCATTT‐3′) and 3′ (5′‐GGTTGTGAGGGCGAAAAAA‐3′) were designed for the amplification of a 962‐bp fragment for each gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C and 60 s at 72°C. The Q‐PCR procedure was described previously (Chiang et al., 2006). Primers 5′‐GCCCTCACAACCCCGATAG‐3′ and 5′‐GCTCCGACACTGTGAGAATTGA‐3′ were used for the detection of AtIRT3 expression; and 5′‐GCCCTCACAAGCCCGATA‐3′ and 5′‐TGCTCCGACGCTGTGAGA‐3′ for AhIRT3. Actin8 was chosen as an internal control because of its stable expression and high homology in both species. To ensure similar PCR efficiency for both species, we used the same pair of primers for this actin8 control, 5′‐TTACCCGACGGACAAGTGATC‐3′ and 5′‐ATGATGGCTGGAAAAGGACTTC‐3′, to detect high‐homology short targets. In several Zn treatments, actin8 was expressed similarly and was within one‐cycle difference in both species. The Q‐PCR involved at least two biological replicates. The efficiency tests for the use of primers and data calculation followed the manufacturer's instructions (ABI PRISM 7000; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).  Data were expressed as mean ± SD. An unpaired two‐tailed t‐test was used to analyse significant differences between controls and treatments.
