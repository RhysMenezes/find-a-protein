!~ABS~! CRK5 is a member of the Arabidopsis thaliana Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase-related kinase family. Here, we show that inactivation of CRK5 inhibits primary root elongation and delays gravitropic bending of shoots and roots. Reduced activity of the auxin-induced DR5–green fluorescent protein reporter suggests that auxin is depleted from crk5 root tips. However, no tip collapse is observed and the transcription of genes for auxin biosynthesis, AUXIN TRANSPORTER/AUXIN TRANSPORTER-LIKE PROTEIN (AUX/LAX) auxin influx, and PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers is unaffected by the crk5 mutation. Whereas AUX1, PIN1, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 display normal localization, PIN2 is depleted from apical membranes of epidermal cells and shows basal to apical relocalization in the cortex of the crk5 root transition zone. This, together with an increase in the number of crk5 lateral root primordia, suggests facilitated auxin efflux through the cortex toward the elongation zone. CRK5 is a plasma membrane–associated kinase that forms U-shaped patterns facing outer lateral walls of epidermis and cortex cells. Brefeldin inhibition of exocytosis stimulates CRK5 internalization into brefeldin bodies. CRK5 phosphorylates the hydrophilic loop of PIN2 in vitro, and PIN2 shows accelerated accumulation in brefeldin bodies in the crk5 mutant. Delayed gravitropic response of the crk5 mutant thus likely reflects defective phosphorylation of PIN2 and deceleration of its brefeldin-sensitive membrane recycling.
!~RES~! CRK5 (called alternatively PIP-D) was originally identified in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro protein binding assays as a potential interaction partner of the C-terminal WD40-repeat domain of nuclear PRL1 protein, a subunit of the spliceosome-activating complex (CITATION; CITATION). Although subsequent studies did not confirm in vivo formation of a CRK5-PRL1 complex under normal growth conditions, we found that inactivation of the CRK5 gene by a T-DNA insertion in the MPIZ mutant line 38225 (crk5-1; CITATION; see Supplemental Figure 1A online) resulted in reduced primary root elongation (Figure 1A), analogously to the prl1 mutation (CITATION). By contrast, a second T-DNA insertion in the CRK5 gene (Salk_003774, crk5-2) obtained from the SIGnAL collection (CITATION) failed to confer a root elongation detect. Characterization of the mutant alleles indicated that in crk5-1 a T-DNA insertion was located 54 bp downstream of the ATG codon in the first exon, whereas in crk5-2, a single T-DNA insert was identified 167 bp 5′-upstream of the ATG codon (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of homozygous T-DNA–tagged lines detected no transcript from the crk5-1 allele, indicating that it is a null mutation. On the other hand, insertion of the pROK2 T-DNA (CITATION) into the untranslated leader region fused the coding region of the CRK5 gene with an upstream T-DNA left border carrying a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Consequently, the full-length CRK5 coding region was transcribed by the 35S promoter in the crk5-2 line, correlating with its wild-type phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). To verify that the root elongation defect, reducing the root length by ∼30% in the crk5-1 mutant compared with the wild type, was indeed caused by inactivation of CRK5, we constructed modified versions of CRK5 by replacing its stop codon with coding regions of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (uidA/GUS) reporters (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). Introduction of the gCRK5:GFP construct into the crk5-1 mutant restored root elongation to the wild type, indicating genetic complementation of the mutation (Figure 1A). [[FIGURE]] To analyze tissue- and organ-specific expression of CRK5 during plant development, the gCRK5:GUS construct was transformed into wild-type and crk5-1 mutant plants. Whereas qRT-PCR comparison of relative transcript levels indicated that CRK5 was active in most plant organs, showing the highest transcript levels in flower buds and young flowers, characterization of gCRK5:GUS expression by histochemical GUS staining revealed that CRK5 was expressed in the root and shoot meristems; root pericycle; hypocotyl and leaf vasculature; stem vascular bundles; petals, sepals, anther filaments and pistils of flowers; and siliques (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Further analysis of altered developmental traits indicated that crk5-1 seedlings produced 25 to 30% more lateral roots compared with the wild type (Figure 1B). Enhancement of lateral root formation in crk5-1 suggested a possible alteration of auxin distribution leading to increased auxin transport toward the elongation zone (CITATION). As this potential disturbance of normal auxin transport would be expected to affect the regulation of gravitropic root bending, we compared gravitropic responses of the wild type and crk5-1. Seedlings were subjected to 135° rotation after growing vertically for 1 week (Figure 1C). After 12 h of gravistimulation, 83% of the wild type but only 28% of crk5-1 roots showed a bending of 90°. After 24 h, 55% of wild-type roots were already curved by 135° but 82% of crk5-1 roots showed only 90° bending (Figure 1D). These data revealed that the crk5-1 mutation caused a marked delay in the root gravitropic response. Lugol staining of starch-containing columella cells of wild-type and crk5-1 mutant roots revealed an identical pattern, indicating that the crk5-1 mutation did not cause alteration in the accumulation of starch statoliths (Figure 1E). Surprisingly, we found that, following a 90° rotation to a horizontal position in the darkness, inflorescence stems of crk5-1 showed a maximum of 45° upward bending within 3 h, while wild-type stems were oriented vertically by bending 90° (Figure 1F). This indicated that the crk5-1 mutation also caused a delay in the shoot gravitropic response. As expected, the gCRK5:GFP complementing construct restored impaired root and shoot gravitropic responses of the crk5-1 mutant to the wild type. CRK5 is one of the eight members of the Arabidopsis CRK family, which share very similar structural and biochemical features with CRKs characterized in other plant species (CITATION). N-terminal sequences of CRKs show high variability, except for two conserved domains corresponding to an MGxC myristoylation and palmitoylation motif and a downstream putative nuclear localization signal, which are also present in CRK5 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Ala replacements of Gly-2 and Cys-4 positions of the MGxC motive were demonstrated to abolish membrane association, leading to mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) CRK1 (CITATION). Within their central Ser/Thr kinase domains, including the ATP binding, active-site, and activation T-loop sequences, CRKs show over 80% sequence identity (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). All CRKs undergo autoactivation by self-phosphorylation in vitro. Arabidopsis CRK3 and CRK6 autophosphorylate their T-loop Ser-311 and Ser-310 residues (CITATION), which correspond to the Ser-315 position in CRK5 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). All so far known CRKs, including CRK5, share a conserved C-terminal calmodulin (CaM) binding domain, which overlaps with the kinase autoinhibitory domain (CITATION). Selective CaM binding in the presence of Ca2+ simulates autophosphorylation but leads only to marginal increase of substrate phosphorylation by CRKs, which are equally active without CaM in the presence of either Ca2+ or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We examined several properties of CRK5, finding that they were highly similar to those of other biochemically characterized members of the CRK family. Recombinant CRK5 purified via an N-terminal His6-tag underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated the myelin basic protein substrate similarly in the presence of both Ca2+ and EGTA (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Similarly to tomato CRK1, upon transient expression of the gCRK5:GFP construct in Arabidopsis protoplasts, CRK5-GFP was localized to the PM (Figure 2A). Following stable expression in an Arabidopsis root cell culture, CRK5-GFP was exclusively detected in the PM-containing purified microsomal fraction but not in the cytosolic and cell wall fractions by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 2B). Furthermore, in root epidermal cells of stably transformed wild-type plants, CRK5-GFP showed colocalization with the PM-specific dye FM4-64, indicating that CRK5 is a PM-associated protein kinase (Figure 2C). [[FIGURE]] CRK5-GFP displayed particularly strong expression in the root tips. Confocal laser microscopy imaging highlighted polar localization of CRK5-GFP in U-shape patterns, which were oriented toward the lateral (surface facing) walls of epidermal, cortex, and lateral root cap cells and basal (root tip facing) membranes of columella tiers (Figures 3A to 3C). CRK5-GFP also decorated the pericycle in the lateral root initiation zone and showed epidermis-facing polar localization in dividing cells of early stage (i.e., stage I to II) root primordia. CRK5-GFP was also detectable in the lateral root vasculature and reproduced the same pattern in elongating root primordia as seen in different cell types of the main root apex (Figures 3D to 3F). [[FIGURE]] Membrane localization of CRK5-GFP confirmed by counter-staining with FM4-64 was gradually reduced in epidermal cells of roots during treatment with 50 µM BFA. Following transient accumulation of BFA bodies, CRK5-GFP showed differential localization compared with FM4-64 as the GFP signal became detectable also in the area of cell nuclei (Figure 4). Brefeldin-sensitive internalization of CRK5-GFP thus suggested that polar localization of CRK5 is likely mediated by the BFA-sensitive membrane recycling pathway. [[FIGURE]] To visualize redistribution of auxin during gravistimulation of roots (CITATION), we introgressed the auxin-inducible DR5-GFP reporter into the crk5-1 mutant. In vertically grown roots, DR5-GFP expression levels were significantly lower in the columella tiers and root cap of the crk5-1 mutant compared with the wild type (Figure 5A), suggesting reduced auxin accumulation in the root apex. Control qRT-PCR measurements indicated that the crk5-1 mutation did not alter the transcription of a selected set of key genes acting in the regulation of auxin biosynthesis, including the Trp aminotransferase TAA1 (directing the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid [IAA] precursor indole-3-pyruvate), TRP2, and TRP3 (encoding the β- and α-subunits of tryptophan synthase), YUCCA3 (involved in Trp-derived auxin biosynthesis), NIT3 (nitrilase, converting indole-3-acetonitrile to IAA), AMI1 (catalyzing the conversion of indole-3-acetamide to IAA), and CYP83B1/SUR2 (regulating the threshold of auxin glycosinolates; reviewed in CITATION; see Supplemental Figure 5A online). Furthermore, the PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 genes, which show auxin-induced transcription in the root (CITATION), as well as both AUX1 and LAX3 genes, displayed comparable transcription in the roots of the wild type, crk5-1 mutant, and complemented crk5-1 line carrying the gCRK5:GFP construct (see Supplemental Figure 5B online). These data indicated that the crk5-1 mutation did not result in global change of auxin-regulated gene expression, although it led to markedly reduced expression of auxin-induced DR5-GFP reporter in the root apex. However, in contrast with PID overexpression, which induces downregulation of DR5-GFP by facilitating strong shootward auxin efflux from the root apex (CITATION), the crk5-1 mutation did not result in a collapse of root tips. [[FIGURE]] Upon gravistimulation by 135° rotation, asymmetric activation of DR5-GFP in the lower proximal lateral root cap and epidermal cells of the wild type was observed within 1 to 2 h and reached a maximum in 4 h followed by a return to the symmetric vertical pattern by 9 h (Figure 5A). In the crk5-1 mutant, induction of auxin flow from the upper section of gravistimulated roots toward the root apex restored the wild-type level of DR5-GFP expression in the columella tiers 4 to 5 h after rotating the roots. A maximum of asymmetrically localized DR5-GFP expression in the lower lateral root cap and epidermis was observed only at 9 h after application of gravistimulus, indicating an ∼5-h delay in the root gravitropic response in crk5-1 (Figure 5A). Pretreatment of wild-type roots with 10 μM 1-naphthylphtalamic acid (NPA), an inhibitor of auxin efflux, for 48 h before 6-h gravistimulation resulted in a typical upwards shift of DR5-GFP localization extending from the upper tiers of columella into the quiescent center, cortex, and endodermal files as described by CITATION. NPA treatment further reduced weak expression of DR5-GFP in the root apex of crk5-1 mutant but did not prevent asymmetric activation of DR5-GFP in the lower epidermis of upper root hair zone (Figure 5B). By contrast, 48 h of application of auxin influx inhibitor 1-naphtoxyacetic acid (NOA) completely prevented gravitropic response and resulted in similarly high levels of DR5-GFP reporter expression in the columella, cap, vascular phloem cells, and hair zones of both wild-type and crk5-1 mutant roots (Figure 5C). Restoration of normal DR5-GFP expression in the crk5-1 root apex by NOA-mediated inhibition of AUX1 thus supported the notion that delayed gravitropic bending and enhanced differentiation of lateral roots in the crk5-1 mutant could result from enhanced shootward auxin flow from the root apex. To determine how asymmetric redistribution of auxin during gravistimulation affects polar PM localization of CRK5, similar root gravitropism assays were performed with wild-type plants expressing the gCRK5:GFP construct. Polar localization patterns of CRK5-GFP remained unaltered, indicating that alterations in the auxin flow during gravistimulation of roots did not affect polar PM localization of CRK5 in the columella, root cap, epidermis, and cortex cells (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). To compare polar cellular localization of AUX1 and PIN auxin influx and efflux carriers, respectively, in wild-type and crk5-1 roots, gene constructs for expression of AUX1-YFP (for yellow fluorescent protein; CITATION), PIN1-GFP (CITATION), PIN2-GFP (CITATION), PIN3-GFP (CITATION), PIN4-GFP, and PIN7-GFP (CITATION) were introgressed into the crk5-1 mutant. PIN1 showed similar basal membrane localization in cells of the vasculature in both vertically grown and gravistimulated wild-type and crk5-1 roots, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 7A online). PIN4-GFP also displayed identical localization in the first columella tiers, quiescent center, and upper adjacent layers of dividing cells of wild-type and crk5-1 roots independently of gravistimulation (see Supplemental Figure 7B online). Although the level of PIN7-GFP protein was somewhat lower compared with wild-type in crk5-1 roots, its basal localization in stele cells and apolar pattern in the columella did not differ in vertically grown and gravistimulated wild-type and crk5-1 roots (see Supplemental Figure 7C online). Using color-coded heat maps for PIN3-GFP localization in columella cells according to CITATION, we found that PIN3-GFP showed apolar PM localization in 90% of vertically positioned roots of both wild-type and crk5-1 plants. After 30 min of gravistimulation by 90° reorientation, translocation of PIN3-GFP to basal PM was observed only in 10% of both wild-type and crk5-1 roots, in which PIN3-GFP showed previous partial polarization also in the absence of gravistimulus (see Supplemental Figure 8A online) as reported by CITATION. A subsequent time course indicated that PIN3-GFP was nonpolarized and partially polarized in 90% versus 10% of vertically grown roots equally in both the wild type and crk5-1 mutant, and this ratio did not change during subsequent gravistimulation for 30, 60, or 120 min (see Supplemental Figure 8B online). Analogously, AUX1-YFP localization in the basal and inner lateral membranes of root cap and basal PM of epidermal cells proved to be identical in wild-type and crk5-1 roots (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). Whereas the crk5-1 mutation appeared to have no effect on polar localization of AUX1, PIN1, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7, we found that the amount of PIN2-GFP reporter measured by heat maps was about twofold lower in the transition zone between the root cap and elongation zones (CITATION) of vertically grown crk5-1 roots compared with the wild type (Figures 6A to 6E, 6H to 6L, and 6O). Moreover, in the transition zone, the amount of PIN2-GFP was markedly reduced in the upper PM of epidermal cells, whereas PIN2-GFP showed a basal-to-apical shift of PM localization in the adjacent cortex cells of crk5-1 compared with the wild type (Figures 6A to 6C and 6H to 6J). In contrast with previous reports (CITATION, CITATION), however, we failed to detect enhanced vacuolar accumulation, suggesting facilitated endocytosis and degradation of PIN2-GFP in the light- or dark-grown crk5-1 mutant. Following 5 h of gravistimulation by 90° rotation, PIN2-GFP showed a typical asymmetric distribution in wild-type roots due to its reduction in the upper and accumulation in the lower section of epidermal and cortex cell files (Figures 6F, 6G, and 6P). At the same time, equal signal intensities were detected in the upper and lower sections of horizontally placed crk5-1 roots, indicating that symmetric distribution of PIN2-GFP remained unaltered upon 5 h of gravistimulation (Figures 6M, 6N, and 6P). [[FIGURE]] To confirm altered localization of PIN2 in the crk5-1 mutant by an independent means, we performed dual immunolocalization of PIN1 (Figures 7A to 7D, red) and PIN2 (Figures 7A to 7D, green). Whereas PIN1 similarly decorated the basal membranes of vascular cells in both wild-type and crk5-1 roots, immunolocalization detected similar changes in PIN2 localization as those seen with the PIN2-GFP reporter in crk5-1 roots (Figures 6A to 6C, 6H to 6J, and 7A to 7D). To exclude potential artifacts, we performed an alternative dual-labeling approach, in which PIN2 was colocalized with the PM H+-ATPase (Figures 7E to 7P). Both series of immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that in cells below the transition zone, PIN2 was properly localized in the apical and basal membranes of epidermal and cortex files, respectively, as expected. However, in epidermal cells of the crk5-1 root transition zone, the apical PIN2 membrane localization was markedly diminished along with a change in PIN2 localization to apolar or apical in the adjacent cortex cells and accompanied by appearance of some PIN2 signal also in membranes of endodermal cells (Figures 7C, 7D, 7F, and 7L). Upwards of the crk5-1 transition zone, PIN2 was detected, if at all, as weak internalized signal in the epidermis, and its localization was shifted to apical in the cortex. Since such apical localization of PIN2 in the cortex induced by low concentration BFA treatment was previously demonstrated to abolish root gravitropic responses (CITATION), these data suggested that aberrant polar localization of PIN2 in both epidermis and cortex was likely responsible for the delayed gravitropic response of crk5-1 mutant roots. [[FIGURE]] The altered polar localization of PIN2 in cells of the transition zone and the generally reduced amount of PIN2 in epidermal and cortex cell membranes of crk5-1 roots compared with the wild type suggested a potential defect in membrane recycling leading to destabilization of PIN2 (CITATION; CITATION). Similarly to the effects of phosphatidylinositol monophosphate 5-kinase 2 (CITATION), we found that BFA treatment stimulated faster internalization of PIN2-GFP from epidermal cell membranes of crk5-1 roots compared with the wild type (Figures 8A to 8H). Upon 30 min of treatment with 50 µM BFA, the number of BFA bodies was approximately threefold higher in crk5-1 compared with the wild type, and this difference was not balanced by prolonging the BFA treatment up to 2 h (Figure 8I). To exclude possible impact of de novo protein synthesis on enhanced accumulation of PIN2-GFP in BFA bodies, in control experiments, wild-type and crk5-1 seedlings were treated with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; 50 µM) for 30 min and then incubated with BFA (50 µM) and CHX for 30 min before removal of BFA and further treatment with CHX for 1 h (Figures 8J to 8P). As without CHX, PIN2-GFP showed approximately threefold higher accumulation in brefeldin bodies in BFA+CHX but not in CHX-treated crk5-1 root cells compared with the wild type, indicating that the crk5-1 mutation decelerated BFA-sensitive exocytosis of PIN2 without affecting its de novo synthesis. [[FIGURE]] In support of the observations of CITATION, we found that endocytosis of the membrane-specific dye FM4-64 was significantly slower in epidermal cells of crk5-1 roots compared with the wild type. However, FM4-64 showed slower internalization in the wild type compared with crk5-1 in the presence of BFA, as was indicated by the size of accumulating BFA bodies, which increased with time during BFA treatment (Figures 8Q to 8T). As polar membrane recycling was demonstrated to be dependent on phosphorylation of central hydrophilic loops of PIN proteins, we tested whether PIN2 was a candidate substrate of CRK5. The hydrophilic T-loop domain of PIN2 expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via N-terminal His6-tag was phosphorylated by CRK5 in vitro analogously to the control myelin basic protein (Figure 8U).
!~MM~! Seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) and mutant lines were germinated after 1 d of stratification at 4°C on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.5% Suc in a growth chamber (22°C with 120 mol/m2s light intensity, constant light) or in soil under controlled greenhouse conditions (16 h light/8 h dark period; 22 to 24°C day temperature and 18°C night temperature, 80 to 120 mol/m2s light intensity) as described (CITATION). Polyethylene glycol–mediated transformation of cell suspension–derived protoplasts and transient expression studies were performed 18 h after protoplast transformation as described (CITATION). Root and shoot gravitropism assays were performed in growth chambers using continuous light. Five-day-old vertically grown seedlings were reoriented by 135°, and the degree of root bending was recorded by scanning 12 and 24 h after rotation. The rate of root bending was determined by measuring the angle formed between the growth direction of root tip and horizontal baseline. At least 300 wild-type and crk5-1 seedlings were tested in four separate experiments. Gravitropic response of inflorescence stems was similarly assayed using 4-week-old greenhouse grown plants carrying inflorescence stems of 10 cm after turning them to a horizontal position for 3 h in darkness. Identification of the crk5-1 (MPIZ38225) and crk5-2 (Salk_003774) T-DNA insertion mutants, construction of CRK5 and PIN2 loop E. coli expression vectors, assembly of gCRK5:GFP and gCRK5:GUS gene constructs in Agrobacterium tumefaciens binary vectors, and generation of transgenic Arabidopsis plants are described in the Supplemental Methods and References 1 and Supplemental Table 1 online. Total RNA was isolated from leaf or root tissues of 3-week-old seedlings using the TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Transcript levels were monitored by qRT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online). cDNA templates were generated from DNase-treated (Fermentas) total RNA (1 μg) by RevertAid M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). qRT-PCR reactions were performed with SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich) using an ABIPRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) and the following protocol: denaturation 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, and 60°C for 60 s. His6-CRK5 and His6-Pin2loop proteins were purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose affinity chromatography (Novagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following gradient elution with 50 to 500 mM imidazole and size separation by 10% SDS-PAGE, fractions containing apparently homogeneous His6-CRK5 or His6-PIN2loop were identified, pooled, dialyzed with storage buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerin, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4°C, and stored at −80°C. In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed with 1 μg His6-CRK5 in 20 μL kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 5 µCi [γ-32P]ATP) containing either 2 μg myelin basic protein (Sigma-Aldrich) or 2 μg His6-PIN2 loop as substrate at 24°C for 30 min. CaCl2 was added, at a final concentration of 0.1 mM with or without 1 mM Ca2+-chelator EGTA where indicated. The kinase assays were size separated by 12% SDS-PAGE; the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye, dried, and subjected to autoradiography using x-ray film. From seedlings expressing the gCRK5:GFP construct, root cultures were established as described (CITATION). Root samples (15 g) were homogenized in liquid nitrogen, solubilized in homogenization buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM Suc, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail Sigma-Aldrich P9599), and filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem) to prepare total cell extract by centrifugation at 2000g for 15 min at 4°C as described (CITATION). Microsomal membranes were collected by centrifugation 100,000g for 1 h; the supernatant represented the cytoplasmic fraction. Cell wall fraction was purified as described (CITATION) by extraction of 15 g of root sample with extraction buffer (5 mM acetate, pH 4.6, 0.4 M Suc, and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail Sigma-Aldrich P9599) followed by centrifugation at 1000g at 4°C for 15 min. The pellet was washed successively with extraction buffer containing 0.4, 0.6, and 1 M Suc and then with 5 mM acetate buffer before lyophilization of purified sample. Following standardization of protein concentrations using Bio-Rad protein assay, 25 μg of each sample was size separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon Membrane (Millipore), and incubated for 2 h in 1× TBST blocking buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% dry skimmed milk) and for 2 h with anti-GFP antibody (Roche; 1:1000 dilution) in blocking buffer. After washing with 1× TBST three times, the membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with an anti-mouse-POD secondary antibody (Pierce; dilution 1:5000), washed with 1× TBST, and overlaid with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore) to detect CRK5-GFP by autoradiography. Selected T3 lines carrying the gCRK5-GUS construct in wild-type and crk5-1 mutant backgrounds were germinated and subjected to GUS staining according to CITATION. Starch staining of roots was performed with Lugol solution (Fluka) for 10 min, and then the samples were destained in water. Immunolocalization of PIN1 and PIN2 was performed with wild-type and crk5-1 mutant seedlings grown vertically on 0.5× MS medium supplemented with 0.5% Suc for 7 d in constant light as described (CITATION). Immunolocalization of PIN1 was performed using an affinity-purified rabbit anti-PIN1 antibody as described by CITATION. Dilutions of primary anti-PIN2 guinea pig antibody (CITATION) was 1:600 and for the anti-PM H+-ATPase rabbit antibody (CITATION; Agrisera AS07 260) 1:1000. As secondary antibodies, ALEXA Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig (Invitrogen) and ALEXA Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) diluted to 1:600 were used. To compare spatial and temporal expression patterns of CRK5-GFP reporter construct, at least 20 offspring derived originally from five independent wild-type and crk5-1 lines were examined. For monitoring DR5-GFP localization in gravitropism assays, stratified sterile seeds carrying the reporter construct were placed onto microscope slides covered with a thin layer of 0.5× MS medium containing 0.8% phytoagar (Duchefa) and germinated in vertical position for 5 d in continuous light. Upon gravistimulation by rotating the slides with 135°, the DR5-GFP expression pattern in 50 seedlings from each independent line was monitored at different time points using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning microscope with the following configuration: objective lenses, UPLSAPO ×20 (dry, numerical aperture [NA] of 0.75), UPLFLN ×40 (oil, NA of 1.3), and UPLSAPO ×60 (oil, NA of 1.35); sampling speed, 4 µs/pixel; line averaging, 2×; scanning mode, sequential unidirectional; excitation, 405 nm (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and 488 nm (GFP); laser transmissivity, <10%; main dichroic beam splitter, DM405/488; intermediate dichroic beam splitter, SDM 490; and GFP fluorescence detection between 505 and 530 nm. Roots of seedlings grown in continuous light vertically for 4 d were stained with 5 μM FM4-64 (Invitrogen T3166) for 30 min, and then images were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 543 nm. For monitoring PIN2-GFP in cells of the root transient zone, wild-type and crk5-1 seedlings were grown either in the light or dark vertically for 5 d and subjected to gravistimulation by 90° rotation. Fluorescence intensities were measured by construction of color-coded heat maps as described (CITATION; CITATION), and the data derived from examination of at least 20 seedlings from each of two biological repeats were evaluated using the Student’s t test (P < 0.001). The vesicle trafficking inhibitor BFA (Sigma-Aldrich B-7651) was applied at 50 µM concentration at various time points (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h) without or parallel with the FM4-64 staining. Combined BFA+CHX treatments were performed as described (CITATION). Five-day-old seedlings were treated in 0.5× MS medium with 50 µM CHX for 30 min, and then with CHX plus 50 µM BFA for 30 min, and finally with CHX alone for 1 h. Seedlings sampled from each phase of treatment were subjected to confocal imaging to visualize and count BFA bodies. Roots of AUX1-YFP–expressing plants were counterstained with propidium iodine (5 µg/mL in water) for 5 to 20 min. Differential interference contrast images were captured with a 488-nm laser line for FM4-64: excitation, 543 nm; emission, long-pass 560 nm. PIN immunolocalization images were recorded with a 510 Confocal Microscope from Zeiss equipped with ×20, ×40, and ×63 lenses. Fluorophores were excited with 488 and 561 nm. Emitted light was collected with 505- to 550-nm and 575- to 615-nm band-pass filters. Composite images were prepared using the Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator software. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the CRK family were retrieved from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/). Searches for putative protein targeting signals were performed using the TargetP, Myristoylation Predictor, and cNLS Mapper databases (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP, http://plantsp.genomics.purdue.edu/myrist.html, and http://nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp). BLAST searches based on multiple sequence alignments were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information COBALT tool with standard settings, and the alignments were colored using GeneDoc software (http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/). Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS Statistic software version 14.0.
