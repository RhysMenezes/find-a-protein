!~ABS~! Livers of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-null mice have high levels of retinoic acid (RA), retinol, and retinyl palmitate. Hepatic accumulation of RA in these mice may be responsible in part for the hepatic phenotype characterized by small liver size and fibrosis. The increased levels of hepatic RA may be due to decreased metabolism of RA to 4-hydroxyretinoic acid. To identify the P450 isoform(s) involved in RA metabolism, liver microsomes from AHR-null and wild-type mice were subjected to Western blotting and probed with antibodies to rat P450s that cross-react with murine forms. Signal intensity in Western blots probed with anti-rat CYP2C6 antibodies correlated with levels of RA 4-hydroxylation. Furthermore, this anti-rat CYP2C6 antibody inhibited RA 4-hydroxylase activity of wild-type mouse liver microsomes to the levels of AHR-null mouse liver. When used to screen a mouse liver cDNA expression library, this antibody exclusively recognized the murine P450 CYP2C39. Catalytic assays of five recombinant mouse CYP2Cs expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that only CYP2C39 was competent for RA 4-hydroxylation (Km = 812.3 nm and Vmax 47.85 (fmol/min/pmol P450)). Real time reverse transcriptase-PCR used to assess the Cyp2C39 mRNA expression showed decreased levels (30%) of this transcript in AHR-null compared with wild-type liver, consistent with decreased protein levels observed by Western blot analysis using an antibody to a CYP2C39-specific peptide. These data show that CYP2C39 catalyzes RA catabolism and thus possibly controls RA levels in mouse liver. Down-regulation of Cyp2C39 is hypothesized to be responsible for the liver phenotype in the AHR-null mouse. 
!~RES~! Correlation between CYP2C Immunoreactive Protein Levels and RA Metabolism in Microsomes Prepared from AHR-null and Wild-type Mouse Liver—Initially, an approach that directly compared protein levels was taken to study modulation of P450 levels in wild-type and AHR-null mice. Due to a high degree of amino acid similarity, antibodies raised to P450s from one species often cross-react with those from other rodent species. Thus, probing Western immunoblots of AHR-null and wild-type mouse liver microsomes with a panel of antibodies raised against rat P450s could be used to identify an antibody that would cross-react with the RA-hydroxylating P450 and to highlight differences in this P450 between AHR-null and wild-type mice. The results of this screen are presented in Fig. 1. The intensity of signal on the blots was found to vary in the same rank order as RA 4-hydroxylase activity, using an anti-rat 2C6 antibody as probe (Fig. 1). Thus, proteins that were cross-reactive to the antibody to rat CYP2C6 were decreased in AHR-null livers relative to wild type (37% decrease was estimated by densitometric analysis by ImageQuant 5.1 software). Furthermore, they were not increased by in vivo pretreatment with TCDD. This validates the fact that, although RA metabolism was decreased in AHR-null mouse liver, this activity was not TCDD-responsive.3 The efficacy of TCDD treatment was confirmed using an anti-CYP1A1 antibody (Fig. 1). Thus, anti-rat CYP2C6 antibodies recognize a P450 form that follows the same trend as RA 4-hydroxylation in the AHR-null mice. In contrast, the signal obtained with anti-rat CYP2C11 antibodies did not vary considerably between genotypes, indicating that only a subset of P450s is affected in the AHR-null mouse. Significantly, the intensity of signal obtained using an antibody raised to a C-terminal peptide of CYP26, the retinoic acid-inducible retinoid acid 4-hydroxylase (also known as CYP26A1 or CYPRAI), was not significantly decreased (13%) in the AHR-null mouse. Thus, decreased levels of CYP26A1 (to our knowledge the only confirmed liver RA 4-hydroxylase P450 in the mouse) cannot explain the observed deficiency in RA metabolism in the AHR-null mouse liver.   [[FIGURE]]  RA Metabolism in Mouse Liver Microsomes by Anti-CYP2C6 Antibody—In order to determine whether the anti-CYP2C6 antibody does indeed recognize an RA-metabolizing P450, immunoinhibition was performed with anti-CYP2C6 antibody. Indeed, this treatment inhibited RA oxidation in microsomes prepared from wild-type mice to a level of activity that resembled that of AHR-null microsomes, whereas control IgG had no effect on this activity (Fig. 2). In contrast, RA 4-hydroxylation in microsomes prepared from AHR-null livers was unaffected by the addition of either anti-CYP2C6 or control IgG. Taken together, these data strongly suggest the following: 1) the anti-CYP2C6 antibody specifically recognizes an RA-metabolizing P450; 2) the anti-CYP2C6 reactive P450 is present at decreased levels in the AHR-null mouse liver.   [[FIGURE]] Anti-2C6 Antibody Preferentially Recognizes Mouse CYP2C39 in an Expression Library Screen—In initial attempts to identify the mouse P450 that is recognized by the anti-rat CYP2C6 antibody, this antibody was used to screen a mouse liver cDNA expression library. Of nine recombinant phages identified from a tertiary screen, seven contained a sequence exactly corresponding to CYP2C39 (13) (representing three unique clones). The remaining two clones had no sequence similarity to the P450 superfamily. Significantly, no other P450s, including those from the highly homologous CYP2C subfamily members, were recognized during the library screen.  CYP2C39 Catalyzes the 4-Hydroxylation of RA—Given the evidence presented above, it seemed likely that CYP2C39 was the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of RA and that it is present at decreased levels in the AHR-null mouse liver. To determine whether this enzyme is indeed capable of metabolizing RA, expressed, partially purified recombinant CYP2C39 was incubated in a reconstituted system with [3H]RA. A concentration of 90 nm RA was chosen for all incubations as this is in the same range as the reported physiological RA concentration in the liver (6). The specificity of the reaction was tested by assaying metabolite formation of the other highly homologous murine CYP2C isoforms (CYP2C29, -37, -38, -39 and -40). Of all the P450s tested, only CYP2C39 produced the major metabolites of RA (4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-RA) at levels above that seen with the inactive P450 control (Table I), even though all P450 preparations were active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (13). As a further test to ensure that lack of RA-hydroxylating activity by the murine CYP2Cs was not due to inactive P450, tolbutamide metabolism was assessed side-by-side with the RA incubations. Both CYP2C29 and 2C38 metabolized tolbutamide with turnover numbers of 6 and 1.1 nmol/nmol/min, respectively (not shown). Kinetic studies for RA oxidation were performed using the partially purified, recombinant mCYP2C39 isoform. This isoform exhibited high activity for the 4-hydroxylation of RA, with a Vmax value of 47.85 fmol/min/pmol of mCYP2C39 and a Km of 812.29 nm. Background metabolite formation was assessed with an inactive recombinant human CYP2C19*5 allele (which contains a mutation in the heme-binding motif) (14). This allele has been found to be essentially inactive (<0.4% of wild-type CYP2C19) toward CYP2C19 substrates such as S-mephenytoin and tolbutamide (14). Background 4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-RA formation was fairly high (∼5% total radioactivity) in the absence of an active P450 (Table I). As no metabolites were observed in the absence of protein (not shown), this is most likely due to metabolism by contaminating bacterial proteins.   [[TABLE]] Cyp2C39 mRNA Is Dependent on AHR Status but Unresponsive to TCDD—Because of the unique activity of the bacterially expressed CYP2C39 in RA 4-hydroxylation, we tested whether AHR-null mice showed a decrease in Cyp2C39 mRNA compared with wild type. Fig. 3 shows a 70% decrease in Cyp2C39 mRNA as tested in real time RT-PCR experiments and specified in Fig. 3 legend. The difference was highly significant (95% confidence intervals). Interestingly, in vivo pretreatment with TCDD did not affect Cyp2C39 mRNA expression, thus suggesting that AHR status controls the expression of this RA 4-hydroxylating enzyme in an indirect manner. These data correlate well with the reported lack of induction by TCDD treatment of both anti-rat CYP2C6 immunoreactive protein(s) expression and in vitro RA metabolism in AHR wild-type mice.   [[FIGURE]] Western Blot Analysis Using a CYP2C39-specific Antibody Verifies a Decrease CYP2C39 in the AHR-null Mouse Liver— Because CYP2C39 was the only cytochrome showing significant RA oxidizing activity of all the bacterially expressed isoforms tested (Fig. 2), and real time RT-PCR showed a reduction in the mRNA of Cyp2C39, we checked whether the observed lower RA 4-hydroxylation activity in the AHR-null mouse liver microsomes was also accompanied by a reduced CYP2C39 protein expression level by using a new specific polyclonal antibody for CYP2C39 raised to a specific CYP2C39 peptide. Fig. 4A shows the high specificity of an antibody for CYP2C39. This antibody recognized only the recombinant bacterially expressed CYP2C39, but it did not recognize any other structurally related murine CYP2C isoforms such as CYP2C29, CYP2C37, CYP2C38, and CYP2C40. Furthermore, Fig. 4B clearly shows a marked reduction in the CYP2C39 protein expression in the AHR-null liver. These data verify that CYP2C39 is the P450 that is specifically down-regulated in these livers.   [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Materials—All-trans-RA, hexane, isopropyl alcohol, acetic acid, and ammonium acetate were purchased from Sigma. [11,12-3H]RA (specific activity, 51.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 4-Hydroxy- and 4-oxo-RA were a kind gift of Dr. Joseph L. Napoli (University of California at Berkeley). Acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). All of the solvents used for HPLC were degassed through a 0.2-μm filter, and all of the procedures were carried out under yellow light.  Animals, TCDD Treatment and Microsome Preparation—All animals used in this study were 20-week-old males and were maintained in a pathogen-free facility. TCDD was administered in a single intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 80 μg/kg in corn oil. Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation 3 days after injection. Microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation as described previously, and protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding method (BCA kit, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.  Western Immunoblots—Microsomal proteins (10 or 20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in TGM transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% v/v methanol) at a constant 30 V overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were probed with antibodies raised against rat CYP2C6 (a generous gift from Dr. David Waxman), CYP2C11, and CYP2B1 (BD Gentest Corp., Woburn, MA), mouse CYP1A1 (a generous gift from Dr. Harry Gelboin) and mCYP26, and an antibody for mCYP2C39 raised against a CYP2C39-specific peptide, generated as described below. Binding of antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Relative band intensities (peak area) were measured by densitometry.  Generation of Anti-CYPs Antibody—Polyclonal anti-CYP26A1 antibody was raised by injection of a synthetic keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated C-terminal peptide from mouse CYP26 (Ac-CVDNLPARFTYFQGDI-OH) into rabbits using a standard protocol (Quality Control Biochemicals, a division of BioSource International Inc., Camarillo, CA). A CYP2C39-specific peptide C-EEFSDRGSIPMV was synthesized by ResGen (a division of Invitrogen) and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the terminal cysteine. Custom polyclonal antibodies specific for CYP2C39 were then produced by Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA) as follows. At the start of production, a 1 mg/ml suspension of conjugated peptide was diluted 1:1 with Freund's complete adjuvant, and each of two rabbits received 500 μg (1 ml) following pre-bleed. After 4 weeks, rabbits were each boosted with 250 μg of peptide diluted 1:1 with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, followed after 2 weeks with a test bleed. Rabbits received 4 additional boosts at 4-week intervals, with production bleeds beginning after the third boost. Rabbits were terminated by exsanguination at completion of production. Antibodies used in this study were from the second production bleed.  Enzymatic Assays and Determination of Kinetic Constants for RA 4-Hydroxylation by mCYP2C39 Isoform—RA metabolism in mouse liver microsomes was assayed as described previously (6). The N termini of the murine Cyp2C cDNAs were modified for optimal expression in Escherichia coli and expressed, partially purified and reconstituted with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine and NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, as described previously (13, 14). Incubations containing a final concentration of 90 nm 3H-labeled RA were initiated by the addition of NADPH and run for 1 h at 37 °C. For the determination of Km and Vmax values for RA 4-hydroxylation by mCYP2C39 isoform, recombinant and partially reconstituted mCYP2C39 isoform was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with a range of [3H]RA concentrations (22.5 to 720 nm); incubation time was within the linear range as determined from velocity versus time experiments. NADPH-minus controls were run side by side. Reactions were stopped by placing tubes in a dry ice/ethanol bath and processed as described below.  HPLC—Conversion of [11,12-3H]RA to more polar metabolites was analyzed on both reverse and straight phase columns. A Beckman model 110A pump was connected in series to a Knauer D-14163 spectrophotometer (Sonntek, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ) and a Radiomatic radioactivity flow detector (150TR flow scintillation analyzer; Packard Instrument Co.). Samples were first analyzed on a Partisil 10 ODS-2 column (4.6 mm inside diameter × 25 cm; Whatman) fitted with a precolumn of Pellicular ODS (Whatman). Acetonitrile and 1% ammonium acetate in water (65:35 concentration) was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 2.2 ml/min. Polar metabolites were further separated on a Zorbax-SIL (3 μm, 6.2 × 80 mm) column with 93.5:5:1:0.5 hexane/isopropyl alcohol/methanol/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.  Immunoinhibition—Liver microsomes (100 μg of protein) were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg of anti-rat CYP2C6 IgG/mg of microsomes. Commercial rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a negative control. Each sample was then incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 20 min in 0.3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and an NADPH-regenerating system (2.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 500 nmol of NADP, and 0.5 μmol of glucose 6-phosphate), pH 7.4, with 90 nm [3H]RA, according to Fiorella et al. (15). Reactions were stopped in a dry ice/methanol mixture before sample lyophilization. Each residue was extracted with 200 ml of methanol. After removal of particulates by centrifugation (3 min at maximum speed in a table top centrifuge), samples were stored at –70 °C until analyzed.  RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted from crushed, frozen mouse liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To ensure efficient removal of possible DNA contamination, RNA samples were further purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for RNA clean up. cDNA Synthesis—Purified total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were primed with oligo(dT)12–18 primers, and the total volume/reaction was 20 μl.  PCR Amplification—PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl using TaqMan PCR Core Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems); 1 μl of cDNA/sample was used as template. Both GAPDH and Cyp2C39 amplification were done in duplicate for each sample. The thermal cycling conditions included 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.  Primers and Probes—Primers and probe for Cyp2C39 mRNA were designed using the Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) computer program and then custom-synthesized by Applied Biosystems. Primers and probe nucleotide sequences for mCyp2C39 (GenBank™ accession number AF047726) are as follows: forward primer 5′-1067AGAGATTCATCAACCTTGTCCCTAA1091-3′; reverse primer 5′-1178GATGTCAGTGACGTTACTACTGTTGTTC1151-3′; and TaqMan probe 5′(FAM)-1093AACATACCCCGTGCAGTGACTTGTGACATTAAATTT1128-(TAMRA)-3′. The boldface nucleotides in the TaqMan probe sequence represent the fully unique nucleotides for the Cyp2C39 isoform, which guarantee a specific amplification of this isoform over other very similar ones within the same subfamily. Both the primer pair set and probe for GAPDH were purchased from Applied Biosystems.  Real Time RT-PCR—Cyp2C39 expression in wild-type and AHR-null mouse liver samples was measured by real time quantitative RT-PCR, based on TaqMan methodology, using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). This technique allows, by means of fluorescence emission, identification of the cycling point when PCR product is detectable (threshold cycle or CT value). To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, we amplified the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Results are expressed as relative levels of Cyp2C39 mRNA, referred to wild-type samples (the calibrator), chosen to represent 1× expression of this gene. The AHR-null samples and the TCDD-treated AHR+/+ samples express n-fold Cyp2C39 mRNA relative to the calibrator. The amount of target, normalized to an endogenous reference (GAPDH) and relative to the calibrator is definite by the ΔΔCT method as described by Livak (Sequence Detector User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). Specifically, the formula is as follows: target amount = 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = {(CT(mCyp2C39 sample) – CT(GAPDH sample)) – (CT(mCyp2C39 calibrator) – CT(GADPH calibrator))}. This method is based on the assumption that the target (Cyp2C39) and the reference (GAPDH) display equal amplification efficiencies. To verify this condition, we checked ΔCT (CT mCyp2C39 – CT GAPDH) variations according to template dilution. To this end, a standard curve composed of five different dilutions of wild-type mouse liver total RNA (1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 μg) was generated. The slope of this curve was –0.0832. (To ensure the appropriate amplification efficiency, the slope of the standard curve should be less than 0.1.)  Statistical Analysis—Quantitative RT-PCR data were analyzed using the following statistical Model 1, This model is designed to adjust for possible batch effects and also to take into account the sample replicates, so the standard errors would account for both within mouse and between mouse variability.
