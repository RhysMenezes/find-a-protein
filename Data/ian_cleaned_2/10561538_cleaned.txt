!~ABS~! A cDNA clone, AtELP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana EGF receptor-like protein) was isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA library with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a highly conserved region of animal β-integrins. The cloning of this cDNA was previously reported and it has been proposed that AtELP might be a receptor involved in intracellular trafficking. In the present work, using two specific independent sets of anti-peptide antibodies, we show that AtELP1 is mainly located in the plasma membrane, supporting another function for this protein. Structural studies, using methods for secondary structure prediction, indicated the presence of cysteine-rich domains specific to β-integrins. Database searches revealed that AtELP1 is a member of a multigenic family composed of at least six members in A. thaliana. Northern blot analysis of AtELP1, 2b and 3 was performed on mRNA extracted from cells cultured in normal and stressed conditions, and from several organs and plants submitted to biotic or abiotic stresses. All the genes are expressed at different levels in the same conditions, but preferentially in roots, fruits and leaves in response to water deficit.
!~RES~! An A. thaliana cDNA library was screened with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a conserved cytoplasmic region of integrin β-subunits. Seven clones were isolated and partially sequenced. One clone (2712), presenting a potential transmembrane domain, was completely sequenced. The cDNA insert was found to be 2314 bp in length. It encodes a complete 623 amino acid protein, which has a predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa and a potential membrane-spanning domain. Database search revealed that this clone was independently identified by three other groups at the same time CITATION. Clone 2712 will be called AtELP1 (A. thaliana EGF-like protein) in this paper. Southern blot experiments using AtELP1 cDNA as a probe (data not shown) revealed that AtELP1 belongs to a multigenic family. Homology searches in A. thaliana EST database showed two nucleic acid sequences having 81 and 63% homology with AtELP1. These sequences were called, respectively, AtELP2 (accession number U79960) and AtELP3 (EST accession number 110G6T7). The complete genomic sequence of AtELP3 (accession number AL021637, pid g 2827665) and two other clones presenting homologies with AtELP1 were deduced from the analysis of the A. thaliana genomic database. These clones were named AtELP4 (accession number ATAC002338, pid g 2347209) and AtELP5 (accession number ATAC004238, pid g 3033390) and their nucleic acid sequences showed 84 and 61% homology with AtELP1. Primary and secondary sequence analyses were performed on AtELP1. The polypeptide chain is rather hydrophilic (64% polar residues) and contains a high proportion of cysteine (34 residues). Its calculated isoelectric point is 5.87. The polypeptide shares moderate percentages of identity (14.8 and 17.8%) and homology (34.6 and 38.8%) with human β1 and β5 integrins. The deduced protein sequences of the five clones are shown in CITATION . AtELP proteins ranged from 618 to 630 amino acids. They present the same common structural features: a potential signal peptide at the N-terminus, a large N-terminal region, a potential transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal region. Alignment of AtELP1, 2, and 4 showed about 80% homology. The N-terminus contains many conserved regions. The number and position of cysteines is well conserved (34 Cys out of 560 amino acids). Three Cys-rich motifs were found in all the putative proteins. Two of them (EGF1 and EGF2, in CITATION) have the typical arrangement Cx(3–7) Cx(2–6) Cx(7–10) CxCx(7–12) C common to epidermal growth factors (EGF) with 6 cysteines in conserved positions. The third Cys-rich motif has a different organization with eight cysteines in the following sequence: Cx(6–8) Cx5 CxCxxCxCx(8–13) Cx(1–2) C. This cysteine alignment is characteristic of β-integrin subunits (ICR, integrin Cys-rich motif in CITATION). The C-terminal domain of AtELPs (34–40 amino acids) contains a highly conserved sequence of 27 amino acids, but then diverges. It contains a YMPL site (amino acid 606–609). The Yxxφ motif (x represents any amino acid and φ a hydrophobic residue) has been demonstrated to mediate internalization from the cell surface as well as targeting to intracellular compartments in mammals CITATION. The more divergent sequences correspond to the potential signal peptide, the putative transmembrane domain, and the C-terminus end. The structure of five AtELP genes is presented in CITATION . These genomic sequences were obtained by the systematic sequencing programs CITATION. Two sequences, AtELP2a (accession number ATAC 004705, pid 3252813) and AtELP2b (accession number ATAC 004705, pid 3252815, which corresponds to the cDNA previously described as AtELP2), encode proteins showing 96.5% identity (22 different amino acids out of 628). The length of the ORF is the same for both genes, but they have different intron lengths. AtELP2a and AtELP2b are located on chromosome 2 in reversed position, and are separated by a single gene. AtELP2a and 2b could be the result of gene duplication. AtELP4 (accession number ATAC 002338, pid 2347209) and AtELP5 (accession number ATAC 004238, pid 3033390) are also located on chromosome 2. The genomic sequence corresponding to AtELP3 (accession number ALO21637, pid 2827665) is the only one located on chromosome 4. At present, the AtELP1 genomic clone has not been found. The multigenic family AtELP is composed of at least six genes having 11–13 exons and 10–12 introns. Among these six genes, only three have so far been found expressed (AtELP1, AtELP2b, and AtELP3). Sequence analysis of each promoter was carried out using the Transfac program CITATION. No clearly identifiable regions corresponding to putative cis-acting elements were found in AtELP promoter genes. Analysis of AtELP1 gene expression was done using the 3′ non-coding region, cloned after PCR amplification. Total RNA was extracted from dark cultured cells under control or osmotic stress (CITATION ). A single signal corresponding to a 2.3-kb transcript was observed. This signal was increased during the culture period under osmotic stress, compared to control cells. In CITATION, AtELP1 gene expression analysis was performed on total RNA extracted from different organs or after various stress: mechanical, wounding, water deficit, and after Ralstonia solanacearum infection (data not shown). A weak signal was observed in young plantlets (rosette stage) compared to other organs (leaf, root, and stem). Stress was applied on plantlets at 5 weeks rosette stage, and the higher signal was observed in plants left without water for 24 h. AtELP2b and AtELP3 gene expression was analyzed using specific probes, 3′-non-coding region were specifically PCR amplified before use. Expression of AtELP2b is weakly enhanced compared to AtELP1 (CITATION) and the basal expression level of AtELP3 is weaker than the other genes under the conditions used. Two sets of antibodies (630 and 640) raised against peptides derived from the AtELP1 primary sequences were used for the localization of the protein. Purified membranes were obtained and characterized as described CITATION. The proteins were separated on SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and revealed using antibody 630. A single band around 80 kDa was observed in plasma membrane and endomembrane enriched fractions (CITATION ). The higher signal was observed in fraction 2 (plasma membrane). This signal strongly decreased when antibody 630 was pre-incubated with its corresponding peptide (lane 6). The same results were obtained when antibody 640 was used (CITATION).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia, was cultured in a grown chamber under fluorescent tubes 36 W (12 W/m2) with 16-h light–8-h dark photoperiod. Plants were grown in pots filled with TKS2 peat Floratorf supplemented with 1‰ (w/w) nitrate. Arabidopsis cells were grown on Gamborg liquid medium CITATION. Fifteen ml cell suspensions were routinely transferred to 300 ml fresh medium in 1000-ml Erlenmeyer flasks every 2 weeks, and shaken (150 rpm) in continuous light (60 W/m2) at 26°C. Cells were transferred to fresh culture medium containing mannitol or not (250 mM), and maintained in the dark for different periods (1–15 days) prior to harvesting. The A. thaliana cDNA library was constructed in pAD-GAL4 vector (Stratagene) and was kindly provided by B. Lescure (INRA-CNRS, Auzeville). A 17-mer degenerate oligonucleotide (AARTTYGARAARGARAA) corresponding to the peptide sequence KFEKEK was synthesized. This peptide matched a cytoplasmic conserved region from human integrin (β-subunit) CITATION. The oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by terminal transferase and used to screen the cDNA library according to Stratagene protocol. Positive clones were selected, excised from recombinant phage, and introduced into Escherichia coli strain SOLR. The isolated cDNAs were sequenced according to Sanger et al. CITATION. The DNA and its deduced protein sequences were examined for homology in the non-redundant nucleotide and protein sequence databases using BLAST CITATION, PRODOM CITATION, and BLOCKS searches CITATION. The amino acid sequence alignments were carried out on a Macintosh LC630 computer. The hydrophobicity, surface probability and flexibility profiles were calculated as described CITATION with a window size of seven residues, using MacVector (Kodak). Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) CITATION was performed to delineate and compare the hydrophobic clusters along the amino acid sequences. They were generated on a Macintosh LC using the program HCA-Plot2 (Doriane, Paris, France). Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis cell suspensions at various times during the culture and from different organs using the guanidinium thiocyanate method CITATION. Total RNA (15 μg) was separated on formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted to Nytran (Schleicher and Schuell) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The 3′-non-coding region of AtELP1, 2, and 3 were amplified by PCR using degenerate primers, deduced from the highly conserved region of the three clones (5′-ATCATGKCACAGTAYATGCCA-3′) and a TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTW. Each PCR fragment was subcloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega), sequenced and used as specific probe. Specific antibodies raised against selected peptides derived from AtELP1 were prepared. Immunogenic peptides were defined by HCA and prediction of antigen determinants CITATION. Two exposed hydrophilic regions, located between amino acids 352 and 365 (AEQESQIGKSRGDC, peptide 63), and amino acids 375–384 (NNRQYRGKLEC, peptide 64), were defined. BLAST analysis was carried-out to verify the presence of identical sequences in the Arabidopsis database. No other known protein, but the AtELP family, showed sequence 63 or 64 indicating that the chosen peptides could be specific for AtELP proteins. Both peptides were synthesized automatically by stepwise F-moc-t-butyl solid phase synthesis CITATION in a Synergy Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer. Crude synthetic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Purified peptides were characterized by mass spectrometry on a Lasermat spectrometer (Finnigan), and coupled to the carrier protein. Peptides were coupled either to tyroglobulin or to bovine serum albumin using N-succimidyl-6-maleidocaproate as coupling reagent. Before immunization, a sample of preimmune serum was taken and tested against peptides 63 and 64. In the absence of response, the immunization was performed. One volume of complete (immunization) Freund’s adjuvant was added to the tyroglobulin-coupled peptide (250 μg per injection) and injected into rabbits. Two rabbits were immunized against each coupled peptide every 2 weeks during 3 months. Two antisera were obtained: serum 630 for peptide 63, and serum 640 for peptide 64. Antibodies were immunopurified before use. Ten micrograms of BSA-coupled peptide was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was stained with Ponceau red. The stained region was cut, unstained, and blocked with TBS, 0.1% Tween, and 10% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times (15 min each) with TBS 0.1% Tween 1% BSA, and incubate overnight at 4°C with (1/25 dilution) serum. The antibodies were eluted with 500 μl glycine EGTA buffer (glycine 0.2 M, EGTA 1 mM, pH 2.8) and neutralized with 70 μl Tris 1 M pH 8. Microsomes from Arabidopsis cells were prepared according to Bardy et al. CITATION with a grinding medium containing 0.17 M sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Microsomes were separated by free-flow electrophoresis with an Elphor Vap-22 electrophoresis unit (Weber, Kirchheim-Heimstetten, Germany). The electrophoresis medium contained 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris and 10 mM boric acid (pH 8.3). The electrode buffer consisted of 100 mM Tris, 100 mM boric acid (pH 8.3). Microsomes were resuspended in electrophoresis medium and centrifuged for 30 min at 45 000×g. Electrophoresis was performed at a 100 mA constant current (about 900 V), sample injection 2 ml h−1, and buffer flow 3.5 ml fraction−1 h−1 at 4°C. The distribution of membranes in each separation was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Membranes were collected from pooled fractions by centrifugation (30 min at 45 000×g). Activity of different marker enzymes was determined as previously described CITATION. Protein content was determined as reported CITATION with bovine serum albumin as standard. Gel electrophoresis was carried-out on 11% acrylamide gels. Samples (50 μg purified protein) were solubilized in 0.125 M Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS and 20% glycerol prior to electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated overnight with 630 or 640 (1/100 dilution) purified primary antibodies, washed, and revealed with ImmunoPure ABC phosphatase staining kit (Pierce). Antibody competition was realized by incubation of 1 mg non-coupled peptide with its corresponding antibody for 2 h at 37°C. The exhausted antibody was then incubated with the nitrocellulose membranes.
