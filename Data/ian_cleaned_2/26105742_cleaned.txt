!~ABS~! Ethylene plays critical roles in plant growth and development, including the regulation of cell expansion, senescence, and the response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Elements of the initial signal transduction pathway have been determined, but we are still defining regulatory mechanisms by which the sensitivity of plants to ethylene is modulated. We report here that members of the ARGOS gene family of Arabidopsis, previously implicated in the regulation of plant growth and biomass, function as negative feedback regulators of ethylene signaling. Expression of all four members of the ARGOS family is induced by ethylene, but this induction is blocked in ethylene-insensitive mutants. The dose dependence for ethylene induction varies among the ARGOS family members, suggesting that they could modulate responses across a range of ethylene concentrations. GFP-fusions of ARGOS and ARL localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, the same subcellular location as the ethylene receptors and other initial components of the ethylene signaling pathway. Seedlings with increased expression of ARGOS family members exhibit reduced ethylene sensitivity based on physiological and molecular responses. These results support a model in which the ARGOS gene family functions as part of a negative feedback circuit to desensitize the plant to ethylene, thereby expanding the range of ethylene concentrations to which the plant can respond. These results also indicate that the effects of the ARGOS gene family on plant growth and biomass are mediated through effects on ethylene signal transduction.

!~RES~! The primary success to date in identifying elements of the ethylene signal transduction pathway (e.g. ETR1, EIN2, CTR1, and EIN3) has come through the employment of genetic approaches [CITATION, CITATION]. We pursued an alternative approach to identify new ethylene signaling elements, based on the hypothesis that many signaling pathways induce the production of negative regulators for the pathway, a precedent in the ethylene pathway being the negative regulator RTE1 [CITATION]. To this end, we examined microarray data for genes that are (1) induced by ethylene or the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and (2) encode proteins with predicted transmembrane domain(s), because these proteins could potentially be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum where the initial signaling elements in the ethylene pathway are localized [CITATION]. By this process we identified members of the ARGOS family (ARGOS, ARL, and OSR1), which have been previously reported to regulate organ size, with OSR1 also identified as a gene induced in response to ACC [CITATION–CITATION]. The fourth member of the family (OSR2) is not present on the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array. The phylogenetic relationship between members of the ARGOS family is given in Additional file CITATION. All four members of the ARGOS family are induced by exogenous ethylene (Fig. CITATION), but the dose dependence for ethylene-induction varies among the family members, induction of the closely related ARGOS and ARL being most sensitive to ethylene. Induction is blocked in the ethylene-insensitive mutants etr1-1 and ein2-1, and reduced in ein3;eil1 (which exhibits partial ethylene insensitivity) (Fig. CITATION), demonstrating that expression is regulated through the well-characterized ethylene-signaling pathway [CITATION, CITATION]. Time-course analysis indicated that both ARGOS and ARL are rapidly induced by ethylene, induction paralleling that of the ethylene receptor genes ETR2, ERS1, and ERS2 (Fig. CITATION).Fig. 1Ethylene induction of ARGOS family members. a Ethylene dose-dependency for induction varies among family members.

Wild-type or etr1-1 green seedlings were treated for 3 h in the absence or presence of 50 μM ACC or 5 μM NAA. Gene expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR To determine if the ethylene-induced changes in expression are reflected at the protein level we employed GFP-fusions to ARGOS and ARL driven from their native promoters (Fig. CITATION). In response to exogenous ethylene, both the ARGOS-GFP and ARL-GFP proteins are strongly induced, the level of induction being even greater than that observed for the transcripts (Fig. CITATION). Upon removal of ethylene, transcript and protein levels for ARGOS-GFP and ARL-GFP rapidly drop, demonstrating tight control of expression by ethylene (Fig. CITATION). Dose response analysis demonstrated that their protein induction is very responsive to ethylene, induction being detected in response to 0.001 μL L−1 ethylene (Fig. CITATION).Fig. 2Ethylene-dependent regulation of ARGOS and ARL protein levels. GFP-tagged versions of ARGOS and ARL, driven by their native promoters, were stably expressed in Arabidopsis.

Green seedlings were treated with the indicated ethylene concentrations for 4 h. Two immunoblot exposures are shown for the GFP fusions to allow for visualization of induction at low and high ethylene concentrations Public microarray data indicates that only ethylene (as the ethylene precursor ACC) and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) consistently induce expression of ARGOS gene family members, ACC demonstrating a stronger effect than IAA (Additional file CITATION). Members of the ARGOS family were previously reported to be induced by auxin [CITATION, CITATION]. However auxin stimulates ethylene biosynthesis [CITATION, CITATION, CITATION], raising the possibility that the effect of auxin on the induction of ARGOS gene family members might operate indirectly through the ethylene signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 on the ability of auxin to induce expression of ARGOS, ARL, and OSR1 (Fig. CITATION). Auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid; NAA) induced expression of all three genes, but this effect was eliminated by the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1. These results indicate that auxin induction of the ARGOS gene family is dependent on the ethylene signaling pathway. Members of the ARGOS family contain two predicted transmembrane domains (Additional file CITATION). Prior analysis has suggested that members of the ARGOS family might be localized to nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane and/or endoplasmic reticulum [CITATION–CITATION]. We found that the green-fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of ARGOS and ARL are membrane-localized based on fractionation of transgenic plant lines into microsomal and soluble fractions (Fig. CITATION). Furthermore, the fusion proteins are resistant to extraction from the membranes by sodium chloride, but can be solubilized from membranes when treated with the detergent lysophosphatidylcholine (Fig. CITATION). In this respect, they are similar to the transmembrane ethylene-receptor ETR1 [CITATION], consistent with ARGOS and ARL being transmembrane proteins. Although readily detectable by immunoblot analysis, we could not detect ARGOS-GFP and ARL-GFP based on their GFP fluorescence in these stable transgenic lines. Therefore, to determine the subcellular localization of ARGOS and ARL, we transiently expressed the GFP fusions in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Fig. CITATION). The resulting fluorescence co-localized with the ER-marker BiP-RFP. Furthermore, the fluorescence in the region underlying the plasma membrane exhibited the distinctive reticulate network appearance found with the cortical ER (Fig. CITATION). No localization to the plasma membrane itself was detected. Thus, both the co-localization with BiP and morphological features of the membrane network support ER localization for ARGOS and ARL, consistent with results reported by Feng et al. [29].Fig. 3ARGOS and ARL are membrane-associated proteins localized to the ER. a Membrane association of ARGOS-GFP and ARL-GFP. Membrane and soluble fractions were isolated from green seedlings following 4-h treatment in the absence or presence of 10 μL L−1 ethylene. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-GFP antibody to detect the ARGOS-GFP and ARL-GFP. Immunological detection of the ethylene receptor ETR1 and ACC-oxidase served as markers for the membrane and the soluble fractions, respectively. b Strong association of ARGOS and ARL with membranes. Microsomal membranes were treated with 0.5 M NaCl or 0.5% (w/v) lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). The different lanes represent the total membranes prior to centrifugation (T), and from the soluble (S) and (P) fractions after centrifugation. The relative amounts of ARGOS-GFP, ARL-GFP, and ETR1 were determined by immunoblot analysis, the membrane protein ETR1 serving as an internal control for solubilization. c ARGOS and ARL localize to the ER.

Scale bars = 10 μm We found that the ARGOS:ARGOS-GFP and ARL:ARL-GFP lines affected ethylene sensitivity based on the growth response of dark-grown seedlings to ethylene. Wild-type seedlings exhibit a pronounced reduction in hypocotyl growth when grown in 1 μL L−1 ethylene (Fig. CITATION). Dose response analysis indicated that both the ARGOS:ARGOS-GFP and ARL:ARL-GFP exhibit reduced ethylene sensitivity (p < 0.05) compared to wild type at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 μL L−1 ethylene (Fig. CITATION). Since the ARGOS:ARGOS-GFP and ARL:ARL-GFP transgenes are expressed in the wild-type background, ethylene treatment will result in an overall heightened level of ARGOS family expression compared to wild type due to the presence of the native gene and the transgene. These data indicate that ARGOS and ARL can function as negative regulators of the ethylene response. Furthermore, the finding that such a phenotype can be induced from the native promoter is suggestive that changes in expression levels of ARGOS and ARL normally regulate ethylene sensitivity.Fig. 4Functional analysis of the ARGOS and ARL in regulating ethylene sensitivity. a Increased expression levels of ARGOS in CaMV 35S:ARGOS lines and of ARL in CaMV 35S:ARL lines compared to wild type. Two independent transgenic lines (#1, #2) were analyzed for each construct, expression levels being examined in green seedlings following 2-h treatment in the absence or presence of 10 μL L−1 ethylene. β-tubulin served as a loading control.

Statistical significance of wild type to the transgenic lines was performed by an analysis of variance applying Bonferroni correction post-test comparisons (* p < 0.05) We tested the hypothesis that ARGOS and ARL function as negative regulators by generating transgenic lines overexpressing these genes under the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Overexpression lines exhibited increased basal expression of ARGOS or ARL in the absence of ethylene, and resulted in higher than wild-type expression in the presence of ethylene (Fig. CITATION). The ethylene sensitivity of the ARGOS and ARL overexpression lines was significantly reduced compared to wild-type based on the dark-grown hypocotyl growth response to 1 μL L−1 ethylene (Fig. CITATION). For comparison in this analysis, we also included the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 which lacks this hypocotyl growth response to ethylene [CITATION, CITATION], and the constitutive ethylene-response mutant ctr1-2 which displays reduced hypocotyl growth in the both the absence and presence of ethylene (Fig. CITATION). Dose response analysis demonstrating reduced sensitivity (p < 0.05) of the ARGOS and ARL overexpression lines compared to wild type from 0.01 to 100 μL L−1 ethylene (Fig. CITATION). A defining characteristic for ARGOS family mutants is their effect on plant biomass, their overexpression resulting in increased leaf area, these effects being attributed to changes in cell expansion and/or cell proliferation [CITATION–CITATION]. Ethylene insensitivity results in a similar increase in leaf area [CITATION, CITATION, CITATION], suggestive that effects of ARGOS-family overexpression on biomass could be due to altered ethylene signaling. To assess the role of the ethylene signal-transduction pathway in regulating cell expansion and cell proliferation, we characterized fully expanded leaves of the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 [CITATION] and the constitutive ethylene-response mutant ctr1-2 [CITATION]. As shown in Fig. CITATION, ethylene insensitivity results in increased leaf area due to an increase in both cell size and cell number. Conversely, the reduced leaf area found in ctr1-2 arises from a decrease in both cell size and cell number. Overexpression of ARGOS or ARL results in increased leaf area, consistent with prior studies [CITATION, CITATION], this change being due to a significant increase in both cell expansion and cell proliferation (Fig. CITATION). Thus the changes in leaf area arising from altered expression of the ARGOS family are consistent with what is observed in mutants that affect ethylene signaling.Fig. 5Overexpression of ARGOS and ARL recapitulate the effects on leaf cell expansion and division found in ethylene-insensitive mutants. Leaf area (n = 4), cell area (n = 40), and cells per leaf (n = 4) were determined for the fully expanded 5th leaf of 30-day-old plants.

Error bars indicate SD To gain information at the molecular level as to how the ethylene response differs between wild type and the ARGOS-family overexpression lines, we examined ethylene-dependent gene expression (Fig. CITATION). RNA was prepared from seedlings grown in the dark in the absence or presence of 1 μL L−1 ethylene, because we observed substantial differences in the hypocotyl growth response under these conditions (Fig. CITATION). Five reporter genes we previously identified as robustly induced by ethylene [CITATION, CITATION], were all induced in the wild-type seedlings (Fig. CITATION). The molecular response to ethylene was altered in the 35S::ARGOS and 35S::ARL lines (Fig. CITATION). First, the basal expression of the reporter genes was reduced compared to wild type, indicating a reduced response to endogenous ethylene in the 35S::ARGOS and 35S::ARL lines. Second, the expression level of the reporter genes in response to 1 μL L−1 ethylene was also reduced in the transgenic lines compared to wild type. Thus overall, we observed consistently reduced expression for the reporter genes in the 35S::ARGOS and 35S::ARL lines.Fig. 6Overexpression of the ARGOS and ARL suppresses ethylene-dependent gene expression. a Gene expression was analyzed in dark-grown seedlings of the overexpression lines (35S::ARGOS #1 and 35S::ARL #2) grown in the absence and presence of 1 μL L−1 ethylene. Expression of the indicated genes was determined by qRT-PCR, with the expression level of wild-type in the absence of ethylene set to 1. The left column shows genes whose expression is induced by ethylene, the right column genes whose expression is suppressed by ethylene. Data based on three biological replicates for each treatment. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired two-tailed t-test with a Bonferroni correction (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001), between the experimental samples and the corresponding wild-type control. b Overexpression of ARGOS or ARL reduces ethylene-dependent gene expression in a transient protoplast assay. Protoplasts were transfected with either of the ethylene-dependent luciferase reporters GCC-LUC or ERF1-LUC, as well as with a UBQ-GUS transgene for normalization of the transfection. Protoplasts were co-transfected with CsV::ARGOS or CsV::ARL constructs to determine their effect on the expression of the luciferase reporters. Protoplasts were treated in the absence or presence 10 μL L−1 ethylene for 6 h prior to determining the relative LUC/GUS activity. Data from one experiment is shown from two independent experiments with similar results, each experiment including two biological replicates per sample treatment.

Statistical analysis was performed by t-test with a Bonferroni correction (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01), between the experimental samples and the corresponding wild-type control We also examined the molecular response for four genes whose expression is repressed in response to 1 μL L−1 ethylene in wild type (Fig. CITATION) [CITATION]. Effects of the transgenic lines on the ethylene-repressed genes were less consistent than on the set of ethylene-induced genes. However, notably, the basal expression levels for both KIN2 and CHS were significantly higher in the 35S::ARGOS and 35S::ARL lines (Fig. CITATION), consistent with the response to endogenous ethylene in these lines being compromised such that they no longer suppress expression of these genes effectively. As an alternative approach to examine the ability of ARGOS family members to inhibit ethylene-dependent gene expression, we employed a transient protoplast assay with the ethylene-inducible luciferase reporters ERF1-LUC or GCC-LUC [CITATION–CITATION]. Treatment of protoplasts with ethylene induces expression of the luciferase reporters (Fig. CITATION). However, co-transfection with either ARGOS or ARL reduces the responsiveness of the luciferase reporter to the exogenous ethylene treatment. The basal level of expression for the luciferase reporter is also reduced, indicating that expression of ARGOS or ARL reduces the response to endogenous ethylene. Overall, these molecular results reveal that the ARGOS family members function as negative regulators of the ethylene-signaling pathway. We used time-lapse imaging to examine the growth inhibition kinetics of hypocotyls from two-day-old, dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. We have previously shown that application of higher concentrations of ethylene (>1 μL L−1) to wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings results in a rapid reduction in growth rate approximately 10 min after application of ethylene, with seedlings reaching a new steady state growth rate approximately 75 min after ethylene addition [CITATION, CITATION]. Application of 0.1 μL L−1 ethylene causes growth inhibition with kinetics that are initially indistinguishable from higher dosages [CITATION]. However, approximately 2.5 h after 0.1 μL L−1 ethylene application, desensitization is observed where the growth rate increases to a new steady-state rate approximately 50 % of that observed in air [CITATION]. We obtained similar results with wild-type seedlings in the current study (Fig. CITATION). Overexpression of either ARGOS or ARL resulted in seedlings that initiated desensitization with a shorter delay and which reached a higher growth rate than wild-type seedlings (Fig. CITATION, Table CITATION). These results indicate that changes in expression of ARGOS family members modulate the seedling desensitization response to ethylene.Fig. 7Overexpression of ARGOS and ARL accelerate the desensitization response to ethylene.

!~MM~! To make constructs for expression of ARGOS (At3g59900) and ARL (At2g44080) with C-terminal GFP tags and driven under their native promoters, genomic fragments including 5′ flanking regions (1640 bp and 1479 bp for ARGOS and ARL, respectively) and coding regions (390 bp and 405 bp for ARGOS and ARL, respectively) were amplified from wild-type Col-0 genomic DNA, using the ARGOS primers 5′-TGGTCAACGATTCAAGGAGATCCA-3′ and 5′-GCCGATTGACATGAAATTGCAAGTTACATCTG-3′, and the ARL primers 5′-TAGCCACCACATGAAATGCCGAGA-3′ and 5′-GCCGATTGACATGAAATTGCAAGTTACATCTG-3′. Fragments were cloned into the entry vector pCR8 (Invitrogen, USA) and then recombined into the vector pGWB204 [CITATION] using the Gateway system. For overexpression of ARGOS and ARL in plants and protoplasts, their coding regions were amplified from cDNA, with ARGOS amplified using the primers 5′-GAATCCATGATTCGAGAAATCTCAAACTTAC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTGACATGAAATTGCAAGTTACATCTG-3′ and ARL amplified using the primers 5′-GAATCATGATTCGTGAGTTCTCCAGTCTAC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCATAAAAGTGGAAGAAGAAGAAACATG-3′, and the fragments cloned into pCR8. The fragments were moved into pEarleyGate100 [CITATION] for stable plant transformation and into CsVGFP-999 [CITATION] for protoplast transfection. For plant transformation, constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and transformed into Arabidopsis by the floral-dip method [CITATION]. Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated and transfected as described [CITATION]. Visualization for localization studies was with a Leica TCS SP UV confocal microscope, GFP being imaged with a 488 nm laser, RFP with a 561 nm laser, and protoplasts with DIC optics. For analysis of the ethylene response, the reporter constructs GCC-LUC [CITATION] and ERF1-LUC [CITATION] were used. The UBQ10-GUS construct was used as an internal control. Transfected protoplast samples in culture dishes were placed in air-tight containers with or without 10 μL L−1 ethylene for 6 h at 22 °C under dim light (5 μE⋅m−2⋅s−1). The results are shown as the means of relative LUC activities from duplicate samples with error bars. Microsomal and soluble fractions were isolated from green Arabidopsis seedlings as described [CITATION]. Briefly, plant material was homogenized in 30 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 20 % (v/v) glycerol, with protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma) and then centrifuged at 8,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min, and the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 % (v/v) glycerol with protease inhibitors cocktail. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described [CITATION]. The BCA assay (Pierce) was used to measure protein concentration as described [CITATION]. Before SDS-PAGE, protein samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to denature integral membrane proteins without aggregation. Primary antibodies used were HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ETR1 [CITATION], anti-BIP (Stressgen Biotech), and anti-ACC oxidase (Santra Cruz Biotechnology). For short-term ethylene treatment of green seedlings, seedlings were grown at 22 °C for two to three weeks with constant light on Murashige and Skoog basal medium with Gamborg’s vitamins (pH 5.75; Sigma), 1 % (w/v) sucrose and 8 % (w/v) agar [CITATION], then treated for the indicated times and ethylene concentrations in sealed containers. Treatment and analysis of the triple response of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings to ethylene was performed as described [CITATION]. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG; 5 μM), an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, was included in the media to reduce endogenous ethylene production. For short-term kinetic analysis of dark-grown seedlings, time-lapse imaging and growth rate analysis of hypocotyls were carried out as previously described [CITATION, CITATION]. To determine leaf size, cell area, and cells per leaf of ethylene pathway mutants compared to ARGOS family mutants, the fully expanded fifth leaf was analyzed from 30-day-old plants grown under an 18-h light/6-h dark cycle. Cell area was determined from palisade cells at the central region of the leaf beside the mid-vein as described [CITATION], with 10 palisade cells characterized per leaf. Area determination measurements were made with IMAGE J software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). ANOVA tables were generated using http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/anova.html and multiple comparison tests done using http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/posttest1/ quick calc web tool that uses the Bonferroni correction for post-test comparisons. Total RNA was extracted from seedlings using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and cDNA synthesized using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, USA) as described [CITATION]. For quantitative RT-PCR, RNA from three biological replicates was used as template for first-strand cDNA synthesis, and three experimental replicate reactions were performed for each biological replicate using primer pairs specific for the genes of interest. The following primers were used: ARGOS (5′-GTCATGGACGTCGGAAGAAACAAC-3′ and 5′-GGGAACCAATAGCAGCATAAACGG-3′); ARL (5′-CAACAACAACATGGACGTGAGAGG-3′ and 5′- GGAGGCAATGGTGGAAGAATCAAC-3′); OSR1 (At2g41230) (5′-ATGAGGGTTCATGATCAACGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGGCTCATTAGAAGGAGAAA-3′); OSR2 (At2g41225) (5′-TGATGGTGCTATTGGCGGTT-3′ and 5′- CAAACGACGACGCATTCACA-3′), ERS1 (At2g40940) (5′-ACCTATGTGTGCAGGTGAAGGACA-3′ and 5′-AGCCCGACAAACCGTTTACAG AGA-3′); ERS2 (At1g04310) (5′-TCAAGAAGCGGTTTGGCTACATTG-3′ and 5′-TAGACCGTCCTCAACAACCCGAAT-3′); ETR2 (At3g23150) (5′-AGAGAAACTCGGGTGCGATGT-3′ and 5′-TCACTGTCGTCGCCACAATC-3′); Peroxidase ATP-N (At5g19890) (5′-AGTGACTTAGCCGTGAACACCACA-3′ and 5′-ACGAGACCGATCAACTCCCAAACA-3′); ACO ACC-oxidase (At1g77330) (5′-GTGATGGATGAGAATTTGGGTTTGCC-3′ and 5′-ATCGATCCACTCGCCGTCTTTCAA-3′); and pEARL1-like (At4g12470) (5′-AGTCCTAAACCAAAGCCAGTCCCA-3′ and 5′-CGATATTGTGCACTGGCATCGCAT-3′), KIN2 (AT5G15960) (5′-TGTATCGGATGCGGCAGCG-3′ and 5′-TTTGAATATAAGTTTGGCTCGTCT-3′), CHS (At5g13930) (5′-TGCTTACATGGCTCCTTCTCTGGA-3′ and 5′-ATCTCAGAGCAGACAACGAGGACA-3′), APG-like (AT1G75900) (5′-TTTGCGTCCGGAGGTTCTGGTTAT-3′ and 5′-CTGAGGCAGAGTCAGACATAAGAG-3′), and a pathogen-related gene (AT4G25780) (5′-TGACCACGACTCCTTGCAGTTCTT-3′ and 5′-ATGAAGATCCCACCATTGTCGCAC-3′). For RT-PCR, the ARGOS transgene (5′-GGTCTAACGGCATCTCTGTTAAT-3′ and 5′-GTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGAA-3′) and the native gene (5′-CCAGTTGCCCTAAAGATCAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCATGACTCGGTTGTTC-3′) were specifically amplified with the indicated primers; the ARL transgene (5′-TGTTGGTCTCACAGCATCTC-3′ and 5′-CACCTAGGCACCACTTTGTA-3′) and the native gene (5′-CTCAAGTTTCTTCTTCATACATCG-3′ and 5′-TCCGGTTATGATCTCCTCTC-3′) were specifically amplified with the indicated primers; total expression levels were determined with the primers listed earlier for qRT-PCR. Beta-tubulin (At5g62700) was used as a control for qRT-PCR with primers 5′-CGTAAGCTTGCTGTGAATCTCATC-3′ and 5′-CTGCTCGTCAACTTCCTTTGTG-3′ and for RT-PCR with primers 5′-TGGTGGAGCCTTACAACGCTACTT-3′ and 5′-TTCACAGCAAGCTTACGGAGGTCA-3′.
