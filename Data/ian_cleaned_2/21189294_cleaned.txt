!~ABS~! The nuclear pore complex (NPC) facilitates nucleocytoplasmic transport, a crucial process for various cellular activities. The NPC comprises ~30 nucleoporins and is well characterized in vertebrates and yeast. However, only eight plant nucleoporins have been identified, and little information is available about the complete molecular structure of plant NPCs. In this study, an interactive proteomic approach was used to identify Arabidopsis thaliana nucleoporins. A series of five cycles of interactive proteomic analysis was performed using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged nucleoporins. The identified nucleoporins were then cloned and subcellular localization analyses were performed. We found that the plant NPC contains at least 30 nucleoporins, 22 of which had not been previously annotated. Surprisingly, plant nucleoporins shared a similar domain organization to their vertebrate (human) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) counterparts. Moreover, the plant nucleoporins exhibited higher sequence homology to vertebrate nucleoporins than to yeast nucleoporins. Plant NPCs lacked seven components (NUCLEOPORIN358 [Nup358], Nup188, Nup153, Nup45, Nup37, NUCLEAR DIVISION CYCLE1, and PORE MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF 121 kD) that were present in vertebrate NPCs. However, plants possessed a nucleoporin, Nup136/Nup1, that contained Phe-Gly repeats, and sequence analysis failed to identify a vertebrate homolog for this protein. Interestingly, Nup136-GFP showed greater mobility on the nuclear envelope than did other nucleoporins, and a Nup136/Nup1 deficiency caused various defects in plant development. These findings provide valuable new information about plant NPC structure and function.
!~RES~! The nucleoporin RAE1 (RNA export factor 1) is encoded by a wide range of plant genomes and is known to function in mRNA export and spindle assembly in tobacco (CITATION) and vertebrates (CITATION). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP-tagged Arabidopsis RAE1 were generated to analyze the NPC in living cells. Imaging indicated that RAE1-GFP localized predominantly to the nuclear envelope in root tip cells (Figure 1A). The nuclear surface exhibited dot-like fluorescent signals (Figure 1B), which were similar to the NPC fluorescent signals obtained from other eukaryotes (CITATION). These results suggest that RAE1-GFP localizes to the NPC. [[FIGURE]] Anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate detergent-solubilized fractions from wild-type and transgenic RAE1-GFP plants. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by either silver staining (Figure 1C) or immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 1D). A single band on the immunoblot confirmed the presence of intact RAE1-GFP in the immunoprecipitate (Figure 1D). Silver staining indicated that the RAE1-GFP sample contained numerous bands that were not present in the wild-type sample, suggesting that the immunoprecipitate contained many components of the NPC. To identify the proteins present in the immunoprecipitate, mass spectrometry analysis was performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap for in-gel and in-solution digestions. A total of 200 proteins were identified in the RAE1-GFP sample, each containing one or more of the peptides detected in the mass spectrometry analysis. However, none of these proteins were present in the wild-type immunoprecipitate (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). The 200 Arabidopsis proteins were compared with databases containing metazoan nucleoporin sequences, and 25 proteins were identified as candidate nucleoporins based on sequence similarity. These were named according to their size and similarity to human nucleoporins (Figure 1E). To determine whether the 24 nucleoporin candidates localize to the nuclear envelope, cDNAs and/or genes encoding these proteins were cloned. The gene encoding Nup214 was incorrectly registered as two independent genes (At1g55540 and At1g55545) in the Arabidopsis genome database (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/). Constructs encoding GFP-nucleoporin fusion proteins were prepared for 17 of the 24 nucleoporins, and these expression constructs were transiently expressed in protoplasts derived from cultured Arabidopsis cells (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). In addition, constructs encoding 13 GFP-tagged nucleoporins were generated and then expressed stably in transgenic Arabidopsis lines (Figure 2). With the exception of Sec13-GFP, all of the stably expressed nucleoporins localized specifically to the nuclear envelope (Figure 2). Sec13-GFP was found on the nuclear envelope and in dot-like structures within the cytoplasm (Figure 2). In addition to nuclear envelope localization, most transiently expressed nucleoporins were distributed within the cytoplasm and/or nucleoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). This distribution pattern is consistent with that of endogenous nucleoporins in cultured animal cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The localization of transiently expressed Nup133-GFP differed from that of the other nucleoporins, as it was not detected on the nuclear envelope, but rather in the nucleoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). However, this unexpected localization pattern might represent an artifact caused by the GFP tag. The anti-GFP antibody coimmunoprecipitated endogenous Nup133 and GFP-tagged nucleoporins (RAE1-GFP, Nup93a-GFP, and Nup43-GFP) in the detergent-solubilized fraction (Figure 1E; see below and Supplemental Figure 2C and Supplemental Data Sets 1 to 3 online). In Arabidopsis Nup133, amino acids 651 to 1087 show 39% similarity to the corresponding region of human Nup133, which suggests that Nup133 is an NPC component on the nuclear envelope. [[FIGURE]] In mass spectrometry analysis, Nup93a exhibited the highest Mascot score, which indicates that, among the identified candidates, Nup93a is most likely to interact with RAE1 (Figure 1E). Extracts prepared from a transgenic plant stably expressing Nup93a-GFP were immunoprecipitated and then subjected to a second mass spectrometric analysis (see Supplemental Data Set 2 and Supplemental Table 1 online). Nup93a-GFP coimmunoprecipitated with 11 nucleoporins (see Supplemental Table 1 online), 10 of which were identified in the immunoprecipitate of plants expressing RAE1-GFP (Figure 1E). The remaining nucleoporin was identified as At1g52380, for which amino acids 231 to 378 show 46% similarity to the corresponding region of human Nup50. Arabidopsis was found to produce another homolog, At3g15970, which exhibits 59% sequence similarity to At1g52380. A RanBP1 domain is found in both of these Arabidopsis proteins (see Figure 4) and in human Nup50 (CITATION). Therefore, At1g52380 and At3g15970 were designated as Nup50a and Nup50b, respectively. To determine the localization of Nup50a and Nup50b, GFP fusion constructs of these proteins were stably and transiently expressed in Arabidopsis. Nup50a-GFP and Nup50b-GFP localized to the nucleoplasm, rather than to the nuclear envelope (Figures 3A and 3B), a finding consistent with Nup50 localization in other eukaryotes (CITATION). Following immunoprecipitation of extract from transgenic plants stably expressing Nup50a-GFP, we performed a third mass spectrometric analysis. Nup50a-GFP coimmunoprecipitated with one nucleoporin (Nup50b) and seven nucleocytoplasmic transport factors (six importins and one RAS-RELATED NUCLEAR [Ran] protein) (Figure 3C; see Supplemental Data Set 4 online). This result suggests that Nup50a is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport via its interactions with importins and Ran, rather than by forming part of the NPC scaffolding. [[FIGURE]] The Arabidopsis genome database was queried with human nucleoporin sequences and a specific motif for the nucleoporins identified as Nup43 and Nup35, which were not detected in the coimmunoprecipitation analysis of GFP-tagged nucleoporins. Nup43-GFP localized to the nuclear envelope in both transgenic plants (see Supplemental Figure 2A online) and protoplasts (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). A fourth mass spectrometric analysis showed that Nup43-GFP coimmunoprecipitated with 13 nucleoporins (see Supplemental Figure 2C and Supplemental Data Set 3 online), indicating that Nup43 is a component of the plant NPC. Arabidopsis Nup35 has a molecular mass of 35.4 kD and contains a mitotic phosphoprotein N' end domain (Table 1), which is also found in human Nup35. Neither Nup35-GFP nor GFP-Nup35 was expressed successfully in Arabidopsis cells, suggesting that the GFP-tagged Nup35 may be unstable in vivo. Summary of Arabidopsis Nucleoporins Identified HOS1 (for HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSE GENE1) was immunoprecipitated with either RAE1-GFP (Figure 1E; see Supplemental Data Set 1 online) or Nup43-GFP (see Supplemental Data Set 3 online). HOS1, which functions as a negative regulator of cold signaling (CITATION), is distributed throughout the nucleus and cytosol of Arabidopsis (CITATION). We found that HOS1 contains a region with homology to vertebrate nucleoporin EMBRYONIC LARGE MOLECULE DERIVED FROM YOLK SAC (Elys) (see Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B online), which is critical for recruiting the Nup107-160 complex to chromatin (CITATION; CITATION). HOS1 homologs are found in the genome databases of other higher plants. However, it is interesting to note that these homologs are almost half the molecular size of vertebrate Elys proteins. Taken together, the results suggest that HOS1 may perform similar functions to Elys, acting as a component of plant NPCs. Lamins are a major component of the nuclear laminae on the interior of the nuclear envelope in vertebrates. Although no lamin gene homologs have been detected in plant genomes (CITATION), a filamentous lattice similar to vertebrate lamina was identified by ultrastructural analysis of the nuclear envelope of tobacco (CITATION). CITATION reported that this filamentous structure was attached to the inner nuclear membrane and linked to the NPC (CITATION), which indicates a physical interaction between these structures. Recently, LITTLE NUCLEI (LINC) proteins have been identified as potential lamin-like proteins in Arabidopsis (CITATION). LINC proteins are predicted to form a large coiled-coil region similar to that observed in vertebrate lamin proteins, and they are involved in the maintenance of nuclear morphology (CITATION). However, we were unable to identify LINC or filamentous proteins with a long coiled-coil region from our interactive proteomics studies using GFP-tagged nucleoporins (see Supplemental Data Sets 1 to 5 online). Our failure to detect these components could be due to technical limitations of the interactive proteomics method used. In this study, eight known plant nucleoporins (Nup160, Nup133, Nup96, Nup88, Nup75, Tpr/NUA, Nup1, and RAE1) and 22 novel nucleoporins were isolated from Arabidopsis and characterized (Table 1; CITATION). These Arabidopsis nucleoporins show homology to human nucleoporins. However, seven human NPCs (Nup358, Nup188, Nup153, Nup45, Nup37, NDC1, and Pom121) do not appear to have homologs in the genome databases of higher plants, including Arabidopsis, poplar (Populus trichocarpa), grape (Vitis vinifera), and rice (Oryza sativa). The absence of these nucleoporins might account for differences in size between plant and vertebrate NPCs (discussed later). Higher sequence similarity scores and lower E-values were obtained for sequence homologies between Arabidopsis and human nucleoporins than between Arabidopsis and yeast nucleoporins (Figure 4). This finding suggests that the NPC structure of Arabidopsis is more similar to the human NPC structure than to the yeast structure. On the other hand, the domain organization of each nucleoporin was similar in Arabidopsis, human, and yeast (Figure 4; see Supplemental Table 2 online), which indicates a similar NPC architecture among these organisms (Figure 8). [[FIGURE]] The RAE1-GFP immunoprecipitation technique allowed identification of Nup136, a 136-kD nucleoporin with a sequence unique to higher plants (Figure 1E). In a recent study, yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that Nup136 interacts with the mRNA export complex and, in that study, Nup136 was named Arabidopsis Nup1 (CITATION). Nup136/Nup1 homologs are present in various plants, but not in yeast or vertebrates, which suggests that Nup136/Nup1 is unique to higher plant species. Nup136/Nup1 has FG repeats in the C-terminal region (Figure 4, orange lines), but contains no other known functional motifs. The FG repeats mediate the translocation of transport factor-cargo complexes through the NPC by interacting with transport factors (CITATION). The presence of such repeats in Nup136/Nup1 suggests that this protein may be required for active transport through the NPC. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants, Nup136-GFP localized to the nuclear envelope (Figure 2; see Supplemental Figure 1 online) and coimmunoprecipitated with three nucleoporins and four importin proteins (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Data Set 5 online). These results suggest that Nup136-GFP is incorporated into the NPC and that it interacts with importin proteins. [[FIGURE]] To determine if Nup136-GFP is mobile on the nuclear envelope, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis was performed in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells (Figure 5B). GFP-tagged nucleoporins from each subcomplex of the NPC were also selected and expressed as controls. After the nuclear envelopes of interphase cells were subjected to photobleaching, Nup136-GFP fluorescence recovered, whereas the fluorescence of other nucleoporins did not (Figure 5B). This finding suggests that, unlike other nucleoporins, Nup136 interacts dynamically with the NPC on the nuclear envelope. The subcellular dynamics of Nup136-GFP were investigated in tobacco BY-2 cells to determine how Nup136 disassembles and reassembles during mitosis. Figure 5C shows confocal time-lapse microscopy of cells stably expressing Nup136-GFP together with Histone2B-tdTomato, a vital marker for chromatin DNA (CITATION). At interphase (−180 s), specific nuclear envelope labeling of Nup136-GFP was present. At metaphase (0 to ~460 s), Nup136-GFP fluorescence was dispersed throughout the cytosol, and no membranous structures were observed. At early anaphase (~780 s), Nup136-GFP–labeled particle-like structures were detected in the cytosol. Subsequently (~880 s), Nup136-GFP fluorescence was observed in membranous structures around each chromosome in daughter cells. By the end of telophase (~1060 s), Nup136-GFP fluorescence labeled the nuclear envelopes of each daughter cell, and cytoplasmic pools were almost entirely depleted. These results suggest that Nup136/Nup1 disassembles and disperses into the cytosolic pool during nuclear envelope breakdown and then reassembles as the nuclear envelope reforms in daughter cells. To determine the physiological role of Arabidopsis Nup136, two T-DNA insertion mutant lines, nup136-1 and nup136-2, were isolated (Figure 6A). RT-PCR analysis revealed that no full-length NUP136 transcripts were present in the nup136-1 and nup136-2 mutants (Figure 6B). The nup136 mutants showed developmental defects. Although the plants grew normally before bolting, the nup136 mutants exhibited an early flowering phenotype (Figure 6C). Under long-day conditions, the mutants produced fewer rosette leaves (5.7 ± 0.8 for nup136-1 and 7.0 ± 1.1 for nup136-2) than wild-type plants (12.8 ± 0.6) at bolting (Figure 6D). The early flowering phenotype has been observed previously in Arabidopsis nucleoporin mutants, including nup96 (CITATION), nup160 (CITATION; CITATION), and tpr/nua (CITATION; CITATION). The tpr/nua mutant contains significantly reduced levels of several microRNAs (miR159, miR165, and miR393) that are important for regulating flowering time (CITATION). Taken together, these results suggest that nuclear pores are involved in the transport of unknown factors that might determine flowering time in Arabidopsis. [[FIGURE]] The nup136 mutants produced stunted fruits (Figure 6E, inset) with substantially fewer mature seed grains (5.5 ± 3.3 grains for nup136-1 and 6.9 ± 3.6 grains for nup136-2) than the wild type (32.1 ± 3.6 grains). Some nup136 pollen grains were shrunken (Figures 6F to 6H, arrows) and an in vitro pollen germination assay showed significantly lower germination rates for nup136 pollen (51.3% ± 10.0% for nup136-1 and 43.6% ± 16.7% for nup136-2) than the wild type (80.3% ± 6.3% for the wild type) (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). These results suggest that Nup136 is important for proper pollen development, which is required for seed production. Transport receptors export mRNA from the nucleus, and these receptors interact specifically with nucleoporins in the NPC (CITATION). Arabidopsis nucleoporins, including Nup160 (CITATION) and Tpr/NUA (CITATION), are involved in mRNA export from the nucleus. To determine the functional role played by Nup136 in mRNA export, in situ hybridization analysis was performed with oligo(dT) probes to localize poly(A)+ RNA in wild-type Arabidopsis and nup136 mutants. A higher nuclear poly(A)+ RNA signal was detected in the leaf cells of nup136 mutants than in those of the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), which suggests that, in Arabidopsis, Nup136 is required for mRNA export through the NPC. This result is consistent with a previous study (CITATION). Arabidopsis Nup136 was also found to regulate nuclear morphology (Figure 7). In rosette leaf epidermal cells from the nup136-1 and nup136-2 mutants, the nuclei were more spherical and uniform than those in wild-type plants (Figures 7A), exhibiting a shorter major axis and a higher circularity index (Figures 7B and 7C). These results suggest that Nup136 is required for wild-type nuclear morphology. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was used as the wild type. Protoplasts were prepared from cultured Arabidopsis cells that had been subcultured and were incubated in medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts and 0.4 M mannitol, as described previously (CITATION). Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells were cultured as described previously (CITATION). T-DNA insertion mutants (SALK_104728 [nup136-1] and SAIL_796_H02 [nup136-2]) were obtained from the ABRC at Ohio State University. The data sets of the Arabidopsis nucleoporins were queried against The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database (http://www.Arabidopsis.org), ATTED-II (http://atted.jp/), or GenomeNet (http://www.genome.jp/) to obtain annotations, functional assignments, structural information, and sequence relationships. Domain architectures were predicted using a domain analysis tool on the EMBL-EBI website (InterProScan; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/), except that the transmembrane region of gp210 was predicted with the tool in the TMHMM server v.2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/); SMC_prok_A and SMC_prok_B of Tpr/NUA were listed in the TIGR Rice Genome Annotation Resource, and RING-type zinc finger of Elys/HOS1 was listed in UniProt. Genomic DNAs and cDNAs of all 30 Arabidopsis nucleoporins identified were cloned into either pENTR/D-TOPO or pENTR1A (Invitrogen) using specific primers (see Supplemental Table 3 online). To generate the DNA constructs for GFP-tagged nucleoporins, each of the cloned nucleoporin DNAs was transferred from the entry clone to the destination vector pGWB405 (CITATION, CITATION) by an LR reaction. Histone 2B (At5g22880) cDNA was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (see Supplemental Table 3 online) and was then cloned into the entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). To generate the DNA construct for Histone 2B-tdTomato, the cloned cDNA was transferred from the entry vector to destination vector pGWtd by an LR reaction. Protoplasts derived from cultured Arabidopsis cells were transiently transformed with constructs encoding GFP-tagged nucleoporins using the polyethylene glycol method (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants and tobacco BY-2 cells were transformed by infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The cells were inspected by confocal laser scanning microscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy (model LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss). Total RNA was isolated from 10-d-old seedlings using a RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using a kit (Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads; GE Healthcare) with an oligo(dT)12-18 primer. Gene-specific primers are given in Supplemental Table 3 online. ACT2 was amplified in 27 PCR cycles and NUP136 in 30. PCR products were visualized with ethidium bromide. An in vitro pollen germination assay was performed as described previously (CITATION). Pollen grains were inspected by light microscopy 20 h after germination. Fluorescence confocal images were obtained using a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss) equipped with the 405-nm line of a blue diode laser, 488-nm line of a 40-mW Ar/Kr laser, or the 544-nm line of a 1-mW He/Ne laser and a ×100 1.45–numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion objective (alpha Plan-Fluar, 000000-1084-514; Carl Zeiss), ×63 1.2-NA water immersion objective (C-Apochromat, 441777-9970-000; Carl Zeiss), or ×40 0.95-NA dry objective (Plan-Apochromat, 440654-9902-000; Carl Zeiss). Image analysis was performed using LSM image examiner software (Carl Zeiss). The data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using either Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 (Adobe Systems) or ImageJ 1.40g (National Institutes of Health). FRAP experiments were performed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss) using a ×40 0.95-NA dry objective (Plan-Apochromat, 440654-9902-000; Carl Zeiss) and a completely open pinhole. Fluorescence on the particular region (22 × 22 pixels) of nuclear envelope was bleached with full laser power. After photobleaching, images were acquired for 790 s at 30-s intervals. Protein extracts from seedlings and isolated nuclei were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblot analysis. Immunoreactive signals were detected with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare) using anti-GFP antibody (JL-8; Clontech) (1:3000). Antibodies were diluted with Solution 1 of an immunostaining kit (Can Get Signal Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution; Toyobo). Immunoreactive signals were detected with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation was performed with μMACS Epitope Tag Protein Isolation Kits (Miltenyi Biotec). Whole seedlings of each transgenic Arabidopsis plant (~0.5 g) expressing GFP-tagged nucleoporins were homogenized on ice in 2 mL of buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000g for 15 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were mixed with magnetic beads conjugated to an anti-GFP antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) and then incubated on ice for 10 min. The mixtures were applied to μ Columns (Miltenyi Biotec) in a magnetic field to capture the magnetic antigen-antibody complex. After extensive washing with the buffer, immunoaffinity complexes were eluted with 50 μL of either 0.1 M Na2CO3 solution, pH 11.0, or 2× SDS sample buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions eluted with 0.1 M Na2CO3 were subsequently neutralized with 5 μL of 1 M MES. The immunoprecipitates were reduced-alkylated and then treated with 0.01 mg/mL trypsin (sequence grade; Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. The digested peptides were recovered twice with 20 μL of 5% (v/v) formic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. The extracted peptides were combined and then evaporated to 10 μL in a vacuum concentrator. For in-gel digestion, the protein components of the immunoprecipitates were separated on a 3-cm-long SDS gel. The gel slice isolated from each lane was cut into three fractions according to molecular mass: a <50-kD fraction, a 50- to 100-kD fraction, and a >100-kD fraction. Each excised gel fraction was treated twice with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile for 10 min followed by 100% (v/v) acetonitrile for 15 min, and then dried in a vacuum concentrator. The dried gel was treated with 0.01 mg/mL trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. The digested peptides were recovered twice with 20 μL of 5% (v/v) formic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. The extracted peptides were combined and then evaporated to 10 μL in a vacuum concentrator. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses were performed using the LTQ-Orbitrap XL-HTC-PAL system. Trypsin digests were loaded on the column (75-μm internal diameter, 15-cm length; L-Column, CERI) using the Paradigm MS4 HPLC pump (Michrom BioResources) and HTC-PAL Autosampler (CTC Analytics), and were eluted by a gradient of 5 to 45% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid for 70 min. The eluted peptides were introduced directly into an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo) with a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The range of MS scan was m/z 450 to 1500. The top three peaks were subjected to MS/MS analysis. MS/MS spectra were analyzed by the Mascot server (version 2.2) in house (CITATION) (http://www.matrixscience.com/) and compared against proteins registered in TAIR8. The Mascot search parameters were set as follows: threshold of the ion score cutoff, 0.05; peptide tolerance, 10 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, ±0.8 D; and peptide charge, 2+ or 3+. The search was also set to allow one missed cleavage by trypsin, a carboxymethylation modification of Cys residues, and a variable oxidation modification of Met residues. The poly (A)+ RNA in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (CITATION). The 45-mer oligo(dT) labeled with one fluorescein molecule at the 5′-end (Hokkaido system science, Hokkaido, Japan) was used as a probe. The stained cells were inspected with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). The nuclei in rosette leaves from 2-week-old plants were stained for 30 min with 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 solution, 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 10% (v/v) DMSO, 3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 1 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM EGTA. The stained nuclei were inspected with a confocal laser scanning microscope by exciting with a 405-nm diode laser (Carl Zeiss).
