!~ABS~! The serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins constitute a conserved family of pre-mRNA splicing factors. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), they are encoded by 19 genes, most of which are themselves alternatively spliced. In the case of SR45, the use of alternative 3′ splice sites 21 nucleotides apart generates two alternatively spliced isoforms. Isoform 1 (SR45.1) has an insertion relative to isoform 2 (SR45.2) that replaces a single arginine with eight amino acids (TSPQRKTG). The biological implications of SR45 alternative splicing have been unclear. A previously described loss-of-function mutant affecting both isoforms, sr45-1, shows several developmental defects, including defects in petal development and root growth. We found that the SR45 promoter is highly active in regions with actively growing and dividing cells. We also tested the ability of each SR45 isoform to complement the sr45-1 mutant by overexpression of isoform-specific green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. As expected, transgenic plants overexpressing either isoform displayed both nuclear speckles and GFP fluorescence throughout the nucleoplasm. We found that SR45.1-GFP complements the flower petal phenotype, but not the root growth phenotype. Conversely, SR45.2-GFP complements root growth but not floral morphology. Mutation of a predicted phosphorylation site within the alternatively spliced segment, SR45.1-S219A-GFP, does not affect complementation. However, a double mutation affecting both serine-219 and the adjacent threonine-218 (SR45.1-T218A + S219A-GFP) behaves like isoform 2, complementing the root but not the floral phenotype. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the two alternatively spliced isoforms of SR45 have distinct biological functions.
!~RES~! SR45 has, in addition to an RRM domain with similarity to other SR proteins, an N-terminal low complexity domain rich in Ser and Arg-Ser repeats and a C-terminal low complexity domain rich in Arg-Ser repeats and SPXR motifs (Fig. 1B). This domain structure differs from that found in other SR proteins, which uniformly lack an amino-terminal RS domain (CITATION), but resembles the domain structure in RNPS1 (Fig. 1B). RNPS1 and SR45 are listed as orthologs on the inparanoid Web site (CITATION), and have been treated as such in previous publications (CITATION), but CITATION describe SR45 as a novel, plant-specific splicing factor. When the Arabidopsis SR45 RRM (At1g16610.1; amino acids 99–173) is used as a query in a blast search, RNPS1 is identified as the most similar human protein. Conversely, when the human RNPS1 RRM is used as a query, SR45 is found to be the most similar Arabidopsis protein. This reciprocal best hit relationship indicates, but does not establish, orthology. On the other hand, the functions of RNPS1 and SR proteins are related, and Arabidopsis SR45 has been shown to function as a splicing factor in human extracts (CITATION). In the absence of data that address the critical question of whether the Arabidopsis SR45 protein functions, like RNPS1, as part of the Arabidopsis EJC, we follow CITATION by referring to it as an SR protein. Extensive analysis by reverse transcription (RT) and PCR (CITATION; data not shown) reveals two SR45 isoforms that differ by a 21-nucleotide sequence that is present in isoform 1 (SR45.1) but missing in isoform 2 (SR45.2) due to an alternative acceptor splice site at the beginning of the seventh exon (Fig. 1A). Because the alternatively spliced segment is in frame, it is likely that both isoforms are functional. We first examined the response of isoform abundance to different plant hormones and environmental cues. Using a common set of flanking primers (Fig. 2A ) we found that the relative level of the two isoforms was significantly altered in response to Suc (there is less SR45.2 in the absence of Suc) and temperature changes (the level of SR45.2 is reduced in cold, and increased in warm, temperatures). We next examined the level of these two isoforms in different plant tissues using isoform-specific primers to avoid competition between overlapping products during amplification. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the ratio of the two isoforms (SR45.1/SR45.2) is close to 1.0 in root and inflorescence, and only slightly less (0.87) in leaf tissue (Fig. 2B). Both SR45 isoforms are present at much higher levels (10-fold or more) in root and inflorescence tissues than in leaves (Fig. 2B). Thus, despite large differences in the overall level of expression, there is not a significant difference between tissues with respect to the ratio of the two spliced isoforms. [[FIGURE]] Root and inflorescence tissue both contain meristematic regions with active cell division, while leaf cells are rather differentiated. This suggested that SR45 may be preferentially expressed in actively dividing cells. Organ-specific microarray expression profiles collected by Genevestigator (CITATION) showed that the expression of SR45 was detected in all plant organs, with the highest levels in imbibed seeds, root tip, shoot apex, and inflorescence tissues (Supplemental Fig. S1). Previous microarray data on pollen showed that SR45 expression is high in both unicellular and bicellular pollen (CITATION). All of this indicates that the expression of SR45 is associated with both root and flower development, perhaps pollen development in particular. To examine the transcriptional regulation of SR45, we fused the SR45 promoter sequence to a GUS reporter gene. Transgenic lines carrying this reporter showed the strongest GUS activity in pollen, primary and secondary root meristem, shoot apical meristem, and leaf primordia (Fig. 2C). The GUS activity was also detected in vascular tissue, hydathode, and cells close to the root meristem. These results are consistent with the idea that SR45 transcription is enriched in, and perhaps limited to, actively dividing and rapidly growing cells. The eight amino acid segment found in SR45.1 but not SR45.2, TSPQRKTG, contains a potential phosphorylation site, at Ser 219 (S219) that is predicted by both the NetPhos 2.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos; CITATION) with significantly high score (0.994) and by the Arabidopsis Protein Phosphorylation Site Database (PhosPhAt) with the prediction score of +0.932 (CITATION). To assess the potential functional difference between SR45.1 and SR45.2 we introduced a point mutation at this position (S219A). In addition, Thr 218 (T218) was also predicted as a possible phosphorylation site (score = 0.913) by NetPhos 2.0 Server but not PhosphAt. We mutated the Thr to Ala together with S219 (T218A + S219A) to see if T218 has any impact on SR45 function in addition to S219. We individually expressed SR45.1-GFP, SR45.1-S219A-GFP, SR45.1-T218A + S219A-GFP, and SR45.2-GFP with GFP fused at the C terminus of each proteins transiently in sr45-1 mutant mesophyll protoplasts and detected GFP signal in the nucleus of transfected protoplasts for all the constructs (Fig. 3A ). Then we generated stable transgenic lines with these constructs in the sr45-1 mutant background for in vivo functional study (Fig. 3, B and C). In transgenic plants overexpressing SR45.1-GFP (OX1), the narrow flower petal phenotype in sr45-1 mutants was rescued (Fig. 3D). Similar rescue was observed by using an N-terminal GFP fusion (GFPSR45.1) in an earlier independent study (CITATION). Putting these results together, it appears that SR45 can tolerate a GFP fusion at either terminus. All of our studies were conducted with the C-terminal GFP fusion. [[FIGURE]] Oddly, plants overexpressing SR45.2-GFP (OX2) did not rescue the narrow petal phenotype (Fig. 3D). Nor was this phenotype rescued by the T218A, S219A double mutant (OX1TSAA; Fig. 3D). However, a single mutation of S219A (OX1SA) behaved like wild-type OX1 with respect to the flower petal phenotype (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that S219 is not required for the normal flower petal development, but T218 is required, either as an alternative phosphorylation site or by itself. We did not test a mutation of only T218. The root growth of sr45-1 mutant seedlings was significantly delayed compared to wild-type seedlings (Fig. 3E). Neither OX1 nor OX1SA were able to rescue the mutant root growth on Murashige and Skoog agar medium (Fig. 3E). However, OX2 and OX1TSAA seedlings exhibited normal root growth compared to the mutant and other transgenic seedlings (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that although both isoforms were expressed in all tissues in the overexpression lines (Fig. 3, B and C), SR45.1 function is more important for flower development while SR45.2 function is more important for root growth. Interestingly, introducing S219A in SR45.1 did not change root growth, but introducing mutations on both T218 and S219 sites in SR45.1 mimicked the SR45.2 function. This indicates that T218 may be most important in distinguishing SR45.1 and SR45.2. Two independent lines were used for each transgene, and expression in both root and floral tissue was verified by examination of GFP, so it is unlikely that the observed differences can be attributed to positional effects of T-DNA insertion. In several animal species, splicing factors have been identified as AS regulation targets during development (CITATION). Similar observations have been obtained in plants as well (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Fifteen of the Arabidopsis SR protein genes are alternatively spliced and their AS patterns change in a developmental and tissue-specific manner (CITATION). In both inflorescence and root tissues, the AS pattern of SRP30, RSP31, RSP31a, SR34, and SRP34b was altered in sr45-1 mutants compared to wild type (CITATION). This suggests that SR45 may directly or indirectly regulate the splicing pattern of these SR protein genes in both root and inflorescence tissues. We examined the AS pattern of these five SR protein genes in wild type, sr45-1, and all transgenic plants. In inflorescence tissues, the ratio of two SRP30 isoforms (isoform5/isoform1) was increased in sr45-1 relative to wild type and this ratio was restored toward wild type in transgenic plants that also show phenotypic rescue (those overexpressing SR45.1GFP or SR45.1-S219A-GFP but not SR45.1-T218A + S219A-GFP or SR45.2-GFP). The AS pattern of RSP31, RSP31a, SR34, and SRP34b was rescued in all transgenic plants (Fig. 4A ). In root tissues, the altered isoform5+3/isoform1 ratio of SRP30 seen in sr45-1 was restored toward wild-type levels in transgenic plants that show phenotypic rescue in the root (those expressing SR45.1-T218A + S219A-GFP or SR45.2-GFP, but not those expressing SR45.1-GFP or SR45.1-S219A-GFP). As for RSP31, the wild-type ratio of isoform 2 to isoform 1 was restored in all transgenic plants except for those overexpressing SR45.1-GFP. The AS pattern of RSP31a and SR34b was rescued in all transgenic plants, but to differing extents (Fig. 4B). These AS profiles suggested that regulation of the AS pattern of SRP30 may be directly associated with the flower petal morphology change and the root growth difference in sr45-1 mutant plants.

!~MM~! All Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants used in this study are in Colombia background. Mutant plants sr45-1 (SALK_004132) were originally from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and were previously described by CITATION. Primers that were used for examining T-DNA insertion in sr45-1 mutants were designed by the T-DNA primer design tool powered by Genome Express Browser Server: 004132LP: ATGGATCGAGCTGTAAGTTGC, 004132RP: GATTGGAGATCTTCTGGGAGG, and LBb1.3: ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC. All plants were either grown in soil with 16/8 h photoperiod or sowed on Murashige and Skoog plates with 1% agar in continuous light treatment at 100 μmol m−2 s−1. For the plants growing in soil, Peter's fertilizer (Griffin Greenhouse & Nursery Supplies, 67–2030) was applied at the concentration of 3 g L−1. All plants were grown at 22°C. SR45 cDNA was amplified from wild-type cDNA and then cloned into pCR2.1 vector from Invitrogen. After sequencing, cDNA clones with isoform 1 (SR45.1; National Center for Biotechnology Information accession NM_101523.3) and isoform 2 (SR45.2; National Center for Biotechnology Information accession NM_202115.2) were identified separately. Digestion sites were added at 5′ and 3′ of the cDNAs by using primers: SR45PstATG: CTGCAGATGGCGAAACCAAGTCGT and SR45 NcoI_3: CCATGGGAGTTTTACGAGGTGGAGGT. About 1.3 kb SR45.1/SR45.2 fragments were then isolated and inserted into KpnI/NcoI sites in an GFP overexpression vector (generated from pND1 and pDN393) maintained in the lab to generate SR45.1/2 cDNAs with C-terminal GFP fusion. 35S∷SR45.1/2-GFP-NOS3' was isolated by NotI and cloned into a binary vector pMLBart. Point mutations were introduced into SR45.1 by QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (STRATAGENE). The primers used for T to A mutation are: SR45T218AF: GGCGCCCAAGAGAGGCATCTCCTCAACGG, and SR45T218AR: CCGTTGAGGAGATGCCTCTCTTGGGCGCC; and the primers used for S to A mutation are: SR45S219AF: CGCCCAAGAGAGACAGCTCCTCAACGGAA, and SR45S219AR: TTCCGTTGAGGAGCTGTCTCTCTTGGGCG. All sequences were confirmed by sequencing. All sequencing was done by Genewiz Inc. SR45 upstream region of 1.6 kb was cloned by PCR with additional restriction enzyme sites added to primers: SR45pro5NotI: GCGGCCGCATTTCTGCTCCAAAATTCTATATAA and SR45pro3BglI: CCGGCCATGGTGGCGAGAGATATCGAGAAAAT. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 vector for sequence confirmation and inserted into vector pRITA I by using NotI and KpnI sites. The region containing SR45 promoter and GUS gene was subcloned into the binary vector pMLBart by using NotI sites. The resulting construct was named SR45∷GUS for examination of SR45 promoter activity by GUS staining. The final binary vectors with SR45.1, SR45.1S219A, SR45.1T218A + S219A, SR45.2, and SR45∷GUS were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GB3101 individually. Then the resulting Agrobacteria were used to transform Arabidopsis plants by flower-dipping methods described before (CITATION). Basta resistance was used for stable transgenic plants selection. At least two independent transgenic lines were selected from each transformation for further analysis. All characterization was done at T3 generation. All constructs except for SR45∷GUS were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts (CITATION) and examined after 24 h. RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate total RNA. Five micrograms of total RNA from each sample was digested by DNase I (Invitrogen) and applied for RT with Superscript II system from Invitrogen. The transcription level of candidate genes was verified by quantitative RT-PCR on Roche LightCycler 480. Roche SYBR green master mix was used to prepare all reactions. GAPDH was used for normalization purpose. Splicing pattern of SR protein genes was examined using gene-specific primers (Supplemental Table S1). All T1 transgenic plants were screened by 1:1,000 diluted Finale. Plants expressing Basta resistance gene from the plasmids were selected and allowed to self in T2 generations. Plants from T3 generation for each transgene were used for all the examinations. Flower petals were picked from plants that already flowered for around 10 d. Pictures were taken from all the petals. Width and length of each petal were measured in ImageJ software. All width-to-length ratios were calculated and plotted using Microsoft Excel. Pictures were taken of 4-d-old seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog agar medium. Root length was measured by ImageJ and plotted in Microsoft Excel. The SR45-GFP signal in nucleus was examined with Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). The excitation wavelength for GFP was 488 nm, and the emission filter wavelength was 505 to 530 nm. Protoplasts incubated in buffer (0.5 mannitol, 4 mm MES, pH 5.7, 20 mm KCl) were directly mounted on a glass slide. Whole seedlings were mounted in water for visualization of the GFP-fusion proteins in root tissues. Digitized images were acquired using a 40× oil-immersion objective at 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution. Each image was scanned four times using LCS510 software. Captured images were exported as TIFF format files and further processed in Adobe Photoshop. Three to five independent transgenic lines were examined for GUS activity. Plant tissues were fixed in 80% acetone on ice for 30 min, washed in GUS staining solution (0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), then submerged in GUS staining solution with 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-GlcU A. For inflorescences, trapped air was removed by pulling a vacuum for 5 min followed by releasing vacuum. The process was repeated until the flowers were completely submerged. All tissues were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Chlorophyll was removed by replacing the stain solution with 70% ethanol several times until the green color disappeared and blue GUS stain was clearly visible. Photographs of the stained tissues were taken by a Nikon stereoscopic zoom microscope SMZ1000 or with differential interference contrast using a Nikon E600 microscope.
