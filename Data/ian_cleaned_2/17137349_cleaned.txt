!~ABS~! The interactions of ATP inside plant mitochondria were investigated by identifying the soluble nucleotide binding proteome captured using immobilized ATP. Selected proteins were separated by 1D SDS-PAGE and 2D IEF-SDS-PAGE and identified by ESI−Q-TOF MS/MS. A range of highly enriched proteins were identified from the mitochondrial proteome, including 14-3-3 proteins and RNA binding proteins, as well as proteins known to contain nucleotide binding domains and/or to be inhibited or stimulated by ATP.

!~RES~! Total soluble protein samples from purified mitochondrial samples (1 mg protein) were incubated with 15 mg of ATP− acrylamide gel (ProteoEnrich ATP Binders, Novagen) in binding buffer, and following this, a series of wash steps under high-salt concentration (150 mM NaCl) removed the unbound protein samples by successive centrifugation of the resin, removal of the supernatant, and refreshing of the wash buffer. Supernatants of samples treated in this fashion and separated by SDS-PAGE are shown in Figure 1CITATION, with successive dilution of the protein content through each wash step (1−3). The binding and wash buffers contained 1 mM AMP, 1 mM ADP, and 1 mM NADH to reduce binding of non-ATP-binding proteins to the resin during the binding and washing steps. Finally, the resin was resuspended in an elution buffer containing 20 mM ATP. Inclusion of ATP lead to displacement of substantial amounts of proteins from the resin that were visualized as a complex set of proteins by SDS-PAGE. These proteins had a distinct banding pattern compared to the total soluble protein and the unbound/flow-through samples. Approximately 2.5% of the protein initially incubated with the resin was collected in the ATP-eluted sample (∼25 μg from 1 mg total protein). [[FIGURE]]  To determine if ADP, AMP, and NADH were displacing specific proteins during the binding and elution phase, we conducted a series of experiments without these reagents in the wash buffer (Figure 2CITATION). Samples A−D were bound to ATP acrylamide and washed three times in the absence of any nucleotides. After this third wash, the supernatants were concentrated and separated by SDS-PAGE to reveal low levels of proteins in the wash solutions. Addition of 20 mM NADH, AMP, or ADP to samples A−C, respectively, yielded only a low amount and a small number of protein bands in the supernatants after incubation and centrifugation. The sample with ADP provides the only pattern distinct from the wash steps, with two bands above the 66 kDa marker and a prominent band at ∼50 kDa, and weaker bands at 30 and 22 kDa (the higher bands were successfully analyzed by LC−MS/MS and identified as the heat shock protein 70 proteins At4g24280 and At4g37910 and the alanine aminotransferase At1g17290, see supplementary data 1 in Supporting Information). In contrast, 20 mM ATP elution from sample D yielded an abundant complex sample. Sample E was treated as Figure 1 with 1 mM NADH, AMP, and ADP present in all the binding and wash steps and final elution with ATP. No significant difference was seen in the banding patterns between the final samples in D and E on SDS-PAGE gels. [[FIGURE]]  With samples prepared in the manner shown in Figure 2, lane E, a series of 24 regions from a Coomassie-stained gel were cut from 12% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel separations (Figure 3CITATIONA). These were in-gel-digested with trypsin and prepared for LC−MS/MS analysis. In addition, a different γ phosphate-tethered media was tested based on a 10-mer flexible linker to sepharose (Jena Bioscience). ATP displacement of proteins from the 13-mer linker acrylamide and 10-mer linker sepharose media were compared on 4−15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient gels (Figure 3B) to maximize the separation of proteins in the complex region noted between 50 and 100 kDa seen in Figure 3A. A broad degree of similarity in the protein banding pattern was observed when ATP eluates from the two media were compared (Figure 3B). But there were several differences around the 43 and 30 kDa marker points, as well as differences in the abundance of specific protein bands (Figure 3B). A selection of 24 protein regions from the gel of the ATP−acrylamide samples and 21 protein regions from the gel of the ATP−sepharose samples were excised and digested in-gel with trypsin and prepared for LC−MS/MS analysis. [[FIGURE]]  To further explore the complex nature of the ATP eluate fractions, IEF/SDS-PAGE gels were performed to compare 250 μg of total soluble protein sample before affinity chromatography with 75 μg of ATP−acrylamide-bound fraction protein (Figure 4CITATION). Spot abundance was compared between gels to locate proteins that were differentially abundant in the ATP-eluted sample, and proteins that were near equally abundant in both samples. This process was repeated five times on separate gels from independent ATP elutions from different mitochondrial preparations (supplementary data 3 in Supporting Information). In total, 53 spots were selected from single spot excision and in-gel digestion followed by LC−MS/MS from selected gels; in 53 spots, 54 proteins were identified with confidence. Of these, 34 proteins were highly enriched in the ATP-eluted sample (Table 1CITATION) and 20 were abundant proteins in the ATP-eluted samples but were in overlapping positions with major proteins in the total soluble proteome (Table 2CITATION). The functional significance of these two groups is explored in more detail below. Because of the very different protein patterns on the soluble and ATP eluate gels, it was not possible to use standard 2D gel comparison tools that rely on largely similar protein patterns with a small number of changes. Instead, manual matching was performed, and spots were assigned to the two groups based on abundance being >3-fold higher in the ATP eluate compared to total soluble protein (Table 1). This was defined as greater than near equal abundance when 250 μg of total protein was compared to 75 μg of ATP-purified protein. Some of these proteins were greater than 20−30-fold higher in abundance in the ATP eluate gels. The remainder were abundant in the ATP eluate but also present in the total soluble protein set at equal or greater amounts (Table 2). More minor spots on the ATP-eluted gels that overlapped with major regions of abundant protein in the soluble protein gels were not analyzed. [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]]  Table 1 contains the LC−MS/MS identifications of proteins enriched on 2D gels (>3-fold) and shows the presence or absence of these same proteins in the 1D ATP−polyacryamide and ATP−sepharose gel analyses. Of the 34 proteins in this group, 18 were identified using both media on 1D gels and were enriched on the 2D separations, while the remainder were found in at least one of the 1D gel separations and the 2D gel separations. These identified proteins represent a distinct set of functional categories including a high proportion of heat shock proteins. Only 12 of the 34 had been previously found on gel-based separations and analysis of mitochondrial proteins from Arabidopsis, while a further 9 had been found in the proteome but only in nongel complex mixture LC−MS/MS analysis (Table 1). A final 12 were new identifications not previously made by proteomic analysis of mitochondria. The 9 previously found only by LC−MS/MS include RNA binding proteins, the LON protease, and several Fe−S biogenesis proteins, all low-abundance proteins that have been selectively enriched by the affinity chromatography. Remarkably, in some cases, these were abundant Coomassie-stained protein spots in 25−75 μg of protein of the ATP eluate samples (Figure 4 and supplementary data 3 in Supporting Information). Of the 12 new identifications, two notable ones have previously been claimed to be Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins on the basis of GFP-fusion expression and co-localization with mitochondria in vivo. These are an RRM containing RNA binding protein (At1g74230)CITATION and a glycolate dehydrogenase (At5g06580).CITATION The identification of an unknown protein (At3g52570.1) marks the first time this has been found in plant mitochondria. It has not been reported to have been identified in any other mass spectrometry analysis in Arabidopsis (www.suba.bcs.uwa.edu.au). Bioinformatic analysis shows it is predicted to localize to the mitochondria by several subcellular prediction programs including Predotar, TargetP, Mitoprot2, and iPSORT. It contains esterase and hydrolyase interpro domains (IPR000379, IPR000073), but it is not closely related to a known function protein. It is only known from three ESTs, making it the product of a rare transcript in Arabidopsis.  Table 2 contains the LC−MS identifications of major proteins found on 2D gels that eluted off ATP affinity media by ATP (Figures 1, 2, and 4), but also appear to be significantly abundant proteins in the soluble proteome (Figure 4). Placement of proteins in Table 2 versus Table 1 was determined by both their comigration with major proteins in Figure 4 and their known abundance from previous proteome studies.16-18 The presence or absence of these same proteins in the 1D ATP−polyacryamide and ATP−sepharose gel analyses are also shown. Of the 20 proteins in this group, all are previously known from MS studies of mitochondria. Further HSPs are found that complete the set of mitochondrial HSPs found in Table 1. Spot 33 from Figure 4 could not be identified with significant matches and is not included in Table 2. 
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Suspension Cell Cultures. A heterotrophic Arabidopsis cell culture, established from callus of cv Erecta stem explants, has been maintained for over 14 years by weekly subculture into Murashige and Skoog basal medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.5 mg/L naphthaleneacetic acid, and 0.05 mg/L kinetin, pH 5.8.CITATION The cell cultures were maintained in Arabidopsis suspension cell culture medium in the dark at 22 °C in an orbital shaker (150 rpm). At 6 to 7 d, each flask (120 mL) contained 18−20 g of fresh weight of cells, and growth was approximately in the middle of the log phase. Subculture of 20 mL of culture to 100 mL of fresh medium began the cycle again.16  Mitochondrial Isolation. A total of 1.0−1.2 L of 7-d cell culture was filtered through Miracloth to remove media, and cells were then ruptured in a Waring blender. Blending of each 90−100 g aliquot was performed in 300 mL of grinding medium (0.3 M mannitol, 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 2 mM EGTA, and 20 mM cysteine, pH 8.0). Filtered cell extract was separated by centrifugation at 1500g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 24 000g for 15 min. The resultant organelle pellet was washed by repeating the 1500 and 24 000g centrifugation steps at 4 °C in mannitol wash medium (0.3 M mannitol, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 10 mM TES (N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid)-NaOH, pH 7.5). The final organelle pellet was resuspended in wash medium and loaded onto a Percoll step gradient consisting of 1:5:1 ratio, bottom to top, of 40% Percoll:25% Percoll:18% Percoll in mannitol wash medium. The gradients were centrifuged for 45 min at 40 000g and 4 °C with centrifuge brake off, and mitochondria were present as an opaque band at the 25%:40% interface. This band was aspirated, concentrated, and washed by centrifugation at 24 000g and 4 °C for 15 min and was then loaded onto a self-forming Percoll gradient containing 35% Percoll in sucrose wash medium (0.3 M sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 10 mM TES-NaOH, pH 7.5). After centrifugation at 40 000g and 4 °C for 45 min with centrifuge brake off, mitochondria formed a band near the top of the gradient, and peroxisomal material banded near the bottom of the gradient. The mitochondrial band was aspirated and again washed and concentrated by two centrifugation steps at 24 000g and 4 °C for 15 min in sucrose wash medium (containing no BSA). This protocol is a slight variation on the one used by Millar et al.16 Purified mitochondrial proteins were quantified using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the protein standard. Mitochondrial proteins were immediately transferred as 500 μg aliquots into sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at −80 °C.  Preparation of ATP−Acylamide Resin and Affinity Chromatography. Fifteen milligrams of γ-aminotridecyl−ATP−acylamide resin (ATP-Binders Resin, Novagen) was weighed out and placed in a microcentrifuge tube. A volume of 1.2 mL of conditioning buffer (1.7% Tween-20 and 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) was added to the resin and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. The resin was incubated at 4 °C overnight, and the buffer was decanted using a pipet after pelleting the resin at 5000g for 2 min. Following this, the resin was washed twice by brief vortexing in 1.5 mL of deionized water and pelleted at 5000g for 2 min, and the water was decanted from the resin. The resin was then left to equilibrate in 1.5 mL of wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 60 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM AMP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM NADH, 0.2 mM activated sodium vanadate, 15 μL of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Novagen), and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) for several minutes. After pelleting the resin at 5000g for 2 min and decanting the wash buffer from the resin, the lid of the Eppendorf tube was kept closed to prevent the resin from drying out. Three to four milligrams of mitochondria were freeze−thawed three times in liquid nitrogen to break apart mitochondrial membranes and release soluble proteins. Pelleting membranous material at 20 000g for 20 min at 4 °C retained approximately 1−2 mg of mitochondrial soluble proteins in the supernatant, which was then transferred to a separate Eppendorf tube. One volume of binding buffer (150 mM NaCl, 300 mM MgCl2, 12.5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 125 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) was added to 4 vol of protein sample; to this was added a nucleotide mixture to final concentrations of 1 mM AMP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM NADH, pH 7.0, dithiothreitol to 1 mM, and 1/100 dilution of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Novagen). The sample mixture was then transferred to the equilibrated resin and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle orbital rotation. The sample/resin mixture was transferred to the sample cup of a spin filter and spun at 5000g for 2 min, and the flow-through proteins were transferred to a fresh tube. Three successive washes of the resin with 1 mL of wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 60 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM AMP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM NADH, 0.2 mM activated sodium vanadate, 10 μL of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) removed non-ATP-binding proteins. After washing the resin, 150 μL of ice-cold elution buffer (20 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM AMP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM NADH, 0.2 mM activated sodium vanadate, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 μL of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) was added to the resin and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle orbital rotation. The eluted protein fractions were collected by spin filtration at 5000g at 4 °C for 2 min, and the elution steps repeated 2 more times. Soluble mitochondrial protein samples eluted with NADH-, AMP-, ADP-, or ATP-only buffers were subjected to binding and washing steps as described above, except no AMP, ADP, or NADH were added to the binding and wash buffers, nor to the resin during the equilibration step. Elution steps for NADH-, AMP-, ADP-, and ATP-only samples were the same as described above, but the elution buffers for NADH-, AMP-, ADP-, and ATP-only samples consisted of 20 mM NADH, AMP, ADP, or ATP, respectively, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM activated sodium vanadate, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1/100 dilution of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Novagen), and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 per sample. Eluted proteins were desalted and concentrated by using Ultrafree centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) and quantified using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce).  Preparation of γ-Aminooctyl−ATP−Sepharose Resin and Affinity Chromatography. Pretreatment of γ-aminooctyl−ATP−sepharose resin (Jena Bioscience) prior to adding of protein sample was carried out by pipetting 500 μL of resin into a microcentrifuge tube, spinning it at 5000g for 2 min and decanting the 20% ethanol storage buffer from the resin using a pipet. One milliliter of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, was added to the resin and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. Binding, washing, and eluting of ATP binding proteins was performed in the same manner and using the same solutions noted above in the ATP-only experiments without NADH, AMP, and ADP in buffers.  SDS-PAGE and 2D Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE Gels. SDS-PAGE gels used where 4% acrylamide stacking gels above 12% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, or 5−16%(w/v) acrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS in a large gel format (0.1 cm × 16 cm × 16 cm) and were run with Tris−glycine buffering systems. Gel electrophoresis was performed at 25 mA per gel and completed in 3 h. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) sample buffer consisted of 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) ampholytes (pH 3−10), 2 mM tributylphosphine, and 0.001% (w/v) bromophenol blue. Aliquots of 330 μL were used to re-swell dried 180 mm, pH 3−10 nonlinear IPG strips (Immobiline DryStrips, APBiotech, Sydney) overnight, and then IEF was performed for 19.5 h reaching a total of 49 kVh at 20 °C on a flat-bed electrophoresis unit (Multiphor II, APBiotech, Sydney). IPG strips were then transferred to an equilibration buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4 M urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.001% (w/v) bromophenol blue, and 100 mM β-mecaptoethanol and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with rocking. The equilibrated strips were then slotted into central single wells of 4% acrylamide stacking gels above 0.1 cm × 18.5 cm × 20 cm, 12% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gel electrophoresis was performed at 100 V with circulating cooling (10 °C) and completed in 5 h. Five independent 2D gels were run, one each for 5 different ATP affinity traps each from a separate mitochondrial isolation.  Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (Q-TOF MS). Selected proteins were selected from the gel, washed, and in-gel-digested overnight at 37 °C according to Sweetlove et al.CITATION Peptides were extracted from the overnight digests by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile and shaking for 15 min at 8000 rpm on an orbital shaker. The solution was removed from the gel pieces, 10−20 μL of a 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid solution was added, and the shaking procedure was repeated. The solution was again removed and pooled, and the last step was repeated. Solvent was evaporated from each sample using a speedvac (Thermo Savant) for 20−30 min until nearly dried. Samples were hydrated in 16 μL of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Samples were analyzed using an Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system and an Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar i LC/MS/MS system equipped with the IonSpray source running Analyst QS software (v1.0 SP8) with the instrument in positive ion mode. Each extracted peptide sample was loaded in turn with the Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system onto a 0.5 × 50 mm clipeus 5 μm C18 reverse-phase column (Higgins Analytical) with a C18 OPTI-GUARD guard column (Optimize Technologies) at 16 μL/min equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were eluted from the C18 reverse-phase column into the QSTAR Pulsar i by a 7 min acetonitrile gradient (5%−80%) at 16 μL/min under constant formic acid concentrations of 0.1%. During the period of ion detection, eluted peptides were analyzed by the mass spectrometer at 8 μL/min. The total analysis time for each sample was 23 min. The method used to analyze eluted ions employs the Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) capabilities of Analyst QS and the rolling collision energy feature for automated collision energy determination based on the ions m/z (Sciex/AB). The method employed a 1 s TOF MS scan which automatically switched (using IDA) to a 2 s Product Ion scan (MS/MS) when a target ion reached an intensity of greater that 30 counts and its charge state was identified as 2+, 3+, or 4+. TOF MS scanning was undertaken on an m/z range of 400−1600 m/z using a Q2 transmission window of 380 amu (100%). Product Ion scans were undertaken at m/z ranges of 70−2000 m/z at low resolution utilizing Q2 transmission windows of 50 (33%), 190 (33%), and 650 amu (34%). Data produced by this method were used for searching the Mascot search engine (Matrix Sciences) for protein identifications. The collision-induced disassociation data (CID) from each sample were exported from Analyst QS using a purpose built script obtained from Matrix Sciences. The script was set up to centroid the survey scan ions (TOF MS) at a height percentage of 50% and a merge distance of 0.1 amu (for charge state determination), centroid MS/MS data at a height percentage of 50% and a merge distance of 2 amu, reject a CID if less than 10 peaks, and discard ions with charge equal and greater than 5+. Search parameters at Mascot employed a peptide tolerance of ±1.2 Da and MS/MS tolerance of ±0.6 Da, no variable modifications, and allow up to 1 miscleavage for trypsin digest, and the instrument type was set to ESI-QUAD-TOF. Searches were performed against a custom database of all Arabidopsis proteins, TAIR 6 release (30 700 sequences; 12 656 682 residues).
