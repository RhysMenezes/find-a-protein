!~ABS~! Chromatin is a major determinant in the regulation of virtually all DNA-dependent processes. Chromatin architectural proteins interact with nucleosomes to modulate chromatin accessibility and higher-order chromatin structure. The evolutionarily conserved DEK domain-containing protein is implicated in important chromatin-related processes in animals, but little is known about its DNA targets and protein interaction partners. In plants, the role of DEK has remained elusive. In this work, we identified DEK3 as a chromatin-associated protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. DEK3 specifically binds histones H3 and H4. Purification of other proteins associated with nuclear DEK3 also established DNA topoisomerase 1α and proteins of the cohesion complex as in vivo interaction partners. Genome-wide mapping of DEK3 binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing revealed enrichment of DEK3 at protein-coding genes throughout the genome. Using DEK3 knockout and overexpressor lines, we show that DEK3 affects nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility and modulates the expression of DEK3 target genes. Furthermore, functional levels of DEK3 are crucial for stress tolerance. Overall, data indicate that DEK3 contributes to modulation of Arabidopsis chromatin structure and function.
!~RES~! Human DEK protein harbors two DNA binding domains: the SAP (Scaffold attachment factor A/B-Acinus-Pias) box, a DNA binding motif present in a number of chromatin-associated proteins, and the C-terminal DEK domain (CITATION). Both domains are conserved in At-DEK3. To identify the SAP box in At-DEK3, the protein was aligned together with human DEK and two published SAP box consensus sequences (CITATION; CITATION). Like human DEK, At-DEK3 contains a centrally located SAP box consisting of a bipartite region of conserved hydrophobic, aliphatic, and acidic residues (Figure 1A). To identify the DEK domain in At-DEK3, we first aligned all 606 entries of proteins annotated with a putative DEK domain in the Pfam protein database (CITATION) and identified a putative consensus sequence for the DEK domain (Figure 1A). Similar to Hs-DEK, the DEK domain is located at the C terminus of At-DEK3. [[FIGURE]] DEK is ubiquitously and highly expressed in rapidly proliferating animal cells (CITATION; CITATION). In line with a role of At-DEK3 in dividing cells, DEK3 was highly expressed in young Arabidopsis seedlings (Supplemental Figure 1A). To study the subcellular localization of DEK3, localization of a DEK3-CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) fusion protein was first investigated in transiently transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. CFP fluorescence was exclusively detected in the nucleus (Supplemental Figure 1B). Consistent with the transient expression data, nuclear fluorescence was also observed in Arabidopsis plants stably transformed with a DEK3-CFP fusion and observed fluorescence in nuclei (Figure 1B). To confirm this subcellular localization, we performed protein gel blot analysis with total protein, cytosolic, and nuclear extracts. Consistent with the microscopic analyses, DEK3 protein was detected in total and nuclear, but not in cytosolic protein extracts (Figure 1C). Hs-DEK and Dm-DEK proteins interact with histones (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To analyze whether At-DEK3 shares this feature, we performed far-Western blot analyses. Membranes with electrophoretically separated core histones were incubated with purified, recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DEK3 protein and subsequently with GST antibodies. At-DEK3 interacted specifically with histones H3 and H4 (Figure 2A); no signal was observed for histones H2A and H2B. [[FIGURE]] To investigate whether DEK3 interacts with core histones in planta, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. DEK3 was immunoprecipitated with green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies from nuclear extracts of seedlings expressing DEK3-CFP. Subsequently, protein gel blot analysis was performed using antibodies against the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. In line with the in vitro binding assays, DEK3 coimmunoprecipitated in vivo only with histones H3 and H4 (Figure 2B). To investigate the role of DEK3 in the nucleus, we identified proteins associated with DEK3 using immunoaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. Nuclear extracts from 2-week-old soil-grown plants expressing DEK3-CFP were used to purify DEK3-associated proteins with GFP antibodies. Wild-type plants were used as control. The analysis was repeated three times with independently grown plant material. Proteins that were identified in at least two coprecipitation analyses from DEK3-CFP nuclear extracts but not in any of the wild-type samples were considered to be DEK3 copurifying factors. We identified 17 proteins that consistently coimmunoprecipitated with DEK3 (Table 1). Many of the DEK3-associated proteins are involved in DNA-dependent processes. DNA topoisomerase 1α (Top1α; CITATION) copurified in all three experiments with DEK3. Top1α is a type I DNA topoisomerase involved in DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription (CITATION; CITATION), and Arabidopsis Top1α is involved in development (CITATION; CITATION). Among the other proteins copurifying with DEK3 were the cohesion protein SCC3 involved in mitotic and meiotic cell division (CITATION; CITATION) and a putative homolog of the cohesion-associated protein PDS5. Nitrilase1, a multifunctional protein implicated in cytokinesis and in maintaining genome stability (CITATION), was also identified in all experiments. Further, histone deacetylase 3 (HDA3/HDT1) copurified with DEK3, confirming a similar interaction observed in human cells (CITATION). DEK3-associated proteins also comprised two yet uncharacterized proteins with a PWWP domain, a structural module characteristic of chromatin regulators, two DNA binding storekeeper protein-related transcriptional regulators of unknown biological function and Short Life 1, a putative transcription factor with a PHD finger, and a BAH motif involved in developmental regulation (CITATION). We also identified DEK4, indicating that DEK3 might form heterodimers with DEK4. Furthermore, DEK3 pulled down an F-box protein, which is interesting because in mice, DEK protein levels can be regulated by the F-box protein FBXW7 (CITATION). Two other copurified proteins involved in plant stress tolerance are discussed below. To validate the quality of the DEK3 coimmunopurification analyses, we selected At-SSC3 for which specific antibodies are available (CITATION) and performed inverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments. After immunoprecipitating nuclear protein extracts of wild-type and DEK3-CFP-expressing plants with the SCC3 antibodies and protein gel blot analysis with GFP antibodies (Figure 3A), we could demonstrate that DEK3-CFP copurified with SCC3, confirming that both proteins are associated in vivo. [[FIGURE]] Intriguingly, Top1α was found to be associated with DEK3. TopI enzymes are essential for relaxing DNA supercoiling generated by transcription, replication, and chromatin remodeling (CITATION; CITATION). Hs-DEK protein has DNA supercoiling activity in vitro in the presence of TopI (CITATION; CITATION). This prompted us to investigate whether At-DEK3 possesses supercoiling activity. Indeed, purified recombinant DEK3 enhanced the production of supercoiled DNA in the presence of TopI (Figure 3B). Thus, the in vivo association of DEK3 with Top1α, together with the ability of DEK3 to change DNA structure in vitro, suggest that DEK3 might have the potential to modulate DNA topology in planta. The ability of DEK3 to bind histones and to change the superhelical structure of DNA in vitro and the copurification of DEK3 with proteins involved in chromatin-related processes from plants prompted us to investigate the global distribution of DEK3 along the genome. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitations using GFP antibodies followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) with three independent transgenic DEK3-CFP plant lines. Reads were mapped uniquely to the Arabidopsis genome (Supplemental Table 1). To identify DEK3 DNA binding sites, we determined peaks shared by the three independent DEK3-CFP plant lines. Though there was variability between the three independent transgenic lines, we identified 577 DEK3-associated sequences corresponding to 161 genes distributed all over the five chromosomes (Supplemental Figure 2 and Supplemental Data Set 1). Interestingly, for all genes, DEK3 was enriched at least at three different sites within the gene. Gene Ontology term classification of genes enriched for DEK3 binding indicated that DEK3 target genes are involved in diverse biological processes. The majority of DEK3 binding sites located at protein-coding genes (79%). Thirty-four percent of the DEK3 binding sites were found in exons and 19% in introns (Figure 4A), which is similar to the fractions of genomic regions in the Arabidopsis genome (31% exons and 18% introns; CITATION). However, the number of DEK3 peaks was increased in 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (12%) and 3′ UTRs (14%) and decreased in intergenic regions (21%) compared with the genome-wide fractions of 4, 2, and 45%, respectively. We next investigated the enrichment profile of DEK3 over protein-coding gene regions and their flanking 5′ and 3′ sequences (Figure 4B). DEK3 was enriched over gene bodies and the binding signal further increased in a 2-kb region upstream of the translational start site (ATG) and in a 1-kb region downstream of the translational termination site (stop codon). [[FIGURE]] To validate the ChIP-Seq analysis, we performed ChIP-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analyses from three independent immunoprecipitations of three independent DEK3-CFP lines. We selected DEK3 itself, Top1α, and PDS5 as genes encoding DEK3-interacting proteins and three additional gene loci binding DEK3 at the DNA level (MBD9, Methyl-CpG binding domain 9; HKL1, Hexokinase-like 1; EFS, Early Flowering in Short Days). All but one of 29 tested regions were confirmed to be enriched for DEK3 in at least two of the three lines (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure 3), whereas no enrichment was detected in wild-type control plants for DEK3-CFP (Supplemental Figure 4), verifying a low false positive rate for the ChIP-Seq procedure. [[FIGURE]] We hypothesized that the enrichment of DEK3 at protein-coding genes might influence the expression of these genes. To test this, we analyzed the transcript levels of selected DEK3 targets in wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0), dek3 knockout mutants (Supplemental Figures 1C and 1D), and in plants overexpressing DEK3-CFP (Supplemental Figures 1D and 1E) by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis (Figure 6). In dek3 mutants, expression levels of Top1α, EFS, MBD9, NUP160 (Nucleoporin 160), DEK1 (Defective kernel 1), auxin transport protein BIG (also known as ASA1; Attenuated shade avoidance 1), HB-1 (Homeobox 1), and CMT3 (Chromomethylase 3) were elevated to different extents, whereas in DEK3 overexpressors, transcript levels were reduced compared with wild-type plants. We observed that transcript levels of HKL1 and PDS5 were reduced in dek3 and in DEK3-overexpressing plants, suggesting that DEK3 might regulate gene expression indirectly or in a locus-specific manner. [[FIGURE]] The observations that DEK3 binds to chromatin and that levels of DEK3 influence gene expression in Arabidopsis plants raised the question whether DEK3 might be involved in regulating DNA accessibility. Therefore, we first investigated histone H3 occupancy at the Top1α and the MBD9 loci by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using histone H3 antibodies. In plants with elevated DEK3 levels, histone H3 occupancy was strongly increased throughout the Top1α gene region, whereas H3 occupancy was similar or lower in plants deficient in DEK3 (Figure 7A). Similarly, histone H3 occupancy was enhanced throughout the MBD9 locus in DEK3 overexpressing but reduced in dek3 plants (Supplemental Figure 5A), suggesting that nucleosome density can be modified by DEK3 levels. [[FIGURE]] We also assessed nucleosome density by a nuclease sensitivity-based assay. We digested nuclei from wild-type Col-0 and plants deficient for or overexpressing DEK3 with MNase I (which preferentially digests naked DNA), isolated mononucleosomal DNA, and analyzed the Top1α and the MBD9 gene regions by quantitative PCR (qPCR). In line with the histone H3 ChIP data, markedly more PCR product was detected at each of the tested sites of the Top1α and the MBD9 loci in DEK3 overexpressor lines, and lower levels were amplified in dek3 compared with the wild type (Figure 7B; Supplemental Figure 5B), suggesting that DEK3 promotes nucleosome density. To further confirm the influence of DEK3 on DNA accessibility, we performed CHART-PCR (chromatin accessibility by real-time PCR) and digested nuclei from Col-0, dek3, and DEK3 overexpressor plants with MNase I followed by qPCR analysis of different regions of the Top1α and the MBD9 locus. Consistent with the previous analyses, we observed a strongly increased MNase accessibility in DEK3-deficient plants, whereas MNase accessibility was reduced in DEK3 overexpressor plants (Figure 7C; Supplemental Figure 5C). At control regions, histone H3 occupancy, nucleosome density, and DNA accessibility were generally similar in wild-type, DEK3 overexpressor, and knockout mutants (Supplemental Figure 6). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that DEK3 can modulate nucleosome occupancy and has the potential to alter chromatin accessibility. Among the proteins associated with DEK3, we identified a salt tolerance-related protein (CITATION) and the stress-induced COLD-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN 6.6 (COR6.6)/KIN2 (CITATION; CITATION). This prompted us to investigate whether DEK3 might be involved in the Arabidopsis stress response. First, we analyzed the expression of DEK3 in plants exposed to high salinity, a major stress for plants. RT-qPCR analysis showed that DEK3 expression was strongly and rapidly downregulated by salt stress in shoots and roots (Figure 8A). [[FIGURE]] We next analyzed whether DEK3 is important for tolerance to salt stress. Under high salinity conditions, plants deficient in DEK3 germinated significantly better compared with wild-type plants. In contrast, germination efficiency under the same conditions was significantly reduced in plants overexpressing DEK3 (Figure 8B). Overexpression of DEK3-CFP in dek3 mutant background reverted the dek3 stress tolerance phenotype (Figure 8B). Furthermore, dek3 seedlings transferred from normal to high salinity conditions were hypersensitive to salt stress (Figure 8E), indicating that DEK3 levels are critical for salt stress tolerance. Given that Top1α copurified with DEK3, and DEK3 levels regulate the expression of Top1α, we asked whether Top1α plays a role in salt stress tolerance. Indeed, Top1α transcript levels were strongly reduced in roots and leaves after short-term salt stress (Figure 8C). Also, top1α mutants (Supplemental Figures 7A and 7B) were significantly more resistant to high salinity conditions (Figure 8D) compared with the wild type. These results indicate that DEK3 and Top1α are negative regulators of salt stress tolerance and play a role in the same biological process. Additionally, dek3 top1α double knockout plants showed a similar sensitivity to salt as single top1α mutants (Figure 8E), suggesting that DEK3 and Top1α are part of the same pathway.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefa). After 10 d, seedlings were transferred to soil and cultivated in a 16-h-light/8-h-dark regime at 150 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity and 60% relative humidity. For germination assays under high salt conditions, seeds were germinated on half-strength MS or half-strength MS supplemented with 200 mM NaCl. For gene expression analysis, seedlings grown on a mesh on liquid half-strength MS medium were transferred to either half-strength MS (control) or to medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 h. Seeds used for one experiment were obtained from parental plants propagated in the same growth chamber at the same time. The dek3 mutants (dek3-1, SALK_054095.55.75.x; dek3-2, SALK_112581.46.05.x) were genotyped using primers AtDEK3_fw0 and AtDEK3_rev5, as well as AtDEK3_fw6 and AtDEK3_rev6 (Supplemental Table 2). The top1α mutant (SALK_112625.35.05.x) was genotyped using the primers Top1α_fw3 and Top1α_rev3 (Supplemental Table 2). The coding DNA sequence (CDS) of DEK3 was amplified by PCR using the primers AtDEK3_IF_fw and AtDEK3_IF_rev (Supplemental Table 2) and cloned with In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning kit (#639638; Clontech) into the binary vector pGreenII0029 under the control of the 35S promoter. A CFP tag was cloned into the NotI site downstream of the coding sequence. Constructs were verified by sequencing. Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed using the floral dip method (CITATION). Total RNA was isolated from plant material using TRI Reagent (#9424; Sigma-Aldrich) and treated with RNase-free DNase (#EN0525; Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For RT-qPCR, first-strand cDNA synthesis from 1 μg of total RNA was done using RevertAid H Minus First Stand cDNA Synthesis Kit (#K1632; Thermo Scientific). One microliter of cDNA was used for real-time PCR reactions using Sso Advanced (#172-5262; Bio-Rad) on an iQ5 multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). All experiments were performed three times with independent RNA samples under the following cycling conditions: a 95°C hold for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Nonspecific PCR products were identified by dissociation curves. Relative expression values were calculated with the iQ5 Optical System Software 2.0 (Bio-Rad) according to CITATION. Primer efficiencies were calculated by relative standard curves. PP2A and Ubiquitin were used as normalization controls. Normalized gene expression was represented relative to wild-type controls. The primers were designed based on the 3′ UTR for DEK3 and Top1α (Supplemental Table 2). The coding sequence of DEK3 was amplified from cDNA by PCR using the primers AtDEK3_IF_fw and AtDEK3_IF_rev (Supplemental Table 2) and cloned with In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning kit (#639650; Clontech) into pGEX-6P-1. Recombinant protein was expressed as GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus strain. Proteins were purified using the Sepharose beads affinity method (Glutathione Sepharose 4B, #17-0756-01; GE Healthcare). Total proteins from Arabidopsis leaves or seedlings were extracted using Laemmli extraction buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol). Cytosolic extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/mL leupeptin hemisulfate, 2 μg/mL pepstatin A, and 2 μg/mL aprotinin; all Sigma-Aldrich) was used to extract cytosolic proteins from Arabidopsis leaves or seedlings. Nuclear fractions for coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were extracted as described for chromatin immunoprecipitation except that the material was not sheared. Protein concentration was assessed using Bradford method. Membranes were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of GFP antibodies (#11814460001; Roche), 1:3000 dilution H2A antibodies (#ab13923; abcam), H2B antibodies (#ab1790; abcam), H3 antibodies (#ab1791; abcam), H4 antibodies (#ab10158; abcam), or 1:1.1000 dilution of nitrate reductase antibodies (#AS08 310; Agrisera). Goat IRDye 800CW anti-mouse (#926-32210; LI-COR) or goat IRDye 800 CW anti-rabbit (#926-32211; LI-COR) was used (1:20,000) as secondary antibodies for GFP, histone, or nitrate reductase primary antibodies. The signals were detected using the Odyssey Imagine System (LI-COR). Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 transformed with the DEK3-CFP construct was grown for 2 d at 28°C in 5 mL Luria-Bertani (LB). The preculture was used to inoculate 25 mL LB and incubated for 4 h at 28°C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 30 mL LB supplemented with 100 μM acetosyringone. After 2 h, cells were resuspended in 30 mL of 5% sucrose and infiltrated in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. Subcellular localization was examined 4 d after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 710 Zeiss spectral confocal microscope). Ten micrograms of core histones (#10223565001; Roche) was separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. Renaturation of the histones was done in PBST-0.05% Tween 20 (PBST-T) for 2 h at room temperature, and the membrane was blocked in PBS-BSA (PBS, 2% BSA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with recombinant GST-DEK3 or GST alone (100 ng/cm2) in PBS-BSA for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, DEK3 binding was detected using GST antibodies (#27-4577-01; GE Healthcare), and donkey IRDye 680 anti-goat (#926-32224; LI-COR) was used (1:20,000) as secondary antibody. The signals were detected using the Odyssey Imagine System (LI-COR). Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were cross-linked with 1% (w/v) formaldehyde in buffer MC (10 mM KPO4, pH 7, 50 mM NaCl, and 100 mM sucrose) for 30 min. Formaldehyde was quenched for 15 min by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. Seedlings were washed twice with MC buffer and ground in liquid nitrogen. Five grams of ground powder was resuspended in 30 mL extraction buffer (2.5% [w/v] Ficoll 400, 5% [w/v] Dextran T40, 400 mM sucrose, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mM MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitor mix [1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/mL pepstatin A, 1 μg/mL leupeptin hemisulfate, 1 μg/mL aprotinin, 2.5 μg/mL trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E64), 2 mM EGTA, and 1 μL/mL β-mercaptoethanol; all Sigma-Aldrich] and incubated for 30 min on ice. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth and 0.5% Triton X-100 was added. After 15 min on ice, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 mL extraction buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were again pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL extraction buffer. Nuclei pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 0.5% SDS and protease inhibitors and incubated for 30 min at 4°C on the turning wheel. Chromatin was sheared with a Bioruptor (high intensity, 60 min, 30-s/30-s intervals) to an average size less than 500 bp, as verified on a 1.5% agarose gel. Precleared extracts from 500 μg protein were agitated overnight at 4°C with 2 μL GFP antibodies (#ab290; abcam) or 1 μL histone H3 antibodies (#ab1791; abcam) and 30 μL protein A sepharose 6 MB beads (#17-0469-01; GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20, twice with RIPA buffer supplemented with 0.5% TritonX-100 and then eluted with 100 μL ice-cold glycine buffer (100 mM glycine, pH 2.8, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Eluates were neutralized with 50 μL of 1 M Tris, pH 9. After incubation with 10 μg/μL proteinase K (#03115887001; Roche), overnight cross-links were reversed for 8 h at 65°C. ChIP DNA was treated with 100 μg/μL RNase A (#EN0531; Thermo Scientific), purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol extraction, and precipitated with 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. ChIP DNA was resuspended in 30 μL TE buffer. Library preparation and sequencing was performed by the Campus Service Support Facilities in Vienna. The libraries were constructed using KAPA Library Preparation Kit Illumina series (#KK8201; KAPA Biosystems). To summarize, 5 to 10 ng DNA was end-repaired, A bases were added to the 3′ end of the DNA fragments, and adapters were ligated. After each of these steps, the DNA was purified using the Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification kit. DNA was size-selected on a 2% agarose gel and purified using Qiagen Gel Extraction and MiniElute PCR purification kit. DNA was PCR amplified using a program of (1) 30 s at 98°C, (2) 15 cycles of 40 s at 98°C, 30 s at 65°C, and 30 s at 72°C, and (3) a 5-min extension at 72°C. The final libraries were purified using a Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification kit. The libraries were validated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and DNA concentration was determined by qPCR. Library DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation, and 36-bp single-end sequencing was achieved on a Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina) following Illumina’s protocol. Each library was sequenced in one lane of the flow cell. Sequenced reads were aligned with mismatch cost set to 1 and limit to 7 using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0. As reference genome, TAIR10 was used. Significant binding regions were identified using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0 with the following settings: window size, 150 nucleotides; maximum false discovery rate, 5%; shift reads based on fragment length, 300 nucleotides. False discovery rate was determined according to CITATION. Peak boundaries were refined and candidate peaks were filtered using two filtering criteria: based on difference in read orientation count 0.4 and on probability of identical locations of forward and reverse reads 0.1. This ensured that peaks were only called if there was a well-balanced number of forward and reverse reads. Background peaks were filtered using a similar-sized data set of uniquely mapped reads obtained from sequencing the input DNA. Reads were normalized according to the CLC manual (http://www.clcsupport.com/clcgenomicsworkbench/650/index.php?manual=Peak_finding_false_discovery_rates.html). Peaks were annotated based on the location of their summits with respect to nearby genes, as annotated in TAIR10 by the following criteria: If a peak summit was located in (1) a gene’s exon, (2) a gene’s intron, (3) in the 5′ UTR (upstream 1000 bp from the start codon), (4) in the 3′ UTR (downstream 1000 bp from the stop codon), or (5) binding sites not selected by the above four criteria were defined as the binding sites in the intergenic regions. Data-mining and cross experiment data integration were performed using MySQL open-source relational database management system and custom SQL scripts. TAIR10 was used as index in order to match peaks in the same gene between different samples. Finally, precise genomic coordinates of peaks were used to verify the identity of the peaks. To identify robust DEK3 DNA binding sites, we determined peaks shared by the three independent DEK3-CFP transgenic lines. To determine the genomic distribution of DEK3 peaks relative to the gene structure, gene loci were divided into regions 1, 2, and 3 kb upstream of the translational start site (ATG), a region from the ATG to the stop codon, and into regions 1 and 2 kb downstream of the stop codon. Taking the length of the gene into account, we calculated the relative position of each peak summit between start and stop codon, as well as in the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions, using the number of reads under each peak summit. Subsequently, these data were averaged across all DEK3 target genes and normalized to the total number of reads and peaks. Peaks outside these regions were not included in the analysis. Gene Ontology term classification was performed with Babelomics (http://babelomics.bioinfo.cipf.es). To validate genes identified by ChIP-Seq, ChIP products from three independent biological samples from three independent DEK3-CFP lines were used to perform qPCR. Data from three technical replicates were collected under the following cycling conditions: a 95°C hold for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Nonspecific PCR products were identified by dissociation curves. The immunoprecipitation signal was calculated relative to the input signal. Primers are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Immunoprecipitations were performed using the same conditions as for ChIP experiments except that the material was not sheared and the antibodies were cross-linked to the beads using 20 mM dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich). After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20, 10 times with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and twice with 150 mM NaCl. Proteins were eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.0, and neutralized with 1.5 M Tris, pH 9.2. Eluates were reduced, alkylated, and digested using trypsin (#V5280; Promega). Samples were subjected to nanoflow chromatography using an UltiMate 3000 HPLC RSLC nano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to introduction into a mass spectrometer for further analysis. Mass spectrometry was performed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a Proxeon nanospray source. Peptides were loaded onto a trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 25 μL min−1 using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase. After 10 min, the trap column was switched to analytic column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted using a flow rate or 230 nL min−1 and a binary 2-h gradient for 165 min. For peptide identification, the “.RAW-files” were loaded into Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot (Matrix Science) against the NCBI Arabidopsis nonredundant protein sequence database. The following search parameters were used: β-methylthiolation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification, oxidation on methionine, substitution of glutamine against pyro-glutamic acid, and phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Monoisotopic masses were searched within unrestricted protein masses for tryptic peptides. The peptide mass tolerance was set to ±5 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance to ±0.5 D. The maximal number of missed cleavages was set to 2. For better visualization, the results of the searches were loaded into Scaffold (Proteome Software) using a minimum of two unique peptides per protein and a Mascot Score of at least 20 as cutoff filters. DNA topology assays were performed as described by CITATION with small modifications. Purified recombinant DEK protein was dialyzed with Whatman filters (type: 0.025 μm VSWP) against topoisomerase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 20% glycerol) in the presence of 1 μg of BSA per μL for 90 min at 4°C. One hundred nanograms of plasmid DNA (pBluescript) was incubated with GST-DEK3 or GST alone in the presence of 1 unit of topoisomerase I (#M2852; Promega). The reactions were performed in the topoisomerase buffer in a total volume of 90 μL for 60 min at 37°C. After proteinase K (#03115887001; Roche) digestion, DNA was precipitated and analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mM Tris-borate and 1 mM EDTA) at 2 V/cm for 16 h. The gel was stained with SYBR Green I (#S9430; Sigma-Aldrich). For analysis histone H3 occupancy, ChIP and qPCR was performed as described above. Nuclei were extracted as mentioned above, resuspended in 500 μL MNase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mM CaCl2) and incubated for 5 min at 37°C with 75 units of MNase I (#2910A; TaKaRa). The reaction was stopped with 50 mM EDTA for 45 min at 65°C. DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol extraction and precipitated with 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. DNA was resuspended in 20 μL TE buffer and separated in 2% (w/v) agarose gels. From these gels, the ∼150-bp band was precisely excised, and mononucleosomal DNA was purified using the Wizard SV gel clean-up system (#A9282; Promega). DNA was quantified by qPCR as described above using primers spanning <150 bp. Accessibility of DNA to digestion with MNase was analyzed with CHART-PCR as described previously (CITATION; CITATION) with small modifications. Nuclei were extracted as mentioned above and resuspended in 500 μL MNase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mM CaCl2). Nuclei were incubated for 15 min at 37°C with 15 units of MNase I (#2910A; TaKaRa). The reaction was stopped with 50 mM EDTA for 45 min at 65°C. DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol extraction and precipitated with 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. DNA was resuspended in 20 μL TE buffer. DNA was quantified by qPCR as described above using primers spanning more than 150 bp. For MNase accessibility, the percentage of cutting was calculated by expressing the amount of genomic DNA remaining as a percentage of the amount of genomic DNA in cells that were not treated with MNase.
