!~ABS~! Arabidopsis ROF1 (AtFKBP62) is a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase and a member of the FKBP (FK506 binding protein) family. ROF1 expression is induced by heat stress and developmentally regulated. In this study, we show that ROF1 binds heat shock proteins HSP90.1 via its tetratricopeptide repeat domain, and localizes in the cytoplasm under normal conditions. Exposure to heat stress induces nuclear localization of the ROF1–HSP90.1 complex, which is dependent upon the presence of the transcription factor HsfA2, which interacts with HSP90.1 but not with ROF1. Nuclear localization of ROF1 was not detected in Arabidopsis HSP90.1 and HsfA2 knockout mutants. The rof1 knockout plants exhibited collapse when 24–48 h passed between acclimation at 37°C and exposure to 45°C. Transgenic ROF1 over-expressors showed better survival in response to exposure to 45°C than wild-type plants did. In rof1 knockout mutants, the level of expression of small HSPs regulated by HsfA2 was dramatically reduced after exposure to 37°C and recovery for 24–48 h, and correlates well with the mutant phenotype. We suggest a role for ROF1 in prolongation of thermotolerance by sustaining the levels of small HSPs that are essential for survival at high temperatures.
!~RES~! ROF1 has been shown to interact with heterologous wheat (Triticum aestivum) HSP90 (CITATION). In order to identify the cytosolic Arabidopsis HSP90 isoform that interacts with ROF1, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system using AtHSP90.1 and HSP90.2 as prey and ROF1 as bait. Although AtHSP90.1 and AtHSP90.2 share 88% homology, only AtHSP90.1 was found to interact with ROF1 (Figure 1a). To identify which domain of ROF1 was responsible for the interaction with HSP90.1, yeast two-hybrid vectors were generated to express ROF1 recombinant proteins lacking the N-terminal domain (ROF1-ΔN), the C-terminal domain (ROF1-ΔC), or a full recombinant protein with a modified TPR domain containing five mutations: K404A, N408D, N454D, N484A and R488A (ROF1_5M). The truncated protein lacking the C-terminal (ROF1-ΔC) and recombinant ROF1 with five mutated amino acids (ROF1_5M) were not able to recognize HSP90.1, but the truncated ROF1 without the N-terminus (which includes the PPIase domain) (ROF1-ΔN) did interact with HSP90.1 (Figure 1b). These results indicate that the PPIase domain is not involved in recognition of HSP90.1, and that the amino acids K404, N408, N454, K484 and R488 are essential for ROF1 interaction with HSP90.1. ROF2, the homolog of ROF1 that is detected only after heat stress (CITATION), interacts with barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvHSP90 but not with AtHSP90.1 (Figure 1c). This is evidence for ROF selectivity in terms of recognition of HSP90, and therefore we suggest a mechanism of selectivity among Arabidopsis HSP90 isoforms in their interaction with ROF proteins. [[FIGURE]] To confirm the interaction between ROF1 and AtHSP90.1 in planta and to reveal its subcellular localization, we used a BiFC assay utilizing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) split into two non-overlapping N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) fragments. Each fragment is cloned in-frame to genes of interest, enabling expression of non-fluorescent fusion proteins, which generate a positive fluorescent signal upon interaction (CITATION). When ROF1 and AtHSP90.1 were fused to the N- and C-terminal YFP fragments, respectively, and co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaves, a strong BiFC signal was detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 2a). Co-expression of ROF1_5M with AtHSP90.1 in Arabidopsis showed no positive signals (Figure 2a). Images of Arabidopsis cells expressing ROF1–YN and AtHSP90.1–YC after plasmolysis indicate that the interaction is located in the cytoplasm (Figure 2b). Cytoplasmic localization was confirmed by Western blot analysis of separated soluble fractions of cell proteins after ultracentrifugation (Figure 2c). [[FIGURE]] As expression of both HSP90.1 and ROF1 is heat-induced, we tested the interaction of HSP90.1 and ROF1 by the BiFC method after exposing the plants to heat stress (3 h at 37°C). The HSP90.1 and ROF1 interaction was detected in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Figure 3a). The presence of HSP90 and ROF1 in the nucleus was confirmed by detection of the individual proteins in isolated nuclei (Figure 3b). ROF1 was detected in the nucleus after heat stress only, whereas the levels of both ROF1 and HSP90 increased in the cytoplasm (Figure 3b). The possibility that the increase in abundance of ROF1 is a mixture of ROF1 and ROF2 was ruled out by using specific anti-ROF2 antibody (data not shown). The identity of the HSP90 isoform could not be determined, as the HSP90 antibodies cannot discriminate between the isoforms. The appearance of ROF1 and HSP90 in the nucleus only after heat stress led to the speculation that they may function as a putative protein complex with additional partners, in which ROF1 may function as a chaperone. As HSP90s and FKBPs are known to interact with various proteins, we tested the hypothesis that HSP90 or ROF1 binds an additional protein and the putative tri-partner complex moves to the nucleus. [[FIGURE]] Based on the function of HsfA2 as a dominant HSF in thermotolerance in tomato and Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION) and its interaction with proteins such as tomato HsfA1 and Hsp17.4-CII (CITATION; CITATION), we analyzed HsfA2 as a putative binding partner of ROF1–HSP90.1. We first assessed whether HsfA2 is co-expressed with ROF1 and HSP90.1. Using the Gene Investigator data mining tool (http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch), the expression profiles of ROF1, HSP90.1 and HsfA2 were compared, indicating a high correlation coefficient between HsfA2 and both ROF1 (r = 0.72) and HSP90.1 (r = 0.80). Analysis using the BiFC system demonstrated an interaction between HSP90.1 and HsfA2, but no interaction between ROF1 and HsfA2 was observed (Figure 4a,b), suggesting that HsfA2 physically interacts only with HSP90.1. To determine whether this interaction occurs within the proposed trimeric complex, the BiFC assay between ROF1 and HSP90.1 was repeated, and untagged HsfA2 (HsfA2pBIN) was co-expressed, resulting in a positive BiFC signal for ROF1–HSP90.1 in the nucleus under normal conditions without heat shock (Figure 4c); in contrast, expression of the control empty vector pBin did not have this effect (Figure 4d). [[FIGURE]] Co-expression of HsfA2 increased the number of nuclei positive for ROF1–HSP90.1 interaction (68%) compared to the interaction in heat-stressed plants (24%) expressing only endogenous HsfA2 (Figure 5). When the experiment was performed in HsfA2 knockout plants injected with ROF1–YC and HSP90.1–YN, no interaction was detected in the nuclei, either before or after heat stress (Figure 5). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the endogenous proteins are mutually dependent for nuclear localization following heat stress, we utilized rof1, HSP90.1 and HsfA2 knockout plants to test for localization of ROF1 and HsfA2 after heat stress. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were separated by SDS–PAGE and probed with anti-ROF1 or anti-HsfA2 antibodies. Compared to wild-type cells that showed nuclear and cytoplasmic ROF1, ROF1 was present only in the cytosol in the HsfA2 and HSP90.1 knockout mutants, indicating that their presence is essential for ROF1 nuclear localization (Figure 6). HsfA2 localization in both the cytosol and the nuclei was unaffected in the rof1 and HSP90.1 knockout mutants, indicating that its localization is independent of both proteins (Figure 6). [[FIGURE]] Taken together, these results indicate that HsfA2 is responsible for the nuclear localization of the ROF1–HSP90.1 complex under conditions of over-expression, which probably mimic the natural conditions of heat stress. To study the role of ROF1 in thermotolerance, seedlings of rof1 knockout and ROF1 over-expressors were exposed to heat stress at 37°C followed by short and long recovery times before exposure to higher stress at 45°C (Figure 7). All seedlings exposed to 45°C without acclimation treatment collapsed and bleached (Figure 7a), whereas all seedlings exposed to acclimation followed by a short recovery time of 2 h were resistant (Figure 7b). Seedlings exposed to acclimation followed by a long recovery time of 2 days showed various responses (Figure 7c,d). HsfA2 and rof1 knockout seedlings collapsed and could not cope with the severe heat stress exposure at 45°C. The rof1 knockout seedlings rescued by expression of transgenic ROF1 (rof1−::ROF1) coped with the severe heat stress as well as the wild-type did, indicating that loss of ROF1 was the reason for sensitivity to heat stress. Transgenic plants over-expressing ROF1 exhibited resistance to the severe heat stress treatment, indicating that ROF1 contributes to long-term acquired thermotolerance. [[FIGURE]] HsfA2 is a major transcription factor for heat stress-induced proteins such as the small HSPs (sHSPs) Hsp18.1-CI, Hsp25.3-P and Hsa32 (Charng et al., 2006, 2007; CITATION). As sHSPs have been reported to play an important role in the heat stress response (CITATION; CITATIONCITATION), the transcription profile of several sHSPs was determined in the rof1 and HsfA2 knockout mutants (Figure 8). Hsp17.6-CII, 18.1-CI, 25.3-P and Hsa32 were detectable in the knockout rof1 and HsfA2 mutants after heat stress, but their steady-state transcript levels decreased dramatically after a recovery of 24 and 48 h. The most sensitive was Hsp25.3-P, which was undetectable in the rof1 and HsfA2 knockout mutants after 24 h of recovery. [[FIGURE]] These results indicate the effects of ROF1 on steady-state levels of sHSP transcripts, and correlate directly with the phenotype of seedling collapse after exposure to severe heat stress (Figure 7a). The absence of sHSPs could be the reason for the observed phenotype. A decrease in the level of sHSP proteins was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-sHSP antibodies (Figure 8b). Low protein levels were detected before heat stress and after 48 h of recovery, but the recovery of 36 h revealed a lower amount of sHSP proteins in the rof1 knockout mutant compared to the wild-type. The protein levels of HsfA2 were determined using anti-HsfA2 antibodies and were found to be similar in the wild-type and rof1 knockout mutant (data not shown). A synergistic effect of HsfA2 and ROF1 on transcription of Hsp25.3-P, 18.1-CI and Hsa32 was revealed by transient expression of HsfA2 in transgenic ROF1 over-expressor plants (Figure 9). ROF1 over-expression by itself was insufficient to increase the expression levels of the sHSPs (Figure 9a), and expression of HsfA2 was essential for the increase in sHSP transcript levels (Figure 9b). The ROF1 over-expressor plants injected with HsfA2 expressed Hsp25.3-P, Hsa32 and Hsp18.1-CI at much higher levels than wild-type plants, whereas the level of Hsp17.6-CII transcripts was less affected by the presence of high levels of ROF1 (Figure 9). These results are even more convincing as the expression level of HsfA2 is slightly higher in wild-type plants. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The coding region of the ROF1 gene (codons 1–552) was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5′-CGCCCCGGGGATGGATGCTAATTTCGAGATGCCT-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGCCCATGGTTATTCCTTACTTAGTTTCGCAAAC-3′), and cloned in-frame into pLexA (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/) via XmaI and NcoI restriction sites. The specific fragments for deletion constructs were ROF1-ΔC (amino acid residues 1–389 of AtROF1) and ROF1-ΔN (amino acid residues 390–552 of AtROF1). ROF1_5M was constructed as described previously (CITATION). The coding region of the ROF2 cDNA gene (codons 1–578) was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGAAGACGATTTCGAC-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTCATGCCTTGGTGTCAATAC-3′), and cloned in-frame into pLexA (Clontech) via EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The coding region of the HSP90.1 gene (codons 1–706) was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5′-CGCCTCGAGACTAGTATGGCGGATGTTCAGATGGCTG-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGCCTCGAGTTAGTCGACTTCCTCCATCTTGCTC-3′), and cloned in-frame into pB42AD (Clontech) via XhoI restriction sites. The coding region of the HSP90.2 gene (codons 1–700) was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5′-CGCCTCGAGACTAGTATGGCGGACGCTGAAACCTTTG-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGCCTCGAGTTAGTCGACTTCCTCCATCTTGCTC-3′). A silent point mutation (A→C) was made at position 1108, which disrupted an XhoI restriction site, and the mutant HSP90.2 was then cloned in-frame into pB42AD (Clontech) via XhoI restriction sites. HvHSP90 pB42AD (CITATION) was kindly provided by K. Shirasu (Riken Plant Science Center, Yokohama, Japan). The plasmid constructs were introduced into the EGY48 yeast strain (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::plexAop6-LEU2); by lithium acetate transformation, together with the pSH18.34 vector (OriGene, http://www.origene.com) carrying the URA3 selectable marker and the lacZ reporter gene fused to eight lexA operators. Yeast transformants were selected on plates containing complete minimal (CM) drop-out medium without uracil and histidine but with glucose as the unique carbon source. Individual yeast colonies were then tested for expression of β-galactosidase using X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside) and by their ability to grow on plates containing CM drop-out medium without uracil, histidine or leucine. Generation of transgenic plants. The Arabidopsis line (Col-0 ecotype) containing a T-DNA insertion in the HsfA2 gene (SALK_008978) (CITATION) was obtained from Pascal von Koskull-Doring (Department of Cell Biology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany). The Arabidopsis AtHSP90.1 T-DNA insertion line in the Col-0 ecotype were kindly provided by K. Shirasu (CITATION). The rof1 knockout mutant in the Arabidopsis WS ecotype has been described previously (CITATION). To generate ROF1 over-expressor plants and rof1−::ROF1 plants, the coding region of the ROF1 gene (codons 1–552) was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGATGCTAATTTCGAGATGCCT-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTTATTCCTTACTTAGTTTCGCAAAC-3′), and cloned in-frame into the pLBR19 binary vector via XhoI restriction sites. pLBR19-ROF1 was digested with SacI and XbaI, and the resulting fragment (ROF1 + 35S PRO/TERM cDNA) was cloned into a SacI/XbaI-digested pCAMBIA 1300 vector. The construct was sequenced to confirm there were no errors generated by PCR, and then introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (CITATION). Arabidopsis wild-type ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) and rof1 knockout plants were transformed with the constructs by the floral-dip method (CITATION). Approximately 100 sterilized T1 seeds from each T0 transformed plant were germinated on MS agar plates containing 60 mg/ml hygromycin. The selected plantlets were then transferred to soil and grown to yield T2 seeds. Three homozygous T3 lines of wild-type and rof1 knockout plants containing ROF1::35S (ROF1 o.e. #6, ROF1 o.e. #8, ROF1 o.e. #12; rof1−::ROF1 #1, rof1−::ROF1 #3, rof1−::ROF1 #6) were selected for further analysis by PCR and Western blot. Plant materials and growth conditions. In all experiments, we used wild-type controls of both ecotypes Col-0 and WS. As both ecotypes exhibited a similar pattern, and rof1 knockout and ROF1 over-expressors were in the WS ecotype, the ecotype represented in all figures is WS. For leaf injection (BiFC method and HsfA2 expression), Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown on soil for approximately 5 weeks and irrigated from below. Plants were grown in an environmental growth chamber under short-day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark cycles) at 22°C. For RNA preparation, protein extraction and heat stress bioassay, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were germinated on plates containing MS medium (Murashige and Skoog medium including vitamins, Duchefa), comprising 0.2% w/v MS, 2.5 mm MES, 1% sucrose and 0.5% plant agar (Duchefa, http://www.duchefa.com) for 5–14 days. After 2–3 days at 4°C in the dark for stratification, seeds were grown on plates at 22°C under long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) unless otherwise mentioned. For BiFC, 2 days after injection, the whole plant was incubated for 3 h at 37°C in an incubator with high humidity to avoid drought stress. For RNA preparation and protein extraction, 5-day-old seedlings were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in an incubator, and then returned to recovery conditions of 22°C under long days (16 h light, 8 h dark) for various durations (see figure legends). For thermotolerance bioassays, the plates were sealed with parafilm (Pechiney Plastic Packaging Company, Chicago, IL) after recovery, and then incubated for 60 min in a 45°C water bath. After the 45°C treatment, the plates were incubated at 22°C for recovery under long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) for another 8 days. To estimate the relative levels of ROF1, HSP90.1 and HsfA2 mRNA in various tissues and in response to stress treatments, we used the Gene Correlator tool from the Genevestigator Arabidopsis thaliana microarray database (http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) (Zimmermann et al., 2004, 2005), which shows how two genes are co-expressed over selected chips in the database. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r2) is given as an indication of the quality of least-squares fitting to the data. ROF1, ROF1_5M, AtHSP90.1 and AtHsfA2 cDNA fragments were cloned into the SpeI site of a pSY728 vector containing the N-terminal fragment of YFP (YN) and a pSY738 vector containing the C-terminal fragment of YFP (YC) (CITATION). The resulting constructs, pSY728-AtROF1 (ROF1–YN), pSY728-AtROF1_5M (ROF1_5M–YN), pSY728-AtHSP90.1 (HSP90.1–YN), pSY728-AtHsfA2 (HsfA2–YN), pSY738-AtROF1 (ROF1–YC), pSY738-AtROF1_5M (ROF1_5M–YC), pSY738-AtHSP90.1 (HSP90.1–YC) and pSY738-AtHsfA2 (HsfA2–YC) were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and co-transformed by injection into Arabidopsis leaves in various combinations (Table 1). A plasmid containing CaMV 35S–YFP was used as a control. Western blot analysis confirmed expression of the transient proteins. Arabidopsis leaves were injected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains GV3101/mp90 harboring the appropriate plasmids. Cultures (10 ml) were grown overnight at 28°C in Luria–Bertani liquid medium with kanamycin (30 μg/ml). The next day, 500 μl of the cultures were transferred into induction medium [50.78 mm MES, 0.5% Glc, 1.734 mm NaH2PO4, 0.2 mm acetosyringone, and 5% 20× AB mix (373.9 mm NH4Cl, 24.34 mm MgSO4, 40.23 mm KCl, 1.36 mm CaCl2 and 0.18 mm FeSO4·7 H2O)], and grown for an additional 4 h until the OD600 reached 0.2–0.6. Before injection, cultures were diluted with induction medium until the OD600 reached 0.12. YFP fluorescence was observed in leaves for 24 and 48 h after injection. An intact leaf was dipped in 1 m KCl and incubated in 100 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) for 30 min at 4°C. Leaves were plasmolyzed by incubation in 0.8 m NaCl. Leaf sections were mounted on microscope slides in the plasmolysis solution. Total RNA from seedlings or leaves (100 mg) before and after heat-stress treatment was isolated as described previously (CITATION). All RNA samples were quantified at 260 nm using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (http://www.nanodrop.com/). First-strand cDNA was produced using 2 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT)15 primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, http://www.promega.com/). The resulting cDNA was diluted 40 times, and 5 μl were used as a template in a 25 μl PCR reaction using gene-specific primers PCR amplification was performed as follows: 94°C for 4 min, followed by five cycles at 94°C for 45 sec, 55°C for 45 sec and 72°C for 1 min, then 19 (for ribosomal 40S) or 25 cycles (for ROF1 and all other genes) at 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 45 sec and 72°C for 2 min. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR reactions were performed using a PTC-200-PCR Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, http://www.gmc-inc.com/BiotechLab/mjresearchptc100.htm). For semi-quantitative analysis, the intensity of the bands was determined by densitometry using image master id prime software version 4.1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, http://www5.amershambiosciences.com/). Protein extractions were performed as previously described (CITATION). For Sup-100 (soluble fraction after centrifugation at 100 000 g), proteins extracted from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were centrifuged for 1 h at 200 000 g. ROF1 was detected using polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant wFKBP73 (α-73) (CITATION; CITATION) used at a dilution of 1:3000. Arabidopsis HSP90.1 was detected using rabbit R2 antiserum against Brassica HSP90 (CITATION) diluted 1:2500. The antibodies against HsfA2 were provided by Pascal von Koskull-Doring (Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany) and used at a dilution of 1:1000. The antibodies against sHSPs-CI were provided by Dr Adam (Institute of Plant Sciences and Genetics in Agriculture, Hebrew University Rehovot, Israel) and used at a dilution of 1:1000 (CITATION). Anti-histone antibodies (dimethyl histone H3) were purchased from Millipore (http://www.millipore.com). Secondary anti-rabbit (for α-73, α-HSP90 and sHSPs-CI) or anti-guinea pig (for α-HsfA2) IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (Pharmacia, http://www.gmi-inc.com/products/pharmacidFPLC.htm/) were used at a dilution of 1:15 000. Detection was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents and analysis system (Amersham Biosciences, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/). Leaves of 3–4-week-old plants were used for nuclei isolation. Leaves were frozen and ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4°C. The nuclei were isolated as described by CITATION. Approximately 20 g of tissue powder were mixed with 100 ml of extraction buffer (250 mm Suc, 10 mm PIPES/KOH pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min, then filtered through two layers of Miracloth (http://www.miracloth.com/index.cfm/) and subjected to centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of nuclei washing buffer (NWB: 0.4 m hexylene glycol, 10 mm PIPES/KOH pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100), filtered through a 100 μm nylon mesh, layered on 15 ml of 30% Percoll in NWB, and centrifuged again at 1000 g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of NWB and filtered through a 100 μm nylon mesh. Nuclei were further purified in a discontinuous Percoll gradient made by layering 10 ml of 30% Percoll in NWB on 10 ml of floating buffer (0.44 m Suc, 80% Percoll, 10 mm PIPES/KOH pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2). The gradient was centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min, and most nuclei formed a layer just above the floating buffer. Nuclei were removed, washed once with NWB (without Triton X-100), and collected by centrifugation. The nuclei-enriched fraction was resuspended in protein sample buffer (0.175 m Tris/HCl pH 8.8, 5% SDS, 15% glycerol, 30 mm dithiothreitol) and separated by SDS–PAGE for Western blot analysis.
