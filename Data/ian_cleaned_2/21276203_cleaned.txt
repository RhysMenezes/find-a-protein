!~ABS~! In Arabidopsis thaliana, the serine/threonine protein kinase oxidative signal‐inducible 1 (OXI1), mediates oxidative stress signalling. Its activity is required for full activation of the mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs), MPK3 and MPK6, in response to oxidative stress. In addition, the serine/threonine protein kinase Pto‐interacting 1‐2 (PTI1‐2) has been positioned downstream from OXI1, but whether PTI1‐2 signals through MAPK cascades is unclear. Using a yeast two‐hybrid screen we show that OXI1 also interacts with PTI1‐4. OXI1 and PTI1‐4 are stress‐responsive genes and are expressed in the same tissues. Therefore, studies were undertaken to determine whether PTI1‐4 is positioned in the OXI1/MAPK signalling pathway. The interaction between OXI1 and PTI1‐4 was confirmed by using in vivo co‐immunoprecipitation experiments. OXI1 and PTI1‐4 were substrates of MPK3 and MPK6 in vitro. Although no direct interaction was detected between OXI1 and MPK3 or MPK6, in vitro binding studies showed interactions between MPK3 or MPK6 with PTI1‐4. In addition, PTI1‐4 and MPK6 were found in vivo in the same protein complex. These results demonstrate that PTI1‐4 signals via OXI1 and MPK6 signalling cascades.

!~RES~! To isolate other components of the OXI1 (AGC2‐1) signalling pathway, a yeast two‐hybrid screen was performed. The OXI1 ORF fused to the GAL4 binding domain was used as bait to screen a library of Arabidopsis root cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Two serine/threonine protein kinases that share strong sequence identity to the tomato PTI1 kinase were identified. Work by Anthony et al. [CITATION] had already positioned these kinases as new downstream OXI1 components and named the proteins PTI1‐1, 1‐2 and 1‐3. One of the prey cDNA encoded PTI1‐1 (At1g06700) and a second prey cDNA encoded another member of the family, which we named PTI1‐4 (At2g47060) (Fig. 1A). To isolate additional components of this OXI1/PTI1‐4 pathway, a second two‐hybrid screen using PTI1‐4 as bait was performed. 4.2 × 105 transformed yeast colonies were screened on selective media lacking histidine and containing 1 mm 3‐Amino‐1,2,4‐triazole (3‐AT). Seven positive clones showing growth on selective media lacking adenine as well as β‐galactosidase activity were further analysed (Fig. 1B). Three of the prey cDNAs encoded two other members of the AGC family, AGC2‐2 (At4g13000) and AGC2‐3 (At1g51170), which belong to group VIII [CITATION], such as OXI1/AGC2‐1.  [[FIGURE]] The interaction between PTI1‐4 and OXI1 was confirmed by in vitro pull‐down assays. OXI1 and PTI1‐4 kinases were histidine (HIS)‐ or glutathione S‐transferase (GST)‐tagged and purified from Escherichia coli. After mixing together HIS‐OXI1 and GST‐PTI1‐4 proteins or HIS‐PTI1‐4 and GST‐OXI1 proteins, the GST‐tagged proteins were pulled down with glutathione‐agarose beads. The proteins were then detected by western blot analysis using an anti‐HIS or an anti‐GST IgG. Figure 1C shows HIS‐PTI1‐4 and HIS‐OXI1 bound to GST‐OXI1 and GST‐PTI1‐4, respectively, but not to GST alone. The kinase‐deficient mutant, OXI1K45R, in which the lysine residue of the ATP binding domain is mutated to arginine, still interacted with PTI1‐4. These data indicate that the kinase activity of OXI1 is not required for the interaction with PTI1‐4.  Because various PTIs interact with AGCs VIII in vitro, the interaction between OXI1 and PTI1‐4 proteins was tested in Arabidopsis plants. To investigate the association between OXI1 and PTI1‐4 in vivo, we generated transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing both an OXI1 genomic fragment tagged with haemagglutinin (HA) under the control of its own promoter (OXI1pro:HA‐OXI1) and a 35Spro:PTI1‐4‐MYC construct. The interaction between the two proteins was then tested using co‐immunoprecipitation assays. When HA‐OXI1 fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from plant extracts using an anti‐HA IgG, PTI1‐4‐MYC was detected in the HA‐OXI1 immunocomplex (Fig. 2). As controls, plant extracts were also mixed with protein A‐sepharose beads only and showed no PTI1‐4‐MYC signal. In addition, plant extracts from wild‐type Col‐0 plants were immunoprecipitated with an anti‐HA IgG and no background signal was visible (Fig. 2). These results indicate that OXI1 and PTI1‐4 interact in vivo.  [[FIGURE]] As Rentel et al. [CITATION] showed, by northern blot analysis, that in seedlings the expression of OXI1 was increased upon oxidative stress, we investigated whether PTI1‐4 mRNA accumulated after oxidative stress in seedlings. Real‐time quantitative RT‐PCR was used to show an increase in the levels of OXI1 and PTI1‐4 transcripts in response to different stresses, such as H2O2, wound and cellulase treatment (Fig. 3A). Both genes responded to the different oxidative stress treatments in a similar pattern. The response was fast, observable within 0.5–1 h of the treatment and was transient. However, the accumulation of the OXI1 transcript in response to oxidative stress was stronger than that of the PTI1‐4 transcript.  [[FIGURE]] If OXI1 and PTI1‐4 function together in Arabidopsis, the expression pattern of the two genes should be comparable. It is known that OXI1 is expressed in the roots as well as the root hairs [CITATION]. To examine the tissue‐specific expression pattern of PTI‐4, we transformed Arabidopsis plants with a PTI1‐4pro:GUS construct. Histochemical staining of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings showed that PTI1‐4 is more broadly expressed in the seedling than OXI1 (Fig. 3B). A strong expression of PTI1‐4 could be detected in the roots as well as the root hairs, similar to OXI1 (Fig. 3B). Expression of both genes was observed early during plant growth and was present in the root apical meristem of the embryo. However, OXI1 expression is mainly localized to the root meristem, whereas PTI1‐4 is expressed in different tissues of the embryo.  Next, by using in vitro kinase assays we tested whether OXI1 could phosphorylate PTI1‐4 because OXI1 is known to phosphorylate PTI1‐1 and PTI1‐2 in vitro and, to a lesser extent, PTI1‐3 [CITATION]. Both kinases were purified as HIS‐tagged proteins and incubated with [γ‐32P]‐ATP. In contrast to PTI1‐4, OXI1 was capable of strong autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 4A). When both proteins were incubated together, OXI1 could phosphorylate PTI1‐4. As expected, the kinase‐inactive form of OXI1 (OXI1K45R) showed no autophosphorylation activity and showed no phosphorylation of PTI1‐4. OXI1 is therefore able to use PTI1‐4 as a substrate as well as the artificial substrate myelin basic protein (MBP) but not GST (Fig. 4A). Although no kinase activity could be detected for PTI1‐4 in vitro, incubating OXI1 with increasing amounts of PTI1‐4 enhanced the autophosphorylation activity of OXI1 (Fig. 4B) as well as the transphosphorylation of MBP. Simply by incubating the two proteins over a period of time in kinase buffer before adding the [γ‐32P]‐ATP was sufficient to increase the autophosphorylation activity of OXI1 as well as transphosphorylation of PTI1‐4 and MBP proteins (Fig. 4B). Incubating OXI1 alone for a period of time in kinase buffer before adding the [γ‐32P]‐ATP did not significantly increase its autophosphorylation activity. These results suggest that PTI1‐4 may be necessary for activation of the OXI1 kinase activity.  [[FIGURE]] Because OXI1 has been shown to play a role in the activation of MPK3 and MPK6 in response to abiotic stresses [CITATION], we studied whether PTI1‐4 was also required for the full activation of MPK3 and MPK6. However, the activity of MPK3 and MPK6 was not altered in response to wounding in pti1‐4 mutant plants or to cellulase 0.1% treatment in 35Spro:PTI1‐4‐MYC transgenic lines compared with Col‐0 (Fig. S1). We then tested whether the OXI1 protein could use MPK3 and MPK6 proteins as substrates. Because the purified GST‐MPKs showed autophosphorylation activity, loss‐of‐function (kinase‐inactive) forms of the MAPKs were produced as GST‐lofMPK3 and GST‐lofMPK6. However, when lofMPK3 and lofMPK6 proteins were tested for phosphorylation with OXI1, no phosphorylation of lofMPK3 or lofMPK6 was observed (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, when OXI1K45R or PTI1‐4 proteins were mixed with active MPK3 or MPK6 kinases, phosphorylation of OXI1K45R and PTI1‐4 by MPK3 as well as MPK6 proteins could be detected (Fig. 5B). As expected, no phosphorylation was seen when the kinase inactive forms lofMPK3 and lofMPK6 were tested for phosphorylation of OXI1K45R or PTI1‐4 (Fig. 5B). These results show that MPK3 and MPK6 can phosphorylate OXI1 as well as PTI1‐4 in vitro. [[FIGURE]] To investigate further the interaction between OXI1/PTI1‐4 and MPK3/MPK6 proteins, we tested whether HIS‐OXI1 or HIS‐PTI1‐4 could bind to GST‐MPK3 or GST‐MPK6 proteins in vitro. Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A) showed that PTI1‐4 could bind to each of the MAPKs, but not to GST alone. No direct interaction between OXI1 and the MAPK proteins was detected (Fig. 6B). To confirm the interaction between PTI1‐4 and MPK3/MPK6, in vivo co‐immunoprecipitation experiments were undertaken. In addition, to link OXI1 to MPK3 and MPK6 proteins, we examined whether OXI1 could also be found in complexes with MPK3 or MPK6 proteins in vivo. For this purpose we used transgenic plants expressing either a 35Spro:PTI1‐4‐MYC or a 35Spro:OXI1‐MYC construct. The different MAPK proteins were immunoprecipitated using MAPK‐specific antibodies. After western blot analysis, PTI1‐4 could be detected in anti‐MPK6 immunoprecipitates from roots but not from anti‐MPK3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6C). However, the MPK3 protein could also barely be detected in root extracts after immunoprecipitation with the anti‐MPK3 IgG (Fig. 6D). On the other hand, the MPK6 protein was present in root extracts after immunoprecipitation with the anti‐MPK6 IgG. These results indicate that PTI1‐4 forms a protein complex with MPK6 in vivo. In contrast to PTI1‐4, OXI1 was not detected from anti‐MPK3 or anti‐MPK6 immunoprecipitates. The fact that OXI1 could not be detected in a complex with the MAPK proteins might be due to the low amount of OXI1 protein in 35Spro:OXI1‐MYC transgenic plants compared with 35Spro:PTI1‐4‐MYC overexpressors. Another possibility is that the interaction between OXI1 and MAPK proteins is triggered by stress. Thus, we then used Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing OXI1 under the control of its promoter. When using these plant lines, we showed accumulation of the OXI1 protein in seedlings after wounding (Fig. S2). Co‐immunoprecipitation experiments were then carried out using OXI1pro:HA‐OXI1 seedlings wounded for either 30 min or 1 h. Even under these conditions or when using different extraction buffers, we could not find OXI1 in the same complex with MPK3 or MPK6 proteins (data not shown). However, the interaction between OXI1 and MAPK proteins could be transient and therefore difficult to detect.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The coding sequence from OXI1 (At3g25250) or PTI1‐4 (At2g47060) was cloned in the pBD‐GAL4 cam (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and were each used as bait to screen an Arabidopsis pACT2 cDNA library [CITATION]. The yeast strain PJ69‐4A [CITATION] containing either pBD‐OXI1 or pBD‐PTI1‐4 was transformed with the pACT2 cDNA library [CITATION] and was screened for HIS auxotrophy. To confirm the interaction, the transformants were grown overnight at 30 °C in synthetic medium with dextrose (SD medium; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, Difco Laboratories Ltd, West Molesey, Surrey, England; 2% dextrose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate) supplemented with the required amino acids. Ten microlitres of the suspension were then spotted on to SD agar plates lacking tryptophan, leucine and adenine and the cells were grown for 3 days at 30 °C. β‐galactosidase agarose overlay assays were performed as described in the Herskowitz laboratory protocol (http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/labs/herskowitz/xgalagar.html). Plasmids from positive yeast colonies were rescued and the cDNA inserts were identified by sequencing.  OXI1, PTI1‐4, MPK3 and MPK6 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the pGEX4‐T1 vector (Amersham Bioscience, Little Chalfont, UK). OXI1 and PTI1‐4 were expressed as HIS fusion proteins in the pET28a (+) vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The OXIK45R mutations were introduced into GST‐OXI1 or HIS‐OXI1 constructs using the QuickChange site‐directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). GST‐ and HIS‐tagged constructs were transformed into the E. coli strain BL‐21 codon plus (Stratagene). Expression and purification of the GST‐tagged proteins was carried out as described previously [CITATION]. The HIS‐tagged proteins were produced according to the manufacturer’s manual (The QIAexpressionistTM; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). GST alone or GST‐tagged proteins were mixed with HIS‐tagged proteins in 200 μL wash buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P‐40) and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 20 μL of glutathione‐sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were washed three times in wash buffer and denatured with SDS loading buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) by electroblotting. Membranes were probed with either anti‐HIS monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or with anti‐GST monoclonal IgG (nanoTools Antikörpertechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Teningen, Germany). Membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence, as recommended by the manufacturer (Gene Image, Amersham Biosciences).  Purified proteins were mixed together in 20 μL kinase buffer [50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm ATP and 0.1 μL mCi [γ32P]‐ATP (1 μCi)] and 1 μL MBP (10 mg·mL) when required. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and were then stopped by adding SDS loading buffer. The reaction products were separated by SDS/PAGE and analysed by autoradiography and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining.  The OXI1 and PTI1‐4 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from total cDNA derived from Col‐0 seedlings. The OXI1 coding sequence was cloned EcoRI‐SalI into pAD, pBD (Stratagene), pGEX‐4T‐1 and pET‐28a (EcoRI‐SalI/XhoI). The lysine 45 (K45R) codon from OXI1 was changed to arginine by site‐directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The PTI1‐4 coding sequence was cloned SalI‐PstI into pAD, pBD (Stratagene) and BamHI‐SalI into pGEX‐4T‐1 and pET‐28a (BamHI‐SalI/XhoI). ORFs of different MAPKs used were cloned as described previously [CITATION].  The 35S promoter and terminator of the pRT101 vector was cloned SalI/XhoI‐NotI into the binary vector pGreenII 0029 [CITATION]. The MYC tag was cloned SmaI‐XbaI into this modified pGreenII 0029 vector. OXI1 was cloned in frame to a MYC C‐terminal tag EcoRI‐SmaI. PTI1‐4 was first cloned in the pRT101 vector SacI‐SmaI in frame to a MYC C‐terminal tag. The 35Spro:Pti1‐4‐MYC fragment was cloned HindIII in pGreenII 0029.  For OXI1pro:GUS and PTI1‐4pro:GUS, the intron‐containing GUS gene was cloned into the binary vector pGreenII 0029. A 2.2 Kb region upstream of the OXI1 (At3g25250) translational start was amplified by PCR from genomic Arabidopsis Col‐0 DNA and subcloned BamHI‐XhoI in front of the GUS gene. For PTI1‐4, a 1.8 Kb region upstream of the PTI1‐4 (At2g47060) translational start was subcloned EcoRI‐XhoI.  The 2.2 Kb OXI1 promoter and the genomic sequence of OXI1 with the 5′UTR and 3′UTR was amplified by PCR and cloned in the pCambia 3300. The HA tag was cloned at the SalI site found at the ATG site of OXI1.  The A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia 0 was used in all the experiments. Plants were transformed using the floral dipping method [CITATION]. OXI‐MYC and PTI1‐4‐MYC constructs were expressed in plants under the control of the 35S promoter from the binary vector pGreenII 0029. HA‐OXI1 was also expressed in plants under the control of its own promoter from the binary vector pCambia 3300. In addition, plants co‐expressing 35Spro:PTI1‐4‐MYC and OXI1pro:HA‐OXI1 constructs were generated.  Seeds were germinated in 0.5× Murashige Skoog medium (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 1% sucrose and 0.7% agar. The seeds were stratified at 4 °C for 72 h and were then transferred to 22 °C under long day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) for germination and growth. For stress treatments, 10‐day‐old seedlings of Col‐0 were transferred in water overnight. They were treated in the morning with H2O2 (10 mm), celullase (0.1%) or were wounded with forceps and used for quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR analysis.  Root extracts were prepared in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P‐40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and proteinase inhibitor mix (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). After centrifugation at 20 000 g for 30 min, the supernatant was immediately used for further experiments. Protein extracts (500 μg) were precleared with 40 μL protein A‐sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, then immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence of anti‐HA IgG (Covance Carnegie Center Princeton, New Jersey, USA) and 40 μL protein A‐sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitation of MPK3 and MPK6 was carried out with anti‐AtMPK3 and anti‐AtMPK6 IgGs (Sigma). Samples were washed three times with extraction buffer and subjected to immunoblotting.  Plant tissues were fixed in 90% acetone for 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and subsequently stained for up to 16 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mm K3Fe(CN6), 2 mm K4Fe(CN6) containing 1 mm 5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indolyl‐d‐glucuronide (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands). Tissues were cleared in ethanol and visualized with a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ16FA).  RNA was isolated from seedlings according to manufacturer’s instruction using the Tripure reagent (Roche). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg RNA using the Retroscript cDNA synthesis Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Transcript abundance was measured by real‐time quantitative RT‐PCR using Quantitect SYBR Green Reagent (Qiagen) in a Rotorgene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences, Concorde, NSW). Relative expression was calculated with the 2‐delta‐delta CT method [CITATION] using the ACTIN2 gene as an internal standard. PCRs were performed using the following primers: ACT2 (At3g18780): 5‐ACATTGTGCTCAGTGGTGGA‐3 and 5‐CTGAGGGAAGCAAGAATGGA‐3, OXI1 (At3g25250): 5‐GACGAGATTATCAGATTTTACGC‐3 and 5‐AACTGGTGAAGCGGAAGAGAC‐3, PTI1‐4 (At2g47060): 5‐CCCCAAAGAAAATGAGTTGCT‐3 and 5‐GCATCATTTCCTGGAGGAAAG‐3.
