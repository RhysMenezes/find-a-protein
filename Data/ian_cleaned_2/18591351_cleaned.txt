!~ABS~! Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope (NE) reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the NE and is associated with the outer surface of the NE in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip NE requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain–interacting proteins (WIPs). We have now identified, by tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP NE association in root tip cells. A combination of loss-of-function mutant analysis and protein interaction data indicates that at least one member of each NE-associated CC-TMD protein family is required for RanGAP targeting in root tip cells, while both families are dispensable in other plant tissues. This suggests an unanticipated complexity of RanGAP NE targeting in higher plant cells, contrasting both the single nucleoporin anchor in metazoans and the lack of targeting in fungi and proposes an early evolutionary divergence of the underlying plant and animal mechanisms.
!~RES~! To identify proteins associated with WPP2 in Arabidopsis, transgenic plants containing WPP2 fused to a tandem affinity purification tag (CITATION) were created. After two purification steps using protein A and the calmodulin binding domain of the fusion protein, eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Silver-stained bands were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. Obtained peptide sequences were used for NIH nonredundant database search and protein identification. At5g11390 was identified in a 90-kD band based on the alignment of four peptides corresponding to its deduced amino acid sequence (Figures 1A and 1B ). At1g68910 matched a single peptide identified in two different excised slices: 90 and 85 kD. The two proteins have a high percentage of amino acid sequence identity (34%) and similarity (56%). [[FIGURE]] The two proteins are characterized by a presence of a long predicted coiled-coil domain (Figure 1C; CITATION) and a C-terminal putative transmembrane domain (Figure 1B). Based on the position of the predicted transmembrane domain, they can be further classified as tail-anchored proteins (CITATION) and were named WIT1 (At5g11390) and WIT2 (At1g68910) for WPP domain–interacting tail-anchored proteins. No significant similarity of the WIT amino acid sequence outside the coiled-coil region was detected with any sequence present in GenBank. Based on domain organization, WIT1 and WIT2 resemble the recently described WIP protein family (Figure 1C; CITATION). However, the two protein families have no amino acid similarity outside the coiled-coil domain. mRNA expression patterns based on microarray data obtained from the Genevestigator database (CITATION) show that WIT1 and WIT2 are expressed ubiquitously in all Arabidopsis organs and developmental stages (see Supplemental Table 1 online). The expression level is consistently higher for WIT1 than for WIT2. WIT1 protein was detected in all organs tested, with a high level in roots and a lower level in rosette leaves, in agreement with the mRNA data (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). To address the specificity of the WIT1–WPP2 interaction, we tested binding of WIT1 to all WPP domain protein family members and RanGAP1/RanGAP2 by yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. In yeast two-hybrid assays, WIT1 interacted with WPP1 and WPP2 but not with WPP3 (Figure 2A ). WIT1 also bound to full-length RanGAP1 and RanGAP2 and to the WPP domain of RanGAP1 (RanGAP1ΔC, amino acids 1 to 119) but not RanGAP1ΔN (amino acids 120 to 535, RanGAP1 without the WPP domain). [[FIGURE]] Since both the WIT and the WIP protein families contain predicted coiled-coil domains with possible dimerization ability, the interaction of WIT1 with WIP proteins was also tested. WIT1 interacted with WIP2a but not with WIP3 (Figure 2A). Since both WIT1 and WIP1 alone activate the reporter genes when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (data not shown), their interaction could not be tested using this assay. These data show that WIT1 binds to the same WPP proteins that interact with the WIP family members (CITATION) and are targeted to the NE and that, as for WIP family members, the WPP domain of RanGAP1 is necessary and sufficient for binding. To test protein–protein interactions in planta, we employed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana (Figures 2B to 2D) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-WIT1–expressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Figure 2E). Co-IP from N. benthamiana showed that WIT1 interacted with both RanGAP1 and RanGAP2 as well as with WIP protein family members and with itself (Figures 2B and 2C). While capable of interacting with WIT1, WIP1 did not show homodimerization ability in the same assay (Figure 2D). Affinity of RanGAP1 binding for WIT1 was much reduced by the WPP/AAP mutation in the WPP domain, which was shown to disrupt NE association (CITATION; Figure 2B). Co-IP from Arabidopsis confirmed the interaction between GFP-WIT1 and endogenous RanGAP1 and WIP1 (Figure 2E). To explore the localization of WIT1 in Arabidopsis, an anti-WIT1 antibody was generated using a partial cDNA encoding amino acids 1 to 317, fused with a His tag and expressed in Escherichia coli. The anti-WIT1 antibody recognized a protein of ∼80 kD in wild-type Arabidopsis, while no protein of the same size was detected in the wit1-1 mutant (see below). We used both live cell imaging and immunofluorescence with anti-WIT1 or anti-GFP to characterize the subcellular localization of endogenous WIT1 and of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S promoter)–driven GFP-WIT1 in root tip cells of Arabidopsis seedlings. Figure 3A shows that endogenous WIT1 associated with the NE in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells in roots. Similarly, GFP-WIT1 was clearly located at the NE (Figure 3B). During cytokinesis, it appeared that GFP-WIT1 was concentrated around the cell plate. Monoclonal antitubulin was used to mark the position of the phragmoplast (Figure 3B). Live imaging of GFP-WIT1 transgenic roots suggested that GFP-WIT1 decorated NEs in a dotted pattern (Figure 3C), indicative of an association with nuclear pores. [[FIGURE]] To investigate domain requirement for NE targeting, we fused different WIT1 deletion constructs to GFP and visualized them in root cells of transgenic Arabidopsis. The construct GFP-WIT1ΔTM represents the fusion of GFP with N-terminal part of WIT1 corresponding to amino acids 1 to 660, and GFP-TMWIT1 has GFP fused to the C-terminal 43 amino acids of WIT1. The data showed that a fraction of GFP-TMWIT1 was still associated with the nuclear periphery (Figure 3D). However, more signal was now detected in the cytoplasm and possibly the plasma membrane. When the putative transmembrane domain was deleted, the remaining protein GFP-WIT1ΔTM still associated with the NE (Figure 3D). We concluded that the C-terminal TMD of WIT1 was partially sufficient for targeting GFP to the nuclear periphery but was not necessary for NE association of WIT1. One possible explanation is that WIT1 is held at the NE via additional protein–protein interaction (see below). Our previous study showed that in root tip cells of a wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 triple mutant, RanGAP1 is absent from the NE, while its association with the NE in differentiated root cells or with the cell plate during cytokinesis is not changed (CITATION). These data indicate that, although RanGAP NE anchoring at the root tip depends on WIP family members, additional activities must exist for NE association in differentiated cells. Therefore, we tested whether WIT family members play roles in anchoring RanGAP1 at the NE during interphase or at other RanGAP1 locations during mitosis. T-DNA insertion lines for WIT1 and WIT2 were identified from the SALK and GABI-Kat collection, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). The T-DNA in line 470E06 (wit1-1) is inserted within the first coding exon of WIT1, while the T-DNA in line SALK_127765 (wit2-1) is in the second coding exon of WIT2 (Figure 4A ). In wit1-1, no WIT1 mRNA across the T-DNA insertion could be detected (Figure 4B, top left panel). In an immunoblot with the anti-WIT1 antibody, a band of 80 kD corresponding to WIT1 was detected in wild-type Arabidopsis but not in the wit1-1 mutant (Figure 4B, right panel). Therefore, we conclude that wit1-1 represents a null mutation. In wit2-1, no WIT2 mRNA could be detected, either across the insertion or downstream of the insertion, again consistent with a knockout mutation (Figure 4B, bottom left panel). At the same time in wit2-1, WIT1 was expressed at the wild-type level, additionally confirming the specificity of the anti-WIT1 antibody to WIT1 (Figure 4B, right panel). [[FIGURE]] RanGAP1 localization in individual homozygous insertion lines was tested by immunofluorescence, but no significant difference was observed in either undifferentiated or differentiated root cells compared with wild-type plants (data not shown). Therefore, two homozygous lines were crossed to obtain a wit1-1 wit2-1 double mutant. Surprisingly, endogenous RanGAP1 did not accumulate at the NE in root tip cells of the wit1-1 wit2-1 double mutant line (Figure 4C). By contrast, the localization of endogenous RanGAP1 was not changed in differentiated root cells, and RanGAP1 association with the cell plate was not lost in the mitotic root cells of the wit1-1 wit2-1 double mutant (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). To confirm that the lack of RanGAP1 NE targeting in the root tip cells was due to the absence of WIT1 and WIT2 proteins, we transformed the wit1-1 wit2-1 double mutant with a construct expressing GFP-WIT1 under the control of the 35S promoter. Figure 4D shows that in the wit1-1 wit2-1 double mutant expressing GFP-WIT1, RanGAP1 NE association was reestablished in root tip cells. This clearly demonstrates that GFP-WIT1 is functional and that WIT1 is necessary for RanGAP1 NE targeting in root tip cells. Since wit1-1 wit2-1 phenocopies wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 in terms of mislocalization of RanGAP1 in root tip cells (CITATION), we tested whether in a wit1-1 wit2-1 double mutant WIP1 protein level is affected, whether the interaction between WIP1 and RanGAP1 is lost, and whether WIP1 is dislocated from the NE. Immunoblot data showed that the endogenous WIP1 protein level was not changed in wit1-1 wit2-1 (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). Co-IP from the wild type and wit1-1 wit2-1 indicated that the interaction between endogenous RanGAP1 and WIP1 was not affected (see Supplemental Figure 3B online). To analyze the localization of WIP1 in wit1-1 wit2-1, we transformed wit1-1 wit2-1 with a construct expressing GFP-WIP1 under the control of the 35S promoter. Supplemental Figure 3C online shows that GFP-WIP1 was properly targeted to the NE in wit1-1 wit2-1. However, although 35S promoter–driven expression of GFP-WIP1 complements the wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 phenotype (CITATION), it could not compensate for the loss of WIT1 and WIT2, and RanGAP1 NE association was not reestablished in root tip cells (see Supplemental Figure 3C online). Therefore, we concluded that WIT1 and WIT2 are required for RanGAP1 NE targeting in root tip cells in a mechanism independent of WIP1 protein abundance and NE targeting. To explore the functional relationship between members of the WIP and WIT protein families, we investigated the localization and expression level of endogenous WIT1 in the wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 mutant. Interestingly, WIT1 accumulation at the NE was greatly reduced in root tip cells of wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 (Figure 5A ). Immunoblot data showed that endogenous WIT1 expression level was significantly decreased in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 compared with the wild type. The corresponding WIT1 mRNA was detected in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 (Figure 5B). [[FIGURE]] Based on these findings, it is formally possible that the delocalization of RanGAP1 in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 is caused by the reduction of WIT1 and that WIT1 and not a WIP family member is the actual anchor of RanGAP at the NE. To test this hypothesis, we expressed 35S promoter–driven GFP-WIT1 in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1. If reduction of WIT1 is the only cause of RanGAP delocalization in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1, we reasoned that overexpression of GFP-WIT1 should restore RanGAP NE targeting in the root tip. First, we tested the level and localization of GFP-WIT1. A line was identified in which GFP-WIT1 accumulated in the wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 background to a level comparable to WIT1 in wild-type plants (Figure 5C). Next, we analyzed the localization of GFP-WIT1 in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1. Figure 5D shows that GFP-WIT1 was properly targeted to the NE in the root tips, suggesting that reduction of NE-associated WIT1 in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 was largely due to reduced protein abundance and not reduced NE targeting. We also tested the interaction of GFP-WIT1 with RanGAP1 in the wild type and wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 triple mutant background. RanGAP1 was coimmunoprecipitated by GFP-WIT1 from both the wild type and wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1, indicating that GFP-WIT1 could bind RanGAP1 independent of WIP family members (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). Finally, we analyzed the localization of RanGAP1 in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1/35S-GFP-WIT1 by immunofluorescence. Clearly, RanGAP1 was absent from the NE of root tip cells despite the presence of GFP-WIT1 at the NE (Figure 5E). This indicates that WIT1 is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of WIP1/WIP2/WIP3 and suggests that RanGAP NE targeting in root tip cells requires the activity of at least one member of each protein family. An additional indication that the reduced WIT1 level was not sufficient to cause RanGAP1 delocalization in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 came from the analysis of WIT1 protein level in wip double mutants and the wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 triple mutant expressing 35S promoter–driven GFP-WIP1, GFP-WIP2a, or GFP-WIP3 (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). Although WIT1 protein level was reduced to a comparable level in wip1-1 wip2-1, wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1, wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1/GFP-WIP2a, and wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1/GFP-WIP3, RanGAP1 delocalization can be observed only in wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 (CITATION), suggesting that WIT1 reduction is not its sole cause. The simplest model consistent with all presented data is therefore that a critical step of RanGAP anchoring to the NE in the root tips of Arabidopsis requires a complex consisting of at least one WIP and one WIT family member. The hypothesis that RanGAP anchoring in the specific region of the root of Arabidopsis requires at least one of both WIP and WIT family members was further tested in the heterologous system of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration. We reasoned that although WIT1 itself was capable of binding RanGAP1 in this system (see Figure 2B), coexpression of WIP1 with WIT1 might increase the affinity of WIT1 for RanGAP1. Figure 6 shows that, indeed, in the presence of WIP1, WIT1 immunoprecipitated about two times more RanGAP1 than when only WIT1 and RanGAP1 were coexpressed, suggesting that WIP1 increases the binding affinity of WIT1 and RanGAP1.

!~MM~! The related sequences of WIT1 (At5g11390) and WIT2 (At1g68910) were identified based on BLAST and WU-BLAST searches. No significant similarity outside the coiled-coil region was noticed with any other protein sequences in GenBank, except for putative WIT orthologs from other plant species, which were identified using WU-BLAST search performed with The Institute for Genomic Research Plant Transcript Assemblies (http://tigrblast.tigr.org/euk-blast/plantta_blast.cgi). Sequence alignments were performed using MEGALIGN (DNASTAR) using the Clustal algorithm as previously described (CITATION). The amino acid sequence identity and similarity was determined using bl2seq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi). The coiled-coil prediction was performed using Multicoil (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/multicoil/cgi-bin/multicoil.cgi), and the transmembrane domain prediction was accessed through the Aramemnon database (http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de/). Quantity One 4.1.1 (Bio-Rad) was used for the quantification of the co-IP signals in Figure 6. The WIT1 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR from Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype) root RNA into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The insert was confirmed by sequencing. To construct N-terminal GFP fusion proteins, we moved each cDNA into pK7WGF2 (CITATION) by LR recombination cloning (Invitrogen). All GFP fusions with WIT1 fragments were generated in the same way. GFP-WIP1, GFP-WIP2a, and GFP-WIP3 were described previously (CITATION). RanGAP1-GFP cloning and mutagenesis was also described previously (CITATION). WIT1 cDNA was moved into ProQuest Y2H vectors pDEST22 and pDEST32 (Invitrogen) by LR recombination for expression of GAL4 AD and BD fusion proteins. BD-RanGAP1, BD-RanGAP1ΔN, BD-N of RanGAP1, BD-RanGAP2, BD-WIP2a, BD-WIP3, BD-WPP1, BD-WPP2, and BD-WPP3 were previously described (CITATION). The WIT1 cDNA was moved into pEarleyGate202 vector (CITATION). The WPP2 gene was subcloned from pBD-GAL4 vector (CITATION) to pENTR3C vector (Invitrogen), using the EcoRI restriction site. The N-terminal TAP-WPP2 fusion construct was obtained by LR recombination (Invitrogen) with the NTAPi binary vector (CITATION). See Supplemental Table 2 online for detailed description of all constructs used. All plasmid pairs were transformed into the yeast strain PJ694A (CITATION) in accordance with published protocols (CITATION). Handling of yeast cultures and plate growth assays were as described in the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook (1996). For WIT1 antibody production, a partial protein consisting of the N-terminal 317 amino acids was expressed as a His tag fusion protein from pDEST17 (Invitrogen). The pellet from a 500+mL culture expressing His-WIT1 was used for purification with Ni-NTA resin under denaturing conditions following the protocol of the QIAexpressionist handbook (Qiagen). After purification and preparative SDS-PAGE, a rabbit antiserum (OSU 206) was produced by Cocalico Biologicals. The T-DNA GABI-Kat line 470E06 (wit1-1) was acquired from the Max Plank Institute for Plant Breeding Research, and the T-DNA SALK_line 127765 (wit2-1) was acquired from the ABRC. The double mutant line wit1-1 wit2-1 was obtained as F2 progeny of a cross between wit1-1 and wit2-1. The triple-mutant line wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 was described previously (CITATION). Plasmids expressing TAP-WPP2, GFP-WIT1, GFP-WIT1ΔTM, and GFP-TMWIT1 were mobilized into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI. Transconjugants were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL spectinomycin, 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Arabidopsis Columbia wild-type, wit1-1 wit2-1, and wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 were transformed by floral dipping (CITATION) and selected by kanamycin or BASTA resistance. WIT1 in pEarlyGate202 or WIP1 in pH2GW7,0 were transformed into the Agrobacterium strain ABI. Transconjugants were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL spectinomycin, 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. The Agrobacterium strains transformed with GFP-WIP1, GFP-WIP2a GFP-WIP3, RanGAP1-GFP, RanGAP1(WPP/AAP), and GFP-RanGAP2 were described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Agrobacterium cultures containing different plasmids were either infiltrated or coinfiltrated transiently into N. benthamiana leaves as described previously (CITATION). Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) from rosette leaves of 30-d-old Arabidopsis plants grown on soil or from roots of 14-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings. After digestion with DNase I (amplification grade; Invitrogen), cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) primer and the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). cDNA templates were amplified with gene-specific primers: 5′-CACCATGGAAACAGAAACGGAACATGATAGA-3′ and 5′-CTGACCCAAAGATTGTTCAGTAGCATTC-3′ were used for WIT1 spanning the insertion site; 5′-GAATATGTGAAGTCAGCTGAACAAAAGCT-3′ and 5′-GTTGAGTTCAGAGTTTGTGGTAGA-3′ were used for WIT2 spanning the insertion site; 5′-TCTACCACAAACTCTGAACTCAAC-3′ and 5′-TTAATAAGTCACACCAAAGAATGAACAAAACAGC-3′ were used for WIT2 3′ to the insertion site; 5′-CTCAAGAGGTTCTCAGCAGTA-3′ and 5′-TCACCTTCTTCATCCGCAGTT-3′ were used for tubulin product. Twenty five grams (fresh weight) of TAP-WPP2 Arabidopsis seedlings grown in liquid Murashige and Skoog medium for 14 d under continuous white light was ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder. Total proteins were extracted using 2.5 volumes of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.25% dodecyl maltoside [Sigma-Aldrich], protease inhibitor cocktail [1:100; Sigma-Aldrich], 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 2 μg/μL antipain, 2 μg/μL leupeptin, 2 μg/μL aprotinin, 10 μM chymostatin, and 1 μM E-64 [Sigma-Aldrich]) by occasional vortexing for 30 min at 4°C. After filtration through Miracloth, the extract was centrifuged at 1450g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with 1.25 mL IgG-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. IgG-agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation at 150g for 3 min at 4°C, washed three times with 30 mL washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once with 30 mL TEV cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, and 1 μM E-64). TAP-tagged proteins were released from IgG beads by cleavage with 800 units of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) in 12 mL of TEV cleavage buffer for 3 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. After centrifugation at 150g for 3 min at 4°C, the supernatant was diluted with 3 volumes of Calmodulin binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM Mg-acetate, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and 1.2 μL of 2.5 M CaCl2 per mL supernatant was added to titrate EDTA from the TEV cleavage buffer. The mixture was incubated with 1.25 mL Calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) for 1 h at 4°C with gentle rotation, after which it was packed into a Poly-prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed two times with 50 mL Calmodulin binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted three times with 4 mL Calmodulin elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM Mg-acetate, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The eluate was concentrated using an iCON Concentrator 7 mL/9 K (Pierce). Proteins were separated using preparative SDS-PAGE gel and silver stained with Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad). In-gel digests were performed by incubation of the gel slices at 37°C overnight with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega). The resulting peptide mixture was extracted from the gel, concentrated using Captrap peptide trap (Michrom Bioresources), and separated on a BioBasic C18 PicoFrit microcapillary column (New Objective) by a 60-min gradient of 7 to 93% acetonitrile in water and 0.1% formic acid. Eluting peptides were electrosprayed directly into a DECA-XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Full mass spectrometry as well as tandem mass spectrometry spectra were recorded. BioWorks 3.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) based on the SEQUEST algorithm was used for data analysis. The search was performed using the NIH nonredundant database. Peptide/spectra matches were retained if the following criteria were met: XCor scores higher than 1.5 for peptides charged +1, higher than 2.0 for peptides charged +2, higher than 2.5 for peptides charged +3, Delta Cn scores higher than 0.08, and peptide probability lower than 0.05. Arabidopsis Columbia wild-type expressing GFP-WIT1 or GFP and GFP-WIT1–transformed wip1-1 wip2-1 wip3-1 triple mutant plants were grown in constant light for 14 d. N. benthamiana plants were grown for 3 d after agroinfiltration was performed. Whole Arabidopsis seedling or infiltrated leaves of N. benthamiana were collected and ground into fine powders. Extracts for co-IP were prepared at 4°C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoprecipitates from both Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana were prepared either with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (A11120; Molecular Probes), polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam Cambridge), or anti-WIT1 or anti-WIP1 antibody bound to protein A-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with 1 to 3 h binding. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, and probed with anti-WIT1 (1:2000), anti-RanGAP1 (1:3000), anti-WIP1 (1:2000), or anti-FLAG M2-HRP (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody. Ponceau staining was performed with Ponceau S solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature. Two types of anti-GFP antibodies were used for detection of immunoprecipitates: polyclonal (A11122, 1:4000; Molecular Probes) and monoclonal (MO48-3, 1:1000; Medical and Biological Laboratories). A dilution of 1:25,000 was used for the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) was used as HRP detection system. Whole-mount immunolocalization in Arabidopsis roots was performed as described (CITATION). Polyclonal anti-RanGAP1 (1:200), polyclonal anti-WIT1 (1:400), monoclonal anti-tubulin (DM1A, 1:250; Sigma-Aldrich), polyclonal anti-GFP (A11122, 1:200; Molecular Probes), and monoclonal anti-GFP (A11120, 1:100; Molecular Probes) primary antibodies and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1:200; Molecular Probes) were used. Images were collected from a PCM 2000/Nikon Eclipse E600 confocal laser scanning microscope as described (CITATION). Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers NP_196700 (At5g11390, WIT1), NP_177057 (At1g68910, WIT2), BT003145 (WIP1), AY735734 (WIP2a), AY045697 (WIP3), NP_191872.1 (RanGAP1), NP_197433.1 (RanGAP2), NP_568959.1 (tubulin), NP_199121.1 (WPP1), NP_564498.1 (WPP2), and NP_568504.1 (WPP3).
