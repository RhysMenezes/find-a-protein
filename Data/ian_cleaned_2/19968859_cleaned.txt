!~ABS~! Starch synthase III from Arabidopsis thaliana contains an N‐terminal region, including three in‐tandem starch‐binding domains, followed by a C‐terminal catalytic domain. We have reported previously that starch‐binding domains may be involved in the regulation of starch synthase III function. In this work, we analyzed the existence of protein interactions between both domains using pull‐down assays, far western blotting and co‐expression of the full and truncated starch‐binding domains with the catalytic domain. Pull‐down assays and co‐purification analysis showed that the D(316–344) and D(495–535) regions in the D2 and D3 domains, respectively, but not the individual starch‐binding domains, are involved in the interaction with the catalytic domain. We also determined that the residues W366 and Y394 in the D2 domain are important in starch binding. Moreover, the co‐purified catalytic domain plus site‐directed mutants of the D123 protein lacking these aromatic residues showed that W366 was key to the apparent affinity for the polysaccharide substrate of starch synthase III, whereas either of these amino acid residues altered ADP‐glucose kinetics. In addition, the analysis of full‐length and truncated proteins showed an almost complete restoration of the apparent affinity for the substrates and Vmax of starch synthase III. The results presented here suggest that the interaction of the N‐terminal starch‐binding domains, particularly the D(316–344) and D(495–535) regions, with the catalytic domains, as well as the full integrity of the starch‐binding capacity of the D2 domain, are involved in the modulation of starch synthase III activity.

!~RES~! We propose that the N‐terminal SBDs have a regulatory role, modulating the catalytic properties of the C‐terminal domain of SSIII, which contains the catalytic site. Thus, we evaluated possible intramolecular interactions between the N‐terminal SBDs and the C‐terminal CD, and their effect on the regulatory properties of SSIII. To investigate this, we used the full N‐terminal region of SSIII (D123 protein, containing the three SBDs, residues 22–575), CD (residues 576–1025) and different truncated and modified SBD proteins, as shown in Fig. 1.  [[FIGURE]] First, we explored a potential protein–protein interaction between D123 and CD. We used two independent methods: (i) an in vitro pull‐down assay using purified D123 protein and an extract expressing the recombinant CD protein; and (ii) a far western blotting assay in parallel with the pull‐down technique to demonstrate the direct interaction of D123 with CD (Fig. 2). After incubation of the CD extract with the Ni2+ resin containing D123, two protein bands were observed after SDS‐PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A, lane 1): a 64 kDa band, corresponding to D123, and a 48 kDa band, corresponding to the CD protein as detected by western blot analysis (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). The D123 protein bound to the Ni2+ resin incubated with an Escherichia coli extract not expressing CD (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and the Ni2+ resin with the extract alone (Fig. 2A, lane 3) did not show the presence of any protein band, indicating that the interaction is specific. Controls using pre‐immune serum were consistently negative (not shown). Furthermore, the interaction between D123 and CD was confirmed by far western blotting experiments. Recombinant CDHis was purified, electrophoresed by SDS‐PAGE and transferred to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). The membrane in lane 1 was incubated with an E. coli extract expressing the D123 protein, blocked and finally developed using an anti‐D123 serum. A band corresponding to the D123 protein was detected (Fig. 2B, lane 1) with antibodies raised against Agrobacterium tumefaciens glycogen synthase (anti‐GS serum, Fig. 2B, lane 2). The rf value for this band matches that expected for the CDHis protein. A control in which the CD protein was detected with anti‐D123 serum was included to show the specificity of the antibodies used (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Thus, far western experiments confirmed the results obtained in the pull‐down assays, showing that there is a physical interaction between the N‐ and C‐terminal domains of SSIII in vitro.  [[FIGURE]] In order to identify the SBD region required for the SBD–CD interaction, we performed pull‐down assays using the N‐terminal‐truncated proteins D23, D1, D2 and D3. We determined a positive interaction between protein D23 and CD (Fig. 2C, lane 1), and this result was also confirmed by far western blotting (Fig. 2D). However, a lack of interaction was observed in pull‐down experiments in which D1, D2 or D3 proteins bound to an Ni2+ resin were incubated in the presence of the cell extract containing recombinant CD (Fig. 2E). SDS‐PAGE analysis did not reveal the presence of any protein band, indicating that the individual SBDs are unable to interact with CD under these experimental conditions.  To further investigate which region in the D23 protein contains the interaction domain, we performed pull‐down assays using truncated proteins, named St2.1, St2.2, St2.3, St3.2 and St3.3 (see Fig. 1). We determined a positive interaction between St2.1 and St3.3 with CD (Fig. 3A, B), whereas St2.2, St2.3 and St3.2 proteins showed no interaction with CD (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that two long loop regions are required to interact with CD (Fig. 3D): they span residues 316–344 in the D2 domain [D(316–344)] and residues 495–535 in the D3 domain [D(495–535)].  [[FIGURE]] Protein–protein interaction assays showed the existence of two different loop regions in D2 [D(316–344)] and D3 [D(495–535)], which are involved in the SBD–CD interaction in vitro. To evaluate the ability of SBDs and CD to interact in bacterial cells, we co‐expressed the different His‐tagged SBD proteins and untagged CD protein (cloned in the compatible pRSFDuet vector) in E. coli BL21‐(DE3)‐RIL cells. Purification was performed using an Ni2+ resin, as employed previously for the isolation of the individual recombinant proteins. SDS‐PAGE and western blot analysis revealed the presence of D123 and CD, suggesting that their interaction can also occur in vivo (Fig. 4, lane D123). We also determined that D23, St2.1 and St3.3 proteins are able to interact with the CD fragment when co‐purified from E. coli cells (Fig. 4, lanes D23, St2.1 and St3.3). Although the CD peptide was co‐expressed successfully with D3, D2, D1, St2.2, St2.3 and St3.2 proteins, as revealed by denatured gel electrophoresis and western blot (not shown), we did not observe any co‐purified protein band in SDS‐PAGE analysis and western blot experiments (Fig. 4). These data are in agreement with the pull‐down and far western assays, showing a lack of interaction for the individual SBDs and also in the absence of the D(316–344) and D(495–535) regions of the D2 and D3 domains, respectively.  [[FIGURE]] Kinetic parameters of co‐expressed CD with D123 and truncated SBD proteins were determined. In the presence of a variable concentration of the polysaccharide, all the proteins displayed Michaelian kinetics. CD+D123 showed an S0.5 value for glycogen of 0.32 ± 0.12 mg·mL−1 (Table 1), not significantly different from the S0.5 value obtained for the full‐length enzyme CD–D123 (0.28 ± 0.05 mg·mL−1). CD+D123 displayed almost a six‐fold decrease in S0.5 for glycogen with respect to CD alone (2.69 ± 0.16 mg·mL−1), indicating that the addition of D123 increases the apparent affinity of the CD protein for the polysaccharide. However, the CD+D123 protein only partially restored the Vmax value of the full‐length enzyme (about a 10‐fold increase in the Vmax value with respect to CD, but a nearly 10‐fold lower Vmax value with respect to the CD–D123 enzyme; Table 1).  Table 1 also lists the kinetic parameters of CD+D23 which lacks the D1 domain in the SBD peptide. This protein showed an S0.5 value for glycogen of 0.78 ± 0.13 mg·mL−1 and a Vmax value of 0.30 ± 0.07 U·mg−1. Thus, CD+D23 completely restored the apparent affinity for glycogen with respect to the CD–D23 protein and, partially, its Vmax value (Table 1). Indeed, we determined the kinetic parameters of CD+St2.1 and CD+St3.3. Both proteins showed a slight increase in the S0.5 value for glycogen with respect to the CD+D23 protein; a partial restoration of the Vmax value with respect to the CD–D23 protein was also observed (Table 1).  It is worth mentioning that we also determined the kinetic parameters of the SBD proteins and CD purified separately and mixed in a test‐tube. We determined that, under saturating conditions of both substrates, the addition of 3 : 1, 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 molar amounts of the different SBD proteins plus CD in the test‐tube produced similar kinetic parameters to those obtained from the co‐purified enzymes. We also assayed the activity of the CD plus D3, D2, D1, St2.2, St2.3 and St3.2 proteins co‐expressed or purified separately and mixed in a 1 : 1 molar ratio. In agreement with the results obtained in the protein interaction assays, we could not measure any glycosyltransferase activity in the co‐purification experiments. Moreover, the individual proteins purified separately and mixed in the test‐tube did not show any changes in their kinetic parameters when compared with the CD enzyme (not shown). The latter results agree with the lack of interaction between the individual SBD domains and CD, and also indicate that the presence of D3, D2, D1 or the truncated St2.2, St2.3 or St3.2 proteins alone plus CD does not affect the kinetic parameters for the polysaccharide substrate.  We also determined the kinetic parameters of the truncated CD–St2.1, CD–St2.2 and CD–St2.3 proteins (see Fig. 1). The CD–St2.1 protein showed no significant changes in the S0.5 and Vmax values relative to the CD–D23 enzyme. However, both the CD–St2.2 and CD–St2.3 proteins displayed a decrease in the apparent affinity for glycogen of about three‐fold, and also an eight‐fold decrease in Vmax with respect to the CD–D23 enzyme (Table 1). Thus, the deletion of the D316–344 region dramatically affects both the S0.5 value for glycogen and the Vmax value of the protein, showing similar kinetic parameters when compared with the CD–D3 enzyme (Table 1).  Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters of the different SSIII enzymes for ADPGlc. In contrast with the total restoration of the S0.5 values observed when using glycogen as a nonsaturating substrate, the CD+D123 protein only partially restored the apparent affinity of the full‐length enzyme for ADPGlc. Thus, the CD+D123 protein displayed an S0.5 value about four‐fold higher than CD and about 4.5‐fold lower than the full‐length enzyme (Table 2). Similar results were obtained with CD+D23, CD+St2.1 and CD+3.3 proteins. These enzymes restored only partially the apparent affinity for ADPGlc and the catalytic efficiency with respect to the CD–D23 protein (Table 2). Similar to that observed in the kinetic assays for the polysaccharide substrate, the individual proteins purified separately, CD+D3, CD+D2, CD+D1, CD+St2.2, CD+St2.3 and CD+St3.2, did not show any changes in their kinetic parameters for the sugar nucleotide with respect to CD (not shown).  We also determined the kinetic parameters of the truncated proteins CD–St2.1, CD–St2.2 and CD–St2.3 for ADPGlc. A slight decrease in the S0.5 value for ADPGlc was observed for the CD–St2.1 protein with respect to CD–D23. Indeed, no significant changes in Vmax were observed between these proteins (Table 2). However, both CD–St2.2 and CD–St2.3 showed a decrease of about 30% in S0.5 for ADPGlc, and also a decrease of nearly 10‐fold in Vmax with respect to CD–D23, displaying similar kinetic parameters to those obtained for the CD–D3 enzyme (Table 2).  One of the best‐characterized SBDs is glucoamylase‐1 (GA‐1) from Aspergillus niger, a member of the CBM20 family [CITATION]. It has been established that different tryptophan residues are important for the binding activity and/or stability of this C‐terminal SBD [CITATION-CITATION]. The SBD from GA‐1 contains two independent polysaccharide‐binding sites, which may be structurally and functionally different. It has been described that W590 is essential for binding activity in polysaccharide‐binding site I and W563 is critical for site II, the latter having a tighter binding than site I [CITATION]. Sequence alignment showed that W590 can be replaced by other aromatic residues (tyrosine in D1 and D2 and phenylalanine in D3), whereas W563 is conserved only in D2, but not in the D1 or D3 domains. Moreover, on the basis of bioinformatics analysis, we found a high structural similarity between GA‐1 SBD and the D2 domain from SSIII [CITATION]. Binding assays indicated that D2 has the highest starch‐binding capacity (Kad = 11.8 ± 1.5 mL·g−1), whereas D1 and D3 do not have an important contribution to binding (Kad = 0.6 ± 0.1 and 2.1 ± 0.3 mL·g−1, respectively).  Thus, we decided to eliminate the putative polysaccharide‐binding sites in the D2 domain of the full SBD region from SSIII (W366 and Y394, SSIII numbering). For this purpose, we generated the modified proteins D123W366A, D123Y394A and the double mutant D123W366AY394A.  We characterized the adsorption of the mutated proteins to raw starch at different protein concentrations, and also the effect of these mutations on SSIII kinetics. Figure 5 shows the adsorption isotherms for the binding of D123, D123W366A, D123Y394A and D123W366AY394A. D123 binds starch with high affinity (Kad = 22.0 ± 0.8 mL·g−1, [CITATION]). D123W366A and D123Y394A proteins showed a three‐ and two‐fold decrease in their affinity to starch (Kad = 7.9 ± 1.0 and 11.2 ± 0.9 mL·g−1, respectively), whereas D123W366AY394A showed a significant decrease (almost six‐fold) in its binding affinity (Kad = 3.8 ± 0.6 mL·g−1).  [[FIGURE]] We also determined the effect of mutations in the putative starch‐binding sites I and/or II, and whether they affected SSIII kinetics. First, we confirmed, using pull‐down assays, that the mutations in the starch‐binding residues did not affect the interaction with CD (not shown). The S0.5 value for the acceptor polysaccharides of the CD+D123W366A protein was about five‐fold higher than that of the CD+D123 or full‐length CD–D123 protein. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the S0.5 value for glycogen when using CD+D123Y394A (0.32 ± 0.13 mm) or the nonmutated protein (Table 3). In addition, both CD+D123W366A and CD+D123Y394A proteins showed similar Vmax values when compared with the CD+D123 protein. Thus, both modified proteins partially restored the Vmax values for the CD–D123 enzyme, but displayed about a 12‐fold increase in Vmax with respect to CD alone. Finally, the CD+D123W366AY394A protein showed an S0.5 value for glycogen similar to that of CD (about 10‐fold higher than the S0.5 value for the nonmodified enzyme), an nH value of 1.8 ± 0.4 and a slight decrease in Vmax with respect to the CD+D123 protein (Table 3).  However, no significant changes were observed in the S0.5 values for ADPGlc, compared with the CD+D123 enzyme, when the mutated SBD proteins CD+D123W366A, CD+D123Y394A and CD+D123W366AY394A were assayed. Nevertheless, an increase in nH values was observed (Table 4). Moreover, we observed only slight changes in Vmax values for these enzymes with respect to the CD+D123 protein, suggesting that the mutations did not affect the kinetics for ADPGlc (Table 4).  We also evaluated the kinetic parameters for the full‐length mutated proteins CD–D123W366A, CD–D123Y394A and CD–D123W366AY394A. None of the mutations greatly affected Vmax or nH relative to the values for the CD–D123 enzyme. Moreover, CD–D123W366A and CD–D123W366AY394 showed an increase in S0.5 value for glycogen of about five‐ and 10‐fold, respectively, compared with the CD–123 enzyme (Table 3). However, only about a 20% decrease in S0.5 for ADPGlc was observed for the full‐length mutated proteins (Table 4), in agreement with the results obtained from co‐expression experiments. 
!~MM~! Escherichia coli XL1Blue and BL21‐(DE3)‐RIL strains were used as hosts for this study. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani medium [CITATION]. Expression vectors derived from pET32c contained a C‐terminal His‐tag. The different constructs are shown in Fig. 1. For the co‐expression experiments, CD was cloned as expressed without any tags (see below).  The plasmid named pVAL3 containing the catalytic C‐terminal domain of SSIII (1374 bp) was used as template for cDNA synthesis [CITATION]. cDNA corresponding to CD was PCR amplified using Pfu polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the following primers: CDfw, AGAGCATATGCACATTGTTCAT; CDrv, AAACTCGAGTCACTTGCGTGCAGAGTGATAGAGC. The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the pRSFDuet vector (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). The new vector named pNAL1 encodes CD without any fusion tags. BL21‐(DE3)‐RIL E. coli competent cells were transformed with pNAL1 and used for expression analysis.  Truncated proteins were generated using the following primers: 2.1up, AAACATATGCTATATTACAATAAAAGG; 2.2up, AAACATATGTTATCTATCGTTGTAAAGC; 2.3up, AAACATATGCTTGTTCCTCAAAAACTTCC; 3.3rv, AAACTCGAGGACCTTAGCCGTAGTCTTCAC; 3.2rv, AAACTCGAGTTTTCCATTCAAAACCGTG.  The mutated proteins D123W366A, D123Y394A and the double‐modified protein D123W366AY394A were obtained using the QuickChange II site‐directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The pVAL19 vector which codifies for the D123 protein was used as the template for PCR amplification. The following primers (and their complements) were used (base substitutions in italic): 123W366A, CCAAAGAGCGGAAATTGGGCGTTCGCTGAAGTTG; 123Y394A, CTAAAGGAGCGTTTCTGGCTGACAATAATGGTTAC. The mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Individual recombinant proteins were expressed and purified using a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare Bio‐Sciences, Upsalla, Sweden), as described previously [CITATION]. For co‐expression analysis, the bacterial cells were co‐transformed with pNAL1 (encoding untagged CD) plus pVAL19, pVAL20, pVAL21, pVAL25, pVAL29 and pVAL31–pVAL38 (corresponding to D123, D23, D3, D2, D1, D123W366A, D123Y394A, D123W366AY394A, St2.1, St2.2, St2.3, St3.3 and St3.2 His6‐tag‐containing proteins cloned in the pET32 vector). The co‐expressed proteins were purified by Ni2+ chelating chromatography using the same protocol [CITATION]. Active fractions were concentrated to > 1 mg·mL−1, desalted and immediately used to determine the enzymatic activity. The presence of the different recombinant proteins was monitored in chromatographic fractions by measuring the SS activity, SDS‐PAGE and immunoblotting.  Pull‐down assays were carried out as follows: purified His6‐tagged SBD proteins were bound to an Ni2+ ‐Sepharose high‐performance resin (GE Healthcare Bio‐Sciences) previously equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2‐mercaptoethanol and 20 mm imidazole), followed by incubation with 1 mg of cell extract from E. coli BL21‐(DE3)‐RIL transformed with pNAL1 plasmid and rotation for 1 h at 30 °C. After washing three times with binding buffer, the resin was centrifuged for 3 min at 500 g and the supernatant was discarded. The bound proteins were eluted from the resin by the addition of 300 mm imidazole, and subjected to SDS‐PAGE analysis and immunoblotting.  Far western blotting was performed as described previously [CITATION] with minor modifications. First, recombinant CDHis was separated by SDS‐PAGE and transferred onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. The membrane was then blocked in NaCl/Pi buffer containing 3% BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween‐20, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg·mL−1 of the bait proteins. After this, the membrane was washed three times for 10 min with NaCl/Pi buffer containing 0.1% Tween‐20. SBD proteins bound to CDHis were detected by incubation with antibodies raised against recombinant D123 protein (anti‐D123). Controls were incubated with anti‐GS serum. The antigen–antibody complex was visualized with alkaline phosphatase‐conjugated a‐mouse IgG or a‐rabbit IgG, followed by staining with 5‐bromo‐4‐chloroindol‐2‐yl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium [CITATION].  Binding assays were performed by the adsorption of different SBD recombinant proteins to raw starch, and the adsorption constant (Kad, in milliliters per gram of starch) was determined from the slope, as reported previously. All the determinations were performed at least in triplicate and the average values ± SD are reported [CITATION, CITATION]. SS activity was determined using a radiochemical method [CITATION]. All kinetic parameters are the means of at least three determinations and are reproducible within ± 10%. SDS‐PAGE was performed using 12% gels as described by Laemmli [CITATION]. Gels were developed by Coomassie blue staining or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) or poly(vinylidene difluoride) (GE Healthcare Bio‐Sciences) membranes. Electroblotted membranes were incubated with penta‐His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) or polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant Agrobacterium tumefaciens glycogen synthase (anti‐GS) [CITATION] or anti‐D123. The antigen–antibody complex was visualized as described above [CITATION]. Total protein was determined as described by Bradford [CITATION].
