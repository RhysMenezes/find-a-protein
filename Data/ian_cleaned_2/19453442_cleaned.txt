!~ABS~! The cap-binding protein complex (CBC) binds to the caps of all RNA polymerase II transcripts, and plays an important role in RNA metabolism. We characterized interactions, localization and nuclear–cytoplasmic transport of two subunits of the Arabidopsis thaliana cap-binding protein complex (AtCBC): AtCBP20 and AtCBP80. Using CFP/YFP-tagged proteins, we show that transport of AtCBC from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the plant cell is different from that described in other eukaryotic cells. We show that the smaller subunit of the complex, AtCBP20, plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of AtCBC. The C-terminal part of AtCBP20 contains two functionally independent nuclear localization signals (NLSs). At least one of these two NLSs is required for the import of CBC into the plant nucleus. The interaction between the A. thaliana CBP20 and CBP80 was also analyzed in detail, using the yeast two-hybrid system and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. The N-terminal part of AtCBP20 is essential for interaction with AtCBP80. Furthermore, AtCBP80 is important for the protein stability of the smaller subunit of CBC. Based on these data, we propose a model for the nuclear–cytoplasmic trafficking of the CBC complex in plants.
!~RES~! In order to analyze the subcellular localization of CBPs, AtCBP20 was fused with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), and AtCBP80 was fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), at the N termini. These constructs (Figure 1) were transiently expressed in A. thaliana protoplasts. Initially, localization experiments were performed separately with the single ECFP-AtCBP20 or EYFP-AtCBP80 constructs. AtCBP20 localized in the nucleus, whereas AtCBP80 was present in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of transfected cells (Figure 2a,b). In the next step, protoplasts were co-transfected with fluorescently tagged AtCBP20 and AtCBP80. Both proteins were detected exclusively in the nucleus in the double-transfected cells (Figure 2c). Based on this observation, it was hypothesized that the interaction of AtCBP80 with AtCBP20 is important for the import of the whole plant CBC to the nucleus. In the next approach, protoplasts were co-transfected with fluorescently tagged AtCBP80 and one of the truncated variants of AtCBP20 lacking either the C-terminal part, containing two putative NLSs (AtCBP20Δ145–257), or the N-terminal part, containing the RNA-binding domain (AtCBP20Δ1–144). The co-expression of AtCBP20Δ145–257 with AtCBP80 resulted in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the proteins tested (Figure 2d). On the other hand, in protoplasts co-transfected with AtCBP20Δ1–144 and AtCBP80, mutated AtCBP20 was present exclusively in the nucleus, whereas AtCBP80 was detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figure 2e). Results of these analyses suggested that the N-terminal part of AtCBP20 was responsible for the interaction with AtCBP80, whereas the C-terminal part of AtCBP20 participated in the translocation of the AtCBC to the nucleus. To confirm that the two putative NLSs located in the C-terminal part of AtCBP20 are functional and responsible for the nuclear localization of the CBC, AtCBP20, containing mutated NLS1, NLS2 or both NLSs, was co-expressed with AtCBP80 in A. thaliana protoplasts. The co-transfection of AtCBP20ΔNLS1 with AtCBP80 and AtCBP20ΔNLS2 with AtCBP80 resulted in the nuclear localization of both proteins (Figure 2f,g). In contrast, the co-expression of AtCBP20ΔNLS1,2 with AtCBP80 produced the predominant cytoplasmic accumulation of both proteins (Figure 2h). These data indicate that a single one of two functional NLSs in AtCBP20 is necessary and sufficient for the import of the plant CBC to the nucleus. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate the interaction between A. thaliana nuclear CBPs in detail, and to define the region of AtCBP20 that is responsible for the interaction with AtCBP80. Firstly, full-length AtCBP20 was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD-AtCBP20), and full-length AtCBP80 was fused to the C terminus of the GAL4 activation domain (AD-AtCBP80) (Figure 1), and both constructs were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (strain Y190). As a marker for protein–protein interaction, we made use of the ability of Y190 cells to grow in the absence of histidine only when positive protein–protein interactions occur. In addition, we used the X-Gal test to confirm the interaction between the two expressed proteins. We found that histidine auxotrophy was restored in yeast cells co-transformed with BD-AtCBP20 and AD-AtCBP80 (Figure 3). The histidine auxotrophy was also restored in yeast cells transfected with construct pCL1 containing the complete GAL4 transcription factor (positive control; Figure 3). In contrast, the yeast cells that were co-transformed with BD-AtCBP20 and plasmid containing the free AD domain were unable to grow on plates without histidine (negative control; Figure 3). To more precisely define which part of AtCBP20 is responsible for the interaction with AtCBP80, the GAL4 DNA binding domain was fused to AtCBP20 variants lacking parts of the protein, resulting in the following constructs: BD-AtCBP20Δ227–257, BD-AtCBP20Δ145–257, BD-AtCBP20Δ70–257 and BD-AtCBP20Δ1–144 (Figure 1). The growth of yeast on selection plates was observed only for cells co-transformed with BD-AtCBP20Δ227–257 and AD-AtCBP80, or BD-AtCBP20Δ145–257 and AD-AtCBP80 (Figure 3). In sharp contrast, histidine auxotrophy was not restored in yeast cells co-transformed with BD-AtCBP20Δ70–257 and AD-AtCBP80, or with BD-AtCBP20Δ1–144 and AD-AtCBP80 (Figure 3). These results indicate that only the first N-terminal 144 aa of AtCBP20 are required for the AtCBP20–AtCBP80 interaction. Taken together, our results suggest that AtCBP20 is able to form a complex with AtCBP80, and that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal (144-aa long) domain of AtCBP20. The plant-specific C-terminal tail of the A. thaliana CBP20 is not necessary for the interaction between both subunits of AtCBC. [[FIGURE]] Because the yeast two-hybrid system often gives false-negative and false-positive results (CITATION), it is necessary to confirm the results obtained using other techniques. To directly study the physical interaction between AtCBP20 variants and AtCBP80 in living plant cells, the ECFP and EYFP fusion proteins (Figure 1) were used as a donor–acceptor pair in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. FRET occurs between a donor fluorescent molecule and an acceptor fluorescent molecule when they are in close proximity (1–10 nm) of each other (CITATION). The FRET efficiency was evaluated by the method based on an increase in donor fluorescence after photobleaching of the acceptor (FRET APB). A. thaliana protoplasts express AtCBP20 variants as N-terminal fusions with ECFP, and express AtCBP80 as an N-terminal fusion with EYFP. FRET APB was calculated after acceptor bleaching of the whole cell area. Mean FRET APB efficiencies of 15.1 ± 4.2% were obtained from energy transfer between ECFP-AtCBP20 and EYFP-AtCBP80 (Figure 4). Comparable FRET efficiencies were observed for ECFP-AtCBP20Δ227–257–EYFP-AtCBP80 (15.8 ± 4.9%) and ECFP-AtCBP20Δ145–257–EYFP-AtCBP80 (16.5 ± 4.1%) pairs (Figure 4). The FRET efficiency was significantly lower (7.1 ± 2.3%) for the ECFP-AtCBP20Δ70–257–EYFP-AtCBP80 pair (Figure 4). A low level of FRET efficiency was recorded for ECFP-AtCBP20Δ1–144–EYFP-AtCBP80 (1.2 ± 1.7%), and in negative control experiments with ECFP-AtCBP20–free YFP (1.1 ± 1.9%), free CFP–free YFP (0.5 ± 2.4%) and free CFP alone (−0.4 ± 0.9%) (Figure 4). Taking into account that typical FRET APB efficiencies for protein interaction pairs range from 10 to 30% (CITATION), clear protein–protein interactions were detected for AtCBP20–AtCBP80, AtCBP20Δ227–257–AtCBP80 and AtCBP20Δ145–257–AtCBP80. The interaction between AtCBP20Δ70–257 and AtCBP80 showed a FRET efficiency that was significantly different from the control experiments, but this value was much weaker than that observed for the other pairs tested. Thus, the results of the FRET analysis confirmed the observations from the yeast two-hybrid analysis that the first 144 aa of AtCBP20 is responsible for the interaction with AtCBP80. [[FIGURE]] Finally, we investigated the expression of the CBC in wild-type plants and cbp20 or abh1(cbp80) mutants of A. thaliana. Both cbp mutants are T-DNA insertion mutants (CITATION; CITATION). The RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of transcripts of both genes in wild-type plants (Figure 5a). According to our expectations, only the AtCBP80 transcript is present in the cbp20 mutant, whereas in abh1(cbp80) only the AtCBP20 transcript is detected (Figure 5a). In order to check the expression of both CBC subunits at the protein level, a Western blot analysis was performed. As expected, both proteins were detected in the protein extract from wild-type plants (Figure 5b). In the cbp20 mutant, the AtCBP20 protein was absent, and in the abh1(cbp80) mutant AtCBP80 was not detectable (Figure 5b). Surprisingly, in the protein extract obtained from the abh1(cbp80) mutant we could not detect AtCBP20, although the RNA transcript of this gene was present in the mutant (Figure 5a,b). This observation suggests that the smaller subunit of AtCBC is only stable in a complex with AtCBP80. The level of AtCBP80 in the cbp20 mutant was only slightly reduced compared with the wild type (Figure 5b). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia and T-DNA insertion mutants cbp20 (CITATION) and abh1(cbp80) (CITATION) were grown in a growth chamber with 16 h of illumination (100 μmol m−2 sec−1) at 22°C, with 60% relative humidity. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia suspension-cultured T87 cells were grown in a growth chamber with continuous illumination (100 μmol m−2 sec−1) at 22°C with rotary shaking at 120 r.p.m. in mJPL3 medium (CITATION). The cultures were renewed weekly, 5 days after passage cells were used for protoplast preparation. Full-length AtCBP80 and full-length or fragments of AtCBP20 were amplified with gene-specific primers (Table 1) containing SalI and BamHI restriction sites, and were then cloned into pSAT6-ECFP-C1 and pSAT4-EYFP-C1, respectively (CITATION), resulting in ECFP-AtCBP20, ECFP-AtCBP20Δ227–257, ECFP-AtCBP20Δ145–257, ECFP-AtCBP20Δ70–257, ECFP-AtCBP20Δ1–144 and EYFP-AtCBP80 constructs (Figure 1). For control experiments, the empty vectors pSAT6-ECFP-C1 and pSAT4-EYFP-C1 were used. The ECFP-AtCBP20ΔNLS1, ECFP-AtCBP20ΔNLS2 and ECFP-AtCBP20ΔNLS1,2 plasmids, with mutations in nuclear localization signals (NLS1, HRKRQR → HAAAQR; NLS2, RKRR → AAAA; Figure 1) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on ECFP-AtCBP20 with the primers listed in Table 1, following the Stratagene Quick-Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit manual (http://www.stratagene.com). A sequence determination was performed for each construct. All restriction sites used in vector construction are underlined. Bold underlined nucleotides indicate where the sequence was changed to introduce a point mutation. The fusion constructs used for protein visualization were introduced into A. thaliana protoplasts prepared from cell-suspension culture (T87) or from leaves (CITATION). Briefly, cells were incubated with a protoplasting enzyme solution (1.2% cellulase R-10 and 0.8% macerozyme; Serva, http://www.serva.de) in darkness at 24°C for 4 h (with gentle shaking for the last 30 min; 20 r.p.m.). Next, the protoplasts were purified by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient (10 min, 200 g). For transfection, a polyethylene glycol-mediated procedure was used (CITATION). Protoplasts were analyzed for fluorescence 20–35 h after transfection using a confocal laser scanning microscope or an epifluorescence microscope AxioObserver Z1 (Zeiss, http://www.zeiss.com). Plasmids pACT2 and pAS2-1, encoding the GAL4 activating domain (AD) and the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD), respectively, were used for in vivo protein–protein interaction studies using the yeast two-hybrid system (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System; Clontech, http://www.clontech.com). All constructs were generated using the specific primers listed in Table 1. cDNAs were amplified with appropriate primers, PCR products (AtCBP20, AtCBP20Δ127–257, AtCBP20Δ145–257, AtCBP20Δ70–257, AtCBP20Δ1–144 and AtCBP80) were then digested with BamHI and PstI, and ligated in frame into pAS2-1, resulting in BD-AtCBP20, BD-AtCBP20Δ227–257, BD-AtCBP20Δ145–257, BD-AtCBP20Δ70–257 and BD-AtCBP20Δ1–144, or into pACT2, resulting in AD-AtCBP80 (Figure 1). As a positive control, the plasmid pCL1 encoding the complete transcription factor GAL4 was used, and for a negative control the empty plasmid pACT2 together with BD-AtCBP20 has been used. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 cells were co-transformed with the resulting plasmids, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). After 3 days of incubation at 30°C, between two and five colonies were inoculated in synthetic dropout (SD) media lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD/–LT), and grown at 30°C in a shaking incubator. After 2 days, 100 μl of the yeast cell suspension was spotted onto SD/–LT plates, or plates lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine (SD/–LTH), to monitor HIS3 reporter expression by yeast cells growth. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 days, and then images were acquired. The interactions were confirmed using the β-galactosidase test performed on colonies growing on SD/–LTH medium, following the kit manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). Subcellular localizations of fusion proteins were checked with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 inverse microscope; Zeiss) using a 63× oil objective lens. Excitation was achieved with an Argon laser at 458 nm (ECFP) and 514 nm (EYFP), and with a diode laser at 405 nm (Hoechst 33342; Hoechst, now part of Sanofi-Aventis, http://www.sanofi-aventis.de). Fluorescence was observed using the emission filter set to 470–500 nm (ECFP), 530–600 nm (EYFP) and 420–480 nm (Hoechst 33342). To visualize the nucleus, protoplasts were stained with Hoechst 33342 (final concentration, 20 μg ml−1) 10 min before observation. At least 100 transfected protoplasts were analyzed in a single localization experiment. Images shown in the paper represent the typical subcellular localization of fluorescently labelled proteins. The FRET APB assays between ECFP as a donor and EYFP as an acceptor were performed using an epifluorescence microscope (AxioObserver Z1; Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (AxioCam MRm; ZEISS) using a 63× air objective lens, and specific filters for ECFP (excitation 436/20 nm, emission 480/40 nm) and EYFP (excitation 500/20 nm, emission 535/30 nm). For the acceptor photobleaching experiment, EYFP was bleached using bleach set 01 (excitation 510–560 nm) by continuous illumination at maximal strength for 2 min. For selected cells with the similar level of ECFP and EYFP expression, acquisition times were in the range of 50–600 ms. The calculation of the FRET efficiency on selected cells (at least 35 for each experiment) was carried out applying the Siegel method (CITATION), using axiovision fret software (Zeiss). Images were arranged using adobe photoshop (Adobe Systems, http://www.adobe.com), and colour encoding was performed using matlab 6.5 (The Mathworks, http://www.mathworks.com). Gene expression analysis was performed on the total RNA extracted from leaves of 4-week-old wild-type plants (Col-0) and T-DNA insertion mutants cbp20 and abh1(cbp80) using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com). For the RT-PCR analysis, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 6 μg of total RNA using MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (H–) (Promega, http://www.promega.com). A 1-μl portion of reaction mixture was used as a template in the PCR amplification with the primers listed in Table 1. For western blot analysis, fresh leaves (1 g) from 4-week-old wild-type plants, and cbp20 and abh1 (cbp80) mutants, were homogenized in a buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 292 mm sucrose; 5 mm EDTA; 5 mm EGTA) with Complete Mini EDTA-free (Roche, http://www.roche.com). Following centrifugation at 20 000 g for 20 min, total soluble proteins (10 μg per lane) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, http://www.millipore.com) and immunobloted using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal part of AtCBP20 (CITATION), against full-length AtCBP80 (Kmieciak, unpublished) or against eIF4E (CITATION). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibodies raised against rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) were used as the secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled proteins were visualized with AuroraTM Western Blotting Kit (MP Biomedicals, http://www.mpbio.com) following the supplier’s manual.
