!~ABS~! The purpose of this study was to characterize covalent multimers with molecular mass of >90 kDa in the water-insoluble (WI) proteins of aging human lenses. The experimental approach was to first separate the multimers (molecular mass >90 kDa) as individual spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and next analyze compositions of each multimers by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric (ES-MS/MS) methods. The WI proteins from lenses of 25- and 41-year-old subjects showed distinct 5- and 16-multimer spots on two-dimensional gels, respectively, but the spots from 52- and 72-year-old lenses were non-descript and diffused. ES-MS/MS analyses showed two types of covalent multimers in 25- and 41-year-old lenses, i.e. the first type composed of fragments of eight different crystallins (i.e. αA, αB, βA3, βA4, βB1, βB2, γS, and γD), and the second type of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins (possibly fragments) and two beaded filament proteins (phakinin and filensin). The most commonly identified species in the complexes of 41-year-old lenses were: αA-fragment (C-terminally truncated, residues 1–157), αB-fragment (residues 83–90), βB1-crystallin (residues 60–71), βA3 (residues 33–44), βA4 (residues 106–117), filensin (residues 78–90), and phakinin (residues 77–89). Three post-translational modifications (i.e. oxidation of Met and Trp, conversion of Ser to dehydroalanine, and formylation of His) were observed in αA-crystallin fragment, and the first two modifications could cross-link proteins. Together, the results suggested that covalent multimers appeared early in life (i.e. 25 years of age) and increased in number with aging, and the two beaded filament proteins form covalent complexes with crystallin fragments in vivo. 
!~RES~! Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoretic Analyses of WI Protein Fractions from Lenses of Different Ages—The two-dimensional gel profiles of WI protein fractions from lenses of 25-, 41-, 52-, and 72-year-old donors are shown in Fig. 1. The α-, β-, and γ-crystallins (molecular mass between 20–35 kDa) and their fragments (molecular mass < 20 kDa) were predominately present in the two-dimensional gel profiles of these lenses. Several minor spots with molecular mass >35 kDa were also seen in these lenses, which became increasingly more complex and non-descript with aging. However, although some of these were separated as single spots in the WI protein fractions of 25- and 41-year-old lenses (shown with arrows in Fig. 1, A and B), they remained diffused and non-descript in the lenses from 52- and 70-year-old donors (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the focus of this investigation was to characterize individual covalent multimers, the single spots with molecular mass >90 kDa from lenses of only 25- and 41-year-old donors were chosen for their compositional analysis by MALDI-TOF and ES-MS/MS methods.  [[FIGURE]]  As shown in Fig. 2A, five major spots (numbered as 1 to 5) were identified in the WI protein fraction of lenses from 25-year-old donors, whereas 16 spots were present in the 41-year-old lenses. The central region of each spot was excised and digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Next, the tryptic fragments were analyzed by the MALDI-TOF method followed by their amino acid sequence analysis by ES-MS/MS method using Micromass-QTOF2. The amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments from lenses of a 25-year-old donor revealed that the single multimer spots were either made of several crystallin fragments or α-, β-, and γ-crystallins and filensin and/or phakinin (the two beaded filament proteins) (Table I). Among the five major spots (molecular mass >90 kDa) in the WI protein fraction of 25-year-old lenses, spot 1 was of filensin, spot 2 was a mixture of fragments of αA and filensin, spot 3 was a mixture of fragments of eight different crystallins (αA-, αB-, βA3-, βA4-, βB1-, βB2-, γS-, and γD-crystallins), and spot 4 was a complex of αA-crystallin and filensin. As stated above, these identifications were based on the amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments of individual spots by the ES-MS/MS analysis (see below). Among the 16 spots observed in the WI protein fraction of lenses of 41-year-old donors, the amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments showed that these were multimeric complexes of intact or fragments of crystallins and filensin and phakinin. The details of the ES-MS/MS analyses of these spots are described below.  [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]]  ES-MS/MS Analysis of Components of Multimeric Complexes from Lenses of 25-Year-old Donors—The three tryptic peptide sequences of spot 1 on ES-MS/MS analysis showed amino acid sequences that matched with the sequence of filensin (Table II). The first peptide sequence of LNKEADEALLHNLR matched with the residues 144–157 of filensin, and the second and third peptides with sequences of SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR and LGELAGPEDALAR matched with residues 223–239 and 78–90 of filensin, respectively. Human lens filensin has 665 amino acids with Mr 74,496 (CITATION). The fact that residues 79–239 of filensin were seen as a complex with molecular mass >90 kDa, suggested that the protein was truncated.  [[TABLE]]  Spot 2 was a covalent complex of αA-crystallin and filensin, because ES-MS/MS analysis showed that it contained tryptic peptides with matching amino acid sequences of both proteins. The following tryptic peptide sequences of αA-crystallin were seen in spot 2: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (residues 1–11, oxidized Met, and Trp with none, one or two oxygen), DVTIQHPWFKR (residues 2–12), TLGPFYPSR9 (residues 13–22), TVLDSGISEVR (residues 55–65), SDRDKFVIFLDVK (residues 66–78), HFSPEDLTVK (residues 79–88), HFSPEDLTVKVQDDFVEIHGK (residues 79–99), VQDDFVEIHGK (residues 89–103), IQTGLDATHAER (residues 146–157), and TGLDATHAER (residues 148–157). Similarly, spot 2 contained two filensin tryptic peptides with sequences of LGELAGPEDALAR (residues 78–90) and SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR (#223–239). Together, the sequence data of the tryptic peptides suggested that the complex contained C-terminally truncated αA-crystallin (residues 1–157) and a filensin fragment (residues 79–239). Because the molecular mass of the complex was ∼90 kDa, the complex might be containing fragments instead of complete sequences of the two proteins.  Spot 3 was a multimer made of fragments of eight different crystallins (Table II), suggesting that crystallin fragments per se could cross-link to form a multimer complex. The ES-MS/MS analysis identified tryptic peptide sequences that overlapped with the sequences of αA-, αB-, βA3-, βA4-, βB1-, βB2-, γS-, and γD-crystallins. The complex showed the presence of two tryptic peptide sequences of αA-crystallin: TLGPFYPSR (residues 13–21) and HFSPEDLTVK (residues 79–88), and six tryptic peptides of αB-crystallin with sequences of: APSWFDTGLSEMR (oxidized Met residues 57–69), APSWFDTGLSEMRLEK (residue 57–72), HFSPEELK (residues 83–90), DRFSVNLDVK (residues 73–82), QDEHGFISR (residues 108–116), and IPADVDPLTITSSLSSDGVLTVNGPR (residues 124–149). This spot also contained three βA3-crystallin tryptic peptides with the sequences of ITIYDQENFQGKR (residues 33–45), WDAWSGSNAYHIER (residues 96–109), and MTIFEKENFIGR (CITATION–CITATION), two βA4-crystallin tryptic peptides with the sequences of MVVWDEDGFQGR (oxidized Met, residues 13–24) and LTIFEQENFLGK (residues 107–118), and four βB1 tryptic peptides with the sequence of LVVFELENFQGR (residues 60–71), VSSGTWVGYQYPGYR (residues 187–201), ISLFEGANFK (residues 151–160), and GYQYLLEPGDFR (residues 202–213). Additional peptides in the complex were one βB2 tryptic peptide with the sequence of VQSGTWVGYQYPGYR (residues 145–159), four γS tryptic fragments with the sequence of ITFYEDKNFQGR (residues 7–18), AVHLPSGGQYK (residues 84–94), QYLLDKK (residues 148–154), and KPIDWGAASPAVQSFR (residues 158–173), and one tryptic peptide of γD-crystallin with the sequence of QYLLMPGDYR (with oxidized Met, residues 143–152). Spot 4 was found to be a multimer of filensin and αA-crystallin. The spot showed the presence of a filensin tryptic peptide with the sequence of LGELAGPEDALAR (residues 78–90) and the tryptic peptides of αA with the sequence of TLGPFYPSR (residues 13–21) and TVLDSGISEVR (residues 55–65). Together, the above results suggested that covalent multimers existed in the WI protein fraction of young human lenses of 25 years of age, and these complexes were formed following cross-linking between truncated αA-crystallin and filensin, or among fragments of eight different crystallins.  Identification of Components of Multimer Spots in WI Proteins of Lenses from 41-Year-old Donors—Upon two dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis, the WI protein fraction from lenses of 41-year-old donor showed more than 16 individual spots with molecular mass >90 kDa (Fig. 2B). The increased number of spots represented additional age-related cross-linked species that became water-insoluble. The ES-MS/MS analysis-deduced amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides from spots 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are listed in Table III, which show that a variety of fragments of α-, β-, and γ-crystal-lins and that of filensin and phakinin were present in the multimers. The components of the remaining spots could not be fully identified and, therefore, are not reported.  [[TABLE]]  Spots 3 and 5 showed tryptic fragments with identical amino acid sequences suggesting their identical compositions except spot 5 lacked phakinin (Table III). Both spots were a covalent complex of αA-, βB1-, βA4-crystallins, phakinin, and filensin. In both spots, αA-crystallin was apparently C-terminally truncated, and both Met and Trp residues at positions 1 and 9, respectively, were oxidized along with oxidized Met-113 residue in βB1-crystallin. The tryptic peptides present in the two multimers were as follows. αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1–11, oxidized Met and Trp), TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65), LDSGISEVR (#57–65), HFSPEDLTVK (#79–88) and VQDDFVEIHGK (#89–99); βB1: LVVFELENFQGR (#60–71), GEMFILEK (#110–117, oxidized Met), GYQYLLEPGDFR (#202–214); βA4: LTIFEQENFLGK (#107–118); filensin: LGELAGPEDALAR (#78–90), SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR (#223–239), EVLSHLQAQR (#230–239), QLAVAQQTLK (#294–303); and phakinin: ALGISSVFLQGLR (#77–89), LMLQTETIQAGADDFKER (#174–191), and YENEQPFR (#192–199).  Spot 6 multimer was a complex of αA-, αB-, βA3-crystallins, filensin, and phakinin. The tryptic peptide sequences observed in spot 6 were as follows. αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1–11, oxidized Met and Trp), TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65), LDSGISEVR (#57–65), VQDDFVEIHGK (#89–99), QDDHGYISR (#104–112), IQTGLDATHAER (#146–157); αB: APSWFDTGLSEMR (#57–69), HFSPEELK (#83–90); βA3: ITIYDQENFQGK (#33–44); filensin: LGELAGPEDALAR (#78–90), QLAVAQQTLK (#294–303); and phakinin: ALGISSVFLQGLR (#77–89). Spot 7 was a complex of αA-, αB-, βB1-, and γS-crystallins and phakinin. The tryptic fragments from this complex showed the following amino acid sequences: αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1–11, oxidized Met and Trp), TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), GPFYPSR (#15–21), PFYPSR (#16–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65, Ser-59 to dehydroalanine), LDSGISEVR (#57–65), HFSPEDLTVK (#79–88), VQDDFVEIHGK (89–99), DDFVEIHGK (#91–99); αB: APSWFDTGLSEMR (#57–69), HFSPEELK (#83–90); βB1: LVVFELENFQGR (#60–71), GYQYLLEPGDFR (#202–213); γS: ITFYEDKNFQGR (#7–18); and phakinin: ALGISSVFLQGLR (#77–89). Spot 8 multimer was a complex of αA, βA3, βA4, phakinin, and filensin. This spot contained tryptic peptides with the following sequences: αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1–11, oxidized Met and Trp), TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65), VQDDFVEIHGK (89–99), IQTGLDATHAER (#146–157); αB: HFSPEELK (#83–90); βA3: ITIYDQENFQGK (#33–44); βA4: LTIFEQENFLGK (#106–117); phakinin: ALGISSVFLQGLR (#77–89); and filensin: LGELAGPEDALAR (#78–90) and VRDLEAER (#99–106).  Spots 9 and 13 were identical in composition to spot 8, except spot 9 contained an additional αB-crystallin peptide (APSWFDTGLSEMR, residues 57–69), and spot 13 lacked a βA3-crystallin peptide (ITIYDQENFQGK, residues 33–44). Spots 14–16 were unique, and each showed compositions that were different from other complexes as described above, i.e. spot 14 multimer showed fragments of αA-, αB-, βB1-, βB2-, βA3-, βA4-crystallins and filensin, spot 15 contained αA-, βA4-crystallins, filensin, and phakinin, whereas spot 16 contained αA-crystallin and filensin. Spot 14 showed tryptic fragment with the following sequences. αA: TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65), LDSGISEVR (#57–65); αB: HFSPEELK (#83–90); βB1: LVVFELENFQGR (#60–71); βB2: IILYENPNFTGK (108–119); βA3: ITIYDQENFQGK (#33–44); βA4: LTIFEQENFLGK (#106–117); and filensin: LGELAGPEDALAR (#78–90). Spot 15 contained tryptic peptides with the following sequences. αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1–11, oxidized Met and Trp), TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65), LSGISEVR (#57–65); βA4: LTIFEQENFLGK (#106–117); filensin: LGELAGPEDALAR (#78–90), LQLEAQFLQDDISAAK (#158–173), ELQAQTTTLEQAIK (#240–254); and phakinin: ALGISSVFLQGLR (#77–89): LMLQTETIQAGADDFKER (#174–191). Spot 16 was a complex between αA-crystallin and filensin, with tryptic peptides with the following sequences. αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1–11, oxidized Met and Trp), TLGPFYPSR (#13–21), TVLDSGISEVR (#55–65); and filensin ELQAQTTTLEQAIK (#240–254).  It was also determined which fragments of crystallins, filensin, and phakinin were commonly present in the multimeric complexes (Table IV). The analysis showed that the αA-crystallin fragments with residues 1–11, 13–21, 55–65, and 79–88 occurred frequently with the multimers. Additional most commonly occurring fragments were from αB-crystallin (residues 83–90), βB1-crystallin (residues 60–71), βA3 (residues 33–44), βA4 (residues 106–117), filensin (residues 78–90), and phakinin (residues 77–89). The results suggested that the above regions of the crystallins and beaded filament proteins might be specifically involved in the covalent cross-linking during the multimer formation.  [[TABLE]]  Identification of Post-translational Modifications Present in Components Forming the WI Multimers—As stated in the introduction, the formation of the cross-linked crystallin species during aging and cataractogenesis is believed to be primarily due to post-translational modifications in crystallins. The ES-MS/MS analyses of the complexes identified three major post-translational modifications in the αA-crystallin fragments. The three modifications were oxidation of Met-1 and Trp-9, conversion of Ser-59 to dehydroalanine and formylation of His-79. The oxidative modifications are listed in Tables II and III, and an example during ES-MS/MS analysis is shown in Fig. 3. Similarly, the conversion of Ser-59 to dehydroalanine in the αA-crystallin is shown in Fig. 4, and the formylation of His-79 in αA-crystallin is shown in Fig. 5. The significance of these modifications in the covalent complex formation is discussed below.  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! Materials—Normal human lenses with no apparent opacity were obtained from Dr. Robert Church of the Emory University or from the Shared Ocular Tissue Module at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The lenses were retrieved within 48–72 h post-mortem, and stored in medium-199 without phenol red at –20 °C until used. The prestained and unstained molecular weight protein markers were from Invitrogen and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. The chemicals for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were from either Amersham Biosciences or Bio-Rad. Unless indicated otherwise, all other chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Fisher (Atlanta, GA) companies.  Isolation of WS and WI Protein Fractions from Normal Human Lenses and Their Analysis by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis— Normal human lenses without any opacity from donors of 25, 41, 52, and 72 years of age were used to isolate WS and WI protein fractions by a procedure as previously described (CITATION, CITATION). Lenses were thawed on ice, decapsulated, suspended (2 ml/lens) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm iodoacetamide (a cysteine proteinase inhibitor), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a serine proteinase inhibitor)), and homogenized using a tissue grinder. Following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min of the lens homogenate, the supernatant was recovered, the pellet was homogenized and centrifuged as above, and the process was repeated twice. The three supernatants after each centrifugation were pooled and designated as water-soluble (WS) protein fraction, and the pellet was designated as the water-insoluble (WI) protein fraction. The WI proteins from lenses of individual ages were dissolved in the resolubilization buffer (CITATION) (5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% caprylyl sulfobetaine, 2 mm tributylphosphine, 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Each preparation was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (IEF in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension). The IEF separation was carried out using Immoboline Dry Strips (pH range of 3–10) and by following the manufacturer's suggested method (Amersham Biosciences). The second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed by using the Laemmli (CITATION) method. Prior to the first IEF analysis, the desired WI protein fraction was incubated overnight with dry strips at room temperature. Following the IEF separation, the strips were consecutively treated for 15 min each, first with 100 mm dithiothreitol (in equilibration buffer: 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, containing 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, and 1% SDS) and next with 300 mm iodoacetamide (also dissolved in equilibration buffer). During SDS-PAGE, a 15% polyacrylamide gel of 16 × 14 cm (width × height) was used. The protein spots on a gel were stained with Coomassie Blue.  Analysis of Multimers by Mass Spectrometric Methods—For mass spectrometric analyses, the protein spots were individually excised from a polyacrylamide gel using pipette microtips. The polyacrylamide pieces containing a spot was washed with doubly distilled water and destained after treating with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. Trypsin solution (12 ng/μl) was added, and the preparation was resuspended in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. The samples were digested by trypsin (sequencing grade from Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C overnight, and the next day they were analyzed by using the MALDI-TOF method (Perspective Biosciences, Model Voyager-DE2 PRO). The MALDI analysis and ES-MS/MS sequencing (Micromass QTOF-2) were performed at the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mass Spectrometric Shared Facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identity of proteins was established by using the NCBInr data base of Matrix Science. During the ES-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic fragments, the data base of the Proteinlynx Global Server was used along with manual interpretations as needed in certain cases. Protein concentration was determined by a modified method of Lowry using the Pierce protein determination kit.
