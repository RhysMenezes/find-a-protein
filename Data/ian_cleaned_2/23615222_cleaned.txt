!~ABS~! Thioredoxin (Trx) is a key player in redox homeostasis in various cells, modulating the functions of target proteins by catalyzing a thiol–disulfide exchange reaction. Target proteins of cytosolic Trx‐h of higher plants were studied, particularly in the plasma membrane, because plant plasma membranes include various functionally important protein molecules such as transporters and signal receptors. Plasma membrane proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures were screened using a resin Trx‐h1 mutant‐immobilized, and a total of 48 candidate proteins obtained. These included two calcium‐sensing proteins: a phosphoinositide‐specific phospholipase 2 (AtPLC2) and a calcium‐dependent protein kinase 21 (AtCPK21). A redox‐dependent change in AtCPK21 kinase activity was demonstrated in vitro. Oxidation of AtCPK21 resulted in a decrease in kinase activity to 19% of that of untreated AtCPK21, but Trx‐h1 effectively restored the activity to 90%. An intramolecular disulfide bond (Cys97–Cys108) that is responsible for this redox modulation was then identified. In addition, endogenous AtCPK21 was shown to be oxidized in vivo when the culture cells were treated with H2O2. These results suggest that redox regulation of AtCPK21 by Trx‐h in response to external stimuli is important for appropriate cellular responses. The relationship between the redox regulation system and Ca2+ signaling pathways is discussed.   
!~RES~! To identify potential target proteins of Trx‐h1, plasma membrane proteins of A. thaliana were screened using an immobilized Trx‐h1C43S mutant whose active site Cys43 was substituted with Ser CITATION. Proteins in the plasma membranes were then solubilized using the detergent n‐dodecyl‐β‐d‐maltoside, and incubated with Trx‐h1C43S immobilized on Sepharose beads. After thorough washing of the gel, the proteins bound to the Trx‐h1C43S mutant via intermolecular disulfide bonds were eluted from the gel by reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT). The proteins included in the eluate showed very different band patterns on SDS/PAGE from those in the solubilized and flow‐through fractions, suggesting specific acquisition of particular proteins from the solubilized fraction by this method (Fig. 1). The protein bands separated by SDS/PAGE were analyzed by MALDI‐TOF/TOF MS. In total, 48 proteins were identified as candidates (Table S1). Within these identified proteins, we focused on AtCPK21, which is known to be a calcium‐sensing protein (Fig. 1 and Table 1).  [[FIGURE]] AtCPK21 contains four conserved cysteine residues, and has been reported to be anchored to the plasma membrane by an N‐terminal lipid modification CITATION, CITATION. Here we examined modulation of AtCPK21 by Trx‐h1 in vitro because CDPKs were implicated in oxidative signal transduction in plants CITATION, CITATION.  To assess interaction between Trx‐h1 and AtCPK21, a yeast two‐hybrid system for membrane‐associated proteins was used (Fig. 2). As this split‐ubiquitin system functions without transportation of the protein of interest to the nucleus, interaction of proteins of interest should be detected at cellular membranes. The yeast co‐expressing AtCPK21 and Trx‐h1 grew on selective plates (SC–His) but not on severely selective plates (SC–Ade) (Fig. 2). Co‐expression of AtCPK21 with Trx‐h1C43S resulted in better growth on selective SC–His plates than with the wild‐type, suggesting that Trx‐h1C43S interacts more stably with AtCPK21 than the wild‐type does. This result confirms the interaction of AtCPK21 with AtTrx‐h1.  [[FIGURE]] The effect of oxidation and reduction on AtCPK21 activity was examined. A calcium‐dependent protein phosphorylation activity assay was performed using calf histone III‐S as an artificial substrate. The initial specific activity of the reduced form (0.22 μmol/min/mg) was comparable to those of other CDPKs CITATION, CITATION. The activity in the presence of EGTA was negligibly low under all conditions (< 0.002 μmol/min/mg). Oxidation by 5 μm CuCl2 decreased the kinase activity to 19% of that of the reduced form, and reduction of the oxidized form using 10 mm DTT restored the activity to 90% (Fig. 3A). These results clearly indicate that oxidation suppresses the enzyme activity, and this suppression is reversibly recovered by reduction. The ability of Trx‐h1 to assist reactivation of the oxidized enzyme by reduction of intramolecular disulfide bonds was then examined. Although the activity of the oxidized form gradually recovered with increasing concentrations of DTT, addition of 6 μm Trx‐h1 greatly enhanced recovery of the activity (Fig. 3B). For example, the activity recovered by addition of both Trx‐h1 and 50 μm DTT reached 90%, but was only 42% when Trx‐h1 was omitted. The concentration of Trx‐h1 required for 50% recovery was < 1 μm in the presence of 10 μm DTT, suggesting high affinity of Trx‐h1 for the AtCPK21 protein (Fig. 3C).  [[FIGURE]] AtCPK21 contains six cysteine residues in total, allowing formation of multiple inter‐ or intramolecular disulfide bonds under oxidizing conditions. Peptide mapping analysis was performed in order to specify which cysteine residues form disulfide bonds relevant to redox regulation of AtCPK21. Tryptic peptides obtained from oxidized AtCPK21 were separated by reversed‐phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI‐TOF/TOF MS. A single redox‐sensitive fragment with a molecular mass of 2301.07 m/z [Mr+H]+ was identified (Fig. 4A), which was specifically found in the oxidized form sample but not in the reduced form. When tryptic peptides containing this 2301.07 Da fragment were reduced using the reducing reagent Tris‐(2‐carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, the signal intensity of this fragment was attenuated by less than one‐tenth of the initial intensity. In contrast, the signal intensity of fragments with molecular masses of 1147.58 and 1156.59 m/z [Mr+H]+ increased (Fig. 4B). The two fragments (1147.58 and 1156.59 m/z) were therefore analyzed using MS/MS spectrometry, and the internal sequences of these polypeptides were determined to be GQFGITYMCK(89–98) (molecular mass 1146.52 Da) and EIGTGNTYACK(99–109) (molecular mass 1155.52 Da), respectively (Fig. 4C,D), indicating the Cys97–Cys108 disulfide bond (Fig. 4D). This combination is quite feasible as these two cysteine residues are located in the catalytic domain. The predicted 3D structure model of the catalytic domain (Tyr80–Ile398) calculated using swiss‐model software CITATION on the basis of the crystal structure of Toxoplasma gondii calmodulin‐domain protein kinase 1 (Fig. S1) clearly indicates location of these cysteines at the ATP‐binding site. The distance between the sulfur atoms of the two cysteine residues in the predicted structure was calculated to be 3.89 Å using molmol software CITATION, i.e. they are close enough to each other to form a disulfide bond.  [[FIGURE]] Finally, the ability of an endogenous AtCPK21 to be oxidized or reduced in vivo in response to external stimuli was examined. A. thaliana cell cultures were incubated with 10 mm H2O2 for 4 h in the dark, and proteins were directly extracted using trichloroacetic acid to avoid artificial oxidation of free thiol groups in the proteins during extraction CITATION. The extracted proteins were labeled by PEG‐maleimide (poly(ethylene glycol)‐ maleimide) to monitor in vivo redox states. In order to visualize the redox response of the endogenous AtCPK21, an IgG against AtCPK21 was prepared using the whole recombinant protein and affinity‐purified as described in 4. The endogenous AtCPK21 was detected as a double band with apparent molecular mass of 61 kDa in the cell extracts by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). An IgG against the N‐terminal variable region of NtCDPK1 that recognized an ortholog of AtCPK21 in tobacco Nicotiana tabacum CITATION also detected a doublet band in the cell extract in the same way (data not shown). The recombinant AtCPK21 was detected as a double band on SDS/PAGE and migrated either by autophosphorylation or by dephosphorylation (Fig. S2), suggesting possible autophosphorylation and/or phosphorylation of the endogenous protein. These results confirm that the anti‐AtCPK21 IgG recognizes the endogenous AtCPK21. A redox response of endogenous AtCPK21 in A. thaliana cell cultures was detected. A band with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa was detected without H2O2 supplementation, representing addition of six molecules of PEG‐maleimide (2 kDa) to the fully reduced AtCPK21 (increase in apparent molecular mass of 12 kDa), suggesting that the endogenous AtCPK21 is usually present in the reduced form (Fig. 5A). By oxidation with H2O2, multiple bands emerged gradually below the position of the fully reduced form, which represented addition of one to six molecules of PEG‐maleimide per single protein, indicating that AtCPK21 was oxidized.  [[FIGURE]] The amount of the fully reduced form decreased by less than half after H2O2 treatment for 2 h (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the total amounts of endogenous AtCPK21 did not alter during H2O2 treatment for 4 h (Fig. 5B), suggesting that H2O2 treatment did not cause degradation of the enzyme molecule. In contrast, we found only weak and transient oxidation of AtCPK21 proteins by H2O2 treatment in cells maintained under light conditions (Fig. S3). We did not detect the oxidized form when using < 10 mm H2O2.  To confirm the oxidation of AtCPK21 in vitro, the recombinant protein was labeled with PEG‐maleimide. Oxidation by 5 μm CuCl2 resulted in multiple bands below the position of fully reduced form on SDS/PAGE (Fig. S4). When the oxidized sample was reduced by Trx‐h1 in the presence or absence of 50 μm DTT, most of the multiple bands migrated close to the fully reduced form, although the recovery was not always complete. 
!~MM~! T87 cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia CITATION, were obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center (Yokohama, Japan), and maintained in suspension as described previously CITATION. The cells were grown in 100 mL JPL medium CITATION in a 300 mL flask at 22‐C under dark conditions, and aliquots of the cells were transferred to fresh medium every 2 weeks. To prepare plasma membranes, 100 mL of 2‐week‐old cells were added to 2 L of medium in a 3‐liter flask, and cultivated with stirring using a magnetic stirrer and aeration for 2 weeks. Approximately 150–200 g fresh weight cells were obtained from 2 L of culture.  Cell cultures were suspended into 0.25 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris‐acetate (pH 7.5), 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Basel, Switzerland), and disrupted using a BeadBeater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). After differential centrifugation, a post‐mitochondrial fraction was subjected to aqueous two‐phase partitioning CITATION in which the phase solution contained 10 mm NaCl. The resulting plasma membrane fraction was suspended in 0.15 m NaCO3 and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 30 min and the resulting precipitate was suspended in 0.25 m sorbitol and 20 mm Tris‐acetate (pH 7.5).  Trx‐h1 and the mutant Trx‐h1C43S were expressed in Escherichia coli using plasmids constructed for A. thaliana Trx‐h1 CITATION. The expressed proteins were purified as described previously CITATION.  The mutant Trx‐h1C43S was immobilized on CNBr‐activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma membranes (40 mg) were solubilized using 2% n‐dodecyl‐β‐d‐maltoside in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EGTA and protease inhibitor cocktail, and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was mixed with Trx‐h1C43S mutant‐immobilized resin and incubated for 1 h at 25‐C. The resin was washed in turn with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% n‐dodecyl‐β‐d‐maltoside, with buffer A plus 500 mm NaCl, and with buffer A plus 0.1% SDS. The resin was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min at 25 °C in all washes. The resin was finally suspended in buffer A including 0.1% SDS and 20 mm DTT, and incubated for 1 h. Trichloroacetic acid (5%) was added to the eluate, followed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4‐C. The precipitate was washed twice with ice‐cold acetone, air‐dried and solubilized in 5% SDS, 0.1 M NaOH, and SDS sample buffer composed of 2% SDS, 10 mm Tris‐HCl, pH 6.8, 6% glycerol, 10 mm DTT was added. No proteins were present in the eluate when using a resin without immobilized Trx‐h1 (data not shown). It was also demonstrated that a Trx mutant in which both Cys residues in the active site were substituted by Ser did not trap any proteins CITATION.  The acquired proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE (7.5–15%) and stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G‐250. The protein bands were excised from the gel, diced, de‐stained in 30% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and dried in 70% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, finally in 100% acetonitrile. The gel pieces were treated with 0.1% of an acid‐labile surfactant (Waters, Milford, MA) for 10 min at 60‐C as described previously CITATION, CITATION. The gel pieces were then dried and subjected to in‐gel digestion CITATION. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel, dried, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min to remove hydrolyzed surfactants. The supernatant was desalted using OMIX (R) pipette tips C18MB (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and eluted using 10 mg/mL α‐cyano 4‐hydroxy cinnamic acid (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI, USA) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 10 mm monobasic ammonium phosphate as described previously CITATION. The eluate was spotted on a sample plate, and analyzed by MALDI‐TOF/TOF MS using an ABI 4700 proteomics analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The data were analyzed using mascot software (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) and GPS Explorer 3.0 Workstation (Applied Biosystems).  An AtCPK21 cDNA encoding 531 amino acids (NM 116710, accession numbers in MEDLINE) was amplified from an A. thaliana cDNA library by PCR using the primers 5′‐GGCATATGGGTTGCTTCAGCAGTAAAC‐3′ (containing an NdeI site, underlined) and 5′‐CCGGATCCTCAATGGAATGGAAGCAGTTTC‐3′ (containing an XhoI site, underlined). The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing and sub‐cloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pCold I (Takara, Otsu, Japan), thereby adding a hexahistidine (6 × His) tag and a Factor Xa cleavage site to the N‐terminus of the AtCPK21. The 6xHis‐tagged AtCPK21 was induced in E. coli BL21 by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl‐β‐d‐thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h at 15‐C. The expressed protein was purified using Ni‐NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the 6 × His tag was removed by Factor Xa digestion (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). The digested proteins were separated by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Tris‐acetate (pH 7.5) and 0.2 m NaCl. Approximately 2 mg of purified protein preparation was obtained from 1 L of culture.  Interaction between AtCPK21 and AtTrx‐h1 was assessed using a yeast two‐hybrid membrane protein system 3 (Dualsystems Biotech, Schlieren, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To construct plasmids for the system, the AtCPK21 full‐length cDNA encoding 531 amino acids was amplified by PCR using primers 5′‐ATAACAAGGCCATTACGGCCAAAAATGGGTTGCTTCAGCAGTA‐3′ and 5′‐ AACTGATTGGCCGAGGCGGCCCCATGGAATGGAAGCAGTTTCC‐3′. Both AtTrx‐h1 wild‐type and the AtTrx‐h1C43S mutant were amplified using the primers 5′‐ATAACAAGGCCATTACGGCCAAAAATGGCTTCGGAAGAAGGAC‐3′ and 5′‐AACTGATTGGCCGAGGCGGCCCCAGCCAAGTGTTTGGCAATG‐3′. The SfiI restriction sites are underlined. The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. The AtCPK21 and AtTrx‐h1 cDNAs were sub‐cloned into the SfiI site of pBT3‐C and pPR3‐C, respectively. These vectors were included in the two‐hybrid membrane protein system. The resulting bait and prey plasmids were co‐transformed into a NMY51 yeast strain, which contains the HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes. Control experiments were performed in which plasmid pCCW‐Alg5 with or without pAI‐Alg5 was transformed into NMY51. To monitor the strength of the protein–protein interaction, each transformant was inoculated into liquid synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking Leu and Trp (SC–Leu–Trp) including 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 5 mm MES/KOH (pH 5.5), 0.067% –Leu/–Trp drop‐out supplement (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) and pre‐cultured overnight at 30‐C. A negative control strain (NMY51 pCCW‐Alg5) was pre‐cultured in SC–Leu. The pre‐culture was serially diluted 20–210‐fold using dilution medium including 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and spotted on various selection plates using a 96‐pin spotter (Tokken, Chiba, Japan), and incubated for 2 days at 30‐C. The SC–His plate comprised 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 2% agar, 0.062% CSM‐His (Q‐BIOgene, Irvine, CA, USA), 0.0016% Cys and 0.0016% Met. The casamino acids medium minus Ade contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 2% agar, 1% casamino acids, 0.004% Ura, 0.003% Trp, 0.0016% Cys and 0.0016% Met. The casamino acids medium plus Ade also contained 0.008% adenine hemisulfate.  To oxidize AtCPK21, 3 μm recombinant protein was incubated with 5 μm CuCl2 in 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2) for 1 h at 25‐C, and then the solution was exchanged into 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2) and 100 mm NaCl by gel filtration. The solution was concentrated using a Vivaspin 500 centrifugal filter unit (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Appleton, WI, USA). Oxidized AtCPK21 (2 μm) was incubated with DTT and Trx‐h1 at various concentrations for 1 h at 25‐C.  The activity of calcium‐dependent protein phosphorylation was measured as described previously CITATION. The assay was performed in 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm [γ‐32P]ATP (150 cpm/pmol), 0.5 mg/mL calf histone III‐S (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 100 nm AtCPK21 for 6 min at 30‐C with 100 μm CaCl2 or 100 μm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP and stopped by adding 20 mm HCl.  AtCPK21 oxidized by CuCl2 was digested by trypsin for 20 h at 37‐C in 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl. The tryptic peptides were separated and directly spotted onto a metal plate for mass analysis using a DiNa LC‐MALDI spotter system (KYA TECH, Tokyo, Japan), and their molecular mass was analyzed by MALDI‐TOF/TOF MS. The fraction containing a disulfide‐linked peptide was collected from the wells on the plate, dissolved in 50 mm Tris‐(2‐carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, and incubated for 1 h at 25‐C. The eluted peptides were desalted and analyzed by MALDI‐TOF/TOF MS. The resulting data were analyzed using proteinpilot software (Applied Biosystems).  Five‐day‐old T87 culture cells were collected by low‐speed centrifugation at 1000 g for 1 min, and 10 mL of cells were transferred to fresh medium (final 100 mL) with or without 10 mm H2O2, and incubated for 4 h at 22‐C in the dark. Aliquots of the cells were sampled at various time points, drained, washed six times with NaCl/Pi in a cell strainer (100 μm mesh, BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid and an equal volume of glass beads were added to the frozen cells, and the cells were disrupted using a MicroSmash homogenizer (Tomy, Tokyo, Japan). The homogenate was centrifuged at 860 g for 30 s at 4‐C, and the supernatant was decanted into a new tube. After one more centrifugation and decantation, the proteins were precipitated and dissolved in 1% SDS and 40 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2).  The proteins extracted from the cell cultures were separated by SDS/PAGE (7.5 or 10%) and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously CITATION. To assess the redox state of AtCPK21, the protein precipitates were dissolved in 10 mg/mL SUNBRIGHT® ME‐020MA PEG‐maleimide (2 kDa) (NOF, Tokyo, Japan), 1% SDS and 40 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2), and labeled by vigorous shaking for 30 min at 25‐C CITATION. The labeled proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE (7.5–15%) and immunostained. The polyclonal antibody was raised against whole recombinant AtCPK21 in rabbit. The antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography using recombinant proteins immobilized on CNBr‐activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The immunostained bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) on an LAS‐1000plus chemiluminescence image analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan).  Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio‐Rad protein assay (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) unless otherwise specified.
