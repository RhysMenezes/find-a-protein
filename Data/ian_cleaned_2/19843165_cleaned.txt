!~ABS~! In Arabidopsis thaliana, the BTB/POZ‐MATH (BPM) proteins comprise a small family of six members. They have been described previously to use their broad complex, tram track, bric‐a‐brac/POX virus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domain to assemble with CUL3a and CUL3b and potentially to serve as substrate adaptors to cullin‐based E3‐ligases in plants. In this article, we show that BPMs can also assemble with members of the ethylene response factor/Apetala2 transcription factor family, and that this is mediated by their meprin and TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor) homology (MATH) domain. In addition, we provide a detailed description of BPM gene expression patterns in different tissues and on abiotic stress treatments, as well as their subcellular localization. This work connects, for the first time, BPM proteins with ethylene response factor/Apetala2 family members, which is likely to represent a novel regulatory mechanism of transcriptional control.

!~RES~! Because it has been shown previously that Arabidopsis BPM proteins use their BTB/POZ domain to interact with the cullins CUL3A and CUL3B [CITATION, CITATION, CITATION], we investigated what kind of protein–protein interactions were facilitated by their MATH domains by performing two yeast two‐hybrid (Y2H) screens on a root‐specific cDNA library. One screen was performed with a full‐length BPM3 (At2g39760), whereas, for the other, we used a BPM1 (At5g19000) fragment that lacked the BTB/POZ domain [denoted as BPM1(1–189); Fig. 1B]. As both the MATH and BTB domains mediate assembly with other proteins, we speculated that this dual approach would not only identify specific interactors for the MATH domain, but would also provide information on to what extent the two different MATH domains of BPM1 and BPM3 target the same group of proteins (see Table S1A,B for identity/similarity comparisons of BPM proteins and their MATH domains, respectively).  [[FIGURE]] In total, 250 yeast clones were analyzed as primary positives and, consistent with earlier studies [CITATION], BPM4 was found using BPM3 as bait (data not shown). However, predominantly, we identified RAP2.4 (At1g78080; related to Apetala2.4), which was found 15 times with BPM3 and 18 times with the BPM1(1–189) fragment (Fig. 1A). RAP2.4 belongs to the ERF/AP2 family of transcription factors and contains a single AP2 domain. The protein has been described previously in context with abiotic stress tolerance, red light response and ethylene signaling [CITATION]. We also identified once At1g22190 in the BPM3 screen, which is the closest relative of RAP2.4 [CITATION]. It should be noted that both RAP2.4 and At1g22190 were isolated as partial clones lacking the first 60 amino acids (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that this region is not essential for assembly with BPM proteins. As 12 RAP2 proteins have been annotated previously [CITATION], we retained this nomenclature and denoted At1g22190 as RAP2.13.  To further confirm the interaction of RAP2.4 and RAP2.13 with BPM proteins, we cloned the corresponding full‐length cDNAs for both genes, generated GST fusion proteins and tested these in pulldown assays with BPM1(1–189). As shown in Fig. 1C, BPM1(1–189) coprecipitated with both GST:RAP2 proteins, but not with GST alone, further corroborating the Y2H data. Because RAP2.4 and RAP2.13 are closely related to each other, we mainly focused on RAP2.4 as a representative example in subsequent experiments. Here, RAP2.4 also interacted with a full‐length BPM1 (using a GST:BPM1 protein) and with itself (using GST:RAP2.4) (Fig. 1D). Additional pulldown assays positively confirmed binding to BPM2, BPM4, BPM5 and BPM6 (Fig. 1E). To exclude nonspecific assembly with BPM proteins, we decided to test At1g65050. This protein has no BTB motif, but contains a MATH domain that is most closely related to those from BPMs [CITATION]. In these experiments, RAP2.4 did not interact with At1g65050 (Fig. 1E), which is a critical finding as it suggests that RAP2.4–BPM assembly is specific.  The use of a truncated version of BPM1 in the Y2H screens demonstrated that the BTB domain is not involved in the assembly with RAP2.4. However, BPM1(1–189) still contains nearly 80 amino acids that are not part of the MATH domain and which could represent possible interaction sites for RAP2.4. To further confirm that a full‐length MATH domain is sufficient for binding to RAP2.4, we generated a new truncated BPM1 version of 151 amino acids [BPM1(1–151)] comprising the first 38 amino acids of BPM1 followed by the complete MATH domain. As shown in Fig. 2A, BPM1(1–151) is entirely capable of binding to GST:RAP2.4, making it highly probable that only the MATH domain is required for RAP2.4–BPM1 assembly.  [[FIGURE]] Likewise, we were interested in the RAP2.4 region that mediates the assembly with BPM1 proteins. Its AP2 domain stretches from amino acid residue 150 to 214. To test whether a functional AP2 domain is critical for assembly with BPMs, we took advantage of an earlier description of ap2‐1 and ap2‐5 mutants, in which mutation of a glycine residue in the AP2 domain disrupts the protein’s DNA‐binding affinity [CITATION, CITATION]. This glycine is highly conserved and can also be found in RAP2.4 at position 179 [CITATION]. However, the introduction of a point mutation that changed the glycine residue to serine [RAP2.4(G179S)] did not affect assembly with GST:BPM1, indicating that a functional AP2 domain is not required for this type of interaction. Next, we generated several truncated versions of RAP2.4 that were translated in vitro and tested for interaction with GST:BPM1. As we originally found truncated versions of RAP2.4 and RAP2.13 that were missing the first 60 amino acids in the Y2H screens, we started out with further reduced versions that lacked the first 116, 125 and 134 amino acids. Although complete deletion of the first 116 and 125 amino acids [RAP2.4(125–END)] did not affect coprecipitation with GST:BPM1, we could not detect interaction with a truncated version that lacked the first 134 amino acids [RAP2.4(134–END)] (Fig. 2D). In addition, deletion of amino acid residues C‐terminal from the AP2 domain [RAP2.4(1–251)] did not affect the interaction with GST:BPM1 (Fig. 2C). We therefore conclude that a critical region for assembly with BPM proteins is located within amino acid residues 125–251 of RAP2.4.  Although the interaction studies presented demonstrate that all BPM proteins can assemble with RAP2.4, and even provide strong evidence for the assembly of the transcription factor in planta, it is still unclear whether BPM and RAP2.4 genes are expressed in the same tissues. Consequently, we analyzed the tissue‐specific expression patterns of all BPM genes and RAP2.4 via semiquantitative RT‐PCR, and further described their expression in greater detail using promoter:GUS lines (referred to as proBPM:GUS and proPRAP2.4:GUS, respectively).  The results from RT‐PCR showed that BPM2 and BPM5 were strongly expressed in all tested tissues (roots, rosette and cauline leaves, stems and flowers) (Fig. 3A). Although BPM6 was also strongly expressed, its expression level was weaker overall in comparison with BPM2 and BPM5. For BPM1 and BPM3, we could hardly detect expression in the different tissues, and had to load double the amount of RT‐PCR products on the gels to visualize any PCR products (Fig. 3A). BPM1 showed only slightly higher expression levels in root and flower, and BPM3 expression levels showed little variation between the different tissues (Fig. 3A). BPM4 also showed little variation, and expression was lower than that of the other BPM genes. In this case, we had to load triple the amount of RT‐PCR product relative to that used for BPM2 and BPM5. Finally, RAP2.4 was expressed strongly in roots, rosette and cauline leaves, and flowers, with slightly weaker expression levels in the stem (Fig. 3A).  [[FIGURE]] Because RAP2.4 has been described previously to play a role in abiotic stress tolerance, we tested whether expression of the different BPM genes was regulated by salt (NaCl), osmotic (sorbitol) and drought stress. Treatment of Col0 wild‐type plants with 200 mm NaCl for 6 h resulted in a clear up‐regulation of BPM1 and BPM5 expression (Fig. 3B). We also observed an up‐regulation of BPM1 and BPM5 after treatment with sorbitol for 6 h, together with increased BPM4 levels (Fig. 3B). RAP2.4 also responded to both treatments with enhanced expression, which is in agreement with earlier findings from Lin et al. [CITATION] (Fig. 3B). Drought stress only induced the expression of BPM1 and BPM4; all other BPM genes and RAP2.4 remained unchanged (Fig. 3B). Overall, these data indicate that BPM1, BPM4 and BPM5 are involved in the abiotic stress response.  The analysis of transgenic plants carrying the different promoter:GUS constructs showed, for proBPM1:GUS lines, GUS expression in pollen, but also in stipules and leaf hydathodes (Fig. 4A). Rosette leaves showed staining within the vascular tissue at the end of the leaf blade, whereas the basal parts close to the petiole remained almost unstained. We observed clear GUS expression in the primary root of 7‐day‐old seedlings, strongest at the base of emerging lateral roots, but no expression at detectable levels in the tips of primary and budding lateral roots. proBPM2:GUS lines (Fig. 4B) showed strong expression in the vascular tissue of cotyledons and rosette leaves, and in most parts of the flower. Similar to proBPM1:GUS, strong staining was detectable in the stipules, pollen and at the base of siliques. Expression in roots was detectable along the primary but not lateral roots, with strongest staining present at the budding lateral root primordia. proBPM3:GUS lines showed clear GUS expression in the root tips, but also in the stipules, anthers and in the central veins and petioles of rosette leaves (Fig. 4C). proBPM4:GUS showed GUS staining very similar to that of proBPM3:GUS in the stipules, the central veins of rosette leaves and in the anthers of differentiated flowers. We also detected meagre expression along the root, with most obvious staining present at the lateral root primordia and the base of the lateral roots, and also in the columella (Fig. 4D). Like proBPM2:GUS, proBPM5:GUS plants showed a wide range of expression patterns in all tested organs (Fig. 4E). Both cauline and rosette leaves showed strong GUS expression, as did the primary root tips and the stem, whereas, in the flower, expression was detectable in the petals, stamen and stigmata. In proBPM6:GUS lines, we saw GUS expression in the vascular tissue of cotyledons and mature leaves, whereas, in the flowers, the anthers, connectives and filaments and the base and tip of the stigmata were stained. Similar to BPM2, BPM3 and BPM5 promoter:GUS lines, the root tips were strongly stained, with the exception of columella cells which remained nearly white (Fig. 4F). Finally, proPRAP2.4:GUS lines showed blue staining in cotyledons of 3‐day‐old seedlings, but not in parts of the hypocotyls (Fig. 4G). In rosette leaves, we observed expression in the vascular tissue of the leaf blade, whereas, interestingly, in older parts of the midrib, no GUS expression was detectable. This was different from cauline leaves, in which all vascular tissue was stained. In the flower, we detected GUS expression exclusively in the pollen. Siliques were stained at the base and at the tip, with overall very weak staining of the fused carpels. In the root, the central cylinder was stained, whereas the primary root tips and tips of emerging lateral roots showed no blue staining (Fig. 4G, part f, marked by arrows).  [[FIGURE]] Using a GFP:RAP2.4 fusion protein, it has recently been established that RAP2.4 is primarily located in the nucleus [CITATION]. Accordingly, one would expect that this organelle would be the most likely location for the assembly of BPM proteins with RAP2.4. We generated expression constructs for all BPM genes; however, only for BPM4 were we able to obtain GFP:BPM4 overexpressing plants. As an alternative approach to investigate the subcellular localization of the different BPM proteins, we transiently expressed them in tobacco leaves. We also included GFP:RAP2.4 and GFP:CUL3a in these experiments to compare their localization with that of BPM proteins.  Transient expression of GFP:BPM1 and GFP:BPM2 revealed that both proteins, like GFP:RAP2.4, were primarily localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5 and Fig. S2). The predominantly nuclear localization of BPM1 and BPM2 GFP fusion proteins contrasted with all other BPMs, as GFP:BPM3, GFP:BPM5 and GFP:BPM6 were found inside as well as outside the nucleus. Remarkably, GFP:BPM4 was the only BPM protein that was excluded from the nucleus, suggesting that BPM4 and RAP2.4 are not present in the same cellular compartments. We observed this in transient expression assays, but also in Arabidopsis plants that stably expressed GFP:BPM4 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3). Also noteworthy was the observation that GFP:CUL3a showed a subcellular localization pattern similar to GFP:BPM3, GFP:BPM5 and GFP:BPM6. Overall, these analyses revealed a very distinct and different localization for the different BPM proteins, which might reflect their diverse biological roles in the cell. In addition, they indicate that, except for BPM4, all other BPM proteins are potentially able to interact with RAP2.4 in planta, and also that CUL3a can assemble with other proteins either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm.

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col0) and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants were grown under standard conditions with 16 h : 8 h light : dark cycles in either soil or sterile culture, using ATS medium [CITATION] without supplemented sucrose. Arabidopsis floral dip transformation was performed as described in [CITATION].  Full‐length cDNAs of BPM genes were amplified from a seedling‐specific cDNA library [CITATION]. The promoters of the different BPM genes and RAP2.4 (for sizes, see Table S1), as well as AP2/ERF transcription factors, were amplified directly from Col0 genomic DNA. In all cases, Pfu polymerase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) was used and the PCR products were controlled for correct sequences. The cDNAs obtained were subcloned into pDONR221 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and shuffled into different destination vectors using GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen): pACT2 and pBTM116 [CITATION] for Y2H studies, pDEST15 (Invitrogen) for Escherichia coli expression and the binary vector pK7FWG2 [CITATION] for subcellular localization analysis. The amplified promoters were subcloned into pCR2.1 by TOPO TA reaction (Invitrogen). Afterwards, using the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites, the promoters were fused to the GUS gene in the binary vector pCB308 [CITATION]. The primers used in this and other sections are given in Table S2. Mutagenesis was performed using a mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA) as described previously [CITATION].  Expression was studied by RT‐PCR with gene‐specific primers, and histochemically using promoter‐GUS fusions. RT‐PCR was performed on 100 ng of total RNA isolated from different tissues of mature Arabidopsis ecotype Col0 plants grown on soil, or on total RNA extracted from 7‐day‐old seedlings grown on plates, respectively. For histochemical analysis, promoters in the binary vector pCB308 were introduced into Arabidopsis plants. Transgenic plants were selected by BASTA herbicide (Aventis Crop Science, Leverkusen, Germany). GUS staining was carried out by vacuum infiltration of plant material with staining solution [CITATION] and subsequent incubation at room temperature for up to 24 h. For stress treatment, 7‐day‐old sterile‐grown seedlings were transferred for 6 h into liquid ATS medium supplemented with either 200 mm NaCl or sorbitol. To impose drought stress on 7‐day‐old seedlings, the lids from culture dishes were removed for 6 h before the samples were harvested.  Screening for BPM‐interacting clones was performed using a root‐specific suspension cell cDNA library in the prey vector pACT2‐GW [CITATION]. The MATH domain of BPM1 and full‐length BPM3 were cloned into the bait vector pBTM116‐D9‐GW [CITATION]. Yeast transformation and testing for interaction were performed as described in [CITATION]. Clones were transformed into yeast with an efficiency of 1.5 million clones per transformation. All BPM‐interacting clones were tested for auto‐activation and sequenced for the correct open reading frame in pACT2.  Fluorescent fusion proteins of the six BPM proteins, CUL3a and RAP2.4 were transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells using the method of Agrobacterium infiltration as described in [CITATION]. The bacterial attenuance (D) at 600 nm was 0.01–0.03 for all constructs. In addition, BPM4 localization was also analyzed in stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP:BPM4 fusion protein. In all cases, binary GFP expression vectors obtained from [CITATION] were used. Transfected leaf sections were imaged using a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope.  For interaction studies, full‐length BPM proteins, fragments of BPM1 and selected ERF/AP2 proteins were expressed in the TNT‐reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as described previously [CITATION]. In vitro‐translated proteins were labeled with either [35S]methionine (Amersham, Chalfont St Giles, UK) or greenLysine (Promega).  BPM1 (At5g19000/Q8L765); BPM2 (At3g06190/Q9M8J9); BPM3 (At2g39760/O22286); BPM4 (At3g03740/Q9SRV1); BPM5 (At5g21010/Q1EBV6); BPM6 (At3g43700/A1L4W5); RAP2.4 (At1g78080/Q8H1E4); RAP2.13 (At1g22190/Q9LM15).
