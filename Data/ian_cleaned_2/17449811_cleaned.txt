!~ABS~! The SOS (for Salt Overly Sensitive) pathway plays essential roles in conferring salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under salt stress, the calcium sensor SOS3 activates the kinase SOS2 that positively regulates SOS1, a plasma membrane sodium/proton antiporter. We show that SOS3 acts primarily in roots under salt stress. By contrast, the SOS3 homolog SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCABP8)/CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 functions mainly in the shoot response to salt toxicity. While root growth is reduced in sos3 mutants in the presence of NaCl, the salt sensitivity of scabp8 is more prominent in shoot tissues. SCABP8 is further shown to bind calcium, interact with SOS2 both in vitro and in vivo, recruit SOS2 to the plasma membrane, enhance SOS2 activity in a calcium-dependent manner, and activate SOS1 in yeast. In addition, sos3 scabp8 and sos2 scabp8 display a phenotype similar to sos2, which is more sensitive to salt than either sos3 or scabp8 alone. Overexpression of SCABP8 in sos3 partially rescues the sos3 salt-sensitive phenotype. However, overexpression of SOS3 fails to complement scabp8. These results suggest that SCABP8 and SOS3 are only partially redundant in their function, and each plays additional and unique roles in the plant salt stress response.
!~RES~! CITATION and CITATION reported that SOS1 and SOS2 were expressed in both root and shoot tissues in Arabidopsis. By contrast, an examination of the microarray results in the public domain (http://jsp.weigelworld.org/expviz/expviz.jsp) indicated that SOS3 was strongly expressed in roots but only at background level in shoots, suggesting that SOS3 mainly functions in root. We therefore speculated that an SOS3 homolog or SOS2-regulatory protein may function in shoots to regulate SOS2. Interestingly, we noticed that of the other nine SOS3-like calcium binding proteins, SCABP8 is the only one expressed strongly in shoots but very weakly in roots in this microarray data set. To confirm these results, RT-PCR analysis was performed. The transcripts of SOS2 could be amplified from roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and siliques, whereas SOS3 was only detected in roots. SCABP8 was expressed at a high level in leaves and stems but at a very low level in roots, flowers, and siliques (Figure 1A ), consistent with microarray data in the public domain. [[FIGURE]] To examine whether expression of SOS2, SOS3, and SCABP8 is induced by NaCl treatment, total RNA was extracted from wild-type plants treated with 100 mM NaCl for 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Consistent with previous results (CITATION), the expression of SOS2, but not SOS3, was induced by NaCl treatment (Figure 1B). The transcript of SCABP8 was slightly induced 6 h after treatment and decreased after 24 h (Figure 1B). The SCABP8 gene contains nine exons and eight introns and encodes a 246–amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 28.3 kD and isoelectric point of 4.3. Two SCABP8 cDNAs were amplified and sequenced. Two bands pertaining to SCABP8 were amplified from aerial parts, whereas only the lower band yielded in roots (Figure 1A). The shorter sequence is identical to At4g33000.2 (http://www.arabidopsis.org), while the longer retains its seventh intron, which contains a premature stop codon that results in a truncated protein 194 amino acids long. Overexpression of this mis-spliced SCABP8 cDNA could not complement the scabp8 salt sensitivity phenotype (data not shown). To further determine the tissue specificity of these genes, promoter regions of SOS2 (1.6 kb), SOS3 (1.4 kb), and SCABP8 (1.7 kb) were fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. The resulting constructs were transferred into an Arabidopsis Columbia (Col-0) background. For each construct, 12 independent F2 transgenic lines were analyzed by a GUS staining assay. Though the intensity of the GUS staining from each of the independent lines was variable, the tissue-specific localization was the same. As shown in Figures 1C to 1F, GUS driven by the SOS2 promoter was expressed in the entire young seedling, leaf, stem, and flower and was particularly strong in root tips. Similar expression has been detected in SOS1 promoter-GUS transgenic plants (CITATION). Consistent with microarray and RT-PCR results, GUS expression driven by the SOS3 promoter was only detected in root and very strongly in the root tip (Figures 1G to 1I) but not other tissues. However, SCABP8-GUS was expressed only in the stem, leaf, flower, and weakly in root but not in the root tip (Figures 1J to 1O). The combined pattern of SCABP8 and SOS3 expression overlaps with that of SOS2 and suggests that SCABP8 and SOS3 may assume similar roles in different tissue types to activate SOS2 in response to salt stress. To test the hypothesis that SCABP8 is a tissue-specific activator of SOS2, the Arabidopsis mutant line SALK_056042 with a T-DNA insertion in the SCABP8 gene was obtained from the ABRC (CITATION). The T-DNA insertion is located in the seventh intron of the SCABP8 gene and was confirmed by PCR using a SCABP8-specific primer and T-DNA left border primers (data not shown; Figure 2A ). The insertion was further confirmed by a DNA gel blot probed with a neomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence (nptII). Genomic DNA was extracted from scabp8, digested by three restriction enzymes, EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI, which are the enzymes with a single digesting site in the pBIN-pROK2 vector, and subjected to DNA gel blot analysis. Only one strongly hybridizing band from each digestion was observed with different molecular sizes (Figure 2C). Two weaker bands of similar sizes were detected in all three digestions, suggesting they were nonspecific. These data suggest that there was a single T-DNA insertion in the scabp8 mutant. To precisely map the border sequences flanking the T-DNA insertion, PCR reactions were performed with combinations of the primers annealing upstream or downstream of the T-DNA insertion into the SCABP8 gene and primers specific to the left border or right border of the T-DNA. The PCR products were sequenced, and the results indicated that the T-DNA insertion had generated an 18-bp deletion from 1264 to 1281 bp downstream of the SCABP8 translation start codon, in the seventh intron. This insertion point matches the sequence shown on the SALK website. The absence of a full-length SCABP8 transcript in the scabp8 mutant was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Figure 2B). However, a truncated SCABP8 transcript corresponding to a fragment before the T-DNA insertion, but not after, still existed in the scabp8 mutant (Figure 2B). Overexpression of this truncated SCABP8 transcript did not rescue the scabp8 salt phenotype (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To test the salt sensitivity of the scabp8 mutant, 5-d-old mutant and wild-type plants were transferred to Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with or without NaCl. Indeed, scabp8 was hypersensitive to NaCl, mainly in the shoot tissues, but developed normally when grown on MS medium lacking NaCl (Figure 2D). On MS medium containing 50 mM NaCl, the primary root growth of scabp8 was indistinguishable from the wild type (Figures 2D and 2F). The number and length of secondary roots were reduced relative to the wild type, but the overall root fresh weight was reduced only ∼12% (Figures 2D, 2G, 2H, and 2J). However, shoot growth was more severely inhibited (30% fresh weight reduction) and leaves were smaller and darker in color compared with the wild type (Figures 2D, 2E, and 2I). On 100 mM NaCl medium, growth inhibition was more pronounced. The shoot fresh weight of scabp8 was less than half of the wild type. The lateral root growth was also further restricted, as evidenced by reduced fresh weight and shorter and lesser lateral roots. However, the primary root growth was significantly less affected (Figures 2E and 2F). To complement the scabp8 salt-sensitive phenotype, a 3783-bp genomic DNA fragment corresponding to the sequence from 1736 bp upstream of the SCABP8 translation start codon to 469 bp downstream of the stop codon was excised from the BAC clone F26P21 with XbaI and PstI. The fragment was then cloned into the pCAMBIA1200 vector, and the resulting construct was transferred into the scabp8 mutant. All 12 independent T2 transgenic lines tested under salt treatment showed growth patterns similar to wild-type plants (Figures 2E to 2J), demonstrating that the NaCl sensitivity phenotype of scabp8 is due to the loss of function of SCABP8. The transcription level of SCABP8 in these transgenic lines was similar to the wild type (Figure 2B). To determine whether the growth defects of the scabp8 mutant are specific to the sodium response, wild-type and scabp8 seedlings were treated with various salts, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, and plant hormones. The results are shown in Figure 3 . Though scabp8 seedlings were very sensitive to 100 mM NaCl and NaNO3 (Figures 3A and 3C), they failed to show significant growth differences with the wild type on the medium containing 100 mM KCl or KNO3 (Figures 3B and 3D). The scabp8 seedlings were also as tolerant as the wild type to 15 and 20% polyethylene glycol, 150 and 200 mM mannitol, and plant hormones abscisic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and gibberellic acid (data not shown). Individual sos1, sos2, and sos3 mutants are hypersensitive to Na+ and Li+ but not to Cs+ (CITATION). Our findings indicate that the scabp8 mutant behaves similarly (Figures 3E and 3F). Though more sensitive to 10 mM LiCl than the wild type (Figure 3E), the scabp8 mutant did not show obvious differences in growth on MS medium with 3 mM CsCl, which inhibited wild-type growth by half (Figure 3F). The similar behaviors of sos and scabp8 mutants under ionic stresses suggest that scabp8 may perform a critical function in the SOS pathway. [[FIGURE]] Compared with sos3, salt sensitivity of scabp8 is more prominent in shoot tissues. On a MS medium, sos2, sos3, scabp8, and wild-type plants showed similar shoot growth and root bending patterns (Figure 3G). When grown on MS medium containing 75 mM NaCl, both root bending and shoot growth of sos2 were dramatically reduced (Figure 3H). Root growth was completely arrested and fresh weight was less than one-third that of the wild type (Figure 3M). Both primary and lateral root growth of sos3 were also reduced relative to the wild-type level, though less severely than in sos2. The fresh weight of seedlings, which mainly represents shoot growth, was the highest in sos3 among the three mutants (Figure 3M), suggesting that SOS3 function was less critical to mediate salt response in shoots. However, scabp8 showed severely reduced shoot growth when compared with the wild type or sos3. The fresh weight of scabp8 was reduced to less than half of that of the wild type and was also less than that of sos3 (Figures 3H and 3M). By contrast, both the primary root length and lateral root length and number of scabp8 under this treatment were reduced much less than in sos3 (Figures 3J to 3L). When 4-week-old soil-grown plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl for 2 weeks, the growth of wild-type plants was slightly inhibited and old leaves accumulated anthocyanin. The older leaves from all three mutants were bleached. A few young leaves of sos3 and sos2 survived but none from scabp8 (Figure 3I). We further tested whether expression of stress-responsive genes is affected by scabp8 mutation in response to NaCl in an RNA gel blot assay. These genes included RD29A, Cor15A, Cor47, and Kin1. No significant difference was detected between the mutant and the wild type (data not shown). The sos2 sos3 double mutant shows a salt-sensitive phenotype similar to sos2 and greater than sos3, suggesting that SOS2 and SOS3 genetically function in the same pathway and that SOS2 has additional functions in salt tolerance relative to SOS3 (CITATION). To determine whether SCABP8 and SOS2 interact genetically, the scabp8 T-DNA insertion line was crossed with sos2 and sos3 mutants. From ∼100 F2 plants of each cross, five sos2 scabp8 and seven sos3 scabp8 double mutants were identified. The double mutants were then crossed into their parental backgrounds to confirm the genotypes (the sos2-2 allele bears an untagged 2-bp deletion that prevented PCR-based genotyping). We transferred 5-d-old wild-type, mutant, and double mutant seedlings onto MS medium with or without 75 mM NaCl. In the absence of NaCl treatment, none of the mutants showed any significant growth differences compared with the wild type (Figure 4A ). As in the sos2 sos3 double mutant (CITATION), sos2 scabp8 seedlings also displayed salt-sensitive features similar to sos2, shown in shoot and root growth, and chlorophyll and anthocynanin accumulation (Figures 4B to 4H). No additional phenotypic difference was observed between sos2 and sos2 scabp8, suggesting that SOS2 and SCABP8 function in the same pathway. Under 75 mM NaCl treatment, both root and shoot growth of the sos3 scabp8 double mutant plants were more severely reduced compared with the sos3 and scabp8 single mutants. The phenotype of sos3 scabp8 showed slightly higher lateral root number than sos2 but otherwise resembled sos2 (Figures 4B to 4H). These results further support a model in which SCABP8 and SOS3 function together to modulate the activity of SOS2. [[FIGURE]] If SCABP8 has partial functional redundancy with SOS3 and regulates SOS2 in the tissues that do not express SOS3, SCABP8 also would be expected to interact with and activate SOS2. This was tested by cloning the SCABP8 cDNA into the pGEX-6P-1 vector containing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, with similar constructs made for SOS2 and SOS3. The FISL motif in the SOS2 regulatory domain is necessary and sufficient for SOS3 interaction (CITATION). As a negative control, an SOS2ΔFISL fragment (SOS2 with deletion of the FISL motif) was also generated by PCR mutagenesis and cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector. The GST-SCABP8, -SOS3, -SOS2, and -SOS2ΔFISL fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using glutathione affinity chromatography. SOS3 and SCABP8 were digested from their GST fusion protein by PreScission protease and subjected to in vitro pull-down assays. As expected, SOS3 was pulled down by GST-SOS2 but not by GST-SOS2ΔFISL (data not shown). Similarly, the FISL motif was also required for the interaction of SOS2 with SCABP8. SCABP8 was pulled down by GST-SOS2 but not by GST-SOS2ΔFISL (Figure 5A ). To confirm whether or not the pulled-down band was SCABP8, 1% of the input and pull-down samples were subjected to protein gel blot analysis with anti-SCABP8 antibodies. The result showed that SCABP8 protein was only detected in GST-SOS2 samples but not in GST-SOS2ΔFISL (Figure 5A). To further test whether the interaction of SOS2 with SOS3 or SCABP8 is calcium dependent, 250 μM calcium was included in the buffer in the presence or absence of 500 μM EGTA. The interaction of SOS2 and SCABP8 was not affected by the presence of free calcium (data not shown). This result is consistent with the previous findings that the SOS3 and SOS2 interaction in vitro does not require calcium (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To determine the interaction of SOS2 and SCABP8 in vivo, we cloned SOS2 or SOS2ΔFISL cDNA into the split–yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) vector pUC-SPYNE (CITATION) and cloned SCABP8 or SOS3 into the pUC-SPYCE vector. The resulting plasmids and empty vectors were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and used for transient transfection assays with protoplasts. Different combinations of SOS2/SOS2ΔFISL/pUC-SPYNE and SOS3/SCABP8/pUC-SPYCE were cotransfected into the Col-0 leaf protoplasts. The protoplasts were analyzed under a confocal microscope to detect YFP bimolecular complementation and then stained with 5 μg/mL fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and 1 μg/mL propidium iodide to check protoplast viability. The YFP signal was detected in SOS3-YFPC/SOS2-YFPN and SCABP8-YFPC /SOS2-YFPN cotransfection assays in protoplasts stained normally with FDA (Figure 5B). However, we were not able to observe interaction between SOS2ΔFISL and SOS3 or SCABP8, although >90% of protoplasts were stained with FDA after transfection. The YFP signal was not detected with any single construct individually or with the combinations of SOS2 and pUC-SPYCE or SOS3/SCABP8 and pUC-SPYNE. Together, these results indicate that SOS2 interacts with SOS3 and SCABP8 in vivo and that the FISL motif is required for these interactions (Figure 5B; data not shown). Images obtained by bimolecular complementation were consistent with the localization of protein complexes near or at the plasma membrane, although we could not resolve whether these interactions between SOS2 and SOS3 or SCABP8 occurred in other cell compartments also. CITATION showed that SOS3 recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane in a yeast system. To determine if SCABP8 recruited SOS2 to the plasma membrane in planta, YFP-SOS2 and YFP-SCABP8 fusion constructs were transferred to Col-0, scabp8, and sos2 plants. YFP-SOS2 and YFP-SCABP8 rescued the sos2 and scabp8 salt-sensitive phenotypes, respectively, and did not cause additional phenotypes, suggesting that both YFP fusion proteins are functional in plants (data not shown). The YFP-SOS2 and YFP-SCABP8 localization was imaged in the T2 generation using a confocal microscope (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Twelve independent T2 transgenic lines expressing the individual constructs were analyzed in different genetic backgrounds. In Col-0, both YFP-SOS2 and YFP-SCABP8 were localized to the cell periphery, and a low level of YFP signal also could be detected at the cytoplasm (see Supplemental Figures 1A and 1C online). To exclude the possibility of cell wall association of SOS2 and SCABP8, the transgenic plants were plasmolyzed by mannitol treatment. Both YFP-SOS2 and YFP–SCABP8 signals were detached from the cell wall (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1D online). Transgenic plants expressing YFP alone (see Supplemental Figures 1G and 1H online), the cytoplasmic acidic ribosomal green fluorescent protein (GFP) (see Supplemental Figures 1I to 1J) (CITATION), and the plasma membrane water channel protein (PIP2a)-GFP (see Supplemental Figures 1K and 1L online) (CITATION) were used as controls. When YFP-SOS2 was expressed in the scabp8 mutant, YFP-SOS2 was detected more abundantly in the cytoplasm in comparison to the wild-type background (see Supplemental Figure 1E online). After mannitol treatment, YFP-SOS2 was clearly aggregated in the cytosol (see Supplemental Figure 1F online). These determinations were conducted in the upper part of seedling roots where the analysis of promoter-GUS fusions demonstrated a significant expression of SOS2 and SCABP8 genes, whereas that of SOS3 was undetectable (Figure 1). These results indicate that although the localization of SOS2 and SCABP8 was not exclusively at the plasma membrane, SCABP8 enhanced the fraction of SOS2 bound to the plasma membrane. To further test the localization of SCABP8 in plant cells, a translational fusion was constructed in which GFP was added to the C terminus of SCABP8. The chimeric construct was delivered into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment, and transient expression of SCABP8-GFP was monitored by epifluorescence. As shown in Figure 6A , SCABP8-GFP was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane at 20 h after DNA delivery. However, at longer times (40 h), significant labeling of the cytoplasm was also observed (Figures 6B and 6C). The large vacuole of epidermal cells confined most of the cytoplasm to a thin layer, except in places where the tonoplast was separated from the cell periphery by nuclei and pockets of cytosol. Plasmolization with 0.5 M sorbitol permitted a clear visualization of the detached plasma membrane labeled with SCABP8-GFP (Figures 6D and 6E). Removal of a hydrophobic domain near the N terminus of SCABP8 (see below) resulted in a much more prominent labeling of cytosol and nuclei (Figures 6F and 6G) similar to GFP alone (data not shown). These results indicate that SCABP8 is partially associated with the plasma membrane and that this interaction requires the hydrophobic N terminus of the protein. [[FIGURE]] We were not able to detect YFP-SOS2 signal in shoot tissues of transgenic plants. To test the subcellular localization of SOS2 in leaf cells, a YFP-SOS2 plasmid construct was transferred into leaf protoplasts derived from wild-type and scabp8 plants. The YFP-SOS2 signal was observed at both the cell periphery and the cytoplasm in wild-type protoplasts. However, in the scabp8 protoplast, YFP-SOS2 was more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (see Supplemental Figures 2B and 2C online). When YFP-SCABP8, YFP-AtVAM3 (CITATION), and CFP-PIP2a were expressed in wild-type leaf protoplasts, YFP-AtVAM3 signal was detected in the vacuolar membrane, CFP-PIP2a was in the plasma membrane, and YFP-SCABP8 showed a pattern similar to that of YFP-SOS2 in scabp8 (see Supplemental Figures 2A to 2E online). Coexpression of CFP-PIP2a and YFP-SCABP8 indicated that part of the YFP and CFP signals overlapped in the plasma membrane, although YFP-SCABP8 was also detected in the cytoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 2F online). Similar results were obtained from the coexpression of CFP-PIP2a and YFP-SOS2 in wild-type protoplasts (see Supplemental Figure 2G online). To test further the recruitment of SOS2 by SCABP8 to the plasma membrane, a myc tag in a cluster of six tandem repeats was fused to the N terminus of SOS2, SOS2ΔFISL, and SCABP8. The tagged proteins were expressed in leaf protoplasts of the wild type and scabp8 mutant. Pellets of microsomal membrane fraction and soluble fraction were prepared from the protoplasts and subjected to protein gel blot analysis with anti-myc antibody. The results are shown in Figure 7A . The tagged SOS2 protein was detected almost exclusively in the membranous fraction of wild-type plants. Using the same protein samples, MPK3 protein kinase was found in the soluble fraction. However, in the scabp8 mutant, myc-SOS2 was found in both soluble and microsomal fractions, consistent with the YFP-SOS2 results (see Supplemental Figure 1 online), showing that SCABP8 enhances the association of SOS2 with the membranes. When the FISL motif was removed from SOS2, myc-SOS2ΔFISL was also detected in both pellet and soluble fractions and independently of the presence or no presence of SCABP8, suggesting that the FISL motif is required for the full association of SOS2 with the membrane, possibly through its interaction with SCABP8. However, these results also indicate that SOS2 can associate with membranes by a mechanism independent of SCABP proteins and the FISL interaction domain. [[FIGURE]] We also generated transgenic plants expressing the tagged myc-SCABP8 protein to be able to purify large quantities of purified plasma membrane fractions. The plasma membrane vesicles were isolated by the two-phase method (CITATION), and membrane purity was determined by measuring the inhibition of H+-ATPase activity with different H+-ATPase inhibitors (see Supplemental Table 1 online). The results showed that >88% ATPase activity in the vesicles obtained from the upper phase were blocked by 1 mM Na3VO4, an inhibitor of plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Five micrograms of protein from upper- and lower-phase fractions was subjected to a protein gel blot assay with anti-myc antibody. Tagged myc-SCABP8 was detected in the plasma membrane–enriched fraction (upper phase), the lower phase enriched in other cell membranes, and the soluble protein fraction (Figure 7B). However, myc-SCABP8 appeared to be moderately more abundant in the plasma membrane–enriched upper phase than in the lower phase. This result and presence of myc-SCABP8 in the soluble protein fraction are consistent with the microscopy localization of SCABP8. Because plasma membrane vesicles in the upper phase are mainly in right-side-out form, they could embrace some cytoplasmic proteins. We used 0.01% (w/v) Brij58 to treat the upper-phase vesicles to turn right-side-out vesicles to inside-out for releasing the embraced cytoplasmic proteins, and vesicles and soluble proteins were subjected to a protein gel blot assay with anti-myc antibody. Myc-SCABP8 protein was mainly present in the pellet fraction (Figure 7C). To further test how tightly SCABP8 associates with the plasma membrane, the upper-phase vesicles were treated with 0.01% Brij58 and with either 0.5 M NaCl, 1 M NaCl, 1 M KCl, 1 M KI, 0.1 M Na2CO3 at pH 11.5, 1% Triton X-100, or 3% SDS, respectively. Salt treatments with NaCl or KCl and alkaline treatment with Na2CO3 at pH 11.5 were not able to disassociate SCABP8 from the vesicles; the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and a chaotropic reagent KI could partially disassociate SCABP8, and only the anionic detergent SDS completely removed SCABP8 from the vesicles (Figure 7C). These data demonstrate that SCABP8 is tightly associated with cellular membranes. We transfected a myc-SOS2 construct into a large amount of leaf protoplasts of both the wild type and scabp8 mutant. Vesicles enriched in plasma membrane were purified by the two-phase method. The membrane purity was again determined by measuring the inhibition of ATPase activity with different H+-ATPase inhibitors (see Supplemental Table 2 online). One microgram of upper-phase protein and 5 μg of soluble proteins were subjected to a protein gel blot assay with anti-myc antibody. The results showed that myc-SOS2 was detected in both plasma membrane–enriched and soluble fractions in the scabp8 mutant but mainly in the vesicle fraction of wild-type protoplasts (Figure 7D). These results indicate that SOS2 is bound to the plasma membrane of leaf protoplasts and that it is partially released in the absence of SCABP8. Results in planta indicate that SCABP8 enhances the recruitment of SOS2 to the plasma membrane, albeit other mechanisms for membrane targeting of SOS2 acting independently of SCABP8 are also in place. Using a reconstituted SOS system in yeast, CITATION showed that SOS3 activates and recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane to facilitate the phosphorylation and stimulation of the Na+ efflux protein SOS1. To test whether SCABP8 achieves similar functions, we used the Sos Recruitment System (SRS) to monitor the recruitment of SOS2 to the plasma membrane of yeast in the absence of other ancillary elements specific to plants. A full-length SOS2 protein was translationally fused to the human hSos protein, a functional homolog of the yeast Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor CDC25. When protein–protein interaction occurs at the plasma membrane, recruitment of the human hSos protein restores Ras activation, allowing the growth at 37°C of the thermosensitive yeast mutant cdc25-2. As shown in Figure 8A , expression of the hSos-SOS2 reporter alone did not restore growth at the restrictive temperature, indicating a cytosolic localization, but coexpression of either SCABP8 or SOS3 resulted in the recruitment of SOS2 to the plasma membrane. Moreover, SCABP8 was fully competent for the activation of SOS1 when coexpressed with SOS2 (Figure 8B), as demonstrated by growth in plates containing 100 mM NaCl. Similarly to SOS3, SCABP8 alone or in combination with SOS2 did not affect the salt tolerance of yeast in the absence of SOS1 (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that SCABP8 and SOS3 perform similar roles in the activation of SOS1 by SOS2 and are in agreement with the sodium-sensitive phenotypes of sos2, sos3, and scabp8 mutant plants. [[FIGURE]] N-terminal myristoylation of SOS3 is essential for its function in vivo (CITATION). Three other SCABP/CALCINEURIN B-LIKE (CBL) proteins, CBL1, CBL5, and CBL9, also appear to become myristoylated, and this lipid modification is thought to be important for protein–membrane interaction (CITATION). SCABP8 does not contain any consensus sequence for acylation or prenylation, but it has a conspicuous hydrophobic domain between amino acid residues Val-13 and Val-35, which is long enough to span across a membrane once (Figure 8D). To test whether this hydrophobic domain mediates the tight association of SCABP8 with membranes (Figure 7), an internal deletion removing amino acids between Val-13 and Val-35 was generated in SCABP8 by mutagenic PCR. The truncated protein (SCABP8ΔN) became unable to recruit the hSos-SOS2 reporter protein to the plasma membrane as evidenced by the SRS assay (Figure 8C). This failure could not be attributed to lack of interaction with SOS2 because the truncated protein retained the ability to activate SOS1 via SOS2 (Figure 8E). A SCABP8ΔN-hSos translational fusion failed to show targeting to the plasma membrane in contrast with wild-type SCABP8 (data not shown). Thus, the differential salt tolerance conveyed by SCABP8 and SCABP8ΔN likely results from the lack of plasma membrane targeting of the later and reduced activation of SOS1 by a cytoplasmic SOS2 protein kinase (CITATION). The data suggest that SCABP8 regulates SOS2 activity. The cDNA sequence of SCABP8 corresponds to The Arabidopsis Information Resource accession At4g33000.2 and protein sequence 1009053152, which has three predicted EF hand domains. To test whether SCABP8 could bind calcium, SOS2 and SCABP8 protein were mixed and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred to a cellulose membrane. The membrane was then used to perform a calcium binding assay. SCABP8 was able to bind calcium, but SOS2 did not (Figure 7E). The interaction of SOS3 with SOS2 does not require calcium, but activation of SOS2 by SOS3 is calcium dependent (CITATION). To quantitate the activation of SOS2, a P3 peptide (CITATION) was fused to GST in the pGEX-6P-1 vector. GST-SOS2, GST-SCABP8, GST-SOS3, and GST-P3 proteins were purified, and kinase activity assays were performed. The results are shown in Figure 7F. All reactions contained 250 μM calcium. The SOS2 kinase activity was significantly higher in the absence of EGTA than with supplemental 500 μM EGTA, demonstrating that calcium enhances SOS2 activity in the presence of SOS3 or SCABP8. Neither SCABP8 nor SOS3 showed kinase activity. SCABP8 was observed to differ from SOS3 only in its expression pattern. If SCABP8 and SOS3 have identical functions but are expressed in different tissues due to their tissue-specific promoters, ectopic overexpression of either gene in the sos3 or scabp8 mutant background should rescue their salt-sensitive phenotype. To test this hypothesis, SCABP8 and SOS3 cDNA were expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in both sos3 and scabp8 mutants. Overexpression of the transgenes was confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown), and the resulting transgenic plants were tested for salt sensitivity. Consistent with previous studies (data not shown; CITATION), overexpression of SOS3 in the sos3 mutant complemented its salt-sensitive phenotype. However, overexpression of SOS3 in the scabp8 mutant did not suppress the salt sensitivity of this mutant, including the growth of shoot, primary root, and branch root (Figures 9A to 9E ), suggesting that SCABP8 performs an activity required for salt tolerance in shoots that cannot be fulfilled by SOS3. As expected, overexpression of SCABP8 in the scabp8 mutant complemented its salt-sensitive phenotype (data not shown). However, overexpression of SCABP8 in the sos3 mutant only suppressed salt sensitivity in the shoots and partially in the lateral root but not in the primary root (Figures 9F to 9J). These results suggest that SOS3 and SCABP8 have partially overlapping and unique biochemical functions in the salt-tolerant response of Arabidopsis. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The homozygous scabp8 mutant was identified from a SALK line (CITATION) harboring a T-DNA insertion in the seventh intron of At4g33000 (seed stock no. SALK_056042) using the gene-specific primers 5′-CAGGAGAAGACCGATTGTAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCAGTCTTCAACCTCAGTG-3′ and the T-DNA left border primers Lba1 5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′ and LBb1 5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′. Both of the sos2 and sos3 mutants were in the gl1/gl1 Col-0 background. The mutation gl1 did not affect the salt tolerance phenotype. The sos2 scabp8 and sos3 scabp8 double mutants were obtained by crossing scabp8 to sos2-2 and sos3, respectively. From F2 plants, scabp8 homozygotes were identified as described above. SOS3 gene-specific primers 5′-TCTCATGAATTTGCAGTTGC-3′ and 5′-AAACTGTTTAATCTGGAGGG-3 (CITATION) were used to amplify a 112-bp DNA fragment from sos3 and a 121-bp fragment from the wild type. For sos2-2, primers 5′-CTATACGAGCAAGGGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-AATGAAGGCGAAGCACAAAC-3′ were used for PCR amplification. The products were 86 bp from sos2-2 and 88 bp from the wild type. All of the PCR products were separated on a 4% agarose gel. Seeds of the mutants and wild-type Col-0 were sterilized in the solution containing 20% sodium hypochlorite and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed five times with sterilized water, and sown on MS medium with 0.6% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich). The plates were placed at 4°C for 2 d, and then the seeds were germinated vertically at 23°C under continual illumination. Four-day-old seedlings with a root length ∼1.5 cm were transferred onto MS medium with salt added as described. For scabp8 mutant complementation, a 3783-bp genomic DNA fragment containing 1736 bp upstream of the translation start site and 469 bp downstream of the stop codon of SCABP8 was obtained by the digestion of BAC plasmid F26P21 (ABRC) with XbaI and PstI. The DNA fragment corresponded to the sequence from 54,144 to 57,927 bp of the BAC clone. This fragment was then cloned into the XbaI and PstI sites of pCAMBIA1200 vector. The resultant plasmid 1200-SCABP8CP was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 by electroporation and transformed to scabp8 mutants by the flower dip method. Genomic DNA was extracted from 6-week-old scabp8 plants using the Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega). For DNA gel blot analysis, 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI and fractionated on agarose gel (0.8% [w/v]). The separated DNA was transferred to Hybond N+ nucleic acid transfer membranes (Amersham). The 795-bp neomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence (NPTII CDS) probe was gel purified and radiolabeled with 32P by a random primer labeling kit (Takara). DNA gel blot hybridization was performed at 42°C for 16 h using hybridization solution (200 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 50% formamide, 10% BSA, and 7% SDS) with 32P-labeled NPTII CDS probes, followed by washing at 65°C in 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS, 1× SSC and 0.5% SDS, and 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 15 min sequentially. The 32P-labeled membranes were exposed to a phosphor screen (Amersham). After 12 h of exposure, signals were captured with a Typhoon 9410 phosphor imager (Amersham). The plasmid 1200-SCABP8CP was digested with EcoRI and AccIII. The resulting fragment from 35 to 1736 bp upstream of the translation start site of SCABP8 was cloned into the EcoRI and XmaI sites of the pCAMBIA1381Z vector. SOS2 promoter DNA fragment was amplified with primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTCATTAGGGTTCATGGGTTGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCTTTACAAACTTTTATCTG-3′ and cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBI101 vector. SOS3 promoter fragment was amplified with primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAATCATGTTGGGTCTGATTGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCACAAACACACCCTTCTCTCAAC-3′ and cloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of pBI101 vector. The plasmids were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana by A. tumefaciens–mediated transformation. GUS assays using transgenic T2 lines at different developmental stages were performed as described by CITATION. Total RNA from 10-d-old seedlings and from different organs of plants at the six-week growth stage was extracted by the TRIzol method. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of total RNA and MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The cDNA was then used for PCR amplification with the following primers. For SCABP8, the primers SC8F0 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAACAAGTTTCCTCTAG-3′ and SC8R0 5′-GCGTCGACTCAGTCTTCAACCTCAGTG-3′ were used. For SOS2, the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGACAAAGAAAATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTTCCACATGTGGTACGCAGAAGTTC-3′ were used. For SOS3, the primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGGGCTGCTCTGTATCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGGAAGATACGTTTTGC-3′ were used. For UBQ10, the primers 5′-ACCGGAAAGACTATCACTTTG-3′ and 5′- AGAGATAACAGGAACGGAAAC-3′ were used. To identify the level of SCABP8 transcription in the SCABP8 mutant and the complementary transgenic plants by RT-PCR, the primers used were SC8F1 5′-GCGCCGTCTTTATACCTTTC-3′, SC8R1 5′-ATCGGTCTTCTCCTGGATTG-3′, SC8F2 5′-GGATGAATGGAATGTCTATG-3′, and SC8R2 5′-AACAAAGCAAAGTGCTTGAC-3′. Real-time PCR was performed with the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system using SYBR to monitor double-stranded DNA products. For SCABP8, the primers were 5′-AACAAATGGTTTCTGCTATTCTC-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCATCAGCAAATGTTTTATC-3′. For SOS2, the primers were 5′-CGAAACTTCAAGACAAGGCTC-3′ and 5′-GTGCCACCTCGTAAATCTCTATC-3′. For SOS3, the primers were 5′-GTAATGGTGGATAAGGCTTTCG-3′ and 5′-TGAGCGATGGATTCAAGGATAC-3′. For ACT2, used as an internal control, the primers were 5′-GTCGTACAACCGGTATTGTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTGGTCTTTGAGGTTTC-3′. For UBQ10, another internal control, the primers were 5′-CCCTGATGAATAAGTGTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-ACGAAGCGATGATAAAGAAG-3′. The relative gene expression after NaCl treatment was calculated by comparison with that of the seedlings without NaCl treatment that was defined as 1. SDS software version 1.2 (Applied Biosystems) was used for analysis. Standard deviations were calculated from three independent biological replicates. Leaf chlorophyll was extracted with 80% acetone, the absorbance at 647 and 664 nm was determined by a DU 800 UV/visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter), and total chlorophyll was calculated (CITATION). Anthocyanin was extracted in acid (1% HCl [w/v]) methanol, the absorbance at 530 and 657 nm was determined, and the concentration of anthocynanin was calculated by A530-0.25A657 (CITATION). The coding region of SCABP8 cDNA was amplified from Col-0 using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAACAAGTTTCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTCAGTCTTCAACCTCAGTG-3′, containing BamHI and SalI sites, respectively. Two PCR bands were separated after electrophoresis. Both PCR products were purified and digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector. Sequence analysis revealed that the sequence of the smaller fragment was identical to CBL10 (CITATION; GenBank accession no. AF513507.2). The larger fragment was the same as AF513507 except that the seventh intron of SCABP8 was not spliced out. SOS3 was amplified using primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGGGCTGCTCTGTATCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGGAAGATACGTTTTGC-3′ and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-6P-1 vector. SOS2 was amplified using primers 5′-CGGGATCCA TGACAAAGAAAATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTTCCACATGTGGTACGCAGAAGTTC-3′. To produce GST-SOS2ΔF, two SOS2 cDNA fragments were amplified by the following primer pairs: 5′-CGGGATCCATGACAAAGAAAATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CAAAATCCTGTCGCAGGGGCCCTTCATCATTTCTC-3′; 5′-GAAGGGCCCCTGCGACAGGATTTTGTTAAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAAAACGTGATTGTTCTGAG-3′. The resulting PCR products were used in the second round of PCR with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGACAAAGAAAATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAAAACGTGATTGTTCTGAG-3′ to produce the mutant SOS2 cDNA containing a deletion of 66 bp from 924 to 990 bp (SOS2ΔF). The SOS2ΔF was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector at the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The GST fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the pull-down assay, 5 μg of SCABP8 or SOS3 was incubated with 1 μg each of GST-SOS2 or GST-SOS2ΔF on glutathione sepharose beads for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μL of binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT). After four washes with binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in 100 μL of loading buffer, 20 μL were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Commassie Brilliant Blue R 250, and 1 μL was analyzed by protein gel blotting against anti-SCABP8. Kinase reaction and calcium binding assays were described by CITATION. SCABP8 was amplified with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAACAAGTTTCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACGTCTTCAACCTCAGTGTTG-3′ and cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of a pUC-SPYCE vector (CITATION). SOS2 and SOS2ΔFISL were amplified with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGACAAAGAAAATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACAAACGTGATTGTTCTGAGAATC-3′ using GST-SOS2 and GST-SOS2ΔFISL plasmids as templates, respectively, and then cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of a pUC-SPYNE vector. SOS3 was obtained by PCR using primers 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGGCTGCTCTGTATCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGAAGATACGTTTTGCAATTC-3′ and cloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of pUC-SPYCE vector. These plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient centri-fugation and transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts (CITATION). The YFP fluorescence of protoplasts was assayed 10 to 12 h after transformation under a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. YFP-SCABP8 was constructed by excising the coding region of SCABP8 cDNA with BamHI and SalI from GST-SCABP8 and cloning it into the binary vector pCAMBIA1205-YFP downstream of YFP. SOS2 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI from GST-SOS2 and cloned into the pCAMBIA1205-YFP vector. The resulting constructs were introduced into A. tumefaciens GV3101 and transformed into Arabidopsis. The coding sequences of SOS2, SOS2ΔF, and SCABP8 were translationally fused downstream of the c-myc tag. The plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. After overnight incubation, the protoplasts were harvested at room temperature for 2 min at 100g, resuspended in 200 μL of cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.1, 13.5% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and sonicated on ice in short bursts. The total crude homogenate was further centrifuged for 20 min at 1000g at 4°C, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 140,000g at 4°C to generate a total membrane pellet and a soluble protein fraction. The resulting samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with primary antibody anti-cMyc (Sigma-Aldrich; M4439). Plasma membrane–enriched vesicles were purified by the two-phase method, and the purity of each fraction was determined as described by CITATION. Seedlings overexpressing 35SP:myc-SCABP8 and protoplasts transfected with 35SP:myc-SOS2 were used for two-phase partitioning. Plasma membrane vesicles from seedlings overexpressing 35S:myc-SCABP8 were treated with 0.01% Brij58, 1% Triton X-100, 3% SDS, 1 M KI, 1 M KCl, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5 (CITATION). After centrifugation at 150,000g at 4°C for 60 min, aliquots of supernatants and pellets were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, and myc-SCABP8 and myc-SOS2 were detected with anti-myc antibody. The intracellular localization of SCABP8 was also determined by monitoring the transient expression of a SCABP8-GFP translational fusion in onion epidermal cells after DNA particle bombardment, essentially as described by CITATION. The coding regions of SCABP8 and SCABP8ΔN in which the N-terminal hydrophobic domain had been removed were amplified with primers 5′-ACGTACCATGGAACAAGTTTCCTCTAGAT-3′ and 5′-ATAGCCCATGGCGTCTTCAACCTCAGTGTTGAA-3′ that included NcoI restriction sites for subcloning into plasmid pGFP-JS in frame with GFP (CITATION). The SCABP8 open reading frame was digested from its GST fusion vector with BamHI and SalI. To produce the truncated mis-spliced SCABP8 variant, the fragment was obtained by PCR with primers 5′-CGGGATCCTGGAACAAGTTTCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACACTAGTTCAAGAACTCACTTTATCAATAATC-3′ harboring BamHI or SalI sites. Both of the fragments were inserted into the pCAMBIA1205 vector under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, respectively. GST-SOS3 plasmid DNA was digested with XhoI and then partially digested with BamHI and cloned into the pCAMBIA1205 vector. These plasmids were introduced into A. tumefaciens GV3101 and transformed into Arabidopsis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains AXT3K (ena1∷HIS3∷ena4, nha1∷LEU2, and nhx1∷KanMX4) and JP890 (ena1∷HIS3∷ena4, nha1∷LEU2, nhx1∷KanMX, and CYC1∷[PGK1:SOS1:CYC1]) have been described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Sodium tolerance tests were performed in the alkali cation-free medium AP (8 mM phosphoric acid, 10 mM l-Arg, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 2% glucose, plus vitamins and trace elements, brought to pH 6.5 with Arg). Aliquots (5 μL) were spotted onto AP plates supplemented with 1 mM KCl, with or without 100 mM NaCl, and grown for 3 to 4 d at 28°C. Plasmids for the expression of SOS2 and SOS3 in yeast have been described elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION). Plasmid pSCABP8 was created by subcloning a 0.7-kb BamHI-SalI fragment spanning the entire open reading frame of SCABP8 into the BamHI-SalI sites of pYPGE15. An internal deletion spanning from residues Val-13 to Val-35, both included, was constructed in SCABP8 to remove an N-terminal hydrophobic domain. First, the region upstream of the deleted fragment was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CCTGGTATCTTTATAGTCCTG-3′, annealing to the vector plasmid, and 5′- ATCGAAGCATTGTCCAGTGAGAGAGCTTGATCTAG-3′. The downstream fragment was also amplified with primers 5′-TCAAGCTCTCTCACTGGACAATGCTTCGATTGCCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAGGTCGACTCAGTCTTC-3′, both annealing to SCABP8. Both PCR products were combined and reamplified with the first and fourth primers to render a read-through fragment bearing the Val-13–Val-35 deletion in SCABP8. The resulting coding region, SCABP8ΔN, was cloned in pYPGE15 as described above to produce plasmid pSCABP8ΔN. To perform the SRS analysis, the S. cerevisiae strain cdc25-2 (MATalfa, cdc25-2, ade2, his3, leu2, lys2, trp1, ura3) was transformed with plasmids pSRS2-1 (hSos:SOS2), pSCABP8, pSCABP8ΔN, and pSOS3-2 (CITATION; CITATION). As controls, the empty vector pADNS and pADNS-5′SosF encoding a full-length human Sos protein were used (CITATION). Mutation cdc25-2 creates a conditional lethal phenotype at 37°C unless the reporter human protein hSos reaches the plasma membrane. Cell viability at 37°C was determined in YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose).
