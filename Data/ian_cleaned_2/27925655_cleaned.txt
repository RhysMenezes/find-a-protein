!~ABS~! Amino acids stored in the vacuoles are exported to the cytosol mainly for protein synthesis; however, the molecular identity of vacuolar amino acid exporters remains obscure in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the heterologous expression of AtAVT3 genes, Arabidopsis homologs of AVT3 and AVT4 encoding vacuolar amino acid exporters in yeast, reduces vacuolar amino acid levels in the avt3∆avt4∆ yeast cells. In vitro experiments revealed that 14C-labeled Ala and Pro are exported from vacuolar membrane vesicles by AtAvt3A in an ATP-dependent manner. In Arabidopsis, AtAvt3A fused with green fluorescent protein localizes to the vacuolar membrane. We propose that AtAVT3 family represents the long sought-for vacuolar amino acid exporters in plants.
!~RES~! A homology search of the Arabidopsis genome using the yeast vacuolar amino acid transporter AVT genes revealed 19 homologs [27-29], which were designated as AtAVTs (Fig. 1). They are categorized into three phylogenetically distinct subfamilies related to AVT1, AVT3/AVT4, and AVT6. Arabidopsis AtAvt proteins have been identified in various organelles by proteomic approaches (Table S3). Therefore, we employed heterologous expression system in yeasts to screen functional vacuolar amino acid transporters. [[FIGURE]] First, to confirm successful expression and the proper vacuolar localization of AtAvt proteins in yeast cells, GFP-fused AtAvt proteins were expressed under the constitutive ADH promoter in yeast avt3∆avt4∆ mutants. The AtAVT3 subfamily comprises four members: AtAVT3A (At5g65990), AtAVT3B (At2g42005), AtAVT3C (At4g38250), and ANT1 (At3g11900). We found that all the GFP-fused AtAvt3-related proteins except Ant1 were targeted to the vacuolar membranes, which were labeled with the FM4-64 dye (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Ant1 appeared to be associated with ER in the perinuclear region. GFP-tagged AtAvt6E (At1g80510) predominantly accumulated at the ER, but it partially localized to the vacuolar membrane (data not shown). We failed to observe fluorescent signals in yeast cells expressing AtAvt1-related genes (At2g41190 and At5g02170) fused with GFP. Hence, the heterologous experimental system was applied to the further functional analyses of the AtAVT3 subfamily. [[FIGURE]] We measured vacuolar amino acid levels in avt3∆avt4∆ yeast cells expressing GFP-fused AtAVT3 genes to examine whether these genes restore vacuolar amino acid export in the avt3∆avt4∆ mutants (Fig. 3). The vacuolar contents of various neutral amino acids such as Thr, Ser, Asn, Gln, Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, and Pro, which are the substrates of Avt3 and Avt4 [CITATION], were significantly increased in the yeast cells. In addition, aromatic amino acids levels, including Tyr and Phe, appeared to be slightly higher in the avt3∆avt4∆ yeast cells than in the wild-type yeast cells, although the differences were relatively minor compared to other neutral amino acids (Fig. 3). As expected, the expression of AVT3 in the avt3∆avt4∆ yeast cells reduced the neutral amino acid levels approximately to their levels in the wild-type cells. We also found that the vacuolar amounts of these amino acids were reduced by the overproduction of AtAvt3A and AtAvt3C, but not by Ant1, to the same extent as those of cells expressing Avt3 (Fig. 3A,B). In contrast, AtAvt3B seemed to partially restore the export of neutral amino acids, as the vacuolar levels of Thr, Ser, Asn, Gln, Val, Met, and Ile in the avt3∆avt4∆ cells expressing AtAvt3B were significantly lower than those in avt3∆avt4∆ cells but were higher than those in wild-type cells. Similar results were obtained when AtAVT3-related genes without GFP were expressed in yeast cells (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] Under this condition, the wild-type and avt3∆avt4∆ cells exhibited similar vacuolar acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic amino acid (Lys and Arg) levels, none of which were markedly affected by the expression of yeast AVT3 or Arabidopsis AVT3-related genes (Fig. 3C,D). Although there may be minor differences in His levels between the wild-type and avt3∆avt4∆ cells (Fig. 3C), these results suggested that neutral amino acids are the preferential substrates for AtAvt3A and AtAvt3C, and to a lesser extent, for AtAvt3B. To provide direct evidence of the function of AtAvt3A as a vacuolar amino acid exporter, we examined amino acid export activity mediated by GFP-AtAvt3A using vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from yeast cells. 14C-labeled Ala was preloaded into isolated vesicles for 5 min and then ATP was applied at a final concentration of 2 mm. Vesicles were collected at the indicated times, and the radioactivity of 14C-Ala retained in the vesicles was measured. Upon ATP addition, the radioactivity of 14C-Ala rapidly decreased in membrane vesicles obtained from wild-type vacuoles, suggesting active export of preloaded 14C-Ala (Fig. 4). This loss of 14C-Ala was not observed in the absence of ATP. The avt3∆avt4∆ vacuolar membrane vesicles failed to export preloaded 14C-Ala but further accumulated 14C-Ala likely via Avt1 [CITATION], whereas GFP-AtAvt3A restored the export of Ala in an ATP-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained using 14C-Ser and 14C-Pro as transport substrates (Fig. 5C and data not shown). In contrast, 14C-Glu, which is not a transport substrate of Avt3 and Avt4 [CITATION], was released from the avt3∆avt4∆ vesicles independent of AtAvt3A (Fig. 5C). The results are in good agreement with the vacuolar amino acid contents described in Fig. 3, which supported the proposed function of AtAvt3A in the export of various neutral amino acids. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] A Glu residue in the putative sixth transmembrane domain is conserved among AVT3-related proteins (Fig. 5A) and suggested to be critical for transport activity [9, 30]. The corresponding residue in AtAvt3A was replaced with Ala, and the mutated AtAvt3A fused to GFP (GFP-AtAvt3AE241A) was expressed in the avt3∆avt4∆ yeast cells. This mutation did not affect the expression and vacuolar membrane localization of GFP-fused AtAvt3AE241A (Fig. 2B). The vacuolar contents of various neutral amino acids (Thr, Ser, Asn, Gln, Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, and Pro), which were higher in the avt3∆avt4∆ cells than in the wild-type cells, were reduced by AtAvt3A, as shown in Figs 3 and 5B. In contrast, the expression of AtAvt3AE241A failed to reduce the amount of these amino acids in the vacuoles of the avt3∆avt4∆ cells (Fig. 5B). To further examine the transport activity of AtAvt3AE241A, we prepared vacuolar membrane vesicles from the avt3∆avt4∆ cells that were transformed with either AtAvt3A or AtAvt3AE241A. Vesicles were preloaded with 14C-labeled amino acids, and the radioactivities retained in the vesicles were measured in the presence or absence of ATP, as described in Fig. 4. In contrast to the vesicles with AtAvt3A, in which the level of 14C-Ala rapidly decreased upon the addition of ATP, 14C-Ala was accumulated in vesicles with AtAvt3AE241A in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5C), in a similar manner to that observed for the fission yeast Avt3E469A [CITATION]. 14C-Pro preloaded in the vacuolar membrane vesicles of the avt3∆avt4∆ cells immediately decreased in an ATP-dependent manner by the expression of AtAvt3A but not AtAvt3AE241A (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the export of preloaded 14C-Glu from the vacuolar membrane vesicles of the avt3∆avt4∆ cells incubated with ATP was not affected by the expression of AtAvt3 or AtAvt3AE241A. These results suggested that AtAvt3A functions in the active export of Ala and Pro but not Glu and that a conserved Glu241 of AtAvt3A is important for its transport activity. Finally, we determined subcellular localization of AtAvt3 proteins in plant cells. RT-PCR analyses illustrated that AtAVT3 genes were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues of whole plants (Fig. 6A). To examine whether their transcript levels are affected by altered nitrogen availability, 7-day-old seedlings grown in liquid culture media were transferred to low nitrate (0.1 mm KNO3) media for 2 days and then nitrate was added to low nitrate media (3 mm KNO3) for 3 h according to the method by Scheible et al. [CITATION]. As expected, nitrogen-regulated genes, MYB90 (At1g66390; PAP2) and LBD39 (At4g37540) [CITATION], were induced or suppressed under nitrogen limitation, respectively (Fig. 6B). In contrast, expression of AtAVT3 genes was not affected by nitrogen limitation or readdition of nitrate. [[FIGURE]] In this study, GFP-fused AtAVT3 genes were expressed under the control of CaMV 35S promoter. As shown in Fig. 6C, GFP-AtAvt3A was exclusively localized to the vacuolar membranes in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis cell suspensions. In contrast, GFP-Ant1 proteins were distributed within the cytosol and partially retained in the ER (data not shown). To further support the vacuolar localization of AtAvt3 proteins in whole plants, we prepared transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing AtAvt3A, which was N-terminally fused to GFP. In every transgenic line examined, GFP-fused AtAvt3 proteins were targeted to the vacuolar membranes (Fig. 6D).
!~MM~! The ORF regions of AtAVT3A, AtAVT3B, AtAVT3C, and ANT1 were amplified from cDNA of Arabidopsis. A restriction enzyme site was attached to each primer (see Table S1). PCR fragments were digested by the restriction enzymes indicated in the primer list and subcloned into the low copy plasmid p416ADH [CITATION] or p416ADH-GFP(N) [CITATION], which was designated as p416-GFP-AtAvt3x. The plasmid for expressing GFP-fused S. cerevisiae AVT3 under the ADH promoter was constructed as previously described [CITATION]. A single point mutation was introduced into AtAVT3 via a QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Hachioji, Japan) to prepare p416-GFP-AtAvt3AE241A using following primers for AtAVT3A E241A: F, 5′-gcggtgtacgcatttGCAgggatcggaatggttc-3′ and R, 5′-gaaccattccgatcccTGCaaatgcgtacaccgc-3′. The ORF of AtAVT3A was fused to the C terminus of the enhanced green fluorescent protein in the p2FGW7 plasmid and binary vector pH7WGF2 [CITATION] using Gateway technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). URA3 gene in the S. cerevisiae strain X2180-1B (MATa SUC2 mal mel gal2 CUP1) was disrupted to isolate the STY3807 strain [CITATION]. The avt3∆avt4∆ mutant (STY3828) was derived from STY3807 [CITATION]. Yeast cells (wild-type and avt3∆avt4∆) carrying the plasmid were grown at 30 °C to the early-log stage (OD660 of 1.0) in synthetic medium [0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) casamino acid, and 0.002% (w/v) Trp]. Their vacuolar amino acid contents were examined according to the method by Ohsumi et al. [CITATION] with minor modification. Briefly, collected cells were suspended in 2.5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm glucose, and 200 μm CuCl2, and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Then, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 g, suspended in distilled water, and boiled for 15 min. The supernatant collected after centrifugation at 2100 g was dried-up and suspended in 0.02 m HCl to be analyzed by an amino acid analyzer (Hitachi L8800, Tokyo, Japan). Yeast vacuolar membranes were stained with 16 μm FM4-64 as previously described [CITATION] and observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Transient expression of fluorescence proteins in Arabidopsis suspension cells and preparing transgenic Arabidopsis plants by the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip method were performed as described previously [CITATION]. Root cells of several independent transgenic lines were observed via epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX71). Exponentially growing yeast cells were harvested and converted to spheroplasts in 1 m sorbitol with Zymolyase 20T (10 μg·mL−1; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Intact vacuoles were isolated from spheroplasts using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and converted to vacuole membrane vesicles in 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm KCl as described in [CITATION]. Amino acid transport assays using vacuolar membrane vesicles were performed as previously described [CITATION]. In brief, 14C-labeled amino acids (final 0.1 mm, 4.8–11.1 GBq·mmol−1) were preloaded into vacuolar membrane vesicles (200 μg of protein) for 5 min. Subsequently, vesicles were collected before (0 min) and at indicated points (30 s, 2 min, 4 min, and 8 min) after the addition of ATP at a final concentration of 2 mm. As a control, preloaded vesicles were incubated in the absence of ATP. Vesicles were collected on filters, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-5100; Hitachi-Aloka Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Wild-type plants of Arabidopsis thaliana (strain Columbia) were grown at 22 °C under a 16 h/8 h light/dark photoperiod. T-DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Screening of homozygous plants was confirmed by genomic PCR and RT-PCR using the primers listed in Table S1. Full nutrient (FN) media contain 2 mm KNO3 and 1 mm NH4NO3, and low nitrogen (LN) media contain 0.1 mm KNO3 and 2 mm KCl. Both media contain 3 mm KH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH5.8, 4 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 3 mm MES, pH5.8, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and micronutrients (67 μm Na2EDTA, 8.6 μm FeSO4, 10.3 μm MnSO4, 30 μm H3BO3, 1.0 μm ZnSO4, 1.0 μm CuSO4, 0.024 μm (NH4)6Mo7O24, and 0.13 μm CoCl2). Deprivation and addition of nitrate were performed using a liquid culture system as described previously [CITATION]. In brief, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in sterile FN media for 7 days, and the media were changed to fresh FN or LN media. FN media were again exchanged on day 8 in FN cultures to prevent nitrogen exhaustion. On day 9, FN and LN cultures were harvested. For readdition of nitrate, 3 mm (final concentration) KNO3 or 3 mm KCl (as a control) was added to the LN cultures. Seedlings were further cultured for 3 h and harvested. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described [CITATION]. The primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Tables S1 and S2.
