!~ABS~! Arabinogalactan proteins are abundant proteoglycans present on cell surfaces of plants and involved in many cellular processes, including somatic embryogenesis, cell-cell communication and cell elongation. Arabinogalactan proteins consist mainly of glycan, which is synthesized by post-translational modification of proteins in the secretory pathway. Importance of the variations in the glycan moiety of arabinogalactan proteins for their functions has been implicated, but its biosynthetic process is poorly understood. We have identified a novel enzyme in the biosynthesis of the glycan moiety of arabinogalactan proteins. The At1g08280 (AtGALT29A) from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a putative glycosyltransferase (GT), which belongs to the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme family GT29. AtGALT29A co-expresses with other arabinogalactan GTs, AtGALT31A and AtGLCAT14A. The recombinant AtGALT29A expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated a galactosyltransferase activity, transferring galactose from UDP-galactose to a mixture of various oligosaccharides derived from arabinogalactan proteins. The galactose-incorporated products were analyzed using structure-specific hydrolases indicating that the recombinant AtGALT29A possesses β-1,6-galactosyltransferase activity, elongating β-1,6-galactan side chains and forming 6-Gal branches on the β-1,3-galactan main chain of arabinogalactan proteins. The fluorescence tagged AtGALT29A expressed in N. benthamiana was localized to Golgi stacks where it interacted with AtGALT31A as indicated by Förster resonance energy transfer. Biochemically, the enzyme complex containing AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A could be co-immunoprecipitated and the isolated protein complex exhibited increased level of β-1,6-galactosyltransferase activities compared to AtGALT29A alone. AtGALT29A is a β-1,6-galactosyltransferase and can interact with AtGALT31A. The complex can work cooperatively to enhance the activities of adding galactose residues 6-linked to β-1,6-galactan and to β-1,3-galactan. The results provide new knowledge of the glycosylation process of arabinogalactan proteins and the functional significance of protein-protein interactions among O-glycosylation enzymes.
!~RES~! The protein encoded by At1g08280 is predicted to have a single transmembrane domain at Val5-Ile27, a typical type II membrane topology commonly found in GTs. The transcript levels are generally low in Arabidopsis throughout development, but higher during seed maturation and root development, and the gene is co-expressed with AtGALT31A[CITATION] and AtGLCAT14A[CITATION], which were recently identified as possessing galactosyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase activity, respectively, involved in the glycosylation of type II AGs (GeneCAT, http://genecat.mpg.de) [CITATION] (Additional file CITATION: Figure S1). Therefore, we presumed that the activity encoded by At1g08280 may be involved in the glycosylation pathway of type II AGs, and investigated this hypothesis by biochemical assays using the protein expressed heterologously. For biochemical characterization, the full-length At1g08280 construct harboring N-terminal HA tag was expressed in N. benthamiana and affinity purified using monoclonal anti-HA-antibody conjugated to agarose. The HA-At1g08280 collected on the bead slurry was used as the enzyme source for identification of donor substrate. We identified the donor substrate by testing 7 different NDP-[14C]-sugars according to the methods [CITATION,CITATION]. We used microsomes prepared from N. benthamiana after expression of a synthetic peptide composed of a consensus sequence for AG glycosylation as acceptor for the assay (GAGP8-GFP; [CITATION]). This acceptor represents a mixture of various type II AG polysaccharides (for details of the structure, see [CITATION]). When substrate mixtures were tested, we observed higher level of [14C]-sugar incorporation from a mixture of UDP-[14C]-GlcNAc, UDP-[14C]-GlcA and UDP-[14C]-Gal (Mix II in Figure CITATIONA) than from one containing UDP-[14C]-Xyl, UDP-[14C]-Glc, GDP-[14C]-Man and GDP-[14C]-Fuc (Mix I). When testing each substrate in the Mix II separately, we found UDP-[14C]-Gal works as a substrate (Figure CITATIONB). The result indicates that the enzyme possesses a GalT activity, therefore, we named the enzyme AtGALT29A (Arabidopsis thaliana galactosyltransferase from family GT29). Identification of donor substrate for recombinant AtGALT29A. Affinity purified AtGALT29A (■) or P19 (□) was incubated with A: NDP-[14C]-sugars: UDP-[14C]-Xyl, UDP-[14C]-Glc, GDP-[14C]-Man and GDP-[14C]-Fuc (as MixI), and UDP-[14C]-GlcNAc, UDP-[14C]-GlcA and UDP-[14C]-Gal (as MixII); B: or individual NDP-[14C]-sugars from MixII using GAGP8 as acceptor substrate. Error bars showed standard deviations from n = 4. The result indicates that UDP-[14C]-Gal serves substrate for AtGALT29A. We determined the subcellular localization of AtGALT29A by transient expression of the C-terminal monomeric CFP (mCer3) fusion protein in N. benthamiana (Figure CITATION). The overlay of AtGALT29A-mCer3 with the co-expressed Golgi marker protein, STtmd-YFP [CITATION] indicated its localization to the Golgi apparatus. Subcellular localization of AtGALT29A-mCer3 in N. benthamiana leaves. A-B: Confocal images of AtGALT29A-mCer3, STtmd-YFP (a Golgi marker) co-expressed transiently in N. benthamiana leaves. C: The overlay image of (A) and (B). The result indicates co-localization of ATGALT29A-mCer3 and STtmd-YFP in the Golgi apparatus. Scale bar = 5 μm. Previously, AtGALT31A and AtGLCAT14A were also shown to be localized to the Golgi apparatus [CITATION,CITATION]. AtGALT29A-YFP was co-localized with AtGALT31A-mCer3 to a high degree (approximately 80%, Figure CITATIONA-C), while AtGALT29A-mCer3 and AtGLCAT14A-YFP were only partially co-localized (approximately 52%, Additional file CITATION: Figure S2A-C). Next, we tested protein-protein interaction within and between AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A using the FRET acceptor photobleaching technique for these proteins tagged with either mCer3 or YFP ectopically expressed in N. benthamiana[CITATION,CITATION]. FRET from mCer3 (donor) to YFP (acceptor) happens when the two fluorescent proteins are closer than 10 nm, indicative of interaction between the tagged proteins. Bleaching of the acceptor YFP allows measuring absolute FRET efficiency in a self-controlled manner [CITATION,CITATION], so values above 0 definitely indicate molecular interaction between the tagged proteins. When the homodimeric combinations (AtGALT31A-mCer3 + AtGALT31A-YFP and AtGALT29A-mCer3 + AtGALT29A-YFP, respectively) were tested, FRET efficiencies of 19% and 34% were assessed, respectively (Figure CITATIOND, CITATIONF), indicating the formation of homodimers for both AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A. When AtGALT31A-mCer3 + AtGALT29A-YFP and AtGALT29A-mCer3 + AtGALT31A-YFP were co-expressed, FRET efficiencies of 18% and 29% were detected, respectively, indicating the formation of heterodimers between AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A (Figure CITATIONE, CITATIONG). Therefore we observed positive interactions for all combinations tested (Figure CITATION), but differences in the values of FRET efficiencies are evident, when these are calculated on a pixel-by-pixel analysis. When AtGALT29A is the donor (mCer3 tagged, Figure CITATIONF and CITATIONG), FRET efficiencies are overall higher (34% and 29%) compared to the combinations when AtGALT31A is the donor (19% and 18%, Figure CITATIOND and CITATIONE). Thus, AtGALT31A-mCer3 is either less able to dimerize than AtGALT29A-mCer3 under the experimental conditions, or is in a conformation which is less efficient as a donor. Nevertheless, when we use the same donor (either AtGALT29A-mCer3 or AtGALT31A-mCer3), and compare FRET efficiencies for homo and heterodimerization, we obtain roughly the same FRET efficiency for homo and heterodimers. For AtGALT29A-mCer3/AtGALT29A-YFP and AtGALT29A-mCer3/AtGALT31A-YFP we obtain 34% and 29%, (Figure CITATIONF and CITATIONG, respectively), indicating that the AtGALT29A-mCer3/AtGALT31A-YFP heterodimer is preferred to the AtGALT29A homodimer, since in spite of the possibility of homodimer formation in the AtGALT29A-mCer3/AtGALT31A-YFP system, which could decrease FRET by incorrect donor/acceptor pairing, we still have the same level of FRET efficiency as when we have only AtGALT29A. The same tendency is also observed when AtGALT31A-mCer is the donor (19% and 18%, Figure CITATIOND and CITATIONE, respectively). Localization and FRET analysis for AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A. A-B: Confocal images of AtGALT31A-mCer3 and AtGALT29A-YFP co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. C: The overlay image of (A) and (B). AtGALT31A-mCer3 and AtGALT29A-YFP are co-localized in high frequency. D-G: Distribution histogram for pixel by pixel analysis of FRET [CITATION]. FRET efficiency is expressed as FRET=, for example, FRET = 0.19 in (D) means that FRET efficiency is 19%; SEM, standard error of means; cell = number of cells analyzed. Scale bar = 5 μm. Overall, our results indicate the formation of homodimers for both AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A as well as that of heterodimers between them when these two GTs were expressed simultaneously. The indicated interactions are unlikely to be due to an overexpression artifact since AtGALT31A and AtGLCAT14A did not interact under the same experimental set up [CITATION]. AtGALT29A also interacted with AtGLCAT14A when the two proteins were co-localized (13% mean FRET efficiency, Additional file CITATION: Figure S2D). But, since AtGALT29A and AtGLCAT14A were only occasionally co-localized, occurrence of the interaction between these two proteins is considered to be of less importance than that between AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A. Since FRET analysis indicated molecular interactions between AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A (Figure CITATION), we tried to purify the enzyme complex and investigated GalT activity when AtGALT29A is alone or in a complex with AtGALT31A. We expressed AtGALT31A as a C-terminal GFP fusion protein (AtGALT31A-GFP) and AtGALT29A as an N-terminally HA tagged protein (HA-AtGALT29A) in N. benthamiana, and immunoprecipitated the enzyme complex using an anti-GFP antibody (Figure CITATIONA). When AtGALT31A-GFP was expressed alone, it was immunoprecipitated as a band of ca. 70 kDa using Western blot analysis with the same antibody (Figure CITATIONA, lane 2). The corresponding band was also detected in the immunoprecipitated material using anti-HA resin from the co-expression sample of both proteins (Figure CITATIONA, lane 5). This indicates co-purification of AtGALT31A with AtGALT29A using a tag on AtGALT29A, thus the complex formation indicated by the FRET analysis was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure CITATION). The band around 50 kDa detected in lanes 3-5 is the heavy chain of the HA antibody used for immunoprecipitation, which was somehow detected by the secondary antibody in the Western blot analysis. Galactosyltransferase activity using the purified AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex in vitro. Microsomes were prepared from N. benthamiana leaves after expression of P19 only, AtGALT31A-GFP, HA-AtGALT29A or co-expression of HA-AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A-GFP, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP- or anti-HA-antibody. The conditions are indicated in the table at the bottom of (B). The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by the Western blot (A) and by the enzyme activity (B). A: The Western blot of P19, AtGALT31A-GFP, HA-AtGALT29A and AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A immunoprecipitated using GFP antibody. The result indicates co-purification of AtGALT31A-GFP (lane 5, indicated by the arrow at ca. 70 kDa) by immunoprecipitation of HA-AtGALT29A using anti-HA-antibody-agarose. The 50 kDa band detected in the lanes 3-5 is the heavy chain of HA antibody used for the immunoprecipitation, which is recognized by the secondary antibody used in the Western blot. B: Galactosyltransferase activity towards SP32-GFP and β-1,3-galactan acceptors. Affinity purified materials from the expression of P19 only, AtGALT31A-GFP, HA-AtGALT29A, or co-expression of HA-AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A-GFP using anti-GFP- or anti-HA-antibody were tested for enzyme activity using UDP-14[C]-Gal as substrate and SP32-GFP (lanes 1-5) or β-1,3-galactan (lanes 8-10) as acceptor, (n = 4). Control samples after co-expression of AtGALT31A-GFP or HA-AtGALT29A with HA-AtGLCAT14A (lane 6 and 7) were immunoprecipitated in the same way as for other samples and tested for the enzyme activity using UDP-14[C]-Gal as substrate and SP32-GFP as acceptor (lanes 6-7), (n = 3). These combinations are not suggested to form protein complexes based on the FRET analysis. Error bars showed standard deviations. We attempted to evaluate the purity of the protein complex(es) by eluting the immobilized complex(es) from the anti-HA agarose slurry using low pH buffer as recommended by the manufacturer; however, the majority of the proteins were not eluted to the buffer in an amount detectable by Western blot analysis (data not shown). When the immunoprecipitated samples collected on anti-HA antibody-agarose were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by the Western blot, we could detect the recombinant proteins (Figure CITATION). Using the immunoprecipitated enzyme complex, we investigated GalT activity in the biosynthesis of type II AG using UDP-[14C]-Gal as donor-substrate and SP32-GFP as acceptor, which is microsomes prepared from N. benthamiana after expression of a consensus motifs for AG glycosylation, repetitive Ser-Pro [CITATION]. This material contains various AG oligosaccharides similarly as detected in GAGP8 (see method). The protein complex containing AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A exhibited a higher level of [14C]-Gal incorporation to the SP32-GFP acceptor compared to AtGALT29A alone (Figure CITATIONB). While such an increase was not observed for the combination of AtGALT31A/AtGLCAT14A and AtGALT29A/AtGLCAT14A (lane 6 and 7 in Figure CITATIONB), indicating the increase of enzyme activity is specific by the combination between AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A. Moreover, the enzyme complex showed higher levels of [14C]-Gal incorporation also towards β-1,3-galactan acceptor by the enzyme complex compared to AtGALT29A alone (lane 8-10 in Figure CITATIONB). The results indicate an increase of GalT activity towards both SP32-GFP and β-1,3-galactan AG acceptors by the enzyme complex containing AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A when compared to a single enzyme. The SP32-GFP and β-1,3-galactan used in Figure CITATION are composed of heterogeneous oligosaccharides: SP32-GFP prepared from microsomes consists of various components with different molecular size (ca. 40 kDa, 75-100 kDa, larger than 150 kDa) and contains β-1,6-galactan side chains of a degree of polymerization (DP) from 1 to at least 8, as well as unsubstituted β-1,3-linked galactan [CITATION]. In contrast, β-1,3-galactan acceptor is approximately 25 kDa and consists mostly of unsubstituted β-1,3-galactan (DP 154) with trace amount of β-1,6-linked Gal [CITATION]. Galactose could be incorporated in the AGP molecule at different sites: at O3 of β-1,3-galactan (β-1,3c-GalT elongating β-1,3-galactan main chain), at O6 of β-1,3-galactan (β-1,6b-GalT making 6-branches on β-1,3-galactan) and/or O6 of β-1,6-galactan (β-1,6a-GalT elongating β-1,6-galactan side chains; Figure CITATION). We investigated the site of the [14C]-Gal incorporation catalyzed by the recombinant proteins among the above mentioned possibilities by treating the [14C]-Gal incorporated products made onto SP32-GFP and β-1,3-galactan with structure-specific hydrolases and subsequent size exclusion chromatography (Figure CITATION). The endo-β-1,6-galactanase and exo-β-1,3-galactanase used in this study specifically cleave unsubstituted β-1,6-linked galactooligosaccharides of DP3 or longer [CITATION] and β-1,3-linked galactose regardless the presence of substitutions [CITATION], respectively. Simplified model structure of arabinogalactan and reaction sites of enzymes. The cleavage sites of the hydrolases (exo-β-1,3-galactanase, endo-β-1,6-galactanase, α-arabinofuranosidase) used in this paper are indicated. Recombinant AtGALT29A produced Gal incorporated products susceptible to the treatment of endo-β-1,6- and exo-β-1,3-galactanases (Figure CITATION), therefore three possible sites (β1 → 6a, b and β1 → 3c) are conceivable as the candidate sites of reaction. Towards β-1,3-galactan acceptor, both β1 → 6b and β1 → 3c galactosyltransferase activities are possible, but the main compound released by the exo-β-1,3-galactanase treatment was galactobiose, and not galactose (inset TLC in Figure CITATIONC, D), indicating a β1 → 6b activity rather than β1 → 3c activity. Together with the β1 → 6a activity indicated by the endo-β-1,6-galactanase treatment, it is concluded that, AtGALT29A possesses β-1,6-galactosyltransferase activities both on β-1,3- and β-1,6-galactan (β1 → 6a, b activities). Analysis of the sites of Gal incorporation in the products produced by AtGALT29A alone or the AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex. The [14C]-Gal incorporated products onto SP32-GFP (A, B, C) or onto β-1,3-galactan (D) from P19 [∙∙∙], HA-AtGALT29A [---], or co-immunoprecipitated HA-AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A-GFP complex [▬] were treated with A: endo-β-1,6-galactanase, B: endo-β-1,6-galactanase + α-arabinofuranosidase, C: exo-β-1,3-galactanase, or D: exo-β-1,3-galactanase, and separated by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex Peptide HR 10/30. The [14C]-Gal present in each fraction was evaluated by scintillation counting. Endo-β-1,6-galactanase, α-arabinofuranosidase, and exo-β-1,3-galactanase used in this study cleave β-1,6-linked unsubstituted galactotriose, terminal α-linked arabinofuranose, and β-1,3-linked galactooligosaccharides regardless the presence or absence of substitutions, respectively. Release of small [14C]-oligosaccharides by endo-β-1,6-galactanase indicates the [14C]-Gal incorporation to a part of β-1,6-galactotriose, while exo-β-1,3-galactanase releases [14C]-Gal monomer from β-1,3-linked galactan and [14C]-oligosaccharide (s) from side chains attached to β-1,3-linked galactan. From the [14C]-products made onto SP32-GFP and β-1,3-galactan, exo-β-1,3-galactanase released mainly [14C]-galactobiose analyzed by TLC (inset C and D), indicating the incorporation of single [14C]-Gal to β-1,3-linked Gal at O6 in the [14C]-products. From any treatments (A-D), higher amount of small [14C]-oligosaccharides are released from the [14C]-products made by AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex compared to that from a single enzyme. The results indicate that AtGALT29A possesses β-1,6-GalT activities elongating β-1,6-galactan and forming 6-Gal branches on β-1,3-galatan, and the β-1,6-GalT activities are increased when AtGALT29A is in a protein complex with AtGALT31A. From the product made onto SP32-GFP, the treatment with endo-β-1,6-galactanase alone released large amounts of material eluting in the void volume, as well as small oligosaccharides with a peak at fraction 21, corresponding to DP2-3, from both the AtGALT31A/AtGALT29A complex and AtGALT29A alone (Figure CITATIONA). The material in the void volume in Figure CITATIONA was almost completely digested by co-treatment with endo-β-1,6-galactanase and α-arabinofuranosidase (Figure CITATIONB), indicating a part of [14C]-Gal incorporation occurred at the β-1,6-linked galactans substituted with Ara, and that Ara substitution sterically hindered the action of endo-β-1,6-galactanase [CITATION]. The results indicate that both the enzyme complex and AtGALT29A alone incorporated [14C]-Gal to both Ara-substituted and non-substituted β-1,6-galactans, and the level of total Gal incorporation to both types of acceptors was much higher with AtGALT29A in a complex with AtGALT31A. AtGALT31A was previously characterized using radish AGP as acceptor for the incorporation of [14C]-Gal and the product was digested by endo-β-1,6-galactanase [CITATION]. We tested the GalT activity of AtGALT31A using SP32-GFP acceptor used in this study and showed that the level of activity of AtGALT31A alone was lower than the level observed for the AtGALT29A alone (Additional file CITATION: Figure S3). Hence, the overall results indicate a cooperative action of GalT activity in elongating β-1,6-galactan of type II AG by forming an enzyme complex containing AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A. Treatment with exo-β-1,3-galactanase to the products made onto SP32-GFP released small oligosaccharides eluting at fraction 22 and 21 as a peak by AtGALT29A alone and by AtGALT29A in a complex with AtGALT31A, respectively (Figure CITATIONC). Both fractions contained galactobiose as the major component analyzed by TLC, but the amount was much higher from the product made by the AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex (Figure CITATIONC, inset). Since exo-β-1,3-galactanase cleaves β-1,3-linked Gal, the detected galactobiose is likely β-1,6-linked single Gal substituted onto β-1,3-linked Gal. Thus, the results indicate that both AtGALT29A alone and the AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex likely transfer Gal to O6 position of β-1,3-linked galactan, and that the amounts of [14C]-Gal transfer was higher by the AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex. The GalT activity towards β-1,3-linked Gal was further investigated using β-1,3-galactan as acceptor (Figure CITATIOND, [CITATION]). When the products made on β-1,3-galactan were treated with exo-β-1,3-galactanase [CITATION], the main peak appeared at fraction 21 (Figure CITATIOND) and much more [14C]-Gal containing compound was released from the product made by AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex compared to AtGALT29A alone. The major component released was galactobiose as indicated by TLC (Figure CITATIOND, inset) and the higher level of [14C]-galactobiose was detected from the product produced by the AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex, which is consistent with the result obtained from SP32-GFP analysis (Figure CITATIONC). Therefore, we confirmed that the GalT activity onto β-1,3-galactan is mainly a branch forming activity (β-1,6-GalT) and this activity is significantly increased by the AtGALT29A/AtGALT31A complex compared to AtGALT29A alone. Taken together, analysis of the enzymatic activities indicates that AtGALT29A alone has a β-1,6-GalT activity for elongating β-1,6-galactan and forming 6-Gal branches on β-1,3-galactan, and these activities are significantly increased when AtGALT29A is in a complex with AtGALT31A. Since in vitro analysis suggested an increase of the enzyme activity when AtGALT29A is in a complex with AtGALT31A, we also studied possible in vivo effects of co-expression of AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A for AGP glycosylation activity in N. benthamiana. We isolated microsomes after co-expression of both proteins and tested incorporation of exogenously added UDP-[14C]-Gal to endogenous type II AG, mediated via endogenous UDP-Gal transporter(s) and GalTs present in the lumenal side of vesicles [CITATION]. The synthesis of type II AG products was investigated by [14C]-Gal incorporated polysaccharide materials precipitated by 70% ethanol (Figure CITATIONA), or by type II AG precipitated by the β-Gal-Yariv reagent (Figure CITATIONB). In both cases, the results indicated a higher level of Gal incorporation to the polysaccharide materials and β-Gal-Yariv precipitates in the microsomes after co-expression of AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A compared to expression of each. Thus, the co-expression of AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A in N. benthamiana increases the Gal incorporation activity to endogenous type II AG materials in isolated microsomes. Galactosyltransferase activity in intact microsomes isolated from N. benthamiana after co-expression of HA-AtGALT29A and AtGALT31A-GFP. Microsomes were incubated with exogenously added UDP-[14C]-Gal and the [14C]-Gal incorporation to luminal endogenous materials were analyzed by precipitation either by A: 70% ethanol or B: β-Gal Yariv reagent. Error bars showed standard deviations from n = 4.
!~MM~! Full-length At1g08280 cDNA with and without stop codon cloned into the Gateway vector, pDONR221 and pDONR223, respectively, were the kind gifts of Dr. Masood Z. Hadi (Joint BioEnergy Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Plasmids encoding synthetic glycomodule peptides of AGP in a pBI121 vector (SynGMs: GAGP8 and SP32) [CITATION,CITATION] were the kind gifts of Dr. Marcia Kieliszewski (Ohio University). Preparation of endo-β-1,6-galactanase from Streptomyces avermitilis (Sa1,6Gal5A) [CITATION] and exo-β-1,3-galactanase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pc1,3Gal43A) [CITATION] followed the procedure described in the publications. Radiochemicals were from PerkinElmer (Boston, MA). UDP-Xyl was from CarboSource (Complex Carbohydrate Resource Center), and other nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) sugars were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. For enzyme assays, full-length At1g08280 cDNA containing a stop codon cloned in pDONR221 was moved into pEarleyGate 201 vector [CITATION] to create a hemagglutinin (HA) fusion tag at the N-terminus using LR clonase II (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Generation of a C-terminal GFP fusion construct for AtGALT31A (At1g32930) in the pGWB6 vector is described in [CITATION]. For microscope analyses, full-length cDNA sequences without a stop codon cloned in pDONR223 were moved into a modified pEarleyGate vector containing monomeric CFP (pEarleyGate mCer3; vector construction as described in [CITATION]) and pEarleyGate 101 [CITATION] to generate C-terminal mCer3-HA and YFP-HA fusions, respectively. Expression constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 pGV3850 for expression in N. benthamiana. Full-length At5g39990 (AtGLCAT14A) [CITATION] cDNA containing a stop codon cloned in pDONR221 was moved into pEarleyGate 201 vector as described above. Infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves with Agrobacterium strain(s) harboring the appropriate GT(s) was always performed as co-infiltration with the strain harboring the p19 construct as described in [CITATION]. The p19 protein derived from tomato bushy stunt virus works as a suppressor of gene silencing in the Agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expression system [CITATION]. For enzyme assays, N. benthamiana leaves were co-infiltrated with Agrobacterium strains at a final cell density of OD600 = 0.4. For the negative control, only the Agrobacterium strain harboring the p19 construct at a cell density of OD600 = 0.2 was infiltrated. The infiltrated plants were grown in a greenhouse (28°C/day, 25°C/night with a 16 h photoperiod) and harvested at 4 days post-infiltration. For microscope analyses, N. benthamiana leaves were co-infiltrated using the procedure described in [CITATION] with Agrobacterium strains at a final cell density of OD600 = 0.5. The infiltrated plants were grown in a growth chamber (25°C with 16 h photoperiod, 70% humidity) for 50 hours prior to analysis. Preparation of the microsome after expression of the recombinant enzymes followed the procedure described in [CITATION]. The total protein concentration of microsome solutions was adjusted to 5 μg/μL and treated with n–dodecyl β–maltoside (final concentration of 5 mM). To affinity purify the GFP fusion proteins, detergent-treated microsomal membranes (1 mg total protein) was incubated with 0.8 μg anti-GFP from mouse IgG1κ (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) at 4°C for 2-3 h with rotation followed by addition of 20 μL of protein G agarose slurry (contain 50% resin, pre-equilibrated in PBS) and additional incubation overnight at 4°C. For HA affinity purification, detergent-treated microsomal membranes (1 mg total protein) was incubated with 20 μL of monoclonal anti-HA agarose slurry (containing 50% resin) equilibrated in PBS with rotation for overnight at 4°C. In both treatments, the enzyme-immobilized resin was collected by centrifugation at 500 × g, 30 sec., at 4°C followed by three washing steps in PBS. The enzyme-immobilized resin was suspended in an equal volume of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 with 10% glycerol [CITATION] and used immediately for enzyme assay. Preparation of the microsome after expression of AG glycopeptides (SynGMs; GAGP8-GFP and SP32-GFP), is described in [CITATION]. The polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE) after digestion with the specific exo-β-1,3-galactanase indicated very similar compositions derived from type II AG for the SP32-GFP material and GAGP8-GFP used previously [CITATION], indicating the presence of β-1,6-galactooligosaccharides with DP 1 to 8, which are partially decorated with Ara, and the presence of unsubstituted main chain β-1,3-galactan for both types of acceptors. β-1,3-Galactan was prepared by three times Smith degradation of Gum arabic [CITATION], which contains mainly β-1,3-linked Gal and a trace amount of β-1,6-linked Gal. Average molecular weight is around 25 kDa, which corresponds to DP of ca. 154. The enzyme assays substantially followed the methods described in [CITATION]. For identification of the donor-substrate, the reaction was performed in the presence of combined or individual NDP-sugars as described in [CITATION,CITATION]. The reaction was performed in the presence of 0.1 mM NDP-sugar (containing 277.5 Bq of NDP-[14C-]-sugar), 28 mM HEPES, 10 mM MnCl2, pH 7.0, and 5 μL of enzyme-immobilized resin and 5 μL of GAGP8–GFP (5 μg/μL) as the acceptor. The reaction was performed at 22°C for 16 h and the products were precipitated in the presence of 0.25 μL of 10 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase and 0.28 μL of 0.3% H2O2[CITATION]. The presence of [14C]-sugars in the pellet was determined by scintillation counting after washing several times with water. In case the product was further analyzed by hydrolases, the reaction was performed in the presence of higher amount of UDP-[14C]-Gal, using 5 μL of enzyme-immobilized resin with 5 μL of SP32-GFP (5 μg/μL) or 4 μL of β-1,3-galactan (1 mM) in the presence of 1480 Bq UDP-[14C]-Gal, 28 mM HEPES, 10 mM MnCl2, pH 7.0 in a total assay volume of 25 μL. The enzyme assay using intact microsomes followed the method described in [CITATION] in a total assay volume of 25 μL. After 1 h incubation at 25°C, 250 μL of water was added and the mixture was sonicated for 10 sec to burst the microsomal vesicles. [14C]-incorporated products were precipitated either by 70% (v/v) ethanol at -20°C for 30 min or β-galactosyl Yariv reagent (10 μL of 10 mg/mL β-Gal-Yariv in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, Biosupplies) at 4°C overnight. The precipitated materials were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 12°C for 15 min followed by washing three times with 70% ethanol or 150 mM NaCl prior to scintillation counting. The products made onto SP32-GFP acceptor were collected by incubating with 1 μL anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche) for overnight at 4°C. An additional 10 μL of protein G-agarose slurry (containing 50% resin) in PBS was added and incubated at 22°C for 1.5 h with rotation. Immunoprecipitated material was collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 30 sec at 4°C followed by washing three times with 150 mM NaCl. The product made onto β-1,3-galactan was precipitated in 70% ethanol and washed three times with 70% ethanol. Treatments with 0.0022 U endo-β-1,6-galactanase and 0.02 U exo-β-1,3-galactanase in 80 mM McIlvaine buffer at pH 5.5 and 4.5, respectively, are described in [CITATION]. Co-treatment of the product with α-arabinofuranosidase (0.08 U, Megazyme) was performed in 80 mM McIlvaine buffer at pH 5.5, together with 0.0022 U endo-β-1,6-galactanase. The hydrolyzed products were applied to a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted by 50 mM ammonium formate (flow rate: 0.4 mL/min, 2 min/fraction). The [14C]-sugars in the fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed by the samples developed with acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) onto the TLC plate (Silica gel 60 F254; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Carbohydrate standards were visualized by H2SO4/ethanol (10:90, v/v) followed by charring at 120°C and the [14C]-Gal was detected using a Phosphor-Imager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 860; GE Healthcare). Determination of the protein concentration, SDS–PAGE and western blotting are described in [CITATION]. Native-PAGE was performed by NativePage Bis-Tris Gel System according to the manufacture (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). After infiltration with Agrobacterium harboring appropriate constructs, epidermal cell layers of N. benthamiana were analyzed by the method described in [CITATION,CITATION]. The following corrections were used: background subtraction, correction for donor photobleaching during the acquisition cycle (in the range of 1-3%), correction for acceptor cross talk into the donor channel (1-6%), correction for acceptor photoproduct formed upon bleaching (0.5-5%), and correction for the incomplete photobleaching of the acceptor (in the range of 10-40% unbleached fraction). Regions of interest (ROIs) representing Golgi vesicles were segmented as described in [CITATION], and rejected from further analysis if (1) their size was below 4 square-pixels, (2) circularity below 0.3, (3) the percentage of pixels above background in the ROI changed by more than 30% in the post-bleach image, (4) over 30% of their pixels showed out-of-range FRET efficiency, and (5) their averaged FRET efficiency was below -0.05. The pixel-by-pixel distribution of FRET efficiency for each protein combination was generated from pooling all valid ROIs.
