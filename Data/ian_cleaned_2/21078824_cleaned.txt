!~ABS~! Glucosinolates are amino acid-derived secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities dependent on chemical modifications of the side chain. Five flavin-monooxygenases FMOGS-OX1–5 have recently been identified as aliphatic glucosinolate side chain modification enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana that catalyse the generation of methylsulphinylalkyl glucosinolates, which can be hydrolysed to products with distinctive benefits for human health and plant defence. Though the localization of most aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic enzymes has been determined, little is known about where the side chain modifications take place despite their importance. Hence, the spatial expression pattern of FMOGS-OX1–5 genes in Arabidopsis was investigated by expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion genes controlled by FMOGS-OX1–5 promoters. The cellular compartmentation of FMOGS-OX1 was also detected by transiently expressing a FMOGS-OX1–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein in tobacco leaves. The results showed that FMOGS-OX1–5 were expressed basically in vascular tissues, especially in phloem cells, like other glucosinolate biosynthetic genes. They were also found in endodermis-like cells in flower stalk and epidermal cells in leaf, which is a location that has not been reported for other glucosinolate biosynthetic genes. It is suggested that the spatial expression pattern of FMOGS-OX1–5 determines the access of enzymes to their substrate and therefore affects the glucosinolate profile. FMOGS-OX1–YFP fusion protein analysis identified FMOGS-OX1 as a cytosolic protein. Together with the subcellular locations of the other biosynthetic enzymes, an integrated map of the multicompartmentalized aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway is discussed.
!~RES~! To investigate the spatial expression pattern of FMOGS-OX1, transgenic plants carrying the construct FMOGS-OX1Pro::GFP-GUS expressing the fused GFP–GUS gene under the control of the FMOGS-OX1 promoter were generated. Promoter activity was detected as GFP fluorescence or as a GUS signal in living plant material. In seedlings, GFP fluorescence was detected in vascular tissue throughout the radicle, hypocotyl, cotyledons, and foliage leaves (Fig. 1A). In fully grown leaves, fluorescence was found in the vascular tissue including the mid-vein and some major side veins (Fig. 1B). A less intense signal was observed in epidermal cells (Fig. 1C). In flower stalks, the GFP signal was found in part of the phloem and the xylem (Fig. 1G). Fluorescence was observed at the junction between the flower bud and flower stalk (Fig. 1D), but very little fluorescence was detected in petals, sepals, stigma, and anthers. Dense fluorescence was detected in vascular tissue of silique walls (Fig. 1E) and seed funicles which are the junctions between the silique septum and seed (Fig. 1F-1, F-2). Because of the autofluorescence, the GFP signal in roots was ambiguous. However, GUS staining showed that the FMOGS-OX1 promoter is active in the junction between the lateral root and its primary root (Fig. 2E). The expression pattern of FMOGS-OX1 by GUS analysis was in full agreement with the results of GFP fluorescence detection (Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Throughout the whole plant, high FMOGS-OX1 expression activity was detected in almost all the nodes, for example between the leaf and flower stalk (Fig. 2A), flower and flower stalk, or silique and flower stalk (Fig. 2B, C), and also the seed funicles (Fig. 2D). In roots, FMOGS-OX1 promoter activity was restricted to the junction between the lateral root and its primary root (Fig. 2E). Sections of fresh flower stalk tissue were examined by confocal microscopy. A FMOGS-OX1 fluorescence signal was observed throughout most parts of the phloem (Fig. 3A, B) which means that the FMOGS-OX1 promoter might be active in all phloem cell types: sieve elements, companion cells, and phloem parenchyma cells. In the xylem, GFP fluorescence was detected in the parenchyma cells (Fig. 3A, B). Fluorescence was also observed in an endodermis-like cell layer which is a single layer of cells between the outer cortex and the inner cylinder (Fig. 3B, C). Within flower stalks, between the endodermis-like layer and the vascular bundles there are usually 1–6 cells called S-cells. This cell type appears very large in both cross-sections and longitudinal sections. These cells have been suggested to be the predominant storage sites for glucosinolates (CITATION). In the present experiments, no fluorescence was detected in these S-cells (Fig. 3D, E) which indicates that FMOGS-OX1 was not expressed in S-cells. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] FMOGS-OX1 was chosen as an example to identify the subcellular localization of FMOGS-OXs. Two constructs 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP and Pro::FMOGS-OX1–YFP encoding the FMOGS-OX1–YFP fusion protein under the control of the 35SCaMV promoter and the FMOGS-OX1 promoter, respectively, were transformed into tobacco leaf by the Agrobacterium infiltration method (CITATION). At the same time, the coding sequence of FMOGS-OX1–YFP was subcloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli as described previously (CITATION). In both the transgenic tobacco leaves and transgenic E. coli spheroplasts, a protein of ∼79 kDa which is the predicted size of a fusion between FMOGS-OX1 (52 kDa) and YFP (27 kDa) was detected by western blot using anti-YFP antibody (Fig. 4A). Recombinant protein expressed in E. coli was detected to be active for S-oxygenation. Experiments proved that the YFP signal in the transgenic plants was from FMOGS-OX1–YFP fusion protein and that FMOGS-OX1 is still functional after fusion with YFP, hence the fluorescence detected represented the localization of functional FMOGS-OX1. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Five days after infiltration, YFP signals were detected in epidermal cells. YFP-expressing cells transformed with the construct 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP showed fluorescent signals located in the ER seen as a clear fluorescent network structure (Fig. 4B) and those transformed with construct Pro::FMOGS-OX1–YFP accumulated fluorescence in the cytosol (Fig. 4B). Comparing expression controlled by the 35S promoter with expression controlled by the FMOGS-OX1 promoter, the latter should resemble native FMOGS-OX1 protein. It is hypothesized that the ER-located fluorescence signal in 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP transgenic cells stems from the newly synthesized protein being transported through the ER or it could simply be accumulated in the ER due to heavy overexpression. In order to confirm this hypothesis, leaves transformed with 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP were treated with 5% cycloheximide which is expected to inhibit de novo protein biosynthesis without affecting intercellular protein trafficking. At 5 h after the treatment, ∼80% of the epidermal cells no longer showed fluorescence in the ER. Instead, a more intensive signal was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the treatment, FMOGS-OX1–YFP protein was relocated to the cytosol and therefore less or no fluorescence was left in the ER due to the inhibition of de novo protein synthesis. Fluorescence in the cytosol became stronger by accumulation of the relocated protein. Nine days after the infiltration, fluorescence in leaves transformed with 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP was observed in the cytosol instead of in the ER. This result indicates that FMOGS-OX1 may be stored in the cytosol, and the ER seems to be involved in biosynthesis or transportation of FMOGS-OX1. Activity/localization analysis similar to that for FMOGS-OX1 was performed for the FMOGS-OX2–5 genes. Comparable distribution patterns for these genes were found, albeit with some small variations in the leaf and root (Fig. 5). Like FMOGS-OX1, FMOGS-OX3–5 were expressed in vascular tissues throughout the whole plant. FMOGS-OX2 was only detectable in leaf and flower stalk but not in silique and root, possibly due to its low expression level (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In flower stalks, all FMOGS-OXs showed an expression pattern in the vascular bundles like that observed for FMOGS-OX1. No obvious spatial expression difference among the FMOGS-OXs was observed, except for the level of gene expression. Most of the expression variation was detected in leaves where FMOGS-OX1–5 were all expressed in the vascular tissue but with different patterns (Fig. 5A).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) were used throughout this study. Plants were grown in a growth chamber at a photosynthetic flux of 100 μEi at 20 °C and 70% relative humidity with a 16/8 h photoperiod. FMOGS-OX1–5 promoters were amplified as following. A 945 bp DNA fragment containing the FMOGS-OX1 promoter was PCR amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GGCTTAAUGGCGAAGAAATGGTCGTTGC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTAAUTTATTTTATTAAATTTCTATGATATGTTTGATTTTCA-3′. A 2.2 kb DNA fragment containing the FMOGS-OX2 promoter was PCR amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GGCTTAAUCAAGGGTAAGGGATGCTTGA-3′ and 5′-GGTTTAAUATATTTGAACTTTATGGTATGGTGG-3′. A 2 kb DNA fragment containing the FMOGS-OX3 promoter was PCR amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GGCTTAAUTCTCACGTCACGCCTCTACCCTC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTAAUATTTTGTCAAATCTTAATAATAGTAG-3′. A 2 kb DNA fragment containing the FMOGS-OX4 promoter was PCR amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GGCTTAAUTCCCCCTCATAAATTTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTAAUTTTTCAAAGTTTTGAATG-3′. A 2.3 kb DNA fragment containing the FMOGS-OX5 promoter was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GGCTTAAUTGAGCCTCGTCTTGCTCATA-3′ and 5′-GGTTTAAUCTTTTTTGTGTGATGATGATGC-3′. The FMOGS-OX1–5 promoters were then individually ligated to the 5′ end of the fused GFP–GUS gene in the plant expression vector pCAMBIA 3300 NLS-GFP-GUS by the USER method (CITATION). pCAMBIA 3300 NLS-GFP-GUS is generated from the original vector pCAMBIA 3300 by adding the NLS (nuclear localization signal) and coding sequence of the fusion gene GFP–GUS with User cloning sites (CITATION) for the promoters. In the resulting constructs, the fused gene GFP–GUS is driven by the respective FMOGS-OX1–5 promoters. To identify the subcellular localization of FMOGS-OX1, two constructs were made. The first one is 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP (yellow fluorescent protein). The FMOGS-OX1 coding sequence without a stop codon was amplified from cDNA with the gene-specific primers 5′- GGCTTAAUATGGCACCAACTCAAAACACAATC-3′ and 5′- GGTTTAAUTGATTCGAGGAAATAAGAAG-3′. Total plant RNA was isolated with Trizol and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The FMOGS-OX1 coding sequence was then cloned into the vector pCAMBIA 2300 35S C YFP using the USER method as previously described (CITATION). The resulting construct 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP can overexpress FMOGS-OX1 tagged with a C-terminal YFP. The second construct is Pro::FMOGS-OX1–YFP. Genomic DNA of the FMOGS-OX1 gene including the upstream sequence, which is presumably the entire promoter and the 5′-untranslated region followed by the structural gene (without the stop codon), the YFP protein-coding sequence, and the 3′-untranslated region of FMOGS-OX1 was amplified. Because genomic DNA of FMOGS-OX1 is too long, it is divided into two pieces and amplified separately. The above four DNA fragments were then fused and cloned to the targeting plant expression vector pCAMBIA 2300 u (CITATION) by the USER fusion method (CITATION). The resulting construct Pro::FMOGS-OX1–YFP expresses FMOGS-OX1 protein with a C-terminal YFP under the control of the FMOGS-OX1 native promoter. The upstream sequence of the FMOGS-OX1 promoter was amplified with the primers 5′-GGCTTAAU GGCGAAGAAATGGTCGTTGCGCT-3′ and 5′-ACCTCGTUATTGAATGGACCAGGAACTCTG-3′. The genomic structural gene of FMOGS-OX1 was amplified with the primers 5′-AACGAGGUAATGTTCCATTCAACTTGAGA-3′ and 5′-ACCATTGATUCGAGGAAATAAGAAGGATGAGAACT-3′. The coding sequence of YFP was amplified with the primers 5′-AATCAATGGUGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-ATTACTTGUACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGA-3′. The 3′-untranslated region was amplified with the primers 5′-ACAAGTAAUGATGATCTGCGACAAATATTGTCCAA-3′ and 5′-GGTTTAAUATGAACATAAATAAGAGTATCAACTTTAAGTTACTGGA-3′. To detect the fusion protein in transgenic plants with the construct 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP and Pro::FMOGS-OX1–YFP, whole protein extracts from the two transgenic plants were subjected to western blot analysis. Tobacco leaves were homogenized with extraction buffer comprising 5% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and 0.1 M TRIS-HCl, pH 8.5, followed by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. The homogenate was centrifuged and the soluble fraction was concentrated. For western blot analysis, the protein extracts were separated by SDS–PAGE, blotted onto a membrane, and detected with anti-YFP antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding sequence of the fusion gene FMOGS-OX1–YFP was amplified from the construct 35S::FMOGS-OX1–YFP and then cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pBAD-TOPO. The resulting construct and a negative control (empty pBAD-TOPO vector) were transformed into the E. coli strain TOP 10 (Invitrogen). Production of the fusion protein was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation; it was induced with 0.02% arabinose followed by growth at 28 °C, 250 rpm for 2 h. An E. coli spheroplast enzymatic assay was performed as previously described (CITATION). Protein western blot analysis was performed as described above. Image acquisitions were conducted on a Leica SP2 using either ×20 (NA 0.7) or ×63 (NA 1.2) dipping lenses. For GFP detection, the 488 nm laser was used for excitation and the photomultiplier was set to detect in the 525–565 nm range. To detect autofluorescence from the chloroplasts, the 488 nm laser was also used for excitation, and detection was in the 680–700 nm range. A UV laser (364 nm) was used to visualize supportive tissue and conductive tissue in the flower stalks; detection was in the 425–485 nm range. Microscopy was carried out in xy mode with a line averaging of eight scans in order to lower the contribution of unspecific random noise seen as background. The pictures were acquired as sequential frame by frame scans, meaning that the different laser channels were collected one by one where the frames alternated between 364 nm excitation and 488 nm excitation. Laser power was minimized to lower the risk of photodamage and photobleaching to cells while still having a clear fluorescent signal. Microscope data were processed using Leica Lite (Leica Microsystems) and Image J (CITATION). The histochemical detection of GUS expression was performed essentially as described (CITATION). Plant materials were cut and incubated in substrate solution at 37 °C for 12 h followed by removal of chlorophyll by submerging the samples in 96% ethanol. The samples were examined and photographed using a stereo microscope (Leica MZ FL III) or a research microscope (Leica DM R). GUS-stained flower stalk material was embedded in agarose as described (CITATION). Sections were made on an ultramicrotome (Leica VT1000S) and images were obtained using a research microscope.
