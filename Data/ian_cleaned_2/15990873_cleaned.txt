!~ABS~! Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 (MPK4) functions as a regulator of pathogen defense responses, because it is required for both repression of salicylic acid (SA)‐dependent resistance and for activation of jasmonate (JA)‐dependent defense gene expression. To understand MPK4 signaling mechanisms, we used yeast two‐hybrid screening to identify the MPK4 substrate MKS1. Analyses of transgenic plants and genome‐wide transcript profiling indicated that MKS1 is required for full SA‐dependent resistance in mpk4 mutants, and that overexpression of MKS1 in wild‐type plants is sufficient to activate SA‐dependent resistance, but does not interfere with induction of a defense gene by JA. Further yeast two‐hybrid screening revealed that MKS1 interacts with the WRKY transcription factors WRKY25 and WRKY33. WRKY25 and WRKY33 were shown to be in vitro substrates of MPK4, and a wrky33 knockout mutant was found to exhibit increased expression of the SA‐related defense gene PR1. MKS1 may therefore contribute to MPK4‐regulated defense activation by coupling the kinase to specific WRKY transcription factors.
!~RES~! To identify intermediates in the signaling pathway(s) mediated by MPK4, we isolated MPK4 interacting proteins by yeast two‐hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screening with full‐length MPK4 as bait. Initial immunoblotting with anti‐MPK4 antibody (CITATION) showed that the GAL4BD‐MPK4 bait construct in plasmid pGBKT7 was expressed in the yeast strain PJ69‐4A, and Y2H assays showed that this construct, alone or transformed with the empty pACT prey vector, did not activate expression of selectable markers. A total of 2 × 107 clones were then screened representing 6.6‐fold redundancy of the Clontech library used. Four clones encoding full‐length MKS1 protein were identified by prototrophy for adenine and histidine. The interaction between MPK4 and MKS1 was confirmed by selectable marker and β‐galactosidase reporter activation upon cotransformation of MPK4 and MKS1 in bait and prey vectors, and vice versa. Directed Y2H assays indicated that this interaction was specific, as MKS1 did not interact with MAP kinases closely (MPK5) or more distantly (MPK17) related to MPK4 (CITATION), or with MPK3 or MPK6 involved in innate immunity responses (CITATION). The MKS1 and MPK4 interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding assays. This showed that recombinant, N‐terminal 6xHis‐tagged MKS1 from Escherichia coli could pull down labeled MPK4, but not a control human lamin (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] MKS1 is a 222‐amino‐acid protein (predicted mass of 23 851 and isoelectric point of 6.0) that lacks predicted subcellular targeting sequences. MKS1 is a member of an apparently plant‐specific family including proteins from monocots and dicots (FIG-REF). Family members share a conserved VQ motif of unknown function (Protein Family PF05678; FIG-REF, domain II), while those most similar to MKS1 include a less conserved, N‐terminal region (domain I). In contrast, the C‐terminal regions are divergent although they contain numerous Ser‐Pro residues that are potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (CITATION; CITATION). MKS1 contains 12 Ser‐Pro sites, one each in domains I and II and 10 in the C‐terminal region. [[FIGURE]] Two family members have been partially characterized: Sib1, a nuclear‐encoded, chloroplast targeted protein that interacts with plastid‐encoded, plastid RNA polymerase σ‐factor Sig1 (CITATION), and tomato ACRE169 whose mRNA is rapidly induced following activation of Cf‐9‐dependent resistance by the race‐specific elicitor Avr9 (CITATION). This indicates that MKS1 family members may be involved in transcriptional regulation and in responses to pathogens. We have previously shown that the expression of a wild‐type MPK4 gene including a C‐terminal, 3 × HA epitope tag complements the mpk4 loss‐of‐function mutant and produces immunoprecipitable MPK4 that phosphorylates the standard MAP kinase substrate myelin basic protein in vitro (CITATION). We therefore used this system to demonstrate that immunoprecipitated, HA‐tagged MPK4 from plants phosphorylated recombinant His‐tagged MKS1 and three C‐terminal MKS1 truncations purified from E. coli (C1–3; FIG-REF and FIG-REF). This indicates that MKS1 is an in vitro substrate of MPK4, and that MKS1 Ser30 and/or Ser72, both contained in the C3 truncation, may be phosphorylation sites. This was confirmed by demonstrating that although MPK4 phosphorylated full‐length MKS1 carrying a Ser30Ala substitution, phosphorylation of the C3 truncation carrying this substitution was severely reduced (FIG-REF). MPK4 phosphorylation of full‐length MKS1 was competed at a 10 molar ratio, and abolished at a 100 molar ratio, by a synthetic 22‐residue peptide derived from MKS1 (pep22; FIG-REF and FIG-REF). This peptide (SDQQNQKRQLQICGPRPSPLSV) was synthesized because it included Ser30 and because the sequence upstream is reminiscent of MAP kinase substrate docking domains (CITATION). In contrast, the unrelated, 22‐residue Flg22 peptide (CITATION; CITATION) did not affect MKS1 phosphorylation. This indicates that MKS1‐derived pep22 specifically interacts with MPK4. Furthermore, the C1–3 MKS1 truncations interacted with MPK4 in Y2H experiments, while an N‐terminal truncation, N1, failed to interact (FIG-REF). These results indicate that MPK4 interacts with the N‐terminal region of MKS1 including pep22 and domain I, and that this interaction is necessary for MPK4 phosphorylation of MKS1. A selected monoclonal antibody raised in mice against MKS1 pep22 was used to detect recombinant MKS1 extracted from E. coli and endogenous MKS1 from plants, both with the expected mobility in SDS–PAGE (FIG-REF). Monoclonal anti‐pep22 antibodies also co‐immunoprecipitated from plants MKS1 with MPK4 immunodetected by the HA tag (FIG-REF). In addition, the levels of phosphorylated MKS1 detected with a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine‐specific antibody were markedly higher in wild‐type plants than in mpk4 mutants (FIG-REF). These results indicate that MKS1 and MPK4 interact in vivo, and that MPK4 is the major kinase activity that phosphorylates MKS1 under default conditions. [[FIGURE]] Transgenic plants expressing gene fusions between the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and MPK4 or MKS1 were produced to examine their subcellular localization. The MPK4‐GFP gene fusion fully complemented the mpk4 mutant phenotype, indicating that it provided functional MPK4 activity. Western analysis with a GFP antibody detected a single band of the expected size of the MPK4‐GFP fusion protein (data not shown), indicating that the intact fusion, and not a cleavage product liberating MPK4, was responsible for complementation. The MPK4‐GFP fusion produced weak but readily detectable GFP fluorescence in cytoplasmic strands and strong fluorescence in nuclei (FIG-REF). Similarly, the MKS1‐GFP fusion under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter or 1.9 kbp of MKS1 5′ upstream sequence produced strong fluorescence only detectable in nuclei (FIG-REF). The MKS1‐GFP fusion was apparently functional, as its overexpression via the 35S promoter produced the same phenotype as overexpression of MKS1 alone (see below, data not shown). In contrast, a control GUS‐GFP fusion from pCAMBIA3300, under control of the 35S CaMV promoter, produced strong fluorescence in cytoplasmic strands (FIG-REF). These results indicate that MKS1 is primarily localized in nuclei and that the presence of both MKS1 and MPK4 in nuclei is consistent with their ability to interact in vivo. MKS1 function was addressed in transgenic plants that overexpressed immunodetectable MKS1 from the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter (35S‐MKS1), or that underexpressed MKS1 by RNA interference (MKS1‐RNAi). Compared to wild type, 35S‐MKS1 plants were semi‐dwarfed (FIG-REF), accumulated increased levels of PR1 mRNA (FIG-REF) and of SA (∼13 500 ng SAG/g fresh weight leaf tissue in 35S‐MKS1 compared to ∼3500 ng in wild type), and were more resistant to the virulent biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (FIG-REF). Analysis of independent 35S‐MKS1 lines indicated that such characteristics of heightened defense signaling were correlated with MKS1 expression (data not shown). All of the 35S‐MKS1 lines examined were fully fertile and the expression of the MKS1 transgene was stable over at least four generations. In contrast, MKS1‐RNAi plants did not exhibit observable growth phenotypes (FIG-REF). These results provide functional links between MKS1 and MPK4, as mpk4 mutants exhibit dwarfism and constitutive defense signaling (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] As noted above, PDF1.2 defensin gene induction by JA is blocked in mpk4, suggesting that MPK4 mediates JA‐dependent responses to necrotrophic pathogens (CITATION). In contrast, MKS1 under‐ or overexpression had little, if any effect, on PDF1.2 mRNA levels (FIG-REF), indicating that MKS1 is not involved in JA‐responsive gene expression downstream of MPK4. To position genetically MKS1 in MPK4 signaling, mpk4/MKS1‐RNAi mutant plants were constructed. These plants exhibited partial suppression of mpk4 dwarfism and a clear reduction in PR1 mRNA levels (FIG-REF), again indicating that MKS1 acts downstream of MPK4. Furthermore, mpk4/MKS1‐RNAi plants exhibited decreased resistance to P. syringae DC3000 compared to mpk4 (FIG-REF). This partial suppression of the mpk4 phenotype by MKS1‐RNAi indicates that components other than MKS1 perform functions downstream of MPK4. [[FIGURE]] Comparative transcript profiling revealed that of 22 810 genes probed, 800 (3.5%) exhibited significantly differential expression patterns between wild‐type, mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1 plants (Supplementary Figure S1, clusters A–G). mRNAs of PR genes including PR1 and PR2 and the SA biosynthetic enzyme ICS1 (encoded by SID2) were increased in both mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1 plants compared to wild type (Supplementary Figure S1, cluster A). This suggests that MPK4 and MKS1 participate in regulating the expression of these defense‐related genes. Analyses of 5′ upstream regions of putative target genes revealed significant occurrences of two sequence motifs TAGACT and TGACTT, the latter a putative WRKY binding site or W‐box (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). This suggests that WRKY factors participate in regulating genes downstream of MPK4 and MKS1. To further analyze the overlap between genes affected by the mpk4 mutation and the 35S‐MKS1 transgene, the two were tested individually against wild type using t‐tests. Because the t‐test has substantially less power than the ANOVA, only the 800 most significant genes in the ANOVA test were considered. This revealed that mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1 significantly affected 350 and 156 genes, respectively, of which 76 genes were affected by both mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1. Considering the total number of genes measured (n=22 810), the overlap of 76 genes is highly significant (P=6e−99). This supports the finding that MPK4 depends on MKS1 in the regulation of a set of genes. Of the 76 genes affected by both mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1, only one gene was affected in the opposite direction, further supporting a relation between MPK4 and MKS1 in regulating a subset of genes. However, this analyses also confirmed that mpk4 affects the expression of other genes independently of 35S‐MKS1, as can be seen in clusters B, E and F that contain 112, 169 and 173 genes, respectively. Among these are a number of genes that are implicated in defense and stress responses: WRKYs 30, 32, 46, 48, 60 and 75, basic chitinase (PR3) and EDS1. This and the partial suppression of the mpk4 phenotype by MKS1‐RNAi (FIG-REF) indicate that other effects of MPK4 are mediated by effectors other than MKS1. Of particular interest are genes overexpressed in both mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1 (FIG-REF, cluster A), as well as genes underexpressed only in the mpk4 background (FIG-REF, cluster B). This latter group includes the JA‐inducible PDF1.2 gene, which was more than 10‐fold underexpressed in the mpk4 background compared to both 35S‐MKS1 and wild type. This confirms the RNA blot results (FIG-REF), and indicates that MKS1 function downstream of MPK4 does not affect defense responses mediated by JA. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate MKS1 function, we conducted a second Y2H library screen to identify additional MKS1 interacting proteins. Of 6 × 107 clones screened, four encoding WRKY25 (W25) and 11 encoding WRKY33 (W33) were identified and confirmed by β‐galactosidase assays. The interactions of MKS1 with W25 and W33 were also confirmed in vitro using His‐tagged MKS1 (FIG-REF). These interactions were apparently specific, as Y2H assays with MKS1 as bait did not permit the growth of yeast expressing the closest homolog W26, or yeast expressing W29 involved in flagellin responses (CITATION). Furthermore, W33 was found to interact in yeast with the truncated MKS1 versions N1, C1 and C2, but not with C3 (FIG-REF). This suggests that MKS1 domain II including the VQ motif is involved in the interaction between MKS1 and W33. W25 and W33 contain N‐terminal D‐domains with Ser‐Pro residues that may be MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (CITATION; CITATION). Although we did not detect interactions between MPK4 and W25 or W33 in directed Y2H assays, recombinant W25 and W33 were phosphorylated by MPK4 in vitro. Kinase assays with MPK6 or MPK4 immunoprecipitated from plant cells showed that full‐length W25 was preferentially phosphorylated by MPK4 (FIG-REF). In addition, the anti‐MPK4 antibody preferentially precipitated, from wild type versus mpk4, MPK4 that phosphorylated the N‐terminal regions of W25 and W33 (FIG-REF, left panel and data not shown). Interestingly, MKS1, but not the standard MAP kinase substrate MBP, inhibited W25 or W33 phosphorylation by MPK4 (FIG-REF, right). These results suggest that MKS1 may be involved in modulating the phosphorylation of the WRKYs. Two additional lines of evidence indicate a role for W33 in regulating gene expression downstream of MPK4. First, as for mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1, plants of an available insertion line with a T‐DNA in the first intron of the W33 gene accumulated significantly more PR1 mRNA under normal conditions and following infection with P. syringae DC3000 (FIG-REF). Second, these w33 mutants were significantly smaller than wild type when grown under short‐day (8 h) conditions. Of the 30 plants examined, the total leaf area (n=80 each) of w33 plants was 45% (±6%) and the area of the two largest leaves was 34% (±11%) of wild type. Such reduced growth phenotypes are typical of a number of constitutive defense mutants (CITATION; CITATION).
!~MM~! MKS1 (NM112755) is encoded by At3g18690, WRKY 25 (AAL13040) by At2g30250 and WRKY33 (AAM34736) by At2g38470. Y2H screening was performed with full‐length MPK4 and MKS1 cDNA baits and the Arabidopsis MATCHMAKER library according to the manufacturer (Clontech). In vitro interaction assays were performed with His‐tagged MKS1 purified from E. coli and 35S‐methionine‐labeled MPK4, WRKY33, WRKY25 and control lamin generated using a T7 polymerase‐coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). A 10 μl portion of 35S‐labeled protein was mixed with 200 μl 1% BSA in binding buffer (BB: 50 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM AEBSF, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was added to 1 μg His‐MKS1 protein bound to Ni beads in 200 μl 1% BSA in BB and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml wash buffer (50 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5% Triton X‐100). Purification of active HA‐tagged MPK4 was as described previously (CITATION). Phosphorylation assays were performed by combining MPK4, substrate protein (1 μg unless specified), 3 μCi [32P‐γ]ATP and kinase buffer (200 μM ATP, 80 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mM EGTA, 120 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Na3VO4, 4 mM DTT). Samples were incubated for 60 min at 30°C. The N‐terminal deletions used were Met1–Gln220 for W25 and Met1–Asn220 for W33. For detection of MKS1, polyclonal sera and monoclonal (HYB 330‐01, Danish Serum Institute, Copenhagen) antibody were used. A 1 mg portion of extract protein was used for co‐immunoprecipitation experiments, as described previously (CITATION). pS/TP was detected with 2321L antibody (Cell Signaling). Antibodies against MPK4 and MPK6 and flagellin treatments of Arabidopsis cells (Ler) have been described previously (CITATION). Free and glycosylated SA were analyzed, as described previously (CITATION). GFP expression in mesophyll cells of young leaves of stably transformed lines was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. RNA was prepared for gel blot analysis, as described previously (CITATION). Probe templates were amplified by PCR from cDNAs or genomic DNA with primer sequences from PR1 (At2g14610), PDF1.2 (At5g44420) and MKS1. For RT–PCR and Q‐PCR analysis, RNA samples were incubated with 1 U of DNase according to the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). RT reactions were carried out with 1 μg of RNA and 0.5 μg of random hexamer primer at 42°C with 0.1 U of RT (Promega) and 2 U of RNasin (Promega) for 1 h in 20 μl reactions. Product aliquots were used as template for RT–PCR and Q‐PCR analysis. Q‐PCR was performed using the SYBR Green protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 10 pmol of each primer and 0.5 μl aliquot of RT reaction product in a 25 μl reaction. A standard curve was made by determining Ct (threshold cycle) values for a dilution series of the RT reaction product for each primer pair. Using this standard curve, the relative quantification for each reaction was calculated from its Ct value due to a linear relationship between Ct value and log. Q‐PCR reactions were in triplicate and averaged for each line individually. PR1 expression was standardized relative to 18S rRNA expression for each data point. The relative quantity for the control sample (Col) at t=0 was arbitrarily set to 0. Expression levels of all other samples were expressed relative to this control sample. Primers were as follows: PR1: forward 5′‐gtgggttagcgagaaggcta‐3′, reverse 5′‐actttggcacatccgagtct‐3′; 18S: forward 5′‐cggctaccacatccaaggaa, reverse 5′‐gctgcaattaccgcggct‐3′. The CaMV 35S‐MKS1 transgene was stably introduced into ecotype Ler with pCAMBIA1301, and MKS1‐RNAi construct was introduced into ecotype Col via plasmids SLJ1382B1 (A Ludwig and JDG Jones, The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich) and pCAMBIA3300. The W33 insertional mutant was GABI KAT line 324B11 (CITATION). RT–PCR was used to show that it did not accumulate detectable W33 mRNA. The MKS1‐GFP gene fusion under control of 1.9 kb 5′ upstream MKS1 sequence was made, as previously described for producing the MPK4‐GFP fusion (CITATION). Bacterial resistance assays were performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Plants were infiltrated with 1 × 105 colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml). Values represent average and standard deviations of CFU extracted from leaf disks 0, 2 and 4 days after inoculation in three independent samplings. Plants were grown under 8 h light and 16 h darkness at 22°C for up to 5 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from three replicates of wild type, mpk4 and 35S‐MKS1 grown in a chamber with 16 h light (21°C) and 8 h dark (16°C). RNA was amplified according to the standard Affymetrix protocol and hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 oligonucleotide microarray (accession # E‐MEXP‐173, ArrayExpress database, EBI). Raw intensity data were normalized using R implementation of qspline (CITATION; CITATION). An implementation in the statistical language R of the logit‐t method (CITATION) applying one‐way ANOVA was used to calculate statistical significance for differential gene expression. Likewise, logit‐t was applied for the comparison between wild type and both mpk4 and S35‐MKS1. Genes with P‐value less than 0.01 were considered significant. Hypergeometric statistic was used to access the significance of the overlap of genes significantly affected by mpk4 and S35‐MKS1. Gene expression index values were calculated using the perfect match only implementation method (CITATION). Gene expression profiles for significantly differentially expressed genes were clustered by k‐means. For promoter analysis, 800 bp upstream regions from all genes profiled in the microarray experiments were extracted. All patterns from 5 to 12 bp in length were tested for significant over‐ or under‐representation between upstream regions of genes included in one of the seven clusters (Supplementary Figure S2) and all 22 810 genes. Hypergeometric statistics was applied, as described previously (CITATION). Supplementary data are available at The EMBO Journal Online.
