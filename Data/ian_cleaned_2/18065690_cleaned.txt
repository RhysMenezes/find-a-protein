!~ABS~! The conserved eukaryotic protein SGT1 (for Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) has characteristics of an HSP90 (for heat shock protein 90 kD) cochaperone and in plants regulates hormone responses and Resistance gene–triggered immunity. We affinity-purified SGT1-interacting proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf extracts and identified by mass spectrometry cytosolic heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) chaperones as the major stable SGT1 interactors. Arabidopsis SGT1a and SGT1b proteins associate with HSC70 in vivo and distribute with HSC70 in the cytosol and nucleus. An intact C-terminal SGT1-specific (SGS) domain that is required for all known SGT1b functions in immunity and development is needed for HSC70 interaction and for the nuclear accumulation of SGT1b. Interaction assays of transiently expressed proteins or their domains in Nicotiana benthamiana point to a role of SGT1 as a HSC70 cofactor. Expression of two HSC70 isoforms is upregulated by pathogen challenge, and while loss of function of individual cytosolic HSC70 genes has no defense phenotype, HSC70-1 overexpression disables resistance to virulent and avirulent pathogens. Moreover, mutations in SGT1b lead to a similar degree of heat shock tolerance as deregulation of HSC70-1. We conclude that an HSC70-SGT1 chaperone complex is important for multiple plant environmental responses and that the evolutionarily conserved SGS domain of SGT1 is a key determinant of the HSC70–SGT1 association.
!~RES~! In order to search for biochemical interactors of the Arabidopsis SGT1 proteins, SGT1a and SGT1b were fused to a C-terminal StrepII (Strep) affinity purification tag under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or their respective native promoters. SGT1b constructs were transformed into the Landsberg erecta (Ler) sgt1b-3 null mutant (CITATION), and SGT1a constructs were transformed into a Ler/Wassileskija (Ws-0) hybrid that was homozygous for sgt1b-3 (Ler) and heterozygous for sgt1a-1 (Ws-0 background) (CITATION). Multiple transgenic lines were selected that expressed the SGT1a-Strep and SGT1b-Strep fusion proteins in the appropriate mutant backgrounds, as shown for representative lines in Figure 1 . The functionality of the SGT1b-Strep fusion proteins was tested based on complementation of the known sgt1b-3 mutant defects. The SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase–dependent functions of SGT1b (root growth sensitivity to auxin and jasmonic acid) were fully complemented irrespective of the promoter used (Figure 1; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). RPP5 resistance to the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica was not restored (Figure 1; see Supplemental Figure 1 online), because transgenic plants exhibited a delayed cell death response. The double homozygote mutant sgt1a-1 sgt1b-3 is embryo-lethal (CITATION). Therefore, we crossed SGT1b-Strep transgenic plants into the Ler/Ws-0 hybrid that was homozygous for sgt1b-3 and heterozygous for sgt1a-1. Double homozygote sgt1a-1 sgt1b-3 mutants expressing SGT1b-Strep could be selected and were fully viable, indicating that SGT1b-Strep complements the lethality of sgt1b-3 sgt1a-1 (Figure 1). Therefore, SGT1b-Strep complemented three of the four known sgt1b mutant phenotypes in Arabidopsis. SGT1a-Strep expressed under its own promoter complemented the embryo lethality of sgt1b-3 sgt1a-1, which is the only sgt1a mutant phenotype known to date. [[FIGURE]] We previously reported the identification of a 70-kD band that specifically copurified with StrepII- and tandem affinity purification–tagged Arabidopsis SGT1b expressed under the control of the 35S promoter in healthy plant tissues (CITATION). This protein band was processed for mass spectrometric analysis. All 14 tryptic peptides belonged to cytosolic Arabidopsis HSC70 (predicted molecular mass of 71 kD; see Supplemental Table 1 online). The Arabidopsis genome encodes 14 HSC70 proteins of the DnaK superfamily, five of which (HSC70-1 to -5) are predicted to be cytosolic and/or nuclear due to the presence of predicted nuclear localization signals (CITATION). Despite the high sequence similarity within the family (83 to 94% amino acid identity), identification of the HSC70 isoforms in the sample was achieved based on two informative tryptic fragments, C and G (see Supplemental Figure 2 online), whose identities were confirmed by quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. From this analysis, HSC70-1 (CAB85987) and HSC70-3 (AAF14038) were unambiguously identified and could explain all 14 peptides detected by mass spectrometry. Therefore, HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 are two novel SGT1b-Strep interactors in healthy leaf tissue. We tested whether the interaction with cytosolic HSC70s is specific to SGT1b compared with SGT1a or is influenced by pathogen challenge by performing a StrepII affinity purification of SGT1a-Strep and SGT1b-Strep expressed under the control of their respective native promoters (Figure 2 ). Leaf material was either nontreated or collected at 24 h after inoculation with the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000 expressing the effector AvrRpm1 (recognized by RPM1) (Figure 2A). As observed by silver staining and on an immunoblot probed with anti-HSC70 antiserum (which does not discriminate between the different isoforms), HSC70s could be purified with SGT1a-Strep or SGT1b-Strep expressed under the control of their native promoters (Figure 2B). These data show that cytosolic HSC70s do not discriminate strongly between SGT1a and SGT1b in their binding and that the observed SGT1–HSC70 interaction is not due to SGT1 overexpression. The amounts of purified HSC70 were globally proportional to the amounts of SGT1a or SGT1b purified. For example, SGT1a-Strep accumulated to higher levels in total extracts after pathogen challenge, and this was reflected in the levels of purified SGT1a and HSC70 proteins (Figure 2B). We reasoned that SGT1 and HSC70 most likely interact directly, since no other protein could be detected by silver staining in several independent purification experiments. This analysis also confirmed indirectly that the tagged SGT1 proteins are soluble and present in the cytosol and/or the nucleus, since they interact with cytosolic/nuclear HSC70s. [[FIGURE]] We tested whether the spectrum of HSC70 isoforms copurified was affected by pathogen challenge. Unchallenged and pathogen-treated leaf samples were processed as above, and SGT1-Strep protein was collected using the Strep-Tactin-Macroprep resin, which allows higher recovery. Copurified HSC70 protein amounts were too low to perform the analysis with SGT1a-Strep. For SGT1b-Strep, HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 remained the principal interactors of SGT1b expressed under the control of its native promoter in both samples (Figure 2C; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Weak but reproducible signals were also unambiguously identified as HSC70 isoforms 2 (CAB85986) and 4 (BAB02269) in the pathogen-treated samples only. Previous studies showed that HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 transcripts are the most abundant of the cytosolic isoforms in young healthy Arabidopsis tissue (CITATION). In order to establish whether pathogen challenge modulates SGT1 affinity to individual HSC70 isoforms or simply reflects HSC70 abundance in the cell, we measured mRNA accumulation for the different cytosolic HSC70 isoforms by RT-PCR (Figure 3A ). Ecotype Columbia (Col-0) plants were infiltrated with MgCl2 buffer, virulent Pst DC3000 containing an empty vector, or avirulent Pst DC3000 expressing either AvrRpm1 or AvrRps4 (recognized by RPS4). Expression of Pathogenesis-Related1 mRNA was also measured to assess the responsiveness of tissues and ensure that unchallenged plants were not stressed prior to infection. Standardization of cDNA samples used for RT-PCR was done by measuring the expression of a constitutive Tubulin gene. HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 expression did not change significantly after pathogen infection. By contrast, HSC70-2 and HSC70-4 expression was barely detectable in untreated samples and was weakly induced in plants infiltrated with MgCl2. HSC70-2 and HSC70-4 mRNA levels increased substantially following inoculation with avirulent Pst DC3000 strains, the response to AvrRpm1 being earlier than that to AvrRps4. A weaker induction of HSC70-2 mRNA was also observed in samples responding to virulent Pst DC3000. HSC70-5 mRNA was barely detectable but was slightly induced at 24 h after inoculation with Pst DC3000/AvrRpm1. SGT1a mRNA accumulated to high levels in avirulent pathogen-treated samples, whereas SGT1b expression was not strongly pathogen-responsive, consistent with earlier analysis of SGT1 promoter:β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions (CITATION). Samples taken from the same material used for RT-PCR analysis were processed for immunoblot analysis with anti-HSC70 antibody. The results (Figure 3B) reveal that HSC70 levels increased at late time points (6 to 24 h) in the incompatible interactions, consistent with the constitutive expression of the HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 isoforms and the pathogen-inducible expression of HSC70-2 and HSC70-4. Since the HSC70 isoforms interacting with SGT1b broadly mirror the HSC70 expression pattern, we conclude that SGT1b does not discriminate strongly in its interaction with different HSC70 isoforms present in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus. [[FIGURE]] We considered that interaction between SGT1-Strep and HSC70s may be due to incorrect folding of SGT1, making it a HSC70 substrate (CITATION). Therefore, we tested whether native SGT1 proteins associate with HSC70 in wild-type tissues. This was examined by coimmunoprecipitation from plant soluble protein extracts using either anti-SGT1b antibodies that bind only SGT1b or anti-SGS antibodies that recognize both SGT1 isoforms (CITATION) (Figure 4A ). HSC70s could be coimmunoprecipitated in Ler and Col-0 total extracts with anti-SGT1b but not in extracts of the Ler sgt1b-3 mutant that lacks SGT1b protein (CITATION). Anti-SGS antibody coimmunoprecipitated lower amounts of HSC70s from Ler sgt1b-3 extracts that contain SGT1a. These results indicate that native SGT1a and SGT1b interact with HSC70 in vivo, implying a physiologically relevant association. [[FIGURE]] In order to characterize the interaction further, soluble protein extracts from healthy Ler plants were prepared as for the coimmunoprecipitations and analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. Fractions were then collected and analyzed on an immunoblot (Figures 4B and 4C). SGT1a (39 kD) and SGT1b (40 kD) were collected in fractions containing proteins with apparent molecular mass ranges of 41 to 89 kD and 41 to 115 kD, respectively. This observation suggests that SGT1 proteins are either not globular or that their apparent mobility is affected by interaction with other protein partners. Fractions that contained SGT1 proteins (41 to 115 kD) also contained the major HSC70 pool, consistent with a SGT1–HSC70 association and direct interaction in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Under these conditions, we did not detect higher molecular mass complexes containing SGT1. To better define the relationship between SGT1 and HSC70 proteins, we characterized the domains responsible for the SGT1–HSC70 interaction. First, we tested the effect of the enhancer of tir1-1 auxin resistance3 (eta3) mutant allele of Arabidopsis SGT1b on HSC70 interaction. The sgt1beta3 mutation causes a splicing error that results in a frame shift and a premature stop codon, leading to the synthesis of a truncated SGT1b protein that lacks the last 36 amino acids and therefore has a disrupted 94–amino acid C-terminal SGS domain (CITATION). Although the mutant SGT1beta3 protein is more stable than wild-type SGT1b, sgt1beta3 phenotypes are indistinguishable from those of the Ler sgt1b-3 protein null mutant (CITATION). Levels of HSC70 recovered in immunoprecipitates of sgt1beta3 extracts were reduced compared with those in the wild type in 7 of 11 repetitions, as shown in Figure 4A. This result indicates that an intact SGS domain is needed for efficient HSC70 binding in vivo. The association between SGT1 and HSC70s was confirmed and analyzed further using Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient coexpression of Arabidopsis SGT1 (Strep-tagged) and HSC70-1 (hemagglutinin [HA]-tagged) domains in Nicotiana benthamiana followed by detection of StrepII copurified protein on immunoblots (Figures 4D and 4E). In this analysis, SGT1b-Strep protein bound significant amounts of HSC70-1, whereas RAR1-Strep or SGT1beta3-Strep did not (Figure 4D). SGT1a accumulated to similar levels as SGT1b in N. benthamiana extracts but bound lower amounts of HSC70-1 protein (Figure 4E). In another N. benthamiana interaction assay, we assessed the efficiency with which endogenous HSC70 copurified with approximately equivalent amounts of transiently expressed Strep-tagged SGT1b or the individual CS and SGS domains (Figure 5A ). The CS domain from SGT1a (the SGT1b CS domain was not expressed) and a GFP-Strep control protein failed to bind HSC70. By contrast, SGT1b-Strep and SGSb-Strep bound significant amounts of HSC70. These results indicate that the SGS domain is necessary and sufficient for SGT1 association with HSC70. The loss of function of SGT1beta3 is more likely due to the loss of interaction with HSC70-1, since HSP90-1 and RAR1 still interacted with SGT1beta3 tested in a yeast two-hybrid assay (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). [[FIGURE]] We then tested which of the HSC70-1 domains interacts most efficiently with SGT1b by coexpressing its HA-tagged ATPase domain (N-terminal; 45 kD) or client binding domain (C-terminal; 19 kD) with SGT1b-Strep in N. benthamiana. Interaction between SGT1b and HSC70-1 was again strong (Figure 5B). We detected no interaction between SGT1b and the ATPase domain of HSC70-1 and very weak or no interaction with the client binding domain of HSC70-1. These results argue against SGT1b being a substrate of HSC70 and suggest that effective SGT1b binding is probably only achieved with the complete HSC70-1 protein. We reasoned that colocalization of SGT1 and HSC70 in one or more compartments would be necessary for functional interaction. We first investigated the subcellular localizations of fluorescent protein–tagged HSC70-1 and SGT1b after biolistic transfection of N. benthamiana epidermal cells (Figures 6A and 6B ). SGT1b fused to Cerulean (a derivative of cyan fluorescent protein) localized to the cytosol but could be seen in nuclei of ∼25% of 55 transformed cells examined (Figure 6A), suggesting movement of SGT1b between the cytosol and nucleus. In agreement with a predicted nuclear localization signal in cytosolic HSC70s (CITATION), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–HSC70-1 was detected in the cytosol and nuclei of 100% of cells examined and colocalized with cytosolic and nuclear SGT1b-Cerulean (Figure 6B). We then tested the subcellular distribution of SGT1a and SGT1b and cytosolic HSC70 proteins in Arabidopsis by preparing nuclear extracts from leaves of Col-0, eta3, and the defense signaling mutant Col eds1-2. HSC70 and SGT1b signals were detected in both cytosolic and nucleus-enriched fractions of Col-0 and eds1-2 (Figure 6C). Notably, SGT1beta3 protein (detected by anti-SGT1b antibody) accumulated only in the nucleus-depleted fraction but stimulated the nuclear accumulation of SGT1a (detected by anti-SGS antibody) compared with wild-type and eds1-2 tissues (Figure 6C). These data show that subpools of SGT1 and HSC70 protein colocalize in the cytosol and nucleus and that the SGS domain of SGT1b, which is needed for HSC70-1 interaction, is also required for nuclear accumulation. While nuclear import of SGT1b appears to predominate in wild-type cells, SGT1a has the capacity to enter nuclei in the absence of functional SGT1b. [[FIGURE]] To explore whether cytosolic HSC70s are involved in plant processes known to require SGT1b, T-DNA insertion mutants of HSC70-1 to HSC70-3 were isolated (see Methods) and characterized for resistance to pathogens. One insertion found in HSP70-4 did not diminish transcript levels (see Supplemental Figure 4 online) and was not analyzed further. We did not detect alterations in the phenotypes of the hsc70-1, hsc70-2, and hsc70-3 mutants after infection with virulent or avirulent strains of H. parasitica and Pst (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Gene silencing of the HSC70 gene family causes embryo lethality (CITATION) and therefore was not an option to overcome likely functional redundancy within these highly conserved proteins. Also, no specific HSC70 inhibitors have been described (CITATION). In animal and yeast cells, overexpression of HSC70 enhances tolerance to heat stress by increasing protein disaggregation but impairs normal HSC70 cellular function in protein maturation, degradation, and transport (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we examined the effect of modulating HSC70 function on the plant immune response through overexpression. Several available Col-0 transgenic lines that express HSC70-1 under the control of the 35S promoter (CITATION) were characterized, and lines 8-7 (a single T-DNA insertion; sevenfold overexpression) and 8-9 (multiple T-DNA insertions; fourfold overexpression) were selected for further study. These lines exhibited some developmental defects, such as a dwarf stature and a short root system, as described before (CITATION), but they did not have altered photosynthetic efficiency (CITATION), root architecture, or responsiveness to auxin (L.D. Noël, unpublished data). The HSC70-1 overexpression lines displayed a partial breakdown of resistance specified by four different Arabidopsis R genes tested (Figure 7 ). H. parasitica isolates Cala2 (recognized by RPP2) and Emwa1 (recognized by RPP4) were able to complete their life cycles in lines 8-7 and 8-9. Pathogen colonization was almost as extensive as that observed in the Col-0 sgt1beta3 mutant, measured by the production of conidiospores (Figures 7A and 7B) and trypan blue staining of leaves (Figure 7C). Partial loss of resistance was visualized by the appearance of trailing necrosis around pathogen hyphae, similar to that seen in Col sgt1beta3 (Figure 7C). RPM1-mediated recognition of Pst DC3000/avrRpm1 and RPS4 recognition of Pst DC3000/avrRps4 were also compromised (Figures 7D and 7E). Thus, HSC70-1 overexpression partially disables R gene–conditioned resistance to avirulent isolates of H. parasitica and Pst. Combining the sgt1beta3 mutation and HSC70-1 overexpression caused an additive loss of RPP4-mediated resistance (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), in support of a genetic interaction between these two components. [[FIGURE]] In order to test the effect of HSC70-1 overexpression on R protein accumulation, line 8-7 was crossed with Col-0 plants expressing a functional RPM1-myc protein (CITATION), and plants homozygous for the RPM1-myc and HSC70-1 overexpression constructs were selected. As shown in Figure 7F, HSC70-1 overexpression did not alter RPM1-myc steady state levels. It is unlikely, therefore, that perturbation of the assembly or maintenance of preexisting R proteins is the cause of the resistance defects arising from HSC70-1 overexpression. We considered whether the above phenotypes might reflect a defect in basal resistance that normally restricts the growth of virulent pathogen isolates. Growth of the virulent H. parasitica isolate Noco2 (Figure 8A ) and Pst DC3000 (Figure 8B) was greater in lines 8-7 and 8-9 than in wild-type Col-0 but not as extreme as in the basal defense mutant eds1-2. This observation prompted us to investigate the contribution of SGT1b to basal defense. Growth of the virulent H. parasitica isolate Cala2 was higher in Ler sgt1b-1 and sgt1b-3 null mutants compared with the Ler wild type (Figure 8C). We conclude that SGT1b and HSC70-1 modulate both basal and R protein–specified immune responses. [[FIGURE]] We explored whether the interaction between SGT1 and HSC70 cytosolic isoforms has broader biological significance by examining the requirement for SGT1 in the Arabidopsis heat shock response, one of several abiotic stresses that recruit HSC70 chaperone functions (CITATION). Data from a gene expression microarray experiment that traced the heat shock response of 18-d-old Arabidopsis plantlets grown in liquid at 25°C and then incubated at 38°C for 30, 60, or 180 min (L. Nover and P. von Koskull-Doring, http://www.Arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=expression_setandid=1007967124) were examined. After 60 and 180 min at 38°C, SGT1a mRNA accumulated to 3- and 12-fold higher levels, respectively, than in control samples incubated at 25°C, whereas SGT1b and UBQ10 expression remained unchanged (Figure 9A ). HSP70-1 was moderately and HSC70-2 was strongly induced by heat shock treatment, as described previously (CITATION). There was also a dramatic increase in the activity of the SGT1a promoter followed by a GUS reporter gene (CITATION) after heat shock. In seedlings grown at 25°C, detectable pSGT1a:GUS activity was restricted to two cell lineages of the root pericycle (Figure 9B). After 3 h of incubation at 37°C, GUS activity was detected in cotyledon tissues and was expressed in outer cell layers of the root (Figure 9B). The strong induction of mRNAs for SGT1a and the comparative low responsiveness of SGT1b after heat shock broadly mirror their modes of expression in response to pathogens (Figures 2 and 3) (CITATION). We then tested the heat shock tolerance of plants by immersing 4-week-old plants grown at 25°C in a water bath at 41 to 48°C for 10 min, as described (CITATION). Three days after treatment, extensive tissue collapse was observed in leaves of wild-type Col-0 and in the sgt1a mutant after treatment at 42.5°C (Figure 9C). By contrast, sgt1beta3 mutant plants displayed reduced tissue damage resembling that of the thermotolerant HSC70-1–overexpressing lines 8-7 and 8-9 (CITATION). The extent of cell collapse in these lines was quantified in five plants by measuring the percentage of total ions that leaked from leaves after heat shock. One hundred percent refers to the total ion content in the plant sample after it had been microwaved to release all ions. sgt1beta3 exhibited a similar degree of heat shock tolerance as the HSC70-1–overexpressing lines 8-7 and 8-9 (Figure 9D). Ler sgt1b-3 mutant plants were also more tolerant of heat shock than was the Ler wild type (Figure 9E). We conclude that SGT1 and HSC70 proteins have some overlapping functions in modulating responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. A correlation between the loss of HSC70 interaction of the sgt1beta3 mutant protein and the increased thermotolerance of sgt1beta3 plants further implies that heat shock sensitivity in the wild type involves the interaction of HSC70 with SGT1. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana accessions used were Col-0, Ler, and Ws-0. The Ler sgt1b-3 and sgt1b-1(CITATION), Ler eds1-2 (CITATION), Ler rar1-13 (CITATION), Ws-0 eds1-1 (CITATION), Col-0 rps3-3 (CITATION), Col-0 sgt1beta3 (CITATION), Col-0 pad4-1 (CITATION), and Ws-0 sgt1a-1 (CITATION) mutants have been described. Lines overexpressing SGT1b-Strep (Ler sgt1b-3 pXCS-SGT1b-Strep) were described previously (CITATION). Homozygous Col-0 plants overexpressing HSC70-1 (CITATION) were used: lines 8-7 (single insertion) and 8-9 (multiple insertions). Col-0 plants expressing functional RPM1-myc protein (CITATION) were crossed with HSC70-1–overexpressing line 8-7, and plants homozygous for RPM1-myc and HSC70-1 transgenes were selected in the progeny. Col-0 T-DNA insertion mutants in HSC70-1 (SALK_135531), HSC70-2 (SALK_085076), HSC70-3 (GK_758E01), HSC70-4 (SALK_029571), and SGT1a (GK_266H09) were ordered from the SALK and GABI-KAT databanks, and the insertions were verified by PCR and made homozygous. HSC70 gene expression was measured in these lines by RT-PCR. Two independent transgenic lines expressing the GUS gene reporter under the control of the SGT1a promoter have been described (CITATION). For pathogenicity tests, plants were grown in soil under a 10-h photoperiod at 22°C with light intensity of 180 to 200 μE·m−2·s−1 and 65% humidity. Hyaloperonospora parasitica and Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 isolates were cultured and prepared for inoculation as described (CITATION; CITATION). Two-week-old seedlings were sprayed with 4 × 104 H. parasitica conidiospores/mL in distilled water. Infection phenotypes were scored at 6 to 7 d after infection by lactophenol trypan blue staining and counting of conidiospores as described (CITATION). Bacterial growth tests were performed by vacuum infiltration of a bacterial suspension (1 × 105 cfu/mL) into leaves of 5- to 6-week-old plants. Each data point was analyzed at least in triplicate. For root growth inhibition assays, seedlings were grown in sterile conditions on vertically oriented Murashige and Skoog (MS/10) medium containing 0.5% sucrose in a white light growth chamber under a 16-h photoperiod at 24/21°C (light/dark). Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to MS/10 medium containing different concentrations of methyl jasmonate (Duchefa) or 2,4-D (Sigma-Aldrich). Root length was measured at 3 d after transfer. To induce a heat shock response, 7-d-old plantlets growing on MS/10 medium at 25°C were incubated at 38°C for 3 h or kept at 25°C (control condition) and stained for GUS activity for 1 to 2 h as described (CITATION). Heat shock tolerance was tested as described (CITATION). Values are means of at least three biological replicates. In order to express SGT1a-Strep and SGT1b-Strep from their own promoters, SGT1 coding regions with their 1.3-kb upstream promoter sequences (CITATION) were amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA. Primer sequence information is available upon request. Amplicons were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) and transferred into pXCG-Strep by LR recombination (Invitrogen), giving pXCG-SGT1a-Strep and pXCG-SGT1b-Strep, respectively. A pXCSG-Strep derivative, pXCG-Strep (CITATION), without the 35S promoter, was obtained by AscI/XhoI digestion of pXCSG-Strep, fill-in, and religation. To express SGT1 CS and SGS domains and the truncated SGT1beta3 protein with a C-terminal StrepII tag under the control of the 35S promoter, the corresponding SGT1 sequences were PCR-amplified from Ler cDNA clones and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). Amplicons were transferred by LR recombination into pXCSG-Strep, giving pXCSG-CSa-Strep, pXCSG-SGSb-Strep, and pXCSG-ETA3-Strep. Amplicons corresponding to the full-length ATPase domain and the client binding domain (CBD) of HSC70-1 were PCR-amplified from a Col-0 cDNA library and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The amplicons were transferred by LR recombination into pJ2B-3HA-GW (N. Medina-Escobar and J.E. Parker, unpublished data), giving pJ2B-3HA-HSC70FL, pJ2B-3HA-HSC70ATPase, and pJ2B-3HA-HSC70CBD. Four-week-old Col-0 plants were hand-inoculated with Pst DC3000 strains (107 cfu/mL) in 10 mM MgCl2 or with 10 mM MgCl2 alone as a control. RNA was isolated from leaves using Tri reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for use as RT-PCR template. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Primer specificity was confirmed by direct sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons. The number of cycles used was determined empirically to be within the linear amplification phase. RT-PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101∷pMP90RK was used for transient protein expression in Nicotiana benthamiana using pXC/pXN binary derivatives, as described (CITATION). Stable transformation of Arabidopsis was done by flower dipping as described (CITATION). Transformants were selected by spraying soil-grown 7-d-old seedlings with 0.1% Basta (Aventis). Resistant T1 transgenic lines expressing detectable amounts of the fusion proteins were self-pollinated to produce T2 seeds. Single insertion lines were selected by segregation analysis of the resistance in T2 populations on MS medium containing 10 μg/mL phosphinotricin (Duchefa). StrepII affinity purifications were performed as described (CITATION). For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 g of leaf tissue was homogenized in 2 mL of W buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 2 mM DTT) supplemented with plant protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich P9599; diluted 1:200). After centrifugation, 500 μL of the cleared protein extract was incubated with 10 μL of antibody by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 2 h. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-SGS (raised against the SGT1a SGS domain; S. Betsuyaku, A. Takahashi, K. Shirasu, and J.E. Parker, unpublished data) and rabbit anti-SGT1b (CITATION). Washed Protein A–Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added to samples and incubated for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 1 mL of W buffer and finally resuspended in 25 μL of Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblots with the Strep-Tactin-AP conjugate (catalog number IBA 2-1503-001) was performed as described (CITATION). The following antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-spinach HSP70 (Stressgen SPA-817); rat anti-HA antibody (Roche 1 867 423); mouse anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-SGS antibody (as above); rabbit anti-SGT1b antibody (CITATION); rabbit anti-PEPC (Rockland); rabbit anti-histone H3 (Abcam) antibodies; goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2004); goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2005); and goat anti-rat IgG HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2006). AP and HRP activities were detected with p-nitroblue tetrazolium and enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate; Pierce), respectively. Silver staining was performed as described (CITATION). Nuclei-enriched/depleted fractions were prepared from leaves of 4-week-old-seedlings as described (CITATION). Sequences encoding RAR1, HSP90-1, HSP90ATPase, SGT1b, SGT1beta3, and HSC70-1 were recombined into Gateway-converted versions of the vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (Clontech) (T. Lahaye, unpublished data). Plasmids were transformed into yeast strains AH109 and Y187 (Clontech). Diploids containing both bait and prey constructs were constructed by mating. Expression of the fusion proteins was checked by protein gel blot analysis using c-Myc and HA antibodies. Dilution series of the obtained diploids were plated on synthetic defined selective medium to screen for interaction according to the manufacturer and grown for 3 d at 28°C. To generate fluorescent protein destination vectors for Gateway (GW) cloning technology (Invitrogen), PCR-amplified Cerulean (CITATION) and eYFP (CITATION) and a Gateway recombination cassette were inserted into the pXCS-HisHA vector (CITATION), resulting in p35S-GW-Cerulean-nos and p35S-eYFP-GW-nos, respectively. The cDNA sequences of SGT1b (CITATION) and HSC70-1 cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) were recombined into p35S-GW-Cerulean-nos and p35S-eYFP-GW-nos, respectively. Detached leaves from 5- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana plants cultivated as described (CITATION) were used for transient gene expression in epidermal cells mediated by particle bombardment (CITATION). For colocalization, equimolar amounts of plasmids were coated onto the gold particles. After bombardment, leaves were incubated for 18 to 48 h at room temperature prior to microscopic analysis. Transient intracellular fluorescence was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica SP2 AOBS inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with argon ion (458-, 476-, 488-, 496-, and 514-nm laser lines) lasers. Additionally, a 405-nm diode laser (BDL 405 SMC; Becker and Hickl) was also installed into the Leica SP2 AOBS system. SGT1b-Cerulean was excited either with the 405-nm diode laser or the 458-nm argon laser line, while eYFP was excited with the 514-nm argon laser line. In cells coexpressing both SGT1b-Cerulean and eYFP-HSC70-1, the imaging was done in sequential mode. Cerulean fluorescence was detected using the Leica AOBS system and a custom 485- to 505-nm band-pass emission filter, while eYFP fluorescence was detected using the Leica AOBS system and a custom 515- to 560-nm band-pass emission filter. A 63× HCX PLAN-APO water-immersible objective lens (numerical aperture = 1.2) was used for imaging. Tryptic digestion of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was performed using a protocol based on that of CITATION. Digests were desalted for electrospray mass spectrometry with a C18 reverse-phase resin (ZipTip; Millipore). A Micromass Q-Tof-2 mass spectrometer operating with nanospray and the Masslynx software (version 3.5) were used for analysis. A 25-μL Ler protein sample prepared as for immunoprecipitation was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.2 mL/min flow with W buffer without Triton X-100. Then, 0.5- and 1-mL fractions were sampled, precipitated using 10% trichloracetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Column calibration was performed using the gel filtration low molecular weight and high molecular weight calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences). A microarray dataset describing the response of Arabidopsis plantlets to heat shock at 38°C was downloaded from The Arabidopsis Information Resource site (for detailed experimental setup and results, see http://www.Arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=expression_setandid=1007967124) and processed using Genespring software (Silicon Genetics). Normalization per gene and per chip of the log2 values was performed, allowing comparison of the two independent replicates available. Normalized gene expression levels of duplicates were averaged and used to determine levels of induction relative to control growth conditions (25°C).
