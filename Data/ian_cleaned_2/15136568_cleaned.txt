!~ABS~! Sulfate transporters in plants and animals are structurally conserved and have an amino-terminal domain that functions in transport and a carboxyl-terminal region that has been designated the STAS domain. The STAS domain in sulfate transporters has significant similarity to bacterial anti-sigma factor antagonists. To determine if the STAS domain has a role in controlling the activity of sulfate transporters, their stability, or their localization to the plasma membrane, we examined the effect of deleting or modifying the STAS domain of dominant sulfate transporters in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. The A. thaliana Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 sulfate transporters rescue the methionine-dependent growth phenotype of the yeast sulfate transporter mutant strain CP154-7B. Constructs of Sultr1;2 in which the STAS domain was deleted (ΔSTAS) resulted in synthesis of a truncated polypeptide that was unable to rescue the CP154-7B phenotype. The inability of these constructs to rescue the mutant phenotype probably reflected both low level cellular accumulation of the transporter and the inability of the truncated protein to localize to the plasma membrane. Fusing the STAS domain from other sulfate transporters to Sultr1;2 ΔSTAS constructs restored elevated accumulation and plasma membrane localization, although the kinetics of sulfate uptake in the transformants were markedly altered with respect to transformants synthesizing wild-type Sultr1;2 protein. These results suggest that the STAS domain is essential, either directly or indirectly, for facilitating localization of the transporters to the plasma membrane, but it also appears to influence the kinetic properties of the catalytic domain of transporters. 
!~RES~! Rescue of Yeast sul1 sul2 Mutant by A. thaliana Sulfate Transporter Genes and Requirement for the STAS Domain—A S. cerevisiae mutant null for Sul1 and Sul2 sulfate transporter genes, designated CP154-7B, is unable grow on medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source, but grows rapidly in medium supplemented with methionine (CITATION). A number of plant sulfate transporter genes have been shown to rescue this mutant to sulfate prototrophy (CITATION, CITATION), suggesting that the sulfate transporters of plants can be synthesized in yeast cells and localized to their site of function (CITATION, CITATION–CITATION). Previous work demonstrated that the A. thaliana sulfate transporters Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 were able to complement the yeast CP154-7B mutant, and this heterologous system was used to determine the kinetic characteristics associated with this and other transporters (CITATION, CITATION).  To evaluate the role of the STAS domain of A. thaliana sulfate transporters on transporter activity, abundance and subcellular location in the heterologous yeast system, we modified the Sultr1;2 gene in various ways and transformed it into CP154-7B cells. Most of our work focused on Sultr1;2, because it is a major transporter that functions in the roots of A. thaliana, and several mutations that alter the activity of this protein have been previously identified (CITATION, CITATION). We also chose to use the STAS domains of Sultr1;1, a sulfate transporter in the same group as Sultr1;2, and Sultr3;1, a transporter in a different group, to determine if the STAS domain of the different transporters influence transporter activity or localization within the cell. Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 are high affinity, closely related transporters with an amino acid similarity (identity) of 80% (69%). In contrast, the amino acid similarity (identity) between Sultr3;1 and Sultr1;2/Sultr1;1 is 69% (51%)/67% (49%). Furthermore, Sultr1;1 and Sultr1;2 are co-expressed in root cortex cells while Sultr3;1 is expressed specifically in leaves (CITATION, CITATION). Although Sultr1;2 is expressed constitutively, with some increase in the transcript level in response to sulfur deprivation, Sultr1;1 expression dramatically increases when plants are deprived of sulfate (CITATION).  The coding regions of the sulfate transporter genes, derived from specific cDNAs, were separately cloned into the yeast expression vector, pYX222x (CITATION), which was then used to transform CP154-7B. pYX222x is a high copy number plasmid vector with the 2-μm origin of replication and the HIS3 gene as a selection marker. Within this vector the inserted gene was fused at the carboxyl-terminal to the HA epitope tag. As shown qualitatively in Fig. 2, the HA-tagged Sultr1;1 and Sultr1;2, but not Sultr3;1, rescued the mutant phenotype allowing it to grow on medium in which sulfate was the sole sulfur source. A quantitative evaluation of the growth of the rescued strain on sulfate-containing, liquid medium, either with or without methionine supplementation, is shown in Fig. 3. Table I shows the doubling time of the different strains and transformants. In medium supplemented with methionine, transformants harboring the cDNAs for the three different transporters (Sultr1;2, Sultr1;1, and Sultr3;1) grew at rates that ranged from 65–75% of that of the parental strain (W303; the strain used to generate CP154-7B, carrying pYX222x to complement histidine auxotrophy) and attained a cell density of ∼50% that of the parental strain (Fig. 3, lower panel, and Table I). In contrast, in medium devoid of methionine, the CP154-7B mutant was rescued by introduction of the Sultr1;2 or Sultr1;1 genes, but not by introduction of the Sultr3;1 gene (Fig. 3, upper panel, and Table I). Those transformants harboring the Sultr1;2 or Sultr1;1 genes grew on medium with sulfate as the sole sulfur source at rates of ∼50% of that of W303; generally, CP154-7B harboring Sultr1;2 grew slightly faster than CP154-7B harboring Sultr1;1.  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]]  To determine if the STAS domain of Sultr1;2 was essential for rescuing the CP154-7B mutant phenotype, we prepared constructs encoding truncated Sultr1;2 polypeptides devoid of the STAS domain (Fig. 1). The limits of the STAS domain were defined by homology to the anti-sigma factor antagonist SpoIIAA (CITATION). The most carboxyl-terminal TMD of Sultr1;2 (TMD12) is predicted to end at serine 490 (490S) based on MEMSAT2 (CITATION), and homology to SpoIIAA starts at glutamine (522Q) and ends at leucine (649L), as defined by PROSITE (PS50801) (Fig. 1B). Two different “Sultr1;2ΔSTAS” constructs were tested for their ability to complement the CP154-7B mutant; in “Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-1” and “Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-2” the constructs encode truncated Sultr1;2 proteins that terminate at serine (492S) and tyrosine (517Y), respectively (Fig. 1). The Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-1 protein lacks the entire STAS domain as well as the amino acids that comprise the region that links the TMDs of the transporter to the STAS domain, whereas the Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-2 protein lacks the STAS domain but contains nearly all of the linking region. Neither of these constructs was able to rescue the CP154-7B mutant phenotype in medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source (Figs. 2 and 3, upper panel). However, in methionine-supplemented medium, CP154-7B transformed with these constructs grew essentially as well as CP154-7B transformed with the entire Sultr1;2 gene or empty vector (Fig. 3, lower panel). These results raised the possibilities that the truncated protein products were nonfunctional, could not localize to their site of action or were more unstable than the full-length Sultr1;2 protein.  To test if the STAS domain from one of the sulfate transporters could functionally substitute for that of another, we constructed three chimeric genes in which STAS domains among the different sulfate transport polypeptides were exchanged (see Fig. 1). Truncated Sultr1;2 (at alanine 506) was fused with the STAS domain from Sultr1;1 (at valine 502 to threonine 649) and Sultr3;1 (valine 498 to valine 658) to yield Sultr1;2–1;1 and Sultr1;2–3;1. Additionally, the truncated Sultr1;1 polypeptide (at threonine 500) was fused to the STAS domain of Sultr1;2 (alanine 506 to valine 653) to yield Sultr1;1–1;2 (Fig. 1). All the chimeric proteins were HA-tagged at their carboxyl termini. The yeast cells expressing Sultr1;2–1;1 grew as well as those expressing the full-length Sultr1;2 polypeptide in medium lacking methionine, while there was essentially no growth of cells expressing Sultr1;1–1;2 or Sultr1;2–3;1 (Fig. 3, upper panel). All of the strains with the chimeric constructs grew in methionine-supplemented medium at rates comparable to that of CP154-7B transformant with the entire Sultr1;2 gene or the empty vector (Fig. 3, lower panel).  Sulfate Transport Kinetics in Yeast Transformants—We performed sulfate uptake assays with parental W303 cells carrying the plasmid pYX222x and with the CP154-7B mutant harboring the Sultr1;2, Sultr1;1, Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-1/-2 and the chimeric constructs (Fig. 4). The Km and Vmax for sulfate uptake of W303 (which contains both the Sul1 and Sul2 genes) was ∼12 μm and 33 of pmol sulfate/s/mg dry weight (DW), respectively (Table II). Cells harboring constructs encoding Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 showed high affinity sulfate transport with a Km of 1.1 and 1.0, and a Vmax of 4.4 and 3.2 pmol of sulfate/s/mg DW (Table II). CP154-7B cells and CP154-7B cells expressing Sultr3;1, Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-1, or Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-2 constructs failed to show detectable sulfate transport activity (data not shown). Mutant cells expressing the chimeric protein Sultr1;2–1;1 exhibited a 4-fold lower affinity for sulfate and a Vmax that was higher than that of cells harboring unmodified Sultr1;2 (Fig. 4 and Table II). Cells harboring constructs for the chimeric proteins Sultr1; 1–1;2 and Sultr1;2–3;1 showed little sulfate transport activity, as indicated by their low Vmax for sulfate uptake (Fig. 4 and Table II), which was expected based on their inability to grow in sulfate-containing medium that was not supplemented with methionine.  [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]]  Localization of Sultr1;2, Sultr1;2ΔSTAS, and Chimeric Transport Proteins—To examine the subcellular abundance and distribution of the introduced transporters, we quantified the HA-tagged proteins in total cellular extracts and in cellular membranes of CP154-7B, and CP154-7B transformed with the various constructs after fractionation on sucrose gradients. An equal amount of total cellular protein from each strain was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and, as shown in Fig. 5, the HA-tagged transporters were detected immunologically. The levels of the truncated STAS proteins (ΔSTAS) in the cell were low relative to the levels observed in transformants expressing Sultr1;2 or Sultr1;1 (Fig. 5, compare lanes b and c with d and e); the Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-1 polypeptide was nearly undetectable. In contrast, the levels of Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-1, Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-2, and Sultr1;2 transcripts in the transformants were nearly identical (determined by RNA blot hybridizations; data not shown), suggesting that the differences in protein levels were a consequence of post-translational events.  [[FIGURE]]  In strains expressing Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1, multiple polypeptides of different molecular masses were observed. The product with the greatest apparent molecular mass, and the most abundant product, was ∼70 kDa, which is the expected mass of the full-length polypeptide, whereas a second antigenic polypeptide had an apparent molecular mass of ∼55 kDa; other less abundant, lower molecular mass antigenic species were also observed. Substantial levels of apparent full-length Sultr3;1, Sultr1;1–1;2, and Sultr1;2–3;1 polypeptides were also observed in whole cell preparations (Fig. 5, lanes f, h, and i), although transformants synthesizing these polypeptides were unable to grow in medium with sulfate as the sole sulfur source (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the Sultr3;1, Sultr1;1–1;2, and Sultr1;2–3;1 polypeptides were either not properly localized to the cytoplasmic membranes or that they were properly localized but unable to function in transporting sulfate into cells.  Fractionation of the membranes of cells harboring Sultr1;1, Sultr1;2, and Sultr3;1 constructs, presented in Fig. 6A, shows that much of the full-length protein in the transformants was present in the plasma membrane, co-sedimenting at the bottom of the sucrose gradient with the marker for the plasma membrane ATPase (Pma1p). As shown in Fig. 6B, between 40 and 70% of these transporters is present in the plasma membrane fraction (fractions 11–13 of the gradient). These results suggest that all three of the full-length sulfate transporter proteins localize to the plasma membrane and that even though Sultr3;1 appears correctly localized, it is not effective at facilitating the transport of sulfate into yeast cells. Furthermore, either none or little of the Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-1 protein is localized to the plasma membranes, with the majority being in the ER fraction; it mostly co-localized with the ER marker dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (Dpm1p). In the case of Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-2, much of the small amount of protein that accumulates in these cells co-sediments with the plasma membrane marker. This suggests that the linker region is important for localizing the protein to the plasma membrane or a membrane fraction that co-sediments with the plasma membrane in the gradient used for fractionation in these experiments; in another fractionation experiment, Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-2 does not exactly co-sediment with the plasma membrane (see “Discussion”). Furthermore, the linking region either directly or indirectly affects the abundance of the protein in the cell. In contrast, all of the chimeric polypeptides (Sultr1;2–1;1, Sultr1; 1–1;2, and Sultr1;2–3;1) synthesized in S. cerevisiae transformants were synthesized at levels comparable to that of the unmodified transporters, and all showed abundant, prominent peaks in the plasma membrane fraction, with some co-sedimentation with ER membranes. These results suggest that placing a heterologous STAS domain at the carboxyl terminus of either Sultr1;2 or Sultr1;1 allows for increased accumulation and proper targeting of the polypeptide, although the chimeric polypeptides, with the exception of Sultr1;2–1;1, do not appear to function in sulfate transport (Fig. 4) or enable cells to grow on sulfate as the sole sulfur source (Fig. 3).  [[FIGURE]]  We also constructed an in-frame fusion between Sultr1;2 and sGFP, with a 10-alanine repeat linking Sultr1;2 to sGFP. In cells harboring this construct we can visualize localization of the transporter in S. cerevisiae cells. As shown in Fig. 7B, in cells expressing sGFP from the plasmid pYX222x, the fluorescence signal appeared to be present throughout the cytoplasm of the cell; the exclusion of signal in the center of the cell is the consequence of the large vacuole present in the S. cerevisiae cell. In contrast, in CP154-7B cells harboring Sultr1;2 fused to sGFP, much of the sGFP appeared localized to the cytoplasmic membranes, which is visualized as a more even distribution of sGFP fluorescence over the entire cell surface (Fig. 7A). Some of the sGFP may be concentrated in the cytosol in the region around the nucleus, typically representing ER, and in the cytosol near the cell surface, which may represent endosomes and cytoplasmic membrane polypeptides that are being resorbed by the cell and degraded (Fig. 7A). Transformants expressing Sultr1;2-sGFP were able to grow in medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source, at a rate similar to that of CP154-7B transformed with Sultr1;2 (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! Yeast Strains—The strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this study were CP154-7B (MATα, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, sul1::LEU2, sul2::URA3), which is null for both the Sul1 and Sul2 sulfate transporter genes (CITATION), and the parental strain W303 (MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3). Both strains were supplied by the Yeast Genetic Stock Center. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium-acetate method described by Rose (CITATION).  Growth of S. cerevisiae Cultures—S. cerevisiae cells used for subcellular fractionation, characterization of membrane polypeptides, and assays for quantification of cell growth rate and sulfate uptake activity were grown at 30 °C in synthetic defined (SD), liquid medium containing 50 μm MgSO4, and supplemented with methionine, as indicated in the text. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cultures at 600 nm (A600) in a DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA).  Sulfate Uptake—The uptake of sulfate was assayed in exponentially growing cells (A600 < 0.4). Prior to the assay, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2000 × g), washed twice with sulfate-free SD medium, re-suspended to an A600 of 1.6–2.0, and incubated at 30 °C with continuous shaking at 220 rpm. Two milliliters of cell suspension was transferred to a water-jacketed vessel maintained at 30 °C and continually stirred, and the uptake reaction was initiated with the addition of different concentrations of (0.2–100 μm) at a specific activity of 189 mCi/mol. Aliquots of 200 μl were removed from the reaction vessel at five different times between 10 and 120 s following the addition of , and the cells in these aliquots were collected on 0.45-μm HA nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by vacuum filtration using an FH225V filter manifold (Amersham Biosciences) and immediately washed with 10 ml of ice-cold YPD medium (containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose). The filters were then immersed in a scintillation mixture (Ecolume, E&K, Campbell, CA) and radioactivity retained by the cells quantified in a Beckman-Coulter scintillation counter (Model LS6500).  Construction of HA-tagged Polypeptides Encoding Sulfate Transporters—Plasmids for the expression of the carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged sulfate transporters were constructed in pYX222x (CITATION). The plasmids expressing Sultr1;2-HA, Sultr1;1-HA, and Sultr3;1-HA were made by ligating the RT-PCR-amplified coding region of each gene into pYX222x yielding a carboxyl-terminal fusion of the HA epitope to the coding region of the transporter. The primers used were Sultr1;2-FEco (5′-atagaattcatgtcgtcaagagctcaccc-3′), Sultr1;2-RSal (5′-actaagtcgacttccgacctcgttggagag-3′), Sultr1;1-FEco (5′-ccggaattcatgtccgggactattaatccc-3′), Sultr1;1-RSal (5′-actaagtcgacaagtttgttgctcagccacttcc-3′), Sultr3;1-FEco (5′-agtgaattcatgggcacggaggactacac-3′), and Sultr3;1-RSal (5′-ataaagtcgacatacgttgttccaaggctcgtt-3′). The plasmid containing Sultr1; 2-HA was digested to completion with SalI and partially digested with PstI, enabling us to replace the STAS domain of Sultr1;2 with the STAS domains of Sultr1;1 and Sultr3;1; the chimeric proteins generated were designated Sultr1;2–1;1 and Sultr1;2–3;1, respectively. The primers used to amplify the specific STAS domain encoding regions were Sultr1; 1-STAS-FPst (5′-agaactgcagttctagggaagctgccaaa-3′), Sultr3;1-STAS-FPst (5′-aaaactgcagtgaagggaaacataccaaac-3′), and Sultr1;1-RSal and Sultr3;1-RSal, as shown above. Digestion of the vector containing Sultr1;2-HA with EcoRI and partial digestion with PstI allowed for the replacement of the region of Sultr1;2 containing the twelve predicted TMDs with the analogous region from Sultr1;1, yielding the plasmid containing Sultr1;1–1;2. The primers used were Sultr1;1-FEco (as shown above) and Sultr1;1–500TRPst (5′-attctgcagttcttggtctcgtcacttg-3′). A schematic representation of the different STAS domain constructs and the exact sites of fusion between the TMD domains of the transporters with the STAS domains are given in Fig. 1. For construction of Sultr1;2 fused to the synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) and HA (Sultr1;2-sGFP), the DNA fragment for the entire coding region of Sultr1;2 was amplified by PCR with the primers, Sultr1;2-FEco (as shown above) and Sultr1;2-RNco10A (5′-aataaccatggcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcgacctcgttggattttgg-3′), digested with EcoRI and NcoI, and cloned into pTH2 (CITATION), which generated Sultr1;2–10 alanine repeat (linker)-sGFP. The resulting plasmid served as template for PCR using the primer set Sultr1;2-FEco (as shown above) and sGFP-RSal (5′-actaagtcgacttgccttgtacagctcgtc-3′). The fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into pYX222x. All of the constructs were sequenced to ensure that no change was introduced in either the coding regions of the genes or the insert-vector junctions.  [[FIGURE]]  Microscopy—Strains expressing Sultr1;2-sGFP were grown in liquid medium to mid-logarithmic phase and mounted onto slides, and sGFP fluorescence was imaged using a Nikon TMD200 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon 60× 1.2-numerical aperture water immersion objective and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal head.  Polypeptide Analyses—Cells in mid-logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.2–0.3) were chilled at 4 °C, harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min), washed once in ice-cold wash solution (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium azide, 10 mm potassium fluoride), resuspended in cold TE-buffered 20% sucrose containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8215), and then disrupted by agitation with glass beads (425–600 μm). The protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Ten μg of protein was used for analyses of total cellular protein by SDS-PAGE (see below). To fractionate lysed cells into different subcellular compartments, lysates containing 600 μg of total protein was loaded onto a 5-ml, 30–60% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C for 19 h at 31,000 rpm in the SW-60 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The gradient was separated into 13 fractions of equal volume, and an equal volume of loading buffer (6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 6 m urea, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) was added to both total cell lysate and to each of the fractions from the sucrose gradient. The samples were heated at 37 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at full speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 2 min to remove insoluble material, and then the solubilized polypeptides were resolved on a 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE (CITATION). Resolved polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using a semi-dry transfer method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the polypeptides with a carboxyl-terminal HA tag were immunodetected by reacting the membranes with anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Sigma). Peroxidase activity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Specific antibodies raised to H+ ATPase1 (Pma1p), a plasma membrane marker, were obtained from Dr. Carolyn W. Slayman, Yale University, whereas antibodies against the dolichol phosphate mannose synthase 1 (Dpm1p), an endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER) marker, were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Signal strength was quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).
