!~ABS~! Ubiquitination is one of many known histone modifications that regulate gene expression. Here, we examine the Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of the yeast E2 and E3 enzymes responsible for H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1). Arabidopsis has two E3 homologs (HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 [HUB1] and HUB2) and three E2 homologs (UBIQUITIN CARRIER PROTEIN [UBC1] to UBC3). hub1 and hub2 mutants show the loss of H2Bub1 and early flowering. By contrast, single ubc1, ubc2, or ubc3 mutants show no flowering defect; only ubc1 ubc2 double mutants, and not double mutants with ubc3, show early flowering and H2Bub1 defects. This suggests that ubc1 and ubc2 are redundant, but ubc3 is not involved in flowering time regulation. Protein interaction analysis showed that HUB1 and HUB2 interact with each other and with UBC1 and UBC2, as well as self-associating. The expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and its homologs was repressed in hub1, hub2, and ubc1 ubc2 mutant plants. Association of H2Bub1 with the chromatin of FLC clade genes depended on UBC1,2 and HUB1,2, as did the dynamics of methylated histones H3K4me3 and H3K36me2. The monoubiquitination of H2B via UBC1,2 and HUB1,2 represents a novel form of histone modification that is involved in flowering time regulation.
!~RES~! There are two BRE1 homologs, HUB1 (At2g44950) and HUB2 (At1g55250 and At1g55255), in the Arabidopsis genome. To analyze the function of these homologs in Arabidopsis, two alleles of hub1 (hub1-4 and hub1-5) and one allele of hub2 (hub2-2) from the SALK insertion mutant collection were characterized. No full-length transcripts were detected for any of the three alleles; however, partial transcripts were identified in all three cases (Figure 1A ). [[FIGURE]] Mutations in HUB1 or HUB2 led to an early-flowering phenotype under both long-day (Figure 1B, Table 1 ) and short-day (Table 1) conditions. In addition, the small plant size and pale green leaves observed by CITATION and CITATION using the alleles we used and two additional alleles were evident in the mutants (Figures 1B and 1C). The three alleles of hub1 and hub2 produced quite similar phenotypes (Figure 1B, Table 1). Furthermore, the phenotype of the double mutant was very similar to that of each single mutant (Figure 1B, Table 1), suggesting that both HUB1 and HUB2 are required for the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis. Summary of Flowering of the Wild Type and Mutants Next, a complementation assay was conducted by transforming HUB1 and HUB2 into hub1 and hub2 mutant plants, respectively. Native promoter-driven HUB1 and HUB2 coding sequence (CDS) completely rescued the hub1 and hub2 phenotypes (Figure 1D, Table 2 ). By contrast, mutant versions of HUB1 (C841A and H843A) and HUB2 (C844A and H846A) (which alter the two conserved and necessary amino acid residues for E3 activity in yeast; see Supplemental Figure 2B online) were unable to rescue the phenotypes of the hub1 and hub2 mutants (Figure 1E), suggesting that the E3 activity of HUB1 and HUB2 is necessary for its function in Arabidopsis flowering time control. Summary of Flowering of the Wild Type, Mutants, and Complementation Lines Neither HUB1 nor HUB2 was functional if yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was fused to its C terminus; however, both proteins functioned normally with YFP fused to their N termini. The RING finger domain in HUB1 and HUB2 is located at the very end of the C terminus, which suggests that a free RING finger domain is necessary for proper functionality in HUB1 and HUB2. Genetic analysis revealed that both HUB1 and HUB2 are necessary for flowering time control in Arabidopsis (Figure 1B); this observation is also true for HUB1,2-mediated leaf development and seed dormancy (CITATION; CITATION). One possible explanation for this result is that the two proteins work together in the same protein complex. Thus, we tested for a physical interaction between HUB1 and HUB2 by yeast two-hybrid assay. HUB1 and HUB2 were able to self-associate and to interact in a pairwise fashion (Figure 2A ), suggesting that they form both homodimers and heterodimers. [[FIGURE]] This result was confirmed in Arabidopsis protoplasts using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. HUB1 and HUB2 interacted with both HUB1 and HUB2, whereas neither HUB1 (YFPN-HUB1 or YFPC-HUB1) nor HUB2 (YFPN-HUB2 or YFPC-HUB2) was able to interact with YFPC or YFPN (Figure 2B), suggesting that the observed interactions were specific. The interaction between HUB1 and HUB2 took place in the nucleus (Figure 2B), which is consistent with the function (histone modification) of the proteins. RAD6 is conserved in a number of species, and there are three RAD6 homologs, UBC1, UBC2, and UBC3, in the Arabidopsis genome (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). To determine the function of each of these E2s and whether they are involved in the HUB1,2 pathway, we first characterized T-DNA insertion mutants for the three genes. One T-DNA insertion mutant was available for each of the three genes in the SALK insertion mutant collection (CITATION). Transcript analysis indicated a lack of full-length transcripts in all three mutants. ubc1 and ubc2 had partial transcripts, whereas ubc3 did not, suggesting that it was a null mutant (Figure 3A ). [[FIGURE]] None of the single mutants exhibited obvious defects in flowering time (Figure 3B, Table 1). The ubc1 ubc2 double mutant flowered early and exhibited a phenotype similar to that of hub1 or hub2 (Figures 1B and 3B, Table 1), whereas the ubc1 ubc3 and ubc2 ubc3 double mutants did not show visible defects in flowering time under both long- and short-day conditions (Figure 3B, Table 1). The early-flowering phenotype observed in ubc1 ubc2 double mutant was completely rescued by transformation of the double mutant with UBC1 or UBC2 genomic DNA (Figure 3C, Table 2), indicating that UBC1 and UBC2 are functionally redundant and that UBC3 is not involved in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis. Although ubc1 ubc3 and ubc2 ubc3 double mutants did not exhibit an obvious flowering phenotype, the ubc1 ubc2 ubc3 triple mutant exhibited pleiotropic defects, including dwarfism, an increased number of branches, and sterility (Figure 3D). These results suggest that the three E2s are involved in multiple developmental processes and that they are functionally redundant in processes other than flowering time. UBC1, UBC2, and UBC3 are homologous proteins with very high identities (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Expression pattern analysis using promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic plants revealed that the three genes are expressed ubiquitously in seedlings, leaves, roots, and flowers (Figure 4A ), which is consistent with the results of a previous report (CITATION), and that they are functionally redundant in the control of multiple developmental processes. [[FIGURE]] However, the results of the above functional analysis suggested that UBC3 is different from UBC1 and UBC2 in terms of its effect on flowering time in Arabidopsis (Figure 3B). As floral organ identity is determined by the genes expressed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) (CITATION), we analyzed the expression pattern of UBC1, UBC2, and UBC3 in the SAM. Our efforts to determine the expression level of these genes in the SAM by in situ hybridization were hampered by their apparently weak expression. We therefore examined the expression pattern of the E2s in the SAM using promoter-GUS fusion transgenic lines. As shown in Figure 4B, UBC1:GUS and UBC2:GUS were ubiquitously expressed in the SAM, whereas no UBC3:GUS expression was detected in the central region of the SAM. This suggests that the expression pattern of UBC3 is different from that of UBC1 or UBC2 in the SAM, and this difference in expression may be responsible for the distinct role that each gene plays in the control of flowering time. The hub1 or hub2 single mutant phenotype is similar to the ubc1 ubc2 double mutant phenotype (Figures 1B and 3B), indicating that these two groups of proteins may interact and that they may be involved in the same pathway. We found that the expression patterns for HUB1, HUB2, UBC1, and UBC2 were very similar in seedlings, leaves, roots, flowers, and the SAM (Figure 4). We examined the physical interaction between UBC1/2 and HUB1/2 in yeast. It was found that HUB1 and HUB2 interacted with UBC1 and UBC2 in yeast, as indicated by the growth of yeast strains cotransformed with HUB1 or HUB2 and UBC1 or UBC2 on high-stringency selection medium (Figure 5A ). The RING finger domain of HUB1 or HUB2 was shown to be necessary for its interactions with UBC1 and UBC2, due to the fact that each interaction was abolished if the RING finger domain was deleted (Figure 5B). However, the observed interactions were weak, as indicated quantitatively by a β-galactosidase activity assay (Figure 5A). No interaction was detected for UBC1-UBC1, UBC2-UBC2, or UBC1-UBC2, suggesting that these E2s cannot form homodimers or heterodimers. [[FIGURE]] To analyze the genetic interaction between HUB1 or HUB2 and UBC1 or UBC2, we generated double and triple mutants for the corresponding genes. The phenotypes of the double and triple mutants were similar to those of the hub1 or hub2 single and ubc1 ubc2 double mutants (Figures 5C and 5D), thus providing genetic evidence of the involvement of the UBC1,2/HUB1,2 pathway in flowering in Arabidopsis. To test whether HUB1/2 and UBC1/UBC2 are the E3s and E2s responsible for the production of H2Bub1 in flowering time control in Arabidopsis under our conditions, we examined the in vivo H2Bub1 pattern in wild-type and mutant plants. As the anti-H2B antibodies for animal H2B did not work in Arabidopsis and anti-H2Bub1 antibody was not available when we conducted the experiment, FLAG-tagged H2B (At3g45980) was transformed into wild-type and hub1/2 or ubc1/2/3 plants. Anti-FLAG antibodies detected two bands (upper and lower) in wild-type, ubc1, ubc2, ubc3 single mutant, ubc1 ubc3, and ubc2 ubc3 double mutant plants (Figure 6A ). However, no upper band was detected in hub1 and hub2 single, double, or ubc1 ubc2 double mutant plants (Figure 6A), indicating that the upper band corresponds to monoubiquitinated H2B. This result further suggests UBC1,2 and HUB1,2 are required for H2Bub1 formation and that the UBC1,2/HUB1,2-mediated production of H2Bub1 is genome-wide and not gene specific. [[FIGURE]] To obtain additional evidence in support of this notion, we transformed a mutant version of H2B into wild-type plants. Based on the site of ubiquitination in human H2B (CITATION), K146 was identified as the likely site of monoubiquitination in Arabidopsis H2B. The upper band was absent from transgenic plants expressing mutant (K146A) H2B, whereas it was present in transgenic plants carrying wild-type H2B (Figures 6B and 6C). The upper band was recognized by antiubiquitin antibodies as well (Figure 6C). These results confirm that the upper band corresponds to monoubiquitinated H2B and that the site of monoubiquitination in Arabidopsis is K146. Moreover, the H2Bub1 patterns in the wild-type and mutant plants clearly indicate that the early-flowering phenotype of the mutants is caused by the loss of H2Bub1 (Figure 6A). In addition, we found that the phenotype of 10 out of 34 independent transgenic lines expressing the mutated version of H2B (H2BK146A) was indistinguishable from that of hub1 and hub2 single mutants and the ubc1 ubc2 double mutant (Figures 6D and 6E), and the early flowering phenotype was correlated with the expression level of H2BK146A protein (Figure 6E, lines 2 and 30 exhibited phenotype, while lines 8 and 22 did not), providing further evidence that H2Bub1 is required for flowering time control in Arabidopsis. To further confirm that HUB1 and HUB2 are functional homologs of yeast BRE1, HUB1 or HUB2 was transformed into yeast bre1. Both HUB1 and HUB2 rescued the bre1 phenotype when expressed under the control of the yeast BRE1 promoter (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). However, the bre1 phenotype was not rescued if HUB1 or HUB2 was driven by the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase1 (highly and constitutively expressed) promoter (see Supplemental Figure 2C online), suggesting that the precise level of HUB1,2 is important for its function. To further provide evidence that the E3 activity of HUB1,2 is necessary for the rescue of the yeast bre1 phenotype, a mutated version of HUB1 (C841A or H843A) or HUB2 (C844A or H846A) (see Supplemental Figure 2B online) was transformed into yeast bre1 cells. The bre1 phenotype was not rescued by the mutated version of HUB1 or HUB2, even if they were driven by the BRE1 promoter (see Supplemental Figure 2D online). Thus, HUB1 and HUB2 are functional homologs of yeast BRE1, and the E3 activity of the proteins is necessary for their functionality in yeast. As FLC and its homologs are central players in the control of flowering time (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we examined whether the expression of FLC and its homologs was altered in hub1 and hub2 single mutants and ubc1 ubc2 double mutants by quantitative real-time PCR. FLC expression was repressed in hub1-4 and ubc1 ubc2, but surprisingly not in hub2-2 or hub1-4 hub2-2 (Figure 7A ). In addition, the expression of some other members of the FLC clade was repressed in the mutants, albeit to different extents (Figure 7A). Among them, the expression of MAF4 and MAF5 in the mutants was significantly repressed compared with that in wild-type plants (Figure 7A). As the expression of FLC was not repressed in hub2 or hub1 hub2, we examined the expression of flower-time integrator gene FT and found that FT expression was significantly increased in all four mutants (Figure 7B), which is consistent with the early flowering phenotype for those mutants. This result suggests that repression of other FLC clade genes, such as MAF1, MAF4, and MAF5, are responsible for the early flowering phenotype in hub2-2 and hub1-4 hub2-2. The reason for this inconsistent repression of FLC expression in the different mutants is unclear. There is no obvious change for the expressions of ACTIN, TUBULIN, elongation factor 1 (eEF-1), or glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) between wild-type and the four mutant plants (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). This result indicates that defects in H2Bub1 specifically lead to the repression of FLC and some other FLC clade genes, thus promoting flowering. [[FIGURE]] We next examined whether FLC/MAF chromatin can be monoubiquitinated and whether the UBC1,2/HUB1,2 pathway is responsible for the modification. As our double chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using anti-FLAG(H2B) and -ubiquitin antibodies was unsuccessful, we used a monoclonal anti-H2Bub1 antibody (CITATION) for this purpose. We first examined whether the antibody could be used in Arabidopsis and found that the antibody clearly recognized a protein band with a molecular mass of ∼28 kD. The band was not detected in hub1, or ubc1 ubc2 mutant plants (Figure 8B ), suggesting that the antibody works in Arabidopsis and indicating again that the UBC1,2/HUB1,2 pathway is required for H2Bub1. [[FIGURE]] H2B was monoubiquitinated in the gene body region of FLC chromatin; however, it was either not ubiquitinated or monoubiquitinated at a very low level in the promoter region (Figures 8C and 8D). There was a significant reduction in the level of H2Bub1 in the gene body region of FLC chromatin in hub1 and ubc1 ubc2 plants (Figures 8C and 8D). H2B was also monoubiquitinated in the chromatin of other FLC clade genes (Figures 8C, 8E, and 8F), though the level of monoubiquitination in MAF2 and MAF3 chromatin was much higher than that in FLC, MAF4, or MAF5 (Figure 8F). The level of H2Bub1 in the chromatin of all FLC clade genes was significantly reduced in the mutants compared with wild-type plants (Figures 8C and 8E). Thus, FLC clade gene-specific H2Bub1 is dependent on the UBC1,2/HUB1,2 pathway. We also detected H2Bub1 in the chromatin of the ACTIN gene, and it was determined that the monoubiquitination was dependent on the activity of UBC1,2/HUB1,2 (Figures 8C and 8G). The activation and repression of a gene are controlled by the modification state of its chromatin. In general, histones H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 are necessary for gene activation, while H3K9me2 is associated with gene silencing (CITATION). Thus, we examined the interaction between H2Bub1 and H3 methylation in Arabidopsis. Although no H2Bub1 was detected in hub1, hub2, or ubc1 ubc2 mutant plants, there was no obvious difference in the genome-wide level of H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1, H3K36me2, or H3K9me2 modification between wild-type and hub1, hub2, or ubc1 ubc2 mutant plants (Figure 9A ). [[FIGURE]] Thus, we examined whether H2Bub1 is necessary for gene-specific histone H3 methylation by comparing the levels of H3K9me2, H3K36me2, and H3K4me3 in FLC clade gene chromatin between wild-type and hub1-4 (a representative hub mutant) or ubc1 ubc2 plants. There was no obvious difference between the wild-type and hub1 or ubc1 ubc2 plants in terms of their H3K9me2 levels in the chromatin of FLC clade genes (Figures 9B and 9H). However, the H3K4me3 level was reduced in the gene body region of FLC chromatin, whereas no obvious reduction was detected in the promoter region in the hub1 single or ubc1 ubc2 double mutants (Figures 9B and 9C). The H3K4me3 level was reduced in the chromatin of MAF1, MAF4, and MAF5 in the hub1 single and ubc1 ubc2 double mutants as well (Figures 9B and 9D). The level of H3K4me3 in the chromatin of MAF2 and MAF3 was much higher than that in the chromatin of FLC, MAF4, or MAF5 (Figure 9E); moreover, there was no obvious change in the H3K4me3 level in the chromatin of MAF2 and MAF3 between wild-type and hub1 or ubc1 ubc2 plants (Figures 9B and 9D). Similarly, no obvious change in the level of H3K4me3 in the chromatin of ACTIN was found between wild-type and hub1 or ubc1 ubc2 plants (Figures 8G and 9B). In terms of H3K36me2, the modification pattern in FLC chromatin was similar to that for H3K4me3 in wild-type plants (Figure 9F), and a similar change in the H3K4me3 modification pattern was observed in the chromatin of FLC clade genes between wild-type and hub1 or ubc1 ubc2 plants (Figures 9B and 9G). There was no obvious change in the level of H3K36me2 in the chromatin of ACTIN between wild-type and hub1 or ubc1 ubc2 plants (Figures 8G and 9B). These results indicate that the UBC1,2/HUB1,2 pathway is involved in the regulation of H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels and that H2Bub1 is required for the enhancement of H3K4 and H3K36 hypermethylation in the chromatin of FLC and some other FLC clade genes. The above results suggested that the UBC1,2/HUB1,2 pathway regulates H2Bub1 to mediate flowering time in Arabidopsis. It was previously shown that E2 and E3 involved in H2Bub1 work together with the PAF1 complex in the same pathway in yeast and animals (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). It was also reported that defects in Arabidopsis homologs of the components of the PAF1 complex, such as EARLY FLOWERING7 (ELF7), ELF8, and VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE4, led to early flowering (CITATION; CITATION). We therefore examined whether UBC1,2/HUB1,2 and the PAF1 complex function in the same pathway in Arabidopsis by characterizing the phenotype of hub and elf7 single and double mutants. The hub1 or hub2 and elf7 single mutants exhibited an early flowering phenotype, while their double mutants exhibited a similar but slightly stronger early flowering phenotype (Figure 10 ). Moreover, the elf7 mutants exhibited a stronger phenotype during leaf and flower organ development than the hub1 or hub2 mutants (Figure 10; CITATION), suggesting that the function of UBC1,2/HUB1,2 and the PAF1 complex is synergistic, and indicating the action of no identical mechanisms during Arabidopsis development. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! All of the Arabidopsis thaliana alleles used in this study were in a Columbia background. Seeds of hub1-5, hub1-4, and hub2-2, corresponding to SALK_044415, SALK_122512, and SALK_071289, seeds of ubc1-1, ubc2-1, and ubc3-1, corresponding to SALK_109196, SALK_060994, and SALK_045233, and seeds of elf7-3, corresponding to SALK_019433, were obtained from the ABRC. All T-DNA insertions were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. For the mutant complementation assay, native promoter-driven HUB1 (2000 bp upstream of ATG; see Supplemental Table 3 online), HUB2 (2000 bp upstream of ATG; see Supplemental Table 3 online) CDS, UBC1 (2458 bp upstream ATG + gene body + 1059 bp downstream TAG; see Supplemental Table 3 online), or UBC2 (2553 bp upstream ATG + gene body + 1439 bp downstream TAG; see Supplemental Table 3 online) genomic DNA was transformed into hub1 or hub2 single or ubc1 ubc2 double mutant plants by the floral dip method using Agrobacterium tumefaciens (CITATION). The seeds of the transformants were sterilized with 2.25% bleach, washed with sterilized water, kept at 4°C for 3 d, and then germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 1% sucrose. After 8 d of growth under continuous white light (160 μmol m−2 s−1), the plants were transplanted to soil and grown under long-day (16 h of light [22°C]/8 h of dark [18°C]) or short-day (8 h of light [22°C]/16 h of dark [18°C]) conditions at 65% relative humidity. Total RNA was isolated from the SAMs of 7-d-old wild-type or mutant seedlings using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega) to degrade any remaining DNA. A total of 3 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using an oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was subsequently performed to quantify the cDNA using TaKaRa SYBR Premix Ex Taq in a 7500 real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). ACTIN was included as an internal control, and the level of other housekeeping genes, such as TUBULIN, eEF-1, and GAPDH, among the wild type and mutants were also detected. The primers used for real-time PCR are provided in Supplemental Table 1 online. ChIP was performed as described by CITATION using 7-d-old seedlings, which were grown on Murashige and Skoog medium under continuous white light. Anti-H3K9me2, anti-H3K4me3, and anti-H3k36me2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-H2Bub1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Médimabs. As the H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels in ACTIN chromatin and the H3K9me2 level in TA3 chromatin were similar among the hub1, hub2, ubc1 ubc2, and wild-type plants, we used ACTIN as internal controls for the H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels and TA3 for the H3K9me2 level, respectively. The primers used for PCR and quantitative real-time PCR are provided in Supplemental Table 2 online. The ∼2-kb promoter of HUB1 (2000 bp upstream of ATG; see Supplemental Table 3 online), HUB2 (2000 bp upstream of ATG; see Supplemental Table 3 online), or UBCs (2007, 1997, and 2069 bp upstream of ATG for UBC1, 2, and 3, respectively; see Supplemental Table 3 online) was fused with GUS and transformed into wild-type plants, and T2 lines were subjected to histochemical analysis. GUS staining was performed as described by CITATION and CITATION; the samples were cleared as described by CITATION. To analyze the expression pattern of HUB1, HUB2, UBC1, UBC2, and UBC3 in the SAM, 10 plants each from 10 independent T2 lines were selected for each gene. The level of GUS activity was then assessed by staining as described above, and the seedlings with GUS staining were embedded in Paraplast Plus. Each seedling was then sectioned every 8 μm and observed under a Zeiss light microscope as described by CITATION. Protoplasts were isolated from 3- or 4-week-old Arabidopsis leaves grown under 12 h of light/12 h of dark as described by CITATION. To generate BiFC constructs, full-length HUB1 and HUB2 CDS were obtained by RT-PCR and cloned into pSY735 and pSY736, respectively. The primers used for amplification of full-length HUB1 and HUB2 CDS were as follows: HUB1 forward 5′-ACGCGTCGACAATGGCGAGCACAGGCGAGCCTGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCGGATCCTCATATGTAGATAGGTTTAATAT-3′; HUB2 forward 5′-ACGCGTCGACAATGGAGAATCAGGAATCGGACGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATTTTGACAAGCCGGACGTC-3′. All BiFC plasmids were purified by density gradient centrifugation. The test constructs were then cotransformed into the protoplasts using the polyethylene glycol transformation method (CITATION; CITATION). YFP fluorescence in the transformed protoplasts was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss) after 20 to 24 h of incubation in the dark. Roughly 26 to 28% of the protoplasts cotransformed with pSY735-HUB1 or HUB2 and pSY736-HUB1 or HUB2 exhibited YFP fluorescence, whereas YFP fluorescence was observed in <2 to 3% of the negative controls. FLAG-H2B (At3g45980) driven by the H2B native promoter was transformed into wild-type and hub1, hub2, or ubc plants as indicated in Figure 6. T2 seedlings were then used for detection of the H2Bub1 level, and total protein was extracted using plant extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, plus 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail). The proteins were then separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for blotting with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich); tubulin, detected by antitubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich), was used as a loading control. The bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham). For the confirmation of H2Bub1 using antiubiquitin antibodies, 10-d-old T2 transgenic seedlings, produced by the transformation of FLAG-H2B or FLAG-H2BK146A into wild-type plants, were used. Ten grams of plant material were ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder then mixed with 8 mL of IP buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, plus 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh cold tube, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and mixed overnight with 100 μL of anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) on a rotator at 4°C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation at 800g for 30 s, washed three times with cooled IP buffer, collected by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 2 min at 4°C, and eluted with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without β-ME or DTT). The protein samples were then probed with anti-FLAG and antiubiquitin antibodies (Abcam), respectively. For the detection of global-scale H3 modification and H2Bub1 level among wild-type and mutant plants, protein extracted from 7-d-old seedlings following the chromatin extraction and sonication of the ChIP protocol, chromation solution were diluted with 2× loading buffer and denatured at 100°C for 10 min and then the samples were probed with anti-H3K4me1, anti-H3K4me2, anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K36me2, anti-H3K9me2 antibodies (all from Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-H2Bub1 antibody (Médimabs), respectively. The yeast strains used in this study were kindly provided by Hiter D. Madhani (University of California, San Francisco). YM1740 corresponds to bre1Δ in a YM1736 (S288C) background. Yeast complementation plasmids (BRE1-HUB1 and BRE1-HUB2) were generated from pADH 1-BRE1 (CITATION). The pADH 1 promoter, which is the promoter of alcohol dehydrogenase 1, was replaced by the native promoter of yeast BRE1, while BRE1 was replaced by its Arabidopsis homolog, HUB1 or HUB2. Cell size was determined as described previously (CITATION). All of the genes tested were cloned into two vectors (pGADT7 and pGBKT7) and cotransformed into yeast strain AH109. Transformation, yeast growth, and β-galactosidase quantitative assays were performed as described in the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. The amino acid sequences of the open reading frames were initially aligned using the program ClustalX 2.0 with the following parameter value: gap opening = 10, gap extension = 0.2, delay divergent sequences% = 30, protein weight matrix: gonnet series. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method in Phylip3.6 and opened with TreeView 1.6. Numbers at nodes indicate the bootstrap value obtained for 1500 replicates. Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GenBank/EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: HUB1 (At2g44950), HUB2 (At1g55250 and At1g55255), UBC1 (At1g14400), UBC2 (At2g02760), UBC3 At5g62540), H2B (At3g45980, At1g07790), ACTIN (At5g09810), TUBLIN (At1g64740), TA3 (At1g37110), eEF-1 (At5g60390), GAPDH (At1g42970), FLC (At5g10140), MAF1 (At1g77080), MAF2 (At5g65050), MAF3 (At5g65060), MAF4 (At5g65070), and MAF5 (At5g65080).
