!~ABS~! Chloroplasts of higher plants contain a unique signal recognition particle (cpSRP) that consists of two proteins, cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. CpSRP43 is composed of a four ankyrin repeat domain and three functionally distinct chromodomains (CDs). In this report we confirm previously published data that the second chromodomain (CD2) provides the primary binding site for cpSRP54. However, quantitative binding analysis demonstrates that cpSRP54 binds to CD2 significantly less efficiently than it binds to full-length cpSRP43. Further analysis of the binding interface of cpSRP by mutagenesis studies and a pepscan approach demonstrates that the C-terminal α-helix of CD2 facilitates binding to cpSRP54.
!~RES~! Recently, several studies were performed to define the molecular details of the interaction between cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. Results obtained mainly from yeast two-hybrid experiments suggested that both C-terminal chromodomains (CD2/3) are essential for the interaction with cpSRP54 by providing the binding interface for cpSRP54 CITATION. However, these experiments and in vitro binding experiments indicated that the interaction between cpSRP54 and CD2/3 was significantly weaker than the interaction when full-length cpSRP43 was used. Data from other groups confirmed the finding that the C-terminal region of cpSRP43 mediates the binding to cpSRP54 CITATION. However, results from in vitro binding assays and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that only CD2 is involved in binding to cpSRP54 CITATION. In addition, data obtained from quantitative pulldown experiments using recombinant GST-cpSRP43 constructs indicated that CD2 alone binds cpSRP54 as efficiently as full-length cpSRP43 CITATION. To analyse the binding and dissociation kinetics between full-length cpSRP43 or various cpSRP43 constructs and cpSRP54 quantitatively, SPR technology was utilized. For interaction analysis, GST-cpSRP43, the indicated GST-cpSRP43 constructs or GST as control were immobilized on a sensor chip of a BIAcore3000™ instrument via covalently bound anti-GST antibodies. Various concentrations of recombinant cpSRP54M-his were passed over the decorated chip and the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) were calculated from the association and dissociation rates (CITATION ). The K D value for the binding of full-length cpSRP43 and cpSRP54M was estimated to be ∼2.5nM, reflecting the high affinity of this interaction. A specific but significantly weaker binding of cpSRP54M to cpSRP43(255–376), encoding CD2/3 and containing 15 additional N-terminal residues, was observed (K D: 29.7nM). It should be noted that no quantifiable interaction of the same construct lacking this N-terminal extension and cpSRP54M was detected (data not shown). A K D value in the same range as that for cpSRP43(255–376) was detected for a construct that encodes the fourth ankyrin repeat in addition to CD2/3 (cpSRP43(227–376)). Removal of CD3 did not result in a significant reduction in binding affinity indicating that it is not required for the formation of the cpSRP54 binding site (CITATION). Taken together, our data support the previously published data of Goforth et al. CITATION and Sivaraja et al. CITATION, that state that CD2 alone provides the primary binding site for cpSRP54. However, the K D value for this interaction with cpSRP54M was significantly higher than for full-length cpSRP43, suggesting that additional regions of cpSRP43 are required to support the high affinity cpSRP complex formation. Nevertheless, further studies using full-length proteins are necessary to support this notion and to rule out structural alterations that might occur using deletion constructs. Previously it was reported that a highly positively charged segment in cpSRP54 (residues 530–539) constitutes the cpSRP43 binding site CITATION. It was demonstrated by mutational analysis that arginine at position 537 is essential for binding cpSRP43 and that mutation of arginine 536 drastically reduces this interaction. Interestingly, analysis of the surface charge distribution of the CDs of cpSRP43 revealed that the electrostatic potential of CD2 is highly negative, whereas those of CD1 and CD3 are nearly zero or even positive CITATION. These findings led to the speculation that electrostatic forces might drive the interaction of cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. To test this assumption we systematically converted all acidic residues within CD2 (location shown in CITATION) into neutral residues by site-directed mutagenesis and analysed the effect of these mutations on binding to cpSRP54M using the yeast two-hybrid system. In CITATION , it is shown that the generation of the double mutation E310M/D311A in cpSRP43 led to a complete loss of binding to cpSRP54M, whereas all other tested mutations were ineffective. The finding that the construct cpSRP43(E310M,D311A) is not able to interact with cpSRP54 was proven by two experimental setups. In our first approach, we verified by in vitro pulldown experiments using GST-cpSRP43 or GST-cpSRP43(E310M,D311A) that the mutation prevented binding to cpSRP54M (CITATION ). In our second approach, the transit complex formation with LHCP was assayed. The transit complex consists of cpSRP and LHCP and represents a soluble form of LHCP. In previous experiments, it was shown that both subunits, cpSRP43 and cpSRP54, must be present to form a functional cpSRP, and are required to bind LHCP CITATION. CITATION shows that the transit complex is not generated in the presence of cpSRP43(E310M,D311A), proving the critical role of E310 and D311 for the constitution of functional cpSRP. To analyse whether residues E310 and D311 are located in a segment of cpSRP43 that mediates direct binding to cpSRP54, or whether their mutation has structural consequences, we mapped the interaction of CD2 with cpSRP54M using an immobilized peptide library of CD2 (15-mer peptides overlapping by 12 residues). The pepscan membrane was incubated with recombinant cpSRP54M-his, and binding of cpSRP54M-his was detected by immunodecoration with anti-cpSRP54 antibodies. As a control, the same experiment was performed with recombinant cpSRP54M(Δ536–540)-his, a construct whose mutation within the cpSRP43-binding site abolishes binding to cpSRP43 CITATION. As shown in CITATION , cpSRP54M interacts strongly with a single peptide comprising residues 307–321. A weak signal was detected for the peptide representing residues 280–294. The control experiment using cpSRP54M(Δ536–540)-his generated no interaction signal. Interestingly, analysis of the NMR-structure of CD2 revealed that the peptide 307-HVAEDVAKDYEDGLE-321 corresponds almost exactly to the α-helix of CD2 (residues 309–321). From these data and from the mutational analysis, we concluded that the negatively charged C-terminal α-helix of CD2 forms the minimal binding site for cpSRP54 and that the region comprising residues 280–294 might contribute to the overall binding. This result is in line with our previously published observation that a cpSRP43 construct lacking the α-helix of CD2 (cpSRP43(61–305)) is not able to bind cpSRP54 CITATION. Likewise, it was observed that a CD2 chimera wherein the α-helix was replaced with that of CD3 could not interact with cpSRP54 CITATION. In an attempt to analyse whether the presence of the α-helix of CD2 in a CD is sufficient to enable binding to cpSRP54 we generated a chimeric construct consisting of the β-sheet containing N-terminal region of CD3 and the α-helix of CD2 and tested the interaction with cpSRP54M. However, we did not detect interaction between this construct and cpSRP54M (data not shown). These data suggest that both, the C-terminal α-helix of CD2 and the right orientation within the CD, are essential for cpSRP complex formation. In cpSRP54, the residues R536 and R537 were described to be important for interaction with cpSRP43 CITATION. Besides carrying a positive charge, arginine side chains are also partially hydrophobic (part of the side chain nearest to the protein main chain), and are often described to be buried within a hydrophobic core of a protein CITATION. To analyse whether hydrophobic residues within or close to the C-terminal α-helix of CD2 are crucial for interaction with cpSRP54, we mutated them individually and tested the interaction with cpSRP54M. In CITATION , it is shown that the substitution of V308 and V312 with glycine (V308G, V312G) led to a loss of interaction with cpSRP54M, whereas the introduction of the hydrophobic amino acid methionine at these positions (V308M, V312M) and the mutations V306G and L320G did not impair binding to cpSRP54M. These data indicate that hydrophobic residues at positions 308 and 312 of CD2 are required for interaction with cpSRP54. In addition, we observed no binding between the construct cpSRP43(A309M) and cpSRP54M (CITATION and see also CITATION). Since this mutation does not alter in particular the hydrophobicity, this observation suggests that a small residue might be required at this position. Noticeably, all residues whose mutations abolish cpSRP54 binding are clustered close to the N-terminus of the C-terminal helix (V308, A309, E310, D311, V312). This finding and the observation that, in contrast to peptide 307–321, almost no binding of cpSRP54M to peptide 310–324 was detected (CITATION, spot 20), leads to the hypothesis that the N-terminal region of the helix might be the primary contact site for cpSRP54. In addition, our data suggest that the negative charge and the hydrophobic character of this region are required for interaction with cpSRP54M. However, currently it cannot be excluded that the introduced mutations led to conformational changes in this region and further work is required to get a detailed picture of the mechanisms underlying the cpSRP complex formation.
!~MM~! The cDNAs encoding cpSRP43(255–376), cpSRP43(227–376) and cpSRP43(227–320) were amplified from full-length cpSRP43-cDNA using gene specific primers with unique restriction sites (BamHI/XhoI). The corresponding cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of the expression vector pGEX-4T-3. All of the site-directed mutagenesis constructs were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The plasmids pACT2-cpSRP43 or pGex-4T-3-cpSRP43 were used as templates to gain the single or double point mutation constructs for yeast two-hybrid experiments or the constructs encoding mutated GST-cpSRP43, respectively. The correct sequence of the constructs was verified by sequencing (Seqlab). All other plasmids used in this study have been described previously and are listed as follows: GST-cpSRP43 expression vector (pGex4Tchaos(m) CITATION, cpSRP54M-his and cpSRP54M(Δ536–540)-his expression vector (constructs cloned in pET29b) CITATION, yeast two-hybrid vectors pACT2-43 and pGBKT7-54M CITATION, cpSRP54M and Lhcb1 translation vectors (pGem4SS6.5-54M and pAB80) CITATION. Recombinant cpSRP54M-his or cpSRP54M(Δ536–540)-his were expressed from their corresponding pET29b(+) constructs in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen) and purified under native conditions as described previously CITATION. Recombinant GST-cpSRP43 constructs were expressed from their corresponding pGex-4T-3 constructs in the strain BL21 and purified as described CITATION. For SPR experiments, the purified proteins were dialyzed against 10mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5mM MgCl2, and 150mM NaCl (BIAcore buffer) by using dialysis cassettes (Perbio) according to the manufacturer’s manual. The dialyzed protein solution was concentrated by spinning it in Vivaspin-columns at 4°C and 3000×g. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. SPR experiments were carried out using the BIAcore 3000 system equipped with a CM5 sensor chip covered with covalently bound anti-GST antibodies. Experiments were carried out in 10mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5mM MgCl2, 150mM NaCl and 0.005% Igepal. The GSTcpSRP43 constructs or GST as a control were immobilized on the sensor chip and recombinant cpSRP54M-his was passed over the decorated chip in at least six various concentrations (cpSRP43: 20–200nM 54M; 43(255–376): 40–400nM 54M; 43(227–376) and 43(227–320): 0.01–1μM 54M). Data analysis was performed with Biaevaluation™ Software 3.0 as described before CITATION. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as described CITATION. Pulldown assays were performed as described CITATION, using 4μl in vitro translated, 35S-methionine labelled cpSRP54M and 1μg of the indicated recombinant GST-cpSRP43 constructs. As a control recombinant GST (1.5μg) was used.
