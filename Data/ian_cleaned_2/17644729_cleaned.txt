!~ABS~! Epidermis cell differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana is a model system for understanding the developmental end state of plant cells. Two types of MYB transcription factors, R2R3-MYB and R3-MYB, are involved in cell fate determination. To examine the molecular basis of this process, we analyzed the functional relationship of the R2R3-type MYB gene WEREWOLF (WER) and the R3-type MYB gene CAPRICE (CPC). Chimeric constructs made from the R3 MYB regions of WER and CPC used in reciprocal complementation experiments showed that the CPC R3 region cannot functionally substitute for the WER R3 region in the differentiation of hairless cells. However, WER R3 can substantially substitute for CPC R3. There are no differences in yeast interaction assays of WER or WER chimera proteins with GLABRA3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3). CPC and CPC chimera proteins also have similar activity in preventing GL3 WER and EGL3 WER interactions. Furthermore, we showed by gel mobility shift assays that WER chimera proteins do not bind to the GL2 promoter region. However, a CPC chimera protein, which harbors the WER R3 motif, still binds to the GL2 promoter region.
!~RES~! The WER gene encodes a MYB protein containing R2 and R3 repeats. The CPC gene encodes a single R3 MYB repeat protein that shares 54% sequence identity with the R3 motif of WER (Figure 1A ). The R3 motif, like c-MYB, is composed of three helices (h1, h2, and h3) (Figures 1A and 1B; CITATION). A comparison of each helix of WER R3 and CPC R3 indicated that h1 and h2 are similar, but h3 is considerably different. WER R3 h3 is mainly composed of neutral polar residues, whereas the CPC R3 h3 is mainly composed of nonpolar and acidic residues (Figure 1B). [[FIGURE]] To provide a framework for examining WER and CPC evolution, we estimated the phylogeny of R2R3- and R3-type Myb proteins based on R3 amino acid sequences (Figure 2B ). MYB36, MYB37, MYB38, MYB68, MYB84, and MYB87 belong to another R2R3-type Myb clade (CITATION). PAP1 and PAP2 form a side branch of the CPC/WER cluster and are known to interact with bHLH proteins (CITATION). The neighbor-joining tree of just the R3 Myb regions (Figure 2A) yields a similar clustering to a tree constructed from the complete sequences (CITATION; CITATION). This neighbor-joining tree of R3 Myb sequences has four distinct branches consisting of the MYB68 (MYB36, MYB37, MYB38, MYB68, MYB84, and MYB87), WER (GL1, WER, and MYB23), PAP (PAP1 and PAP2), and CPC (CPC, TRY, ETC1, ETC2, and At4g10160) subgroups (Figure 2A). The WER subgroup and CPC subgroup branches are statistically supported by having bootstrap values in excess of 90%. Branching of the WER and CPC clusters from a common trunk suggests that the evolution of R3 in WER and CPC began with duplication of a single common ancestor (Figure 2A). [[FIGURE]] In the wer mutant, most of the root epidermal cells differentiate into root hairs (CITATION). By contrast, the cpc mutant has a reduced number of root hairs (CITATION). To investigate the functional differences between the R3 motifs of CPC and WER, seven WER:WER-CPC chimera constructs under control of the WER promoter (WER:WC1-WER:WC7) were introduced into the wer mutant to test their ability to complement the wer root hair phenotype (Figure 3 ). At least four individual homozygous T3 lines were analyzed for each construct (see Supplemental Figure 3B online), among which three typical lines were chosen for root hair assays (Table 1 ). Only two transgenic lines, WER:WER and WER:WC2, complemented the wer mutant phenotype (Figures 3A and 3C, Table 1), indicating that only the WC2 chimera protein retains the biochemical activity of WER protein. The WER:WC7 construct, which harbors S26E and K30G substitutions in the WER R3 region, does not rescue the wer mutant phenotype (Figures 3A and 3C, Table 1), demonstrating that as few as two amino acid changes are sufficient to disrupt WER function (Figure 3A). [[FIGURE]] Root Hair Numbers of WER:WER-CPC Chimeras in wer Transgenic Arabidopsis Lines To determine whether wer complementation (Figures 3A and 3C, Table 1) was due to the epistatic effects of the WER chimeras on GL2 promoter activity, we introduced GL2:β-glucuronidase (GUS) into these transgenic lines (Figure 4 ). In a wild-type background, the GL2 promoter drove GUS expression within differentiating root epidermal cells located in the hairless cell file position (Figure 4A; CITATION). This position-dependent GL2:GUS expression was abolished in the wer mutant (Figure 4B; CITATION). GL2:GUS was expressed in WER:WER-complemented wer mutant lines about the same as the wild type but was somewhat higher in WER:WC2-complemented wer lines under these experimental conditions (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4E). By contrast, GL2:GUS was not expressed in WER:WC1-, WER:WC3-, WER:WC4-, WER:WC5-, WER:WC6-, or WER:WC7-complemented wer background lines, which also did not complement the wer mutant phenotype (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4F to 4J). These results indicate that positive regulation of GL2 in hairless cells is limited to WER:WER- and WER:WC2-complemented wer lines. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether WER R3 could substitute for CPC R3, we exchanged CPC:CPC with the corresponding WER R3 regions (CPC:CW1-CPC:CW5) (Figure 5A ). These chimeric constructs were introduced into a cpc-2 mutant under the control of the CPC promoter. For each construct, at least five individual T2 lines were analyzed (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Typical lines were chosen and root hairs assayed (Table 2 ). CPC:CPC complemented the cpc-2 mutant (Columbia-0 [Col-0] background) phenotype (Figures 5A and 5C, Table 2) just as in cpc-1 (Wassilewskija background) (CITATION). All of the chimeric constructs rescued the reduced-hair cpc-2 phenotype, though the degree of rescue differed. CPC:CPC in the cpc background had an increased number of root hairs compared with the wild-type background. CPC:CW1 and CPC:CW2 in cpc restored the number of root hairs to wild-type levels. CPC:CW3 and CPC:CW4 in cpc transformants had somewhat fewer than the wild type. The number of root hairs in the CPC:CW5 cpc transformant was the least (Figure 5C, Table 2). These results suggest that although the entire R3 structure is required for strong function, CPC can act without strict structural conservation of the R3 domain (Figures 5A and 5C, Table 2). [[FIGURE]] Root Hair Numbers of CPC:CPC-WER Chimeras in cpc-2 Transgenic Arabidopsis Lines GL2:GUS expression is normally limited to hairless cell files (Figure 6A ; CITATION). The GL2:GUS gene is expressed in almost all epidermal cells of the cpc mutant but was not expressed in 35S:CPC transgenic plants (Figure 6B; CITATION; CITATION). To define the effect of CPC:CPC-WER chimeras on GL2 expression, we introduced GL2:GUS into CPC:CPC-WER chimera transgenic lines with a cpc background (Figures 6C to 6H). As described above, all five chimeric constructs (CPC:CW1-CPC:CW5) rescued the cpc mutant phenotype (Figures 5A and 5C, Table 2). Like 35S:CPC-complemented cpc transformants, no appreciable GL2:GUS expression was observed in any of these transgenic lines when roots were incubated in X-Gluc solution at 37°C for 3.5 h (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). With the exception of the CPC:CPC-complemented cpc transgenic line, which had no discernable expression (Figure 6C), after incubation overnight they exhibited weak wild-type-like GUS activity in the hairless cell file position (Figures 6D to 6H). The strength of GL2:GUS activity in these transgenic lines was directly correlated with the degree of complementation provided by the chimera construct. The CPC:CPC construct in the cpc background produces a greater number of root hairs than the wild type. CPC:CW1- and CPC:CW2-complemented cpc transgenic lines have almost the same number of root hairs as the wild type, and CPC:CW3-, CPC:CW4-, and CPC:CW5-complemented cpc transgenic lines produce lower numbers of root hairs than the wild type (Figures 5A, 5C, and 6C to 6H, Table 2). These results strongly suggest that each of the CPC chimera proteins has the ability to inhibit GL2 expression. [[FIGURE]] WER protein physically interacts with either of the GL3 or EGL3 proteins in yeast cells (CITATION). To examine the possibility that the WER chimera proteins physically associate with GL3 or EGL3, we employed the yeast two-hybrid assay (CITATION). The Myb regions of the WER, WC1, and WC7 constructs were fused to the binding domain (BD) of GAL4, and GL3 or EGL3 was fused to the activation domain (AD) of GAL4. Yeast containing either empty pBridge (BD) or pGAD424 vectors in conjunction with any of the corresponding protein fusions did not exhibit significant β-gal activity, whereas yeast containing WER-BD, WC1-BD or WC7-BD, and GL3-AD or EGL3-AD exhibited β-gal activity (Figure 7A ). There were no significant differences in β-gal activity among yeast isolates containing WER-BD GL3-AD, WC1-BD GL3-AD, or WC7-BD GL3-AD (Figure 7A). Although EGL3-AD exhibited one-sixth the level of binding activity as GL3-AD (Figure 7A; CITATION), yeast isolates containing each of the EGL3 fusions had approximately equal β-gal activities (Figure 7A). Thus, WER-BD, WC1-BD, and WC7-BD interacted equally well with either GL3-AD or EGL3-AD (Figure 7A). [[FIGURE]] As presented in a previous model, TRY and GL1 compete for a GL3 protein binding site to form different types of complexes that are involved in Arabidopsis trichome development (CITATION). TRY also prevents the interaction between GL1 and GL3 (CITATION). CPC protein has also been found to physically interact with both GL3 and EGL3 in yeast cells (CITATION), suggesting a competition model for CPC and WER (CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether CPC and the CPC chimera proteins compete with WER for a binding site on GL3 or EGL3 equally, CPC, CW1, and CW5 were cloned into the free site of the WER-BD constructs to form the WER-BD/CPC-free, WER-BD/CW1-free, and WER-BD/CW5-free constructs for the yeast three-hybrid assay. Under conditions of low Met concentrations, in which CPC-free, CW1-free, and CW5-free expression would be at maximum levels, yeast containing GL3-AD or EGL3-AD and WER-BD/CPC-free, WER-BD/CW1-free, or WER-BD/CW5-free had decreased β-gal activity (Figure 7B). As the concentration of Met was increased, which should depress CPC-free, CW1-free, and CW5-free expression, the levels of β-gal activity increased (Figure 7B). Although GL3-AD had a higher level of binding activity to WER than EGL3-AD (Figure 7A) (CITATION), free CPC, CW1, and CW5 showed the same inhibitory levels on WER-BD and GL3-AD or EGL3-AD interactions (Figure 7B). Although a decrease in Met concentration decreased β-gal activity in the GL3-AD and WER-BD binding assay, there was essentially no reduction of β-gal activity as shown in the GL3-AD WER-BD/CPC-free three-hybrid assay (Figure 7B; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The GL2 promoter has a putative MYB binding site, which is required for expression in trichome cells and root hairless cells (CITATION; CITATION). Previously, it has been shown by gel mobility shift experiments that WER binds to the GL2 MYB binding site (GL2MBS1 [GACTAACGGTAAG]) (CITATION). We used a gel mobility shift assay to determine whether the WER chimeric proteins bind to this site or not. When the WER protein was added, a band shift was observed and free probe decreased (Figure 8A , lane 2; CITATION). However, neither WC1 nor WC7 chimera proteins caused any significant gel shift or decrease in free probe (Figure 8A, lanes 4 and 6). These results indicate that WER chimera proteins WC1 and WC7 do not bind to the Myb binding site (GL2MBS1) of the GL2 promoter (Figure 8A), although they can bind to GL3/EGL3 proteins (Figure 7A). [[FIGURE]] We also used a gel mobility shift assay to determine whether the CW5 chimera protein, which gives complementation but contains the WER R3 domain (Figure 5A), binds to the GL2 MYB binding site. Intact CPC protein did not cause any significant gel shift or decrease in free probe (Figure 8B, lane 2). However, when CW5 protein was added, a band shift was observed and free probe decreased (Figure 8B, lane 4). These results indicate that CW5 chimera protein binds to the Myb binding site of the GL2 promoter.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 ecotype and cognate cpc-2 and wer-1 mutant plants were used. Seeds were sterilized with 10% (v/v) bleach with 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min. After seeds were rinsed five times in sterile water, seeds were germinated and grown on square Petri dishes containing half-strength Okada and Shimura medium [2.5 mM KNO3, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 25 μM Fe-EDTA, 1.25 mM K-PO4, pH 5.5, 35 μM H3BO3, 7 μM MnCl2, 0.25 μM CuSO4, 0.5 μM ZnSO4, 0.1 μM NaMo4, 5 μM NaCl, and 0.05 μM CoCl2] (CITATION) with 1.5% (w/v) agar. After sowing, dishes were wrapped with Micropore surgical tape (3M Healthcare) to prevent desiccation. The dishes were then kept in darkness at 4°C for 2 d and then transferred to a growth chamber at 22°C under constant white light (white fluorescent lamp model FL20S-EXNH; Toshiba). All primer sequences used in this article are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. To define the relationship between the R3 motifs of WER and CPC, based on published data (CITATION), we first tested a construct harboring WER. This construct (designated WER:WER; Figure 3A, Table 1) was introduced into the wer mutant background. To make the WER:WER chimera constructs, we used a 6.1-kb PCR-amplified WER:WER genome fragment that includes the 4.0-kb 5′ region, the 1.0-kb coding region, and the 1.1-kb 3′ region as well as pBS-gCPC, including the 1.3-kb 5′ region, the 0.9-kb coding region, and the 0.45-kb 3′ region (CITATION) as amplification templates. The WER:WER region, amplified using primers RT11/RT12, and the CPC region, amplified using primers TW1149/TW1150, were ligated (WER:WC1). The WER:WER region was amplified using primers RT32/RT34, the WER:WC1 fragment was amplified using primers RT37/RT11, and the products were ligated to form WER:WC2. The WER:WER region, amplified with primers RT33/RT35, and the WER:WC1 fragment, amplified with primers RT36/RT12, were ligated to make WER:WC3. The WER:WER fragment was amplified with primers RT101/RT102 and was self-ligated to form WER:WC4. The WER:WER region, amplified with primers RT103/RT12, and the CPC region, amplified by primers RT104/TW1150, were ligated to make WER:WC5. The WER:WER fragment amplified with primers WERCPC6-1/WERCPC6-2 was also self-ligated to form WER:WC6. To create WER:WC7, PCR-mediated mutagenesis was performed on WER:WER using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with the primers WERCPC7-1/WERCPC7-2. PCR-generated constructs were completely sequenced following isolation of the clones to check for amplification-induced errors. Finally, the amplified and ligated constructs were cloned into the transformation vector pJHA212K (CITATION). To create CPC:CPC-WER chimera constructs (Figure 5A), we used pBS-gCPC and pBS-WER as templates. The CPC:CPC region, amplified by primers CPCWER-a-1/CPCWER-a-2, and the WER region, amplified by primer pair CPCWER-a-3/CPCWER-a-4, were ligated to form CPC:CW1. The CPC:CW1 fragment, amplified by primers CPCWER-b-1/CPCWER-b-2, was self-ligated to make CPC:CW2, which was then amplified using primers CPCWER-c-1/CPCWER-c-2 and self-ligated to form CPC:CW3. The CPC:CW3 fragment, amplified with primers CPCWER-d-1/CPCWER-d-2, was self-ligated to create CPC:CW4. The WER region, amplified with primer pair RT32/RT35, and the CPC:CPC region, amplified with the primer pair NEKO16/RT86, were ligated to make CPC:CW5. PCR-generated constructs were completely sequenced following isolation of the clones to check for amplification-induced errors. These amplified and ligated constructs were also cloned into the transformation vector pJHA212K (CITATION). Plant transformation was performed by a vacuum transformation procedure (CITATION) or floral dip method (CITATION), and transformants were selected on a 0.5× Murashige and Skoog agar plate containing 50 mg−1 kanamycin. Homozygous transgenic lines were selected by kanamycin resistance. For CPC:CPC-WER and WER:WER-CPC chimera constructs, we isolated at least 24 T1 lines for each construct and selected at least five T2 and T3 lines on the basis of their segregation ratios for kanamycin resistance (see Supplemental Figures 4 and 5 online). For each transgenic line, at least 10 individual 5-d-old seedlings were assayed for root hair numbers. Some outliers were eliminated from the data because of the possibility that positional or other aberrant effects would distort the data. However, outliers may be examined in the future and may provide additional clarification of the data. A GL2:GUS construct (CITATION) was introduced into transgenic lines by crossing plants and analyzing F2 seedlings for GL2:GUS by PCR (GUS+00+/GUS+09-). For each transgenic line, at least ten individual seedlings were assayed for GUS activity. Primary roots of 5-d-old transgenic seedlings were excised and immersed in X-Gluc solution containing 1.0 mM X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronide), 1.0 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 1.0 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 100 mM NaPi, pH 7.0, 100 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Excised primary roots were incubated at 37°C for 3.5 h or overnight. For observation of the root hairs, root images were obtained with a three-dimensional digital fine microscope (VC4500-PC; Omron) or with a digital microscope (VH-8000; Keyence). For each transgenic line, at least 10 individual 5-d-old seedlings were analyzed for root hair number and root GUS activity. pGL3-AD and pEGL3-AD were constructed by cloning GL3 and EGL3 coding regions from Col-0 cDNA into pGAD424 (Clontech). pWER-BD, pWC1-BD, and pWC7-BD were constructed by cloning WER, WC1, and WC7 coding regions from Col-0, WER:WC1 transformants, or WER:WC7 transformants, respectively, into pBridge MCSI (Clontech). The constructs used for WER-CPC, -CW1, or -CW5 competition assays, pWER-BD/CPC-free, pWER-BD/CW1-free, or pWER-BD/CW5-free, were generated by cloning CPC, CW1, or CW5 coding regions into pBridge MCSII (Clontech). The appropriate pGAD424- and pBridge-based constructs were transformed into the yeast strain Y187 using the Yeastmaker 2 transformation system (Clontech). Cells were selected on plates containing SD synthetic medium (2% glucose and 1× yeast nitrogen base) lacking Leu and Trp. Liquid cultures of SD synthetic medium lacking Leu and Trp were used to measure β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity (CITATION). Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.7 to 1.0, pelleted by centrifugation, and suspended in z-buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). Cells were permeabilized by adding a final concentration of 0.005% SDS and 3.5% (v/v) chloroform. o-nitrophenyl-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a substrate. After incubation at 30°C, the reaction was stopped with sodium carbonate and measured for activity at OD420. β-gal activity was determined using the equation U = 1000 × [OD420]/time (in seconds) × volume (in mL) × [OD600]. For each comparison, three independent yeast isolates were tested three times. The WER coding sequence was amplified from pGEX_WER (CITATION) as a template. The WC1 and WC7 coding sequences were amplified from total root cDNA of WER:WC1 transformants and WER:WC7 transformants, as described above. The CPC and CW5 coding sequences were amplified from pWER-BD/CPC-free and pWER-BD/CW5-free as templates. The fragments were cloned into expression vector pColdTF (TaKaRa Bio). DNA sequences were checked, and the constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Novagen). These transformed bacteria were used for purifying the recombinant proteins (custom-made by TaKaRa Bio). Oligonucleotides for gel mobility shift assays were labeled with a Roche DIG gel shift kit (2nd Generation; Roche). The sequence of GL2MBS1 is the same as reported previously (CITATION). DNA–protein binding reactions were basically performed by incubating 32 fmol of digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide with 100 ng of each protein in 20 μL of binding buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 5% 80 μg−1 poly(dI-dC), and 100 μg−1 BSA] at 22°C for 15 min, and then free and bound complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 1-mm 5% native polyacrylamide gels (Real Gel Plate; BIO CRAFT) in 0.5× TBE buffer at 8 V cm−1 for 60 min. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under the following accession numbers: WER (AL391149), GL1 (AF495524), At MYB23 (Z95747), CPC (AB004871), TRY (AY519523), ETC1 (AY519518), ETC2 (AY234411), At4g01060 (AY519522), MYB36 (AF062878), MYB37 (AF062879), MYB38 (AF062880), MYB68 (AF062901), MYB84 (Y14209), MYB87 (AF062914), PAP1 (AF325123), PAP2 (AF087936), GL2 (AB117767), GL3 (AF246291), and EGL3 (AF027732).
