!~ABS~! 14-3-3 proteins regulate a diverse set of biological responses but developmental phenotypes associated with 14-3-3 mutations have not been described in plants. Here, physiological and biochemical tests demonstrate interactions between 14-3-3s and the well-established mechanisms that govern light sensing and photoperiodic flowering control. Plants featuring homozygous disruption of 14-3-3 isoforms υ and μ display defects in light sensing and/or response. Mutant plants flower late and exhibit long hypocotyls under red light, with little effect under blue or far-red light. The long hypocotyl phenotype is consistent with a role for 14-3-3 υ and μ in phytochrome B signaling. Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays indicate that 14-3-3 υ and μ proteins physically interact with CONSTANS, a central regulator of the photoperiod pathway. Together, these data indicate a potential role for specific 14-3-3 isoforms in affecting photoperiodic flowering via interaction with CONSTANS, possibly as integrators of light signals sensed through the phytochrome system.
!~RES~! Homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants containing lesions in 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and 14-3-3μ-1 were identified in the Salk T-DNA insertion mutant collection using PCR. 14-3-3υ-1 contains a T-DNA insertion within the third exon of the 14-3-3 υ gene and 14-3-3υ-2 within the second intron (Fig. 1A ), while 14-3-3μ-1 contains a T-DNA insertion located directly 5′ to the coding region of the 14-3-3 μ gene (Fig. 1B). A second allele for the disruption of the 14-3-3 μ gene was not available. To have an adequate negative control for phenotypic assays utilizing 14-3-3μ-1, a genomic copy of the 14-3-3μ gene was introduced to the mutant and assayed in parallel with the genotype bearing the disrupted gene. This genetic complementation line contains the native 14-3-3 μ gene with the native 14-3-3 μ promoter, and was integrated into the 14-3-3μ-1 mutant genome using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (“Materials and Methods”). The 14-3-3μ-1 complementation line was named Res-mu. [[FIGURE]] Although mutants were identified by PCR, unique, isoform-specific antibodies were used to provide a superior means to demonstrate the gene-specific effect of the T-DNA insertion on protein production. The 14-3-3 isoform-specific antibodies were tested for isoform specificity via immunoblots containing recombinant 14-3-3 proteins (CITATION). The anti-14-3-3 υ immunoblot confirmed that 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 do not express any detectable 14-3-3 υ protein (Fig. 1A), while wild-type, Res-mu, and 14-3-3μ-1 lines expressed comparable levels of 14-3-3 υ protein (Fig. 1B). The 14-3-3 μ immunoblot confirmed that 14-3-3υ-1 expressed wild-type levels of 14-3-3 μ (Fig. 1A), while 14-3-3μ-1 produced only a fraction of wild-type 14-3-3 μ protein levels (Fig. 1B). Res-mu protein extracts contained concentrations of 14-3-3 μ protein at higher levels than 14-3-3μ-1, but were not quite equal to wild-type protein extracts (Fig. 1B). Separate immunoblots of the same membranes using an antibody specific for 14-3-3 υ and 14-3-3 μ (Fig. 1, A and B) demonstrated that the loss in expression of one 14-3-3 isoform does not affect the expression of the other 14-3-3 isoform. It is important to note that the 14-3-3μ-1 T-DNA insertion does not completely disrupt the accumulation of 14-3-3 μ protein (as does 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 for the 14-3-3 υ protein), as equal amounts of protein were loaded for the assay of 14-3-3μ-1 protein levels. Twelve micrograms of wild-type, Res-mu, and 14-3-3μ-1 protein extracts were loaded onto the lanes of the SDS-PAGE gel. Further, lanes were skipped to avoid protein carryover into adjacent lanes. The difference in the 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutant's expression levels of 14-3-3 υ protein and 14-3-3μ-1 of 14-3-3 μ protein may be due to the differences in T-DNA insertion localization. The 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutants have a T-DNA in the coding region of the 14-3-3 υ gene (Fig. 1A). The T-DNA insertions within the 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutants cause a disruption of the protein sequence, possibly resulting in a truncated protein that is quickly degraded. However, 14-3-3μ-1 has a T-DNA insertion within the promoter region of the 14-3-3 μ gene (Fig. 1B). Location of the 14-3-3μ-1 T-DNA allows for the expression of wild-type 14-3-3 μ, although expression occurs at a reduced level resulting from disruption of likely 14-3-3 μ regulatory sequences. This is an important consideration, as the results to follow do indicate some overlapping function. Disruption of either the 14-3-3 υ or μ locus results in a delay of flowering (Fig. 2, A and C ). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutant lines and wild-type plants were grown under long-day (16-h day, 8-h night) conditions. Emergence of the first flower varied by 3 d between 14-3-3υ-1/14-3-3υ-2 and wild type and 6 d between 14-3-3μ-1 and wild type (Fig. 2C). Flowering experiments were repeated for multiple generations with comparable results. t tests confirmed differences in the average day of flowering between wild type and 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, or 14-3-3μ-1 were significant (α < 0.0001, 0.0002, and 0.0001, respectively). Flower emergence was defined as the first appearance of petals. [[FIGURE]] The 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 mutants presented a one-leaf average increase in leaf number and 14-3-3μ-1 a two-leaf average increase in comparison to wild type (Fig. 2E). Leaf number experiments were repeated for several generations with comparable results. t tests confirmed differences in leaf number between wild type and 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, or 14-3-3μ-1 were significant (α = 0.002, 0.023, and 0.0007, respectively). The increased average leaf number results indicated that 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited a delay in the transition to flowering rather than an overall delay in development. To ensure that phenotypes observed were related to the T-DNA insertion in the 14-3-3μ gene and were not an artifact of other genomic modifications, the Res-mu line was developed as a specific negative control for the 14-3-3μ-1 line. In a separate flowering timing experiment, timing of Res-mu transition to flowering was assayed in comparison to that of 14-3-3μ-1 (Fig. 2, B and D). Res-mu exhibited a 5 d decrease in time to flowering in comparison to 14-3-3μ-1 (Fig. 2D), demonstrating a nearly complete reversal in the delay caused by the original 14-3-3μ-1 T-DNA insertion. The Res-mu line also reversed the increase in number of leaves at the time of flowering normally exhibited by 14-3-3μ-1 (Fig. 2F), indicating that the delay in flowering was due to a delay in the floral transition. 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutant flowering was monitored under short-day conditions to test if 14-3-3 proteins were associated with the photoperiod pathway and were not simply negative regulators of the floral transition (Fig. 3 ). Mutants for photoperiod regulating genes, such as CO and Gigantea (Gi) flower later during long-day conditions, yet flower at the same time as wild type in short days (CITATION; CITATION). Wild type, co mutants (co-1; CITATION; CITATION), and the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were assayed for timing to flowering and leaf number at the time point of flowering, under short-day (8 h light/16 h dark) conditions (Fig. 3). The co and 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants all exhibited flowering timing that was slightly sooner in comparison to wild type (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with previous observations of co grown under short-day conditions (CITATION). However, co and the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants produced an average number of leaves at the time point of flowering that was comparable to wild type. A t test confirmed that the number of leaves at the time point of flowering was not significantly different between wild type and co, 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, or 14-3-3μ-1 (α = 0.5207, 0.2052, 0.4102, and 0.7177, respectively). [[FIGURE]] Red, blue, and far-red wavebands play discrete roles in the flowering transition following activation of their cognate receptors (CITATION). An effective way to test the possible mechanisms accountable for deficiencies in light input to the photoperiod pathway is to compare early photomorphogenic responses in 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and wild-type seedlings in response to narrow-bandwidth red, blue, or far-red light (CITATION). Aberrant seedling development under a specific wavelength of light may indicate participation in a particular photosensory pathway. The phytochromes are receptors of red and far-red light (also blue and UV-A) whereas phototropins and cryptochromes are the dominant blue and UV light receptors (CITATION; CITATION). Since phytochromes and cryptochromes are the dominant receptors controlling hypocotyl growth inhibition, tests of growth inhibition under specific wavelengths may indicate 14-3-3 participation in a specific light-sensing/response pathway. Decreased hypocotyl growth inhibition (resulting in a longer hypocotyl after days in light) is observed when a mutant is less sensitive to the particular wavelength of light being tested (CITATION). Conversely, mutants hypersensitive to a particular wavelength will display increased hypocotyl growth inhibition under the particular wavelength of light being tested. Wild-type, Res-mu, 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and 14-3-3μ-1 were grown under narrow-bandwidth red, blue, or far-red light wavelengths for 4 d and then measured to assess hypocotyl growth inhibition. 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and 14-3-3μ-1 all displayed reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under 1 and 10 μmol m−2 s−1 red light relative to dark-grown seedlings (Fig. 4 ). 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 displayed a 22% and 32% longer hypocotyl than wild type, respectively, when grown under 1 μmol m−2 s−1 of red light and a 19% and 36% longer hypocotyl, respectively, when grown under 10 μmol m−2 s−1 of red light. 14-3-3μ-1 and Res-mu exhibited a 30% and 17% longer hypocotyl, respectively, in comparison to wild type at 1 μmol m−2 s−1 of red light and a 48% and 14% longer hypocotyl, respectively, when grown under 10 μmol m−2 s−1 of red light. Res-mu inhibition of hypocotyl elongation was more comparable to that of wild type than to 14-3-3μ-1 when grown under red light, demonstrating that the difference in hypocotyl elongation inhibition between wild type and 14-3-3μ-1 can be attributed to 14-3-3μ mutation and not second-site T-DNA insertion effects. The decrease in growth inhibition of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants under low-intensity, narrow-bandwidth red light indicates that the 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and 14-3-3μ-1 are less sensitive to red light, placing 14-3-3 υ and μ as likely components in the phytochrome input or response pathway. The 14-3-3 T-DNA mutants did not display significant defects in hypocotyl growth inhibition when grown under blue light or far-red light (data not shown), suggesting that the activity is related to phytochrome B (phyB) or other phytochromes, acting alone or in combination. [[FIGURE]] Wild-type Arabidopsis exhibits a random directional growth pattern when grown under red light (CITATION). The random directional growth habit under red light phenomenon is not fully understood. However, phyA, phyB, and phyA phyB mutants exhibit a less randomized, vertical directional growth habit under monochromatic red light (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since 14-3-3 mutants and phytochrome mutants present defects in flowering and exhibit phenotypes in hypocotyl growth inhibition, it was of interest to note any deviations in vertical growth habit associated with 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants or mutants of other photoperiod regulatory proteins. Common phenotypes may allow further resolution of how 14-3-3 proteins associate with light sensing and the flowering mechanism. Wild-type randomization of growth direction in red light is reduced in phyA and phyB mutants (CITATION), and has not been reported in seedling growth assays for phyC, phyD, or phyE mutants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, such patterns will allow discrimination of phyA and phyB effects apart from those of other phytochromes that exhibit weak stem elongation defects. Arabidopsis seeds were germinated and grown under narrow-bandwidth red light (660 nm) at 10 μmol m−2 s−1 for 4 d (Fig. 5 ). In agreement with previously published findings (CITATION), wild-type Arabidopsis exhibited a more randomized directional growth relative to gravity under monochromatic red light, whereas phyB (Salk_022035 and Salk_069700; “Materials and Methods”) mutants exhibited a more vertical tendency. GI, another protein central to flowering and other phytochrome responses (CITATION) was also studied. The gi (gi-2) mutants did not grow as vertically under narrow-bandwidth red as phyB, but gi did exhibit a more vertical directional growth habit than wild type. The co mutants exhibited a wild-type growth pattern. Consistent with sensitivity to red light in hypocotyl growth inhibition assays, the 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 mutants also exhibited a phyB-like vertical growth habit, further supporting a 14-3-3υ functional association with the PHYB light-sensing pathway. [[FIGURE]] The vertical directional growth habit under red light varied between 14-3-3υ-1/14-3-3υ-2 and 14-3-3μ-1. The 14-3-3μ-1 plants were more similar to wild type. However, 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 exhibited a phenotype similar to phyB. These data indicated that 14-3-3υ-1 phenocopies phyB and photoperiod-associated mutants in another early developmental response to light. It should be noted that the timing of flowering in plants is influenced by a number of different environmental and signaling factors. Direct influences of environment on 14-3-3s (such as differential temperature and light quality) can be eliminated as the cause of the 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and 14-3-3μ-1 delay in flowering phenotype, since the wild type and the T-DNA mutants were grown in identical conditions. The more likely and immediately tractable solution involves association of 14-3-3 proteins with the light sensory inputs to the photoperiod pathway. The influence of 14-3-3 υ and μ in flowering and early development indicated functional interaction with PHYB, possibly as a direct mechanistic link between PHYB and the photoperiod regulatory systems, including those that may include alterations in the circadian oscillator. To test this hypothesis, yeast two-hybrid assays were utilized as an assay for interactions between 14-3-3 υ or μ with proteins for the circadian oscillator and photoperiod pathway (Fig. 6 ). Two methods were utilized to test interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and candidate proteins; orthonitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assays were utilized to measure the β-galactosidase production resulting from protein-protein interactions, while growth assays relied on protein-protein interactions to activate auxotrophic markers required for yeast growth. Direct interaction between 14-3-3 isoforms and specific regulatory proteins would provide positive evidence with a 14-3-3 linkage with the photoperiod pathway. [[FIGURE]] Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed to test the interaction of 14-3-3 μ and υ with GI, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3), TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), CO, and PHYB. Heterodimer formation was also assayed between 14-3-3 μ and υ, as a positive control (CITATION), while empty vectors were tested against the two 14-3-3 isoforms to control for 14-3-3 self activation. To test 14-3-3 interactions with photoperiod-associated proteins, yeast was transformed with one DNA binding domain vector (pDEST32), containing a 14-3-3 υ or μ gene and one activation domain vector (pDEST22), containing a photoperiod-pathway gene. Heterodimer formation was tested with yeast containing 14-3-3 υ in pDEST32 and 14-3-3 μ in pDEST22. Yeast strains used as a negative control contained either 14-3-3 υ or μ in pDEST32 and an empty pDEST22. Yeast growth assays were used to test for the ability of the yeast to grow on media lacking uracil (Ura) and His. Interaction was indicated by growth on −Ura/−His dropout media. Of the many central oscillator and photoperiod pathway-associated proteins tested, interaction was only observed between CO with both 14-3-3 υ and μ (Fig. 6A). Yeast lines containing 14-3-3 υ fused to the activation domain and 14-3-3 μ fused to the DNA-binding domain also resulted in growth, presumably from the formation of 14-3-3 protein dimers. The growth assay results were verified using ONPG enzymatic assays in which β-galactosidase activity was measured in Miller units (CITATION). Results from the ONPG assays revealed that yeast expressing CO fused to the activation domain with either 14-3-3 fused to the DNA-binding domain exhibited β-galactosidase activity at higher levels than background (Fig. 6B). The yeast line expressing 14-3-3 υ fused to the DNA-binding domain and 14-3-3 μ fused to the activation domain also resulted in β-galactosidase levels higher than background, providing a positive control from known interaction between 14-3-3 proteins as dimers. No other yeast lines exhibited β-galactosidase activity higher than background. Coimmunoprecipitation from cellular extracts also demonstrates a CO-14-3-3 interaction. Leaf extracts from plants overexpressing CO (similar to published tests where overexpressing plants were employed, including CITATION) were immunoprecipitated with anti-CO antibodies and the precipitated proteins were probed with a 14-3-3 monoclonal antibody (CITATION). Cross-reacting 14-3-3 protein was detected in the anti-CO precipitation lanes but not in lanes from extracts mock precipitated without the primary anti-CO antibody (Fig. 6C).
!~MM~! Seed stocks for 14-3-3υ-1 (Salk_014690) and 14-3-3μ-1 (Salk_004455) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Homozygous T-DNA mutant lines were identified using PCR. A left border T-DNA-specific primer (LBb1) and two, T-DNA flanking, 14-3-3 gene-specific primers were used to identify lines that were homozygous for T-DNA insertion into the respective 14-3-3 genes. The 14-3-3 μ gene with the native promoter and introns was integrated into the genome of 14-3-3μ-1 using the pKGW vector (CITATION). The primers 5′-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctcctgcagcttcgtgacccat-3′ and 5′-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtcggatagatagtaagacga-3′ were used to PCR amplify the 14-3-3 μ gene from a genomic DNA extract of wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) of the ecotype Columbia-0. The PCR products were then transferred into the Gateway pDONR221 vector using Gateway BP Clonase II (Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred into pKGW from pDONR221 using the Gateway LR Clonase II recombination reaction. The pKGW vector harboring the 14-3-3 μ gene was then transformed into Agrobacterium and introduced into 14-3-3μ-1 plants by the floral-dip method (CITATION). To test protein levels in T-DNA insertion lines, protein extracts were assayed using polyclonal antibodies directed against specific 14-3-3 isoforms. This assay was important because the μ allele contained an insertion into the 5′ promoter region. Protein extracts were collected from 14-3-3 mutant and wild-type plants that were grown for 3 weeks under constant light conditions (60–70 μmol m−2 s−1; two Cool White Sylvania bulbs and two Gro-Lux bulbs). Protein extractions for testing 14-3-3 protein levels of the 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were performed by grinding one or two leaves in SDS/β-mercaptoethanol (BME) extraction buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% BME, 0.5% bromphenol blue), which was then placed in boiling water for 10 min. The protein extracts were then centrifuged at 20,800g for 10 min to clear insoluble debris. A HEPES protein extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.2% protease inhibitors [product no. P9599; Sigma-Aldrich]) was used to extract protein from 14-3-3μ-1, the 14-3-3μ-1 complementation mutant (Res-mu), and wild-type leaf tissue. Approximately 100 mg of leaf tissue was extracted from 2- to 3-week-old plants, frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground with a mortar and pestle, and placed in 500 μL of HEPES protein extraction buffer. The protein extraction solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to separate insoluble material. The supernatant was then extracted and quantified with a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop) spectrophotometer. Proteins were then diluted to 1.2 mg/mL with SDS/BME extraction buffer. A total of 20 μL of each protein sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins from the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and the membrane was treated overnight with blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, 0.8% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.1% Na2HPO4, 0.02% KH2PO4). The membranes were incubated with approximately 1:2,000 concentration of antibodies (anti-14-3-3 υ or anti-14-3-3 μ) in blocking buffer, followed by sequential incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, then Pierce Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (product no. 34080; Pierce Biochemical). Pierce western blot stripping buffer (product no. 21059; Pierce Biochemical) was used to strip antibodies from the immunoblots before probing with a separate primary antibody. Chemiluminescent signal was visualized using a Kodak Gel Logic 440 imager. Seeds of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutant lines and wild-type Arabidopsis were planted on wet Fafard Fine-germinating mix soil and placed in 4°C in dark conditions for 3 d. The plants were grown under 60 to 70 μmol m−2 s−1 of light (two Cool White Sylvania bulbs and two Gro-Lux bulbs) with 16 h day, 8 h night photoperiod at 22°C to 24°C. Data were collected from replicates of 18 developmentally uniform 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, 14-3-3μ-1, Res-mu, and wild-type plants. Flowering was scored as the first appearance of petals. Flowering number was scored as the total number of rosette leaves at the time of flowering. The number of leaves did not include the cauline leaves. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized as previously described (CITATION). Thirty to 40 seeds of each line were planted onto minimal media, which contained 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.8% agar. After planting, the seed-containing plates were wrapped in foil and incubated at 4°C for 48 h. The seeds were then exposed to white light for 1 h and placed under light emitting diode light apparatuses. Treatments included irradiation with specific fluence rates of red or far-red light (660 and 630 nm, Quantum Devices) or blue light (470 nm, Ledtronics Inc.; and a custom design used by CITATION). The spectra and composition of the light sources used are presented online at http://www.arabidopsisthaliana.com/lightsources. End point growth inhibition was evaluated after 96 h. Hypocotyl lengths were compared as the percentage of hypocotyl length of 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings relative to red-grown seedlings such that the assay measures specifically the response to light and not intrinsic length. Digital images were immediately captured using an Epson Perfection 3170 Photo scanner for further analysis. Growth inhibition was assessed by measuring hypocotyls with the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio Dental School Image Tool software (http://ddsdx.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html) and compared to elongation in darkness. The University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio Dental School Image Tool was also utilized for measuring the angle of deviation from vertical directional growth. The measurements collected were standardized and processed in Microsoft Excel. Directional growth diagrams were constructed by opening pictures of red light-grown plants in Microsoft PowerPoint and tracing lines over each individual plant in the picture, then centering the lines upon one point. The putative PHYB T-DNA insertion mutant lines, Salk_022035 and Salk_069700, were also obtained from ABRC and PCR screened for the homozygous lines, as described above for the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutant lines. However, the seeds obtained from ABRC were first grown under 1 μmol m−2 s−1 of red light for 4 d (as described above for hypocotyl growth inhibition assays) and the plants with longer hypocotyls were selected for PCR screening. One-hundred percent of the red light-grown Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 plants with longer hypocotyls were found to be homozygous for the respective T-DNA insertion. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were transformed using the Invitrogen ProQuest two-hybrid system with Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). Leaf and flower cDNA was used as the template to PCR amplify the genes of each protein studied. The primer sets used for PCR are as follows (uppercase distinguishing the Gateway cloning recombination region): 14-3-3 υ, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatgtcttctgattcgtcc-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCtcactgcgaaggtggtgg-3′; 14-3-3 μ, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatgggttctggaaaagagc-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCtcactctgcatcgtctcc-3′; PIF3, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatgcctctgtttgagctttt-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCtcacgacgatccacaaaac-3′; GI, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatggctagttcatcttcatc-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCttattgggacaaggatatagt-3′; CO, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatgttgaaacaagagagtaa-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCtcagaatgaaggaacaatccca-3′; ZTL, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatggagtgggacagtggt-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCttacgtgagatagctcgct-3′; TOC1, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatggatttgaacggtgagtg-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCtcaagttcccaaagcatcat-3; and PHYB, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCatggtttccggagtcggg-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCctaatatggcatcatcagcatc-3′. The PCR products were then transferred into the Gateway pDONR221 vector using Gateway BP Clonase II. The genes of each pDONR221 plasmid were sequenced to confirm proper recombination. The GI, ZTL, PIF3, TOC1, CO, and PHYB genes of pDONR221 were transferred to the pDEST22 destination vector and 14-3-3 υ and μ to pDEST32 using the Gateway LR Clonase II recombination reaction. The MaV203 yeast strain was transformed with a DNA-binding domain destination vector (pDEST32) and an activation domain destination vector (pDEST22) for each yeast two-hybrid interaction study. Yeast two-hybrid β-galactosidase quantifications were carried out using ONPG assays as described in the CLONTECH Laboratories Yeast Protocols Handbook (protocol no. PT3024-1, version no. PR13103; Stratagene). The yeast strains were grown overnight at 30°C with shaking in 5 mL of −Trp/−Leu dropout media (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% mix of all essential amino acids excluding Trp and Leu). Two milliliters of overnight culture were then transferred to 8 mL of yeast peptone dextrose (YPD; 1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose) media and grown at 30°C with shaking for approximately 2 h (OD600 of 1 mL = 0.5–1). Five replicates were separated from each culture. The yeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once with Z buffer (Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, KCl, and MgSO4). The yeast cell pellets were then resuspended in Z buffer and were lysed using five sequential freeze thaw cycles involving transfers from liquid nitrogen to a 37°C water bath. A Z buffer/BME solution was added along with a Z buffer/ONPG solution. The samples were then incubated in a 30°C water bath and timed for rate of yellow coloration emergence. The ONPG reactions were quenched with Na2CO3, centrifuged at 20,800g for 10 min, and the OD420 was measured. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in Miller units (CITATION): β-galactosidase units = 1,000 × OD420/(t × V × OD600); t = elapsed time (min) of ONPG reaction incubation; V = 0.1 mL × concentration factor; OD600 = A600 of 1 mL of culture after the approximately 2 h YPD grow up. Yeast cultures were grown as described above to yield OD600 of 1 mL equal to 0.5 to 1 in YPD media. A total of 1 × 108 cells of each culture were extracted and placed into a sterile tube. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and were washed twice with −Leu/Trp/Ura/His (quadruple) dropout media. The final pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of quadruple dropout media. An aliquot of 5 μL of each culture was plated on quadruple dropout agar plates and growth was assessed after 6 d. Coimmunoprecipitation was performed using a CO overexpression genotype. Briefly, the coding region of Arabidopsis CO was amplified using PCR from a cDNA template. The fragment was cloned into the pDONR221 entry vector using Gateway BP Clonase II and the Gateway LR Clonase II recombination reaction was used to directionally clone the insert into the overexpression vector pH7WG2D (CITATION). The pH7WG2D-CO vector was transferred into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 by electroporation. Plants were transformed by floral dipping as described for Res-mu. Transgenic seedlings were selected on 1× Murashige and Skoog media containing 35 mg/L hygromycin, and transgenicity was verified by the presence of the GFP visible marker in the pH7WG2D T-DNA region. Leaves of plants expressing 35S∷CO were harvested at dusk by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Clarified extracts (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton ×100) were mixed with either Immunoprecipitin or Protein-A Sepharose, with or without the presence of anti-CO (no. sc-33753; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitin was collected and washed by centrifugation. Protein-A Sepharose was collected and washed by spin column. The washed collections were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for western blotting using the anti-14-3-3 antibody α-GBC-4B9 (CITATION).
