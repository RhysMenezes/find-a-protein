!~ABS~! The seed maturation genes are specifically and highly expressed during late embryogenesis. In this work, yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) interacted with the HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF SUGAR-INDUCIBLE GENE2-LIKE1 (HSL1), and the zinc-finger CW [conserved Cys (C) and Trp (W) residues] domain of HSL1 was responsible for the interaction. Furthermore, we found that mutations in HDA19 resulted in the ectopic expression of seed maturation genes in seedlings, which was associated with increased levels of gene activation marks, such as Histone H3 acetylation (H3ac), Histone H4 acetylation (H4ac), and Histone H3 Lys 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), but decreased levels of the gene repression mark Histone H3 Lys 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) in the promoter and/or coding regions. In addition, elevated transcription of certain seed maturation genes was also found in the hsl1 mutant seedlings, which was also accompanied by the enrichment of gene activation marks but decreased levels of the gene repression mark. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that HDA19 could directly bind to the chromatin of the seed maturation genes. These results suggest that HDA19 and HSL1 may act together to repress seed maturation gene expression during germination. Further genetic analyses revealed that the homozygous hsl1 hda19 double mutants are embryonic lethal, suggesting that HDA19 and HSL1 may play a vital role during embryogenesis.
!~RES~! Previous studies suggest that HSI2/VAL1 and HSL1/VAL2 are redundant inhibitors of sugar-inducible ectopic expression of seed maturation genes during seedling growth and the two proteins together play an essential role in regulating the transition from seed maturation to active seedling growth (CITATION; CITATION). Both HSI2 and HSL1 belong to the ABI3 family and contain a plant-specific B3 DNA binding domain. In addition, HSI2 and HSL1 contain the zf-CW domain, which has been identified as a member of the histone modification reader modules for epigenetic regulation (CITATION). Using the Database of Protein Domain Interactions (http://domine.utdallas.edu/cgi-bin/Domine), it is predicted that HDA19 may interact with the zinc-finger domain. We therefore tested whether there is a direct protein–protein interaction between HDA19 and HSI2 or HSL1. The yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that HDA19 interacted with HSL1 but not HSI2 (Figure 1). [[FIGURE]] To further confirm the interaction between HDA19 and HSL1, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were used. Previous studies have proved that HDA19 is localized in the nucleus (CITATION; CITATION). The localization of HSL1 was analyzed by expressing a gene encoding an HSL1-YFP (for yellow fluorescent protein) fusion protein under the control of the 35S promoter in the Arabidopsis protoplasts. As shown in Figure 2A, the HSL1-YFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of the Arabidopsis cells. The localization of HDA19 in the hsl1 mutant was also analyzed by expressing a gene encoding an HDA19-YFP fusion protein under the control of the 35S promoter in the hsl1-1 (SALK_059568; CITATION) protoplasts. The HDA19-YFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of the hsl1-1 cells (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). For BiFC assays, HSL1 was fused to the N-terminal 174–amino acid protein of YFP in the pEarleyGate201 vector (pEarleyGate201-YN), and HDA19 was fused to the C-terminal 66–amino acid protein of YFP in the pEarleyGate202 vector (pEarleyGate202-YC) (CITATION; CITATION). The corresponding constructs were codelivered into protoplasts of Arabidopsis, and fluorescence was observed using a confocal microscope. As shown in Figure 2B, yellow fluorescence was clearly visible in the nucleus. Similar results were also observed using rice (Oryza sativa) protoplasts (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). These data indicated that HDA19 interacts with HSL1 in the nucleus. The Co-IP assay was also performed to further determine the interaction between HDA19 and HSL1. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens cultures carrying 35S:HA-HSL1 and 35S:Myc-HDA19, and leaf extracts were analyzed by Co-IP. When 35S:HA-HSL1 and 35S:Myc-HDA19 fusion proteins were transiently coexpressed in tobacco leaf cells, the Myc-HDA19 fusion protein can be coimmunoprecipitated with HA-HSL1 (Figure 2C). [[FIGURE]] In order to identify the specific regions of HSL1 and HDA19 that are involved in the interaction, we generated four and three deletion constructs of HSL1 and HDA19, respectively (Figure 3A). It was found that HDA19 interacted with the HSL1-ZF but not HSL1-B3, HSL1-EAR, and HSL1-ΔZF (Figure 3B, top), whereas HSL1-ZF only interacted with HDA19-UR1 (Figure 3B, bottom). BiFC and Co-IP assays further confirmed that HSL1-ZF and HDA19-UR1 are responsible for the interaction between HSL1 and HDA19 (see Supplemental Figures 3 and 4 online). These results suggest that HDA19 can directly interact with HSL1, and the zf-CW domain in the C-terminal region of HSL1 and the UR1 region of HDA19 are responsible for the interaction between these two proteins. [[FIGURE]] Based on the database from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi), the expression of many seed maturation genes was relatively high in the later stages of embryo development (curled cotyledons and green cotyledons) but low in the early stages of embryo development (globular, heart, and torpedo) (Figure 4A). By contrast, we found that the expression of both HDA19 and HSL1 was higher in the early stages of embryo development (heart and torpedo) than that in the later stages (curled cotyledons and green cotyledons) (Figure 4B). These expression profiling results suggest that HSL1 and HDA19 may act together to participate in regulating the transition from seed maturation to seedling growth. [[FIGURE]] The expression pattern of seed maturation genes in germinating hda19 seedlings was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We examined the expression of eight seed maturation genes, 2S2, 7S1, CRUCIFERINA (CRA1), OLEOSIN1 (OLE1), LEC1, LEC2, ABI3, and FUS3, in 14-d-old seedlings of a hda19 mutant (hda19-1) (CITATION). Except FUS3, the expression of all other genes was increased in the 14-d-old seedlings of hda19-1 compared with Wassilewskija (Ws) wild-type seedlings (Figure 5). [[FIGURE]] The expression of the seed maturation genes, including 2S2, 7S1, CRA1, OLE1, LEC1, LEC2, ABI3, and FUS3, was also investigated in 14-d-old seedlings of the hsl1-1 (CITATION) and hsl1-2 mutants by qRT-PCR. Both the hsl1-1 and hsl1-2 mutants were in the Columbia (Col) background. As shown in Figure 6, the expression levels of 7S1, OLE1, and ABI3 were increased in the 14-d-old seedlings of hsl1-1 and hsl1-2 mutants compared with Col wild-type seedlings. [[FIGURE]] A previous study suggested that HDA19 was involved in the repression of embryo-specific genes during germination (CITATION), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. To analyze whether the ectopic expression of seed maturation genes in the hda19-1 mutant is related to the change in histone acetylation and methylation in chromatin, ChIP assays were performed to analyze the chromatin of the seed maturation genes (2S2, 7S1, CRA1, LEC1, and LEC2) in the 14-d-old seedlings of the wild type and hda19-1. Since histone acetylation and methylation can occur in both the proximal promoters and/or exons (CITATION; CITATION), we therefore investigated the histone modification of the DNA sequences corresponding to the proximal promoters and the first exon regions of 2S2, 7S1, CRA1, LEC1, and LEC2 (Figure 7A). As a control, we also investigated the change of histone acetylation and methylation in the proximal promoter of ACT7 (between −690 and −557 bp) (CITATION) in the hda19-1 mutant seedlings compared with the Ws wild type. Since no changes in histone acetylation and methylation were found in the promoter of ACT7 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), we used ACT7 as an internal control to normalize the ChIP–quantitative PCR results. [[FIGURE]] We first used antibodies specific for acetylated histone H3 and histone H4. As shown in Figures 7B and 7C increased acetylation levels of both histones H3 and H4 in the proximal promoter (P1) and/or coding region (C1) of 2S2, 7S1, CRA1, LEC1, and LEC2 were observed in the hda19-1 seedlings. We also performed ChIP assays with antibodies specific for acetylated Lys residues of histone H3 and H4. As shown in Supplemental Figure 6 online, the increased acetylation levels of H3K9, H3K14, H4K5, and H4K12 on P1 and/or C1 regions of these genes were also observed in hda19-1. These results are consistent with CITATION that H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4K5ac, and H4K12ac are involved in activating the expression of seed maturation genes. ChIP analyses were also performed using antibodies specific for methylated Lys residues of H3K4, H3K27, and H3K9. ChIP using the H3K4me3 antibody showed that H3K4me3 was increased on the P1 region and/or C1 region of 2S2, 7S1, CRA1, LEC1, and LEC2 in the hda19-1 mutant (Figure 7D). This result is in line with the general observation that trimethylation at H3K4 is associated with gene activation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). By contrast, ChIP using H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 antibodies showed that these methylation marks were decreased on the P1 region and/or C1 region of these genes in the hda19-1 background (Figure 7E; see Supplemental Figure 7 online). These data were consistent with the observations that H3K27me3 was required for the repression of seed maturation genes and H3K9me2 was generally associated with silenced genes (CITATION; CITATION). We further performed ChIP-Seq analysis using the H3K14ac and H3K9me2 antibodies in the 14-d-old seedlings of Ws and hda19-1. In Ws, we identified 1334 genes that underwent H3K14ac acetylation (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online), but only four of them (ASIL2 [AT3G14180], OLE4 [AT3G27660], CRF6 [AT3G61630], and PXY [AT5G61480]) were found to be involved in seed development. By contrast, we identified 3131 genes that underwent H3K14ac acetylation in hda19-1 (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online), and 38 of them were involved in seed development (see Supplemental Data Set 3 online). We also identified 4026 and 5869 genes that underwent H3K9me2 methylation in Ws and hda19-1, respectively (see Supplemental Data Sets 4 and 5 online). Among those genes that underwent H3K9me2 methylation, 12 and 21 genes were involved in seed development in Ws and hda19-1, respectively (see Supplemental Data Sets 6 and 7 online). In hda19 mutants, we observed a significant increase of the H3K14Ac level of target genes, including those genes involved in seed development, indicating that HDA19 plays an important role in regulating the levels of H3K14Ac and gene activities. To analyze whether the ectopic expression of 7S1, OLE1, and ABI3 in hsl1 mutants is also related to the change of histone acetylation and methylation in the chromatin, ChIP assay was used to analyze histone acetylation and methylation levels of 7S1, OLE1, ABI3, CRA1, and LEC2 in 14-d-old seedlings of the hsl1-1 mutant compared with the Col wild-type seedlings. For comparison, the hda19 mutant in Col background, hda19-2 (SALK_139445) (CITATION; CITATION), was also analyzed. As shown in Figures 8B to 8D, increased levels of H3ac, H4ac, and H3K4me3 in the proximal promoter (P1) and coding region (C1) of 7S1, OLE1, and ABI3 were observed in the 14-d-old hsl1-1 seedlings compared with the Col wild-type seedlings. By contrast, the abundance of H3K27me3 was decreased in the 14-d-old hsl1-1 seedlings (Figure 8E). The levels of H3ac, H4ac, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 were not changed in both the proximal promoter (P1) and coding region (C1) of CRA1 and LEC2, which is consistent with the observation that the expression levels of CRA1 and LEC2 exhibited little change in the hsl1 mutants compared with the Col wild-type plants (Figure 6). These results suggested that the ectopic expression of 7S1, OLE1, and ABI3 in hsl1 mutants was due to the change of histone acetylation and methylation levels. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate whether HDA19 directly targets to seed maturation genes during seed germination, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HDA19-GFP (for green fluorescent protein; 35S:HDA19-GFP) (CITATION) were used to perform a ChIP assay (Figures 9). For the ChIP, 14-d-old seedlings were selected to investigate the enrichment of HDA19 in the promoter and/or coding region of the seed maturation genes in the HDA19-GFP plants compared with wild-type plants. qRT-PCR was used to determine the regions enriched by ChIP with an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Figures 9B to 9F, HDA19 was recruited to the proximal promoters (P1) of 7S1, LEC2, 2S2, CRA1, and LEC1, as well as the regions surrounding the translational starting sites (C1) of 7S1 and LEC2 (Figures 9B and 9C), suggesting that these genes probably are direct targets regulated by HDA19. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the genetic relationship between HSL1 and HDA19, we tried to generate hsl1 hda19 double mutants. In a preliminary experiment, we failed to obtain any homozygous hsl1 hda19 double mutants in ∼300 F2 seedlings. We therefore selected one allele combination, hsl1-1+/−/hda19-2+/−, for detailed analysis. As shown in Figure 10A, both green round seeds and yellow wrinkled seeds were observed in the siliques from the double heterozygous plants. The embryos in the yellow wrinkled seeds were not properly developed compared with the embryos in the green round seeds (Figures 10B and 10C). We also investigated other hsl1+/−/hda19+/− mutants, and similar phenotypes were observed (Table 1). Interestingly, the ratios of aborted seeds in the immature siliques of hsl1+/−/hda19+/− plants were much lower than an expected ratio of 1:16. This likely resulted from the linkage between HSL1 and HDA19 because both HSL1 and HDA19 are located on chromosome 4 (At4g32010 and At4g38130, respectively). We estimated that the recombination frequency (r) between HSL1 and HDA19 was ∼16% and the expected ratio of total seeds to aborted seeds was ∼156:1 (CITATION). As shown in Table 1, the actual ratio of each hsl1+/−/hda19+/− plants was consistent with the expected ratio of 156:1 (P > 0.05). [[FIGURE]] Aborted seeds were observed in the immature and mature siliques from hsl1−/−/hda19+/− and hsl1+/−/hda19−/− plants (Figure 10D, Table 2). Among 300 progeny seedlings of hsl1−/−/hda19+/− and hsl1+/−/hda19−/− plants analyzed, no hsl1 hda19 homozygous double mutants were obtained. Taken together, these results indicate that the homozygous hsl1 hda19 double mutants are embryo lethal. Therefore, HSL1 and HDA19 may play an essential role during embryo development.
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col and Ws, two hsl1 mutants, hsl1-1 (SALK_059568; CITATION) and hsl1-2 (SALK_100053; a T-DNA insertion in the 4th exon of HSL1), and two hda19 mutants, hda19-1 (CITATION) and hda19-2 (SALK_139445; CITATION; CITATION), were used in this study. The hsl1-1, hsl1-2, and hda19-2 are in the Col background, whereas hda19-1 is in the Ws background. For seed germination, sterilized seeds were incubated at 4°C for 3 d; seeds were then sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing 1% Suc and 0.6% agar. Seedlings were grown under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark condition at 22°C in a growth room. Double mutants were obtained by genetic crosses between the single mutants and genotypes were determined by PCR (for primers, see Supplemental Table 1 online). Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Matchmaker GAL4-based two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). The HSI2 and HSL1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pGADT7 vector, whereas the full-length and different deletion constructs of HDA19 cDNA were subcloned into the pGBKT7 vector. All constructs were transformed into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate method, and yeast cells were grown on a minimal medium/-Leu-Trp according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). Transformed colonies were plated onto a minimal medium/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade containing 20 µg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside to test for possible interactions. Constructs were produced by cloning HSL1 and HDA19 into pEarleyGate101 (CITATION). The resulting constructs were used for transient assays by polyethylene glycol transfection of Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATION). Transfected cells were imaged using the TCS SP5 confocal spectral microscope imaging system (Leica). For transfecting into Arabidopsis protoplasts, full-length and deleted coding sequences of HSL1 and HDA19 were PCR amplified and then subcloned into the pEarleyGate210-YN and pEarleyGate202-YC vectors (CITATION; CITATION). The resulting constructs were used for transient assays by polyethylene glycol transfection of Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATION). For transfecting into rice (Oryza sativa) protoplasts, full-length coding sequences of HDA19 and HSL1 were PCR amplified and then subcloned into the pUC-SPYNE vector and the pUC-SPYCE vector (CITATION), respectively. The resulting constructs were transfected into rice protoplasts as described by CITATION. Transfected cells were imaged using the TCS SP5 confocal spectral microscope imaging system. To generate 35S:HA-HSL1, 35S:HA-HSL1-ZF, 35S:Myc-HDA19, and 35S:Myc-HDA19-UR1 constructs, the full-length and deletion cDNAs of HSL1 and HDA19 were obtained by PCR amplification and subcloned into HA-pBA and Myc-pBA vectors, respectively. Subsequently, the four constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 and infiltrated into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) as described previously (CITATION). Co-IP assay was performed as described (CITATION). Two days after infiltration, tobacco leaves were harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted in an extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for 12 min. The supernatant was incubated with 10 µg of anti-HA antibody or anti-Myc antibody (Clontech) at 4°C overnight. Then, 50 μL of protein A agarose beads (Clontech) was added. After 4 h of incubation at 4°C, the beads were centrifuged and washed four times with a washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted with 40 μL of 2.5× sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibody or anti-HA antibody. Total RNAs were extracted from seedlings using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To eliminate genomic DNA contamination, RNA was treated with DNase I (Takara) for 20 min. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA with the Takara RNA PCR kit (Takara). qRT-PCR was performed in the IQ5 Multicolor real-time PCR detection system following the manufacturer’s instructions using the SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (Toyobo). The amount of cDNA was calculated using Bio-Rad iQ5 2.0 standard edition optical system software. qRT-PCR was conducted with three biological replicates, and each sample was conducted at least in triplicate and normalized using ACT2 or UBQ10 as an internal control. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The ChIP assay was performed as described (CITATION). Chromatin extracts were prepared from seedlings treated by 1% formaldehyde. The chromatin was sheared to an average length of 500 bp by sonication and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. Antibodies used in ChIP assays were purchased from Millipore: antiacetyl-histone H3 (Millipore; 06-599), antiacetyl-histone H4 (Millipore; 06-866), antiacetyl-histone H3K9 (Millipore; 07-352), antiacetyl-histone H3K14 (Millipore; 07-353), antiacetyl-histone H4K5 (Millipore; 07-327), antiacetyl-histone H4K12 (Millipore; 07-595), antitrimethyl-histone H3K4 (Millipore; 07-473), antidimethyl-histone H3K9 (Millipore; 17-648), antitrimethyl-histone H3K27 (Millipore; 07-449), and anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). ChIP assays were repeated with three biological replicates. The DNA cross-linked to immunoprecipitated proteins was analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR. Each sample was assayed in triplicate by real-time PCR. ACT7 was used as an internal control to normalize the results. The primers used for real-time PCR analysis in ChIP assays are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. ChIP-Seq analysis was performed as described (CITATION).
