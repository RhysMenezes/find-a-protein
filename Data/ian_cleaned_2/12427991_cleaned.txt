!~ABS~! The components of the cellular machinery that accomplish the various complex and dynamic membrane fusion events that occur at the division plane during plant cytokinesis, including assembly of the cell plate, are not fully understood. The most well-characterized component, KNOLLE, a cell plate-specific soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF)-attachment protein receptor (SNARE), is a membrane fusion machine component required for plant cytokinesis. Here, we show the plant ortholog of Cdc48p/p97, AtCDC48, colocalizes at the division plane in dividing Arabidopsis cells with KNOLLE and another SNARE, the plant ortholog of syntaxin 5, SYP31. In contrast to KNOLLE, SYP31 resides in defined punctate membrane structures during interphase and is targeted during cytokinesis to the division plane. In vitro-binding studies demonstrate that AtCDC48 specifically interacts in an ATP-dependent manner with SYP31 but not with KNOLLE. In contrast, we show that KNOLLE assembles in vitro into a large approximately 20S complex in an Sec18p/NSF-dependent manner. These results suggest that there are at least two distinct membrane fusion pathways involving Cdc48p/p97 and Sec18p/NSF that operate at the division plane to mediate plant cytokinesis. Models for the role of AtCDC48 and SYP31 at the division plane will be discussed.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis genome encodes three CDC48isoforms: AtCDC48A (At3g09840), AtCDC48B(At3g53230), and AtCDC48C (At5g03340; CITATION). AtCDC48A represents the original gene isolated by CITATION and likely represents the most abundant isoform because of the presence of >100 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and several full-length cDNAs in the Arabidopsis Information Resource (http://www.Arabidopsis.org) and Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress) databases compared with those identified to date for AtCDC48B (eight ESTs) and AtCDC48C (15 ESTs). Amino acid sequence analysis suggests that all isoforms are localized in the cytoplasm. Initial characterization of AtCDC48a by CITATION was hampered by the use of heterologous peptide-specific antibodies raised against the mammalian AtCDC48 homolog, VCP/p97. To more effectively examine its localization and function in plants, we generated affinity-purified antibodies against the C terminus (amino acids 690–809) of AtCDC48A. Given that AtCDC48B and AtCDC48C share 91% and 95% amino acid sequence identity with full-length AtCDC48A, respectively, these antibodies are expected to detect all three isoforms in Arabidopsis total protein extracts. As shown in Figure1 the C-terminal AtCDC48 antibodies detect a single 97-kD polypeptide in immunoblots of protein extracts prepared from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3). As reported previously, the mobility of AtCDC48 is slower than the predicted molecular mass of AtCDC48A-C (approximately 89 kD; CITATION). Immunoblot analysis of whole-cell protein extracts prepared from yeast cdc48-1mutants expressing AtCDC48A in the sense but not antisense orientation further confirmed the specificity of the C-terminal antibodies for AtCDC48 (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] The biochemical characterization of CDC48/p97 in plants has not been performed previously. To examine the intracellular distribution of AtCDC48, the fractionation of AtCDC48 was compared with the distribution of the soluble and membrane subcellular markers, phosphoglycerokinase (PGK; cytosol; CITATION) and AtSEC12 (ER; CITATION), respectively, in post-nuclear supernatant (S1) and 150,000gcytosol-free microsomal membrane (P150) and membrane-free cytosolic (S150) fractions (Fig. 1). In contrast to the marker proteins, AtCDC48 was detected in both soluble (S150) and membrane (P150) fractions, suggesting that AtCDC48 is a peripheral membrane protein (Fig.1A). The membrane association of AtCDC48 in the P150 fraction was confirmed by its flotation on Suc density gradients (data not shown) and was further analyzed under a variety of conditions that release integral and nonintegral proteins from membranes to examine the biochemical nature of the association of AtCDC48 with membranes. Figure 2demonstrates that AtCDC48 was preferentially released into the soluble fraction when the microsomal membranes were diluted into membrane isolation buffer (MIB) containing increasing concentrations of the denaturant urea (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). Under the same conditions, the integral membrane marker proteins KNOLLE (CITATION) and AtSEC12 (CITATION) remained in the particulate fraction. AtSEC12p and KNOLLE were only solubilized upon treatment of the membrane fraction with detergent (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). Additional experiments indicated that AtCDC48 membrane association is not sensitive to salt (up to 2 m NaCl) and, therefore, is not simply mediated by electrostatic interactions (data not shown). In contrast to the peripheral membrane marker protein ADL1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), AtCDC48 membrane association was also found to be destabilized in the absence of thiol reductant, DTT (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4), suggesting that the protein is sensitive to the redox potential of its environment. All subcellular fractionation and biochemical experiment conditions in this manuscript, therefore, contain DTT. Protein recovery in the soluble and particulate fractions was assessed and found to be near 100% except for samples treated with 8m urea (data not shown). These data strongly support the conclusion that AtCDC48 is a peripheral membrane-associated protein.  [[FIGURE]] From biochemical and cryoelectron microscopy studies, both Cdc48p/p97 and Sec18p/NSF have been shown to assemble as stacked hexameric rings (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Hexameric p97 has also been shown to form higher-ordered hetero-oligomers with its adapter protein p47 (CITATION). To examine the native oligomeric structure of soluble AtCDC48, cytosolic protein extracts were subjected to sizing by gel filtration and velocity sedimentation (Fig. 3). Similar to the reported mass of cytosolic p97/CDC48 from various organisms including pure homohexameric rat p97 (600 kD; CITATION) Xenopus sp. p97 (570 kD; CITATION) and the Trypanosoma sp. Cdc48p/p97 ortholog, TbVCP (555 kD; CITATION), native cytosolic AtCDC48 was found to fractionate by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography with an estimated molecular mass of 640 kD. For comparison, the majority of Arabidopsis cytosolic proteins were found to fractionate with a molecular mass less than 250 kD (data not shown). By glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation analysis, we confirmed the oligomeric nature of AtCDC48. The fractionation profile of AtCDC48 was highly reproducible between separate gradients, and a typical immunoblot of gradient fractions is shown in Figure 3B. The majority of cytosolic AtCDC48 was found to sediment at approximately 17S (fractions 18 and 19), which is much larger than reported for theXenopus sp. p97 14.5S homohexameric andTrypanosoma sp. TbVCP complexes (CITATION; CITATION). One possible explanation for the substantial difference in sedimentation rates between AtCDC48 and these other p97/CDC48 orthologs may be related to the different gradient density medium used in these studies (i.e. glycerol versus Suc), which could affect the hydrodynamic properties of the CDC48p/p97 complex and, hence, its observed sedimentation rate. In addition to the 17S AtCDC48 peak, a significant fraction of cytosolic AtCDC48 was found to sediment further than the 19.4S marker (Fig. 3B) with a small but reproducible peak (fraction 22), suggesting that cytosolic hexameric AtCDC48 exists in higher-ordered complexes similar to the 740-kD rat p97/p47 complex (CITATION). A minor fraction of AtCDC48 was also observed to sediment at approximately 6.7S (fraction 10; approximately 125 kD) which is likely to correspond to monomeric AtCDC48 and/or a subcomplex composed of a single AtCDC48 subunit and a low-molecular mass adapter protein(s). These results suggest that cytosolic AtCDC48 is predominantly associated with homohexameric and high-ordered protein oligomers in actively dividing and expanding Arabidopsis cells.  [[FIGURE]] Previously CITATION provided evidence that mammalian p97 antibodies weakly immunolabeled the phragmoplast midzone of dividing Arabidopsis cells. We have therefore reexamined the localization of CDC48/p97 in dividing and nondividing plant cells using affinity-purified AtCDC48-specific antibodies (Fig.4). Cells in cytokinesis (Fig. 4, rows A and B) were identified using DAPI to detect binucleated cells, anti-α-tubulin antibodies to visualize phragmoplast microtubules, and the cell plate syntaxin KNOLLE (Fig. 4, row A) to identify the cell plate. KNOLLE antibodies were also found to reproducibly label large punctate organelles in dividing (Fig. 4, row A; see black arrowheads) and nondividing (data not shown) protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells.  [[FIGURE]] By wide-field epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, affinity-purified AtCDC48 antibodies were found to label the equatorial region of phragmoplasts in telophase cells (Fig. 4, rows B and D; black arrows). In addition, AtCDC48 was observed in punctate, cytoplasmically distributed structures in both dividing and interphase cells (Fig. 4, rows B–D; arrowheads). During interphase, AtCDC48 was also found to be associated with the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4C, white arrow), as confirmed by colocalization with the nuclear import receptor, α-importin (CITATION; data not shown). Immunolabeling of the division plane or other intracellular structures was not observed in cells treated with preimmune IgYs or with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (data not shown). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 4, row D) of cells immunolabeled for both KNOLLE (red) and AtCDC48 (green) showed significant but incomplete colocalization of the two proteins at the plane of division, as shown by the yellow color in the merged image (Fig. 4, row D; merged, black arrow) of the two separate emission channels (red and green) obtained from a single optical section. Complete colocalization, however, was observed in the cytoplasmic punctate structures (Fig. 4D, merged, black arrowheads). Control double immunolabeling experiments with either anti-KNOLLE or anti-AtCDC48 and antibodies directed against Arabidopsis α-mannosidase, a Golgi-resident marker protein (T.G. Falbel and S.Y. Bednarek, unpublished data), demonstrated that the punctate cytoplasmic structures that contain both KNOLLE and AtCDC48 do not correspond to Golgi apparati (data not shown). To further characterize the localization of AtCDC48, we analyzed its subcellular distribution by Suc density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 5). The distribution of AtCDC48 present in a postnuclear supernatant (S1) was compared with various compartment-specific marker proteins including PGK (cytosol;CITATION), AtSEC12 (ER; CITATION), UDPase (Golgi; CITATION), AHA2p (plasma membrane; CITATION), and the SNAREs, KNOLLE (cell plate; CITATION), SYP21 (endosomes; CITATION), and SYP31 (CITATION;CITATION). Cytosolic AtCDC48 that cofractionated with PGK did not enter the gradient and remained in the load (Fig. 5, load, fractions 1–7), whereas membrane-associated AtCDC48 was found exclusively in slowly sedimenting fractions (Fig. 5, fractions 8–32, 17%–25% [w/w] Suc) that coincide with major peaks for SYP31, SYP21, and KNOLLE. Two smaller but significant peaks of KNOLLE, SYP21, and SYP31 were also observed to cosediment with dense fractions containing Golgi (Fig. 5, fractions 16–19) and ER (Fig. 5, fractions 20–22) marker proteins, however, these membranes were devoid of AtCDC48. Suc density gradient flotation analysis confirmed that the pool of AtCDC48 that entered into the Suc sedimentation gradient (Fig.5, fractions 11–12) was membrane associated (data not shown). Our results demonstrate that membrane-associated AtCDC48 cofractionates with SYP31, SYP21, and KNOLLE.  [[FIGURE]] The yeast and mammalian SYP31 orthologs, Sed5p/syntaxin 5 have been shown previously to be associated with the ER-to-Golgi branch of the secretory pathway (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION); however, localization of SYP31 in plant cells has not been reported to date. As shown in Figure 1, affinity-purified SYP31 antibodies detect a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 33 kD in protein extracts prepared from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells (Fig. 1, SYP31) and Wassilewskija ecotype plant tissue (data not shown). As expected for a SNARE-type protein, the 33-kD polypeptide was found to be associated exclusively with microsomal (P150) membranes in wild-type Arabidopsis protein extracts (Fig. 1) and with an additional 64-kD protein in transgenic plants that express a SYP31-green fluorescent fusion protein (S. Park and S.Y. Bednarek, unpublished data). In addition to SYP31, the Arabidopsis genome encodes a second Sed5p/syntaxin 5 ortholog, SYP32 (CITATION), that displays limited amino acid sequence identity to the N terminus of SYP31 (46% identical, 62% similar). Control immunoblot experiments verified that affinity-purified SYP31 antibodies did not cross-react with an Escherichia coli expressed fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of SYP32 (data not shown). To further assess the subcellular localization of SYP31 in dividing and interphase cells, Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells were processed for indirect double-immunolabeling using affinity-purified SYP31 antibodies and anti-α-tubulin to visualize cortical and phragmoplast microtubules and analyzed by wide-field epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6). In both dividing and interphase cells, SYP31 was found to be associated with both large (Fig. 6A, white arrowheads) and small cytoplasmic punctate structures (Fig. 6A, black arrowheads). The nature of these structures remains to be determined; however, the size and distribution of the small vesicular bodies closely resemble Golgi stacks when viewed by immunolabeling with anti-α-mannosidase (T.G. Falbel and S.Y. Bednarek, unpublished data). Consistent with this idea, we have shown by subcellular fractionation that a significant fraction of SYP31 cofractionates with the Golgi-marker protein, UDPase (Fig. 5). During cytokinesis, the subcellular distribution of SYP31 was found to expand to include the division plane (Fig. 6, A [top cell], and B, see black arrow). In contrast, α-mannosidase was not observed within the division plane (data not shown) as previously demonstrated (CITATION). Double immunolabeling with anti-SYP31 and anti-α-mannosidase was not performed because both primary antibodies are of rabbit origin. Our localization studies suggest that in contrast to the cell plate syntaxin KNOLLE, which is expressed only during cell division, SYP31 is present throughout the cell cycle and is recruited to the division plane during cytokinesis.  [[FIGURE]] The above observations indicate that AtCDC48 cofractionates with KNOLLE and SYP31 and that all three proteins are targeted to the division plane during cytokinesis. To determine whether AtCDC48 interacts with either SYP31 or KNOLLE, we assessed the in vitro binding of cytosolic AtCDC48 to immobilized glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the N-terminal cytosolic domains of KNOLLE, SYP31, and the prevacuolar compartment SNARE, SYP21. In addition, the nucleotide requirement for binding of AtCDC48 to the SNAREs was examined. As shown in Figure 7, cytosolic AtCDC48 was found to interact specifically with GST-SYP31ΔTM (Fig. 7A, lanes 11 and 13), whereas binding of AtCDC48 to GST, GST-SYP21ΔTM, and GST-KNOLLEΔTM was not detected under any of the experimental conditions used. E. coli expressed GST-SYP31ΔTM, GST-SYP21ΔTM, and GST-KNOLLEΔTM were found to specifically interact with mammalian α-SNAP, indicating that all of our fusion proteins were active in the in vitro binding assay (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] In the presence of ATPγS, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog and the adapter protein α-SNAP, the AAA ATPase, NSF/Sec18p, binds stably to SNAREs forming a 20S complex (CITATION; CITATION). In contrast, binding of AtCDC48 with SYP31 was only observed in the presence of ATP and under conditions that support nucleotide hydrolysis (Fig. 7A, lanes 11 and 13). Binding of cytosolic AtCDC48 to GST-SYP31ΔTM was inhibited in the presence of two different non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, ATPγS (Fig. 7A, lanes 4–6) and 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (Fig. 7A, lanes 7–9, 15, and 16). Mg2+ is required for ATP hydrolysis by AAA proteins. Addition of EDTA to coordinate the Mg2+ in the presence of ATP also inhibited binding AtCDC48 to GST-SYP31ΔTM (Fig. 7A, lane 2). These data strongly suggest that AtCDC48 interaction with SYP31 is ATP-hydrolysis dependent. The specificity of the observed in vitro interaction between GST-SYP31ΔTM and cytosolic AtCDC48 was confirmed through chemical cross-linking experiments using mechanically disrupted Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells (Fig. 7B). Because of our inability to immunoprecipitate using either anti-AtCDC48 or anti-SYP31 antibodies, we determined endogenous Arabidopsis AtCDC48/SYP31 interaction via chemical cross-linking with a non-cleavable cross-linker and immunoblot analysis looking for comigration of high M rspecies that were immunoreactive to both anti-AtCDC48 and anti-SYP31 antibodies. To perform this analysis, a protein blot was first probed with anti-AtCDC48 followed by chemical removal of bound antibodies and re-probed with anti-SYP31 antibodies. Upon chemical cross-linking of Arabidopsis protein fractions, several anti-AtCDC48 immunoreactive large complexes were detected when compared with samples not cross-linked (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 2 and 1, respectively). Upon reprobing the stripped blot with anti-SYP31 antibodies, a single band was detected that entered the resolving gel and comigrated with an anti-AtCDC48 immunoreactive band (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 4 to 2, respectively; note the asterisks). In contrast KNOLLE was not found to interact with AtCDC48 under the same cross-linking/immunoblotting conditions (data not shown). As described above, AtCDC48 was found to interact with SYP31 and not KNOLLE under the binding conditions tested both in vitro and in vivo. To test whether the cell plate syntaxin KNOLLE interacts with Sec18p/NSF, detergent-solubilized Arabidopsis microsomal proteins were incubated in the presence of mammalian α-SNAP and NSF under conditions that block ATP hydrolysis (Fig.8). Genes encoding NSF/Sec18p and SNAP/Sec17p orthologs are present in the Arabidopsis genome (CITATION), however, E. coliexpression constructs for these proteins are currently unavailable. Therefore, mammalian α-SNAP and NSF were used for these experiments because previous studies have shown that the yeast and mammalian NSF/Sec18p and SNAP/Sec17p are interchangeable (CITATION). In addition, it has been shown that mammalian α-SNAP binds the Arabidopsis SNARE, SYP21, indicating that the function of these proteins in membrane fusion is conserved between species (CITATION). In the presence of α-SNAP and NSF, a significant fraction of total cellular KNOLLE was recruited into an approximately 20S complex that cofractionated with NSF (Fig.8). The efficiency of 20S particle formation observed in Figure 8 is similar to that observed for the formation of 20S particles containing syntaxin 5 from rat liver membranes (CITATION). KNOLLE behaved exclusively as a monomer in the absence of α-SNAP and NSF. The results support the model proposed by G. Jürgens and colleagues (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) that KNOLLE is likely a syntaxin for a Sec18p/NSF-dependent membrane fusion pathway at the cell plate during plant cytokinesis.  [[FIGURE]]

(Piscataway, NJ) and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, donkey anti-chicken, or goat anti-rat) conjugated to Cy3 or FITC were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All other reagents unless specified were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis) and Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh). All oligonucleotides used in this study (TableI) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA).  Oligonucleotides used in this study The C-terminal coding region of AtCDC48(690–809) was amplified by PCR using primers SB-34/SB-35 and subcloned as anNdeI-XhoI fragment into pET29A (Novagen, Madison, WI) to yield AtCDC48 (690–809)-his6. To generate the bacterial GST-AtCDC48(690–809)-his 6 expression construct, AtCDC48 (690–809)-his6 was PCR amplified using primers SB-34/SB5a and subcloned as a BamHI-SmaI fragment into pGEX-5A-2 (Amersham Biosciences Inc.).  KNOLLE (1–275) and KNOLLE (1–294) were PCR amplified using pairs SB-1/SB-2 and SB-1/SB-32, respectively, from the bacterial artificial chromosome F22013 (accession no. AC003981; Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Columbus, OH) and cloned asNdeI-XhoI andBamHI-SmaI fragments into pET29A and pGEX-2T to yield the KNOLLE(1–294)ΔTM-His6 and GST-KNOLLE (1–294) expression constructs. SYP31(1–319) was amplified by PCR using the primer pair T3/SB-28 from pBS-His6-SYP31 (CITATION), containing the SYP31 cDNA, and subcloned as an NdeI-XhoI fragment into pET29A to generate pSYP31(1–319)ΔTM-His6.SYP31(1–182) was amplified by PCR using primer pair SB-28/SB-366 from pBS-His6-SYP31 and subcloned as an RsaI fragment into aSmaI-cleaved pGEX4T-3 vector to generate pGST-SYP31(1–182).

Bednarek, unpublished data) GST expression plasmids containingSYP31ΔTM(46–319) andSYP31ΔTM(4–253) and were provided by N. Raikhel (University of California, Riverside). Escherichia coliexpression constructs for mammalian his6-NSF and his6-α-SNAP were kindly provided by T. Martin (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Plasmids expressing GST- and His-tagged fusion proteins were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) LysS, and fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) or Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. With the exception of GST-SYP32ΔTM (1–319) and SYP31ΔTM-His6, all E. coli-expressed fusion proteins used in this study were soluble. Protein concentrations and purity of E. coli expressed fusion proteins were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and scanning densitometry using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Chicken IgY antibodies were raised against GST-AtCDC48-His6 and purified as described (CITATION). Rabbit antibodies against KNOLLE and SYP31 were raised using E. coli expressed and purified KNOLLE(1–275)ΔTM-His6 and SYP31(1–319)ΔTM-His6 as antigens. All antibodies generated in this study were purified by affinity chromatography against their respective immobilized-antigens as described previously (CITATION). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (CITATION) with the exception that the fixed Arabidopsis protoplasts were permeabilized in microtubule-stabilizing buffer (CITATION; 50 mmPIPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm EGTA) containing 0.5% (v/v) NP-40 and 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide for 5 min at 20°C before plating. For double-immunolabeling experiments, the cells were incubated sequentially with affinity-purified primary antibodies of different species followed by a mixture of the corresponding secondary antibodies labeled with FITC and Cy3. Wide-field microscopy and image processing were performed as described (CITATION). Confocal microscopy was performed using an Axiovert 100 M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser scanning unit and a 63× (natural abundance 1.4) PlanAPOChroma oil immersion objective lens. Separate images were collected from each fluorescence emission channel, and images were processed using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). The labeling pattern observed in fixed protoplasts versus cells that were fixed before enzymatic removal of the cell wall resulted in no observed difference in the distribution of AtCDC48 or other marker proteins relative to the images shown in Figure 4. Soluble and membrane fractions were prepared from 3-d-old Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells as described (CITATION) with the following modifications. In brief, protoplasts were washed once in chilled 2× concentrated MIB ([1×]; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KOAc, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 250 mm sorbitol) with DTT (1× = 1 mm) and then diluted 1:5 in chilled MIBDTT + protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC) (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg mL−1pepstatin A, 1 μg mL−1 chymostatin, 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine, 1 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 5 μg mL−1 aprotinin, 1 μg mL−1leupeptin, and 10 μg mL−1 E64) and lysed by passage 7× through a 25-gauge needle. A post-nuclear supernatant designated as S1 was prepared by centrifugation at 1,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Microsomal membranes were prepared by centrifugation of the S1 at 150,000g in a TLA100.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant (S150) was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet (P150) was resuspended in MIBDTT + PIC using a glass dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ). Aliquots were made of each fraction, snap frozen in N2(L), and stored at −80°C. Protein content of each fraction was determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit and BSA as a standard. For Suc gradient fractionation, an S1 (2.5 mL, 5 × 105 protoplast equivalents) was applied to a continuous 10 mL of 14% to 50% (w/w) Suc gradient in MIBDTT containing a 0.5 mL of 60% (w/w) Suc cushion. Gradients were centrifuged at 150,000g (28,500 rpm) in a SW40 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 2 h at 4°C. Fractions (32 × 0.4 mL) were collected from the top at 0.5 mL min−1 using a gradient collector (model 640, Isco Inc., Lincoln, NE) and analyzed for their content of latent uridine-5′-diphosphatase UDPase activity (below), refractive index, and by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. UDPase activity, a marker of the Golgi apparatus was measured as previously described (CITATION). For sedimentation velocity analysis, membrane-free cytosol (S150′) was generated by centrifugation of an S1 fraction at 150,000g (45 min, 4°C) onto a 10% (w/w) Suc cushion. One hundred microliters of S150′ (600 μg protein, 3.6 × 106 protoplast equivalents) was layered onto a 4.8-mL continuous 10% to 40% (w/w) glycerol gradient in MIB containing 1 mm DTT (MIBDTT). Gradients were centrifuged at 128,000g in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 18 h at 4°C. Fractions (12 × 0.4 mL) were collected from the top using a density fraction collector (model 640, Isco Inc.) and analyzed by immunoblotting. In parallel, gradients were centrifuged containing globular protein standards with known sedimentation coefficients: ovalbumin (3.66S), BSA (4.41S), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (7.61S), β-amylase (8.9S), catalase (11.3S), apoferritin (17.7S), and thyroglobulin (19.4S). For gel filtration, 4 × 106 Arabidopsis protoplast equivalents of fresh membrane-free S150 cytosol (0.2 mL volume) was spiked with M r standards (apoferritin and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase) and loaded onto a MIBDTT-equilibrated Superose-6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) under the control of an FPLC system. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min−1, and 0.5-mL fractions were collected. The protein elution profile was determined using an in-line UV detector (280 nm), and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting against AtCDC48. In parallel, the elution profile of known molecular mass standards was determined: ovalbumin (43.5 kD), BSA (66 kD), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kD), β-amylase (200 kD), catalase (250 kD), apoferritin (480 kD), thyroglobulin (669 kD), and blue dextran (2,000 kD, void volume) that consistently eluted at fraction 17. Freshly prepared or N2(L) frozen microsomal membranes (100 μg protein) were diluted (approximately 17-fold) into MIBPIC containing either DTT (1 mm), urea (3m or 8 m), or TX-100 (1% [w/v]), or alternatively, no dilution was made. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation (90,000 rpm, 30 min, 20°C; Beckman Coulter TLA100.1). Supernatants were concentrated by precipitation (CITATION) and 20-μg protein equivalents of supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Before immunoblotting, the membrane was analyzed by PonceauS staining to confirm protein recovery and equal loading. For in vitro AtCDC48 binding studies, 200 μg of Arabidopsis S150 protein was incubated with 0.05 nmol of fusion proteins (GST, GST-SYP21, GST-SYP31, or GST-KNOLLE) immobilized on 6.25 μL of glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KOAc, 250 mm sorbitol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% [v/v] NP40 plus protease inhibitor cocktail) in the presence of adenosine nucleotides (1 mm final) and either MgOAc (1 mmfinal) or EDTA (10 mm final). The beads were washed four times with 1 mL of binding buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. To determine whether AtCDC48/SYP31 interact in vivo, 100 μg of Arabidopsis S1 protein in buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KOAc, 250 mm sorbitol, 1 mmMg(OAc)2 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and protease inhibitor cocktail) was incubated with either Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3; 1 mmfinal; Pierce Inc., Rockford, IL) or BS3 prequenched with ethanolamine (40 mm final) for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were quenched by the addition of 200 mm ethanolamine in reaction buffer (40 mmfinal) for 10 min at room temperature. Total reactions were then solubilized in 5× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by discontinuous SDS-PAGE (4% [w/v] stacking and 7% [w/v] resolving) and immunoblotting. The entire stacking and resolving gels were used for protein transfer to nitrocellulose. Successive antibody probings of the same nitrocellulose were performed with a blot that was chemically stripped of antibodies by incubation in stripping solution (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% [w/v] SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50°C according to the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The efficiency of stripping was confirmed by re-exposing the nitrocellulose membrane to film. In addition, the immunoblot was treated with azide between probing to inhibit any residual secondary-antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugate. Microsomal membranes (P150) were washed with 1 mKCl, solubilized in 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 150,000g for 30 min. Supernatant (900 μg of 150,000g) was preincubated in 200 μL of NSF-binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, O.5% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 100 mmATP) in the absence or presence of purified E. coliproduced myc-NSF-His6 (20 μg) and His6-α-SNAP (20 μg; CITATION) for 30 min at 4°C and fractionated by velocity sedimentation through a 4.8 mL of 16% to 32.5% (v/v) glycerol density gradient at 200,000g in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 20.5 h at 4°C. Glycerol gradients in NSF-binding buffer containing 1 mm DTT were prepared and fractionated as described above. Equal volume fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE fractionation followed by Coomassie Blue staining for protein standards or immunoblotting against KNOLLE and mammalian NSF. Anti-mammalian NSF antibodies (2E5; CITATION) do not cross-react with endogenous Arabidopsis NSF (data not shown).
