!~ABS~! Potassium (K+) is essential for plant growth and development, yet the molecular identity of many K+ transporters remains elusive. Here we characterized cation/H+ exchanger (CHX) 14 as a plasma membrane K+ transporter. CHX14 expression was induced by elevated K+ and histochemical analysis of CHX14 promoter::GUS transgenic plants indicated that CHX14 was expressed in xylem parenchyma of root and shoot vascular tissues of seedlings. CHX14 knockout (chx14) and CHX14 overexpression seedlings displayed different growth phenotypes during K+ stress as compared with wild‐type seedlings. Roots of mutant seedlings displayed higher K+ uptake rates than wild‐type roots. CHX14 expression in yeast cells deficient in K+ uptake renders the mutant cells more sensitive to deficiencies of K+ in the medium. CHX14 mediates K+ efflux in yeast cells loaded with high K+. Uptake experiments using 86Rb+ as a tracer for K+ with both yeast and plant mutants demonstrated that CHX14 expression in yeast and in planta mediated low‐affinity K+ efflux. Functional green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐tagged versions of CHX14 were localized to both the yeast and plant plasma membranes. Taken together, we suggest that CHX14 is a plasma membrane K+ efflux transporter involved in K+ homeostasis and K+ recirculation. 
!~RES~! The CHXs are a subfamily of secondary membrane transporters in the Arabidopsis genome (Maser et al. CITATION; Sze et al. CITATION). Both CHX13 and CHX14, along with CHX26 and CHX27, comprise sub‐clade III of the CHX transporters, which are different from several characterized CHXs (Sze et al. CITATION, Supporting Information Fig. S1a). RT‐PCR was performed to clone the CHX14 (At1g06970) open reading frame (ORF) from a cDNA library of pollen grains. The CHX14 cDNA comprises 2490 nucleotides, which could encode a protein with 829 amino acids (EF571900). CHX14 shows the highest identity (71%) and similarity (84%) with CHX13, suggesting that they are products of an ancient gene duplication (Sze et al. CITATION). In contrast, CHX14 shares 31% identity and 51% similarity with CHX17, 31% identity and 51% similarity with CHX23, and 23% identity and 47% similarity with yeast KHA1. The putative CHX14 protein contains 12 transmembrane domains (Supporting Information Fig. S1). These data suggest that CHX14 is most closely related to CHX13 in Arabidopsis.  While CHX14 transcripts could be detected in all tissues by reverse transcriptase (RT)‐PCR (Fig. 1a, Supporting Information Fig. S2), CHX14 expression was enhanced by 100 mM KCl (Fig. 1b,c) and also marginally induced by K+ depletion (Fig. 1d). Plants exposed to 100 mM KCl treatment demonstrated that CHX14 expression markedly increased in the root, root–shoot junction, stem/petiole, and leaf tissues, particularly in stem/petioles. The public microarray database also collaborates that CHX14 is slightly induced by K+ starvation (Armengaud et al. CITATION). We also noted that CHX14 showed enhanced expression in cells in close proximity to vascular tissues (Supporting Information Fig. S3, Brady et al. CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] CHX14 expression in response to K+ levels was further confirmed by native CHX14 promoter‐driven GUS activity assays. CHX14::GUS activity was detected in vascular tissues, and junction vascular tissues between roots and shoots of seedlings after 6 h of reaction with the GUS substrate (Fig. 1d–i; Supporting Information Fig. S4). Enhanced GUS staining was examined in seedlings grown for 2 d in K+‐deficient media, and GUS activity was increased in seedlings grown for 2 d in 100 mM K+‐containing media (Fig. 1d–i, Supporting Information Fig. S5). At high K+ levels (100 mM), the CHX14::GUS activity was detected not only in hypocotyls and roots, but also in whole cotyledons (Fig. 1f,i).The K+‐dependent expression of CHX14::GUS was seen over a range of K+ concentrations (20–100 mM). Analyses of CHX14::GUS activity, RT‐PCR, and northern blot data indicated CHX14 displayed enhanced expression in response to K+ fluctuations. Cross sections of CHX14::GUS roots showed that CHX14 was primarily expressed in xylem parenchyma in roots under 10 mM KCl, but can extend to both xylem parenchyma and root procambium, and other tissues after 100 mM KCl. This is consistent with public microarray data (Supporting Information Figs S3–S5) and the Arabidopsis eFP Browser (Brady et al. CITATION, http://efp.ucr.edu/cgi‐bin/relative.cgi).  To determine the function of CHX14 in planta, we obtained two independent T‐DNA insertion lines for CHX14 (Fig. 2a). To confirm the T‐DNA insertion site and select homozygous lines, PCR‐based screening was performed using CHX14 specific primers and T‐DNA primers. Sequencing of the PCR‐amplified fragments confirmed that the T‐DNA insertions were located within the coding sequences of both open reading frames (Fig. 2a). No CHX14 transcripts could be detected from total RNA isolated from the respective mutant flowers (Fig. 2b). The two chx14 lines showed no obvious morphological or growth defects compared with control plants under standard growth conditions (Fig. 3). Previously we characterized chx13 lines (Zhao et al. CITATION) and in order to dissect the functional relationship between CHX13 and CHX14, we now generated chx13/chx14 double mutants. Crosses between homozygous chx13‐2 and chx14‐2 were performed, and homozygous chx13/chx14 double mutants were identified among F2 individuals by PCR.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] CHX14, like CHX13, is found in relatively low abundance in plants, thus CHX14 overexpression transgenic lines driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were also generated. In these lines CHX14 mRNA levels were significantly higher than that in vector controls (Fig. 2c). Despite the increased amounts of CHX14 levels in these lines, no obvious change in plant growth and development was detected when the plants were grown under standard growth conditions.  Under standard growth conditions (1/2 MS medium containing about 10 mM K+), chx14 single mutants, chx13/chx14 and 35S::CHX14 lines grew in a manner similar to control lines (Fig. 3a). However, when these lines were germinated and grown on low K+ in media at varying pH levels, chx14 seedlings appeared to exhibit slightly more robust grow than controls (Fig. 3b–d). In comparison, chx13/chx14 lines grew to a reduced size compared with chx14 lines, but at a rate similar to chx13 lines (Fig. 3b–d; Zhao et al. CITATION, Supporting Information Fig. S6).  Measurements of total chlorophyll and fresh weight analysis in these lines quantify the growth differences (Fig. 3e–h). chx14 lines contained more chlorophyll and increased biomass compared with the controls, whereas chx13/chx14 lines had much lower biomass and chlorophyll levels than controls (Fig. 3e–h). Interestingly, the transgenic lines that expressed high levels of CHX14 displayed more sensitivity to low K+ conditions and less growth when compared with controls, which were similar to chx13 lines (Zhao et al. CITATION, Fig. 3a–f). These phenotypes were accentuated on media with low K+ content, as chx14 knockout lines were more tolerant in low K+ conditions while CHX14 overexpression lines were more sensitive to K+‐deficiencies (Fig. 3, Supporting Information Fig. S6c).  In order to understand how changes of CHX14 expression altered K+ homeostasis in plants, 86Rubidium (86Rb+) efflux and uptake kinetics of chx14‐1, 35S::CHX14 transgenic and vector control seedlings were analysed. However, it is difficult to measure K+ flux from whole roots since CHX14 is mainly expressed in vascular tissues. We thus measured uptake activity by measuring time‐ and concentration‐dependent 86Rb+ uptake into roots of K+‐starved plants, since CHX14 is also induced by K+ starvation like CHX13 (Zhao et al. CITATION). The initial uptake of 86Rb+ was linear in all lines for 20 min, with uptake being higher for the chx14‐1 line than the 35S::CHX14 and control lines (Fig. 4). Uptake rates for 86Rb+ revealed a difference between vector control and chx14‐1 lines at both low and high K+ concentrations (Fig. 4a,b). At high K+ concentrations (20 mM) the difference in uptake kinetics could be seen between vector control and chx14‐1 lines (Fig. 4b). 35S::CHX14 lines demonstrated a decrease in 86Rb+ uptake at low K+ concentrations compared with vector controls (Fig. 4a), whereas the chx14 lines displayed higher 86Rb+ uptake rates than vector controls. To evaluate the CHX14‐mediated efflux, the difference between the uptake rates of vector controls and 35S::CHX14 was measured. A plot of the difference in uptake rates, as a function of K+ concentration, approximates a saturable system with a Km of 3022.7 μM and Vmax of 90.9mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 4d,e). To understand the efflux transport mediated by CHX14, we measured 86Rb+ uptake in 35S::CHX14 lines as compared with control plants under different pH conditions and in the presence of the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 4f). It was observed that optimal uptake was measured at alkali pH conditions and the protonophore inhibited K+ uptake in these whole‐plant experiments, suggesting that CHX14‐mediated K+ efflux is dependent on a pH or electrochemical gradient (Fig. 4f).  [[FIGURE]] Since CHX14 expression was induced when plants were grown under high K+ concentration conditions, we germinated and grew these lines in one‐half‐strength MS plates containing 100 mM KCl (pH 5.6). CHX14 loss‐of‐function (chx14 and chx13/chx14) and overexpression lines showed opposite growth phenotypes in comparison with lines grown on 2 mM K+ plates. Both knockout lines grew more slowly than wild type in 100 mM KCl. Given the plethora of low‐affinity K+ uptake transporters working in the root vascular system, we posit there must be some K+ transporters to translocate high levels of K+ to other tissues to attenuate a potentially toxic load of K+ in the roots. Our working model suggests a specific and strong up‐regulation of CHX14 by 100 mM K+, which might be employed to limit toxicity of K+. To test this point, we transferred young seedlings to 1/2MS containing 100 mM KCl (Fig. 5a–h). As previously established, the elongation of both primary roots of chx14‐1 and chx14‐2 was less than wild type; however, roots of the overexpression lines grew better than wild type. When the K+ content in roots, stems, and leaves from these K+‐stressed seedlings was analysed, root K+ content of the two overexpression lines were low whereas the two knockout lines were high (Fig. 5c, Supporting Information Fig. S7). However, K+ content in leaves and stems of these seedlings under high K+ stress showed opposite trends: stems and leaves of chx14‐1 and chx14‐2 contained less K+ than controls, whereas stems and leaves from overexpression lines contained more K+, and in chx13/chx14 lines they displayed the lowest total cellular K+ content. These data suggest that CHX14 might transport excess K+ in roots to leaf and hypocotyl cells to minimize the localized stress and at the same time to redistribute K+.  [[FIGURE]] Yeast has been employed as a powerful tool to characterize the functions of plant transporters (Anderson et al. CITATION; Hall et al. CITATION; Padmanaban et al. CITATION; Zhao et al. CITATION; Zhao & Dixon CITATION; Evans et al. CITATION). To further characterize the function of CHX14, we expressed CHX14 in various yeast mutants. In most yeast strains such as W303A, 59m15 (trk1 trk2), Nha1 (nha1), AXT3 (trk1 trk2 nhx1 kha1) and KTA40‐2 (ena1‐4 nha1 nhx1 kha1) (Maresova & Sychrova CITATION, Supporting Information Figs S8 & S9), CHX14 expression did not strongly complement the K+/Na+ phenotypes of these mutants. However, there were subtle K+ related phenotypes caused by CHX14 expression. For example, we were able to obtain a phenotype in the yeast mutant (LMM04) that lacks functional TRK1, TRK2 and KHA1 and displays high sensitivity to lower K+ under acidic conditions (Maresova & Sychrova CITATION). When vector controls and CHX14 were expressed in LMM04, both yeast strains grew indistinguishably in media supplemented with 200 mM KCl (Fig. 6a), whereas vector controls were not able to grow in the media without addition of KCl (Fig. 6a; Maresova & Sychrova CITATION). Expression of AtKAT1, coding an inward‐rectifying Arabidopsis K+ channel, could suppress the hypersensitivity of LMM04 to lower K+ (Nakamura et al., CITATION; Zhao et al. CITATION). While CHX13 can suppress the mutant phenotype (Zhao et al. CITATION), CHX14 could not (Fig. 6a). In fact, the CHX14‐expressing cells were more sensitive than the vector controls to the lower K+‐containing media. This observation implies a distinct role for CHX14 in K+ homeostasis. The accumulation profile of several elements (Ca, K, Na, P) was determined in these yeast strains (Chao et al. CITATION). As shown previously (Zhao et al. CITATION), K+ content in KAT1‐expressing cells was significantly higher than that of the vector controls, while the CHX14‐expressing cells accumulated less K+ under these growth conditions (Fig. 6b , P < 0.05), suggesting that CHX14 expression can reduce K+ accumulation in yeast.  [[FIGURE]] We then performed K+ uptake using radioactive 86Rb+ as a tracer to test CHX14 function in LMM04 cells (Zhao et al. CITATION). We compared 86Rb+ uptake of LMM04 cells expressing the empty vector and cells expressing CHX14. Under 0.02 mM (Fig. 6c) and 20 mM (Fig. 6d) external K+, KAT1‐ or AtCHX13‐expressing cells displayed higher K+ uptake rates compared with vector controls (Zhao et al. CITATION), whereas K+ uptake by CHX14‐expressing cells was lower than vector controls (Fig. 6e), suggesting that CHX14 has separate functions from KAT1 and AtCHX13. We then performed kinetic analysis to monitor K+ efflux. Initial uptake rates (within the first 5 min of K+ addition) were plotted as a function of external K+ concentration (Fig. 6e). K+ uptake in CHX14‐expressing yeast was clearly lower than the vector control. We inferred CHX14‐mediated K+ efflux rates through the difference in uptakes rates between CHX14‐ and vector‐expressing yeast cells (Fig. 6f). Reciprocal plots for CHX14‐expressing yeast cells showed a Km for K+ of 5222.7μM and Vmax of 50.4 nmol h−1 10−7 cells (Fig. 6f). We then tested the mode of CHX14‐mediated K+ efflux. Similarly, we found that pH and CCCP, a protonophore, significantly affected CHX14‐mediated K+ efflux, which was higher at pH 7.3 relative to pH 4.3, and CCCP reduced K+ uptake. Glucose had little to no effect on these measurements, suggesting that energy from carbon metabolites was not limiting and K+ uptake was dependent on a pH gradient (alkali outside).To further test K+ efflux activity of CHX14, we expressed CHX14 in nha1 mutant cells, which are deficient in plasma membrane K+/Na+ efflux. Null trk1 trk2 mutants of S. cerevisiae exhibit a low‐affinity uptake of K+ and Rb+. When CHX14 was expressed in trk1 trk2 mutant strain 59m15, CHX14 expression caused yeast cells to more sensitive to K+‐deficiencies (Supporting Information Fig. S8).Furthermore, when expressed in wild‐type strain W303A, CHX14 made cells more resistant to high concentrations of K+ (1.5 M) (Supporting Information Fig. S9). Although CHX14 could not completely suppress the sensitivity of nha1 mutant cells to high concentrations of K+, we could assay CHX14‐mediated K+ efflux in nha1 mutant cells. Measuring the K+ release from CHX14‐expressing nha1 mutant cells loaded with high concentrations of K+ also showed that CHX14‐mediated a pH‐ and proton gradient‐dependent K+ efflux transport. This was consistent with a mechanism by which CHX14 mediates K+ efflux under alkali conditions in other yeast cells (Fig. 6).  To determine the subcellular localization of CHX14, we expressed CHX14 as a fusion protein with the N‐terminus of the GFP. The addition of GFP did not appear to alter the function of CHX14 since GFP‐CHX14‐expressing yeast cells grew in a manner indistinguishable from CHX14‐expressing cells (Supporting Information Fig. S10). CHX14‐GFP expression in yeast cells showed similar localization with CHX13‐GFP [i.e. predominately at the peripheral ring consistent with plasma membrane localization (Zhao et al. CITATION, Fig. 7a) ] in contrast to the uniform cytoplasmic labelling in cells expressing GFP only (Fig. 7b). The CHX14‐GFP fusion proteins under the control of the 35S promoter were transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells by biolistic transformation (Fig. 7c). When imaged by confocal microscopy, CHX14‐GFP expressing cells displayed intense fluorescence confined to the cell periphery, which is strongly indicative of plasma membrane localization. To exclude the possibility that CHX14‐GFP is localized to the cell wall, onion cells were plasmolysed by treatment with 1 M sucrose. The fluorescence in the plasmolysed cells detached from the cell wall, consistent with the premise that the CHX14‐GFP signal was not emanating from the cell wall (Fig. 7d–e). Also similar to the signal from CHX13‐GFP, CHX14‐GFP signal showed strong plasma membrane localization rather than tonoplast localization (Zhao et al. CITATION, Fig. 7e).  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! CHX14 T‐DNA insertion mutant lines in the Columbia (Col‐0) ecotype were obtained by screening SAIL lines (www.arabidopsis.org/abrc/). SAIL_825_E02 (chx14‐1) and SAIL_770_E01 (chx14‐2) were confirmed using T‐DNA primers in combination with a CHX14 specific primer 5′‐ACGGTTGCTGTGAAGATCAC‐3′. The chx13/chx14 double mutants were obtained by crossing chx13‐1 and chx14‐2 using homozygous chx13‐1 allele as a maternal and the chx14‐2 allele as the paternal. The homozygous lines of chx13/chx14 were identified by PCR and used for analysis.  CHX14 DNAs were cloned from a cDNA library generated from pollen (Sze et al. CITATION). The CHX14 cDNA was PCR cloned from the same pollen cDNA library using a forward primer 5′‐GGT ACC ACT AGT ATG TCA AAG CTA GAC CTG GAG GAGG‐3′(Spe1 site underlined) and reverse primer 5′‐CCG CGG TTA ACG GTT TGC TGT GAA GAT CAA CAG ‐3′ (Sst II site underlined). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐tagged versions of CHX14 were made using PCR. CHX14 was amplified using a forward primer CHX14‐GFP5, 5′‐GGT ACC ACT AGT ATG TCA AAG CTA GAC CTG GAG GAGG‐3′ (Spe I site underlined)and a reverse primer CHX14 GFP3, 5′‐GAA TTC GC GGC CGC ACG GTT GCT GTG AAG ATC AAC AGA AG‐3′ (Not I site underlined). These PCR products were sequenced and ligated into the yeast p3040‐GFP vector at Spe I and Not I sites. The resulting constructs contained the CHX14 reading frame fused to the 5′end of the GFP open reading frame. All clones were confirmed by sequencing and transformed into yeast. Plant transient expression constructs were generated by PCR amplification using the yeast CHX14‐GFP plasmid DNA as templates. CHX14‐GFP was amplified with forward primer 5′‐ GC GGCC AAA TCG GCCATG TCA AAG CTA GAC CTG GAG GAGG‐3′(Sfi I A site underlined) and reverse primer 5′‐CG GGC CCT TAT GGCCTAA TAA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT ‐3′ (Sfi I B site underlined). CHX14‐GFP fusion was inserted into a transient expression vector pRTL at the Sfi I site. Resulting constructs harboured the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter driving CHX14‐GFP followed by the NOS terminator. These plasmids were used for transient expression in onion and tobacco epidermal cells. Stable 35S::CHX14 constructs for expression in plants were generated by recombination cloning as previously described (Clough & Bent CITATION; Shigaki et al. CITATION). Third‐generation BASTA (Phosphinothricin or glufosinate ammonoium) resistant lines were verified by RT‐PCR analysis.  K+ deficiency medium was made with modified one‐half‐strength MS medium with KNO3 replaced with of BTP{1,3‐bis[tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamino]propane}‐NO3 and KI replaced with NaI. The K+ concentration in the medium was adjusted by mixing specific amounts of MS medium and K‐free NBT‐NO3 media. The high K+ stress medium was made with 50, 100, 150 mM KCl. The agar plates contained 0.8% agar, and 1% sucrose. The pH value of the medium was adjusted with 5 mM Tris‐MES or 5 mM MES to pH 4.5, pH 5.6, and pH 7.5. Arabidopsis thaliana Col‐0 seeds were used as wild‐type. Col‐0, chx14‐1, chx14‐2, chx13/chx14 and 35S::CHX14 (or CHX14OE) seeds were germinated on K+‐deficient media and incubated in the growth chamber at 16 h light/8 h dark cycles at 22 °C. Plant phenotypes were recorded after 3–4 weeks. Total chlorophyll content was extracted from seedlings with 90% acetone, and chlorophyll a and b were measured as previously described (Zhao et al. CITATION). Seedlings were removed and blotted dry with tissue prior to determining biomass. Biomass of plant seedlings was expressed as fresh weight per 20 seedlings.  As described previously (Zhao et al. CITATION), 4‐day‐old wild‐type (Col‐0), chx14‐1, chx14‐2, 35S::CHX14 line seedlings in one‐half strength MS medium were transferred to one‐half strength MS plates with or without various concentrations of KCl for root elongation assays and ion analysis.  For yeast ion content analysis, yeast mutant cells expressing CHX14, KAT1 or empty vector were incubated in SC media for overnight, and 2 mL of cultures were inoculated into 300 mL YPD medium with or without supplement of KCl for overnight. All cultures grown to similar cell densities were washed with deionized water for three times (Zhao et al. CITATION, CITATION). For plant ion content analysis, CHX14 mutants and wild‐type control (Col‐0) were grown in soil (Sunshine 360) at 22 °C with continuous fluorescent light. Plant materials were washed in ice‐cold 10 mM CaCl2 solution for 20 min before three times of deionized water washing. Yeast and plant samples were dried for ionome analysis using ICP‐MS (Spectro, Kleve, Germany).  For RNA analysis, Col‐0 seeds were germinated in soil (Metro‐Mix 360, Marysville, OH, USA) and grown under continuous light. Two‐week‐old seedlings were washed with water and then floated in the metal containing media for 16 h. RNA was extracted from tissues using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Ten μg of total RNA was separated on a formaldehyde‐containing 1.0% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with a 32P‐labelled full‐length cDNA probe and washed twice with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS (both at 65 °C). Membranes were imaged on a Phosphor Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).CHX14::GUS reporter lines were generated as described previously (Sze et al. CITATION), and seeds were germinated on one‐half‐strength MS agar plates (10 mM K+) for one week, and then seedlings were transferred to K+‐deficient plates (0 mM K+), or K+‐stress (50 mM K+ and 100 mM K+) conditions. Seedlings were harvested regularly to monitor GUS expression. GUS staining of transgenic seedlings was conducted as previously described (Sze et al. CITATION). Samples were photographed using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) E600W microscope.  Four‐week‐old Col‐0 seedlings were used for K+‐stress treatment, Col‐0 seedlings were grown on one‐half‐strength MS for 1 week under 16 h light/8 h dark cycles, then transferred to K+‐deficient plates (0 or 2 mM K+), and K+‐containing plates (50 and 100 mM K+). Whole seedlings were harvested daily to monitor gene expression. Total RNA was isolated from root, root–shoot junction tissues, stem, petiole, leaf, flower and siliques of Arabidopsis using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II RNase H‐reverse transcriptase kit using oligo(dT)12–18 as primer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with the following program: 94 °C for 2 min to denature DNA, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s) and 72 °C (60 s), followed by 72 °C for 10 min extension. ACTIN 1 was used as control. ACTIN 1: forward primer 5'‐GTGCTCGACTCTGGAGATGGTGTG‐3'and reverse primer 5'‐CGGCGATTCCA GGGAACATTGTGG‐3'; CHX14 forward primer P1, 5′‐CGTGAAGATCATTGAGGCCGTTATAC‐3′ and reverse primer P2, 5′‐ ACGGATTGATGGGTTCACGTGGTCT‐3′. For real‐time qRT‐PCR, 3 μL of diluted cDNA was used for PCR. Primer pairs listed in Supporting Information Table S2 (online) were used for real‐time quantification by an iQ5 multicolour real‐time PCR detection system (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Individual PCR reaction mixtures contained 1 μL of diluted cDNA, 10 μL of SYBR Green Master mix (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 250 μM of each primer in a final volume of 10 μL. In all experiments, three biological replicates of each sample and two technical (PCR) replicates were performed. Data were analysed with iQ®5 Optical System Design Software by the comparative ΔCT method. The amount of target genes was normalized over the abundance of the constitutive ACTIN. Three biological replicates were analysed. A forward primer CHX14qRT5:5′‐TAGACGGGACGGTAGACCAC‐3′ and reverse primer CHX14qRT3:5′‐GTAGCTCATGAGGACCGAGC‐3′ for CHX14, and a forward primer ACTIN2qRT5:5′‐TGGATATCAGGAAGGATCTG‐3′ and reverse primer ACTIN2qRT3: 5′‐GTGCAACGACCTTAATCTTC‐3′ for ACTIN2 (At3g18780).  Five μg of plasmid DNA containing the 35S::GFP and 35S::CHX14‐GFP were mixed with 20 μL of an aqueous suspension containing 1.6 μm gold particles. The gold–DNA suspensions were vortexed in the presence of CaCl2 and spermidine and incubated on ice. After centrifugation, the plasmid‐coated gold particles were washed and resuspended in ethanol. The gold was spread onto plastic carrier discs for biolistic bombardment of tobacco and onion epidermal cells using a Bio‐Rad 1000/HE particle delivery system. After 12–15 h, GFP from the epidermal cells of tobacco leaves and onion were imaged with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS Laser Confocal Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA, USA). GFP was excited with the 488 nm line of the Argon laser and emission was detected at 520 nm.  To characterize the K+‐transport activities of CHX14 in plants a rubidium‐86 tracer experiments was performed as previously described (Zhao et al. CITATION). The 86RbCl salt with a specific activity of 7.85 mCi mg−1 was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA, USA). Plants were grown hydroponically for 7 d in sterile flasks on B5 medium, 2% sucrose and 0.05% MES, pH 5.7. Seedlings were harvested and preincubated for 2 d in low K+MS medium. 86Rb+‐uptake assays were conducted in low K+MS medium (pH value varying from 4.3 to 7.5, adjusted with 5 mM MES or Tris), supplemented with 0.5 μCi rubidium86 and various concentrations of KCl (0.02 or 20.0 mM). Samples (about six seedlings) were taken at 10, 20, 30, 60, 80, 100, 120 min, respectively, washed with 3 × 10 mL K+‐free MS medium, and then placed for 20 min in 40 mL of ice‐cold low K+‐MS medium. Subsequently, the seedlings were blotted on filter paper, weighed and activity measured using a scintillation counter. For kinetic analysis, seedlings were incubated in various external K+ concentrations (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000 μM). Uptake lasted for 10 min and then seedlings were washed as described earlier for radioactivity counting. The different pH of the uptake medium containing was adjusted using 5 mM MES or Tris. Their effects on CHX14‐mediated K+ efflux were calculated by subtracting the uptake in 35S::CHX14 seedlings from that of vector control under pH 7.3. Protonophore carbonyl cyanide m‐chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to the uptake assay (pH 7.5) 5 min prior to 86Rb tracer addition. After 5 min of uptake, samples were filtered and washed with 10 mM RbCl for scintillation counting. All uptake experiments were performed in duplicate with three independent replicates.

CITATION) and nha1 mutant (nha1::LEU2) (Kinclová‐Zimmermannova et al. CITATION) were used to characterize and CHX14. LMM04 or 59m15 cells expressing CHX14, KAT1, CHX14‐GFP, or empty vector were grown in SC‐Ura medium containing 100 mM KCl at 30 °C overnight. Yeast nha1 mutant cells expressing vector or CHX14 and wild‐type yeast strain W303 were grown in SC‐Ura medium at 30 °C overnight. Fivefold serial dilutions were prepared from the saturated yeast cultures and 3 μL aliquots of each dilution were spotted on SC‐Ura plates with or without various concentrations of KCl under different pH conditions (Maresova & Sychrova CITATION). The pH of SC media was adjusted with 5 mM MES for pH 4.5 and 6.0 and 5.0 mM Tris‐HCl buffer for pH 7.5. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 4 d.  Yeast cation analysis was performed as previous described (Eide et al. CITATION). Yeast LMM04 cells expressing CHX14 or empty vector, were grown overnight in 5 mL SC–Ura medium supplemented with 100 mM KCl. After rinsing and diluting with K+‐free SC‐Ura medium, 100 μL of yeast cells were inoculated into 5 mL fresh SC‐Ura medium supplemented with 5 mM K+ and grown at 30 °C overnight. About 2.5 mL of the yeast cultures were collected by vacuum filtration using isopore membrane filters (1.2 μm pore size; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Cells were washed three times with 1 mL of 1 μM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt solution, pH 8.0, followed by three washes with 1 mL of deionized H2O. The filters were dried in a 70 °C oven for 48 h for ICP‐AES analysis (Chao et al. CITATION).  For observation of CHX14‐GFP signals, the yeast harbouring CHX14‐GFP fusions were grown in SC‐His‐Leu medium overnight. The yeast cells were viewed under laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview, FV 500, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). An Argon laser beam was used for excitation at 488 nm and GFP visualization with emission at 525 nm.  To characterize the K+‐transport activities of CHX14, K+ uptake in yeast cells using 86Rb+ tracer experiments was performed (Zhao et al. CITATION). LMM04 yeast cells expressing vector, CHX14, and KAT1 were grown to mid‐log phase in the uracil‐deficient SC medium containing 50 mM KCl. Cells were harvested and washed and K+ starved in low salt Arginine‐phosphorous medium (Rodríguez‐Navarro & Ramos CITATION) for 5 h before the uptake assay. For the time‐course study, 5 × 108 cells were added to 50 mL of the uptake solution (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 μCi of 86Rb+ per mL and 0.02 and 20 mM KCl in culture flasks and gently shaken. A fraction of the cells was harvested at the indicated times. For kinetic studies, 107 cells were used in each uptake sample in a 1 mL solution containing 0.5 μCi 86Rb+ and various concentrations of KCl. The 86Rb+ radioactivity taken up into the cells was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (model LS6000IC; Beckman Instruments, Allendale, NJ, USA). For comparison of Rb+ and K+ affinity, Rb+ uptake in the standard reaction with 86Rb+ tracer plus cold K+ or cold Rb+ at the same concentrations of 0.02, 2.0 and 20.0 mM was conducted. The different pH of the uptake medium containing 10 mM Glucose was adjusted using 5 mM MES or Tris. The effect of glucose on CHX14‐mediated K+‐efflux was tested by comparison of uptake in 10 mM glucose with that after depletion of 10 mM Glucose from uptake buffer under pH 7.5. The protonophore CCCP was added to the yeast cells in uptake medium 5 min prior to K+ and 86Rb+ tracer addition. After 10 min of uptake, samples were filtered and washed with 10 mM RbCl for scintillation counting. All uptake experiments were performed in duplicate with three independent replicates.  All uptake experiments were performed in duplicate with three independent replicates (unless otherwise noted).  Nha1 mutant (W303 nha1::LEU2) (Banuelos et al. CITATION; Zahrádka & Sychrová CITATION) cells expressing CHX14 and empty vector were grown overnight in YNB +500 mM KCl (OD600 ≈ 0.5). Yeast cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in 1/2 strength of fresh YNB adjusted with the assay buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM RbCl, 10 mM glucose, pH values were adjusted with citric acid). Culture (cells plus medium) was withdrawn at t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min, collected by filtration using Millipore filters and processed as described earlier.
