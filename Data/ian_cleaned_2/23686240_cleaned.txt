!~ABS~! The positioning and density of leaf stomata are regulated by three secretory peptides, EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 1 (EPF1), EPF2 and stomagen. Several lines of published evidence have suggested a regulatory pathway as follows. EPF1 and EPF2 are perceived by receptor complexes consisting of a receptor-like protein, TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM), and receptor kinases, ERECTA (ER), ERECTA-LIKE (ERL) 1 and ERL2. These receptors activate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase module. MAP kinases phosphorylate and destabilize the transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH), resulting in a decrease in the number of stomatal lineage cells. Stomagen acts antagonistically to EPF1 and EPF2. However, there is no direct evidence that EPF1 and EPF2 activate or that stomagen inactivates the MAP kinase cascade, through which they might regulate the SPCH level. Experimental modulation of these peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana would change the number of stomatal lineage cells in developing leaves, which in turn would change the expression of SPCH, making the interpretation difficult. Here we reconstructed this signaling pathway in differentiated leaf cells of Nicotiana benthamiana to examine signaling without the confounding effect of cell type change. We show that EPF1 and EPF2 are able to activate the MAP kinase MPK6, and that both EPF1 and EPF2 are able to decrease the SPCH level, whereas stomagen is able to increase it. Our data also suggest that EPF1 can be recognized by TMM together with any ER family receptor kinase, whereas EPF2 can be recognized by TMM together with ERL1 or ERL2, but not by TMM together with ER.
!~RES~! To validate the suitability of transient gene expression in N. benthamiana for our purpose, we first confirmed the expression of all GFP (green fluorescent protein) constructs (EPF1, EPF2, TMM, ER, ERL1, ERL2 and SPCH) and TMM-TdTomato in mature N. benthamiana leaves by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1) and by Western blotting (for GFP fusion proteins, ERL2-HA and EPF2-Myc; Supplementary Fig. S2). Hereafter, we omit ‘GFP’ in construct/protein descriptions. We detected GFP in the nucleus, cell margin and cytoplasm (Fig. 1A); EPF1, EPF2 and stomagen in the apoplast (Fig. 1B–D); receptor-like components (TMM-TdTomato, TMM, ER, ERL1 and ERL2) at the cell margins (Fig. 1E–I, F′–I′); and the transcription factor SPCH in the nuclei (Fig. 1J, J′). Bands of expected molecular weights were detected for all GFP fusion proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2), although putative cleavage products of fusion proteins were also detected.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We planned to use the levels of recombinant SPCH (as detected by Western blotting) as a read-out in our experiments. A drawback of the transient expression system is that transformation efficiency sometimes varies. To compare SPCH produced in different samples, we used normalization to phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT), encoded by the same plasmid as SPCH. Control experiments showed that PAT was not produced in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, but was only expressed in Agrobacterium-infiltrated N. benthamiana (Fig. 1K). We used the constitutive Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter to express all genes. We examined the effect of EPF1, EPF2, STOMAGEN, TMM, ER, ERL1 and ERL2 on SPCH transcript levels. The SPCH transcript level was unchanged by the expression of EPF1, EPF2, STOMAGEN, TMM or each of the ER family genes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Unexpectedly, expression of the receptor components TMM, ER, ERL1 and ERL2 with SPCH increased SPCH protein levels (Fig. 2). It is possible that receptor components expressed without ligands interfere with the endogenous MAP kinase pathway of N. benthamiana. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] SPCH was co-transformed with STOMAGEN and one or two of TMM, ER, ERL1 and ERL2, and SPCH protein levels were examined (Fig. 3A, C–E). STOMAGEN alone increased the SPCH level, indicating that differentiated leaf cells of N. benthamiana have a machinery that can perceive stomagen. Co-expression of TMM and STOMAGEN further increased SPCH levels (Fig. 3A). Co-infiltration of the synthetic stomagen peptide (the mature 45 amino acid form) was also effective (Fig. 3B). STOMAGEN did not further increase the SPCH level when co-transformed with ER or ERL1 alone (Fig. 3C). However, STOMAGEN co-transformed with ER and TMM or with ERL1 and TMM increased the level of SPCH (Fig. 3D). We next examined the effect of ERL2 on the STOMAGEN-mediated increase in SPCH levels. STOMAGEN did not further increase the SPCH level when TMM and ERL2 were co-transformed (Fig. 3E).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] EPF1 expression with or without TMM decreased the SPCH protein level (Fig. 4A), indicating that differentiated leaf cells of N. benthamiana possess a machinery to perceive not only stomagen, but also EPF1. However, EPF1 co-expression with ER or ERL1 did not change the SPCH level (Fig. 4B). We reasoned that, in the absence of overexpressed TMM, ER and ERL1 might either sequester EPF1 or inhibit the MAPK cascade, and thereby inhibit SPCH degradation. EPF1 decreased the SPCH level in the presence of ER and TMM, ERL1 and TMM (Fig. 4C) or ERL2 and TMM (Fig. 4D) combinations. These results provide evidence that either of ER, ERL1 or ERL2, in combination with TMM, can mediate the EPF1 signal.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] EPF2–GFP could not be detected by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S4), perhaps because the fusion protein is unstable. Therefore, we used EPF2-10X Myc fusion genes in this experiment. The Myc signal was clearly detected by Western blotting (Fig. 5). EPF2-10X Myc alone or in the presence of TMM did not affect the SPCH protein level (Fig. 5A). EPF2-10X Myc with either ER or ERL1 also had no effect on the SPCH level (Fig. 5B). EPF2-10X Myc did not affect the SPCH level when co-transformed with ER and TMM, but EPF2-10X Myc decreased the SPCH level when co-transformed with ERL1 and TMM (Fig. 5C), or with ERL2 and TMM (Fig. 5D). These results may reflect the ligand–receptor specificity. Although EPF2–GFP signals were not clearly detected in Western blotting, it had similar a effect to EPF2-10X Myc (Supplementary Fig. S4). It is possible that an undetectable amount of EPF2–GFP was effective.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] SPCH can be a substrate of MPK3 and MPK6 (CITATION). We examined whether EPF1 or EPF2 affect MPK6 activation, which is a major MAP kinase functioning in stomatal lineage precursors. We immunoprecipitated MPK6-FLAG with anti-FLAG antibody. We detected its active (phosphorylated) form by Western blotting with anti-phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody and detected total MPK6 with anti-FLAG antibody. In the presence of TMM, EPF1 (but not EPF2 or STOMAGEN) increased the phosphorylated form of MPK6, suggesting that EPF1 activated MPK6 (Fig. 6A).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we examined the effect of EPF1, EPF2 and STOMAGEN on MPK6 activation in the presence of ER and TMM, and found that only EPF1 activated MPK6 (Fig. 6B). This is consistent with the data showing that EPF1 but not EPF2 decreases the SPCH level in the presence of ER and TMM. We also examined the role of ERL1. Both EPF1 and EPF2 activated MAP kinase in the presence of TMM and ERL1 (Fig. 6C). This is consistent with the data showing that EPF2 decreases SPCH protein levels in the presence of TMM and ERL1. STOMAGEN did not affect the activity of MPK6. STOMAGEN might inactivate other MAP kinases including MPK3, which can phosphorylate SPCH (CITATION).
!~MM~! Nicotiana benthamiana seeds were germinated on plates with GM medium [Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 1% sucrose, 1/100 vol. of 2.5% MES-KOH, pH 5.7, 0.3% Phytagel] under continuous light at 22°C. Twelve-day-old plants were transferred to vermiculite supplemented with half-strength MS. Fully expanded leaves of 1-month-old plants were used for infiltration. Genomic sequences of genes (Supplementary Table S3) were amplified by PCR with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. SPCH was cloned into the pKH1 vector, which carries PAT under control of the nopaline synthase (nos) promoter. All other genes were cloned in vectors carrying genes for kanamycin or hygromycin resistance. All genes of interest were under control of the duplicated CaMV 35S promoter. Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells (strain GV3101 MP90) carrying expression constructs were grown in YEP medium [1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto peptone (Difco), 0.5% NaCl] with appropriate antibiotics. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The pellets were re-suspended in the infiltration buffer (10 mM MES, pH 5.7, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 µM acetosyringone). Culture densities were adjusted to an OD600 of 1.0, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 4–5 h prior to infiltration. Equal volumes of cultures carrying different constructs were mixed. To enhance expression, a culture of A. tumefaciens cells carrying a suppressor of gene silencing p19 was added (at OD600 of 1.0) to the above mixture at a 1:1 ratio. The resulting mixture was infiltrated into fully expanded leaves of N. benthamiana. Plants were kept as described above and analyzed 72 h after infiltration. The same leaves were used for RNA purification and protein extraction. The stomagen peptide was synthesized as described by CITATION or purchased from GenScript USA Inc. It was purified and refolded according to either of the two published protocols (CITATION, CITATION). Stomagen at 100 nM was infiltrated into N. benthamiana together with A. tumefaciens cells. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was determined spectrophotometrically (A260/A280 >1.8). RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1 µg) was reverse-transcribed in a 20 µl reaction mixture by using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). After the reaction, 10 µl of the reaction mixture was diluted with 50 µl of water. PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. PAT was used as control. Protein extraction was performed according to CITATION with some modifications. Agro-infiltrated leaves of N. benthamiana were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Equal amounts of powder were homogenized in 2 vols. (w/v) of the extraction buffer [100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque)]. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and supernatants were used for immunoblotting. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE subsequently electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare), which was blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in TBST buffer [100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20] for 1 h. After a brief wash with TBST, the membrane was incubated with anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and further incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 3 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with TBST. We used primary antibodies anti-GFP (1:2,000 dilution) (11814460001, Roche), anti-Myc (1:2,000 dilution) (631206, Clontech), anti-HA (1:5,000 dilution) (11867423001, Roche) and anti-PAT (1:10,000 dilution) (P0249, Sigma), and secondary antibodies anti-rabbit (1:10,000 dilution) (NA934VS, GE Healthcare), anti-mouse (1:10,000 dilution) (NA931VS, GE Healthcare) and anti-rat (1:10,000 dilution) (NA935V, Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection was performed by using a chemiluminescence assay kit (299-69913, Wako). Total protein was extracted from the infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves with 2 vols. (w/v) of the IP extraction buffer containing 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque). The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. A 1 ml aliquot of the supernatant was incubated with 10 µl of mouse anti-FLAG antibody (F3165, Sigma) at 4°C for 4 h on a rotary shaker. Then 20 µl of Protein G Dynabeads (100.04D, Invitrogen) was added, and samples were incubated on a rotary shaker at 4°C for 2 h. The beads were collected and washed five times with the washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). The immunoprecipitates were eluted with a 2× SDS sample buffer by heating at 97°C for 5 min, and immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blotting (performed as described above) with the anti-FLAG antibody and a rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (9101, Cell Signaling Technology).
