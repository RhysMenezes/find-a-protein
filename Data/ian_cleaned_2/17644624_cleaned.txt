!~ABS~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RTE1 encodes a membrane protein and negatively regulates ethylene responses. Genetic and transformation studies suggest that the function of the wild-type RTE1 is primarily dependent on ETR1 and can be independent on the other receptors. Ethylene insensitivity caused by the overexpression of RTE1 is largely masked by the etr1-7 mutation, but not by any other receptor mutations. The wild-type ETR1 N terminus is sufficient to the activation of the RTE1 function and the ectopic expression of etr1(1–349) restored ethylene insensitivity conferred by 35S∷gRTE1 in etr1-7. The RTE1 N terminus is not essential to the etr1-2 function and the expression of rte1(NΔ49), which has an N-terminal deletion of 49 amino acid residues, restored ethylene insensitivity in etr1-2 rte1-2. The ectopic expression of GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP)-RTE1 conferred ethylene insensitivity in wild type and the GFP fusion displayed fast movement within the cytoplasm. The GFP-RTE1 and EYFP-NAG proteins colocalized and the Brefeldin A treatment caused aggregation of GFP-RTE1, suggesting RTE1 is a Golgi-associated protein. Our results suggest specificity of the RTE1 function to ETR1 and that endomembranes may play a role in the ethylene signal transduction.
!~RES~! Ethylene insensitivity conferred by the RTE1 overexpression is almost masked by the etr1-7 null mutation (CITATION). Arabidopsis has five ethylene receptor genes and they are genetically redundant. We investigated if the loss of the other four receptor gene would also inactivate the function of RTE1 overexpression. The 35S promoter-driven genomic RTE1 clone (35S∷gRTE1) was transformed to ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3, in which ETR1 is the only wild-type receptor gene. For three individual transformation lines examined, 35S∷gRTE1 conferred ethylene insensitivity in wild type and ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3 in the seedling triple-response assay (Fig. 1, A and B ). As a control, the untransformed wild-type and quadruple mutants were ethylene responsive and displayed growth inhibition in the seeding hypocotyl and primary root. [[FIGURE]] Ethylene insensitivity conferred by 35S∷gRTE1 was next examined in light-grown seedling. The ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3 mutant exhibited small cotyledons and short primary root when germinated under light (data not shown). As shown in Figure 1C, light-grown 35S∷gRTE1 ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3 transformation lines exhibited normal growth and expanded cotyledons compared with wild type. Because ethylene insensitivity conferred by the overexpression of RTE1 is substantially inactivated by etr1-7, and our results show that the inactivation of the other four receptor genes does not perturb the function of the 35S∷gRTE1 transgene, ethylene insensitivity conferred by the RTE1 overexpression is primarily dependent on ETR1. On the other hand, those lines represent individual transformation events; degrees of the 35S∷RTE1 function affected by the etr1-7 mutation cannot be quantified. To score effects of the inactivation of ETR1 on the function of RTE1 overexpression, the 35S∷gRTE1 transgene was genetically introgressed from individual wild-type transformation lines to etr1-7. As a result, the 35S∷gRTE1 transgene was expressed on the same locus in wild type and etr1-7; effects of the etr1-7 mutation on the function of RTE1 overexpression can be quantitatively evaluated. In one cross, the resulting F1 seedlings exhibited mild ethylene responses (data not shown). In the F2 generation, 39 individual seedlings were classified into three groups according to degrees of ethylene responses (Fig. 1D). According to this classification, we further scored 174 individual F2 seedlings, of which 61 individuals fell into the longest group, 46 into the second, and 67 into the shortest. Because the F1 parent had a reduced hypocotyl length when germinated in ethylene, we suspected that the second group would be 35S∷gRTE1/−;ETR1/etr1-7. Analyzed by χ2 test, this was an expected 5:4:7 segregation (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that dosages of the 35S∷gRTE1 transgene and wild-type ETR1 synergistically determine degrees of ethylene insensitivity. To further study how the copy number of 35S∷gRTE1 and ETR1 would determine degrees of ethylene responses, three individual introgression lineages carrying different copy numbers of 35S∷gRTE1 and ETR1 were scored for the seedling hypocotyl length (Fig. 1F). Lineages homozygous in 35S∷gRTE1 and ETR1 (+/+; +/+) exhibited the longest seedling hypocotyl. The loss of one copy of 35S∷gRTE1 (+/−; +/+) caused a mild reduction in the hypocotyl length. The loss of one copy of ETR1 (+/+; +/−) caused a greater reduction. Seedling hypocotyl of heterozygous lineages (+/−; +/−) was about 40% shorter than that of homozygous lineages (Fig. 1, G and H). When ETR1 was replaced by etr1-7, the hypocotyl was slightly longer than etr1-7 (P < 0.05). These results further indicate that not only is ETR1 gene but also the ETR1 dosage essential to the function of RTE1 overexpression. Specificity of the function of RTE1 overexpression to ETR1 was reciprocally demonstrated in the quadruple and etr1-7 mutants. However, the function of RTE1 overexpression could be hypermorphic or neomorphic; roles of receptor genes in the wild-type RTE1 function will need to be examined in loss-of-function mutants. In this study, the rte1-2 mutation was introgressed to receptor mutants to examine if the inactivation of any receptor genes would result in the inactivation of the wild-type RTE1 gene. Because rte1 mutants phenocopy etr1-7 (CITATION), the etr1-7 mutation was also introgressed to those receptor mutants to examine if ETR1 and RTE1 would have same effects on the repression of ethylene responses. Mutants defective in RTE1 and multiple receptor genes were scored for seedling and adult phenotypes and degrees of ethylene responses were scored by the seedling triple-response assay (Fig. 2, A and C ). To eliminate endogenous ethylene production, the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor l-α-(2-aminoethoxyvinyl) Gly (AVG) was included in the seedling triple-response assay (Fig. 2, B and D). The dark-grown etr2-3 ein4-4 displayed mild ethylene responses; the etr1-7 etr2-3 ein4-4 mutant exhibited stronger ethylene responses than rte1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4. The light-grown etr2-3 ein4-4 seedling was slightly epinastic and the primary root was shorter than that of wild type. rte1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 and etr1-7 etr2-3 ein4-4 were smaller in cotyledons and rosette leaves than etr2-3 ein4-4 (Fig. 2, E and F). Degrees of ethylene responses enhanced by the introgression of etr1-7 to etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3 and ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3 were much greater than that enhanced by the introgression of rte1-2 throughout developmental stages (Fig. 2, A, B, E, and F). The ers1-2 mutant was phenotypically identical to wild type; the introgression of rte1-2 to ers1-2 resulted in enhanced ethylene responses while etr1-7 ers1-2 exhibited extreme phenotypes (Fig. 2, A, B, E, and F). These data suggest that, in a same genetic background, the loss of ETR1 will cause stronger ethylene responses than the loss of RTE1 and that both genes are a negative regulator of ethylene responses. Besides, rte1 does not simply phenocopy etr1-7 as previously described (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Although the inactivation of RTE1 leads to derepression in ethylene responses, the introgression of the rte1-2 mutation to etr1-7 ers2-3 did not alter degrees of ethylene responses in the seedling triple-response assay as well as in other developmental stages (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the previous study that rte1 phenotypically resembles etr1 rte1 mutants (CITATION). These data suggest that the wild-type RTE1 cannot repress ethylene responses in the absence of ETR1. Northern analysis shows that the RTE1 transcript accumulates 2.5 h after ethylene treatment (CITATION). LUCIFERASE (LUC) is labile upon the reaction with its substrate, luciferine, and has been used as a real-time reporter (CITATION). Whole-plant expression pattern of the RTE1 gene in Arabidopsis was next examined in transformation lines expressing LUC, driven by the RTE1 promoter. In dark-grown seedlings, fluorescence was the highest in cotyledons and weaker in hypocotyl and root (Fig. 3A ). Figure 3B shows 3-week-old plants that displayed the strongest fluorescence in growing young leaves (Fig. 3C). Figure 3D shows that developing leaves, leaf veins, rachis, and flowers exhibited strong fluorescence in an adult plant. Tissues between veins in expanded leaves exhibited weaker fluorescence. For light-grown seedlings, cotyledons and developing leaves exhibited the highest fluorescence than hypocotyls and roots (Fig. 3E). [[FIGURE]] In northern analysis, the RTE1 hybridization signal appears as a doublet (CITATION), implying the existence of transcripts with two lengths. To further characterize the two transcripts, sequence of the 3′ end of the RTE1 transcript was examined by the 3′ RACE, and we did not identify any alternative polyadenylation site (data not shown). Examined by the 5′ RACE, the RTE1 transcript gave two major amplification signals (Fig. 3F) and the resulting cDNA fragments were sequenced. For three independent 5′ RACE and sequencing, we identified that sequence of the short fragment starts in the second intron and that the long fragment represents the full-length RTE1 transcript (Fig. 3G). Our data show that RTE1 is globally expressed throughout developmental stages and has two transcripts. Although RTE genes are prevalent in higher eukaryotes, domains or motifs of known function are not found in RTE1. RTE1 shares poor similarity with other plant RTE-like proteins in the N terminus (CITATION; CITATION), implying that the N terminus could exhibit functional specificity or be not essential to the RTE1 function. Because the dominant etr1-2 activity is RTE1 dependent (CITATION), functional significance of the RTE1 N terminus can be examined in etr1-2 rte1-2 by expressing mutant rte1 isoforms with deletions in the N terminus. In this study, two rte1 variants with N-terminal deletions were each expressed in etr1-2 rte1-2 and the resulting transformation lines were scored for the seedling triple response. We found that each of the overexpression of rte1(NΔ25) and rte1(NΔ49), encoding rte1 proteins with, respectively, a deletion of 25 and 49 amino acid residues in the N terminus (Fig. 4A ), was able to restore ethylene insensitivity in etr1-2 rte1-2. For three individual transformation lines scored, degrees of ethylene insensitivity in 35S∷rte1(NΔ25) etr1-2 rte1-2 and 35S∷rte1(NΔ49) etr1-2 rte1-2 lines were comparable to that in 35S∷gRTE1 etr1-2 rte1-2 lines (Fig. 4, B and C). [[FIGURE]] These results imply that the RTE1 N terminus may not exhibit functional specificity; rather, nearly 20% of the RTE1 N terminus is not essential to the etr1-2 function. Because the loss of the second transmembrane domain inactivates RTE1 (CITATION), the C terminus cannot be dispensable. Our data show that ETR1 is essential to the RTE1 function; domains on ETR1 that could be essential to the functioning of RTE1 were next examined. The etr1(1–609) transgene encodes a receiver domain-lacking etr1 variant and etr1(1–349) encodes an etr1 variant that has the three transmembrane domains (TMDs) and the GAF domain (CITATION). 35S∷gRTE1 etr1-7 is an introgression line obtained by genetic cross (L6; Fig. 1, G and H) and is ethylene responsive. This line was individually transformed with gETR1, etr1(1–609), and etr1(1–349), and each transgene was driven by the native ETR1 promoter (CITATION; CITATION). Individual lines of the resulting transformants, T:gETR1 35S∷gRTE1 etr1-7(L6), T:etr1(1–609) 35S∷gRTE1 etr1-7(L6), and T:etr1(1–349) 35S∷gRTE1 etr1-7(L6) were subjected to the seedling triple-response assay. Because the 35S∷gRTE1 transgene in these transformation lines was expressed on a same locus, degrees of ethylene response in these lines were determined by the ETR1/etr1 transgene. Germinated in dark, they were all ethylene insensitive and exhibited a long seedling hypocotyl in ethylene (Fig. 5, A and B ). The hypocotyl lengths of these transformation lines were similar, indicating that etr1(1–609) and etr1(1–349) have a same effect as ETR1 on the recovery of ethylene insensitivity conferred by 35S∷gRTE1. [[FIGURE]] These results show that the ETR1 N terminus, including the three transmembrane domains and the GAF domain, is sufficient to the functioning of RTE1 while ETR1 His-kinase and receiver domains can be dispensable. In an attempt to identify the subcellular localization of the RTE1 protein, each of the RTE1 N and C termini was fused with the GFP and ectopically expressed under the control of the native RTE1 or 35S promoter. The RTE1-GFP fusion, of which the RTE1 C terminus was fused with GFP, failed to cause ethylene insensitivity in wild type and to rescue the rte1-2 mutation in rte1-2 etr1-2 (data not shown). The GFP-RTE1 fusion, of which GFP was fused to the N terminus of RTE1, was able to cause some degrees of ethylene insensitivity in wild type and partially rescue the rte1-2 mutation in rte1-2 etr1-2 (Fig. 6, A and B ). The expression of 35S∷GFP-rte1-2 failed to, respectively, restore and confer ethylene insensitivity in etr1-2 rte1-2 and wild type (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] Fluorescence patterns of 35S∷GFP-RTE1- and RTE1p∷GFP-RTE1-transformed wild type were similar to that of the 35S∷GFP-rte1-2 transformed, except that RTE1p∷GFP-RTE1 gave a weaker fluorescence signal (see Supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that the GFP-RTE1 fusion protein is functional and dominant, and that its subcellular localization could be sites where RTE1 exerts its function. Besides, the rte1-2 mutation may cause dysfunction of RTE1, rather than mislocalization as previously proposed (CITATION). Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) shows that the green fluorescence signal of GFP-RTE1 was fast moving, suggesting that its movement is associated with cellular structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6C). Because RTE1 encodes a membrane protein, we next examined if RTE1 may associate with any endomembranes, including the ER and Golgi. GFP-ER, an ER-localized marker, displayed a unique reticular fluorescence pattern that is distinct to GFP-RTE1 and EYFP-NAG (see Supplemental Fig. S2), of which EYFP-NAG was a marker for the Golgi localization (CITATION). When GFP-RTE1 and the Golgi-localized EYFP-NAG were coexpressed in onion epidermal cells, both GFP-RTE1 and EYFP-NAG displayed fast movement and the fluorescence visually overlapped (Fig. 6D). Because the RTE1 function is ETR1 dependent and ETR1 is localized to the ER, we next examined if trace amounts of RTE1 would localize to the ER. By the LSCM, a three-dimensional (3-D) fluorescence pattern was constructed. GFP-RTE1 displayed a similar 3-D pattern as EYFP-NAG and the fluorescence largely located to the Golgi. In addition, weak reticular fluorescence was also visible in small regions (Fig. 6E). This result suggests that GFP-RTE1 is mainly localized to the Golgi; very small amounts of GFP-RTE1 and EYFP-NAG may reside in the ER. According to its size (in micrometers), fast-moving feature, and colocalization with EYFP-NAG, RTE1 appears to predominantly associate with the Golgi. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal toxin and can cause the accumulation of the Golgi, the so-called BFA compartments, and the redistribution of Golgi membranes into the ER in plant cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We next examined if the GFP-RTE1 fusion would respond to BFA treatment. Over a period of 60 min BFA treatment, the GFP-RTE1 fluorescence gradually aggregated (Fig. 6C); as a mock, the 0.5% ethanol, a solvent for BFA, did not alter the distribution of GFP-RTE1 fluorescence in Arabidopsis (Fig. 6C). Effects of ethylene treatment on the RTE1 protein were next examined. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is the immediate precursor of ethylene biosynthesis and has been used to replace the ethylene treatment. For a period of 60 min ACC treatment, the movement, subcellular localization, and fluorescence intensity of the green fluorescence were not noticeably altered in seedlings expressing the 35S∷GFP-RTE1 transgene (Fig. 6C). For prolonged (3 h) ACC treatments, the GFP fluorescence intensity gradually dropped; as a comparison, the water treatment gave a similar drop in the GFP fluorescence in Arabidopsis (Fig. 6F). Our data suggest that the ethylene (ACC) treatment dose not regulate RTE1 at protein levels.
!~MM~! rte1-2 and etr1-2 rte1-2 were from C. Chang (CITATION). etr1-7 ers2-3, rte1-2 etr1-7 ers2-3, rte1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4, rte1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3, rte1-2 ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3, etr1-7 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3, and etr1-7 ers1-2 etr2-3 ein4-4 ers2-3 were obtained by genetic cross and verified by genotyping and sequencing of receptor genes and RTE1. Genotyping of the receptor genes was performed as described (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). For the seedling triple-response assay, seeds were stratified at 4°C for 72 h and then germinated at 22°C for 80 h in the dark with or without 20 μL L−1 of ethylene gas. Ethylene concentrations were measured by gas chromatography (Angilent G2070 ChemStation; Angilent Technologies). For experiments in which endogenous ethylene production was blocked, 10 μm AVG was included. Plants were grown at 16 h light/8 h dark under fluorescent light at 24°C. For seedling measurement, a photo of dark-grown seedlings was taken and hypocotyl lengths were measured by VideoTesT (Moscow). Statistics for data analyses were followed as described (CITATION) and an error rate of 0.001 (unless specified) was used for comparisons throughout this study. Difference between means (for t test and lsd) is considered significant only when the P value is smaller than 10−3. Measurement was represented as the 95% confidence interval of a mean. The genomic RTE1 was obtained by PCR using the primer set gRTE1-F (5′-ATGGATCCGGTTCATTGTACCTTTCTCC-3′) and gRTE1-R (5′-ATGGATCCTCAAGTAATTATGTTCTTAAAACAGTA-3′) and the resulting DNA was cloned to the binary vector pCGN18. The truncated NΔ25-rte1 and NΔ49-rte1 clones were made by PCR described as the following. An RTE1 fragment, namely RTE1(−556) that contains the first exon and intron of RTE1, was first cloned by PCR using primer set gRTE1-F and gRTE1-556-R (5′-AGTCTAGATTCCTAATCACACAAGACAAG-3′). RTE1 fragment amplified by the primer set gRTE1Δ0-F (5′-agTCTAGAAAATGTCACGTGGAAGAGGAGT-3′) and gRTE1-R was cloned to the XbaI site in RTE1(−556), giving rise to the NΔ0RTE1 clone (no deletion). PCR fragment generated by the primer set gRTE1Δ75-F (5′-AGTCTAGAAAATGTCTATACCATCAATAATCGAA-3′) and gRTE1-R was cloned to the XbaI site of RTE1(−556), giving rise to the NΔ25rte1 clone that has a deletion of 25 amino acid residues. PCR fragment generated by the primer set gRTEΔ147-F (5′-AGTCTAGAAAATGAAATTTCCTTGCTGTATAGTT-3′) and gRTE1-R was cloned to the XbaI site of RTE1(−556), giving rise to the NΔ49rte1 clone that has a deletion of 49 amino acid residues. All these clones were verified by sequencing and then subcloned to the binary vector pCGN18. The genomic ETR1, etr1(1–609), and etr1(1–349) clones are as described (CITATION). The EYFP-NAG clone was a gift from B. Scheres. The ER-GFP clone was from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (stock no. CD3-420). Cloning of GFP-RTE1 and GFP-rte1-2 are described as the following. The RTE1 cDNA was cloned by PCR using a cDNA template (C.-K. Wen, unpublished data) and the primer set cRTE1-F (5′-ATGGATCCATGTCACGTGGAAGAGGA-3′) and cRTE1-R (5′-ATGGATCCTCAAGTAATTATGTTCTTAAAACAGTA-3′). The resulting clone was restricted by BamHI and cloned to the BamHI site on pRTL2 (that has the 35S∷mGFP clone) and the resulting GFP-RTE1 cloned was then released by HindIII and subcloned to pCGN1547. The GFP-rte1-2 clone was constructed following the same procedure, except that the rte1-2 cDNA was used as the template for PCR. The RTE1 promoter, namely RTE1p, was cloned by PCR using the primer set RTE1-P-R (5′-CCAAGCTTTTAGATTCCTAATCACACAACAAGAC-3′) and RTE-P-F (5′-AGGTTCTGAATGGTTGCATGTAGAG-3′). LUC was cloned to the BamHI site following the native RTE1 promoter, giving rise to the RTE1p∷LUC clone. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was transformed by flower dip according to CITATION. RNA was isolated as described (CITATION). For the 3′ RACE, an anchored poly(A) primer was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis. For the 5′ RACE, the gene-specific primer RTE1-825-R1 (5′-CCAGGCAAAGAGTAGTAGCGAG-3′) was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis and ploy(G) was added to the 5′ end by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase. Primers RTE1-752-R2 (5′-GACGTGACCACAGCACATGGCA-3′) and RTE1-629-R3 (5′-AGACGGTTCAAACAGTTTGCAA-3′) were, respectively, used for the first and second PCR amplification. The RACE products were purified after fractionation by gel electrophoresis and subjected for sequencing. For the 5′ RACE and sequencing, three individual repeats were performed. The fluorescence generated by LUC was captured by a cold CCD cooled by liquid nitrogen to −110°C (VersArray System, Roper Scientific). Plants to be imaged were pretreated with luciferin (1 mm in 0.01% Triton X-100) for 18 h and retreated before ethylene treatment and fluorescence imaging. LSCM (Carl Zeiss LSM510 META) was performed at the Facility Center of the National Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics in the Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology and the Two-Photon Microscopy Facility (Carl Zeiss LSM510 META) in the Institute of Neuroscience of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences. For the detection of the coexpression of YFP and GFP fusions, fluorescence was separated by linear unmixing to eliminate the fluorescence bleed through. Separation of the green and yellow fluorescence by the linear unmixing algorithm was confirmed; the GFP expression did not show fluorescence signal in the YFP channel and the EYFP-NAG expression did not give signal in the GFP channel (see Supplemental Fig. S3). Colocalization was visually evaluated by merging images of the GFP and YFP. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using Nikon Eclipse E400 (Nikon). Fluorescence filter sets (FITC-3540B-NQF-ZERO, TXRED-4040B-NQF-ZERO, CFP-2432A-NQF, and YFP-2427A-NQF-ZERO) were from Laser 2000 Ltd. Dark-grown seedlings were subjected to microscopy. For BFA treatment, seedlings were immersed in 10 μm of BFA (dissolved in 0.5% ethanol) and subjected to confocal microscopy; 0.5% ethanol was used as a blank control. For ACC treatment, dark-grown seedlings were immerged in 10 μm ACC (dissolved in water) and subjected to confocal microscopy. For the quantitation of the GFP fluorescence in ACC- and water-treated seedlings, images of fluorescent seedlings were taken every 60 min and the intensity was measured. For imaging of the movement of GFP fluorescence, photos were taken every 6 s. For imaging of BFA and ethanol treatments, frames were taken every 3 min. The following materials are available in the online version of this article. Supplemental Figure S1. Fluorescence patterns of GFP-RTE1 and GFP-rte1-2 are similar. Supplemental Figure S2.
