!~ABS~! The RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L10 (RPL10) is an integral component of the eukaryotic ribosome large subunit. Besides being a constituent of ribosomes and participating in protein translation, additional extraribosomal functions in the nucleus have been described for RPL10 in different organisms. Previously, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RPL10 genes are involved in development and translation under ultraviolet B (UV-B) stress. In this work, transgenic plants expressing ProRPL10:β-glucuronidase fusions show that, while AtRPL10A and AtRPL10B are expressed both in the female and male reproductive organs, AtRPL10C expression is restricted to pollen grains. Moreover, the characterization of double rpl10 mutants indicates that the three AtRPL10s differentially contribute to the total RPL10 activity in the male gametophyte. All three AtRPL10 proteins mainly accumulate in the cytosol but also in the nucleus, suggesting extraribosomal functions. After UV-B treatment, only AtRPL10B localization increases in the nuclei. We also here demonstrate that the three AtRPL10 genes can complement a yeast RPL10 mutant. Finally, the involvement of RPL10B and RPL10C in UV-B responses was analyzed by two-dimensional gels followed by mass spectrometry. Overall, our data provide new evidence about the nonredundant roles of RPL10 proteins in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! We have previously shown, by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis, that AtRPL10s are expressed in leaves, roots, stems, and flowers (CITATION). In order to analyze the spatiotemporal expression of AtRPL10s in more detail, we generated transgenic plants expressing the GUS gene under the control of the RPL10A, RPL10B, and RPL10C promoters (ProAtRPL10s:GUS), as described in “Materials and Methods.” Histochemical GUS staining of 7-d-old seedlings reveals a high expression of RPL10A in young leaves, mostly in dividing cells and in the hydathodes (Fig. 1, A and B), while RPL10B and RPL10C expression was not detected in this organ (Fig. 1A). Seven-day-old roots also showed RPL10A expression, mainly in the root tips and lateral root primordia, while expression of RPL10B and RPL10C was not detected (Fig. 1, C and D). In 21-d-old plants, similar expression patterns to 7-d-old seedlings were detected, with GUS staining being present only for RPL10A (Fig. 1E). [[FIGURE]] AtRPL10 genes also show expression differences in the female and male reproductive organs. Expression of AtRPL10A and AtRPL10B was detected in pistils, anthers, and pollen grains (Fig. 1, F and G), while AtRPL10C was only detected in pollen grains (Fig. 1G). In immature siliques, the expression of the three AtRPL10 genes was different. For AtRPL10A, GUS staining was present in the valves, septum, and developing seeds (Fig. 1, H and I), while AtRPL10B expression was limited to developing seeds (Fig. 1, H and J). AtRPL10C also showed expression in developing seeds, but with a weaker intensity than AtRPL10A and AtRPL10B (Fig. 1, H and K). We have previously shown that RPL10A is essential for the female gametophyte, as the mutant alleles cause female gametophyte lethality, while RPL10B has an important role during plant development (CITATION; CITATION). On the contrary, under standard growth conditions, rpl10C single mutants showed a phenotype that is indistinguishable from wild-type plants both at the vegetative and reproductive stages, suggesting functional redundancy within the RPL10 gene family; alternatively, it could have a role under different stress conditions. In order to analyze the functional redundancy between AtRPL10 genes in more detail, we generated double mutants by crossing the single mutants, rpl10B and rpl10C, with rpl10A heterozygous plants (rpl10A/+) as the male parent. The resultant F1 population of the rpl10A/+ with rpl10B (knockdown homozygous for RPL10B) cross produced rpl10A/+ rpl10B/+ (heterozygous for both genes) and RPL10A rpl10B/+ (wild type for RPL10A, heterozygous for RPL10B) at a 1:2 ratio (Supplemental Table S1), indicating a distortion in the transmission of the rpl10A allele through the male gametophyte when the rpl10B alleles are present. Similarly, when rpl10A/+ plants were crossed with rpl10C mutants (knockout homozygous for RPL10C), 67% of progeny had the RPL10A rpl10C/+ genotype, while 33% was rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+ (Supplemental Table S2). This deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio in both crosses indicates that rpl10A has an effect in the transmission through the male gametophyte when the RPL10B or RPL10C gene is mutated. On the contrary, when rpl10B was crossed with rpl10C, the resultant F1 population was 100% heterozygous for RPL10B and RPL10C. We further screened the resultant selfed F2 progeny for rpl10A/+ rpl10B/+, rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+, and rpl10B/+ rpl10C/+ double mutants. Again, the rpl10A allele was transmitted to the progeny at a frequency lower than expected: for rpl10A/+ rpl10B/+ plants, 34% of the progeny included rpl10A/+ RPL10B, rpl10A/+ rpl10B/+, and rpl10A/+ rpl10B mutant plants, while 66% had RPL10A RPL10B, RPL10A rpl10B/+, and RPL10A rpl10B genotypes (Supplemental Table S1). Similarly, for rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+ plants, rpl10A/+ RPL10C, rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+, and rpl10A/+ rpl10C mutants constituted 38% of the total, whereas 62% was represented by RPL10A RPL10C, RPL10A rpl10C/+, and RPL10A rpl10C (Supplemental Table S2). In contrast, the expected frequencies were found for the selfed F2 progeny from the rpl10B/+ rpl10C/+ double mutants (Supplemental Table S3). Moreover, reciprocal crosses of rpl10B/+ rpl10C/+ mutants showed unaffected transmission of the mutant alleles through the female and male gametes, while reciprocal crosses using rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+ and rpl10A/+ rpl10B plants as a male parent yielded unexpected ratios in F1 progeny, confirming the impaired transmission of the rpl10A allele through the male gametophyte (Supplemental Table S4). After genotyping more than 150 F2 plants, rpl10A/+ rpl10C plants were not found, indicating that the presence of at least one functional RPL10C allele is essential for plant viability when one rpl10A allele is present. Moreover, to generate the rpl10 triple mutant (rpl10A/+ rpl10B rpl10C), rpl10A/+ rpl10B mutants were crossed with rpl10B rpl10C mutants as male and female parents, respectively. Siliques did not develop and all had aborted embryos, indicating that the triple mutant is not viable. The rpl10A/+ rpl10B and rpl10B rpl10C double mutants were indistinguishable from their parent rpl10B single mutants. Likewise, rpl10A/+ and rpl10C single mutants and rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+ double mutants looked like wild-type Columbia (Col-0) plants (Supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm the absence of functional compensation in the RPL10 family by variations in their transcript levels, we performed RT-qPCR analysis using RNA from the three double mutants (rpl10A/+ rpl10B, rpl10B rpl10C, and rpl10A/+ rpl10C/+), and similar RPL10 transcript levels were detected in single mutants, double mutants, and wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S2). Arabidopsis RPL10 proteins exhibit 94% to 97% similarity and also share a high degree of primary sequence conservation with other eukaryotic orthologs; for example, they show 62% similarity with S. cerevisiae RPL10 (Supplemental Fig. S3). Based on this, we investigated whether Arabidopsis RPL10 proteins can complement an S. cerevisiae conditional lethal mutant in the RPL10 gene. The AJY2104 strain was used for these experiments, in which the RPL10 gene is expressed from its genomic locus but under the control of the GAL1 promoter; consequently, this strain is unviable under repressing conditions in the presence of Glc, while it grows similarly to the wild-type strain with Gal (CITATION). We expressed the coding region of each AtRPL10 under the control of the constitutive GDP promoter using the expression vector p5AX43 as well as under the control of the endogenous RPL10 promoter using the centromeric vector pRS415. In both cases, the endogenous RPL10 gene was expressed from the same plasmids as positive controls. Serial dilutions of transformed yeast were plated on selective medium with Glc, and simultaneously in the same medium with Gal, to verify the homogenous growth in all cases. The expression of Arabidopsis RPL10 proteins, as well as the endogenous RPL10 protein in transformed strains, was verified by immunoblot assays showing an immunoreactive band in all cases (Supplemental Fig. S4). Figure 2, A and B, shows yeast growth using the p5AX43 expression vector. After incubation for 3 and 4 d at 30°C, complementation was observed with either of the AtRPL10 proteins; however, the rate of growth was lower than the one reached with the endogenous RPL10 protein. [[FIGURE]] When each AtRPL10 was expressed under the control of the endogenous RPL10 promoter, transformed yeast showed the formation of colonies with all the constructs, but the rate of growth was slower than that observed using the GAL1 promoter (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Arabidopsis RPL10 proteins are functionally equivalent to the S. cerevisiae RPL10; the three AtRPL10 proteins can rescue the lethality due to the absence of the endogenous protein. By coimmunoprecipitation studies using Arabidopsis leaves, we have previously demonstrated that RPL10 proteins associate with proteins localized in the nucleus and with proteins involved in cytoplasm-nuclei traffic, suggesting that at least one of the AtRPL10 isoforms may have extraribosomal functions in the nuclei (CITATION). To examine the subcellular localization of each AtRPL10 isoform, we generated Arabidopsis transgenic plants that express each AtRPL10 as a fusion protein to the N terminus of the GFP driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Pro35S:AtRPL10s-GFP constructs). Transgenic plants were selected and examined by RT-qPCR as described in “Materials and Methods” (Supplemental Fig. S5). It should be mentioned that it has been reported that GFP-tagged ribosomal proteins are correctly incorporated into the ribosomes (CITATION). Here, to verify that AtRPL10-GFP fusion proteins are functional in Arabidopsis plants, we transformed the Arabidopsis rpl10B mutants with a construct expressing the AtRPL10B-GFP driven by the 35S promoter. As previously published, these mutants exhibit an abnormal growth phenotype (CITATION). F1 progeny were indistinguishable from wild-type (Col-0) plants and rpl10B/+ mutants, indicating the ability of the AtRPL10B-GFP fusion protein to complement mutant plants in the RPL10B gene and, consequently, the functionality of the AtRPL10B-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis. Thus, given the high identity between RPL10 proteins from Arabidopsis, we assume that all AtRPL10-GFP proteins are functional in Arabidopsis. AtRPL10-GFP fusions were mainly detected in the cytosol, but GFP fluorescence was also detected in the nuclei (stained with 4′,6-diamino-phenylindole [DAPI]; Fig. 3A). All three fusion proteins exhibit a necklace appearance, suggesting their association with rough endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes, as described for the human RPL10 (CITATION). In order to quantify the AtRPL10s-GFP localization in the nucleus, we measured the percentage of nuclei stained with DAPI that also showed detectable GFP fluorescence, as described by CITATION. For all three proteins, approximately 30% of the nuclei had detectable GFP fluorescence, without significant differences between the three RPL10 proteins (Fig. 3B). We also analyzed GFP localization in transgenic plants expressing GFP driven by the 35S promoter (Pro35S:GFP) in order to discard the presence of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus as a result from the cleavage of GFP fusion proteins. In these transgenic plants, GFP was only detected in the cytosol (Supplemental Fig. S6). [[FIGURE]] Previously, we demonstrated that RPL10s were UV-B regulated and RPL10s were involved in translation under UV-B stress (CITATION). Therefore, we examined whether UV-B radiation regulates RPL10 subcellular localization. After 4 h of exposure with UV-B radiation, AtRPL10A and AtRPL10C did not show changes in their subcellular distribution; however, AtRPL10B-GFP fluorescence increased by about 20% in the nuclei after the treatment (Fig. 3B; Supplemental Fig. S7). Both AtRPL10B and AtRPL10C are regulated by UV-B radiation: AtRPL10B is repressed, while AtRPL10C is induced after a 4-h UV-B radiation treatment. In addition, we here show that nuclear localization of AtRPL10B is increased after UV-B irradiation (Fig. 3B). Thus, in order to investigate metabolic processes in which AtRPL10B and AtRPL10C isoforms could be involved and their participation in responses under UV-B stress, we carried out 2D gel electrophoresis to compare changes in the leaf proteome of rpl10C and rpl10B homozygous plants under control conditions in the absence of UV-B and after UV-B irradiation with those in wild-type plants, as reported previously for rpl10A heterozygous mutant plants (CITATION). The differential proteomes were analyzed in two different ways: (1) the proteomes from the mutant plant leaves were compared with those from wild-type plants under the same radiation conditions (no UV-B and UV-B); (2) for each plant type (wild type and mutant), we compared their proteomes under control conditions (no UV-B) and after UV-B irradiation, and only proteins that were differentially UV-B regulated in the wild-type and mutant plants were selected. For rpl10C mutants, a total of 45 protein spots showed differential levels (increased or decreased 1.5-fold or more) in at least one of the comparisons, and interpretable tandem mass spectrometry spectra were obtained for 41 of the 45 spots (Supplemental Table S5). Of these 41 spots, 25 were similarly changed as observed previously in the rpl10A mutants (CITATION), while 16 spots were exclusively differential for the rpl10C mutants. Under control conditions in the absence of UV-B, nine protein spots were increased in rpl10C mutants, while eight protein spots were decreased compared with wild-type plants; however, after a 4-h UV-B treatment, the number of proteins that changed in rpl10C mutants was increased to 38 (12 increased and 26 decreased), indicating that the rpl10C mutation more severely affects protein expression patterns after a UV-B exposure than under control conditions (Fig. 4A). Similarly, when we compared the proteomes of both plants after the UV-B treatment, rpl10C mutant plants exhibited a higher number of proteins that were decreased by UV-B (12 protein spots) than those increased (six protein spots). Also, some proteins that were changed by UV-B in wild-type plants did not show any difference in the mutants after the same treatment (nine protein spots). [[FIGURE]] Total identified proteins (41) were classified according to their functions (Fig. 4A). The functional groups with the largest number of proteins differentially changed in the rpl10C mutants in comparison with the wild-type plants after the UV-B treatment are involved in photosynthesis, stress and detoxification, respiration, protein biosynthesis, and posttranslational mechanisms. Other groups include proteins implicated in DNA metabolism (DNA repair), RNA metabolism (transcription and regulation), signaling, and cell division and cycle. In summary, general processes in plant metabolism and growth are affected in the rpl10C mutant after UV-B exposure, as was observed previously for rpl10A heterozygous mutant plants. Thus, although rpl10C mutants are not more sensitive to UV-B radiation than wild-type plants, these results indicate that RPL10C may also be involved in translation under UV-B conditions. For rpl10B mutants, a total of 43 protein spots showed differential levels (increased or decreased 1.5-fold or more) in at least one of the comparisons. Supplemental Figure S8 shows a representative 2D gel of the proteome of rpl10B mutant leaves after a 4-h UV-B treatment used in one set of comparisons. Interpretable tandem mass spectrometry spectra were obtained for 36 of the 43 spots (Supplemental Table S6). These differential spots were not identified in the same analysis using the rpl10A and rpl10C mutants. Under control conditions in the absence of UV-B, nine protein spots were increased, while eight protein spots were decreased in rpl10B mutants compared with wild-type plants; however, after a 4-h UV-B treatment, the number of proteins that changed in rpl10B mutants was increased to 36 (18 increased and 18 decreased), suggesting, as observed for the rpl10A and rpl10C mutants, that the rpl10B mutation more severely disrupts the protein expression pattern after a UV-B exposure than under control conditions (Fig. 4B). In addition, when we compared the proteomes of wild-type and rpl10B plants after the UV-B treatment, some proteins that changed by UV-B in the wild-type plants did not show any difference in the mutants after the same treatment (17 protein spots). Identified proteins were classified according to their functions (Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S8B). The major group of identified proteins corresponds to proteins involved in stress responses (41% and 36% in control and UV-B conditions, respectively), mainly biotic stress, representing 35% and 23% of the total in control and UV-B conditions, respectively (Fig. 4B). Some proteins can be grouped in more than one process; for example, spot 38 is involved in RNA metabolism and biotic stress, while spot 39 can be grouped with proteins involved in cell division and biotic stress (Supplemental Table S6). Other important groups include proteins implicated in RNA metabolism (transcription and regulation), protein metabolism, photosynthesis, and signaling. It is noteworthy that a high percentage of proteins identified are predicted to be localized in the chloroplast, with a lower proportion in the nucleus. Networks of associations were generated for proteins that showed different levels in rpl10C and rpl10B mutants in comparison with wild-type plants under UV-B stress (Supplemental Fig. S9). In particular, when analyzing the enrichment of any particular biological process in each network, rpl10B mutants showed a significantly larger number of proteins involved in stress responses (Supplemental Fig. S9A). By contrast, rpl10C mutants showed proteins involved in general biological and metabolic processes and a lower percentage of proteins involved in stress responses than rpl10B mutants (Supplemental Fig. S9B). In general, predicted interactions were found between proteins belonging to the same functional group, although some proteins did not show any interaction with proteins in the networks for both mutants.
!~MM~! Following a cold treatment (72 h at 4°C in the dark), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Col-0 plants, transgenic plants, and the T-DNA insertion lines were grown in a growth chamber under light (100 μE m−2 s−1) with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod at 22°C. Arabidopsis plants (wild-type Col-0 and transgenic plants) were also germinated and grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt-agar medium. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and germinated on MS medium, and they were grown after vernalization for 3 d at 4°C. For subcellular localization analysis, plants were grown for 20 d on MS plates supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg L−1). UV-B treatments were done in a growth chamber as described previously (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants (Col-0 and rpl10B and rpl10C mutants) were treated for 4 h with a UV-B intensity of 2 W m−2 and a UV-A intensity of 0.65 W m−2. The UV-B bulbs were covered with cellulose acetate filters (100-mm extra-clear cellulose acetate plastic; Tap Plastics); the cellulose acetate sheeting does not remove any UV-B radiation from the spectrum but excludes wavelengths lower than 300 nm. Control plants without UV-B were exposed for the same period of time under the same UV-B lamps but covered with polyester filters (100-μm clear polyester plastic; Tap Plastics), which absorb both UV-B and wavelengths lower than 280 nm (UV-B, 0.04 W m−2, UV-A, 0.4 W m−2). Samples were collected immediately after irradiation and stored at −80°C. The experiments were repeated at least three times. For subcellular localization studies using Arabidopsis transgenic plants (Pro35S:AtRPL10s-GFP), plants were irradiated as described above. Samples were analyzed immediately after irradiation. The experiments were repeated at least three times. All these experiments were performed as described previously (CITATION). Gel spots of interest were manually excised from the gels and sent to CEBIQUIEM facilities (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires) for further analyses. Spots were subjected to in-gel digestion (donatello.ucsf.edu/ingel.html) with trypsin according to CITATION. The mass spectrometric data were obtained using a matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight/time of flight spectrometer (Ultraflex II; Bruker). The spectra obtained were submitted for National Center for Biotechnology Information database searching using MASCOT (www.matrixscience.com; CITATION) and analyzed as described previously (CITATION). Protein functional classification was carried out according to literature data (CITATION). rpl10A heterozygous (rpl10A/+ and rpl10A-1), rpl10B homozygous (rpl10B-1), and rpl10C homozygous (rpl10C-1) single mutants (CITATION) were crossed, and their resultant F2 populations were screened for rpl10A/+ rpl10B, rpl10A/+ rpl10C, and rpl10B rpl10C double mutants. In order to obtain the triple mutant (rpl10A/+ rpl10B rpl10C), rpl10A/+ rpl10B mutants were crossed with rpl10B rpl10C mutants. The genotypes were determined by PCR on genomic DNA using combinations of specific primers for each gene and one primer that hybridizes with the left border of the T-DNA, as described previously (CITATION). Full-length open reading frames for each AtRPL10 were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) obtained from leaf tissues of wild-type Arabidopsis plants (Col-0). The primers F-KpnI-RPL10 and R-SalI-RPL10 with the KpnI and SalI restriction sites, respectively, were used for further cloning (Supplemental Table S7). PCR was performed with GoTaq (Promega) and Pfu polymerases (Invitrogen; 10:1) under the following conditions: 1× GoTaq buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 µm of each primer, and 0.5 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), in a final volume of 25 μL. The amplified products were purified, cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced. The KpnI-SalI fragments were further subcloned into pCS052_GFP_pCHF3 (a modified version of pCHF3; GFP coding sequence without the start codon is inserted into SalI-PstI sites), generating Pro35S:AtRPL10s-GFP constructs. Full-length open reading frames for GFP were reamplified by PCR using pCS052_GFP_pCHF3 vector as a template under the same conditions described above using the primers F-SalI-GFP and R-PstI-GFP with the SalI and PstI restriction sites, respectively, for further cloning (Supplemental Table S7). PCR product was purified, cut with SalI and PstI restriction enzymes, purified again, and cloned into pCS052_GFP_pCHF3 that had been cut with the same enzyme and purified. The Pro35S:GFP and Pro35S:AtRPL10s-GFP constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation, and the transformation of Arabidopsis (Col-0) and rpl10B single mutants with the resulting bacteria was performed by the floral dip method (CITATION). Transformed seedlings (T1) were identified by selection on solid MS medium containing kanamycin (50 mg L−1), and then the plants were transferred to soil. The presence of Pro35S:GFP and Pro35S:AtRPL10s-GFP transgenes in transformed plants was analyzed by PCR on the genomic DNA using the following combinations of primers: F-35Sprom and a reverse primer specific for each AtRPL10, and forward primers specific for each AtRPL10 and R-PstI-GFP (Supplemental Table S7; Supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). The expression of the AtRPL10s-GFP transgenes in transformed plants was analyzed by RT-qPCR using forward primers specific for each AtRPL10 and R-PstI-GFP (Supplemental Table S7; Supplemental Fig. S5C). PCR conditions were as follows: 1× GoTaq buffer, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.25 μm of each primer, 0.625 units of GoTaq (Promega), and sterile water added to obtain a volume of 25 μL. Cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min of denaturation at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s of denaturation at 95°C, 20 s of annealing at 52°C, 1 min of amplification at 72°C, and finally, 7 min of amplification at 72°C. PCR products were separated on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with SYBR Green (Invitrogen). In each of these transgenic plants, the expression of the other AtRPL10 endogenous genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR as described below, with each transgenic plant showing no significant difference in transcript levels in comparison with wild-type plants (Supplemental Table S7; Supplemental Fig. S5D). Arabidopsis transgenic plants (Pro35S:AtRPL10s-GFP; T2 lines) were grown on MS agar plates for 20 d as described above. To visualize the nuclei, leaves were incubated with 2 µg mL−1 DAPI (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween for 15 min. The fluorescence of GFP and DAPI was visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Nikon C1) under water with a 40× objective. GFP and DAPI were excited using an argon laser at 488 nm and a UV laser at 395 nm, respectively. GFP emission was collected between 515 and 530 nm to avoid cross talk with chloroplast autofluorescence. To analyze the percentage of GFP/DAPI colocalization, each nucleus identified by DAPI fluorescence was examined for GFP fluorescence, and whenever GFP fluorescence was detected, the nucleus was scored as showing colocalization. Thus, the relative intensity of nuclear GFP fluorescence was not considered in these measurements. The percentage of GFP/DAPI was calculated by the relation between the number of nuclei showing GFP localization and the total number of nuclei identified by DAPI fluorescence. For each condition, more than 100 nuclei were analyzed (20 images) from five different plants using two independent T2 transgenic lines. The experiments were repeated at least three times. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AJY2104 strain (MATα kanMX6:GAL1:RPL10 ura-3 leu-2 ade-2 ade-3) has been described previously (CITATION). Yeast were grown in 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) Gal, and 20 mg L−1 adenine. Yeast transformation was made following the Trafo method (CITATION), and transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium agar plates (CITATION) containing 2% (w/v) Gal without Leu (SCGal-L). Transformed colonies appeared within 3 to 4 d at 30°C. For complementation studies, yeast expression plasmids were constructed in pRS415 (LEU-marked centromeric vector) and p5AX43 (LEU-marked vector) as follows. Full-length cDNAs for each AtRPL10 were amplified by PCR as described above using specific primers for each gene; the forward primers included the start codon and BamHI sites, while the reverse primers included the stop codons and the XhoI restriction site (Supplemental Table S7). The amplified products were purified, cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega), generating pGEMT-AtRPL10s constructs, and sequenced. The BamHI-XhoI fragments were subcloned into p5AX43 plasmid, generating the p5AX43-ProGDP:AtRPL10s plasmids. The p5AX43 vector corresponds to a modified version of plasmid YEplac181 (CITATION), in which the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (GDP) was inserted at the HindIII site. The S. cerevisiae RPL10 promoter was amplified by PCR using pAJ2522 plasmid (CITATION) as template and the F-SacI-ScRPL10prom and R-BamHI-ScRPL10prom oligonucleotides (Supplemental Table S7). PCR was performed with GoTaq (Promega) and Pfu polymerases (Invitrogen; 10:1) under the following conditions: 1× GoTaq buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 µm of each primer, and 0.5 mm of each dNTP in a final volume of 25 μL. Cycling conditions were as follows: 5 min of denaturation at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 20 s of denaturation at 95°C, 30 s of annealing at 57°C, 45 s of amplification at 72°C, and finally, 7 min of amplification at 72°C. The PCR product was purified, cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes, cloned into the pRS415 vector, generating the pRS415-ProScRPL10 construct, and sequenced. Then, the AtRPL10s were inserted into this plasmid downstream of the ScRPL10 promoter as follows. pGEMT-AtRPL10s constructs were digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, then BamHI-EcoRI fragments were purified from the gels and ligated into the pRS415-ProScRPL10 construct cut with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. The resulting constructs, named pRS415-ProScRPL10:AtRPL10s, contain AtRPL10 coding sequences downstream of the ScRPL10 promoter. The full-length open reading frame for RPL10 from S. cerevisiae was amplified by PCR using the pAJ2522 plasmid (CITATION) as template and the F-BamHI-ScRPL10 and R-KpnI-ScRPL10 oligonucleotides as primers (Supplemental Table S7). PCR conditions were as described above for the ScRPL10 promoter amplification, with the following modifications: the annealing was at 54°C and the amplification was for 1 min at 72°C. The PCR products were purified, cut with BamHI and KpnI restriction enzymes, purified, and cloned into pRS415-ProScRPL10 vector, generating the pRS415-ProScRPL10:ScRPL10 plasmid. Complementation of the AJY2104 conditional lethal rpl10 mutant yeast with RPL10s from Arabidopsis was evaluated by replica plating to Leu− Glc plates. Single colonies were grown in liquid SCGal-L medium for 48 h at 30°C. An aliquot of the culture was harvested, washed three times with distilled water to remove the Gal medium, and the cells were then inoculated into water to give an initial optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 (this initial solution was considered as 10−1). Then, serial dilutions (10−2, 10−3, 10−4, and 10−5) were prepared, and 10 µL of each dilution was plated as drops on selective medium containing glucose (SCD)-L and SCGal-L plates. Colonies were examined for 7 d and photographed. Cells (2–3 × 108) were resuspended in 0.1 mL of buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (w/v) SDS. Glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) were added, and six series of 1 min of vortex mixing alternating with 1 min of incubation on ice, were performed. Samples were centrifuged to pellet glass beads and cell debris. The supernatants were used for immunoblot analysis. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For immunodetection, yeast extracts were subjected to 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting according to CITATION. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an N-terminal peptide of human QM was used for the detection of RPL10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibody was visualized by linking to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). To make the AtRPL10s promoter:GUS constructs (ProAtRPL10s:GUS), the 5′ flanking DNAs of AtRPL10 coding regions were amplified by PCR with specific primers for each gene with SalI and BamHI restriction sites in the forward and reverse primers, respectively (Supplemental Table S7). The PCR fragments (1,401, 1,267, and 1,506 bp for AtRPL10A, AtRPL10B, and AtRPL10C, respectively) were cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector and sequenced. Then, these constructs were digested with SalI and BamHI restriction sites, and the products were purified from the gels and cloned into pBI101 binary vector, generating pBI101-ProAtRPL10s:GUS constructs. These plasmids were transformed into Col-0 plants as described above. Transgenic plants were selected on solid MS medium containing kanamycin (50 mg L−1). Three independent T3 transgenic lines were used for histochemical analysis. Samples were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-glucuronide at 37°C for 24 h, followed by washes with ethanol, and kept in 50% (v/v) ethanol and 5% (v/v) acetic acid before being photographed. The experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Tissues from three independent biological replicates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was converted into first-strand cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) as a primer in previous treatment with DNase (Promega). The resultant cDNAswere used as a template for quantitative PCR amplification in a MiniOPTICON2 apparatus (Bio-Rad), using the intercalation dye SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) as a fluorescent reporter and Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers were designed to generate unique 150- to 250-bp fragments using the PRIMER3 software (CITATION). Primers for CBP20 were used for normalization. All primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S7. Amplification conditions were as follows: 2 min of denaturation at 94°C; 40 to 45 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 57°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s; followed by 10 min at 72°C. Melting curves for each PCR were determined by measuring the decrease of fluorescence with increasing temperature (from 65°C to 98°C).To confirm the size of the PCR products and to check that they corresponded to unique and expected products, the final products were separated on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel. The data presented were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Minimum significant differences were calculated by the Bonferroni, Holm-Sidak, Dunett, and Duncan tests (P < 0.05) using the Statgraphics Plus 5.0 Software.
