!~ABS~! The transmembrane receptor kinase family is the largest protein kinase family in Arabidopsis, and it contains the highest fraction of proteins with yet uncharacterized functions. Here, we present functions of SIRK1, a receptor kinase that was previously identified with rapid transient phosphorylation after sucrose resupply to sucrose-starved seedlings. SIRK1 was found to be an active kinase with increasing activity in the presence of an external sucrose supply. In sirk1 T-DNA insertional mutants, the sucrose-induced phosphorylation patterns of several membrane proteins were strongly reduced; in particular, pore-gating phosphorylation sites in aquaporins were affected. SIRK1-GFP fusions were found to directly interact with aquaporins in affinity pull-down experiments on microsomal membrane vesicles. Furthermore, protoplast swelling assays of sirk1 mutants and SIRK1-GFP expressing lines confirmed a direct functional interaction of receptor kinase SIRK1 and aquaporins as substrates for phosphorylation. A lack of SIRK1 expression resulted in the failure of mutant protoplasts to control water channel activity upon changes in external sucrose concentrations. We propose that SIRK1 is involved in the regulation of sucrose-specific osmotic responses through direct interaction with and activation of an aquaporin via phosphorylation and that the duration of this response is controlled by phosphorylation-dependent receptor internalization. 
!~RES~! SIRK1 (AT5G10020), a member of the LRR-receptor-like kinase family, showed a significant transient increase in protein phosphorylation of serine 744 after sucrose resupply to sucrose-starved cells (CITATION). In order to study the role of SIRK1 in sucrose-induced phosphorylation processes, we made use of a sirk1 T-DNA insertional mutant (SALK_125543). The T-DNA was inserted into the first intron of the SIRK1 gene (Fig. 1A). Homozygous mutants of sirk1 were selected from a segregating population using a PCR screen with gene-specific primers and T-DNA primers (Fig. 1B). Homozygous sirk1 mutants had an overall reduced SIRK1 gene expression (Fig. 1C). Additionally, no peptides of SIRK1 protein were fragmented in membrane preparations of sirk1 T-DNA insertional mutants, but ion intensities for two peptides, FSDQPVMLDVYSPDR and NEIWGDVGEIFTELK, were assigned based on retention-time correlation. In general, peptide ion intensity sums for SIRK1 in the T-DNA insertional mutant were at least 10 times lower than in the wild type (Fig. 1D). For complementation of sirk1 mutants, the SIRK1 cDNA was cloned as a GFP fusion and expressed under the CaMV35S promoter, resulting in higher expression of SIRK1 relative to the wild type (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, SIRK1-GFP-fusion constructs were made for SIRK1, in which the serine 744 was mutated to either alanine (S744A) or aspartic acid (S744D) to result in phosphorylation site null mutants and phosphorylation mimics. Relative expression levels of the phosphorylation site mutant constructs were similar to those observed for the native construct (Fig. 1C). Predicted SIRK1 localization to the plasma membrane was confirmed by confocal imaging of the GFP-fusion constructs in overlay images with membrane staining dye FM4-64 (Fig. 1D). The localization of SIRK1 in the plasma membrane was not altered by the mutations on S744; all three SIRK1 constructs (SIRK1-GFP, SIRK1S744A-GFP, and SIRK1S744D-GFP) localized at the plasma membrane and to endosomes (zoom-in boxes in Fig. 1) overlapping with FM4-64 (solid triangles in Fig. 1).  [[FIGURE]] SIRK1 and the phosphorylation site mutants showed kinase activity when exposed to a generic substrate, such as myelin basic protein, as recorded by reduced luminescence in a luciferase-dependent measurement of residual ATP in the assay (Fig. 2) (high luminescence correlates with low phosphorylation). The kinase activity of SIRK1 isolated from microsomal fractions of sirk1 seedlings expressing the 35S::SIRK1-GFP construct was significantly increased upon sucrose resupply after sucrose starvation. In contrast, for sirk1 mutants expressing 35S::GFP only (empty vector control (EVC)), kinase activity in sucrose-starved and sucrose-resupplied seedlings remained unaltered. In general, kinase activity in plants expressing GFP only was significantly lower even relative to sucrose-starved sirk1 plants expressing the 35S::SIRK1-GFP or the site directed mutant constructs 35S::SIRK1 S744A-GFP and 35S::SIRK1S744D-GFP. Mutation of the SIRK1 phosphorylation site at serine 744 to alanine resulted in kinase activity similar to that of sucrose-starved 35S::SIRK1-GFP plants, and kinase activity did not significantly increase upon sucrose exposure. In contrast, when serine 744 was mutated to aspartic acid, subsequent kinase activity was more similar to that of the sucrose-induced 35S::SIRK1-GFP plants and remained higher under sucrose starvation. In all cases, although SIRK1 protein was isolated from different plant lines, the amount of SIRK1 protein present in the assay was not significantly different for different constructs (Fig. 2B).  [[FIGURE]] In order to study the role of SIRK1 in the context of rapid alterations in external sucrose availability, a sucrose starvation and resupply experiment was carried out with seedlings of wild type and sirk1 mutant. Sucrose was resupplied to carbon-starved seedlings to a final concentration of 30 mm for 3 min. This was the time point at which maximal transient phosphorylation of SIRK1 had been observed in previous work (CITATION). In total, 369 phosphopeptides were identified in at least one genotype or condition. Spectra for all identified phosphopeptides were submitted to the phosphorylation site database PhosPhAt and also can be found in supplemental Fig. S1. From these, 253 phosphopeptides were quantified in wild type both in starved seedlings and after 3 min of sucrose resupply; for the sirk1 mutant, 246 phosphopeptides were quantified under both conditions. This resulted in an overlapping 226 phosphorylation sites with quantitative information for both time points in wild-type and sirk1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 3). To identify significant alterations in sucrose-induced phosphorylation between the wild type and the sirk1 mutant, the variation in sucrose-induced phosphorylation as calculated from phosphopeptide ion intensity ratios of the sucrose-induced state relative to the sucrose-starved state was analyzed within the replicates of each plant line (comparisons of col-0 versus col-0 or sirk1 versus sirk1). In contrast, comparison of the sucrose-induced phosphorylation ratios between sirk1 and col-0 revealed a significantly different distribution of sucrose-induced phosphorylation (p = 0.013, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; supplemental Fig. S2). Particularly, for sirk1 in comparison to wild type, the distribution of sucrose-induced phosphorylation ratios (log2(3 min sucrose/sucrose starved)) was shifted to lower ratios, suggesting that protein phosphorylation in sirk1 did not increase in response to the sucrose stimulus to the same degree as in wild-type col-0.  [[FIGURE]] In detail, about 30% of all 226 quantified phosphopeptides showed an altered abundance in sirk1 mutant relative to the wild type, with 51 phosphopeptides displaying at least 2-fold lower sucrose-induced phosphorylation and 19 phosphopeptides showing at least 2-fold higher sucrose-induced phosphorylation relative to the wild type (supplemental Table S3). We could confirm the sucrose-induced phosphorylation of the SIRK1 peptide FSDQPV(oxM)LDVY(pS)PDR bearing S744 (CITATION). Sucrose-induced phosphorylation of this peptide was abolished in sirk1 mutant and partially restored in the SIRK1-GFP overexpression line (supplemental Fig. S3).  In general, proteins with transport functions (aquaporins, SWEET11, ATPases) were overrepresented (p = 8 × 10−6, Fisher's exact test, using all identified proteins as a background; Fig. 3) among phosphopeptides with reduced sucrose-induced phosphorylation in sirk1, followed by proteins with functions in protein synthesis (p = 0.0007015, Fisher's exact test). Peptides of transport-related proteins were the Ca2+ ATPase ACA8 (AT5G57110), the sucrose exporter SWEET11 (AT3G48740), the vacuolar glucose exporter ERDL6 (AT1G75220), and, particularly, peptides originating from the C-terminal end of different aquaporins (PIP3A AT4G35100, PIP2E AT2G39010, PIP2B AT2G37170, PIP2F AT5G60660). For signaling proteins, the sucrose-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase SnRK2.5 (AT5G63650.1) phosphopeptide IFV(pT)NSAKR was found to be reduced in sirk1. Other signaling proteins with reduced phosphorylation in sirk1 included FHL (AT5G02200), NPH3 (AT5G64330), the Rab protein ARA4 (AT2G43130), and a remorin family protein (AT3G61260). Furthermore, for seven ribosomal proteins and one translation initiation factor, protein phosphorylation in response to external sucrose was reduced in sirk1. For another 14 proteins, SIRK1 overexpressing lines showed increased sucrose-induced phosphorylation that remained unaltered in sirk1. For example, the sucrose-induced phosphorylation of NSLNI(pS)MR of kinase CPK5 (AT4G35310) was only slightly reduced in sirk1, but it showed a higher phosphorylation state in SIRK1 overexpressing lines than in wild-type seedlings after sucrose-induced phosphorylation.  The phosphopeptides identified with reduced sucrose-induced phosphorylation contained two significant (p < 0.01) phosphorylation motifs (CITATION): an ES motif (motif score = 3.17) that was mainly found in the ribosomal proteins, and an SXRS motif (motif score = 6.93) that particularly contained the double-phosphorylation sites of the aquaporin peptides (Fig. 3). A search for the SXRS motif in the PhosPhAt database (CITATION) revealed a total of 69 phosphopeptide sequences, and phosphorylation was shown for 33% of these for both serine residues. The SXRS motif thus seems to be a double-phosphorylation site motif, and possibly the same kinase can address both sites.  For 19 proteins, higher sucrose-induced phosphorylation was observed in the sirk1 T-DNA insertional mutant. Among them we found enzymes of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, such as sucrose phosphate synthase SPS1F (AT5G20280), an isoform of cytosolic glutamine synthase GLN1;1 (AT5G37600), glutamate decarboxylase GAD1 (AT5G17330), and asparagine synthase ASN2 (AT5G65010). The phosphorylation site in peptide IN(pS)AESMELWASQQK of sucrose phosphate synthase SPS1F was found to be the major regulatory phosphorylation site, leading to inactivation of the enzyme in phosphorylated status (CITATION). Observations of levels of sucrose-induced phosphorylation of these proteins higher than found in the wild type might point to the involvement of additional proteins, such as protein kinases or phosphatases that are inactivated or activated by SIRK1.  For 33 phosphopeptides of the 51 proteins with decreased phosphorylation in sirk1, a trend or significant increase of sucrose-induced phosphorylation was observed in the 35S::SIRK1-GFP overexpression line relative to the sirk1 mutant. For most of these phosphopeptides, sucrose-induced phosphorylation reached levels similar to those in wild-type plants (supplemental Table S3).  The major apparent phosphorylation targets of SIRK1, namely, aquaporin proteins, were confirmed by an in vitro phosphorylation assay involving synthetic peptides. An in vitro kinase assay was performed using a mixture of 43 different peptides as a substrate. The peptide mixture contained a total of 25 peptides matching various experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites, including the C-terminal peptide ALGSFGSFGSFR of aquaporin PIP2F (AT5G60660), LGTVSSPEPISVVR from SWEET11 (AT3G48740), and peptide LIEEVSHSSGSPNPVSD of receptor kinase AT3G02880. In addition, 18 control peptides were included, one for each of the putative substrate proteins. After exposure to SIRK1, only peptides ALGSFGSFGSFR, LGTVSSPEPISVVR, and LIEEVSHSSGSPNPVSD were found to be phosphorylated, whereas 14 other peptides with experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites were detected in the non-phosphorylated form. For peptide ALGSFGSFGSFR, the singly phosphorylated versions ALGSFG(pS)FGSFR and ALGSFGSFG(pS)FR and the doubly phosphorylated version ALGSFG(pS)FG(pS)FR were detected. Quantitative analysis of the PIP2F phosphopeptides revealed increased phosphorylation of peptide ALGSFGSFGSFR at two different phosphorylation sites upon exposure to the SIRK1-GFP constructs relative to GFP-only purifications (EVC). The phosphorylation of PIP2F substrate peptide was independent of phosphorylation site mutagenesis (supplemental Fig. S4). The control peptide for PIP2F, with no phosphorylation sites (DPPPAPFFDMEELR), did not show altered ion intensity levels after exposure to the SIRK1 variants. Altogether, 8 putative target peptides (from total of 25) and 5 control peptides (from total of 18) were not detected in the mass spectrometric analysis after in vitro kinase exposure. For technical reasons, the peptide ALGSFGSFGSFR was the only C-terminal aquaporin peptide included in the in vitro assay; related peptides SLGSFR(pS)AANV (PIP2B), ALGSFR(pS)NATN (PIP3), and (pS)QLHELHA (PIP2E) were not tested in this context.  We were interested in sucrose-induced protein–protein interaction partners of SIRK1. Therefore, GFP pull-downs under sucrose-starvation conditions (time point: 0 min) and under sucrose-resupplied conditions (time point: 3 min) were performed with sirk1 seedlings expressing the different SIRK1-fusion proteins or GFP only (EVC). Under each sucrose treatment condition (starvation or resupply), protein ion intensity sums of interaction partners for each of the bait GFP-fusions (SIRK1, SIRK1S744A, and SIRK1S744D) were expressed relative to the interaction partners of the GFP-only control (EVC) under that condition. Results from three biological replicates were averaged and significant interaction partners were defined after pairwise t test and multiple-testing correction (CITATION). The full list of all 1386 identified proteins in the pull-down experiments of the different bait protein versions is available as supplemental Table S2, and the full results of pairwise t tests of bait versus GFP-only samples, including corrected and uncorrected p values, are available as supplemental Table S4.  In pull-downs with SIRK1 bait proteins, under sucrose-induced conditions (3 min sucrose supply), two to three times more proteins were identified as significant interaction partners (p < 0.05 after multiple testing correction) than in the sucrose-starved condition, although SIRK1 bait was present in similar amounts (Fig. 2B). A large overlap in identified proteins was observed for the three SIRK1 constructs (SIRK1-GFP, SIRK1S744A-GFP, and SIRK1S744D-GFP), with a tendency for stronger overlap between SIRK1 and SIRK1S744A than between SIRK1 and SIRK1S744D (Fig. 4A). Among the significant interaction partners (p < 0.05 after multiple testing correction) were also numerous ribosomal proteins and proteins with plastidal locations. These protein classes are known to be particularly “sticky” and often occur as nonspecific interactors in pull-downs. Therefore, only proteins with plasma membrane or extracellular locations based on the consensus location from SUBA3 were considered (CITATION). A total of 36 proteins remained as significant sucrose-induced interaction partners for all SIRK1 constructs (Fig. 4B). Among these common interactors, we found a strong overrepresentation (p = 4.53 × 10−10, Fisher's exact test) of aquaporins, particularly PIP1A (AT3G61430), PIP1C (AT1G01620), PIP2A (AT3G53420), PIP2B (AT2G45960), PIP1D (AT4G23400), PIP2E (AT2G39010), PIP2F (AT5G60660), and PIP3A (AT4G35100). Other significant interaction partners to SIRK1 and its site-directed mutants were a number of protein kinases, such as three transmembrane-receptor-like protein kinases, as well as two kinases from the BSK family (Table I). The BSK kinases were shown to be involved in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway initiated by receptor kinase BRI1 (CITATION). Other significant interaction partners to SIRK1 were clathrins (AT2G20760, AT3G08530, AT3G11130) and a coatomer subunit protein (AT4G31480) indicating connections to endocytotic pathways. Interestingly, members of the remorin family of proteins were identified exclusively under sucrose-resupplied conditions, with more than 2-fold enrichment in the different SIRK1 pull-downs relative to GFP only. Remorins are proteins with clear preferable location in sterol-rich membrane microdomains (CITATION, CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]] In the phosphopeptide profiling experiment comparing sucrose-induced phosphorylation of wild type and sirk1, several phosphopeptides matching the C-terminal end of aquaporins were identified, and aquaporins were found as interaction partners of SIRK1. Thus, we hypothesized that SIRK1, either independently or within a complex of interacting proteins, may be involved in the regulation of aquaporin activity, particularly given that aquaporins are known to be regulated by protein phosphorylation. The identified differentially phosphorylated sites in wild-type and sirk1 mutant samples at the C terminus of aquaporins are conserved in the aquaporin protein family and are responsible for pore gating. Full phosphorylation at the two serine residues will lead to pore opening, whereas dephosphorylated serine residues result in a closed pore (CITATION). Therefore, the water transport capacity of wild type, sirk1 mutant, and the different lines expressing SIRK1 and S744 mutants were analyzed in a protoplast swelling assay reflecting the aquaporin activity (CITATION).  When exposed to a hypo-osmolar medium, protoplasts take up water through aquaporins; this can be observed in the swelling of the protoplasts (Fig. 5A). Protoplasts were prepared from sucrose-starved seedlings and initially exposed to 500 mm mannitol (approximately 580 mOsmol kg−1). Then, the protoplasts were challenged either with 350 mm mannitol or with 320 mm mannitol containing 30 mm sucrose (approximately 400 mOsmol kg−1 for both media). The water flux density (jv) across the protoplast membrane was calculated from video records of individual protoplasts. In the wild type, sucrose-containing medium induced a higher (p = 0.021) swelling rate than mannitol medium alone (Fig. 5B). This was completely abolished in the sirk1 mutant, which showed significantly less swelling (p < 0.001) upon sucrose treatment than upon mannitol treatment. In the complementation line expressing 35S::SIRK1-GFP, the significant increase (p = 0.002) in water flux density upon sucrose treatment was restored (Fig. 5C). The higher water flux density in the complementation line than in the wild-type sucrose-induced protoplasts might be due to overexpression of SIRK1 under the CaMV35S promoter. There were no significant differences in water flux densities among wild-type, sirk1, and SIRK1 expressing lines when treated with mannitol only. The mutation of S744 to alanine or aspartic acid did not result in a significantly different water flux density in mannitol medium. Protoplasts from the two site-directed mutant lines also showed increases in water flux densities similar to those in plants expressing wild-type SIRK1. In general, the mutants of SIRK S744 were still able to phosphorylate aquaporins (supplemental Fig. S5), indicating that mutations at S744 did not affect kinase activity.  [[FIGURE]] In order to gain insights into the role of serine 744 phosphorylation sites in sucrose-related responses, we also performed sucrose-starvation experiments followed by 3 min of sucrose resupply using the sirk1 mutants expressing either S744A or S744D mutants of SIRK1 (SIRKS744A and SIRKS744D). We assumed that an aspartic acid (D) substitution mimics a constitutive phosphorylation of Ser-744, and that alanine (A) produces a phosphorylation-null mutation. There was a slight trend for the plants expressing SIRK1S744D showing more wild-type-like sucrose-induced phosphorylation of aquaporin PIP2E (AT2G39010) (supplemental Fig. S5) or other proteins, such as tonoplast located ERDL6 (AT1G75220). This trend was supported by our findings of slightly higher kinase activity in SIRK1S744D than in SIRK1S744A (Fig. 2).  The results from SIRK1 pull-downs indicated 16 significant interaction partners (p < 0.05) as more frequent interactors to SIRK1S744A than to SIRK1S744D (Fig. 4B) based on pairwise significance testing of abundance ratios relative to the GFP-only control. Among these proteins were FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactan proteins (AT2G45470, AT1G03870), synamptogamin A (AT2G20990), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (AT1G16890), and a phospholipase D (AT4G35790) (Table I). Among the 223 proteins found as common interaction partners to SIRK1 and SIRK1S744A (Fig. 4A), we found four members of the thioredoxin family (AT1G45145, AT4G03520, AT5G39950, and AT5G42980), six 14–3-3 proteins (AT1G78300, AT2G42590, AT4G09000, AT5G10450, AT5G38480, and AT5G65430), six proteins with functions in G-protein signaling (AT1G16920, AT1G56330, AT3G18820, AT4G17170, AT5G20010, and AT5G59840), and seven isoforms of tubulin (AT1G04820, AT1G20010, AT4G14960, AT5G12250, AT5G19770, AT5G62690, and AT5G44340). Among the membrane-located interaction partners to SIRK1S744A, synaptogamin A (AT2G20990), sugar transporter STP1 (AT1G11260), and plasma membrane ATPase AHA2 (AT4G30190) were found with abundance ratios that were higher in the sucrose-supplied status (supplemental Table S4, Fig. 4C).  In contrast, 14 proteins with membrane or external locations were identified as significant interaction partners to SIRK1S744D independent of the sucrose status (Fig. 4D). This constituted 29% of all 47 identified membrane-located significant interaction partners of SIRK1S744D. Among these sucrose-independent interactors were aquaporin PIP2E (AT2G39010), as well as proteins with functions in membrane trafficking, cell wall or membrane microdomains (e.g. PATL1 (AT1G72150) and PATL2 (AT1G22530) or SKS6 (AT1G41830)), and three clathrins (AT2G20760, AT3G08530, and AT3G11130). PCAP1 (AT4G20260) related to phosphoinosite signaling (four proteins: AT1G5400, AT1G54010, AT1G78830, and AT1G78850) belonged to the MAPMAN category “myrosinases-lectin-jacalin.” All of these proteins were also identified as significant interaction partners to SIRK1 with a non-mutated phosphorylation site, but only in the sucrose-induced state (Table I). These findings might be indicative of a role of S744 phosphorylation in either protein targeting or sucrose-induced internalization of SIRK1. Because interactions with proteins with functions in receptor internalization or trafficking were found to be stronger in the S744D mutant, we propose that phosphorylation at S744 might be one way to induce the rapid internalization of SIRK1 and thus lead to adjustment of receptor availability during or after stimulation.  A role of S744 phosphorylation in connection with receptor internalization was confirmed through the observation of SIRK1 accumulation in sucrose-induced endocytotic events. Clearly, sucrose stimulation for up to 15 min induced the formation of endosome-like structures containing SIRK1 in SIRK1-GFP overexpressing plants (Fig. 6). If S744 was mutated to a phosphorylation-null mimic (S744A), the frequency of SIRK1 endocytosis was significantly reduced, as shown by the less frequent observation of cells with many sucrose-induced SIRK1-containing endocytotic vesicles. In contrast, if S744 was mutated to a constitutive phosphorylation mimic (S744D), the number of cells with few SIRK1-containing endocytotic events in the absence of sucrose was strongly increased (Fig. 6). Interestingly, in this mutant, the number of cells with many SIRK1-containing endocytotic events under non-induced conditions was slightly higher than observed in the wild-type version. Interestingly, the S744D mutant did not respond to sucrose resupply. Thus, some degree of phosphorylation at S744 resulted in increased SIRK1 endocytosis relative to the non-phosphorylated condition (S744A).  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! A T-DNA insertional mutant for sirk1 (SALK_125543) was identified within the SALK T-DNA insertional lines collection (CITATION). Seeds of sirk1 T-DNA insertional mutant were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre and propagated in the greenhouse at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology (Potsdam, Germany). The sirk1 T-DNA insertional mutant carries a T-DNA insertion in the first intron of SIRK1 and was confirmed via PCR amplification using T-DNA border primer LBb1.3 (5′-ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC-3′) and gene-specific primer SIRK1-RP (5′-GTGGGTTTCCTAGTGGCTTTC-3′). The expression of SIRK1 in the wild type and sirk1 mutant was examined by using a pair of gene-specific primers (SIRK1–1F, 5′-TTTCGAGGTTCACGTGCAAG-3′ and SIRK1–1R, 5′-CCTATATCCCCAGGCAGCATAC-3′).  Total RNA was extracted from the sirk1 plants using the Plant RNA Mini Kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. RNA was digested with DNaseI (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) to remove the genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using the StepOnePlus Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) with the SYBR green detection protocol (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX). The UBQ gene was used as an internal control, and the relative expression of the gene of interest was calculated using a comparative Δ-Δ Ct method (CITATION). Primers for SIRK1 were designed for the N-terminal part (F1/R1) and the C-terminal part of the gene (F2/R2): F1 5′-TTTCGAGGTTCACGTGCAAG-3′, R1 5′-CCTATATCCCCAGGCAGCATAC-3′; F2 5′-TTGCCAATAATAAGCTGTCCGC-3′, R2 5′-CGACACATTGAATCCCACCATT-3′. Primers used for ubiquitin were 5′-GGCCTTGTATAATCCCTGATGAATAAG-3′ and 5′-AAAGAGATAACAGGAACGGAAACATAGT-3′.  Full-length cDNA of the SIRK1 gene without a stop code was amplified via PCR using the specific forward primer SIRK1-EcoRI (5′-GGAATTCATGAGTCATTTTCTCACTTTCTG-3′) and the specific reverse primer AtSIRK1-SmaI (5′-ACAACCCGGGAGCAGGCAGAAATTGAAGTA-3′). It was then subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). The EcoRI-SIRK1-SmaI fragment was then cloned into the plant transformation vector pEZR(H)-LN (a kind gift from Staffan Persson Lab, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology) upstream and as a fusion of the GFP coding sequence, resulting in the plasmid 35S::AtSIRK1-GFP. The construct pGEM-T easy-EcoRI-SIRK1-SmaI was used for mutating Ser-744 of AtSIRK1 to Ala-744 or Asp-744. Site-directed mutagenesis was done via PCR using specific primer pairs (5′-GTTAGATGTTTACgCACCTGATAGATTGGC-3′ and 5′-CCAATCTATCAGGTGcGTAAACATCTAAC-3′ or 5′-GTTAGATGTTTACgatCCTGATAGATTGGC-3′ and 5′-CAATCTATCAGGatcGTAAACATCTAACAT-3′) and the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The EcoRI-AtSIRK1S744A-SmaI fragment or EcoRI-SIRK1S744D-SmaI fragment also was cloned into plant transformation vector pEZR(H)-LN and as a fusion with the GFP coding sequence, resulting in the plasmid 35S::AtSIRK1S744A-GFP or 35S::AtSIRK1S744D-GFP. Three plasmids were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, and sirk1 mutant plants were transformed using the floral dip method (CITATION). Homozygous T2 transgenic lines were further selected by means of segregation analysis, and T3 seeds were used for experiments. The fluorescence of GFP in the transgenic lines was checked via confocal laser-scanning microscopy (TCS SP5, Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).  Arabidopsis seedlings of wild type (col-0), sirk1, 35S::AtSIRK1-GFP/sirk1, 35S::AtSIRK1S744A-GFP/sirk1, and 35S::AtSIRK1S744D-GFP/sirk1 were germinated and grown under continuous light (20 °C, 130 μE/s*m2) in Jouanneau and Péaud-Lenoėl medium composed of micro- and macronutrients (CITATION), with a total of 3 mm nitrogen and supplemented with 0.5% sucrose. After 11 days, we sucrose starved the seedlings by changing the growth medium to a sucrose-free medium and leaving the flasks in the dark for 24 h as described elsewhere (CITATION). Sucrose was then resupplied to a final concentration of 30 mm for 3 min before seedlings were harvested for microsomal protein preparation. In a control experiment, 30 mm mannitol was used instead of sucrose.  A total of 4 g of seedlings (fresh weight) was homogenized in a falcon tube with 20 ml extraction buffer (330 mm mannitol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-MES, fresh 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF, pH 8) in the presence of 0.5% v/v proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidin, 3 μm leupeptin). The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 48,000 × g at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was re-suspended in 100 μl of membrane buffer (330 mm mannitol, 25 mm Tris-MES, 0.5 mm DTT). The soluble fraction in the supernatant was precipitated with three times volume acetone overnight, and then proteins were resuspended in 500 μl 6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, pH 8.  Microsomal proteins (300 μg) isolated as described above were incubated with 50 μl of anti-GFP magnetic beads (Chromotek, Martinsried, Germany) for two hours on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were collected on a μMACS separator (Milteniy Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) and washed two times with 350 μl and 500 μl wash buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40).  For protein–protein interaction assays, the proteins were eluted from the beads with 100 μl 6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, pH 8, before in-solution tryptic digestion. For kinase activity assays, one more washing step was carried out with wash buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA), and the beads were mixed with 100 μl kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA).  SIRK1-GFP fusion protein was affinity purified over magnetic beads (see above). A luciferase-based kinase activity assay was performed in 60 μl reaction mixture incubated for one hour at room temperature. The reaction mixture contained 20 μl to 40 μl beads with GFP-tagged proteins, 15 μl myelin basic protein (1 mg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich) as a generic kinase substrate, 1 μl of 40 μm ATP, and an appropriate reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA). After incubation, 60 μl Kinase-Glo® Plus Reagents (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) were added and incubated for 10 min. Luminescence as a measure of ATP consumption was recorded with a luminometer (Microbeta Trilux). In general, protein isolations from three independent batches of seedlings were tested, and the average activity value plus/minus the standard deviation is presented.  SIRK1-GFP fusion protein was affinity purified over magnetic beads (see above). A luciferase-based kinase activity assay was performed as described above, except that 30 μg of a mixture of putative target peptides was used as a substrate. The peptide mixture consisted of 25 peptides bearing experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites to different proteins (including ALGSFGSFGSFR/PIP2F (AT2G39010), LGTVSSPEPISVVR/SWEET11 (AT3G48740), and LIEEVSHSSGSPNPVSD/AT3G02880), as well as control peptides without known phosphorylation sites (e.g. DPPPAPFFDMEELR/PIP2F (AT2G39010), TSPHLGEK/SWEET11 (AT3G48740), and INLGENK/AT3G02880). In total, the 43 peptides (supplemental Table S5) were exposed as a substrate to the enriched SIRK1-GFP fusions enriched in microsomal fractions of three independent protein isolations. After exposure to the target peptides, the reaction mixture was purified over C8 material to trap undigested SIRK1 protein and to collect the respective target peptides. Collected peptide mixtures were then desalted over C18 prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The phosphorylation of target peptides was confirmed via mass spectrometry (see below).  Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in liquid cultures and sucrose starved as described above but not challenged with sucrose. Instead, parts of the 12-day-old seedlings were carefully dried on tissue paper, washed with a filter-sterilized 300 mm mannitol–10 mm CaCl2 solution, and cut into small pieces that were finally transferred to 3 ml enzymatic digestion medium (ES-500M: 500 mm mannitol, 10 mm MES/KOH (pH 5.8), 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl) plus 1% (w/v) cellulase Onozuka R10 (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) and 1% (w/v) macerozyme R10 (Duchefa, The Netherlands). The protoplasts were prepared in the dark with gentle shaking for two to three hours, filtered through a 50-μm nylon filter, centrifuged at 80 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and washed three times with ice-cold ES-500 M without enzymes. Protoplasts were stored in the dark on ice for at least 30 min before an experiment was started.  In principle, protoplast swelling experiments were performed as described previously (CITATION), with some modifications. Approximately 20 μl of the protoplast suspension were pipetted into 200 μl ES-500 M in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. Protoplasts were allowed to settle down for about 5 to 10 min. The chamber was then perfused with 3 ml of ES-500 M to select protoplasts sticking well to the glass bottom of the chamber. The perfusion solution was then changed to a hypo-osmolar solution (ES-350M) containing the same ingredients as ES-500 M but with 350 mm mannitol instead of 500 mm mannitol. The solution change in the chamber lasted about 15 s. Images were taken every 3 s with a video-camera-equipped microscope for a total of 300 s. In some experiments, protoplasts were treated with 30 mm sucrose. For this, the chamber was perfused with a solution containing 30 mm sucrose and 470 mm mannitol (ES-470M_30S) for about 5 min (ES-470M_30S: 470 m m mannitol, 30 mm sucrose, 10 mm MES/KOH (pH 5.8), 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl) and then challenged with a hypo-osmolar solution consisting of 320 mm mannitol and 30 mm sucrose (ES-320M_30S: 320 mm mannitol, 30 mm sucrose, 10 mm MES/KOH (pH 5.8), 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl). The osmolality of all media was measured with a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030, Gonotec, Berlin, Germany), and the following osmolalities were noted: ES-500M, 0.578 Osmol kg−1; ES-470M_30S, 0.588 Osmol kg−1; ES-350M, 0.402 Osmol kg−1; ES-320M_30S, 0.395 Osmol kg−1.  The diameter of the protoplasts was measured using imageJ software. Diameters were converted to micrometers, and the volume, surface area, and relative volume were calculated for each time point. A regression line was fitted to the steepest part of the swelling curve to determine the maximal water volume flux density, which corresponds to aquaporin activity. Statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA).  Seedlings expressing SIRK1-GFP, SIRK1S744A-GFP, and SIRK1S744D-GFP were imaged on a confocal microscope equipped with a CSU-X1 Yokogawa spinning disc head fitted to a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope, a CFI APO 60× water immersion objective, an evolve charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics Technology, Tucson, AZ), and a 1.2× lens between the spinning disc and the camera. GFP was excited at 491 nm and FM4-64 at 561 nm using a multichannel dichroic and an ET525/50 M or ET595/50 M band pass emission filter (Chroma Technology, Bellow Falls, VT) for GFP and red fluorescent protein, respectively. Image acquisitions were performed using Metamorph Online Premier, version 7.5. Typical exposure times were 600 ms for GFP and 300 ms for red fluorescent protein.  Four-day-old seedlings grown in the dark in half-strength MS liquid medium were incubated in half-strength MS liquid medium supplemented with 20 μm FM4-64 (stock solution: 4 mm in DMSO; Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) for 10 min. They were washed three times for 5 min in half-strength MS liquid medium. The treatments were performed in the dark under slight agitation.  The quantification of endocytotic events was performed for seedlings (four days old, grown in the dark in half-strength MS liquid medium) not incubated in FM4-64 in order to avoid any alteration of the sugar perception produced by the lipophilic dye. The three SIRK1 constructs (SIRK1-GFP, SIRK1S744A-GFP, and SIRK1S744D-GFP) were imaged directly after growth under sucrose-starvation conditions or after 3 to 15 min of sucrose resupply. Per treatment and genotype, at least eight seedlings and 20 hypocotyl cells/seedling were counted, starting from the bottom part of the hypocotyl. The cells were classified according to the amount of endocytotic events observed—no detectable, few (less than 10 per cell), or many (more than 10 per cell)—as described elsewhere (CITATION). All images were processed using ImageJ software. Background correction was performed using the Subtract Background tool (rolling ball radius: 50 pixels).  Microsomal or soluble proteins were predigested for 3 h with endoproteinase Lys-C (0.5 μg/μl; Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) at room temperature. After 4-fold dilution with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), samples were digested with 4 μl sequencing-grade modified trypsin (0.5 μg μl−1; Promega, Fichtburg, WI) overnight at 37 °C. After overnight digestion, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)1 was added (until the pH was 3 or less) to stop digestion. Digested peptides were desalted over a C18 tip (CITATION) and dissolved in 100 μl 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA before phosphopeptide enrichment with titanium dioxide (TiO2) (GL Sciences, Torrance, CA).  Phosphopeptides were enriched over TiO2 as described elsewhere (CITATION), with some modifications. TiO2 beads were equilibrated with 100 μl of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA. 100 μl digested and desalted peptides were mixed with 100 μl 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA and incubated for about 1 min with 2 mg equilibrated TiO2 beads. The solution with the beads was then placed into a self-made microcolumn in a 200-μl pipette tip with a C8 disc as a plug. Phosphopeptides were eluted from TiO2 beads in these microcolumns using 5% ammonium hydroxide and 5% piperidine (CITATION). Elutes were immediately acidified by adding 50 μl 20% phosphoric acid to reach a pH value less than 3. Enriched phosphopeptides were desalted over a C18 stage tip again prior to mass spectrometric analysis.  Tryptic peptide mixtures were analyzed via LC-MS/MS using nanoflow Easy-nLC (Thermo Scientific) as an HPLC system and an Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific) as a mass analyzer. Peptides were eluted from a 75-μm analytical column (Reprosil C18, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) on a linear gradient running from 4% to 64% acetonitrile over 90 min and sprayed directly into the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Proteins were identified via MS/MS based on the information-dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra of multiple charged peptides. Up to five data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap for each full-scan spectrum acquired at 60,000 full-width half-maximum resolution in the Orbitrap. The overall cycle time was approximately 1 s. When analyzing samples after phosphopeptide enrichments, multistage activation was chosen for fragmentation to achieve the simultaneous fragmentation of parent ion and neutral loss peaks of phosphopeptides (CITATION).  Protein identification and ion intensity quantitation were carried out by MaxQuant, version 1.3.0.5 (CITATION). Spectra were matched against the Arabidopsis proteome (TAIR10, 35,386 entries) using Andromeda (CITATION). Common contaminants (trypsin, keratin, etc.) were included during database searches. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and the oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Trypsin was specified as the protease, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. The mass tolerance for the database search was set to 20 ppm for full scans and 0.5 Da for fragment ions. The multiplicity was set to 1. For label-free quantitation, retention time matching between runs was chosen within a time window of 2 min. Peptide and protein false discovery rates were set to 0.01, and the site false discovery rate was set to 0.05. The location of phosphorylation sites was determined by the site-scanning algorithm within Andromeda. Hits to contaminants (e.g. keratins) and reverse hits identified by MaxQuant were excluded from further analysis. A full list of all identified peptides from the phosphoproteomics experiment is found in supplemental Table S1, and that for the pull-down experiments is presented in supplemental Table S2. The identified phosphopeptides, including their spectra (supplemental Fig. S1), were submitted to the phosphorylation site database PhosPhAt (CITATION, CITATION) and are publicly available.  Reported ion intensity values were used for quantitative data analysis. cRacker (CITATION) was used for label-free data analysis of phosphopeptide ion intensities based on the MaxQuant output. All phosphopeptides and proteotypic non-phosphopeptides were used for quantitation. Within each sample, ion intensities of each peptide ions species (each m/z) were normalized against the total ion intensities in that sample (peptide ion intensity/total sum of ion intensities). Subsequently, each peptide ion species (i.e. each m/z value) was scaled against the average normalized intensity of that ion across all treatments. For each peptide, values from three biological replicates were averaged after normalization and scaling. In the case of non-phosphopeptides, protein ion intensity sums were calculated from normalized scaled ion intensities of all proteotypic peptides.  Sucrose-induced phosphorylation was expressed as the ratio of normalized and scaled phosphopeptide ion intensity values at 3 min of sucrose resupply to the normalized and scaled phosphopeptide ion intensity values from the sucrose-starved control. For estimation of the sample-to-sample variation of sucrose-induced phosphorylation within each plant line, distributions of sucrose-induced phosphorylation ratios (normalized ion intensity at 3 min/normalized ion intensity at 0 min) were compared within col-0, within sirk1, and between sirk1/col-0 (supplemental Fig. S2), as described previously (CITATION). Differences between the ratio distributions were assessed via a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using the software R.  For the analysis of pull-down results, protein ion intensity values from three biological replicates in samples of bait pull-down and GFP-only pull-down were compared by means of a pairwise t test, and multiple testing correction (CITATION) was applied. For pull-downs under sucrose-induced conditions, GFP-only pull-downs under sucrose-induced conditions were used as a control, and for the sucrose-starvation condition, GFP-only pull-downs under sucrose-starvation conditions were used as reference (supplemental Table S4).  Functional classification of proteins was done based on MAPMAN (CITATION). Information about subcellular location was derived from the consensus location available from SUBA3 (CITATION). For data not derived from mass spectrometry studies, statistical analyses were carried out using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
