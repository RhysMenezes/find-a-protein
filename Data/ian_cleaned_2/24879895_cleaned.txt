The interaction between Arabidopsis PEX5 and PEX14N is independent of cargo binding. The affinity of a PTS1 peptide for PEX5 is unaffected by PEX14N binding. Arabidopsis PEX5 complexes PTS1 and PTS2 cargoes. PEX5 and 7 co-isolate with PEX14N, but the PTS2 cargo thiolase does not. PEX14N does not unload canonical PTS1 cargo peptide in vitro but may play a role in PTS2 release.
!~RES~! To determine the ability of PEX5 to form complexes with PEX14N and PTS1 cargo, pull-down experiments were performed utilising purified soluble recombinant constructs (CITATION) and a fluorescently labelled PTS1 peptide. PEX5C bound lissamine-YQSKL (detected using fluorescence) and could be isolated using Ni–NTA resin (CITATIONA, lane 1). No fluorescence was detected in the absence of PEX5C (CITATIONA, lane 2). PEX5C contains six of the nine W-X3-F/Y motifs that bind the PEX14 N-terminal region. To isolate the ternary complex, a pull-down experiment was performed utilising the StrepII tag of the soluble PEX14N construct (CITATION). Controls showed that PEX5C did not bind Strep-Tactin resin (CITATIONB, lane 6); although minor non-specific interaction between Lissamine-YQSKL (PTS1) and Strep-Tactin was observed (lane 7), which was reduced by the presence of either recombinant protein (CITATIONB, lanes 3 and 4). A stable ternary PTS1–PEX5C–PEX14N complex was isolated (CITATIONB, lane 1), and PEX14N could also co-isolate PEX5C in the absence of lissamine-PTS1 cargo (CITATIONB, lane 2). The pull-down experiments were repeated utilising full-length PEX5. These experiments demonstrated that PEX5 was also capable of forming a stable ternary complex, or binding PEX14N in the absence of PTS1 cargo (CITATIONC, lanes 1 and 2). The ability of PEX14N to interact with PEX5 in a cargo-independent manner was confirmed through a binding overlay assay. PEX14N was covalently linked via an unique engineered cysteine to HRP-maleimide. PEX5 constructs were pipetted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked, probed with 50 nM PEX14N–HRP and detected via chemiluminesence. The PEX14N–HRP was capable of forming complexes with both PEX5C and PEX5 in the absence of PTS1 cargo (CITATIOND). To assess whether PEX14N was capable of releasing a generic PTS1 cargo peptide from PEX5, CGGGYQSKL and a non-binding control PTS1 CGGGYQSEL were chemically synthesised and coupled to HRP–maleimide. The peptide–HRP conjugates were used in binding-overlay assays showing that PEX5 bound HRP-SKL, but not HRP–SEL (CITATIONA). The nitrocellulose bound HRP–SKL–PEX5C complex was incubated for 1 h with 0.2 μM PEX14N, 4 times the concentration used to show PEX14N:PEX5 binding in CITATIOND, and HRP–SKL was not dissociated. The complex remained even when incubation for a further 16 h with 2 μM PEX14N was performed (CITATIONA). A fluorescence anisotropy (FA) binding assay was employed to quantitatively assess the binding interactions CITATION. Titration of PEX5C against a constant concentration of lissamine-YQSKL generated a binding curve. Fitting of the data to a 1:1 binding model gave a Kd for the PEX5C–(lissamine-PTS1) interaction of 8.6 ± 4.0 nM CITATION. A constant concentration of PEX14N (1 μM) was then added and the anisotropy measured (CITATIONB, black squares). Overlay of the datasets indicated identical binding characteristics (Kd 11.5 ± 3.4 nM) showing that PEX14N does not alter the PEX5C–PTS1 affinity. To assess if higher molar excesses of PEX14N were required to affect PEX5C–PTS1 interaction, an FA assay was performed titrating PEX14N against a constant concentration of lissamine-YQSKL (100 nM) and PEX5C (100 nM). PEX14N was titrated from 3 μM to 1 nM and the anisotropy measured (CITATIONC). The anisotropy showed the PTS1–PEX5C binding affinity was unaffected by even a 30-fold molar excess of PEX14N. Attempts to isolate sufficient soluble recombinant AtPEX7 for binding interaction studies were unsuccessful (data not shown) thus preventing application of the experimental approach presented above to determine the effect of PEX14N on the PEX7–PTS2 interaction. In order to gain insight into the PTS2 pathway, an Arabidopsis cytosolic fraction was utilised to allow isolation of PEX7 containing complexes via pull-down with hexahistidine tagged recombinant proteins. Prior to use the cytosol was depleted of endogenous nickel binding proteins via incubation with Ni–NTA resin. Immunoblotting against PEX5, PEX7 and thiolase (a PTS2 cargo) was used to detect the presence of proteins of interest. Pull-down from depleted cytosolic fractions using the recombinant PEX5 construct isolated PEX7 and thiolase PTS2-cargo (CITATIONA, anti-PEX7 and anti-thiolase panels). The PEX5 N-terminal is sensitive to proteolysis CITATION and during pull down experiments some degradation occurred which was detected as multiple bands by the anti-PEX5 antibody raised against the N-terminal region CITATION (CITATION, anti-PEX5 panel). The PEX5C terminal construct lacks residues 314–334 which are required for function as the PEX7 co-receptor CITATION. As predicted, pull-down from the depleted cytosol with recombinant PEX5C did not co-isolate either PEX7 or thiolase cargo (CITATIONB, anti-PEX7 and anti-thiolase panels). Δ3,5,Δ2,4-Dienoyl-coenzyme A isomerase (DCI1) is targeted to the peroxisome via a PTS1 sequence CITATION. Pull-down from the cytosolic fraction using recombinant DCI1 co-isolated PEX7 and thiolase PTS2-cargo, along with the degradation pattern of PEX5 (CITATIONA) Isolation of an import complex containing both DCI1 and thiolase cargos indicates that the PEX5 receptor is capable of functioning in both PTS1 and PTS2 pathways simultaneously, either by directly binding both cargoes or by forming mixed PEX5 oligomers containing both cargoes Peroxisomal NAD+-malate dehydrogenase (pMDH1) is targeted to the peroxisome via a PTS2 sequence CITATION. Pull-down from the depleted cytosolic fraction using recombinant pMDH1 co-isolated PEX7 but not thiolase, along with the degradation pattern of PEX5 (CITATIONB). The lack of thiolase co-isolation in this complex presumably results from the recombinant pMDH1 out-competing thiolase for PEX7 binding. Utilisation of the recombinant PEX14N construct for pull-down from cytosolic fraction co-isolated PEX7 and the degradation pattern of PEX5, but not thiolase PTS2 cargo-protein (CITATIONC). This result is representative of five independent experiments.
!~MM~! HRP-maleimide (Sigma) was conjugated to sulfhydryl compounds following the manufacturer’s instructions. Unconjugated sulfhydryls were removed by dialysis into PBS, the HRP-conjugate diluted with glycerol (50% v/v) and stored −20 °C in the dark. Purified PEX5 (25 pmol) or HRP conjugates (2.5 pmol) were pipetted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, dried, blocked 1 h in 3% BSA PBS-T, then incubated with either peptide-HRP (200 nM) or PEX14N-HRP (50 nM) in blocking buffer for 1 h. Blots were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS-T. HRP conjugates were visualised using ECL. To assess unloading of HRP-YQSKL from PEX5C by PEX14N, blots were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS-T, then incubated with PEX14N (0.2 μM) in blocking buffer for 1 h, before washing and visualisation. The process was then repeated with PEX14 N (2 μM) in blocking buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. PEX14N, PEX5C, PEX5, and lissamine-YQSKL (5 μM) in PBS were mixed on ice, adjusted to 1 mL with PBS and incubated with gentle agitation (4 °C, 1 h). The mixture was added to Strep-Tactin resin (500 μL), incubated with gentle agitation (4 °C, 1 h), loaded into a column, drained and washed with PBS (10 × 1.5 mL). Bound complexes were eluted in PBS containing 7.5 mM desthiobiotin (6 × 0.5 mL). Arabidopsis cytosolic fractions (25 000×g supernatant fraction) were prepared from cell cultures as described previously CITATION The cytosolic fraction (∼6 mg/mL, 500 μL) was pre-incubated with Ni–NTA (50 μL) resin 4 °C, 1 h, then the unbound fraction added to the recombinant protein binding partner (33 μM) in PBS (50 μL), and incubated with gentle agitation (4 °C, 1 h). Ni–NTA resin (50 μL) was added and the mixture incubated with gentle agitation (4 °C, 1 h), loaded into a column, and washed with PBS (3 × 0.5 mL). Bound complexes were eluted in PBS containing 1 M imidazole (3 × 50 μL). Immunoblotting was as described CITATION using anti-Arabidopsis PEX5 CITATION at 1:10 000 dilution, anti-Arabidopsis PEX7 CITATION at 1:1000 dilution, and anti-thiolase CITATION at 1:180 000 dilution. Fluorescence studies used an Envision™ 2103 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer), Black Optiplate™ F plates (PerkinElmer), excitation filter: 531 (25) nm, dichroic mirror: 555 nm, emission filter: 595 (60) nm. Anisotropy measurements used the equivalent polarised optics and the g-factor was set to 1. For Anisotropy measurements wells were pre-treated with FA buffer (HEPES (20 mM), NaCl (150 mM), pH 7.5) containing 0.32 mg/mL gelatine. To determine the binding affinity of PTS1 peptides, the anisotropy of a dilution series of PEX5C (1 μM–0.04 nM) containing lissamine-YQSKL (100 nM) (final volume 40 μL) was measured before and after addition of 10 μL PEX14N (5 μM) to the wells. To determine the effect of PEX14N concentration on the PTS1–PEX5C complex the anisotropies of solutions containing PEX14N (10 μM–1 nM), PEX5C (100 nM) and lissamine-YQSKL (100 nM) (40 μL final volume) were recorded.
