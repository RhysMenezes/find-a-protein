!~ABS~!    Arabidopsis thaliana acyl‐CoA‐binding protein 2 (ACBP2) was observed to interact with farnesylated protein 6 (AtFP6), which has a metal‐binding motif (M/LXCXXC). Their interaction and expression in response to heavy metals were investigated.  Yeast two‐hybrid analysis and in vitro assays showed that an ACBP2 derivative lacking ankyrin repeats did not interact with AtFP6, indicating that the ankyrin repeats mediate protein–protein interaction. Autofluorescence‐tagged ACBP2 and AtFP6 transiently co‐expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) were both targeted to the plasma membrane.  Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and northern blot analyses revealed that AtFP6 mRNA was induced by cadmium (Cd(II)) in A. thaliana roots. Assays using metal‐chelate affinity chromatography demonstrated that in vitro translated ACBP2 and AtFP6 bound lead (Pb(II)), Cd(II) and copper (Cu(II)). Consistently, assays using fluorescence analysis confirmed that (His)6‐AtFP6 bound Pb(II), like (His)6‐ACBP2.   Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing ACBP2 or AtFP6 were more tolerant to Cd(II) than wild‐type plants. Plasma membrane‐localized ACBP2 and AtFP6 probably mediate Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II) transport in A. thaliana roots. Also, (His)6‐ACBP2 binds [14C]linoleoyl‐CoA and [14C]linolenoyl‐CoA, the precursors for phospholipid repair following lipid peroxidation under heavy metal stress at the plasma membrane. ACBP2‐overexpressing plants were more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide than wild‐type plants, further supporting a role for ACBP2 in post‐stress membrane repair. 
!~RES~! To confirm the interaction between AtFP6 and ACBP2, the prey vector pGAL4(AD)‐AtFP6 was introduced into S. cerevisiae PJ69‐4A harbouring the pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2 bait vector. Positive transformants selected on [SD‐leu‐ura‐his] medium were tested using colony filter β‐galactosidase assays. Unlike the control (Fig. 1a), consisting of yeast harbouring the pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2 bait vector and control prey vector pGAD‐C1 containing GAL4(AD) (James et al., 1996), in which the bait vector did not activate β‐galactosidase activity, a blue colour was observed with the prey vector pGAL4(AD)‐AtFP6 (Fig. 1b), indicating that AtFP6 interacts with ACBP2 to produce significant levels of β‐galactosidase.  [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the ankyrin repeats of ACBP2 mediate the interaction between ACBP2 and AtFP6, the prey vector pGAL4(AD)‐AtFP6 was introduced into yeast harbouring the ankyrin‐lacking bait vector pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2ΔANK. First, yeast transformed with pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2ΔANK and pGAD‐C1 was tested to ensure that the bait vector itself did not activate β‐galactosidase activity (Fig. 1c). The lack of a blue colour in β‐galactosidase assays when prey pGAL4(AD)‐AtFP6 was introduced into yeast harbouring pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2ΔANK suggested that the protein–protein interaction was abolished when the ankyrin repeats were removed (Fig. 1d), suggesting that ACBP2 interacts with AtFP6 through these repeats. Expression of GAL4(BD)‐ACBP2ΔANK and GAL4(BD)‐ACBP2 proteins in transformed yeast was shown as cross‐reacted bands of 41.6 and 55.4 kDa, respectively, in western blot analysis (Fig. 1e).   In vitro protein‐binding assays confirmed the interaction between AtFP6 and ACBP2. SDS‐PAGE followed by autoradiography of [35S]methionine‐labelled in vitro‐translated GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2, AtFP6 and BnLPAAT (negative control) revealed that these proteins were translated as predicted from their calculated molecular masses (50.0, 19.6 and 43.0 kDa, respectively, in Fig. 1f). An autoradiography of the gel from binding assays showed that the GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2 fusion, immobilized to protein A/agarose beads using monoclonal antibodies against GAL4(TA), bound AtFP6 in vitro, in contrast to the negative control (Fig. 1f).  To verify that the ankyrin repeats of ACBP2 mediate protein–protein interactions, the ankyrin‐lacking 39.5‐kDa GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2ΔANK fusion and AtFP6 were tested in in vitro protein‐binding assays. Weaker binding of AtFP6 with GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2ΔANK than with GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2 (Fig. 1f) suggested that removal of these repeats affected the interaction between AtFP6 and ACBP2.  AtFP6 is predicted (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp) to be localized at the plasma membrane with high certainty (0.650). To experimentally verify the localization of AtFP6 in onion epidermal cells, we tagged AtFP6 to GFP. With GFP as a control (Fig. 2a), representative confocal images showed GFP:AtFP6 expression at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2b). When bombarded onion epidermal cells were subjected to plasmolysis, fluorescence was associated with the retracted plasma membrane (Fig. 2c,d).  [[FIGURE]] Subsequently, GFP:AtFP6 and DsRed:ACBP2 were transiently expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells by agroinfiltration. While controls GFP (Fig. 2e) and DsRed (Fig. 2f) were expressed throughout the cell, fluorescence from GFP:AtFP6 (Fig. 2g), DsRed:ACBP2 (Fig. 2h) and DsRed:ACBP2ΔANK (Fig. 2i) was observed at the plasma membrane.  In FRET analysis, green fluorescence (Fig. 2j) could be seen in control tobacco leaf cells expressing GFP:AtFP6 alone, and no emission contributed by GFP was detected in the red channel (Fig. 2k). However, for cells co‐expressing GFP:AtFP6 and DsRed:ACBP2, not only GFP:AtFP6 fluorescence (Fig. 2n) but also DsRed:ACBP2 fluorescence (Fig. 2o), which overlapped with the GFP signals (Fig. 2p), was detected, indicating that FRET occurred between GFP:AtFP6 and DsRed:ACBP2.  Northern blot analyses showed higher expression of ACBP2 and AtFP6 in roots, stems and flowers (Fig. 3a, lanes R, St and F), and lower expression in siliques and leaves (Fig. 3a, lanes Si and L). Their similar spatial expression patterns suggest that they can potentially interact in the co‐expressed organs. High expression in root and stem is particularly relevant to their possible roles in metal binding and translocation.  [[FIGURE]] RT‐PCR analysis was used to investigate AtFP6 expression in response to heavy metals. Following treatment of 3‐wk‐old A. thaliana with 1 mM of different heavy metal ions for 24 h, AtFP6 expression was up‐regulated by Cd(II) in roots and to a lesser extent in shoots (Fig. 3b). Northern blot analysis indicated that AtFP6 expression, which was not induced by Pb(II) and Cu(II), was induced by Cd(II) and Zn(II) in both roots and shoots. Following Zn(II) treatment, AtFP6 mRNA was rapidly degraded for as yet unknown reasons (Fig. 3c). ACBP2 expression in roots is Pb(II)‐inducible (Xiao et al., 2008) and was used as a positive control (Fig. 3c).  We previously used metal‐chelate affinity chromatography to demonstrate that ACBP2 binds Pb(II) in vitro (Xiao et al., 2008), and applied the same method here to test whether in vitro‐translated AtFP6, which has a metal‐binding motif (M/LXCXXC), binds Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II). ACBP6, which does not bind Pb(II) as well as ACBP1 (Xiao et al., 2008), was used as a control. SDS‐PAGE followed by autoradiography of [35S]methionine‐labelled proteins (Fig. 4a) indicated that AtFP6 (19.6 kDa) binds Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II) better than ACBP6 (15.5 kDa). ACBP2 (41.1 kDa) also bound Cd(II) and Cu(II). Binding of AtFP6 and ACBP2 to Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II) was inhibited by the metal chelator EDTA, suggesting that binding is dependent on divalent cations (Fig. 4a).  [[FIGURE]] In western blot analysis, the 21‐kDa (His)6‐AtFP6 expressed in E. coli was induced in both soluble and insoluble fractions after induction by IPTG for 2 and 3 h (Fig. 4b), respectively, in contrast to E. coli bearing vector pRSET B (Fig. 4b). The binding between (His)6‐AtFP6 and Pb(II) was examined by fluorescence analysis using dansylated proteins incubated with different concentrations of Pb(II). As (His)6‐ACBP2 binds Pb(II) in fluorescence analysis (Xiao et al., 2008), it served as a positive control. The fluorescence of dansylated AtFP6 increased in the presence of Pb(II) (Fig. 4c), suggesting that it binds Pb(II). The dissociation constants (Kd values) of Pb(II)‐binding derived from the Scatchard plot (not shown) for (His)6‐AtFP6 and (His)6‐ACBP2 were 10.1 and 12.4 µM, respectively.  Northern blot analysis was used to confirm the overexpression of AtFP6 mRNA in eight putative A. thaliana AtFP6 overexpressors. All eight lines overexpressed the AtFP6 mRNA, and results for two lines (AtFP6 ox‐4 and AtFP6 ox‐7) are shown (Fig. 5a). Five of these eight AtFP6‐overexpressing lines showed an approx. 3 : 1 (resistant:sensitive) segregation ratio in the T2 population when grown on kanamycin‐containing medium, indicative of one copy of the 35S::AtFP6 transgene. Subsequently, T3 homozygous transgenic plants from two lines (AtFP6 ox‐4 and AtFP6 ox‐7) were used for Cd(II) treatment. Root lengths of wild type and both AtFP6 overexpressors (AtFP6 ox‐4 and AtFP6 ox‐7) were similar 17 d after germination on MS medium (Fig. 5b) but AtFP6 overexpressors grew better than wild type on MS medium containing 0.15 mM CdCl2 (Fig. 5b). The relative root lengths of the two transgenic lines AtFP6 ox‐4 and AtFP6 ox‐7 grown on Cd(II)‐containing medium were 36.1 ± 2.7% and 36.7 ± 1.8%, respectively, of those of similar plants grown in MS medium (Fig. 5c). These values were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than those of wild type (28.9 ± 2.4%).  [[FIGURE]] To distinguish the effects of Cd(II) stress on seed germination from those of post‐germination development, A. thaliana seeds were germinated on MS medium for 5 d and transferred to either MS or MS medium containing 0.15 mM CdCl2 for 2 wk. Although no differences in root length were observed between wild type and AtFP6 overexpressors on MS medium, the root lengths of AtFP6 overexpressors were longer than those of wild type on Cd(II)‐containing medium (Fig. 5d). The relative root lengths of AtFP6 ox‐4 and AtFP6 ox‐7 grown on Cd(II)‐containing medium were 47.9 ± 1.1% and 45.2 ± 1.0%, respectively, of those of similar plants grown in MS medium (Fig. 5e). These values were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than those of wild type (36.9 ± 1.0%).  All seven putative A. thaliana lines overexpressing ACBP2 tested were shown to accumulate ACBP2 mRNA in northern blot analysis. Results from two such lines (ACBP2 ox‐3 and ACBP2 ox‐6) are shown in Fig. 5f. Four of seven lines showed an approx. 3:1 (resistant:sensitive) segregation ratio in the T2 population when grown on Basta‐containing medium, indicative of one copy of the 35S::ACBP2 transgene. Subsequently, T3 homozygous transgenic plants from two lines (ACBP2 ox‐3 and ACBP2 ox‐6) were used for Cd(II) treatment. Root lengths of wild type and ACBP2‐overexpressing lines were similar 17 d after germination on MS medium (Fig. 5g). Both ACBP2‐overexpressing lines (ACBP2 ox‐3 and ACBP2 ox‐6) grew better than wild type on MS medium containing 0.15 mM CdCl2 (Fig. 5g). The relative root lengths of ACBP2 ox‐3 and ACBP2 ox‐6 grown on Cd(II)‐containing medium were 38.3 ± 0.9% and 38.8 ± 0.5%, respectively, of those of similar plants grown in MS medium (Fig. 5h). These values were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than those of wild type (29.3 ± 0.5%).  To distinguish the effects of Cd(II) stress on seed germination from those of post‐germination development, A. thaliana seeds were germinated on MS medium for 5 d and transferred to either MS or MS medium containing 0.15 mM CdCl2 for 2 wk. Although no differences in root length were observed between wild type and ACBP2 overexpressors on MS medium, their root lengths were longer than those of wild type grown on Cd(II)‐containing medium (Fig. 5i). The relative root lengths of ACBP2 ox‐3 and ACBP2 ox‐6 grown on Cd(II)‐containing medium were 49.5 ± 3.1% and 53.1 ± 3.7%, respectively, of those of similar plants grown in MS medium (Fig. 5j). These values were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than those of wild type (35.3 ± 1.8%).  To investigate a possible role for ACBP2 in phospholipid repair following lipid peroxidation caused by heavy metal stress at the plasma membrane, we tested whether ACBP2 binds linoleoyl‐CoA and linolenoyl‐CoA. We previously showed, in Lipidex assays, that (His)6‐ACBP2 binds [14C]palmitoyl‐CoA but not [14C]oleoyl‐CoA, while the reverse applies for ACBP1 (Chye et al., 2000). Here, linoleoyl‐CoA and linolenoyl‐CoA were selected because linoleic acid and linolenic acid are the major fatty acids found in plants. Further, linoleoyl‐CoA is the major acyl‐CoA involved in acylation by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) (Stymne & Stobart, 1984), yeast (Tamaki et al., 2007) and mammals (Soupene et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008). We also examined the binding of (His)6‐ACBP1 to linoleoyl‐CoA and linolenoyl‐CoA, as ACBP1 binds Pb(II) in vitro and confers Pb(II) tolerance when overexpressed in transgenic A. thaliana (Xiao et al., 2008).  (His)6‐ACBP1 (Fig. 6a) and (His)6‐ACBP2 (Fig. 6b) were observed to bind [14C]linoleoyl‐CoA and [14C]linolenoyl‐CoA, suggesting that they may participate in the repair of peroxidized membrane lipids following heavy metal stress. The Kd values for [14C]linoleoyl‐CoA and [14C]linolenoyl‐CoA derived from the Scatchard plot (not shown) for (His)6‐ACBP1 were 1.1 and 1.2 µM, respectively. The Kd values for [14C]linoleoyl‐CoA, [14C]linolenoyl‐CoA and [14C]palmitoyl‐CoA derived from the Scatchard plot (not shown) for (His)6‐ACBP2 were 1.2, 3.3 and 20.2 µM, respectively.  [[FIGURE]] To further demonstrate that ACBP2 plays a role in phospholipid repair following lipid peroxidation resulting from heavy metal stress, wild type and ACBP2 overexpressors were treated with the external oxidant H2O2. Although no differences in root length were observed between wild type and ACBP2 overexpressors on MS medium, their root lengths were greater than those of wild type when grown on MS medium containing 1 mM H2O2 (Fig. 7a). The relative root lengths of ACBP2 ox‐3 and ACBP2 ox‐6 grown on H2O2‐containing medium were 37.8 ± 2.3% and 38.8 ± 2.9%, respectively, of those of similar plants grown on MS medium (Fig. 7b). These values were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than those of wild type (25.9 ± 1.6%).  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~!  Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. wild‐type Columbia (ecotype Col‐0) was grown in a growth chamber (8 : 16 h; 21 : 23°C dark:light). Seeds were surface‐sterilized in 20% Clorox supplemented with 0.1% Tween‐20 for 30 min and grown for 3 wk on Murashige & Skoog (1962) (MS) medium containing 2% sucrose, before 24 h of treatment in a 1 mM solution of Pb(NO3)2 (Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), CdCl2 (Aldrich), CuCl2 (Aldrich) or ZnCl2 (Aldrich) (Lee et al., 2005). Shoot and root samples were collected for total RNA extraction. For Cd(II) sensitivity tests, 3‐d‐old seeds grown on MS medium containing 2% sucrose, with or without 0.15 mM CdCl2, were transferred to fresh identical medium for vertical growth for 2 wk (Suzuki et al., 2002). To distinguish the effects of Cd(II) on germination from post‐germination development, 5‐d‐old seeds grown on MS medium were transferred for vertical growth for 2 wk to MS medium containing 2% sucrose with or without heavy metals (Xiao et al., 2008). For hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensitivity testing (Jasinski et al., 2008), seeds were grown vertically for 2 wk on MS medium containing 2% sucrose, with or without 1 mM H2O2 (BDH AnalaR, Poole, UK).  The 1.1‐kb ACBP2 coding region was cloned in the bait vector pBUTE, a pGBDU‐C1 derivative with a transcription factor of galactose gene cluster (GAL4) DNA‐binding domain (GAL4(BD)) (James et al., 1996). The resultant plasmid was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type strain PJ69‐4A (James et al., 1996). Library screening carried out at the Molecular Interaction Facility (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA) used an A. thaliana library collection representing cDNAs from flowering A. thaliana, in the prey vector pGADT7 (Clontech) with a GAL4 activation domain (GAL4(AD)) (James et al., 1996). This library was used to transform S. cerevisiae harbouring the pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2 bait vector. About 18 million independent transformants were obtained on [SD‐leu‐ura] medium. Twenty‐two putative positives selected on [SD‐leu‐ura‐his] medium were tested using colony filter β‐galactosidase assays. Prey plasmids rescued from putative positives were introduced into PJ69‐4A, harbouring the ACBP2 bait vector, for mating and selection assays followed by nucleotide analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgibin/BLAST).  An ankyrin‐lacking region encoding the first 229 (of 354) amino acids of ACBP2, generated by PCR using primers ML993 (5′‐GGATCCATGGGTGATTGGGCTCAAC‐3′; BamHI site underlined) and ML994 (5′‐CTGCAGTTATTCGGACTCCTCATCATAAA‐3′; PstI site underlined), was cloned into the pGEM‐T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The resultant plasmid pAT458, digested with BamHI and SalI, yielded a 0.7‐kb derived fragment that was cloned in pBUTE to generate bait pGAL4(BD)‐ACBP2ΔANK.  Expression of baits GAL4(BD)‐ACBP2ΔANK and GAL4(BD)‐ACBP2 in yeast was confirmed by western blot analysis. Yeast cells were harvested and total proteins extracted for sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) analysis, followed by western blot analysis using ECL membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK), anti‐GAL4(BD) monoclonal antibodies (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and goat anti‐mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (whole molecule)–alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to detect bait proteins.   In vitro protein‐binding assays (Li & Chye, 2004) were used to confirm the interaction between AtFP6 and ACBP2. The pKS‐GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2 construct and pKS‐Brassica napus lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (BnLPAAT) construct (control; gift of Dr M. Frentzen; GenBank accession number Z95637) have been described previously (Li & Chye, 2004). The AtFP6 coding region, generated by reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) using primers ML776 (5′‐ATGGGTGTTCTTGATCATGTCTC‐3′) and ML777 (5′‐TCACATGACCACACAAGCCG‐3′), was cloned into the pGEM‐T Easy vector. The 639‐bp ACBP2 fragment (amino acids 2–214, lacking ankyrin repeats) was similarly generated using primers ML904 (5′‐CAAGAATTCGGTGATTGGGCTCAACTTG‐3′; EcoRI site underlined) and ML905 (CAAAGATCTGGTTCCTCTTGAGTTGGAG‐3′; BglII site underlined). Following EcoRI and BglII digestion, the fragment was cloned into vector pKS‐GAL4(TA) (Li & Chye, 2004) to produce pKS‐GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2ΔANK.  [35S]Methionine‐labelled proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT® Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega) to investigate binding (Li & Chye, 2004). GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2 or GAL4(TA)‐ACBP2ΔANK was immobilized to protein A/agarose beads using monoclonal antibodies against GAL4(TA), incubated with the candidate protein on a rotating wheel for 6 h and washed four times with 1 ml of phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) washing buffer; the washed pellet was then analysed by SDS‐PAGE, followed by autoradiography.  A 0.46‐kb AtFP6 fragment encoding amino acids 1–153, amplified by RT‐PCR using primers ML845 (5′‐CACCTCGAGTTATGGGTGTTCTTGATCATGTC‐3′; XhoI site underlined) and ML846 (5′‐CATGGATCCTCACATGACCACACAAGCCG‐3′; BamHI site underlined), was cloned into the pGEM‐T Easy vector. The XhoI‐BamHI derived fragment was subsequently cloned into vector pGDG (Goodin et al., 2002) to fuse AtFP6 to the C‐terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed):ACBP2 fusion has been described previously (Li & Chye, 2004). The DsRed:ACBP2ΔANK fusion was constructed by cloning a BamHI‐SalI fragment from plasmid pAT458 into pGDR (Goodin et al., 2002).  The GFP:AtFP6 construct was introduced into onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermal cells with a Biolistic PDS‐1000/He system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). About 360 µg of gold particles (1.0‐µm diameter) coated with 0.9 µg of DNA was used per shot. Onion pieces were kept in darkness (22°C) for 15 h following bombardment. For cell plasmolysis following bombardment, the layer of epidermal cells was lifted and incubated in 1 M sucrose solution for 20 min (Li & Chye, 2003). Cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser‐scanning microscope (Zeiss, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with helium/neon lasers (Li & Chye, 2004). For each plasmid construct, 20–30 cells were imaged with similar results.   Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 derivatives containing autofluorescence‐tagged constructs were grown at 28°C overnight in Luria Bertani medium (LB) supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg ml−1) and streptomycin (25 µg ml−1). Following agroinfiltration of glasshouse (22°C)‐grown 6‐wk‐old tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Xanthi) leaves (Li & Chye, 2004), leaf epidermal cells were examined by confocal microscopy. For each plasmid construct, 10–15 cells were imaged with similar results.  Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs of GFP/DsRed were analysed using the confocal laser‐scanning microscope Zeiss LSM 510 META. FRET measurements of DsRed emission with zero contribution from GFP were obtained as described by Erickson et al. (2003), using the following settings: excitation, 488 nm; emission filter, bandpass 505/30 nm for GFP and bandpass 600/37 nm for DsRed.  Total RNA (20 µg) separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde was transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham). An ACBP2‐specific probe was prepared by random‐primed [32P]dCTP‐labelling a 0.5‐kb 5′‐end ACBP2 cDNA fragment. Hybridization was carried out in a solution containing 50% formamide at 42°C (Chye et al., 2000). Digoxigenin probes (Xiao et al., 2008) for induced expression were labelled using the PCR Digoxigenin Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) on a 0.89‐kb ACBP2 cDNA generated by RT‐PCR using primers ML194 (5′‐TCAAGGGGAGAGTTTCC‐3′) and ML205 (5′‐CGTCACCCAGAGGAGTC‐3′) and a 0.46‐kb AtFP6 cDNA generated using primers ML868 (5′‐CACGGATCCATGGGTGTTCTTGATCATGTC‐3′; BamHI site underlined) and ML869 (5′‐CATCTCGAGTCACATGACCACACAAGCC‐3′; XhoI site underlined). Hybridization and detection were performed following procedures described by Roche.  Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from 3‐wk‐old A. thaliana shoots or roots. First‐strand synthesis was carried out using the SuperscriptTM First‐Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen). AtFP6 was amplified using primers ML868 and ML869, and 18S rDNA using primers 18S‐F (5′‐CACCGCTTAACCCGAA‐3′) and 18S‐R (5′‐GTGAGGTCACGACCAG‐3′), with denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min, and an extension at 72°C for 10 min.  RT‐PCR‐derived coding regions of ACBP2, AtFP6 and ACBP6 were cloned into the pGEM‐T Easy vector for in vitro transcription/translation (Xiao et al., 2008). Primers used were: ACBP2 (ML902, 5′‐ATGGGTGATTGGGCTCAACT‐3′ and ML903, 5′‐TTAGTCTGCCTGCTTTGCAG‐3′), AtFP6 (ML776 and ML777) and ACBP6 (ML812, 5′‐TTCTCCGTCTTACACCGATT‐3′ and ML751, 5′‐GACATGGTGTGATCTCTTAAAAAAGCTTGA‐3′). [35S]Methionine‐labelled proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT® Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega).  Pb(II)‐, Cd(II)‐ and Cu(II)‐equilibrated matrices for metal‐binding assays were prepared by stripping Ni‐NTA agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) of nickel, and re‐equilibrating with 0.1 M Pb(NO3)2, CdCl2 or CuCl2 according to Xiao et al. (2008). The metal‐binding assays were performed according to Xiao et al. (2008). To determine if binding is dependent on divalent cations, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 50 mM.  Batch extractions of (His)6‐ACBP1 (Chye, 1998) and (His)6‐ACBP2 (Chye et al., 2000) were prepared using Ni‐NTA agarose. Proteins were concentrated using Centricon‐10 (Amicon, Billerica, MA, USA) spin‐columns.  The 0.46‐kb AtFP6 coding region, RT‐PCR generated using primers ML857 (5′‐CACCTCGAGCATGGGTGTTCTTGATCATGTC‐3′; XhoI site underlined) and ML858 (5′‐CATGAATTCTCACATGACCACACAAGCCG‐3′; EcoRI site underlined) followed by XhoI and EcoRI digestion, was cloned into vector pRSET B (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)Star pLysS (Invitrogen) transformants were cultured to an optical density (OD600nm) of 0.4 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl‐β‐D‐thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h. Cells were harvested and soluble and insoluble proteins were extracted for SDS‐PAGE, followed by western blot analysis using ECL membranes (Amersham) and the QIAexpress Ni‐NTA AP Conjugate (Qiagen) to detect (His)6‐tagged protein. Batch extraction of (His)6‐AtFP6 was carried out under native conditions using an anity column of Ni‐NTA agarose. The protein, eluted with a native elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole), was dialysed overnight using Spectra/Por® molecular porous membrane tubing (Spectrum Laboratory, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA).  Fluorescence analysis was used to quantify the binding of (His)6‐AtFP6 and (His)6‐ACBP2 to Pb(II) (Xiao et al., 2008).  The 1.5‐kb full‐length ACBP2 cDNA was cloned into the XhoI‐SpeI sites of binary vector pSMB (Mylne & Botella, 1998) to produce pAT377. Plasmid pSa7 (Xu et al., 2004), a derivative of pBI121 (Clontech), was digested with SalI to remove a 0.5‐kb fragment to produce vector pSa13. The 0.46‐kb AtFP6 cDNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI‐XhoI sites of vector pSa13 to produce pAT394. Plasmids pAT377 and pAT394 were used to transform A. tumefaciens LBA4404 for subsequent A. thaliana‘floral dip’ transformation (Clough & Bent, 1998). In ACBP2 transformation, T0 seedlings germinated on MS medium containing 50 µM glufosinate ammonium (Basta) were confirmed by PCR using a 35S promoter‐specific primer, 35SB (5′‐CAATCCCACTATCCTTCGCAAGACC‐3′), and an ACBP2‐specific primer, ML194. In AtFP6 transformation, T0 seedlings germinated on MS medium containing kanamycin (50 µg ml−1) were confirmed by PCR using the 35SB primer and the AtFP6‐specific primer ML777. Putative transformants were analysed by northern blotting.   In vitro binding assays (Leung et al., 2004) with [14C]linoleoyl‐CoA (American Radiolabelled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA), [14C]linolenoyl‐CoA (American Radiolabelled Chemicals) and [14C]palmitoyl‐CoA (Amersham) were carried out using LipidexTM‐1000 (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA). Purified recombinant ACBP (at a final concentration of 0.2 µM) was mixed with [14C]linoleoyl‐CoA, [14C]linolenoyl‐CoA or [14C]palmitoyl‐CoA, at final acyl‐CoA concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 4 µM, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and 400 µl of ice‐cold 50% slurry of LipidexTM‐1000 in binding buffer was added. Samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min at 4°C and a 200‐µl aliquot of the supernatant was taken for analysis of radioactivity counts using an LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA). Assays were performed in triplicate, with blanks, at each concentration of acyl‐CoA.
