!~ABS~! The sessile plants have evolved a large number of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) to modulate diverse biological processes, including plant innate immunity. Phosphorylation of the RLK/RLCK complex constitutes an essential step to initiate immune signaling. Two Arabidopsis plasma membrane-resident RLKs, flagellin-sensing 2 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1), interact with RLCK Botrytis-induced kinase 1 (BIK1) to initiate plant immune responses to bacterial flagellin. BAK1 directly phosphorylates BIK1 and positively regulates plant immunity. Classically defined as a serine/threonine kinase, BIK1 is shown here to possess tyrosine kinase activity with mass spectrometry, immunoblot, and genetic analyses. BIK1 is autophosphorylated at multiple tyrosine (Y) residues in addition to serine/threonine residues. Importantly, BAK1 is able to phosphorylate BIK1 at both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. BIK1Y150 is likely catalytically important as the mutation blocks both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activity, whereas Y243 and Y250 are more specifically involved in tyrosine phosphorylation. The BIK1 tyrosine phosphorylation plays a crucial role in BIK1-mediated plant innate immunity as the transgenic plants carrying BIK1Y150F, Y243F, or Y250F (the mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine) failed to complement the bik1 mutant deficiency in immunity. Our data indicate that plant RLCK BIK1 is a nonreceptor dual-specificity kinase and both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are required for its functions in plant immune signaling. Together with the previous finding of BAK1 to be autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues, our results unveiled the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade as a common regulatory mechanism that controls membrane-resident receptor signaling in plants and metazoans.
!~RES~! We previously reported that flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation depends on FLS2 and BAK1 (CITATION). Furthermore, we found that BIK1 associated with BAK1 when transiently coexpressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATION). To further investigate the role of BIK1 in FLS2/BAK1 receptor complex, we determined the association of BIK1 and BAK1 both in vivo and in vitro (FIG-REF). We transformed the HA epitope-tagged BIK1 under the control of its native promoter (pBIK1::BIK1-HA) into pBAK1::BAK1-GFP transgenic plants and performed the in vivo coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay in intact plants. BAK1-GFP immunoprecipitated BIK1-HA, as detected by Western blot with an α-HA antibody upon α-GFP antibody immunoprecipitation (FIG-REF). Consistently, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay indicated that BIK1 associated with BAK1 as indicated by the yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) signal primarily on the plasma membrane when coexpressing of BIK1 fused to the carboxyl-terminal half of YFP (BIK1-cYFP) and BAK1 fused to the amino-terminal half of YFP (BAK1-nYFP) in protoplasts (FIG-REF). Neither of the individual constructs emitted YFP signal in protoplasts (FIG-REF). To test whether BAK1 directly interacts with BIK1 through the cytosolic kinase domain, we performed an in vitro pull-down assay with GST-BIK1 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads as bait against BAK1 cytosolic domain (BAK1CD) fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) with an HA epitope tag. As shown in FIG-REF, MBP-BAK1CD could be pulled down by GST-BIK1, but not GST. Similarly, GST-BIK1 could be pulled down by MBP-BAK1CD amylose-agarose beads (Fig. S1). Taken together, the data demonstrate that BIK1 forms a complex with BAK1 by direct interaction with the BAK1 cytosolic kinase domain. [[FIGURE]] BIK1 is predicted to encode a serine/threonine-protein kinase with a typical kinase domain containing 11 motifs (I–XI), relatively short amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal (CT) domains (FIG-REF) (CITATION). Site-directed mutagenesis has suggested that several serine/threonine residues are important for its kinase activity and biological functions (CITATION, CITATION). However, the biochemical evidence of these phosphorylation sites is still lacking. To systemically examine BIK1 autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation mediated by BAK1, we performed a series of analyses of recombinant GST-BIK1 tryptic peptides by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after in vitro BIK1 autophosphorylation or BAK1 transphosphorylation reactions. Fourteen serine (S) residues and 10 threonine (T) residues were identified in BIK1 protein after autophosphorylation reaction (FIG-REF). Among these 24 residues, 12 (S19, S20, S26, S28, S32, S33, T35, T42, S48, S49, S54, and T56) are in the N terminus, 7 (S206, S233, S236, T237, T242, S252, and S253) are in the kinase domain, and 5 (T362, T368, T375, T378, and T386) are in the C terminus. We did not identify any phosphorylation residues with GST-BIK1 kinase inactive mutant (Km) protein, which carries a mutation in the putative ATP binding site. We further identified the BIK1 phosphorylation sites mediated by BAK1 with GST-BIK1Km as a substrate and MBP-BAK1CD as a kinase. Five serine or threonine sites (S26, S206, T237, T368, and T386) in BIK1 were phosphorylated by BAK1 (FIG-REF). Notably, all five serine/threonine sites were also BIK1 autophosphorylation sites. [[FIGURE]] In agreement with our previous mutagenesis studies that T237 is an important phosphorylation site of BIK1 in response to flg22 treatment (CITATION), MS analyses revealed that T237 was phosphorylated in both reactions of autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation by BAK1 (FIG-REF). To further confirm its importance, we mutagenized T237 to alanine (T237A) in GST-BIK1Km protein and tested its ability to be phosphorylated by MBP-BAK1CD. As shown in FIG-REF, BAK1CD directly phosphorylated BIK1Km in vitro in the presence of [32P]-γ-ATP, whereas the phosphorylation level of BIK1KmT237A by BAK1CD was largely reduced, suggesting that T237 is a major phosphorylation site for BAK1-mediated transphosphorylation on BIK1. In contrast, mutation of the adjacent S236 residue (S236A) in BIK1Km or BIK1KmT237A had little effect on its phosphorylation by BAK1CD (FIG-REF). Taken together, the data suggest that BIK1T237 residue is an important and major phosphorylation site in flg22-mediated signaling. Notably, T237 of BIK1 is equivalent to T450 of BAK1, based on the amino acid sequence alignment between the kinase domains of BIK1 and BAK1 (Fig. S2). MS analyses identified both T450 and T455 of BAK1 as major sites for autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation by BRI1 (CITATION). T455 is also a highly conserved site in RLK/RLCK family members (Fig. S2) (CITATION). To investigate whether these two sites are required for BAK1 to transphosphorylate BIK1, we generated MBP fusion proteins of BAK1CDT450A and BAK1CDT455N. As shown in FIG-REF, compared with WT BAK1CD, the kinase activity and transphosphorylation of BAK1CDT450A or BAK1CDT455N to BIK1Km were significantly reduced or completely eliminated. The similar result was obtained for BAK1CDT450A/T455N double mutant (FIG-REF). We previously reported that BIK1 was able to transphosphorylate BAK1 with the BAK1 kinase domain (BAK1K) as a substrate, which does not possess autophosphorylation activity due to the lack of jutax-membrane domain (CITATION). Interestingly, BAK1KT455N, but not BAK1KT450A, dramatically reduced the ability to be phosphorylated by BIK1 (FIG-REF), suggesting that T455 of BAK1 is an important phosphorylation site by BIK1. We also found that MBP-BAK1CD is able to phosphorylate GST-FLS2K (FIG-REF). The data suggest the entangled phosphorylation events in FLS2/BAK1/BIK1 complex. During the course of analyzing comprehensive MS data, we repetitively identified three tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y23, Y234, and Y250) in BIK1 autophosphorylation reactions (FIG-REF and FIG-REF and Fig. S3 A and B). This is a rather surprising finding as plant RLCKs have been classified as serine/threonine protein kinases (CITATION). To further confirm our MS data, we performed in vitro BIK1 phosphorylation assay and detected tyrosine phosphorylation with a specific α-phosphotyrosine antibody (α-pY Ab), which has been used to characterize tyrosine phosphorylation of BRI1 and BAK1 (CITATION, CITATION). As shown in FIG-REF, the in vitro expressed BIK1, but not BIK1Km, could cross-react strongly to α-pY Ab, indicating that BIK1 possesses tyrosine kinase activity. Thus, BIK1 is a dual-specificity kinase with both serine/threonine and tyrosine activities. We individually substituted two tyrosine residues identified by MS analysis (Y234 and Y250) and two other tyrosine residues (Y243 and Y245) in the BIK1 activation domain with phenylalanine (F) to test their involvement in BIK1 tyrosine phosphorylation (FIG-REF and Fig. S3C). The alignment of the BIK1 kinase domain with several Arabidopsis RLKs/RLCKs and human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) revealed that Y150 and Y250 of BIK1 are highly conserved in all these RLKs/RLCKs (Fig. S2). These two corresponding residues in BRI1 (BRI1Y956 and BRI1Y1057) are essential for BRI1 kinase activity (CITATION). In addition, BIK1Y316 is conserved in PBL1 and BAK1 (Fig. S2). Thus, we also created BIK1Y150F and BIK1Y316F for tyrosine activity assays. Compared with WT BIK1, BIK1Y150F, BIK1Y243F, and BIK1Y250F mutant proteins exhibited dramatically reduced or compromised cross-reactivity to α-pY Ab, whereas BIK1Y234F, BIK1Y245F, and BIK1Y316F retained WT tyrosine kinase activity (FIG-REF). Notably, BIK1Y150F mutant also dramatically reduced threonine and/or serine kinase activity as detected with an α-phosphothreonine antibody (α-pT) (FIG-REF) or autoradiograph with [32P]-γ-ATP (FIG-REF). Apparently, Y150 is essential for BIK1 catalytic activity. Significantly, BIK1Y243F and BIK1Y250F had no or little effect on threonine and/or serine kinase activity (FIG-REF). Thus, Y243 and Y250 are important tyrosine phosphorylation sites of BIK1. [[FIGURE]] BIK1 is a substrate of BAK1 and BAK1 possesses tyrosine kinase activity (CITATION, CITATION). Thus, we determined whether BIK1 could serve as a tyrosine kinase substrate of BAK1 with α-pY Ab. As shown in FIG-REF, BIK1Km could be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by MBP-BAK1CD as indicated by α-pY Ab. Consistent with a previous report (CITATION), BAK1CD exhibited strong tyrosine autophosphorylation activity (FIG-REF). Importantly, Y243 and Y250 were identified as phosphorylation sites of BIK1 by BAK1 from MS analyses (FIG-REF). The data further unveiled the importance of BIK1Y243 and BIK1Y250 autophosphorylation and/or BAK1 transphosphorylation. Consistently, the tyrosine phosphorylation of BIK1KmY243F and BIK1KmY250F by BAK1CD was reduced compared with that of BIK1Km (FIG-REF), suggesting the important role in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation by BAK1. The overall phosphorylation of BIK1KmY243F and BIK1KmY250F by BAK1 as detected by autoradiograph of [32P]-γ-ATP remained comparable to that of BIK1Km (FIG-REF). Thus, BIK1 is a tyrosine kinase substrate of BAK1, and Y243 and Y250 are two important BIK1 sites that are phosphorylated by BAK1. [[FIGURE]] BIK1 is quickly phosphorylated upon flg22 perception as shown with a mobility shift by Western blot (CITATION). We examined flg22-mediated BIK1 tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo with an α-pY Ab after immunoprecipitation of protoplast-expressed BIK1-GFP (FIG-REF). The mobility shift of BIK1-GFP detected by an α-GFP antibody indicates flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation (FIG-REF). Importantly, the α-pY Ab showed cross-reactivity to the immunoprecipitated BIK1 either with or without flg22 treatment, providing the evidence that BIK1 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in vivo (FIG-REF). Notably, both the shifted and unshifted BIK1 bands could be detected by α-pY Ab, suggesting that BIK1 has a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of flg22 treatment. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the role of specific tyrosine residues of BIK1 in vivo, we created the above mentioned tyrosine mutants in protoplast expression vector and tested their effect on flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation. Consistent with its requirement in catalytic activity, BIK1Y150F dramatically reduced the ratio of shifted band versus unshifted band upon flg22 treatment (FIG-REF). Significantly, BIK1Y250F also lost the flg22-induced mobility shift compared with WT BIK1 (FIG-REF). In addition, the mobility shift of BIK1Y245F was also partially compromised upon flg22 treatment (FIG-REF). However, BIK1Y234, BIK1Y243, and BIK1Y316 seem to be dispensable for flg22-induced BIK1 mobility shift (FIG-REF). This result reconciles our MS and biochemical analysis in which Y250 is an important BIK1 autophosphorylation and BAK1-mediated transphosphorylation site, suggesting its essential role in flg22-mediated signaling. Overexpression of BIK1 in protoplasts could constitutively activate the pFRK1::LUC reporter gene, a marker gene in PTI signaling (CITATION). Consistently, expression of BIK1Y150F or BIK1Y250F in protoplasts was no longer able to activate pFRK1::LUC, whereas BIK1Y234F, BIK1Y243F, BIK1Y245F, or BIK1Y316F partially compromised the activation of pFRK1::LUC (FIG-REF). These results establish that Y150 and Y250 are two essential sites of BIK1 in flg22-triggered phosphorylation and signaling. However, BIK1Y23F mutant retained WT tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. S3D) and did not impair flg22-induced BIK1 mobility shift (Fig. S3E) and the activation of pFRK1::LUC (Fig. S3F), suggesting that mutation of Y23 does not affect its function in flg22 signaling. To further elucidate the functional significance of specific tyrosine residues of BIK1, we complemented the bik1 mutant plants with HA epitope-tagged WT BIK1 or various mutants, including BIK1Km, Y150F, Y243F, and Y250F under the control of its native promoter. Multiple lines of each construct were obtained and two lines with comparable protein expression level as WT BIK1 for each construct were chosen for further assays. The bik1 mutant compromises various flg22-triggered immune responses, including flg22-induced ROS production, and resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) infection (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). The WT BIK1 construct completely restored, whereas BIK1Km, BIK1Y150F, BIK1Y243F, or BIK1Y250F still retained the compromised flg22-induced ROS production in the bik1 mutant compared with Col-0 WT or empty vector transgenic plants in Col-0 background (FIG-REF and Fig. S4A). The bik1 mutant is more resistant to Pst infection, but is unable to mediate flg22-induced resistance. As shown in FIG-REF, the expression of WT BIK1, but not BIK1Km, BIK1Y150F, BIK1Y243F, or BIK1Y250F in the bik1 mutant plant was able to restore WT level resistance to Pst infection and flg22-mediated resistance to Pst infection (FIG-REF). Similar to enhanced resistance to Pst infection, the bik1 mutant is more resistant to P. syringae maculicola (Psm) infection compared with WT plants, indicated by in planta bacterial multiplication 2- and 3-d postinoculation (dpi) (FIG-REF) and disease symptom development (FIG-REF). The bik1 mutant plants expressing WT BIK1 exhibited a similar susceptibility to Psm infection as WT plants, whereas the bik1 mutant plants expressing BIK1Km, BIK1Y150F, BIK1Y243F, or BIK1Y250F showed a similar level of resistance with the bik1 mutant, 2 and 3 dpi (FIG-REF and Fig. S4B). The bik1 mutant is more susceptible to Botrytis cinerea infection (CITATION). The bik1 transgenic plants with BIK1Km or tyrosine substitution mutants were as susceptible as the bik1 mutant compared with WT plants as measured by symptom development (FIG-REF and Fig. S4C) and lesion diameter (FIG-REF and Fig. S4C) after B. cinerea infection. Taken together, our genetic analysis indicate that Y150, Y243, and Y250 are important for BIK1 functions in plant innate immunity and BIK1 tyrosine phosphorylation constitutes an essential step in PTI signaling. In addition to the compromised immune responses, the bik1 mutant exhibits certain growth defects, in particular at the later developmental stage with early flowering, and twisted and curling rosette leaves (CITATION). The WT BIK1 complementation plants rescued these growth defects in the bik1 mutants (Fig. S5). However, the transgenic plants carrying either BIK1Km, BIK1Y150F, BIK1Y243F, or BIK1Y250F resembled the bik1 mutant with curling rosette leaves at later developmental stage and early flowering phenotypes (Fig. S5). These observations indicate that the kinase activity and the tyrosine residues (Y150, Y243, and Y250) are also required for BIK1 functions in growth and development. [[FIGURE]]
