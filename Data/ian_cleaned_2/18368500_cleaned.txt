!~ABS~! Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundant and highly conserved molecular chaperone. In Arabidopsis, the Hsp90 gene family consists of seven members. Here, we report that the AtHsp90-6 gene gives rise to two mRNA populations, termed AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S due to alternative initiation of transcription. The AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S transcription start sites are located 228 nucleotides upstream and 124 nucleotides downstream of the annotated translation start site, respectively. Both transcripts are detected under normal or heat-shock conditions. The inducibility of AtHsp90-6 mRNAs by heat shock implies a potential role of both isoforms in stress management. Stable transformation experiments with fusion constructs between the N-terminal part of each AtHsp90-6 isoform and green fluorescent protein indicated import of both fusion proteins into mitochondria. In planta investigation confirmed that fusion of the AtHsp90-5 N-terminus to green fluorescent protein (GFP) did result in specific chloroplastic localization. The mechanisms of regulation for mitochondria- and plastid-localized chaperone-encoding genes are not well understood. Future work is needed to address the possible roles of harsh environmental conditions and developmental processes on fine-tuning and compartmentalization of the AtHsp90-6L, AtHsp90-6S, and AtHsp90-5 proteins in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! The full-length Hsp90-6 protein of the Arabidopsis thaliana is reported in the NCBI database to contain 803 amino acid residues. However, the open reading frame of the corresponding cDNA (NM_111652) contains four in-frame translation initiation codons at the N-terminal region (107 aa) (AUG1-AUG4; Fig. 1). Therefore the cDNA could potentially encode for proteins starting at any initiation codon. The consensus sequence for translational initiation is defined as (-6)GCCA/GCCAUGG/A(+4) with positions −3 and +4 being the most critical (Kozak CITATION). Inspection of the genomic sequence of AtHsp90-6 revealed that the first two AUGs (AUG-1 and AUG-2) are located within a sequence context matching the demand of Kozak’s rule. In contrast, AUG-3 and AUG-4 are located within a poor Kozak configuration to be considered as initiation codons. These observations led us to investigate whether AtHsp90-6 could be a multifunctional gene, coding for various forms of Hsp90 by alternative use of transcription/translation initiation codons. [[FIGURE]]  Primer extension analysis was performed to determine the potential transcription initiation sites of AtHsp90-6. The results indicated that two major transcript ends can be detected in A. thaliana: one mapping 228 nucleotides upstream of the first translation start site (AUG-1) and one mapping 210 nucleotides upstream of the second translation start site (AUG-2) (Fig. 2). Consequently, it is very likely that the AtHsp90-6 gene has multiple transcriptional start sites. The first exon of the longer transcript (designated AtHsp90-6L) is identical to that deposited in the Arabidopsis genome database. The ATG start codon, of the shorter transcript (designated AtHsp90-6S), is located within the second exon of the AtHsp90-6L. The 5′-region of the AtHsp90-6L sequence contains a predicted intron of 137 bp (Fig. 2a). The DNA sequence conservation rule near the exon–intron boundaries is fulfilled, with GT located at the initiation and AG at the termination sites of the intron, respectively. To corroborate the presence of two different mRNA populations corresponding to AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S, RT-PCR analysis was performed using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers specific for the 5′-UTR (RC4, RC2 and RC6), intron 1 (RC5, RC3 and rRC3), exon 4 (RC15), and exon 12 (RC1), as shown in Fig. 3. DNA fragments of different sizes were amplified and the two transcript populations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the RT-PCR products. The corresponding cDNAs did not contain any intron sequences. As anticipated, no amplification products were obtained using primer combinations RC4-RC1 and RC5-RC1 while the primer combination RC3-RC1 produced the predicted fragment. Since both RC3 and RC5 primers are located within the first intron and the latter covers the determined initiation of transcription (Fig. 2), the existence of the smaller mRNA is expected. To rule out the possibility that the PCR products originated from contaminating genomic DNA, additional RT-PCR reactions were performed. Reverse primer rRC3 (located in the first intron) together with the sense primers RC6 or RC2 did not produce any amplification fragments. Sequencing of both cDNAs deriving from the long and short transcripts showed that they were identical except for the 5′ ends. We therefore concluded that AtHsp90-6 produces at least two different mRNAs encoding AtHsp90-6L (799 amino acids from 20 exons) and AtHsp90-6S (733 amino acids from 19 exons) proteins. It should be noted that the AtHsp90-6 gene in the NCBI database possesses 21 exons. However a careful comparison of the genomic sequence to the cDNA sequences obtained in the course of the present study revealed that AtHsp90-6 consists of 20 exons. This error is due to a misannotation of the intron/exon boundaries for exons 16 and 17. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  In silico analysis of the 1 kb region upstream of the AtHsp90-6 gene transcription start sites revealed the presence of a heat-shock element (HSE) consisting of three perfect and one imperfect core units (cTTCaaaTCcaGAAgcTTCg) (Fig. 2A). Two CCAAT sequences were identified near the putative HSE. It has been reported that CCAAT-box sequences (representing the binding sites for the C/EBP transcription factors) act cooperatively with HSEs (Rieping and Schoffl CITATION; Prasinos et al. CITATION). Interestingly, no perfect TATA boxes were identified. Further inspection of the promoter region revealed the presence of potential binding sites for various transcription factors including activating-enhancer protein 1 (AP-1), mitochondrial stress response element (MSR-like), and stress response element (STRE) (data not shown). These cis-elements play important roles in regulating expression of genes in response to heat shock, heavy metal, dehydration, low temperature, light, and pathogen elicitors (Haralampidis et al. CITATION; Zhao et al. CITATION; Takahashi et al. CITATION). However, the biological significance of the putative elements within the promoter region of the AtHsp90-6 remains to be verified experimentally. Since our results suggested that the annotated Met codon (AUG-1) might not serve as the only site for the initiation of translation, we investigated whether this Met codon was dispensable for translation of the gene. Given that every ATG codon is not necessarily used for translation initiation, we attempted to translate in vitro the two AtHsp90-6 coding sequences. Open reading frames encoding 584 or 518 amino acids of the AtHsp90-6L or AtHsp90-6S cDNA, respectively, were cloned into the pGEM vector and the resulting polypeptide products were 35S methionine labeled in a TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System. As shown in Fig. 2c, two translation products of 65 or 58 kDa were produced from the long or the short AtHsp90-6 template, respectively. These results suggested that both ATGs are suited for translation initiation, as predicted by the presence of typical Kozak sequences. We therefore propose that the Hsp90-6 isoforms were not generated by alternative splicing but resulted from the utilization of alternative transcription initiation sites. The majority of nuclear-encoded organellar proteins are translated by cytosolic ribosomes and directed to the appropriate organelle by the N-terminal signal peptides. Sequence comparison between members of the AtHsp90 protein family revealed that AtHsp90-6L, AtHsp90-6S, and AtHsp90-5 contain a highly variable N-terminal region composed of 28–94 amino acids (Fig. 4). In the case of AtHsp90-6L, the targeting peptide is predicted to be 31 amino acids long as determined by in silico analysis (MitoProt). The intracellular prediction program TargetP indicated that AtHsp90-6L could be localized to both mitochondria and chloroplasts, whereas Predotar predicted only mitochondrial localization. Interestingly, in the case of AtHsp90-6S, in silico protein targeting analysis indicated that the translation initiation at the AUG-2 start codon did not contain any organelle target sequence. To determine the intracellular targeting of AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S proteins in planta, pK90-6LGFP and pK90-6SGFP reporter constructs were used for Arabidopsis transformation (Fig. 5a). Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing the fusion proteins were established and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. Both pK90-6LGFP and pK90-6SGFP fusion proteins were detected in numerous spherical bodies of root-hair cells (Fig. 5b). Staining with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker Orange (Molecular Probes) revealed co-localization with the GFP fluorescent signals, confirming that pK90-6LGFP and pK90-6SGFP fusion proteins were delivered into mitochondria. In control plants, only red and no green fluorescence was detected (data not shown). To investigate whether any of the two fusion proteins had a dual targeting to both mitochondria and chloroplasts, isolated Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were analyzed. Using the autofluorescence of chlorophyll as a marker, it was clear that the GFP signal did not co-localize with the red chlorophyll autofluorescence (Fig. 5b lower panel). The above results indicate that the N-terminal sequences present in pK90-6LGFP and pK90-6SGFP include a mitochondrial targeting sequence that is necessary and sufficient to transport the fusion proteins into mitochondria. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  There are many and varied ways by which cross-compartment targeting is achieved by nuclear-encoded organellar proteins including N-terminal and internal signal sequences. Computer-assisted analysis for localization signals predicted that the AtHsp90-5 protein has a 60-amino-acid transit peptide (TP) (Fig. 4). The intracellular prediction program TargetP indicated that the AtHsp90-5 could be localized to both chloroplasts and mitochondria, while Predotar predicted only chloroplastic localization. To independently verify the plastidic localization of AtHsp90-5 in planta, a pK90-5GFP fusion construct was used to generate stably transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Targeting of the encoded fusion protein was monitored using epifluorescence microscopy presented in Fig. 6. The green fluorescence of GFP clearly co-localized with the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll (Fig. 6b, middle panels), demonstrating that the protein was efficiently targeted to chloroplasts. To investigate whether the fusion protein was also targeted to mitochondria, Arabidopsis root cells were analyzed. Using Mitotracker as a fluorescent marker for mitochondria, it was clear that the detected GFP signal in plastids of root cells did not overlap with the red Mitotracker fluorescence signal (Fig. 6b lower panel). In transgenic lines harboring the GFP control construct (pK90-1GFP), the fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, corroborating the principally cytosolic localization reported for wild-type GFP (Fig. 6b, upper panel). [[FIGURE]]  In order to investigate how the abundance of AtHsp90-5, AtHsp90-6L, and AtHsp90-6S was regulated under control or heat-stress conditions, we determined the levels of the corresponding transcripts using semiquantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from 28-day-old plants. AtHsp90-1 mRNA levels were also monitored (Fig. 7a). Whereas a strong GAPDH-derived band was observed, neither AtHsp90-5- nor AtHsp90-6-derived transcript was detectable after 25 cycles of PCR (data not shown). After 30 cycles of PCR amplification, AtHsp90-6S mRNA was detected under heat-stress conditions whereas after 35 cycles, both AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S mRNAs were amplified under control or heat-shock conditions. The results indicate that the expression profile of both transcript forms is similar; however AtHsp90-6S was expressed at higher levels under the conditions tested. AtHsp90-5 expression levels were low under control or heat-shock conditions. As shown previously, AtHsp90-5 mRNA levels were almost undetectable in mature plants, suggesting that the expression of AtHsp90-5 is developmentally regulated (Cao et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  To determine whether the expression pattern of the fused genes in the transgenes harboring the constructs pK90-1:GFP, pK90-5:GFP, pK90-6L:GFP or pK90-6S:GFP resembled that of the corresponding endogenous AtHsp90 mRNA levels, RT-PCR analysis was performed. Twenty-eight-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring a single transgene copy were exposed to 37°C for 0 or 2 h. RNA was reverse-transcribed from a pool of ten independent transgenic lines and the expression profiles of the AtHsp90-1, AtHsp90-5, AtHsp90-6L, and AtHsp90-6S were determined. Transcription patterns of the GFP gene constructs and the corresponding endogenous genes were similar for both GFP transgenes and wild-type plants (Fig. 7a, b). However, in transgenic plants, the GFP fusion transcript levels were higher than the endogenous under heat-shock conditions, suggesting a stronger interaction of the AtHsp90-1 promoter to Hsfs and/or a difference in mRNA stability (Salvador et al. CITATION).
!~MM~!  Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown under standard conditions at 22°C under 70% humidity with a light/dark cycle of 16 h/8 h. After transformation, seeds from individual transgenic plants were imbibed at 4°C overnight, surface sterilized, and layered on MS medium containing 50 mg l−1 kanamycin and 200 mg l−1 cefotaxime, under the same growth conditions. Transgenic plants were transferred to soil for further analysis.  Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts were isolated as previously described (Doelling and Pikaard CITATION). Total RNA was extracted from 28-day-old Arabidopsis plants using the RNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen). Primer extension analysis was carried out using the Primer Extension System—AMV Reverse Transcriptase kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used: PRET-1, 5′-ACGGAGCGCTTAGAGAGCCTGATC-3′ (AtHsp90-6L) and PRET-2, 5′-CTGCACTGGATTCGTTCCGGTATC-3′ (AtHsp90-6S). PRET-1 and PRET-2 are located 3 bp and 23 bp downstream of the translation start sites, respectively. Total RNA was extracted as described above. To assess heat induction, 28-day-old plants were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. After treatment, intact plants were harvested and used for RNA preparation. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics). The primers were as follows: for AtHsp90-6L, RC4 5′-TCGCTCGATACGTTTGATGGTAC-3′ (RC4 is located 265 bp upstream of AtHsp90-6L transcription start site), RC2 5′-ACAAGCCAATAAGGTTTTAATCAGG-3′ (RC2 starts 4 bp upstream of AtHsp90-6L transcription start site), and RC6 5′-CTACCGAAATCAAAATCCACCATTC-3 (RC6 is located 169 bp downstream of AtHsp90-6L transcription start site); for AtHsp90-6S, RC5 5′-TTCATTTCAATTTCCTTCATC-3′ (RC5 starts 14 bp upstream of AtHsp90-6S transcription start site), RC3 5′-TGATTGGATTACTTACAGTGTCACTA-3′ (RC3 is located 78 bp downstream of AtHsp90-6S transcription start site), rRC3 5′-TAGTGACACTGTAAGTAATCCAATCA-3′ (the same position as for RC3), and rRC5 -5′-GATGAAGGAAATTGAAATGAA-3′ (the same position as for RC5). Two primers were designed in common for AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S cDNAs: RC15, 5′-GATTCCATTCTCCTTGTCTGCATAG-3′; RC1, 5′-CCGATGGTGAAACAGGTGGCACATA-3′ (RC15 and RC1 are located 698/483 bp and 1434/1219 bp downstream of AtHsp90-6L/AtHsp90-6S transcription start sites, respectively). The following primers were used for the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-mediated (RT) PCR experiments: AtHsp90-1, 5′-CGCATGTTCAGATGGCTGATGC-3′ and 5′-AGCAGAGTAGAAACCAACACC-3′; for AtHsp90-5, 5′-CTAATGGCTCCTGCTTTGAGTAGAAG-3′ and 5′- ACCAAACTGTCCGATCAAACCGT-3′; for AtHsp90-6L, RC15 5′-GATTCCATTCTCCTTGTCTGCATAG-3′ and RC6 5′-CTACCGAAATCAAAATCCACCATTC-3′; for AtHsp90-6S, RC15 5′-GATTCCATTCTCCTTGTCTGCATAG-3′ and RC7 5′-GGATCCGGTCATTTGCTCAATTGAACATG-3′; and for GFP, GFP-1 5′-GGAGATATAACAATGAGTAAAGGAGAA-3′ and GFP-2 5′-TTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCAT-3′. For the analysis of differential expression, three rounds of RT-PCR were conducted with two independently isolated total RNA samples. RT-PCR was performed for 15, 20, 25, 28, 30, and 35 cycles to determine the linearity of the PCR. The thermal cycling parameters used for the RT-PCR for all genes were as follows: 94°C for 15 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min; followed by 72°C for 10 min. As a positive control, a 540 bp AtGAPDH fragment was amplified under the same RT-PCR conditions for a total of 20 cycles using the primer pair 5′-GCAATGCATCTTGCACTACCAACTGTC-3′ and 5′-CTGTGAGTAACCCCATTCATTATCSTACCA-3′. The sequence identity of all RT-PCR products obtained was confirmed by sequencing. The amplified cDNAs were subcloned using the pGEM-T vector system (Promega) and sequenced using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit with fluorescent sequencing (FS) AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Database searches were performed on the NCBI web server by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) network service. Subcellular localization predictions were performed using Predotar (http://www.inra.fr/predotar/), TargetP (http://www.cbsdtu.dk/services/TargetP/), ChloroP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/), and MitoProt (http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html). In order to produce plasmids for in vitro transcription and translation reactions, an AtHsp90-6AUG1 open reading frame (ORF) (584 amino acid encoding sequence) and an AtHsp90-6AUG2 ORF (518 amino acids encoding sequence) were subcloned into pGEM vector (Promega). The AtHsp90-6AUG1 ORF and AtHsp90-6AUG2 ORFs were amplified with the common reverse primer TRANS-C 5′-TACTACTTCAAGTCCTTTCTCCAGC-3′ and the forward primer TRANS-1 5′-TCTCTTCCGAGATTTTAGAAGTTTGC-3′ and TRANS-2 5′-CAATCTAAGAATAGTGGGTCAT-3′, respectively. The plasmids were linearized downstream of the T7 transcription terminator and the corresponding proteins were synthesized by using the TNT coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 35S methionine-labeled proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% gels. The plasmid constructs for Arabidopsis transformation were assembled as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. For targeting analysis of the protein encoded by AtHsp90-5 transcripts, an N-terminal fragment of the AtHsp90-5 gene (576 bp) was amplified by using the following primers: 121F 5′-CTAATGGCTCCTGCTTTGAGTAGAAG-3′ and 121R 5′-GTTGTCAGCACCAAGGTCCTTGTT-3′. For the construct based on the long transcript of the AtHsp90-6 gene, a 510 bp fragment was amplified with primers RC21 5′-TAGAAGTTTGCGACGATGAT-3′ and RC15, whereas for the corresponding construct of the short transcript, a 317 bp fragment of AtHsp90-6 was amplified with primers RC20 5′-GGTCATTTGCTCAATTGAACATG-3′ and RC15. The amplified fragments were subsequently fused in-frame upstream of the smGFP sequence and cloned into the pBI101 binary vector under the control of the AtHsp90-1 promoter (Haralampidis et al. CITATION). The constructs obtained were named as follows: pK90-5GFP, N-terminal 190 amino acid residues of AtHsp90-5 fused to GFP; pK90-6LGFP, N-terminal 164 amino acid residues of AtHsp90-6L fused to GFP; and pK90-6SGFP, N-terminal 98 amino acid residues of AtHsp90-6S fused to GFP. All constructs were sequenced to check the accuracy of amplification and translational fusions and were used to transform the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101::pGV2260 by the direct transfer method (An et al. CITATION). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were obtained by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION). Localization of GFP fusions was analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with an Olympus DP71 microscope digital camera. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants were heat shocked for 2 h at 37°C before GFP fluorescence was analyzed. Mitochondria were visualized with the fluorescent probe MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (M7510, Molecular Probes, USA) as a counterstain. The plants were suspended in MS medium containing 25 nM MitoTracker and incubated for 30 min at 22°C before analyzing the fluorescence. The following filter sets were used: for GFP, exciter HQ470/40, dichroic Q495LP, and emitter HQ525/50; for MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos, exciter BP 546/12, beam-splitter FT 580, emitter LP 590; and for chlorophyll autofluorescence, 633-nm excitation and 680 nm emission.
