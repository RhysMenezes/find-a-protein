!~ABS~! The ROF2 (FKBP65) is a heat stress protein which belongs to the FK506 Binding Protein (FKBP) family. It is homologous to ROF1 (FKBP62) which was recently shown to be involved in long term acquired thermotolerance by its interaction with HSP90.1 and modulation of the heat shock transcription factor HsfA2. In this study, we have demonstrated that ROF2 participates in long term acquired thermolerance, its mode of action being different from ROF1. In the absence of ROF2, the small heat shock proteins were highly expressed and the plants were resistant to heat stress, opposite to the effect observed in the absence of ROF1. It was further demonstrated that ROF2 transcription is modulated by HsfA2 which is also essential for keeping high levels of ROF2 during recovery from heat stress. ROF2 localization to the nucleus was observed several hours after heat stress exposure and its translocation to the nucleus was independent from the presence of HSP90.1 or HsfA2. ROF2 has been shown to interact with ROF1, to form heterodimers and it is suggested that via this interaction it can join the complex ROF1-HSP90.1- HsfA2. Transient expression of ROF2 together with ROF1 repressed transcription of small HSPs. A model describing the mode of action of ROF2 as a heat stress modulator which functions in negative feedback regulation of HsfA2 is proposed.
!~RES~! In the heat stress response, several transcription factors are responsible for expression of heat stress proteins (HSPs; Baniwal et al. CITATION; von Koskull-Doring et al. CITATION). However, during the period of recovery from heat stress, HsfA2 is the major transcription factor of the sHSPs in Arabidopsis (Charng et al. CITATION; Schramm et al. CITATION). Since it was shown that the accumulation pattern of ROF2 resembles members of the sHSPs family (Aviezer-Hagai et al. CITATION), we checked the possibility that HsfA2 is involved in regulation of ROF2 transcription in the recovery period. The function of HsfA2 as a transcription factor of ROF2 was demonstrated by two approaches: (a) HsfA2 was transiently expressed in wild type Arabidopsis plants and the ROF2 transcript level was monitored. As can be seen, HsfA2 induced the transcription of ROF2 (Fig. 1a); (b) The effect of HsfA2 on ROF2 promoter activity was tested in transgenic plants harboring the GUS reporter gene downstream to the ROF2 promoter. Histochemical X-gluc staining of the transgenic plants, transiently expressing HsfA2, displayed high activity of ROF2 promoter as compared to the control plants in three independent lines (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that HsfA2 functions as a transcription factor of ROF2, and are supported by recent publications showing that overexpression of HsfA2 in Arabidopsis plants results in high levels of ROF2 transcription (Ogawa et al. CITATION; Yokotani et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  To reveal the specific role of ROF2 in heat stress response, we focused on the recovery period from heat stress. Our recent results suggest that HsfA2, in complex with HSP90.1 and ROF1, maintains the expression levels of sHSPs (Meiri and Breiman CITATION) known to be essential for thermotolerance (Larkindale and Vierling CITATION; Dafny-Yelin et al. CITATION). Therefore we analyzed the expression level of ROF2 in rof1 (R1−) and HsfA2 (H−) knockout plants upon recovery from exposure to 37°C. After plants were exposed to heat stress and a recovery period of 24 h, the transcript levels of ROF1, HsfA2 and ROF2 were determined. Whereas ROF1 transcript level was not affected in the HsfA2 mutant, ROF2 transcript levels decreased in rof1 knockout mutant, and could not be detected in the HsfA2 mutants, (Fig. 2a, b). [[FIGURE]]  In order to find out how ROF2 affects the abundance of sHSPs, in the recovery period, we determined the transcription profile of several sHSPs using rof2 silenced plants. In all rof2 silenced plants the expression level of HSP17.6-CII, 18.1-CI, 25.3-P and Hsa32, after 24 h of recovery from heat stress, was higher then in wild type (Fig. 3a, b). Thus, surprisingly the accumulation of the sHSPs correlated inversely with the expression level of ROF2. In the fully silenced ROF2 plants (21, 22), the accumulation of the sHSPs was the highest, whereas in the partially silenced ROF2 plant (D23), the level of the sHSPs was lower (Fig. 3a, b). Using antibodies which recognize class I sHSPs proteins, an increase in abundance of the sHSPs proteins in the absence of ROF2 (R2−) was shown after 24 and 48 h of recovery from heat stress (37°C) relatively to the wild type (Fig. 3c). This is in contrast to the decrease in the sHSPs level shown in the absence of ROF1(R1−) after recovery (Fig. 3c). The protein abundance correlates well with the transcript levels (Fig. 3a). [[FIGURE]]  These results demonstrate that during recovery from heat stress, in the absence of ROF2, the levels of sHSPs increase while in the absence of ROF1 the levels of sHSPs decrease. Changes in the sHSPs accumulation directly affect the plant ability to cope with AT, as observed in HsfA2 and rof1 knockout mutants (Charng et al. CITATION; Meiri and Breiman CITATION). Therefore, the ability of rof2 silenced plants to cope with AT was characterized. The plants were exposed to heat stress at 37°C followed by short and long recovery times before exposure to the high temperature of 45°C (Fig. 4). All seedlings exposed to 45°C without acclimation treatment collapsed and bleached (Fig. 4a), whereas all seedlings exposed to acclimation followed by a short recovery time of 2 h were resistant (Fig. 4b). However, after the long recovery time, rof2 silenced plants (21, 22) were more resistant to exposure of 45°C then wild type (Fig. 4c, d). This phenotype was very similar to the phenotype observed for ROF1 over expressors in contrast to HsfA2 and rof1 knockout plants (Fig. 4c, d). These results indicate that ROF2 is involved in thermotolerance and its effect is different from ROF1 (Meiri and Breiman CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  The discovery that ROF2 has a role in the AT and that it was shown to be antagonistic to ROF1 raised the possibility that these homologues have common client proteins through which they interact. ROF1 was previously shown to specifically recognize HSP90.1 which interacts with HsfA2 (Meiri and Breiman CITATION). Therefore the possibility that ROF2 participates in the ROF1-HSP90.1-HsfA2 complex, was tested. We asked whether ROF2 interacts with HSP90.1. In spite the high homology and even though ROF2 has all five amino acids that are important to the ROF1-HSP90.1 interaction (Aviezer-Hagai et al. CITATION), it does not interact with HSP90.1 (Fig. 5a). However, ROF2 interacts with hvHSP90 both in the yeast two hybrids (Fig. 5a) and the BiFC systems (data not shown), a result which demonstrates ROF2 ability to bind HSP90 and indicates the existence of a fine tuned mechanism for this interaction. [[FIGURE]]  In order to investigate the involvement of ROF2 in the ROF1-HSP90.1-HsfA2 complex, we have tested the interaction between ROF1 and ROF2 in the yeast 2 hybrid system, ROF2 was shown to interact with ROF1 to form heterodimers, however, neither ROF2 nor ROF1 could form homodimers (Fig. 5b). This data was confirmed by in vitro interaction assays in which purified ROF1 and ROF2 proteins formed heterodimers, but not homodimers (Fig. 5c). The interaction between the purified ROF1 and ROF2 proteins was inhibited by the addition of the immunosuppressive drug FK506 (Fig. 5c). The amount of heterodimers formed correlated negatively with the FK506 concentration. In the presence of 5 μM FK506 the amount of ROF1-ROF2 heterodimers decreased and addition of 10 μM FK506 abrogated the interaction. The effect of FK506 on ROF1-ROF2 interaction indicates that the reaction is specific and suggests that the interaction site is localized in the PPIase domain whose activity is inhibited by FK506. The interaction between ROF2 and ROF1 in planta and its subcellular localization, was tested by the BiFC system assay that uses the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) split into two non-overlapping N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) fragments. When ROF1 and ROF2 were co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaves, reconstitution of YFP was detected in both nuclei and cytoplasm whereas no homodimers of either ROF1 or ROF2 type were detected (Fig. 6a). [[FIGURE]]  Based on the data showing that after 3 h at 37°C only ROF1 was detected in the nucleus (Meiri and Breiman CITATION), we assumed that the entry of ROF2 to the nucleus occurs during the recovery period. To test this hypothesis, nuclear and cytosolic extracts were collected after heat stress and probed with specific anti-ROF2 antibodies. During the heat stress and following several hours, ROF2 was present in the cytoplasm. Its first appearance in isolated nuclei was detected 6 h after the heat stress (Fig. 6b). ROF2 was stably expressed and was observed in both cytoplasm and nuclei 24 h after heat stress (Fig. 6b). Using isolated nuclei from HsfA2 and HSP90.1 knock out plants, we demonstrated that, unlike ROF1 (Meiri and Breiman CITATION), the presence of HsfA2 and HSP90.1 is not essential for nuclear localization of ROF2 protein (Fig. 7). During the recovery period, in the absence of HsfA2 or HSP90.1, only ROF2 is detected in the nucleus, while ROF1 cannot be detected (α-73 antibodies recognize both ROF1 and ROF2). Therefore it can be concluded that during the recovery period the nuclear localization of ROF2 is not affected by HsfA2 or HSP90.1 proteins. [[FIGURE]]  The accumulation of sHSPs in the absence of ROF2 (Fig. 3) has raised the hypothesis that HsfA2 activity can be modulated by ROF2 via its interaction with ROF1. Therefore the effect of ROF1 and ROF2 on HsfA2 transcriptional activity, was analyzed by testing HsfA2 activity on known sHSPs target promoters. For that purpose 35S::HsfA2, 35S::ROF1 and 35S::ROF2 constructs were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves of transgenic plants stably harboring GUS (uidA) reporter gene under the control of HSP17.6 or HSP17.4 promoter. GUS activity was examined 48 h post injection, qualitatively by the 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (MUG) fluorimetric assay. HsfA2 was shown to upregulate the transcription of both HSP17.4 and HSP17.6. The addition of ROF1 or ROF2, independently, increased the relative activity of the HSP17.4 promoter by 60 or 40% respectively (Fig. 8). The finding that ROF2 by itself increases HsfA2 activity is not well understood. However this situation is artificial since in Arabidopis ROF2 is expressed only under heat stress conditions when ROF1 is present (Aviezer-Hagai et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  Upon expression of both ROF2 and ROF1, abrogation of HsfA2 transcriptional activity on HSP17.4 and HSP17.6 promoters was achieved. It appears that ROF2 when coexpressed with ROF1 can inhibit HsfA2 activity. We suggest that ROF2 is a sensor for sHSPs by modulating their accumulation, via a negative feedback regulation of HsfA2.
!~MM~! The coding region of the ROF1 gene from codon 1–552 was amplified by PCR (Fwd: 5′cgccccggggatggatgctaatttcgagatgcct, Bwd: 5′cgcccatggttattccttacttagtttcgcaaac). The resulting PCR product was cloned in frame into pLexA (Clontech) via XmaI and NcoI restriction sites. The coding region of the ROF2 gene from codon 1–578 was amplified by PCR (Fwd: 5′ccggaattcatggaagacgatttcgac, Bwd: 5′cgcggatcctcatgccttggtgtcaatac) and cloned in frame into pLexA (Clontech) via EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The coding region of the HSP90.1 gene from codon 1–706 was amplified by PCR (Fwd: 5′cgcctcgagactagtatggcggatgttcagatggctg, Bwd:5′cgcctcgagttagtcgacttcctccatcttgctc) and cloned in frame into pLexA (Clontech) via EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. HvHSP90 pB42AD was kindly provided by Dr. Shirasu (Takahashi et al. CITATION). The plasmid constructs were introduced into the EGY48 yeast strain (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::plexAop6-LEU2;) by lithium acetate transformation, together with the pSH18.34 vector (OriGene) carrying the URA3 selectable marker and the lacZ reporter gene fused to eight lexA operators. Yeast transformants were selected on plates containing complete minimal (CM) dropout medium without Ura and His but with Glc as a unique carbon source. Individual yeast colonies were tested for expression of β-galactosidase by using X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside) and by their ability to grow on plates containing CM dropout medium without uracil, histidine, and leucine. The Arabidopsis HsfA2, T-DNA insertion line in Col-0 ecotype containing a T-DNA insertion in the HsfA2 gene (Salk_008978) was provided by Dr. Pascal von Koskull-Doring (Schramm et al. CITATION). The Arabidopsis AtHSP90.1 T-DNA insertion lines in Col-0 ecotype were kindly provided by Dr. K Shirasu (Takahashi et al. CITATION). The rof1 knockout mutant in and the rof2 RNAi silenced mutants were generated in the WS ecotype background as previously were described (Aviezer-Hagai et al. CITATION). The ROF1 over expressor. Plants WS ecotype were generated in our lab as described (Meiri and Breiman CITATION). In all experiments we used the wild type controls of both ecoypes Columbia and WS. Since both ecotypes exhibited a similar pattern and since rof1-, rof2- and ROF1 overexpressors mutants were in the WS ecotype, the ecotype represented in all figures is WS. For leaf injection (BiFC method and HsfA2 expression) Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown on soil for 5 weeks and irrigated from below. Plants were grown in environmental growth chamber under short-day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark cycles) at 22°C. For RNA preparation, protein extraction and heat stress bioassay, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were germinated on MS-medium plates (Murashige and Skoog including vitamins, Duchefa) containing 0.2% MS (w/v), 2.5 mM MES, 1% sucrose, and 0.5% plant agar (Duchefa) for 5–14 days. After 2–3 days at 4°C in the dark for stratification, seeds were grown on plates at 22°C at long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) unless differently mentioned. For RNA preparation and protein extraction 5 day seedlings were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in an incubator and then return to recovery at 22°C in long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) to various times (see legends). For thermotolerance bioassays after recovery, the plates were incubated for 60 min in a 45°C water bath. After the treatment at 45°C, the plates were returned to recovery at 22°C in long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) for another 8 days. ROF1 and ROF2 cDNA fragments were cloned into the SpeI site of pSY728 vector containing the N-terminal fragment of YFP (YN), and pSY738 vector containing the C-terminal fragment of the YFP (YC; Bracha-Drori et al. CITATION). The resulting constructs, pSY728-AtROF1 (ROF1-YN), pSY728-AtROF2 (ROF2-YN), pSY728-AtHSP90.1 (HSP90.1-YN), pSY728-AtHsfA2 (HsfA2-YN), pSY738-AtROF1 (ROF1-YC), pSY738-AtROF2 (ROF2-YC), pSY738-AtHSP90.1 (HSP90.1-YC), pSY738-AtHsfA2 (HsfA2-YC), were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains GV3101 and then were co-transformed by injection into Arabidopsis leaves under various combinations. CaMV35S-YFP plasmid was used as a control. Western blot analysis with specific antibodies confirm the expression of the transient proteins.  Arabidopsis leaves were injected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains GV3101/mp90 harboring the appropriate plasmids. Cultures (10 mL) were grown overnight at 28°C in Luria–Bertani liquid medium with kanamycin (30 μg/mL). The next day, 500-μL cultures were transferred into an induction medium (50 mM MES, 0.5% Glc, 1.7 mM NaH2PO4, 0.2 mM acetosyringone, and 5% 20X-AB mix [20X-AB mix is 370 mM NH4Cl, 24 mM MgSO4, 40. mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM FeSO4·7H2O]) and grown for an additional 4 h until OD600 reached 0.2–0.6. Before injection, cultures were diluted with induction medium until OD600 reached 0.12. Leaves were observed for YFP fluorescence at 24–48 h after injection. Total RNA from seedlings or leaves (100 mg) before and after heat-stress treatment was isolated as describe previously (Aviezer-Hagai et al. CITATION). All RNA samples were quantified at 260 nm using a nano drop-ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Rockland, DE). First-strand cDNA was produced using 2 μg of total RNA, oligo (dT) 15 primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA). The resulting cDNA was diluted 40 times, and 5 μL were used as a template in 25-μL PCR reaction using gene specific primers. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: 94°C for 4 min followed by five cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1 min, 19 (for ribosomal 40S) or 25 cycles (for all other genes used in this paper) at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s and 72°C for 2 min. The reaction was terminated by 72°C for 5 min. The PCR reactions were performed using the PTC-200-PCR Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, USA). For semi-quantitative analysis, the intensity of the bands was determined by densitometry using Image Master ID Prime Software version 4.1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, USA). Proteins extractions were performed as previously described (Aviezer-Hagai et al. CITATION). For ROF1 and ROF2 detection, polyclonal antibodies that have been raised against the recombinant wFKBP73 (α-73; Blecher et al. CITATION; Kurek et al. CITATION) diluted 1:3,000 were used. For specific ROF2 detection, polyclonal antibodies that have been raised against the recombinant ROF2 diluted 1:1,000 were used (Aviezer- Hagai et al. 2007). The antibodies against HsfA2 were provided by Dr. von Koskull-Doring (Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany) and used at a dilution of 1:1,000. The antibodies against sHSPs-CI were provided by Dr Adam Institute of Plant Genetics, Hebrew University Rehovot and used at 1:1,000 dilution (Dafny-Yelin et al. CITATION). The antibodies anti-monomethyl-Histone H3 (α-H3) were purchased from Millipore company, catalogue Number: 07-448, and used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Secondary anti-rabbit (for α-73, α-ROF2, α-HSP90, α-H3 and α-sHSPs-CI) or anti-guinea pig (for α-HsfA2) IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (Pharmacia) were used at 1:15,000. Detection was performed using ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents and Analysis System (Amersham Biosciences, UK). Leaves of 3- to 4-week-old plants were used for nuclei isolation. Leaves were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen to fine powder with a mortar and pestle. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4°C. The nuclei were isolated according to Kohler et al. (CITATION). About 20 g of tissue powder were mixed with 100 mL of extraction buffer (250 mM Suc, 10 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min, then filtered through two layers of Miracloth and subjected to centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 mL of nuclei washing buffer (NWB; 0.4 M hexylene glycol, 10 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100), filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh, then layered on 15 mL of 30% Percoll in NWB and centrifuged again at 1,000g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of NWB and filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh. Nuclei were further purified in a discontinuous Percoll gradient made by layering 10 mL of 30% Percoll in NWB on 10 mL of floating buffer (0.44 M Suc, 80% Percoll, 10 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2). The gradient was centrifuged at 200g for 5 min. Most of the nuclei formed a layer just above floating buffer. They were removed, washed once with NWB (without addition of Triton X-100), and finally collected by centrifugation. This nuclei-enriched fraction was resuspended in protein sample buffer (0.175 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.8, 5% SDS, 15% glycerol, 30 mM dithiothreitol) subjecting to SDS–PAGE gels for western-blot analysis. The ROF1 coding sequence was amplified from 2-week-old seedlings cDNA library with specific primers: forward primer 5-CGCGGATCCATGGATGCTAATTTCGAGATGCCT and backward primer 5-CGCGGATCCTTATTCCTTACTTAGTTTCGCAAAC. These primers designed with BamHI restriction enzyme for further cloning in expression vectors. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega Corp.) and sequenced to confirm lack of mutations. The fragment was digested with BamHI and ligated into pET- 28a vector (Novagen). The His-tagged ROF1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. For protein expression, single transformed colonies were grown at 37°C to an OD600 and transferred to overnight incubation at 4°C, then diluted 1:25 and grown at 37°C to an OD600. Induction was performed with 1 Mm IPTG for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 180 mL of 0.3 M sucrose, 20 mM MOPS pH 7.0 buffer. After addition of DNAaseI and 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no. 11873580001, Roche Applied Science), the cells were ruptured using a French press. The homogenate was then subjected to centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifugated at 150,000g for 35 min and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was loaded at 1 mL/min onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Bio-Rad) that was pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Tris–HCl pH = 7.4, 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with 20 mL of buffer B and developed with a linear imidazole gradient (10–500 mM) in buffer B. The protein was further purified using a MonoQ ion-exchange column (Bio-Rad) in an FPLC system (Bio-Rad). Fractions enriched in ROF1 were pooled, and further purified using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer C (20 mM Na -HEPES (pH 7.4) and 100 mM NaCl). The purified proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Cross-linking was carried out with 1 mM DSP (Dithiobissuccinimidyl Propionate) at room temperature for 30 min in 20 mM Na -HEPES (pH 7.4) and 100 mM NaCl. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS–PAGE. The histochemical localization of GUS in transformed Arabidopsis plants was preformed as described by Jefferson et al. (CITATION). Four weeks Arabidopsis plants expressing ROF2 promoter GUS fusion were freshly collected and immersed in a histochemical reaction mixture containing 1.1 mM X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-Glucuronide; Duchefa) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide and 0.1% Triton X-100. Plant material was vacuum infiltrated for 5 min (seedlings)–15 min (mature tissues). The histochemical reaction was preformed in the dark at 37°C for 20–360 min. Stained leaves were incubated in a clearing solution (2 chloral hydrate: 1 lactic acid v/v) for up to 2 weeks and then placed in a 90% lactic acid medium on a slide and examined with a stereo microscope (Zeiss SV11) and documented by a Nikon coolpix camera. One fresh leaf disk was homogenized in 100 μL extraction buffer (50 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1%Sodium Lauryl Sarcosine, 0.1% TritonX 100). 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-b- d -glucuronide (MUG) was added and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 M Na2CO3 and fluorescence was read in a Synergy plate reader at 460 ± 40 nanometers with 340 ± 11 nanometers as excitation amplitude.
