!~ABS~! Chloroplasts arose from a free-living cyanobacterial endosymbiont and divide by binary fission. Division involves the assembly and constriction of the endosymbiont-derived, tubulin-like FtsZ ring on the stromal surface of the inner envelope membrane and the host-derived, dynamin-like ARC5 ring on the cytosolic surface of the outer envelope membrane. Despite the identification of many proteins required for plastid division, the factors coordinating the internal and external division machineries are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that this coordination is mediated in Arabidopsis thaliana by an interaction between ARC6, an FtsZ assembly factor spanning the inner envelope membrane, and PDV2, an ARC5 recruitment factor spanning the outer envelope membrane. ARC6 and PDV2 interact via their C-terminal domains in the intermembrane space, consistent with their in vivo topologies. ARC6 acts upstream of PDV2 to localize PDV2 (and hence ARC5) to the division site. We present a model whereby ARC6 relays information on stromal FtsZ ring positioning through PDV2 to the chloroplast surface to specify the site of ARC5 recruitment. Because orthologs of ARC6 occur in land plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria but PDV2 occurs only in land plants, the connection between ARC6 and PDV2 represents the evolution of a plant-specific adaptation to coordinate the assembly and activity of the endosymbiont- and host-derived plastid division components.
!~RES~! The similarity of PDV2 to PDV1 in sequence and domain arrangement (see Supplemental Figures 1A to 1C online) suggested that PDV2 localization and topology are similar to those of PDV1 (CITATION). To determine the localization of PDV2 in vivo, we expressed a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–PDV2 fusion protein from the PDV2 promoter (PDV2pro-YFP-PDV2) in ecotype Columbia (Col-0) Arabidopsis plants. Similar to PDV1, the YFP signal localized to the midplastid in young emerging leaves (Figures 1A to 1C ). The YFP-PDV2 signal appeared as a continuous ring rather than as a series of ordered spots, as was previously noted for PDV1 (CITATION). When YFP-PDV2 was coexpressed with an ARC6–cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fusion protein, their fluorescence signals colocalized within mesophyll chloroplasts (Figures 1E to 1H). To confirm the predicted topology of PDV2, we performed in vitro chloroplast import and protease protection assays (Figure 1I, left). Following incubation with isolated pea (Pisum sativum) chloroplasts, radiolabeled PDV2 produced by in vitro translation (Figure 1I, lane 1) was retained in the membrane fraction, indicating its association with chloroplasts, but was not processed to a smaller size (Figure 1I, lane 2), consistent with the lack of a predicted transit peptide (CITATION). The protein was susceptible to degradation by thermolysin, which cannot penetrate the chloroplast outer envelope, consistent with PDV2 localization in the outer envelope. However, a portion of PDV2, roughly corresponding to the size of the predicted C-terminal IMS domain (∼10 kD; see Supplemental Figure 1A online), was protected from thermolysin degradation (Figure 1I, lane 4, arrowhead) but was sensitive to trypsin, which can penetrate the outer envelope membrane and enter the IMS (CITATION; CITATION). ARC6, used as an inner envelope control in these experiments (Figure 1I, right), behaved as shown previously (CITATION); incubation with chloroplasts produced a slightly smaller protein, indicating import and transit peptide processing, and the import product was membrane-associated and partially protected from trypsin, as expected for a bitopic chloroplast inner envelope membrane protein with an IMS domain. These results confirm that PDV2, like PDV1, is a midplastid-localized, bitopic protein of the chloroplast outer envelope membrane, with its large N terminus exposed to the cytosol and its smaller C terminus residing within the intermembrane space. [[FIGURE]] The similar localization patterns of PDV1 (CITATION), PDV2, and ARC6 at the division site, along with their demonstrated topological orientations in the envelope membranes, suggested the possibility that ARC6 might interact with PDV1 and/or PDV2 in the IMS. To test this, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays with constructs encoding the C-terminal IMS domains of ARC6 and PDV1 or PDV2. PDV2IMS strongly and specifically activated the HIS3 reporter in the presence of ARC6IMS (Figure 2A , third row). No interaction was observed between PDV1IMS and ARC6IMS (Figure 2A, first row), although we cannot rule out the possibility of their direct interaction in vivo. To confirm the ARC6IMS–PDV2IMS interaction, we performed a coprecipitation assay (Figure 2B). A glutathione S-transferase (GST)–PDV2IMS fusion protein was precipitated from crude Escherichia coli extracts with Ni-Sepharose beads coated with His-ARC6IMS (Figure 2B, lane 1), but no pulldown of GST-PDV2IMS was observed using uncoated Ni-Sepharose beads (Figure 2B, lane 2). These results support an ARC6-PDV2 protein–protein interaction within the intermembrane space of dividing chloroplasts. [[FIGURE]] We compared the C-terminal IMS domains of PDV1 and PDV2 in order to gain insight into features that distinguish them from one another and to identify features that might be important for the PDV2-specific interaction with ARC6. We generated a sequence alignment between PDV1 and PDV2 proteins from several land plants using a ClustalW identity-scoring matrix (CITATION) and used this alignment to clearly define PDV1-specific and PDV2-specific features (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). As noted previously, all PDV1 proteins have a conserved C-terminal Gly residue, and mutation of this residue impairs PDV1 function in Arabidopsis (CITATION). A conserved terminal Gly is also found in all known PDV2 family members (Figure 3 , arrow). However, PDV2 proteins have a conserved 28–amino acid extension at their C terminus and thus are generally longer (294 ± 15 amino acids, n = 7 sequences) than PDV1 proteins (261 ± 14 amino acids, n = 7 sequences). This C-terminal extension, which includes the terminal Gly residue, is likely to mediate the PDV2-specific interaction with ARC6. [[FIGURE]] To ask whether the C-terminal Gly of PDV2 is important for the ARC6–PDV2 interaction, we engineered a missense mutation in the PDV2IMS two-hybrid plasmid that changes this Gly to Asp (G307D). Following cotransformation of the resulting construct [PDV2IMS(G307D)] and ARC6IMS into yeast and selection for both plasmids, we observed no growth on medium lacking His (Figure 4A , row 3), indicating that mutation of the terminal Gly in PDV2 diminishes the ARC6IMS–PDV2IMS interaction in yeast (cf. Figure 4A, row 1). We incorporated the same mutation into PDV2IMS to create GST-PDV2IMS(G307D) for use in pull-down assays and observed that the terminal G307D mutation reduced the affinity of PDV2IMS for ARC6IMS (Figure 4B, lane 3). The higher affinity of GST-PDV2IMS for His-ARC6IMS (Figure 4, lane 1) was not the result of biased prey input into the reaction, as equal amounts of total protein were applied to each coprecipitation reaction and we verified equal input levels of GST-PDV2IMS and GST-PDV2IMS(G307D) in the reactions by anti-GST immunoblotting (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). We conclude from these results that the IMS-localized domains of ARC6 and PDV2 interact with each other and that the conserved terminal Gly of PDV2 is important for this interaction. [[FIGURE]] To assess the potential importance of the terminal missense mutation in vivo, we compared the relative abilities of PDV2pro-PDV2 and PDV2pro-PDV2G307D transgenes encoding full-length proteins to complement pdv2-1, an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion allele of PDV2 in which chloroplasts are frequently constricted and larger than in the wild type (CITATION) (cf. Figures 4C and 4D). We reasoned that a PDV2 protein incapable of interaction with ARC6 would not be able to rescue the pdv2 phenotype. The wild-type transgene fully complemented pdv2 in the majority of selected lines (Figure 4E). By contrast, no modification of the pdv2 phenotype occurred in lines transformed with PDV2pro-PDV2G307D (Figure 4F), despite evidence based on immunoblotting with a PDV2-specific antibody that PDV2G307D protein levels were equivalent to or greater than PDV2 levels in the wild type (Figure 4H; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Lack of complementation was not a consequence of overexpression, because expression of PDV2 under the control of the 35S promoter in a wild-type background does not cause defects in chloroplast division or morphology (Figures 4G and 4I). We conclude that PDV2 interaction with ARC6 through the conserved C-terminal Gly is essential for the accumulation of normal chloroplast numbers in Arabidopsis leaf cells. To determine if the C-terminal IMS-localized region of ARC6 is required for plastid division in vivo, as suggested by its interaction with PDV2, we expressed a truncated ARC6-GFP fusion protein lacking the conserved portion (CITATION) of its C-terminal IMS region (ARC6ΔIMS-GFP) in the arc6 background under the control of the ARC6 promoter (Figure 5A ). A full-length ARC6-GFP transgene, shown previously to complement the severe chloroplast division defect in arc6 mutants (CITATION), was expressed as a control. Accumulation of the fusion proteins in transgenic individuals was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 5B), and chloroplast morphology was examined in fixed leaf cells. Similar to previous results (CITATION), we observed rescue of the arc6 phenotype (Figure 5C) in lines expressing full-length ARC6-GFP (Figure 5D), as indicated by the increase in number and the decrease in size of the chloroplasts (25 to 60 chloroplasts/cell; Figure 5D) relative to those in the parent arc6 plants (1 to 2 chloroplasts/cell; Figure 5C). A change in chloroplast number and size was also observed in lines expressing ARC6ΔIMS-GFP, but the extent to which the arc6 mutant was complemented (4 to 10 chloroplasts/cell; Figure 5E) was less than that observed in arc6 lines expressing the full-length ARC6-GFP control. These results show that the IMS region of ARC6 is required for full plastid division activity in vivo. Interestingly, arc6 plants expressing 35Spro-ARC6ΔIMS-GFP (Figure 5F) or ARC6pro-ARC6ΔIMS-GFP (see Supplemental Figure 4 online) exhibit GFP rings localized to sites of constriction in chloroplasts of young leaves, indicating that the C-terminal IMS region of ARC6 is not required for midplastid localization of ARC6. [[FIGURE]] The findings that ARC6ΔIMS-GFP localizes to the plastid division site and that arc6 plants expressing ARC6ΔIMS-GFP phenocopy pdv2 mutants suggested that ARC6 acts upstream of PDV2. Since the phenotypes of arc6 (one to two chloroplasts per cell) and pdv2 (four to eight chloroplasts per cell) mutants are easily distinguished by microscopic observation (Figure 6A ), we made reciprocal crosses to test for epistasis between the arc6-1 (Wassilewskija-2 background) and pdv2-1 (Col-0 background) alleles. F1 individuals were allowed to self-fertilize, and the chloroplast phenotypes in leaves of 105 F2 individuals were examined (Figure 6A). We observed all of the expected phenotypes in the F2 population, including individuals with wild-type phenotypes, intermediate phenotypes consistent with PDV2/pdv2 heterozygotes (CITATION), pdv2-like phenotypes, and arc6-like phenotypes in an ∼9:3:4 ratio (phenotypic distribution: wild type + intermediate = 63; pdv2-like = 17; arc6-like = 25 [χ2 ≅ 0.7; df = 2; P ≥ 0.9]). Genotype analysis of individuals with arc6-like phenotypes confirmed the presence of arc6 pdv2 double mutants within the F2 population (Figure 6A). The overrepresentation of arc6 mutant phenotypes in the F2 population and the arc6-like phenotype of the arc6 pdv2 double mutant are consistent with ARC6 acting upstream of PDV2. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the dependence of PDV2 function on ARC6, we introduced a T-DNA carrying 35Spro-PDV2 into the arc6 mutant to ask whether overexpression of PDV2 would abrogate the arc6 phenotype. Following selection, we assayed T1 individuals for PDV2 protein levels by immunoblotting and identified multiple lines with elevated PDV2 levels (Figure 6B, bottom right). In none of these PDV2-overexpressing lines did we observe significant modification of the arc6 phenotype (Figure 6B, top right); mesophyll cells from all PDV2 overexpressors still contained only one or two oversized chloroplasts (Figure 6B, bottom left). This result indicates that ARC6 is required for PDV2 function and that overexpression of PDV2 is unable to compensate for the loss of ARC6. The findings that ARC6 acts upstream of PDV2 and interacts with PDV2 suggested that ARC6 might play a role in PDV2 positioning at the division site. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a transgene carrying PDV2pro-YFP-PDV2 into Col-0 and into an arc6 T-DNA insertion mutant (SAIL_693_G04) and examined YFP localization in young leaves of T1 individuals. In the wild-type background, we observed equatorial rings of YFP-PDV2 in 34% of chloroplasts (Figure 6C, left; n = 200 chloroplasts from 20 independent T1 individuals). By contrast, in the arc6 background, all lines expressing YFP-PDV2 exhibited diffuse YFP localization around the periphery of the chloroplasts, and no YFP-PDV2 rings were observed (Figure 6C, right; n = 200 chloroplasts from 16 T1 individuals). In the converse experiment, we examined ARC6-GFP localization in wild-type and pdv2 backgrounds (Figure 6D). In both cases, ARC6-GFP was observed in equatorial rings, indicating that PDV2 does not influence ARC6 localization. We conclude that PDV2 is targeted to the outer envelope in an ARC6-independent manner but requires ARC6 for its localization to the division site. To extend this analysis and further elucidate the role of ARC6 in mediating dynamin recruitment through PDV1-PDV2, we examined GFP-ARC5 localization in wild-type cells and arc6 mutants (Figure 6E). In young wild-type leaf cells, GFP-ARC5 was frequently observed in a punctate pattern around the division site (Figure 6E, top row). By contrast, we observed GFP-ARC5 in patches within the arc6-1 mutant that do not appear to be associated with chloroplasts (Figure 6E, bottom row), similar to the reported GFP-ARC5 localization in the pdv1 pdv2 double mutant (CITATION). These patches are probably cytosolic (CITATION). Since GFP-ARC5 still localizes to the division site in a pdv2 mutant (CITATION), we conclude that ARC6 mediates dynamin recruitment and patterning through both PDV1 and PDV2 but that ARC6 might influence PDV1 function through an indirect mechanism.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ARC6-GFP and ARC6ΔIMS-GFP coding sequences, corresponding to amino acids 1 to 801 and 1 to 682 of ARC6, respectively, were cloned into pCAMBIA1302 (CITATION) or a derivative of pCAMBIA1302 containing the ARC6 promoter region (CITATION) using NcoI-BglII sites for insertion. PDV2pro-YFP-PDV2 was generated by removing the 35S promoter and mGFP-His sequences from pCAMBIA1302 and replacing them with a fragment carrying the PDV2 promoter region and EYFP (Clontech) fused to the PDV2 coding sequence. For ARC6-CFP, ARC6 was cloned into a derivative of pCAMBIA1302 containing the ARC6 promoter region (CITATION) and ECFP coding sequence (Clontech). Lines expressing proteins from both PDV2pro-YFP-PDV2 and ARC6pro-ARC6-CFP were generated by crossing independently transformed T1 lines (with demonstrated transgene expression) and selecting progeny with YFP and CFP expression. PDV2pro-PDV2 and PDV2pro-PDV2G307D were generated by PCR and cloned into a derivative of pCAMBIA1302 that lacks the 35S promoter and GFP coding sequence. All plant transformations were performed as described previously (CITATION) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. Selection of T1 individuals was performed on Linsmaier and Skoog medium (Caisson Laboratories) containing hygromycin (20 to 25 μg/mL). Light micrographs depicting chloroplast morphology in expanded leaf cells were taken using differential interference contrast optics on a Leica DMI3000B inverted microscope outfitted with a Leica DFC320 camera. Samples for chloroplast morphology and quantitation were prepared and analyzed using established protocols (CITATION). Fluorescence micrographs were taken using a Leica DMRA2 microscope using Q-Capture camera control software (Q-Imaging) and the filter sets indicated (Leica) as described previously (CITATION). Image analysis and RGB composites were made using ImageJ version 1.37 (National Institutes of Health). Yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) was cultured and transformed as recommended by the manufacturer using standard Synthetic Dropout medium (Clontech) as indicated. The coding sequence for ARC6 amino acids 637 to 801 was cloned into pGADT7 using NdeI-XmaI sites to create ARC6IMS. The coding sequence for PDV1 amino acids 226 to 272 was cloned into pGBKT7 using NdeI-XmaI sites to create PDV1IMS. The coding sequence for PDV2 amino acids 233 to 307 was cloned into pGBKT7 using NdeI-XmaI sites to create PDV2IMS. PDV2IMS(G307D) was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis and cloned into pGBKT7 using NdeI-XmaI sites. Recombinant His-ARC6IMS (encoding ARC6 amino acids 637 to 801 with an N-terminal 8× His tag) was generated in pHIS8-3 (Salk Institute) and expressed in BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene). Isopropylthio-β-galactoside (2 mM) was applied to the cells at OD600 ∼ 0.8 and incubated for 4 h to generate the His8-ARC6IMS fusion protein. Total protein was extracted from the induced cells by sonication in buffer A (1× Tris-buffered saline [TBS], 40 mM imidazole, and one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche; 11836170001] per 100 mL of buffer A) followed by treatment of the sonicated material with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 18,000g, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Total protein (750 μg) was applied to 50 μL of Ni-Sepharose beads equilibrated in buffer A (Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow; GE Healthcare). Beads were washed four times in buffer A to enrich for His-ARC6IMS. Negative controls (beads only) were simply washed in buffer A following equilibration. Production of crude GST-PDV2IMS (encoding PDV2 amino acids 233 to 307 with an N-terminal GST tag) and GST-PDV2IMS(G307D) (identical to PDV2IMS, except that a Gly-to-Asp change was introduced in the coding sequence for the C-terminal residue of PDV2) was performed using the methods described above, except that pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare) was used as the parent vector for cloning and expression of recombinant PDV2 proteins. The cell extracts containing the GST fusions were prepared by sonication and treatment with Triton X-100 and then centrifuged to yield a crudely purified sample. Total protein was measured by Bradford assay, and 750 μg of total protein was applied to the naked Ni-Sepharose beads or Ni-Sepharose beads coated with His-ARC6IMS. Following a 2.5-h incubation on a rocking platform, the samples were washed several times with buffer A and then eluted into 250 μL of buffer B (buffer A containing 1 M imidazole). Approximately 240 μL of eluate was recovered following a brief spin, and total eluted material was precipitated in acetone and reconstituted in 6× sample buffer prior to separation using SDS-PAGE. Approximately 12.5% of the eluted material was applied in each lane for separation on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (GE Water and Process Technologies) and blotted with anti-His (Pierce; 15165) or anti-GST (Sigma-Aldrich; G-1417) antibodies as recommended by the manufacturer and then were detected by standard chemiluminescence methods using the manufacturer's horseradish peroxidase–based detection protocol (Pierce). Proteins from whole cell extracts (equivalent to ∼2 to 3 mg ground in liquid nitrogen) were prepared as described previously (CITATION), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Anti-GFP immunoblotting was performed using Clontech JL-8 anti-GFP monoclonal antibody at 1:1000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, pH 7.4 (CITATION). Anti-PDV2 immunoblotting was performed using 1 mg/mL protein A–purified IgGs from New Zealand White rabbit sera (CRP) directed against PDV2 (1:15,000) in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, pH7.4. Recombinant PDV2 used as the immunogen for anti-PDV2 antibody production was generated by cloning the coding sequence for PDV2 amino acids 1 to 212 into pHIS8-3 (Salk Institute), expressing in BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene), and purifying the resulting fusion protein from cell extracts using Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. ClustalW2 was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment using PDV1 and PDV2 sequences from the organisms shown. Scoring was based on an identity matrix with default settings: Protein Gap Open Penalty = 10.0; Protein Gap Extension Penalty = 0.2; Protein ENDGAP = −1; Protein GAPDIST = 4. MEGA version 4.0.2 (CITATION) was used to generate the phylogenetic tree shown in Supplemental Figure 1C online. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in fewer than 50% of bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are in units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the data set (complete deletion option). There were 148 positions in the final data set. The cDNA for PDV2 was subcloned into pDEST14 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol prior to in vitro transcription translation. In vitro–produced protein was generated using the Promega TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocol using 3H-labeled Leu (Perkin-Elmer) as a marker for PDV2 and 35S-labeled Met (Perkin-Elmer) as a marker for ARC6 protein. Pea (Pisum sativum) chloroplasts were isolated as described previously (CITATION). Import assays and fractionation were performed according to previously established protocols (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION).
