!~ABS~! Analysis of transcripts of 75 genes encoding putative basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors in the Arabidopsis genome identified AtbZIP60, which was induced by tunicamycin. AtbZIP60 encodes a predicted protein of 295 aa with a putative transmembrane domain near its C terminus after a bZIP domain. A truncated form of AtbZIP60 without a transmembrane domain (AtbZIP60ΔC) fused with GFP localized to the nucleus, suggesting translocation of native protein to the nucleus by release from the membrane. AtbZIP60 was also induced by DTT and azetidine-2-carboxylate, which induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (also called the unfolded protein response). Expression of AtbZIP60ΔC clearly activated any of three BiP and two calnexin promoters in a dual luciferase assay using protoplasts of cultured cells. The induction was considered to be through cis-elements plant-specific unfolded protein response element and ER stress-response element. Interestingly, AtbZIP60ΔC also appeared to induce the expression of AtbZIP60 through an ER stress-response element-like sequence in the promoter of AtbZIP60. These characteristics of AtbZIP60 imply a signal transduction pathway of the ER stress response unique to plants.
!~RES~!  AtbZIP60 Induced by Tunicamycin Was Identified by Using Genomic Information. We assumed that bZIP transcription factors play roles in the ER stress response of plants, because bZIPs are involved in the response of yeast (Hac1) and mammals (XBP1 and ATF6). Thus, according to the prediction of 75 bZIP genes in the Arabidopsis genome (CITATION), they were screened one by one by RT-PCR using RNA prepared from Arabidopsis leaves treated with and without tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation that is generally used to induce the ER stress response. Among the transcripts detected, only transcripts of AtbZIP60 (locus tag At1g42990) were highly induced by tunicamycin, and the induction was confirmed by RNA gel blotting analysis (FIG-REF). AtbZIP60 encoded an ORF consisting of 295 aa (FIG-REF) having a bZIP DNA binding domain followed by a putative TMD (FIG-REF). The putative TMD implies conversion of AtbZIP60 to a soluble protein by proteolysis in response to ER stress in analogy to ATF6 in mammals. Indeed, a truncated AtbZIP60 containing amino acids 1–216 (AtbZIP60ΔC), which are fused to GFP, localized to the nucleus when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]]  Expression of AtbZIP60 Was Regulated by Other ER Stresses. To examine whether other agents inducing ER stress affect the expression of AtbZIP60, Arabidopsis seedlings treated with tunicamycin, DTT (a reducing agent inhibiting disulfide bond formation), or azetidine-2-carboxylate (a proline analog that perturbs protein structure) were subjected to RNA blot analysis. As shown in FIG-REF, these agents also induced AtbZIP60 as well as BiP. As shown in FIG-REF, the time course of AtbZIP60 induction in response to tunicamycin treatment was quite similar to that of BiP transcript induction in response to ER stress. [[FIGURE]]  Promoters of BiP and CNX Were Activated by Truncated AtbZIP60. The Arabidopsis genome contains three BiP genes. Two of them, BiP1 and BiP2, including promoter and intron sequences, are closely related to each other (CITATION), whereas BiP3 is different to some extent (CITATION). The promoter of BiP3 lacks P-UPRE, a cis-element responsible for the ER stress response that is found in BiP1 and BiP2. Instead, the BiP3 promoter has two copies of ERSE, which is also assumed to be a cis-element responsible for the ER stress response. Because the induction of BiP represents the ER stress response, the effect of AtbZIP60 on induction of the three BiP genes was examined by a dual luciferase assay in protoplasts of Arabidopsis. To investigate the effect on other genes upregulated by ER stress, we tested the promoters of the CNX genes (CNX1 and CNX2), which encode lectin-like ER-resident chaperones and contain ERSE in the promoters (CITATION). First, each of the three BiP promoters and two CNX promoters (≈1.2 kb), all of which are fused to the firefly luciferase gene, was introduced into protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis suspension cells. In transient assays, treatment with tunicamycin clearly enhanced luciferase activity driven by all BiP and CNX promoters, indicating they were responsible for responding to ER stress (FIG-REF). High induction of endogenous BiP was also confirmed by RNA blots (data not shown). As a control promoter, the promoter of cytosolic heat shock-inducible Hsp70 (locus tag At3g12580) (CITATION) was tested, which was unaffected by tunicamycin treatment (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] Using this assay system, either intact AtbZIP60 or the truncated form, AtbZIP60ΔC (amino acids 1–216), was coexpressed under the CaMV 35S promoter. As a control effector, we used GUS and HY5, a bZIP transcription factor involved in signal transduction of photomorphogenesis (CITATION), because HY5 showed the highest similarity with XBP1 in a database search of the Arabidopsis genome. Although GUS, HY5, and the intact AtbZIP60 did not affect induction of luciferase activity, coexpression of AtbZIP60ΔC clearly enhanced luciferase activity driven by all BiP and CNX promoters (FIG-REF). The level of induction was higher for the BiP3 promoter than for BiP1 and BiP2. The Hsp70 promoter was again not affected.  Activation of Promoters Was Through P-UPRE and ERSE. As described above, P-UPRE and ERSE have been considered responsible for the ER stress response. Thus, it was likely that activation of BiP and CNX promoters by AtbZIP60 depends on these ciselements. To examine whether this hypothesis were true, the effect of AtbZIP60ΔC on P-UPRE- and ERSE-dependent induction was analyzed. A hexamer of either P-UPRE or ERSE fused to the CaMV 35S–46 minimal promoter and the luciferase gene was subjected to a luciferase reporter assay using protoplasts in the same way as described above. As shown in FIG-REF, P-UPRE responded to tunicamycin as reported in ref. CITATION. ERSE also responded to tunicamycin, indicating that ERSE was sufficient for the ER stress response in plants as predicted. When AtbZIP60ΔC was coexpressed under the CaMV 35S promoter, luciferase activities driven by P-UPRE and ERSE were clearly enhanced, in contrast to GUS's lack of effect on coexpression (FIG-REF). These results suggested that AtbZIP60 activates the BiP and CNX promoter in an ERSE- and P-UPRE-dependent manner in response to ER stress.  AtbZIP60 Induces Its Own Transcription Through an ERSE-Like Sequence. We fused ≈1.2 kb of the promoter region of AtbZIP60 to a GUS reporter gene and introduced the promoter into Arabidopsis. GUS activity was clearly induced in the transgenic plants by tunicamycin, suggesting that the promoter responded to ER stress (FIG-REF). Because AtbZIP60 was induced during the ER stress response similarly to BiP, AtbZIP60 may induce its own transcription. Indeed, the promoter of AtbZIP60 contains a sequence, CCAAT-N9-TCAAG, similar to the general ERSE sequence CCAAT-N9-CCACG. As indicated in FIG-REF, CCAAT is conserved exactly, and TCAAG has two base mismatches with the CCACG. We predicted that this ERSE-like sequence functions in the induction of AtbZIP60. To test this prediction, a mutation was introduced into the ERSE-like sequence (FIG-REF) and subjected to transient luciferase assay. As shown in FIG-REF, an authentic AtbZIP60 promoter responded to tunicamycin; however, the mutated promoter showed little response to tunicamycin. This result indicates that the induction of AtbZIP60 depends on the ERSE-like sequence. Comparison of the induction rate between FIG-REF suggests that clear induction is easily observed in stable transformants. [[FIGURE]] Subsequently, the effect of AtbZIP60ΔC on the AtbZIP60 promoter was examined. As shown in FIG-REF, coexpression of AtbZIP60ΔC clearly activated the authentic AtbZIP60 promoter. However, this activation was almost completely abolished by mutation of the ERSE-like sequence, suggesting that AtbZIP60 activates its own transcription through the ERSE-like sequence.
!~MM~!  Genome-Wide Analysis of bZIP Transcripts. Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype) leaves treated with or without 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h. From each RNA sample, cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCR was conducted by using the RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) version 2.1 (Takara, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The size and signal intensity of PCR products using specific primers for 75 bZIP genes were examined by gel electrophoresis.  RNA Blot Analysis. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in one-half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2% (wt/vol) sucrose in a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Total RNA was extracted by using the aurintricarboxylic acid method (CITATION) from 2-week-old seedlings treated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin, 2 mM DTT, or 5 mM azetidine-2-carboxylate. Five micrograms of RNA per lane was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde, capillary-blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) in 20× standard saline citrate (1× SSC = 0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7), and fixed by UV irradiation. Hybridization probes of BiP and AtbZIP60 cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using a DNA labeling kit (BcaBEST labeling kit, Takara). The membrane was washed with 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65°C three times then exposed to x-ray film.  DNA Constructs for Protoplast Transformation. For observation of the subcellular localization of truncated AtbZIP60, a cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–216 in AtbZIP60 was PCR-amplified by using primers GTCGACATGGCGGAGGAATTTGGAAGCATAG and CCATGGTAGACTCCTGCTTCGACATCATGG. The PCR product was then fused to the N terminus of the sGFP in the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S-sGFP(S65T)-NOS3′ vector, a gift of Y. Niwa (University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan) (CITATION). For transient luciferase assays, the β-glucuronidase gene (GUS) in pBI221 (Clontech) was replaced with the firefly luciferase gene derived from pGL3-Basic (Promega), which produced the plasmid pBI221-Luc. We then amplified ≈1.2 kb of BiP, calnexin (CNX), and Hsp70 promoters by PCR with primers CTCGAGAGAGGAGGTTGAGAGAGAAGATAGAC and ACTAGTAGCCATATCGGAAACTTTTGCGTACG for BiP1, CTCGAGTGTATTGTAAAAGCCCTTAGCGTTACCGG and GGATCCAGCCATATCGGAAACTTTTGCGTACG for BiP2, CTCGAGCAAACATAGCACCGAACGACTTACTAC and CGCATGGATCCAATCATTTTTCGTTGTTGAGAACTCTTCTTCG for BiP3, CTCGAGGACGAGATGGTTGCTTTGGGTCTA and GGATCCTCTCATTCTCGGAATCTCTAAAAT for CNX1, CTCGAGCGTCGTTTCTCTATGATTCATTTG and GGATCCTCTCATTATCGCAATCTCAAGAGA for CNX2, and CTCGAGCGAACATTTTGCTGAACTGATTAG and GGATCCCGCCATTATTAGAGATCAGAATTG for Hsp70. PCR products were translationally fused to the firefly luciferase gene by replacing the CaMV 35S promoter of pBI221-Luc and were designated BiP1pro-Luc, BiP2pro-Luc, BiP3pro-Luc, CNX1proLuc, CNX2pro-Luc, and Hsp70pro-Luc, respectively. A P-UPRE hexamer fused with the CaMV 35S–46 minimal promoter (min) and firefly luciferase, designated P-UPREx6-min-Luc, was used as described in ref. CITATION. For ERSE, a TTACCAATCACTTCTTGACACGAGA hexamer was synthesized and used to replace that of P-UPREx6-min-Luc to generate ERSEx6-min-Luc. For overexpression of intact and truncated AtbZIP60, cDNA sequences encoding each polypeptide were substituted with the GUS gene of pBI221. Resulting constructs were designated 35S-AtbZIP60 and 35S-AtbZIP60ΔC. For overexpression of HY5, a cDNA fragment amplified with primers GGATCCATGCAGGAACAAGCGACTAGCTCT and GAGCTCTCAAAGGCTTGCATCAGCATTAGA was substituted with the GUS gene of pBI221. The resulting construct was designated 35S-HY5. For promoter analysis of AtbZIP60, an ≈1.2-kb region of promoter amplified by PCR with primers AAGCTTCGTAAAACAATTTAATAGATGTTAATG and GGATCCCATGGTCAAAAAAAAAAAAATATACAAAGAAGAAAAAAAAAAGC was translationally fused to the firefly luciferase gene by replacing the CaMV 35S promoter of pBI221-Luc (AtbZIP60pro-Luc). To obtain mutations in the promoter, two mutated PCR fragments were amplified by using a combination of AAGCTTCGTAAAACAATTTAATAGATGTTAATG and AGATGAGAGAAGGCTTAGTTCTGGAAGAATAGGATCACAG as well as GAACTAAGCCTTCTCTCATCTTGTGTGACGGCACATAAAA and GGATCCCATGGTCAAAAAAAAAAAAATATACAAAGAAGAAAAAAAAAAGC. Subsequent PCR was performed by using AAGCTTCGTAAAACAATTTAATAGATGTTAATG and GGATCCCATGGTCAAAAAAAAAAAAATATACAAAGAAGAAAAAAAAAAG to obtain a full-length mutated promoter, which was substituted for the CaMV 35S promoter of pBI221-Luc (AtbZIP60mpro-Luc).  Stable Transformation with a Chimeric Gene Consisting of the AtbZIP60 Promoter and the GUS Gene. The promoter region used to construct AtbZIP60pro-Luc was fused with the GUS gene by replacing the CaMV 35S promoter of pBI121 to generate AtbZIP60pro-GUS. Stable transformation of Arabidopsis was carried out according to Clough and Bent (CITATION). The GUS activity of T1 plants was measured by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide as described in ref. CITATION.  Transient Expression Analysis by Fluorescent GFP and Dual Luciferase Assays. Protoplasts were isolated from Arabidopsis suspension cells and transiently transformed by using polyethylene glycol according to Ueda et al. (CITATION). Fluorescence of GFP was observed by an LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) after incubation at 23°C for 16 h. For the dual luciferase assay, transformed protoplasts were incubated at 23°C for 16 h in the dark, and luciferase activities were measured by using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
