!~ABS~! Ubiquitin ligase plays a fundamental role in regulating multiple cellular events in eukaryotes by fine-tuning the stability and activity of specific target proteins. We have previously shown that ubiquitin ligase ATL31 regulates plant growth in response to nutrient balance between carbon and nitrogen (C/N) in Arabidopsis. Subsequent study demonstrated that ATL31 targets 14-3-3 proteins for ubiquitination and modulates the protein abundance in response to C/N-nutrient status. However, the underlying mechanism for the targeting of ATL31 to 14-3-3 proteins remains unclear. Here, we show that ATL31 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We identified Thr209, Ser247, Ser270, and Ser303 as putative 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 by motif analysis. Mutation of these Ser/Thr residues to Ala in ATL31 inhibited the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Additionally, we identified in vivo phosphorylation of Thr209 and Ser247 on ATL31 by MS analysis. A peptide competition assay showed that the application of synthetic phospho-Thr209 peptide, but not the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide, suppresses the interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3 proteins. Moreover, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing mutated ATL31, which could not bind to 14-3-3 proteins, showed accumulation of 14-3-3 proteins and growth arrest in disrupted C/N-nutrient conditions similar to wild-type plants, although overexpression of intact ATL31 resulted in repression of 14-3-3 accumulation and tolerance to the conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that the physiological role of phosphorylation at 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 is to modulate the binding ability and stability of 14-3-3 proteins to control plant C/N-nutrient response. 
!~RES~! In Arabidopsis, 14-3-3 proteins consist of 13 isoforms, and each isoform can be separated into two major evolutionary branches, the ϵ group and the non-ϵ group (CITATION). Each isoform has a different binding affinity to the client proteins (CITATION, CITATION). Previously, we have shown that 14-3-3χ belonging to the non-ϵ group is directly associated and ubiquitinated by ATL31 (CITATION). In addition to 14-3-3χ, immunoprecipitation and MS analysis revealed that several 14-3-3 isoforms are putative targets of ATL31, with the stability of each isoform being different in response to C/N-nutrient conditions (CITATION). To evaluate the specificity of the interaction between ATL31 and each 14-3-3 isoform, we carried out yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis. Among 13 isoforms, 14-3-3χ, -υ, and -λ were chosen as representative of the non-ϵ group, whereas 14-3-3ι and -ϵ were chosen as representative of the ϵ group. Because the C-terminal region of ATL31 (aa 169–368) was shown to interact with 14-3-3χ in Y2H analysis (CITATION), we constructed the C-terminal region of ATL31 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (BD-ATL31 C-term) (Fig. 1A) and the full length of 14-3-3χ, -υ, -λ, -ι, or -ϵ fused to the B42 activation domain (AD-14-3-3). The constructs were co-transformed into yeast cells and the interactions were evaluated by β-galactosidase activity in a liquid assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside. Yeast cells harboring 14-3-3χ and -λ showed high β-galactosidase activity, whereas 14-3-3υ, -ι, and -ϵ had low activity (Fig. 1B). All AD-14-3-3 proteins were expressed in yeast, and the expression levels did not correlate with β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1C). The 14-3-3λ showed higher activity than that of 14-3-3χ, although the expressed protein amount was lower (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that 14-3-3λ has a higher binding affinity to ATL31 compared with the 14-3-3χ. Thus, the 14-3-3λ was chosen for further study.  [[FIGURE]] To further confirm the requirements of the C-terminal region of ATL31 binding to 14-3-3, we generated the truncated forms of ATL31 and tested the interaction with 14-3-3λ (Fig. 1A). Truncation of the C-terminal region of ATL31 abolished the interaction with 14-3-3λ in Y2H (Fig. 1D). This result was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis following transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves. Myc-tagged 14-3-3λ (Myc-14-3-3λ) was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged ATL31C143S (ATL31C143S-FLAG), which has no ubiquitin ligase activity, but not with the C-terminal region deletion mutant (ATL31C143S ΔC-term-FLAG) (Fig. 1, A and E). These results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins bind to the C-terminal region but not to other regions of ATL31. We therefore utilized ATL31C143S for interaction analysis, avoiding the possible degradation of the 14-3-3 proteins that interact with ATL31.  Previously, we have shown that ATL31 is localized at the plasma membrane, and the localization is essential for the regulation of C/N-nutrient response (CITATION). This finding suggests that ATL31 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and regulates their stability at the plasma membrane. To test this possibility, we explored the distribution of ATL31 and 14-3-3λ complex in plant cells. First, ATL31C143S fused to GFP at the C terminus (ATL31C143S-GFP) and 14-3-3λ fused to mCherry at the N terminus (mCherry-14-3-3λ) were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells for co-localization analysis. The fluorescence of ATL31C143S-GFP was observed in the plasma membrane, as shown in a previous study (Fig. 2A) (CITATION). By contrast, the fluorescence of mCherry-14-3-3λ was observed at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2A). The fluorescence of ATL31C143S-GFP overlapped with mCherry-14-3-3λ at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A), indicating that ATL31 and 14-3-3λ were co-localized at the plasma membrane.  [[FIGURE]] Next, we performed BiFC analysis to evaluate the direct interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3λ at the plasma membrane. The N- or C-terminal parts of GFP were fused to ATL31C143S and 14-3-3λ, respectively (ATL31C143S-nGFP and 14-3-3λ-cGFP). The constructs were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells with FLS2-mCherry used as a transformation and plasma membrane marker (CITATION). As a result, reconstituted GFP fluorescence was observed at the cell surface when ATL31C143S-nGFP and 14-3-3λ-cGFP were co-expressed (Fig. 2B, top panels), whereas co-expression of ATL31C143S-nGFP with a no-fusion cGFP or 14-3-3λ-cGFP with a no-fusion nGFP yielded no GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2B, middle and bottom panels). The fluorescence of FLS2-mCherry was observed in all combinations and completely overlapped with the reconstituted GFP. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that ATL31 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins at the plasma membrane in plant cells.  14-3-3 proteins form a homo- or heterodimer with the N-terminal region and are able to simultaneously bind to two distinct sites of a single target protein or two different target proteins (CITATION). Each 14-3-3 monomer contains a conserved amphipathic groove that mediates the association of 14-3-3 proteins with phosphoserine- or threonine- containing motifs on their client proteins (CITATION, CITATION). To test whether the dimerization and the conserved amphipathic groove are involved in the interaction with ATL31, we constructed mutated forms of 14-3-3λ in which the N-terminal region (aa 1–29) was deleted (ΔN) to inhibit dimer formation (CITATION). Alternatively, a conserved Lys residue in the amphipathic groove was substituted by Glu (K56E) to abolish the ability to bind to the phosphopeptide (CITATION). In Y2H analysis, the ΔN mutation did not affect the interaction with ATL31, whereas the K56E mutation significantly inhibited it (Fig. 3A). To further examine these results in plant cells, we carried out co-IP analysis. ATL31C143S-FLAG was transiently co-expressed with the native or mutated forms of Myc-14-3-3λ in N. benthamiana leaves and then subjected to co-IP and Western blotting analysis. The 14-3-3λ ΔN was co-immunoprecipitated with ATL31, indicating that 14-3-3 proteins can interact with ATL31 as monomers (Fig. 3B). The interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3λ was only partially inhibited by the K56E mutation, which was inconsistent with the results of Y2H analysis that showed no interaction (Fig. 3, A and B). It is possible that Arabidopsis 14-3-3λ K56E could not interact with ATL31 but, rather, with the endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms of N. benthamiana which can form a heterodimer with Arabidopsis 14-3-3λ K56E protein and in turn mediate the interaction with ATL31. To evaluate this possibility, we used the 14-3-3λ protein with both N-terminal deletion and Lys substitution (14-3-3λ ΔN/K56E), a protein that showed a marked reduction in binding activity (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the conserved Lys residue in the amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 proteins is essential for the binding to ATL31.  [[FIGURE]] 14-3-3 proteins are known to be mostly associated with two types of phosphopeptides: RSX(pS/T)XP (mode I) or RSXX(pS/T)XP (mode II), in which the phospho-Ser/Thr (pS/T) residue is required for 14-3-3 binding (CITATION, CITATION). Scansite analysis of the C-terminal region of the ATL31 amino acid sequence revealed four putative 14-3-3 binding sites (Thr209, Ser247, Ser270, and Ser303) corresponding to the mode I 14-3-3 binding motif (Fig. 4A) (CITATION). Among these sites, Thr209 showed the highest score (lowest percentile). These sites, except for Ser303, were conserved in ATL6, the most closely related homologue to ATL31, but not in ATL11 (Fig. 4A). Y2H analysis revealed that ATL6 also interacts with 14-3-3λ, whereas ATL11 did not show any interaction (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Thr209, Ser247, Ser270, and Ser303 residues in the C-terminal region of ATL31 may be involved in the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.  [[FIGURE]] To examine whether these residues on ATL31 are involved in the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, we introduced a single or multiple alanine substitution of ATL31 at Thr209, Ser247, Ser270, and Ser303. In Y2H analysis, β-galactosidase activity was reduced by a single alanine substitution at one of four residues (T209A, S247A, S270A, or S303A) compared with the native form. T209A substitution showed the greatest reduction (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the β-galactosidase activity was significantly reduced by a quadruple alanine substitution (ATL31-4A) (Fig. 4C). Similar results were also demonstrated by co-IP and Western blotting analysis with N. benthamiana leaves (Fig. 4D). The amount of co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3λ was dramatically decreased by T209A single substitution and triple substitution containing T209A (T209A/S270A/S303A, T209A/S247A/S303A, and T209A/S247A/S270A). On the contrary, triple substitution, except for Thr209 (S247A/S270A/S303A), did not have an obvious effect on the interaction; nor did a single substitution, except for T209A (Fig. 4D). ATL31-4A did not show the interaction with 14-3-3λ (Fig. 4D), suggesting that these residues are involved in the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, and especially Thr209 plays the central role for 14-3-3 binding among the four residues. To evaluate these results in Arabidopsis, we prepared Arabidopsis cultured cells constitutively expressing ATL31C143S-4A-FLAG (35S-ATL31C143S-4A-FLAG) and tested the interaction with endogenous 14-3-3 proteins. Co-IP and Western blotting analysis demonstrated that ATL31C143S-4A-FLAG is not able to interact with endogenous 14-3-3 proteins, whereas intact ATL31C143S-FLAG did interact (Fig. 4E). Taken together, we conclude that Thr209, Ser247, Ser270, and Ser303 residues on ATL31 are essential for the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.  As shown in Fig. 3, the conserved amphipathic groove of 14-3-3λ is required for the interaction with ATL31, suggesting that 14-3-3 proteins bind to ATL31 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To evaluate this possibility, we first identified the in vivo phosphorylation sites of the ATL31 protein by mass spectrometry analysis. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis with immunoprecipitated ATL31C143S-FLAG from transgenic Arabidopsis cultured cells identified phosphorylation on Thr209 and Ser247 (Fig. 5, A and B), both of which are considered putative phosphorylation residues for the 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 (Fig. 4A). To further examine the phosphorylation, we generated the phospho-specific antibody (anti-Thr(P)209 antibody), raised against the Thr(P)209 peptide (for ATL31 consisting of amino acids Cys203–Ser213 with phosphorylation at Thr209; see Fig. 5E) and detected phosphorylation on the Thr209 residue in vivo. Immunoprecipitated ATL31C143S-FLAG was detected by anti-Thr(P)209 antibody, whereas ATL31 substituted with Ala at Thr209 (ATL31C143S-T209A-FLAG) was not detected (Fig. 5C). Together, these results demonstrate that 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 are phosphorylated in vivo.  [[FIGURE]] To evaluate the effect of ATL31 phosphorylation on interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, we performed an in vitro ATL31 phosphorylation assay followed by far Western blotting with recombinant His-14-3-3λ and anti-His antibody. Recently, we have identified the kinase targeted to ATL31 (KTA) using a proteomics approach (data not shown). Thus, we used KTA as the kinase for the in vitro phosphorylation assay against ATL31. The N-terminal hydrophobic region (aa 1–86) of ATL31 was deleted for sufficient expression in E. coli, and the remaining residues (aa 87–368) were fused to MBP to generate recombinant MBP-ATL31 fusion protein (MBP-ATL31 ΔTM) (CITATION). MBP-ATL31 ΔTM was incubated with GST or GST-KTA in the reaction buffer for 60 min. After the reaction, the phosphorylation of MBP-ATL31 ΔTM was assessed by a Phos-tag mobility shift assay, in which binding of phosphoproteins to the Phos-tag reagent in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel matrix slows down their mobility (CITATION). Western blotting with anti-MBP antibody demonstrated that MBP-ATL31 ΔTM incubated with GST-KTA, but not with GST, shows slow migration, indicating that ATL31 is phosphorylated by KTA in vitro (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, Western blotting analysis with anti-Thr(P)209 antibody revealed that KTA phosphorylates Thr209 at ATL31 (Fig. 5D). Far Western blotting analysis clearly demonstrated that only the phosphorylated MBP-ATL31 ΔTM can be associated with His-14-3-3λ (Fig. 5D). Together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of ATL31 is required for the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.  To determine whether phosphorylation of the 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 is critical for the interaction, we performed a competitive binding assay using the synthetic peptides Thr(P)209 and Thr209 (Fig. 5E). ATL31C143S-FLAG and Myc-14-3-3λ were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaves, and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads in the presence of Thr(P)209 or Thr209 peptide. In the presence of Thr(P)209 peptide, co-immunoprecipitated Myc-14-3-3λ was decreased to some extent, and the dissociated Myc-14-3-3λ was recovered in the supernatant fraction from the precipitation, whereas T209 peptide did not affect the interaction (Fig. 5F). These results clearly demonstrate that the interaction of ATL31 with 14-3-3 proteins is mediated by the phosphorylation of the 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31.  To examine the physiological requirements of phosphorylation at 14-3-3 binding sites for ATL31 function, the C/N-nutrient response of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing intact ATL31 (35S-ATL31) or quadruple-substituted ATL31 (35S-ATL31–4A) was analyzed (Fig. 6A). Wild-type (WT) and transgenic plants were grown on modified Murashige and Skoog medium under the indicated glucose and nitrogen conditions, and the percentage of 7-day-old seedlings with expanded green cotyledons was scored. All seedlings exhibited expanded green cotyledons under balanced C/N-nutrient conditions (0 mm glucose and 60 mm nitrogen; 0 mM Glc/60 mM N). In disrupted C/N-nutrient conditions (300 mm glucose and 0.3 mm nitrogen; 300 mM Glc/0.3 mM N), WT seedlings exhibited a strong purple pigmentation, and the percentage of cotyledon greening decreased significantly (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, 35S-ATL31 was less sensitive to the disruption of C/N-nutrient conditions and showed an increase in the percentage of cotyledon greening compared with the WT (Fig. 6B) (CITATION). However, the percentage of cotyledon greening in all three independent lines for 35S-ATL31–4A decreased to a similar level as observed in the WT under disrupted C/N-nutrient conditions (Fig. 6B), indicating the physiological importance of these 14-3-3 binding sites for ATL31 function in plant C/N-nutrient response.  [[FIGURE]] Previously, we demonstrated that ATL31 ubiquitinates and promotes the proteasomal degradation of a specific isoform, 14-3-3χ. Furthermore, we have shown that endogenous 14-3-3 proteins, as well as constitutively expressed FLAG-14-3-3χ, accumulate under disrupted C/N-nutrient conditions, an accumulation enhanced in ATL31/ATL6 double-knock-out mutants (CITATION). Thus, we concluded that ATL31 negatively regulates the accumulation of 14-3-3 proteins. To examine the requirement of ATL31 phosphorylation for the regulation of 14-3-3 protein accumulation in response to C/N-nutrient conditions, we analyzed the amount of 14-3-3 proteins in plants for WT, 35S-ATL31, and 35S-ATL31–4A by Western blotting using the anti-14-3-3 antibody. 14-3-3 proteins in the WT were more accumulated under disrupted C/N-nutrient conditions compared with balanced C/N-nutrient conditions as reported previously (CITATION), whereas the accumulation was repressed in 35S-ATL31 (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, such repression in 35S-ATL31 was released in 35S-ATL31–4A and restored to similar levels as in the WT (Fig. 7A). We also analyzed the transcriptional level of 14-3-3 genes used in the interaction analysis with ATL31 (Fig. 1B). Because we could not detect 14-3-3ι expression, we selected 14-3-3ο, which is located in the same subgroup as 14-3-3ι. Although the transcriptional level of some 14-3-3 genes was changed in these plants in different C/N-nutrient conditions (Fig. 7B), there was no correlation between mRNA levels and protein levels. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the Ser/Thr residues in the C terminus of ATL31 is essential for the mediation of C/N-nutrient response via 14-3-3 protein stability in plants.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as the wild type and the genetic background for all transgenic lines.

Amplified fragments were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector and then transferred into destination vectors using the Gateway system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). All amplified fragments and inserts were verified by DNA sequencing.  [[TABLE]] To generate ATL31-4A-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants (35S-ATL31–4A) and ATL31C143S-4A-overexpressing MM2d cells, the full-length coding sequence of ATL31 with introduced T209A/S247A/S270A/S303A and C143S/T209A/S247A/S270A/S303A substitutions was subcloned into pGWB11 destination vector (CITATION). The constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation.

Three independent T4 homozygous lines for 35S-ATL31–4A were selected for the carbon/nitrogen response assay.  Yeast strain EGY48 was used for the two-hybrid assays. The truncated and substituted forms of ATL31, ATL6, and ATL11 were subcloned into pEG202gw destination vector as bait, and the full-length coding sequences of 14-3-3χ, 14-3-3υ, 14-3-3λ, 14-3-3ι, and 14-3-3ϵ as well as the truncated and substituted forms of 14-3-3λ were subcloned into pJG4–5gw destination vector as prey (Gateway-compatible versions of pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Hironori Kaminaka, Tottori University). The pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors were used as vector control. Yeast transformation was performed by the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

All constructs were introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the above constructs was grown in 2× YT medium overnight at 28 °C with shaking. Cultured agrobacterium cells were collected and resuspended with infiltration buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 450 μm acetosyringone, pH 5.6). To enhance transgene expression, agrobacterium expressing the p19 suppressor was resuspended together with all samples (CITATION). Agrobacterium suspensions were mixed at equal ratios, and the mixture was infiltrated into the leaves of 3–5-week-old N. benthamiana plants using a needleless syringe.  N. benthamiana leaves and MM2d cells were ground in liquid nitrogen and lysed with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 μm MG132 and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation two times at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations were determined and normalized by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the extracts and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C with a rotary shaker. The beads were washed three times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heated for 30 min at 55 °C. Portions of the extracts prior to immunoprecipitation were also boiled with SDS sample buffer. The proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-Myc tag antibody (MBL), and anti-14-3-3 antibody (CITATION).  Infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves were used for microscopic analysis at 2 days after infiltration. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat (×40/1.2 numerical aperture water immersion) objective. Excitation/detection wavelengths were 488/505–550 nm for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and BiFC constructs and 561/575–615 nm for mCherry constructs. Image processing was carried out using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).  ATL31C143S-FLAG-overexpressing MM2d cells were ground in liquid nitrogen and lysed with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 μm MG132, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science). After the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation two times at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations were determined and normalized by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the extracts and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C with a rotary shaker. The beads were washed three times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 150 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in extraction buffer. After precipitation by cold acetone, the proteins were resuspended with SDS sample buffer and heated to 55 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry analysis. For mass spectrometry analysis, a specific band containing ATL31 was excised after staining with Flamingo stain solution (Bio-Rad). Peptides for LC-MS/MS analysis were then prepared by in-gel digestion using sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) (CITATION), and LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a LTQ-orbitrap XL-HTC-PAL system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MS/MS spectra were compared against TAIR10 (Arabidopsis Information Resource), and MS scores were calculated using the MASCOT server as described previously (CITATION).  Anti-ATL31 phospho-Thr209 antibody was generated by SCRUM Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) using a phosphorylated Thr209 peptide (CFPRSHpTTGHS). ATL31C143S-FLAG and ATL31C143S-T209A-FLAG were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) as described above. The proteins were detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-ATL31 phospho-Thr209 antibody.  For glutathione S-transferase (GST)-KTA purification, the coding sequence of kinase targeted to ATL31 (KTA) was subcloned into pYU1274 destination vector (Gateway-compatible version of pGEX4T-1 kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihisa Ueno, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences). For His-14-3-3λ purification, the full-length coding sequence of 14-3-3λ was subcloned into pDEST-his destination vector (CITATION). These constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into LB medium and grown at 37 °C with shaking. When the A600 reached ∼0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the incubation was continued for 16 h at 18 °C. The cells were collected and resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). After three freeze-thaw cycles, the lysates were incubated with Benzonase nuclease (Novagen) for 10 min at 25 °C with shaking and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. GST-KTA and His-14-3-3λ were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations were determined by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-ATL31 ΔTM was as described previously (CITATION).  MBP-ATL31 ΔTM (1.5 μg) was incubated with GST (1.5 μg) or GST-KTA (1.5 μg) in 30 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP) for 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Wako) and anti-MBP antiserum (New England Biolabs). To determine the phosphorylation of MBP-ATL31 ΔTM, the samples were subjected to Mn2+-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel, including 50 μm MnCl2 and 50 μm Phos-tag acrylamide (Wako)) and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MBP antiserum (New England Biolabs).  For far Western blotting, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk, pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature and then reacted with 0.1 μm His-14-3-3λ in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Bound His-14-3-3λ was subsequently detected using anti-His antibody (GE Healthcare).  Thr209 peptide (CFPRSHTTGHS) and phosphorylated Thr209 peptide (CFPRSHpTTGHS) corresponding to the sequence surrounding Thr209 on ATL31 were synthesized by SCRUM Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was added to N. benthamiana leaf extracts containing ATL31C143S-FLAG and Myc-14-3-3λ and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C with a rotary shaker. The beads were washed three times with extraction buffer and incubated with 1 mm Thr209 peptide or 1 mm phospho-Thr209 peptide in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and the beads were washed three times with extraction buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and heated to 55 °C for 30 min. Portions of the extracts prior to immunoprecipitation and collected supernatants were also boiled with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody (MBL).  Total RNA was isolated from indicated plant materials using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer and ReverTraAce reverse transcriptase (TOYOBO). First strand cDNA was then assayed for gene-specific DNA fragments using the primer pairs listed in Table 1. PCR amplification was performed using optimum cycles with each gene using the Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa). Amplified fragments were separated on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.  Approximately 50 seeds of each genotype that were surface-sterilized and sown on Murashige and Skoog solid medium with no glucose, 20 mm KNO3, and 20 mm NH4NO3 (0 mm Glc, 60 mm nitrogen) or 300 mm glucose, 0.1 mm KNO3, 0.1 mm NH4NO3, and 19.9 mm KCl (300 mm Glc, 0.3 mm nitrogen). After cold treatment for 2 days to synchronize germination, seeds were transferred to 22 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod (this time point indicates 0 days old). The percentage of cotyledon greening was calculated at 7 days old from three independent experiments. To analyze the amount of 14-3-3 proteins, 7-day-old seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and lysed with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 μm MG132 and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation two times at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations were determined and normalized by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. After heating with SDS sample buffer for 30 min at 55 °C, the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-14-3-3 antibody and anti-α-tubulin mouse mAb (Calbiochem).
