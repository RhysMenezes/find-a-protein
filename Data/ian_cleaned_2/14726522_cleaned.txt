!~ABS~! Plants produce the common isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) through the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol. To assess which pathways contribute DMAPP for cytokinin biosynthesis, metabolites from each isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with 13C in Arabidopsis seedlings. Efficient 13C labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway genetically or chemically during the feed of a 13C labeled precursor specific to the MEP or MVA pathways. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the prenyl group of trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine is mainly produced through the MEP pathway. In comparison, a large fraction of the prenyl group of cis-zeatin (cZ) derivatives was provided by the MVA pathway. When expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells, four adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferases (AtIPT1, AtIPT3, AtIPT5, and AtIPT8) were found in plastids, in agreement with the idea that the MEP pathway primarily provides DMAPP to tZ and isopentenyladenine. On the other hand, AtIPT2, a tRNA isopentenyltransferase, was detected in the cytosol. Because the prenylated adenine moiety of tRNA is usually of the cZ type, the formation of cZ in Arabidopsis seedlings might involve the transfer of DMAPP from the MVA pathway to tRNA. Distinct origins of large proportions of DMAPP for tZ and cZ biosynthesis suggest that plants are able to separately modulate the level of these cytokinin species. 
!~RES~! CK Levels in Arabidopsis Seedlings—To study the metabolic origins of the prenyl group of CKs, we planned to conduct the 13C labeling experiment that was employed previously to determine the contribution of the MEP and MVA pathways to gibberellin biosynthesis (CITATION). To examine whether this method was feasible for CKs, we first analyzed endogenous CK levels by LC-MS in Arabidopsis seedlings under the same growth conditions, after a feeding of non-labeled DX and MVL. When DX was fed to the cla1-1 mutant to rescue its albino phenotype, all CKs analyzed were detectable by LC-MS. As shown in Table I, the trend in the amount of individual CKs is as follows: nucleotide CKs > nucleoside CK > free-base CKs (e.g. trans-zeatin riboside monophosphate (tZRMP) > tZR > tZ). It was also noted that cZ-type CKs accumulated at much lower levels relative to tZ- and iP-type CKs. Similar accumulation patterns of different CK species were observed when the growth inhibition by mevastatin was rescued by MVL (Table I). These data allowed us to confirm that for all CKs examined, an accurate quantification of the molecular ion and its +1 isotopomer ion by LC-MS would be possible in this system with the exception of cZ, which was detectable, but its +1 isotopomer ion was below the range of reliable quantification.  [[TABLE]]  Incorporation of [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL into CKs—To evaluate the role of the MEP pathway in providing DMAPP to CKs, [1-13C]DX was fed to seedlings of the cla1-1 mutant. Likewise, to label metabolites from the MVA pathway [2-13C]MVL was fed to wild type seedlings in the presence of mevastatin. In both systems, one 13C atom would be incorporated into CKs if they were produced through the MEP or MVA pathways (Fig. 1). Table II shows the levels of 13C incorporation into CKs determined by LC-MS. The incorporation of [1-13C]DX was evident for all CKs listed in the table. For example, tZR has a molecular ion at m/z = 352, whereas the corresponding ion for tZR from the [1-13C]DX-treated cla1-1 seedlings was observed at m/z = 353. A fragment ion of tZR was detected from the [1-13C]DX-treated cla1-1 seedlings at m/z = 221, which is 1 mass unit larger than that of authentic tZR (m/z = 220). The presence of a 13C atom in cis-zeatin riboside monophosphate (cZRMP) and cZR was clear in the mevastatin-treated plants fed with [2-13C]MVL (Table II). Incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into cZ was also indicated by an ion at m/z = 221 ([M+H+1]+), which appeared more abundant than [M+H]+ of authentic cZ at m/z = 220 (data not shown), but their relative intensities could not be quantified because of low levels of cZ in the samples (Table I).  [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]]  Fig. 2 shows relative levels of 13C incorporation from [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL into CKs, ABA, and CAM determined from the data sets given in Table II after the subtraction of natural 13C abundance (CITATION). It has been reported previously (CITATION) that the MEP pathway mainly supplies precursors to the biosynthesis of ABA, which is produced through carotenoids in plastids. By contrast, CAM is a cytosolic phytosterol that is primarily synthesized via the MVA pathway. Our data show that CKs can be classified into two groups based on the 13C labeling ratio from [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL. tZ- and iP-type CKs was labeled at a high rate by [1-13C]DX but only at a low rate by [2-13C]MVL (Fig. 2). In marked contrast, about 75% of the prenyl moiety of cZ-type CKs (cZRMP and cZR) were labeled with [2-13C]MVL, whereas the incorporation of [1-13C]DX into cZ derivatives was significantly lower than the incorporation into tZ and iP derivatives.  [[FIGURE]]  As discussed previously (CITATION), the levels of 13C incorporation determined across separate feeding systems must be carefully interpreted, because the ratio of 13C labels in products can be altered by the concentration of 13C precursors in the media. Thus, the values in Fig. 2 do not immediately reflect the relative contribution of each isoprenoid pathway under normal growth conditions. Nevertheless, we conclude from the LC-MS data that tZ- and iP-type CKs in Arabidopsis seedlings are predominantly synthesized via the MEP pathway because of the following observations. First, the incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into tZ and iP derivatives was consistently low (<20%), whereas nearly 90% of the isoprene units of CAM were labeled with 13C in the same sample (Fig. 2 and Table II). This observation indicates that the MVA pathway is not the primary route used to provide DMAPP to tZ- and iP-type CKs. Second, the level of 13C incorporation into tZ and iP derivatives from [1-13C]DX was as high as that into ABA, which is known to be biosynthesized mainly through the MEP pathway (CITATION). On the other hand, we predict that the MVA pathway provides a greater proportion of DMAPP to the biosynthesis of cZ-type CKs in comparison to that of tZ- and iP-type CKs, because [2-13C]MVL was introduced into these CKs nearly as efficiently as it was into CAM in the same feeding experiment. This idea is also supported by the significantly lower levels of 13C incorporation into cZ-type CKs from [1-13C]DX than that into ABA.  Subcellular Localization of AtIPTs—Because the prenyl group of tZ- and iP-type CKs is predominantly synthesized through the MEP pathway (Fig. 2), we speculated that some IPTs should use the DMAPP produced in plastids. Compared with the bacterial enzyme tmr, all AtIPTs except for AtIPT4 have an amino-terminal extension consisting of 30–60 amino acids (CITATION). The ChloroP 1.1 program (CITATION) predicted that the amino-terminal regions of AtIPT1, -3, -5, and -8 might function to localize these AtIPTs to plastids. To obtain experimental evidence for the subcellular locations of IPT activities, we prepared DNA constructs designed to produce translational fusions of individual AtIPTs and GFP. Because some of the fusion proteins containing the full coding regions of AtIPTs tended to precipitate in cells (data not shown), the amino-terminal regions, which could function as transit peptides, were fused to GFP (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The plasmid DNAs were introduced into both Arabidopsis leaf and root cells, and the transient expression of the chimeric genes was observed. The fluorescence of AtIPT1-, AtIPT3-, and AtIPT5-GFP in mesophyll cells was observed in plastids as the signal overlapped with autofluorescence derived from chlorophylls (Fig. 3, A, B, D, and G). AtIPT8-GFP exhibited the same fluorescence pattern as AtIPT1 and -3 in root cells (Fig. 3, C, E, and H). However, the fluorescence of AtIPT4- and AtIPT2-GFP was distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 3, I, M, and N). It should be noted that an identical pattern of GFP fluorescence was observed when the GFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of AtIPT4 (data not shown). The fluorescence of AtIPT7-GFP was observed in the mitochondria (Fig. 3, J and K). To avoid mislocation of the fusion proteins because of transient expression by a strong promoter, we next generated stable transformants of Arabidopsis expressing AtIPT3- and AtIPT7-GFP controlled by their native promoters. Consequently, the pattern of fluorescence produced by both of these constructs was essentially the same as the respective transiently expressed fusion proteins (Fig. 3, compare E with F and K with L). These results strongly suggest that four adenosine phosphate-IPTs, AtIPT1, -3, -5, and -8, localize in plastids in agreement with the idea that the MEP pathway primarily provides DMAPP for tZ and iP synthesis. As for tRNA-IPT, AtIPT2-GFP localized in the cytosol (Fig. 3, M and N).  [[FIGURE]]  We did not examine the location of AtIPT6 and -9, because AtIPT6 does not appear to encode a functional IPT in some Arabidopsis ecotypes owing to a point mutation (CITATION) and because the enzyme activity of AtIPT9 could not be detected (data not shown). 
!~MM~! Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Chemicals—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija-2 was used for 13C labeling experiments. Feeding of [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL was carried out in the presence of 1% sucrose as described previously (CITATION), except that uniconazole treatment was omitted. A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used for observation of GFP fluorescence. DX and [1-13C]DX (99% labeled) were synthesized as reported before using iodomethane and [13C]-iodomethane (99% labeled, Aldrich), respectively (CITATION). MVL (dl-mevalonolactone) and [2-13C]MVL (99% labeled) were purchased from Aldrich, and mevastatin was purchased from Calbiochem.  Particle Bombardment—Full-length or part of the coding regions of AtIPTs (AtIPT1, Met1–Leu71; AtIPT2, Met1–Asn466; AtIPT3, Met1–Ser55; AtIPT4, Met1–Asn318; AtIPT5, Met1–Ser47; AtIPT7, Met1–Phe29; AtIPT8, Met1–Val330) were fused to the amino terminus of the GFP gene, which was controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (35S-sGFP (S65T)) (CITATION). The DNA constructs were introduced into the roots or rosette leaves of 2- or 3-week-old seedlings by particle bombardment (PDU-1000/He, Bio-Rad). Transient expression was observed by laser confocal-scanning fluorescence microscopy after overnight incubation (Fluoview IX5, Olympus).  Stable Transformants of Arabidopsis—Genomic DNA fragments of AtIPT3 and AtIPT7 containing the 5′-flanking regions (3.9 kb for AtIPT3, 4.1 kb for AtIPT7) and the full coding regions were ligated into pTH2 vectors (CITATION) to produce chimeric genes fused to the amino terminus of the GFP gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into Arabidopsis by the floral dip method (CITATION). More than five independent lines were obtained, and T3 plants were used for analysis.  Plant Hormone Analysis—Extraction and fractionation of CKs from Arabidopsis seedlings (3–4 g) were performed as described previously (CITATION). The nucleotide CK fractions were further analyzed as the corresponding nucleosides after treatment with phosphatase (CITATION). Each CK fraction was purified by immunoaffinity columns (CITATION) except for the addition of anti-cis-zeatin riboside (cZR) antibodies to the original protocol. After desalting, the resulting samples were dissolved in H2O and analyzed with a liquid chromatography (LC)-MS system (model 2695/ZQ2000MS, Waters). CKs were separated at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, with the gradients of solvents A (H2O), B (methanol), and C (0.1% acetic acid) set according to the following profile: 0 min, 95% A + 5% C; 1 min, 95% A + 5% C; 16 min, 45% A + 50% B + 5% C; 22 min, 25% A + 70% B + 5% C. Capillary voltage was 4.0 kV. Other conditions were described previously (CITATION). The quantification of [M+H]+ and +1 signals were achieved at levels between 0.1 and 100 pmol/injection using a standard curve. Abscisic acid (ABA) was purified from the methanoleluted fraction from the MCX column (Waters) in CK purification by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by GC-MS as reported previously (CITATION). The 13C incorporation level was calculated using the fragment ion cluster between m/z 190 and 192 after subtraction of natural 13C abundance (CITATION). Campesterol (CAM) was eluted from the MCX column with CH2Cl2 (3 ml x 3), after purification of CKs. CAM was further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by GC-MS as reported previously (CITATION).
