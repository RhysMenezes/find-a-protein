!~ABS~! Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control cell cycle progression through timely coordinated phosphorylation events. Two kinesin-like proteins that interact with CDKA;1 were identified and designated KCA1 and KCA2. They are 81% identical and have a similar three-partite domain organization. The N-terminal domain contains an ATP and microtubule-binding site typical for kinesin motors. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of the N-terminal domain of KCA1 decorated microtubules in Bright Yellow-2 cells, demonstrating microtubule-binding activity. During cytokinesis the full-length GFP-fusion protein accumulated at the midline of young and mature expanding phragmoplasts. Two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that coiled-coil structures of the central stalk were responsible for homo- and heterodimerization of KCA1 and KCA2. By western-blot analysis, high molecular mass KCA molecules were detected in extracts from Bright Yellow-2 cells overproducing the full-length GFP fusion. Treatment of these cultures with the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate caused an accumulation of these KCA molecules. In addition to dimerization, interactions within the C-terminally located tail domain were revealed, indicating that the tail could fold onto itself. The tail domains of KCA1 and KCA2 contained two adjacent putative CDKA;1 phosphorylation sites, one of which is conserved in KCA homologs from other plant species. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved phosphorylation sites in KCA1 resulted in a reduced binding with CDKA;1 and abolished intramolecular tail interactions. The data show that phosphorylation of the CDKA;1 site provokes a conformational change in the structure of KCA with implications in folding and dimerization.
!~RES~! We screened a cDNA λ phage library with a partial kinesin fragment TH65 that had been isolated previously in a two-hybrid screen with CDKA;1 (CITATION). Partial cDNAs were isolated that were elongated to a putative full-length cDNA of 3,816 bp by RACE-PCR and designated KCA1 (Arabidopsis gene At5g10470). Recently, the same TH65 fragment has been isolated in two other two-hybrid screens with the geminivirus AL1 protein and the Arabidopsis katanin p60 subunit as baits (CITATION; CITATION). A second, homologous cDNA was isolated from the library, corresponding to a gene designated KCA2, also on chromosome 5 (gene At5g65460). The comparison of the cDNA sequences with genomic DNA revealed a conservation of their gene structures, consisting of 23 exons that encoded putative proteins with 81% identity and 89% similarity. The deduced protein sequences carried an N-terminally located motor domain with the signature sequence SKLSLVDLAGSE and an ATP-binding motif or P-loop, which are the most common features of kinesin motor domains. The motor domain was preceded by a short stretch of approximately 140 amino acids that contained a coiled coil and a neck sequence carrying a conserved GN motif that is confined to minus-end-directed kinesins (Fig. 1B ). The KCA proteins consisted of two additional domains, a coiled-coil region at the center, designated stalk domain, and a C-terminal tail domain containing a single coiled coil, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and two Gly-rich regions of low complexity commonly present in kinesins (Fig. 1, A and B). The structural organization of the KCA kinesins was more closely related to the tripartite structure of plus-end-directed kinesins that have an N-terminally located motor domain. Because of sequence similarity with the group of C-terminal kinesins, KCA were tentatively classified within that group (CITATION). Database sequence comparison of the tail domain to other kinesins and proteins indicated that although KCA1 and KCA2 were conserved in higher plant species, they did not share significant homology with any other currently described protein domain. A recent phylogenetic analysis of kinesin motor domains separates KCA1 and KCA2 in a distinct subclass with the minus-end kinesin KCBP from Arabidopsis as the closest relative (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Because KCA1 is potentially phosphorylated by CDKA;1, the presence of consensus CDK phosphorylation sites (S/T-P-X-K/R) was searched for. The tail contained putative A-type CDK phosphorylation sites at positions 698, 849, and 853 in KCA1 and at positions 827 and 831 in KCA2 (Fig. 1B). A single SPGR site in the N-terminal part of the tail domain was fully conserved in KCA-like sequences of other species (Fig. 1C). The presence of KCA mRNA transcripts was analyzed in different plant organs and developmental stages by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with gene-specific primers. DNA fragments of the expected size corresponding to KCA1 or KCA2 transcripts were visualized after hybridization (Fig. 2A ). KCA1 and KCA2 mRNA were detected in young seedlings and in log-phase cell suspension cultures. KCA1 transcripts were more abundant and required a shorter film exposure to be visualized. Expression of KCA1 and KCA2 transcripts was found in all the organs tested (roots, leaves, stems, and flowers) and was more elevated in roots and flowers. Steady-state expression levels were observed for the ACT2 gene, which served as a loading control. [[FIGURE]] To determine the transcriptional activity of KCA1 and KCA2 during the course of the cell cycle, an Arabidopsis cell suspension culture was synchronized at G1/S by applying aphidicolin (CITATION). Samples were prepared from 1-h intervals after drug release and RNA subjected to RT-PCR analysis. The transcriptional levels of KCA1 and KCA2 were constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the ubiquitous expression pattern revealed by immunoblot and immunolocalization by CITATION. The CDKA;1-binding sites of KCA1 and KCA2 were determined by two-hybrid analysis whereby positive interactions were defined by the ability to grow on medium without His. The different KCA1 and KCA2 fragments used for the analysis are presented in Figure 3A . The CDKA;1-binding sites were mapped to the head domain (KCA11-497 and KCA236-507), the centrally located stalk region (KCA1395-926, KCA1473-866, KCA2425-617, and KCA2425-864), and the N-terminal part of the tail domain (KCA1660-862 and KCA2655-864). In addition, the full-length KCA1 protein showed CDKA;1-binding affinity (Fig. 3A). The interaction strength of the individual peptide fragments and full length was estimated by including the HIS3 competitive inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) in the growth medium. The strongest interactions were observed with KCA fragments that included the conserved CDK phosphorylation site SPGR, with the exception of the complete tail domain (KCA1660-1,273) that did not interact with CDKA;1. These data indicate that the three separate KCA domains contribute to the interaction with CDKA;1 and that the C-terminal part of the tail has an inhibitory effect on the binding with CDKA;1. [[FIGURE]] The KCA-CDKA;1 interaction was also analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a coupled transcription-translation system in which the KCA1 and KCA2 fragments were tagged with c-Myc and CDKA;1 with hemagglutinin epitope (HA; Fig. 3B). In the control experiment, the c-Myc-tagged peptides precipitated with a c-Myc monoclonal antibody, confirming the correct synthesis of the KCA peptide fragments. Next, the c-Myc- and HA-tagged translation products were mixed and pulled down with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. The KCA1 peptide fragments containing either the N-terminal tail (KCA1660-862) or the head (KCA11-497) cosedimented with HA-CDKA;1, whereas the fragment containing the C-terminal tail domain (KCA1875-1,273) did not (Fig. 3B, left panel). Similar results were obtained with peptide fragments of KCA2. The stalk (KCA2425-617) and the N-terminal part of the tail (KCA2655-864) were pulled down together with HA-CDKA;1, whereas the C-terminal tail (KCA2855-1,267) was not (Fig. 3B, right panel). The results confirmed the KCA and CDKA;1 interactions that had been revealed by the two-hybrid analysis. None of the KCA fragments was able to bind with the anti-HA antibody in the absence of HA-CDKA;1 (data not shown). To investigate the association of KCA1 with CDKA;1 in vivo, CDK-protein complexes were purified from Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) transgenic cell cultures that produced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of the full-length and fragments containing the motor (KCA11-497) or the tail domain (KCA1660-1,273; Fig. 3C). Extracts of the transgenic cultures and control wild-type BY-2 cells were mixed with p10CKS1AtCDKA;1 affinity beads. Crude extract, pellet, and supernatant were analyzed by western blot and developed with polyclonal GFP antibody. As shown in Figure 3C, GFP-fusion products corresponding to the predicted molecular mass were detected in the separated crude BY-2 extracts. Compared to the noninduced protein extract (−), three kinesin-related protein products were present in the preparations from dexamethasone-induced cells producing the full-length kinesin GFP-fusion protein. The 160-kD band corresponded to the intact GFP-KCA1 protein, whereas the smallest 40-kD protein resulted from degradation or prematurely arrested translation. The high molecular mass band at approximately 250 kD may represent a GFP-KCA1 dimer. The presence of kinesin dimers in denaturing polyacrylamide gels has been reported before (CITATION). Pull-down assays with p10CKS1At beads indicated a strong interaction of CDKA;1 with KCA1, confirming the interaction between the full-length construct and CDKA;1 in two-hybrid experiments (Fig. 3, A and C). The head also interacted with CDKA;1, whereas the tail GFP fusion did not cosediment and remained in the soluble fraction. In light of the two-hybrid interaction data and the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, KCA1 seems to be arranged into multiple folding configurations with differential CDKA;1-binding capacities. Together, three CDKA;1-binding sites were revealed by these experiments, one in the motor domain, one in the stalk, and one in the N-terminal half of the tail. An important property of kinesin molecules is their ability to attach to MTs either for transport or control of MT organization (CITATION). To investigate the in vivo protein localization, we fused KCA1 and KCA1 subdomains to the C-terminal end of GFP and transformed tobacco BY-2 suspension cells. The GFP-KCA1 fusion product (KCA11-1,273) resided in the cytoplasmic space excluded from the vacuoles and the nucleus (Fig. 4A ). Scanning of the cell periphery and center by confocal optical sectioning did not reveal specific labeling of the cortical or endosomal array, indicating that the full-length GFP-fusion protein did not bind the interphase microtubular structures. By contrast, the N-terminal half of KCA1 containing the motor domain (KCA11-497) associated with MTs (Fig. 4B). Cortical and endocytoplasmic MTs were brightly fluorescent in freshly transformed calli. These observations demonstrated that the motor domain as a separate entity exhibited MT-binding activity. Some kinesins, such as the calmodulin-binding kinesin KCBP, carry a nucleotide-independent MT-binding site outside of their motor domain to facilitate MT sliding (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we analyzed the KCA1 tail domain (KCA1660-1,273) and expressed it as a GFP-fusion protein in BY-2 cells. Fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus without association with microtubular structures (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, both the motor and the tail GFP-fusion proteins were present in the nucleus, although the motor accumulated at much higher concentrations than the tail (Fig. 4C). Putative nuclear localization signals were identified in the tail domain but not in the motor (Fig. 1). CDKA;1 also concentrates in the nucleus without a classic NLS-targeting signal and associates tightly with interphase chromatin (CITATION). In addition, it binds MTs similarly to what we observed with the GFP-fused KCA1 motor domain (CITATION). Because CDKA;1 interaction with chromatin is resistant to mild nonionic detergent extraction, we performed a similar extraction procedure on BY-2 cells that produced the GFP-motor or the GFP-tail domains. Figure 4, D to I, shows that GFP-CDKA;1 and GFP-motor were retained in the nucleus, whereas free GFP (data not shown) or the GFP-tail was readily and completely removed upon the detergent washes. Therefore, the motor protein must be tightly bound to the nuclear matrix, presumably as part of a protein complex that possibly also contains the CDKA;1 protein. [[FIGURE]] The full-length GFP-KCA1 fusion protein was followed during cell division (Fig. 4J). Throughout mitosis, the fusion protein remained in the cortical cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic strands, and it invaded the unrestricted space of the spindle in metaphase and anaphase cells (Fig. 4J). Fluorescence was diffuse and did not reveal fibrous structures, indicating that the fusion protein did not attach to MTs (Fig. 4J). Once the daughter chromosomes were separated, GFP-KCA1 fluorescence accumulated at the midline of the emerging phragmoplast where Golgi-derived vesicles accumulate to form the cell plate (Fig. 4J). In a second stage of cell plate development, concomitant with expansion of the phragmoplast, fluorescence was most bright at the leading edges (Fig. 4J). Reduced fluorescence was observed at the center of the centrifugally expanding phragmoplast, where the cell plate starts to mature and MTs are depolymerized. In contrast to the findings of Kong and Hanley-Bowdoin, GFP-KCA1 did not concentrate in the nucleus, nor did it associate with condensed chromosomes in metaphase cells. As the N-terminal domain in front of the motor domain may be implicated in nuclear targeting or chromosome binding, we analyzed the subcellular localization of a C-terminal fusion of KCA1 in BY-2 cells. KCA1-GFP was excluded from the nucleus and vacuoles (Fig. 4K). In the cytoplasm, it was associated with a reticulated network resembling the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; Fig. 4K). During division (Fig. 4L), KCA1-GFP was distributed to the polar sides of the spindle and the midline of the phragmoplast reminiscent to the subcellular localization of an ER-targeted marker in BY-2 cells (CITATION). Several observations suggested that the KCA kinesins adopt different folding configurations with distinct properties in terms of interaction with CDKA;1 and in relation to their subcellular localization. Firstly, the N-terminal part of the tail domain could bind CDKA;1 only when the C-terminal part was not included. The inhibitory activity of the C-terminal part of the tail was not evident when the full-length proteins were tested, indicating that these had taken on an alternative configuration immune to control by the tail domain. Secondly, the full-length KCA1 GFP-fusion product was excluded from the nucleus while the head and tail as separate GFP fusion fragments entered the nucleus. Thirdly, MTs were not labeled with GFP fused to full-length proteins but with the GFP-head fusion product. Therefore, we examined the intra- and intermolecular interactions of KCA1 and KCA2 peptides by two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays. Full-length KCA and peptide fragments containing the complete or part of the central coiled-coil region resulted in yeast growth (combinations pGBT-KCA1395-926 with pGAD-KCA1473-866 and pGBT-KCA2425-617 with pGAD-KCA2425-864), indicating that both KCA1 and KCA2 could form homodimers (Fig. 5A ). Evidence for heterodimerization through the central coiled-coil region followed from yeast growth when the stalk domains of both kinesins were tested against each other (combinations of both pGBT-KCA2425-617 and pGBT-KCA2425-864 with pGAD-KCA1473-866). [[FIGURE]] Two-hybrid interactions were also observed between the N-terminal and the C-terminal halves of the tail of KCA1 (combination pGBT-KCA1660-862 with pGAD-KCA1875-1,273) and KCA2 (combination pGBT-KCA2425-864 with pGAD-KCA2855-1,267), pointing out that the tail domains had a tendency to fold onto themselves. A similar type of interaction also occurred between the N- and C-terminal tail domains of KCA1 and KCA2 (combinations pGBT-KCA1660-862 with pGAD-KCA2855-1,267 and pGBT-KCA1875-1,273 with pGAD-KCA2425-864). The folding of the KCA tails probably occurred via bending of two predicted hinge regions that were present in the tail domain (Fig. 1B). The tail fragment upstream of the first hinge region was essential for the interaction (Fig. 5), whereas that downstream of the second hinge did not interact in two-hybrid tests, indicating that the tail fragment between the two hinges was responsible for the interactions observed (combination pGBT-KCA11,067-1,273 and pGAD-KCA1473-866, and pGBT-KCA21,052-1,267 with pGAD-KCA2425-864, and the reciprocal combinations). The tail interactions of KCA1 and KCA2 were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5B). Protein fragments containing the N-terminal part of the tail of KCA1 or KCA2 pulled down a KCA1 fragment containing sequences downstream of the first hinge region (Fig. 5B). We showed that KCA1 and KCA2 formed homo- or heterodimers and that both proteins can occur in a folded conformation. In addition, both proteins bind to CDKA;1 and contain CDKA;1 phosphorylation sites in the tail domain. Hence, we investigated whether CDKA;1 phosphorylation was implicated in KCA dimerization and folding. Western blot of BY-2 cells transformed with GFP fused to the full-length KCA1 protein (Fig. 3C) revealed two high molecular mass bands, one of which probably represents a dimeric form of GFP-KCA1. To test the role of phosphorylation in dimer formation, a phosphatase inhibitor was applied to the cells. BY-2 cells transformed with GFP-KCA1 were treated with vanadate (10 mm; CITATION), and equal amounts of proteins of control nontreated and treated cells were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel and blotted (Fig. 3C). The concentration of the 250-kD band increased, at the expense of the 160-kD band (Fig. 3C). These results show that phosphatase inhibition favored the formation of KCA dimers. To investigate whether CDKA;1 phosphorylation could have implications for CDKA;1 binding and KCA folding, we introduced mutations in the putative phosphorylation sites at positions 698 to 701 (TPNK) and 841 to 848 (SPGR/SPVR) in the pGBT-KCA1660-862 sequence that contains the N-terminal tail of KCA1. Thr (T698) and Ser (S841 and S845) were replaced by either an Ala (A) as a nonphosphorylable residue or by a Glu (E) that mimics the phosphorylated residue (Table I). We assessed the effects these changes had on the ability to interact with either CDKA;1 or with the KCA tail by means of two-hybrid analysis. Replacement of T698 by either an A or E had no consequences on the interaction with CDKA;1. On the contrary, substitution of the consensus sequences further downstream, S841 or S841/845 (S841 and S845 double substitution) with E residues, disallowed the yeast strain to grow on selective medium. Replacement of these residues by an A had little or no effect. These results indicated that CDKA;1 binding was sensitive to the phosphorylation status of residues S841 and S845. Mutational analysis in the stalk region of the KCA1 The same mutagenized KCA1660-862 fragments were tested against the C-terminal tail fragments KCA1875-1,273 and KCA2855-1,267 in the pGAD vector. Alteration of T698 in either A or E had no effect on the tail interactions. However, substitution of S841 into an E residue strongly reduced the interaction with the C-terminal tail regions of both KCA1 and KCA2, while replacement of both S841 and S845 completely abolished the interaction (Table I). Changing these residues by an A did not alter the growth of yeast. The results suggest that phosphorylation at the consensus sequences 841-844 and 845-848 in KCA1 and 827-830 in KCA2 influences the protein conformation that has important consequences concerning their activity.
!~MM~! A cDNA λ phage library of Arabidopsis (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia 0 was used to screen for the full-length clone matching fragment TH65 that had been isolated previously in a two-hybrid experiment with CDKA;1 as bait (CITATION). Two new cDNA fragments were isolated and sequenced that corresponded to the C-terminal region of the KCA1 gene, including a poly(A) tail region of 226 bp. The KCA2 gene was found by sequence homology with KCA1. The complete 5′ terminus of KCA1 and the full length of KCA2 were isolated by RACE-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the primers 5′-ATGGCCGATCAGAGAAGTAAAACC-3′ and 5′-GCCCACAACCTCTTGTTTCAGATTCTG-3′ for KCA1 and 5′-ATGGCGGAGCAGAAGAGTACCAA-3′ and 5′-GGATTTACTCTCGGGTTGTCAGAG-3′ for KCA2. The reported nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers AX449336 and AX449307. The Arabidopsis KCA proteins and KCA homologs were aligned by the Clustal method (PileUp) from the GCG Wisconsin package version 10.1 program (Accelrys, San Diego) without penalizing gaps. A set of analysis tools was applied for a compressive sequence interpretation. As BLAST browsers, the programs AtBlast (http://www.arabidopsis.org/blast/) (CITATION) and WU-BLAST2 (http://dove.embl-heidelberg.de/Blast2/; CITATION) were used to search databases for homologous sequences in Arabidopsis and other organisms. The Arabidopsis sequence map and gene redundancy were studied with different tools from the Munich Institute for Protein Sequences (Martiensried, Germany; http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html). Protein domains were analyzed with SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/; CITATION), general motifs were predicted and CDKA;1 phosphorylation sites were identified with ScanProsite (http://hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN; CITATION), and coiled coils were estimated with the algorithm of CITATION by using the program COILS (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html). RNA was prepared from 200 mg of 3-d-old Arabidopsis cell suspensions, 3-week-old plants (roots, rosette leaves, stems, and flowers), and 1-week-old seedlings. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used as template for semiquantitative RT-PCR with Superscript RT II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and oligo(dT)18. From the 50-μL PCR reaction, 10 μL was separated on a 1% Tris-acetate EDTA agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Bioscience, Little Chalfont, UK). The membranes were hybridized at 65°C with fluorescein-labeled probes (Gene Images random prime module; Amersham Biosciences) and detected with the CDP Star detection module (Amersham Biosciences). For RT-PCR, the following primers were used: 5′-GTGCCGGTTTTATCCTCGTTGACATCC-3′ and 5′-CGTATCAAGATATCGAACAGGGG-3′ for the KCA1 gene (position 1,185–2,556 bp); 5′-CCGATGATCGTCAACATTTGTCCAAGTGC-3′ and 5′-ACGGATTCTTGAAACTACAGATACC-3′ for the KCA2 gene (position 1,275–2,592 bp); and 5′-CTAAGCTCTCAAGATCAAAGGCTTA-3′ and 5′-TTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGGT-3′ for Arath;ACT2 (U41998). For cell cycle-dependent expression analysis, a suspension culture of the Arabidopsis cell line MM2d (CITATION) was grown in 1× Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with 3% Suc, 0.5 mg mg−1 L−1 naphthalene acetic acid, 0.05 mg L−1 kinetin (pH 5.7). MM2d cells were maintained weekly by subculturing of 5-mL stationary culture in 45 mL of fresh medium in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks and grown at 27°C in the dark on a shaker (130 rpm). The cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by treating them with 4 μg/mL aphidicolin for 14 h. To obtain cell populations at different stages of the cell cycle, cells were washed twice and then released into complete medium. They were incubated under cultivation conditions as above, and samples were taken hourly after release of the drug. The metaphase/anaphase index was determined according to CITATION. RNA was prepared following the method described by CITATION and used as a template for the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). RT-PCR primers for quantification of the mRNA level were as follows: 5′-CCGGAGACCCTCATTAGAA3′ and 5′-ACTCCAGTTCACTAACAAGGTC3′ for KCA1; 5′-TCGACTGAAACCGATGTGTC3′ and 5′-CTAGAGTATCGAGCCCGTGTG3′ for KCA2; 5′-GGTGAAGGAACTTACGGTGTGG3′ and 5′-GCTCCAGGGCGGCTCTTGCG3′ for CDKA;1. The CDKA;1 interaction site was mapped by constructing deletion fragments of the KCA genes. The DNA fragments were created by PCR with the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subcloned in the pGBT9 vector. The CDKA;1 was inserted into the pGAD424 vector (CLONTECH). A series of deletion fragments of KCA1 and KCA2 cDNA were amplified with primers containing EcoRI and BamHI enzyme restriction sites. The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors. The original pGAD-TH65 clone (residues 473−866) was also included as a positive control for CDKA;1 binding. Yeast strain HF7c reporter strain (MATa ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3112 gal4-542 gal80-538 LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL417-mers(×3)-CYC-1TATA_Lacz; CLONTECH) was cotransformed with pGAD-KCAx (x is deletion fragment) and pGAD-CDKA;1 or the empty vector as described previously (CITATION). After incubation on medium without Leu and Trp, colonies were plated on His-lacking medium. The strength of the protein-protein interactions were measured by the ability to grow on His-free medium supplemented with 0, 5, 10, or 15 mm of 3-AT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis). The same KCA deletion fragments generated by PCR for the two-hybrid assays were used to generate the pBSK-c-Myc and pBSK-HA vectors (Stratagene). The Arabidopsis CDKA;1 was recloned from the pGADCDKA;1 vector in the pBSK-HA vector with EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Plasmids were sequenced to verify in-frame cloning with the c-Myc tag and HA tag. In vitro transcription and translation experiments were performed separately for each construct with the TNT T7-coupled wheat germ extract kit (Promega, Madison, WI) primed with the appropriate template for 90 min at 30°C. For immunoprecipitation assays, 10 μL of the c-Myc-KCA total in vitro translated extract (50 μL) was mixed with 5 μL of the HA-CDKA;1 total in vitro translated extract, diluted at 1:5 in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin), and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with anti-HA antibodies (9E10; BabCo-Covance, Berkeley, CA). Protein-A-Sepharose beads (40 μL, 25% [v/v]) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed four times with 1 mL Nonidet P-40 buffer. Immune complexes were eluted with 10 μL of 2× SDS sample buffer, analyzed by a 13% SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. The same procedure was followed using the c-Myc-KCAs and HA-KCAs constructs to test for dimerization. The KCA1 full-length open reading frame and fragments were cloned behind the open reading frame of enhanced GFP by using the GATEWAY system (Invitrogen). GATEWAY-compatible vectors were designed by inserting the EGFP-coding region and the GATEWAY rfA cassette into the pBin19 backbone. The expression of the fusion was under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and 35S polyadenylation signal. For the construction of the inducible vector, a similar strategy was followed. The EGFP-rfA cassette was cloned into the pTA7002 vector allowing dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich)-inducible expression of the fusion protein (CITATION). The KCA1 full-length and fragments were amplified with GATEWAY attB-flanked primers with the Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). Via BP and subsequent LR reactions, the fragments were introduced into the destination vectors described above. The borders of the inserted fragments were sequenced prior to further analysis. Growth of BY-2 cells was according to CITATION. The transformation was performed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404.pBBR1MCS-5.virGN54D (CITATION). For cocultivation, 4 mL of a 3-d-old culture (10 times diluted) was mixed with Agrobacterium cultures. After 3 d at 28°C, the cells were plated on BY-2 medium containing 500 μg/mL carbenicillin, 200 μg/mL vancomycin, and 100 μg/mL kanamycin for the constitutive vector or 30 μg/mL hygromycin for the inducible vector. BY-2 cultures were transformed with pBin19GFP carrying the KCA1 motor (KCA11-497), and the KCA1 tail (KCA1660-1,273), leading to constitutive expression of fusion protein. For subcellular localization of the full-length KCA1 protein, the dexamethasone-inducible vector pTA7002GFP carrying the KCA11-1,273 fragment was used. Calli producing GFP-fusion proteins were identified by fluorescence microscopy. BY-2 cells transformed with the inducible expression vector were induced overnight on BY-2 agar containing 10 μm dexamethasone. Callus material was transferred on a slide with a coverslip, and observed with an epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. GFP-positive calli were transferred to liquid BY-2 medium with selection and grown as cell suspensions. Confocal images were taken with a scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss) with argon laser illumination at 488 nm and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. For transmission light images, differential interference contrast optics was used. Images were taken with 25% laser power to reduce photobleaching. Cells were incubated in liquid BY-2 medium containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min with gentle agitation. Cells were washed twice in BY-2 medium, transferred to a slide, and covered with a coverslip. The detergent-extracted cells were observed directly with the confocal microscope. Three-day-old liquid cultures of BY-2 transgenic lines, also used for GFP-localization experiments, and wild-type BY-2 cells were ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and homogenized in ice-cold P10 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm ethyleneglycol-bis(β-aminoethyl)tetra-acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 85 mm NaCl, 15 mm pNO2PhePO4, 60 mm glycerol phosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 100 μL protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5417 at 4°C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min. A sample was taken and kept on ice as crude extract. Then, 50 μL of 50% (v/v) p10CKS1At Sepharose beads was added to 300 μg of proteins and incubated at 4°C for 1 h on a rotating wheel. The beads were collected by centrifugation; the supernatant was removed and kept on ice. Beads were washed three times with bead buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaF, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Loading buffer (CITATION) was added and the samples were heated for 10 min at 95°C. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 4 min, 30 μg crude extract protein, 30 μg p10CKS1At supernatant, and p10CKS1At pellet purified from 300 μg initial crude extract was separated on a 12% gel. The amount protein loaded was verified in a separate gel by Coomassie staining. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C super; Amersham Biosciences) in 190 mm Gly and 25 mm Tris with a liquid miniblotting system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for 1 h. The protein on the blotted membrane was verified by Ponceau red staining. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% skim milk (BD Difco; Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For immunodetection, an anti-GFP rabbit serum (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was applied in the blocking buffer at a dilution of 1:1,000, and anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase from donkey (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a second antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. Membranes were stripped at 60 C for 30 min in buffer containing 100 mm β-mercapto-ethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7. They were washed twice with TBST for 10 min, blocked in TBST containing 3% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature. CDKA protein was detected using a 1:2,500 dilution of cdc2 PSTAIRE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase from donkey in TBST with 3% skim milk. Proteins were detected by the chemiluminescence procedure (Bio-Rad). For drug analysis, 10 mm Na3VO4 was added to a 2-d-old BY-2 culture, transformed with the inducible GFP-KCA1 construct. As control, a nontreated culture was cultured simultaneously. After 24 h of growth at 28°C, crude protein extracts were prepared in the P10 homogenization buffer. Thirty micrograms of proteins was loaded on a 12% gel and processed as described above. Point mutations were introduced by PCR site-directed mutagenesis in the pGTB-KCA1660-862 plasmid with the Advantage polymerase mix (CLONTECH). The linear PCR product was circularized by ligation. The nucleotide changes were verified by sequencing the KCA1 inserts in two directions.
