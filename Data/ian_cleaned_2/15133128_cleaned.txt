!~ABS~! Although early studies suggested that little compartmentalization exists within the nucleus, more recent studies on metazoan systems have identified a still increasing number of specific subnuclear compartments. Some of these compartments are dynamic structures; indeed, protein and RNA-protein components can cycle between different domains. This is particularly evident for RNA processing components. In plants, lack of tools has hampered studies on nuclear compartmentalization and dynamics of RNA processing components. Here, we show that transient expression of fluorescent protein fusions of U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)-specific proteins U1-70K, U2B″, and U2A ′, nucleolar proteins Nop10 and PRH75, and serine-arginine-rich proteins in plant protoplasts results in their correct localization. Furthermore, snRNP-specific proteins also were correctly assembled into mature snRNPs. This system allowed a systematic analysis of the cellular localization of Arabidopsis serine-arginine-rich proteins, which, like their animal counterparts, localize to speckles but not to nucleoli and Cajal bodies. Finally, markers for three different nuclear compartments, namely, nucleoli, Cajal bodies, and speckles, have been established and were shown to be applicable for colocalization studies in living plant protoplasts. Thus, transient expression of proteins tagged with four different fluorescent proteins is a suitable system for studying the nuclear organization of spliceosomal proteins in living plant cells and should therefore allow studies of their dynamics as well.
!~RES~! The lack of specific antibodies against plant spliceosomal proteins made it impossible to analyze the subnuclear organization of the splicing machinery in plant cells by indirect immunofluorescence. However, correct localization of GFP-tagged proteins in plant cells, among them also some splicing factors (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), has been well documented. For example, a GFP fusion of potato U2 snRNP-specific protein U2B″ expressed in stably transformed tobacco BY-2 cells and in Arabidopsis plants was shown to localize into a pattern that includes diffuse nucleoplasmic staining and strong accumulation in Cajal bodies (CITATION). In addition, analyses of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing SR proteins SR45, RSp31, SCL33/SR33, SRp34/SR1, and SRp30 revealed speckled nuclear localization patterns (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). However, generation of stable transgenic plants or cell suspension lines is time-consuming and does not allow simultaneous analysis of many proteins. In particular, colocalization studies that require at least two different fluorescent markers are very laborious when using transgenic plants. Therefore, we constructed plasmids for expression of RFP, mRFP, YFP, and CFP proteins, which together with the previously described pDEDH-GFP (CITATION) allow construction of C-terminal FP fusions of the protein of interest and analysis of fusion proteins in transient assays in plant protoplasts. All plasmids, along with pDEDH-GFP (CITATION), were transformed into tobacco mesophyll and Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts and 24 h after transformation protoplasts were analyzed for the expression of fluorescent proteins by confocal microscopy. All four fluorescent proteins are successfully expressed in both cell types, showing localization in both cytoplasm and the nucleus (Supplemental Figure 1), as reported previously for GFP (CITATION). In addition, expression of GFP, CFP, and YFP proteins also was analyzed by Western blotting, which indicated similar expression levels (our unpublished data), as expected from the fact that all proteins are expressed from the same promoter, with the same 5′ leader sequence and the same 3′ untranslated region. To find out whether transient expression of FP-tagged spliceosomal proteins can be used for studying nuclear organization of the spliceosomal machinery in living plant protoplasts, FP fusions of Arabidopsis U2 snRNP-specific proteins U2B″ and U2A′ were constructed. Both, U2B″-GFP (Figure 1A) and U2A′-GFP (Figure 1B) fusion proteins as well as U2B″-mRFP, U2B″-YFP and U2B″-CFP (Figure 1A; our unpublished data) were found in the nucleus within a diffuse nucleoplasmic pool and in Cajal bodies, which in most cases localized next to the nucleoli (seen as black areas). Virtually all cells transformed showed the same localization pattern. In a small percentage of transformed cells, irrespective of the FP tag used, both U2B″ and U2A′ also were found in the central nucleolar vacuole (Figure 1A, see U2B″-mRFP, and Figure 1B, broken arrows). The same nuclear patterns were observed with GFP-tagged SmB protein, a core component of U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNPs (our unpublished data; but see third rows in Figure 4, A and E). The observed nuclear patterns of U2B″ and U2A′ resemble that described previously by means of 1) indirect immunofluorescence with U2B″-specific antibodies (CITATION; CITATION); 2) RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization with U2 snRNA probe (CITATION); and 3) expression of U2B″-GFP fusion protein in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and tobacco BY-2 cells (CITATION). However, we have to mention here that the majority of transformed cells also showed localization of U2B″-GFP, U2B″-mRFP, U2B″-YFP, U2B″-CFP, and U2A′-GFP fusion proteins in the cytoplasm (Figure 1C; shown are only cells expressing GFP fusion proteins), even 48 h after transformation (also see DISCUSSION). Western analysis of cell lysates prepared from transformed cells showed that U2B″-GFP and U2A′-GFP fusion proteins are expressed at similar levels without detectable degradation products (Figure 1D). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To substantiate results obtained with U2 snRNP-specific proteins, analysis of Arabidopsis U1 snRNP-specific protein 70K (CITATION) fused to GFP or RFP was performed. Transient expression of RFP- (Figure 2, A and B) or GFP (Figure 2C)-tagged Arabidopsis U1-70K protein in tobacco (Figure 2, A and B; and Figure 2C, left) or in Arabidopsis (Figure 2C, right) protoplasts resulted in accumulation of fusion proteins in the nucleus, in a characteristic network of speckles. Only a small portion of both cell types used showed localization of U1-70K in Cajal bodies (Figure 2C, broken arrow on the right), consistent with the fact that U1 snRNP does not accumulate in Cajal bodies in plant cells (CITATION). In contrast to FP-tagged U2B″ and U2A′ proteins, RFP- and GFP-tagged U1-70K was found exclusively in the nucleus already at the time point when fluorescence can be first detected (usually 4-5 h after transformation). [[FIGURE]] Thus, results obtained with transient expression of FP-tagged U2 and U1 snRNP-specific proteins in protoplasts provide strong evidence that this system can be used to study the nuclear organization of the spliceosomal machinery in living plant cells. To further substantiate confocal microscopy results obtained with U1 and U2 snRNP-specific proteins, immunoprecipitations with protein extracts prepared from protoplasts transformed with plasmids expressing U1-70K-GFP, U2B″-GFP and U2A′-GFP fusion proteins were performed. All three proteins were efficiently precipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 3, A-C, lane 3), and more importantly with antibody against the m3G cap at the 5′ end of U snRNAs (Figure 3, A-C, lane 4). None of the proteins was found in the pellet after incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads alone (Figure 3, A-C, lane 2). In addition, analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-GFP antibody for the presence of snRNAs revealed efficient coprecipitation of U1 snRNA with U1-70K-GFP (Figure 3D, lane 4) and U2 snRNA with U2B″-GFP and U2A′-GFP fusion proteins (Figure 3D, lanes 2 and 3), but not of other spliceosomal snRNAs. Finally, immunoprecipitations with protein extracts prepared from protoplasts coexpressing U2B″-GFP and U2A′-HA or U2A′-GFP and U2B″-HA fusion proteins resulted in efficient coprecipitation of the two proteins (Figure 3E, lane 3, and Figure 3F, lane 2), indicating correct assembly of transiently expressed proteins into mature snRNPs. [[FIGURE]] Together, immunoprecipitation data and localization studies by confocal microscopy clearly demonstrated that transient expression of U1 and U2 snRNP-specific proteins in protoplasts results not only in correct localization but also in efficient incorporation into mature snRNPs. In addition, U2 snRNP-specific proteins U2B″ fused to GFP, mRFP, and YFP, and U2A′ fused to GFP proved to be good markers for Cajal bodies in transiently transformed plant protoplasts. Having established a transient expression system in which FP-tagged proteins localize and assemble correctly, we asked next whether this system can be used for colocalization studies of two different proteins. Arabidopsis protoplasts were cotransformed with plasmid combinations indicated in Figure 4, and 24 h later analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In general, >50% of transformed cells showed expression of both FP-tagged proteins. Because U2B″ and U2A′ are components of the same snRNP, we asked whether they colocalize in cotransformed cells. Arabidopsis protoplasts coexpressing U2B″-mRFP and U2A′-GFP showed perfect colocalization of proteins in Cajal bodies and nucleoplasm (Figure 4A, two top rows). This is consistent with the coprecipitation of these two proteins (Figure 3, E and F). In addition, coexpression of SmB-GFP and U2B″-mRFP resulted in colocalization of the two proteins in Cajal bodies and nucleoplasm (Figure 4A, third row), consistent with the fact that SmB is component of the U2 snRNP as well. U1-70K was shown to localize in a speckled pattern in the nucleoplasm. In addition, in a small percentage of cells localization in Cajal bodies also was observed (Figure 2C). This localization pattern is different from those obtained with U2B″ and U2A′ proteins. Coexpression of RFP-tagged U1-70K with U2B″-GFP resulted in partial colocalization in the nucleoplasm but not in Cajal bodies (Figure 4B, first row). In cells where U1-70K localized to Cajal bodies, colocalization with U2B″ also was observed (Figure 4B, second row, broken arrows), although not to the extent observed in cells coexpressing U2B″ and U2A′ (compare second row in Figure 4B with A). In contrast, coexpression of U1-70K with SRp34/SR1, an Arabidopsis SR protein that localizes to speckles (see below), resulted in perfect colocalization of the two proteins in speckles (Figure 4, C and D) but not in Cajal bodies (Figure 4D, broken arrows), consistent with the fact that SR proteins do not localize to Cajal bodies (also see Figure 7). [[FIGURE]] Analysis of Arabidopsis protoplasts coexpressing U2B″-GFP or U2A′-GFP and Nop10-RFP, an established marker for nucleoli and Cajal bodies (Supplemental Figure 2A) showed that Nop10 colocalizes with both proteins in Cajal bodies (Figure 4E, broken arrows) but not in the nucleoli (Figure 4E, arrows). Colocalization was not observed in nucleoplasm. These results are consistent with nuclear patterns obtained for each protein separately in which U2B″ and U2A′ localized to Cajal bodies and nucleoplasm (Figure 1, A and B), whereas Nop10 localized to nucleoli and Cajal bodies (Supplemental Figure 2A). Like with U2B″ and U2A′, coexpression of SmB-GFP with Nop10-RFP resulted in colocalization of the two proteins in Cajal bodies but not in nucleolus. In addition, portion of SmB present in the central nucleolar vacuole did not colocalize with Nop10 (Figure 4E, arrowhead in SmB-GFP row). PRH75 is another established marker for nucleoli (Supplemental Figure 2, C-E). However, Nop10 also localized to Cajal bodies (Supplemental Figure 2A), whereas no evidence for localization of PRH75 in Cajal bodies was provided (Supplemental Figure 2E). In Arabidopsis cells coexpressing Nop10-GFP and PRH75-RFP, the two proteins colocalized in nucleoli but not in Cajal bodies (Figure 4F). This indicated that PRH75 is not associated with Cajal bodies. Consistent with this, in cells coexpressing either U2B″-GFP or U2A′-GFP and PRH75-RFP no colocalization was observed (Figure 4F), confirming that PRH75 indeed does not localize in Cajal bodies. Together, colocalization studies presented in Figure 4 clearly demonstrate that coexpression of two proteins with different subnuclear localizations does not influence each others localization. Moreover, colocalization was observed only with protein combinations where this was expected, indicating that transient expression of two different FP-tagged proteins is suitable for colocalization studies in living plant cells. In mammalian cells, the majority of pre-mRNA splicing factors show speckled nuclear localization pattern (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). SR proteins have often been used as markers for nuclear speckles, also called SC35 domain, because of localization of SR protein SC35 in them (CITATION). The Arabidopsis genome encodes for 18 SR proteins (CITATION) that can be grouped into subfamilies according to their domain organization (Figure 5). The established transient expression system allowed us to extend the localization studies to plant SR proteins. Plasmids expressing GFP and RFP fusions of 12 of 18 Arabidopsis SR proteins were constructed, and localization of fusion proteins was analyzed in tobacco and Arabidopsis protoplasts. In both cell types, RFP and GFP fusions of all SR proteins analyzed were found in the nucleus in a pattern resembling speckles in mammalian cells (Figure 6A). The appearance of speckles in tobacco cells varied from irregularly shaped to more regularly shaped dot-like structures (Figure 6A, compare for example SRp34 and SCL30). In addition, a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining also was observed. In contrast, speckles in Arabidopsis cells were less prominent and smaller, and more protein was found in a diffuse nucleoplasmic pool irrespective of the FP-tag used (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 3). Analysis of protein expression by Western blotting with anti-GFP and anti-RFP antibodies revealed that the stronger speckled appearance in tobacco cells cannot be accounted to aggregation of degraded proteins, because no major degradation products were detected (Figure 6B) (our unpublished data). All images shown in Figure 6A were taken with living cells 24 h after transformation; however, analysis of transformed cells as early as 4-5 h after transformation also revealed nuclear localization of all proteins analyzed, indicating that the import of SR proteins into nuclei is very rapid. In addition, it became clear that none of the analyzed SR proteins associates with nucleoli, seen as black areas inside the nucleus (Figure 6A, arrows; compare also fluorescence image with differential interference contrast [DIC] image in Arabidopsis cells). Because all images in Figure 6A are single confocal sections, nucleoli are not visible in all nuclei shown. However, cotransformation of representatives of each subgroup of Arabidopsis SR proteins fused to GFP with the established nucleolar marker Nop10 fused to RFP clearly demonstrated that none of the SR proteins associates with nucleoli (Supplemental Figure 4). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Because some splicing factors, particularly snRNPs, have been found in Cajal bodies (Carmo-Fonseca et al., CITATION,CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; this work), we asked next whether SR proteins localize into this nuclear compartment. Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts were cotransformed with plasmids expressing SR proteins fused to RFP and U2B″ or U2A′ proteins fused to GFP. Both U2B″ and U2A′ proteins localized into Cajal bodies and in a diffuse/speckled pattern in which partial colocalization with SR proteins was detected. None of the SR proteins localized to Cajal bodies, as evident from the lack of colocalization with U2B″ or U2A′ at these sites (Figure 7; our unpublished data). Thus, we conclude that in Arabidopsis, like in mammalian cells, SR proteins do not localize in Cajal bodies.
!~MM~! pDEDH-GFP has been described by Lambermon et al. (CITATION). pDEDH-HA has been described by Genschik et al. (CITATION). pDEDH-RFP, pDEDH-mRFP, pDEDH-YFP, and pDEDH-CFP were constructed by cloning of RFP (dsRED; BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), mRFP (CITATION), YFP (BD Biosciences Clontech), and CFP (BD Biosciences Clontech) open reading frames into pDEDH/Nco (CITATION; CITATION). RFP and mRFP were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified with the following primers: RFP5′ CTGCAGGGATCCATGGTGCGCTCCTCCAAGAACGTC, RFP3′ CTGGACATGCATCTACAGGAACAGGTGGTGGCG, mRFP5′ GTCAGCGGATCCATGGCCTCCTCCGAGGACGTCATC,andmRFP3′GACTGCATGCATTTCGGCGCCGGTGGAGTGGC, which introduce BamHI and NsiI restriction sites (in bold) in front of start and after stop codons, respectively.

The 5′ primers for SCL28, SRp30, RSZp21, RSp31 introduced XmaI restriction sites; 5′ primers of SCL30, SCL30a, SCL33, atSC35, SRp34, RSZp22, RSZ33, RSp40, U2B″, U2A′, SmB, Nop10, and PRH75 introduced SalI restriction sites (in bold), followed by the plant consensus translation initiation sequence (in italics). The 3′ primers for SCL30 and SCL30a, and U1-70K introduced BglII restriction sites (in bold) in place of the stop codon, whereas all other 3′ primers introduced BamHI restriction sites. The PCR products were cut with the respective restriction enzymes and ligated into correspondingly opened pDEDH-GFP, pDEDH-RFP, pDEDH-mRFP, pDEDH-YFP, and pDEDH-CFP, resulting in C-terminally tagged GFP, RFP, mRFP, YFP, and CFP fusion constructs, respectively. The same PCR products were used for construction of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged proteins in pDEDH-HA. Nicotiana tabacum SR1 mesophyll protoplasts were isolated and transformed with 20 μg of plasmid DNA per 1 million of protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol method as described by Koop et al. (CITATION). Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts were prepared and transformed as described in Meskiene et al. (CITATION). Protoplasts were analyzed 24 h after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Twenty-four hours after transformation protoplasts were collected by centrifugation (15 min, 70 × g), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended in protoplast extraction buffer (PEB400; 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 400 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100), supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). One hundred microliters of PEB400 was used per 1 million protoplasts. The suspension was shortly vortexed and then sonicated three times for 6 s. An additional 100 μl of PEB400 was added to the extract, and the suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional mixing. After 15-min centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed at 4°C, the supernatant was mixed with PEB without KCl to adjust KCl concentration to 250 mM (PEB250). Protein extracts prepared from transformed protoplasts were incubated with anti-GFP mAb (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 hour on ice and then mixed with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and incubated on a rotary shaker additional 3 h at 4°C. After three washings with 1 ml of PEB200 and one washing with 1 ml of PEB250 the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer containing 0.5% SDS and extracted with phenol/chloroform. RNA was precipitated by addition of 40 μg of glycogen and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, labeled by [32P]pCp ligation and analyzed on 8% denaturing PAA gels. Proteins were precipitated from the organic phase by addition of 7 volumes of acetone, resuspended in 30 μl of loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In cases where only precipitated proteins were analyzed (immunoprecipitations with anti-m3G and anti-PRH75 antibodies), immunoprecipitates were directly resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. In all cases, control immunoprecipitation was performed with protein A-Sepharose beads alone. Protein extract prepared from 2 million transformed cells was used for one immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations with anti-m3G (CITATION) and anti-PRH75 antibodies were performed as described above, except that the antibodies were first bound to protein A-Sepharose and then mixed with protein extract. Images were obtained with a TCS-SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). GFP and RFP were excited with an ArKr laser at 476 and 568 nm, respectively. GFP was detected at 510 to 550 nm, and RFP and mRFP were detected at 630 to 680 nm. YFP was excited by two photon equipment at 820 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop software and prepared for presentation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and were electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were developed by using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, UK, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Antibodies were diluted as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-GFP 7.1 and 13.1 (Roche Diagnostics), 1:1000; rat monoclonal anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Diagnostics), 1:1000; rabbit polyclonal anti-PRH75, 1:500; rabbit polyclonal anti-RZ1, 1:500; goat anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1:10,000; goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 1:10,000; and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:20,000.
