!~ABS~! The chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) and its receptor, cpFtsY, posttranslationally target the nuclear-encoded light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCPs) to the translocase Alb3 in the thylakoid membrane. In this study, we analyzed the interplay between the cpSRP pathway components, the substrate protein LHCP and the translocase Alb3 by using in vivo and in vitro techniques. We propose that cpSRP43 is crucial for the binding of LHCP-loaded cpSRP and cpFtsY to Alb3. In addition, our data suggest that a direct interaction between Alb3 and LHCP contributes to the formation of this complex.
!~RES~! In a previous study, the recombinant C-terminus of Alb3 was shown to interact with cpSRP43 CITATION. Here we aimed to extend the analysis of the interaction between Alb3 and components of the cpSRP-pathway using full-length Alb3 and in vivo systems. Therefore, we employed the yeast split-ubiquitin two-hybrid system and the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay using Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATION ). Yeast cells were cotransformed with two plasmids encoding Alb3 or Alb4 fused to the C-terminal half of ubiquitin (Cub) and one of the indicated soluble SRP-pathway proteins fused to a point mutant of the N-terminal half of ubiquitin (NubG). CITATIONA shows that Alb3 interacts with cpSRP43 but not with cpSRP54 or cpFtsY. No binding was observed between Alb4 and any of the soluble SRP-components. The BiFC system was used to investigate the potential interactions of Alb3 and Alb4 with the soluble cpSRP-pathway components in A. thaliana mesophyll protoplasts. Protoplasts expressing cpSRP43 fused to the N-terminal fragment of YFP (cpSRP43-nYFP) and Alb3 fused to the C-terminal fragment of YFP (Alb3-cYFP) or the combination of cpSRP43-cYFP and Alb3-nYFP show a strong YFP fluorescence that overlaps with the chlorophyll autofluorescence. This result indicates that cpSRP43 and Alb3 interact in chloroplasts in vivo (CITATIONB). As in the split-ubiquitin system, no interaction was observed between Alb3 and cpSRP54 or cpFtsY (CITATION). In addition, we could not detect binding of any of the SRP components to Alb4 (CITATION, CITATION C). The expression and correct insertion of Alb4-cYFP into the thylakoid membrane were shown previously CITATION. Here we showed that Alb3-cYFP was also detected exclusively in the NaOH-washed membrane fraction prepared from transformed protoplasts. In contrast, cpSRP43-nYFP was found mainly in the soluble fraction (CITATIONC). In further control reactions, protoplasts were transformed with a combination of the nYFP- or cYFP-fused cpSRP43, cpSRP54, cpFtsY, Alb4 or Alb3 constructs and the corresponding control plasmids encoding nYFP or cYFP that were imported into the chloroplast by an N-terminal fused chloroplast transit sequence. No YFP fluorescence was detected in any of the control combinations (CITATIONB and data not shown). Both the split-ubiquitin and the BiFC results demonstrate that cpSRP43 directly interacts with Alb3 in vivo. To analyze whether the binding of cpSRP43 to the thylakoid membrane is based exclusively on a protein-protein interaction, salt-washed and protease-treated Arabidopsis thylakoids were used for binding experiments. As shown in CITATIONA, recombinant His-cpSRP43 and His-cpFtsY, but not the GST control, bound to salt-washed thylakoids. In contrast to cpFtsY, which contains a membrane-binding motif CITATION, protease treatment led to a complete loss of cpSRP43 binding. To exclude any residual protease activity, the non-degraded nature of the recombinant proteins in the unbound fraction was demonstrated (CITATIONA). As shown in CITATIONB, cpSRP43 could be removed from the membrane by alkali washing but not by high ionic strength buffers, suggesting a salt-resistant stable interaction between Alb3 and cpSRP43. A recent report demonstrated that the stromal C-terminus of Alb3 (aa 339–462) binds cpSRP43 in vitro CITATION. To clarify whether this binding also occurs in vivo, we tested the interaction of cpSRP43 with various Alb3 constructs using the BiFC system in Arabidopsis protoplasts (CITATIONC). As expected, no YFP-fluorescence was detected using cpSRP43-nYFP and Alb3(Δ342–462), which lacks the stroma-exposed C-terminus. To test whether the Alb3 C-terminus is sufficient to mediate the interaction with cpSRP43, we replaced the C-terminus of Alb4 with the Alb3 C-terminus (343–462). However, the resulting fusion protein, Alb4(1–326)Alb3(343–462)-cYFP, did not interact with cpSRP43-nYFP. Therefore, a fusion construct was produced in which the fifth transmembrane domain and the C-terminus of Alb4 were replaced with the corresponding region of Alb3. A clear interaction was observed between the resulting construct, Alb4(1–300)Alb3(314–462)-cYFP, and cpSRP43-nYFP (CITATIONC). Taken together, the results of our in vivo study support the in vitro findings of Falk et al. CITATION that the C-terminal region of Alb3 binds cpSRP43. However, our data indicate that residues 314–462, which correspond to the fifth transmembrane domain and the stroma-exposed C-terminus of Alb3, are required for an efficient recruitment of cpSRP43 to the thylakoid membrane in vivo. To analyze the role of cpSRP43 in the formation of a cpSRP/cpFtsY/Alb3-complex, we tested the binding of His-cpSRP43, His-cpSRP54, His-cpFtsY or a preformed His-cpSRP complex (consisting of His-cpSRP43 and cpSRP54) and the combinations His-cpSRP54/Strep-cpFtsY or His-cpSRP/Strep-cpFtsY to in vitro translated Alb3(299–462). To prevent possible complex dissociation by GTP activity of cpSRP54 and cpFtsY, all assays were conducted in the presence of GMP-PNP. As shown in CITATION , Alb3(299–462) copurifies with cpSRP43, the cpSRP complex and a combination of cpSRP and cpFtsY, but not with cpSRP54 or cpFtsY. A combination of cpSRP54 and cpFtsY precipitated a very small amount of Alb3(299–462). The coprecipitation of Strep-cpFtsY with cpSRP/Alb3(299–462) indicates that a complex consisting of cpSRP, Alb3(299–462) and cpFtsY can be formed. Taken together, these data show that the presence of cpSRP43 is crucial for the recruitment of cpSRP/cpFtsY to Alb3. To study the influence of LHCP on the interaction between cpSRP43 or cpSRP and Alb3(299–462), we performed pull-down assays using His-cpSRP43 or the preformed His-cpSRP complex, Alb3(299–462) and in vitro translated LHCP. An unrelated His-tagged protein was used as a control. As shown in CITATION A and B, in vitro translated LHCP binds to cpSRP43 and cpSRP, respectively. Interestingly, the addition of increasing amounts of Alb3(299–462) led to a significant increase in the amount of LHCP coprecipitated. Likewise, the addition of increasing amounts of translated LHCP to pull-down assays containing constant amounts of His-cpSRP43 or His-cpSRP and Alb3(299–462) stimulated binding of Alb3(299–462) (CITATIONA and B). We did not detect significant differences in the amount of coprecipitated cpSRP54, indicating that the cpSRP complex remained stable under the different conditions (CITATIONB). These data clearly show that a complex can be formed from three components, cpSRP43 or cpSRP, LHCP and Alb3(299–462). In addition, they indicate that the formation of the complex containing all three components is more efficient than the binding of cpSRP43 to LHCP or Alb3 alone. It is conceivable that LHCP-loaded cpSRP43 might have a higher affinity for Alb3(299–462). Since it was shown that cpSRP43 binds to an internal signal sequence of LHCP, the L18 region CITATION, we analyzed the effect of the L18 peptide on the cpSRP43/Alb3 interaction. However, in contrast to the LHCP translation product, the presence of L18 did not promote the binding of cpSRP43 and Alb3(299–462) (CITATIONC). These data suggest that binding of the L18 peptide to cpSRP43 does not result in a higher affinity of cpSRP43 to Alb3. In bacteria, the GTPase cycle of FtsY and the SRP54 homolog, Ffh, initiates the release of SRP from the translocon and the nascent chain. To analyze the effect of cpFtsY in the presence of GTP on the cpSRP/LHCP/Alb3-complex, we added Strep-cpFtsY to pull-down assays including the preformed His-cpSRP complex, in vitro translated LHCP and Alb3(299–462). Proteins bound to His-cpSRP43 were recovered using Ni-NTA. The addition of Strep-cpFtsY in the presence of GTP led to a decrease of precipitated Alb3, whereas no significant change in the amounts of precipitated cpSRP54 and LHCP was detected (CITATIOND). These data suggest that the GTPase cycle triggers the release of cpSRP from the Alb3 translocon, whereas additional components, e.g., a lipid bilayer or full-length Alb3, seem to be required to initiate the release of LHCP from cpSRP. To analyze whether an additional contact zone between LHCP and Alb3(299–462) might contribute to the formation of the cpSRP/LHCP/Alb3-complex (see Section CITATION and CITATIONA and B), the binding of in vitro translated LHCP to recombinant His-Alb3(299–462) was tested. As shown in CITATION A, LHCP copurifies with His-Alb3(299–462) but not to a significant amount with His-Alb3(361–462), which represents a part of the stromal C-terminus, His-Alb4(283–499) or a control His-tagged protein. Binding between LHCP and Alb3 was also observed using the BiFC system in protoplasts (CITATIONB). YFP fluorescence was reconstituted in protoplasts expressing nYFP-LHCP and Alb3-cYFP, whereas no interaction was detected between nYFP-LHCP and Alb4-cYFP. In accordance with the pull-down experiments, no YFP fluorescence was detected using a Alb4/Alb3 fusion construct in which the C-terminus of Alb4 was replaced with the Alb3 C-terminus (Alb4(1–326)Alb3(343–462)-cYFP), while the construct Alb4(1–288)Alb3(296–462)-cYFP bound to nYFP-LHCP. These data indicate a direct interaction between LHCP and Alb3 and suggest that this interaction might contribute to the cpSRP43/LHCP/Alb3-complex formation.

For Western blot analysis antibodies directed against the His-tag (Qiagen), Arabidopsis cpSRP54, cpFtsY, Alb3 and LHCP were used. Salt-washed (SW) or protease- (trypsin) treated (PT) Arabidopsis thylakoids (equal to 50μg chlorophyll) were incubated with 2μg of His-cpSRP43, His-cpFtsY or GST for 30min at 4°C. The thylakoids were washed in IBM CITATION containing 500mM NaCl unless otherwise indicated or washed in IBM containing the indicated salt concentrations or additional reagents. Thylakoids were analyzed by SDS–PAGE and Western blotting using the antibodies described above. cDNAs encoding full-length Alb3, Alb3ΔC-term(Δ342–462), full-length cpFtsY or the transit sequence of the small subunit of chloroplast ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (TSrbcs) from P. sativum (residues 1–58 of full-length protein) were cloned into the BamHI/SalI site of pUC-Spyce or pUC-Spyne CITATION. pSpyne-Alb3 was constructed using the XbaI/SalI site of pUC-Spyne.
