!~ABS~! Sugar signaling pathways have been evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes and are postulated to help regulate plant growth, development and responses to environmental cues. Forward genetic screens have identified sugar signaling or response mutants. Here we report the identification and characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana sugar insensitive8 (sis8) mutants, which display a sugar-resistant seedling development phenotype. Unlike many other sugar insensitive mutants, sis8 mutants exhibit wild-type responses to the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid and paclobutrazol (an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis) on seed germination. Positional cloning of the SIS8 gene revealed that it encodes a putative mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK; At1g73660). SIS8mRNA is expressed ubiquitously among Arabidopsis organs. A UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT72E1 (At3g50740), was identified as an interacting partner of SIS8 based on a yeast two-hybrid screen and in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Both SIS8–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and UGT72E1–YFP fusion proteins localize to the nucleus when transiently expressed in tobacco leaf cells. T-DNA insertions in At3g50740 cause a sugar-insensitive phenotype. These results indicate that SIS8, a putative MAPKKK, is a regulator of sugar response in Arabidopsis and interacts with a UDP-glucosyltransferase in the nucleus.
!~RES~! High levels of exogenous Suc or Glc (e.g. 0.3 m) prevent the majority of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings from developing green expanded cotyledons and true leaves (Zhou et al., CITATION; Arenas-Huertero et al., CITATION; Huijser et al., CITATION; Laby et al., CITATION). In contrast, equimolar concentrations of sorbitol (a non-metabolizable sugar analog in Arabidopsis) do not exert this effect, indicating that the inhibitory effects of high sugar levels on early seedling development are not solely due to osmotic stress (Laby et al., CITATION). The ability of high sugar levels to inhibit early seedling development has been used to identify mutations that alter seedling sensitivity to sugars (Zhou et al., CITATION; Arenas-Huertero et al., CITATION; Huijser et al., CITATION; Laby et al., CITATION; Gibson et al., CITATION; Huang et al., CITATION, CITATION). In one such screen performed by our lab, approximately 60 000 M2 seeds derived from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana var. Col-0 population were screened to identify seedlings that are resistant to 0.3 m Suc. The mutants identified via this screen are also resistant to high concentrations of Glc and so were designated sugar insensitive, or sis, mutants (Laby et al., CITATION). Cloning and characterization of one of these mutants, the sis8-1 mutant, is described below. The sis8-1 mutant, which is in the Col-0 background, was backcrossed to the Col-0 wild type. The resulting F1 seedlings exhibit a wild-type response to 0.3 m Suc, indicating that the mutant's sugar insensitive phenotype is recessive. To initiate map-based cloning of SIS8, sis8-1 was crossed to wild-type plants of the Hi-O background. F2 progeny of this cross were screened on media containing 0.3 or 0.32 m Suc. Those seedlings that displayed a sis mutant phenotype were used to form a mapping population of 1964 plants. Fine-scale mapping localized SIS8 to a 13 kb region on bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone F25P22 that contains four genes. DNA spanning the entire 13-kb region was isolated from sis8-1 by PCR and fully sequenced. This sequencing revealed the presence of only a single point mutation within the 13 kb region shown to contain the SIS8 gene. This point mutation causes a C to T transition at position 4653 (according to TAIR sequence accession 1009091393) in the genomic DNA of At1g73660. At1g73660 is predicted to encode a putative plant raf family MAPKKK involved in salt tolerance (Gao and Xiang, CITATION). The sis8-1 mutation causes an amino acid change of proline to serine (Pro→Ser) at position 968 in exon 12, which lies within the predicted kinase domain. To test whether At1g73660 is the SIS8 gene, three independent lines carrying T-DNA insertions in At1g73660 (Figure 1a) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that each of these T-DNA insertions disrupts production of full-length SIS8 mRNA (Figure 1b). These mutants were renamed as sis8-1 (the original sis8 point mutation mutant), sis8-2 (SALK_059205), sis8-3 (SALK_001982) and sis8-4 (SALK_004541). Testing revealed that all of these mutants display significant resistance to high concentrations of Suc and Glc. In contrast, sis8 and wild-type seedlings exhibit similar morphologies when grown on media containing equimolar concentrations of sorbitol (Figure 2a and Figure S1 in Supporting Information). A complementation test was performed to test further whether At1g73660 corresponds to the SIS8 gene. A 5.9-kb genomic DNA fragment from At1g73660, including the predicted 1.5-kb promoter, was cloned into the Gateway destination vector pEarleyGate302 (Earley et al., CITATION) and used to transform sis8-1 via the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION). Seeds from a T3 homozygous transgenic line were used in qRT-PCR and sugar response assays. The expression level of SIS8 in the complementation line is approximately twice that of Col-0 wild type (Figure 1b). The complementation line is not resistant to 0.27 m Suc or Glc (Figure 2a), further indicating that At1g73660 is the SIS8 gene. The function of SIS8 in sugar response was further investigated in SIS8 overexpression lines. The SIS8 coding region was placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and introduced into Col-0 wild-type plants. Three independent T3 homozygous transgenic lines were recovered and qRT-PCR analysis revealed overexpression of the SIS8 transcript in all three lines (Figure 2b). The SIS8 overexpression lines exhibit a hypersensitive response to the inhibitory effects of 0.22 m Glc or Suc on early seedling development when compared with wild-type plants (Figure 2c). The SIS8 overexpression lines also exhibit slightly lower rates of seed germination, cotyledon expansion and true leaf formation than wild-type plants when grown on medium supplemented with 0.22 m sorbitol, but these effects are substantially smaller than the effects of 0.22 m Glc or Suc. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] As some previously characterized sugar-response mutants also exhibit defects in ABA or gibberellin (GA) response, the sis8 mutants were tested for aberrant response to ABA and GA. Seeds of mutant and wild-type plants were sterilized, stratified and sown on minimal medium containing the indicated concentrations of ABA or paclobutrazol (an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis) and scored for percentage germination after 9 days. When assayed on media lacking both ABA and paclobutrazol, high percentages of seeds from all of the lines germinated. When sown on media supplemented with 1 μm ABA, sis8-1, sis8-2, sis8-3 and sis8-4 seeds exhibit germination percentages that are not significantly different from wild-type seeds (Figure 3a). Similarly, when assayed on 30 μm paclobutrazol, sis8-1, sis8-2, sis8-3 and sis8-4 seeds exhibit germination rates that are similar to those of wild-type seeds (Figure 3b). The wild-type germination responses of the sis8 seeds to ABA and GA are in agreement with the observations of Gao and Xiang (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the relative expression levels of SIS8 in different Arabidopsis organs. SIS8 transcript was detected in diverse organs of Arabidopsis including roots, stems, leaves, siliques and flowers, with higher expression in leaves (Figure 4a). Our data were compared with microarray data compiled by Genevestigator (Zimmermann et al., CITATION) (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch). According to Genevestigator, SIS8 is expressed ubiquitously in all major organ and tissue types tested, with higher expression levels found in leaves. A developmental expression profile reveals that SIS8 mRNA is present at slightly higher levels at the seedling stage than in germinated seeds, with mature siliques having the lowest levels of expression. Analysis of stimulus response data compiled by Genevestigator indicates that SIS8 mRNA levels are two- to three-fold lower on ABA and two-fold lower on NAA, a synthetic auxin analog, but are increased nearly three-fold by heat stress and 3.5-fold by brassinolide application, suggesting that SIS8 is affected by plant hormone signaling and abiotic stress responses. Interestingly, salt treatment caused a decrease in levels of SIS8 mRNA in seedlings (Gao and Xiang, CITATION). To investigate whether Glc levels affect SIS8 expression in germinating seeds, qRT-PCR experiments were conducted. The results of these experiments indicate that SIS8 transcript levels are not substantially affected by Glc treatment in germinating seeds (Figure 4b). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether SIS8 regulates the expression of genes involved in different sugar response pathways, germinating seeds of sis8-3 and wild-type Col-0 were treated with 0.1 m Suc or sorbitol and transcript levels determined by qRT-PCR. The genes analyzed include components of the hexokinase-dependent pathway (HXK1 and TPS1) (Jang et al., CITATION; Avonce et al., CITATION), the RGS1 pathway (RGS1, GPA1 and THF1) (Chen et al., CITATION; Huang et al., CITATION) and the SnRK1 pathway (AKIN10 and AKIN11) (Bhalerao et al., CITATION). Levels of RGS1 transcript are higher in sis8-3 seeds germinating on 0.1 m Glc or sorbitol than in wild-type seeds germinating on the same media and AKIN11 transcript levels are higher in sis8-3 seeds germinating on 0.1 m Glc than in wild-type seeds germinating on 0.1 m Glc (Figure 4c). However, the effects of the sis8-3 mutation on expression of these genes are quite small, with a maximum difference in transcript levels between the mutant and wild type of less than 30%. The Y2H system has been used extensively for detecting protein–protein interactions. Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted at the Molecular Interaction Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison using the SIS8 protein as bait and proteins generated from random Arabidopsis cDNAs as prey. Six possible SIS8-interacting proteins were identified (Table 1). The interactions of each of the six prey constructs and the SIS8 bait construct in yeast were retested in vivo (Figure 5). The results of these assays indicate that each of the prey constructs produces a fusion protein that gives a positive interaction with the fusion protein produced by the SIS8 bait construct. Furthermore, none of the prey constructs gives a positive result with the empty bait construct, indicating that a positive interaction is dependent on production of a SIS8 fusion protein (Figure 5). AGI, Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. The sugar insensitive phenotype was characterized by assaying at least one homozygous T-DNA insertion line for each gene. [[FIGURE]] The identities of the genes encoding the six putative SIS8-interacting proteins are listed in Table 1. The protein that shows the strongest interaction with SIS8 in the Y2H assays is UGT72E1 (At3g50740), a UDP-glucose:glycosyltransferase that specifically conjugates lignin monomers such as coniferyl aldehyde and sinapyl aldehyde (Lim et al., CITATION). To test the interaction between SIS8 and UGT72E1, a co-localization study was performed. SIS8 and UGT72E1 were fused with fluorescent proteins and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves (Nicotiana benthamiana) (Sparkes et al., CITATION). A previously reported nuclear protein, HRB1, was used as a positive control (Kang et al., CITATION). Signals from fluorescent proteins clearly demonstrate that SIS8 and UGT72E1 are targeted to the nucleus (Figure 6a). To visualize the SIS8–UGT72E1 interaction in living plant cells, the BiFC technique, which has been used successfully for visualization of protein–protein interactions (Walter et al., CITATION), was adopted. SIS8 was cloned into the split YFP vector pUC-SPYNE (N-terminal fragment), and UGT72E1 was cloned into pUC-SPYCE (C-terminal fragment). Mixtures of agrobacteria carrying the SIS8–SPYNE and UGT72E1–SPYCE constructs were co-transformed into tobacco leaves. Epidermal cells expressing both constructs show yellow fluorescence in the nucleus, confirming the SIS8–UGT72E1 protein–protein interaction and its nuclear localization (Figure 6b). The bZIP63 protein was used as a positive control (Walter et al., CITATION) and exhibits a yellow fluorescence signal in the nucleus. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether mutations in the genes encoding potential SIS8-interacting proteins cause a sugar insensitive phenotype, T-DNA insertion lines predicted to carry inserts in four of the six genes (Table 1) were obtained from the ABRC. Seeds from lines homozygous for each insertion were screened on 0.23 m Suc to test for a hypersensitive response and on 0.27 m Glc to test for a Glc-resistant phenotype. Interestingly, SALK_078702 (ugt72e1-1) and GABI_340H02 (ugt72e1-2), which carry T-DNA inserts in UGT72E1 (Figure 7a), display sugar insensitive phenotypes. When grown on medium supplemented with 0.26 m Suc, both homozygous ugt72e1 mutant lines display rates of cotyledon expansion and true leaf formation that are significantly higher than those of wild-type seedlings grown on the same medium. In contrast, when grown on minimal medium with no sugar supplement, the ugt72e1 lines develop expanded cotyledons and true leaves at rates similar to wild-type plants grown on the same medium (Figures 7b and S1). The ugt72e1 lines also exhibit wild-type sensitivity to the effects of 0.26 m sorbitol and 0.15 m NaCl on early seedling development (Figure S2). UGT72E1 transcript levels are not regulated by 0.1 m Glc in germinating seeds. Similarly, the sis8-3 mutation does not significantly affect UGT72E1 transcript levels in germinating seeds (Figure 7c). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! A mutant population comprised of 60 000 M2 seeds derived from EMS-mutagenized A. thaliana var. Col-0 was screened on 0.3 m Suc. The sis8-1 mutant was isolated based on its sugar-resistant seedling growth phenotype. Seed segregating for the sis8-2 (SALK_059205), sis8-3 (SALK_001982), sis8-4 (SALK_004541) and ugt72e1-1 (SALK_078702) mutations were obtained from the ABRC in the Col-0 (CS60000) background. GABI_340H02 seeds that are homozygous for the ugt72e1-2 mutation were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) (Kleinboelting et al., CITATION). Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify plants that are homozygous for the sis8-2, sis8-3, sis8-4 and ugt72e1-1 mutations. The sis8-1, sis8-2 and sis8-4 seeds used for the physiological assays and qRT-PCR analyses were from mutant plants backcrossed to wild-type plants of the same ecotype three times, twice and once, respectively. Seeds of spy-3 (Jacobsen and Olszewski, CITATION), which is also in the Col-0 background, were provided by Dr Neil Olszewski (University of Minnesota). Wild-type Col-0 (CS6000) and Hi-O (CS6736) seeds were obtained from the ABRC. Seeds to be sown on plates were surface sterilized and stratified for 3 days in the dark at 4°C. Typically 50–100 seeds were sown per plate. Plants were grown on Petri plates at 22°C under continuous white fluorescent light for an additional 12–14 days prior to scoring. Minimal Arabidopsis medium was prepared as described (Kranz and Kirchheim, CITATION). Gene expression was assayed in the tissues indicated for each experiment. To assay gene expression in germinating seeds, seeds were stratified and sown on nytex screens on solid minimal Arabidopsis medium and incubated for 20 h under continuous light and then transferred to minimal medium supplemented with the indicated additive for another 12–13 h under continuous light before harvesting. Isolation of RNA was done using either the Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com/) or the Sigma Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/). After DNaseI treatment (Promega, http://www.promega.com/), first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using the Promega Improm-II RT system kit (Promega). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a Roche Lightcycler 480 II PCR Machine and Roche Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green I Master reagent (Roche Diagnostics, http://www.roche.com/). Primers used were: UBQ10 (At4g05320), 5′-GGCCTTGTATAATCCCTGATGAATAAG-3′ and 5′-AAAGAGATAACAGGAACGGAAACATAGT-3′; UBQ6 (At2g47110), 5′-CCATCGACAATGTCAAGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGTACGTCCGTCTTCGAGCT-3′; ACTIN7 (At5g09810), 5′-TGCTGACCGTATGAGCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GATTGATCCTCCGATCCAGA-3′; SIS8 A 5′-CAACGTGATAATGGCAAAGTT-3′ and 5′-ATGGGGGAGGAGTCTGAGTT-3′; SIS8 B 5′-TCCCGACTTTGTAGATCCAG-3′ and 5′-AAGAGGAACTGGGGACTGGT-3′; UGT72E1 (At3g50740), 5′-CAGATGATGAACGCGACACT-3′ and 5′-CCTGACACGCTCCAAAAGAT-3′; HXK1 (At4g29130), 5′-GCAACCGCGATCCCTAAAT-3′ and 5′-CCAGCGTGTGATCAAACTCG-3′; TPS1 (At1g78580), 5′-GGTGTCACAAAGGGAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-CATCTTCGTCCTTCCCCAAG-3′; RGS1 (At3g26090), 5′-TTTCCTCCCCCTTGTTTTGTT-3′ and 5′-ATGAAGGCCTGCAACTGGG-3′; GPA1 (At2g26300), 5′-TGAACGTTTGCGAGTGGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGCCGTGTTCTGGTAATA-3′; AKIN10 (At3g01090), 5′-TCCCCGTGAAATAATGACGG-3′ and 5′-CATACCATCTGCGCTGCTGT-3′; AKIN11 (At3g29160), 5′-TCCTATGCGCACACCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TCCAAGAGCCCATTTTCGAT-3′; THF1 (At2g20890) 5′-CAGCAGGTTCTTCGCTGTTG-3′ and 5′-GTCCCGATCCACGCTTTTC-3′. For qRT-PCR experiments two technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate and data were normalized by comparison with UBQ10 or the geometric average (Vandesompele et al., CITATION) of ACTIN7 and UBQ6, as indicated for each experiment. To generate the sis8-1 mapping population, F2 seedlings from a cross between sis8-1 and wild-type plants of the Hi-0 background were screened on media containing 0.3 or 0.32 m Suc to identify plants that are homozygous for the sis8-1 mutation. Genomic DNA was prepared from leaves of these seedlings using the alkaline lysis method (Klimyuk et al., CITATION). Other mapping procedures were performed as described (Lukowitz et al., CITATION; Jander et al., CITATION). Molecular markers from the TAIR and Monsanto SNP and Ler sequence collections (Jander et al., CITATION) were tested for polymorphisms between Col-0 and Hi-O wild-type plants prior to use in the mapping experiments. All constructs were generated using the Gateway system (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/). For SIS8 overexpression lines, the SIS8 full length coding sequence (3093 bp) was amplified from Col-0 leaf total RNA by PCR, confirmed by sequencing to be free of mutations and then cloned into the pEarleyGate100 destination vector behind the CaMV 35S promoter (Earley et al., CITATION). For the complementation tests, a SIS8 genomic DNA fragment (including 1500 bp upstream of the ATG start codon, all exons and introns, and ending before the stop codon) was amplified from wild-type Col-0 DNA and cloned into pEarleyGate302. The resulting binary vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation. Transformation of sis8-1 or wild-type Col-0 was performed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION). T1 transgenic plants exhibiting resistance to media containing 7 μg ml−1 Basta were further tested by PCR analysis and confirmed to contain the appropriate plant transformation construct. These T1 plants were then transferred to soil to obtain T2 seeds. T3 and T4 homozygous lines were used for sugar response assays, germination assays and gene expression analysis. For sugar-response assays, 50–100 seeds were surface sterilized, stratified at 4°C in the dark for 3 days, sown on minimal Arabidopsis medium supplemented with the indicated sugars, incubated at 22°C in the light for 14 days and then scored for seed germination, cotyledon expansion and true leaf formation as described (Laby et al., CITATION). For NaCl response assays, 50–100 seeds were surface sterilized, stratified at 4°C in the dark for 3 days, sown on MS medium supplemented with NaCl, incubated at 22°C in the light for 14 days and then scored for cotyledon expansion as described (Gao and Xiang, CITATION). For ABA and paclobutrazol response assays, seeds were surface sterilized, stratified at 4°C in the dark for 3 days and then sown on Arabidopsis minimal medium supplemented with the indicated chemicals and incubated at 22°C under continuous light for 9 days prior to scoring for percentage seed germination. Germination is defined as the emergence of the radicle from the seed coat. All experiments were performed a minimum of two times, with similar results each time. The full-length coding sequence of SIS8 minus the stop codon (TGA) was amplified by PCR, verified by sequencing to be free of mutations and cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was sent to the Molecular Interaction Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where the Y2H screen was performed. The SIS8 gene was cloned into the pBUTE vector to produce a hybrid gene encoding a SIS8–GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) fusion protein. The prey constructs were generated using the pGADT7-Rec vector, into which Arabidopsis cDNAs were inserted to create a library that produces fusion proteins consisting of random Arabidopsis proteins fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD). The yeast strain PJ69-4A (Ura−, His−, Leu−, Ade−), which carries three chromosomally integrated reporter constructs (GAL1-HIS3, GAL2-ADE2 and GAL7-lacZ), was used as the host (James et al., CITATION). The Y2H screen resulted in identification of six genes that give a reproducible positive interaction signal in the presence of the construct encoding the SIS8–GAL4 BD fusion protein, but not in the presence of the empty vector construct, which encodes only the GAL4 BD. To retest the results of the Y2H screen, each positive prey plasmid was introduced into yeast strains carrying pBUTE with or without the SIS8 insert using the lithium acetate method (Gietz and Schiestl, CITATION). Single transformants were picked and grown on synthetic complete (SC)–Leu–Ura–Ade plates to detect protein–protein interactions, which result in growth of white colonies. To analyze subcellular localization, the SIS8 full-length coding sequence lacking the stop codon was amplified by PCR, verified by sequencing to be free of mutations and cloned into the pEarleyGate 101 and 102 vectors to create the 35S::SIS8:YFP and 35S::SIS8:CFP constructs, respectively. Similarly, the UGT72E1 full-length coding sequence without the stop codon was used to create 35S::UGT72E1:YFP (in pEarleyGate 101). The 35S::HRB1:CFP construct (in the pEarleyGate 102 vector) was obtained from Dr Xiaodong Sun (University of Minnesota). The constructs were introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90). Agrobacteria carrying the corresponding constructs were cultured at 28°C to approximately OD600 = 1. The bacterial cells were spun down and resuspended with MES buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 μm acetosyringone, pH 5.6) to OD600 = 0.4. In cases where two bacterial cultures were used, both bacterial cultures were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with OD600 = 0.4 for each. Then the bacterial suspension was incubated at 28°C with mild agitation for 1–2 h. Tobacco plants (N. benthamiana) were grown for 3–4 weeks at 22°C with a light regime of 16-h light/8-h dark and a relative humidity of 75%. The agroinfiltration of the tobacco leaf epidermal cells and transient expression of the fusion proteins were performed as described (Sparkes et al., CITATION). Two days later, the leaf samples were collected and the fluorescent proteins expressed in the abaxial epidermal cells were observed using a Nikon C1 Spectral Imaging Confocal Microscope (http://www.nikon.com/) with a 20 × objective lens. Images were obtained with the accompanying EZ-C1 acquisition and analysis software. For BiFC studies, the UGT72E1 and SIS8 full-length coding sequences were cloned into pUC-SPYCEG and pUC-SPYNEG (Walter et al., CITATION) to make constructs pUC-SPYCE–UGT72E1 and pUC-SPYNE–SIS8, respectively. Both constructs were co-transformed into tobacco leaf cells as described above for the subcellular localization experiment. Co-transformation of pUC-SPYCE–bZIP63 and pUC-SPYNE–bZIP63 into tobacco leaves was conducted as a positive control.
