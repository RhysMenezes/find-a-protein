!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-like (ADS) gene family contains nine genes encoding fatty acid desaturase-like proteins. The biological function of only one member of the family, fatty acid desaturase5 (AtADS3/FAD5, At3g15850), is known, and this gene encodes the plastidic palmitoyl-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Δ7 desaturase. We cloned seven members of the gene family that are predicted not to have a chloroplast transit peptide and expressed them in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All seven have previously undescribed desaturase activity on very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) substrates and exhibit diverse regiospecificity, catalyzing introduction of double bonds relative to the methyl end of the molecule (n-x) at n-6 (AtADS4, At1g06350), n-7 (AtADS1.3, At1g06100 and AtADS4.2, At1g06360), n-9 (AtADS1, At1g06080 and AtADS2, At2g31360) or Δ9 (relative to the carboxyl end of the molecule) positions (AtADS1.2, At1g06090 and AtADS1.4, At1g06120). Through forward and reverse genetics it was shown that AtADS2 is involved in the synthesis of the 24:1(n-9) and 26:1(n-9) components (X:Y, where X is chain length and Y is number of double bonds) of seed lipids, sphingolipids, and the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Plants deficient in AtADS2 expression showed no obvious phenotype when grown under normal growing conditions, but showed an almost complete loss of phosphatidylethanolamine(42:4), phosphatidylserine(42:4), dihydroxy-monohexosylceramide(42:2)-2, trihydroxy-monohexosylceramide(42:2)-3, and trihydroxy-glycosylinositolphosphoceramide(42:2)-3, lipid species that contain the VLCFA 24:1(n-9), and trihydroxy-glycosylinositolphosphoceramide(44:2)-3, a lipid containing 26:1(n-9). Acyl-CoA profiling of these plants revealed a major reduction in 24:1-CoA and a small reduction in 26:1-CoA. Overexpression of AtADS2 resulted in a substantial increase in the percentage of glycerolipid and sphingolipids species containing 24:1 and a dramatic increase in the percentage of very-long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in the acyl-CoA pool. Plants deficient in AtADS1 expression had reduced levels of 26:1(n-9) in seed lipids, but no significant changes in leaf phospholipids or sphingolipids were observed. These findings indicate that the 24-carbon and 26-carbon monounsaturated VLCFAs of Arabidopsis result primarily from VLCFA desaturation, rather than by elongation of long chain monounsaturated fatty acids.
!~RES~! Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences (Fig. 1) showed that all of the Arabidopsis ADS proteins contained the putative Δ9 FAD-like conserved domain (cd03505; CITATION) featuring the His box motifs characteristic of fatty acid desaturases (CITATION; CITATION). Phylogenetic analysis (Supplemental Fig. S1; CITATION) indicated that AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 were the most highly conserved members of the ADS family with 89.6% amino acid identity, followed by AtADS4 and AtADS4.2 with 81.3% identity. AtADS1 and AtADS2 shared 75.9% identity. All ADS proteins are designated as multipass membrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (http://uniprot.org). A search for potential hydrophobic membrane spanning regions using on-line analysis tools including TMHMM and PredictProtein (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0 and www.predictprotein.org) gave a consensus of four major transmembrane helices in each protein (Fig. 1) with both N and C termini located in the cytosol. None of the seven proteins contained a putative plastid transit peptide, and a search for ER localization signals using SignalP version 4.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP; CITATION) did not reveal any obvious signal peptides. AtADS1 and AtADS2 appeared to contain a putative di-Arg (-RXR-) ER retention/retrieval motif (CITATION) close to the C terminus. In the other five ADS proteins this motif was replaced with Lys (-KXK-) residues. [[FIGURE]] To examine the subcellular localization of AtADS1 and AtADS2, proteins were transiently expressed as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-fusions in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves using Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration. Examination of leaves by confocal microscopy revealed very low level diffuse YFP florescence when YFP was fused to the N terminus of either AtADS1 or AtADS2 (data not shown). Fusion proteins composed of YFP fused at the C terminus (Fig. 2) colocalized with the ER membrane marker CD3-953 (CITATION), suggesting that these proteins are components of the ER membrane system. [[FIGURE]] For characterization by expression in yeast, the ADS cDNAs were each cloned into an expression vector under control of a constitutive promoter. The vectors were used to transform a standard laboratory yeast strain YPH499 (Invitrogen). Analysis by gas chromatography (GC) of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) prepared from total yeast lipids revealed a small amount (less than 1%) of a fatty acid identified by GC-mass spectrometry (MS) to be a monounsaturated C26 fatty acid (26:1) in cells expressing AtADS2 (data not shown). All vectors were subsequently used to transform a second yeast line (Fat1Δ) that was known to accumulate VLCFAs. Cells transformed with each the seven different vectors all showed the accumulation of VLCFAs that were not present in cells transformed with the empty vector (Fig. 3). GC-MS conducted on the FAMEs confirmed that the new VLCFAs were monounsaturated and double-bond positions were determined by GC-MS of the dimethyl disulfide (DMDS)-FAME adducts [double bond nomenclature is given as Δx relative to the carboxyl end of the molecule, or (n-x) relative to the methyl end of the molecule; Fig. 4; Supplemental Fig. S2]. Yeast cells expressing AtADS1 produced 26:1(n-9) as the predominant new fatty acid, with a very low amount of 24:1(n-9) also detected. Cells expressing AtADS2 produced both 24:1(n-9) and 26:1(n-9). These results suggested n-9 desaturase activity for AtADS1 and AtADS2. The novel VLCMUFAs in cells expressing AtADS1.2 and AtADS1.4 were identified as 22:1(n-13), 24:1(n-15), and 26:1(n-17), suggesting that these enzymes were able to catalyze desaturation at the Δ9 position. The novel VLCFAs in cells expressing AtADS4.2 were 24:1(n-7) and 26:1(n-7), whereas those in cells expressing AtADS4 were 24:1(n-6) and 26:1(n-6), suggesting n-7 and n-6 desaturase activity for these enzymes, respectively. Desaturation at the n-7 position was also observed in cells expressing AtADS1.3. These results indicated that when expressed in yeast, the ADS proteins could catalyze the formation of VLCMUFAs. Mild saponification of yeast expressing AtADS2 indicated that the VLCMUFAs were largely associated with the glycerolipid/free fatty acid fraction and were not present in significant amounts in the yeast sphingolipids (Supplemental Fig. S3). No hydroxylated C24 or C26 VLCMUFAs were observed, and when FAMEs were prepared from yeast by base catalyzed transesterification, only very low levels of VLCFAs were observed, suggesting that these fatty acids were largely present as free fatty acids. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the Arabidopsis ADS proteins could catalyze the synthesis of VLCMUFAs in a plant, Arabidopsis plants were transformed with a vector containing either AtADS1 or AtADS2 under control of the seed specific Brassica napus napin promoter. Presence of the transgene cassette was verified by PCR and transformants (T1 generation) were grown to maturity. Seed fatty acid composition was determined by GC of FAMEs prepared from total seed lipids (T2 seed). In wild-type Arabidopsis, C24 fatty acids accounted for between 0.4% and 0.5% of total seed fatty acids, with 24:0 and 24:1 being present in approximately equal amounts. The C26 fatty acids were present at levels too low for accurate quantification. Plants expressing the AtADS1 or AtADS2 cDNAs appeared to show, on average, very similar total levels of C24 fatty acids to the wild type (Fig. 5A). The ratios of 24:1 to 24:0 in lines overexpressing AtADS2 were, however, dramatically changed compared with the wild-type lines (Fig. 5B; Supplemental Fig. S4), with 24:1 becoming the predominant C24 fatty acid. Lines overexpressing AtADS1 showed a smaller change in the ratio of C24 fatty acids, but for most lines there was a clear increase in 24:1 and a reduction in 24:0. Close scrutiny of fatty acid profiles showed that in many lines overexpressing AtADS1 or AtADS2, 26:1 levels also appeared to be increased, with a corresponding decrease in 26:0 (Fig. 5C). Fatty acids with chain length less than C24 were not significantly different between the lines (Table II). Arabidopsis plants were also transformed with a construct containing AtADS2 under control of the constitutive Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Expression of the transgene was verified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S5A). Analysis of seed fatty acid profiles showed changes in 24:0 and 24:1 levels similar to those when AtADS2 was expressed under control of the seed-specific promoter (Supplemental Fig. S5B). Seed fatty acid composition of line 13, used for further study, is given in Table II. [[FIGURE]] Data are presented as percentage ± sd (n = 5). Wild-type plants (Columbia-0) and OE lines were grown together, but in separate pots. The ads T-DNA insertion lines and wild-type 2 plants (also Columbia-0) were grown as mixed plants in randomized pots to reduce the effect of pot-to-pot variation. To examine the role of AtADS1 and AtADS2 by a reverse genetics approach, transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion lines (Fig. 6a) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Homozygous plants were identified by PCR (Supplemental Fig. S6A) and T-DNA insertion positions were verified by sequencing. For ads1-1 (SALK_044895C), the T-DNA insertion position was approximately 1,143 bp downstream of the start codon, and was located in the second intron. The second allele, ads1-2 (SALK_073508C), appeared to contain a concatemeric T-DNA insert in the fifth exon between 2,348 and 2,400 bp downstream of the start codon. Two of the three ads2 alleles also appeared to contain reversed concatemeric T-DNA insertions, allowing PCR products to be generated using the LBb1.3 primer and gene-specific primers designed to bind on either side of the T-DNA insertion site (reverse and forward primers). For ads2-1 (SALK_016783), the insertion site was located at approximately 1,060 bp downstream of the start codon, in the fourth intron. The ads2-2 (SALK_079963) allele contained an insertion toward the end of the third exon, between 811 and 831 bp downstream of the start codon. Insertion allele ads2-2 (SALK_056540) contained a T-DNA insertion in the 3′ untranslated region approximately 209 bp downstream of the stop codon. To determine whether the T-DNA insertion lines lacked ADS transcript of the correct length, RT-PCR was conducted using cDNA generated from seedling leaf total RNA (Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S6B). Both AtADS1 and AtADS2 could be amplified from cDNA prepared from wild-type material, indicating that the genes were expressed in this tissue under normal growing conditions. Using primer pairs designed to amplify the entire coding region, no AtADS1 transcript was detected in the two ads1 T-DNA insertion lines, ads1-1 and ads1-2. Similarly, AtADS2 transcript could not be detected in plants homozygous for the ads2-1 and ads2-2 alleles. Results indicated that the ads2-3 allele was not a knockout allele because transcript was easily detected in the homozygous plants. In RT-PCR, using primer pairs that preceded the T-DNA insertion sites, a fragment could be amplified from all of the ads2 alleles, but no significant product was observed in the ads1 alleles (Supplemental Fig. S6B). To further characterize the ads2 alleles we therefore conducted northern-blot analysis using RNA extracted from plants homozygous for the individual ads2 alleles (Fig. 6C). Results indicated that transcript was not present at significant levels in the ads2-1 and ads2-2 alleles and also suggested that AtADS2 transcript level in the ads2-3 plants was likely higher than in wild-type plants. No obvious growth phenotype was seen for the T-DNA insertion lines when grown under continuous light at 23°C. We observed overall size and appearance of the plants, and also time to flowering and maturity. [[FIGURE]] Plants homozygous for each mutant allele were grown to maturity and seed fatty acid composition was determined (Table II). As shown in detail in Figure 7B, ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants had lower levels of 24:1 in their seeds compared with control lines, with 24:0 being the predominant C24 fatty acid. Seeds from ads2-3 plants appeared to have slightly increased 24:1 levels. Examination of the ads1-1 and ads1-2 lines showed little difference in the levels or ratios of 24:0 and 24:1 compared with wild-type lines. Small differences were, however, observed in the C26 fatty acids (Fig. 7A) with the mutant lines and a change in the ratio of 26:0 and 26:1 was evident, with 26:0 becoming the predominant C26 fatty acid. Other seed fatty acids were not significantly different between the lines, with the exception of 18:1Δ9 in ads1-1, which showed a slight increase compared with the wild type. These results further implicated AtADS2 and AtADS1 in the synthesis of C24 and C26 monounsaturated fatty acids in the seed. [[FIGURE]] For a comparative examination of Arabidopsis leaf lipids, quantitative lipidomic analysis was conducted on total lipid extracts prepared from young rosettes. Data were collected from two separate sets of plants grown at different times. Although in experiment 1 lipids were extracted using a protocol not optimized for sphingolipid extraction, this lipid class was detected in significant amounts and data were collected and are presented. Comparison of the phospholipid molecular species in wild-type and experimental lines, within data from experiment 1, revealed significant differences in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidyl-Ser (PS) species containing C24 VLCFAs in the ads2 T-DNA insertion lines and the ADS2 overexpression (OE) line (Fig. 8). No significant differences between the wild type and the ads1 T-DNA insertion lines were observed. Total PE content in wild-type plants was close to 5.2% of leaf phospholipids (equivalent to around 12.8 nmol mg–1 dry weight) with C42 PE molecular species totaling 0.13% and PE(42:2) and PE(42:3) being most abundant. The ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants contained PE(42:2) as the major C42 species (Fig. 8A), with significantly reduced levels of PE(42:3) and almost no PE(42:4). Compared with the wild type, the ads2-3 lines showed an increase in PE(42:3) and PE(42:4), with lower levels of PE(42:2). A dramatic increase in the more unsaturated C42 PE species was seen in the ADS2 OE line with PE(42:3) and PE(42:4) becoming the dominant molecular species. This line also showed a relative increase in C42 PE, with these species accounting for 0.35% of total leaf phospholipids and a slight decrease in C40 PE (0.059%–0.049%), corresponding to a reduction in PE(40:2) (Supplemental Fig. S7). A similar trend was seen when C42 PS species were examined (Fig. 8B; Supplemental Fig. S8). PS is a low abundance lipid in Arabidopsis leaf accounting for only 0.3% (or approximately 0.8 nmol mg–1 dry weight) of total leaf phospholipids in wild-type lines, with the dominant molecular species being PS(42:3) and PS(42:2). No significant increase in total PS content was seen in any of the lines examined, however the ads2-1 and ads2-2 lines showed significantly increased levels of PS(42:2) and an almost complete loss of PS(42:4). In the ads2-3 plants there was an increase in the relative amount of PS(42:4), and a corresponding decrease in percentage of PS(42:2). The AtADS2 OE line contained PS(42:4) as the dominant C42 PS species, with very much reduced PS(42:2) levels. PS composition of the ads1 T-DNA insertion lines resembled that of the wild-type plants. Data from the second experiment, comparing the wild type, ads2-1, and the ADS2 OE13 lines, showed similar trends. Changes in PS species that contain C26 fatty acid, PS(44:3) and PS(44:2), were observed (Supplemental Fig. S8), but due to the very low abundance of these lipids, significance could not be demonstrated. [[FIGURE]] Data were also collected for the major anionic and neutral sphingolipid classes, the glycosylinositolphosphoceramides (GIPCs) and monohexosylceramides (HexCers), respectively. Experiment 1 included the wild type, both ads1 alleles, three ads2 alleles, and the ADS2 OE13 line, whereas experiment 2 was limited to the wild type, ads2-1, and ADS2 OE13. Because the extraction procedure for experiment 1 was not optimized for sphingolipid recovery, we compared relative extraction of sphingolipids between the two experiments. Comparison revealed that substantial recovery of sphingolipids had been achieved in experiment 1 (Supplemental Table S1). HexCer, for example, was measured at 150 normalized signal mg–1 dry weight (approximately equivalent to 150 nmol mg–1 dry weight) in wild-type tissue in the first extraction, compared with 107 normalized signal mg–1 dry weight in experiment 2, and GIPC was 2.6 and 3.2 normalized signal mg–1 dry weight, respectively. As data from experiment 1 cannot be considered quantitative, particularly for the less easily extracted GIPCs, results are expressed as percentages for each lipid class. Results from the sphingolipid analysis revealed a dramatic difference in the composition of the C42 and C44 HexCers and GIPCs in the ads2 alleles and in the ADS2 OE line (Fig. 9). In contrast, the ads1 lines did not differ significantly from the wild type. For the trihydroxy C42 and C44 HexCer classes, the ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants showed a shift toward more saturated species with HexCer(42:2)-3 and HexCer(44:2)-3 being very much reduced, and HexCer(42:1)-3 and HexCer(44:1)-3 showing corresponding increases (Fig. 9A). The ads2-3 line had a composition similar to the wild-type plants but with a slightly higher percentage of (42:2)-3. ADS2 OE plants showed a shift toward a higher level of unsaturation with an increase in the percentage of (42:2)-3 species. Compared with the trihydroxy C42 and C44 HexCers, the dihydroxy species appeared enriched in fully saturated species. For the C42 HexCer, ads2-1 and ads2-2 showed an almost complete absence of (42:2)-2, a slight increase in (42:1)-2, and a substantial increase in (42:0)-2. The ads2-3 plants showed a slight increase in (42:2)-2, whereas in the over-expressing line HexCer (42:2)-2 was the most abundant lipid in the dihydroxy C42 class, comprising almost 2.5% of total HexCer compared with 1.2% in the wild type. The increase in saturated species was more obvious in the C44 HexCer class, with both (44:4)-2 and (44:1)-2 being reduced and (44:0)-2 increasing from close to 0.5% to over 1.2% in the ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants. For the GIPCs (Fig. 9B), the more abundant trihydroxy classes showed almost complete loss of (42:2)-3 and (44:2)-3 species and corresponding increases in (42:1)-3 and (44:1)-3 in the ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants. The ads2-3 and AtADS2 OE line both showed an increase in (42:2)-3 and (44:2)-3 and decrease in (42:1)-3 and (44:1)-3, with the changes being more pronounced in the AtADS2 OE line. Data from the less abundant dihydroxy GIPCs contained a large amount of variability. Clear trends in sphingolipid composition could be seen, but statistical significance could not be demonstrated. For the C42 dihydroxy GIPC class, a virtually complete loss of (42:2)-2 was seen in the ads2-1 and ads2-2 material. This was accompanied by a large increase in (42:0)-2. For the ADS2 OE line, a substantial increase in (42:2)-2 was seen. The trends seen in the data from experiment 1 were confirmed by data from the second experiment (Supplemental Fig. S9). OE, or loss of AtADS2 activity, clearly had a profound effect on the levels of C24 monounsaturated fatty acids in Arabidopsis leaf. [[FIGURE]] Lipidomic studies conducted on leaf glycerolipids and sphingolipids were complemented by acyl-CoA profiling (Fig. 10), using young rosettes collected 14 d after germination. In wild-type plants, acyl-CoAs with chain lengths from 14 to 30 carbons were detected, with 16:0-CoA (23%) and 18:3-CoA (20%) being the most abundant and saturated VLCFAs (VLCSFAs) dominating the VLCFA acyl-CoA profile. Although some variation was apparent in 16:0-CoA and 18:3-CoA, the most dramatic differences were observed in the VLCMUFAs with chain lengths of C22 to C30 (Fig. 10; Supplemental Fig. S10). These fatty acids were relatively minor components of the acyl-CoA pool in wild-type material, each present at levels of around 1% or less. Compared with the wild-type control, the AtADS2 OE line showed a 12-fold increase in 24:1-CoA, with levels approaching 9% of total measured leaf acyl-CoAs. A 10-fold increase in 26:1-CoA and increases in 28:1-CoA and 30:1-CoA of 4- and 3-fold, respectively, were also seen. The percentage of 22:1, below 0.1% in the wild type, was also increased in this line. The percentage of VLCSFAs in the OE line showed little correlation to the pattern observed in the VLCMUFA profile, with only 24:0 showing a modest but significant reduction. Examination of the VLCMUFA composition of the acyl-CoAs from the ads2 T-DNA insertion lines (enlarged in Supplemental Fig. S10) showed no significant change in the percentage of 22:1-CoA or 30:1-CoA. Levels of 26:1 and 28:1 were slightly reduced, compared with the wild type, in the ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants, but not in the ads2-3 line. Percentage of 24:1-CoA in the ads2-1 and ads2-2 plants was reduced from 0.7% to 0.09% and 0.06%, respectively, whereas in the ads2-3 plants the average 24:1-CoA content was increased to 1.2%. In this study, the ads2-2 plants appeared to show a small increase in levels of saturated VLCFA-CoAs when compared with the other lines. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Vectors encoding AtADS1 (C00120), AtADS1.3 (U62926), AtADS2 (U10113), and AtADS4.2 (C00098) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://abrc.osu.edu/). After sequencing to verify identity, cDNAs were cloned individually into the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression vector pHVX2 (CITATION), under control of the constitutive promoter PGK1, to create vectors pMS686 (AtADS1), pMD6 (AtADS1.3), pMD5 (AtADS2), and pMD7 (AtADS4.2). To clone the three remaining genes, total RNA extracted from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots grown in liquid medium was used as a template to synthesize cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer. Sequences encoding AtADS1.2, AtADS1.4, and AtADS4 were amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene), and resulting products were cloned into vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) using the TOPO cloning system. Primer pairs used for PCR amplification were: ADS12B-FP and ADS12B-RP (AtADS1.2); ADS14B-FP and ADS14B-RP (AtADS1.4); and ADS4B-FP and ADS4B-RP (AtADS4). Primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table S3). After sequencing, the AtADS cDNAs were cloned into the yeast expression vector pHVX2 to give vectors pMD104 (AtADS1.2), pMD105 (AtADS1.4), and pMD106 (AtADS4). To prepare the ADS cDNAs for transient expression in N. benthamiana, PCR products were prepared using primer pairs ADS1-LoF and ADS1-LoR or ADS1-LoF and ADS1-LoNSR with ADS1 cDNA as a template, and primer pairs ADS2-LoF and ADS2-LoR or ADS2-LoF and ADS2-LoNSR with ADS2 cDNA as a template. Primer sequences are given in Supplemental Table S3. PCR products were cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and the resulting plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. The ADS coding regions were then transferred to pEarleygate 101 or 104 (CITATION) by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) to produce YFP fusion proteins tagged at the C or N termini. N. benthamiana plants were grown in a growth chamber at 22°C (day) and 16°C (night) with a minimum of 16 h of light. Cells from individual overnight cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the localization vectors were washed with sterile 20 mm MgSO4 and suspended in an equal volume of infiltration buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm MgSO4, and 100 mm acetosyringone, pH 5.2) followed by incubation at 28°C with shaking for 3 h. Cultures were mixed 1:1 with similarly prepared cultures containing the construct 35S:p19 to provide coexpression of the Tomato bushy stunt virus p19 protein, which suppressed gene silencing (CITATION). The culture mixtures were infiltrated into young, nearly expanded N. benthamiana leaves (CITATION) using a plastic 1-mL syringe. Transient expression of the cyan fluorescent protein-tagged ER marker CD3-953 (CITATION) was also conducted. After infiltration the infiltrated leaves were marked and the plants were left at room temperature for 1 h, after which they were returned to the growth chamber before imaging. At time intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h after infiltration, the abaxial leaf surface was imaged by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM510 Meta; Carl Zeiss) using HCX APO L 20×/0.5 and 63×/0.9 water-dipping lenses. The excitation lines of an argon ion laser were used alternately with line switching, using the multitrack facility. Signal for YFP was obtained with 514-nm excitation with HFT 405/514, NFT 515, and BP 530–600 filters. The cyan fluorescent protein signal was obtained with 458-nm excitation with HFT 485 and BP 475–525 filters. The yeast strain FAT1Δ (BY4741; MATa; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0; YBR041w::kanMX4) was obtained from Invitrogen. Transformation of yeast cells was conducted as described in the manual of the pYES2.1 TOPO TA Expression Kit (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected in minimal medium without leonine. For analysis of yeast total cellular fatty acids, cells from 5-mL liquid cultures grown for 18 h at 28°C were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 mL of 3 m HCl in methanol (Supelco) with 300 μL of hexane in screw-top Pyrex tubes. The tubes were tightly capped and heated at 80°C for 2 h. After cooling, 2 mL of 0.9% NaCl was added to each tube and FAMEs were recovered by collecting the hexane fraction. FAMEs were separated by GC using an Agilent 6890N GC equipped with a DB-23 capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m, 0.25 mm thickness; J&W Scientific) and flame ionization detector. Double-bond position in the monounsaturated fatty acids was determined by GC-MS following conversion of FAMEs to their DMDS adducts using a method adapted from CITATION. The DMDS-FAMEs were separated on a DB-5 capillary column using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973N mass selective detector. For mild saponification, pelleted yeast cells were resuspended in 4 mL of freshly prepared 1% KOH in methanol and heated at 80°C for 1 h. After neutralization with HCl, the suspension was extracted with hexane and the cells were collected by centrifugation. FAMEs were prepared from the unsaponified lipids by resuspending the pellet in 2 mL of 3 m HCl in methanol, with heating at 80°C for 2 h. To confirm the presence and location of the T-DNA insertion, genomic DNA was extracted from young rosette leaves by grinding in extraction buffer (200 mm Tris HCl, pH7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS). After centrifugation to remove leaf material, genomic DNA was precipitated from the supernatant using an equal volume of isopropanol and PCR was conducted using the primer pairs described in Supplemental Figure S5. PCR products were directly sequenced (ABI 3730) to identify the location of the T-DNA insertion. To determine transcript presence or absence in the T-DNA insertion lines, seeds were geminated on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium and grown to 4–5 leaf stage at 24°C under a 16 h photoperiod. Leaf RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). For each plant, PCR was conducted using the primer pairs described in Figure 6. To examine the expression of ADS2 in putative knockout lines by northern blot, the entire inflorescence was removed from wild-type and homozygous ads2 T-DNA insertion plants. Material was ground in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant kit. RNA was separated on an agarose gel and transferred to Hybond C membrane by capillary blotting. For hybridization, a P32-labeled DNA probe was synthesized by random priming using the coding region of ADS2, generated using primers ADS2NFP and ADS2NRP, as a template using standard procedures. To assemble binary vectors for Arabidopsis transformation, the coding regions of AtADS1 and AtADS2 were amplified by PCR from vectors C00120 and U10113, respectively. PCR primer pairs were ADS1-5X and ADS1-3Sac (AtADS1) and ADS2-5X and ADS2-3Sac (AtADS2; Supplemental Table S3). After restriction digest, the PCR products were cloned into the vector pBI121 (Clontech) to create vectors pMD12 (CaMV 35S-AtADS1-nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator) and pMD13 (CaMV 35S-AtADS2-NOS terminator), or pSE129 (pRD400 containing the napin promoter and NOS terminator within the T-DNA borders) to create vectors pMD123 (napin-AtADS1-NOS) and pMD124 (napin-AtADS2-NOS). The binary vectors were used for the A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia-0) using the floral dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected by resistance to kanamycin and grown to maturity in soil at 23°C with constant light (100 μE m–2 s–1). To determine seed fatty acid composition, samples of approximately 100 seeds from each plant were placed in Pyrex tubes with 2 mL of 1 m HCl in methanol and 300 μL of hexane. Capped tubes were heated at 80°C for 2 h, and FAMEs were recovered by collecting the hexane phase after addition of 2 mL of 0.9% NaCl to the cooled tubes. FAMEs were separated by GC as described for yeast fatty acid analysis. To collect material for lipidomic analysis, Arabidopsis seeds were planted directly into soil (Sunshine Mix #3; Sun Gro Horticulture) and grown for 25 d in constant light (approximately 100 μE m−2 s−1 at pot level) under the same conditions as described for the OE lines above. For experiment 1, lipid extraction was conducted according to the method of CITATION. Three plants for each line were removed by cutting just below the rosette leaves, and were immediately immersed in 3 mL of isopropanol containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene, preheated to 75°C. After incubation for 15 min, 1.5 mL of chloroform and 0.6 mL of water were added to each tube and samples were shaken at 22°C for 1 h. Lipid extracts were transferred to clean Pyrex tubes and five additional extractions were carried out, using 4 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1) with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene each time. For each sample, the combined lipid fractions were further extracted using 1 mL of 1 m KCl and 2 mL of water, then dried under hexane and shipped on dry ice for analysis. Extracted leaf tissue was dried overnight at 105°C before weighing. The lipid profile data were acquired at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center (http://www.k-state.edu/lipid/lipidomics/), using electrospray ionization tandem MS. Instrument acquisition and method development at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center was supported by National Science Foundation grants MCB 0455318, MCB 0920663, and DBI 0521587, the Kansas Idea Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (National Institutes of Health grant no. P20 RR16475 from the Idea Network of Biomedical Research Excellence program of the National Center for Research Resources), National Science Foundation Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research grant no. EPS–0236913, Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation, and Kansas State University. For experiment 2, plants were grown as described above, and lipids were extracted using the Plant Bligh-Dyer-Solvent H protocol (Supplemental File S1) for thorough extraction of sphingolipids. Data sets were subjected to Q-test analysis to detect discordant data points, as recommended by the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center (http://k-state.edu/lipid/lipidomics/Q-test.htm). To obtain plant tissue for analysis, seeds were surface sterilized, stratified for 3 d in a cold room, and plated on square plates containing one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in 0.9% (w/v) phytagel. Seeds were germinated and grown in a controlled environment cabinet with a photoperiod of 16 h of light (150 µE m−2 s−1) at 22°C and 8 h of dark at 18°C. Seedlings were grown for 14 d and the rosettes, with roots removed, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until further analyses. Samples were extracted according to the method described by CITATION and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem MS with multiple reaction monitoring, operated in positive mode, essentially following the method described by CITATION. Liquid chromatography separation was conducted using an Agilent 1200 LC system equipped with a Gemini C18 column (2 mm i.d., 150 mm in length, with 5-mm particles) and MS was performed using an AB4000 QTRAP (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer (spray voltage set to 5 kV, nebulizing gas at 40 pounds per square inch [p.s.i.], focusing gas at 40 p.s.i., and curtain gas at 20 p.s.i.). The source temperature was held at 750°C. Declustering potential and collision energy were optimized on a compound-dependent basis. The acyl-CoAs were identified via multiple reaction monitoring and precursor-product ion pairs of specific acyl-CoAs were followed; for example, 24:0-CoA was monitored by the precursor-product ion pair of mass-to-charge ratio 1,118.5 and 611.36, and 24:1-CoA by the precursor-product ion pair of mass-to-charge ratio 1,116.5 and 609.5. For the purpose of identification and calibration, standard acyl-CoA esters with acyl chain lengths from C14 to C20 were purchased from Sigma as free acids or lithium salts.
