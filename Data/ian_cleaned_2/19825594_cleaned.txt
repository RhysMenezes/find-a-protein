!~ABS~! Four members of the tandem-pore potassium channel family of Arabidopsis thaliana (TPK1, 2, 3, and 5) reside in the vacuolar membrane, whereas TPK4 is a plasma membrane K + -channel. By constructing chimeras between TPK1 and TPK4, we attempted to identify channel domains involved in the trafficking process and found that the TPK1 cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CT) is critical for the ER-as well as Golgi-sorting steps. Following site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a diacidic motif (DLE) required for ER-export of TPK1. However, this diacidic motif in the C-terminus is not conserved among other members of the TPK family, and TPK3 sorting is independent of its CT. Moreover, the 14-3-3 binding site of TPK1, essential for channel activation, is not involved in channel sorting.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis potassium channel TPK1 localizes to the vacuolar membrane ( CITATION ; CITATION ). Vacuolar targeting of TPK1 might rely on Golgi-dependent sorting steps or, as reported for the PSV trafficking of α-TIP, could occur along a Golgi-independent route ( CITATION ). To distinguish between these routes, we applied the fungal toxin Brefeldin A, which inhibits secretion and causes redistribution of Golgi membranes ( CITATION ). Under control conditions, in cells co-expressing TPK1-mRFP1 and the Golgi-Marker (ST-GFP), in the absence of Brefeldin A, TPK1 channels were observed at the vacuolar membrane while ST-GFP exhibited Golgi staining ( CITATION ). Upon incubation with Brefeldin A, the Golgi-marker redistributed into an ER-like compartment throughout the cell. Similarly, Golgi-apparatus disruption prevented vacuolar trafficking of TPK1 resulting in co-localization with the Golgi-marker ( CITATION ). This indicates that vacuolar targeting of TPK1 occurs via Golgi-dependent sorting machinery. The animal TPK channel KCNK3 possesses a 14-3-3 binding and a basic motif, which are involved in ER-release and surface expression of this membrane protein. Similar motifs are found in Arabidopsis TPK1, both of which are located in close proximity within the cytoplasmic N-terminus (RKRRLR RSRS p AP : the type I 14-3-3-binding motif is underlined). To test whether 14-3-3-mediated ER-release might represent a mechanism allowing forward trafficking of TPK1 in planta, we silenced the respective phosphorylation site (Ser-42) within the TPK1 14-3-3 binding motif (RSR S p AP). Mutating Ser-42 to alanine (TPK1-S42A) prevented 14-3-3 binding in vitro ( CITATION ), but not vacuolar targeting of TPK1 ( CITATION ). Likewise, mimicking phosphorylation by exchanging Ser-42 for glutamate (TPK1-S42E) did not affect vacuolar localization of TPK1 ( CITATION ). Thus, 14-3-3 binding, which regulates channel gating ( CITATION ), seems not to be involved in targeting of TPK1 to the vacuole. The generation of chimeras between structurally and functionally related proteins exhibiting different sub-cellular localization has been used to study molecular determinants important for trafficking ( CITATION ; CITATION ; CITATION CITATION ; CITATION ; CITATION ). Based on individual channel fusions with GFP, we confirmed the localization of TPK1, 2, 3, and 5 at the vacuolar membrane as well as TPK4 expression in the plasma membrane ( CITATION ). The number of TPK4 channels targeted to the plasma membrane seemed to be strictly controlled, however, since a large fraction of TPK4 was found to be localized in the ER. Longer incubation after transformation did not result in enhanced export to the plasma membrane. TPK1 and TPK4 share 35% amino acid identity in the region of TMD 1–4. Their cytoplasmic domains, in contrast, show little sequence conservation (5% identity in the amino terminus). We exchanged the amino-(NT) and the carboxy-termini (CT) between TPK1 and TPK4 and determined the sub-cellular localization of the resulting chimeric proteins. Supporting our observation that the 14-3-3 motif of TPK1 is not required for vacuolar targeting, TPK1 possessing the NT of TPK4 still trafficked to the tonoplast ( CITATION ). We thus concluded that the NT of TPK1 is not necessary for vacuolar targeting of TPK1, nor is the TPK4 NT sufficient to redirect TPK1 targeting. Consequently, no dominant targeting motifs seem to be present in the NT of TPK1 and TPK4. We then exchanged the CT of TPK1 with the CT of TPK4. TPK1-TPK4CT was found in the ER, but was no longer present in the tonoplast ( CITATION ). Conversely, the TPK1 CT did not cause redirection of TPK4-TPK1CT to the vacuole ( CITATION ). These observations indicate that the TPK1 CT might be required, but is not sufficient for vacuolar targeting. In addition to switching cytoplasmic domains, we also generated TPK1/4 chimeras, which comprised the N-terminus, the first pore, and the internal cytoplasmic loop of one channel fused to the second pore and cytoplasmic C-terminus of the other channel. Following transient expression, both chimeras accumulated in the ER network ( CITATION ), confirming that the TPK1 CT is not sufficient for vacuolar localization. At this point, we cannot exclude the possibility that the TPK1/4 chimeric channels are retained in the ER by other means than the missing targeting information of the TPK1 CT. To test whether the TPK1 CT actually contains targeting signals and to identify them, we dissected the C-terminus of TPK1 by a series of truncations. According to the consensus transmembrane prediction for TPK channels ( CITATION ), the cytoplasmic CT of TPK1 initiates at amino acid position 271, C-terminal to TMD4, and extents to amino acid position 363 ( CITATION ). TPK1 also contains two EF-hands in this region that exhibit structural homology to the neuronal Ca 2+ -binding protein calcineurin. Taking advantage of the crystal structures of calcineurin in complex with FKBP12 and FK506 ( CITATION ), we generated a homology model highlighting the helix-loop-helix structure (H-L-H) of this domain ( CITATION ). Based on this model, we generated deletion mutants, which were named according to the position of their end point relative to the helices and bridging loops (H1-L1-H2 for EF-hand I, L2 for the connecting loop, H3-L3-H4 for EF-hand II). The first construct investigated was the TPK1-ΔCT mutant lacking the entire cytoplasmic CT ( CITATION CITATION ΔCT). This mutant as well as TPK1-ΔH1 ( CITATION and CITATION ) exhibited persistent ER retention. In a search for ER escape motifs, we gradually increased the length of TPK1 carboxy terminus (CT) relative to TMD4. When we extended the TPK1 CT to include helix H1 (TPK1-ΔL1), TPK1 escaped from the ER 16 h following transformation and partially entered Golgi stacks ( CITATION ). Compared to full-length TPK1, however, trafficking of TPK1-ΔL1 was considerably slower ( CITATION ). After extending the CT to include H1-L1 (TPK1-ΔH2), ER export appeared accelerated and, 24 h following transformation, mutant channels appeared in the vacuolar membrane ( CITATION CITATION ΔH2). This suggests that either L1 contains vacuolar-sorting information or that vacuolar localization is simply a consequence of accelerated ER-to-Golgi transport. Interestingly, the TPK1 mutants ΔL2 and ΔH3, possessing the entire EF-hand I, seemed to have lost vacuolar targeting information again and appeared almost exclusively in the Golgi when recorded 24 h following transformation ( CITATION and CITATION ). About 43 h later, however, those channels also reached the vacuole, indicating delayed Golgi sorting ( CITATION ). Finally, when appending helix H3 (TPK1-ΔL3) or extending the TPK1 CT beyond this region (TPK1-ΔH4), all truncated mutants showed wild-type-like targeting to the vacuolar membrane ( CITATION CITATION and CITATION ). Based on our findings on TPK1 targeting, the minimal requirement for ER-export of the channel is H1, and, for further export into the Golgi, L1 is necessary. Notably, both domains are missing in TPK4 ( CITATION ), which is largely retained in the ER. We therefore looked for known sorting motifs within the H1-L1 region and identified three diacidic motifs (292-ITNN DLE AA DLDED GVV-308, underlined). While the first diacidic motif (DAI) is located within H1 ( CITATION ), DAII and DAIII comprise part of the L1 loop in the C-terminus of TPK1. To test whether one of these diacidic motifs plays a role in ER-export of TPK1, we replaced the respective acidic amino acids by glycines. Mutations in DAII and III did not affect vacuolar trafficking of TPK1 ( CITATION and CITATION DAII+III). In contrast, the DAI mutation of TPK1 resulted in full ER-retention ( CITATION and CITATION DAI), supporting the idea that a diacidic motif is required for the ER export of TPK1. Interestingly, plant TPK1 orthologs from potato or rice, for example, carry a similar DLE-motif within an EF-hand, suggesting a common principle in the ER-export of these channels. On the contrary, the Arabidopsis paralogues of TPK1 lack such a diacidic motif in their respective C-terminal H1 domain ( CITATION vertical box) suggesting that these channels either use different signals for selective ER export or leave the ER by bulk-flow. In the course of these experiments, we tested the importance of the TPK3 CT in vacuolar trafficking of this ubiquitously expressed member of the TPK family. In these studies, we observed that TPK3ΔCT, in contrast to TPK1ΔCT, could be effectively transported to the vacuolar membrane ( CITATION ). Due to the lack of unambiguous CT sorting motifs in TPK3, we focused on the role of TMDs, since TMDs have already been shown to bear ER-retention motifs or physical sorting information ( CITATION ; CITATION ; CITATION ; CITATION ; CITATION ). In order to test whether TMD-located signals are involved in vacuolar sorting, the last transmembrane domain of either TPK1 or TPK3 was fused to mRFP1. The TPK1-TMD4 construct, comprising aa 217–273, exhibited mainly localization in the ER up to 43 h post transformation. This is in contrast to the ER/Golgi-marker ERD2-GFP, which intensely stains the Golgi ( CITATION ). Similar to ERD2, the TPK3-TMD4 construct, composed of aa 292–353, accumulated in the Golgi ( CITATION ). To investigate whether the TPK1 CT possessing the diacidic motif would promote the ER-export of TPK1-TMD4, we extended this construct to cover aa 217–363. ER-export of the corresponding mRFP1 fusion protein, however, was still hampered resulting in ER retention of TPK1-TMD4-CT ( CITATION ).
!~MM~! Cloning of TPK1-TPK5 was described previously ( CITATION ; CITATION ). TPK1 carboxy-terminal deletion-mutants were generated using PCR amplification with TPK1s and the following anti-sense primers: ΔCTas = aa 1–273; ΔH1as = aa 1–284; ΔL1as = aa 1–299; ΔH2as = aa 1–308; ΔL2as = aa 1–321; ΔH3as = aa 1–327; ΔL3as = aa 1–338; ΔH4as = aa 1–343. All the oligonucleotide-sequences can be retrieved from CITATION . The PCR-products were then TOPO-ligated into pCRII-TOPO ® (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and subsequently inserted N-terminally in frame with either mRFP1 ( CITATION ) or mGFP4 ( CITATION ) into pPILY ( CITATION ) using Cfr9I and Eco47III/KspAI. All site-directed mutagenesis reactions were performed using either Pfu-Turbo ® (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) or Phusion™ (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) as DNA-polymerases. The NT-chimeras TPK1-TPK4NT::mGFP4 /pPILY was generated by introducing an EcoRI recognition upstream of the sequence encoding the first trans-membrane domain of TPK1 and TPK4 using site-directed mutagenesis with TPK1::mGFP4 /pPILY and TPK4::mGFP4 /pPILY as template and TPK1-EcoRIs, TPK4-EcoRIs and the complementary oligonucleotides as primers. The TPK1 NT was then replaced by TPK4 NT using the restriction sites for Cfr9I and EcoRI. The CT-Chimeras TPK1-TPK4CT::mGFP4 /pPILY and TPK4-TPK1CT::mGFP4 /pPILY were obtained by introducing KspAI recognition site C-terminally of the last TMD of TPK4 by site-directed mutagenesis of TPK4 /pcDNA3.1D-V5-His-TOPO using TPK4-KspAIs and the complementary anti-sense primer. TPK1ΔCT was then introduced via the restriction sites for Bam HI and Ksp AI from TPK1ΔCT /pCRII-TOPO. In order to introduce TPK1CT into TPK4-KspAI /pcDNA3.1D, the TPK1CT was PCR amplified using TPK1CTs and TPK1as, TOPO-ligated into pCRII-TOPO ® and then transferred via Ksp AI and Apa I. Finally, these chimeric coding sequences were ligated into mGFP4 /pPILY via Cfr9 I and Eco47 III. The pore-chimeras, TPK4P1-TPK1P2 and TPK1P1–TPK4P2, were created by PCR amplification of either the channel part N-terminally or C-terminally of TMD3 using TPK1sense and TPK1-TMD3as (TPK1-P1), TPK1-TMD3s and TPK1as (TPK1-P2), TPK4s and TPK4-TMD3as (TPK4-P1), TPK4-TMD3s and TPK4as (TPK4-P2) as primers. The P1-PCR products were TOPO-cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO ® (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and P2-PCR products into pCRII-TOPO ® . The channel fragments were combined using Xho I and Eco RI within TPKx-P1 /pcDNA3.1D-V5-His-TOPO ® and finally ligated into mGFP4 /pPILY via Bam HI and Eco47 III. The TPK1 S42A, S42E mutations were introduced as described elsewhere ( CITATION ). The D296G-E298G (DAI) and D300G-D302G (DAII+III) mutants of TPK1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of TPK1::mGFP4 /pPILY with D296G–E298Gs, D300G–D302Gs and the complementary anti-sense primers. TPK3 without its CT was generated by PCR using TPK3s and TPK3CTas as primers. The PCR-product was TOPO-ligated into pCRII-TOPO ® and then ligated via Xba I and Ksp AI into mRFP1 /pPILY, which was opened with Xba I and Eco47 III. The vectors TPK1-TMD4 /pSAT6A-RFP-N1, TPK1-TMD4-CT /pSAT6A-RFP-N1, and TPK3-TMD4 /pSAT6A-RFP-N1 were obtained by PCR with TPK3P2ms and TPK3CTas for TPK3-TMD4 and TPK1P2ms and ΔCTas/TPK1as for TPK1-TMD4 / TPK1-TMD4+CT . The PCR products were TOPO-ligated into pCRII-TOPO ® and then recombined in frame with RFP in pSAT6A-RFP-N1 ( CITATION ). TPK1-TMD4 and TPK1TMD4-CT were cut out with Hin dIII and Ksp AI/ Eco47 III, TPK3-TMD4 with Hin dIII and Ksp AI and pSAT6A-RFP-N1 was opened with Sma I and Hin dIII. Onion epidermal cells were transfected by biolistic delivery of tungsten particles (tungsten M-17, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) coated with the respective DNA. The procedure is described elsewhere ( CITATION ). For co-bombardments of GFP and RFP vectors, equal amounts of DNA were used for precipitation. To confirm Golgi-dependent trafficking of AtTPK1, the onion epidermis was stripped off immediately after bombardment and incubated for 24 h on agar plates with and without 54 mM Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). After incubation, usually up to 43 h after bombardment, the epidermis was stripped off and placed in 0.3 M KNO 3 on a microscope slice. Cells were imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) under a 40× Plan-Apochromat water immersion or a 63× Plan-Neofluar oil immersion objective. For co-localization of RFP and GFP constructs, the pinhole was adjusted to one arbitrary unit and scanning was performed in multi-track mode. GFP fluorescence was measured using a 488-nm excitation wavelength and emission bandpath 505–530 nm, while RFP was excited at 543 nm and fluorescence emission was detected using a longpass filter LP560 nm. Images of CITATION and images (D), (E), and (F) of CITATION are horizontal projections of images with different focal planes. Images were not subjected to any image processing. As a marker for the endoplasmatic reticulum, we co-transfected an ER-retained GFP in the form of GFP:: Err /pMG (by B.G. Pickard); to stain ER/Golgi compartments, we used the Arabidopsis K/HDEL-receptor analogue ERD2 in the form of ERD2::GFP /pVKH18En6; and for Golgi-stacks alone, we used a derivative of the rat sialyl transferase (ST) in the form of STtmd:: RFP /pVKH18En6 ( CITATION ). Alignment and amino acid identity calculation was done using the free Multiple Sequence Alignment Editor and Shading Utility ‘Genedoc’ ( www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc ). Homology modeling of TPK1 CT was performed as described elsewhere.
