!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis RPM1 protein confers resistance to disease caused by Pseudomonas syringae strains delivering either the AvrRpm1 or AvrB type III effector proteins into host cells. We characterized two closely related RPM1-interacting proteins, RIN2 and RIN3. RIN2 and RIN3 encode RING-finger type ubiquitin ligases with six apparent transmembrane domains and an ubiquitin-binding CUE domain. RIN2 and RIN3 are orthologs of the mammalian autocrine motility factor receptor, a cytokine receptor localized in both plasma membrane caveolae and the endoplasmic reticulum. RIN2 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, as are RPM1 and RPS2. The C-terminal regions of RIN2 and RIN3, including the CUE domain, interact strongly with an RPM1 N-terminal fragment and weakly with a similar domain from the Arabidopsis RPS2 protein. RIN2 and RIN3 can dimerize through their C-terminal regions. The RING-finger domains of RIN2 and RIN3 encode ubiquitin ligases. Inoculation with P. syringae DC3000(avrRpm1) or P. syringae DC3000(avrRpt2) induces differential decreases of RIN2 mobility in SDS-PAGE and disappearance of the majority of RIN2. A rin2 rin3 double mutant expresses diminished RPM1- and RPS2-dependent hypersensitive response (HR), but no alteration of pathogen growth. Thus, the RIN2/RIN3 RING E3 ligases apparently act on a substrate that regulates RPM1- and RPS2-dependent HR.
!~RES~! We isolated RIN2 (RPM1 interacting protein 2; At4g25230) from a yeast two-hybrid screen using an RPM1 domain lacking the CC but containing most of the NB domain (amino acids 55–341; pEG10 in Figure 2; CITATION). Homology searches indicated that the Arabidopsis genome encodes another protein 83% identical to RIN2; we designated it RIN3 (At5g51450; Figure 1a). The deduced RIN2 and RIN3 proteins are 578 and 577 amino acid residues, respectively, and their estimated molecular weights are 64 567 and 64 516 Da, respectively. RIN2 and RIN3 each possess six probable transmembrane domains, a RING-finger domain and a CUE domain, recently implicated in ubiquitin binding (Figure 1b; CITATION; CITATION). RIN2 and RIN3 each contain a RING-finger consensus sequence composed of eight conserved cysteines and histidines that normally coordinate two zinc ions in a cross-braced fashion (Figure 1c). The RING-finger domains of RIN2 and RIN3 have a histidine at the fifth zinc-coordinating residue, indicative of the RING-H2 subclass reported to have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] RIN2 and RIN3 display significant similarity to mammalian autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) throughout the coding region, including the order and relative spacing of all domains (not shown). AMFR is a cell surface cytokine receptor (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Single-copy AMFR-like genes are present in many organisms including rice, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse and rat. Figure 1(d) presents a phylogenetic tree of AMFR-like genes. RIN2 and RIN3 showed higher similarity to a rice ortholog (approximately 48% identity) compared with the animal orthologs [identities are: human (AF124145) 23%, C. elegans (NM_060201) 23%, zebrafish (NM_213163) 22%, Xenopus (BC072063) 23%, mouse (NM_011787) 23%, rat (XM_341644) 21%]. The human HRD1 protein (AF317634), which functions in protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (CITATION), also has similarity to AMFR-like proteins in the transmembrane and RING-finger domains (Figure 1c), but lacks the CUE domain. We conducted further yeast two-hybrid assays to investigate the interactions between RIN2/RIN3 and RPM1. We generated seven RPM1 bait vectors containing different domains and combinations of domains (CC, NB and LRR; Figure 2a). We used only the C-terminal half of RIN2 (amino acids 329–578), including the RING-finger and CUE domains, to avoid complications in nuclear localization that might be caused by the probable transmembrane domains (Figure 2a). The C4 fragment of RIN2 (amino acids 419–578) is the fragment identified originally from the yeast two-hybrid screen with RPM1. The C9 fragment represents an alternatively spliced RIN2 cDNA that deletes only D561L562Q563, a tripeptide conserved in all AMFR orthologs. C9 was truncated in vitro at the N-terminus to match fragment C4 (Figure 1a). We also generated analogous bait and prey vectors from RIN3 termed RING-CUE (amino acids 329–577) and C4 (amino acids 419–577). An RPM1 N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–176; pEG7) exhibited the strongest interaction with the RIN2 RING-CUE and C4 domains, indicating that the C4 region is sufficient for interaction with RPM1 (Figure 2b). RPM1 fragments contained in pEG5, pEG8 and pEG10 exhibited weaker interactions than pEG7. Thus, the CC region of RPM1 contributes to, but is not sufficient for, efficient interaction with RIN2. The interactions of RIN3 with RPM1 were essentially the same as those of RIN2. We also defined the regions of RIN2 required for interaction with RPM1 (pEG7) (Figure 2c). The RING-CUE domain and the C4 truncation gave the strongest interactions, while RING or CUE domains alone did not. These results suggest a requirement for the region between the RING and CUE domains in the RIN2 interaction with RPM1. In addition, deletion of the D561L562Q563 sequence conserved in the CUE domain (construct C9) resulted in loss of interaction with RPM1. We tested whether the interaction of RIN2 with RPM1 was specific or could also be observed using similar domains from related NB-LRR proteins (Figure 2d). We tested RPS2 (CITATION; CITATION) and RPP5 (resistance to Peronospora parasitica isolate Noco2; CITATION; CITATION). RPS2 is a CC-NBS-LRR protein, as is RPM1. RPP5, by contrast, contains an N-terminal TIR domain (CITATION). RIN2 and RIN3 weakly interacted with RPS2, but not at all with RPP5, consistent with a requirement for the CC domain in this interaction. RIN2 and RIN3 can homo- and heterodimerize, and this was strongest when using the C4 domain from each (Figure 2e). The CUE domains alone could weakly bind C4, but not the RING-CUE domain. This indicates that sequences upstream of CUE in C4 are required for homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization. We used in vitro binding experiments to confirm the interaction between RIN2/RIN3 and RPM1. We produced epitope-tagged RPM1-c-myc protein using an in vitro transcription/translation system and a series of RIN2/RIN3 proteins fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (Figure 3a; see Experimental procedures). The RIN2 cDNA clone designated JG was also isolated during the initial two-hybrid screen as a splice variant that eliminates RIN2 residues 438–470 (data not shown). The GST-fused RIN2 proteins were bound to glutathione Sepharose 4B, washed and then incubated with RPM1-myc proteins (see Experimental procedures). The RING-CUE fragment of RIN2 interacted with full-length RPM1. Deletion of D561L562Q563 in this context resulted in weaker interaction (Figure 3b). The same results were obtained using a shorter RIN2 truncation (compare C4 with C9; Figure 3c). As expected from the two-hybrid results, the CUE domain of RIN2 alone did not interact with RPM1 (Figure 3c). Interestingly, the RIN2 splice variant (JG) exhibited enhanced binding to RPM1. RIN3 also bound to RPM1 in vitro (Figure 3d). [[FIGURE]] RING-finger domains typically act as E3 ubiquitin ligases (CITATION; CITATION). To address whether RIN2 and RIN3 have this activity, we constructed, expressed and incubated a series of GST–RIN2 fusions with wheat E1 enzyme, the Arabidopsis E2 enzyme AtUBC1 and His-tagged ubiquitin (Figure 4a; see Experimental procedures). These reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Ubiquitinated proteins were detected by protein blot analysis with anti-His antibody. As displayed in Figure 4(b), the RING domain of RIN2 indeed exhibited ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity was not inhibited by deletion of the D561L562Q563 sequence. Mutation of the highly conserved cysteine 337 (Figure 1c) to alanine resulted in loss of ubiquitin ligase activity (Figure 4b), as did removal of E1 or E2 from the ubiquitination reaction (data not shown). The CUE domain always gave a faint signal in repeated experiments, perhaps reflecting the reported ubiquitin-binding activity of this motif (CITATION; CITATION). RIN3 also had ubiquitin ligase activity, which was in fact much stronger than that of RIN2. We incubated RPM1-myc with the ubiquitination reaction mixtures containing RIN2 and/or RIN3. However, we failed to detect ubiquitination of RPM1 by either RIN2 or RIN3 (data not shown; see Discussion). [[FIGURE]] To analyze RIN2 localization, we produced transgenic plants expressing C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RIN2 driven by a 1.9 kb native RIN2 promoter. Total extract, and either crude soluble or microsomal membrane fractions derived from it, were prepared from wild-type Col-0 and transgenic RIN2-HA plants. Protein analysis with anti-HA antibody showed that RIN2 was localized in a membrane fraction (Figure 5a). A RIN2-HA doublet was consistently detected in the microsomal fraction, although we could see only one band in total extracts. This may be due to the different extraction conditions used for the total extract and the membrane fraction. RIN3 was similarly localized in the microsomal membrane fraction (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] RPM1 and RPS2 were previously localized as peripheral plasma membrane proteins (CITATION; CITATION). To analyze the subcellular localization of RIN2, microsomal membrane fractions were subjected to two-phase partitioning to enrich for plasma membrane vesicles (CITATION). Protein extracts from total microsomes, intracellular membrane vesicles and plasma membrane vesicles were subjected to protein blot analysis with antibodies for the HA epitope and various subcellular makers. As shown in Figure 5(b), AtPIP2 was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction and AtSEC12 and AtVAM3 were enriched in intracellular membrane fractions. RIN2-HA was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction, although it was detectable at low levels in intracellular membrane fractions. Thus, RIN2-HA is predominantly localized in the plasma membrane. RPM1 disappears at a time coincident with the onset of HR induced by avirulent Pto strains that trigger various NB-LRR proteins (Figure 6a; CITATION). We addressed whether RIN2 was altered after infection using total protein extracts prepared from leaves inoculated with Pto DC3000 carrying either avrRpm1 or avrRpt2. Inoculation with Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) caused RPM1-mediated HR at 4 hours post-inoculation (hpi). RIN2-HA exhibited reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE beginning at 1 hpi (Figure 6b). RIN2-HA levels declined at the onset of HR, but a further mobility reduction of the remaining RIN2-HA continued to 24 hpi. These data indicate that (i) the initial modification of RIN2-HA is rapid and precedes the disappearance of RPM1-myc, (ii) RPM1, and most of the RIN2, disappear coincident with HR and (iii) a small fraction of modified RIN2 remains post-HR. RPS2-dependent HR triggered by Pto DC3000(avrRpt2) was induced around 15 hpi in these experiments. RIN2-HA also disappeared at times coincident with RPS2-dependent HR, and the remaining RIN2-HA exhibited a slight mobility shift. The very early mobility shift observed during the RPM1-dependent response was not observed (Figure 5c). Eventual tissue collapse induced by virulent Pto DC3000 at 24 hpi also led to the disappearance of both RPM1 and RIN2 (CITATION). Neither modification nor disappearance of RIN2 were observed in control extracts from leaves inoculated with MgCl2, or with Pto DC3000(hrcC), a mutant incapable of type III effector delivery (data not shown). Identical RIN2 modification was also observed in extracts from transgenic plants expressing C-terminal c-myc-tagged RIN2 (data not shown), indicating that the modification and disappearance of RIN2 was not an artifact associated with either epitope tag. Extracts from transgenic plants expressing RIN3-HA also exhibited similar modifications after infection of Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] We noted a slight upregulation of accumulation of RIN2 mRNA following inoculation of Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) into either resistant or susceptible plants on RNA blots (not shown). Analysis of publicly available expression arrays (AtGenExpress) confirmed this—accumulation of RIN2 mRNA is relatively upregulated by Pto DC3000(avrRpm1), but not by Pto DC3000, Pto DC3000(hrcC) or any other pathogen tested (not shown). Further, RIN2 mRNA is relatively upregulated in seedlings and pollen (not shown). We did not observe differentially sized mRNAs that would correlate with the cDNA defined by clone JG in Figure 3(a), which lacks 32 codons (data not shown). Collectively, these observations suggest that the modification of RIN2 we observed is post-translational. Treatments with either calf alkaline intestinal phosphatase or endoglycosidase H did not alter the modification of RIN2, suggesting that the mobility changes are not due to phosphorylation or glycosylation (data not shown). Immunoprecipitated RIN2 proteins from leaves inoculated with Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) were subjected to protein blot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibody. However, we failed to identify ubiquitinated RIN2 (data not shown). To assign a function to RIN2 and RIN3 in RPM1-dependent responses, we isolated two T-DNA insertion mutants in RIN2 (rin2-1, SAIL 392 C08; rin2-2, SALK_141408) and one in RIN3 (rin3-1, SALK_064875) (Figure 7a). The T-DNAs of rin2-1 and rin3-1 were located in the eighth intron of RIN2 and the tenth intron of RIN3, respectively, both of which resulted in loss of functional RING-finger domains. Expression of RIN2 and RIN3 was undetectable in rin2-1 and rin3-1, respectively, suggesting that each is a null allele. We produced a rin2-1 rin3-1 double mutant. Both single mutants and the double mutant were morphologically wild type (data not shown), suggesting that RIN2 and RIN3 are dispensable for normal plant development under our growth conditions. [[FIGURE]] We quantified RPM1-dependent HR by monitoring electrolyte leakage(CITATION). Wild-type Col-0 leaves inoculated with Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) displayed dramatically increased ion leakage 3–6 hpi, which was not seen in Col-0 inoculated with Pto DC3000. The rin2-1 rin3-1 double mutant displayed significantly less ion leakage than Col-0 in repeated experiments (Figure 7c). The rin3-1 single mutant had more effect on RPM1-dependent ion leakage than the rin2-1 single mutant (Figure 7d), suggesting that RIN2 and RIN3 act additively as positive regulators of RPM1-dependent ion leakage. Similarly, RIN2 and RIN3 act additively to generate maximal RPS2-dependent ion leakage (Figure 7e), but the roles of each are apparently reversed: rin2-1 has a larger effect on RPS2-dependent ion leakage than rin3-1 (Figure 7f). However, measurement of in planta growth of Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) and DC3000 indicated no significant differences between Col-0 and rin2-1 rin3-1 (data not shown). To address whether RIN2 and RIN3 are required for the disappearance of RPM1 during HR, we generated rin2-1 rin3-1 plants with the RPM1-myc transgene (CITATION). However, the timing of the disappearance of RPM1 induced by Pto DC3000(avrRpm1) was essentially the same in Col-0 and rin2-1 rin3-1 (data not shown), suggesting that RIN2 and RIN3 are not required for degradation of RPM1.
!~MM~! Plants were cultivated in growth chambers under a 9 h light/15 h dark regime at 22°C and 60% constant relative humidity. The RIN2p-RIN2:HA gene, including 1912 bp of promoter sequence upstream of the translation start codon, was subcloned into binary vector pBAR1 (CITATION) and transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101 by electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the construct were used for transformation into plants as described (CITATION). Basta (glufosinate-ammonium) selection was performed according to CITATION. The yeast two-hybrid library was produced as described (CITATION). All RPM1, RIN2 and RIN3 yeast two-hybrid baits were cloned into the pEG202 vector. RIN2 was originally identified by two-hybrid screening using pEG10 as bait (CITATION). The prey vectors containing the fragments of RIN2 and RIN3 were made using the pJG4-5 vector (CITATION). For two-hybrid assays, bait and prey vectors were co-transformed into yeast EGY48-competent cells prepared by the Frozen-EZ yeast transformation II Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). All screening, interaction assays, and plasmid purification from yeast were done according to (CITATION). Full-length (amino acids 1–926) and N-terminal region (amino acids 1–177) RPM1 fragments with C-terminal c-myc epitope-tags were cloned into pET14b (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). RPM1-Myc proteins were produced by the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cDNA fragments of RIN2 and RIN3 were cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to produce GST-fused proteins. GST, GST-RIN2 and GST-RIN3 proteins coupled to glutathione Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with the RPM1-Myc proteins in TEDM buffer [80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 4 mM DTT and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)] at 4°C for 2 h. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with a wash buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail]. After the final wash, bound proteins were eluted in 3× SDS loading buffer at the same volume as the beads. SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and Coomassie staining were performed using standard protocols. The AtUBC1 protein was purified as previously described (CITATION). Either 20 μg or 2 μg of GST-fused RIN2 and RIN3 proteins was incubated with 30 ng of yeast E1 enzyme (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA), 2 μg His-tagged ubiquitin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), 1 μg of AtUBC1 in a reaction buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT and 4 mm ATP] at 30°C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95°C for 2 min. After SDS-PAGE and blotting, the ubiquitinated proteins were detected by anti-His antibody. Tissue was homogenized on ice in an extraction buffer [100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)] with a polytron. Total proteins were prepared by filtration through one layer of miracloth, and pelleting of the insoluble debris by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The soluble and microsomal membrane proteins were separated by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 h. Aqueous two-phase partitioning was done with a polymer concentration of 6.6% (wt/vol) as described previously (CITATION). The anti-AtPIP2b and anti-AtSEC12 antibodies were purchased from Rose Biotechnology (Rose Biotechnology, Hayward, CA, USA). The AtVAM3 antibody was provided by Dr Masa H. Sato (CITATION). Two 8.5 mm diameter leaf disks were homogenized in an extraction buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS], and incubated on ice for 1 h. Total proteins were prepared by pelleting of the insoluble debris by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and subjected to immunodetection using 10% SDS-PAGE. The anti-RD28 and anti-Tip antibodies were provided by Dr Maarten Chrispeels, and the anti-Bip antibody was provided by Dr Rebecca Boston. Pto DC3000 carrying either pVSP61 or derivatives of this plasmid containing avr genes have been described (CITATION; CITATION). For analyzing the modification of RIN2 and RIN3 and degradation of RPM1, Pto was resuspended at 5 × 107 colony-forming units (cfu) ml−1 in 10 mm MgCl2, and infiltrated into leaves of 4- to 5-week-old plants. For measurements of electrolyte leakage, Pto at 107 cfu ml−1 was infiltrated into leaves of 4- to 5-week-old plants. Four 8.5 mm diameter leaf disks were collected from the infiltrated area and washed with water for 50 min, and then placed in a tube with 15 ml of water. Conductivity was measured from five replicates for each treatment using a Yokogawa (Yokogawa, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan) conductivity meter, model SC82. For assays of bacterial growth, Pto at 105 cfu ml−1 was infiltrated, and numbers of bacteria were measured as described previously (CITATION). For analysis of RNA, tissue was ground by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RT-PCR was done using primers specific to RIN2 (sense, 5′-GCTCTCCATGCAGCCCTCCC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGGCACCTCAGCAGGAATAA-3′), RIN3 (sense, 5′-GCAACTTCAGAAGAGCTACGGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCCTGCAGAGGAACCCACA-3′) and actin (sense, 5′-GAGAGATTCAGGTGCCCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-AGAGCGAGAGCGGGTTTTCA-3′). The T-DNA insertion lines for rin2-2 (SALK_141408), and rin3-1 (SALK_064875) were identified by searches of the Salk T-DNA insertion mutant collection (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress). The seeds were obtained from the ABRC (Columbus, OH, USA). rin2-1 (SAIL 392 C08) was identified by searching SAIL (the Syngenta Arabidopsis Insertion Library). Genomic DNA was isolated from the mutant lines, and T-DNA insertions were confirmed by PCR reactions using T-DNA left border primers and gene-specific primers, followed by sequencing of the PCR products. The rin2 rin3 double mutants were produced by a cross of both lines, and identified by PCR.
