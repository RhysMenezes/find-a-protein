!~ABS~! In plants, high capacity tonoplast cation/H+ antiport is mediated in part by a family of CAX (cation exchanger) transporters. Functional association between CAX1 and CAX3 has previously been inferred; however, the nature of this interaction has not been established. Here we analyze the formation of “hetero-CAX” complexes and their transport properties. Co-expressing both CAX1 and CAX3 mediated lithium and salt tolerance in yeast, and these phenotypes could not be recapitulated by expression of deregulated versions of either transporter. Coincident expression of Arabidopsis CAX1 and CAX3 occurs during particular stress responses, flowering, and seedling growth. Analysis of cax1, cax3, and cax1/3 seedlings demonstrated similar stress sensitivities. When plants expressed high levels of both CAXs, alterations in transport properties were evident that could not be recapitulated by high level expression of either transporter individually. In planta coimmunoprecipitation suggested that a protein-protein interaction occurred between CAX1 and CAX3. In vivo interaction between the CAX proteins was shown using a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system and gel shift assays. These findings demonstrate cation exchange plasticity through hetero-CAX interactions. 
!~RES~! Phenotypes When Co-expressing CAX1 and CAX3 in Yeast—We demonstrated previously that co-expression of CAX1 and CAX3 can suppress yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport defects, whereas expression of either transporter individually failed to do so (CITATION). In fact, in yeast assays, we have never been able to measure Ca2+/H+ transport mediated by CAX1 or CAX3. Expression of the deregulated version of CAX1, sCAX1, confers high levels of Ca2+/H+ transport; however, we have not yet isolated a deregulated version of CAX3 that functions as a Ca2+/H+ transporter. In the present study, we were interested in the potential change in substrate specificity that might occur during the putative CAX1 and CAX3 association. As shown in Fig. 1, co-expression of CAX1 and CAX3 could produce Li+ tolerance, a phenotype that was not observed when deregulated versions of the transporters were expressed individually (Fig. 1A). Data suggest that both proteins localize to the yeast vacuole (supplemental Fig. 1), and we have previously shown equivalent expression levels of these transporters in yeast (CITATION, CITATION). We also consistently obtained this phenotype regardless of the promoters and vectors used to express either CAX1 or CAX3 (data not shown; supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, we were unable to recapitulate these phenotypes when using other Ca2+/H+ transporter pairs (data not shown). For example, CAX1 or CAX3 co-expressed with the tonoplast-localized Arabidopsis CAX2 or CAX4 (CITATION) did not confer any measurable changes in yeast ion tolerance (data not shown). These phenotypes imply that CAX1 and CAX3 may interact to form oligomers that confer distinct transport properties.  We also assessed the impact of co-expressing both CAX1 and CAX3 transporters on yeast metal accumulation (Fig. 1). This experiment allows us to determine if the metal accumulation in the cells was consistent with the tolerance phenotypes. We expressed sCAX1 + vector, CAX1 + vector, CAX3 + vector, or CAX1 + CAX3 and the vector control in the K667 (vcx1 pmc1 cnb1) mutant yeast strain, which is deficient in vacuolar Ca2+ transporters (CITATION) and grew the cells in liquid medium supplemented with LiCl to levels sufficient to facilitate detection in cell extracts by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Increased Ca2+, Na+, and Li+ accumulation was consistently observed in CAX1 + CAX3-expressing yeast cells compared with the cells expressing these transporters individually (Fig. 1A). Although CAX3-expressing cells demonstrated some increased Li+ content, the yeast cells expressing CAX3 were not tolerant to LiCl-containing media (Fig. 1A).  We then measured Ca2+ uptake in the vector control-, sCAX1-, and CAX1 + CAX3-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). The ΔpH-dependent 10 μm 45Ca2+ uptake was measured at several time points into yeast vacuole-enriched membrane vesicles isolated from strains expressing vector, sCAX1, and CAX1 + CAX3. We were able to measure uptake with vesicle from sCAX1- and CAX1 + CAX3-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). However, we were unable to measure Ca2+ uptake from CAX1- or CAX3-expressing cells, presumably because these transporters are autoinhibited (CITATION). The ability to measure vacuolar Ca2+ transport in the co-expressing cells suggests that both transporters are still predominantly localized on the tonoplast.  To analyze the properties of the putative CAX1 + CAX3 transporter, competition experiments were performed (Fig. 1C). The pH-dependent 10 μm 45Ca2+ uptake was measured at a single 10 min time point into yeast membrane vesicles isolated from strains expressing vector, sCAX1, and CAX1 + CAX3. This approach allowed us to determine the effect of co-expressing the CAXs in terms of cation selectivity in comparison with sCAX1. Ca2+ uptake determined in the absence of excess nonradioactive metal (control) was compared with Ca2+ uptake determined in the presence of two concentrations (10× and 100×) of various nonradioactive metals (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by nonradioactive Ca2+ was used as a control, and as expected, Ca2+ uptake was inhibited in both sCAX1 and CAX1 + CAX3 transporters by excess Ca2+. Nonradioactive Ca2+, particularly 10× concentrations, did not completely inhibit Ca2+ uptake, further highlighting the low Ca2+ affinity of the transporters. Ca2+ uptake by sCAX1-expressing cells was inhibited by Cd2+, whereas the CAX1 + CAX3-mediated Ca2+ transport was not significantly inhibited by Cd2+. In contrast, CAX1 + CAX3-expressing cells displayed more Ca2+ uptake inhibition by Li+ (Fig. 1C). Both sCAX1- and CAX1 + CAX3-expressing cells displayed similar levels of Ca2+ uptake inhibited by excess Na+ (Fig. 1C).    [[FIGURE]] To obtain a clearer understanding of the potential function of CAX1 + CAX3 in NaCl tolerance, we repeated these experiments in yeast strains lacking only the prevacuolar localized Na+/H+ transporter NHX1p (CITATION). In this strain, only yeast cells co-expressing CAX1 + CAX3 displayed sodium tolerance (Fig. 1D). This phenotype was obtained regardless of the promoters and vector sets used to co-express either CAX1 or CAX3 (data not shown; supplemental Table 1). When this experiment was performed using CAX1 or CAX3 co-expressed with the tonoplast-localized Arabidopsis CAX2 or CAX4, the cells did not display a sodium-tolerant phenotype (data not shown). Furthermore, using whole cell metal accumulation measurements, these same cells grown in high levels of NaCl accumulated slightly more Na+ and Li+ than controls or cells expressing either transporter individually (Fig. 1D).  Functional Interactions between CAX1 and CAX3 in Planta—Our previous findings suggested that CAX1 and CAX3 functionally associate in Arabidopsis cells (CITATION). In mature plants, CAX1 is expressed predominantly in green tissues, whereas CAX3 is expressed in roots (CITATION). However, there are several instances when the two transporters are co-expressed temporally and spatially. We have shown that CAX3 expression is generally low in shoot/leaf tissue but not completely absent. In fact, CAX3 is up-regulated by abscisic acid in guard cells where CAX1 is highly expressed (CITATION). Additionally, CAX1 and CAX3 are co-expressed in floral tissue and many other tissues during senescence (CITATION) (see the Arabidopsis Membrane Protein Library on the World Wide Web). As shown in Fig. 2A, analysis of CAX promoter::GUS (β-glucuronidase) reporters and RT-PCR demonstrated that both transporters were expressed in young seedlings during germination. This coincident expression during germination could signify that the CAX1-CAX3 complex has an important role in development. We thus investigated germination rates among control, cax1, cax3, and cax1/cax3 lines on lithium- and calcium-containing media (Fig. 3A). In all stress conditions, germination rates from wild-type Col-0 were significantly different from cax1 or cax3 single or double mutant lines (p < 0.05). On 50 mm CaCl2-containing media, germination rates for cax1 or cax3 single mutants were significantly different from cax1/cax3 double mutants (p < 0.05), as determined by Student's t test (Fig. 3A). In contrast, on lithium-containing media, the cax1/3 double mutant had similar germination rates compared with both cax1 and cax3 lines. Using RT-PCR, we demonstrated that during calcium treatments, CAX1 expression significantly increased, whereas CAX3 was slightly induced (CITATION, CITATION) (Fig. 3B), and exposure to lithium increased both CAX1 and CAX3 expression levels (Fig. 3C).    [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] To gain additional insights into the function of the putative CAX1-CAX3 complex, we sought to compare and contrast the transport properties from lines expressing CAX1, CAX3, and CAX1 + CAX3. Given that CAX3 expression levels are lower than CAX1, we ectopically expressed a HA-tagged CAX3 fusion driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in Col-0. After we verified expression of HA-CAX3 in the F3 generation (supplemental Fig. 1) and the induction of CAX1 by CaCl2 (Fig. 3B), we prepared vacuole-enriched membrane vesicles from 35S::HA-CAX3 lines, vector controls, and cax1-1 lines with and without CaCl2 treatment. Vector controls without CaCl2 express low levels of both CAX3 and CAX1, and we have previously demonstrated that we were able to measure any Ca2+/H+ antiport in vacuole-enriched membrane vesicles from these lines (CITATION, CITATION). Control lines treated with CaCl2 predominantly express CAX1, and we have shown that we can measure Ca2+/H+ exchange in these vesicles (Fig. 4A) (CITATION, CITATION). With cax1-1 lines, we could assess the influence of CaCl2 treatment without CAX1 present. In the 35S::HA-CAX3 lines, we could obtain vesicles predominantly expressing HA-CAX3 (without CaCl2 treatment) and vesicles expressing CAX1 + HA-CAX3 (treatment with CaCl2). Without CaCl2 treatment, Col-0, cax3-1, and cax1-1 lines displayed similar low levels of Ca2+/H+ transport activity, and the 35S::HA-CAX3 lines showed very modest activity (Fig. 4A) (data not shown). CaCl2 treatment significantly increased vacuolar Ca2+/H+ transport activity from both Col-0 and 35S::HA-CAX3 lines (Fig. 4A). We postulate that by comparing the activity in these conditions, we can compare and contrast the activity of CAX1 with that of the putative CAX1-CAX3 complex.    [[FIGURE]] To analyze the transport properties in these vacuole-enriched membranes, we performed competition studies similar to those done previously in yeast (Fig. 1C). As stated earlier, in the 35S::HA-CAX3 lines without CaCl2, we were unable to measure substantial Ca2+/H+ transport (Fig. 4A); thus, the competition measurements were not done under these conditions. Only during CaCl2 treatment, when we propose that CAX1 is active, were we able to measure uptake and perform competition measurements. In tonoplast-enriched vesicles from CaCl2-treated Col-0 lines (CAX1 activity high), Cd2+ appeared to inhibit Ca2+ transport; however, the inhibition was not as robust in CaCl2-treated 35S::HA-CAX3 lines (putative CAX1-CAX3 complex formation; Fig. 4C). In addition, lines expressing both CAX1 and CAX3 appeared to be more strongly inhibited by Li+ and Na+ than CAX1-expressing lines (CaCl2-treated Col-0). At 100× concentrations of Li+, the HA-CAX3 CaCl2-treated lines (where we postulate CAX3 + CAX1 interactions) had only 30% of the Ca2+/H+ transport activity, compared with the CAX1-expressing lines (CaCl2-treated Col-0), which were 55% as active under these conditions (Fig. 4, B and C).  Co-immunoprecipitation of CAX1 and CAX3 in Planta—To analyze the interaction between the transporters in plants, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using proteins from microsomal preparations of transgenic plant leaves and HA- and CAX1-specific antibodies (CITATION) (Fig. 5). These microsomal fractions contain vacuoles, prevacuolar compartments, and other light vesicles; however, these membrane preps should allow preliminary observations regarding co-localization of CAXs. As controls, the V-ATPase antibody and other tonoplast antibodies were used to precipitate these protein samples (supplemental Fig. 2). All immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with either HA, CAX1, or V-ATPase antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, detection with CAX1 antibody demonstrated that both CAX1 and HA antibodies clearly precipitated CAX1 proteins of the appropriate size (∼50 kDa) from controls and HA-CAX3-expressing plants but failed to precipitate the same protein from cax1-1 lines, suggesting high efficiency and specificity of immunoprecipitation and binding between CAX1 and CAX3. Detection with the HA antibody showed HA-CAX3 proteins immunoprecipitated with both CAX1 and HA antibodies from HA-CAX3 transgenic plants but not from controls and cax1-1 lines, further suggesting that CAX1 and CAX3 physically interact (Fig. 5B). As expected, the V-ATPase antibody failed to precipitate either CAX1 or HA-CAX3, although it did precipitate V-ATPase proteins from all plants (Fig. 5C). Similar negative interactions with the CAX transporters were found using antibodies against the Arabidopsis H+-pyrophosphatase (AVP1), TPC1 (two-pore channel 1), and TIP (tonoplast intrinsic protein) (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, a nonspecific interaction due to incomplete solubilization between CAX1 and CAX3 is unlikely, since neither HA-CAX3 nor CAX1 interacted with several other tonoplast proteins.  To determine if LiCl treatment altered CAX1-CAX3 interactions, we carried out gel shift assays with 35S::HA-CAX3 plant protein extracts with and without LiCl treatment. As shown in Fig. 5D, after treatment with 15 mm LiCl for 8 h, 35S::HA-CAX3 plants accumulated much more putative CAX1-CAX3 complex resolved by a native gel shift assay than control lines. However, even in control lines, the complex could be detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gels after immunoblotting (Fig. 5D).  Yeast Split Ubiquitin Assay of CAX1 and CAX3 Interaction—To test whether CAX1 and CAX3 can physically interact in yeast, an optimized split ubiquitin system was used (CITATION). This system allows detection of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo.  Protein fusions of ubiquitin were constructed (Fig. 6, A and B), and the interaction of CAX1 and CAX3 was monitored by the release of the artificial transcription factor PLV, activating lexA-driven reporter genes in the nucleus. As a positive control, we demonstrated the interaction between AtKAT1 subunits (CITATION, CITATION) (Fig. 6). As negative controls, CAX1 and CAX3 did not interact with the membrane protein AtKAT1. Using this system, interactions were observed between CAX1 and CAX3 (Fig. 6). The interaction of CAX1 (Cub or Nub) and CAX3 (Cub or Nub) was also detected by measuring β-galactosidase activity of LacZ (Fig. 6D). These results provided independent evidence that CAXs were capable of assembling in a heterodimeric protein complex.    [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The cax1-1, cax3-1, cax3-2, and cax1/cax3 (cax1/3) lines are in the Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 (CITATION, CITATION). The triple hemagglutinin (HA)2 epitope-tagged CAX3 was subcloned into a binary vector pBI121 by replacing the β-glucuronidase gene (CITATION) and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 using the floral dip method (CITATION).    For seed germination test, seed lots for Col-0, cax1-1, cax3-1, cax3-2, and cax1/cax3 seeds were treated as described previously (CITATION) and sown on one-half strength MS medium (CITATION) agar plates (1.5% sucrose, 0.8% agar, pH 5.6) with or without CaCl2 (50 and 100 mm) or LiCl (0, 6, 10, and 15 mm). Plants were grown as previously described (CITATION). Germination was monitored daily, and at least three independent experiments (about 60 seeds in each experiment) were analyzed. Seeds with protruded radicles were regarded as germinated. Germination rate was expressed as a percentage of total sown seeds.  Histochemical assays for CAX::GUS activity were performed according to the protocol described previously (CITATION). These CAX::GUS seeds were germinated on one-half strength MS medium (CITATION) and monitored daily. Samples were photographed using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) E600W microscope.  The Ca2+-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K667 (MATa cnb1::LEU1 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1) was used for most yeast assays (CITATION). The yeast NHX1 mutant WX1(Matα leu2-13 112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11, 15 ade2-1 can1-100 nhx1::TRP1) was used for additional sodium sensitivity analysis (CITATION). The Nub and Cub vectors, KAT1-Cub and Nub-KAT1 constructs, and yeast strains THY.AP4 (MATa leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-289 lexA::HIS3 lexA::ADE2 lexA::lacZ) and THY.AP5(MATα URA3 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 his3-Δ1 ade2Δ::loxP) used for the mating-based split ubiquitin system were obtained from Dr. Wolf B. Frommer at Stanford University (CITATION). CAX1, CAX3, sCAX (where the first 36 amino acids of CAX1 and CAX3 have been removed), and sCAX1H338N have been described previously (CITATION, CITATION).  Cloning of CAX1 and CAX3, was conducted using in vivo recombinational cloning (CITATION). Standard PCR conditions were used to amplify and clone CAX open reading frames into mbSUS vectors. The primers contained a B1 or B2 linker, and CAX1B1 (5′-ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCTCCAACCACCATGGCGGGAATCGTGACAGAG-3′) and CAX1B2 (5′-TCCGCCACCACCAACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGATGAGAAAACTCCTCCTCC-3′) were used for full-length CAX1 amplification. Similarly, a pair of primers, CAX3B1 (5′-ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCTCCAACCACCATGGGAAGTATCGTGGAGCCA-3′) and CAX3B2 (5′-TCCGCCACCACCAACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGCTGAGAAAACTTCTCCTCC-3′), were used for full-length CAX3 amplification. For the construction of NubX and NubWT fusions, the split ubiquitin vectors NubX and NubWT were cleaved with EcoRI/SmaI and mixed with the purified PCR products for CAX1, CAX3, N-CAX1, and C-CAX3 to transform THY.AP5 cells, and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking tryptophan and uracil. For Cub fusions, the vector metYCgate was cleaved with PstI/HindIII and mixed with the same PCR products to transform yeast strain THY.AP4, and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking leucine. After the initial interaction assay, plasmids were extracted from the yeast strains and amplified in E. coli. The interactions were then verified by repeating the assays using the purified plasmids, whose inserts were sequenced for confirmation.  Microsomal membranes were extracted from Col-0, cax1-1, 35S::HA-CAX3-transgenic Arabidopsis plant leaves (3 weeks old). Tissues were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer: 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.5 m sorbitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40,000, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm DTT. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted in 10% glycerol, 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT and then centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in membrane solubilization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mg/liter leupeptin. After microsomal proteins were completely solubilized, samples were centrifuged at 4 °C to remove debris, and the supernatants were used for co-immunoprecipitation. Microsomal proteins were incubated with 20 μl of monoclonal mouse IgG against HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA) or 50 μl of CAX1 peptide antibody raised in rabbit against the N terminus of CAX1 (CITATION), or 50 μl of V-ATPase B subunit antibody (CITATION), 20 μl of vacuolar TPC1 (two-pore channel 1) antibody (CITATION), TIP1;2 (tonoplast intrinsic protein aquaporin antibody) (CITATION), or AVP1 (Arabidopsis vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase antibody) (CITATION) raised against rabbit IgG in CIP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaCl) with protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were placed on ice for 2 h, and then 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (pre-equivalent with CIP buffer without protease inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C. After four washings with CIP buffer and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 4 °C, 500 × g for 2 min, bound proteins in beads were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample-loading buffer, and proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-Tween 20 (PBST, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies, diluted in 2% milk in PBST (anti-HA at 1:2000, anti-V-ATPase at 1:1000, anti-CAX1 at 1:500, anti-TPC1 at 1:1000, anti-AVP1 at 1:3000, anti-TIP1;2 at 1:2000). Following washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or -rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The AVP1, TIP1;2, and TPC1 antibodies have been described previously (CITATION-CITATION).  For detection of the CAX1-CAX3 complex in plants, the detergent-solubilized plant microsomal fractions were prepared as described above from 3-week-old 35S::HA-CAX3 transgenic seedlings with or without 15 mm LiCl for 8 h. As previously detailed, anti-CAX1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the CAX1-CAX3 protein complex. Extensively washed precipitates with CIP and PBST buffer were dissolved in protein loading buffer without DTT and resolved in native gel for PAGE. Similar to the yeast gel shift assay, after transfer to PVDF membrane, anti-HA and anti-CAX1 antibodies were used to detect protein complex formation.  Suppression Assay—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K667 or WX1 was transformed with yeast expression constructs as described previously (CITATION). Transformed cells were tested for their capability to suppress the K667 Ca2+-sensitive phenotype (CITATION) or WX1 NaCl-sensitive phenotype (CITATION). Growth assays using K667 cells were conducted using YPD medium supplemented with or without CaCl2 (50, 100, 150, or 200 mm), LiCl (30, 50, 60, or 100 mm), or NaCl (400, 500, or 600 mm). Lithium and CaCl2 plates were made in YPD agar medium. The LiCl stock solution was filter-sterilized and added to the autoclaved YPD agar medium to final concentrations of 30, 50, 70, or 100 mm. K667 cells expressing various constructs were grown in SC selection medium overnight at 30 °C. After a series of 5-fold dilutions with water, 5-μl cell suspensions were spotted on the indicated media, and the cells were grown for 3 days. A growth assay with the WX1 strain was conducted on AP medium (CITATION) supplemented with or without NaCl (20-60 mm), and drop tests were conducted as described above. For these assays, cells were grown at 30 °C for 4 days.  Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy Analysis—Yeast culture conditions and sample processing were slightly modified from previous studies (CITATION, CITATION). For growth in Li+- and Ca2+-supplemented media, K667 cells expressing the various constructs were inoculated in 5 ml of YPD plus 1/100 volume of 100× mineral supplement stock (CITATION), supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 or 500 μm LiCl (final concentrations). For Na+ supplementation experiments, WX1 cells expressing the various constructs were inoculated in 5 ml of YPD supplemented with 100 mm NaCl (final concentration). The cultures were grown at 30 °C to stationary phase, and 2.5 ml of each culture was collected by vacuum filtration using isopore membrane filters (1.2-μm pore size) (Fisher). Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of 1 μm EDTA disodium salt solution, pH 8.0, by vacuum filtration, followed by three washes with 1 ml of distilled, deionized H2O. The filters were dried in a 70 °C oven for 48 h before inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy analysis was performed, as pervious described (CITATION). Data from five repeats were calculated with a formula, (ioncax - ionvector)/ionvector × 100, and expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 5).  Microsomal fractions from yeast cells expressing CAX variants were prepared using the glass bead method (CITATION). Briefly, glass bead buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to the cells with an equal volume of glass beads (Sigma), and the mixture was vortexed for 3 × 1 min at maximum speed with intervals of 10 min on ice. Finally, Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.5%. The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. Equal amounts of protein (about 15 μg) from samples were resolved on native 12% PAGE with SDS-PAGE running buffer, followed by transferring membranes and immunoblotting as described above. Proteins were detected with HA, c-Myc, and GFP antibodies (Covance, Berkeley, CA).  Transmembrane domains and topology of CAX1 and CAX3 were predicted using the ARAMEMNON data base (available on the World Wide Web) and the transmembrane hidden Markov model (TMHMM version 2.0) program.  The split ubiquitin system used in this assay was a mating-based split ubiqutin system developed previously (CITATION, CITATION). Approximately 40 clones of each THY.AP5 and THY.AP4 transformation with various Nub and Cub constructs were mixed and incubated in appropriate selective SC with and without G418. Cultures of the lag phase were used for mating, as described previously (CITATION). After mating THY.AP4 and THY.AP5 strains on YPD for 8 h of incubation at 28 °C, diploid cells were selected by replica plating on SC without tryptophan, leucine, and uracil for 2-3 days. Diploid cells were used to test on SC medium supplemented with 150 μm methionine for 3 days. After sequencing confirmation, these Nub and Cub constructs containing CAX1 and CAX3 constructs were used for retransformation, and the interaction assay was repeated using the confirmed Nub and Cub constructs.  For the filter assay, diploid cells were grown for 3 days on sterilized filter sets placed on SC medium supplemented with His, adenine, and 150 μm methionine. β-Galactosidase activity assays were conducted according to the standard X-gal filter assay protocol described previously (CITATION). Color changes in the positive interactions could be detected within 3 h.  Plants were grown hydroponically and membrane vesicles for yeast and plant Ca2+ uptake were performed as described previously (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). Three-week-old plants (mainly roots) were collected after 16 h of treatment with or without 100 mm CaCl2 (CITATION). For the measurement of ΔpH-dependent Ca2+ uptake, vacuole-enriched membrane vesicles were incubated in buffer containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm sodium azide, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The vesicles were added to 1 mm MgSO4 and 1 mm ATP to reach steady state pH gradient for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of 45Ca2+ (6 mCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). The final concentration of Ca2+ in the reaction mixture was 10 μm and 1 mm. At the indicated times, aliquots of the reaction mix were removed and filtered through premoistened 0.45-μm filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by washing with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm CaCl2), the filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For metal competition experiments, ΔpH-dependent 10 μm 45Ca2+ uptake was measured at a 10 min time point in the presence of 100 μm or 1 mm nonradioactive metals.  For testing CAX1 and CAX3 expression, Col-0 seeds were analyzed at different times during germination. For LiCl induction, germinating seeds on day 4 were treated with 15 mm LiCl, and seedling RNA was extracted 8, 16, and 24 h post-treatment. For CAX1 expression in cax1-1, Col-0, and 35S::HA-CAX3 transgenic plants, roots of 3-week-old plants grown hydroponically in B5 medium were harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase kit with oligo(dT)12-18 primer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with the following program: 94 °C for 2 min to denature DNA and then from 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, to 72 °C for 30 s for 22, 25, or 30 cycles, followed by 72 °C for a 10-min extension. ACTIN1 expression was used as internal control. For CAX1, forward primer was 5′-GCG TTA ATT AAG GCG CGC CTT CCG GCC ATA CCT GCC GCC A-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-GCG GGA TCC ATT TAA ATC ACC GCG GTT TCT TGC TCC AC-3′. For CAX3, forward primer was 5′-GCG TTA ATT AAG GCG CGC CCA TGG GAG AAC AGC ACA CAA C-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-GCG GGA TCC ATT TAA ATC CGC GAC AGA GTG AGC GAC AT-3′. For ACTIN1, forward primer was 5′-GTGCTCGACTCTGGAGATGGTGTG-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-CGGCGATTCCAGGGAACATTGTGG-3′.
