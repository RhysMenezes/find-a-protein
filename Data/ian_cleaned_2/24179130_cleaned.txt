!~ABS~! STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE1 (SCD1) encodes a putative Rab guanine nucleotide exchange factor that functions in membrane trafficking and is required for cytokinesis and cell expansion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show that the loss of SCD2 function disrupts cytokinesis and cell expansion and impairs fertility, phenotypes similar to those observed for scd1 mutants. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that SCD1 function is dependent upon SCD2 and that together these proteins are required for plasma membrane internalization. Further specifying the role of these proteins in membrane trafficking, SCD1 and SCD2 proteins were found to be associated with isolated clathrin-coated vesicles and to colocalize with clathrin light chain at putative sites of endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Together, these data suggest that SCD1 and SCD2 function in clathrin-mediated membrane transport, including plasma membrane endocytosis, required for cytokinesis and cell expansion.
!~RES~! Heterozygous scd2-1/+ plants segregated for defects in plant growth and development as expected for a single recessive mutation (139 mutant:373 wild type, χ2 = 1.26, P = 0.262). Analysis of fully expanded mature rosette leaves revealed cytokinesis defects in ∼58% of scd2-1 stomata, representing the various types of defects (oblate/type 2, stub/type 3, and hanging pore/type 4) observed in the stomatal cytokinesis-defective mutants scd1-1 (CITATION) and cyd1 (CITATION) (Figures 1A to 1D, 1F to 1I, 1J to 1M, and 1O to 1R). Oblate/type 2 stomata, in which no ventral wall or pore was evident (Figures 1B, 1G, 1K, and 1P), predominated at 50%, and stomata containing one or more incomplete ventral wall(s) (stub/type 3; Figures 1C, 1H, 1L, and 1Q), including those that contained a pore (hanging pore/type 4; Figures 1D, 1I, 1M, and 1R), occurred at ∼8% frequency. Similar to scd1-1 mutants (CITATION), CW stubs were also observed in scd2-1 leaf epidermal pavement cells stained with toluidine blue-O (TBO) (Figure 1E) or propidium iodide (PI) (Figure 1S) or expressing the cell surface marker green fluorescent protein–LOW TEMPERATURE-INDUCED 6b (GFP-LTI6b; CITATION) (Figure 1N), albeit less frequently than in stomata. The GC-specific reporter fusion POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA1pro–bacterial β-glucuronidase (KAT1pro-GUS; CITATION) was used to confirm the GC identity of oblate stomata in scd2-1 leaves, distinguishing them from cell cycle–arrested GMCs (Figures 1F to 1I). Additionally, defective scd2-1 stomata expressing the N7 nuclear GFP (CITATION) were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to be binucleate (Figures 1O to 1R), an indicator of normal karyokinesis despite subsequent defective cytokinesis. The stomatal density in scd2-1 leaves was elevated (173 ± 15.3 GC/mm2; n = 11) relative to that in wild-type leaves (143 ± 8.42 GC/mm2; n = 4 ± se). [[FIGURE]] Additional phenotypes, such as incongruous spaces or gaps between epidermal cells and clusters of small cells, were observed in the epidermis of scd2-1 leaves and cotyledons when analyzed by CLSM (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). The spaces/gaps were readily visualized by CLSM in cotyledons from plants expressing GFP-LTI6b 6 d after germination (DAG) as small regions between adjacent cells that densely stained with PI and appeared not to be bound by a distinct PM (see Supplemental Figures 1C to 1E online). Clusters of small cells arranged more or less symmetrically were also observed in the cotyledon epidermis of PI-stained and GFP-LTI6b–expressing scd2-1 plants 6 DAG (see Supplemental Figures 2A to 2D online). The spaces/gaps and small cell clusters were previously not reported for scd1 mutants; however, given the similarity in leaf cell division and expansion defects between scd2 and scd1 mutants, we reexamined the cellular arrangements observed in scd1-2 loss-of-function mutants. Similar to scd2-1, CLSM imaging of PI-stained scd1-2 cotyledons 6 DAG revealed the presence of both PI-positive spaces and small, nearly symmetrically organized, cell clusters (see Supplemental Figures 1A, 1B, and 2E to 2H online). In addition to cytokinesis defects, scd2-1 plants, like scd1 mutants, displayed aberrant growth and development (Figure 2; CITATION). Aerial organs of scd2-1 mutant plants were dwarfed relative to the wild type (Figures 2A to 2C), with bolts that grew to a maximum height of 3 cm (Figure 2C) and produced flowers that failed to fully mature and were infertile (Figures 2C and 2D). scd2-1 roots were also stunted due at least in part to reduced cell numbers within the root division and transition zones (as defined in CITATION) (Figures 2A and 2E). The number of cortical cells comprising these zones in three representative confocal images of PI-stained vertically grown seedlings seven DAG was 4.2 ± 0.48 cells in the division zone of scd2-1 versus 18 ± 0.45 cells for the wild type, and in the transition zone, 5.5 ± 0.34 cells for scd2-1 compared with 10 ± 0.86 cells for the wild type (n = 3 for each genotype ± se). Cell expansion defects were also observed in both scd1 (CITATION) and scd2 mutants. The average surface area of cotyledon pavement cells from seedlings seven DAG was 46.3 ± 3.9 mm2 in wild-type plants but only 30.4 ± 1.5 for scd2-1 mutants (n = 4 [≥ 7 cells per individual] for each genotype ± se). Unlike scd1 mutants (CITATION), root hair morphology was unaffected in scd2 seedlings (see Supplemental Figures 3B to 3D online). Like scd1 mutants, scd2 mutant seedlings were hypersensitive to Suc, resulting in a markedly smaller and darker appearance than wild-type seedlings grown on the same media (CITATION; see Supplemental Figure 3A online). Taken together, these defective phenotypes of scd2 mutants indicate a role for SCD2 in cytokinesis and cell expansion. [[FIGURE]] Standard map-based cloning coupled with DNA sequencing revealed the scd2-1 lesion to be a deletion of a guanine nucleotide at position 1372 of the At3g48860 open reading frame (ORF) (see Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Methods 1 and 2 online). The identity of SCD2 was supported through the ability of a genomic clone including the entire 4.6-kb region of At3g48860 plus 1.3 kb of upstream sequence and 0.5 kb of downstream sequence (SCD2pro-SCD2) to rescue scd2-1 mutant phenotypes. Transgenic SCD2/scd2 lines displayed normal growth and development, including leaf and root expansion (Figure 3A) and GC formation (Figures 3B to 3D), at all stages of development. In addition, a second mutant allele, scd2-2, which is the result of a T-DNA insertion within the third intron of SCD2 (see Supplemental Figure 4B online), was identified that cosegregates with scd2 mutant phenotypes. [[FIGURE]] According to data compiled by the Bio-Array Resource for Plant Functional Genomics (http://bar.utoronto.ca; CITATION), SCD2 is expressed in Arabidopsis roots, hypocotyls, cotyledons, rosette leaves, whole flowers, carpels, stamens, pollen, and seed. SCD2 is also highly expressed in GCs (http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/labs/schroeder/guardcellchips.html; CITATION). To further assess the cell- and tissue-specific expression patterns of SCD2, we generated transgenic wild-type lines transformed with a bacterial GUS-encoding reporter ORF under control of the 1.3-kb SCD2 promoter region (SCD2pro-GUS). Expression of SCD2pro-GUS was observed in GCs in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves in seedlings and adult plants (Figures 4A and 4B) and often in the socket cells surrounding the base of trichomes (Figure 4B, inset). Strong GUS staining was also observed in hydathodes of fully expanded rosette leaves (Figure 4B, arrows). In roots, GUS staining was observed at the mature region of the primary root (Figure 4A) and the tips of short, young lateral roots branching from the primary root (Figures 4C and 4D), but not the primary root tip (Figure 4A). [[FIGURE]] SCD2 was predicted by the Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/; CITATION) to encode a 1734-bp mRNA and a 577–amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 63.74 kD containing a pair of central coiled-coil domains that mapped to Ser205-Lys268 and Gln279-Val347 (see Supplemental Figure 4C and Supplemental Methods 3 online) according to the Paircoil2 algorithm (CITATION). The single base pair deletion in scd2-1 resulted in a frame shift in the predicted ORF that would encode a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon (see Supplemental Figure 4C online) preceded by 36 out-of-frame amino acids following Leu457 of SCD2. SCD2 is similar at the amino acid level to four other Arabidopsis putative proteins encoded by At5g13260, At4g25070, At5g23700, and At4g08630 (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 and Supplemental Figure 5 online). These homologs were also predicted to encode coiled-coil domains as well as a ProDom-defined, plant-specific domain of unknown function, PD147848 (http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php; CITATION), at their carboxy-termini that they share with SCD2, which we refer to as the SCD2 domain (see Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 5 online). The percentage identity and similarity of the predicted full-length proteins and SCD2 domains of these four homologs compared pairwise to SCD2 are reported in Supplemental Table 2 online. A BLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) revealed the presence of putative SCD2 homologs in other divergent plant genomes, such as those of the genera Ricinus (castor), Vitis (grape), Cucumis (cucumber), Solanum (tomato), Zea (maize), Glycine (soybean), Oryza (rice), Sorghum, Panicum (switchgrass), Picea (spruce), and Populus (poplar), but not in the genomes of animals, fungi, or protists, suggesting that the SCD2 protein serves a plant-specific function. Of the four Arabidopsis SCD2 homologs, expressed sequence tags have been identified for At5g13260, At4g25070, and At5g23700 (www.Arabidopsis.org), and all four have been detected in cDNA libraries used in microarray analyses (www.Arabidopsis.org; http://bar.utoronto.ca; CITATION). scd2 mutants share many of the pleiotropic phenotypes of scd1 mutants, such as incomplete cytokinesis in leaf epidermal cells, cell expansion defects, and Suc hypersensitivity (Figures 1, 2 and 4; CITATION). Double mutant analysis was conducted to investigate whether scd1 and scd2 mutants affect the same or related cellular mechanisms or pathways. The root expansion defects of scd1 and scd2 mutant seedlings grown vertically on 1% (w/v) Suc media were visibly polymorphic and easily scored (Figure 2A); thus, root growth was monitored in a segregating scd1-2 scd2-1 double mutant population (Figure 5). The root lengths of homozygous scd1-2 scd2-1 double mutant and scd1-2 and scd2-1 single mutant seedlings 48 DAG were 19.65 ± 0.92, 16.09 ± 1.03, and 40.84 ± 0.75 mm, respectively, while the root length of wild-type seedlings, which outgrew the plate at 16 DAG, was last recorded at 75.88 ± 0.55 mm (n = 3 for each genotype; ±se) (Figure 5). scd1-2 scd2-1 and scd1-2 root length measurements were determined not to be significantly different (Student’s t test with α = 0.05), and the growth rate of scd1-2 scd2-1 double mutant seedlings was nearly identical to that of scd1-2 mutants, while scd2-1 and wild-type seedlings grew faster (Figure 5), indicating that scd1-2 scd2-1 double mutants mimic the root growth phenotype of the scd1-2 single mutants, but not that of the scd2-1 single mutants. The scd1-2 scd2-1 double mutant root growth phenotype also was not intermediate between (i.e., synergistic) or different from (i.e., neomorphic) that of the scd2-1 and scd1-2 single mutants. Together, these data indicate that SCD1 is epistatic to SCD2. [[FIGURE]] Affinity-purified antibodies generated against the amino-terminus of SCD2 (anti-SCD2N-term) reproducibly detected two polypeptides in whole seedling extracts that migrated at or near the predicted ∼64-kD molecular mass of the SCD2 protein (Figure 6). Both polypeptides were absent in scd2-1 and scd2-2 protein extracts (Figure 6, lanes 5 and 6), while SCD2 was detected in extracts from scd1-1 and scd1-2 mutants at levels similar to those of the wild type (Columbia-5 [Col-5] and Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and scd1 and scd2 mutants expressing functional SCD1 and SCD2 under the control of their native promoters (SCD1/scd1 and SCD2/scd2), respectively (Figure 6). To confirm equal loading of total protein, the samples were probed with antibodies against soluble and membrane protein markers cytosolic FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE (cFBP) and KNOLLE (KN)/Sec12p-like protein (SEC12), respectively. As shown in Figure 6 (bottom panel), the levels of cFBP (CITATION) were similar in all protein extracts analyzed. However, the levels of KN, a protein required for CP membrane fusion (CITATION), and SEC12, an integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein (CITATION), varied significantly between wild-type, rescued lines, and scd mutant total protein extracts. These variations may reflect changes in membrane composition and/or protein abundance in the mutant plants. Indeed, a survey of Arabidopsis expression data available through Genevestigator (CITATION) for conditions that result in similar trends in KN and SEC12 expression levels indicated that the levels of these membrane-associated proteins are altered in plants challenged with a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors (e.g., pathogen elicitation, heat, and drought) and thus may be an indirect effect of the compromised development of these mutants. [[FIGURE]] As previously demonstrated (CITATION), affinity-purified SCD1 antibodies (anti-SCD1DENN) detected the ∼140-kD SCD1 protein in total protein extracts from the wild type, SCD1/scd1, SCD2/scd2, and, to a lesser extent, scd1-1 plants, but not in scd1-2 plant extracts (Figure 6). Interestingly, SCD1 levels were markedly reduced in total protein extracts from scd2-1 and scd2-2 plants compared with those of the wild type (Figure 6). By contrast, the levels of the SCD1 and SCD2 proteins were similar in plant extracts from the wild type and the stomatal cytokinesis-defective cyd1 mutant (CITATION), indicating that the observed reduction of SCD1 in scd2 mutants is not due to a general defect in GC cytokinesis and cell expansion (Figure 6). The mammalian connecdenn 1 protein has been identified as a component of CCVs (CITATION, CITATION). To investigate if SCD1 and/or SCD2 are associated with plant CCVs, we employed a tandem fractionation scheme to prepare an enriched sample of CCVs from rapidly dividing and expanding suspension-cultured Arabidopsis T87W cells (Figure 7). By negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis, the final CCV-enriched fraction was found to contain 76% ± 10% (n = 11) clathrin-coated versus noncoated vesicles (Figure 7B; see Supplemental Figure 6D online). Immunoblot analysis of the T87W cell lysate (H) and subsequent successive fractions generated in the preparation of CCVs demonstrated that the final CCV fraction was significantly enriched for clathrin and CLASPs, including CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAINs (CHCs), CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN2 (CLC2), adaptor protein complex (AP1 and AP2) components, and the CLASP EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR PATHWAY SUBSTRATE INTERACTING PROTEIN (EPSIN1; i.e. EPN1; CITATION) (Figure 7A). The presence of both AP1 and AP2 demonstrated that the final enriched CCV fraction includes TGN-derived and endocytic CCVs (CITATION). The final enriched CCV fractions were also enriched in the CP and endosomal trans-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptors (t-SNARES), KN, and SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS21 (SYP21), respectively, highlighting the enrichment of late secretory pathway membrane targeting and fusion proteins in clathrin-enriched fractions. By contrast, marker proteins for the endoplasmic reticulum (SEC12; CITATION), cis-Golgi (MANNOSIDASE 1A/B [MAN1A/B]; CITATION), vacuole (VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE E1 [VHA-E1]; CITATION), chloroplast (TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVELOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS33 [TOC33]; CITATION), peroxisome (PEROXIN14 [PEX14]; CITATION), and mitochondria (CYTOCHROME OXIDASE2 [COX2]; CITATION) were significantly depleted in the final CCV preparations (Figure 7A). [[FIGURE]] Importantly, immunoblot analysis using affinity-purified anti-SCD1DENN and -SCD2N-term antibodies demonstrated that these two proteins cofractionated with CCVs (Figure 7A). Consistent with our immunoblot analysis of SCD2 protein in seedling total protein extracts (Figure 6), we detected two major ∼64- and ∼72-kD polypeptides in the Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cell homogenate (Figure 7A, arrowheads), as well as an additional polypeptide with higher apparent molecular mass of ∼80 kD (Figure 7A, asterisk; see Supplemental Figure 7 online) that was below detection in whole-seedling extracts. Notably, the ∼72- and ∼80-kD polypeptides detected with the affinity-purified anti-SCD2N-term antibody were enriched (Figure 7A, asterisk and top arrowhead), whereas the ∼64-kD polypeptide was depleted, in CCV-enriched fractions (Figure 7A, bottom arrowhead). Unlike KN, an integral membrane protein, SCD1 and the ∼64-, ∼72-, and ∼80-kD SCD2 polypeptides were released from microsomal membranes after treatment with 6 M urea (see Supplemental Figure 7 and Supplemental Methods 4 online). Low but detectable levels of soluble SCD1 and the ∼64- and ∼72-kD SCD2 polypeptides were also present in membrane-free cytosol (S150) (see Supplemental Figure 7 online), indicating that SCD1 and SCD2 are peripheral membrane proteins. To corroborate the presence of SCD1 and SCD2 on CCVs, we further characterized the CCV-enriched fraction via immunoelectron microscopy (see Supplemental Methods 5 online). The embedded CCV suspension was thin-sectioned (60 to 100 nm) to achieve a broad distribution of exposed epitopes (e.g., clathrin coat and membrane surface). Probing sections with the anti-CLC2 and -SCD1DENN antibodies clearly demonstrated the presence of CLC2 and SCD1 on a subpopulation of vesicles (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). However, attempts to use the affinity-purified anti-SCD2N-term antibody to localize the SCD2 protein were unsuccessful, suggesting that the antibody is not suitable for immunoelectron microscopy analysis under the conditions used (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Large-field views of sections probed with anti-CLC2, -SCD1DENN, -SCD2N-term, and the anti-rabbit:10-nm gold conjugate secondary antibodies (control) revealed a strong specificity and an apparently higher proportion of vesicles labeled with anti-CLC2 versus those with anti-SCD1DENN (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). However, it is possible that this result reflects differences in epitope availability rather than reduced levels of SCD1 on a given vesicle relative to another. Based upon the cytokinesis and cell expansion defects of scd1 and scd2 mutants and their cofractionation with AP1 and AP2 CCVs, we hypothesized that SCD1 and SCD2 proteins are required for post-Golgi and/or endocytic trafficking. To determine whether PM endocytosis is impaired in the scd mutants, we used CLSM to monitor the cellular internalization of the lipophilic dye FM4-64 (http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/T3166) in the roots of wild-type and scd seedlings (Figure 8). Representative images showed a decrease in the number of FM4-64–labeled fluorescent puncta within root cells of scd1-1, scd1-2, and scd2-1 mutants after 10 min compared with wild-type cells (Figures 8A to 8D). Quantification of FM4-64 internalization, expressed as the average ratio of intracellular fluorescent signal per unit area versus that of PM, normalized to the wild type, revealed endocytosis was significantly reduced in scd2-1, scd1-1, and scd1-2 compared with the wild type, respectively (Figure 8E). [[FIGURE]] Given that SCD1 and SCD2 cofractionate with CCVs, and that scd1 and scd2 mutants display impaired FM4-64 internalization, we examined whether N-terminally GFP-tagged SCD1 and/or SCD2 colocalize with CCPs at the cell cortex by variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM; CITATION). Expression of GFP-SCD1 and GFP-SCD2 under the control of their native promoters in homozygous scd1-1 and scd2-1, respectively, rescued the phenotypic growth and developmental defects of scd1-1 and scd2-1 mutants (see Supplemental Figure 8 and Supplemental Methods 6 online), demonstrating that the GFP-tagged SCD1 and SCD2 fusion constructs are functional. Similar to CLC-mOrange, which localizes to CCPs (CITATION), VAEM imaging of epidermal root cells of seedlings expressing GFP-SCD1 or GFP-SCD2 revealed that these two proteins likewise localize at or near the PM in discrete dynamic foci (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). Intriguingly, in GFP-SCD1/scd1-1 and GFP-SCD2/scd2-1 lines coexpressing CLC2-mOrange, we observed a subpopulation of foci at or near the PM that contained both GFP-SCD1 and CLC2-mOrange or GFP-SCD2 and CLC2-mOrange (Figures 9C, 9F, 9I, and 9L). Colocalization of GFP-SCD1 and CLC2-mOrange or GFP-SCD2 and CLC2-mOrange was quantitatively verified using the Costes randomization test (CITATION). Image pairs (Figures 9A and 9B, and 9G and 9H) were analyzed with 200 Costes iterations using a 0.432-µm (4-pixel) point spread function. The Pearson coefficients of both pairs were higher than that of all 200 iterations of each respective analysis, resulting in a Costes P value of 1.000 for both pairs. A P value greater than 0.95 is taken to demarcate colocalization, demonstrating that a subpopulation of SCD1 and SCD2 foci at or near the PM contain CLC2. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana seed sources are as follows: fast-neutron mutants (M1G-01A-02; Lehle Seeds); Col-5 wild-type (CS28175), 29-1 (CS84726; CITATION), and N7 (CS84731; CITATION; ABRC); T-DNA insertion mutant scd2-2 (GK_129C05; GABI-Kat) (CITATION); CLC2-mOrange transgenic lines as previously described (CITATION); and scd1 and KAT1pro-GUS (CITATION) as previously described (CITATION). Heterozygous scd2-1 lines were backcrossed three times to Col-5 (i.e., Col-0 gl-1) prior to characterization. Seeds were sterilized for 5 and 1 min in 70% (v/v) ethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-10, and 95% (v/v) ethanol, plated on solid germination medium (half-strength MS [CITATION] and 0.6 or 1% [w/v] agar) containing indicated antibiotics or sugars, stratified for 3 d at 4°C, and then grown under continuous light at 22°C. Soil-grown plants were germinated on or transferred to Metro-Mix360 (SunGro Horticulture) and grown under long days (16 h light/8 h dark) at 17 or 22°C. Whole seedlings and plants were imaged using a Nikon CoolPix digital camera (Nikon Instruments). Arabidopsis T87W cells (CITATION) were grown on a gyrorotatory shaker (140 rpm) in MS, 0.2 mg/L 2,4-D, and 1.32 mM KH2PO4 under continuous light at 22°C and subcultured into fresh media (1:10 dilution) weekly. All PCR-generated cloning fragments used in these studies (see Supplemental Table 3 online) were produced using Phusion DNA polymerase (F-530; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and all oligonucleotide primers (see Supplemental Table 4 online) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Transgenic plants were generated via Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated floral dip (CITATION). For scd2-1 rescue, heterozygous scd2-1 plants transformed with SCD2pro-SCD2 (see Supplemental Table 3 online) were selected on one-half-strength MS and 50 mg/L kanamycin (Kan), and T2 and T3 plants confirmed to be homozygous for scd2-1 (SCD2/scd2-1) were used for analysis. Kan-resistant T2 and T3 plants from a transformation of Col-2 with SCD2pro-GUS (see Supplemental Table 3 online) were used for SCD2 spatial expression analysis. SCD1pro-GFP-SCD1 was transformed into homozygous scd1-1 plants grown at the permissive temperature, and transgenic GFP-SCD1/scd1-1 plants were selected on one-half-strength MS and 50 mg/L of Kan. GFP-SCD2/scd2-1 was transformed into heterozygous scd2-1 plants, and transgenic GFP-SCD2/scd2-1 plants were selected as for GFP-SCD1/scd1-1 above. Heterozygous scd1-2 scd2-1 F2 plants were grown vertically on one-half-strength MS and 1% (w/v) Suc and scanned on a flatbed scanner (CanoScan N24OU; Canon) at 3- to 7-d intervals. Seedlings were transferred to fresh media 25 DAG. Roots were measured using ImageJ software (CITATION). Seedlings were collected for PCR genotyping analysis at 48 DAG or when their roots reached the bottom of the culture plate. TBO-stained epidermal peels were prepared as previously described (CITATION) and imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) with a Leica DFS480 digital camera using Leica FireCam software (Leica Microsystems). F2 plants from scd2-1 crosses to 29-1 (i.e., GFP-LTI6b) and N7 (CITATION) lines were germinated on half-strength MS and 15 mg/L of glyphosate and imaged via CLSM (Nikon C1; Nikon Instruments) using ×60 or ×100 oil immersion objectives (numerical aperture = 1.4 for both). To visualize CWs, plants were stained with PI as previously described (CITATION) and imaged via CLSM as above. CLSM images were false colored, merged, and/or adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems). Cotyledon pavement cell area was calculated using ImageJ software (CITATION). F2 plants of scd2-1 × KAT1pro-GUS crosses (CITATION) or Col2:SCD2pro-GUS T2 plants were germinated on half-strength MS and 50 mg/L of Kan and processed as follows: Tissue was fixed in ice-cold 90% (v/v) acetone (10 to 15 min on ice), rinsed two times (50 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0), vacuum infiltrated four to six times with GUS staining solution (0.5 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-glucuronide, 0.5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], 0.5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6], 0.5% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 50 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0), and incubated at 37°C overnight, and phytopigments were removed via several changes of 70% (v/v) ethanol at 37°C. Images were obtained using Leica MZ6, Leica M165FC, or Zeiss Axioskop microscopes as above. Whole seedlings were mounted on 1% (w/v) agar to which white paint was added until the desired opacity was achieved and imaged using a Nikon CoolPix digital camera (Nikon Instruments). Analysis of internalization of the lipophilic dye FM4-64 (2 µM) was performed as previously described (CITATION). Data were collected from three independent experiments measuring 30 individual roots, 10 to 15 cells per root. A Student’s t test (paired with two-tailed distribution) was used for statistical analysis. For VAEM, GFP-SCD1/scd1-1 and GFP-SCD2/scd2-1 T2 plants were crossed to CLC2-mOrange (CITATION), and F3 plants of GFP-SCD1/scd1-1 or GFP-SCD2/scd2-1 × CLC2-mOrange were germinated on half-strength MS, 50 mg/L of Kan, and 15 mg/L of glyphosate. Nine DAG, segregating seedlings were transferred to media without selection and allowed to recover for 6 d prior to imaging. The epidermal cells of representative seedling roots of each genotype (n > 5) were then observed by VAEM on a Nikon EclipseTE2000-U inverted microscope equipped with a ×100, 1.45–numerical aperture Plan Apo total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy objective using 488-nm argon and 543-nm HeNe lasers (Melles Griot). Images of GFP and mOrange channels were acquired sequentially as averages of four 500-ms exposures with an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Images were processed using the ImageJ (CITATION) rolling ball background subtraction tool (0.540-µm ball radius) and subsequently analyzed using the Colocalization Threshold and Coloc2 plug-ins, which employ the Costes image randomization test as described (CITATION). Liquid N2-ground seedlings or N2 decompression-lysed cultured cells (using a 45-mL Parr cell disruption vessel; Parr Instrument Company) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (CITATION), and protein concentrations were determined using 660-nm protein assay reagent containing ionic detergent compatibility reagent (22660 and 22663; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using BSA as a standard. Equal total protein was resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting (2 h at 300 mA). After blocking in PBS-T (2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 1.9 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.1% [v/v] Tween 20, pH 7) and 5% (w/v) milk (30 to 60 min at 22°C or overnight at 4°C), blots were incubated with primary antibody in the above PBS-T milk blocking buffer (several hours to overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking). Affinity-purified antibodies were generated as previously described: anti-SCD1DENN (CITATION), anti-CLC2 (CITATION), anti-KN (CITATION), anti-MAN1A/B (CITATION), anti-RGP1 (CITATION), anti-SEC12 (CITATION), anti-SYP21 (CITATION), and anti-TOC33 (CITATION). Anti-CHC (sc-57684) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-COX2 (AS04 053A), anti-VHA-E1 (AS07 213), anti-PEX14 (AS08 372), and anti-cFBP (AS04 043) were purchased from Agrisera. Anti-EPN1 (CITATION), anti-AP2α, and anti-AP1γ were a gift from I. Hwang (Postech University, Pohang, Korea). After four washes in PBS-T, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG [NA934V or NA931V; Amersham Life Sciences]) in blocking buffer (1 h at 22°C). Blots were washed as above and then incubated in Lumi-Light or Lumi-LightPLUS chemiluminescent substrate (12015200001 or 12015196001; Roche Applied Science) for 5 min at 22°C and exposed to film (BX810; MIDSCI) or imaged using an ImageQuant LAS4010 digital imaging system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Film exposures were digitized using a CanoScan N24OU scanner. Images were adjusted for contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop CS5. His8-Maltose Binding Protein (MBP)-Tobacco Etch Virus protease recognition site (TEV)-SCD2N-term (see Supplemental Table 3 online) was expressed in Escherichia coli B834 pRARE2 (CITATION) from pVP16-TEV-SCD2N-term (see Supplemental Table 3 online) as follows: 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (CITATION), 50 mg/L of carbenicillin, and 34 mg/L of chloramphenicol were inoculated with a 50-mL saturated overnight culture, grown to OD600≈0.6 (at 20°C), and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (2 h at 20°C). His8-MBP-TEV-SCD2N-term was purified sequentially by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (E8021; New England Biolabs) followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (30210; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, dialyzed against PBS, and its concentration determined by Bradford assay (500-0006; Bio-Rad) and SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and scanning densitometry using BSA as a standard. Rabbit antibodies were raised against His8-MBP-TEV-SCD2N-term (Covance Research Products) and depleted of anti-His8-MBP antibodies using immobilized His8-MBP resin (Affi-Gel 10; Bio-Rad) prior to affinity purification of anti-SCD2N-term antibodies using immobilized His8-MBP-TEV-SCD2N-term as described previously (CITATION). Three to four days after subculturing, 60 to 90 mL of packed cell volume of T87W cells (CITATION) was harvested by centrifugation (4 min at 100g) and washed and resuspended in clathrin isolation buffer (1× CIB: 100 mM MES, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mM MgCl2) with protease inhibitors (1× protease inhibitor cocktail-DMSO-soluble and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail-water-soluble [CITATION], 1 mM DTT, and 10 μg/mL of E64). Cells were lysed by N2 decompression (20 min at 1500 p.s.i. N2) and centrifuged (4 min at 100g). CCVs were purified by differential and density gradient centrifugation essentially as described (CITATION; CITATION). Briefly, the cell homogenate (H) underwent sequential differential centrifugation (4 min at 100g, 10 min at 1000g, and 25 min at 30,000g). Microsomal membranes (Suc step gradient load) from the 30,000g supernatant (S30) were collected by centrifugation (60 min at 120,000g), resuspended in 1× CIB, layered onto a 10/40/50% (w/v) Suc step gradient, centrifuged (50 min at 116,000g), and fractions corresponding to the 10% and 10/40% Suc steps were harvested and centrifuged (50 min at 180,000g). The pellet was resuspended in 1× CIB (deuterium oxide/Ficoll gradient load), layered over a linear 90/2% to 90/30% (w/v) deuterium oxide/Ficoll gradient and centrifuged (12 to 14 h at 80,000g). Fractions containing enriched CCVs (equivalent to ∼14 to 16% [w/w] Suc) were harvested and centrifuged (50 min at 264,000g), resuspended, applied to a 10 to 25% (w/v) linear Suc gradient, and centrifuged (1.5 h at 103,000g). Linear Suc gradient fractions (13 to 17% [w/w] Suc) were pooled and centrifuged (50 min at 264,000g) to yield the final enriched CCV fraction (typical yield: 100 to 300 µg). Note that all steps were performed at 0 to 4°C. A thin layer of CCVs in 2% (w/v) OsO4 was dried onto the surface of a Pioloform-coated 200 mesh Ni grid. Nano-W methylamine tungstate (Nanoprobes) was deposited over the sample and the excess removed with filter paper. Imaging was performed on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope (FEI/Philips Electron Optics) and a MegaViewIII side-mounted digital camera (Olympus) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School EM Facility. Quantitative analysis of CCVs versus uncoated vesicles was performed on randomly selected EM images of negative-stained samples using the ImageJ Cell Counter plug-in (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Coated vesicles represented, on average, 76% ± 10% (n = 11) of the total vesicles counted.
