!~ABS~! We have isolated a combination of high-light and heat-shock (HL + HS) stress-inducible genes, including a NAC transcription factor designated ANAC078. Here we explored the physiological function of ANAC078 under HL stress. Yeast transcription activity assays showed that ANAC078 functions as a transcriptional activator. A fusion protein composed of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and full-length ANAC078 was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, while fusion proteins comprising GFP and ANAC078 deleted of a putative transmembrane motif were found only in the nucleus. In ANAC078-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants (Ox-ANAC078-43), the transcription of 166 genes was up-regulated compared with the levels in wild-type plants under HL (1200 μmol m−2 s−1, 30°C). These genes included some for transcription factors regulating the expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids. Interestingly, the transcript levels of some genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and the levels of anthocyanins were significantly increased in Ox-ANAC078 plants and reduced in knockout ANAC078 plants (KO-ANAC078) compared with wild-type plants under HL stress. The present findings suggest that ANAC078 protein is associated with the induction of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis, leading to the accumulation of anthocyanins, in response to HL stress.
!~RES~! To determine whether ANAC078 acts as a transcriptional activator, we adopted yeast transcription activity assays utilizing full-length (ANAC078full, positions 1–567) or truncated (ANAC0781–539, positions 1–539; ANAC0781–399, positions 1–399; ANAC0781–161, positions 1–161; ANAC078161–399, positions 161–399; ANAC078399–567, positions 399–567) forms of ANAC078, which were expressed fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) in the yeast strain AH109, containing four reporter genes (lacZ, His3, MEL1 and ADE2). GAL4BD–GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) and GAL4BD proteins were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig. 2A).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Judging from the growth of yeast cells on tryptophan, histidine and adenine-lacking plates, the fusion proteins comprising GAL4BD and GAL4AD or ANAC078 (ANAC078full, ANAC0781–539, ANAC0781–399and ANAC078161–399) activated expression of the HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes, while the proteins GAL4BD, GAL4BD–ANAC0781–161 and GAL4BD–ANAC078399–568 did not activate any reporter genes (Fig. 2B). All yeast clones grew equally well on plates containing histidine and adenine (Fig. 2B). The activity of β-galactosidase in yeast cells expressing GAL4BD–ANAC078full, GAL4BD–ANAC0781–539, GAL4BD–ANAC0781–399 and GAL4BD–ANAC078161–399 was ∼6.5-, 6.0-, 13.0- and 13.5-fold higher, respectively, than that in the negative control cells (Fig. 2C). There was no significant difference in activity between the cells expressing GAL4BD–ANAC0781–161 or GAL4BD–ANAC078399–568 and the negative control cells. The ANAC078 protein contained an α-helical transmembrane (TM) motif in the C-terminal region and thus was predicted to be membrane associated (Kim et al. CITATION). To confirm its subcellular distribution, the ANAC078 protein was fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. The fusion protein comprising GFP and full-length ANAC078 (GFP–ANAC078full) was detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A–C), and GFP alone was also detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3J–L). The fusion proteins composed of GFP and ANAC078 deleted of a putative TM motif (GFP–ANAC0781–539 and GFP–ANAC0781–161) were found only in the nucleus (Fig. 3D–I).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To explore the regulatory system for ANAC078, the gene expression in response to HL stress (1200 μmol m−2 s−1, 30°C) was analyzed using an RNA gel-blot. The transcript level of ANAC078 increased within 60 min under HL stress (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the time course of ANAC078 expression was analyzed using the quantitative PCR method. The transcript level of ANAC078 increased rapidly and reached a peak at 60 min under HL stress (Fig. 4B).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To analyze tissue-specific expression of ANAC078, we constructed a chimeric gene consisting of the ANAC078 promoter fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene (pBI/ANAC078pro.-GUS). The ANAC078 promoter included the sequence from −1778 kb upstream to −1 bp downstream of the site of initiation of transcription. Two-week-old wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis (Pro.ANAC078–GUS) plants were exposed to HL stress. RNA gel-blot analysis revealed that the transcript levels of the GUS gene under the control of the ANAC078 promoter and endogenous ANAC078 were clearly increased under HL stress (Fig. 5A).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] GUS activity was detected in the rosette leaves and roots of transgenic Arabidopsis plants grown under normal conditions, while it was more strongly detected in transgenic plants exposed to HL stress (Fig. 5B). However, there was no difference in histochemical localization of GUS activity in the Pro.ANAC078–GUS plants between normal conditions and HL stress. Additionally, GUS activity was detected in the vascular tissues of stems, roots, and leaf veins (Supplementary Fig. S1). To identify the genes targeted by ANAC078, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ANAC078 (Ox-ANAC078-43) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, which was a highly expressed line among >50 independent transformed lines. In the Ox-ANAC078-43 plants, the transcript level of ANAC078 was ∼27-fold higher than that of wild-type plants (Fig. 6). The growth and appearance of the Ox-ANAC078-43 plants were similar to those of wild-type plants under normal conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we conducted a transcriptome analysis of Ox-ANAC078-43 and wild-type plants using a DNA microarray (Agilent Arabidopsis 22K; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at 1 h under HL stress. The transcript levels of 166 genes were increased (>2-fold), while those of 470 genes were decreased (<2-fold) in the Ox-ANAC078-43 plants compared with the wild-type plants (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Most up-regulated genes in the ANAC078 plants were involved in metabolism (17.5%), transcription (12.7%), protein destination (9.6%), and cellular transport and transport mechanisms (8.4%) (Supplementary Fig. S3). Down-regulated genes were involved in metabolism (15.1%), transcription (9.6%), cellular transport and transport mechanisms (8.7%), and cellular communication/signal transduction (7.5%) (Supplementary Fig. S3). In the Ox-ANAC078 plants, the up-regulated genes included those for transcription factors regulating the expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids, such as PAP1, TT1, TT2, AtMYB12 and AtMYB4 (Supplementary Table S1). PAP1 and TT2 encode the R2R3-MYB domain protein and are also called AtMYB75 and AtMYB123, respectively. TT1 encodes the C2H2-type zinc-finger protein. Therefore, we confirmed the transcript levels of five genes in wild-type and Ox-ANAC078-43 plants at 1 h under normal conditions and HL stress using a quantitative PCR method. However, the TT1 transcripts were not detected in wild-type and Ox-ANAC078-43 plants under normal conditions and HL stress (data not shown). There was no significant difference in the transcript level of AtMYB12 between wild-type and Ox-ANAC078-43 plants under HL stress (data not shown). Under normal conditions, the transcription of TT2 was up-regulated in the Ox-ANAC078 plants compared with that in the wild-type plants (Fig. 7). The transcript levels of PAP1, TT2 and AtMYB4 were increased under HL stress in wild-type and Ox-ANAC078-43 plants. Furthermore, transcript levels of PAP1, TT2 and AtMYB4 were higher in Ox-ANAC078-43 plants than wild-type plants.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To clarify in more detail the system by which ANAC078 regulates the biosynthesis of flavonoids, we obtained an Arabidopsis line (KO-ANAC078) containing a T-DNA insert in the second exon of ANAC078 from the SIGnAL project (http://signal.salk.edu/tabout.html). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that insertion of the T-DNA into the gene resulted in a complete loss of ANAC078 expression at the transcriptional level under normal conditions or HL stress (Fig. 6). The growth and appearance of the KO-ANAC078 plants were similar to those of wild-type plants under normal conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2). No significant differences were observed in the transcript levels of PAP1 and AtMYB4 between the wild-type and KO-ANAC078 plants under normal conditions (Fig. 7). The transcript level of TT2 in the KO-ANAC078 plants under normal conditions was lower than that in the wild-type plants. Under HL stress, the transcript levels of PAP1, TT2 and AtMYB4 were significant lower in KO-ANAC078 plants than in wild-type plants Next, we examined the transcript levels of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3′H, DFR and LDOX and for transcription factors regulating the expression of those genes, TT8 [encoding basic helix–loop–helix protein (bHLH)], TTG1 (encoding WDR protein), GLABROUS3 (GL3; encoding bHLH) and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3; encoding bHLH) under normal conditions and HL stress. In the wild-type plants, the transcript levels of CHS, CHI, F3H, F3′H, LDOX, TT8, GL3 and EGL3 were increased under HL stress, while the transcript levels of DFR and TTG1 were not changed. In Ox-ANAC078-43 plants, transcript levels of CHS, F3′H, DFR, LDOX, TT8 and GL3 were higher than those in wild-type plants under normal conditions (Fig. 8). Under HL stress, the transcript levels of CHS, CHI, F3H, F3′H, LDOX, TT8, GL3 and EGL3 in Ox-ANAC078-43 plants were more increased compared with those in the wild-type plants.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] No significant differences were observed in the transcript levels of CHS, CHI, F3H, F3′H, DFR, LDOX, TT8, TTG1, GL3 and EGL3 between the wild-type and KO-ANAC078 plants (Fig. 8). However, the transcript levels of CHI, F3H, F3′H, LDOX, TT8, GL3 and EGL3 were significant lower in KO-ANAC078 plants than wild-type plants under HL stress. Anthocyanins are water-soluble vacuolar pigments that may appear red, purple or blue according to pH and belong to the flavonoids (Nesi et al. CITATION). We analyzed the levels of anthocyanin in wild-type, Ox-ANAC078-43 and KO-ANAC078 plants under normal conditions and HL stress. Under normal conditions, the levels were slightly higher in the Ox-ANAC078-43 plants than wild-type plants (Fig. 9). However, there were no significant differences between wild-type and KO-ANAC078 plants.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] At 2 days under HL stress, the levels of anthocyanins were increased in wild-type, Ox-ANAC078-43 and KO-ANAC078 plants. In Ox-ANAC078-43 plants, the levels were significantly higher than those in the wild-type plants. In contrast, the levels in KO-ANAC078 plants were low compared with those in wild-type plants.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia plants were grown (16 h light, 25°C/8 h dark, 22°C) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium under a light intensity of 100 μmol m−2 s−1. The knockout Arabidopsis lines (Col-0 background) containing a T-DNA insert in the ANAC078 gene [KO-ANAC078 (SALK_025098); from the SIGnAL project (http://signal.salk .edu/tabout.html)] were obtained as pure homozygous lines described previously (Nishizawa et al. CITATION). Two-week-old seedlings were subjected to HL stress (1200 μmol m−2 s−1, 30°C) in a growth cabinet (Biotrom NC350; NK system, Osaka, Japan). Plants were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C The full-length or truncated cDNAs encoding ANAC078 were amplified by RT–PCR using the following primer sets: ANAC078full, full_F, 5′-GAATTCATGGGTCGTGGCTCAGT GAC-3′ (EcoRI) and full_R, 5′-CTCGAGTTACCGAGCAGA CACCATGGTTAC-3′ (XhoI); ANAC0781–539, full_F and ΔTM_R, 5′-CTCGAGCGCCGTAATTCCTGTCTTGCTTCC-3′ (XhoI); ANAC0781–399, full_F and ΔC_R, 5′-CTCGAGCTGGTC AAGGGCTTCTTGGTT-3′ (XhoI); ANAC0781–161, full_F and domain_R, 5′-CTCGAGACCACTTTTCTGGAATATCC-3′ (XhoI); ANAC078161–399, 484_F, 5′-GAATTCACGGGTCCTAA GAATGGGGA-3′ (EcoRI) and ΔC_R; ANAC078399–568, 1198_F, 5′-GAATTCAAACCTGCCCCTAAAGAATT-3′ (EcoRI) and full_R. The amplified fragments were integrated into the EcoRI–XhoI site of pGBKT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, for the production of the fusion protein GAL4BD–ANAC078. pGBKT7 bearing each of the proteins was introduced into the yeast strain AH109, containing four reporter genes (lacZ, His3, ADE2 and MEL1). The transformed yeast cells were selected using synthetic dropout (SD) plates lacking tryptophan, histidine and adenine, at 30°C for 3 d. Simultaneously, the transformed yeast cells were grown on SD plates lacking tryptophan at 30°C for 3 d, and then used for the quantification of β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG; Wako) as substrate. The GFP gene was kindly provided by Dr Y. Niwa (Shizuoka Prefectural University, Shizuoka, Japan). The DNA fragments of ANAC078-linker connecting GFP and GFP-linker connecting ANAC078full were synthesized by PCR using the following primer sets: GFP_F, 5′-TCTAGAATGGTGAGCAAGGG-3′ (XbaI); GFP_R linker, 5′-CGAACGAAGACCTGACTTGT ACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′ (linker sequence underlined); ANAC078_F linker, 5′-TCAGGTCTTCGTTCGATGGGT CGTGGCTCAGTGAC-3′ (linker sequence underlined); ANAC078_R, 5′-GGTACCTTACCGAGCAGACA-3′ (KpnI). The second PCR was performed using the primers GFP_F and ANAC078_R with the DNA fragments of the linker connecting GFP and ANAC078 to amplify the GFP–ANAC078full fusion gene. The GFP–ANAC078full fusion gene was cloned into the XbaI–KpnI site between the CaMV35S promoter and nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator of the pHSG/35S pro.–NOS vector (Nishizawa-Yokoi et al. CITATION), yielding pHSG/35S pro.–GFP–ANAC078full. The fusion constructs comprising GFP and truncated forms of ANAC078 were synthesized by PCR using pHSG/35S pro.–GFP–ANAC078full as the template. They were amplified using the following primer sets: GFP–ANAC0781–539, GFP_F and NAC078ΔTM_R, 5′-GGTACCTTACGCCGTAATTCCTGTCTT-3′ (KpnI); GFP–ANAC0781–161, GFP_F and ANAC078 domain_R, 5′-GGTA CCTTAACCACTTTTCTG-3′ (KpnI). The GFP–ANAC0781–161 or GFP–ANAC0781–539 fusion gene was cloned into the XbaI–KpnI site between the CaMV35S promoter and NOS terminator of the pHSG/35S pro.–NOS vector. These plasmids were bombarded with gold particles (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) into onion epidermal cells as described (Scott et al. CITATION). After incubation for 24 h at 25°C in darkness, the cells were subject to bright-field and fluorescence microscopy (Bio-Rad). The pBI/35S pro.–ANAC078 plasmid was constructed as follows. The coding region of ANAC078 cDNA was amplified by RT–PCR using 5′-CCCTTACTTTCTTCAAGTTC-3′ and 5′-GTCTTTGAGACGATTCAACT-3′. The amplified fragment was integrated into the XbaI–KpnI site between the CaMV35S promoter and the NOS terminator of the plant binary vector pBI121 (Clontech). To examine the tissue- specific expression of ANAC078, the pBI/ANAC078 pro.–GUS construct was obtained by amplifying 1778 bp of the ANAC078 promoter region using primers 5′-GTCGACCT TTGCCAATTCCT-3′ (SalI) and 5′-GGATCCTTTCGTTGTTT ATC-3′ (BamHI) and cloning the amplified DNA into the pBI101.3 vector (Clontech). DNA sequences were confirmed using the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia plants were transformed using Agrobacterium harboring the pBI/35S pro.–ANAC078 and pBI/ANAC078 pro.–GUS constructs. T3 seeds were used for subsequent experiments. Total RNA (20 μg) was prepared from the rosette leaves of Arabidopsis seedlings (1.0 g FW) using Sepasol®–RNAI (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), fractionated in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham). Prehybridization took place at 60°C for 3 h in a buffer containing 6 × standard saline citrate (SSC), 5 × Denhardt’s solution, 1% (w/v) SDS and 100 μg ml−1 of denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes at 60°C for 16 h. The hybridized membrane was washed twice in 2 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 10 min each at room temperature, and in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 60°C for 60 min and autoradiography was carried out with a Mac BAS 1000 (Fuji Photofilm). ANAC078 pro.–GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants were grown (16 h light, 25°C/8 h dark, 22°C) on MS medium under a light intensity of 100 μmol m−2 s−1. Two-week-old ANAC078 pro.–GUS transgenic plants were exposed to 1200 μmol m−2 s−1 of light at 30°C for 1 h. Histochemical localization of the GUS activity in transgenic plants was performed by incubating whole seedlings in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide (X-gluc) buffer [100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 0.5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 0.5 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) methanol and 1.9 mM X-gluc] at 37°C for ∼1 h. The seedlings were washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol until cleared of chlorophyll and then examined using VB-G25 light microscopy (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The microarray analysis was performed using an Agilent Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by the manufacturer. The wild-type and Ox-ANAC078-43 plants were subjected to HL stress as described above. Total RNA was isolated using Sepasol–RNAI from 10–20 wild-type and Ox-ANAC078-43 plants; mRNA was prepared using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The total cDNA probe was synthesized and labeled using a Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Feature extraction software (GeneSpring; Agilent Technologies) was used to locate and delineate every spot in the array and to integrate the intensity, filtering and normalization of each spot. Finally, we selected the genes whose ratio of induction in the Ox-ANAC078-43 plants was >2.0 (up-regulated genes) or <0.5 (down-regulated genes). Following HL stress, total RNA was isolated as described above. To eliminate any DNA, 50 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). The total RNA was purified with an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and converted into cDNA using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with an oligo(dT)20 primer. Primer pairs for quantitative PCR were designed using PRIMER EXPRESS software (Applied Biosystems); primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Gene-specific primers were chosen such that the resulting PCR product was ∼80 bp long. Quantitative PCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR System, using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). Actin2 mRNA, set to 100%, was used as an internal standard in all experiments. Quantitative PCR experiments were repeated at least three times for cDNA prepared for three batches of plants. For the extraction of anthocyanin, Arabidopsis leaves (50–100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer [18% (v/v) 1-propanol and 1% (v/v) concentrated HCl] and shaken for 1 h. The homogenate was boiled in a water bath for 30 min and incubated for 8–10 h at 23°C in darkness. The supernatant absorbance (A535–A650) was quantified spectrophotometrically (PharmaSpec UV-1700; Shimadzu) and the amount of anthocyanin was calculated per g FW. The significance of differences between data sets was evaluated with a t-test. Calculations were carried out with Microsoft Excel software.
