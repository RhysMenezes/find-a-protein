!~ABS~! Obligate biotrophs, such as the powdery mildew pathogens, deliver effectors to the host cell and obtain nutrients from the infection site. The interface between the plant host and the biotrophic pathogen thus represents a major battleground for plant-pathogen interactions. Increasing evidence shows that cellular trafficking plays an important role in plant immunity. Here, we report that Arabidopsis thaliana ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE4 (EDR4) plays a negative role in resistance to powdery mildew and that the enhanced disease resistance in edr4 mutants requires salicylic acid signaling. EDR4 mainly localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. Genetic analyses show that EDR4 and EDR1 function in the same genetic pathway. EDR1 and EDR4 accumulate at the penetration site of powdery mildew infection, and EDR4 physically interacts with EDR1, recruiting EDR1 to the fungal penetration site. In addition, EDR4 interacts with CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN2 (CHC2), and edr4 mutants show reduced endocytosis rates. Taken together, our data indicate that EDR4 associates with CHC2 and modulates plant immunity by regulating the relocation of EDR1 in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! To study the molecular interactions between Arabidopsis and powdery mildew, we previously screened ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized Arabidopsis Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants for enhanced disease resistance to G. cichoracearum (CITATION). Among three mutants identified in this screen, edr2 and edr3 have been described (CITATION, CITATION); here, we describe our characterization of the edr4-1 mutant. The edr4-1 mutants did not show any growth defects under short-day conditions; however, they displayed mild, hypersensitive response-like lesions under long-day conditions at late growth stages (Supplemental Figure 1). To characterize powdery mildew resistance in edr4-1, we infected 4-week-old plants with G. cichoracearum UCSC1 under short-day conditions. The wild-type plants were susceptible and supported abundant conidiophores on their leaves at 8 d after inoculation (DAI). However, the edr4-1 mutants showed fewer conidiophores and massive necrotic lesions on the leaves at 8 DAI (Figures 1A to 1C). To further monitor fungal reproduction, we counted the conidiophores per colony in wild-type and edr4-1 plants. As shown in Figure 1D, significantly fewer conidiophores were produced on edr4-1 leaves than on wild-type leaves at 6 DAI, indicating that the growth of powdery mildew fungus was inhibited in the edr4-1 mutant. [[FIGURE]] Activation of plant defenses often involves the production of H2O2 and the deposition of callose. To examine whether edr4-1 mutants accumulate more H2O2 than the wild type after infection, we used 3,3â€²-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB) to stain infected leaves at 2 DAI with G. cichoracearum. The edr4-1 mutants showed more pronounced H2O2 accumulation in the infection site than did wild-type plants (Figure 1E; Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B). To monitor callose deposition in wild-type and edr4-1 mutant plants, we performed aniline blue staining on the infected leaves at 2 DAI and found that the edr4-1 mutants showed more callose deposition at the infection site than the wild type (Figure 1F; Supplemental Figures 2C and 2D). To investigate whether the edr4-1 mutation affects the expression of defense-related genes, we examined the transcript levels of PR1, PR2, and PR5 in wild-type and edr4-1 mutant plants at different time points after G. cichoracearum infection using real-time PCR. Both the wild type and edr4-1 showed relatively low accumulation of PR1, PR2, and PR5 transcripts before infection. The transcript levels of PR genes increased after inoculation in both the wild type and edr4-1, but significantly more transcripts of PR genes accumulated in edr4-1 plants than in wild-type plants at 1 and 3 DAI (Figures 1G to 1I). These observations indicate that the edr4-1 mutants induced the defense response more rapidly than the wild-type plants did. SA, jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene signaling pathways play important roles in plant defense responses. To examine whether those pathways affect edr4-1-mediated resistance, we constructed double mutants and assessed whether mutations in those pathways alter powdery mildew resistance in edr4-1. The npr1 mutation, which disrupts SA perception, and the pad4, eds1, eds5, and sid2 mutations, which reduce levels of pathogen-induced SA, suppressed edr4-1-mediated enhanced resistance to powdery mildew and mildew-induced cell death (Figure 2A; Supplemental Figure 3). By contrast, mutations in EIN2 or COI1 blocked the ethylene response or the JA response, respectively, and did not affect edr4-1 resistance and mildew-induced cell death (Figure 2A; Supplemental Figure 3). These data indicate that edr4-1-mediated resistance and mildew-induced cell death phenotypes are SA-dependent but ethylene- and JA-independent. [[FIGURE]] To further assess the role of SA in edr4-1-mediated resistance, we measured SA levels in the wild type and edr4-1 before and after infection with G. cichoracearum. In the absence of pathogen, the edr4-1 mutants and wild-type plants had similar levels of free and total SA; by contrast, at 3 DAI, SA accumulated at much higher levels in edr4-1 than in the wild type (Figure 2B). These data indicate that higher SA levels in edr4-1 mutants cause the enhanced disease resistance and mildew-induced cell death. The edr4-1 mutation was identified by standard map-based cloning (Supplemental Figure 4A). A C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1213 in At5g05190 was found in edr4-1, and this transition causes an early stop (Q405STOP) in the predicted protein sequence (Supplemental Figure 4A). To confirm that At5g05190 is EDR4, a genomic clone of At5g05190 was transformed into edr4-1 plants. Among 25 transgenic plants obtained, 22 displayed the wild-type, susceptible phenotype at 8 DAI when infected with G. cichoracearum, indicating that the At5g05190 genomic clone complemented the edr4-1 phenotype (Supplemental Figures 4B and 4C). As an additional confirmation, we also examined the phenotypes of two T-DNA insertion lines of At5g05190, SALK_048465 (edr4-2) and SALK_009370 (edr4-3) (Supplemental Figure 4A). No full-length transcript of At5g05190 could be detected in edr4-1 or in these two lines, indicating that the expression of EDR4 is disrupted in these three mutant lines (Supplemental Figure 4D). These two mutants showed enhanced disease resistance and mildew-induced cell death upon powdery mildew infection at 8 DAI, which was very similar to the phenotype of edr4-1 (Supplemental Figures 4B and 4C). Taken together, these data indicate that At5g05190 is the gene responsible for the edr4-1 phenotypes; therefore, we designate At5g05190 as EDR4. EDR4 encodes a protein of 615 amino acids with no assigned function, and no clear EDR4 homolog could be identified in the Arabidopsis genome. A search for motifs in the primary sequence of EDR4, using the Eukaryotic Linear Motif server (http://elm.eu.org/) (CITATION), identified three types of structural elements in EDR4: a coiled-coil (CC) domain, four low-complexity regions (LCR), and a Duf3133 domain of unknown function (Supplemental Figure 4E). The CC domain and LCRs often function as protein interaction domains for a wide variety of proteins (CITATION; CITATION). To investigate the subcellular localization of EDR4, we made a fusion of EDR4 to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), expressed it from the pEDR4-EDR4-eGFP construct (EDR4-GFP), and transformed it into edr4-1 mutant plants. EDR4-GFP was expressed as a full-length protein and complemented the edr4-1 phenotypes, indicating that EDR4-GFP was functional (Supplemental Figure 5). A representative homozygous edr4-1 EDR4-GFP transgenic line was chosen to examine EDR4 localization. In root tip cells of 5-d-old seedlings, time-lapse analysis revealed that EDR4-GFP displayed dynamic intracellular movement, which partially overlapped with FM4-64 (Supplemental Figure 6A and Supplemental Movie 1). EDR4-GFP appears to localize on the plasma membrane and on dot-like intracellular structures in the cytosol. To determine the subcellular localization of EDR4, we assessed the colocalization of EDR4-GFP with several organelle markers, including mCherry-SYP61 (TGN/EE), ARA6-mCherry (late endosome), SYP32-mCherry (cis-Golgi), and HDEL-mCherry (ER) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION; CITATION), and examined EDR4-GFP in root tips of transgenic plants. Microscopy and quantification analysis showed that a large portion of EDR4-GFP protein overlapped with the TGN/EE marker SYP61, the late endosome marker ARA6, and the cis-Golgi marker SYP32, but a smaller portion of EDR4-GFP overlapped with the ER marker HDEL (Figures 3A to 3E). Taken together, these data indicate that EDR4 mainly localizes at the plasma membrane and in endosomal compartments and displays dynamic movement in cells. [[FIGURE]] We further examined the subcellular localization of EDR4 in epidermal cells after G. cichoracearum infection using the EDR4-GFP transgenic line. The GFP signal was observed in epidermal cells in uninfected leaves (Figure 4A) and also showed intracellular movement (Supplemental Figure 6B and Supplemental Movie 2). At 48 h after inoculation (HAI) with G. cichoracearum, EDR4-GFP accumulated under the penetration peg at the infection site in epidermal cells (Figure 4B), but overall, the EDR4-GFP protein levels decreased at 72 HAI with G. cichoracearum (Figure 4C). To further confirm the accumulation of EDR4-GFP at the site of infection, we also examined EDR4-GFP localization at 24 HAI, with the cis-Golgi-localized protein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (NAG) fused to GFP (CITATION) as a control. Fungal structures were labeled with propidium iodide. We found that EDR4-GFP accumulated at penetration sites at 24 HAI (Figures 4D and 4E), while there was no obvious difference in the subcellular localization of NAG-GFP before and after inoculation (Supplemental Figure 7). To determine whether EDR4 accumulates at the plasma membrane or papillae at the penetration site after infection, we used plasmolysis of infected leaves at 24 HAI. As shown in Supplemental Figure 8A, EDR4-GFP accumulated in the plasma membrane but not in papillae. [[FIGURE]] To further characterize the edr4-1 mutant, we crossed edr4-1 with edr1 and edr2, two well-characterized powdery mildew resistance mutants, and examined the phenotypes of the double mutants. The edr2 edr4-1 mutant showed more cell death and fewer fungal spores than the edr2 and edr4-1 single mutants, indicating that the edr2 mutation enhanced the edr4-1 phenotype. However, the edr1, edr4-1, and edr1 edr4-1 mutants showed no significant differences in growth of fungal spores (Supplemental Figure 9). A missense mutation in KEG (keg-4) suppressed the edr1 phenotype (CITATION). To further examine the relationship between EDR1 and EDR4, we crossed edr1, edr4-1, and edr1 edr4-1 with keg-4 and generated double and triple mutants. The keg-4 mutation suppressed the enhanced disease resistance of edr4 and edr1 edr4-1 mutants (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that edr4-mediated resistance also requires KEG. Previous work showed that keg-4 suppresses edr1-mediated resistance, but not edr2-mediated resistance, indicating that keg-4 specifically suppresses edr1 (CITATION). The observations that keg-4 suppressed edr4-1 and edr1 edr4-1, and that edr1, edr4-1, and edr1 edr4-1 displayed similar levels of resistance, suggest that EDR1, EDR4, and KEG act in the same genetic pathway. Consistent with this notion, MPK3 and MPK6 kinase activation increased in edr4-1 mutants upon infection by G. cichoracearum, and mpk3, mkk4, and mkk5 mutations also suppressed powdery mildew resistance in edr4-1 (Supplemental Figure 10), similar to the edr1 mutant (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Since edr1 and edr4-1 displayed similar powdery mildew resistance, and EDR1, EDR4, and KEG may act in the same genetic pathway, we hypothesized that EDR4 may associate with EDR1 to modulate plant immunity. To test this hypothesis, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays to examine whether EDR4 interacts with EDR1 and KEG. EDR4 could interact with the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1 to 657) of EDR1 and full-length EDR1 but not with the C-terminal domain of EDR1 (amino acids 658 to 933) or with KEG (Figure 6A; Supplemental Figure 11). To determine which domain of EDR4 is responsible for the interaction with EDR1, we conducted a deletion analysis of EDR4 and examined the interactions of the deleted variants by yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in Figure 6A, a variant of EDR4 with only the CC domain (amino acids 1 to 149) could interact with EDR1, while the LCR, Duf3133 domain, or CC domain deletion form of EDR4 could not interact with EDR1. These data indicate that the CC domain of EDR4 is necessary and sufficient for interaction with EDR1. [[FIGURE]] To further confirm the interactions of EDR1 and EDR4, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) by fusing EDR1, EDR4, and EDR4 deletion forms or KEG to the N- or C-terminal fragment of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) and transiently expressing those constructs in N. benthamiana leaves. We observed reconstituted YFP fluorescence in leaves cotransformed with 35S-driven YN-EDR1 and YC-KEG, as well as YN-EDR1 and YC-EDR4 or the YC-CC-EDR4 domain, but not in leaves cotransformed with YN-KEG and YC-EDR4 or other YC-EDR4 deletions (Figure 6B; Supplemental Figure 12), indicating that the EDR4 CC domain interacts with EDR1 in N. benthamiana, consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid assays. To validate the interaction of EDR4 and EDR1, we also performed coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays in stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants. We crossed EDR4-GFP plants with plants expressing EDR1-FLAG driven by the native EDR1 promoter and used the F2 plants that express both EDR4-GFP and EDR1-FLAG in Co-IP assays, with plants that expressed both EDR1-FLAG and GFP as a negative control. We extracted total protein and immunoprecipitated EDR1 using anti-FLAG antibody and then detected the presence or absence of EDR4 with anti-GFP antibody. EDR4 was detected only in the precipitates of leaves that express EDR1-FLAG and EDR4-GFP but not in the negative control plants (Figure 6C), indicating that EDR4 interacts with EDR1 in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these observations indicate that EDR4 interacts with EDR1. Since EDR1 interacts with EDR4, we then examined whether EDR4 colocalizes with EDR1. We first transiently expressed EDR4-GFP and EDR1-mCherry in N. benthamiana leaves. EDR1 appears to colocalize with EDR4 in the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments (Supplemental Figures 13A and 13B). We then examined transgenic plants that coexpressed EDR4-GFP and EDR1-mCherry. Similarly, EDR4-GFP and EDR1-mCherry colocalized in endosomal compartments in root cells (Supplemental Figure 13C). Since EDR1 interacts with EDR4, we next examined whether EDR1 and EDR4 have similar localization patterns. EDR1 also shows dynamic intracellular movement (Supplemental Figure 6C and Supplemental Movie 3). As EDR4 accumulated at powdery mildew infection sites, we then examined whether EDR1 also accumulates at infection sites and whether the edr4-1 mutation affects this localization. We thus crossed the EDR1-GFP transgenic plant with the edr4-1 mutant to generate edr4-1 EDR1-GFP plants. We did not observe an obvious difference in EDR1-GFP localization in wild-type and edr4-1 backgrounds in the absence of powdery mildew pathogen (Supplemental Figure 14A). Upon infection, EDR1-GFP also accumulated at the infection site at 24 HAI in wild type leaves; however, EDR1-GFP accumulated at much lower levels at infection sites in edr4-1 leaves (Figures 7A and 7B). To quantify the level of accumulation of EDR1-GFP, we calculated the frequency of focal accumulations of EDR1-GFP at infection sites in wild-type and edr4-1 plants according to the previously described method (CITATION). As shown in Figure 7C, the frequency of focal accumulations of EDR1-GFP in edr4-1 mutants was much lower than in the wild type, indicating that the edr4-1 mutation compromised the accumulation of EDR1-GFP at the fungal infection site. Similar to EDR4-GFP, plasmolysis analysis showed that EDR1-GFP also accumulated at the plasma membrane, not in papillae, after infection with G. cichoracearum (Supplemental Figure 8B). Taken together, our data suggested that EDR1 moves to the plasma membrane around powdery mildew infection sites and that EDR4 plays an important role in EDR1 relocation. [[FIGURE]] As the CC domain of EDR4 is necessary for interaction with EDR1, we examined whether EDR1 localization was affected in the EDR4 CC domain deletion background. We made an EDR4-CC-domain deletion-FLAG construct and transformed it alone or with the pEDR1-EDR1-GFP construct into edr4-2. The EDR4-CC-domain deletion-FLAG construct did not complement the edr4-2 phenotype, indicating that EDR4 function requires the CC domain (Supplemental Figure 15). We also compared EDR1 localization in wild-type, edr4-2, and edr4-2 EDR4-CC-domain deletion plants after powdery mildew infection. The localization of EDR1-GFP in the edr4-2 and edr4-2 EDR4-CC-domain deletion background was similar, as both show defects in focal accumulation to the site of mildew infection (Supplemental Figure 16), indicating that the EDR4-CC-domain deletion construct could not function as the full-length EDR4 protein. To examine whether edr1 affected EDR4 localization, we examined EDR4-GFP localization in wild-type and edr1 plants after powdery mildew infection at 24 HAI. EDR4-GFP accumulated at the infection site in wild-type and edr1 plants, and no significant difference was observed between the wild type and edr1, indicating that edr1 did not affect the localization of EDR4 (Supplemental Figure 17). To examine whether powdery mildew triggers continuous accumulation of EDR1 and EDR4, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (CITATION) of EDR1-GFP and EDR4-GFP leaves at G. cichoracearum penetration sites and distal membrane sites. At the penetration site, the EDR1-GFP signal recovered to less than 40% in 60 min, compared with before bleaching, and EDR4-GFP displayed a similar pattern, recovering to less than 20% in 60 min (Supplemental Figures 18A and 18C). By contrast, at a distal membrane site, the EDR1-GFP and EDR4-GFP signals showed rapid recovery (within 15 min) after bleaching (Supplemental Figures 18B and 18D). These data suggested that EDR1 and EDR4 proteins were not continuously delivered to penetration sites but were delivered one time and retained at these sites. These results are comparable to previous findings that focal accumulations of PEN1 and PEN3 after B. graminis f sp hordei infection result from single delivery events rather than continuous delivery (CITATION; CITATION). The CITATION reported that EDR4 could interact with CHC2, a major component of clathrin-coated vesicles in CME and clathrin-mediated pathways in yeast two-hybrid assays. To confirm the interactions between CHC2 and EDR4 in planta, we performed BiFC assays using N. benthamiana. As shown in Figure 8A, we observed YFP signal in leaves coexpressing CHC2 and full-length EDR4, the EDR4 CC domain, or the EDR4 LCR domain but not the EDR4 Duf3133 domain, confirming that EDR4 interacts with CHC2 and that the CC and LCR domains may be responsible for this interaction. The interaction between EDR4 and CHC2 suggested that EDR4 could function in clathrin-mediated pathways. To further confirm the interaction between EDR4 and CHC2, we performed Co-IP assays in stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants. We crossed EDR4-GFP plants with plants expressing MYC-N-CHC2 driven by the 35S promoter and used the F2 plants that expressed both EDR4-GFP and MYC-N-CHC2 in Co-IP assays, with plants that expressed only MYC-N-CHC2 as a negative control. CHC2 was only detected in the precipitates of leaves that express EDR4-GFP and MYC-N-CHC2 but not in the negative control plants (Figure 8B), indicating that EDR4 interacts with CHC2 in Arabidopsis. [[FIGURE]] The chc2 mutants display reduced endocytosis rates, as measured by uptake of the endocytic tracer dye FM4-64 (CITATION). To assess whether EDR4 also functions in endocytosis, we performed FM4-64 uptake tests on wild-type, edr4-1, and edr4-2 plants, using chc2-1 as an endocytosis-deficient control. The intracellular accumulation of FM4-64 showed clear labeling of endosomes in the wild type within 8 min; however, edr4-1, edr4-2, and chc2-1 mutants showed much less labeling at the same time (Figures 9A and 9B), indicating that edr4 mutants show reduced endocytosis rates. By contrast, we did not observe any difference in FM4-64 uptake between the wild type and edr1 mutants (Supplemental Figure 19). To examine whether CHC2 affects powdery mildew resistance, we infected the chc2-1 and chc2-2 mutants with G. cichoracearum. The chc2-1 and chc2-2 mutants supported significantly less fungal growth than the wild type, although the resistance in chc2-1 and chc2-2 mutants was not as strong as in the edr4-1 mutant (Figures 9C and 9D). In addition, the chc2-1 and chc2-2 mutants showed higher H2O2 and callose accumulation and stronger activation of MPKs than the wild type (Supplemental Figure 20). The callose accumulation and activation of MPKs in chc2-1 and chc2-2 were similar to those in edr4-1, but the accumulation of H2O2 was significantly lower than that observed in edr4-1 mutants (Supplemental Figure 20). Taken together, our data indicated that CHC2 contributes to powdery mildew resistance. [[FIGURE]] As the chc2 mutants displayed an edr4-like phenotype, and CHC2 interacts with EDR4, we then asked whether CHC2 contributes to the relocation of EDR1 and EDR4 upon powdery mildew infection. To address this question, we transformed EDR1-GFP and EDR4-GFP constructs into chc2-1, to generate chc2-1 EDR1-GFP and chc2-1 EDR4-GFP transgenic plants. We then examined the localization of EDR1-GFP and EDR4-GFP in the chc2-1 mutant. The localization of EDR1-GFP and EDR4-GFP was similar in wild-type and chc2-1 plants before powdery mildew infection (Supplemental Figures 14B and 14C). However, both EDR1-GFP and EDR4-GFP accumulated at much lower levels at infection sites in chc2-1 than wild-type leaves at 24 HAI (Figures 9E and 9G). Quantification analysis also confirmed those results (Figures 9F and 9H).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface-sterilized and chilled at 4Â°C for 3 d, then sown on plates containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 1% sucrose. For phenotyping, plants were grown in a growth room with a 9-h-light/15-h-dark photoperiod, light intensity of 7000 to 8000 lux, and relative humidity of 50 to 60% at 21 to 24Â°C. Seedlings were transplanted into soil 7 d after germination. For seed set, the plants were placed in a growth room at 21 to 24Â°C with a long-day photoperiod (16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle). Nicotiana benthamiana plants used for transient expression were grown under the same short-day conditions as Arabidopsis. Four-week-old plants were inoculated with Golovinomyces cichoracearum, and the number of conidiophores per colony was counted at 6 DAI, as described previously (CITATION). Trypan blue staining was used to monitor the fungal structures and dead plant cells (CITATION). H2O2 accumulation was detected by staining with DAB (CITATION), and callose deposition was detected by aniline blue staining (CITATION). Quantitative analysis of callose and H2O2 accumulation followed the method described previously (CITATION; CITATION). The samples were observed and photographed with an Olympus BX53 microscope. Double and triple mutants were created by standard genetic crosses with previously described mutant alleles, including eds1-2 (CITATION), eds5-1 (CITATION), pad4-1 (CITATION), npr1-63 (CITATION), coi1-1 (CITATION), ein2-1 (CITATION), sid2-2 (CITATION), edr1 (CITATION), edr1-2 (CITATION), edr2 (CITATION), keg-4 (CITATION), chc2-1 and chc2-2 (CITATION), mpk3-1 and mpk6-3 (CITATION), and mkk4-18 and mkk5-18 (CITATION). All the plants used were in the Col-0 background, except for coi1-1 (in the Columbia-6 background). The genotypes of mutants were confirmed by PCR using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 1. To map EDR4, edr4-1 was crossed with Landsberg erecta to generate a segregating population. Initially, the edr4-1 mutation was mapped between markers CTR1 and CIW14 on chromosome 5. Fine-mapping narrowed the mutation to a 50-kb interval spanning the 3â€² end of BAC clone K2A11 (GenBank accession number AB018111.1) and the 5â€² end of BAC K18I23 (GenBank accession number AB010692.1). We subsequently amplified and sequenced all 19 predicted genes in this region. For complementation analysis, a 5.0-kb genomic DNA of At5g05190 from the wild type was amplified and inserted into the pCAMBIA1300 vector. The constructs were verified by sequencing and introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101, then transformed into edr4-1 plants using the floral dip method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 50 mg/L hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Transformants were transplanted to soil 7 d after germination, and T1 transgenic plants were used for phenotyping. The primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Real-time PCR to measure transcript accumulation was performed as described (CITATION). SA extraction and measurement were performed as described (CITATION). To produce the pEDR4-EDR4-GFP construct, the genomic sequence or coding sequence (CDS) without the stop codon of EDR4 was amplified (primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1) and cloned into the Gateway entry vector pDONR207 using the BP Clonase kit (Invitrogen). The fragment was then cloned into pMDC107 with the LR Clonase kit (Invitrogen). The constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 and then transformed into the edr4-1 mutant. Similarly, Î”CC-EDR4 (CC domain deletion) was cloned into pEarleyGate302 vector with EDR4 promoter and C-terminal FLAG fusion. The pEDR1-EDR1-GFP (CITATION) and NAG-GFP (CITATION) lines were described previously. The TGN/EE and late endosome markers SYP61 and ARA6 (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION) were introduced into EDR4-GFP plants by transformation, respectively. The ER marker line expressing HDEL-mCherry and the cis-Golgi marker line expressing SYP32-mCherry (CITATION; CITATION) were introduced into EDR4-GFP plants by genetic crosses. Confocal imaging was performed on an inverted Zeiss LSM 710 NLO microscope with ZEN 2009 software. Quantification of colocalization was performed as described previously (CITATION). To visualize fungal structures, the infected leaves were stained with 0.01 mg/mL propidium iodide for 15 min (CITATION). Calculating the focal accumulations of EDR1-GFP upon powdery mildew infection was performed as described previously (CITATION). FRAP assays were performed on a region of focal accumulation or a distal plasma membrane site as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, Arabidopsis leaves were bleached using the 488-nm argon laser line 50 times at 100% intensity. Images were collected 2 min before bleaching and at different time points after bleaching. Fluorescence intensity at each time point for each bleached site was determined using ImageJ software. Relative intensity values were normalized based on focal accumulation before and after bleaching. The FM4-64 uptake assay was performed as described previously, with minor changes (CITATION). Five-day-old seedlings were incubated with 2 Î¼M FM4-64 for 8 min. The roots of seedlings were observed by confocal microscopy. The mean pixel intensity of the cytosolic side of cells and the adjacent plasma membrane was measured with ImageJ. Then, the quotients of values for the cytosolic side and the plasma membrane were calculated. The plasmolysis assay was performed as described previously (CITATION). For plasmolysis observation, Arabidopsis leaves infected with G. cichoracearum at 24 HAI were soaked in 0.85 M NaCl for 15 min and then observed by confocal microscopy. Total protein from leaves was extracted as described (CITATION). The activated MAPKs were detected using anti-pTEpY primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). CDSs of EDR1, EDR1 N-terminal domain, and EDR1 C-terminal domain were cloned into pGBKT7 (CITATION). CDSs of KEG, EDR4, and deletion variants of EDR4 were amplified and ligated into pGADT7. The CDS of EDR4 was also cloned into pGBKT7. The plasmids were cotransformed into yeast strain Y190, and positive clones were selected on SD/-Leu/-Trp medium and then verified by PCR amplification of both cotransformed genes. Verified clones were selected on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His medium with 25 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with 40 Î¼g/mL X-Gal (Clontech) to determine Î²-galactosidase activity. 35S-YN-EDR1 was described previously (CITATION). To generate 35S-YC fusion constructs, CDSs of KEG, EDR4, and the deletion variants of EDR4 were cloned into pSY735 (CITATION) in frame with YFPC. Then, the fusion sequences were amplified and cloned into the binary vector pMDC32. Similarly, to generate 35S-YN-N-CHC2 and 35S-YN-KEG, CDSs of CHC2 (encoding the N-terminal domain amino acids 1 to 1016 of CHC2) and KEG were first cloned into pSY736 in frame with YFPN and then cloned into pMDC32. The plasmid was subsequently introduced into Agrobacterium strain GV3101. Reconstitution of YFP fluorescence was examined by transient coexpression in 4-week-old N. benthamiana by infiltration with Agrobacterium strain GV3101 carrying different YFPN and YFPC pairs, as described (CITATION). Samples were observed by confocal microscopy 2 DAI. For EDR1 and EDR4 Co-IP assays in Arabidopsis, transgenic edr1 plants expressing pEDR1-EDR1-FLAG (CITATION) were crossed with edr4-1 plants expressing pEDR4-EDR4-GFP or 35S-GFP. The leaf samples were from 4-week-old F2 plants expressing both EDR1-FLAG and EDR4-GFP or F1 plants expressing EDR1-FLAG and GFP. For CHC2 and EDR4 Co-IP assays in Arabidopsis, CDS of CHC2 (encoding the N-terminal domain amino acids 1 to 1016 of CHC2) was cloned into pEarleyGate203 vector with the 35S promoter and N-terminal MYC tag. The derived 35S-MYC-N-CHC2 construct was transformed into Col-0 plants, and the transgenic plants were then crossed with EDR4-GFP plants. The leaves from 4-week-old F2 plants expressing both MYC-N-CHC2 and EDR4-GFP or MYC-N-CHC2 were used for Co-IP assays. The protein was extracted using NB1 buffer plus 0.2% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich) (CITATION), and Co-IP assays were performed as described previously (CITATION). Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GenBank/EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: EDR4 (AT5G05190), SYP32 (AT3G24350), SYP61 (AT1G28490), ARA6 (AT3G54840), PEN1 (AT3G11820), EDR1 (AT1G08720), KEG (AT5G13530), CHC2 (AT3G08530), ACT2 (AT3G18780), PR1 (AT2G14610), PR2 (AT3G57260), and PR5 (AT1G75040).
