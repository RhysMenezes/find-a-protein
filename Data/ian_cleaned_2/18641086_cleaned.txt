!~ABS~! Prenylation is a posttranslational protein modification essential for developmental processes and response to abscisic acid. Following prenylation, the three C-terminal residues are proteoliticaly removed and in turn the free carboxyl group of the isoprenyl cysteine is methylated. The proteolysis and methylation, collectively referred to as CaaX processing, are catalyzed by Ste24 endoprotease or Rce1 endoprotease and by an isoprenyl cysteine methyltransferase (ICMT). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains single STE24 and RCE1 and two ICMT homologs. Here we show that in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) AtRCE1 promoted a-mating factor secretion and membrane localization of a ROP GTPase. Furthermore, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins of AtSTE24, AtRCE1, AtICMTA, and AtICMTB are colocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that prenylated proteins reach this compartment and that CaaX processing is likely required for subcellular targeting. AtICMTB can process yeast a-factor more efficiently than AtICMTA. Sequence and mutational analyses revealed that the higher activity AtICMTB is conferred by five residues, which are conserved between yeast Ste14p, human ICMT, and AtICMTB but not in AtICMTA. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and microarray data show that AtICMTA expression is significantly lower compared to AtICMTB. AtICMTA null mutants have a wild-type phenotype, indicating that its function is redundant. However, AtICMT RNAi lines had fasciated inflorescence stems, altered phylotaxis, and developed multiple buds without stem elongation. The phenotype of the ICMT RNAi lines is similar to farnesyltransferase β-subunit mutant enhanced response to abscisic acid2 but is more subtle. Collectively, the data suggest that AtICMTB is likely the major ICMT and that methylation modulates activity of prenylated proteins.
!~RES~! RCE1 is considered as the major CaaX protease. The function of AtRCE1 was tested by complementation in yeast using pheromone diffusion halo assays (Supplemental Fig. S2; CITATION). This assay can be used to quantitatively evaluate CaaX processing efficiency in vivo since the size of the growth inhibition halos correspond to the efficiency of a-factor processing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). AtRCE1 complemented a-factor secretion in ste24Δ rce1Δ double-mutant yeast strain (JRY6959) when expressed from a 2μ high-copy-number plasmid (Fig. 1 ). Unlike Ste24, Rce1 can only catalyze CaaX proteolysis but not the additional proteolytic step required for maturation and of a-factor and its efficient secretion (Supplemental Fig. S2; CITATION; CITATION). The halos that formed around the AtRCE1-expressing ste24Δ rce1Δ cells (SYY563) were smaller compared to the halos that formed around the SYY500 AtSTE24-expressing ste24Δ rce1Δ cells (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that a-factor secretion was indeed less efficient. The halos that formed around Ste24 Rce1 wild-type cells (JRY6958) were bigger than either AtSTE24- or AtRCE1-complemented cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that a-factor processing by neither plant CaaX proteases was as efficient as by yeast Ste24. These data corroborated functional analysis of AtRCE1 function in vitro (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether AtRCE1 can process plant target proteins, we created a yeast strain in which AtRCE1 and GFP-AtROP9 (GFP-AtRAC7) were coexpressed in ste24Δ rce1Δ mutant background (SYY569; Fig. 2 ). AtROP9 (AtRAC7) is a type-II ROP/RAC GTPase that is farnesylated in yeast (CITATION). In wild-type Ste24 Rce1 background (SYY538), GFP-AtROP9 was localized in the plasma membrane and endomembrane (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in ste24Δ rce1Δ double-mutant background (SYY542), GFP-AtROP9 was only localized in the endomembrane fraction (Fig. 2B). Coexpression of AtRCE1 (SYY569) restored plasma membrane localization of GFP-ROP9, confirming that AtRCE1 processed AtROP9 (Fig. 2C). The nonprenylated GFP:Atrop9mS mutant in which the prenyl acceptor Cys was mutated to Ser was dispersed in the cytoplasm following expression in Ste24 Rce1 wild-type cells (SYY539; Fig. 2D). These data show that prenylation promotes association of proteins with the endomembrane system, while CaaX processing is required for subcellular targeting. [[FIGURE]] We have previously demonstrated that AtSTE24 is localized in the ER (CITATION) and that ICMTA is localized in endomembranes (CITATION). If in plants too prenylated proteins reach the ER, where they undergo CaaX processing, AtRCE1, ICMTA, and ICMTB should also be localized in the ER. To test this assumption, the subcellular localization of AtRCE1, AtICMTA, and AtICMTB was determined. Following transient expression, AtICMTA, AtICMTB, and AtRCE1 GFP fusion proteins had typical to ER, reticulate, and perinuclear subcellular distribution patterns (Fig. 3, A, E, and I ; Supplemental Fig. S3, B, D, E, and G). Colocalization analysis of AtICMTA, AtICMTB, and AtRCE1 together with the ER marker ER-mCherry (CITATION) were carried out to confirm the ER localization. The results (Fig. 3, B–D, F–H, and J–L) show that fusion proteins of all three CaaX processing enzymes were colocalized with the marker confirming their ER localization. Colocalization of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-AtICMTA with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-AtSTE24 and of YFP-ICMTA with CFP-AtRCE1 was used to further confirm the ER colocalization of the CaaX processing enzymes in the ER (Supplemental Fig. S3, A–F). [[FIGURE]] Based on its reversibility, the isoprenyl carboxy methylation step has been suggested to play a regulatory role (CITATION). Recently, a prenyl Cys methylesterase has been identified in Arabidopsis (CITATION), suggesting that methylation/demethylation cycles of prenylated proteins may regulate their function. This has prompted us to study the role of prenyl Cys methytransferases and their function in Arabidopsis In vitro, AtICMTB/AtSTE14B (At5g08335) was shown to be more active than AtICMTA/AtSTE14A (At5g23320; CITATION). Sequence comparison highlighted five amino acids that are conserved between AtICMTB and yeast Ste14p and differ in AtICMTA (Fig. 4A , red rectangles). These residues include: K154 and K155 in Ste14p and R111 and R112 in AtICMTB, D208 in Ste14p and E165 in AtICMTB, N230 and K231 in Ste14p, and Q187 and R188 in AtICMTB. Interestingly, these residues are also structurally conserved in human (HsICMT) and moss Physcomitrella patens (PpICMT) ICMT proteins (Fig. 4A). Hydropathy plot analysis showed that AtICMTB and AtICMTA have six to eight transmembrane helices and that their overall topology is similar to Ste14p (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, all the five residues that are conserved between AtICMTB and Ste14p, HsICMT and PpICMT, and differ in AtICMTA are located on hydrophylic domains (Fig. 4B, asterisks), which were shown to be essential for Ste14p activity (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Pheromone diffusion halo assays were carried out to compare the activities of AtICMTA and AtICMTB in yeast and whether differences in their ability to process a-factor correspond to the structural conservation between AtICMTB and Ste14p (Fig. 5 ). The halos that formed around ste14Δ mutant cells that expressed AtICMTB from a 2μ high-copy-number plasmid (SYY564) were larger than the halos that formed around ste14Δ cells that expressed AtICMTA (SYY526) that are comparable in size to the halos that formed around wild-type Ste14 cells (Fig. 5, A–C). When AtICMTB was expressed from a single-copy CEN plasmid (SYY565), the halo size was smaller, indicating that methylation of a-factor by AtICMTB was less efficient than by yeast Ste14. An AtICMTA mutant, AticmtAmR111R112E165Q187R188, harboring point mutations that converted five amino acids to their corresponding residues in AtICMTB (N111/R, Y112/R, Q165/E, E187/Q, and S188/R) was created. The halos that formed around ste14Δ cells that expressed AticmtAmR111R112E165Q187R188 (SYY579 and SYY578) were comparable to the halos that formed around AtICMTB-expressing cells (Fig. 5, D and F). Halo sizes were calculated relative to wild-type Ste14 cells, average size of which was taken as 1. The average halo size around AtICMTA-complemented cells (when expressed from a 2μ plasmid) was 0.57 of wild-type Ste14 cells with a se of ±0.09. The average halo sizes around AtICMTB- and AticmtAmR111R112E165Q187R188-complemented cells (expressed from 2μ plasmids) were 1.05 ± 0.07 and 0.96 ± 0.06, respectively. These results indicated that the a-factor was processed at similar efficiencies by AtICMTB and the mutant AticmtAmR111R112E165Q187R188 and confirmed that the reduced activity of AtICMTA results from changes in structurally conserved residues rather than technical problems of the experimental setup. Interestingly, activity of the AticmtAmE165 single mutant and the AticmtAmR111R112E165 triple mutant was similar to wild-type AtICMTA (data not shown), suggesting that all five residues are critical for efficient ICMT activity. [[FIGURE]] Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) experiments showed that AtICMTB was expressed at significantly higher levels compared to AtICMTA (Fig. 6A ). The Q-PCR data were corroborated by examining microarray expression data using Genevestigator (CITATION; CITATION; Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S4). The microarray data show that expression of ICMTA is low in most tissues and throughout development and that in all cases the expression of ICMTB is higher. The Q-PCR analyses showed that AtRCE1 is expressed at similar levels to AtICMTB (Fig. 6A). Unfortunately, AtRCE1 (At2G36305) is currently not represented on the ATH1 Affymetrix microarray chips and thus whole-genome analysis of its expression is currently unavailable. The high sensitivity of the Q-PCR enabled detection of slightly higher relative expression levels of AtRCE1 and AtICMTB in flowers and leaves relative to roots and seedlings. [[FIGURE]] The activity and expression data suggested that AtICMTA has a minor or restricted function and that AtICMTB is likely the major isoprenyl methyltransferase in Arabidopsis. Mutant analyses were carried out to test this assumption. An Arabidopsis line (P65H9) with a T-DNA insertion three nucleotides upstream of the termination TGA codon of AtICMTA (Supplemental Figs. S5 and S6) was identified in screens of the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center T-DNA collection (www.biotech.wisc.edu). No RNA was detected in AticmtA−/− homozygote mutant plants by RT-PCR with AtICMTA gene-specific primers (Supplemental Figs. S5 and S7; Supplemental Table S1), indicating the mutant is a null. An RT-PCR reaction on the same RNA template using AtICMTB-specific primers (Supplemental Figs. S5 and S7; Supplemental Table S1) showed that the mutation had no effect on its expression (Supplemental Fig. S5). Cloning and sequencing showed that the weak band that was amplified by the AtICMTA-specific primers was AtICMTB. The AticmtA−/− plants had no visible phenotype including increased sensitivity to ABA, indicating that AtICMTA function is redundant with ICMTB. Unfortunately, no mutant with compromised AtICMTB expression has been identified. To further explore the function of isoprenyl Cys methylation in plants we generated ICMT RNAi plants (Aticmtsil). These plants expressed two 380-bp fragments of the ICMTA coding region in reverse orientation. ICMTA and ICMTB show approximately 80% identity at the nucleotide level (Supplemental Fig. S7), making it highly likely that the RNAi construct would silence both ICMT genes. One hundred and ten independent transgenic lines were isolated, of which a total of 63 (70%) had a similar abnormal phenotype (Fig. 7 ). Six independent T1 lines were selected for further analysis. [[FIGURE]] Aticmtsil plants had altered phyllotaxis (Fig. 7, A–C, E, and F). Flowers developed from the same region of the inflorescence stem with minimal or no elongation of the internodes (Fig. 7, A–C and F). Occasionally, secondary axillary flowers developed within flowers, indicating partial conversion of flowers into inflorescence (Fig. 7C). Siliques developed without internode elongation (Fig. 7F). Multiple buds developed in the axil of cauline leaves (Fig. 7D). All the plants developed fasciated bifurcated stems (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, altered phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, and development of axillary flowers were also observed in the era1 PFT β-subunit mutant plants (Fig. 7H), suggesting functional relatedness of the two genes. Unlike in era1 and plp plants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), Aticmtsil flowers did not have extra flower organs or additional rosette leaves and were not late flowering and partially male sterile. It was difficult to observe consistent reduction in mRNA levels in the Aticmtsil plants, suggesting a posttranscriptional silencing mechanism. To prove that the phenotype of the plants was associated with the ICMT RNAi we monitored the cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the kanamycin-resistant selection marker. To this end, approximately 100 seedlings from each of three independent transgenic lines were grown on soil without selection and their phenotypes were scored. Plants were allowed to self, their seeds were harvested, germinated on a kanamycin-containing selection medium, and the ratios between resistant and sensitive seedlings were determined. In turn, plants were transferred from the selection plates to soil and their phenotypes were scored again. In nonsegregating populations in which all the plants had a mutant phenotype 100% of the progeny were kanamycin resistant. The progeny of plants without a mutant phenotype were all kanamycin sensitive. The progeny of plants heterozygote to the RNAi segregated in a 3 to 1 ratio with respect to the selection marker. All the kanamycin-resistant plants showed a mutant phenotype after transferring to soil. In contrast, rescued kanamycin-sensitive plants that were transferred to soil did not show the mutant phenotype. The segregation analysis confirmed that the abnormal phenotype of the Aticmtsil plants were associated with the AtICMT RNAi transgene.
!~MM~! All plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Plasmids were generated using standard protocols. Oligonucleotide primers used in PCR reaction to generate appropriate restriction sites, site-directed mutagenesis, and sequencing are listed in Supplemental Table S1. All fragments and construct were sequenced to verify that no PCR-generated errors were introduced and that relevant fragments are cloned in the correct frame. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for all recombinant plasmid constructions. Plasmid production for routine DNA manipulations and sequencing was prepared with QIAGENE mini prep purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression vectors were generated by cloning the corresponding cDNAs into the polycloning sites of high-copy (2μ) or low-copy (CEN) yeast vectors. The yeast vectors contain a glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase gene promoter and a phosphoglycerate kinase gene terminator, separated by restriction sites. Plant expression vectors were generated by cloning a SphI, HindIII, or NotI cassette, containing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, gene of interest, and NOS 3′ end, into the plant binary vector pCAMBIA2300 (SphI, HindIII). A fragment containing a full-length cDNA sequence of the gene of interest, without the ATG and with a stop codon, was cloned in frame with the C terminus of plasmids containing GFP, CFP, and YFP. A fragment containing a full-length cDNA sequence of the gene of interest, with the ATG and without a stop codon, was cloned in frame with the N terminus of plasmids containing GFP, CFP, and YFP. pSY60 was used as the template together with primers SYP50 and SYP51 to mutate AtICMTA Q165 to E165 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create pSY915. AticmtAmE165 was sequenced to verify that no PCR-generated errors were introduced. pSY915 was used as the template together with primers SYP54 and SYP55 to mutate AticmtAmE165 N111 and Y112 to R111 and R112, respectively, using a QuikChange (Stratagene) to create pSY902. pSY902 was used as the template together with primers SYP52 and SYP53 to mutate AticmtAmE165Q187R188 E187 and S188 to Q187 and R188 using a QuikChange (Stratagene) to create pSY904. AticmtAmR111R112E165Q187R188 was sequenced to verify that no PCR-generated errors were introduced. A fragment from position 1 to 380 of AtICMTA was amplified with oligonucleotide primers SYP304 and SYP305. The resulting fragment was purified, digested with NcoI and XhoI, and cloned into pGFP-MRC to generate pSY302. An identical fragment was amplified with oligonucleotide primers SYP306 and SYP307, purified, digested with XbaI and SacI, and cloned into pSY302 to generate pSY303. Cloning was such that both fragments were flanking GFP in a reverse orientation to one another. Next, pSY303 was digested with HindIII to isolate a cassette containing the 35S promoter, reverse-oriented AtICMTA fragments flanking GFP, and NOS transcriptional terminator. This cassette was subcloned into pCAMBIA2300 to generate pSY304. PCR was used for gene amplification, gene detection, and cloning. Unless mentioned, reaction conditions were as follows: 5 to 100 ng of DNA, 0.05 mm dNTPs, 7.5 μm of each primer, 1× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.08% Nonidet P-40), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 0.125 to 0.25 μL of Taq DNA polymerase or Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) that was added in a hot-start fashion following the annealing step of the first cycle template in a final volume of 25 μL. The reaction conditions were: 2 min at 94°C, followed by 30 repeats of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, 1 min per 1 kb at 72°C, and an additional step of 3 min at 72°C. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S3. Yeast transformation was carried out with a modified lithium acetate transformation protocol (CITATION; CITATION). AtROP9 and Atrop9mS were subcloned in yeast expression vector pJR1138-GFP to obtain plasmids pSY32 and pSY31, respectively (Supplemental Table S2; CITATION). Yeast strains JRY6959, JRY6958, and SYY500 (Supplemental Table S3) were transformed with the resulting plasmids to obtain yeast strains SYY535, SYY538, SYY539, and SYY542. Subcellular localization of the GFP fusion proteins was determined using a confocal laser-scanning microscope following overnight growth of cells at 30°C on rich media plates. To prevent cell motion and obtain sharp images, cells were loaded onto slides in 0.1% low melting agarose. Assays were carried out essentially as described previously (CITATION), with the following modifications. Three microliters of MATa cell slurry (approximately 107 cells) were spotted onto a solid, rich medium (yeast peptone dextrose) plate containing 0.01% Triton X-100 that had been spread with a lawn (approximately 2 × 106 cells) of the MATα sst2α cells (JRY3443). After 1 d of growth at 28°C, the relative amounts of a-factor produced by each MATa strain were evident from the size of the growth inhibition zone (halo) surrounding the MATa cells. The relative halo sizes were directly proportional to the amount of a-factor exported from the MATa cells (CITATION). Experiments were repeated three times with four to five replicates. Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Columbia-0 and Wassilewskija) plants were grown as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Young leaves of N. benthamiana were injected on the abaxial side with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101/pMP90 strains harboring appropriate plasmids as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). ER localization was determined by coexpression with ER-mCherry, which is composed of the N-terminal signal peptide of Arabidopsis WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE2 and a C-terminal ER-retention signal (His-Asp-Glu-Leu; CITATION), or with GFP-AtSTE24 (CITATION). Leaves were observed for GFP and mCherry fluorescence at 24 to 48 h postinjection. Stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants were obtained using the floral-dip method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected by either growth on kanamycin containing 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium or bar spraying soil-grown plants with BASTA. AtICMTA plants were also analyzed by PCR to reveal transgene existence. Leaves were ground with a mortar and pestle and 1 to 2 g were used for DNA isolation using GenElute plant genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Leaves were ground with a mortar and pestle and 100 to 200 mg were used for total RNA isolation using SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from leaves, flowers, seedlings, and roots using SV total isolation RNA kit (Promega). For RT, 1 μg of total RNA was denatured at 70°C for 5 min in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primers. The tubes were immediately chilled on ice and reverse transcribed with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) in a total volume of 25 μL at 42°C for 60 min. Quantification of AtRCE1, AtICMTA, and AtICMTB RNA levels was carried out by Q-PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems). Study samples were run in triplicate on eight-well optical PCR strips (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 10 μL. Primers were designed according to Roche Universal ProbeLibrary (https://www.roche-applied-science.com/sis/rtpcr/upl/index.jsp). The following primers pairs were used: AtRCE1, 500 nmol L−1 of each SYP1008 + SYP1009 to amplify a 106-bp fragment from positions 265 to 371; AtICMTA, 125 nmol L−1 of each SYP1006 + SYP1007 to amplify a 59-bp fragment from positions 252 to 311; and AtICMTB, 500 nmol L−1 of each SYP1004 + SYP 1005 to amplify a 120-bp fragment from positions 179 to 299. The PCR cycles were run as follows: 10 min initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 subsequent cycles of 15 s denaturation at 95°C followed by 1 min primer annealing and elongation at 60°C. The specificity of the unique amplification product was determined by melting curve analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantities of RNA were calculated by the standard curve method (Applied Biosystems Incorporated 2001 User Bulletin #2: ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system [http://www.appliedbiosystems.com]). DNA dilution series were prepared to calculate amplification efficiency coefficient for each gene. The relative levels of AtRCE1, AtICMTA, and AtICMTB RNA were calculated according to the amplification efficiency coefficient and normalized against ACTIN8 gene standard, level of which was taken as 1. The analysis was repeated with three independent biological replicates. DNA pulls of the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center T-DNA mutant collection were screened with oligonucleotide primers SYP300 and JL202 or SYP301 and JL202. Southern blot of the amplified PCR fragments with an AtICMTA gene-specific probe was used to verify identification of potential T-DNA insertion in AtICMTA. In turn, the relevant seed stock, P65H9, was ordered and the T-DNA insertion site was determined by sequencing. Expression level of AtICMTA and AtICMTB in the mutant homozygote plants was determined by RT-PCR with nucleotide primers SYP304 and SYP305, and SYP306 and SYP307, respectively. Images of plants were obtained with Nikon Coolpix CCD camera or with Zeiss Axiocam CCD camera mounted on a Zeiss SV11 stereomicroscope. Imaging was carried out on Leica TCS-SL confocal laser-scanning microscope using 20× multi-immersion or 63× water-immersion objectives with numerical apertures of 0.7 and 1.2, respectively. GFP excitation was carried out with argon laser at 488 nm together with a 500 nm beam splitter and spectral detector set between 510 to 535 nm. mCherry was excited with argon laser at 514 nm together with 458/514 dichroic beam splitter and spectral detector set between 580 to 630. Dual imaging of GFP and mCherry was carried out in a sequential mode to avoid channel bleeding. The reticulate ER images are of single confocal sections and the colocalization images are maximal projection stacks of multiple confocal sections. Image processing was carried out with Leica LCS, Zeiss LSM browser, and Adobe Photoshop. ABA germination assays were carried out as described previously (CITATION).
