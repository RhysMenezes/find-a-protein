!~ABS~! Histone (de)acetylation is a highly conserved chromatin modification that is vital for development and growth. In this study, we identified a role in seed dormancy for two members of the histone deacetylation complex in Arabidopsis thaliana, SIN3-LIKE1 (SNL1) and SNL2. The double mutant snl1 snl2 shows reduced dormancy and hypersensitivity to the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and diallyl disulfide compared with the wild type. SNL1 interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 in vitro and in planta, and loss-of-function mutants of SNL1 and SNL2 show increased acetylation levels of histone 3 lysine 9/18 (H3K9/18) and H3K14. Moreover, SNL1 and SNL2 regulate key genes involved in the ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) pathways by decreasing their histone acetylation levels. Taken together, we showed that SNL1 and SNL2 regulate seed dormancy by mediating the ABA-ethylene antagonism in Arabidopsis. SNL1 and SNL2 could represent a cross-link point of the ABA and ethylene pathways in the regulation of seed dormancy.
!~RES~! We analyzed the expression pattern of various genes encoding potential chromatin-regulating proteins using publicly available gene expression data and found that SNL1 and SNL2 show their highest expression level in dry seeds (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/plant.jsp) (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). This suggested a putative role of these genes in seeds, which was further investigated. First, we examined the expression pattern of SNL1 and SNL2 in Arabidopsis using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). This analysis confirmed a high expression of SNL1 and SNL2 in mature seeds (Figure 1A; see Supplemental Figure 2A online). A more detailed expression analysis showed that the expression of SNL1 and SNL2 gradually increased during seed maturation (Figure 1B; see Supplemental Figure 2B online). This pattern is reminiscent of that of dormancy genes such as DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) (CITATION) and suggests a possible role of SNL1 and SNL2 in seed dormancy. [[FIGURE]] To study the role of the SNL genes in seeds, we obtained insertion mutants of SNL1 and SNL2. Analysis of these mutants by RT-PCR (Figures 2A and 2B) showed that they are likely to be null mutants. The SNL1 and SNL2 genes are highly similar, sharing 71% identity between their protein sequences, and we created the double mutant snl1 snl2 by crossing. The seed dormancy level of the single and double mutants was subsequently analyzed by measuring germination during seed storage. All mutants showed reduced dormancy, which was most evident in the double mutant snl1 snl2-1 (Figure 2C). The single mutants snl2-1 and snl2-2 only showed slightly reduced seed dormancy (Figure 2C). This indicates that SNL1 and SNL2 have partially redundant roles in seed dormancy. Transgenic plants containing the P35S:SNL1 construct in a mutant snl1 background showed similar germination levels as wild-type seeds, independent of the addition of ABA in the medium (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). We also selected additional independent double mutants from the crosses of snl1 to snl2-1 and snl2-2 to snl1, which all showed significantly reduced seed dormancy compared with the single mutants (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). [[FIGURE]] Several seed dormancy mutants, including hub1 and dog1, show reduced seed longevity (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we examined seed longevity of snl mutants after 3 and 6 months storage at room temperature. Germination of 6-month-stored seeds of Columbia (Col), snl1, snl2-1, and snl1 snl2-1 was 95, 88, 84, and 55%, respectively (Figure 2E). This indicates that the decrease of seed dormancy is associated with reduced seed longevity in these lines. SNL1 and SNL2 are predicted to be components of the HDAC complex (CITATION). To confirm a role of SNL1 and SNL2 in histone deacetylation, the mutant growth response to the histone deacetylation inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) (CITATION) and diallyl disulfide (DADS) (CITATION) was tested. The snl1 and snl2 mutants showed increased sensitivity to TSA in postgermination growth (Figure 3A). In Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 30 μM TSA, the postgermination growth of mutants was severely inhibited, and the snl1 snl2-1 double mutant showed the highest sensitivity. [[FIGURE]] The germination of these mutants was also inhibited by DADS. The germination percentage of snl1 sn2-1 was 49%, which is markedly lower than the 94% germination of wild-type seeds observed in medium containing 5 mM DADS (Figure 3B). These results suggest that SNL1 and SNL2 function partially redundantly in histone deacetylation. To assess the influence of SNL on histone acetylation in more detail, the acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4 at different positions were analyzed using specific antibodies. Acetylation levels of H3K9/18 and H3K14 were increased in the 7-d-old seedlings of the snl1 snl2-1 double mutant compared with the Col wild type. However, H3K23 and H4K12 acetylation levels were not affected (Figure 4). The levels of H3K14ac and H3K9/18ac in snl1 snl2-1 were 1.9- and 4.5-fold higher than in Col, respectively. Slightly increased H3K9/18ac levels were also found in the snl1 and snl2-1 single mutants (Figure 4). These alterations of histone acetylation levels in the mutants indicate that SNL1 and SNL2 redundantly regulate this histone modification. [[FIGURE]] SIN3 protein needs to associate with the HDAC reduced potassium dependency3 (RPD3) to regulate gene transcription in yeast and mammals (CITATION). Therefore, it is plausible that the two SIN3 orthologous proteins SNL1 and SNL2 interact with RPD3-type HDACs to execute their function in Arabidopsis. HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) protein is a good candidate for an RPD3-type HDAC because it was found to physically interact with SNL1 in the yeast two-hybrid screening database on the BAR website (http://bar.utoronto.ca/interactions/cgi-bin/Arabidopsis_interactions_viewer.cgi). Therefore, we first confirmed the interaction between SNL1 and HDA19 by yeast two-hybrid assays (Figure 5A). The SNL1 protein strongly interacts with HDA19 on the high-stringency selection plates. This interaction was also confirmed using the chromogenic marker X-α-Gal by filter lift assay (Figure 5A). [[FIGURE]] SNL1 and HDA19 were colocalized in the nucleus after cotransformation of CFP-HDA19 and yellow fluorescent protein YFP-SNL1 in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), confirming previous observations by CITATION and CITATION. For verification of the interaction between SNL1 and HDA19 in planta, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens–infiltrated tobacco leaves (CITATION). The YFP fluorescence signal was observed only in N. benthamiana leaves that coexpressed the constructs YFP1-174 aa-HDA19 and YFP-175-end aa-SNL1 or YFP-175-end aa-HDA19 and YFP1-174 aa-SNL1 (Figure 5B). In addition, the HDA19 loss-of-function mutants hda19-1 and hda19-2 (CITATION) both showed decreased seed dormancy (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). The hda19-2 mutant showed a stronger reduction of seed dormancy than hda19-1. This could be due to the position of the hda19-2 T-DNA, which inserted five base pairs upstream of the start codon and disrupted the HDA19 function more severely than the hda19-1 insertion (CITATION). The reduced dormancy phenotype of hda19 mutants is consistent with the snl1 phenotype and indicates a role for the histone deacetylation complex comprising SNL1 and HDA19 in seed dormancy. Reduced histone acetylation results in the repression of target genes (CITATION). We showed that the histone acetylation level in the snl1 snl2-1 double mutant was significantly increased (Figure 4). Therefore, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of 12-h imbibed freshly harvested seeds of the snl1 snl2-1 mutant and Col to identify genes with altered expression levels. In snl1 snl2-1, we identified 1517 and 278 genes that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Figure 6), indicating that a large proportion of genes are negatively regulated by SNL1 and SNL2. Many of the differentially expressed genes were involved in the cell cycle (Figure 6; see Supplemental Figure 7 online) as previously shown in mammals and yeast (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Transcription levels of genes regulating the plant hormone pathways were also affected, specifically those for ABA, auxin, and ethylene (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). There is abundant evidence that ABA and ethylene play important roles in the regulation of seed dormancy (CITATION). Therefore, we speculate that these hormones could be involved in the reduced dormancy phenotype of the snl mutants. Table 1 gives an overview of the expression of several hormone- and dormancy-related genes in the snl1 snl2 double mutant. We validated the expression patterns of these genes in snl mutants by qRT-PCR (Figures 7A and 8C; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Our transcriptome analysis identified 16 genes involved in the ethylene pathway with significantly increased expression in the snl1 snl2-1 double mutant (see Supplemental Figure 7 online), including some ethylene biosynthesis genes (Table 1). qRT-PCR confirmed the upregulation of the genes ACO1, ACO4, ERF105, ERF9, and ERF112 (Figure 7A; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). This pointed to the involvement of SNL1 and SNL2 in seed dormancy by repressing ethylene synthesis and response. Therefore, we examined the ethylene release of freshly harvested seeds and the triple response in the mutant lines. Seeds of snl1 and snl1 snl2-1 released more ethylene than the wild type (Figure 7B), whereas snl2-1 produced a similar amount of ethylene. This result was consistent with the increased expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes. Moreover, a significantly increased triple response to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) was observed in seedlings of snl1 and snl1 snl2-1 (Figure 7C). The hypocotyl length of snl1 and snl1 snl2-1 was much shorter than Col in medium with 1 μM ACC, whereas snl2-1 showed a relatively mild decrease in hypocotyl length (Figure 7D). However, ACC treatment had only a minor influence on the expression of SNL1 and SNL2 in seed (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). To better understand the role of SNL1 and SNL2 in the ethylene pathway, the triple mutant snl1 snl2-1 etr1-2 was created. ETR1 is an ethylene receptor with a negative role in the ethylene pathway; the dominant allele etr1-2 blocks ethylene signaling and causes increased seed dormancy (CITATION). The triple mutant snl1 snl2-1 etr1-2 showed a similar germination pattern and a similar triple response as the wild type (Figure 7E; see Supplemental Figure 10 online). This indicates that etr1-2 suppresses the effects of snl1 snl2-1 on seed dormancy and germination by blocking ethylene signaling. Seed dormancy is set during seed maturation, and the phytohormone ABA is believed to be a central player in seed dormancy establishment and maintenance (CITATION). Our transcriptomic analysis identified some ABA-related genes with altered expression levels in the snl1 snl2 double mutant (Figure 6, Table 1). Interestingly, snl1, snl2-1, and snl1 snl2-1 displayed reduced sensitivity to ABA during germination compared with wild-type Col (Figure 8A). The sensitivity to ABA of root growth after germination was similarly affected (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). The reduced sensitivity could be caused by reduced ABA levels in the mutants. Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the ABA content was markedly reduced in snl1, snl2-1, and snl1 snl2-1 fresh seeds (Figure 8B). In agreement with the reduced ABA content in mutant seeds, several genes involved in the hydrolysis of ABA showed altered expression levels between mutants and the wild type (Table 1). The genes CYP707A1 and CYP707A2 encoding ABA hydrolases were upregulated, and a NCED4 gene was downregulated, with different profiles in snl1, snl2-1, and snl1 snl2-1 (Figure 8C). FUSCA3 (FUS3) and DOG1 are two key factors in seed maturation and dormancy (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Both genes showed reduced gene expression (Table 1, Figure 8C). Moreover, qRT-PCR showed that the transcripts of SNL1 and SNL2 were induced by ABA (Figure 8D). Altogether, we showed that SNL1 and SNL2 are positive regulators of the ABA pathway. GA is another important factor involved in seed germination (CITATION) that is negatively regulated by ABA. However, we could not detect any significant differences in the responses of the snl mutants to the GA synthesis inhibitor PAC. Moreover, the GA contents in mature seeds of the wild type and snl mutants were identical (see Supplemental Figure 12 online). Therefore, we assume that SNL1 and SNL2 do not influence seed germination through the GA pathway. We have shown that loss of function of SNL1 and SNL2 increased the histone acetylation level and activated gene expression of several key genes involved in the ethylene and ABA pathways. To verify whether these upregulated genes were directly targeted by histone acetylation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with 7-d-old seedlings. As the gene expression levels were studied in imbibed freshly harvest seeds, additional qRT-PCR experiments with 7-d-old seedlings were performed, which yielded similar expression patterns (see Supplemental Figure 13 online). Because of the increased H3K9/18ac level in the snl1 snl2-1 mutant (Figure 4), we used the specific H3K9/18ac antibody to immunoprecipitate chromatin in Col and snl mutants. After ChIP, the relative enrichment of histone H3 acetylation was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using gene-specific primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Among the upregulated genes, hyperacetylation of the promoter region was detected for ACO1, ACO4, ERF112, ERF9, and CYP707A1 in the snl1 snl2-1 double mutant. However, increased acetylation also occurred in the promoter (first) and coding (second) regions in ERF105 and in the coding (third) region in CYP707A2 (Figure 9; see Supplemental Figure 14 online). These data suggest that the upregulation of gene expression in snl1 snl2 was tightly associated with increased histone acetylation. [[FIGURE]] Previous research showed that the ubiquitin E3 ligase HUB1 promotes seed dormancy in Arabidopsis (CITATION). We were interested in the relation between histone acetylation and ubiquitination in the regulation of seed dormancy. Therefore, we obtained the double mutant snl1 hub1-5 after crossing of the single mutants. The snl1 hub1-5 double mutant showed a further reduction in dormancy compared with the single mutants (Figure 10). This implied that SNL1 and HUB1 regulate seed dormancy independently. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! All experiments were performed with Arabidopsis thaliana Col wild-type plants or mutants in the Col background. T-DNA insertion lines Sail_1151_F09 (snl1), Salk_097168 (snl2-1), and Salk_073549 (snl2-2) were ordered from the ABRC, and homozygous individuals were identified by PCR-based screening. The gene-specific primers, designed by the SIGNAL T-DNA verification primer design program, were used in combination with T-DNA left border primers. RT-PCR with RNA isolated from leaves was performed to confirm the homozygous knockout lines. PCR was performed with 25 cycles for ACTIN8 and 35 cycles for SNL1 and SNL2. The primers for PCR in this article are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The mutants etr1-2, hub1-5, hda19-1, and hda19-2 were described before (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Double and triple mutants (snl1 snl2-1, snl1 snl2-2, snl1 hub1-5, and snl1 snl2-1 etr1-2) were obtained by standard crossing procedures. Seeds were sown in soil and grown in the greenhouse under photoperiodic cycles of 16 h light and 8 h dark at 22°C. The seeds sown on half-strength MS medium were first sterilized with 10% (v/v) NaClO. Plates were kept in the dark at 4°C for 3 d to break dormancy (stratification) before moving into a climate chamber with a photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h dark at 22°C. Germination tests were performed as described by Alonso- Blanco et al. (2003). All germination experiments were performed on filter paper in 6-cm Petri dishes. Each genotype had at least eight replicates (consisting of 80 to 100 seeds from one individual plant per Petri dish). The average germination ratio was determined after 7 d of incubation in a climate room (25°C, 16 h light with 80 to 90 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity). DADS and TSA were added into MS medium for the analysis of germination and postgermination growth. For the sensitivity analysis, filter papers were soaked with either control solutions or solutions of the GA biosynthesis inhibitors PAC or ABA. Seeds for each germination assay were collected from plants of different genotypes grown simultaneously and stored under identical conditions. For the triple response assay, ACC was added into the MS medium, and all lines were grown 3 d in the dark at room temperature after 3 d of stratification at 4°C. Each germination or growth test was done with at least three replicates from independent plants. Total RNA was isolated from Col young leaves using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNAs were generated by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The open reading frame (ORF) of SNL1 was amplified with Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) and primers SNL1-F, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGAAGCGGATAAGAGATGAT-3′, and SNL1-R, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTTTTAAGCTGAGAGAAACCTATGG-3′. P35S:SNL1 was constructed by inserting SNL1 cDNA into the pLEELA vector, which is a derivative of pJawohl3-RNAi (GenBank accession number AF404854) containing a Gateway cassette introduced into the HpaI site, and then transformed in mutant snl1 plants. The snl1 plants were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 pm90RK using the floral dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected based on their ability to survive after 7 d in MS medium with 10 mg/L dl-phosphinothricin. The 3:1 segregating transformant lines were selected on MS medium with 10 mg/L dl-phosphinothricin. T3 homozygous transgenic plants were used for phenotypic analyses. All of the constructs used in this study were confirmed by sequencing. Histone extraction was performed according to CITATION with minor modifications. Four grams of 7-d-old seedlings grown in MS were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in extraction buffer 1 (0.4 M Suc, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM PMSF), filtered through four layers of Miracloth, and centrifuged for 20 min at 2880g at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of histone extraction buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 M HCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mM PMSF), and soluble proteins were isolated by centrifugation, precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, and repelleted by centrifugation at 17,000g for 30 min. Pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone, resuspended in Laemmli buffer (63 mM Tris HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.0025% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8), separated electrophoretically on 4 to 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham) for immunoblotting. Histone modifications were detected with the H3 (Upstate 05-499) and acetyl-H3 antibodies (Upstate 07-595, 07-593, 06-911, and 07-355) and visualized on x-ray film using a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and the Super ECL plus detection system (Applygen). The membrane was stripped before being reprobed with other antibodies in accordance with CITATION. Total RNAs from seedlings or seeds with or without different hormone treatments were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and RNAqueous small-scale phenol-free total RNA isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and reverse transcribed using the SuperScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). The expression value for each gene was quantified using a standard curve with a serial dilution of plasmid of known concentration, and they were normalized to the value of ACTIN8 and At2g28390 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). At least three biological replicates were analyzed. Primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. Mean values and standard errors were calculated from the three biological replicates and are shown in the figures. For the RNA-seq experiment, total RNAs were extracted from freshly harvested Col and snl1 snl2-1 seeds after 12 h of imbibition. The experiments were repeated to have two biological replicates. The RNA samples were sequenced by BGI at Shenzhen. mRNA was enriched using oligo(dT) magnetic beads. By adding the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA was interrupted into short fragments; then, first-strand cDNA was synthesized with random hexamer primer using the mRNA fragments as templates. Buffer, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were added to synthesize the second strand. The double-stranded cDNA was purified with the QiaQuick PCR extraction kit and washed with EB buffer for end repair and single nucleotide A addition. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments. The required fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and enriched by PCR amplification. The library products were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The rate of ethylene production by 1 g seeds was measured by enclosing samples in 15-mL airtight containers for 24 h at 20°C, withdrawing 1 mL of the headspace gas, and injecting it into a gas chromatograph (model GC-4CMPF; Shimadzu) fitted with a flame ionization detector and an activated alumina column. The oven temperature was 60°C and the N2, H2, and O2 flow rates were 20, 35, and 300 mL min−1, respectively. Ethylene identification was based on the retention time compared with standard C2H4 (purity 99.9%) (CITATION). This experiment was repeated thrice for each line. ABA and GA4 concentrations in seeds of different mutants and Col were determined by HPLC as described (CITATION) with minor modification. Seeds (0.5 g) were finely ground in liquid nitrogen for extraction and measurement of hormone. Quantification was obtained by comparing the peak areas with those of known amounts of standard ABA and GA4 (Sigma-Aldrich). The ORF cDNAs of SNL1 and HDA19 were amplified with SNL1-F and SNL1-R, previously presented, as well as HDA19-F, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTAATGGATACTGG CGGCAATTCG-3′, and HDA19-R, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTTATGTTTTAGGAGGAAACGCC-3′, from Col seeds and in-frame fused with the GAL4 activation domain and the binding domain of the pAD (pACT2-attR) and pBD (pAS2-attR) vectors to generate prey and bait plasmids, respectively (modified from Clontech). These pairs of bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into yeast AH109 cells using a lithium acetate method (Clontech) and analyzed for yeast growth on selective medium lacking His, Leu, Trp, and adenine at 28°C for 2 to 4 d. Positive and negative colonies were transferred to filter paper, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and assayed for expression of the lacZ reporter gene by detection of β-galactosidase activity with a solution containing an X-Gal substrate. The plates containing the filter papers were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The color of colonies in filter paper was monitored, and colonies producing β-galactosidase became blue (Agilent). To generate the vector system for BiFC analysis, the cDNAs of HDA19 and SNL1 were amplified and in-frame fused into vectors pESPYNE and pESPYCE to produce the N-terminal fusions YFP1-174aa-HDA19 and YFP-175-end aa-SNL1. Additionally, the CFP-HDA19 and YFP-SNL1 fusion vectors were constructed to confirm the fusion protein localization with pENSG-CFP and pENSG-YFP, respectively (CITATION). For transient expression, Agrobacterium strains (GV3101 pm90RK) carrying the constructs were used (CITATION) for infiltration of 5- to 6-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The Agrobacterium strains were infiltrated at an OD600 of 0.5 for the BiFC constructs. For microscopy analyses, leaf discs were used 2 d after infiltration for BiFC. The multiphoton laser scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000MPE) was used to detect the fluorescence signal. About 1.5 g of 7-d-old seedlings was used for ChIP assay. Chromatin preparation and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (CITATION). Harvested seedlings were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min in a vacuum. Gly was added to a final concentration of 0.125 M, and the reaction was terminated by incubation for 5 min in a vacuum. Seedlings were rinsed three times with distilled water and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After isolation, chromatin was sheared to 500- to 2000-bp fragments by sonication (Branson Sonifier 250). Immunoprecipitation was performed by adding specific antibody in an extract and protein G agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Millipore). The antibodies used for ChIP assays were anti-H3K9/18ac (Upstate 07-593). After washing, immune complexes were eluted from the protein G beads and reverse cross-linked by incubation overnight at 65°C. Samples were treated with proteinase K for 1 h at 65°C and RNase A for 1 h at 37°C. DNA was extracted in a final volume of 40 μL using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The ChIP assay was repeated with three biological replicates. DNA (0.5 μL) was used for each qPCR. qPCR with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) was performed with a real-time system (Eppendorf). Each sample was assayed in triplicate by PCR. Error bars in each graph indicate variance of three technical repetitions. We used ACTIN8 and 18S (CITATION; CITATION) as internal control for H3K9/18ac; primers used for ChIP assays are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The original RNA-seq image data were base-called using Illumina GA Pipeline v1.6 software. The raw reads were filtered for adaptors and low-quality reads. Reads were then mapped to reference Arabidopsis genome sequences using SOAPaligner/soap2. Mismatches no more than two bases were allowed in the alignment. The gene expression level was calculated as reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads. A statistical method designed for differential expression based on gene sequence tags was applied for the detection of differentially expressed genes (CITATION). The method reported both the raw P value and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure adjusted P value (false discovery rate [FDR]) across all detected genes. Only genes with both FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute value of fold change ≥ 1.5 were qualified as differentially expressed genes. We used an annotation tool named TAGGIT, which was specially designed for the seed-specific gene ontology classification (CITATION) to annotate the lists of differentially expressed genes. We compared the list of differentially expressed genes of snl1 snl2-1 with those of hub1. The list of differentially expressed genes in hub1 was obtained from CITATION. The Affymetrix probe identifiers in the hub1 transcriptome data were mapped to Arabidopsis locus identifiers for comparison. The overlap between the up- and downregulated genes in the snl1 snl2-1 and hub1 mutants was counted, and the significances of the overlap were calculated by the phyper function in R. We used the number of all nuclear genes represented on the Affymetrix ATH1 Genome array as the population size in the calculation. For physiological and biochemical data, an analysis of variance was performed to investigate whether there was a significant difference between the samples, and if a significant difference was found, a Tukey’s honestly significant difference test was performed to determine which samples were responsible for the significant differences.
