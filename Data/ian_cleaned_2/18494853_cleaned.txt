!~ABS~! Upon blockage of chromosomal replication by DNA lesions, Y-family polymerases interact with monoubiquitylated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to catalyse translesion synthesis (TLS) and restore replication fork progression. Here, we assessed the roles of Arabidopsis thaliana POLH, which encodes a homologue of Y-family polymerase η (Polη), PCNA1 and PCNA2 in TLS-mediated UV resistance. A T-DNA insertion in POLH sensitized the growth of roots and whole plants to UV radiation, indicating that AtPolη contributes to UV resistance. POLH alone did not complement the UV sensitivity conferred by deletion of yeast RAD30, which encodes Polη, although AtPolη exhibited cyclobutane dimer bypass activity in vitro, and interacted with yeast PCNA, as well as with Arabidopsis PCNA1 and PCNA2. Co-expression of POLH and PCNA2, but not PCNA1, restored normal UV resistance and mutation kinetics in the rad30 mutant. A single residue difference at site 201, which lies adjacent to the residue (lysine 164) ubiquitylated in PCNA, appeared responsible for the inability of PCNA1 to function with AtPolη in UV-treated yeast. PCNA-interacting protein boxes and an ubiquitin-binding motif in AtPolη were found to be required for the restoration of UV resistance in the rad30 mutant by POLH and PCNA2. These observations indicate that AtPolη can catalyse TLS past UV-induced DNA damage, and links the biological activity of AtPolη in UV-irradiated cells to PCNA2 and PCNA- and ubiquitin-binding motifs in AtPolη.
!~RES~! POLH (At5g44740) on chromosome five of Arabidopsis thaliana is predicted to encode AtPolη (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). POLH transcripts were detected in all parts of the inflorescence, rosette, roots and seedling examined by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (CITATION; Figure S1a) or by scrutiny of the Genevestigator microarray database (CITATION), which suggests that POLH is expressed throughout the plant. Yeast RAD30 transcription is UV-inducible (CITATION; CITATION), but quantitative PCR (Table S1) and inspection of the Genevestigator database provided no evidence for UV-induced transcription of POLH. To assess the contribution of AtPolη to UV-B resistance, we used polh-1, a T-DNA insertion line (CITATION) in which POLH is disrupted (Figure 1a). POLH transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in RNA from wild-type but not polh-1 plants (Figure S1b,c), suggesting that polh-1 is a null mutation. UV-B treatment caused modest, dose-dependent inhibition of root growth if irradiated polh-1 seedlings were incubated in the dark, but not if they were incubated continuously under light (Figure 1b). This difference probably reflects efficient light-dependent photoreactivation of CPDs and (6-4)PPs, and their inefficient removal in the dark (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The UV-B sensitivity of irradiated polh-1 and rev3-1 plants incubated in the dark was similar, but a polh-1 rev3-1 double mutant was more sensitive than either single mutant (Figure 1b). This observation is consistent with the reported additive effect of the two mutations on the sensitivity of root growth to UV-B (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Previously, CITATION found greater root growth inhibition by UV-B in the rev3-1 mutant than the polh-1 line. However, they incubated irradiated plants in the dark for 24 h, and then shifted them to light incubation for 48 h prior to measuring root growth. We incubated irradiated plants in the dark continuously for 3 days before the measurements were made. This difference is important for two reasons. First, only 14% of UV-B-induced CPDs are eliminated from roots incubated in the dark for 24 h, whereas ∼80% are removed during light incubation (CITATION). Second, unlike polh-1, rev3-1 sensitizes root growth to UV-B if plants are incubated continuously under light, although so less than for dark incubation (CITATION; Figure 1b). This suggests that rev3-1 may be sensitive to residual damage, the bypass of which involves AtPolζ but not AtPolη. Thus, photoreactivation during the 48-h light incubation period in the previous study may have allowed more root growth by the polh-1 mutant in which AtPolζ functions, than in the rev3-1 mutant in which it does not. Longer term UV-B exposure caused dose-dependent growth inhibition of wild-type plants irradiated during the light period of a light–dark incubation cycle (Figure 1c). As CPD photolyase deficiency increases plant sensitivity to daily UV-B exposure (CITATION), the inhibitory effect we observed may have resulted from CPDs and (6-4)PPs that escaped photoreactivation. Compared with the wild-type plant, growth of the polh-1 mutant was inhibited more by prolonged UV-B exposure, but less than for the rev3-1 mutant (Figure 1c), again suggesting greater sensitivity of the rev3-1 mutant to unrepaired UV damage. Nonetheless, the results indicate that AtPolη is also required for normal UV-B resistance in plants subjected to long-term UV-B exposure. Inactivation of yeast RAD30 confers UV sensitivity by preventing Polη-catalysed TLS past CPDs. To determine if AtPolη can function in TLS, we deleted RAD30 to eliminate Polη in a repair-proficient yeast strain (Figure S2), and expressed the POLH open reading frame (ORF) in the rad30 mutant on pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO. Neither the deletion of RAD30 nor the presence of expression vectors with inserts altered the strain growth rate. All inserts used have native stop codons and should be expressed as native proteins. Insert transcription was verified by RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing, and control reactions showed no plasmid DNA in RNA preparations. Results presented below indicate that insert transcripts were translated in yeast cells. Deletion of RAD30 sensitized yeast to UV-C (Figure 2a), which was used because it induces CPDs and (6-4)PPs more efficiently than UV-B (CITATION). Expression of RAD30 complemented the UV-C sensitivity of the mutant cells, but expression of POLH did not. It is unlikely that this difference resulted from the overexpression of POLH causing an excess of AtPolη that prevented TLS, e.g. by sequestering PCNA. This did not occur for expression of RAD30 on the same vector, which completely restored UV resistance to the rad30 mutant. In addition, other investigators found expressing POLH on a similar multicopy vector fully complemented the rad30 phenotype, arguing against overexpression of POLH disrupting TLS (CITATION). We are uncertain of the reason(s) for the contrast between our result and that of CITATION. Variation in the genetic backgrounds of the strains used is one possibility. Another is that AtPolη expressed from our cDNA is inactive. Inspection of the AtPolη sequence revealed no obvious amino-terminal deficiency that might cause a catalytic defect (Figure 2b). Seven regions encompassing five motifs essential for DNA synthesis by Polη homologues (CITATION) and two helix-hairpin-helix domains found in Y-family polymerases (Prakash et al., 2000, 2005) are well-conserved in AtPolη. Within these regions, residues necessary for the activity or fidelity of yeast or human Polη(CITATION; Glick et al., 2001, 2003; Johnson et al., 1999b, 2003; CITATION) are conserved (Figure 2b). However, our POLH ORF differs from that reported by CITATION at the first position of codons 205 and 412, where a T → C or T → G substitution leads to a conservative F → L or F → V change, respectively. To examine the effect of these substitutions on AtPolη function, we purified AtPolη and assessed its activity in vitro. We found AtPolη catalyses primer extension and TLS past a thymine-thymine (TT) CPD, indicating that neither F205L nor F412V inactivates the polymerase (Figure 3). AtPolη exhibited considerably less activity than human Polη. The activity of purified AtPolκ and human Polκ is enhanced by a carboxyl (C)-terminal deletion (CITATION; T. Nohmi, unpublished data), and the human Polη used in this study was C-terminally truncated. Consequently, the low activity of AtPolηin vitro may reflect the presence of the C-terminal tail. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Interaction with PCNA is necessary for TLS by yeast and human Polη (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). So the inability of POLH to confer UV resistance on the rad30 mutant might reflect the failure of our AtPolη to interact with yeast PCNA. To determine if AtPolη interacts with PCNA we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Arabidopsis has two genes for PCNA (CITATION).PCNA1 (At1g07370) is on chromosome 1 in a region duplicated from a chromosome-2 segment encompassing PCNA2 (At2g29570) (CITATION; CITATION). The reporter strain Mav203 carrying pDEST™32 with the POLH or RAD30 ORF, fused at its 5′ end to a sequence encoding the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain, was transformed with pDEST™22, carrying the PCNA1, PCNA2 or POL30 (encodes yeast PCNA) ORF fused at its 5′ end to a sequence encoding the Gal4 activation domain. Protein interactions were signalled by the growth of transformant colonies on histidine-free medium. AtPolη interacted with PCNA1, PCNA2 and yeast PCNA, but more weakly than yeast, Polη interacted with yeast PCNA (Figure 4a). The plant protein interactions were confirmed using a glutathione sepharose (GST) pull-down assay. GST-PCNA1 or GST-PCNA2 was bound to a GST affinity column, to which His6-AtPolη was then added. His6-AtPolη co-eluted from the column with GST-PCNA1 and GST-PCNA2, but not with GST alone (Figure 4b). The results demonstrate that AtPolη interacts with Arabidopsis and yeast PCNAs. [[FIGURE]] As the interaction of AtPolη with yeast PCNA is insufficient to complement the UV-C sensitivity of the rad30 mutant, we asked if co-expression of POLH and PCNA1 or PCNA2 in the rad30 mutant could restore UV-C resistance. We transformed rad30 cells carrying POLH or RAD30 on pYES-TRP1 with a second expression vector, pDEST™52, bearing PCNA1, PCNA2 or POL30. The UV-C sensitivity of the rad30 mutant was complemented by the simultaneous expression of yeast RAD30 and POL30, but not by both expression vectors without inserts, or by expression of only POL30 (Figure 5a,b). UV-C resistance was also fully reinstated by the expression of POLH plus PCNA2, but not by POLH plus PCNA1 or PCNA2 alone. Compared with the wild-type parent, the rad30 mutant was slightly more UV-C mutable at intermediate doses, and exhibited a dose-dependent decline in mutation frequency above 40 J m−2 (Figure 5c). Expression of POLH and PCNA2 in the rad30 mutant re-established the wild-type mutation kinetics, but expression of POLH and PCNA1 did not. These observations indicate that AtPolη can catalyse TLS in UV-irradiated yeast cells, but requires PCNA2 for its biological activity. [[FIGURE]] The inability of AtPolη plus PCNA1 to complement the rad30 phenotype was surprising as PCNA1 and PCNA2 differ at only eight sites and by one residue in length (Figure 6a). None of the eight sites is in the interdomain connecting loop or hydrophobic patch that are likely to interact with Polη (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), or coincides with any of 22 other sites where PCNA mutations confer UV-sensitivity in yeast (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Furthermore, seven of the residues that differ in AtPCNA1 may not be critical. Two (18 and 19) have side chains buried within the three-dimensional structure of PCNA, and presumably are unavailable for binding (Figure 5b), four (32, 96, 142 and 223) have identical counterparts in Brassica napus or in human PCNA, which function in yeast PCNA deletion mutants (CITATION; CITATION), and one is at a site (262) not present in human PCNA. The eighth different residue, K201, sits adjacent to K164 in PCNA (Figure 6b), and monoubiquitylation of K164 is needed for Polη function in DNA-damaged cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To determine if K201 prevented the complementation of the rad30 phenotype by AtPolη and PCNA1, we changed N201 in PCNA2 to K to make PCNA2*. This mutation did not affect the two-hybrid interaction of PCNA2 with AtPolη (Figure 7a, upper panel), which is consistent with PCNA1 interacting with AtPolη. However, it negated the restoration of UV-C resistance when pcna2* was co-expressed with POLH in the rad30 mutant (Figure 7b). These observations suggest lysine 201 in PCNA1 interferes with TLS by AtPolη in UV-irradiated yeast cells, perhaps by inhibiting the ubiquitylation of lysine 164 in PCNA1. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Yeast and human Polη have a single C-terminal PCNA interacting protein (PIP) box (CITATION), Qx[x](I/L)xx(F/Y/W)(F/Y/W) (where [x] indicates a spacing variation), that is essential for binding unmodified PCNA (Haracska et al., 2001a,b; CITATION; CITATION). In contrast, AtPolη has two potential PIP boxes (CITATION; CITATION) at amino acids 636-643 (PIP1) and 661-667 (PIP2), as does a predicted Oryza sativa Polη homologue (Figure 8a,b). Yeast and human Polη also has a C-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) motif that enhances interaction of Polη with monoubiquitylated PCNA, and is required for TLS in UV-irradiated cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Interestingly, AtPolη and its O. sativa counterpart are missing a UBZ (Figure 8a,c). Complementation of the rad30 phenotype by POLH and PCNA2 indicates the absence of the UBZ does not impede AtPolη function, suggesting that either PCNA2 is not monoubiquitylated in UV-C-irradiated yeast cells or AtPolη has another motif(s) that binds ubiquitin. [[FIGURE]] Polι and Rev1 also lack a UBZ, but have two ubiquitin-binding motifs (UBMs) that enhance their association with monoubiquitylated PCNA, and are required for damage tolerance in UV-treated cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). AtPolη and O. sativa Polη have two sequences resembling UBMs, one of which encompasses PIP1 and partly overlaps with the UBZ location in other Polη homologues (Figure 8a,c,d). No gene for Polι has been found in Arabidopsis (CITATION), but two UBMs are present in Arabidopsis and O. sativa Rev1 (CITATION) (Figure 8d). Differences in the AtPolη and AtRev1 C-terminal regions argue that AtPolη did not acquire UBMs from REV1. Possibly the AtPolη UBMs resulted from exchange with a gene that encoded a Polι homologue, but was subsequently lost. Hydrophobic residues in the yeast or human Polη PIP box are essential for its interaction with PCNA and complementation of the UV sensitivity conferred by yeast rad30 or human polh mutations, respectively (CITATION; Haracska et al., 2001a,b; CITATION). Similarly, conserved L and P residues in the Polι and Rev1 UBMs are needed for binding monoubiquitylated PCNA, as well as TLS, but the UBM2 residues play a more substantial role (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Thus, we assessed the functional importance of the AtPolη PIP1, PIP2 and UBM2 motifs by changing F642 and L643 in PIP1, Y666 and F667 in PIP2, or L631 and P632 in UBM2 to alanine to make PIP1*, PIP2* or UBM2*, respectively. The corresponding mutations in the yeast and human Polη PIP box or the human Polι and yeast Rev1 UBMs do not affect polymerase activity (CITATION; Haracska et al., 2001a,b; CITATION). The mutated ORFs were then tested in the two-hybrid and UV complementation assays. Neither PIP1* nor PIP2* diminished the interaction of AtPolη with PCNA2 (Figure 7a, lower panel), suggesting that PIP1 and PIP2 are functionally redundant with respect to binding unmodified PCNA2. UBM2* also did not prevent the AtPolη–PCNA2 interaction, as would be expected if UBM2 binds ubiquitin, as the yeast cells were not exposed to UV, and little or no monoubiquitylated PCNA should have been present (CITATION). When expressed in the rad30 mutant together with PCNA2, each polh mutation impaired the ability of AtPolη to confer UV-C resistance, although less so than observed for POLH plus pcna2* (Figure 7b). These observations agree with those for mutation of the yeast or human Polη PIP box, Polι or Rev1 UBM2, and K164 in yeast PCNA (CITATION; CITATION; Haracska et al., 2001a,b; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). They also indicate PIP1, PIP2 and UBM2 contribute to AtPolη-dependent TLS in UV-C-irradiated cells. However, the PIP1 result must be interpreted carefully. PIP boxes plug into a hydrophobic patch on the surface of PCNA adjacent to the interdomain connecting loop (CITATION; CITATION), whereas UBMs bind ubiquitin attached to K164 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), some distance away. It is doubtful that the AtPolη sequence containing PIP1 within UBM2 could simultaneously bind at two different sites on PCNA2. Instead, we favour the possibility that PIP1* reduces the AtPolη-mediated UV-C resistance by interfering with the role of UBM2, rather than PIP1, and that AtPolη interacts with PCNA2 in UV-irradiated yeast primarily through PIP2 and UBM2. Our data suggest that AtPolη interacts with PCNA2 to assume the TLS duties of yeast Polη, and indicate that residues mutated in PIP1*, PIP2* and UBM2* are essential for this biological activity in UV-irradiated yeast cells. By analogy with DNA damage tolerance in human cells and yeast, TLS in plants might be assumed to involve ubiquitylation of PCNA, but this remains to be determined. Although the Arabidopsis Rad6 homologues Ubc1, Ubc2 and Ubc3 conjugate ubiquitin to target proteins in vitro, it is not known whether they ubiquitylate PCNA or contribute to UV resistance in planta (CITATION; CITATION). Furthermore, Arabidopsis lacks a Rad18 homologue (CITATION), and so the identity of the proteins that might ubiquitylate plant PCNA is uncertain. However, a rice Rad6 homologue interacts with Sgt1, a subunit of a Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase (CITATION; CITATION), and a large number of SCF complexes may be present in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, a plant SCF ubiquitin ligase might replace Rad18 in damage tolerance. Alternatively, because Ubc1–Ubc3 have E3-independent ubiquitin-conjugating activity in vitro (CITATION), PCNA monoubiquitylation in Arabidopsis, if it occurs, might not require a separate E3 ubiquitin ligase.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia was grown as described by CITATION for RNA isolation or quantitative PCR. Columbia, polh-1 (SALK-129731; SALK Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory, http://signal.salk.edu), rev3-1 (CITATION) and polh-1 rev3-1 (made by crossing polh-1 with rev3-1, and screening F2 plants for UV sensitivity and the presence of the two mutant alleles by PCR) were grown as described by CITATION for root-bending assays or long-term UV-B treatment, except for using a light intensity of 55 μmol m−2 sec−1 in the latter case. To delete RAD30, S. cerevisiae MKP-o (CITATION) was transformed (CITATION) with the 2.1-kb pJM82 SpeI fragment (CITATION). RAD30 deletion was confirmed by PCR (Figure S2), verifying UV sensitivity and complementing it withRAD30. S. cerevisiae MaV203, Escherichia coli TOP10, pCR®-Blunt, pDEST™22, pDEST™32, pDEST™52, pDONR™221, pENTR/D-TOPO®, pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com), pBluescript® II SK (+/−), E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com), pGEX6p-2 (GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com) and pET-30a (Novagen, http://www.merckbiosciences.co.uk/html/NVG/home.html) were used. pYES-TRP1 was made by ligating the 8.0-kb pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-AtRAD1-1 (CITATION) StuI fragment to the 2.2-kb pJG4-5 (OriGene Technologies, http://www.origene.com) SspI fragment to replace URA3 with TRP1. Media for the root bending assay, strain growth, transformant recovery and induction of cDNA/gene expression have been described (CITATION; CITATION). The root-bending assay (CITATION) was performed as described by CITATION. The root length was measured using ImageJ software (1.36, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) and was expressed as a percentage of the average length of non-irradiated wild-type roots. Values are means of between five and 17 measurements. For long-term UV-B treatment (CITATION) 10-day-old seedlings were irradiated daily with 7.8 or 11.2 kJ m−2 over 12 h during incubation under white light. The POLH, PCNA1 and PCNA2 cDNAs, or the RAD30 and POL30 genes, were amplified from reverse-transcribed Arabidopsis leaf RNA or yeast genomic DNA (CITATION), respectively, using primers (Table S2) AR30F2 and AR30R1, AP1F2L and AP1R1, AP2F1 and AP2R1, F3 and R1, or SPF1L and SPR1L, respectively, and thymine/adenine overhang ligated into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO. cDNAs and genes were amplified from the latter vector using primers PQAR30F1 and AR30R1, PQAP1F1 and AP1R1, PQAP2F1 and AP2R1, PQSR30F1 and R1, or PQSPF1 and SPR1L, respectively, for topoisomerase I-mediated directional cloning into pENTR/D-TOPO®. For co-expression studies, PCNA1, PCNA2 and POL30 were transferred from pENTR/D-TOPO® to pDEST™52 using Gateway® LR Clonase™ II (Invitrogen), and the 7.3-kb pYES-TRP1 PvuII-BstEII fragment was ligated to the 2.1-kb pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-POLH PvuII-BstEII fragment carrying POLH or the 2.0-kb pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-RAD30 PvuII-BstEII fragment carrying RAD30. Recombinant plasmids were recovered by transformation into TOP10, and inserts were validated by sequencing in both directions. POLH and PCNA2 were amplified from pENTR/D-TOPO® using primers AtPOLH-1 and AtPOLH-2, or AtPCNA2-1 and AtPCNA2-2, to flank POLH or PCNA2 with 5′EcoRI and 3′XhoI, or 5′BamHI and 3′SalI sites, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBluescript® II SK (+/−), or the BamHI and SalI sites of the GST fusion vector pGEX6p-2, to make pBS-POLH or pGEX-PCNA2, respectively, and were sequenced to ensure that they had not acquired any alterations. The AtPolη UBM2 and PIP2 or PCNA2 were mutated (L631A-P632A, Y666A-F667A and N201K, respectively) by PCR using primers AtPOLH-LP and AtPOLH-2, AtPOLH-YF and AtPOLH-1, or AtPCNA2-N201K and AtPCNA2-2, respectively. AtPolη PIP1 was mutated (F642A-L643A) via the megaprimer method (CITATION): first using primers AtPOLH-FL and M1-RP, and then by using primers M13-RP and M13-UP. The PCR products were digested with ClaI and XhoI (AtPolη-L631A-P632A, -Y666A-F667A), BamHI and XhoI (AtPolη-F642A-L643A) or SalI (PCNA2-N201K) to generate shorter mutated fragments, which were used to replace the corresponding regions in pBS-POLH or pGEX-PCNA2 to make pBS-polh-L631A-P632A, pBS-polh-F642A-643A, pBS-polh-Y666A-F667A and pGEX-pcna2-N201K. The replaced segments were sequenced to confirm the directed mutation(s) and the absence of other changes. For yeast two-hybrid assays polh-L631A-P632A (UBM2*), polh-F642A-L643A (PIP1*) and polh-Y666A-F667A (PIP2*) were amplified from the pBS vectors using primers AtPOLHattB1-F3 and AtPOLHattB2-R. pcna2-N201K (pcna2*) was amplified from the pGEX vector using primers AtPCNA2attB1-F and AtPCNA2attB2-R. The four PCR products were recombined into pDONR™221 using BP Clonase™ (Invitrogen), and were sequenced to ensure that no changes had occurred. For complementation assays, the PIP1* and PIP2* ORFs were amplified from the pBS vectors using primers AtPOLH-F10 and AtPOLH-R10, T/A overhang ligated into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO, excised from the latter vector using SspI and BstEII, ligated into the SspI and BstEII sites of pYES-TRP1 and sequenced to ensure that no changes had occurred. The UBM2* ORF was amplified from the pBS vector using primers POLH-SspI-F and POLH-BstEII-R to generate a SspI site and a BstEII site flanking the ORF, the PCR product was ligated into pCR®-Blunt, excised from the latter vector using SspI and BstEII, ligated into the SspI and BstEII sites of pYES-TRP1 and validated by sequencing. The pcna2* ORF was transferred from pDONR™221 to pDEST™52 using Gateway® LR Clonase™ II (Invitrogen). Yeast cells carrying pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO, pYES-TRP1 or pDEST™52, with inserts under control of a galactose-inducible promoter, were grown in galactose expression medium at 30°C with shaking to 5 × 106 cells ml−1 (determined by Coulter counter, model Z1; Coulter Electronics, http://www.beckmancoulter.com) for UV-C resistance tests or 1 × 107 cells ml−1 for UV-C mutagenesis (lys2-1 reversion) assays. Diluted culture aliquots were spread on pre-warmed (30°C) expression medium with or without lysine, the plates were UV-C irradiated (CITATION), and surviving fractions or lys2-1 reversion frequencies were determined after 5 days dark incubation at 30°C using colony counts for lysine-containing or lysine-free medium, respectively. Data values are the means of at least three independent experiments. Protein interactions were detected using a yeast two-hybrid system (Pro-Quest™ Two-Hybrid System; Invitrogen). Inserts were transferred from pENTR/D-TOPO® or pDONR™221 to the two-hybrid vectors pDEST™22 or pDEST™32 using Gateway® LR Clonase™ II (Invitrogen), pairwise combinations of fusion vectors were transformed into MaV203, and fusion protein interactions were screened on histidine-free medium following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCNA1 amplified from pENTR/D-TOPO® using primers AtPCNA1-1 and AtPCNA1-2 to flank the PCNA1 ORF with 5′BamHI and 3′SalI sites was inserted into the same sites of the GST fusion vector pGEX6p-2, to make pGEX-PCNA1. The pBS-POLH EcoRI–XhoI fragment carrying the POLH ORF was inserted into the same sites of the His6-tag fusion vector pET30a to produce pET-POLH, and the ORFs were verified by sequencing. For pull-down assays, BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RIL cells carrying pGEX-PCNA1, pGEX-PCNA2 or pET-POLH were grown, insert expression was induced to produce GST-PCNA1, GST-PCNA2 or His6-AtPolη fusions, and cells were harvested as described by CITATION. Cells containing GST fusion proteins or His6-AtPolη were resuspended in 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3 (PBS) or binding buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4), respectively. Cell extracts were prepared and GST fusion proteins were purified as described by CITATION. His6-AtPolη was purified from the cell extract using Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare). Fusion proteins were dialysed in PBS, and protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, http://www.piercenet.com). For primer extension assays, BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RIL cells with pET-POLH were treated with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 15°C for 10 h, collected by centrifugation, and were then lysed in 12 ml of EDTA-free 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 20% glycerol, 1x BugBuster® (Novagen), 5 mm imidazole, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 42 U ml−1 Benzonase® nuclease (Novagen). The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged (20 000 g for 20 min at 4°C) and the supernatant was added to TALON® Superflow Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com), washed twice with wash buffer (EDTA-free 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and mixed gently for 30 min. The treated resin was washed twice with wash buffer, applied to a column and was then washed three times with wash buffer. AtPolη was eluted with 5 ml 350 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Purified AtPolH was dialysed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 50% glycerol, and was stored at −80°C. Pull-down assays were performed using MicroSpin GST Purification Modules (GE Healthcare), as described by CITATION, except that 50 μg of GST in PBS was added to one of the modules, and 30 μg of His6-AtPolη was added to all of the modules after the first series of washes. Eluted proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and were visualized by Coomassie blue staining and western analysis using a primary rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, http://www.scbt.com), a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Millipore, http://www.millipore.com) and western Lightning® Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer, http://www.perkinelmer.com) for detection. Reaction mixtures were as described in CITATION, except that 100 μg ml−1 BSA, 250 μM dNTPs, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 nm Cy3-conjugated primer annealed to the template (synthesized as described by CITATION) in a 1:1 ratio, the indicated concentrations of AtPolη, human Polη (prepared as described by CITATION) and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA Pol I (New England BioLabs, http://www.neb.com) were used. The reactions were performed for 10 min at the indicated temperatures, after which they were terminated and the products were visualized as described by CITATION.
