!~ABS~! Multistep phosphorelay (MSP) signaling mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. In Arabidopsis MSP, the signal is transferred from sensor histidine kinase (HK) via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1–AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. In contrast to ancestral two-component signaling in bacteria, protein interactions in plant MSP are supposed to be rather nonspecific. Here, we show that the C-terminal receiver domain of HK CKI1 (CKI1RD) is responsible for the recognition of CKI1 downstream signaling partners, and specifically interacts with AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5 with different affinities. We studied the effects of Mg2+, the co-factor necessary for signal transduction via MSP, and phosphorylation-mimicking BeF3− on CKI1RD in solution, and determined the crystal structure of free CKI1RD and CKI1RD in a complex with Mg2+. We found that the structure of CKI1RD shares similarities with the only known structure of plant HK, ETR1RD, with the main differences being in loop L3. Magnesium binding induces the rearrangement of some residues around the active site of CKI1RD, as was determined by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Collectively, these results provide initial insights into the nature of molecular mechanisms determining the specificity of MSP signaling and MSP catalysis in plants.
!~RES~! To identify potential specificity of the CKI1-mediated MSP we performed extensive in vivo protein–protein interaction studies using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in plant cells (CITATION). We generated 35S promoter-driven BiFC constructs expressing a full-length CKI1 protein or one of the two intracellular CKI1 domains (HK or C-terminal RD, CKI1HK or CKI1RD, respectively) in fusion with the C-terminal YFP fragment (YFP-C), and all six HPt proteins from Arabidopsis (AHP1–AHP6) in fusion with the N-terminal YFP fragment (YFP-N). Using these constructs, the BiFC interaction assay was performed as described previously by CITATION. As shown in Figure 1(a), when the full-length CKI1 protein was co-expressed with AHPs, a strong BiFC signal indicating an interaction of CKI1RD with HPt proteins was observed for AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. A weak YFP fluorescence signal was recorded for AHP1, whereas no detectable interaction occurred with AHP4 and AHP6. Similar fluorescence patterns were observed for the co-expression of individual AHPs with the RD CKI1RD alone (Figure 1b). In the case of full-length CKI1, the BiFC fluorescence outlined the epidermal cells that corresponded to the expected subcellular localization of CKI1 into the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 1a). In contrast to that, interaction with CKI1RD lacking the transmembrane domains occurred in both the cytosol and nucleus (Figure 1b). The fluorescence signal appears stronger with CKI1RD, as the volume of the fluorescence layer is much greater compared with that of the cells expressing the full-length CKI1 protein localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. The interaction patterns in terms of their specificity, however, are the same for both proteins, suggesting that the RD of CKI1 is required and sufficient for selective interaction of CKI1 with a subset of Arabidopsis phosphotransfer proteins AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. Moreover, these results show that membrane localization of CKI1RD is not required for its interaction with AHP proteins. No BiFC signal was observed after co-expression of CKI1HK with either of the AHP proteins (for representative results on the interaction of CKI1HK with AHP2, see Figure S1). [[FIGURE]] To further substantiate CKI1 interactions observed in plants, we studied protein–protein interactions using a Y2H assay. As membrane-localized proteins cannot be used in this type of assay, we omitted the full-length CKI1 from the analysis. The CKI1RD was used as a ‘bait’, whereas the six tested AHP proteins were cloned in the ‘prey’ vector. Although all fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels, we found that CKI1RD interacts only with AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5 (Figure 1c). When compared with AHP2 and AHP3, the growth of isolated colonies in the case of AHP5 indicated that this interaction might be weaker. Thus, similarly to our results from the in planta fluorescent assay, these data indicate that the specific interaction of CKI1 with AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5 is mediated by CKI1RD. As oligomerization of AHPs at high concentrations prevented surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, indirect ELISA was employed to quantify the identified binding of AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5 to CKI1RDin vitro by monoclonal antibodies (αAHP2,3/A4 and αAHP3,5/B; for details on the antibodies specificity, see Figure S2). The obtained dissociation constants showed that AHP2 (Kd = 9.17 ± 0.49 nm) and AHP3 (Kd = 10.5 ± 0.73 nm) bound with similar affinities to CKI1RD, and these affinities are ∼10-fold higher than the affinity of the binding of CKI1RD to AHP5 (Kd = 108 ± 18 nm) (Figure 2). These data are in agreement with the in vivo data determined by BiFC and Y2H techniques (Figure 1), suggesting a sufficient specificity of our in vitro assay. [[FIGURE]] Taken together, using three independent assays, both in vitro and in vivo, we have found that the RD of CKI1 is necessary and sufficient for specific interactions of CKI1 with its downstream signaling partners, the HPt proteins. Importantly, we have found that there is a specificity of the interactions resulting in the preferential interaction of CKI1RD with AHP2 and AHP3, compared with the weaker interaction of CKI1RD with AHP5. To study structural details of the RD of CKI1 at the atomic level, CKI1RD was expressed in E. coli, purified and crystallized (CITATION), then its three-dimensional structure was determined using X-ray diffraction (Table 1, middle column). The crystal structure of CKI1RD shows the conformational conservation of RDs belonging to the CheY-like protein superfamily (CITATION). CKI1RD was found to be folded in a (α/β)5 manner with the central β-sheet formed from five parallel β-strands (β2-β1-β3-β4-β5), surrounded on both sides by two (α1 and α5) and three (α2, α3 and α4) α-helices. Secondary structure elements are connected with five loops, L1–L5 (Figure 3a). The purified protein consists of 207 amino acids, 179 of which are encoded by the CKI1 gene (amino acids 944–1122, numbered according to full-length CKI1). The remaining amino acids are encoded by the vector and, of these, only residues 936–939 are defined in the crystal electron density. Residues 936 and 937 form an additional β-strand (β0) bonded antiparallel to β5 of the central β-sheet. [[FIGURE]] Despite that N-terminal His-tagged CKI1RD was used for the crystallization (see the Experimental procedures), the NMR relaxation measurements (data not shown) revealed that the CKI1RD domain is well ordered, but that the N-terminal tag sequence is highly flexible and does not adopt a well-defined structure. It is therefore highly unlikely that the tag region might be involved in any structural and/or functional interference. To analyze effects of Mg2+ binding and phosphorylation (mimicked by beryllofluoridation) on CKI1RD in solution, a 13C,15N-labelled CKI1RD sample was prepared. Backbone amide as well as 13Cα and 13Cβ resonances were assigned using standard triple-resonance NMR experiments. The assignment was obtained for 147 (91%) residues in a region of the whole construct between P964 and E1124, and for an additional 15 residues of the N-terminal region (Figure 4, in green). With the exception of a few residues (F995, E1035, K1041 and L1042), the missing assignment in the RD (R984–I1114) corresponds to residues C1051–E1060 (Figure 5). These residues follow the active site D1050 in the sequence, and constitute the loop L3 in the crystal structure (Figure 3). Therefore, conformational dynamics of L3 in solution may account for the missing signals in the NMR spectra. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Effects of Mg2+ ions were investigated in titration experiments monitored by running 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra. During titration of a 0.5 mm CKI1RD sample with magnesium chloride aliquots, large changes of 1H and 15N chemical shifts of some signals were observed (Figures 4 and 5a). As some peaks moved significantly upon Mg2+ binding, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra were recorded at 15 mm Mg2+ concentration in order to verify the sequential assignment. Most peaks exhibited fast exchange during titration, but notable line broadening was observed in some cases, including for the well-resolved peaks of D993, N994, S997 and G1019. The dissociation constant estimated from the combined chemical shifts was 0.43 ± 0.06 mm. The peaks that shifted furthest upon Mg2+ binding corresponded to the backbone NH groups of D993, N994, R998 and A1001. These residues are identical with or in close proximity to D992 and D993 in loop L1, i.e. residues corresponding to Mg2+ binding D12 and D13 in CheY (CITATION). Other peaks with large resonance frequency changes corresponded to residues around loops L4 and L5, and to two residues directly preceding the unassigned region in loop L3. Interestingly, several new peaks appeared in the spectra taken at high Mg2+ concentrations. A natural interpretation of this observation was to assume that loop L3 of free CKI1RD is present in more conformations in solution, which are in a dynamic equilibrium with an exchange rate on the time scale of the NMR experiment, and that the Mg2+ binding locks this loop in a single conformation. As L3 contains two methionines (M1053 and M1056), we decided to test this hypothesis by running the NMR experiments on a CKI1RD sample selectively labeled with 15N at the methionines (Figure 4). Whereas the spectra of Mg2+-free, selectively labeled CKI1RD showed three intense signals overlapping with peaks assigned to M1008, M1049 and M1099, the addition of 20 mm Mg2+ increased the number of peaks to six. As the CKI1RD construct contains six methionine residues (not counting the N-terminal methionine), this result proves that the signals of loop L3 were missing in the Mg2+-free form for dynamic reasons, and supports the idea that Mg2+ binding favors a single conformation of loop L3. Interestingly, in addition to the signal originating from the two methionines of L3 (M1053 and M1056), the signal of M944 from the presumably disordered N-terminal region (not visible in the X-ray structure) also appeared only after the addition of Mg2+ ions. In summary, the backbone NH groups most influenced by the Mg2+ binding are located in loop regions surrounding the active site. Met-selective labeling showed that Mg2+ binding stabilizes the conformation of the flexible loop L3. BeF3− was found to mimic phosphorylation and phosphorylation-mediated structural changes of RDs in bacteria (CITATION; CITATION). Here, we used the addition of BeF3− to study potential phosphorylation-mediated changes of CKI1RD in solution. In comparison to the addition of magnesium, beryllofluoridation of the Mg2+-bound CKI1RD had a much smaller but still significant effect on the resonance frequency (Figures 5b1 and S3b1). The most striking difference was observed in loop L1 and in the N-terminal half of the following helix α1. This region exhibited the largest chemical shift changes upon Mg2+ binding (Figures 5a1 and S3a1), but, with the exception of D993 and S997, it remained almost unaffected upon beryllofluoridation (Figures 5b1 and S3b1). On the other hand, significant resonance frequency changes induced by BeF3− were found in loops L4 and L5, together with internal helix α4 and strand β5. Resonance frequency changes in the 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were also monitored for the D1050A mutant of CKI1RD (CKI1RDD1050A) after Mg2+ binding. Whereas loops L4 and L5 of the mutant exhibited resonance frequency changes similar to those observed for the wild type, residues D992 and D993 of loop L1 were almost unaffected (Figures 5a2 and S3a2). This result suggests the importance of D1050 in Mg2+ binding and the subsequent structural changes. No resonance frequency changes were observed upon beryllofluoridation of the Mg2+-bound CKI1RDD1050A protein (Figures 5b2 and S3b2), confirming that D1050 is the residue where beryllofluoridation occurs. The aforementioned chemical shift changes reflect changes in the chemical environment of the observed nuclei, but do not describe structural changes in terms of atomic coordinates. Therefore, we analyzed the structure of a co-crystal of CKI1RD with Mg2+ and BeF3− in order to identify the actual structural changes upon Mg2+ and BeF3− binding. The presence of magnesium in the co-crystals was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. However, we were not able to confirm the presence of BeF3− in the crystal. Thus, the beryllofluoridation of CKI1RD was unstable during crystal formation, most probably because of the high concentration of ammonium sulfate in the crystallization buffer (CITATION). The crystals of Mg2+-bound CKI1RD belong to the same orthorhombic space group C2221 as does the crystal of the Mg2+-free protein, but their unit-cell parameters slightly differ (a = 54.14, b = 100.92 and c = 80.14 Å). The refinement of CKI1RD with Mg2+ gave the final R = 0.177 and Rfree = 0.239 (Table 1). The secondary structure of the Mg2+ complex of CKI1RD in comparison with the free structure (without Mg2+) is only slightly affected, and the overall root-mean-square deviation is only 0.25 Å for 140 equivalent Cα atom pairs (data not shown). The maximum change in Cα atom positions after Mg2+ binding is located in the N-terminal part of loop L5, where conserved K1105 is located (with a shift of 0.4 Å for Cα of K1105; Figure 6). The main effect caused by Mg2+ binding is the chi angle change of the D1050 side chain (C-terminal part of strand β3). Upon magnesium binding, the side chain of D1050 rotates by 90° toward the divalent cation. The connection via a salt bridge between D1050 and K1105 induces the rotation of K1105, whereas the salt bridge remains established (Figure 6; Video Clip S1). This change induces a 3.4-Å shift of Nζ (K1105) and 2-Å shift of Oδ (D1050). No significant structural changes were found in Cα atom positions in loops L3, L4 and L5, and only minor structural changes (<0.5 Å) were determined in terminal atoms of the side chain of corresponding amino acid residues. The only two residues that remain significantly shifted in terminal side chain atoms are Nζ (K1105) and Oδ (D1050). [[FIGURE]] Both residues belong to the active site for the catalysis of magnesium-dependent phosphoryl transfer that is highly conserved among RDs of several bacterial and eukaryotic HKs belonging to the CheY-like superfamily. Here, the active site is formed (according to CheY numbering) by D12, D13, D57, N59, T87 and K109 (CITATION; CITATION). Based on the high level of conservation, we have located the Mg2+ binding site in the structure of CKI1RD. The active site of CKI1RD with the phosphoacceptor D1050 (equivalent to D57 in CheY) and with the Mg2+ binding site is located on the C terminus of the central β3-strand in a pocket delineated by loops L1, L3 and L5. A highly conserved triad of carboxyl oxygens formed by D1050 together with D992 (equivalent to D12 in CheY), D993 (equivalent to D13 in CheY) and carbonyl oxygen of Q1052 (equivalent to N59 in CheY) give the active site an acidic character. The coordination geometry in the vicinity of Mg2+ in our crystal (Figure 6b; Video Clip S1) cannot be exactly described, except for the fact that the central atom is four-coordinated with carboxyl oxygens of D993 and D1050, carbonyl oxygen of Q1052, and with one water molecule that forms a hydrogen bridge to the carboxyl oxygen of D992. Nevertheless, the coordination polyhedron of Mg2+ is identical to the polyhedron of four-times coordinated octahedral Mg2+ in HupRWTN•Mg2+ (CITATION; the root-mean-square deviation between corresponding Mg and O atoms forming the coordination polyhedron in 3MMN and 2JK1 is 0.385 Å), and is very similar to the polyhedron of octahedrally coordinated Mg2+ in BeF3− containing complex YPD1/SLN1-R1•Mg2+•BeF3− (CITATION; the root-mean-square deviation between corresponding Mg and O atoms forming the coordination polyhedron in 3MMN and 2R25 is 0.248 Å). Hence, based on the similarity with the aforementioned published data, there is a high probability that the next two possible Mg2+ coordination positions may be occupied by the second water molecule and by fluorine/oxygen from BeF3−/PO43−, thus completing the coordination number of Mg2+ to six, and the coordination geometry to octahedral. This further confirms the importance of D1050 in the magnesium binding, as suggested by the aforementioned NMR experiments with the CKI1RDD1050A mutant (Figures 5b2 and S3b2). To ascertain a potential influence of those structural changes on the binding properties of CKI1 during MSP, we inspected the affinity of CKI1RD to AHP proteins in the presence and absence of Mg2+. The influence of phosphorylation was examined in the presence of BeF3−. The nM orders of dissociation constants identified in the absence of Mg2+ did not change dramatically after the addition of Mg2+ or after modification with beryllium fluoride (Table 2). Nevertheless, the presence of Mg2+ ions itself slightly favored the interactions with AHP2 at the expense of interactions with AHP3, thus resulting in a twofold preference for AHP2 when compared with AHP3. In contrast, the addition of phosphorylation mimicking BeF3− in the presence of Mg2+ reversed the binding affinities, leading to a 1.5-fold higher preference for AHP3 as compared with AHP2. Thus, although either the presence of Mg2+ or beryllofluoridation has only a limited influence on the interactions between CKI1RD and AHP proteins, these can further modulate the relative specificity of CKI1RD to individual AHPs. Affinity constants were determined by ELISA as described in the Experimental procedures. Binding buffers used: A, PBST (0.05% Tween 20); B, PBST enriched with 5 mm MgCl2; C, PBST enriched with 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm NaF and 0.6 mm BeCl2. Taken together, Mg2+ binds to the active site of CKI1RD and mediates its remodeling, including conformational stabilization of loop L3. In contrast to that, the phosphorylation seems to mediate rather minor structural changes in CKI1RD.
!~MM~! The CKI1RD protein was prepared as previously described (CITATION). The D1050A mutation was introduced using the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, now Agilent, http://www.genomics.agilent.com) with mutagenic primer 5′-GCATTTGGCACGCCATGAATATGTAGTCAAACGG-3′ (the changed nucleotides are set in bold). For producing AHP proteins, the AHP coding sequences were amplified from the Arabidopsis suspension culture cDNA library using appropriate pairs of primers containing EcoRI restriction sites. The sequences of the primers were as follows: for AHP2, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACGCTCTCATTGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTTAGTTAATATCCACTTGAGG-3′; for AHP3, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACACACTCATTGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTTATATATCCACTTGAGGGAT-3′; and for AHP5, 5′-ATAGAATTCATGAACACCATCGTCGTTGCT-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCTAATTTATATCCACTTGAGG-3′ (EcoRI restriction sites are set in bold). The EcoRI fragments of amplified sequences were ligated into pRSET(B) expression plasmid (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, now Merck, http://www.merck-chemicals.com) carrying individual expression plasmids was cultured in Terrific broth (TB) medium at pH 7.5, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and 1% glucose at 22°C. When OD600 reached 0.8, expression was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Three hours after induction at 22°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3220 g for 20 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris–Cl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazol, 10% glycerol, 3.5 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.1% TritonX-100) and broken by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 47 448 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was applied onto a HisTRAP HP (5-ml) column (GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com) equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris–Cl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazol, 10% glycerol and 3.5 mm mercaptoethanol. Proteins were eluted by gradient from 20 to 500 mm imidazol. Proteins were further purified by anion exchange using a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris–Cl, pH 7.9. Adsorbed proteins were eluted using a gradient of 0–2 m NaCl. The fractions containing AHPs were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 ultrafiltration cell with 3-kDa cut-off (Millipore, http://www.millipore.com). Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford protein assay (CITATION), and bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. The protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. DNA constructs for the expression of appropriate fusion proteins were prepared by means of Gateway® technology (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Destination vectors pSPYCE-35S and pSPYNE-35S were used for BiFC (CITATION). For yeast, two-hybrid destination vectors pGBKT7-DEST and pGADT7-DEST were derived from the Matchmaker™ system (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com) (CITATION). All procedures required for in vivo interaction experiments, such as tobacco infiltration, confocal laser-scanning microscopy, yeast transformation, growth assay or western blotting were identical to those described elsewhere (CITATION). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of CKI1RD–AHP complex in solution was determined by ELISA. Maxisorp 96-microtitre plate wells (Nalge Nunc Internacional, http://www.nalgenunc.com) were coated with 100 μl of CKI1RD diluted in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, to a concentration of 170 nm overnight at 4°C, and thereafter washed three times with PBST (PBS, pH 7.2, with 0.05% Tween). Wells were blocked with 150 μl of blocking buffer (PBST with 1% BSA) for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, 100 μl of PBST (buffer A) or PBST supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 (buffer B), and PBST supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm NaF and 0.6 mm BeCl2 (buffer C) containing different concentrations of AHP proteins were added and left to react for 2 h at 25°C with shaking at 300 rpm (Thermo-Shaker PST-60HL, Biosan, http://www.biosan.lv). Wells were washed and 100 μl of blocking buffer containing 33 ng ml−1 of a primary monoclonal antibody, αAHP2,3/A4 or 100 ng ml−1 of αAHP3,5/B were added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, 300 rpm. Both mAbs were raised against recombinant proteins. Peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate were used for detection at 450 nm. Binding curves were calculated using SigmaPlot software (version 10, Systat Software Inc., http://www.systat.com) to determine the dissociation constants using a simple hyperbole fit. Crystallization of the magnesium-free form of CKI1RD was described previously (CITATION). Crystallization of the magnesium-bound form of CKI1RD was performed similarly: we added 21 mm MgCl2, 5.3 mm BeCl2 and 35 mm NaF into the 0.5 mm protein solution, and the crystallization conditions remained the same, with 2.5 m ammonium sulfate used as a precipitant. Crystals of maximum dimensions up to 500 × 200 × 50 μm were obtained within 2–3 days in a 24-well EasyXtal DG-Tool (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com) using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method, with drops containing 1 μl of the protein solution mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution, and equilibrated against 1000 μl of reservoir solution at 20°C. Prior to the diffraction experiment, the crystals were flash-cooled to −173°C in a nitrogen stream after soaking in the cryoprotectant Paratone-N (Molecular Dimensions, http://www.moleculardimensions.com). For collection of the CKI1RD•Mg2+ diffraction data, we used beamline X13 of the DORIS-III storage ring at EMBL/DESY (Hamburg, Germany). All data were processed and merged using the XDS system (CITATION). The structure of CKI1RD•Mg2+ was determined by molecular replacement method with MOLREP (CITATION) using coordinates of metal-free CKI1RD as a search model. The quality of the electron density maps allowed the successful application of the autobuild regime of ARP/wARP (CITATION). A final refinement of models of Mg2+-free and Mg2+-bound forms of CKI1RD was performed using restrained refinement with the maximum likelihood method of REFMAC (CITATION). Manual fine-tuning of both structures was performed with Coot (CITATION). Data collection and refinement statistics for both structures are summarized in Table 1. Molecular graphics images were produced using UCSF Chimera (CITATION). The refined structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 3MM4 and 3MMN. Uniformly 13C-labeled and/or 15N-labeled CKI1RD was produced in M9 minimal medium supplemented with trace metals, vitamins and with 2 g L−1 [13C]glucose and/or 0.5 g L−1 15NH4Cl. Cells were grown at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.8, and expression (16 h at 25°C) was induced by 0.4 mm IPTG. CKI1RD was purified as described earlier (CITATION). Finally, recombinant CKI1RD was concentrated to 0.5 mm in 50 mm Tris–Cl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. CKI1RD selectively labeled with [15N]Met was expressed in M9 medium containing 0.2% glucose according to a procedure described previously (CITATION). Fifteen minutes before induction, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine (100 mg L−1), isoleucine, leucine, valine (50 mg L−1) and [15N]methionine (60 mg L−1) were added to the medium. Expression was induced by 1 mm IPTG, and the protein was expressed at 25°C for 16 h and purified as described above. All NMR spectra were measured at 25°C on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with the cryogenic H/C/N TCI probe head (Bruker, http://www.bruker.com). A sample consisting of 340 μl 1.0 mm uniformly 13C,15N-labeled CKI1RD in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.05% sodium azide and 10% deuterium oxide, placed in a Shigemi tube, was used for the resonance assignment. The sequential assignment was obtained using a standard set of HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra (CITATION). The same sample was used for titration with magnesium chloride aliquots, corresponding to 1.5, 2.5, 8, 25 and 48 mm Mg2+ concentrations (corrected for the quantity bound to EDTA). The HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra were measured on the sample containing 25 mm Mg2+ in order to assign the resonances of the Mg2+-bound CKI1RD form. The titration was repeated with 15 magnesium chloride aliquots, covering a concentration range up to 30 mm, on a sample of 0.6 mm uniformly 15N-labeled CKI1RD in 20 mm Tris–Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm sodium chloride and 10% deuterium oxide, placed in a round-bottom NMR tube. The dissociation constant was obtained from this series of experiments by a nonlinear least squares fitting the compound chemical shift changes (CITATION) to a two-state interaction model. As the presence of EDTA in the sample was needed in long-term studies to prevent the protein from proteolysis, the effect of EDTA on the spectra was checked by repeating the Mg2+ binding experiment on a 0.5 mm uniformly 15N-labeled sample, prepared in the same buffer but in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. No differences in the CKI1RD1H or 15N frequencies were observed. The Mg2+-bound protein for the beryllofluoridation study was prepared by addition of 18 μl 0.5 m magnesium chloride and 6 μl 0.3 m sodium fluoride to 660 μl of the 15N-labeled sample as described above. Beryllofluoridation was monitored by adding aliquots of sodium fluoride and beryllium chloride (in a 3:1 molar ratio), corresponding to 0.17, 0.34, 0.51, 0.68 and 1.0 mm beryllium concentrations. A 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum was recorded at every beryllium concentration. The Mg2+ binding and beryllofluoridation experiments were also performed with uniformly 15N-labeled 0.5 mm samples of CKI1RDD1050A mutant, and with samples of 0.6 mm CKI1RD selectively 15N-labeled at methionines. All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPIPE (CITATION) and analyzed using SPARKY (CITATION). The assigned chemical shifts and measured relaxation data were stored in the BioMagResBank database with accession numbers 16917 (free) and 16918 (Mg2+-bound).
