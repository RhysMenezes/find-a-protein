!~ABS~! Colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots by nonpathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r bacteria triggers a jasmonate/ethylene-dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) that is effective against a broad range of pathogens. Microarray analysis revealed that the R2R3-MYB-like transcription factor gene MYB72 is specifically activated in the roots upon colonization by WCS417r. Here, we show that T-DNA knockout mutants myb72-1 and myb72-2 are incapable of mounting ISR against the pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, Hyaloperonospora parasitica, Alternaria brassicicola, and Botrytis cinerea, indicating that MYB72 is essential to establish broad-spectrum ISR. Overexpression of MYB72 did not result in enhanced resistance against any of the pathogens tested, demonstrating that MYB72 is not sufficient for the expression of ISR. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that MYB72 physically interacts in vitro with the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-LIKE3 transcription factor EIL3, linking MYB72 function to the ethylene response pathway. However, WCS417r activated MYB72 in ISR-deficient, ethylene-insensitive ein2-1 plants. Moreover, exogenous application of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate induced wild-type levels of resistance in myb72-1, suggesting that MYB72 acts upstream of ethylene in the ISR pathway. Collectively, this study identified the transcriptional regulator MYB72 as a novel ISR signaling component that is required in the roots during early signaling steps of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR.
!~RES~! Previously, microarray analysis revealed a large set of genes that showed an altered expression pattern in the roots upon colonization by ISR-inducing WCS417r rhizobacteria (CITATION). To investigate the role of these root-specific, WCS417r-induced genes in ISR signaling, we systematically analyzed knockout mutants of these genes for their ability to express WCS417r-ISR against Pst DC3000. A mutant with a T-DNA insertion in the MYB72 gene, which is specifically up-regulated in the roots upon colonization by WCS417r (CITATION; Fig. 1A ), was identified as being defective in the activation of ISR and was subjected to further detailed studies. Figure 1B shows that knockout mutant myb72-1 (SAIL_713G10) was unable to mount ISR against Pst DC3000 in response to colonization of the roots by WCS417r. [[FIGURE]] Previously, rhizobacterial strain Pseudomonas putida WCS358r and a crude cell wall preparation of WCS417r were demonstrated to trigger the ISR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis, resulting in a similar level of induced protection against Pst DC3000 as ISR induced by live WCS417r bacteria (CITATION). To find out whether ISR triggered by these inducers is also blocked in myb72-1, roots of Columbia-0 (Col-0) and myb72-1 plants were treated with killed WCS417r cells, or with living WCS358r bacteria, and tested for the expression of ISR. Col-0 plants treated with crude WCS417r cell wall material or living WCS358r bacteria both showed similar levels of protection against Pst DC3000 to that induced by live WCS417r cells (Fig. 1B). Knockout mutant myb72-1 was unable to mount ISR in response to any of the inducers, confirming that MYB72 is required for the onset of ISR by these activators. To investigate whether the impaired ISR response of myb72-1 was caused by insufficient root colonization by the rhizobacterial strains, the number of rifampicin-resistant WCS417r and WCS358r bacteria per gram of root fresh weight was determined. No significant differences in the extent of root colonization between Col-0 and myb72-1 plants were observed (Fig. 1C). Thus, the inability of myb72-1 to express WCS417r-mediated ISR was not caused by reduced root colonization. To confirm that the ISR-minus phenotype of knockout mutant myb72-1 was caused by disruption of the MYB72 gene, a second, independent T-DNA insertion mutant, designated myb72-2 (SALK_052993), was tested for its ability to express WCS417r-ISR. Figure 1D shows that myb72-2, like myb72-1, was unable to mount ISR against Pst DC3000, indicating that a functional MYB72 gene is required for the onset of WCS417r-ISR against this pathogen in Arabidopsis. Verification of the predicted T-DNA insertion sites in the myb72-1 and myb72-2 knockout mutants is described in Supplemental Figure S1. Because multiple experiments demonstrated that both mutants were impaired in their ability to mount WCS417r-ISR against Pst DC3000, mutant myb72-1 was used for further experiments. To investigate the effect of the myb72-1 mutation on pathogen-induced SAR, we compared the levels of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR and pathogen-induced SAR in this mutant. SAR was induced 3 d prior to challenge inoculation with virulent Pst DC3000 by infiltrating three lower leaves with avirulent Pst DC3000(avrRpt2). Wild-type Col-0 plants developed significant levels of protection against Pst DC3000 in response to induction of ISR and SAR (Fig. 2A ). In contrast to ISR, SAR was expressed to wild-type levels in myb72-1, indicating that the ability to develop SAR was not altered in this mutant. Similarly, chemical induction of SAR by exogenous application of SA resulted in similar levels of protection against Pst DC3000 in Col-0 and myb72-1 (Fig. 2B), confirming that myb72-1 is not impaired in SAR. [[FIGURE]] Like rhizobacteria-mediated ISR, exogenous application of methyl JA (MeJA) or the ET precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) triggers an enhanced level of resistance against Pst DC3000 (CITATION). To examine the effect of the myb72-1 mutation on resistance induced by these chemicals, Col-0 plants were pretreated with MeJA or ACC at 7 and 4 d before challenge inoculation with virulent Pst DC3000. Figure 2B shows that myb72-1 developed wild-type levels of protection against Pst DC3000 in response to both chemicals, indicating the myb72-1 mutation has no effect on the ability to express enhanced resistance in response to ACC or MeJA. These findings suggest that MYB72 operates upstream of JA and ET in the ISR signaling pathway. WCS417r-mediated ISR is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To examine whether MYB72 is required for the onset of broad-spectrum ISR, we tested the ability of myb72-1 to express ISR against the biotrophic oomycete H. parasitica and the necrotrophic fungi A. brassicicola and Botrytis cinerea. Figure 3A shows that WCS417r-ISR and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced SAR resulted in a relatively moderate, but statistically significant, level of protection of Col-0 plants against H. parasitica. Similar to the bioassays with Pst DC3000, mutant myb72-1 plants failed to develop ISR against this pathogen, whereas induction of SAR resulted in wild-type levels of induced resistance. To test the effectiveness of ISR against A. brassicicola, ISR bioassays were performed in the genetic background of the camalexin-deficient mutant pad3-1. In contrast to wild-type Col-0 plants, pad3-1 is susceptible to A. brassicicola infection and is routinely used in assays to test for induced resistance against this pathogen (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Figure 3B shows that induction of ISR in pad3-1 significantly reduced disease symptoms caused by A. brassicicola infection, whereas the pad3-1/myb72-1 double mutant failed to mount ISR against this pathogen. Similarly, Col-0 plants, but not myb72-1, expressed statistically significant levels of ISR against B. cinerea (Fig. 3C). Together, these results demonstrate that MYB72 is essential for ISR against different types of pathogens. [[FIGURE]] Induced resistance is often associated with priming for enhanced deposition of callose-containing papillae at sites of attempted pathogen attack or tissue injury (CITATION; CITATION). Figure 4 shows that induction of ISR by WCS417r, or SAR by exogenous application of BTH, resulted in a significant decrease of the success rate of H. parasitica spores to penetrate the leaves of wild-type Col-0 plants due to enhanced callose depositions in the epidermal cell layer around the entry sites. Treated mutant npr1-1 plants that are blocked in their ability to express both ISR and SAR did not show this enhanced callose deposition at the sites of attempted pathogen attack and consequently did not display lower penetration success rates of the pathogen, confirming that priming for enhanced callose deposition is associated with ISR and SAR. Priming for enhanced callose deposition was normally expressed in myb72-1 upon induction of SAR with BTH, resulting in a significant decrease in successful spore penetration (Fig. 4). However, unlike BTH, WCS417r did not enhance callose deposition in myb72-1 in response to H. parasitica attack. Hence, although myb72-1 is not impaired in its ability to be primed for enhanced formation of callose-containing papillae, this defense-related trait is not expressed in myb72-1 in response to colonization of the roots by WCS417r bacteria. Together, these results indicate that MYB72 plays an important role in the onset of this primed defense response during ISR. [[FIGURE]] MYB72 transcripts accumulate in the roots upon colonization by WCS417r, whereas systemically in the leaves they are not detectable (CITATION; Fig. 1A). Hence, MYB72 is likely to play a role in the early steps of the ISR signaling pathway. Previously, CITATION demonstrated that, for the onset of ISR, ET signaling is required at the site of application of the ISR inducer. To investigate whether MYB72 gene expression is regulated by ET, MYB72 transcript levels were monitored in the roots by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) upon application of 0.1 mm ACC. Figure 5A shows that the ET-responsive gene EIN3 BINDING FACTOR2 (EBF2; CITATION) is activated in ACC-treated roots. By contrast, MYB72 is not activated upon ACC treatment, indicating that MYB72 gene expression is not regulated by ET. [[FIGURE]] To test whether WCS417r-induced expression of MYB72 in the roots requires ET sensitivity, MYB72 transcript accumulation was examined in the ET-insensitive, ISR-minus mutant ein2-1. Colonization of the roots by WCS417r bacteria activated MYB72 equally in both Col-0 and ein2-1 (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that MYB72 either acts upstream of ET signaling or is corequired with components from the ET signaling pathway during the onset of ISR. To investigate whether MYB72 is not only required but also sufficient for the onset of ISR, transgenic plants that constitutively express MYB72 (35S:MYB72) were generated and tested for enhanced disease resistance. Seven independent homozygous T3 lines (OX1–OX7) were phenotypically characterized. All transgenic lines displayed a phenotype that was similar to the parental Col-0 line and the empty vector (EV) control (Supplemental Fig. S2). RNA-blot analysis of roots and shoots of the 35S:MYB72 lines confirmed constitutive expression of MYB72 in all lines, albeit to varying levels (Fig. 6A ). Bioassays for induced resistance assays were performed with Col-0, the EV control, and the seven 35S:MYB72 transgenic lines. Figure 6B shows that the level of basal resistance against Pst DC3000, H. parasitica, and B. cinerea in lines OX2 and OX7 was not significantly enhanced compared to that from the EV control line. Resistance assays with the other OX lines yielded similar results (data not shown), indicating that ectopic expression of MYB72 is not sufficient for the onset of ISR. [[FIGURE]] If MYB72 is essential but not sufficient for the onset of ISR, then additional components are likely to be corequired. Transcription factors usually exert their action in a complex with other proteins. Earlier, a systematic search for proteins that physically interact with MYB transcription factors was initiated by members of the EU-funded Regulatory Gene Initiative in Arabidopsis consortium. Using the ProQuest yeast two-hybrid system (Invitrogen), this screen revealed that MYB72 physically interacts with the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-like protein EIL3 (At1g73730; data not shown). To confirm the interaction of MYB72 with EIL3, the full-length coding regions of MYB72 and EIL3 were isolated, fused to the DNA binding domain (BD) and transcription activation domain (AD) of GAL4, and tested in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Figure 7A shows that cells containing the BD:MYB72 fusion with the AD:EIL3 fusion, and cells containing both the BD:EIL3 and the AD:MYB72 fusion were capable of growth on selective dropout (SD) medium to which 100 mm of the His biosynthesis inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) was added. Cells containing either AD:MYB72 or AD:EIL3 in combination with GAL4 BD fused to the full-length Arabidopsis FRIGIDA protein (BD:FRI; CITATION), which were used as negative controls, did not grow on the selective medium. Cells containing either the BD:MYB72 or the BD:EIL3 fusion with the empty GAL4 AD vector showed a low level of growth, indicating a low level of auto activation of the reporter gene in these combinations. Together, these results indicate that MYB72 and EIL3 interact in vitro. The EIL3 gene is expressed in the roots to similar levels as the constitutively transcribed ubiquitin gene UBI10 (Supplemental Fig. S3). Although EIL3 mRNA levels slightly rose in the roots upon colonization by WCS417r, this rise was not statistically significant. Coexpression of MYB72 and EIL3 makes the MYB72-EIL3 interaction in planta theoretically feasible. However, future studies on the interaction of MYB72 and EIL3 in planta should shed light on the occurrence and significance of this interaction in the onset of ISR. [[FIGURE]] The EIL3 paralogs EIN3, EIL1, and EIL2 have been demonstrated to function as key transcription factors of ET-regulated gene expression and to act as positive regulators of ET signaling (CITATION). Because MYB72 acts upstream of ET signaling or is corequired with components of the ET signaling pathway during the onset of ISR (Fig. 5), we investigated whether the ISR-minus phenotype of the myb72-1 knockout mutant is caused by a reduced sensitivity to ET. The triple response is a reaction of etiolated seedlings to ET and is commonly used as a reliable marker for ET sensitivity (CITATION). Etiolated Col-0, ET-insensitive ein2-1, and myb72-1 seedlings were grown in the dark on Murashige and Skoog agar plates with or without ACC. Ten days after germination, Col-0 seedlings grown on a concentration range of ACC showed a typical ET-induced growth inhibition of the hypocotyl and root, both characteristics of the triple response (Fig. 7B). As expected, the triple response was not apparent in the ET-insensitive ein2-1 seedlings. In contrast, in mutant myb72-1 seedlings, the triple response was indistinguishable from that in wild-type Col-0 plants. These results demonstrate that the absence of a functional MYB72 protein does not affect ET sensitivity. Hence, the inability of myb72-1 plants to mount ISR is not caused by an inability to react to ET in this mutant.
!~MM~! Nonpathogenic, rifampicin-resistant Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r and Pseudomonas putida WCS358r bacteria were used for induction of ISR (CITATION). Both strains were grown for 24 h at 28°C on King's medium B (KB) agar plates (CITATION), as described previously (CITATION). Crude cell wall material of WCS417r was prepared according to CITATION. Colonization of the rhizosphere of wild-type and mutant plants by rifampicin-resistant WCS417r and WCS358r bacteria was examined at the end of each ISR bioassay as described (CITATION). An avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000, carrying the avirulence gene avrRpt2 [Pst DC3000(avrRpt2); CITATION], was used for SAR induction. Pst DC3000(avrRpt2) bacteria were grown overnight at 28°C in liquid KB medium supplemented with 25 mg mL−1 kanamycin. Virulent Pst DC3000 (CITATION) was used for challenge inoculations and cultivated in a similar manner in liquid KB medium without kanamycin. After centrifugation, bacterial cells were resuspended in 10 mm MgSO4, 0.015% (v/v) Silwet L-77 (Van Meeuwen Chemicals) to a final density of 2.5 × 107 cfu mL−1. Hyaloperonospora parasitica strain WACO9 was maintained on susceptible Col-0 plants as described by CITATION. Sporangia were obtained by washing leaves that were densely covered by sporangiophores in distilled water, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in water to a final density of 5 × 104 cfu mL−1. Alternaria brassicicola strain MUCL20297 was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco Laboratories) plates containing penicillin (100 μg mL−1) and streptomycin (200 μg mL−1) for 2 weeks at 22°C. Conidia were harvested as described by CITATION and resuspended in water to a final density of 1 × 106 spores mL−1. Botrytis cinerea strain B0510 was grown on one-half-strength PDA plates containing penicillin (100 μg mL−1) and streptomycin (200 μg mL−1) for 2 weeks at 22°C. Spores were collected and resuspended in one-half-strength potato dextrose broth (Difco Laboratories) to a final density of 5.5 × 105 spores mL−1. After a 3-h incubation period, the spores were used for inoculation of plants as described (CITATION). Seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Col-0, mutants ein2-1 (CITATION), npr1-1 (CITATION), pad3-1 (CITATION), myb72-1 (SAIL_713G10), myb72-2 (SALK_052993), the double mutant pad3-1/myb72-1, the transgenic lines 35S:MYB72-OX1 to -OX7, and the corresponding EV control line EV were sown in quartz sand. Two-week-old seedlings were transferred to 60-mL pots containing a sand-potting soil mixture that had been autoclaved twice for 20 min with a 24-h interval. For ISR bioassays, a suspension of ISR-inducing WCS417r or WCS358r bacteria (109 cfu mL−1) had been mixed thoroughly through the soil to a final density of 5 × 107 cfu g−1, as described previously (CITATION). Control soil was supplemented with an equal volume of 10 mm MgSO4. Plants were cultivated in a growth chamber with a 9-h day (200 μE m−2 s−1 at 24°C) and a 15-h night (20°C) cycle at 70% relative humidity. Plants were supplied with modified one-half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (CITATION) once a week, as described (CITATION). Homozygous knockout mutants SAIL_713G10 (CITATION), designated myb72-1, and SALK_052993 (CITATION), designated myb72-2, containing a T-DNA insertion in the MYB72 gene (At1g56160), were grown as described above. Confirmation of the T-DNA insert in SAIL_713G10 was obtained by PCR on genomic DNA using T-DNA left border primer T1 and MYB72-specific primers MYB72-F1 and MYB72-R1 following a procedure that was described previously (CITATION). Mutant SALK_052993 was checked for the presence of T-DNA using primer T2, and MYB72-specific primers MYB72-F2 and MYB72-R2. The primers used are listed in Supplemental Table S1. The exact insertion sites of the T-DNAs in myb72-1 and myb72-2 were determined by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. A fusion product of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the coding region of MYB72 was created by double-joint PCR as described by CITATION. The resulting 35S:MYB72 fusion product was cloned into the binary vector pGreenII229 (CITATION). A derivative of the pGreenII229 vector was used as the EV control. Correct construction of the plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the binary vectors were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58(pMP90) (CITATION), after which Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed according to the floral-dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected by spraying T1 progeny with BASTA Finale SL14 (Bayer CropScience BV) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting MYB72-overexpressing lines 35S:MYB72-OX1 to -OX7 were selfed and homozygous T3 lines were selected for use in disease resistance assays. Induction of ISR with living rhizobacteria was performed by mixing ISR-inducing rhizobacteria through the soil as described above. For tests with killed cells, a crude cell wall preparation of WCS417r bacteria (in 10 mm MgSO4) was mixed through the soil in a similar manner, using the equivalent of the number of live bacteria introduced to the soil (5 × 107 cfu g−1). Seven days before challenge inoculation, a similar amount of the crude cell wall material was applied to each plant as a soil drench as described previously (CITATION). Biological induction of SAR was performed 3 d before challenge inoculation by pressure infiltrating three lower leaves with a suspension of Pst DC3000(avrRpt2) bacteria at 107 cfu mL−1, as described (CITATION). For chemical induction of resistance, treatments were performed 7 and 4 d prior to challenge inoculation with Pst DC3000, or 3 d before challenge with H. parasitica WACO9. For the Pst DC3000 bioassays, the soil was drenched with 10 mL of either 100 μm MeJA, 1 mm ACC, or 1 mm SA. For SAR induction in the H. parasitica bioassays, the soil was drenched with 6 mL of 300 μm BTH. Control plants were treated with an equal volume of water. For induction of SAR in the H. parasitica bioassays, the functional SA analog BTH is routinely used instead of SA. The reason for this is the fact that, in our experimental setup, the young seedlings used in these assays are relatively sensitive to phytotoxic effects of SA. MeJA was purchased from Serva Brunschwig, ACC from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie BV, SA from Malinckrodt Baker BV, and BTH (BION) from CIBA-GEIGY GmbH. Pst DC3000 bioassays were performed essentially as described by CITATION. Plants were challenged when 5 weeks old by dipping the leaves for 2 s in a solution of 10 mm MgSO4, 0.015% (v/v) Silwet L-77 containing 2.5 × 107 cfu mL−1 Pst DC3000 bacteria. Four days after challenge, disease severity was assessed by determining the percentage of diseased leaves per plant. Leaves were scored as diseased when showing necrotic or water-soaked lesions surrounded by chlorosis. The disease index was calculated by determining the proportion of leaves with disease symptoms per plant (n = 20). H. parasitica bioassays were performed as described by CITATION. Three-week-old Arabidopsis Col-0, npr1-1, and myb72-1 plants were misted with a H. parasitica spore suspension containing 5 × 104 sporangiospores mL−1. Disease symptoms were scored at 9 d after inoculation for about 250 leaves per treatment. Disease ratings were expressed as severity of disease symptoms and pathogen sporulation on each leaf: I, no sporulation; II, trailing necrosis; III, <50% of the leaf area covered by sporangia; IV, >50% of the leaf area covered with sporangia, with additional chlorosis and leaf collapse. Quantification of the proportion of callose-inducing and noninducing spores was performed 2 d after inoculation as described by CITATION. Inspection of the leaves was performed with an epifluorescence microscope containing a UV filter (bandpass 340–380 nm, longpath 425 nm). Callose-inducing spores were scored as unsuccessful penetrations, whereas those that did not trigger a callose response were scored as successful penetrations. A. brassicicola bioassays were performed as described (CITATION). Because Arabidopsis Col-0 is resistant to A. brassicicola, whereas the camalexin-deficient mutant pad3-1 (CITATION) is susceptible (CITATION; CITATION), the role of MYB72 was investigated in the double mutant pad3-1/myb72-1, created through genetic crossing. When 5 weeks old, homozygous pad3-1 and pad3-1/myb72-1 plants (n = 20) were challenge inoculated with A. brassicicola by applying 3-μL droplets of water containing 1 × 106 spores mL−1 onto the second, third, and fourth true leaf pair of each plant. At 5 d after challenge, disease severity was determined. Disease rating was expressed on the basis of symptom severity: I, no visible disease symptoms; II, nonspreading lesion; III, spreading lesion without tissue maceration; IV, spreading lesion with tissue maceration and sporulation of the pathogen. B. cinerea inoculations were performed with 5-week-old Col-0 and myb72-1 plants (n = 20) by applying 5-μL droplets of the spore suspension onto fresh needle-prick wounds on the second, third, and fourth true leaf pair of each plant as described (CITATION). At 5 d after challenge, disease severity was determined. Disease ratings were expressed as the percentage of leaves showing spreading lesions. Extraction of total RNA, RNA gel-blot analysis with a gene-specific probe for MYB72 (At1g56160), was performed as described (CITATION; CITATION). Q-PCR was performed essentially as described by CITATION. To check for genomic DNA contamination, a PCR with primers designed on EIL2 (At5g21120; EIL2-F and EIL2-R) was carried out. Efficiency of cDNA synthesis was assessed by Q-PCR, using primers of the constitutively expressed gene UBI10 (At4g05320; UBI10-F and UBI10-R). Primers for MYB72 (At1g56160; MYB72-F4 and MYB72-R4), EIL3 (At1g73730; EIL3-F and EIL3-R), and the ET-responsive gene EBF2 (At5g25350; EBF2-F and EBF2-R) were designed and checked as described by CITATION. Nucleotide sequences of all primers are given in Supplemental Table S1. Q-PCR analysis was performed in optical 96-well plates with a MyIQ Single Color Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad), using SYBR Green to monitor double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) synthesis. Each reaction consisted of 1 μL of cDNA, 0.5 μL of each of the two gene-specific primers (10 pmol μL−1), and 3.5 μL 2× IQ SYBR Green Supermix reagent (Bio-Rad) in a final volume of 15 μL. The following PCR program was used for all PCR reactions: 95°C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 59.5°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Threshold cycle (CT) values were calculated using Optical System Software, version 1.0, for MyIQ (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, CT values were normalized for differences in dsDNA synthesis, using those of the constitutively expressed reference gene At1g13320 as described (CITATION), after which the fold differences in transcript levels were calculated. Constructs for yeast two-hybrid analyses were generated using vectors pDEST32 and pDEST22 (Invitrogen) for protein fusions to the GAL4 DNA BD or transcriptional AD, respectively. Full-length coding regions of MYB72 and EIL3 cDNA were introduced in both vectors using GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Clones containing the BD:MYB72, AD:MYB72, BD:EIL3, and AD:EIL3 fusions were checked by sequence analysis and subsequently used in the yeast two-hybrid assay. AD and BD plasmids were transformed into the a and α mating types of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ69-4, using a lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol protocol described by CITATION. PJ69-4 carries ADE2, HIS3, URA, and LacZ reporters for reconstituted GAL4 activity (CITATION). Transformants were selected on yeast-selective drop-out (SD) medium lacking either Leu (−leu) for selection of the BD vectors or Trp (−trp) for selection of the AD vectors. Opposite mating types were cocultured overnight on nutrient-rich YAPD medium (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie BV) at 30°C. Diploids harboring both plasmids were selected on SD medium lacking both Leu and Trp (−leu, −trp) and used in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Autoactivation levels of yeast transformants harboring either BD:MYB72 or BD:EIL3 were determined using SD medium lacking Leu, adenine, uracil, and His (−leu, −ade, −ura, −his), to which 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, or 100 mm of the His biosynthesis inhibitor 3-AT was added (CITATION). Because autoactivation could not be suppressed fully when using 100 mm 3-AT, only this concentration was used in the assay. The yeast two-hybrid assay of interactions between MYB72 and EIL3 was performed by growing the yeast strains with the different two-hybrid combinations on selective sd medium (−leu, −trp, −ade, −ura, −his, +3-AT) for 3 d at 20°C to reduce background growth levels. Seeds of Arabidopsis were surface sterilized for 5 min in 5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol, and air dried. Seeds were subsequently distributed evenly on 1.0% (w/v) agar medium (pH 5.7) containing 0.5% (w/v) Murashige and Skoog salts (Duchefa BV), 0.5% (w/v) Suc, and different concentrations of filter-sterilized ACC, which was added from a 10 mm stock solution. The effect of ACC-derived ET on hypocotyl and primary root length in etiolated seedlings was determined essentially according to CITATION. After pregermination in the dark for 2 d at 4°C, seedlings were grown for an additional 3 to 7 d at 20°C in darkness after which the triple response was monitored.
