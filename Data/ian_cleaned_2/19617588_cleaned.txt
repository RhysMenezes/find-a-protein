!~ABS~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) tryptophan-proline-proline (WPP)-domain proteins, WPP1 and WPP2, are plant-unique, nuclear envelope-associated proteins of unknown function. They have sequence similarity to the nuclear envelope-targeting domain of plant RanGAP1, the GTPase activating protein of the small GTPase Ran. WPP domain-interacting tail-anchored protein 1 (WIT1) and WIT2 are two Arabidopsis proteins containing a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal predicted transmembrane domain. They are required for RanGAP1 association with the nuclear envelope in root tips. Here, we show that WIT1 also binds WPP1 and WPP2 in planta, we identify the chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70-1 (HSC70-1) as in vivo interaction partner of WPP1 and WPP2, and we show that HSC70-1 interacts in planta with WIT1. WIT1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-WIT1 are targeted to the nuclear envelope in Arabidopsis. In contrast, GFP-WIT1 forms large cytoplasmic aggregates when overexpressed transiently in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermis cells. Coexpression of HSC70-1 significantly reduces GFP-WIT1 aggregation and permits association of most GFP-WIT1 with the nuclear envelope. Significantly, WPP1 and WPP2 show the same activity. A WPP1 mutant with reduced affinity for GFP-WIT1 fails to decrease its aggregation. While the WPP-domain proteins act on a region of WIT1 containing the coiled-coil domain, HSC70-1 additionally acts on the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Taken together, our data suggest that both HSC70-1 and the WPP-domain proteins play a role in facilitating WIT1 nuclear envelope targeting, which is, to our knowledge, the first described in planta activity for the WPP-domain proteins.
!~RES~! To identify proteins interacting with WPP1 and WPP2 in Arabidopsis, transgenic plants were made that express either WPP1 or WPP2 fused to a tandem affinity purification tag (CITATION). After tandem affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and silver staining, the excised bands were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Five peptides corresponding to Arabidopsis cytosolic/nuclear HSC70 were identified in an 85-kD band of the TAP-WPP2 pull-down fraction. Similarly, four peptides belonging to the same HSC70 group of proteins, coming from an 85-kD band of the TAP-WPP1 pull-down fraction, were recognized (Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The Arabidopsis genome encodes five different cytosolic/nuclear HSP70 genes, three of which are expressed constitutively (HSC70-1, HSC70-2, and HSC70-3; CITATION). Sequences of several identified peptides do not allow identification of a specific HSP70, due to a high sequence similarity among different family members. However, some of the peptides unequivocally identified HSC70-1 (At5g02500) and HSC70-3 (At3g09440; Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). To confirm the interactions between WPP1, WPP2, HSC70-1, and HSC70-3, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned and HA-tagged proteins were coexpressed with GFP-tagged proteins by agroinfiltration in N. benthamiana. Figure 1A shows that WPP1 bound both HSC70-1 and HSC70-3, while WPP2 bound HSC70-1 but not HSC70-3 in this assay. [[FIGURE]] Two coiled-coil proteins WIT1 and WIT2 had been previously identified as in vivo WPP1 and WPP2 interactors from the same tandem affinity purification fractions (CITATION). Figure 1B shows that WPP1-WIT1 and WPP2-WIT1 interactions occur after agroinfiltration in N. benthamiana. Interactions between WPP-domain proteins and endogenous WIT1 or endogenous HSC70 were subsequently tested in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing either WPP1-GFP or WPP2-GFP under the control of their own promoters. In these lines, WPP1-GFP and WPP2-GFP are associated with the NE, Golgi-like speckles, and a meshwork-like structure that most likely represents ER, similar to the published 35S-driven fusions (CITATION; data not shown). Figure 1C shows that WPP1 and WPP2 coimmunoprecitipate endogenous WIT1 and endogenous HSC70. Although the anti-HSC70 antibody recognizes all cytosolic forms of HSP70 (CITATION), this pool consists mostly of the constitutively expressed HSC70-1, HSC70-2, and HSC70-3 isoforms (CITATION), thus likely representing the isoforms coimmunoprecipitated by WPP1 and WPP2. In agreement with the role in anchoring RanGAP1 to the NE, both endogenous WIT1 and GFP-WIT1 are targeted to the NE in Arabidopsis (CITATION; Fig. 2A ). However, the attempts to localize GFP-WIT1 driven by the 35S promoter in different transient transformation systems repeatedly showed that overexpressed GFP-WIT1 forms large aggregate-like fluorescent bodies in the cytoplasm (called aggregates from here on). The aggregates occurred when GFP-WIT1 was expressed in protoplasts derived from an N. benthamiana cell culture or from Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll cells and in agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaves, when the strong silencing suppressor p19 was coinfiltrated (Fig. 2, B and C; Supplemental Fig. S1A). No obvious underlying structure, such as membrane whorls, could be observed within the aggregates, at the level of resolution of confocal microscopy (Supplemental Fig. S2). In the absence of p19, association of WIT1 with the NE could be detected (Supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that the aggregates were based on the high level of protein expression in the presence of p19 (Fig. 2C, left). Consistently, when the expression level of GFP-WIT1 was decreased by decreasing the OD600 of the infiltrated Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture to one-fifth or one-tenth of the value used for other experiments, the overall weaker WIT1 signal was now also found associated with the NE (Supplemental Fig. S1B). [[FIGURE]] To further define the nature of the WIT1 aggregates, colocalization experiments with a marker that labels the ER were performed (CITATION). WIT1 aggregates clearly colocalized with the ER marker (Fig. 2D, top). The ER marker by itself did not show any aggregate formation (data not shown), as described previously (CITATION). In some cells, WIT1 and the ER marker colocalized in a meshwork-like pattern, indicative of ER (Fig. 2D, bottom). This suggests that aggregates consist at least in part of WIT1-associated ER material. Studies in animals suggest that membrane insertion of some TA proteins with very hydrophobic TMDs is assisted by chaperones, without which they form insoluble aggregates (CITATION). The Hsc70/Hsp40 chaperone complex was identified as one of the two ATP-dependent complexes that interact with mammalian TA protein substrates in vitro and assist in their delivery (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Because WIT1 and HSC70 had both been found in an in vivo complex with WPP1 and WPP2, we tested whether Arabidopsis HSC70-1 or HSC70-3 would prevent the cytoplasmic aggregation of WIT1. Since WPP-domain proteins interact with both WIT1 and HSC70-1/HSC70-3, we also tested their effect on WIT1 localization. HA-tagged HSC70-1, HSC70-3, and WPP-domain proteins were coexpressed one by one with GFP-WIT1 in N. benthamiana. Coagroinfiltration of GFP-WIT1 with HSC70-1, WPP1, or WPP2 led to a significantly reduced number of WIT1 aggregates compared with GUS coexpression (Fig. 3A ). In addition, the association of WIT1 with the NE could be detected when HSC70-1, WPP1, or WPP2 were coexpressed (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. S4). The percentage of cells that contained aggregates decreased from about 73% in case of GUS coexpression, to 31%, 23%, and 17% for HSC70-1, WPP1, and WPP2 coexpression, respectively (Fig. 3B). In contrast, coexpression of HSC70-3 did not decrease WIT1 aggregation (Fig. 3, A and B; Supplemental Fig. S5). Immunoblot analysis showed that all HA-tagged proteins were expressed and that the level of GFP-WIT1 was comparable in all samples (Fig. 3C). Importantly, it was highest in the sample coexpressing WPP2, indicating that the reduced number of WIT1 aggregates observed for HSC70-1, WPP1, and WPP2 coexpression is not simply based on lower WIT1 expression levels. Cells showing GFP-WIT1 aggregation were viable, either when GFP-WIT1 was present alone or in combination with HA-GUS or HA-HSC70-3, judged by the staining of cell walls only with propidium iodide (Supplemental Fig. S6; data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To test if the different effects of HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 on the aggregates correlate with their ability to bind GFP-WIT1, samples from the coinfiltrated leaves were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation. Figure 3D shows that when similar amounts of HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, significantly more GFP-WIT1 was detected in the precipitates with HSC70-1 than with HSC70-3 (compare lanes 4 and 8 in Fig. 3D). No signal was detected from leaves coexpressing free GFP. This result suggests higher stability of the complex containing WIT1 and HSC70-1 than the one containing WIT1 and HSC70-3, consistent with the observed effect on the GFP-WIT1 aggregates. To also test the interaction of WIT1 with endogenous HSC70 in Arabidopsis, a coimmunoprecipitation using transgenic plants expressing GFP-WIT1 under the control of the 35S promoter was performed. As a control, a transgenic plant expressing 35S-driven GFP was used. Unlike GFP, which did not coimmunoprecipitate any HSC70, GFP-WIT1 bound significant amounts of endogenous HSC70 (Supplemental Fig. S7). The conserved amino acid motif WPP in the WPP domain of RanGAP1 is critical for RanGAP1 binding to WIT1 (CITATION). The WPP domains of RanGAP1 and WPP1 show high sequence similarity and share the conserved WPP motif (CITATION; CITATION). A WPP to AAP mutation was introduced into WPP1, and the effect on the GFP-WIT1 aggregates was tested in N. benthamiana. While WPP1 largely prevented formation of GFP-WIT1 aggregates (as shown in Fig. 3), WPP1WPP/AAP failed to reduce WIT1 aggregates when the two proteins were coexpressed (Fig. 4A ; Supplemental Fig. S8). The percentage of cells that contained aggregates when WPP1WPP/AAP was coinfiltrated was 77%, compared to 24% in the case of the wild-type protein and based on three independent experiments. Consistently, the interaction between WPP1WPP/AAP and WIT1 was largely reduced (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the effect of WPP1 on the GFP-WIT1 aggregates is specific and depends on the ability of two proteins to interact. [[FIGURE]] To test whether amino acids 1 to 660 of WIT1, containing the coiled-coil domain but lacking the TMD (Supplemental Fig. S9), would also form aggregates, GFP-WIT11-660 was expressed in N. benthamiana. When coexpressed alone or with the unrelated HA-GUS construct, GFP-WIT11-660 formed aggregates in the majority of cells. These aggregates differed from those formed by GFP-WIT1 in that they did not cause the ER marker to coaggregate, consistent with the absence of a TMD on this construct (data not shown). Nevertheless, coinfiltrated WPP2 and HSC70-1 also significantly reduced the number of GFP-WIT11-660 aggregates (Fig. 5A ). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that all three HA-tagged proteins were expressed. The level of GFP-WIT11-660 was only slightly reduced when WPP2 or HSC70-1 was present, compared to GUS coexpression (Fig. 5B). WPP2 and HSC70-1 reduced the number of GFP-WIT11-660 aggregates to a similar degree (Fig. 5C). Immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody showed that both HA-WPP2 and HA-HSC70-1 coimmunoprecipitated GFP-WIT1 and GFP-WIT11-660 equally well (Fig. 5E), indicating that both proteins bind to WIT1 in the absence of the C-terminal predicted TMD. Based on our data with other WPP-interacting coiled-coil proteins, binding between GFP-WIT11-660 and WPP2 most likely depends on the coiled-coil domain (CITATION; CITATION). This suggests that at least in case of the WPP-domain proteins, the aggregates are prevented by association of a WPP-domain protein with the long coiled-coil domain of WIT1. [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, while HSC70-1 prevented aggregate formation of GFP-WIT11-660, the number of cells with proper NE targeting of this construct was not increased, indicating that in N. benthamiana a factor that is required for NE targeting of GFP-WIT11-660 might be missing, at least under the condition where both WIT1 and HSC70-1 are overexpressed. In contrast, HA-WPP2 coinfiltration not only reduced the number of aggregates but also increased the number of cells showing GFP-WIT11-660 at the NE (Fig. 5D), suggesting that WPP2 is involved in an additional step required for NE targeting in this background. When expressed alone or with the GUS construct in N. benthamiana, GFP-TMDWIT1, containing the very C-terminal 43 amino acids of WIT1, including the putative TMD (Supplemental Fig. S9), formed aggregates too, however, of a different shape (Fig. 6A ; Supplemental Fig. S10). The aggregates were smaller, typically roundish, and sometimes appeared hollow. They were labeled by the ER marker (Supplemental Fig. S10), suggesting an ER membrane nature of the structures. Coexpression of HSC70-1 caused a decrease in the number of aggregates, while WPP2 had no significant effect (Fig. 6, A and B). Immunoblot analysis showed that all three HA-tagged proteins were expressed and that the expression level of GFP-TMDWIT1 was comparable in all three samples (Fig. 6C). This suggests that while HSC70-1 also acts somewhat to prevent aggregate formation of the WIT1 C terminus, WPP2 requires a domain within WIT11-660 for its activity. [[FIGURE]] Since we have shown that WPP1 interacts with HSC70-1, WPP1 interacts with WIT1, and HSC70-1 interacts with WIT1, we asked if the three proteins are in the same complex. Therefore, HA-HSC70-1, WPP1-GFP, and FLAG-WIT1 were coinfiltrated in N. benthamiana, and as a control, GFP was coexpressed with HA-HSC70-1 and FLAG-WIT1. Samples were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody. HA-HSC70-1 bound both WPP1-GFP and FLAG-WIT1, but not GFP (Fig. 7 , HA-eluted). Then, anti-HA immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with the anti-GFP antibody. FLAG-WIT1 was only detected in the sample that contained WPP1-GFP (Fig. 7, GFP IP). These data show that WIT1 is simultaneously associated with both HSC70-1 and WPP1 and suggests that this ternary complex might be active in preventing the aggregates of WIT1. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The WPP1 gene was subcloned from pBD-GAL4 (CITATION) to pENTR3C (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI restriction site. Cloning of the WPP2 gene into pENTR3C (Invitrogen) was described previously (CITATION). cDNAs of HSC70-1 and HSC70-3 (U09493 and U10908, respectively) were acquired from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). Primers 5′-CACCATGTCGGGTAAAGGAGAAGGACC-3′ and 5′-TTAGTCGACCTCCTCGATCTTAGG-3′ were used to amplify the HSC70-1 cDNA from the vector U09493 and insert it into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). Primers 5′-CACCATGGCTGGTAAAGGAGAAGGTCC-3′ and 5′-TTAGTCGACTTCCTCAATCTTGGG-3′ were used to amplify the HSC70-3 cDNA from the vector U10908 and insert it into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The inserts were confirmed by sequencing. The WPP1, WPP1WPP/AAP, WPP2, HSC70-1, HSC70-3, and GUS (Invitrogen) cDNAs were moved into the HA-tag destination vector pEarleyGate201 (CITATION). The N-terminal TAP-WPP1 fusion construct was obtained by LR recombination (Invitrogen) with the NTAPi binary vector (CITATION). Constructs in pFGC5941 expressing GFP, WPP1-GFP, and WPP2-GFP (CITATION), pK7WGF2 expressing GFP, GFP-WIT1, GFP-WIT1ΔTMD, and GFP-TMDWIT1, NTAPi expressing WPP2, and pEarleyGate201 expressing FLAG-WIT1 (CITATION) were described previously. WPP1:WPP1-GFP and WPP2:WPP2-GFP in pFGC5941 were cloned as EcoRI/NcoI PCR fragments using primers 5′-GGAATTCCGATAATGTATTTTTATTGACCAATTC-3′ and 5′-CATGCCATGGAAGCTTCACTTGAATC-3′ for WPP1 and 5′-GGAATTCCTGTCCCATCTCCAACAAAA-3′ and 5′-CATGCCATGGAAGCCTCACTCTTC-3′ for WPP2, replacing the 35S promoter with a WPP1 genomic fragment containing promoter, 5′ untranslated region, and coding sequence of WPP1 (2016 bp) or with a WPP2 genomic fragment containing promoter, 5′ untranslated region, and coding sequence of WPP2 (2135 bp). The ER mCherry marker containing signal peptide of AtWAK2 and HDEL retention signal in pFGC19 (CITATION) was acquired from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The conserved WPP motif in WPP1 was mutated to AAP using the mutagenic primer 5′-CATTTCCCTCAGAATCGCGGCACCGACTCAAAAAACTC-3′ and its complementary primer in pENTR3C (Invitrogen), using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmid expressing TAP-WPP1 was mobilized into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI. Transconjugants were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL spectinomycin, 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Plasmids expressing WPP1-GFP and WPP2-GFP under the control of their respective promoters were mobilized into the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation. Transformed agrobacteria were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 30 μg/mL gentamicin. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia wild-type plants were transformed by floral dipping (CITATION) and selected for BASTA resistance. The generation of transgenic plants expressing TAP-WPP2 or GFP-WIT1 was described previously (CITATION). Maintenance of Nicotiana benthamiana cell culture, isolation of protoplasts, and transformation by electroporation were performed as described (CITATION). Ten micrograms of GFP-WIT1 plasmid was used for electroporation, and localization of the expressed protein was tested by confocal microscopy after overnight incubation. The preparation of the leaf tissue, protoplast isolation, and polyethylene glycol transfection procedure was performed as described (CITATION). Twenty micrograms of GFP-WIT1 plasmid was used for transfection, and localization of the expressed protein was tested by confocal microscopy after 12 h of incubation. Plasmids expressing HA-WPP1, HA-WPP1WPP/AAP, HA-WPP2, HA-HSC70-1, HA-HSC70-3, and HA-GUS were mobilized into the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation. Transformed agrobacteria were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 30 μg/mL gentamicin. N. benthamiana plants were grown in soil under standard long-day conditions (16 h light and 8 h dark) at 24°C for 3 weeks before agroinfiltration. A. tumefaciens cultures containing different plasmids were either infiltrated or coinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves as described previously (CITATION). The OD of each A. tumefaciens culture was 1.0 (unless indicated differently), and the ratio between each culture was 1:1 when two cultures were used for coinfiltration or 1:1:1 when three cultures were used for coinfiltration. Quantitative data were obtained by scoring two-dimensional fields of view. Ten to fifteen fields of view were scored per agroinfiltrated combination per experiment. Two to three replicates of each experiment were performed (as indicated in the legend of each figure). The gene silencing suppressor p19 (CITATION) was coexpressed to prevent silencing from multiple 35S promoter-containing constructs, as was described previously (CITATION; CITATION). The presence or absence of p19 in each infiltration is specifically indicated in the figure legends. Detailed description of TAP protocol and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis was given elsewhere (CITATION). Arabidopsis Columbia wild type expressing GFP or GFP-WIT1 (kanamycin resistant), GFP, WPP1-GFP, or WPP2-GFP (BASTA resistant), and TAP-WPP1 or TAP-WPP2 (BASTA resistant) were grown at 22°C in constant light for 14 d. N. benthamiana plants were grown for 3 d after agroinfiltration was performed. Whole Arabidopsis seedlings or infiltrated leaves of N. benthamiana were collected and ground into fine powders. Extracts for coimmunoprecipitation were prepared at 4°C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoprecipitates from both Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana were prepared either with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (A11120; Molecular Probes), polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam), anti-WIT1 antibody (CITATION) bound to protein A-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), or monoclonal anti-HA-agarose antibody produced in mouse (Sigma-Aldrich) with 1 to 2 h binding. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, and probed with anti-WIT1 (1:2,000), mouse anti-Hsc70 (Hsp73) monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Stressgen), monoclonal anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), or anti-FLAG M2-HRP (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich) antibody. Two types of anti-GFP antibodies were used for detection of immunoprecipitates: polyclonal (A11122, 1:4,000; Molecular Probes) and monoclonal (MO48-3, 1:1,000; MBL). A dilution of 1:25,000 was used for the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE healthcare). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a dilution of 1:10,000. The loading ratio input:immunoprecipitation was 1:10 in each experiment, unless noted in the figure legend. For the Hsc70-1-WPP1-WIT1 ternary complex detection, extracts in immunoprecipitation buffer were first bound to anti-HA-agarose antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). After 1 h, bound proteins were eluted in five column volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 100 μg/mL HA peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. Four-fifths of the eluate was bound to monoclonal anti-GFP antibody-protein A-sepharose beads, and after second immunoprecipitation, immune complexes were detected with anti-HA-HRP (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich), anti GFP (A11122, 1:4,000; Molecular Probes), or anti-FLAG M2-HRP (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody. Each immunoprecipitation was repeated at least twice. N. benthamiana was grown for 3 d after agroinfiltration. A small section was dissected from the infiltrated area and placed on a slide with coverslip for microscopy. The same section was used for immunoblotting to quantify the amount of proteins. GFP fluorescence images were collected on a PCM 2000/Nikon Eclipse E600 confocal laser scanning microscope as described (CITATION).
