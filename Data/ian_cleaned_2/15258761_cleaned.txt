!~ABS~! During plant cytokinesis, kinesin-related motor proteins are believed to play critical roles in microtubule organization and vesicle transport in the phragmoplast. Previously, we reported that the motor AtPAKRP1 was associated with the plus end of phragmoplast microtubules in Arabidopsis thaliana [Lee Y-RJ, Liu B (2000) Curr Biol 10:797–800]. In this paper, we report a full-length cDNA from the same organism, which encodes a polypeptide 74% identical to AtPAKRP1. This AtPAKRP1-like protein—AtPAKRP1L—and AtPAKRP1 share similar domain structures along the polypeptides. Peptide antibodies were raised and purified to distinguish the two polypeptides in vitro and in vivo. When monospecific anti-AtPAKRP1 and anti-AtPAKRP1L antibodies were used in immunofluorescence, they both decorated the plus end of phragmoplast microtubules at all stages of phragmoplast development. Their localization patterns were indistinguishable from each other. By using bacterially expressed fusion proteins of motor-less versions of both polypeptides, it was revealed that AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L were able to interact with themselves and with each other. Using T-DNA insertional mutants, it was also demonstrated that AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L were not required for each other’s localization. Our results therefore indicate that AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L are both expressed in the same cells, and likely have identical functions in the phragmoplast by forming either homodimers or heterodimers.
!~RES~! After the AtPAKRP1 cDNA was isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA library (Lee and Liu CITATION), a clone containing homologous sequence was later recovered. It matched the genomic sequence of the At3g23670 gene. An EST clone (GenBank accession number AV545884) covering the complete coding sequence (GenBank accession number AF540489) was found. While this work was in progress, a cDNA sequence was released (GenBank accession number AY124006), whose coding sequence matched perfectly with that reported here. Because of the high degree of similarity between the encoded polypeptide and AtPAKRP1, we named it AtPAKRP1L, for A. thaliana phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related protein 1-like protein. The AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L genes have very similar intron/exon structures (Fig. 1). While AtPAKRP1 is a polypeptide of 1,292 amino acids with an isoelectric point of 5.78, AtPAKRP1L has 1,313 amino acids and an isoelectric point of 5.22. Their overall amino acid sequences share 74% identity (Fig. 2). Similar domain structures were also found between these two polypeptides (Fig. 3). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  Because of the high degree of sequence identity between AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L, the anti-AtPAKRP1-C antibodies raised against the C-terminal region of AtPAKRP1 would probably cross-react with both proteins (Lee and Liu CITATION). GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292) and GST-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) fusion proteins were used for testing antibody specificity (Fig. 3). Indeed, when bacterial lysates expressing the two fusion proteins were probed with anti-AtPAKRP1-C, both fusion proteins were detected (Fig. 4; lanes 1, 2). In order to generate antibodies specific for each of these two polypeptides, two unique peptides (PA1 and PA1L) were selected as antigens (Fig. 1). GST-PA1 and GST-PA1L fusions (see Materials and methods) were used to purify antibodies from sera. To test whether PA1 and PA1L generated monospecific antibodies, affinity purified antibodies were used to probe GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292) and GST-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) fusion proteins. The anti-PA1 antibodies recognized only GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292), and the anti-PA1L antibodies recognized only GST-AtPAKRP1L(548–1,313) (Fig. 4; lanes 3–6). Therefore polypeptide-specific antibodies have been obtained. Unfortunately, the anti-PA1 and PA1L antibodies were not able to detect native AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L proteins from seedling extracts. This was likely due to the low amount of the proteins because they were detected only in cells bearing the phragmoplast (see below). [[FIGURE]]  The high degree of homology between AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L prompted us to determine whether the two KRPs behave similarly in Arabidopsis cells. The monospecific anti-PA1 and anti-PA1L antibodies were used for immunolocalization experiments. Because anti-AtPAKRP1-C antibodies recognized both polypeptides, the resulting signal at the plus end of phragmoplast microtubules (Lee and Liu CITATION) might have reflected the localization of either the AtPAKRP1 or AtPAKRP1L polypeptide, or both. We first questioned whether AtPAKRP1 indeed localizes to the site reported previously. We found that the AtPAKRP1 localization pattern with anti-PA1 was indistinguishable from that with anti-AtPAKRP1-C. At an early stage of phragmoplast formation, microtubules between two clusters of sister chromatids (Fig. 5c) were already organized in an anti-parallel pattern, as shown by a dark line in anti-tubulin immunofluorescence (Fig. 5b). In this cell, AtPAKRP1 was associated with the phragmoplast in the middle of interdigitating microtubules (Fig. 5a). The localization of AtPAKRP1L by anti-PA1L antibodies was indistinguishable from that of AtPAKRP1 by anti-PA1. In a cell bearing decondensing chromatids (Fig. 5f), an early phragmoplast microtubule array was detected by anti-tubulin (Fig. 5e). AtPAKRP1L was present exclusively in the middle of the phragmoplast, where anti-parallel microtubules interdigitated (Fig. 5d). This localization pattern at the microtubule plus ends persisted throughout the course of cytokinesis. At a late stage of cytokinesis, marked by reforming daughter nuclei (Fig. 5i), new microtubules were polymerized towards the periphery of the phragmoplast (Fig. 5h). AtPAKRP1L was present only in the middle of the phragmoplast microtubules, and no signal was detected in the central region where microtubules had already depolymerized (Fig. 5 g). [[FIGURE]]  In all root and other somatic cells examined at late anaphase-cytokinesis, both AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L were detected at identical sites. Therefore, neither KRP exhibits a cell-type-specific expression pattern. We can also conclude that the sequence divergence between the two polypeptides does not affect their intracellular localizations. Dimerization of conventional kinesin heavy chain and most KRPs is a common phenomenon. Because both AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L have predicted coiled-coils at similar locations outside their motor domains, they may undergo dimerization in vivo. We then asked whether AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L were capable of dimerization in vitro. GST- and 6×His-tagged fusion proteins (Fig. 3) were expressed in E. coli and purified for the interaction test. The 6×His fusion proteins did not sediment with immobilized glutathione in the absence of GST fusion proteins (Fig. 6, lanes 1,5). When the bait GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292) was precipitated with glutathione, the prey 6×His-PAKRP1(424–1,292) co-sedimented (Fig. 6; lane 2). A similar co-sedimentation phenomenon was found between GST-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) and 6×His-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) (Fig. 6; lane 7). Because the PAKRP1L constructs lacked the first coiled-coil domain immediately following the motor domain, the interaction did not require this coiled-coil. These results indicated that both AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L were capable of forming homodimers. [[FIGURE]]  An interaction was also detected when 6×His-PAKRP1(424–1,292) was incubated with GST-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) (Fig. 7; lane 3), and the same is true for 6×His-PAKRP1L (548–1,313) and GST-PAKRP1 (424–1,292) (Fig. 7; lane 6). Because these two polypeptides contain coiled-coils (Fig. 3), we wanted to test whether the interaction was caused by non-specific interaction between coiled-coils. We used another KRP, AtPAKRP2, which also contains coiled-coils outside the motor domain, and localizes to the phragmoplast (Lee et al. CITATION). When GST-PAKRP2(392–869) (Fig. 3) was incubated with either 6×His-PAKRP1 (424–1,292) or 6×His-PAKRP1L(548–1,313), no interaction was detected (Fig. 7; lanes 4, 8). Therefore, the self-interaction of the motorless PAKRP1 and PAKRP1L polypeptides, and the interactions between them were specific. Homozygous pakrp1-1 and pakrp1l-1 plants, which had T-DNA insertions at the second and first exon, respectively (Fig. 1), were used for localization experiments. In an anaphase pakrp1-1 cell in which spindle midzone microtubules had not coalesced, AtPAKRP1L did not appear on spindle microtubules (Fig. 7a–c). At a later stage when microtubules were arranged in the phragmoplast configuration (Fig. 7e), AtPAKRP1L appeared exclusively in the middle of phragmoplast microtubules (Fig. 7d). We also tested whether AtPAKRP1 was present in pakrp1-1 cells. In a cell bearing the phragmoplast microtubule array and reforming daughter nuclei (Fig. 7 h, i), no AtPAKRP1 signal was detected in the phragmoplast region (Fig. 7 g). Therefore, pakrp1-1 is most likely a null mutation. [[FIGURE]]  Likewise, in a metaphase pakrp1l-1 cell, AtPAKRP1 was not detected on spindle microtubules (Fig. 8a–c). During cytokinesis in the mutant, AtPAKRP1 was present in the middle of phragmoplast microtubules (Fig. 8d–f). In a cell at a similar stage of cytokinesis, AtPAKRP1L was clearly absent in phragmoplast microtubules (Fig. 8g–i), indicating that pakrp1l-1 is also a null mutation. [[FIGURE]]  Taken together, we conclude that AtPAKRP1 is not required for the localization of AtPAKRP1L to the plus end of phragmoplast microtubules, and AtPAKRP1L is also not required for AtPAKRP1 localization.
!~MM~! A fragment derived from the rice R4872A clone was used as a probe to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library as described previously (Lee and Liu CITATION). The AV545884 clone was made available by the Kazusa DNA Institute (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/en/). DNA sequencing was carried out at a local facility (The Division of Biological Sciences Sequencing Facility, UC-Davis, Davis, Calif.). Peptides PA1 (CDQAVEPSVNASSEQ) and PA1L (CISDTNQGNSPSKAENIP) were chosen for AtPAKRP1 and AtPAKRP1L, respectively. Antibodies against each peptide (conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) were raised in two rabbits at a commercial facility (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, Calif.). Antisera were obtained after immunization. In order to purify peptide-specific antibodies, we first expressed the PA1 and PA1L peptides as GST fusion proteins. The coding sequence of PA1 was designed by using primers 5′-AATTCAGTGCGATCAGGCGGTGGAACCGAGCGTGAACGCGAGCTCTGAAC-3′, and 5′-AGCTGTTCAGAGCTCGCGTTCACGCTCGGTTCCACCGCCTGATCGCACTG-3′. These primers were annealed, with the annealed product having EcoRI and HindIII compatible ends. The product was then ligated into the EcoRI and HindIII sites in plasmid pGEX-KG (Guan and Dixon CITATION), to give rise to the GST-PA1 construct. An identical strategy was used to construct GST-PA1L using primers 5′-AATTCAGTGCATTAGCGATACCAACCAGGGCAACAGCCCGAGCAAAGCGGAAAACATTCCG-3′ and 5′-AGCTCGGAATGTTTTCCGCTTTGCTCGGGCTGTTGCCCTGGTTGGTATCGCTAATGCACTG-3′. GST-PA1 and GST-PA1L were expressed and purified according to methods described previously (Lee et al. CITATION). Purified fusion proteins were immobilized to agarose with the AminoLink Plus kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The antisera were applied to GST-PA1/GST-PA1L columns and specific antibodies were eluted from the columns with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5 or 3.5. Purified antibodies were verified by immunoblotting. Motorless GST fusion proteins were constructed in pGEX-KG. The AtPAKRP1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 424–1,292 was amplified using the following primers: 5′-GCTCGAATTCCAAAGGCAATACAG-3′, and 5′-TTAGCTCGAGATGTTGCACCTATCA-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and cloned into pGEX-KG at the corresponding sites. The AtPAKRP1L cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 548–1,313 was amplified using primers 5′-ACCATGCCATGGCATCATTACAGACTGTG-3′, and 5′-ACTCGAGTGTTGTGGAAACGAAATTCTATGTTGCATCGG-3′. The GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292) and GST-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The bacterial lysates were dissolved in protein sample buffer before being loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. The immunoblotting procedure was adopted from a previous report (Lee et al. CITATION). Primary antibodies were anti-PAKRP1-C, anti-PA1, and anti-PA1L. The secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). Following antibody incubations, the blots were developed by a colorimetric method using NBT/BCIP as substrates according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Amresco, Solon, Ohio). Immunofluorescence experiments were carried out according to our previous work (Lee et al. CITATION). Primary antibodies were the DM1A anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody, and anti-PA1 and anti-PA1L polyclonal antibodies. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and Texas Red-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore.). DNA was stained using 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). Stained cells were observed under a Nikon Eclipse 600 fluorescent microscope using a Plan Fluor 100× objective (Nikon, Melville, N.Y.). The following filter sets were used: DAPI (#31000), Texas Red (#31004), and GFP Bandpass Emission (#41017) (Chroma, Rockingham, Vt.). Images were captured by an Orca-100 cooled digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, N.J.) operated by the Image Pro Plus software package (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md.). Images were assembled by using the Adobe Photoshop software package (Adobe Systems, San Jose, Calif.). GST fusion proteins GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292) and GST-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) were purified as described previously (Lee et al. CITATION). The BamHI-XhoI fragment of the GST-PAKRP1(424–1,292) construct was cloned into plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen, Valenica, Calif.) at the corresponding sites to give rise to the 6×His-PAKRP1(424–1,292) fusion construct. An identical strategy was applied to construct 6×His-PAKRP1L(548–1,313). His-tagged fusion proteins were purified under denaturing conditions according to methods described previously (Lee et al. CITATION). Purified denatured proteins were renatured by dialyzing against 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) with 100 mM NaCl, in the presence of gradually reducing concentrations of urea from 7 M to zero. In order to make the GST-PAKRP2 fusion protein, a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 392–869 was amplified using primers 5′-TGATGCTAGCATCAAGAATAGCTGCCATG-3′, and 5′-TAGCCTCGAGTGTCTTCTGAGAGT-3′. After digestion with NheI and XhoI, the fragment was ligated into the pGEX-KG vector at the XbaI and XhoI sites. In order to remove residual insoluble fusion proteins, the 6×His fusion proteins were centrifuged at 99,456 g for 15 min at 4°C with a TLA45 rotor in a Beckman TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman, City of Hope, Calif.). The supernatants were used for further experiments. Bacteria expressing GST fusion proteins were lysed in PBS buffer containing 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100. After sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 27,216 g for 20 min at 4°C with the JA-20 rotor in a Beckman J2 centrifuge. Aliquots (5 ml) of supernatant were incubated with 0.25 ml immobilized glutathione gel (Pierce). After thorough washing, the gel was divided into two equal parts. One part was incubated with 6×His-PAKRP1(424–1,292), and the other with 6×His-PAKRP1L(548–1,313) on a rocker at 4°C overnight. The glutathione gel was then collected by centrifugation at 77 g at 4°C. Samples eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione were dissolved in the sample buffer, and loaded on SDS-PAGE gels for further immunoblotting experiments with either an anti-6×His antibody (Covance, Berkeley, Calif.), or anti-GST antibodies raised at a local facility (Comparative Pathology Laboratory, Davis, Calif.). T-DNA insertional mutant plants were identified according to a PCR-based method as described previously (Krysan et al. CITATION; McElver et al. CITATION). The pakrp1-1 line was isolated from the mutant pool at the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The mutation was detected by PCR with the gene specific primer YT5 (5′-CTCCACGCAAATTAAGATCCGCCAAAGAA-3′) and the T-DNA border-specific primer JL202 (5′-CATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3′). The gene specific primers YT5 and 5377R (5′-GTCAAAACCACGAATTGAACAAAACCAG-3′) were used for the homozygosity test. The pakrp1l-1 mutant line was created by the Syngenta Terrey Mesa Research Institute (La Jolla, Calif.). The T-DNA insertion was detected by the gene specific primer G362G02 (5′-CTTGCGTGATATCGGAGAGTCACAATCGCCAAAC-3′) and the T-DNA border-specific primer GBL3 (5′-TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCGATACA-3′). The gene specific primers G363G02 and 362R (5′-CACCTCACTGAGACGGGCGAAGAGCAA-3′) were used for the homozygosity test.
