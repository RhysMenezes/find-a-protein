!~RES~! Arabidopsis MAP65‐3 (AT5G51600) was used as bait, to screen split‐ubiquitin Y2H Arabidopsis cDNA libraries generated from mRNAs isolated from dissected galls or inflorescences obtained 7 d post M. incognita infection (7 dpi). We identified an interaction between the SAC subunit BUB3.1 and MAP65‐3. We checked the specificity of this interaction, by investigating interactions between BUB3.1 and other members of the MAP65 family by Y2H screening (Fig. 1). We detected no interactions between BUB3.1 and MAP65‐1, MAP65‐4, MAP65‐5 or MAP65‐8, confirming the specificity of the interaction between BUB3.1 and MAP65‐3.  [[FIGURE]] We then investigated the possible interaction of MAP65.3 with other SAC subunits. We studied the previously identified MAD2 and BUBR1/MAD3.1 proteins (Caillaud et al., CITATION) and two additional new BUB1/BUBR1/MAD3‐related proteins by Y2H screening. The Arabidopsis MAD3.2 and BRK1 proteins each contain a BUB1‐MAD3 N‐terminal conserved domain organised into a tetratricopeptide motif repeat (TPR) (Bolanos‐Garcia et al., CITATION). BRK1 contains a C‐terminal protein kinase domain, which is absent from MAD3.2, as in BUBR1/MAD3.1 (Fig. 2a, Supporting Information Fig. S1). BRK1 displays 49% and 61% identity over its entire length with the recently characterized BRK1 from monocots (Oryza sativa) and dicots (Vitis vinifera), respectively (Karpov et al., CITATION; Wang et al., CITATION) (Fig. S2a). The spatial folding of plant BRK1 and human BUB1 kinase domains display a high degree of similarity (Fig. S2b). We found that MAP65‐3 interacted with BUB3.1, MAD2, BUBR1/MAD3.1, MAD3.2 and BRK1 in yeast. In addition to the previously described interaction between BUB3.1, BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD2 (Caillaud et al., CITATION), we confirmed that all SAC subunits interacted with each other in Y2H screening, indicating that they form a complex (Fig. 2b). Except for the interaction between BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD2, which was not detected when BUBR1/MAD3.1 was used as bait, all these interactions were confirmed in a reciprocal bait–prey experiment.  [[FIGURE]] We investigated whether and where the interactions between SAC subunits occurred in planta, by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis. Following transient expression in N. benthamiana leaf epidermis, MAP65‐3 fused to GFP was found associated with large bundles of cortical MT arrays (Fig. 2c). BRK1 and MAD3.2 with GFP fused to the N‐ or C‐terminus were detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. S3), as previously described for MAD2 and BUB3.1, whereas BUBR1/MAD3.1 was specifically targeted to the nucleus (Caillaud et al., CITATION). We showed, by BiFC, that the co‐expression of constructs encoding MAP65‐3:YC (MAP65‐3 fused to the C‐terminal half of YFP) and BUB3.1:YN (BUB3 fused to the N‐terminal half of YFP) resulted in the targeting of the reconstituted YFP complexes to MT arrays (n = 20; Fig. 2d). Similar results were obtained with all the SAC components tested, except for BRK1, for which no YFP fluorescence was detected (Fig. S3). We previously reported that BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD2 interact specifically at chromocentres in the interphasic nuclei (Caillaud et al., CITATION). In contrast to the homogeneous distribution of BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD3.2 within nucleoplasm, the interactions between MAD3.1:YN and MAD3.2:YC were observed exclusively as bright subnuclear foci (Fig. 2d). Using the centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) variant from Arabidopsis GFP:HTR12 as an in vivo marker for centromeres (Talbert et al., CITATION; Lermontova et al., CITATION), we confirmed that BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD3.2 interacted specifically at interphase centromeres, corresponding to the chromosomal position at which kinetochore proteins associate (Fig. 2d). By contrast, MAD3.2 interacted with MAD2 or BUB3.1 in the nuclei and cytoplasm of epidermal cells (Fig. S3).  In our previous studies, we showed that the MAP65‐3, and BUBR1/MAD3.1 promoters drove expression in tissues enriched in dividing cells (Caillaud et al., CITATION). We investigated during plant development the pattern of expression of the newly identified SAC complex genes, MAD3.1 and BRK1, in A. thaliana transgenic lines (n = 5) transformed with the corresponding promoter‐GUS reporter gene constructs. ProMAD3.2:GUS directed expression early in organ development, in tissues with a high proportion of dividing cells, such as young leaves (Fig. 3a), root meristems (Fig. 3b) and lateral root primordia (Fig. 3c). ProMAD3.2:GUS expression was also observed in the carpels of floral buds and flowers (Fig. 3d,e) and in the leaf vascular bundles (Fig. 3f). In ProBRK1:GUS lines, GUS expression was observed in young leaves but not in root meristems (Fig. 3h–j). In flowers, BRK1 expression was detected in the papillae and pollen (Fig. 3k,l,n). This pattern of expression suggests a role for this gene in the development of aerial organs. Thus, BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD3.2 are co‐expressed with MAP65‐3 in all dividing plant cells, whereas BRK1 gene function may be restricted to the shoot.  [[FIGURE]] We then investigated whether SAC components were induced in response to nematode attack, as reported for MAP65‐3 (Caillaud et al., CITATION). Studies of the root‐knot nematode infection of promoter‐GUS transgenic lines showed that the BUB3.1, BUBR1/MAD3.1, MAD3.2 and MAD2 genes were expressed in galls at early stages of giant cell formation, corresponding to nuclear division, < 48 h after giant cell initiation, 3 dpi (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, although no BRK1 expression was observed in dividing root cells, weak GUS expression was observed in galls 10 dpi in ProBRK1:GUS lines, suggesting that BRK1 expression may be transiently activated in response to nematode attack. For up to 3 wk, during the period of giant cell formation, a similar pattern of expression was observed for all SAC subunits (3–21 dpi). The upregulation of expression for these genes was confirmed by RT‐qPCR analysis (Fig. S4). Sections through galls showed GUS staining in developing giant cells and in the surrounding dividing cells (Fig. 4). No GUS activity was detected in the cortical cells of the gall. Overall, these results show that SAC genes are co‐expressed with MAP65‐3 in dividing cells and in the giant cells induced by the nematodes.  [[FIGURE]] We investigated the spatial distribution of SAC proteins in Arabidopsis, upon stable expression of GFP fusions of SAC subunits genes. When expressed under their native promoters, GFP fusions were hardly detectable in Arabidopsis. We therefore used the MAP65‐3 promoter to drive mitosis‐specific GFP fusions expression (Caillaud et al., CITATION). As expected, during normal mitosis (i.e. without the addition of mitotic drugs), MAD3.1:GFP and MAD3.2:GFP were not localised at the kinetochores (Fig. 5). By contrast, BRK1:GFP was detectable at kinetochores throughout mitosis (Fig. 5). To confirm this localisation, we first used crosses between ProMAP65‐3:BRK1:YFP and Pro35S:HTR12:GFP. Imaging of Arabidopsis roots simultaneously expressing both the centromeric histone 3 variant fused to GFP (HTR12:GFP) and BRK1:YFP showed the colocalisation of BRK1 and HTR12 in spots in interphase nuclei as well as during mitosis (Fig. 6a). Moreover, we performed whole‐mount immunolocalisation using anti‐HTR12 specific antibodies (Talbert et al., CITATION) in BRK1:GFP plants (Fig. 6b). These experiments demonstrated the BRK1 localisation at interphase centromeres and on kinetochores during mitosis (Fig. 6b). Careful observation of the subcellular distribution of the SAC subunits during cell cycle progression revealed that there was a signal for MAD3.1:GFP, but not for MAD3.2:GFP, at the mitotic spindle (Fig. 5). Interestingly the fluorescence could not be detected in all the surrounding cells, indicating that these proteins were regulated by both transcriptional and post‐transcriptional mechanisms, as described for MAP65‐3 (Caillaud et al., CITATION). We have shown that BUBR1/MAD3.1 localises to kinetochore MTs following MT‐destabilising drug treatment (Caillaud et al., CITATION). Indeed, BiFC revealed that MAD3.1:YN localised to the MT network when coexpressed with MAP65‐3:YC (Fig. S3), suggesting a particular role for BUBR1/MAD3.1 at the interface between the kinetochore and spindle MTs.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We then investigated the loss‐of‐function phenotypes of SAC subunits in Arabidopsis. In higher eukaryotes, homozygous null mutants of essential SAC components present early embryonic lethality (Basu et al., CITATION; Kitagawa & Rose, CITATION; Dobles et al., CITATION; Kalitsis et al., CITATION). In plants, Arabidopsis bub3.1 is lethal whereas rice brk1 mutants are sterile (Lermontova et al., CITATION; Wang et al., CITATION). We identified T‐DNA insertion mutations at the BUBR1/MAD3.1, MAD3.2 and BRK1 loci (Fig. 7a). In brk1 mutant, the T‐DNA integration took place into the twelfth intron and generated a premature stop codon. RT‐PCR experiments confirmed that no full‐length transcript was produced in the corresponding mutants (Fig. 7b). A truncated brk1 transcript (exon1 to 12) was detected in brk1 mutant and led to a deletion of 103 amino acids. This BRK1 truncated protein lacked the C‐terminal part of the kinase domain. The mad3.1, mad3.2 and brk1 mutants were morphologically similar to wild‐type plants under normal growth conditions and developed normal roots, leaves, shoot and flowers (Fig. S5). In parallel, we generated double mad3.1 brk1, mad3.1 mad3.2, mad3.2 brk1 and triple mad3.1 mad3.2 brk1 mutants to determine whether the lack of a developmental phenotype was due to redundancy.  [[FIGURE]] We first investigated whether knock‐outs of genes from the BUB1‐BUBR1/MAD3 family impaired the progression of mitosis following treatment with MT‐destabilising drugs. The addition of oryzalin to the growth medium inhibited the root growth of the two single mutants (mad3.1 and mad3.2) and of the double mad3.1 brk1, mad3.1 mad3.2, mad3.2 brk1 and the triple mutants (Fig. 7c), but not that of brk1. The phenotype of the double and triple mutants was statistically indistinguishable from either mad3.1 or mad3.2 parent, suggesting that the two genes act at the same pathway. This growth phenotype is consistent with a defect in the arrest of the cell cycle in metaphase to repair the lesions, as initially described for bub mutants in S. cerevisiae (Hoyt et al., CITATION). Thus, BUBR1/MAD3.1 and MAD3.2 are important for mitosis arrest in the occurrence of defects in the root, whereas BRK1 may play a tissue‐specific role in the aerial organs of the plant.  We then investigated the ability of root‐knot nematodes to induce their giant feeding cells in single mutants and in the double and triple (mad3.1 mad3.2 brk1) mutants. Following nematode infection, all mutants had numbers of galls and egg masses similar to those observed in the corresponding wild‐type plants (Fig. S6). Thus, nematodes were able to infect the plants and induce a functional feeding site for their development and reproduction.  For analyses of chromosome segregation in the absence of functional BUBR1/MAD3 and BRK1 proteins, we introgressed the H2B:YFP fluorescent marker into mad3.1, mad3.2 and brk1 single, double or triple mutants. We then carried out in vivo confocal microscopy to analyse chromosome rearrangements in the various mutants during mitosis. We detected misaligned chromosomes on the metaphase plate in the mad3.1 mutant (8% of divisions, number of analysed mitotic figures n = 70, P < 0.05, Fig. 8a), resulting in the presence of lagging chromosomes in anaphase (Fig. 8b). No obvious mitosis defect was observed in mad3.2 and brk1 single and double mutants in the root meristem cells (Fig. 8c–h). Interestingly, the mad3.1 mad3.2 double mutant had a stronger phenotype, with lagging chromosomes in anaphase (21% of divisions, number of analysed mitotic figures n = 58, Fig. 8i–k,m–p), which may result in the formation of micronuclei in late telophase (Fig. 8l,l′). As observed for the mad3.1 mad3.2 mutant, the mad3.1 mad3.2 brk1 triple mutant displayed slow chromosome congression and an unstable metaphase plate (Fig. 8q–r). This considerably delayed anaphase and chromosome segregation, leading in some cases to chromosome lagging and unequal separation of chromosomes during mitosis (Fig. 8q–r). Interestingly, chromosome mis‐segregations were also observed in the shoot apical meristem dividing cells of brk1 mutant (16% of divisions, number of analysed mitotic figures n = 50, P < 0.05, Fig. 8s,t). Thus, BUBR1/MAD3.1, MAD3.2 and BRK1 are important for correct chromosomes alignment during the transition between metaphase and anaphase. Finally, to visualise the dynamics of the MT network during the cell division in the mad3.1 mad3.2 mutants, we introgressed the MT fluorescent marker MBD:GFP into mutants already expressing H2B:YFP. In vivo cell imaging of dividing cells in the root meristem revealed major cytoskeletal abnormalities. After nuclear envelope breakdown, defects in spindle polarity and spindle MT organisation occurred in mad3.1 mad3.2 mutants (Fig. 8i–k,m–o). Time‐lapse analysis revealed the presence of tilted phragmoplasts in mad3.1 mad3.2 (Fig. S7); such asymmetrical growth of the phragmoplast often led to the formation of micronuclei (Fig. 8l,l′). Thus, BUBR1/MAD3.1, MAD3.2 and BRK1 play a key role in ensuring the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis WT ecotypes and T‐DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (GABI_084G06 in Columbia Col0 background ecotype) and the INRA Institute in Versailles, France (DQH17 and EII34 in the Wassilewskija WS background ecotype). The ProMAD3.1, ProMAD2 and ProBUB3.1:GFP:GUS lines were generated as part of a previous study (Caillaud et al., CITATION). For in vitro analyses, seeds were surface‐sterilised and grown on MS medium containing 1% sucrose, 0.7% plant cell culture‐tested agar (Sigma), and 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. Kanamycin resistance was scored in 2‐wk‐old seedlings. For nematode infection in vitro, 100 surface‐sterilised freshly hatched Meloidogyne incognita second‐stage juveniles (J2) were added to each 2‐wk‐old seedling. The plates were kept at 20°C, with a 16‐h photoperiod. All of the observations reported were obtained in three independent experiments. Tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants were grown under continuous light for 1 month at 26°C. Tobacco leaves were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as previously described (Caillaud et al., CITATION), and plants were analysed 2 d after infiltration. For drug treatment, we used oryzalin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 150 nM. Homozygous plants were crossed with Pro35S:MBD:GFP, Pro35S:HTR12:GFP or Pro35S:H2B:YFP Arabidopsis plants. Plants expressing the two constructs were obtained and used for microscopy analysis.  Arabidopsis thaliana proteins orthologous to human BUB1 were identified by BLASTP analysis. Interpro scans (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro) were used to study domain organisation. The A. thaliana MAD3.2 and BRK1 coding sequences were amplified by PCR, with specific primers (Supporting Information Table S1). They were inserted into the pDON207 donor vector and then into the pK7FWG2, PK7GWF2 plant expression and BiFC vectors (pAM‐35SS‐GWY‐YFPc and pAM‐35SS‐GWY‐YFPn), with Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). For the promoter‐GUS fusion, 1‐kb fragments immediately upstream from the start codon were amplified by PCR, inserted into the pDON207 donor vector and then into the pKGWFS7 plant vector. For the expression of GFP fusions under the control of the MAP65‐3 promoter, the Pro35S HindIII/SpeI fragment of the pK7WGF2 and pK7FWG2 vectors (Karimi et al., CITATION) was replaced with ProMAP65‐3, as previously described (Caillaud et al., CITATION). For RT‐qPCR, total RNA was extracted from nonmeristematic root and gall tissues from A. thaliana cv WS dissected at various time points after nematode inoculation (7, 14, 21 d post infection, dpi). RT‐qPCR analyses were performed as previously described (Jammes et al., CITATION), in the Opticon 2 system (MJ research; Bio‐Rad). At5g10790 (UBP22) and At5g62050 (OXA1) were used to normalise RT‐qPCR data (Table S1). Three independent quantitative RT‐PCRs were carried out per sample and three biological replicates were performed.  Wild‐type (WS ecotype) A. thaliana plants were stably transformed and GUS activity was assayed histochemically, as previously described (Caillaud et al., CITATION), on at least five independent transformed plants for each construct. Galls, root apices and shoot apical meristems were dissected from GUS‐stained plants, fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, dehydrated, and embedded in Technovit 7100 (Heraeus Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany), as described by the manufacturer. Sections (4 μm thick) were stained with 0.05% ruthenium red and mounted in DPX (BDH Laboratory Supplies, VWR International, Fontenay‐sous‐Bois, France). Samples were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Jena, Germany) and images were analysed with AxioVision 4.7 (Zeiss). Optical sections of tobacco leaf epidermal cells or tobacco cell cultures were observed with a ×63 water immersion apochromatic objective (numerical aperture 1.2; Zeiss) fitted to an inverted confocal microscope (model LSM510; Zeiss) at 25°C. The FM4‐64 fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY, USA) was used at a final concentration of 1 μM. The fluorescence of GFP, YFP and FM4‐64 was monitored in channel mode with a BP 505‐530, 488 beam splitters and LP 530 filters for GFP. For mutants, plantlets were fixed according to the protocole described by Janski et al. (CITATION) and stained using 0.1 mg ml−1 4,6′‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence of H2B‐YFP and MBD‐GFP was visualized on living seedlings mounted in propidium iodide (IP). Seedlings were observed with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope in multitracking mode which is able to specifically discriminate each fluorochrome signature (Carl ZeissAG, Le Pecq, France). GFP, YFP fusion proteins and IP fluorescences were collected with laser excitations of 488, 514, 561 nm and emission ranges of 493–516, 517–561 and 564–697 nm, respectively. The immunolocalisations were performed using rabbit polyclonal CENH3/HTR12 antibodies (1 : 500) (Talbert et al., CITATION) and secondary Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti‐rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) as previously described (Caillaud et al., CITATION). For drug treatment, digital images were acquired with an AxioCam HRc camera (Zeiss) and analysed with LSM Image Browser (Zeiss).  The split‐ubiquitin assay was carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JD53, as previously described (Caillaud et al., CITATION). The BUB3.1, MAD2, BUBR1/MAD3.1, MAD3.2 and BRK1 coding sequences were inserted into the GW:Cub:URA3 bait vector (pMKZ) and the NuI:GW prey vector, using the Gateway system. Standard procedures were used for yeast growth and transformation. Transformants were selected on 5‐fluoroorotic acid (5‐FOA) plates containing minimal medium with yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and glucose, supplemented with lysine, leucine, uracil (M‐HT) and 1 mg ml−1 5‐fluoroorotic acid (5‐FOA).  Kinase domain 3‐D models were built in Modeller 9.12 using template Protein Data Bank structures: 3E7E, 3HMN and 4IJP. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and structure verification protocols were identical to those described earlier (Karpov et al., CITATION). MD computations were performed on IFBG Cluster (http://grid.ifbg.org.ua) of the VO CSLabGrid (http://infrastructure.kiev.ua/en/monitoring/47/). Molecular visualization and structural analysis was performed in PyMol 1.5 (www.pymol.org).  Arabidopsis MAP65‐3 (AT5G51600), MAD2 (AT3G25980), BUB3.1 (AT3G19590), BUBR1/MAD3.1 (AT2G33560), MAD3.2 (AT5G05510), BRK1 (AT1G20635; Uniprot F4IVI0), HTR12/CENH3 (AT1G01370), rice BRK1 (OS07G32480, EEC82122) and grape BRK1 (CBI21878).
