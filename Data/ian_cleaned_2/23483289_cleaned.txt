!~ABS~! Auxin regulates a variety of physiological processes via its downstream factors included Aux/IAAs. In this study, one of these Aux/IAAs, IAA8 is shown to play its role in Arabidopsis development with transgenic plants expressing GFP-mIAA8 under the control of IAA8 promoter, in which IAA8 protein was mutated by changing Pro170 to Leu170 in its conserved domain II. These transgenic dwarfed plants had more lateral branches, short primary inflorescence stems, decreased shoot apical dominance, curled leaves and abnormal flower organs (short petal and stamen, and bent stigmas). Further experiments revealed that IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants functioned as gain-of-function mutation to increase GFP-mIAA8 amount probably by stabilizing IAA8 protein against proteasome-mediated protein degradation with IAA8::GFP-IAA8 plants as control. The searching for its downstream factors indicated its interaction with both ARF6 and ARF8, suggesting that IAA8 may involve in flower organ development. This was further evidenced by analyzing the expression of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic genes and JA levels because ARF6 and ARF8 are required for normal JA production. These results indicated that in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants, JA biosynthetic genes including DAD1 (AT2G44810), AOS (AT5G42650) and ORP3 (AT2G06050) were dramatically down-regulated and JA level in the flowers was reduced to 70 % of that in wild-type. Furthermore, exogenous JA application can partially rescue short petal and stamen observed IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants. Thus, IAA8 plays its role in floral organ development by changes in JA levels probably via its interaction with ARF6/8 proteins.
!~RES~! Previous studies have reported that dominant mutations in several Aux/IAA genes by stabilizing Aux/IAA proteins confer pleiotropic, auxin-related phenotypes (Liscum and Reed CITATION; Oono et al. CITATION; Ouellet et al. CITATION; Tatematsu et al. CITATION). Here, our researches have been focused on the role of IAA8. Thus, the construct pIAA8::GFP-mIAA8 (Fig. S1a) was made to express possible stable IAA8 protein by changing Pro170 to Leu170 in its conserved domain II. The pIAA8::GFP-IAA8 was also obtained as a control (Fig. S1a). Both of these two constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis plants and the resulted transgenic plants were identified for the expression of either GFP-mIAA8 or GFP-IAA8 (Fig. S1a). All obtained IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 homozygotes identified to express GFP-mIAA8 showed the same changed phenotypes. These abnormal phenotypes of dwarfed transgenic lines included more lateral branches (Fig. 1a), short primary inflorescence stems (Fig. 1a, f), curled leaves (Fig. 1b), decreased shoot apical dominance and small siliques (Fig. 1c). Our statistical data also indicated that 39.0 % stigmas of flowers (184/472) were bent, resulting in the bent siliques and 33.7 % siliques (115/341) were devoid of valve tissue in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants (Fig. 1d). It is noteworthy that IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 showed abnormal flowers with short petal and stamen, and bent stigmas (Fig. 1d, e, g). [[FIGURE]]  These abnormal phenotypes in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants were due to the mutation of Pro170 to Leu170 of expressed GFP-mIAA8 protein in the transgenic lines because IAA8::GFP-IAA8 had normal phenotype as compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 1a). It has been documented that domain II of Aux/IAAs is essential for the degradation (Gray et al. CITATION; Ramos et al. CITATION; Tatematsu et al. CITATION). To verify whether the mutated GFP-IAA8 (GFP-mIAA8) was more stable or not in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants, both RT-PCR analysis and imaging under fluorescence microscope were employed in subsequent assays. The results demonstrated that mRNA levels for IAA8 were similar in the transgenic lines (both IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 and IAA8::GFP-IAA8) and wild-type plants with RT-PCR analyses (Fig. S1c, d). Then the protein levels of GFP-mIAA8 and GFP-IAA8 were detected with differential interference contrast (DIC) fluorescence microscope. IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 had much higher GFP fluorescence intensity than that of IAA8::GFP-IAA8 (Fig. 2a, b), indicating that GFP-mIAA8 protein can be accumulated to higher level in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 as compared with that in IAA8::GFP-IAA8 plants. This observation was further verified by Western blot using an antibody against GFP in which while IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 had much more GFP-mIAA8 protein, GFP-IAA8 in IAA8::GFP-IAA8 remained at low level (Fig. 2c). [[FIGURE]]  Proteasome-mediated protein degradation has been shown to play a role in protein level (Llorente et al. CITATION; Thakur et al. CITATION). Thus proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to test the possible role of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in IAA8 accumulation. When the seedlings of both IAA8::GFP-IAA8 and IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 were treated with 50 μM MG132, the GFP fluorescence intensity for GFP-IAA8 level was drastically increased in IAA8::GFP-IAA8 compared with that in untreated IAA8::GFP-IAA8 (Fig. 2d, e). However, both MG132 treated and untreated IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants had essential similar fluorescence intensities for GFP-mIAA8 level (Fig. 2d, e). Furthermore, the comparison of GFP fluorescence intensities of MG132-treated IAA8::GFP-IAA8 and IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 indicated that proteasome inhibition can result in higher level GFP-IAA8 in IAA8::GFP-IAA8 plants, similar to GFP-mIAA8 content in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants (Fig. 2d, e). These results with GFP fluorescence intensities as indicator for the changes of GFP-mIAA8 and GFP-IAA8 proteins in MG132-treated plants were further demonstrated by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2f). Thus, the experimental observations revealed that IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 functioned as gain-of-function mutation to increase GFP-mIAA8 amount probably by stabilizing IAA8 protein against proteasome-mediated protein degradation, leading to a series of dramatic phenotype changes during plant development. Aux/IAA repressors regulate auxin responses by interacting with ARFs. IAA8 may also interact with some ARFs for its role during plant development. Thus, yeast two-hybrid interaction assay was carried out with IAA8 to test whether any of ARFs could be its potential target. The results revealed that IAA8 was capable of interacting with ten ARF proteins: ARF4, ARF5, ARF6, ARF7, ARF8, ARF14, ARF15, ARF19, ARF20 and ARF22 of 23 ARFs based on yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3). Amount them, both ARF6 and ARF8 are reported to be expressed in flower organs (Nagpal et al. CITATION; Schmid et al. CITATION; Wu et al. CITATION). Since the data above showed abnormal flowers of IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants, the expression profiles of IAA8 were further analyzed. The RT-PCR analyses indicated that IAA8 expressed at much higher level in flowers compared with those in roots, stems, leaves and siliques (Fig. 4a). To examine where IAA8 may be expressed in flower organs in detail, 2,023 bps of IAA8 promoter sequence were constructed in the plasmid to drive GUS expression and the transgenic plants (IAA8::GUS) with this plasmid were examined by X-gluc staining for IAA8 expression pattern. The strong expressions of IAA8 in sepal, petal, stamen and pistil style were assayed (Fig. 4), similar to the expression of both ARF6 and ARF8 in flower organs. In addition, arf6-2 arf8-3 seedlings also have twisted leaves, short inflorescence stems, stamens and petals (Nagpal et al. CITATION; Tabata et al. CITATION; Wu et al. CITATION). The similarity in both phenotype and expression pattern of flower organs between IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 and arf6-2 arf8-3 mutant implies possible relation between IAA8 and ARF6/8. Thus, further verification of the interaction of IAA8 with ARF6/8 was carried out with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technique in onion epidermal cells. Indeed, YFP fluorescence and DAPI staining indicated that the interaction between IAA8 and ARF6/8 occurred in nuclei (Fig. 5), suggesting that IAA8 may play its role in flower organ development via its interaction with ARF6/8. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]   ARF6/ARF8 are reported to be required for normal JA production via the modulation of JA biosynthetic genes (Nagpal et al. CITATION; Tabata et al. CITATION). Thus, the expression of several JA biosynthetic genes were analyzed in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants. For this purpose, total RNAs isolated from the flowers were used for qRT-PCR assays. The levels of DAD1 (AT2G44810), AOS (AT5G42650) and OPR3 (AT2G06050) transcripts were dramatically decreased in this gain-of-function mutant, IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 as compared with those in wild-type plants, while the expression level of AOC4 (AT1G13280) was not changed (Fig. 6a–d), suggesting that JA content may be affected in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8. Then JA was measured by HPLC–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS/MS) analyses (Pan et al. CITATION). Indeed, JA level in the flowers was reduced to 29.5 ng g−1 fresh weight in this gain-of function mutant as compared with 41.9 ng g−1 fresh weight in wild-type flowers (Fig. 7a). To further estimate the possible role of reduced JA content in flower development of IAA8::GFP-mIAA8, exogenous JA was applied to the mutation flower buds of IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants and partial rescue of short petal and stamen was observed (Fig. 7b, c). These results indicate the involvement of JA in IAA8-mediated floral organ development. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  To explore possible manipulation of endogenous JA level for the restoration of changed phenotype of flower organs in IAA8::GFP-mIAA8, 35S::DAD1 IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 plants over-expressing DAD1 were obtained. However the plants still had short petal and stamen in their flowers with JA level of 33.7 ng g−1 fresh weight, much lower than that of wild-type plants (Fig. 7a).
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 5 % NaClO containing 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 5 min twice, and washed with four changes of sterile water before sowing on plates with solid medium derived from MS basal medium (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) contained 1 % sucrose and 0.8 % agar. Plates were kept in the dark at 4 °C for 4 days before germination in LD light conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at a light intensity of 120 μmol m−2 s−1. Two constructions: pIAA8::GFP-IAA8 and pIAA8::GFP-mIAA8 were generated by overlapping PCR with primer I-VI [Primers I: 5′-ACGCGT ATATATAGATATCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG-3′ for GFP cDNA N-terminus (MluI and EcoRV sites underlined), II: 5′-CTCGAGCTTGTAC AGCTCGT-3′ for GFP cDNA C-terminus without stop codon, III: 5′-CGAGC TGTACAAGCTCGAGATGTCTTATCGATTGCTAAGTGTGGAT-3′ with 19 bases for GFP cDNA C-terminus and 27 bases with IAA8 cDNA N-terminus, IV: 5′-AACAAATCAAGATTTTGCGTAGAGACGA-3′ for IAA8 cDNA C-terminus, V: 5′-CGACGCGTGTTACCCATTTTGACACCCCTAGT-3′ forward primer for IAA8 protmoter (MluI site underlined), VI: 5′-CGGATATCCAGATCTTCAATATGCAGGACTTG-3′, reverse primer for IAA8 protmoter (EcoRV site underlined). Then PCRs were carried out for product A obtained using forward primer I/reverse primer II with eGFP plasmid as template formed and product B using forward primer III and reverse primer IV with Arabidopsis cDNA as template. Product C amplified by using primerI and IV with product A and B as templates was inserted into the SmaI site of the pBS (TIANGEN BIOTECH, Beijing) as pBS1. Then mutagenic oligonucleotide primers: forward 5′-CAAGGCACAGGTTGTTGG TTGGCTTCCAATCAGATCATACCGGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTTCCGG TATGATCTGATTGGAAGCCAACCAACAACCTGTGCCTG-3′ to change Pro170 to Leu170 of IAA8 domain II was used for PCR to obtain pBSm with pBS1 as template using QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. The products D and E were amplified using primer I and IV with pBS1 and pBSm as templates respectively and inserted into the SmaI site of pCAMBIA1300 (CAMBIA, Canberra, Australia) to generate translational GFP-IAA8 and GFP-mIAA8 fusions as pGFP-IAA8 and pGFP-mIAA8 respectively. Finally, 2,036 bps IAA8 promoter was amplified using forward primer V and reverse primer VI with Arabidopsis genomic DNA as template, digested and inserted into MluI and EcoRV sites of pGFP-IAA8 and pGFP-mIAA8 to generate two constructs: pIAA8::GFP-IAA8 and pIAA8::GFP-mIAA8 respectively. The error-free subcloned PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101)-mediated transformation using the floral dip method. After selection of transformed plants on medium containing 50 mg L−1 hygromycin (Hu et al. CITATION), the transgenic lines of IAA8::GFP-IAA8 and IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 were identified by PCR using primer GFP-F and GFP-R listed in Supporting information Table 1. For MG132 treatment, seedlings were first grown on germination plates to desired stages (5-day-old seedlings), then collected by forceps for the incubation in liquid MS medium containing MG132 (50 μM, dissolved in DMSO) or 0.1 % DMSO for 6 h. After the incubation, the seedlings were thoroughly washed with MS medium three times (5 min each) to remove residual MG132 or DMSO before being observed and tested. The signal intensity was measured by Photoshop CS4, and error bars were obtained based on the measurement of more than twenty seedlings per line. To rescue short petal and stamen, either JA (Sigma, 500 μM solution in 1 % methanol 0.1 % Tween-20) or buffer alone were applied to both IAA8::GFP-mIAA8 and wild-type flower buds respectively and flower morphological changes were observed 2 days later. To make IAA8 promoter::GUS fusion construct, 2,023 bps promoter region of IAA8 was amplified using primers 5′-ACGCGTCGACACACCCCTAGT AACAACAGAATG-3′ (SalI site underlined) and 5′-TCCCCCGGGCAGAT CTTCAATATGCAGGACTTG-3′ (SmaI site underlined) with Arabidopsis genomic DNA as template, confirmed by sequencing and cloned into the binary vector pBI101.2. The construct was then transformed into Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia plants. The transgenic lines were selected on medium containing 50 mg L−1 kanamycin and identified with PCR. GUS staining of seedlings was performed by vacuum-infiltration seedlings with GUS staining solution (50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM X-Gluc, 0.05 % SDS, 0.1 % sodium N-lauryl-sarcosine, 0.1 % Triton X-100). After staining for 3 h at 37 °C, seedlings were cleared with several changes of 70 % ethanol (Hu et al. CITATION). Similar staining patterns were observed for three independently transformed lines. Protein extracts were prepared and analyzed as described (Dharmasiri et al. CITATION) using an extraction buffer (EB) containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 % Triton X-100, 10 % glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride, and 1× complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Total proteins extracted from 5-day-old seedlings were mixed with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed) and then heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The proteins were separated by 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5 % non-fat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1 % Tween-20) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washed three times with TBS-T for 10 min each wash, the membrane was incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at dilution 1:1,000 in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was further washed in TBS-T three times for 10 min each and incubated for 1.5 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000 dilution in TBS-T). Protein detection was conducted using the BeyoECL Plus (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Total RNAs were isolated from frozen tissues of 5-day-old seedlings or adult plants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After treatment of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperscriptIIReverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As an internal control, PDF2 (AT1G13320) was used as the best reference gene for our conditions using geNorm (Czechowski et al. CITATION). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed on a Bio-rad CFX96 apparatus with the dye SYBR green I (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out in 96-well plates heated for 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for 20 s at 95 °C, annealing for 20 s at 58 °C and extension for 30 s at 72 °C. All experiments were performed with three independent biological replicates and three technical repetitions. The genes analyzed and the corresponding specific primers are listed in Supporting information Table 1. For yeast two-hybrid analyses, full-length cDNA of IAA8 (ATG to stop) and partial cDNA for domains III and IV of ARFs was used. For ARFs, following region of the proteins were used: ARF1, 528-stop; ARF2, 719–831; ARF4, 651-stop; ARF5, 781–896; ARF6, 790-stop; ARF7, 1016-stop; ARF8, 793-stop; ARF9, 513–621; ARF10, 559–691; ARF11, 488–607; ARF12, 495–593; ARF14, 498–603; ARF15, 596–598, ARF16, 565-stop; ARF18, 476-stop; ARF19, 942-stop; ARF20, 483-stop; ARF21, 501-stop; ARF22, 495-stop (Supporting information Table 1). The cDNAs were cloned directionally in pGADT7 and pGBKT7 respectively as described (Clontech Laboratories, Matchmaker™ GAL4 Two-Hybrid System & Libraries User Manual) with a pGADT7-based vector for IAA8 and a pGBKT7-based vector for the ARFs. Five pGBKT7-based vectors for ARF3, ARF7, ARF13, ARF17 and ARF23 were provided by Dr. Tom Beeckman (De Rybel et al. CITATION). Then, plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain either AH109 or Y187 by LiAc method. The interactions between proteins were assayed by the mating method as described (Clontech Laboratories, Matchmaker™ GAL4 Two-Hybrid System & Libraries User Manual). While the entire open reading frames of IAA8 were cloned into the binary BiFC vectors pUC-SPYNE containing N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cDNAs for 790–935 AAs of ARF6 and 693–811 AAs of ARF8 were inserted into pUC-SPYCE containing C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fragments (YFPN and YFPC) (Walter et al. CITATION) with the primers shown in Supporting information Table 1. All constructs were verified by sequencing. BiFC analyses were conducted in onion epidermal cells using all possible BiFC vector combinations. Onions were cut into slices and bombarded with 5 μg of above plasmid DNAs precipitated on gold particles using a particle gun (Biolistic PDS 1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System; Bio-Rad). The bombardment conditions were set at 1,100-psi under a vacuum of 28 mm Hg with a 6-cm target distance above the rupture discs. Bombarded onion slices were placed on wet paper in Petri dishes and stored on a bench top for 16–24 h. For fluorescence microscopy, the epidermis was peeled off and transferred to a glass slide, then examined under Olympus FluoView 1000-Confocal laser scanning microscope. Approximately 50 mg of flowers were weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground with a mortar and pestle, and extracted with 4 ml of 70 % (v/v) aqueous methanol. Jasmonic acid was measured by HPLC–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS/MS) analyses as described (Pan et al. CITATION; Nagpal et al. CITATION).
