!~ABS~! Fructose is an abundant sugar in plants as it is a breakdown product of both major sucrose-cleaving enzymes. To enter metabolism, fructose is phosphorylated by a fructokinase (FRK). Known FRKs are members of a diverse family of carbohydrate/purine kinases known as the phosphofructokinase B (pfkB) family. The complete complement of active fructokinases has not been reported for any plant species. Protein sequence analysis of the 22 Arabidopsis thaliana pfkB members identified eight highly related predicted proteins, including one with previously demonstrated FRK activity. For one, At1g50390, the predicted open reading frame is half the size of active FRKs, and only incompletely spliced RNAs were identified, which led to a premature stop codon, both indicating that this gene does not produce active FRK. The remaining seven proteins were expressed in E. coli and phosphorylated fructose specifically in vitro leading us to propose a unifying nomenclature (FRK1–7). Substrate inhibition was observed for fructose in all FRKs except FRK1. Fructose binding was on the same order of magnitude for FRK1–6, between 260 and 480 μM. FRK7 was an outlier with a fructose Km of 12 μM. ATP binding was similar for all FRKs and ranged between 52 and 280 μM. YFP-tagged AtFRKs were cytosolic, except plastidic FRK3. T-DNA alleles with non-detectable wild-type RNAs in five of the seven active FRK genes produced no overt phenotype. We extended our sequence comparisons to include putative FRKs encoded in other plant sequenced genomes. We observed that different subgroups expanded subsequent to speciation. Arabidopsis thaliana as well as all other plant species analyzed contain multiple copies of genes encoding FRK activity. Sequence comparisons among multiple species identified a minimal set of three distinct FRKs present on all species investigated including a plastid-localized form. The selective expansion of specific isozymes results in differences in FRK gene number among species. AtFRKs exhibit substrate inhibition, typical of their mammalian counterparts with the single AtFRK1 lacking this property, suggesting it may have a distinct in vivo role. Results presented here provide a starting point for the engineering of specific FRKs to affect biomass production.
!~RES~! Arsova et al. [CITATION] determined that one member of the pfkB family of proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0, encoded in At1g66430, therein named FRK3, was an active FRK after expression of the recombinant protein in E. coli. To determine whether other pfkB enzymes in Arabidopsis are active FRKs, we first generated a phylogenetic tree based on an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the 22 putative pfkB family members in Arabidopsis to determine whether and which other pfkB proteins clade with FRK3 (Fig. CITATION). Several clades with 1–2 members and one large sub-family were apparent. One clade contained the two characterized adenosine kinases, ADK1 (At3g09820) and ADK2 (At5g03300) [CITATION]. Approximately half of the Arabidopsis pfkB proteins are un-characterized, so the functional significance of these phylogenetic groupings remains uncertain. The one large sub-family contained sequences from nine proteins divided into two branches. One branch within this clade comprised the two fructokinase-like proteins FLN1 (At3g59480) and FLN2 (At1g69200), for which no kinase activity has been detected [CITATION]. The other branch comprised seven proteins including FRK3. An eighth putative pfkB family member was excluded from these analyses because it was found to be a pseudogene (discussed in the following paragraph). Two peptide sequences that were present in the FRK3 inclusive branch, At1g66430 and At4g10260, were both designated FRK3 in different publications [CITATION, CITATION]. We have chosen to denote At1g66430 as FRK3 because of its similarity to the tomato FRK3 (Table CITATION) as previously noted [CITATION]. At4g10260 is designated FRK4 here [CITATION]. FRK1 (At5g51830) and FRK2 (At2g31390) were previously annotated due to their similarity to the tomato isozymes [CITATION]. To visualize specific regions of highest identity we aligned the peptide sequences of the seven putative Arabidopsis FRK proteins (Fig. CITATION). FRK3 was predicted to contain a chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) by the chloroP software [CITATION] and the predicted cTP was removed for the alignment. 47% of the amino acids are identical between all seven members of the putative FRK branch. Both the GG and G/AXGD motifs, underlined in red and green respectively (Fig. CITATION), were conserved in all members, and, notably, the G/AXGD motif was in the form GAGD in all members.Fig. 1Identification of seven putative Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) FRK enzymes. a Consensus bootstrap phylogenetic tree of the 22 pfkB proteins in Arabidopsis.

The GG and G/AXGD motifs are underlined in red and green, respectively Arabidopsis FRK nomenclature Another predicted pfkB protein, At1g50390, claded with the FRK branch, but the predicted protein is only 16 kDa, while other FRKs range from ~34–41 kDa. The 16 kDa protein is missing at least half of the lid domain and alpha helices in the large domain. In addition, there is no evidence that this gene is expressed based on data from TAIR and Genvestigator [CITATION]. According to the TAIR11 gene model, At1g50390 includes three introns (Fig. CITATION), but two independent cDNAs synthesized from total Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 seedling RNA contained sequences identical to the predicted first intron (Fig. CITATION-CITATION). As a result, the cDNA contains an in-frame stop codon encoded in the unspliced first intron. If this mRNA were translated, the protein would be 7.85 kDa and lack a functional lid and the catalytic residues. Based on these data we conclude that At1g50390 does not express a functional protein in Col-0 and, thus, have not included it in our phylogenetic or biochemical analyses.Fig. 2At1g59480 produces an mRNA encoding a non-functional protein. a Schematic of the At1g59480 predicted gene model (top) and experimentally determined cDNA (bottom).

All seven ORFs matched the TAIR11 representative gene models, and contained both signature motifs characteristic of pfkB proteins. To verify whether the seven members of the putative FRK clade exhibit FRK activity, we expressed each protein in E. coli with 6xHis and FLAG epitope tags and purified them using Ni-agarose resin (Fig. CITATION). Since the substrate specificity of known pfkB family proteins varies greatly [CITATION], we measured NADH oxidation as a proxy for FRK activity in the presence of an ATP regeneration system (see Experimental Procedures) in pools of carbohydrate substrates. No change in NADH concentration was seen for any of the proteins in a reaction mixture containing fructose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and N-acetyl-mannosamine suggesting that none of the putative FRKs could phosphorylate any of these carbohydrates (Fig. CITATION). Similarly, the proteins were not active in the presence of ribose, xylose, and arabinose (Fig. CITATION). In contrast, NADH oxidation was observed in the presence of glucose, fructose, fucose, and tagatose (Fig. CITATION), suggesting that one or more of these sugars is a substrate. When these carbohydrates were parsed, fucose, glucose or tagatose alone produced no change in NADH concentration (Fig. CITATION). However, all seven enzymes were active in the presence of fructose (Fig. CITATION), suggesting that each of the seven enzymes possesses FRK activity and that their activity is specific for fructose. The two proteins that comprise the most closely related phylogenetic branch, FLN1 and FLN2, lack detectable fructokinase activity [CITATION], and the only biochemically characterized enzyme in the unresolved polytomy of proteins related to the FRK clade, At1g17160, specifically phosphorylates ribose [CITATION], suggesting that the seven FRKs identified herein likely comprise the Arabidopsis FRK family. As such, we propose the nomenclature in Table CITATION based on previously defined nomenclature [CITATION, CITATION] and degree of similarities among the Arabidopsis proteins, and we will use it in the remainder of this manuscript.Fig. 3Purification of putative Arabidopsis FRK enzymes from E. coli.

Experiments were repeated at least twice with two technical replicas per experiment The same NADH oxidation assay was used to determine the kinetic parameters of each of the FRK enzymes for their substrates fructose and ATP (summarized in Table CITATION). The Km values were similar for FRK1–6 as they were all between 470 ± 77 μM and 230 ± 56 μM (Fig. CITATION-CITATION, Table CITATION), whereas FRK7, the least active enzyme exhibited the strongest binding affinity (Km = 12 ± 8 μM, Fig. CITATION). Substrate inhibition was observed for all FRKs at levels of fructose above 1 mM with the exception of FRK1 and FRK7 (Fig. CITATION). The activity of FRK7 was much lower than the other FRKs and, as such, the activity measurements produced more experimental variation, which may have masked its inhibition by fructose.Table 2Biochemical parameters determined for Arabidopsis FRK isozymesEnzymeKm μM FructoseKm μM ATPFruc substrate inh.Vmax (μM product *min−1 *mg enzyme−1)kcat (s−1)Catalytic efficiency kcat/Km (ATP)FRK1470 +/− 7752 +/− 7.8−2.3E + 0514.22.7E + 05FRK2370 +/− 9185 +/− 8.7+1.8E + 0510.31.2E + 05FRK3480 +/− 9952 +/− 9.8+2.1E + 0514.32.7E + 05FRK4230 +/− 5695 +/− 7.9+1.9E + 0511.11.2E + 05FRK5320 +/− 89180 +/− 57+7.7E + 044.82.7E + 04FRK6260 +/− 81160 +/− 21+2.1E + 0512.88.0E + 04FRK712 +/− 8.4280 +/− 94−2.6E + 041.55.4E + 03 Fig. 5Most Arabidopsis FRKs exhibit substrate inhibition in high concentrations of fructose.

Points represent the mean of three technical replicates and error bars indicate SEM As demonstrated for other plant FRKs [CITATION, CITATION], most of the Arabidopsis FRK enzymes were inhibited by higher concentrations of fructose (Fig. CITATION, Table CITATION). KmATP values were also very similar and inhibition by ATP was not apparent for any of the FRK enzymes (Fig. CITATION-CITATION, Table CITATION). As such we calculated Vmax and kcat values under varied concentrations of ATP under a constant concentration of fructose (Table CITATION). Calculated Km and kcat values were also used to calculate the catalytic efficiency of the FRKs (Table CITATION). Two groups with different amounts of activity were apparent (Fig. CITATION). The group with higher activity included FRK1–4 and FRK6; while the group with lower activity included FRK5 and FRK7 (Fig. CITATION). The group with higher activity had similar kcat values, which varied between 10.3 and 14.3 s−1, whereas the group with lower activity had kcat values of 4.8 s−1 and 1.5 s−1 for FRK5 and FRK7, respectively (Table CITATION).Fig. 6Arabidopsis FRKs exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics in varied ATP.

Curves were fit to Michaelis-Menten equation via non-linear curve fitting in Prism. Kinetic assays were run in triplicate. Points represent the mean of three technical replicates and error bars indicate SEM We then assessed the cofactor requirements of a subset of Arabidopsis FRKs, FRK1–3. Unlike other pfkB proteins, most notably the ribokinases and adenosine kinases [CITATION, CITATION], Arabidopsis FRK1–3 were not significantly sensitive to the absence of inorganic phosphate from the reaction mixture (Fig. CITATION). Because potassium ions activate pfkB family members via creation of an anion hole in their active site [CITATION], we tested whether Arabidopsis FRK1–3 were activated to the same extent upon the substitution of sodium for potassium as the monovalent cation in the reaction mixture. Replacement with sodium resulted in the reduced activity of FRK1–3 by roughly 60% of their respective activities in the presence of potassium (Fig. CITATION). Since magnesium is known to be required for ATP-dependent phosphorylation reactions we next, tested whether or not magnesium is required for FRK activity. Magnesium was omitted from the reaction mixture and EDTA was added to chelate any magnesium that may have co-purified with the enzymes. FRK1–3 activity was completely lost in the reaction mixture containing EDTA (Fig. CITATION). Other FRK enzymes can use other nucleotide triphosphates besides ATP as kinase substrates, albeit with decreased effectiveness [CITATION]. Accordingly, FRK1 activity decreased by 35% activity in the presence of 1 mM GTP (Fig. CITATION), while FRK2–3 activities were approximately halved (Fig. CITATION). Substitution of ATP with 1 mM UTP resulted in the loss of 85% and approximately 75% of FRK1 and FRK2–3 activities, respectively (Fig. CITATION).Fig. 7A subset of Arabidopsis FRKs shares biochemical cofactor requirements.

Experiments were carried out in quadruplicate, all data points are shown To further our understanding of the in vivo role of FRK enzymes in Arabidopsis, we acquired Arabidopsis plants harboring T-DNA-mediated gene disruption mutants for five of the seven FRKs (T-DNA insertional mutants for FRK4 and FRK6 were unavailable). Each mutant line was confirmed homozygous for the T-DNA insertion in the respective gene (data not shown) and none of the T-DNA insertional mutants made authentic transcripts for their respective disrupted FRK gene (Fig. CITATION-CITATION). After 21 days of growth on soil there was no difference in rosette diameter among any of the single FRK mutants or WT control plants (Fig. CITATION), suggesting a lack of vegetative phenotype and possible redundancy between some of the FRKs.Fig. 8Single T-DNA insertional mutants exhibit no growth phenotype.

There were no statistical differences between any of the rosette diameters To gain further insight into the biological roles for Arabidopsis FRK enzymes, we visualized the intracellular localization of FRKs expressed as C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions transiently in tobacco leaves (N. benthamiana) and examined by confocal microscopy. The majority of a plant cell’s cytoplasm comprises the vacuole, such that the cytosol is compressed between the vacuolar and plasma membranes. Cytosolic proteins therefore appear around the edges of cells by microscopy, as seen for a known GFP-tagged cytosolic protein, β-glucuronidase (Fig. CITATION). FRK1-YFP was observed in the cytosol as the YFP signal was most abundant around the edges of cells with apparent cytosolic bridges connecting parts of the cell (Fig. CITATION). The same was true for FRK2-YFP, and FRK4–7-YFP (Fig. CITATION, e-h). As mentioned previously, FRK3 was predicted to contain a cTP and, therefore, predicted to be chloroplast-localized. We found FRK3-YFP fluorescence to be coincident with chlorophyll auto-fluorescence, which confirms its predicted chloroplast localization (Fig. CITATION).Fig. 9Localization of fluorescently tagged Arabidopsis FRKs transiently expressed in tobacco leaves.

Scale = 10 μM In order to determine whether orthologous FRKs are present in other plant species for all seven Arabidopsis FRKs, we compared the amino acid sequences of the seven active Arabidopsis FRKs with those of other plant species with sequenced genomes including Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa (rice), Solanum lycospersicum (tomato), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Zea mays (maize), Brachypodium distaychon, and Physcomitrella patens (moss). We then created a phylogenetic tree using all protein sequences along with all Arabidopsis pfkB sequences. We included all proteins that were within one branch from any of the seven active Arabidopsis FRKs. This yielded 51 protein sequences comprised of seven from Arabidopsis, 11 from Medicago, three from rice, four from tomato, four from Populus, four from Brachypodium, eight from maize, and eight from Physcomitrella (moss). Several interesting relationships were apparent from the resulting phylogenetic tree comprised of the 51 confirmed and putative FRKs (Fig. CITATION). All Physcomitrella sequences were confined to two clades and, interestingly, those clades included Physcomitrella sequences only, indicating that Physcomitrella FRK sequences are more similar to each other than they are to FRKs from other species. There were two clades that included a single sequence from all other species excluding Physcomitrella (Fig. CITATION, green shading). One clade contains AtFRK3 and the second includes AtFRK4. Another large clade includes four Arabidopsis proteins, FRK2, FRK5–7, as well as sequences from poplar, tomato, and Medicago, but does not include any sequences from a monocot species. Similarly, another clade contains FRK1, and a tomato sequence, as well as two poplar sequences, and six Medicago sequences that are more distantly related, and no monocot proteins. There is one weakly separated monocot-specific clade with four maize sequences and one each from rice and Brachypodium. A few monocot proteins seem equidistant from all other pfkBs.Fig. 10Phylogeny of putative FRK enzymes from multiple species.

Phylogenetic relationships between the 22 Arabidopsis pfkB-type proteins or sequences of putative FRKs from other species were evaluated by maximum parsimony in PAUP*4.0b10 [CITATION] using an alignment of pfkB protein sequences constructed with MUSCLE [CITATION] and manually adjusted to remove phylogenetically uninformative sequences. Statistical support for relationships was evaluated by 100 bootstrap replicates for the phylogram in Fig. CITATION, with ten random addition heuristic searches using the branch and bound algorithm for each bootstrap replicate using PAUP*4.0b10. For the generation of the phylogram in Fig. CITATION, Phytozome was used to search the genomes of Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, Populus trichocarpa, Physcomitrella patens, Zea mays, and Brachypodium distachyon for the keyword “pfkB”. All resulting sequences were downloaded and aligned along with the peptide sequences from seven Arabidopsis FRKs in MUSCLE [CITATION]. Then a phylogenetic tree was calculated based on that alignment in PhyML 3.0 [CITATION] and visualized in iTOL [CITATION]. Sequences that were within one branch of Arabidopsis FRKs were considered to be putative FRKs. All putative FRKs were realigned in MUSCLE [CITATION] and the alignment was manually adjusted using jalview [CITATION]. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. CITATION was calculated from the trimmed alignment of putative and known FRKs from all species in PhyML 3.0 using default settings. Statistical support for relationships was evaluated by 100 bootstrap replicates in PhyML 3.0 and visualized in iTOL. Branches with >50% bootstrap support are depicted on the phylogram as colored edges where red represents those close to 50% and green represents those approaching 100%.Table 3Gene identifiers for those used in sequence analysis in Figs.

CITATION and CITATION For FRK2, FRK3, FRK4, FRK5, and FRK7, RNA was extracted from 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and used to generate cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Supermix (Invitrogen). pENTR223 and pDONR221 based clones for FRK1 (G09822) and FRK5 (DQ056446), respectively, were obtained from the ABRC and were recombined directly into destination vectors for bacterial expression. Clones for transient expression in tobacco leaves and for Arabidopsis transformation had their stop codon mutated and Gateway (Invitrogen) recombination sites added via PCR using the primers listed in Table CITATION. All PCR for cloning was carried out using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR products for all clones were recombined into pDONR201 or pDONR207 (Invitrogen) via the BP clonase (Invitrogen) reaction and transformed into E. coli strain DH5α (New England Biolabs) for propagation of plasmid DNA. Sequences were verified at the UC Davis DNA sequencing facility. Clones were then recombined into pEAK2 [CITATION] for bacterial expression; or pEARLEYGATE101 [CITATION] or pGWB441 [CITATION] via the LR clonase (Invitrogen) reaction for transient expression in tobacco leaves.Table 4Primers used in these studiesCloning primersAGI Number of target and primer directionPurposePrimer sequence (5′- -3′)At2g31390 – forwardFRK2 bacterial/plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGGCATCCAACGGTGATAAAGGAt2g31390 – reverseFRK2 bacterial expressionGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTATTTCTTTTCGAGAt1g66430 – forwardFRK3 bacterial expression/removal of cTPGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGTCTAATCTCAAAGGAAGAGCAt1g66430 – reverseFRK3 bacterial expressionGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTTAAACGACGGCTTTGAGAt4g10260 – forwardFRK4 bacterial/plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGGCTAATACTCCATTGAt4g10260 – reverseFRK4 bacterial expressionGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTATTTAGACTTAGATTTCAt1g06030 – forwardFRK6 bacterial/plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGACGTCATCCAACGGCGAt1g06030 – reverseFRK6 bacterial expressionGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTATTCTACTTGTATCTTAAGAt3g59480 – forwardFRK7 bacterial/plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGGCTGCATCTAACGGCGAGAt3g59480 – reverseFRK7 bacterial expressionGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTTAGTTTCCTTTCAGGAGGCAt5g51830 – forwardFRK1 plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGGGTGAGGATGCAATCTCAt5g51830 – reverseFRK1 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGACGATCGAGTAGAAGAAAGAt2g31390 – reverseFRK2 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCCATTTCTTTTCGAGAt1g66430 – forwardFRK3 plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGGCTCTCCAAGCCACTACAt1g66430 – reverseFRK3 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGAAACGACGGCTTTGAGAt4g10260 – reverseFRK4 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCGATTTAGACTTAGATTTCAt1g06020 – forwardFRK5 plant expressionGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGATGGCATCATCCACCGGCGAt1g06020 – reverseFRK5 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGAACAAGGgctAGCCGTACAACACCAt1g06030 – reverseFRK6 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCGATTCTACTTGTATCTTAAGAt3g59480 – reverseFRK7 plant expression stop codon mutationGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGAGTTTCCTTTCAGGAGGCPrimers for analysis of T-DNA insertional mutantsArabidopsis T-DNA linePrimer targetPrimer sequence (5′- -3′) frk1–1 (SALK_046463)gDNACTGGGATGAGATTCGACCATgDNA/T-DNAGGCAAGGTTCCTCAATCAAAcDNA flanking insertATGTTAGCTGATATTCTAAGcDNA flanking insertTAGCAGCTTCTTCTGATGGC frk2–1 (SALKseq_17726)gDNA/T-DNATCATGGCGAGGATCTTTTGCTgDNACACACTAGTTTTGCCTTCTGGTcDNA flanking insertTAGTGGAGCCGTGTAGGTCAcDNA flanking insertAGCTCAACATCGCTCACCTT frk2–2 (SALK_114786)gDNA 5’TTCTTCTCCTTGTCCTTCCTTgDNA/ T-DNA 3’CGAGACGAGAAACAGCGATTcDNA flanking insertCTTCGGCGAGATGCTAATCGcDNA flanking insertTCCCAGCCAACATATGACCG frk3–1 (SALK_044085)gDNACGTCCTATCTCCATCAAAGCgDNA/T-DNACGCTTGTCGTCGGTACAAcDNA flanking insertGTTTTACCGAAACCCGAGTGcDNA flanking insertCCGCCTTAGCTGCAGAAATA frk3–2 (SALK_035386)gDNACCGCCTTAGCTGCAGAAATAgDNA/T-DNAGTTTTACCGAAACCCGAGTGcDNA flanking insertGTTTTACCGAAACCCGAGTGcDNA flanking insertCCGCCTTAGCTGCAGAAATA frk5–1 (SALK_027635)gDNACGCTTTTGTCACTTTGCGTTCTGAC frk5–2 (SALK_057002)gDNA/T-DNACGAGTACGGACTGGTCATCAACAAcDNA flanking insertGATGATTTCGGTCATATGCTCGCcDNA flanking insertGGAGAAGCCGTACAACACCA frk7–1 (GABI_253H07)gDNACAGCACGGTCATCAACAATCgDNA/T-DNATAGCGAACGGTGCTACATCAT-DNA (GABI)ATATTGACCATCATACTCATTGCcDNA flanking insertAACGGTGTCTCTGCTGAAGGcDNA flanking insertTCAGGAGGCTCTGAACTTCASALK T-DNA Left borderT-DNA in SALK linesTGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCGPositive control gene (At1g49350)cDNAGCGTGGATGCCGTTGAAAAT Primers used in these studies Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21-pLys-S (New England Biolabs) and purified via Ni Sepharose (GE Healthcare) affinity chromatography. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.5, complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), mixed with resin and the beads washed with at least 10 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris, 1.5 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) and eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Eluate was brought to 20% glycerol and was flash frozen and stored at −80 °C. Concentration of recombinant proteins was determined using Protein Assay Reagent (BioRad) and BSA to generate standard curves. Purity was determined by coomassie staining of an 10% SDS-acrylamide gel. Enzymatic assays were carried out in assays coupling the production of ADP to NADH oxidation and monitored by A340. The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ATP, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 mM inorganic phosphate, 1 mM NADH, 1 mM fructose, 2 U/mL lactate dehydrogenase, 2 U/mL pyruvate kinase. Reactions were carried out in 100 μl volumes in microplate format (NUNC) and A340 was monitored using a Spectra Max 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). For the determination of Km values of ribose and ATP, initial reaction rates were measured in concentrations of ribose or ATP, respectively, varied between 2 and 0.0625 mM with all other parameters held constant. Data were plotted and biochemical parameters determined via non-linear curve fitting to either the Michaelis Menten equation or substrate inhibition equation as appropriate in Prism 7 (GraphPad). To determine the effect of monovalent cations, initial reaction rates were determined in the presence of 100 mM KCl, or NaCl and normalized to that of KCl. To determine the effect of divalent cations, initial reaction rates were determined in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 or EDTA, and normalized to that of MgCl2. Inorganic phosphate was omitted from the reaction to test its requirement. Nucleotide preference was tested by substituting the 0.1 mM ATP with 0.1 mM GTP or UTP, and normalized to that of 0.1 mM ATP. All assays to determine Vmax and Km were performed in triplicate. Assays to determine cofactor requirements were performed in quadruplicate and expressed as scatterplots showing all data points. Statistical differences were determined using two-way analysis of variance and post hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison test in Prism (GraphPad). Agrobacteria strain AGL1 (gift from Charles Gasser, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, UC-Davis [CITATION]) carrying vectors to express C-terminally YFP-tagged FRKs were co-infiltrated with AGL Agrobacteria carrying P19 (gift from Richard Michelmore, Plant Sciences Department, UC-Davis [CITATION]) into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. After 48 h, a small leaf disc close to the site of infiltration was excised and then prepared and mounted similarly to what was shown in Littlejohn and Love [CITATION]. Briefly, leaf discs were soaked in perfluorodecalin for 5 min and then mounted on slides in a small well created with Carolina Observation Gel (Carolina Biological Supply Company), covered with a coverslip, and imaged on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope using a 40× objective and the appropriate filters.
