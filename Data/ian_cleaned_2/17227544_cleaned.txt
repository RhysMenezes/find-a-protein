!~ABS~! Homologous recombination (HR) is an essential process in maintaining genome integrity and variability. In eukaryotes, the Rad52 epistasis group proteins are involved in meiotic recombination and/or HR repair. One member of this group, Rad54, belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-stimulated ATPases. Recent studies indicate that Rad54 has important functions in HR, both as a chromatin remodelling factor and as a mediator of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. Despite the importance of Rad54 in HR, no study of Rad54 from plants has yet been performed. Here, we cloned the full-length AtRAD54 cDNA sequence; an open reading frame of 910 amino acids encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 101.9 kDa. Western blotting analysis showed that the AtRad54 protein was indeed expressed as a protein of approximately 110 kDa in Arabidopsis. The predicted protein sequence of AtRAD54 contains seven helicase domains, which are conserved in all other Rad54s. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed an interaction between Arabidopsis Rad51 and Rad54. AtRAD54 transcripts were found in all tissues examined, with the highest levels of expression in flower buds. Expression of AtRAD54 was induced by γ-irradiation. A T-DNA insertion mutant of AtRAD54 devoid of full-length AtRAD54 expression was viable and fertile; however, it showed increased sensitivity to γ-irradiation and the cross-linking reagent cisplatin. In addition, the efficiency of somatic HR in the mutant plants was reduced relative to that in wild-type plants. Our findings point to an important role for Rad54 in HR repair in higher plants.
!~RES~! We identified a RAD54-like gene (At3g19210 in P1 clone, MVI11, GenBank accession number AP000419) in the Arabidopsis genome database by using the programs blastx and tblastn with the human RAD54 (GenBank accession number X97795), Drosophila RAD54 (GenBank accession number Y10229) and S. cerevisiaeRAD54 (GenBank accession number M63232) sequences. MVl11 is located on chromosome III near the DNA marker ve039. A full-length cDNA sequence corresponding to this gene was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using specific primers designed according to the genomic DNA sequences, and named AtRAD54. The AtRAD54 cDNA is 2849 bp in length, with 62 bp of 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 54 bp of 3′-UTR, and encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of 910 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 101.9 kDa. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that the gene comprises 22 exons and 21 introns. The computer prediction of the coding sequence of this gene from the Arabidopsis genome database misplaces an exon–intron junction between the 18th and 19th exons, and this predicts a protein (protein ID number BAB02963) with an insertion of 49 amino acids compared with that predicted from our cDNA sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of AtRad54 showed the highest degree of homology to human Rad54 (44.3% identity and 55.3% similarity). The overall identity between AtRad54 and other known Rad54 proteins was between 39.4% and 44.3%. The predicted amino acid sequence of AtRad54 contains highly conserved helicase domains (helicase motifs I to VI), which are characteristic of SWI2/SNF2 family members (Figure S1). The identity and similarity among all known Rad54 proteins including AtRad54 protein was highest in this region (48.8–53.0% identity and 57.5–64.9% similarity). However, the amino- and carboxy-termini (N- and C-termini) also showed significant levels of identity to known Rad54s and contained several conserved regions (Table S1). The C-terminus of AtRad54 (262 amino acids) is longer than those of other Rad54 proteins (129–171 amino acids) (Figure S2). Phylogenetic analysis of SWI2/SNF2 family proteins also showed that AtRad54 was closely related to Rad54 subfamily members, but not to other members (Figure 1a). In contrast, other SNF2-like protein sequences from Arabidopsis belong to subfamilies other than the Rad54 subfamily (Figure 1a). Southern blotting analysis under high-stringency conditions showed that AtRAD54 was present as a single copy gene in A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (data not shown) as predicted by database searching. We also found a candidate for the Oryza sativaRAD54 gene (Figure 1a; Mimida, N., Osakabe, K., Toki, S., Ichikawa, H., National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan, unpublished data). The predicted OsRad54 protein sequence showed the highest homology to AtRad54 with 66.3% identity and 71.6% similarity. Like AtRad54, OsRad54 also contained a longer C-terminus (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] To confirm expression of the AtRad54 protein in Arabidopsis, we raised a rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal region of AtRad54 (amino acids 646–910). The resulting antiserum [anti-At54(646_910)-Ab] was first used in Western blot analysis of crude extracts or nuclear fractions from flower buds. However, no immunoreactive band of the expected molecular mass was detected (data not shown). We then used the anti-At54(646_910)-Ab to immunoprecipitate AtRad54 from crude extracts of flower buds, and analysed all immunoprecipitated proteins by Western blot. We detected a protein of approximately 110 kDa, which is in good agreement with the theoretical molecular weight of the AtRad54 protein (Figure 1b). This result indicated the presence of an AtRad54 protein in Arabidopsis with a molecular mass similar to that of other Rad54 proteins. A protein–protein interaction between AtRad54 and AtRad51 was revealed using the yeast two-hybrid system (Figure 2a). The interaction of AtRad54 and AtRad51 fusion proteins was found to be asymmetrical. Similar results have been observed for the human and Arabidopsis Rad51–Xrcc3 interaction (CITATION; CITATION), the human Rad51–Rad52 interaction (CITATION) and the yeast Rad51–Rad54 interaction (CITATION) when Rad51 was used as the DNA-binding-domain fusion protein with the GAL4 or LexA DNA-binding domain (BD). These results suggest that the GAL4 and LexA BD + Rad51 fusion proteins interfere with the interaction between Rad51 and other proteins but not with self-association of Rad51, as also observed in this study. Next, we determined the domain of AtRad54 that interacts with AtRad51. N-terminal (54N; amino acids 1–205), central helicase domain (54HD; amino acids 202–676) and C-terminal (54C; amino acids 645–910) regions were separately cloned into LexA BD plasmids. BD + 54N, BD + 54HD and BD + 54C fusion constructs were introduced into yeast together with the AD + AtRad51 fusion construct. According to the qualitative β-galactosidase assay, the N-terminal region of AtRad54 (amino acids 1–205) was sufficient to interact with AtRad51 (Figure 2b), whereas the helicase and C-terminal domains of AtRad54 could not interact with AtRad51 (Figure 2b). We also investigated protein–protein interactions between AtRad54 and other Rad51 family proteins from Arabidopsis (AtDmc1, AtRad51Cα and AtXrcc3). None of the Arabidopsis Rad51 family proteins except AtRad51 could interact with AtRad54, and self-interaction of AtRad54 was not observed in our system (Figure 2a,c). [[FIGURE]] We examined the expression pattern of the AtRAD54 gene by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3(a), the highest expression of the AtRAD54 gene was detected in young stages of flower buds, which contain abundant microsporocytes undergoing meiosis (CITATION). However, relatively higher expression of the AtRAD54 gene was also found in older stages of flower buds, mature flowers and roots. Thus, although AtRAD54 transcripts are enriched in meiotic tissues, expression of this gene is not specific to meiosis. The tissue-specific expression pattern of the AtRAD54 gene resembles that of AtRAD51, which is shown in Figure 3(a) and reported by CITATION. [[FIGURE]] Rad54 is involved in DNA repair following genotoxic stresses such as IR and alkylating agents. Expression of RAD54 genes in S. cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa is induced by several DNA-damaging agents (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we tested whether the expression of AtRAD54 is induced following genotoxic stress. We used γ-rays, which induce DSBs as the DNA-damaging agent. As shown in Figure 3(b), expression of AtRAD54 was markedly induced in a dose-dependent manner following γ-irradiation. A similar expression pattern was also seen for AtRAD51, although induction rates of AtRAD51 were higher than those of AtRAD54. The induction rates of AtRAD54 transcripts were about 10-fold under 50 Gy and about 30-fold under 200 Gy of γ-irradiation, respectively. We also analysed the time course of induction after γ-irradiation. Following 70 Gy of γ-irradiation, AtRAD54 gene transcripts accumulated within 120 min (Figure 3c). The AtRAD51 gene responded more rapidly to γ-rays than the AtRAD54 gene; accumulation of AtRAD51 gene transcripts was observed within 60 min post-irradiation (Figure 3c). To determine the distribution of AtRAD54 gene expression, we used an AtRAD54 promoter–GFP + β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion. To analyse expression of this reporter gene, pCA54p1.8GFP + GUS was introduced into Arabidopsis via in planta transformation (Figure 4a). Three independent transformants containing the pCA54p1.8GFP + GUS construct were analysed histochemically for localization of GUS activity. All three lines showed GUS activity in the hydathodes in cotyledons (Figure 4b, panel D), style of flowers (Figure 4b, panel F) and the vascular bundles of petioles (Figure 4b, panel E). Although we could not observe any obvious GUS activity in roots, RT-PCR analysis did detect expression of AtRAD54 in roots (Figure 3a). Next, we examined whether GUS activity in these transformants is induced following γ-irradiation. At 32 h after γ-irradiation, increased GUS activity was detected at the edges of both cotyledons and true leaves (Figure 4b, panels H and L), and in the upper part of the hypocotyl (Figure 4b, panels I and M). At 70 h after γ-irradiation, increased GUS activity was detected over the entire cotyledon, hypocotyl and true leaves in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4b, panels J and N). The 1.8-kb fragment of the 5′ upstream region of AtRAD54 contains sequences similar to cis-element sequences found in UV- and IR-inducible genes [AtRAD51 (CITATION; Hiratsuka, K., personal communication), Schizosaccharomyces pombe RHP51 (CITATION), S. cerevisiae PHR1 (CITATION)] (Table S2). Schizosaccharomyces pombeRHP51 encodes a recombinational repair protein that shows homology to S. cerevisiae RAD51 (CITATION). The PHR1 gene encodes the apoenzyme of a photolyase that catalyses the repair of pyrimidine dimers in DNA (CITATION). This suggested that the similar cis-elements in the AtRAD54 gene are important for the upregulation of AtRAD54 expression following DNA damage. Again, we could not detect GUS activity in roots after γ-irradiation. We assayed transient GUS activity using a deletion series of several AtRAD54 promoter–GUS reporter gene fusions. Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 plants were infected with Agrobacterium containing constructs with 3.6, 1.8, 0.9 or 0.5 kb of the 5′-upstream region of AtRAD54 (Figure S2a). However, none of these constructs led to GUS staining in roots (Figure S2b). One possible explanation might be that the 3.6-kb 5′-upstream region of AtRAD54 might lack important regulatory elements required for expression of AtRAD54 in roots. Alternatively, the coding or 3′-downstream regions might be required for AtRAD54 expression in roots. [[FIGURE]] To study the function of the AtRAD54 gene in Arabidopsis, we searched for loss-of-function mutants. A single line, SALK_038057, from the Salk Institute T-DNA insertion collection (CITATION) was identified, and the corresponding allele was named atrad54-1. We also searched EMS-induced mutants by using tilling (http://tilling.fhcrc.org:9366/; CITATION), and synonymous changes only in the coding sequence of AtRAD54 were detected. The T-DNA insertion in atrad54-1 was confirmed by PCR, and flanking regions of the T-DNA were confirmed by direct sequencing. The T-DNA insertion was flanked by two left borders in opposite orientation (Figure 5a,b). The insertion of the T-DNA caused a 27-bp deletion in the 19th exon and a 16-bp deletion in the 19th intron, and the insertion of 20 bp unknown filler DNA at the LB2 side of the T-DNA (Figure 5b). We analysed the expression level of AtRAD54 gene transcripts in the atrad54-1 mutant by Northern blotting analysis. We were able to detect a 2.9-kb signal with RNA from wild-type plants and a 2.5-kb signal with RNA from the atrad54-1 plants using a probe corresponding to the N-terminus of AtRad54 (Figure 5c). The expression level of the shorter mRNA signal in the mutant was higher than that in the wild type. When we used a probe corresponding to the C-terminus of AtRad54, we also detected a 2.9-kb mRNA band in wild-type plants, but no signal was seen in atrad54-1 plants (Figure 5c). We also analysed the level of translation of the AtRad54 protein in atrad54-1 plants. Using anti-At54(649-910)-Ab, no immunoreactive signal was detected in mutant plants (Figure 5d, lane −/−), while a 110-kDa band was detected in wild-type plants (Figure 5d, lane +/+). Thus, we concluded that the mutant plants could not express the entire full-length Rad54 protein, although it remains possible that a partial Rad54 protein, with a 142-amino-acid C-terminal deletion, could be expressed (Figure 5b). The atrad54-1 mutant did not exhibit any irregularity in growth or shape. Seeds obtained from mutant plants were phenotypically normal and the number of seeds per pod in these mutants did not differ from that of wild-type plants. Seeds from mutant plants have been found to germinate normally, so far over four generations (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] Because the AtRAD54 gene is induced in response to γ-irradiation, we hypothesized that AtRAD54 is involved in DSB repair, despite the observed lack of growth defect in atrad54-1 plants. Therefore, we tested whether the atrad54-1 mutant showed any sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. We first tested the sensitivity of atrad54-1 to γ-irradiation. Seeds were imbibed for 4 days at 4°C and then irradiated with several doses of γ-rays. Sensitivity to γ-irradiation was scored based on the number of true leaves produced on MS agar medium. The number of true leaves of each plant was counted at 9, 14 and 21 days post-irradiation (DPI). When imbibed seeds were irradiated with 150 and 200 Gy (a dose rate of 720 Gy h−1), production of true leaves was reduced to approximately 80% in mutant plants compared to wild-type plants at 9–21 DPI (Figure 6a). We next tested the sensitivity of mutants to a cross-linking regent, cisplatin. Cisplatin produces intra- and interstrand DNA cross-links. Both types of cross-link induce DSBs during DNA synthesis. These lesions are thought to be repaired predominantly by HR during S-phase; in addition, interstrand DNA cross-links are repaired exclusively by HR (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, this experiment also aimed to provide evidence for the contribution of AtRad54 to repair of DSBs via HR. Sensitivity to cisplatin was scored based on the number of true leaves produced on MS agar medium containing cisplatin. As shown in Figure 6(b), atrad54-1 plants showed hypersensitivity to cisplatin. The average number of true leaves was reduced to below 70% in mutant plants compared to wild-type plants at 9–21 DAP on 30 μm cisplatin medium. The production of leaves in atrad54-1 plants on 50 μm cisplatin medium was drastically reduced to below 20%, even at 21 DAP, compared with wild-type plants (Figure 6b). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that the higher sensitivity to genotoxic stresses reflects the AtRAD54 deficiency in the mutant, we downregulated the AtRAD54 transcript level in wild-type plants using an RNAi approach. Several RNAi lines with strongly suppressed AtRAD54 expression showed increased sensitivity to γ-irradiation and cisplatin compared to control plants transformed with empty vector (Figure S3). These results supported our conclusion that the increased sensitivity to cisplatin and γ-irradiation of atrad54-1 compared with wild-type plants is due to decreased expression of the complete form of AtRAD54. For further characterization of the function of AtRad54 in HR, atrad54-1 plants were monitored for somatic HR using an in planta recombination assay with a reporter gene consisting of two overlapping fragments of the GUS gene separated by a hygromycin-resistant marker (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The GUS sequences have an overlap of 618-bp and recombination events between the two overlapping sequences can produce a functional GUS gene resulting in blue-coloured GUS spots in cells, which are detected by histochemical staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide (X-gluc). In this study, we used GUS recombination reporter lines 1415, 1445 (intrachromosomal, inverted-repeat recombination reporter lines; CITATION) and IC9 (interchromosomal recombination reporter line; CITATION) for the in planta recombination assay. The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 7. The spontaneous HR frequency (HRF) of atrad54-1 plants was reduced to approximately 40% in the intrachromosomal recombination reporter lines and 34% in the interchromosomal recombination reporter line compared with that of wild-type plants (Table 1). Thus, atrad54 showed a hypo-recombination phenotype for somatic chromosomal recombination. Somatic HRF in wild-type plants was enhanced following γ-irradiation, showing a 3.0- to 3.2-fold induction in the intrachromosomal recombination reporter lines and a 1.3-fold induction in the interchromosomal recombination reporter line (Table 1). Although the baseline level of HRF in atrad54-1 plants was reduced to approximately 30% in the intrachromosomal recombination reporter lines and 34% in the interchromosomal recombination reporter line compared with levels seen in wild-type plants (Table 1), somatic HRF in atrad54-1 plants was also enhanced by γ-irradiation, with fold induction being similar to that of γ-irradiated wild-type plants (Table 1). Similar results were observed in wild-type and mutant plants after treatment with 5 μm cisplatin (Table 1, Figure 7), with the fold-induction in HRF observed upon cisplatin treatment in atrad54-1 plants being similar to that of wild-type plants, although the absolute level of HRF was approximately 40% of wild type in the intrachromosomal recombination reporter lines and 30% of wild type in the interchromosomal recombination reporter line. n = numbers of plants tested. The total number of blue stained recombination spots (N) and the mean number of spots per plant (M) in chromosomal recombination assays of wild-type and atrad54-1 plants under two different treatments are given. E = fold enhancement relative to no stress. 1415, 1445: results with the intrachromosomal, inverted-repeat recombination reporter lines, 1415 and 1445. IC9: results with the interchromosomal recombination repeat reporter line, IC9. [[FIGURE]] According to the analysis of recombination assay with the atrad54-1 mutant, AtRad54 is important for HR in Arabidopsis. To test the effect of AtRAD54 overexpression on HR, we designed the construct pBKAt54 to overexpress the AtRAD54 gene in Arabidopsis (Figure 8a). The GUS recombination reporter line 1445 was transformed via in planta transformation. Overexpression of AtRAD54 in transgenic lines (At54OX) was determined by Northern and Western blotting (Figure 8b,c). The expression level of AtRAD54 varied between different transgenic lines, ranging from 3- to 20-fold higher than AtRAD54 expression in 1445 plants (Figure 8b). Overexpressing lines did not show any abnormal growth or fertility phenotypes. We chose three lines, AtOX-5, -7 and -8, each carrying a single transgene locus according to segregation analysis of antibiotic resistance, in which expression levels of the AtRad54 protein were two- to threefold higher than those from the parental line 1445 (Figure 8c). Somatic HRF in these lines was monitored in T3 progeny plants homozygous for the transgene. We expected that excess AtRad54 would facilitate nucleosome repositioning or DNA unwinding to enhance HR in Arabidopsis. However, AtRad54 overexpressors did not show enhanced spontaneous or DNA-damage-induced HR; if anything, HRF was slightly reduced compared to the parental line 1445 (Table 2; Figure 8d,e). Thus, we concluded that overexpression of AtRAD54 did not affect intrachromosomal HRF. [[FIGURE]] n = numbers of plants tested. The total number of blue stained recombination spots (N) and the mean number of spots per plant (M) in chromosomal recombination assays of 1445 and AtRAD54 overexpressor lines At54OX-5, -7 and -8 are given together with the fold-enhancement in response to cisplatin treatment (E).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used in this study. Plants were grown on a commercial potting mix (Sakata Super Mix, Sakata Seed, Tokyo, Japan) in a growth chamber at 22°C with a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle. Sterile plants were incubated on Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (CITATION) solidified with 0.25% gelrite (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or 0.8% bacto-agar (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) in a growth chamber on 16-h/8-h light/dark cycles at 22°C. Genomic DNA was isolated from 2- to 4-week-old sterile plants with the DNeasy Plant Maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions provided by the supplier. Purification of poly(A)+ RNA was performed with the Oligotex®-dt30 <Super> mRNA purification kit (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan). The following Arabidopsis tissues were used as starting materials: 2-week-old sterile seedlings, roots from 2-week-old sterile seedlings, flowering shoots, rosette leaves, flower buds <0.5 mm, flower buds >1 mm, and flowers. Sequencing reactions were performed with the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Reaction products were analysed with an automatic DNA sequencer, ABI PRISM® 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcription was performed using ReverTra Ace® (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer with total RNA from Arabidopsis flower buds. Polymerase chain reaction and RACE were performed with the high-fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase, KOD-Plus (Toyobo). 5′- and 3′-RACE was performed using the SMART® RACE PCR kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with gene-specific primers designed according to the genomic DNA sequence. The gene-specific primers used were At54 5′R-1 (5′-CCATAGGCGTCCCATCAAATCCTTG ACA-3′) and At54 5′R-2 (5′-GCCAGAATGCAACCATTTATATTTGCCG-3′) for 5′-RACE; At54 3′R-1 (5′-ACCAGCGCCAGATGTCAAAAGAAGGGCT-3′) and At54 3′R-2 (5′-CAGCATGAACAGACGGATAACAGCACGAG-3′) for 3′-RACE; At54 5′ end (5′-GCCGCCAAAAGAGTTTTAGGATTGGTC-3′) and At54 3′ end (5′-ACCAAATGTGCATAAAATTAGCATAAAATGTC-3′) for amplification of full-length cDNA. Thermal cycle programmes were as follows: 95°C for 2 min, 30 cycles of (95°C for 15 sec, 68°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 1 min) and 72°C for 10 min for 5′- and 3′-RACE; 95°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of (95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 3 min) and 72°C for 10 min for amplification of full-length cDNA. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pCR®2.1 TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) for DNA sequencing. blast searches were performed within the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases by using the programs blastx and tblastn with known RAD54 sequences. Sequence analysis was performed with genetyx software (GENETYX, Tokyo, Japan). Pairwise comparisons were conducted using the GCG software package version 10 (GCG, Madison, WI, USA). Multiple alignment and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the clustal x program (CITATION). The tree was displayed using the program treeview (CITATION). Southern and Northern blotting analyses were performed as described previously (CITATION). The DNA probes were prepared using the PCR digoxigenin (DIG) probe synthesis kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with primer sets, 54_ATG (5′-ATGGAGGAAGAAGATGAAGAGATCTTATC-3′) and 54_stop (5′-CCACCGTTTTTGGACTGACATTTGATTCG-3′) for 54_full probe; 54_ATG and 54ex3R (5′-CCCATGTCATCAGCCAGAATGCAACCA-3′) for 54 N-ter probe; 54ex19F (5′-GATGACAATGCTTGCCAGATTGACCA-3′) and 54_stop for 54 C-ter probe; 51F (5′-CAAGGCTTTTGCTTGAAGCAGC-3′) and 512 (5′-CAATCCTTGCAATCTGTTACACCTTCTG-3′) for AtRAD51 (accession number U43528) probe; EF1αA4-1 (5′-GACAAGCGTGTCATCGAGAGGTTCG-3′) and EF1αA4-2 (5′-TTGTCTGATGGCCTCTTGGGCTCGT-3′) for AtEF1αA4 (accession number X16432) probe. Hybridization and washing were performed under high-stringency conditions with 0.1× SSC. To obtain polyclonal antibodies against AtRad54, a recombinant protein comprising amino acids 646–910 of AtRad54 fused to a His-tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) as described in a previous study (CITATION). The recombinant protein was purified and used to immunize a rabbit. Antibody was affinity-purified with Protein A-sepharoseFF column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Crude extracts were prepared from flower buds, roots or entire 2-week-old plants. Seven hundred micrograms of cell extracts was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by using Seize®X Protein A Immunoprecipitation Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 20 μl of sample buffer [70 mm Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 6% glycerol, 1.86% dithiothreitol and 0.0024% bromophenol blue]. Protein samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Hybond® ECL® (GE Healthcare) nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T (12.5 mm Tris–HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 5% non-fat dried milk (TBS-TMil), washed in TBS-T, and incubated for 3 h at room temperature in 1:5000–1:10 000 dilutions of anti-At54(646_910)-Ab in TBS-TMil. Blots were washed in TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:100 000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in TBS-TMil. Antibody-bound proteins were visualized with the SuperSignal® West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed with the DuplexA yeast two-hybrid system (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). The entire coding sequences for AtRAD54, AtDMC1 (accession number U76670), AtRAD51 (accession number U43528), AtRAD51Cα (accession number AB062456) and AtXRCC3 (accession number AB062455) were amplified by PCR, and cloned into the LexA DNA BD plasmid (pEG202) and the B42 transcriptional activation domain (AD) plasmid (pJG4.5). The AtRad54 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–205), central helicase domain (amino acids 202–676) and C-terminal domain (amino acids 645–910) were also amplified by PCR, and cloned into the LexA BD plasmid, pEG202nls. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that no errors were incorporated and that all fusions were in-frame with either AD or BD. The yeast strain EGY48 (MATαtrp1 his3 ura3 leu2::6LexAop-LEU2) was co-transformed with the AD plasmid, the BD plasmid and the eight LexA operators + LacZ reporter gene plasmid (pSH18-34), and transformants were selected on synthetic complete agar medium lacking histidine, tryptophan and uracil, with dextrose as the carbon source (SD–His–Trp–Ura). β-Galactosidase activity was tested qualitatively on selective agar medium containing 2 mm X-gal with galactose and raffinose as carbon sources (SGal His–Trp–Ura). Arabidopsis plants and imbibed seeds were irradiated with various doses of γ-rays (50–800 Gy) using a 60Co source at various dose rates (12.5–720 Gy h−1). For RNA extraction, samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen after the required time had passed, and stored at −80°C or immediately ground. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described in a previous study (CITATION). The gene-specific primers used were 54ex2F (5′-TGTAGGAAGCCTTTCAAACCTCC-3′) and 54ex2R (5′-TGGTTGATGCTTCCAGCTTAG-3′) for AtRAD54; 51F and 51R (5′-GCCACACCAAACTCATCTGCTAA-3′) for AtRAD51 (accession number U43528); EF1αA4F (5′-AGGCTGGTATCT CTAAGGATGGTCA-3′) and EF1αA4R2 (5′-GGATTTTGTCAGGGTTGTATCCG-3′) for AtEF1αA4. The PCR products were transferred onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with gene-specific probes as described above for signal detection. The promoter region of AtRAD54 was isolated by PCR using genomic DNA of Arabidopsis (ecotype Col-0) as a template. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment was confirmed by sequencing. The 1.8-kb promoter fragment of AtRAD54 was obtained by PCR with primers 5′-AACGTCGACAATTCCtGCAGTTC GTGG-3′ and 5′-CTCTAGATCTTCTTCCTCCATTTTCGTTACAC-3′. The CaMV 35S promoter of the binary vector pCAMBIA1304 was replaced with a 1.8-kb fragment of the AtRAD54 promoter using SalI and BglII sites (pCA54p1.8GFP + GUS) (see Figure 5a). pCA54p1.8GFP + GUS was introduced into A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 by electroporation, and the resultant strain was used to transform Arabidopsis by floral dip transformation (CITATION). Primary transformants were screened on MS medium solidified with 0.25% gelrite containing 20 mg l−1 hygromycin. T2 plants were screened for hygromycin resistance on MS gelrite plates containing 20 mg l−1 hygromycin over a period of 14 days. Hygromycin-resistant plants were transferred to MS gelrite plates without hygromycin and were irradiated with various dose rates of γ-rays (400 Gy at 149.8 Gy h−1 or 800 Gy at 299.6 Gy h−1) using a 60Co source. At 32–72 h after irradiation, plants were soaked in GUS staining buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg ml−1 X-Gluc, 2 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm potassium ferricyanide, 100 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol and 5% methanol. The enzymatic reaction was performed over 3 days at 37°C. Tissues were cleared with 70% ethanol to remove pigments. Plants were then observed under a dissecting microscope. The atrad54 T-DNA insertion line (Salk_038057) was found by searching the T-DNA express database (http://signal.salk.edu) established by the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (CITATION). Plant genotypes of SALK_038057 for the atrad54 mutation were established by PCR. Polymerase chain reaction for genotyping was performed with the KOD dash DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The wild-type AtRAD54 locus was identified by PCR with primers, 16ex-F (5′-CTGCTAGAGTTTGGAGGGATGGGCAA-3′) and 21ex-R (5′-CCACCGTTTTTGGACTGACATTTGATTCG-3′). The mutant locus was identified by PCR with LBa-1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) and 21ex-R. The left and right sides of the T-DNA border sequences were amplified with primers 16ex-F and LB-a1 and primers 21ex-R and LB-a1, respectively (Figure 1a). The PCR products were determined by direct sequencing. For assay of sensitivity to γ-irradiation, seeds were imbibed by soaking in water for 4 days at 4°C. Imbibed seeds were irradiated and immediately plated on MS agar medium. Plants were scored at 9, 14 and 21 days post-irradiation for formation of true leaves. To study the effect of cross-linking reagents on Arabidopsis plants, we used cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). To assay cisplatin sensitivity, imbibed seeds were prepared in a manner similar to that used in the γ-irradiation experiment, and imbibed seeds were plated on MS agar medium containing appropriate concentrations of cisplatin. Plants were scored for production of true leaves at 9, 14 and 21 days after plating on MS agar plates. The GUS recombination reporter lines 1415, 1445 (intrachromosomal, inverted-repeat recombination reporter line) and IC9 (interchromosomal recombination reporter line) were crossed with atrad54-1 plants. F3 seeds from plants homozygous for the GUS recombination reporter and homozygous for the mutant atrad54-1 allele were used for this assay. The aerial part from individual 3-week-old plants was incubated at 37°C for 48 h in GUS staining buffer [100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.4 mg ml−1 X-gluc, 0.25 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.25 mm potassium ferrocyanide and 0.1% Triton X-100]. The number of blue spots, each resulting from a recombination event, on each plant was determined visually under a dissecting microscope. For the DNA damage-induced recombination assay, 16-day-old plants were transferred onto MS agar medium containing 5 μm cisplatin for 5 days or irradiated with 50 Gy of γ-rays (a dose rate of 720 Gy h−1), followed by a 5-day incubation, and used for GUS histochemical staining. To produce Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtRAD54, the binary vector pBKAt54 containing CaMV 35S promoter plus the entire coding sequence of the AtRAD54 cDNA plus the Tnos terminator cassette in Bin19 was constructed (Figure 8a). pBKAt54 was introduced into A. tumefaciens strain EHA105, and the resultant strain was used to transform the GUS recombination reporter line 1445 as described above. Primary transformants were screened on MS medium solidified with 0.8% agar containing 25 mg l−1 kanamycin. The accession number for AtRAD54 is AB250666.
