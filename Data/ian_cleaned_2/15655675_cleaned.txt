!~ABS~! UDP-xylose (UDP-Xyl) is a sugar donor for the synthesis of glycoproteins, polysaccharides, various metabolites, and oligosaccharides in plants, vertebrates, and fungi. In plants, the biosynthesis of UDP-Xyl from UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) appears to be catalyzed by numerous UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (Uxs) isoforms. For example, six Uxs isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) and four in rice have been identified. However, the reason/s for the existence of several isoforms that are necessary for the synthesis of UDP-Xyl remains unknown. Here, we describe a Uxs isoform in Arabidopsis, AtUXS2, encoding an integral membrane protein that appears to be localized to the Golgi apparatus. The enzyme is a dimer and has distinct properties. Unlike the UXS3 isoform, which is shown here to be a soluble protein, the UXS2 isoform is membrane bound. The characteristics of the membrane-bound AtUxs2 and cytosolic AtUxs3 support the hypothesis that unique UDP-GlcA-DCs possessing distinct sub-cellular localizations can spatially regulate specific xylosylation events in plant cells.
!~RES~! Recombinant AtUxs2 (lacking the predicted cytosolic and putative trans-membrane domains spanning from aa 1–64) was expressed and purified from E. coli (Fig. 1a). The recombinant truncated form of AtUxs2 readily converted UDP-GlcA to a new product that migrated on HPLC with a retention time the same as that of UDP-Xyl standard (Fig. 1b, panel 2 and 4). This product, which eluted with a retention time of 18 min, was collected and analyzed by proton 1H NMR spectroscopy (Table 1). The 1H NMR spectrum was identical to those reported for UDP-δ-D-Xyl generated by AtUxs2 enzyme and authentic UDP-Xyl (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION). These data provided conclusive biochemical evidence that AtUxs2 is an UDP-GlcA decarboxylase. [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] Biochemical analyses were performed to characterize the catalytic properties of the recombinant Arabidopsis AtUxs2. AtUxs2 did not require exogenous supply of metal ion for activity. Moreover, EDTA did not inhibit UDP-Xyl synthesis (Table 2). However, AtUxs2 activity was affected, to various extents, by the addition of cations and salts. For example, Mg2+ ions inhibited AtUxs2 activity by more than 50% while KCl and NaCl showed an inhibition of 20% (Table 2). Both DTT and GSH stimulated the activity of AtUxs2. Further enzyme inhibition studies were performed using various nucleotides, nucleotide sugars, and co-enzymes (Table 3). It was found that UTP, TTP, UDP, and TDP completely inhibited AtUxs2 activity while TMP enhanced activity (Table 3). Conversely, the UDP sugars, UDP-Gal and UDP-GalA, had a negligible effect on AtUxs2 activity (Table 3). In the presence of UDP-Xyl, the activity of AtUxs2 was reduced by 55% (Table 3). The ability of UDP-Xyl to inhibit the membrane-bound AtUxs2 isoform suggested that end-product inhibition could be a mechanism whereby the activity of AtUxs2 isoform is regulated in vivo. AtUxs2 is very specific for UDP-GlcA as substrate. None of the other nucleotide sugars tested (UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Man, GDP-Glc, or GDP-Man) were utilized as substrate by AtUxs2 (data not shown). Further, AtUxs2 did not convert UDP-GalA (the 4-epimer of UDP-GlcA) into a product, suggesting that AtUxs2 displays stereospecific recognition of the hydroxyl and hydrogen attached to C4 of GlcA.[[TABLE]][[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] NAD+ was shown to be involved in the catalytic conversion of UDP-GlcA to UDP-Xyl (Feingold and Avigad CITATION). Some UDP-GlcA decarboxylases are tightly bound to the cofactor NAD, whereas other decarboxylases require exogenous NAD for their activity (Ankel and Feingold CITATION, CITATION). Recombinant AtUxs2 did not require exogenous NAD+ for its activity. Previous studies have shown that NADH completely inactivates the Uxs derived from Cryptococcus neoformans (Bar-Peled et al. CITATION), presumably by replacing the NAD bound to the enzyme. The data from the present studies as depicted in Table 3 showed that NADH, or NADPH did not inhibit Arabidopsis AtUxs2 activity. These results suggested that the AtUxs2 tightly binds to NAD+. Initial kinetic studies indicated that the amount of UDP-Xyl formed from UDP-GlcA by AtUxs2 is linear for up to 40 min. Further kinetic studies performed for 25 min indicated that AtUxs2 has an apparent Km of 0.2 mM based on Hanes-Woolf (Fig. 2a) and Lineweaver-Burk (Fig. 2b) plots at UDP-GlcA concentrations ranging between 0.125 mM and 4 mM. Similar Km values (0.18, 0.24 mM) were reported in a few earlier studies for the wheat germ and pea isozymes (Hayashi et al. CITATION; John et al. CITATION). The predicted soluble Arabidopsis Uxs3 isoform, on the other hand, has an apparent Km of 0.51 mM (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  AtUxs2 had a broad pH range with activity observed between pH 4.5 and 9.5, and maximum activity was recorded at pH 7 (Fig. 3a). Approximately 30% of AtUxs2 residual activity was noted at pH 9.5 and a complete inactivation occurred at pH below 3.2. Previously, we showed that (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION) soluble AtUxs3 enzyme was active between 22°C and 42°C, with maximum activity observed at 30°C. Contrastingly, in the present study, the membrane-bound AtUxs2 isoform showed activity over a broad temperature range with the maximum activity observed at 50°C (Fig. 3b). [[FIGURE]]  The amino-acid composition of recombinant Arabidopsis Uxs2 (lacking the predicted cytosolic and putative trans-membrane domains spanning from aa 1–64) enzyme corresponded to a protein with a molecular weight of 42,500. To elucidate whether this recombinant AtUxs2 functions as a monomer, dimer, or other multisubunit forms, the enzyme was fractionated on a gel filtration column. The E. coli recombinant AtUxs2 activity was eluted from the Superdex-75 column with a size estimated to have a molecular mass of ~100 kDa relative to standards (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the recombinant AtUxs2 is active as a dimer. [[FIGURE]]  To determine if AtUxs2 is membrane-associated or a soluble protein, and if the N-terminal extension of AtUxs2 (aa 1–122) contains a signal for membrane localization, truncated and full-length Uxs2-GFP fusion constructs were expressed in plants. These constructs were designed to express two chimeric proteins abbreviated as Uxs21–122-GFP, and a full-length Uxs2-GFP. Both gene constructs were cloned in to a binary vector system in order to facilitate Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of N. benthamiana leaves. Soluble and membrane fractions were isolated from leaves expressing Uxs21–122-GFP, full-length Uxs2-GFP, and GFP alone. Western blot analyses showed that polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal region of Uxs2 (aa 1-27) cross-reacted with Uxs21–122-GFP and full-length Uxs2-GFP in total microsomal fraction (P125) (Fig. 5a). No cross-reaction was observed in soluble fraction (S125) (Fig. 5a). Uxs21–122-GFP fractionated to the same membrane fraction as the full-length Uxs2-GFP (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the N-terminal region of Uxs2 is sufficient for sub-cellular targeting. [[FIGURE]]  The above studies demonstrated that AtUxs2 is associated with the membranes. To determine if AtUxs2 is an integral membrane protein, various conditions and treatments to extract AtUxs2 from the membrane pellet were examined. Equivalent amounts of membrane were resuspended in an extraction buffer alone (Fig. 6a), or in buffers containing one of the following additives: the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (1%, v/v), the ionic detergent sarkosyl (1%, w/v), 2 M urea, or 1 M NaCl. Membranes were also treated with 0.1 M sodium carbonate. After incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged at 125,000 g and the presence of Uxs21–122–GFP and full-length Uxs2-GFP in the resulting supernatants was detected by Western blot analyses. Treatments which are known to be effective in removing proteins that are peripherally associated with membranes (urea, salt, and alkaline conditions) (Ahmed et al. CITATION; Bar-Peled and Raikhel CITATION) were not effective in stripping either Uxs21–122-GFP or full-length Uxs2-GFP proteins from the membranes (Fig. 6). Only nonionic and ionic detergents were able to extract AtUxs2 from the membrane (Fig. 6a, b). These biochemical analyses confirmed that AtUxs2 is an integral membrane protein. [[FIGURE]]  Confocal microscopy was used to determine the sub-cellular localization of AtUxs2. Transformed N. benthamiana leaves expressing Uxs21–122-GFP, full-length Uxs2-GFP, and controls [Golgi markers AtSed5-GFP and AtRer1B-GFP (Takeuchi et al. CITATION), the predicted soluble AtUxs3 isoform (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION) fused to GFP and GFP alone] were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Other constructs were also developed in order to conduct dual labeling experiments using the Uxs21–122, full-length Uxs2 and Golgi markers (AtSed5 and AtRer1B). Unfortunately, due to reasons unknown, the expression and the confocal signals observed for the dual labeling gene fusion products in plants were too weak (data not shown). Figure 7 shows leaf cells expressing GFP alone and Uxs3-GFP. Both were highly expressed and had the same pattern of cytosolic distribution. This data confirmed our earlier biochemical data (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION; K. Herrick, S. Pattathil and M. Bar-Peled, unpublished results) that AtUxs3 is indeed a cytosolic and soluble protein. In contrast, the distribution and fluorescence pattern observed in the leaf cells expressing membrane-bound Uxs21–122-GFP, full-length Uxs2-GFP, and the known Golgi markers, AtSed5-GFP and AtRer1B-GFP, appeared similar but different from that observed in leaf cells expressing GFP alone or soluble Uxs3-GFP (Fig. 8). The punctuate fluorescence pattern observed in mature leaf cells (Fig. 8) or in younger, not fully expanded cells (Fig. 9) expressing Uxs21–122-GFP, full-length Uxs2-GFP membrane-bound proteins, AtSed5-GFP, and AtRer1B-GFP implies that AtUxs2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus. Together, the results obtained indicate that AtUxs2 is an integral membrane protein and that the N-terminal extension of AtUxs2 is sufficient for its sub-cellular localization.

!~MM~! pGex5x1:63/71 no TM vector was created by a three-way ligation and consists of Uxs2 (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION) aa 1–27 fused to aa 72–445 (1–27∧72–445). A four-way ligation consisted of: (1) two annealed phosphorylated overlapping oligo set: S#1:5′-CATGGTTCACGGTGACTCGTCCGATGCGTTACATGCTCCA; S#2:5′-TATGATCATGACCGGTTCCACACAATCAACCCCTTACTCG; AS#1:5′-CATATGGAGCATGTAACGCATCGGACGAGTCACCGTGAAC; AS#2:5′-GATCCGAGTAAGGGGTTGATTGTGTGGAACCGGTCATGAT, having BamHI, and NcoI ‘sticky ends’; (2) a BamH I-NotI 1,126-bp fragment from pGEX5x1:63/71no TM; and (3) a NcoI-BamHI 5,046-bp fragment from pGEX5x1:63/71 noTM was used to generate pGEX5x1:63/71oligo#6. The latter vector consisted of GST-fused inframe to aa 1–44 of Uxs2, a short linker (comprising BspHI, NdeI, and AgeI restriction sites), and aa 64–445 of Uxs2 (1–44∧64–445). pGex5X1:63/71oligoNde vector which consisted of GST-fused inframe to Uxs2 aa 64–445 was generated by digesting pGEX5x1:63/71oligo#6 with NdeI. To construct pET28a:71oligoNde, the NdeI–NotI DNA fragment (1,167 bp) corresponding to Uxs2 aa (64–445) isolated from pGEX5x1:63/71oligo#6 was cloned into NdeI, NotI sites in pET28a, forming a 6His-T7-tag-fused to aa 64–445 of Uxs2. pGEX5x1:71Var1 vector which consisted of GST fused inframe to aa 1–27 of Uxs2 was constructed by first releasing the NcoI-HindIII DNA fragment from pGEXkg:71, followed by Klenow fill in reaction and religation. To construct pCam35tl:egfps2#4, the PstI-NcoI 895-bp DNA fragment consists of 35S promoter region from pRTL2 (Restrepo et al. CITATION), a 60-bp NcoI-BspHI linker 5′-CCATGGTACCAGGCCTTGTTAACATGTCGACACGTGGATCCGGCGCGGCCGCAGGCATGG), a 796-bp NcoI-StuI from peGFP (Clontech), and a 8,998-bp PstI–PmlI DNA isolated from pCambia 1302-S1#1 were used. A BspHI-KpnI polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified region corresponding to aa 1–122 of UXS2 and full-length UXS2 (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION) was ligated into the same restriction sites of pCam35tl:eGFPs2#4 to generate pCam35tl:77-1-eGFPs2#1and pCam35tl:77eGFPs2#1, respectively, resulting in an in-frame fusion of aa 1–122 of UXS2 and full-length UXS2 to GFP. For protein expression, 20 ml of an overnight culture of Escherichia coli strain carrying the various pGEX:Uxs2, pET:Uxs2, or vector controls, pET28 (Novagen), or pGEX5x1 (Pharmacia), were used to inoculate 130 ml LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin (or 100 μg/ml ampicillin) and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were grown at 37°C while shaking (250 rpm) until a cell density of A600 =~0.6 was reached. To induce protein expression, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.15 mM, and cells continued to grow while shaking (250 rpm) for ~21 h at ~18°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (6,000 g, at 4°C for 10 min), washed with cold water, and kept at −80°C until extraction. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with fresh 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF, and lysed by ten sonication intervals (10-s pulse followed by 20-s rest) on ice, using a microtip probe and a Fisher 550 sonicator set at a power of 4.5. The suspension was incubated with slow rotation in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 ~60 min at 4°C. The homogenate was then centrifuged (3,000 g, ~10 min, 4°C) and the supernatant was collected and re-centrifuged (20,000 g, ~20 min, 4°C). The histidine-tagged protein sample was loaded onto a Sepharose CL-6B-nickel column [2 ml resin volume (NTA-Ni, Qiagen) packed in a 0.6 cm (i.d) × 5 cm polypropylene column (BioRad)] that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl, pH 8). The recombinant 6His-protein was purified as described (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION) and stored at −20°C until analysis. The GST-tagged protein sample was loaded onto a Sepharose CL- 4B-glutathione column [2 ml resin volume (Amersham) packed in a 0.6 cm (i.d) × 5 cm polypropylene column (BioRad)] that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A1 (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7,4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The recombinant GST protein was purified as described (Bar-Peled and Raikhel CITATION) and stored at −20°C until analysis. To confirm the identity of the recombinant protein, an aliquot was loaded onto MALDI Q-TOF to verify molecular mass, and an additional aliquot was digested with trypsin (Promega). The mass spectrometry of the tryptic peptide fragments and aa sequences were determined by MS-MS, as described (Bar-Peled et al. CITATION). To estimate the relative molecular mass of Uxs2, analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed at room temperature on a Superdex 75 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), using buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The SEC column was calibrated with globular protein standards: alcohol dehydrogenase 150,000, bovine serum albumin 66,000, and carbonic anhydrase 29,000 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The relationship between molecular mass and retention time was established by linear regression. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were separated by 0.1% SDS–12% PAGE as previously described (Bar-Peled et al. CITATION), alongside pre-stained or low MW markers (BioRad) and visualized by staining with Brilliant Blue Coomassie R-250 Stain (Sigma). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the first 27 aa of Uxs2 by injecting ~200 μg of GST-Uxs2 (1–27 aa) emulsified with Freund’s complete adjuvant to a rabbit hosted in the UGA animal facility. The rabbit was boosted two more times each with ~150 μg of GST-Uxs2 (1-27 aa) emulsified with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, according to the service provider protocol. Western blots (Bar-Peled and Raikhel CITATION) were used to assess the titer and specificity of antibodies. UDP-GlcA decarboxylase enzyme assays were essentially done as described (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION). The typical 50-μl reaction consisted of 50 mM HEPES–NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 2 mg/ml protein, with or without 1 mM β-NAD+. After a 30-min incubation at 30 or 50°C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl chloroform. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase was retained, and the organic phase extracted with 80 μl water. The aqueous phases were combined and injected onto an anion exchange HPLC column [Phenosphere-SAX column (250×4.6 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) or a Source-Q15 (Amersham, packed into a stainless steel column, 250×4.6 mm)] and eluted at 1 ml min−1 with a linear 2–600 mM ammonium-formate gradient formed over 25 min (Harper and Bar-Peled CITATION). Nucleotides and nucleotide sugars were detected by UV absorbance using a Waters photodiode array detector. The δmax for thymidine, uridine, guanosine, adenosine, and cytosine was 267, 261.8, 259.4, 253.5, and 271.2 nm, respectively. The columns were calibrated with authentic nucleotide sugars (Sigma). The following constructs were used to generate plants over expressing the chimeric GFP protein: pCam35tl:77eGFPs2 (= Uxs2-GFP), pCam35tl:77-1-eGFPs2 (= Uxs2(1-122)-GFP), pCam35tl:107eGFPs2 (= Uxs3-GFP), control pCam35tl:eGFPs2 (GFP), Golgi markers AtSed5-GFP and AtRer1b-GFP (Takeuchi et al. CITATION), along with pCam35tl:HC/pro (Johansen and Carrington CITATION). The constructs were transformed individually to Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101/pM90 strain. Colonies selected on YEP agar containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml rifampicin, and 25 μg/ml gentamycin were used to inoculate a 4-ml starter culture grown at 27°C for 2 days. Transformation of the fully expanded leaf of Nicotiana benthamiana plants (~ 4-week-old seedlings grown at 22°C) was done as described by Johansen and Carrington (CITATION). Three or four days post infection, the injected area (~ 2.5 cm radius) was cut, and proteins were extracted and processed as described below. The leaf sample (1 g) was powdered while frozen with a mortar and pestle and 3 ml of cold extraction buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA–NaOH, 400 mM sucrose) was added for homogenization. Total crude homogenate (supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 0.1 M PMSF) was centrifuged (1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C) and the top 2.5 ml of supernatant was spun at 125, 000 g for 60 min. The supernatant (termed S125) was collected and the pellet (termed P125) was washed and then re-suspended with a buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sarkosyl. Samples were fractionated by SDS–PAGE and subsequently subjected to western blot analysis. To determine the association of AtUxs2 with membranes, total crude homogenate (supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 0.1 M PMSF) was centrifuged (1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C) and the top 2.5 ml of supernatant was spun for 60 min at 125,000 g, generating a total membrane pellet (termed P125) and a soluble protein fraction (termed S125). Each of the P125 pellets were washed briefly with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer and re-suspended with 0.1 ml extraction buffer containing either 1% Triton X-100, 1% sarkosyl, 2 M urea, 1 M NaCl, water, or re-suspended in 0.1 ml of 0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 11). After 30 min on ice, the solubilized P125 pellets were spun (125,000 g at 4°C for 15 min) to remove un-dissolved matter, and 20 μl of each of the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For Western blot analyses, proteins were separated on 0.1% SDS–12% PAGE, blotted onto 0.45 μm PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes using 10 mM Tris, 10 mM Gly, 0.05% SDS, and 10% methanol using a Hoffer wet blot apparatus at 25 V for 3 h. Following electroblotting, membranes were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau-S in 1% (v/v) acetic acid, washed with water, and treated overnight with blocking reagent [5% (w/v) dry milk in TBST (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20)]. Blots were reacted with rabbit anti GST-Uxs2:(1-27 aa) at 1:5,000 dilution in blocking reagent, washed with TBST, and reacted with goat-anti rabbit secondary antibodies linked to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilution. Immune complexes were detected by the alkaline phosphates color assay, after reacting blots for up to ~5 min with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) reagent as substrates (Sigma). Blots were washed with water and scanned. All confocal imaging studies were conducted at the Center for Ultrastructural Research, University of Georgia. The GFP fluorescence images were observed using a Confocal laser scanning microscope system [Leica TCS SP2 Spectral Confocal Microscope with Coherent Ti: sapphire multiphoton laser (Mira Optima 900-F)]. The images were analyzed by Leica software (Leica Microsystems Inc., Exton, PA). UV-absorbing peaks eluting from the SAX column were collected and lyophilized to remove the ammonium formate. The residues were dissolved in water, re-lyophilized twice, and then exchanged twice with 99.96% D2O. Proton NMR spectroscopy was performed at 25°C on a Varian Inova spectrometer operating at 600 MHz (Bar-Peled et al. CITATION). The chemical shifts are in parts per million and were normalized using acetone (2.224 ppm) as external standard.
