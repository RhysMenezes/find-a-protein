!~ABS~! Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to those plants that do not naturally accumulate glycine betaine (GB), although its genome contains two genes, ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 that code for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenases (BADHs). BADHs were initially known to catalyze the last step of the biosynthesis of GB in plants. But they can also oxidize metabolism-derived aminoaldehydes to their corresponding amino acids in some cases. This study was carried out to investigate the functional properties of Arabidopsis BADH genes. Here, we have shown that ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 proteins are targeted to leucoplasts and peroxisomes, respectively. The expression patterns of ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 genes have been analysed under abiotic stress conditions. Both genes are expressed in the plant and weakly induced by ABA, salt, chilling (4°C), methyl viologen and dehydration. The role of the ALDH10A8 gene was analysed using T-DNA insertion mutants. There was no phenotypic difference between wild-type and mutant plants in the absence of stress. But ALDH10A8 seedlings and 4-week-old plants were more sensitive to dehydration and salt stress than wild-type plants. The recombinant ALDH10A9 enzyme was shown to oxidize betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde and 3-aminopropionaldehyde to their corresponding carboxylic acids. We hypothesize that ALDH10A8 or ALDH10A9 may serve as detoxification enzymes controlling the level of aminoaldehydes, which are produced in cellular metabolism under stress conditions.
!~RES~! ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 transcript accumulation was analysed in A. thaliana (Col-0) wild-type plants. Four-week-old plants were removed from the soil and incubated in water supplemented with 100 μM ABA, 200 mM NaCl or 10 μM methyl viologen for 72 h. Alternatively, they were kept in water at 4°C for the chilling stress. RNA-blot analyses indicated that both the ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 transcripts did increase upon these treatments (Fig. 1a). Based on the expression pattern of the cold and dehydration responsive gene RD29A, it appeared that highest expression levels were obtained after 8 h of the treatments. With regards to this, the semi-quantitative analysis of the RNA-blot signals revealed that ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 are inducible by ABA, and to a lesser extent by NaCl, chilling and methyl viologen. As for the dehydration treatment, both genes showed increasing expression for 24 h, with ALDH10A8 having the higher level always (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that the ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 genes are stress-responsive. [[FIGURE]]  The protein sequence for ALDH10A8 does not contain an obvious sub-cellular localization signal. GFP fusion constructs were generated to study the cellular localization of the protein. Transgenic plants expressing the ALDH10A8-140 construct show green fluorescing organelles which appear often pairwise and possess cytoplasmic strands (Fig. 2a–c). Similar observations were made for Arabidopsis leaves transiently transformed by particle bombardment with the same construct. These organelles are smaller than the surrounding chloroplasts, suggesting a localization in leucoplasts. To ascertain this finding, Arabidopsis rosette leaves of wild-type plants were incubated with Lugol reagent for 5–10 min at 37°C. Microscopic observations of epidermis cells from Lugol-treated leaves under bright field showed starch-containing leucoplasts with an intense brown colour coinciding with the fluorescent signal surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 2j). Complementary experiments were carried out with two additional constructs: ALDH10A8-73 and ALDH10A8-501. When the first 67 N-terminal amino acids are deleted from ALDH10A8-140 (ALDH10A8-73), the green fluorescence was not observed anymore in the leucoplasts, but in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2d–f). Likewise, the GFP signal appeared in the cytoplasm for the ALDH10A8-501 construct, where the original N-terminal part of the gene was placed in the middle of the construct by engineering the GFP protein in front of the ALDH10A8 coding sequence (Table 1; Fig. 2g–i). These observations confirm the presence of a leucoplast targeting signal within the first 67 N-terminal amino acids of the ALDH10A8 protein. [[FIGURE]]  The ALDH10A9 protein is predicted to be localized to peroxisomes as it has the peroxisome targeting-signal SKL (Reumann CITATION). To verify the prediction, transgenic plants expressing the C-terminal of the ALDH10A9 protein fused to the GFP protein (ALDH10A9-180) were generated and analysed. Green fluorescence was detected only in vesicle structures of a size less than 1 μm (Fig. 2k–m). This observation indicates that ALDH10A9 with its C-terminal PTS1-signal SKL is effectively targeted to peroxisomes. Plant peroxisomes move along the actin filaments and cytoplasmic streaming and budding of peroxisomes depend on the integrity of the cytoskeleton (Jedd and Chua CITATION). Therefore, the peroxisomal localization of the ALDH10A9 protein was further confirmed by incubating leaves of transgenic plants with 5 μM cytochalasin B (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) that reversibly binds to actin and prevents the formation of actin monomers, breaking up the cytoskeleton (Bradley CITATION). Most of the green fluorescing cell organelles became static 1 h after cytochalasin B application. When the treated leaves were washed with water to release cytochalasin B, movement of the green fluorescing organelles along the actin filaments recovered gradually and 12 h after the release of cytochalasin B they moved as they were before the treatment. This suggests that the fluorescing organelles are peroxisomes and that ALDH10A9 proteins have a peroxisomal location, as previously indicated by peroxisome proteome analyses (Eubel et al. CITATION; Reumann et al. CITATION). To investigate the possible function of ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 genes T-DNA insertion mutants, SALK_079892, KO8-1, KO8-2, KO9 and SALK_066181, were obtained for the ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 genes. The line SALK_079892 (Alonso et al. CITATION) contains a T-DNA insertion within the 9th intron of ALDH10A8. The gene is still expressed in isolated homozygous plants of this line. The line was therefore not analysed further. Sequence analysis revealed that the KO8-1 mutant harbours a T-DNA insertion in the 3′UTR (3′ untranslated region; 10 nucleotides after the stop codon TAA in the 15th exon), whereas the KO9 mutants contained a T-DNA insertion 162 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation start codon (Fig. 3a). Homozygous mutant plants were isolated (Fig. 3b) and analysed for the expression of both ALDH genes by RT-PCR. The ALDH10A8 transcript is absent in KO8-1 plants as compared to the wild type (Fig. 3c). But we found that the T-DNA insertion in that line also disrupted the expression of the adjacent gene AT1G74910 (data not shown). Therefore, the line KO8-2, an allelic T-DNA insertion mutant of KO8-1 was obtained from the Saskatoon Arabidopsis T-DNA collection and investigated. This mutant represents a single knockout of the ALDH10A8 gene (Fig. 3d). The analysis of the segregation ratio of the herbicide glufosinate ammonium resistance in KO8-2 seedlings was performed as described by Robinson et al. (CITATION). It revealed that the line contains a single T-DNA insertion. As for the KO9 line, the ALDH10A9 transcripts are still present in the plants, indicating that the expression is not affected by the T-DNA insertion. Another T-DNA insertion line (SALK_066181; Alonso et al. CITATION) with the T-DNA fragment inserted in the 10th intron of ALDH10A9 was also screened, but again the gene was still expressed (data not shown). No other knockout line was available for ALDH10A9. Therefore, subsequent experiments were only performed with KO8-2 plants. [[FIGURE]]  The susceptibility of ALDH10A8 knockout plants to abiotic stress was investigated in seedlings and adult plants. Seeds were first germinated and grown in vitro on MS-medium supplemented with 100 mM NaCl or 200 mM mannitol. As shown in Fig. 4, KO8-2 seedlings showed more chlorosis together with high accumulation of anthocyanins on salt or mannitol-containing medium. [[FIGURE]]  Under stress conditions plant membrane lipids are oxidized, which often leads to the accumulation of the toxic compound malondialdehyde (MDA) (Sunkar et al. CITATION; Kotchoni et al. CITATION). Consistent with the visual observations, there was no difference in MDA contents of WT and KO8-2 seedlings under control conditions. However, KO8-2 plants accumulated more MDA than WT when grown on MS medium supplemented with 100 mM NaCl (Fig. 5a). Likewise, the MDA content was higher in mutants than in wild-type when seedlings were grown on MS agar supplemented with 200 mM mannitol (Fig. 5b). [[FIGURE]]  To analyse the salt and drought response in adult plants seedlings were transferred to soil and allowed to grow in pots for 2 weeks. The pots were watered every 2 days with water or with water containing 300 mM NaCl for 10 days. Alternatively, drought stress was imposed by withdrawing water for 10 days. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, adult KO8-2 plants accumulated higher MDA levels than WT upon salt and drought stress. The MDA contents were similar in regularly watered WT and KO8-2 mutants. [[FIGURE]]  Like glycine betaine, proline is a compatible solute that accumulates in plants under stress conditions. Free proline content was quantified from the mutants and the WT under control and stress conditions. No significant difference was observed in the free proline contents of the WT and KO8-2 plants (Fig. 6c). Altogether, the results show that the disruption of the ALDH10A8 gene expression has negatively affected the sensitivity of plants to salt and dehydration stress. To examine the function of the Arabidopsis BADH coding genes the cDNA fragments of ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 were cloned in the pET-28a (+) expression vector. The recombinant BADH proteins were over-expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified from the soluble protein fraction by His-tag affinity chromatography. As shown in the supplementary Fig. 1, only small amounts of the recombinant ALDH10A8 were purified under native conditions, but sufficient amounts of purified ALDH10A9 protein were obtained and used for enzymatic activity assays. The ALDH10A9 recombinant protein converted betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde (ABAL) and 3-aminopropylaldehyde (APAL) to glycine betaine, GABA and 3-aminopropanoic acid, respectively. With NAD as cofactor the enzyme displayed a Km of 1.1 mM for betaine aldehyde, 6.81 mM for ABAL and 3.7 mM for APAL (Table 2). Like previously identified BADHs (Livingstone et al. CITATION; Bradbury et al. CITATION; Fujiwara et al. CITATION), the ALDH10A9 exhibited both betaine aldehyde and aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase activities and could be actively expressed in E. coli. Over-expression of either ALDH10A9 or ALDH10A8 in E. coli did not render the bacteria more tolerant to sodium chloride or H2O2 than cells transformed with the vector only (suppl. Fig. 2).[[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) was used throughout this work. Wild-type (WT) and transgenic seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar plates (Murashige and Skoog CITATION) or soil. Plants were allowed to grow under white light of approximately 120–150 μE m−2 s−1 with a 16-h photoperiod at 22°C, if not stated otherwise. For gene expression analyses, 4-week-old Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0) plants were removed from the soil and dehydrated at RT or incubated for different periods in water (untreated) or water containing 100 μM ABA, 10 μM methyl viologen or 200 mM NaCl. The up-rooted plants were kept in water at 4°C for chilling stress. Seedlings were either used directly from MS agar plates or transferred to plastic pots containing a 3:1 mixture of potting soil and vermiculite. For in vitro experiments seedlings were exposed to the indicated concentrations of either NaCl or mannitol added to the agar medium. Alternatively, seedlings transferred to the soil were allowed to grow for another 2 weeks before stress treatments. Soil-grown plants were irrigated in 2-day intervals for 10 days with either 300 mM NaCl or water as control. For drought stress 4-week-old and soil-grown plants were kept without further watering for 10 days, reaching a relative water content of about 45%. The relative water content was estimated as described by Bartels et al. (CITATION). The T-DNA insertion line GK_175D06 (hereafter renamed KO8-1) for the ALDH10A8 gene was identified in the GABI-Kat collection (Rosso et al. CITATION). Seeds were obtained from Dr. B. Weisshaar (MPI for Plant Breeding Research; Cologne, Germany). The line SK24056, hereafter renamed KO8-2, is an allelic mutant of ALDH10A8 and was identified in the Saskatoon Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant population (SK collection; Robinson et al. CITATION). Seeds were obtained from Dr I. Parkin (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon Research Centre). A T-DNA insertion line in ALDH10A9 was identified in the SAIL collection (SAIL_502_G10; hereafter renamed KO9) and obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (N821090; http://nasc.nott.ac.uk). Individual homozygous T-DNA insertion plants were isolated by PCR genotyping using a combination of the gene-specific primers and T-DNA-specific primers. The gene-specific primers were: AY093071_RT_fwd 5′-GATCTTGCATGGTGGTTCCCGA-3′ and AY093071_ RT_rev 5′-AAGCACAAAGATTTGAACAGACAGC-3′ for ALDH10A8; KO10A9_fwd 5′-ATTGTTCCGTGGAAATGGGGTGA-3′ and KO10A9_rev 5′-TTGGGACTTTCCGTTTTGGT-3′ for ALDH10A9. T-DNA-specific primers were: Gabi_10A8_rev 5′-GTTTCCGAGATGGTGATTGC-3′ for the line GABI-Kat_175D06, pSKTAIL-L3 5′-ATA CGA CGG ATC GTA ATT TGT CG-3′ for the line SK24056 and Sail_10A9_rev 5′-CTGGCAAGTGTAGCGGTCAC-3′ for the line SAIL_502_G10. Homozygous KO8-1, KO8-2 and KO9 mutants were further analysed by RT-PCR for checking ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 transcripts. The GFP expression vector pGJ280 was constructed by Dr G. Jach (MPI, Cologne, Germany); it contains in the following order the CaMV 35S promoter with a duplicated transcriptional enhancer, the tobacco etch virus translational enhancer, the GFP open reading frame (Tsien CITATION) and the CaMV 35S polyadenylation site (Reichel et al. CITATION). Table 1 lists all GFP fusion constructs generated in the work described here. Two GFP fusion constructs were made in pGJ280 for the ALDH10A8 cDNA (accession no. AY093071): (1) the first 420 nucleotides (amino acids +1 to +140) were fused in frame to the GFP via engineered NcoI sites to generate the ALDH10A8-140-GFP expression construct; (2) the cDNA fragment coding for the amino acids +68 to +140 was fused to GFP to yield the construct ALDH10A8-73-GFP, which lacks the first 67 amino acids, as compared to ALDH10A8-140. In addition, the full-length protein coding sequence was subcloned downstream of the GFP in the pPG-Tkan vector via engineered BamHI sites to yield the GFP-ALDH10A8-501 construct. The vector pPG-Tkan is derived from the binary vector pPTkan3 (constructed by Dr. G. Pilot, University of Bonn) and contains the 35S promoter upstream to the coding sequence of GFP without a stop codon. ALDH10A8-140 and ALDH10A8-73 are N-terminal ALDH-GFP fusion constructs, whereas in ALDH10A8-501 the GFP is N-terminal and the ALDH is downstream of the GFP. The expression cassette in ALDH10A8-140 was subcloned into the HindIII site of pBIN19 (Bevan CITATION) for stable transformation in planta. The pPG-Tkan vector was also used for the construction of the ALDH10A9-GFP fusion. A 540-bp C-terminal fragment (amino acids +324 to +503) of the ALDH10A9 cDNA (accession no. AF370333) was fused in frame downstream of the GFP via engineered BamHI sites to generate the pPG-Tkan35Sprom::eGFP-ALDH10A9Cterm-rbcsterm expression construct (ALDH10A9-180). All constructs were used to transiently transform Arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment. Coating of gold particles with DNA was performed according to Sandford et al. (CITATION). The bombardment procedure used the Biolistic® Particle Delivery System-1000/He device according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). The upper surface of well-expanded Arabidopsis leaves was hit with a pressure of 1,150 psi at a distance of 6 cm with a sub-pressure of 27 mm Hg. The constructs in binary vectors were then stably integrated into the A. thaliana (Col-0) genome using Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3103 via the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION).[[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (ZE2000, Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany). The excitation wavelength of the argon laser (D-eclipse C1, Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany) was 488 nm and the fluorescence light was detected between 515 and 530 nm. Auto-fluorescence of chlorophyll was activated by a He/Ne laser at 534 nm and visualized at 570 nm. Total RNA was isolated from about 100 mg Arabidopsis seedlings or leaves. Briefly, the plant tissues were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen with metal beads, then resuspended in 500 μl extraction buffer (6 M urea, 3 M LiCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and one volume of phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added. The suspension was thoroughly mixed and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm, 4°C. The aqueous phase was successively re-extracted with one volume of phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol and chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (24:1). RNAs were precipitated from the supernatant by adding 0.1 volume of 3 M Na-acetate, pH 5.2 and 0.7 volume of isopropanol. The precipitate was kept on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with 70% (v/v) ethanol, dried and dissolved in sterile water. The RNA-blot analyses were performed with 20 μg total RNA according to Bartels et al. (CITATION) and the membranes were hybridized with 32P-labelled probes. The labelling was done with the DecaLabel DNA Labelling Kit from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Probes for ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 were generated by PCR from the cDNA clones, pda07810 (RAFL07-07-L09) and pda01165, (RAFL05-07-N03) (RIKEN Bio-Resource Center, Experimental Plant Division, Arabidopsis full-length cDNA collection), respectively (Seki et al. CITATION). The following primers were used: AY093071_RT_fwd 5′-GATCTTGCATGGTGGTTCCCGA-3′ and AY093071_RT_rev 5′-AAGCACAAAGATTTGAACAGACAGC-3′ for ALDH10A8; AF370333_RT_fwd 5′-TGTTCTTTGTGGAGGAGTTCGTC-3′ and AF370333_RT_rev 5′-GAAGGGTCTCTTGCTTTATTGGT-3′ for ALDH10A9. To monitor the stress treatment, membranes were re-probed with an EcoRI cDNA fragment of the stress-responsive Ath-RD29A gene (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki CITATION). Additionally, a cDNA fragment of the Ath-ACTIN2 gene (An et al. CITATION) generated by PCR was used to monitor equal loading of RNA samples. The signal intensities of the RNA-blots were quantified using ImageQuant version 5.2 software. The signal intensity value for each sample and for a specific gene was divided by that of the ACTIN-2 gene for the same sample. The resulting ratios for each sample were transferred to Microsoft Excel and plotted versus the time. For RT-PCR analysis 4 μg of total RNA was treated with 10 U RNase-free DNase I (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in 10 μl of 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2 at 37°C for 10 min. 1 μl of 25 mM EDTA was added and the reaction was heated at 65°C for 15 min to deactivate the DNase I. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Totalscript-OLS® Kit with the protocol provided with the Kit. Gene-specific cDNAs were amplified using AY093071_RT_fwd and AY093071_RT_rev for ALDH10A8; AF370333_RT_fwd and AF370333_RT_rev for ALDH10A9 and Ath_Actin 2_fwd (mitte) 5′-GGAATCCACGAGACAACCTATAAC-3′ and Ath_Actin 2_rev 5′-AGGAATCGTTCACAGAAAATGTTTC-3′ for Ath-ACTIN2. The parameters of the PCR programme were as follows: 5 min 94°C; 30 cycles (30 s 94°C, 45 s 62°C and 90 s 72°C); 5 min 72°C and pause at 4°C. An ALDH10A8 cDNA fragment was generated by PCR from the clone pda07810 (RAFL07-07-L09) (RIKEN Institute) with the following primers (restriction sites are italicized): AY093071_BamHI_Fwd, 5′-ACGGCGAATGGAGAGGATCCATCTT-3′; AY093071_SacI_rev, 5′-GAGATTTGTACGAGCTCCAGGGAT-3′. Then, the BamHI/SacI cDNA fragment (+56 to +1,618; 478 aa) was subcloned into the BamHI/SacI sites of the pET28a-expression vector (Novagen, Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA) yielding a fusion protein of 526 aa with both N-terminal and C-terminal His-tags (6 × His). For ALDH10A9, a cDNA fragment was amplified from the clone pda01165 (RAFL05-07-N03) (RIKEN Institute) with the following primers (restriction sites are italicized): AF370333_NdeI_Fwd, 5′-GAGAGAGAGAGAGCATATGGCGAT-3′; AF370333_EcoRI_rev, 5′-CTCAGAGCTTGGAATTCGGTTTGT-3′. The resulting NdeI/EcoRI fragment (+1 to +1,553; 498 aa) was subcloned into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of the pET28a-expression vector, also yielding a fusion protein of 538 aa with both N-terminal and C-terminal His-tags (6 × His). The DNA sequences of the pET-ALDH10A8 (pET-10A8) and pET-ALDH10A9 (pET-10A9) plasmids were verified and separately introduced into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The expression of the recombinant proteins was induced at 22°C by adding IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) to a final concentration of 1 mM, if not otherwise stated. The proteins were thereafter purified from the soluble fraction using a His-tag affinity column (Kirch et al. CITATION). Enzymatic activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by monitoring the conversion of NAD+ to NADH at room temperature in 0.5 ml total volume. The assay buffer contained 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate pH 8.0, 1.5 mM NAD (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and variable amounts of betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde and 3-aminopropionaldehyde. Betaine aldehyde chloride was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and directly used in the enzymatic assay. 4-Aminobutyraldehyde was prepared from its diethyl acetal (Sigma–Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and 3-aminopropionaldehyde from 1-amino-3,3-diethoxypropane (Alfa Aesar®, Karlsruhe, Germany). The acetals were hydrolyzed at 100°C in 0.1 M HCl in a plugged test tube for 10 min. The kinetic parameters were determined according to Kirch et al. (CITATION). For stress experiments, transformed E. coli BL21 cells were cultured in 10 ml LB medium containing 50 mg/l kanamycin for 12 h at 37°C. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced in liquid medium by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mM to bacterial cultures at log phase (OD600 = 0.3). The bacteria were further incubated at 21°C for 1 h and H2O2 and NaCl were then added as stressors to a final concentration of 1 mM or 500 mM, respectively. Cell density was measured as OD600 at different time-points. The relative cell growth was calculated as the ratio of the OD600 in the presence of IPTG + (NaCl or H2O2) to the OD600 in presence of IPTG alone. Each experiment was performed at least in three independent replicates. The levels of lipid peroxidation in plant cells were assayed with the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test, which determines the amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) as end product of lipid peroxidation (Hodges et al. CITATION; Kotchoni et al. CITATION). Free proline was determined according to the method of Bates et al. (CITATION). Approximately, 100 mg plant material was ground in liquid N2 with metal beads and homogenized in 2 ml of 3% (v/v) sulphosalicylic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. 1 ml of ninhydrin acid and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid were successively added to 1 ml of the supernatant or standard l-proline solution. The mixture was boiled for 60 min and extracted with 2 ml of toluene. Free proline was spectrophotometrically quantified from the organic phase at 520 nm and using a standard curve obtained from various concentrations of l-proline.
