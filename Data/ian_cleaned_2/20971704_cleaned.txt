!~ABS~! Internalization and sorting of macromolecules are inherent properties of all eukaryotic cells that are achieved by vesicle trafficking. However, this process is relatively less understood in plants. An eight-subunit protein complex, BLOC-1, which is involved in endosomal transport from the endosomes to the lysosomes, has been identified in both human and mice. In this study, two homologous subunits of this complex, BLOS1 (or AtGCN5L1) and BLOS2, have been characterized in Arabidopsis. Both BLOS1 and BLOS2 interacted with SNX1 on the sorting endosomes. Inducible RNAi lines with reduced levels of BLOS1 had longer primary roots and more lateral roots. Consistently, PIN1 and PIN2 were increased in BLOS1 RNAi lines, implicating an impaired transport from the endosomes to the vacuoles. These results suggest that a putative BLOC-1 complex in Arabidopsis might mediate the vacuolar degradative transport through direct interaction with SNX1 to regulate the homeostasis of PIN1 and PIN2, which is important for plant growth and development.
!~RES~! Multiple protein sequences from different species were aligned using the ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/) and GeneDoc (http://www.nrbsc.org/downloads/) (supplementary material Fig. S1). The percentage of identity between the Arabidopsis and human proteins was calculated using the BLASTP algorithm (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The calculated sequence identities to human homologs for BLOS1 (At2g30330) and BLOS2 (At5g49550) were 36% and 29%, respectively. Interaction between BLOS2 and BLOS1 was revealed by yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1A) and split-YFP assays (Fig. 1B). Next, our work is mainly focused on the functional studies of BLOS1. Tissue-specific expression of BLOS1 was tested by real-time PCR with RNA extracted from adult plants. BLOS1 expression was found in all major tested organs including the root, stem, leaf, flower and silique, with highest expression in the leaf (Fig. 1C). Western blotting by a polyclonal anti-BLOS1 antibody was consistent with these findings (Fig. 1D). Tissue-specific expression of BLOS1 promoter activity was further analyzed by histochemical localization of GUS activity. In 5-day-old germinating seedlings, GUS expression was detected in the vascular tissues (Fig. 2A), shoot apical meristem (Fig. 2B) and primary root (Fig. 2C). At 9 days, GUS expression was clearly detectable in the adventitious root (Fig. 2D) and the lateral root primordia (Fig. 2E). GUS activity in up to 4-week-old transgenic BLOS1 pro::GUS seedlings showed expression in the flowers, anthers and silique (Fig. 2F–H). To study the subcellular localization of BLOS1, a protoplast system was adopted. Sixteen hours after cotransformation with different organellar markers, confocal images showed that BLOS1 partially colocalized with endosome markers ARA7 (Fig. 3A) and VAMP727 (Fig. 3B), PVC and vacuole markers PEP72 (Fig. 3C) and VAM3 (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that BLOS1 is probably localized at the endosomal compartments. [[FIGURE]] Histochemical GUS staining suggested that BLOS1 might play a role in root development. As there is no T-DNA exonal insertion line available, an XVE-inducible RNAi construct was made to specifically knockdown BLOS1. BLOS1 full-length cDNA was subcloned into an XVE vector to produce sense and antisense strands. Western blotting showed that the protein level of BLOS1 in RNAi line L4 was apparently lower than that in the wild type after estradiol inducement (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the lower level of BLOS1 transcripts by northern blotting after estradiol inducement (data not shown). Our work focused on root phenotype analysis in transgenic line L4, although phenotypes in other tissues might exist. The knockdown line L4 had longer primary roots and more lateral roots (Fig. 4B,C). [[FIGURE]] To explore the function of BLOS1, full-length BLOS1 cDNA was used as a bait to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library. SNX1 (At5g06140) was identified as a novel interactor (Fig. 5A) via the GCN5L domain of BLOS1 (Fig. 5B). Likewise, BLOS2 interacted with SNX1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 5C), further supporting that BLOS1 and BLOS2 might function in the same complex. In addition, BLOS1 and SNX1 colocalized in protoplast (Fig. 5D). To further confirm this interaction, we found that BLOS1 interacted with SNX1 in onion and protoplast by split-YFP assays (Fig. 5E,F). Considering a possible role for BLOS1 in endosomal trafficking, we hypothesized that BLOS1 recruits PINs sorted by SNX1 and transports a portion of PINs to the vacuoles for degradation. Immunocytochemical analysis of PIN1 and PIN2 in BLOS1 RNAi knockdown lines showed that the protein levels of PIN1 and PIN2 on the plasma membrane increased after inducement (Fig. 6C,D) compared with wild type (Col-0) after inducement (Fig. 6A,B). However, the polar distributions of both PIN1 and PIN2 were not apparently altered. To rule out the possibility of transcriptional upregulation of PIN1 and PIN2 by BLOS1, we performed real-time PCR and the results showed no significant increase of PIN1 or PIN2 transcripts in the BLOS1 RNAi-L4 after inducement by estradiol (Fig. 6E). To further study whether the accumulation of PIN1 and PIN2 on the plasma membrane is due to a defect in the endocytosis of these PINs, the recruitment to the endosomes after tracing for 15 minutes in L4 was examined. Recruitment was not apparently impaired as controlled by the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) treatment in FM4-64 endocytic assays (Fig. 7), suggesting that the endocytosis of PIN proteins from the plasma membrane to the endosomes might not be affected in these lines.

!~MM~! Plants were grown under a 16:8-hour light:dark cycle at 22°C on solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar [half-strength MS salts, 3% (w/v) sucrose and 1% (w/v) agar]. For root analysis, seedlings were grown vertically on half MS medium in Petri dishes for the indicated period of time. For growing the inducible RNAi lines, experiments were carried out by using both wild-type (WT, Col-0) and transgenic plants treated with 10 μM beta-estradiol, whereas dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, a solvent for estradiol) was used as treatment for the control lines. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed by following the user manual of the MATCHMAKER 3 Yeast Two-Hybrid System (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) with minor modifications. Full-length BLOS1 cDNA (At2g30330) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CCATATGATGAATACGCCGATGTCACTCTC-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAGACATGATGGAATCCTACTCAGGC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and PstI sites of pGBKT7 (binding domain, BD) and pGADT7 (activation domain, AD) in-frame. Yeast cells were first transformed with pGBKT7-BLOS1 and sequentially transformed with the Arabidopsis cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 AD vector pGAD-GH (CITATION). The transformed cells were plated on dropout selection medium lacking Trp, Leu, His and adenine (Ade) and incubated at 30°C for 3–8 days. To further confirm the screening results by paired yeast two-hybrid assays, full-length BLOS2 (At5g49550) and SNX1 (At5g06140) cDNAs were amplified with primer pairs PBLOS2 5′-AACATATGATGGCGGATTCACGAGATGATCTA-3′, 5′-GGGAATTCTCAGTCTGTAACAACAGAATCATTAG-3′ and PSNX1 5′-AACATATGATGGAGAGCACGGAGCAGCGAGGAA-3′, 5′-CCGAATTCTTAGACAGAATAAGAAGCTTCAAGTTTTGG-3′. The PCR products were respectively cloned into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors in frame. To create inducible dsRNAi transgenic lines, primers 5′-GGCTCGAGACTAGTATGAATACGCCGATG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCAAGCTTCCATCGTCTTCATCC-3′ were used to amplify a 400 bp BLOS1 cDNA PCR product. The remaining procedures were as described previously (CITATION). Two peptides LEKEKSEEESETLE and DDNRRSSLQLREKTERSRKEAI selected from BLOS1 were synthesized to generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The specificity of purified BLOS1 antibody from peptide DDNRRSSLQL-REKTERSRKEAI was examined in protoplast protein extracts. Expression levels of BLOS1 in different tissues were analyzed by purified BLOS1 antibody (1:4000) and protein loadings were revealed by Ponceau S staining or by tubulin. The procedures of western blotting were followed as previously described (CITATION). Real-time RT-PCR analysis (performed in MJ Bio-Rad PTC-200) was conducted by following the ‘Guide to Performing Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression Using Real-Time Quantitative PCR Protocol’ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer pairs 5′-ACCGAGAGATCGAGAAAGGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-CGAATTTCGCCACCGTAATGGCAA-3′ were used to detect BLOS1 mRNA. Primer pairs for detecting PIN1 and PIN2 mRNA were as follows: PIN1-F: 5′-ACTCTCAGATGCAGGTCTAGGCAT-3′; PIN1-R: 5′-ACAGTGCTAAGAATGTCAGGATGCAC-3′; PIN2-F: 5′-CGTCCATCCTGATATTCTCAGCAC-3′; PIN2-R: 5′-CATACACCTAAGCCTGACCTGGAA-3′. Control primers for actin were 5′-GGAACTGGAATGGTGAAGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGATTGGATACTTCAGAGTGAGGA-3′. Total RNA from 2-week-old seedlings were isolated by the Plant RNeasy Prep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA northern blot analysis was performed (20 μg of total RNA per lane) with a 32P-radiolabeled full-length BLOS1 probe. The procedure was carried out as described (CITATION). The open reading frame sequences of BLOS1, BLOS2 and SNX1 were amplified by PCR with gateway-specific primer pairs PgwBLOS1 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGAATACGCCGATGTCACTC-3′, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTATTGTTGATCTTCATGAATGTTTCG-3′, PgwBLOS2 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGGCGGATTCACGAGATGA-3′, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTATCAGTCTGTAACAACAGAATCATT-3′, PgwSNX1 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGGAGAGCACGGAGCAGCCGA-3′, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTATTAGACAGAATAAGAAGCTTCAAG-3′ and gateway-control primer pairs tB1 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT3′ and tB2 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′. The resulting PCR products were cloned into plasmids pUC-SPYCE-gw and pUC-DYNn-gw to give rise to pUC-SPYCE-gw-BLOS1, pUC-DYNn-gw-BLOS2 and pUC-DYNn-gw-SNX1. pUC-DYNn-gw contains N-terminal YFP modified from pUC-SPYNE-gw. To generate the gateway constructs, we followed the gateway cloning protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For the promoter-GUS assay, a 2187 bp genomic fragment upstream of the BLOS1 TAA stop codon, together with a 1148 bp genomic fragment downstream of the BLOS1 TAA stop codon, were PCR-amplified with the primer pairs P2187 5′-GGCTGCAGGGTGATCCATGTTAAAGA-3′, 5′-CCGGATCCTTGTTGATCTTCATGAATG-3′ and P1148 5′-CCGAGCTCGAGCAAGTTATTGTGATTC-3′, 5′-GCCGGAATTCGAGAAATAAAACTTGGC-3′, respectively. The 2187 bp (PstI/BamHI) and 1148 bp (SacI/EcoRI) fragments were cloned into the pBI101 vector in frame to produce the PBLOS1-GUS fusion construct. The construct was introduced into Arabidopsis wild-type plants by Agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration (CITATION). After selection on MS agar plates containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin, the resulting transgenic plants were stained in GUS staining buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM Fe2+CN, 5 mM Fe3+CN and 1 mg/ml X-Gluc; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and mounted in 50% glycerol. A 783 bp DsRed fragment was amplified from pDsRed2N1 (Clontech) by primer pairs 5′-AGTGAACCGTCAGATCCGCTA-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGAGTGGTATGGC TGAT-3′. After digestion with KpnI and XbaI, the resulting PCR product was cloned into pWM101. The BLOS1 and BLOS2 cDNAs were amplified from wild-type Columbia (Col-0) with the primers 5′-CGAGAGCTCATGAATACGCCGATGTCAC-3′, 5′-TGCGGTACCTGTTGATCTTCATGAATGTT-3′ and 5′-GAGAGCTCATGGCGGATTCACGAGATGATCTAGCTG-3′, 5′-GAGGTACCCTGTAACAACAGAATCATTAGAGCGACGC-3′, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the SacI/KpnI sites of the CaMV35S:DsRed2N1:pWM101vector. SNX1 was amplified by the primers 5′-TGTGAGCTCATGGAGAGCACGGAGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-ACCGGTACCACAGAATAAGAAGCTTCAAGT-3′. The PCR products were cloned into the SacI/KpnI sites of the CaMV35S:GFP:pWM101 vector. The resulting constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis protoplast as described (CITATION). Immunocytochemical analysis of PIN1 and PIN2 was performed on whole-mount roots of 5-day-old seedlings. Mouse anti-PIN1 (CITATION) and guinea pig anti-PIN2 (CITATION) were diluted to 1:50 and 1:100, respectively. For the secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Invitrogen) were diluted to 1:500. The detailed procedures were previously described (CITATION; CITATION). Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope and accompanying software. For FM4-64 treatments, seedlings were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in half-liquid medium containing FM4-64 (5 μM) and rinsed three times in half-liquid medium. BFA (25 μM in DMSO) treatments were performed in half-liquid medium for 1 hour before observation. Quantitative data in paired groups was analyzed using the Student's t-test. Qualitative data was compared using the χ2 test. Sequence data from this article can be found in the EMBL and GenBank data libraries under the following accession numbers: BLOS1 (At2g30330, NM_128586), BLOS2 (At5g49550, NM_124332) and SNX1 (At5g06140, NM_120696).
