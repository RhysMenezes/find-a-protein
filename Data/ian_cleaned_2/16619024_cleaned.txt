!~ABS~! Precursor protein targeting toward organellar surfaces is assisted by different cytosolic chaperones. We demonstrate that the chloroplast protein translocon subunit Toc64 is the docking site for Hsp90 affiliated preproteins. Thereby, Hsp90 is recognised by the clamp type TPR domain of Toc64. The subsequent transfer of the preprotein from Toc64 to the major receptor of the Toc complex, namely Toc34, is affinity driven and nucleotide dependent. We propose that Toc64 acts as an initial docking site for Hsp90 associated precursor proteins. We outline a mechanism in which chaperones are recruited for a specific targeting event by a membrane‐inserted receptor.
!~RES~! To elucidate a role of Toc64 in preprotein translocation into chloroplasts, recombinant proteins were used to inhibit import of preproteins (FIG-REF). The translocation of wheat germ translated (wgt) 35S‐labelled precursor of the small subunit of RubisCO (pSSU) into isolated organelles was reduced by 80% in the presence of 10 μM of Toc64 (FIG-REF, Toc64 and FIG-REF, black circle, Supplementary data) or of Toc34ΔTMGTP from Pisum sativum (Toc34, white circle), but not of cBag (the C‐terminal domain of the Bcl2‐associated anthanogene; FIG-REF, grey circle). cBag was found to inhibit the Hsp70 dependent translocation into mitochondria (CITATION). This finding indicates that Hsp70 might not be essential for targeting. The influence of the Toc proteins used is not restricted to pSSU since the translocation of the precursor form of the thylakoid lumen localised oxygen evolving complex subunit of 33 kDa (pOE33) containing a bipartite targeting signal was also reduced by more than 80% of the control in the presence of 10 μM Toc64 (black triangle), but significantly less in the presence of 10 μM Toc34ΔTMGTP (white triangle). Furthermore, both wgt‐preproteins bind to a matrix coated with either receptor (FIG-REF, lanes 3 and 5), but only with background levels to a BSA coated matrix (lane 7). The recognition of preproteins is transit sequence dependent since no interaction of the mature form of SSU with either Toc34 or Toc64 above background level was observed (lanes 3 and 5). Summarising, we conclude that Toc64 and Toc34 act as receptors for preproteins. [[FIGURE]] To identify the domains of Toc64 acting as receptor for preproteins, two polypeptides representing either Toc64ΔTPR or Toc64TPR (FIG-REF) were used for binding studies. Toc64TPR inhibited the translocation of pOE33 into chloroplasts (FIG-REF, TPR, lanes 3–6 and FIG-REF, black triangle) with the same efficiency as full‐length Toc64 (FIG-REF). Toc64ΔTPR competed with a five times lower efficiency when compared to the full‐length receptor (FIG-REF, ΔTPR, lanes 3–6 and FIG-REF, white triangle). Surprisingly, the translocation of pSSU was not affected by addition of Toc64TPR (FIG-REF, black circle, Supplementary data), but by addition of Toc64ΔTPR (white circle). In line, we observed a strong association of pSSU with a Toc64ΔTPR affinity matrix (FIG-REF, lane 5, ΔTPR and FIG-REF), but only a weak interaction with a Toc64TPR coated matrix (FIG-REF, lane 7, TPR). In contrast, pOE33 was recognised by Toc64TPR (lane 7, TPR), but less efficient by Toc64ΔTPR (lane 5, ΔTPR). The latter result is in line with the low capacity of Toc64ΔTPR to compete for the translocation of pOE33 into chloroplasts. Analyzing the binding of reticulocyte lysate translated (rlt) pSSU and pOE33 to Toc64 showed a similar association of pSSU with Toc64 (FIG-REF, lane 3) as with Toc64ΔTPR. In contrast, the interaction of pOE33 with Toc64TPR is reduced to the level of Toc64ΔTPR when rlt‐preprotein is used (lane 6, compare with FIG-REF, lanes 3, 5 and 7). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that the observed differential recognition by Toc64 is not limited to pOE33 and pSSU, the association of the nucleotide transport protein 1 (pNTT1), the precursor of the malate dehydrogenase (pMDH), ferredoxin (pFd) or plastocyanine 1 (pPC) with the different Toc64 polypeptides was analysed (FIG-REF). Like for pOE33, an association of wgt‐pNTT1, pPC with the TPR was observed. In contrast, the stromal proteins pMDH and pFd behaved as pSSU when translated in wheat germ lysate. Therefore, distinct preproteins contain additional information, which results in targeting via Toc64. The observed differential affinity of the two domains of Toc64 was further explored by their ability to compete for the interaction between wgt‐pOE33 or wgt‐pSSU and full‐length Toc64 (FIG-REF, Supplementary data). Toc64TPR efficiently competed for the association between Toc64 and pOE33 (FIG-REF, triangle), but not for the association between Toc64 and pSSU (circle). In line, significant higher concentrations of ΔTPR than of TPR are required for competition of the pOE33–Toc64 interaction (FIG-REF triangles). The opposite result was obtained for pSSU (circles). Therefore, different domains of Toc64 facilitate the recognition of pSSU and pOE33. The recognition of preproteins by the TPR domain of Toc64 is translation system dependent, whereas preproteins are recognised by the N‐terminal domain with lower affinity in a translation system independent manner (FIG-REF). To distinguish between a direct and an indirect interaction, a matrix charged with Toc64 was incubated with wgt‐pOE33 in the presence of heterologous‐expressed pOE33 as competitor. Here, only a weak competition was obtained (FIG-REF, triangle) since about 90% of the wgt‐pOE33 remained bound to Toc64 even in the presence of 0.8 μM pOE33. In contrast, expressed pSSU competed efficiently for the binding of wgt‐pSSU to Toc64 (circle). This indicates that a specificity factor present in the wheat germ lysate might mediate the interaction of wgt‐pOE33 with the TPR region, whereas the association between wgt‐pSSU seams to be direct to the N‐terminal domain of Toc64. [[FIGURE]] Since our observations indicate a mediated interaction between wgt‐pOE33 and Toc64, it was tested if ATP addition elutes wgt‐pOE33 from a Toc64 or Toc34 charged matrix (FIG-REF). Indeed, ATP eluted the bound preprotein from Toc64 (lane 3), but not from Toc34. This suggests an interaction of Toc64 with ATP dependent factors, for example, chaperones affiliated pOE33 in the cytosol. In contrast, wgt‐pSSU bound to Toc64 was not eluted in the presence of ATP supporting a differential mode of recognition by Toc64. Previously, it was speculated (CITATION) that Toc64 might be the docking site for a cytosolic guidance complex for chloroplastic preproteins, which consist of at least 14‐3‐3 and Hsp70 (CITATION). To test this notion, soluble leave extract from P. sativum or wheat germ lysate was incubated with a Toc64, Toc34 or BSA matrix (FIG-REF). We obtained an interaction of the major guidance complex component 14‐3‐3 with Toc34, but not with Toc64 (FIG-REF). The interaction between 14‐3‐3 and import components were further confirmed by incubation of purified Toc34 and 14‐3‐3 in solution and subsequent co‐immunoprecipitation by α14‐3‐3 or αToc34 antibodies (FIG-REF, lane 3). The precipitation observed was found to be specific since preimmunserum was not able to precipitate the complex (FIG-REF). When Toc64 was preincubated with 14‐3‐3, no complex could be precipitated by α14‐3‐3 or αToc64 antibodies (FIG-REF, lane 3). To control for an influence of Toc64 on the interaction of Toc34 with 14‐3‐3, both receptor proteins and 14‐3‐3 were mixed. Again, only Toc34, but not Toc64 was precipitated by the 14‐3‐3 antibodies (FIG-REF, lane 3). Taken these results, we suggest that Toc34 assembles the initial receptor for the guidance complex delivered preproteins. [[FIGURE]] So far we established that Toc64 interacts with wgt‐pOE33 in an ATP‐dependent manner (FIG-REF) but does not recognise the guidance complex (FIG-REF). To analyse, which chaperones are associated with the different preproteins, wgt‐pSSU, wgt‐pOE33 or rlt‐pOE33 (pOE33‐r, FIG-REF) were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against 14‐3‐3 (lane 5), Hsp70 (lane 3) or Hsp90 (lane 4). All proteins were precipitated by Hsp70 antibodies, but only pSSU by 14‐3‐3 antibodies. Here, wgt‐pOE33, but not rtl‐pOE33, was most efficiently precipitated by αHsp90 (lane 4) even though Hsp90 is present in reticulocyte lysate (CITATION) and recognised by our antibodies (not shown). Hence, wgt‐pOE33 seems to be associated with a complex distinct from the previously identified guidance complex (CITATION). When wgt‐pSSU (FIG-REF, black bar) or wgt‐pOE33 (grey bar) were incubated with a Toc64 charged matrix in the presence of the C‐terminal domain of humanHsp90 (aa 566–732, FIG-REF, C90; CITATION), only the interaction of pOE33 with Toc64 was reduced by 60%, whereas the interaction between pSSU and Toc64 was not affected. In line with this observation, the import of pOE33 into chloroplasts (FIG-REF, triangle), but not of pSSU is reduced in the presence of C90 (circle). This supports that pOE33 is directed to Toc64 via Hsp90 since C90 is known to compete for the recognition of Hsp90 by TPR domains (CITATION). In contrast, the association between pSSU and Toc64 was largely decreased in the presence of 14‐3‐3 (FIG-REF, black bar), most likely due to a direct competition for binding sites within the transit sequence, since 14‐3‐3 does not interact with Toc64 (FIG-REF, lane 3), but with the preprotein (FIG-REF, lane 5). 14‐3‐3 also reduced the association of pOE33 and Toc64 (FIG-REF, grey bar) even though the effect of 14‐3‐3 was not as pronounced as for pSSU. This might be explained by the similar fold of 14‐3‐3 proteins and TPR domains (CITATION). 14‐3‐3 would therefore account as competitor by recognition of chaperones in vitro when added in chemical amounts. Summarising, the association between Toc64 and wgt‐pOE33 resembles the behaviour of a chaperone‐mediated interaction. The association of Hsp70 and Hsp90 to pOE33 (FIG-REF) leads to the question which chaperone is recognised by Toc64. Therefore, Toc64, TPR and ΔTPR (FIG-REF) were incubated with a matrix charged with a polypeptide reflecting the C‐terminal portion of human Hsp70 (C70, aa 383–646, FIG-REF, lanes 1–3) or Hsp90 (C90, lanes 4–6). Toc64 and Toc64TPR bound to the C90 (lane 6), but not to the C70 matrix (lane 3). In addition, a molar excess of a peptide representing the 23 C‐terminal amino acids of Hsp90 (P90, FIG-REF, lane 4), but not the peptide representing the 25 C‐terminal amino acids of Hsp70 (P70, lane 3) is able to compete for the interaction between Toc64TPR and the C‐terminal construct of Hsp90 (C90). In contrast, Toc64 recognises both, Hsp70 and Hsp90 present in wheat germ lysate as determined by their interaction with a matrix charged with Toc64 or Toc64TPR (FIG-REF, upper panel). Here, Toc64 recognises Hsp70 with higher efficiency than Hsp90 (FIG-REF, lane 2), whereas the TPR region revealed a stronger interaction with Hsp90 (lane 4) suggesting that the transmembrane region present in Toc64 acts as substrate for Hsp70. Silver staining of the fractions eluted from the affinity matrices revealed the association of three proteins. Hsp90 and Hsp70 were confirmed by immunodecoration and mass spectrometry (identified peptides matched to gi5123910 and gi2827002, not shown). The protein of 50 kDa was identified as tubulin (FIG-REF, square); however, the specificity of this interaction remains elusive. To analyse the specificity of the chaperone interaction, wheat germ lysate was supplemented by additional cytosolic peaHsp70 prior to incubation with Toc64TPR. Again, no competition of Hsp90 recognition was observed (FIG-REF). Similarly, incubating increasing amounts of wheat germ lysate with a Toc64TPR matrix enhanced the interaction of Hsp90, but not of Hsp70 (FIG-REF). Further, incubating wheat germ lysate with the TPR matrix in the presence of the C90 construct reduced the interaction of Hsp90 but not of Hsp70 (FIG-REF). All results together confirm that Hsp90 is recognised with higher affinity than Hsp70. In line, incubating Toc64‐TPR matrix with a soluble extract from pea, a more pronounced association of Hsp90 (60% of total) in comparison to Hsp70 (15% of total) was obtained (FIG-REF, lane 1 versus 3, and FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] The TPR domain of Toc64 assembles a clamp type fold as shown by its alignment with the TPR of Hop and Tom70 (FIG-REF). We therefore introduced point mutations specifically reducing the interaction with chaperones (CITATION). Replacing arginine 550 facing the chaperone‐binding pocket within Toc64TPR by alanine (FIG-REF, 5th helix, red) reduces the interaction of Toc64TPR with Hsp90 or Hsp70 from wheat germ lysate by 70–80% (FIG-REF, lanes 3, 5 and 7, and FIG-REF). In contrast, Toc64TPRN516A (FIG-REF, 3rd helix, red) still recognises Hsp70, but not Hsp90 (FIG-REF, lane 9 and FIG-REF). In line with this observation, Toc64TPRN516A perturbs the import of pOE33 into chloroplasts only very little (FIG-REF) and recognises pOE33 only with a significantly reduced efficiency when compared to wild‐type TPR (FIG-REF). In summary, the clamp type TPR motif of Toc64 interacts with Hsp90 but also with Hsp70 though with low efficiency. However, Hsp70 seems not to mediate the recognition of preproteins on the chloroplast surface since addition of C70 does not interfere with the recognition and subsequent import of pOE33 (data not shown). Furthermore, pOE33 import into isolated chloroplasts was not affected by the presence of cBag (FIG-REF). This C‐terminal domain of Bag‐1 binds to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 to promote the exchange of ADP to ATP (CITATION), which leads to the dissociation of the polypeptide from Hsp70. In contrast, cBag does not affect the Hsp90 substrate interaction (CITATION). Therefore, in case of an Hsp70‐mediated interaction with Toc64, the presence of cBag should have reduced the recognition and subsequent translocation of the preprotein. All results together suggest a receptor function of the TPR domain of Toc64 preferentially for Hsp90 bound preproteins. [[FIGURE]] After demonstrating that pOE33 is associated with cytosolic chaperones (FIG-REF), which are recognised by Toc64 (FIG-REF and FIG-REF), we analysed the complex itself. Subjecting wgt‐pOE33 in the presence of ADP to size exclusion chromatography revealed an average size of about 350 kDa for the complex (FIG-REF, filled circles). Shifting the experimental conditions from 4 to 25°C significantly decreased the amount of complex while purification (not shown). When ATP is added, which stimulates the dissociation of the chaperones, almost no complex was obtained (open circle). Comparing the distribution of pSSU translated in wheat germ (triangle), it becomes obvious that both proteins assemble different complexes. [[FIGURE]] The association of pOE33 with Hsp90 was subsequently probed by immunoprecipitating the protein from fractions of the gradient (FIG-REF). The amount of protein precipitated was highest in the peak fraction. However, a minor amount of protein was still precipitated from the fraction of higher and lower molecular weight. This might reflect the portion of complex assembled pOE33 in these fractions considering normal distributions of complexes in a size exclusion experiment (indicated in FIG-REF, bottom). In line pOE33 of the peak fractions binds to Toc64TPR (FIG-REF, bottom). Therefore, we conclude that pOE33 is assembled in a complex distinct from that targeting pSSU. To probe, if this complex can also be recognised by Toc34, the complex was incubated with ADP (FIG-REF, lane 2) or ATP (lane 3) and with Toc34 or Toc64, respectively. As before, Toc64 was able to interact with the complex in the presence of ADP, but this binding was drastically reduced in the presence of ATP, which leads to a disassembly of the complex (FIG-REF). In contrast, Toc34 only interacts with the preprotein after the complex is dissociated (FIG-REF, lane 2 versus 3). To confirm the presence of the complex observed by size exclusion, wgt‐pOE33 was subjected to a glycerol gradient centrifugation in the presence of geldanamycin (FIG-REF). The peak fractions co‐migrating with the RubisCO complex (II, III, grey region) contain the recognised form of pOE33 since only the preprotein present in these fractions reveals a high affinity for a Toc64TPR matrix (right, top). In addition, an association of pOE33 present in fraction III of the glycerol gradient with Hsp90 could be demonstrated (III, bottom). However, this method is limited by the extended experimental time explaining the lower abundance of the complex in comparison to the size exclusion purification. To test the stability of the complex, wgt‐pOE33 was treated with apyrase, ADP or geldanamycin (GD), which is known to stabilise the substrate binding of Hsp90 specifically (CITATION). After separation of wgt‐pOE33 by a glycerol gradient we obtained the largest amount of complex in the presence of geldanamycin (FIG-REF), and the smallest without addition (−). We conclude that the complex formation is dependent on precursor recognition by Hsp90. So far we demonstrated that pOE33 is part of complex containing Hsp90, which is recognised by Toc64. To further demonstrate that the entire complex is indeed recognised by the TPR domain, wgt‐pOE33 was co‐precipitated by αHsp90 and αToc12 antibodies (latter for control) in the absence or presence of Toc64TPR (FIG-REF). As seen before, αHsp90 antibodies efficiently precipitated pOE33 (lanes 4 and 7) independent of the presence of the TPR. When the eluted proteins were precipitated by αToc64 antibodies, complex formation could be confirmed (lane 8). Hence, we can conclude that Toc64 indeed recognises the cytosolic complex containing pOE33 and Hsp90. To demonstrate the participation of Hsp90 in targeting of preproteins to Toc64, wgt pSSU and pOE33 were imported into chloroplasts in vitro (FIG-REF) or GFP fusions of the preproteins in vivo (FIG-REF) in the absence or presence of geldanamycin. In the presence of geldanamycin, a reduced translocation of pOE33, but not of pSSU, was obtained in both experiments. In vitro the translocation was reduced by 40%. The inhibition efficiency resembles the previously reported reduction of translocation of Tom70 dependent precursor into mitochondria in the presence of geldanamycin (CITATION). To further investigate the role of Toc64, a loss of function mutant for Toc64‐III (At3g17970) was analysed (FIG-REF). Plants of selected line 1 contain a homozygote T‐DNA insertion since no gene specific PCR product could be obtained (FIG-REF, lane 2). Furthermore, these plants do not contain Toc64‐III protein (FIG-REF), nor toc64‐III mRNA (FIG-REF). The transcript level of toc64‐I or toc64‐V is not altered. However, these two proteins can not replace Toc64 in the outer envelope of chloroplasts since Toc64‐V is a mitochondrial receptor, and Toc64‐I does not contain a TPR domain (CITATION). In line with the previous report, the plants did not show a visible growth phenotype (CITATION). However, in contrast to the previous report, where translocation of not Hsp90 associated rtl‐pOE33 (FIG-REF) into chloroplasts of mutants was not altered when compared to wild type, the initial rate of translocation of wgt‐pOE33 associated with Hsp90 (FIG-REF) into chloroplasts from the knock out line was reduced (about 40%, see inset). A similar reduction was reported for the translocation of proteins dependent on the TPR domain containing Tom70 in the deletion strain of this receptor (CITATION; CITATION). Summarising, Toc64 is the receptor for preproteins delivered by a complex including the cytosolic Hsp90. [[FIGURE]] Toc64 represents the docking site for Hsp90 delivered preproteins. Hence, we investigated the association of Toc64 with the Toc complex. The Toc core components co‐precipitated by αToc64 antibodies in the presence of GMP‐PNP, a nonhydrolysable analogue of GTP (FIG-REF, lane 2), but not in the presence of GDP (lane 3) using solubilised OEV's. This finding was confirmed by precipitation using αToc34 antibodies (FIG-REF). The OE protein Oep24 was not precipitated (FIG-REF, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting a specific interaction between the Toc core components and Toc64. The GTP dependence of the interaction points toward an association of Toc64 with either Toc159 or Toc34. Using purified proteins, an interaction of Toc64 with Toc34GMP‐PNP, but not with Toc159GMP‐PNP (FIG-REF, lane 2) could be established. This interaction is mediated by the cytosolic exposed regions of the receptors since Toc34ΔTM, which lacks the C‐terminal membrane anchor was recognised by a matrix charged with Toc64 (FIG-REF, lane 2) or Toc64TPR (lane 3), but not with Toc64ΔTPR (lane 4) after loading with GMP‐PNP. This interaction also occurs in the presence of Hsp90 since Toc34GMP‐PNP can be recovered from a C90 charged matrix (FIG-REF) in the presence of Toc64TPR (lanes 3 and 5). In turn, association of Toc64TPR with C90 was not affected by the presence of Toc34GMP‐PNP (lanes 3 and 4). We conclude that Toc64TPR associated with Hsp90 interacts with the cytosolic domain of Toc34 in a GTP dependent manner. [[FIGURE]] To reconstitute preprotein transfer, wgt‐pOE33 was incubated with a matrix charged with Toc64 (FIG-REF) or Toc34ΔTM in the presence of GMP‐PNP (FIG-REF). Subsequently, the binding of the precursor protein was competed for by Toc64 (black), Toc34 in the absence (white) or presence of GMP‐PNP (grey). Soluble Toc64 efficiently competes for the interaction between Toc64 and pOE33 (FIG-REF, black triangle). In contrast, Toc34 competed for the interaction between Toc64 and pOE33 only with low efficiency (white triangle) even in the presence of GMP‐PNP (grey triangle). However, Toc34GMP‐PNP recognises preproteins like pOE33 with high affinity (FIG-REF), but only after disassembly of the chaperone complex (FIG-REF). Therefore, the interaction might be targeted toward the free preprotein, since the high affinity interaction was reconstituted in vitro as well (CITATION). Hence, the competition experiment was performed with Toc34 as bait. The competition of the complex between pOE33 and Toc34 by Toc34 in the absence or presence of GMP‐PNP revealed a similar efficiency as found for the self‐competition by Toc64 (not shown, FIG-REF, grey triangle). Toc64 competed with a low efficiency for the interaction between Toc34GMP‐PNP and pOE33 (black triangle). This finding supports that Toc34 recognises the precursor after dissociation from Hsp90, since Toc64 only recognises the chaperone associated precursor protein. The results suggest that ATP is indeed required for the release of pOE33 from Toc64 to Toc34. To test this notion, a wgt‐pOE33 pre‐incubated Toc64TPR matrix was incubated with Toc34GMP‐PNP in the presence (FIG-REF, lane 5) or absence of ATP (lane 6) followed by recovery of Toc34 by Ni‐NTA matrix. The recovery of pOE33 by this procedure was five‐fold higher in the presence of ATP than in the absence of ATP (upper half of diagram), where the binding efficiency of eluted pOE33 to Toc34 is not ATP dependent (lower half of diagram). Therefore, the chaperone activation by ATP might be the initial trigger for precursor release. Using the flow through from the Toc64TPR matrix generated prior to addition of Toc34 (lanes 2–4), most of the preprotein could be precipitated by subsequent addition of the receptor (lane 4). This is in line with the presented results (FIG-REF) that most of the precursor protein is not chaperone associated when in vitro wheat germ lysate is incubated at 25°C for prolonged times. To finalise the cycle of precursor protein delivery, the association between Toc64 and the Toc core complex within OE membranes was analysed in the presence of heterologous expressed pOE33. In the absence of pOE33, interaction between Toc64, Toc159 and Toc34 can be detected (FIG-REF, lane 3). In the presence of pOE33 (lane 6), the interaction between Toc64 and the Toc core complex was reduced even in the presence of GMP‐PNP (FIG-REF, lanes 3 and 6). Since the precursor protein does not directly interact with Toc64 (FIG-REF) but with Toc34 (CITATION), we conclude that Toc64 interacts with the core complex only when Toc34 is in a precursor free state.
!~MM~! RNAse free DNAse, RNAse I, apyrase and wheat germ lysate were from Roche (Penzberg, Germany); 35S‐labelled methionine, standard molecules for size exclusion chromatography, Q‐Sepharose and Percoll from Amersham‐Biosciences (Freiburg, Germany) and geldanamycin from Sigma Aldrich (München, Germany). Data are presented using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., USA), Corel Draw 12 (Eastman Kodak Company, USA) and Sigma Plot 7.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Generation, translation or expression of pOE33, pSSU, NTT1, MDC, PC1, Fd, C70, C90, 14‐3‐3, cBag, Toc64 or Toc34ΔTM and standard techniques like immunoprecipitation, SDS–PAGE analysis and others are previously described (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Toc64 from P. sativum was used as template for construct generation (CITATION; FIG-REF and FIG-REF). Constructs were cloned into pET21d (Novagen, Madison, USA) and controlled by sequencing. The postribosomal supernatant of radioactive‐labelled proteins after centrifugation (10 min/250 000 g/4°C) was used for experiments. Chloroplasts isolation from pea (CITATION) or A. thaliana (CITATION), in vitro import (CITATION) and binding experiments (CITATION) were performed as described. For competition, Hsp70 was purified from the supernatant of lysed plant cells supplemented with buffer to a final composition of 10 mM KoAC, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6 (buffer A) followed by incubation with ATP agarose (16 h/4°C). The beads were washed twice with two column volumes of buffer A, one column volume of buffer A containing 1 M KoAc and one column volume buffer A before elution of Hsp70 by 10 mM ATP in binding buffer. The purity of the chaperone was controlled by SDS–PAGE analysis. Wgt 35S‐labelled pOE33 was preincubated as indicated and subjected onto a Superdex 200 (at 4°C) using 100 mM KoAC, 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2 as running buffer or a 4 ml glycerol step gradient of 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 50 mM KoAc and 2 mM MgCl2 containing 10–60% glycerol. The gradient was fractionated after centrifugation (83 000 g/4°C/over night). Fractions were analysed by separation on SDS–PAGE and autoradiography. The TPR1 of Hop (pdb:1EWL) revealed a gapless alignment with Toc64TPR. Thus, 1EWL was used as template for protein and peptide. The homology model of psToc64‐TPR was built using WHAT IF (CITATION).
