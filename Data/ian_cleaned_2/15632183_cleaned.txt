!~ABS~! Chloroplasts contain a novel type of signal recognition particle (cpSRP) that consists of two proteins, cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. cpSRP is involved in the post-translational targeting of the nuclear encoded light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCPs) to the thylakoid membrane by forming a soluble cpSRP·LHCP transit complex in the stroma. Despite high sequence homology between chloroplast and cytosolic SRP54 proteins, the 54-kDa subunit of cpSRP is unique in its ability to bind cpSRP43. In this report, we identified a 10-amino acid long segment of cpSRP54 that forms the cpSRP43-binding site. This segment is located at position 530–539 close to the C terminus of cpSRP54. In addition, we demonstrate that arginine at position 537 is essential for binding cpSRP43 and that mutation of arginine 536 drastically reduced cpSRP43 binding. Mutations within the cpSRP43-binding site of cpSRP54 that reduced or completely abolished cpSRP complex formation also did inhibit transit complex formation and integration of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane, reflecting the importance of these residues for LHCP targeting. Alignment studies revealed that the cpSRP43-binding site is conserved in chloroplast SRP54 proteins and is not present in any SRP54 subunit of cytosolic SRPs. 
!~RES~! Previously, it was demonstrated that the interaction of cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 is mediated via the C-terminal located M-domain of cpSRP54 (cpSRP54M; residues 371–564) (CITATION). To define more clearly the region of cpSRP54M that mediates binding to cpSRP43, serial deletions from either the N- or the C-terminal end of cpSRP54M were cloned into the bait plasmid pGBKT7. The interaction of cpSRP54M and the various deletion constructs with mature cpSRP43 was tested in the yeast two-hybrid system using pACT2-43 as prey plasmid (Table III). No obvious change in binding intensity was observed between cpSRP43 and the N-terminal deletion constructs cpSRP54M(485–564), cpSRP54M-(521–564), and cpSRP54M-(530–564) in comparison with full-length cpSRP54M (Table III). A weaker binding was detected between cpSRP43 and cpSRP54M-(533–564), and no binding was observed for cpSRP54M-(535–564). Yeast two-hybrid experiments testing the interaction of C-terminal deletion constructs of cpSRP54M with cpSRP43 demonstrated that the last 25 residues can be removed from the C terminus without having an obvious influence on the binding intensity of the resulting construct cpSRP54M-(371–539) to cpSRP43. However, further removal of two additional C-terminal residues, generating cpSRP54M-(371–537), led to a complete loss of interaction with cpSRP43 (Table III). Taken together, these results suggested that the region comprising residues 530–539 of cpSRP54 may form the cpSRP43-binding site. The amino acid sequence and the position of this putative cpSRP43-binding site within the M-domain of cpSRP54 are shown in Fig. 1.  [[TABLE]]  [[FIGURE]]  To confirm this result, we tested whether a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative cpSRP43-binding site competes with cpSRP54M for the complex formation with cpSRP43 in in vitro pull-down experiments. Fig. 2A shows that the binding of radiolabeled cpSRP54M to GST-cpSRP43 in the presence of increasing amounts of the synthetic peptide is progressively inhibited. In pull-down assays conducted in the presence of 7.5 μm synthetic peptide, the binding of cpSRP54M to cpSRP43 was blocked completely, whereas the addition of an unrelated peptide did not lead to a reduction of complex formation (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, we were able to corroborate the finding that residues 530–539 of cpSRP54 are involved in the formation of the cpSRP43-binding site by demonstrating that a deletion construct of cpSRP54M lacking this region is not able to bind cpSRP43 (Table III).  [[FIGURE]]  A noticeable feature of the amino acid region of cpSRP54 comprising the cpSRP43-binding site is the presence of the positively charged pentapeptide (RRKRK) located at amino acid position of 536–540. To determine whether this region is involved in the binding of the highly negatively charged cpSRP43, we constructed cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540) and tested its ability to bind cpSRP43 by yeast two-hybrid experiments and in vitro pull-down assays. As shown in Table III and Fig. 4, no interaction was observed between cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540) and cpSRP43. We proved that the removal of the positively charged pentapeptide did not lead to an overall structural rearrangement by performing FTIR spectroscopy of highly purified recombinant cpSRP54M and cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540). Both proteins generated very similar spectra indicating that their secondary structure is almost identical (Fig. 3). This result, together with the above mentioned observation that a synthetic peptide containing the pentapeptide RRKRK inhibits the binding of cpSRP54 to cpSRP43, demonstrates clearly that residues within this motif are essential for the formation of the cpSRP43-binding site.  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]]  We next aimed to define the role of the individual amino acids within the pentapeptide RRKRK(536–540) in binding cpSRP43. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to exchange one or more of these positively charged residues into uncharged amino acids. The ability of the generated cpSRP54M mutants to bind cpSRP43 was initially tested in yeast two-hybrid experiments (Table IV). No significant change in binding intensity to cpSRP43 was observed when using the construct cpSRP54M(K538M), cpSRP54M(R539G), or cpSRP54M(K540M). Even the simultaneous change of the positively charged residues Lys-538, Arg-539, and Lys-540 (cpSRP54M(K538M,R539G,K540M)) or the deletion of these amino acids (cpSRP54M-(Δ538–540)) did not lead to a measurable loss of interaction with cpSRP43 in this system. However, the single mutation R537G caused a complete loss of binding of the corresponding construct cpSRP54M(R537G) to cpSRP43 because no β-galactosidase activity was detectable in the yeast two-hybrid system. Consistently, all of the other tested constructs containing the R537G mutation (cpSRP54M(R537G,K538M), cpSRP54M(R537G,K538M,R539G,K540M)) were also unable to interact with cpSRP43 (Table IV). Introduction of the mutation R536G reduced the binding intensity, and no interaction with cpSRP43 was observed for the construct cpSRP54M(R536G,K538M,R539G,K540M). These results suggested that residues Arg-537 and Arg-536 of cpSRP54 are critical for the constitution of the cpSRP43-binding site, whereas Lys-538, Arg-539, and Lys-540 are not or only slightly involved in binding cpSRP43.  [[TABLE]]  To further support these results and to quantify them, we measured the differences in the binding of radiolabeled cpSRP54M or various constructs containing mutations within the RRKRK(536–540) motif to GST-cpSRP43 by in vitro pull-down experiments (Fig. 4A). In accordance with the yeast two-hybrid experiments, the results of the binding reactions show that cpSRP54M constructs containing the mutation R537G did not interact with cpSRP43 and that the binding of cpSRP54M(R536G) to cpSRP43 was reduced on average by ∼90% compared with cpSRP54M. The mutations K540M and K538M did not influence binding significantly, whereas the conversion of Arg-539 into Gly-539 resulted in a considerable reduction of binding by ∼45%. This reduction value was not detected in the semi-quantitative yeast two-hybrid system.  We next sought to analyze whether the positive charge or the specific structure of the arginine side chain at position 536, 537, or 539 is required for the interaction of cpSRP54 with cpSRP43. Therefore, arginines at these positions were replaced individually with lysine and the interaction of the resulting constructs with cpSRP43 was tested by pull-down experiments. As shown in Fig. 4B, cpSRP54M(R536K) and cpSRP54M(R537K) were not able to bind cpSRP43. A reduced binding efficiency was observed for cpSRP54(R539K). Hence, the constructs containing the Arg/Lys mutations behaved in the same way as the Arg/Gly mutants, demonstrating that a positive charge at position 536, 537, or 539 is not sufficient to mediate interaction with cpSRP43. We then analyzed whether the polar-charged side chain of Arg-537 can be functionally replaced by the polar side chains of glutamine or asparagine. As shown in Fig. 4B, no binding was observed between the constructs cpSRP54M(R537Q) or cpSRP54M(R537N) and cpSRP43. These results indicated that the interaction of cpSRP43 with cpSRP54 specifically requires an arginine residue at position 537.  Previous experiments demonstrated that both subunits of cpSRP are required for the formation of the transit complex with LHCP (CITATION). Therefore, mutations within cpSRP54 that abolish or diminish binding to cpSRP43 should also have a negative effect on transit complex formation, assuming that a complex formation between cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 is required for the interaction with LHCP. To test the function of Arg-536, Arg-537, and Arg-539 of cpSRP54 in transit complex formation, radiolabeled LHCP was mixed with recombinant cpSRP43 and the indicated cpSRP54M constructs and assayed for transit complex formation. The transit complex represents a soluble form of LHCP and can be detected on non-denaturing gels. As shown in Fig. 5, those mutations (Δ536–540, R537G, R537G/K538M, R536G, and R539G), which reduced binding of cpSRP54 to cpSRP43, inhibited transit complex formation to approximately the same extent as binding to cpSRP43. As expected from the above results, the mutations K538M and K540M did not reduce the formation of transit complex.  [[FIGURE]]  To further examine the role of the cpSRP43-binding site of cpSRP54 in LHCP biogenesis, the integration of radiolabeled LHCP into thylakoid membranes was measured in the presence of recombinant cpSRP43, in vitro translated cpFtsY, GTP, and in vitro translated cpSRP54 or the constructs cpSRP54(R537G), cpSRP54(R537K), and cpSRP54(R536K). Fig. 6 shows that the integration activity in assays containing the mutated forms of cpSRP54 is strongly reduced compared with the assay containing cpSRP54. Taken together, these data demonstrate clearly that those amino acids of cpSRP54, which are essential for the cpSRP complex formation, are also crucial for the transport and insertion of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane.

All of the PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI and BamH1 and cloned into the NcoI-BamH1 site of the yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid pGBKT7 (BD Biosciences) encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. All of the constructs contained an additional c-Myc epitope tag. Plasmid pACT2-cpSRP43 (CITATION) encoding the Gal4 activation domain as a fusion with mature cpSRP43 was used as prey plasmid. Each construct was confirmed by sequencing (Seqlab).  [[TABLE]]  Site-directed Mutagenesis Constructs for the Yeast Two-hybrid System—All of the site-directed mutagenesis constructs were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primer sets used for the mutant constructs are listed in Table II. Plasmid pGBKT7-cpSRP54M was used as template DNA to gain the single point mutation constructs cpSRP54M(R536G), cpSRP54M(R537G), cpSRP54M(K538M), cpSRP54M(R539G), and cpSRP54M(K540M) and the deletion constructs cpSRP54M-(Δ531–539), cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540), and cpSRP54M-(Δ538–540). The double mutation constructs cpSRP54M(R537G,K538M), cpSRP54M(K538M,R539G), cpSRP54M(R539G,K540M), and cpSRP54M(K538M,K540M) were obtained by using the single point mutation constructs as template. The triple point mutation construct cpSRP54M(K538M,R539G,K540M) was obtained by using pGBKT7-cpSRP54M(R539G,K540M) as template and the quadruple point mutation constructs cpSRP54M(R537G,K538M,R539G,K540M) and cpSRP54M(R536G,K538M,R539G,K540M) by using pGBKT7-cpSRP54M(K538M,R539G,K540M) as template. The correct sequence of all of the constructs was verified by sequencing (Seqlab).  [[TABLE]]  Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid assays were done as described by Jonas-Straube et al. (CITATION) with the exception of the following modifications. pGBKT7 constructs (see above) were used instead of pAS2 constructs as prey plasmids. For cpSRP54M constructs that showed only weak or no interaction with cpSRP43 in the yeast two-hybrid experiments, expression levels comparable with full-length cpSRP54M were verified by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the c-Myc epitope (BD Biosciences). The growth of the yeast cells on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (-leu,-trp,-his) was classified in (++), (+), and (–), whereby (++) means that most colonies have a diameter of >1.5 mm and (–) indicates normal background growth (whitish colonies <0.6 mm). The filter lifts to measure β-galactosidase activity were incubated for at least 1.5 h to develop a blue color ((++), strong blue color; (+), medium blue color; (–), no blue color development). All of the pGBKT7 constructs were cotransformed with pACT2 in yeast cells and showed no self-activation of the reporter genes.  Plasmid Construction for Protein Pull-down Assays—The cDNAs coding for cpSRP54M, cpSRP54M(R536G), cpSRP54M(R537G), cpSRP54M(K538M), cpSRP54M(R539G), cpSRP54M(K540M), cpSRP54M(R537G,K538M), and cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540) were obtained by PCR amplification using primer combination 1 and 13 (Table I) and the corresponding pGBKT7 constructs described above as template. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and HindIII and cloned into the NcoI-HindIII site of the in vitro translation vector pGem4SS6.5 (CITATION). The corresponding constructs encoding cpSRP54M(R536K), cpSRP54M(R537K), cpSRP54M(R537N), cpSRP54M(R537Q), and cpSRP54M(R539K) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (see above) using the primer sets, as listed in Table II, and pGem4SS6.5-cpSRP54M as template DNA. Each construct was confirmed by sequencing. The translation vectors pSPUTK-GST-chaos encoding GST-cpSRP43 and pSPUTK-GST encoding GST were described by Tu et al. (CITATION) and Jonas-Straube et al. (CITATION).  Protein Pull-down Assays—GST-cpSRP43, GST, and the indicated constructs of cpSRP54M were obtained by in vitro transcription and in vitro translation in a wheat germ extract (Promega). CpSRP54M and its mutagenesis constructs were labeled with [35S]methionine. 15 μl of in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43 and equal pmol of radiolabeled in vitro translated cpSRP54M or the indicated constructs were diluted with incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm KOAc, 10 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 120 μl. Control reactions were performed with in vitro translated GST instead of GST-cpSRP43. All of the binding reactions contained equal amounts of wheat germ extract. The proteins were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, and the precipitation of the GST fusion proteins with glutathione-Sepharose was performed as described by Tu et al. (CITATION). The eluted samples were analyzed on 15% acrylamide gels and detected by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager.  Transit Complex Formation—Transit complex formation was measured essentially as described previously (CITATION) with the following modifications. 1.5 μl of 35S-labeled pLhcb1 translation product was incubated with 50 ng of recombinant cpSRP43 (obtained as described by Tu et al. (CITATION)) and equimolar amounts of in vitro translated cpSRP54M, cpSRP54M(R536G), cpSRP54M(R537G), cpSRP54M(K538M), cpSRP54M(R539G), cpSRP54M(K540M), cpSRP54M(R537G,K538M), or cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540). Reactions were separated on 7% non-denaturing acrylamide gels and visualized on a PhosphorImager.  Plasmid Construction for Protein Expression—cDNA encoding cpSRP54M and cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540) were obtained by PCR amplification using primer combination 1 and 14 and the corresponding pGBKT7 constructs as template. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and HindIII and cloned into the NcoI-HindIII site of the overexpression vector pET-29b(+) (Novagen). Each construct was confirmed by sequencing.  Protein Expression and FTIR Spectroscopy—Recombinant cpSRP54M and cpSRP54M-(Δ536–540) were expressed from their corresponding pET-29b(+) constructs (see above) in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Overexpressed protein was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under native conditions as suggested by the manufacturer. Proteins were eluted from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose with 0.5 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. The buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-DCl, pH 8.0, in D2O, and the protein samples were concentrated to 10–15 μg/μl using spin concentrators (Vivascience).  FTIR spectroscopy was carried out at 22 °C on a Bruker IFS 88 spectrometer. For each spectrum, a 256-scan interferogram was collected at single beam mode with a 2-cm–1 resolution and a 1-cm–1 interval from the 2000 to 1000 cm–1 region. Reference spectra were recorded under identical conditions with solute buffer only. Each measurement was repeated three times. The resultant protein absorbance spectrum was smoothed to a 4-cm–1 resolution with a Fourier self-deconvolution algorithm to reduce background. Signals originating from side chains were corrected using side chain absorbance bands according to Barth et al. (CITATION) with an algorithm from Goormaghtigh et al. (CITATION).
