!~ABS~! Mediator, a central coregulator of transcription, has been identified as a large protein complex in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to man. It is therefore remarkable that Mediator has not yet been identified within the plant kingdom. Here we identify Mediator in a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The plant Mediator subunits typically show very low homology to other species, but our biochemical purification identifies 21 conserved and six A. thaliana-specific Mediator subunits. Most notably, we identify the A. thaliana proteins STRUWWELPETER (SWP) and PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME 1 (PFT1) as the Med14 and Med25 subunits, respectively. These findings show that specific plant Mediator subunits are linked to the regulation of specialized processes such as the control of cell proliferation and the regulation of flowering time in response to light quality. The identification of the plant Mediator will provide new tools and insights into the regulation of transcription in plants.
!~RES~! We initially performed simple searches of the A. thaliana genome for homologs to the S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits and could then identify A. thaliana Med6 (AtMed6) (24% identity and 41% similarity over a 191 amino acids long region), AtMed7 (33%/48% over 188 amino acids), AtMed10 (26%/50% over 139 amino acids), AtMed14 (21%/41% over 171 amino acids), AtMed15 (26%/38% over 132 amino acids, and AtMed21 (24%/41% over 139 amino acids) (see the CITATION available with this article online). Others have also reported similar results for additional subunits, but the sequence homologies have generally been too low to make firm conclusions about the presence of a plant Mediator complex (CITATION). In order to obtain tools for further biochemical studies, we expressed AtMed6 and AtMed7 in E. coli, purified the recombinant proteins, and used them to produce polyclonal antibodies. For isolation of proteins from A. thaliana cell suspension cultures, we essentially followed the previously described procedure for isolation of whole-cell protein extracts and purification of Mediator from S. cerevisiae (CITATION; CITATIONA). Fractionation on BioRex-70 showed that the AtMed6 and AtMed7 coeluted, thus indicating that a Mediator complex might also exist in A. thaliana (CITATIONB). However, the AtMed6 and AtMed7 proteins eluted at a much higher potassium acetate concentration (1200 mM) compared to the yeast Mediator complex (600 mM). This indicated a difference between the yeast and A. thaliana Mediator but also resulted in a higher purification rate of the latter complex. We also found that the majority of Pol II in the A. thaliana whole-cell extract eluted at 600 mM potassium acetate, but a minor fraction could be detected in the 1200 mM potassium acetate eluate (CITATIONB). The AtMed6 and AtMed7 proteins also coeluted from the next DEAE-Sephacel column, but again the A. thaliana Mediator homologs eluted differently compared to the yeast proteins (in the 200 mM eluate instead of the 550 mM eluate; CITATIONC). Because the elution profiles of the A. thaliana Mediator homologs resulted in a higher purification rate compared to yeast, we decided to affinity purify the anti-AtMed6 antibodies to use them for immunoprecipitation of a possible A. thaliana Mediator complex directly from the 200 mM potassium acetate eluate of the DEAE-Sephacel column. Western blot analysis showed that AtMed7 partially coimmunoprecipitated with AtMed6 (CITATIOND). However, we noticed that a fraction of AtMed7 does not seem to interact with AtMed6. This is shown both in CITATIONB and 1D and is also supported by results described below. Proteins bound to the anti-AtMed6 protein A Sepharose beads were resolved by both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (CITATIONA and 2B). The purpose of these gels was not to reveal individual proteins but rather to separate the components for later identification by mass spectrometry (cf. lanes 1 and 2 in CITATIONA). In total, 136 bands and spots from the 1D and 2D gels were excised, digested, and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) performed on a capillary HPLC coupled to a Q-ToF mass spectrometer. We found peptides mapping to 19 Mediator subunits ( CITATION), but only five of them (AtMed6, AtMed7, AtMed10, AtMed14, and AtMed21) were annotated as Mediator homologs by the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (see CITATION for alignments of the amino acid sequences for all identified Mediator subunits). Sixteen of the A. thaliana homologs are shared yeast and metazoan Mediator subunits, and three of them (Med23, Med25, and Med28) are specific to the metazoan Mediator complexes. It is well known that evolution of A. thaliana involved a recent whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent loss of genes. Consequently, we found duplicated genes encoding paralogs for four A. thaliana Mediator subunits: AtMed7, AtMed10, AtMed20, and AtMed22 (see CITATION and CITATION). Later we also found two genes that encode paralogs of AtMed19 (see below). In all cases except for AtMed19 and AtMed20, our mass spectrometry analyses of the purified A. thaliana Mediator complex identified peptides that map to both paralogs, indicating that both are expressed and built into a Mediator complex, even though they differ in up to 46 out of 189 positions in the amino acid sequence (e.g., AtMed10a and b; see CITATION). Finally, we also identified several RNA polymerase peptides in our purified A. thaliana Mediator fraction (CITATION), indicating that we had isolated the A. thaliana Mediator in the form of a holoenzyme complex. Even though we found A. thaliana homologs to the kinase domain subunits Med12 and Med13 and several homologs to both CDK8 and CycC by searching the TAIR database, we were unable to identify peptides in our purified Mediator fraction that mapped to any of these subunits. Furthermore, we could not find homologous sequences or peptides mapping to the shared yeast and human Med1 and Med19 subunits; to the yeast-specific Med2, Med3, and Med5 subunits; or to the metazoan-specific Med24, Med26, Med27, Med29, and Med30 subunits. Most interestingly, our biochemical purification of the A. thaliana Mediator revealed that the previously identified proteins SWP (CITATION) and PFT1 (CITATION) are homologous to the shared yeast/metazoan Med14 and the metazoan-specific Med25 subunits, respectively ( CITATIONA). SWP was already annotated as a potential Med14 homolog in TAIR, but our biochemical purification conclusively identifies SWP as an A. thaliana Mediator subunit. Our identification of PFT1 as homologous to Med25 is unique and relied on the biochemical approach. In metazoans, Med25 has been described as both Arc92 and ACID and it was identified as the Mediator subunit that functions as target for the well-studied herpes simplex virus VP16 transcriptional activation domain (CITATION). The N-terminal part of the metazoan Med25 interacts with other Mediator subunits (amino acids 1–226; black box in CITATIONA and 3B), and in line with these results we found that the N-terminal part of PFT1 is the most conserved region of the protein. Furthermore, a BLAST search using the entire PFT1 amino acid sequence as query only identified amino acids 13–192 in human Med25 (28% identities, 42% positives). The C-terminal part of human Med25 (amino acids 402–543; blue box in CITATIONA and 3B) was shown to interact with the VP16 activation domain. We find that this part is less conserved between metazoans and A. thaliana (CITATIONA). The homologies in the CTD that first seem apparent are mostly due to the high content of glutamine residues in this region. However, a comparison of Med25 between different plants reveals a highly conserved domain that overlaps with the position in the plant Med25 sequences that corresponds to the VP16 interaction domain in human Med25 (blue box in CITATIONB), suggesting that this domain of AtMed25 might interact with plant-specific transcriptional regulator proteins. We also found a set of 13 proteins that could not be identified as homologs to any yeast or metazoan Mediator subunits ( CITATION). Several of these proteins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation or control of flowering, and it is therefore possible that some of them are plant-specific Mediator subunits. At1g44910 encodes a WW domain-containing protein, a domain that is also found in the flowering time control protein FCA (CITATION). It also shows homology to CA150, a nuclear protein that is associated with the human Pol II holoenzyme and that is involved in Tat-dependent transcriptional activation in HIV-1 (CITATION). At5g42060 is similar to the transcriptional coactivator p15 (PC4) family protein (CITATION). PC4 is a homolog of SUB1 in yeast that has been shown to interact with Med17 in two-hybrid experiments (CITATION). At5g64680 shows homology to TRIP12, which specifically interacts with the ligand-binding domain of the human thyroid hormone receptor (CITATION). The closest homolog of TRIP12 in yeast is Ash1, a protein that has a negative effect on expression of HO and shows genetic interactions with Med21 (CITATION). We also identified peptides mapping to two proteins that have been identified as transcription factors. The first, GT-3b (At2g38250), is a member of a family of plant-specific trihelix (helix-loop-helix-loop-helix) DNA-binding factors that are predominantly expressed in floral buds and roots and bind as homodimers or heterodimers to GT elements in several plant promoters (CITATION). GT elements were initially identified in the pea rbcS-3A gene promoter as a light-responsive element called Box II (CITATION). The second transcription factor, At4g25210, belongs to a family of plant-specific transcription factors that all contain a common central region similar to the GLABROUS1 enhancer binding protein (GeBP) (CITATION). In addition, the closest human homolog to At3g10690, topoisomerase IIβ, has recently been shown to be required for regulated transcription by inducing double-stranded DNA breaks (CITATION). By database searches, we found that At1g11760 shows weak homology to yeast Med17 and At1g31360 is a RecQ DNA helicase (CITATION). We also identified a set of proteins (At5g67240, At5g28540/At5g42020, and At4g25630) in the immunoprecipitated fraction for which we were unable to find clear connections to transcription or flowering. Finally, we identified peptides mapping to the uncharacterized, plant-specific proteins encoded by At5g63480, At3g23590, and At2g48110. The last two genes encode proteins that are highly similar to each other (52% identity/68% similarity over 1336 amino acids), and we therefore interpret them as being paralogs. However, because At3g23590 and At2g48110 are identified from different spots and because we identify peptides mapping to both proteins we conclude that both paralogs are present in the purified Mediator. An α-At1g11760 antiserum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a peptide from the C terminus of the At1g11760 protein. Western blotting of fractions eluted from the previously described BioRex-70 column showed that At1g11760 coeluted with AtMed6 and AtMed7 in the 1200 mM potassium acetate fraction (Figures CITATIONB and CITATIONA). Similarly, we also found that At1g11760, AtMed6, and AtMed7 coelute from the DEAE-Sephacel column (data not shown) and that At1g11760 coimmunoprecipitates with AtMed6 (CITATIONB). In order to further characterize the A. thaliana Mediator, the α-At1g11760 antibodies were affinity purified and used for immunoprecipitation experiments using the 200 mM potassium acetate eluate from the DEAE-Sephacel column. CITATIONC shows that both AtMed6 and AtMed7 are coimmunoprecipitated with At1g11760. Proteins bound to the α-At1g11760 antibody-protein A Sepharose beads were resolved by 1D SDS-PAGE. In total 30 bands from this gel were excised, digested, and analyzed by reverse-phase LC-ESI-MS/MS as described above. Again, we identified 19 A. thaliana Mediator homologs in the immunoprecipitated fraction. Of these, 17 were identical to the Mediator proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with the AtMed6 protein (CITATION and CITATIOND). In addition, we also found peptides mapping to two additional A. thaliana Mediator subunits: AtMed19 (At5g12230) and AtMed27 (At3g09180) (CITATION; in bold style). However, in this experiment we were unable to find peptides mapping to AtMed7 and AtMed21. It is known that Med7 and Med21 interact and form a subcomplex in the yeast Mediator, and they might therefore be lost as a subcomplex from Mediator in this purification (CITATION). This is also in line with the results shown in CITATION, where only a fraction of AtMed7 is coimmunoprecipitated with AtMed6. In total, these results show that At1g11760 is a bona fide Mediator subunit specific for A. thaliana. According to the suggested new unified nomenclature for Mediator proteins, At1g11760 should therefore be named Med32. In addition to the Mediator subunit homologs, our immunoprecipitation using the α-At1g11760 antibody and the following LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis again identified peptides that map to six of the potential plant-specific Mediator subunits that coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-AtMed6 antibody. Therefore, six of the 14 proteins that were identified as potential Mediator subunits in CITATION were again identified in this second immunoprecipitation (CITATIOND). Because these proteins coimmunoprecipitate with two independent Mediator subunits, we considered them as unique plant Mediator subunits and accordingly we suggest that they are named Med32–Med37 (At1g11760, Med32; At3g23590/At2g48110, Med33a/Med33b; At1g31360, Med34; At1g44910, Med35; At4g25630, Med36; and At5g28540/At5g42020, Med37; see CITATION and CITATIONE). Of these proteins, Med32, Med33a, and Med33b are all encoded by genes that are only found in the plant kingdom.
!~MM~! A. thaliana cell suspension cultures (ecotype Columbia) were grown in MSAR (CITATION). Cells were maintained by weekly subculturing of 7.5 ml saturated culture into 42.5 ml of fresh MSAR and grown at 24°C under continuous light on a gyratory shaker at 120 rpm. They were then harvested by vacuum filtration, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Whole-cell A. thaliana protein extracts were isolated essentially according to a method used for preparation of whole-cell extracts from yeast (CITATION). Briefly, 450 g of A. thaliana cells was disrupted using a Freezer/Mill Model 6850 (SPEXcertiprep) and the homogeneous cell powder was dissolved in 250 ml of 3× lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the clear supernatant (6.3 g of protein) was applied to a 350 ml Biorex-70 column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 700 ml each of buffers A-0.15, A-0.3, and A-0.6, and the AtMed6 and AtMed7 subunits of Mediator were eluted with buffer A-1.2. This eluate (225 ml, 184 mg) was dialyzed and bound batch-wise to 25 ml DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with buffer B-0.1 for 45 min at 4°C. The DEAE-Sephacel was packed in a column and washed with 25 ml of buffer B-0.1, and the AtMed6 and AtMed7 subunits of Mediator were eluted with 50 ml B-0.2. Protein from the B-0.2 peak (20 ml, 12 mg) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. In-gel tryptic digests performed in a similar manner to that described previously (CITATION) were analyzed by reverse-phase LC-MS/MS performed on a capillary HPLC coupled to a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (CapLC Q-TOF Ultima, Waters Corporation) (CITATION). The acquisition of MS/MS spectra was performed with an automated data-directed switching between the MS and MS/MS modes using the instrument software (MassLynx V4.0 SP4). The three most abundant signals of a survey scan (400–1500 m/z range, 0.87 s scan time, and 0.13 s inter delay) were selected by charge state, and collision energy was applied accordingly for sequential MS/MS fragmentation scanning (50–2000 m/z range, 0.9 s scan time, 0.1 s inter delay). Accurate mass determination of the ion from dodecamethyl cyclohexasiloxane (C12H36O6Si6, m/z 445.1206) (CITATION) was used for an offset calibration of the MS channel by combining 30 scans (scans 30–59) of the background signal. Conversion of raw data to peak lists for database searching was performed with the ProteinLynx Global Server software (V2.0.5). Proteins were identified by a local version of the MASCOT search program (v2.1.04; Matrix Science Limited, http://www.matrixscience.com) and the Mascot Daemon application (V2.1.6) using an A. thaliana taxonomy database from TIGR (version 5; 27,855 entries), and supporting searches were performed within ProteinLynx. The following settings were used for the database search: trypsin-specific digestion with one missed cleavage allowed, carbamidomethylated cysteine set as fixed modification (only for 2D gels), and oxidized methionine in variable modification, peptide tolerance set to 40 ppm and fragment tolerance set to 0.08 Da. Peptides with Mascot ion score exceeding the threshold for statistical significance (p < 0.05) were selected. Single peptides matching a protein were manually reprocessed, inspected, and either interpreted as valid or discarded. Additional searches in the NCBI database (downloaded August 28, 2006, 3,952,414 entries) were also performed to identify contaminations (keratin) and immunoglobulin used in the extraction. All proteins identified were scanned against the NCBI database using iterative psi-blast by including homologs from the plants O. sativa, M. trunculata, and/or the slime mold D. discoideum (CITATION). Alignments and visualizations were done using the T-coffee (CITATION) and TeXshade programs (CITATION). Methods for cloning, expression and purification of recombinant proteins, antibody production, affinity purification of antibodies, 2D gel electrophoresis, and immunoprecipitation are provided in the CITATION on the Molecular Cell website.
