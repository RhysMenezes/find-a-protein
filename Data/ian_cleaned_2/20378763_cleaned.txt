!~ABS~! DEAD-box RNA helicases are involved in RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA decay and gene expression. In this study, we identified a homolog of the RH36 gene, AtRH36, which encodes a DEAD-box protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. The gene was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant. The AtRH36 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized in the nucleus. Homozygosity for the Arabidopsis atrh36 mutants, atrh36-1 and atrh36-2, could not be obtained. Progeny of selfed Arabidopsis atrh36 heterozygote plants were obtained at a heterozygote to wild-type ratio of 1 : 1, which suggested that the AtRH36 gene was involved in gametogenesis. Therefore, we performed a reciprocal cross to determine whether AtRH36 was involved in female gametophyte development. Female gametogenesis was delayed in atrh36-1, and asynchronous development of the female gametophytes was found within a single pistil. Knock-down of AtRH36 gave a pleiotropic phenotype and led to the accumulation of unprocessed 18S pre-rRNA. These results suggest that AtRH36 is essential for mitotic division during female gametogenesis and plays an important role in rRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! To study the role of RH36 in plants, a cDNA fragment of AtRH36 was isolated, and found to encode a protein of 491 amino acids with nine conserved RNA helicase motifs and two nuclear localization signals at its C-terminus. The phylogenetic tree of RH36 proteins showed that AtRH36 and OsRH36 were grouped together and were closely related to yeast Dbp8p and human DDX49 (Fig. 1A). The degree of amino acid sequence identity between AtRH36 and OsRH36 was 57%. AtRH36 shared 45% identity and 63% similarity with yeast Dbp8p. With respect to human DDX49, AtRH36 shared 48% identity and 69% similarity.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To determine the subcellular localization of AtRH36, we generated a construct that encoded AtRH36–green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a 35S promoter and introduced the construct into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. In cells transformed with 35S promoter::AtRH36–GFP, the GFP fluorescence signal was only detected in the nucleus, with dense spots which were co-localized with the nucleolus (Fig. 1B–E). In contrast, in cells transformed with 35S promoter::GFP, the GFP fluorescence signal was detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1F, G). These results indicated that AtRH36–GFP fusion protein localized to the nucleus and nucleolus. To determine the expression pattern of the AtRH36 gene in Arabidopsis, reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) was performed. Total RNA was isolated from a variety of tissues, and specific primers were used to detect AtRH36 and Actin (Act1, At2g37620) mRNA. Fig. 1H shows that AtRH36 mRNA was present in all of the organs selected, including rosette leaves, cauline leaves, stems, roots, flowers and siliques. These results indicated that AtRH36 was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant. On the other hand, expression of AtRH36 is induced by glucose from microarray data that are available at the GENEVESTIGATOR database (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) (Fig. 1I). The promoter activity of the AtRH36 genes was analyzed further by using a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter. The AtRH36 promoter (469 bp) was fused upstream of the GUS reporter gene uidA and expressed in Arabidopsis. More than 30 independent transgenic plants were obtained for the expression construct. Three transformants that carried transgenes were selected for further analysis of GUS expression. T2 transgenic Arabidopsis lines that contained the uidA gene driven by the AtRH36 promoter showed GUS expression in most vegetative organs, including roots, cotyledons, leaves, trichomes and inflorescence stems (Fig. 1J–L). GUS activity was also detected in reproductive organs, such as stigmata, anthers, petals and siliques (Fig. 1M, N). Moreover, close observation showed that expression of GUS could be detected in pollen grains, vascular tissues of the stamen, pollen tubes and ovules (Fig. 1O–Q). Therefore, GUS activity could be detected in most organs and tissues of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants, which indicated that the AtRH36 gene was transcribed ubiquitously during different stages of plant development. To elucidate the biological role of AtRH36 in Arabidopsis, three transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion lines, atrh36-1 (Salk_102486), atrh36-2 (Salk_079348) and atrh36-3 (Salk_045190), were identified and characterized (Fig. 2A). The genotypes of the progeny from self-crosses of the atrh36 heterozygous mutants were analyzed by PCR-based screening. The results of this analysis revealed that all 249 analyzed progeny plants from either atrh36-1 or atrh36-2 heterozygous parents were heterozygous or wild type (Fig. 2B, C; Table 1). However, approximately 15% of the progeny from atrh36-3 heterozygous plants were homozygous for the mutant allele (Table 1). The expression level of the AtRH36 transcript in the atrh36-3 homozygous plants was similar to that in the wild type, as shown by RT–PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Moreover, the atrh36-3 homozygous plants did not show morphological differences compared with the wild type plants (Supplementary Fig. S1D, E). Therefore, in the atrh36-3 mutant line, the T-DNA insertion in the promoter region did not affect the expression of the AtRH36 gene, and this might explain why homozygotes were only obtained for the atrh36-3 mutant allele. These results indicated that no homozygous AtRH36 knock-out plant could be obtained among all examined progeny.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To confirm this conclusion, a binary vector that contained the genomic DNA for AtRH36 fused to its own promoter and terminator was transformed into atrh36-1 heterozygous plants for functional complementation (Fig. 2D). Three independent T1 hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected, and the genotypes of the progeny plants were analyzed. The analysis indicated that atrh36-1 homozygous plants were obtained in all selected T2 progeny populations. One example is shown in Fig. 2E; four plants among eight randomly selected hygromycin-resistant T2 plants did not contain the wild-type AtRH36 allele (lines 3, 5, 6 and 7). The observation of homozygous atrh36-1 alleles in transgenic plants indicated that the distorted segregation could be fully complemented by expression of the AtRH36 cDNA. The wild type to heterozygote ratio of the progeny of the atrh36-1 and atrh36-2 heterozygotes was approximately 1 : 1 in Arabidopsis (Table 1); therefore, we hypothesized that AtRH36 might play an essential role in either gametophyte development or fertilization during plant reproduction. To determine whether the distortion in segregation was caused by a developmental defect during gametogenesis, we performed reciprocal crosses between the atrh36-1 heterozygote and wild-type plants, and then counted each genotype among the progeny populations. As shown in Table 2, the F1 progeny population from self-crossed atrh36-1 heterozygous plants segregated with a 1 : 0.83 (53 : 44) ratio of wild-type to heterozygous plants. No transmission of the atrh36-1 allele was observed when the atrh36-1 heterozygote was used as the female parent and backcrossed with the wild type (atrh36-1/AtRH36-1 × AtRH36-1/AtRH36-1 in Table 2). On the other hand, when the atrh36-1 heterozygote was used as the male parent and backcrossed with the wild type, the F1 progeny population segregated in a 1 : 0.79 (181 : 143) ratio of wild-type to heterozygous plants (AtRH36-1/AtRH36-1 × atrh36-1/AtRH36-1 in Table 2). This showed that the transmission rate of the atrh36-1 mutant allele was reduced only slightly compared with that of the wild-type allele. Therefore, we concluded that the atrh36-1 allele could be transmitted through the male but not the female gametophyte.  The roots, leaves, shoots and flowers of atrh36-1 heterozygous plants could not be distinguished morphologically from those of wild-type plants. However, atrh36-1 heterozygous plants produced short siliques (Fig. 3A, B) and had a significant number of aborted seeds (Fig. 3C, D). The length of the siliques from atrh36-1 heterozygotes was approximately two-thirds shorter than that of wild-type plants at the same age (Fig. 3B). Siliques were collected from self-crossed atrh36-1 heterozygotes and the numbers of mature and aborted seeds were counted. The analyzed siliques from the atrh36-1 heterozygous progeny contained 53% (n = 655) mature seeds and 47% (n = 581) aborted seeds, compared with 94.5% (n = 565) mature seeds and 5.5% (n = 33) aborted seeds in the wild-type progeny (Fig. 3D). To address further whether AtRH36 functions in male gametophyte development, the pollen viability of atrh36-1 heterozygote plants was determined by Alexander staining. In Fig. 3E, no obvious difference was found in pollen morphology and pollen viability between the atrh36-1 mutant and the wild type. Moreover, the pollen germination rates in atrh36-1 heterozygote plants were similar to those of wild-type plants (Fig. 3F). Together, these results clearly indicated that mutation of atrh36-1 affected female gametophyte development and slightly impaired male gametophyte development.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The female gametophyte is generated from the functional megaspore via a process called megagametogenesis. Megagametogenesis begins with mitosis, cellularization and degeneration to develop a functional embryo sac that contains an egg cell, two synergid cells and a central cell. CITATION have used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to observe the process of megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis and have divided this process into eight stages: female gametophyte (FG) 1–FG8. To study how the atrh36-1 mutation affects megagametogenesis, we performed CLSM to compare the progress of female gametophyte development in wild-type and atrh36-1 heterozygous plants. Eight stages of megagametogenesis were observed in wild-type plants by CLSM and are shown in Fig. 4. Often two or three sequential developmental stages predominate among ovules within the same pistil in Arabidopsis (Table 3). These results are consistent with the previous finding that the development of ovules within a pistil is synchronous in Arabidopsis (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] For the atrh36-1 mutant, pistils were isolated from flower buds and analyzed by CLSM. The results showed that the development of most mutant embryo sacs was asynchronous (Table 4). Some female gametophytes within a single pistil spanned five or more developmental stages, such as Ps3–Ps6 shown in Table 4. For example, among 30 analyzed ovules from pistil 5 (PS5), four were at stage FG3 (Fig. 5A), eight were at stage FG4 (Fig. 5B), three were at stage FG5 (Fig. 5C), 11 were at stage FG6 (Fig. 5D) and four were at stage FG7 (Fig. 5E).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] After manual pollination, embryogenesis was analyzed in wild-type and atrh36-1 mutant plants. In selected wild-type pistils, all the developing seeds were at the zygote stage with 4- or 8-nucleate endosperm in the embryo sac (Ps8 and Ps9 in Table 3). However, in the pollinated atrh36-1 pistils (Ps7 and Ps8 in Table 4), less than half the ovules developed into seeds that had 4-nucleate (Fig. 5I) or 8-nucleate (Fig. 5J) endosperm in the embryo sac; the rest of the ovules were still at stages FG4 (Fig. 5F), FG5 (Fig. 5G) and FG6 (Fig. 5H). Together, these results indicated that the atrh36-1 mutant ovules showed a delayed progression in the female gametophytic cell cycle. To investigate the role of the AtRH36 gene in whole plants, an inducible RNA interference (RNAi) approach was applied. A 500 bp fragment that corresponded to the 3′ end of the AtRH36 cDNA was cloned in an inverted-repeat orientation that flanked a GFP DNA fragment (as a spacer), under the control of a chimeric promoter that contained the LexA operator fused upstream to a minimal 35S promoter (Fig. 6A). The RNAi construct and an effector plasmid, 35S::XVE, were co-transformed into Arabidopsis. Under selection for kanamycin and hygromycin resistance, six independent transgenic plants (36Ri-1–36Ri-6) that contained both RNAi and effector T-DNA insertions were obtained and verified by genomic DNA PCR analysis. Ten-day-old transgenic seedlings were used to study the expression pattern of AtRH36 and its downstream response. The accumulation of AtRH36 mRNA was reduced dramatically in all the RNAi lines after treatment with β-estradiol, as compared with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Fig. 6B). The root length of the seedlings was reduced significantly in all of the selected AtRH36 knock-down lines, as compared with the wild-type and 35S::XVE transgenic plants (Fig. 6C). To determine whether the short root phenotype observed in the AtRH36 knockdown lines was caused by loss of cell viability, the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) cell viability assay was performed. Cell viability in the root tip was reduced in the AtRH36 knock-down lines, as compared with 35S::XVE transgenic plants (Supplementary Fig. S2). To determine whether AtRH36 affects plant growth and development, seeds from the wild type and from the AtRH36 knockdown lines 36Ri-2 and 36Ri-5 were germinated in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with either β-estradiol or DMSO, and their phenotypes were compared. Seed germination and seedling growth were retarded only in β-estradiol-treated transgenic lines (36Ri-2 and 36Ri-5), but not in wild-type and 35S::XVE transgenic plants (Fig. 6D). In addition, when the 2-week-old 36Ri-5 plants were shifted to medium that contained β-estradiol, short roots, abnormal leaves, accumulation of anthocyanin, delayed reproductive transition and early senescence were observed, as compared with treatment with DMSO (Fig. 6E). Overall, these results indicate that AtRH36 is required for plant growth and development.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In eukaryotic cells, transcription of rDNA generates a 45S rRNA precursor, which comprises 5′ ETS–18S rRNA–ITS1–5.8S rRNA–ITS2–25S rRNA–3′ ETS (ETS, external transcribed sequence; ITS, internal transcribed sequence). 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA are formed by cleavage of the 45S rRNA precursor (Fig. 7A). To determine whether AtRH36 plays a role in Arabidopsis rRNA maturation, the rRNA precursor was analyzed in AtRH36 knock-down lines. Ten-day-old wild-type, 36Ri-2, 36Ri-3 and 36Ri-5 plants were transferred for 5 d to medium that contained either β-estradiol or DMSO. Total RNA was isolated from the roots of each individual line and RT–PCR was performed to evaluate the abundance of the rRNA precursor. Under β-estradiol treatment, the expression of AtRH36 was knocked down significantly, and the level of the rRNA precursor (amplified using two specific primer sets, U2 with U3 and IS1 with IS2) was increased in all three β-estradiol-inducible RNAi plants, as compared with the wild type (Fig. 7B). The specific primers 18SF and 18SR were used to show that an equal amount of total 18S rRNA, which included the mature and immature forms of 18S, was included in all the PCRs. The Actin gene was used as a loading control for the PCR analysis (Figure 7B). Knock-down of AtRH36 expression resulted in accumulation of immature rRNA precursor, which suggested that AtRH36 participates in the processing of 18S rRNA in Arabidopsis.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! We obtained the T-DNA insertion mutants atrh36-1 (SALK_102486), atrh36-2 (SALK_079348) and atrh36-3 (SALK_045190) in the Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL) through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized, incubated at 4°C for 4 d, plated on 1/2 MS medium that contained 0.8% agar supplemented with 1% sucrose, and grown at 22°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Total RNA was prepared from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The full-length AtRH36 cDNA (1,476 bp) was generated by RT–PCR and inserted into the BamHI and SacI sites in pBluescript KS+ to give pBSAtRH36. The pMDC vector series was a gift from Mark Curtis (CITATION, CITATION). The pCAMBIA vector series was obtained from Cambia (Supplementary Data). To make the construct for complementation of the atrh36-1 phenotype, the genomic DNA region of AtRH36 from 469 bp upstream of the start codon to 280 bp downstream of the stop codon was isolated by PCR using Arabidopsis genomic DNA as the template. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a pyT&A cloning vector (Yeastern Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) to generate pAtRH36g. pAtRH36g was digested with BamHI and SacI, and ligated into the binary vector pCAMBIA-1301 to generate p1301AtRH36g. For the AtRH36–GFP fusion construct, the primers AtRH36GF and AtRH36GR were used to amplify AtRH36 cDNA. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the vector pENTR/ SD/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to generate the construct pENTR-AtRH36. pENTR-AtRH36 was used to subclone the AtRH36 cDNA into the destination vector pMDC83 (CITATION) by LR recombination (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), which generated p35SAtRH36-GFP. To synthesize the AtRH36::GUS reporter construct, the 469 bp promoter region of AtRH36 was amplified by PCR using the primers AtRH36p-F and AtRH36p-R. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and NcoI, and ligated into pCAMBIA-1305 to generate p1305AtRH36GUS. To make the AtRH36 RNAi construct, pBSAtRH36 was digested with SacI and EcoRI to isolate the 500 bp 3′ end of the AtRH36 cDNA, ligated as inverted repeats either side of the coding sequence for GFP (as a spacer) and then ligated into pBluescript KS+, to generate pAtRH36RNAi. The 1.7 kb AtRH36RNAi DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with the primer AtRH36RNAi-Topo, and inserted into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector, to generate the construct pENTR-AtRH36RNAi. pENTR-AtRH36RNAi was used to subclone the AtRH36RNAi DNA fragment into the destination vector pMDC221(CITATION) by LR recombination, which generated pLexAAtRH36Ri. For the 35SE::XVE effector construct, the 35S enhancer DNA fragment was amplified using primers 35Se F and 35Se R, and inserted into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector to generate pENTR35SEN. pENTR35SEN was used to subclone the 35S enhancer DNA fragment into the destination vector pMDC150 (CITATION) by LR recombination, which generated p35SXVE. Plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Col-0 or atrh36-1 heterozygous mutant) were transformed using a floral dip method (CITATION). Progeny seedlings were selected on MS medium that contained 30 mg l−1 hygromycin for plants transformed with p1301AtRH36g and with p1305AtRH36GUS, and 25 mg l−1 hygromycin plus 70 mg l−1 kanamycin for plants co-transformed with pLexAAtRH36Ri and p35SXVE. Organs at different developmental stages were harvested from transgenic plants that contained the AtRH36 promoter-driven GUS expression cassette, for analysis of GUS activity. The various organs were incubated in GUS staining solution at 37°C overnight, as described by CITATION. Chlorophyll was then removed with 95% ethanol. The organs were observed and photographed using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with a digital camera. The onion bulb epidermis was prepared and particle bombardment was carried out as CITATION to introduce p35SGFP (a plasmid containing 35S promoter::GFP; a gift from S.-M. Yu) or p35SAtRH36-GFP using a PDS-1000 biolistic device (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 1,100 p.s.i. Bombarded specimens were incubated in MS medium for 2 d, and were then observed with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope. The presence of the T-DNA insertion in the atrh36-1, atrh36-2 and atrh36-3 mutants was verified by PCR using the T-DNA left border primer LBa1 and the AtRH36 gene-specific primers 36-1R and 36-1L for atrh36-1 and atrh36-2, and 36-3R and 36-3L for atrh36-3. To analyze progeny from self-crossing, heterozygous plants were allowed to self-pollinate, and the genotypes of the progeny plants were analyzed. To analyze reciprocal crosses, the wild type (Ler ecotype) or atrh36-1 heterozygotes (Col-0 ecotype) as the female parent were crossed with atrh36-1 or the wild type, respectively, as the male parent. Seeds from different siliques were collected and plated on MS medium. The genotypes of the seedlings were analyzed by PCR. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type and transgenic plants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Possible DNA contamination was removed using RNase-free DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed with an oligo(dT) primer and catalyzed by SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 50-fold dilution of the first-strand cDNA was then subjected to PCR with gene-specific primers. A total of 22–28 reaction cycles of PCR amplification were performed. For the detection of pre-rRNA, first-strand cDNA synthesis was primed with random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and catalyzed by SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The first-strand cDNA was diluted 500-fold and then subjected to PCR with primers designed to detect specific processing of rRNA. The primers 18SF and 18SR were designed to detect total 18S rRNA, including mature 18S rRNA and 18S pre-rRNA. The primers U2 and U3 were designed to bind downstream of the P site to analyze the removal of the 5′ ETS from the pre-rRNA. The primers IS1 and IS2 were designed to analyze the removal of the ITS from the pre-rRNA. Confocal observation of the stages of female gametophyte development was performed as described by CITATION, with the modification that we used a Zeiss LSM510 microscope. Primary inflorescences were isolated from Col-0 and atrh36-1 heterozygous plants to identify the female gametophyte phenotype. Pistils from the same inflorescence were collected, fixed, and opened to dissect out ovules. Ovules were cleared in 2 : 1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate : benzyl alcohol and sealed under coverslips. The number of nuclei in the ovules of Col-0 and atrh36-1 plants was determined by analyzing serial optical sections of images captured on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope with Zeiss LSM Image Browser software.
