!~ABS~! The CCT (for CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1) domain is found in 45 Arabidopsis thaliana proteins involved in processes such as photoperiodic flowering, light signaling, and regulation of circadian rhythms. We show that this domain exhibits similarities to yeast HEME ACTIVATOR PROTEIN2 (HAP2), which is a subunit of the HAP2/HAP3/HAP5 trimeric complex that binds to CCAAT boxes in eukaryotic promoters. Moreover, we demonstrate that CONSTANS (CO), which promotes Arabidopsis flowering, interacts with At HAP3 and At HAP5 in yeast, in vitro, and in planta. Mutations in CO that delay flowering affect residues highly conserved between CCT and the DNA binding domain of HAP2. Taken together, these data suggest that CO might replace At HAP2 in the HAP complex to form a trimeric CO/At HAP3/At HAP5 complex. Flowering was delayed by overexpression of At HAP2 or At HAP3 throughout the plant or in phloem companion cells, where CO is expressed. This phenotype was correlated with reduced abundance of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) mRNA and no change in CO mRNA levels. At HAP2 or At HAP3 overexpression may therefore impair formation of a CO/At HAP3/At HAP5 complex leading to reduced expression of FT. During plant evolution, the number of genes encoding HAP proteins was greatly amplified, and these proteins may have acquired novel functions, such as mediating the effect of CCT domain proteins on gene expression.
!~RES~! To better understand the biochemical function of CO, a yeast two-hybrid library was screened to identify proteins that interact with the CCT domain (see Methods). Five clones that expressed At HAP5 homologs (At3g48590 [twice], At1g54830 [twice], and At1g56170) and one clone that expressed At HAP3a (At2g38880) were identified. In yeast, HAP2, HAP3, and HAP5 form a complex that interacts with DNA via the HAP2 subunit (CITATION). The observation that CO interacts with At HAP3 and At HAP5 suggested that CO might act as a novel HAP2 subunit and replace At HAP2 in a modified HAP complex. Twenty-six proteins proposed to be At HAP3 and At HAP5 subunits are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. In addition, there are 16 additional CO-LIKE (COL) genes of Arabidopsis that all encode related CCT domains, suggesting that these might also interact with the HAP complex. To provide an indication of the full extent of the interactions between the CCT domain proteins and the At HAP proteins, 18 At HAP proteins (nine At HAP3 and nine At HAP5) were tested in yeast for their ability to interact with the CCT domains of CO and a second COL protein, COL15. These experiments demonstrated that CO and COL15 can interact with several At HAP3 and At HAP5 homologs (Table 1 ). Therefore, the interactions between the At HAP and COL families of proteins in planta could be complex, with multiple At HAP proteins able to interact with several COL proteins. Interactions of HAP Proteins with the CCT Domains of CO and COL15 Detected Using the Yeast Two-Hybrid System The interactions observed in yeast occurred in the presence of the yeast HAP proteins. Therefore, the ability of CO to interact directly with each of the At HAP subunits was tested in vitro where individual interactions could be assessed. CO was expressed in vitro as a fusion protein with the Gal4 activation domain (GAD). GAD:CO was combined with At HAP2a, At HAP3a, or At HAP5a and precipitated using a GAD-specific antibody (Figures 1A to 1C ). At HAP3a (Figure 1B) and At HAP5a (Figure 1C) were coimmunoprecipitated with GAD:CO, indicating that they interact with GAD:CO in this assay. At HAP3a and At HAP5a were also combined simultaneously with GAD:CO, and both proteins were immunoprecipitated with GAD:CO. This experiment indicated that At HAP3a and At HAP5a do not compete for the same binding site on GAD:CO and that CO may bind the At HAP3/At HAP5 dimer in a similar way to HAP2. By contrast, coimmunoprecipitation of At HAP2a and GAD:CO was barely detectable (Figure 1A), suggesting that At HAP2a did not interact with GAD:CO or did so to a much lesser extent than At HAP3a and At HAP5a. Furthermore, when At HAP2a, At HAP3a, and At HAP5a were added simultaneously to GAD:CO in the immunoprecipitation reaction, At HAP2a was coprecipitated to a much lesser extent than At HAP3a and At HAP5a, indicating that GAD:CO does not bind to the trimeric HAP complex (Figure 1D). Mutations that impair the function of the CO CCT domain were identified because they delay flowering (Figure 2A ), and one of these, co-9, was tested for its effect on coimmunoprecipitation of the At HAP5a and At HAP3a proteins. GAD:co-9 coprecipitated At HAP5a and At HAP3a to a similar extent to GAD:CO (Figure 1E), indicating that the co-9 mutation does not abolish interaction with these proteins in this assay, although it does strongly affect CO function in planta. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The yeast two-hybrid and in vitro experiments suggested that CO interacts with At HAP3/At HAP5 in an analogous way to the At HAP2 subunit. This hypothesis was supported by detailed comparisons of HAP2 and COL protein sequences that identified a domain of homology that is shared by these proteins and was not previously detected. The highly conserved core region of the HAP2 protein contains two functionally important subdomains named NF-YA1 and NF-YA2 that are connected by a small linker sequence (CITATION). The NF-YA1 subdomain forms an α helix proposed to interact with the HAP3/HAP5 dimer, whereas NF-YA2 was modeled to interact with the DNA of the CCAAT box (CITATION). The CCT domain contains a region of striking similarity to NF-YA2 as well as a lower degree of conservation to the linker domain and NF-YA1 (Figure 2A). Mutational analysis of the NF-YA1 domain of yeast HAP2 identified several residues that are required for the formation of the trimeric complex. One of the residues that strongly affected complex assembly was the Arg residue Arg-12 (Figure 2). The R12G mutation abolished HAP complex formation, resulting in loss of DNA binding (CITATION). Interestingly, Arg-12 is conserved among all HAP and CCT domain proteins and defines the start of the CCT domain (CITATION). Furthermore, in a 23–amino acid segment of the NF-YA2 domain, seven amino acids are identical in all CCT domain and At HAP2 proteins (Figure 2A). Six of these seven residues are important for DNA binding of NF-YA2, and four are altered by mutations that impair the function of the CCT domain in different proteins. Residues important for CCT function and conserved with residues important for DNA binding of HAP2 are the Ala affected in toc1-1 (CITATION) and co-9 and the Gly affected in ppdH-1 (CITATION). The Arg affected in co-7 (CITATION) and vrn2 (CITATION) is absolutely conserved in all of the CCT domain and At HAP2 proteins and is proposed to be involved in DNA binding of HAP2 (CITATION). Similarly, mutations in HAP2 that alter the Pro analogous to the Pro affected in the co-5 mutation (CITATION) do not affect DNA binding (CITATION). This residue is not conserved in all of the NF-YA2 domains of HAP2 proteins but is present in 18 of the 28 NF-YA2 sequences shown in Figure 2A. The mutation causes a weak delay in flowering, suggesting that it is not as essential as the absolutely conserved residues identified as mutations (CITATION). These results indicate that functionally important domains within HAP2 and the CCT domain of CO share homology and that the most conserved residues are important for the function of the CCT domain. To determine whether the NF-YA2 subdomain of HAP2 and the related region of the CCT domain of CO are predicted to form similar three-dimensional structures, the Rosetta program was employed (see Methods). This analysis predicted that the NF-YA2 subdomain of HAP2 forms two short α helices, as previously proposed (CITATION; Figure 2B). The homologous region of CO is also predicted to form two α helices. Furthermore, in HAP2 three of the residues predicted to interact with DNA (Arg-14, Ala-18, and Arg-21) are on the same side of one of the α helices, and the analogous residues in CO are similarly positioned (Figure 2B). These observations suggest that this region of CO would form a similar structure to NF-YA2; therefore, CO might interact with DNA in a similar way as proposed for HAP2 (CITATION). To test the significance of the similarities between CO and HAP2 in plants, we first tested whether CO interacts with At HAP3a and At HAP5a in plant cells as shown in yeast and in vitro. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP):CO protein and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fusion proteins with At HAP3a or At HAP5a were expressed in Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells after bombardment and detected using a confocal microscope. YFP:CO and the CFP:At HAP proteins colocalized in the nuclei of Arabidopsis epidermal cells (Figure 3A ). [[FIGURE]] Whether the protein interactions observed in yeast and in vitro also occur in planta was determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET was detected between YFP:CO and each of the CFP-labeled At HAP subunits (Figures 3B and 3C), indicating that CO is likely to interact with At HAP3a/At HAP5a in planta. Much weaker FRET signals were detected in negative control experiments employing YFP and CFP alone, or YFP:CO and CFP (Figure 3B). Whether known mutations in the CCT domain that caused delayed flowering in Arabidopsis (co-7 and co-9) also caused a decrease in FRET efficiency was then tested. YFP:co-7 and YFP:co-9 both produced strong FRET signals with CFP:At HAP3a and CFP:At HAP5a (Figures 3B and 3C). These results indicate that co-7 and co-9 do not prevent interaction with At HAP3a and At HAP5a in plant cells as observed in vitro for co-9. CO mRNA abundance is regulated by GIGANTEA (GI) (CITATION; CITATION). To test whether any of the At HAP genes were also regulated by GI, Affymetrix arrays were hybridized with probes derived from 35S:GI and wild-type plants. CO mRNA levels are increased in 35S:GI plants (CITATION), and the array data were analyzed to determine whether any At HAP genes were also increased in expression in these plants. The mRNA of the At HAP3a (At2g38880) gene was more than threefold more abundant than in wild-type plants, suggesting it was also regulated by GI (Figure 4A ). The levels of At HAP3a mRNA were then tested by RT-PCR in RNA extracted from LD-grown Landsberg erecta, gi-3, and 35S:GI seedlings at 4-h intervals over 24 h. In wild-type plants, At HAP3a mRNA levels showed a diurnal rhythm, with a peak at 16 h after dawn (Figure 4B). This peak was absent in gi-3 mutant plants. In plants overexpressing GI from the 35S promoter, expression levels of At HAP3a mRNA were significantly higher at all times of the day but showed highest levels at 16 h after dawn. Therefore, At HAP3a mRNA peaks in abundance ∼16 h after dawn, a similar time in the diurnal cycle to the first peak in the biphasic pattern of CO mRNA accumulation, and both genes are regulated by GI. [[FIGURE]] The protein–protein interaction data described above suggest that CO participates in a protein complex that includes At HAP3 and At HAP5. To test the significance of this protein complex in flowering-time regulation, loss-of-function T-DNA mutations in At HAP3a, which is regulated by GI, were characterized. Plants carrying a T-DNA insertion allele of At HAP3a flowered at the same time as wild-type plants (see Methods; GABI-KAT line 769B07 carrying an insertion in the coding sequence). However, the large number of genes encoding At HAP3 and At HAP5 subunits in Arabidopsis that are coexpressed with CO in the phloem (CITATION) and the ability of CO to interact with several At HAP3 and At HAP5 subunits in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table 1) suggested that there may be genetic redundancy between these genes in the regulation of flowering time. The likely genetic redundancy between genes encoding subunits of At HAP3 or At HAP5 suggested an alternative approach to test the requirement of these subunits for CO function. We reasoned that since At HAP2 also interacts with At HAP3 and At HAP5, then At HAP2 may compete with CO for binding of the At HAP3 and At HAP5 subunits. CO is expressed in the phloem companion cells; therefore, two At HAP2 genes (At5g12840 [AtHAP2a] and At2g34720) were fused to the SUC2 promoter to drive their expression at high levels in these cells. The At HAP2a mRNA contains a binding site for microRNA169 in the 3′ untranslated region (CITATION). This binding site was removed to allow expression of high levels of At HAP2a in the phloem by the SUC2:At HAP2a fusion. Transformants containing either construct flowered late under LDs (Figures 5A and 5B ) SUC2:At HAP2a delayed flowering more severely and in a higher proportion of transformants than SUC2:At2g34720 (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). This might be due to the striking sequence similarity between this specific At HAP2 gene and CO, which extends outside of the NF-YA2 domain (Figure 2A). The involvement of At HAP2a in causing this late-flowering phenotype was supported by the correlation between the abundance of At HAP2a transcript and the severity of the phenotype observed in individual lines. Furthermore, FT transcript levels in a late-flowering line homozygous for the SUC2:At HAP2a construct were fourfold to fivefold lower compared with the wild type, whereas CO mRNA levels were not changed (Figure 5E). Under SDs SUC2:HAP2a#1 plants were not later flowering than wild-type plants, although they were strongly delayed under LDs (Figures 5B and 5C). Therefore, SUC2:At HAP2a impairs flowering under the conditions in which CO acts to promote flowering. These observations suggest that SUC2:At HAP2a plants are delayed in flowering under LDs because CO activation of FT transcription is impaired. [[FIGURE]] Whether reducing the levels of At HAP2 subunits accelerates flowering by reducing competition with CO for At HAP3/At HAP5 was also tested. Lines containing T-DNA insertions in At HAP2a and At2g34720 (CITATION; CITATION) were characterized for alteration in flowering time under LDs. Homozygous plants containing a T-DNA insertion within an exon of At2g34720 (Salk line N644313, T-DNA insertion in exon 6) showed no detectable accumulation of the At2g34720 transcript (data not shown) but did not display an obvious flowering-time phenotype. A previously characterized T-DNA insertion within the 5′ untranslated region of At HAP2a (EMB2220; http://www.seedgenes.org) causes female gametophyte lethality; therefore, the flowering phenotype caused by a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in this gene could not be tested. To determine whether elevating the expression levels of At HAP3a would cause early flowering, as observed for 35S:CO plants, the At HAP3 subunit was overexpressed from the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV35S) and in the phloem from the SUC2 promoter. In addition, a FLAG:At HAP3a fusion protein was expressed from the CaMV35S promoter. Unexpectedly, overexpression of both At HAP3a and FLAG:At HAP3a caused late flowering under LDs (Figures 6A and 6B ). Two of six 35S:At HAP3a transgenic lines flowered significantly later than wild-type plants under LDs, as did one of four SUC2:At HAP3a lines. Approximately 63% of the 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a T1 plants (n = 107) were late flowering under LDs. In addition, ∼20% of 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a T1 lines showed other phenotypes, such as growth arrest of the shoot apical meristem and the formation of club-shaped siliques from which new inflorescences developed (data not shown). Under SDs, only a slight delay in flowering was observed for the most severely delayed transformants under LDs. Five representative late-flowering lines in which the transgene was present at a single locus were selected for molecular analysis. The involvement of FLAG:At HAP3a in causing the late-flowering phenotype was supported by a correlation between the abundance of FLAG:At HAP3a protein and the severity of the phenotype in individual lines (Figures 6D and 6E). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether FLAG:At HAP3a delays flowering by antagonizing CO function, FT and CO mRNA levels were tested in late-flowering 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a plants. FT mRNA abundance was significantly lower in 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a plants than in the wild type (Figure 6G), but CO mRNA levels were not reduced in 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a plants (Figure 6F). These observations suggest that the late-flowering phenotype of these plants is caused by reduced CO activity leading to reduced FT expression. Overexpression of At HAP3a might sequester CO into nonfunctional complexes. To test this hypothesis, the abundance of CO relative to FLAG:At HAP3a was increased by constructing 35S:CO 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a plants by crossing. The flowering times of homozygous F3 lines were measured and showed that overexpression of CO can attenuate the late flowering caused by high expression of FLAG:At HAP3a (Figures 6H and 6I), consistent with the idea that 35S:FLAG:At HAP3a delays flowering by sequestering CO into inactive complexes and that increasing the abundance of CO overcomes this effect. The association of FLAG:At HAP3a with the FT promoter was tested in early- and late-flowering transgenic plants by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). No association of FLAG:At HAP3a with the FT promoter could be demonstrated in the assay, although positive control reactions were successful (data not shown). These experiments may have failed due to the low abundance of the protein complex or because the complex does not bind directly to the FT promoter.
!~MM~! The yeast two-hybrid screen that identified At HAP5a interacting with CO was performed using the CCT domain (amino acids 306 to 373) of CO cloned into pAS2.1, yielding an in-frame fusion with the Gal4-DNA binding domain. The construct was transformed into yeast (PJ694A) and mated with Y187 harboring two different cDNA libraries cloned into pGAD-T7 (shoot apex and total plant libraries; kind gift from Hans Sommer, Max Planck Institute für Züchtungsforschung, Cologne, Germany). Which HAP protein interacts with the CCT domains of CO and COL15 was tested using the PROQUEST system (Invitrogen). The CCT domains of CO (amino acids 306 to 348) and COL15 (amino acids 281 to 323) were recombined into the pDEST32 vector using the LR recombinase mix from Invitrogen. The HAP proteins were taken as entry clones from the REGIA transcription factor library (in pDONR201) and recombined into pDEST22 using LR recombinase. Baits were transformed in the MAV203 yeast strain and tested for autoactivation before transformation of the HAP plasmids. The screen was performed on SD medium lacking His, Leu, and Trp plus 30 mM 3-aminotriazole. The cDNAs of HAP proteins were recombined into pTNT-GW, and the CO cDNA was introduced into the pTNTGAD-GW vector, providing an in-frame fusion to the GAD domain using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). Prey and bait proteins were synthesized in the presence of 35S-Met using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). Coimmunoprecipitations were performed as described by CITATION. Protein extraction and ChIP assays were performed as described (CITATION). For protein gel blotting, 5 μg of nuclear extract was blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after SDS-PAGE and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich F3165) and rabbit anti-histone 3 (Upstate 050499) simultaneously. Proteins were visualized and quantified after incubation with anti-rabbit IRDye800 (Rockland 611-132-122) and anti-mouse AlexaFluor680 (Invitrogen AL1055) secondary antibodies in an Odyssey infrared scanner. All antibodies were used as 1:5000 dilutions. To generate fluorescent proteins, the pENSG-YFP:GW and pENSG-CFP:GW vectors were used, yielding N-terminal fusions of YFP/CFP driven by the 35S promoter (kind gift from Nieves Medina-Escobar, Max Planck Institute für Züchtungsforschung). Transformation, subcellular localization, and FRET experiments were performed as described by CITATION. Plants used for gene expression and ChIP analysis were grown on germination medium plates containing 1% sucrose. After ethanol sterilization, seeds were spread on plates, stratified for 3 d at 4°C, and finally transferred to growth chambers with LD (16 h/8 h dark) or SD (8 h light/16 h dark) regimes at 22°C. The mutation described in the text as co-9 was identified as a mutation in a 35S∷CO transgene as part of a screen for suppressors of the 35S∷CO phenotype (R. Hayama and G. Coupland, unpublished data). To generate transgenic plants overexpressing the cDNAs encoding At HAP3a and At HAP2a, the Gateway recombination system was used. The open reading frame for the At HAP3a entry clone was recombined into the pLeela binary vector and into pJAN33 to create the fusion to the FLAG tag. The SUC2∷AtHAP2a fusion was constructed by recombining the At HAP2a open reading frame into a modified pGREEN vector in which the SUC2 promoter was inserted upstream of the GATEWAY recombination site (L. Gissot and G. Coupland, unpublished). These constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were made using the floral dip method. T1 transgenic plants were isolated after selection with BASTA and lines that contained the T-DNA at a single locus confirmed by following the segregation ratio in the T2 generation. Flowering times were scored either in homozygous T3 families or by scoring BASTA-resistant T2 plants. For flowering-time experiments, seeds were sown on soil, cold-treated for 3 d at 4°C, transferred to Percival growth chambers, and grown in the desired light regime (SD or LD) at 20°C. Flowering time was determined by counting the number of rosette leaves at bolting and the number of cauline leaves after bolting. In all experiments except the one shown in Figure 5E, plant material grown on plates was harvested 12 d after transfer to the growth chambers, and RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was DNaseI treated and phenol/chlorophorm extracted. RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR reactions were performed on an iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and data analysis was performed using Bio-Rad iQ5 software. The following primers were used for real-time quantitative PCR: β-tubulin forward, 5′-ACACCAGACATAGTAGCAGAAATCAAG-3′; β-tubulin reverse, 5′-ACTCGTTGGGAGGAGGAACT-3′; CO forward, 5′-TAAGGATGCCAAGGAGGTTG-3′; CO reverse, 5′-CCCTGAGGAGCCATATTTGA-3′; FT forward, 5′-CGAGTAACGAACGGTGATGA-3′; FT reverse, 5′-CGCATCACACACTATATAAGTAAAACA-3′; HAP3a forward, 5′-GCGTTGCCTCCTAATGGTAA-3′; HAP3a reverse, 5′-ACCCTCCAACTCCCTGTACC-3′. In the experiment presented in Figure 5E, cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA according to CITATION. Real-time quantitative PCR reactions were performed using kits from Abgene UK: ABsolute SYBR Green Mix kit (AB-1162) for reactions with Syber-Green (β-tubulin and At HAP2a) and ABsolute QPCR mix (AB-1138A) for reactions with Taqman probes (FT and CO). Reactions were run on a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene 2000 cycler. Quantification of each gene was performed using Corbett Research Rotor-Gene software as described by CITATION. The forward primer used for β-tubulin (At5G62690) gene expression was 5′-AAACTCACTACCCCCAGCTTTG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CACCAGACATAGTAGCAGAAATCAAGT-3′. The forward primer used for At HAP2a (At5g12840) was 5′-GGAAAGTCATCCGGGACAGAAAGC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TTTCTTCGCAAACCGGCCTCCA-3′. The Taqman probe used for FT expression was 5′-CCTTTGGCAATGAGATTGTGTGTTACGAAAAT-3′, the forward primer was 5′-GATATCCCTGCTACAACTGGAACA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAATTCCTGCAGTGGGACTTG-3′. The Taqman probe used for CO expression was 5′-TTCCATTAACCATAACGCATACATTTCATCCATG-3′, the forward primer was 5′-CAGGGACTCACTACAACGACAATG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TCCGGCACAACACCAGTTT-3′. Protein structures were ab initio predicted using the Rosetta program (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION, CITATION) and the resulting pdb-files analyzed using PYMOL.
