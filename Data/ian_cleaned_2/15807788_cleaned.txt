!~ABS~! The small GTPase Ran is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, nuclear envelope (NE) formation, and cell-cycle control. In vertebrates, these functions are controlled by a three-dimensional gradient of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP, established by the spatial separation of Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) and the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1. While this spatial separation is established by the NE during interphase, it is orchestrated during mitosis by association of RCC1 with the chromosomes and RanGAP with the spindle and kinetochores. SUMOylation of vertebrate RanGAP1 is required for NE, spindle, and centromere association. Arabidopsis RanGAP1 (AtRanGAP1) lacks the SUMOylated C-terminal domain of vertebrate RanGAP, but contains a plant-specific N-terminal domain (WPP domain), which is necessary and sufficient for its targeting to the NE in interphase. Here we show that the human and plant RanGAP-targeting domains are kingdom specific. AtRanGAP1 has a mitotic trafficking pattern uniquely different from that of vertebrate RanGAP, which includes targeting to the outward-growing rim of the cell plate. The WPP domain is necessary and sufficient for this targeting. Point mutations in conserved residues of the WPP domain also abolish targeting to the nuclear rim and the cell plate, suggesting that the same mechanism is involved in both targeting events. These results indicate that plant and animal RanGAPs undergo different migration patterns during cell division, which require their kingdom-specific targeting domains.

!~MM~! pRTL-AtRanGAP1-GFP (CITATION) and pDsRed-hRanGAP1 (CITATION) were described previously. For cloning of the AtRanGAP1 coding sequence into a mammalian expression vector, the NcoI fragment was filled in and ligated into the SmaI site of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to obtain pEGFP-AtRanGAP1. This provides expression of AtRanGAP1 as a fusion protein with GFP at its C-terminus. For cloning of the HsRanGAP1 coding sequence into a plant expression vector, the coding sequence was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GAAGATCTATGGCCTCGGAAGACATTG-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTGACCTTGTACAGCGTCTGC-3′ and cloned into the BglII site of pRTL2-mGFPS65T (CITATION) using the internal BglII sites of the PCR primers to obtain pRTL-HsRanGAP1-GFP. This provides expression of HsRanGAP1 as a fusion protein with GFP at its N-terminus. For stable BY-2 cell transformation, the fragments of AtRanGAP1-GFP, AtRanGAP1ΔC-GFP, AtRanGAP1ΔN-GFP (CITATION), AtRanGAP1 (mu3, mu6 and mu7)-GFP (see below) and free GFP (mGFPS65T) were digested with XhoI and partially with XbaI (RanGAP1 has an internal XbaI site) and cloned into XhoI and SpeI in the binary vector pFGC1008 (http://www.arabidopsis.org). The same constructs were used to transform Arabidopsis plants. Point mutations were introduced into AtRanGAP1-GFP as described previously (CITATION) using the following mutagenic primers and their respective reverse primers (introduced nucleotide changes are underlined) – mu1: 5′-CAGAACCGTGTTTTGGCAGTGAAGATGTGG-3′; mu2: 5′-GTCAGTGAAGATGGCGGCACCGAGTAAGAG-3′; mu3: 5′-CGAGTAAGAGTGCCGCTCTCATGCTTGTTG-3′; mu4: 5′-CTCATGCTTGTTGAGGCGATGACCAAGAAC-3′; mu5: 5′-CTTCTCCAGGAAGGCCGCTCTTTTGTCTG-3′; mu6: 5′-CGCCAAGCGCGCTGCAGATTTGGCCTTTG-3′; mu7: 5′-CTGCTGTTCACGTCGCTGCTAAAGAATCC-3′; mu8: 5′-CACGTCTATGCTAAAGCATCCAGCAAGCTC-3′; mu9: 5′-CTATGCTAAAGAATCCGCCAAGCTCATGCTTG-3′; mu11: 5′-GTCTGTTGAAGAGTCTGAGCAAGACGCCAAG-3′; mu12: 5′-GGCTGAGCAAGACTCCAAGCGCATTGAAG-3′. The mutations were designed to replace residues in the wild-type sequence with either alanine (mu1–9) or serine (mu11 and 12) and were confirmed by sequencing. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium (BioFluids, Rockville, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini-bioproducts, Calabasas, CA, USA) at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells grown on cover slips were co-transfected with pEGFP-AtRanGAP1 and pDsRed-hRanGAP1 using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min (Figures 1a–c) or permeabilized with 0.005% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in transport buffer [110 mm KOAc, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 μg ml−1 each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin] for 5 min and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Figure 1d–g) 48 h after transfection. Samples were stained with DAPI for visualizing DNA and mounted in Vactashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA) and images were collected and analyzed with Openlab software. Arabidopsis plants (CITATION) and tobacco BY-2 suspension culture cells (CITATION) were cultured as described previously. Green Arabidopsis suspension culture cells were cultured in Gamborg's B-5 Basal medium with minimal organics (Caisson Laboratories, Rexburg, ID, USA) supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose, 5 μm 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetid acid, and 0.05% (w/v) MES, pH 5.7. Cultures were maintained by shaking at 200 rpm in constant light at 24°C and subcultured weekly by 1:10 dilution with fresh medium. Four- to five-day-old Arabidopsis suspension culture cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 300 g, washed once with the same volume (0.4 m mannitol/20 mm MES, pH 5.5), and incubated at room temperature on a platform shaker at 150 rpm in 1% cellulase, 0.1% pectolyase (Karlan, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) in the same volume (0.4 m mannitol/20 mm MES, pH 5.5). After completion of protoplast formation (2–5 h, monitored via microscopy), protoplasts were harvested through centrifugation for 5 min at 150 g, washed once with 1/2 volume ice-cold W5 medium (154 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 6), resuspended in ice-cold W5 medium at a concentration of 3–5 × 106 cells ml−1, and incubated on ice for 2 h. Immediately prior to transformation, the protoplasts were harvested at 4°C and resuspended in ice-cold MaMg solution (0.4 m mannitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MES, pH 5.6). 20 μg DNA, 300 μl protoplast suspension and 300 μl of 40% PEG-6000 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA) in 0.1 m Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 m mannitol, pH 8.0, were mixed by gentle inversion at room temperature for 30 min. The suspension was slowly diluted with 8 ml W5 medium and the protoplasts harvested via centrifugation for 5 min at 50 g. After removal of the supernatant, the transformed protoplasts were resuspended in 4 ml Gamborg's medium containing 0.4 m mannitol and incubated in the dark for 48 h prior to microscopy. Transient transformation of BY-2 cells was performed using a biolistic DNA delivery method essentially as described previously for NT-1 cells (CITATION). For stable transformation of BY-2 cells, all constructs of AtRanGAP1-GFP, AtRanGAP1ΔC-GFP, AtRanGAP1ΔN-GFP, AtRanGAP1 (mu3, mu6 and mu7)-GFP and free GFP (mGFPS65T) in pFGC1008 were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain LBA4404) and colonies were selected with 8.5 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol and 50 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of BY-2 cells was performed as described by CITATION. Transformed calli were selected on MS agar plates containing 25 μg ml−1 of hygromycin and 250 μg ml−1 of carbenicilline after 4 weeks. The selected calli were transferred to new MS agar plates containing the same concentration of antibiotics as above. After 1 week, calli were transferred into MS liquid media containing 20 μg ml−1 of hygromycin to establish suspension cultures. Synchronization of BY-2 cells was performed essentially as described by CITATION with the following modifications. Seven-day-old BY-2 cells were transferred to 45 ml of fresh MS medium and 5 μg ml−1 of aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO was added. Twenty-four hours after incubation in the dark, cells were collected by filtering through sterile miracloth and washed with 200 ml of fresh MS medium. Cells were transferred into 100 ml of fresh MS medium and were continuously cultured. About 50% of M-phase cells, about 30% of late G2 phase and about 10% of G1 phase could be identified after 10 h release from aphidicolin. For improved synchronization, 5 h after release from aphidicolin, 50 ml of the culture was transferred to a new flask and 1.54 μg ml−1 of propyzamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO was added. After 4 h of continued culture in the presence of propyzamide, cells were washed as described above and transferred to fresh medium. Two hours after release from propyzamide, more than 60% of M-phase cells, about 20% of late G2 phase and about 10% of G1 phase were typically detected. SYTO 82 orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was used to stain nucleic acids as described previously (CITATION), using either 500 nm SYTO 82 for 45 min or 1 μm of SYTO 82 for 5–10 min. Digitized confocal images were acquired on a PCM2000/Nikon Eclipse E600 confocal laser scanning microscope as previously described (CITATION). For preparing Z-series of images and 3-D movies, the software ‘Simple PCI’ (Compix Imaging System, Cranberry Township, PA, USA) was used. For Z-series, images were scanned in 0.75 μm interval optical sections using a 40X objective lens and 2X rolling average image processing. For 3-D movies, optical sections were stacked with a setting of 0.3 μm for the pixel size (X–Y) and 0.75 μm for the step size (Z). The image field (X–Y) and range of optical sections (Z) were chosen for the best representation of the cell plates. Fixation of BY-2 cells and Arabidopsis root tips, and immunolabeling of Arabidopsis root tips were carried out essentially as described by CITATION and CITATION with the following modifications. To fix BY-2 cells expressing AtRanGAP1-GFP, synchronized cells were incubated with a fixative containing 3.7% of paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid and 5 mm EGTA in PBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature and the fixative was washed out with PBS three times for 10 min each. The cells were kept in PBS at 4°C before observation of GFP fluorescence. Two-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in MS liquid media by shaking at 200 rpm in constant light at 24°C. Seedlings were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.4% Triton X-100. The fixative was removed by three 10-min washes in PBS. Cells were treated with 1% cellulase, 0.1% pectolyase (Karlan), 0.4 m mannitol, 20 mm MES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF and 5 μl ml−1 of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min to digest cell walls. Cells were washed three times for 10 min each with PBS, attached to poly-l-Lys-coated slides and semi-dried. Cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and washed three times for 10 min each. Blocking was carried out with 0.05% Tween-20, 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Cells were labeled with the primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-AtRanGAP1) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA overnight at 4°C. The specimens were then washed three times for 10 min each with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with FITC-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA. The specimens were washed with PBS two times for 20 min and incubated with 10 μg ml−1 of propidium iodide in water for 10 min and washed with PBS two times for 20 min. The specimens were mounted with mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and the slides were placed in the dark for at least 1 h before observation under the confocal microscope. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described in CITATION. The anti-AtRanGAP1 antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution and anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal (Molecular Probes) was used at a 1:1500 dilution.
