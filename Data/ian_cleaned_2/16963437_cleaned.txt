!~ABS~! Jasmonic acid (JA) is a lipid-derived signal that regulates a wide variety of developmental and defense-related processes in higher plants. JA is synthesized from linolenic acid via an enzymatic pathway that initiates in the plastid and terminates in peroxisomes. The C18 JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) is converted in the peroxisome to 3-oxo-2-(2′-[Z]-pentenyl)cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0), which subsequently undergoes three rounds of β-oxidation to yield JA. Although most JA biosynthetic enzymes have been identified, several key steps in the pathway remain to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we employed co-expression analysis to identify genes that are coordinately regulated with known JA biosynthetic components in Arabidopsis. Among the candidate genes uncovered by this approach was a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like member of the acyl-activating enzyme (AAE) gene family, which we have named OPC-8:0 CoA Ligase1 (OPCL1). In response to wounding, opcl1 null mutants exhibited reduced levels of JA and hyperaccumulation of OPC-8:0. Recombinant OPCL1 was active against both OPDA and OPC-8:0, as well as medium-to-long straight-chain fatty acids. Subcellular localization studies with green fluorescent protein-tagged OPCL1 showed that the protein is targeted to peroxisomes. These findings establish a physiological role for OPCL1 in the activation of JA biosynthetic precursors in leaf peroxisomes, and further indicate that OPC-8:0 is a physiological substrate for the activation step. The results also demonstrate the utility of co-expression analysis for identification of factors that contribute to jasmonate homeostasis. 
!~RES~! Identification of an AAE Gene That Is Co-regulated with Other JA Biosynthetic Genes—To facilitate the discovery of new genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis, we took advantage of the fact that many components of the pathway are coordinately regulated in Arabidopsis (30, 32, 41, 42). The data-mining tool Expression Angler uses publicly available Affymetrix Arabidopsis GeneChip data to compare the expression pattern of a given query gene to all other elements in the data set (27). Query of data sets from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center's microarray data base (NASCArrays) (43) with OPR3 (At2g06050), a well characterized gene involved in the peroxisomal stage of JA synthesis, identified 67 co-expressed genes (Pearson correlation coefficient (r) > 0.75). The complete list of these genes is given in supplemental Table S1. Among these are genes encoding known or putative JA biosynthetic enzymes including 13-lipoxygenases (At1g72520, At1g17420), AOC (At3g25780), and AOS (At5g42650). One of the highest ranking genes (At1g20510) on the list is a member of the 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL)-like family of AAEs (Fig. 1). A potential role for 4CL-like AAEs in JA biosynthesis is supported by two lines of evidence. First, all eight members of this clade contain a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 motif (44, 45). Second, two members (At4g05160 and At5g63380) of this group were previously shown to encode peroxisomal enzymes that activate JA precursors in vitro (Fig. 1) (39). Results obtained with Expression Angler showed that At1g20510, but not At4g05160 nor At5g63380, are co-expressed with OPR3 in tissue-specific data sets, stress and pathogen-related data sets, and hormone application experiments (supplemental Table S2; data not shown). Based on the results presented below, we propose the trivial name OPC-8:0 CoA Ligase1 (OPCL1) to describe the biochemical function of At1g20510.    [[FIGURE]] Co-expression of OPCL1 with OPR3 in wound- and JA-treated Arabidopsis leaves was verified by RNA blot analysis (Fig. 2). OPCL1 and OPR3 transcript levels peaked 1 h after wounding or JA treatment and declined steadily thereafter. OPCL1 and OPR3 were not induced in wounded or JA treated leaves of the coi1-1 mutant that is defective in JA signaling (46). Rather, a low basal level of expression of both genes was detected in coi1 leaves (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the expression of OPCL1 is tightly coordinated with that of OPR3 via the jasmonate signaling pathway.  Physiological Role of OPCL1 in Jasmonate Biosynthesis—To determine whether OPCL1 has a physiological role in JA synthesis, a mutant line (designated opcl1-1) for this gene was obtained from the collection of sequence-indexed T-DNA insertions (47). We also characterized insertion mutants for the two above-mentioned 4CL-like genes (At4g05160 and At5g63380) that were previously implicated in JA biosynthesis (39). PCR analysis confirmed the homozygousity of the T-DNA insert in all three mutant lines (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1). None of these lines exhibited obvious defects in growth, development, or reproduction (data not shown). Using RNA blot analysis with gene-specific probes for OPCL1, At4g05160, and At5g63380, we found no transcripts in the corresponding mutant line, indicating that we were assessing the null phenotype for each mutant (Fig. 3). These experiments also showed that At4g05160 and At5g63380 are expressed at a basal level in unwounded leaves of WT plants. In contrast to OPCL1, however, these two genes were not induced by mechanical wounding.    [[FIGURE]] To assess the effect of the insertion mutations on JA production, we used GC-MS to measure the endogenous levels of JA in mutant and WT plants grown under identical conditions. JA levels in control and wounded leaves of insertion lines corresponding to At4g05160 and At5g63380 were not significantly different from WT levels (Fig. 4). We also found that a double mutant defective in both At4g05160 and At5g63380 produced normal levels of JA in response to wounding (data not shown). In contrast to these mutant lines, opcl1-1 plants showed a significant reduction in wound-induced JA accumulation (Fig. 4). The level of JA in wounded opcl1-1 leaves at each time point (30, 60, and 90 min) tested was 50-60% of that observed in WT leaves. This pattern of JA deficiency was observed in three independent experiments.  To test the hypothesis that OPCL1 functions as a CoA ligase for C18 precursors of JA, we measured the relative levels of OPDA, OPC-8:0, and JA in WT and opcl1-1 plants in response to wounding. OPDA and OPC-8:0 levels in WT plants increased within 30 min of wounding and remained steady during the remainder of the time course (Fig. 5, A and B). OPC-8:0 levels in wounded opcl1-1 leaves were significantly greater (p < 0.01, Student's unpaired t test) than that in the WT at both the 30- and 60-min time points. This wound-induced hyperaccumulation of OPC-8:0 was associated with decreased amounts of JA in the same extracts (Fig. 5C). The OPDA content in wounded and control opcl1-1 leaves was not significantly different from that in WT plants. To exclude the possibility that the altered JA and OPC-8:0 content of oplc1-1 leaves resulted from a secondary mutation unrelated to the T-DNA insertion, we compared the oxylipin profile in WT and opcl1-1 plants to that in an allelic mutant (designated opcl1-2) that is homozygous for an independent T-DNA insertion (supplemental Fig. S1). The results showed that the wound-induced pattern of OPDA, OPC-8:0, and JA accumulation in opcl1-2 plants exactly matched that of opcl1-1 plants (supplemental Fig. S2). These findings indicate that OPCL1 has a physiological role in wound-induced JA synthesis and further support the idea that OPC-8:0 is an endogenous substrate for the activation step.    [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] OPCL1 Metabolizes C18 Precursors of JA—To confirm that the altered levels of JA and OPC-8:0 in wounded opcl1 leaves result directly from a defect in the CoA activation step, it was necessary to demonstrate that OPCL1 protein has catalytic activity toward JA precursors. To address this question, we expressed recombinant OPCL1 with an N-terminal histidine tag in E. coli and purified the enzyme by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 6A). The apparent molecular weight of the purified protein as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 59,375. A spectrophotometric assay in which AAE-catalyzed AMP formation is enzymatically coupled to NADH oxidation (38, 39) was used to study the in vitro substrate specificity of purified OPCL1 (Fig. 6B). The results showed that OPCL1 readily accepts 14:0 and 18:1 fatty acid substrates but has little or no activity with shorter chain substrates such as hexanoic and octanoic acids. These findings are consistent with a recent study (48) showing that the same protein (referred to as At4CL11) does not activate hydroxycinnamic acids involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism. Significantly, OPCL1 was also highly active with OPDA and OPC-8:0. The apparent Km of OPDA and OPC-8:0 was 24 and 45 μm, respectively, which is similar to Km values reported for other 4CL-like enzymes that utilize JA precursors in vitro (39). These results demonstrate that OPCL1 has the capacity to activate OPDA and OPC-8:0 precursors of JA in vitro.    [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] OPCL1 Is Targeted to Peroxisomes—Acyl-activating enzymes that supply JA precursors for β-oxidation are expected to reside in the peroxisome. The predicted sequence of OPCL1 contains a consensus peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 motif (-SKL) at the C terminus (44, 45). To determine whether OPCL1 is targeted to peroxisomes in planta, we constructed a chimeric gene that encodes a protein in which the YFP is fused to the N terminus of OPCL1. This gene was cloned into a binary vector under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and subsequently introduced into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. As a control for these experiments, we also analyzed a transgenic line expressing a GFP-OPR3 fusion construct that is known to be targeted to peroxisomes (19). Confocal imaging of leaf tissue from 35S::YFP-OPCL1 plants showed a punctate pattern of expression that is typical for peroxisome-targeted proteins (49-51) (Fig. 7, C and F). The size and shape of the fluorescent signal in 35S::YFP-OPCL1 leaves was identical to that observed in the 35S::GFP-OPR3 line (Fig. 7, B and E). Staining of root tissue with Mito-Tracker Orange showed that the GFP/YFP-fluorescing structures are distinct from mitochondria (Fig. 7, D-F). These results indicate that the YFP-OPCL1 fusion protein is targeted to peroxisomes.  Identification of OPCL1-related Genes That Are Induced by Wounding and JA—The capacity of opcl1 mutants to accumulate ∼50% of WT levels of JA in wounded leaves (Figs. 4 and 5 and supplemental Fig. S2) indicates that additional enzymes are involved in the activation of JA precursors. Other 4CL-like genes (Fig. 1) that have an expression pattern similar to OPCL1 can be considered good candidates for this function. Results presented in Fig. 3 show that two 4CL-like genes (At4g05160 and At5g63380) are not induced by mechanical wounding. We used RNA blot analysis and gene-specific probes to assess the expression pattern of four additional members of this group, namely At1g20480, At1g20490, At1g20500, and At5g38120. At1g-20480 and At1g20500 transcripts were not detected in either undamaged or wounded leaves of WT plants (data not shown). In contrast, At1g20490 and At5g38120 mRNA accumulation was induced both by wounding and JA treatment (Fig. 8A). The time course of expression of these two inducible genes was similar to that of OPCL1 (see Fig. 2). In summary, these results indicate that three members (OPCL1, At1g20490, and At5g38120) of the 4CL-like gene family are expressed in leaves in response to wounding and JA treatment. 
!~MM~! Biological Material—Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chambers maintained at 22 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h light (100 μmol photons m-2 s-1) and 8 h dark. Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as wild type (WT) for all experiments. All T-DNA insertion lines used in this study were identified from the Sequence-Indexed Library of Insertion Mutations. Seed stock identifiers for the T-DNA insertion lines were as follows: At4g05160, SALK_050214; At5g63380, SALK_003233; At1g20510, SALK_140659 (corresponds to opcl1-1); and At1g20510, SALK_107614 (corresponds to opcl1-2). Seed stocks were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Homozygous knock-out lines were selected by PCR-based screening for both the presence of T-DNA insertion and the absence of an intact endogenous gene. PCR reactions to detect the intact endogenous gene were performed with the following forward (F) and reverse (R) gene-specific primer sets: At4g05160, 5′-AGACACCGTAGAGATTCCTC-3′ (1F) and 5′-ATGTGTTCGGACGTGGAATC-3′ (1R); At5g63380, 5′-GGCTCATTGCTTCTCAAGGC-3′ (2F) and 5′-GGAACGCAACGACCGGAGAT-3′ (2R); At1g20510 (opcl1-1), 5′-TCATCGACGCTTCCACAGGT-3′ (3F) and 5′-GAGTCGAACTCGTAGCTTCC-3′ (3R); and At1g20510 (opcl1-2), 5′-TCCGGTTACTGGTCAGATTCTTGG-3′ (3-2F) and 5′-TGGTCATATTTCAACATGGATGCA-3′ (3-2R). PCR reactions to detect the T-DNA insert in each mutant line were performed with the T-DNA left border primer (LBb1, 5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) and the gene-specific primer indicated in supplemental Fig. S1. PCR analysis confirmed the homozygosity of the T-DNA insert in all mutant lines.  RNA Blot Analysis—Rosette leaves from 4-week-old plants were either wounded twice across the mid-vein with a hemostat or sprayed with JA (25 ml of a 50 μm solution per 24 plants). Tissue (1 g fresh weight) was collected at the indicated time points and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were performed according to the procedure described by Li et al. (34). Gene-specific probes were prepared by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA clones for At1g20510 (OPCL1; U09223), At4g05160 (U19441), At5g-63380 (U24744), OPR3 (U13428), and Actin-8 (At1g49240). cDNA clones for OPCL1, At4g05160, At5g63380, and OPR3 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. For other probes, PCR amplification was performed with Arabidopsis genomic DNA as template. Forward and reverse PCR primers used to generate these probes were as follows: At4g05160, 5′-AATCCGGCTACGGCAGAGAC-3′ (F) and 5′-TTCAACACCTGGAGCAAGCA-3′ (R); At5g63380, 5′-GAGCTCCGGCTTCGATCAAC-3′ (F) and 5′-GGAACGCAACGACCGGAGAT-3′ (R); At1g20510, 5′-CCAATGGCATACGTCGTAAG-3′ (F2) and 5′-ACTGCCATAATCAATCTGAG-3′ (R2); At1g20480, 5′-AAAGCATGCATGGCGGTTAAGCACGGCGT-3′ (F) and 5′-TCCAGCCACCACAGTGTGCAAC-3′ (R); At1g20490, 5′-TGTTGTGGATCGACTGAAAG-3′ (F) and 5′-TGTACAATGCACAAAAGAAACA-3′ (R); At1g20500, 5′-TAGTTTTTGCTTTGCTTGCG-3′ (F) and 5′-TTCACACTAGTCCAAAAACCAT-3′ (R); At5g38120, 5′-GATCTAATCAAATTTGCCATTT-3′ (F) and 5′-GCTCACAACACATGCTACAC-3′ (R); OPR3, XhoI 5′-GGGCTCGAGATGACGGCGGCACAAGGGAA-3′ (F) and SpeI, 5′-CCCACTAGTTCAGAGGCGGGAAAAAGGAG-3′ (R).  Jasmonate Measurements—Rosette leaves were wounded and harvested for jasmonate determinations as described above. Fresh leaf tissue (100-200 mg) was transferred to a Fast-prep tube (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) containing Zirmil beads (Saint-Gobain ZirPro, Mountainside, NJ) and 50 ng of dihydrojasmonic acid (dhJA) as an internal standard. Tubes were capped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until extraction. Jasmonates were extracted and analyzed according to the vapor-phase extraction procedure (35), with minor modifications as described previously (34). Endogenous JA levels were quantified using a calibration curve for comparing detector responses of MeJA and dhMeJA (36). The combined peak area of the cis and trans isomers of each compound was used for quantification. Because recovery of the dhJA internal standard may not accurately reflect the recovery of ODPA and OPC-8:0 from plant tissue, levels of OPDA and OPC-8:0 were expressed as a relative quantity rather than as an absolute value. Specifically, the relative level of OPDA in extracts from WT and opcl1 plants was calculated by dividing the total GC peak area (cis and trans isomers) of OPDA by the total peak area of the dhJA internal standard. Similarly, the relative level of OPC-8:0 in the extracts was calculated by dividing the total GC peak area (cis and trans isomers) of OPC-8:0 by the peak area of the dhJA. The m/z of [M + H]+ ions and retention times of analyzed methyl esters were as follows: JA (m/z = 225), 7.62 and 8.17 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively; dhJA (m/z = 227), 7.68 and 8.20 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively; OPDA (m/z = 307), 34.69 and 35.22 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively; OPC-8:0 (m/z = 309), 33.45 and 34.17 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively. dhJA was synthesized from JA (Sigma) according to the platinum-catalyzed reduction method (36). Authentic standards for OPDA and OPC-8:0 were chemically synthesized as previously described (37).  Expression and Purification of Recombinant OPCL1—A full-length OPCL1 cDNA clone was PCR-amplified with the primer set of BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCTTCAGTGAATTCTCG-3′ (F); BamHI site underlined) and SalI (5′-AAAGTCGACTCAAAGCTTGGAGTTGGAAG-3′ (R); SalI site underlined). The resulting 1641-bp PCR product was ligated into the BamHI and SalI restriction sites of pQE30 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). This construct adds 12 amino acids (MRGSHHHHHHGS), including a hexahistidine tag, to the N terminus of OPCL1. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 competent cells (Qiagen).  Expression and purification of recombinant OPCL1 were performed according to the procedure described by Li et al. (34). A minor modification was that the lysis buffer contained 300 mm NaCl, complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (five tablets per 40 ml of buffer; Roche Applied Science) and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Protein measurements were performed with the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of recombinant OPCL1 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was estimated to be >95%.  Measurement of Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity—We measured acyl-CoA synthetase activity of recombinant OPCL1 using the coupled enzyme assay (38), with modifications described by Schneider et al. (39). Fatty acid substrates were converted to their ammonium salts by addition of a few drops of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The resulting solutions were dried under a stream of N2 gas. These stock solutions were diluted in Triton X-100 and added to the enzyme reaction mixture to yield a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Stock solutions of OPDA and OPC-8:0 (in ethanol) were also diluted in Triton X-100, such that the reaction mixture contained 0.1% Triton X-100 and <0.01% ethanol. Reaction mixtures (700 μl) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CoA, 0.1 to 0.4 mm NADH, 100 μm fatty acyl substrate, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 10 units each of myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by adding ∼10 μg of purified OPCL1. Oxidation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm with a Beckman DU530 spectrophotometer (Fullerton, CA). The assay was validated with a commercial acyl-CoA synthetase (Sigma) from Pseudomonas and 14:0 as a substrate. Heat-killed enzyme was used to determine the rate of non-enzymatic NADH oxidation. Alternatively, total lysate obtained from E. coli cells expressing the empty pQE30 vector was subject to the nickel affinity chromatography procedure used to purify OPCL1. A volume (typically 10 μl) of the resulting eluant was used as a mock-enzyme treatment. Pyruvate kinase (from rabbit muscle), myokinase (from chicken muscle), l-lactate dehydrogenase (from rabbit muscle), and fatty acid substrates were obtained from Sigma. 12-OPDA and OPC-8:0 were chemically synthesized as described previously (37) and were >97% pure. GC-MS analysis showed that the ratio of cis- to trans-OPDA isomers was ∼25:1. The ratio of cis- to trans-OPC-8:0 isomers was ∼1.5:1.  Construction of Transgenic Plants Expressing Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP)-tagged OPCL1—To determine the subcellular localization of OPCL1, we constructed a transgenic line of Arabidopsis expressing a derivative of the yellow fluorescent protein that is fused to the N terminus of OPCL1. The open reading frame of YFP was PCR amplified from the EYFP-Peroxi plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with the primer set of 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′. The OPCL1 open reading frame was PCR amplified from the full-length cDNA with the primer set of 5′-GACGAGCTGTACAAGATGGCTTCAGTGAATTCT-3′ (an overhang encoding overlapping sequence with EYFP is underlined) and 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGCTTGGAGTTGGA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The fusion between YFP and OPCL1 was created in a second PCR in which equimolar amounts of the two products from the first round of PCR were used as template with the primer set of 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGCTTGGAGTTGGA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The resulting product was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of a modified pBI121 vector containing a single BamHI site, which places the fusion gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. This modified pBI121 vector was constructed as follows. Two pairs of complementary primers (pair 1: 5′-GATCCACTAGTCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-ACGTGCTCGAGACTAGTG-3′; pair 2: 5′-CACGTGGTCGACGGTACCGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CGGTACCGTCGACC-3′) were annealed and ligated to a pBI121 vector that was digested with BamHI and SacI. This manipulation removed the GUS gene and introduced a new set of restriction enzyme sites for cloning.  The GFP-OPR3 fusion gene was constructed as follows. The open reading frame of OPR3 was PCR amplified from the cDNA template with the primer set of 5′-GGGCTCGAGATGACGGCGGCACAAGGGAA-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and 5′-CCCACTAGTTCAGAGGCGGGAAAAAGGAG-3′ (SpeI site underlined). The resulting product was cloned into the XhoI and SpeI restriction sites of vector pTA7002. A GFP open reading frame containing 5′ and 3′ XhoI overhangs was amplified from plasmid pEGAD (CD3-389, Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) with the primer set of 5′-AAACTCGAGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCTCGAGCCCGGGGAATTCGG-3′ (XhoI sites underlined). This product was cloned into the XhoI site of the OPR3-containing pTA7002 vector described above. The YFP-OPCL1 and GFP-OPR3 constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1. The floral dip method (40) was used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis Col-0. T1 generation plants expressing YFP-OPCL1 and T2 generation plants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OPR3 were used for confocal imaging experiments.  Confocal Microscopy—Leaf and root tissue of 15-20-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the fluorescent proteins were hand-sectioned with a razor blade and mounted in distilled water between a slide and coverslip. Confocal fluorescence images of the specimens were taken with a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an argon laser. Chloroplast autofluorescence was excited with a 488-nm argon laser and was detected after passage through a long-pass 650-nm emission filter. YFP and GFP fluorescence was excited with a 488-nm laser and was detected after passage through a band pass 505-530-nm emission filter. MitoTracker Orange CM-H2TMRos (Molecular Probes Inc.) was used to stain mitochondria according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence from MitoTracker-treated root tissue was detected with a 543-nm helium neon laser and a band pass 560-615-nm filter.
