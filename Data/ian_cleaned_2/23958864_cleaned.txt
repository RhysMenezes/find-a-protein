!~ABS~! LESION SIMULATING DISEASE1 (lsd1) is an important negative regulator of programmed cell death (PCD) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The loss-of-function mutations in lsd1 cause runaway cell death triggered by reactive oxygen species. lsd1 encodes a novel zinc finger protein with unknown biochemical activities. Here, we report the identification of CATALASE3 (CAT3) as an lsd1-interacting protein by affinity purification and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. The Arabidopsis genome contains three homologous catalase genes (CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3). Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that lsd1 interacted with all three catalases both in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction required the zinc fingers of lsd1. We found that the catalase enzymatic activity was reduced in the lsd1 mutant, indicating that the catalase enzyme activity was partially dependent on lsd1. Consistently, the lsd1 mutant was more sensitive to the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole than the wild type, suggesting that the interaction between lsd1 and catalases is involved in the regulation of the reactive oxygen species generated in the peroxisome. Genetic studies revealed that lsd1 interacted with CATALASE genes to regulate light-dependent runaway cell death and hypersensitive-type cell death. Moreover, the accumulation of salicylic acid was required for PCD regulated by the interaction between lsd1 and catalases. These results suggest that the lsd1-catalase interaction plays an important role in regulating PCD in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! Previous studies showed that lsd1 is an important negative regulator of PCD in Arabidopsis (CITATION). To further investigate the function of lsd1, we generated stable transgenic plants carrying an lsd1-FLAG transgene driven by a 1,520-bp native lsd1 promoter in the lsd1 null mutant background (Columbia-0 [Col-0] background; CITATION). Immunoblot analysis showed that whereas no lsd1 was detectable in the lsd1 mutant using an anti-lsd1 antibody (CITATION), the lsd1-FLAG fusion protein was expressed in lsd1:lsd1-FLAG transgenic plants (Fig. 1A; Supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Analysis of multiple independent transgenic lines revealed that the lsd1:lsd1-FLAG transgenes fully rescued the lsd1 mutant phenotype in long-day photoperiod (LD; 16/8 h of light/dark; Fig. 1A) and in continuous white-light growth conditions (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The expression level of FLAVIN-DEPENDENT MONOOXYGENASE (FMO), a marker gene for PCD, has been shown to increase in the lsd1 mutant (CITATION). Analysis by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed that the increased expression of FMO1 in the lsd1 mutant was also rescued by the lsd1:lsd1-FLAG transgene (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the lsd1-FLAG fusion protein was functional in planta. [[FIGURE]] To identify lsd1-interacting proteins, we performed affinity purification of the lsd1-containing protein complex followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Total soluble proteins prepared from 2-week-old seedlings of lsd1-FLAG or Col-0 in LD conditions were incubated with the anti-FLAG antibody-coupled agarose beads, and proteins eluted from the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). Differential expressed bands specific to the lsd1-FLAG transgenic plants were identified and excised and then subjected to microcapillary liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight (CapLC Q-TOF) mass spectrometry. The experiment was repeated twice (biological repeats). In one experiment, 11 tryptic peptides of the CAT3 protein were identified, representing total protein coverage of 26% (Fig. 1D; Supplemental Fig. S2A). In a second experiment, eight tryptic peptides were obtained from CAT3, representing total protein coverage of 18% (Supplemental Fig. S2B). These results suggest that CAT3 is most likely an lsd1-interacting protein. Previous studies have identified several lsd1-interacting proteins, including bZIP10, AtMC1, and Arabidopsis GSH-induced LITAF domain protein (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). None of these proteins was identified in our assay, presumably owing to the relatively low abundance of these proteins that were not recognized by silver staining under our assay conditions or other technical difficulties. Hereafter, we report our detailed analysis of the regulatory role of the lsd1-catalase interaction in hypersensitive cell death. The affinity purification analysis identified CAT3 as an lsd1-interacting protein. To confirm this result, we investigated the protein-protein interaction by a yeast two-hybrid assay. The CAT3 full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) was fused to the transcription activation domain of GAL4, and the lsd1 cDNA was fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. We found that CAT3 interacts with lsd1 in yeast cells (Fig. 2A). In Arabidopsis, CAT3 has two close homologs (CAT1 and CAT2), and the amino acid sequences of the three catalases are 75% to 84% identical, considering conservative substitutions (CITATION). Similar to CAT3, CAT1 and CAT2 also efficiently interact with lsd1 and CAT3 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A). [[FIGURE]] lsd1 has three lsd1-like zinc finger motifs, which function to mediate protein-protein interactions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Fig. 2B). To determine whether the zinc finger structure is required for the interaction between lsd1 and catalases, we made various deletion mutants that lacked all three zinc fingers or individual zinc finger domains of lsd1 (Fig. 2B). The interactions between these mutated lsd1 and catalases were tested by the yeast two-hybrid assay. We found that mutations in any one of the three zinc finger domains completely abolished the interaction with catalases (Fig. 2C), indicating that intact zinc finger domains are essential for the interaction between lsd1 and catalases. However, the carboxyl region outside the zinc finger domains was dispensable for the lsd1-catalase interaction in yeast cells (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that lsd1 interacts with all three catalase proteins in a zinc finger-dependent manner. Because lsd1 physically interacts with catalase proteins in vitro, it is expected that lsd1 and catalase proteins may be present in the same protein complex in planta. In Arabidopsis, CAT2 and CAT3 were shown to represent major catalase activity in the vegetative tissues (CITATION; CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, we tested possible interactions of lsd1 with CAT2 and CAT3 in planta. To this end, we first constructed the CAT2:FLAG-CAT2 and CAT3:FLAG-CAT3 transgenes and transformed them into the cat2-1 and cat3-2 mutants, respectively. The cat2-1 mutant (SALK_076998) was a null mutation and exhibited approximately 20% of the wild-type catalase enzymatic activity in leaves (CITATION). The cat3-2 mutant was identified in this study, which carried a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 448 (where the first nucleotide of the CAT3 open reading frame is referred to as 1), resulting in the conversion of Gln-150 into a stop codon (Supplemental Fig. S4A). We also generated monoclonal anti-CAT2 and anti-CAT3 antibodies specifically recognizing CAT2 and CAT3 proteins, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S4B). Consistently, catalase activity was decreased in cat2-1, cat3-2, and cat2-1 cat3-2 mutants (Supplemental Fig. S3B). We performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. In the extracts prepared from the lsd1:lsd1-FLAG transgenic seedlings, all three catalase proteins were efficiently precipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody-coupled agarose beads, as revealed by a polyclonal anticatalase antibody (Fig. 3A). Note that the anti-catalase antibody (Agrisera) used in this experiment was able to recognize all three CAT proteins (Supplemental Fig. S3, A and C). In a reverse experiment, lsd1 was also precipitated in protein extracts prepared from CAT2:FLAG-CAT2 and CAT3:FLAG-CAT3 transgenic plants by the use of the anti-FLAG antibody-coupled agarose beads (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that lsd1 and all three catalases were present in a protein complex in planta. [[FIGURE]] A previous study showed that lsd1 retained AtbZIP10 outside the nucleus, suggesting that lsd1 plays a role in the regulation of the subcellular localization of specific proteins (CITATION). To explore whether lsd1 also affects the subcellular localization of catalases, we analyzed the subcellular localization of CAT2 and CAT3 in wild-type (Col-0) and lsd1 mutant plants by immunocytochemical staining with their specific antibodies. There were no differences in CAT2 or CAT3 subcellular localization between the wild type and the lsd1 mutant (Supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). This result indicates that the interaction between lsd1 and catalase does not affect the subcellular localization of CAT2 and CAT3. In both plants and animals, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) is widely used as an effective inhibitor of catalases (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Exogenous application of 3-AT can significantly reduce the catalase activity, which can increase peroxisomal H2O2 concentrations and cause cell death in Arabidopsis (CITATION). Whereas plants treated with 3-AT developed chlorosis and necrosis on leaves (CITATION), reduced catalase activity was found in LSD1 plants in short-day permissive conditions (CITATION). Under our assay condition (both short and long days), the catalase activity was also decreased in the lsd1 mutant (Supplemental Fig. S6, A and B). The reduced catalase activity of the lsd1 mutant may lead to an altered sensitivity to 3-AT. To test this hypothesis, Col-0 and lsd1 were germinated and grown in the absence or presence of 3-AT under the LD condition. In the absence of 3-AT, no difference was observed between wild-type and lsd1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 4A). However, in the presence of 4 μm 3-AT, approximately 10% Col-0 and 18% lsd1 seedlings became chlorotic (Fig. 4). When treated with a higher concentration of 3-AT (5 μm), approximately 90% lsd1 and 80% Col-0 seedlings were chlorotic (Fig. 4). These results suggest that lsd1-regulated PCD is tightly coupled with the 3-AT-sensitive catalase activity. [[FIGURE]] To define genetic interactions between lsd1 and catalase genes, we generated various multiple mutants, including the lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 mutants. When grown in LD conditions, cat (including cat2-1, cat3-2, and cat2-1 cat3-2) young seedlings showed a similar growth phenotype to the wild type (Fig. 5A). However, lsd1, the lsd1 cat2-1 and lsd1 cat3-2 double mutants, and the lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 triple mutant displayed a leaf lesion-mimic phenotype (Fig. 5A). Except for the RCD phenotype, the lsd1, lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 mutants also showed small and dwarf phenotypes compared with cat2-1, cat3-2, cat2-1 cat3-2, and the wild type in mature plants (Supplemental Fig. S7). [[FIGURE]] The RCD of lsd1 can be induced by LD conditions (CITATION). In short-day photoperiod (SD) conditions (8 h of light/16 h of dark), no obvious lesions were observed in all tested mutants (Supplemental Fig. S8). When grown in LD conditions, approximately 3.38% of leaf area showed spreading necrotic lesions in lsd1 mutants. However, about 22.38%, 21.12%, and 28.02% of leaf area displayed lesions in lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2, respectively (Fig. 5B). Compared with lsd1, the lesions emerged earlier and were more severe in lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that lsd1 and cat were able to enhance lesion penetrance and the severity of the mutant phenotype in the light-dependent RCD process. We also generated stable transgenic lines 35S:FLAG-CAT2 and 35S:FLAG-CAT3 in the lsd1 mutant background to explore the function of the overexpression of catalase genes in lsd1. However, despite the substantially increased expression level and increased catalase enzyme activity (Supplemental Fig. S9, A and B), all these transgenic plants showed a similar phenotype to the lsd1 mutant in LD conditions (Supplemental Fig. S9C), indicating that the overexpression of catalase genes does not reduce the RCD phenotype of lsd1 in LD conditions. It has been shown that the induction of spreading cell death in lsd1 was triggered by inoculation with a low-concentration bacterial suspension of avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst), which had no visible effect on the wild type (CITATION). To explore the function of catalases in this process, approximately 7-week-old Col-0, cat2-1, cat3-2, cat2-1 cat3-2, lsd1, lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 grown in SD conditions were infected with the avirulent bacterium Pst DC3000 (avrRpm1) at a relatively low concentration (5 × 106 colony-forming units [CFU] mL−1). Ion leakage of these samples was measured over time, a readout for measuring plant cell death (CITATION). Compared with lsd1, cat mutants (including cat2-1, cat3-2, and cat2-1 cat3-2) and Col-0 showed only slight increases in conductivity (Fig. 6). However, there was increased conductivity for lsd1 cat2-1 and lsd1 cat3-2 double mutants and the lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 triple mutant (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the reduction of catalase activity enhanced pathogen-induced cell death in the lsd1 mutant. [[FIGURE]] Genetic and pharmacological experiments showed that SA plays an important role in HR cell death. RCD in lsd1 has been shown to be SA dependent. SA not only triggers but also mediates the RCD phenotype in lsd1 (CITATION). As a key plant defense hormone, SA can also modulate catalase activity (CITATION; CITATION). Lesion formation in cat2 was accompanied by the accumulation of high levels of SA in LD conditions, and exogenous SA induced the cell death of cat2 in SD conditions (CITATION). The SA induction-deficient2-2 (sid2-2) mutant carries a mutation to ICS1, which encodes an isochorismate synthase of the SA biogenesis pathway (CITATION). The SA level after pathogen infection in sid2 mutants is only 5% to 10% of the wild-type level (CITATION). To address whether SA is required for the interactions between lsd1 and catalases during light-dependent RCD and HR cell death, we introduced a sid2-2 mutation into lsd1, cat (cat2-1, cat3-2, and cat2-1 cat3-2), and lsd1 cat (lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2) backgrounds. As expected, the double mutant lsd1 sid2-2 did not undergo the RCD, whereas an apparent RCD phenotype was observed in lsd1 grown in LD conditions (Fig. 7A; Supplemental Fig. S7). The enhanced RCD in lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 was also restricted in sid2-2 lsd1 cat2-1, sid2-2 lsd1 cat3-2, and sid2-2 lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 grown in LD conditions (Fig. 7A; Supplemental Fig. S7). This result indicates that the accumulation of SA was required for RCD regulated by lsd1 and catalases. [[FIGURE]] We next investigated HR cell death in these multiple mutants. Wild-type and various mutant plants were injected with the avirulent bacterium Pst DC3000 (avrRpm1) at a relatively low concentration (5 × 106 CFU mL−1), and then ion leakage of the samples was measured. There was an obvious increase in ion leakage in lsd1 (Fig. 7B), consistent with previous observations (CITATION). In contrast, ion leakage measurements after pathogen inoculation showed that almost no cell death occurred in Col-0 and sid2-2 (Fig. 7B). The lsd1 sid2-2 double mutant showed delayed and reduced ion leakage compared with lsd1 (Fig. 7B). Notably, the enhanced ion leakage in lsd1 cat2-1, lsd1 cat3-2, and lsd1 cat2-1 cat3-2 plants was partially suppressed by the sid2-2 mutation (Fig. 7B). Compared with the sid2-2 single mutant, the sid2-2 cat2-1, sid2-2 cat3-2, and sid2-2 cat2-1 cat3-2 plants also exhibited increased ion leakage (Fig. 7B). Taken together, these results indicate that SA accumulation was required for HR cell death regulated by lsd1 and catalases.
!~MM~! The Col-0 accession of wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was used in this study. Seeds were surface sterilized with 10% bleach for 10 min and washed three times with sterile water. Sterilized seeds were then plated on Murashige and Skoog medium (one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts, 1% Suc, and 0.8% agar). Plants were grown under 16-h-light/8-h-dark (LD) or 8-h-light/16-h-dark (SD) conditions or under continuous white light (light intensity of 60 μmol m–2 s–1) at 22°C. Seeds of lsd1 (Col-0 background; CITATION) were kindly provided by Dr. Jeff Dangl. Seeds of cat2-1 (SALK_076998; Col-0 background; CITATION) and sid2-2 (CS16438; Col-0 background; CITATION) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The cat3-2 (Col-0 background) mutant was identified in this study (Supplemental Fig. S4). To make lsd1:lsd1-FLAG, a DNA fragment of lsd1 was amplified by PCR (primer pair lsd1FP and lsd1BG), which included a 1,520-bp promoter and a 1,919-bp coding region. The fragment was ligated to pBluescript SK– (Stratagene), which fused with a single copy of the FLAG tag at the C terminus. Then, the XhoI/XbaI fragment containing the C-terminal FLAG-tagged lsd1 genomic DNA driven by the endogenous promoter was cloned into the XhoI/SpeI-digested binary hygromycin-selected vector pER8 (CITATION). To generate CAT2:FLAG-CAT2, a CAT2 endogenous 2,002-bp promoter was PCR amplified (primer pair CAT2PF and CAT2PB) and in-frame fused to the FLAG tag to yield SK-CAT2pro:FLAG. CAT2 genomic DNA was amplified by PCR (primer pair CAT2GF and CAT2GB); this PCR fragment was ligated to SK-CAT2pro:FLAG using PstI/SpeI sites, and then CAT2:FLAG-CAT2 was cloned to the XhoI/SpeI sites of pER8 (CITATION). The CAT3:FLAG-CAT3 construct was generated in a similar way. The primer pairs of CAT3 promoter and genomic DNA were CAT3PF/CAT3PB and CAT3GF/CAT3GB, respectively. To construct 35S:FLAG-CAT2, FLAG-CAT2 DNA fragments were amplified from CAT2:FLAG-CAT2 plasmid (primer pair KpnIFLAG and CAT2GB) and then ligated into pMW101 at the KpnI/SpeI sites. 35S:FLAG-CAT3 was made by a similar approach with the primers KpnIFLAG and CAT3GB. These constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, which was then used for the transformation of Arabidopsis by the floral dip method (CITATION). All primer sequences used in the plasmid constructs are presented in Supplemental Table S1. Total RNA was prepared by the RNAprep pure Plant RNA Purification Kit (Tiangen Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR analyses were carried out as described by CITATION. All primer pairs used in PCR analyses are listed in Supplemental Table S1. Two-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100× proteinase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich). Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4°C twice to collect soluble fraction. Approximately 400 mg of protein was incubated with protein A agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min using a rotator, and then the samples were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with high-affinity anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 4°C and washed several times. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 6× SDS sample buffer and fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels. Differentially expressed bands were excised, and the trypsin-digested samples were subsequently identified by CapLC Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG (Abmart), anti-CAT (Agrisera), or anti-lsd1 (CITATION) antibody. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (CITATION). To make the yeast two-hybrid assay constructs, the full-length cDNA fragments of CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3 were PCR amplified with primers CAT1F1 and CAT1B1, CAT2F1 and CAT2B1, and CAT3F1 and CAT3B1, respectively. The PCR products were ligated to pBluescript SK– (Stratagene) and subcloned to the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGADT7 (Clontech). The lsd1 full-length coding sequence was amplified by PCR (primer pair lsd1F1 and lsd1B1). The PCR product was ligated to pBluescript SK– (Stratagene) and subcloned to the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech). lsd1-NTD and lsd1-CTD were cloned with the same procedure and different primers. The lsd1-NTD primers were lsd1F1 and lsd1NTDB, and the lsd1-CTD primers were lsd1CTDF and lsd1B1. The lsd1-ZF1 fragment was amplified from SK-lsd1 with primers lsd1ZF1F and lsd1ZF1B, and then the ZF1 truncated version of lsd1-ZF1 was subcloned to the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBKT7. lsd1-ZF2 and lsd1-ZF3 were cloned in the same way but with different primers. Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using Yeastmaker Yeast Transformation System 2 according to the user manual. Percentage lesion areas under LD conditions were calculated using IQmaterials software (CITATION). Plants were grown in SD conditions and used for the following experiment. The avirulent bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (avrRpm1) was injected at the concentration of 5 × 106 CFU mL−1 in 10 mm MgCl2 into fully expanded leaves. After 3 h, 5.0-mm leaf discs were collected and washed with distilled water for 1 h. Twelve leaf discs were placed in a tube with 15 mL of distilled water, and conductivity was measured over time with Orion 3-Star Plus Conductivity Meters (Thermo Scientific) as described (CITATION). Analysis of the catalase zymogram was carried out as described (CITATION). Catalase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by the decrease of A240 (CITATION; CITATION). The anti-CAT2 and anti-CAT3 monoclonal antibodies were produced by Abmart with specific peptides. Immunofluorescence labeling for CAT2 in the roots from 6-d-old seedlings was performed according to the method of CITATION with minor modifications. Briefly, the roots were placed on glutaraldehyde-activated γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides. Then, the samples were fixed for 1 h in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde (freshly prepared by dissolving solid paraformaldehyde in 1× MTSB [50 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgSO4, and 89 mm KOH, pH 6.9]/2% Triton X-100). The fixed samples were washed for 5 min in distilled water, and then the samples were rinsed in 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% methanol for 20 min individually, followed by rinsing in 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% methanol for 20 min individually. After washing in distilled water for 5 min, the samples were digested by 1% (w/v) driselase/0.5% cellulase/0.075% macerozyme in distilled water (pH 5.2) for 20 min. The roots were washed three times in 1× MTSB. Then, 3% IGEPAL CA-630 plus 10% dimethyl sulfoxide was pipetted onto the slides and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After washing four times with 1× MTSB/0.01% Triton X-100, the samples were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The slides were incubated overnight at 4°C with a 1:500 dilution of anti-CAT2 antibody. Then, the slides were rinsed three times in 1× MTSB/0.01% Triton X-100, and the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was pipetted onto the slides for incubation of 2 h. After washing the slide three times in 1× MTSB/0.01% Triton X-100 and once in distilled water, the fluorescence signal was visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Fluo View; FV1000). Immunofluorescence labeling for CAT3 in hypocotyls from 5-d-old seedlings grown in darkness was performed according to the method of CITATION for hypocotyls with primary antibody anti-CAT3 (1:500 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The fluorescence signal was visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Fluo View; FV1000).
