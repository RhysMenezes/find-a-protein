!~ABS~! Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are vital to nuclear–cytoplasmic communication in eukaryotes. The yeast NPC-associated TREX-2 complex, also known as the Thp1–Sac3–Cdc31–Sus1 complex, is anchored on the NPC via the nucleoporin Nup1, and is essential for mRNA export. Here we report the identification and characterization of the putative Arabidopsis thaliana TREX-2 complex and its anchoring nucleoporin. Physical and functional evidence support the identification of the Arabidopsis orthologs of yeast Thp1 and Nup1. Of three Arabidopsis homologs of yeast Sac3, two are putative TREX-2 components, but, surprisingly, none are required for mRNA export as they are in yeast. Physical association of the two Cdc31 homologs, but not the Sus1 homolog, with the TREX-2 complex was observed. In addition to identification of these TREX-2 components, direct interactions of the Arabidopsis homolog of DSS1, which is an established proteasome component in yeast and animals, with both the TREX-2 complex and the proteasome were observed. This suggests the possibility of a link between the two complexes. Thus this work has identified the putative Arabidopsis TREX-2 complex and provides a foundation for future studies of nuclear export in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! We identified the Arabidopsis homolog of yeast Thp1 fortuitously in a genetic screen to identify mutants exhibiting ectopic expression of a soybean conglycinin (7S storage protein) gene promoter–GUS transgene (βCGpro:GUS) (CITATION). Mutant plants (initially named essp1) had diverse developmental defects, such as curly leaves, shorter siliques, shorter primary roots and fewer lateral roots (Figure 1a–d). GUS staining was observed only along the leaf margins, and we detected mRNA from the Arabidopsis gene encodes a putative 7S storage protein (At7S1/At4g36700; CITATION) (Figure 1e). [[FIGURE]] The mutation segregated 3:1 with respect to GUS phenotype, and is thus a single recessive mutation. We mapped the essp1 locus to a genomic interval of approximately 37 kb on chromosome 2 (8 447 799–8 484 961 bp; Figure 1f), based on the curly leaf and GUS phenotype, using standard procedures (CITATION; CITATION). To identify the molecular lesion in essp1, the genomic region was amplified by PCR and sequenced. A single C → T point mutation was identified in At2g19560, a gene that is predicted to encode a PCI-domain protein (CITATION). The mutation is predicted to result in a premature stop codon, leading to truncation of the PCI domain (Figure 1g). The gene was also recently identified as EER5, acting in the ethylene signaling pathway (CITATION). To confirm that ESSP1 is At2g19560, we first introduced the cDNA, under the control of the 35S promoter, into the essp1 plants. In total, more than 100 transgenic lines were obtained, all of which showed wild-type morphology and no GUS activity in leaves (data not shown). Further, two T-DNA insertion lines, SK6095 and SAIL_82A02, were obtained, and plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertions were crossed with βCGpro:GUS. In the F2 generation, about a quarter of the plants showed the curly leaf phenotype, and all these plants showed GUS staining at the leaf margin (data not shown). Together, these data strongly suggest that ESSP1 is At2g19560. We also used RT-PCR to show that At7S1 is expressed in the two T-DNA lines (Figure 1e), further confirming that ESSP1 is At2g19560. In addition, we generated promoter–GUS gene transgenic lines, and observed GUS expression in seedlings, roots, leaves and anthers (Figure S1). The expression patterns observed for ESSP1 are consistent with the results of several DNA microarray experiments (http://www.arabidopsis.org) and those obtained by CITATION. It was reported by CITATION that ESSP1 contains both the PCI domain and the PCI-associated module (PAM), and also identified ESSP1 as a potential ortholog of yeast Thp1 using refined search programs. We localized ESSP1 by expressing a gene encoding an ESSP1–YFP fusion protein under the control of the 35S promoter in the essp1 mutant. The transgene rescued the essp1 mutant phenotype (data not shown). As shown in Figure 1(h,i), the YFP signal is localized in the nucleus, consistent with its putative identity as Arabidopsis THP1, which is part of the TREX-2 complex. Therefore, we refer to ESSP1 as AtTHP1, and describe below experiments investigating whether AtTHP1 is a component of the Arabidopsis TREX-2 complex. Based on the bioinformatic prediction (CITATION) and protein localization (Figure 1h,i), we hypothesized that AtTHP1 is the Arabidopsis homolog of yeast Thp1, and predicted that it would interact with other Arabidopsis TREX-2 components. In addition, AtTHP1 is one of three PCI-domain proteins whose function remains uncharacterized, out of 20 such proteins in Arabidopsis. The others are all subunits of large protein complexes: the proteasome, COP9 singnalosome or the translational initiation factor elF3 (CITATION). To test the hypothesis that it would interact with other Arabidopsis TREX-2 components, we performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to search for its interacting partners. Using full-length AtTHP1 as bait, six genes were identified, including genes predicted to encode a SAC3 family protein, a nucleoporin-like protein, and one of the two Arabidopsis homologs of the 26S proteasome subunit DSS1 [AtDSS1(V)] (Table 1). Because Thp1 and Sac3 are components of the yeast TREX-2 complex that interacts with a nucleoporin, we tested the possibility that we have identified key components of the Arabidopsis TREX-2 mRNA export complex. aNumbers refer to the number of amino acids. Yeast Sac3, a 1293 amino acid protein, is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human (CITATION), although the Arabidopsis ortholog(s) had not yet been identified. Using the conserved approximately 400 amino acid central region of Sac3 (CITATION; CITATION), we identified three potential Arabidopsis SAC3 family genes, At2g39340, At3g06290 and At3g54380, which we designated AtSAC3A, B and C, respectively. Of the three AtSAC3s, AtSAC3B and AtSAC3C are grouped together in the dendrogram shown in Figure 2(a), and are closest to the Sac3 proteins from yeast and animals, whereas AtSAC3A is divergent and does not appear to be closely related to any Sac3 proteins. [[FIGURE]] The Y2H screen identified a peptide containing the conserved central domain of AtSAC3A (AtSAC3A134-1006) (Table 1) as the interacting partner of AtTHP1. The interaction was verified by directed Y2H assay, as determined by colony growth on selective media (Figure 2b). We further examined interactions of the AtSAC3s with other putative Arabidopsis TREX-2 components, and showed that AtSAC3A interacted with AtSAC3B and AtCEN1, and that AtSAC3B interacted with AtTHP1 and AtCEN1 and 2 (Figure 2b). No interactions of AtSAC3C and AtSUS1 with any of the putative TREX-2 components were observed (Table S1). The interactions observed between AtSACs and AtTHP1/AtCENs by Y2H were validated using a bi-molecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in a tobacco transient expression system (CITATION; Figure 2c–h). Thus, putative components of the Arabidopsis TREX-2 complex interact in yeast and in planta. To obtain clues about whether the AtSAC3s are functional orthologs of the yeast Sac3 protein, we fused AtSAC3s with YFP and localized the fusion proteins in stably transformed plants. The AtSAC3A–YFP fusion protein was highly abundant and localized in the nucleus, whereas AtSAC3B–YFP appeared to be concentrated at the nuclear periphery (Figure 2i,j). We did not observe a fluorescence signal from AtSAC3C–YFP. These localization experiments indicate that the nucleus is the primary location of AtSAC3A and B, as suggested by the BiFC experiments (Figure 2c–h). The nuclear localization of AtSAC3s is consistent with the hypothesis that they are subunits of the Arabidopsis TREX-2 complex. The Y2H screen with AtTHP1 identified a protein (At3g10650, Table 1) that was identified by the advanced bioinformatics strategy described by CITATION as a putative ortholog of the yeast nucleoporin Nup1 and vertebrate nucleoporin Nup153. Thus, we designated this gene AtNUP1. We verified the interaction of AtTHP1 with AtNUP1 by independent Y2H assays (Figure 3a) and BiFC analysis (Figure 3b). Similar to the situation in yeast, the putative TREX-2 component AtTHP1 interacts with the putative Nup1/Nup153 nucleoporin. [[FIGURE]] To further validate the identity of AtNUP1 as a nucleoporin, we determined its subcellular localization by expressing an AtNUP1 reporter protein in an atnup1 mutant, atnup1-1 (Figure 3c,d). The morphological phenotype of atnup1-1 is shown in Figure 3(e). A gene encoding a translational fusion between AtNUP1 and YFP under the control of its native promoter was introduced into the atnup1-1 background. The fusion gene rescued the morphological mutant phenotype (data not shown), suggesting that the YFP fusion gene is functional in vivo. As shown in Figure 3(f), the YFP signal is clearly found only along the nuclear periphery, as expected for a nucleoporin. The subcellular location of AtNUP1 is consistent with its potential role as a nuceloporin. We have shown that AtTHP1, AtSAC3s and AtNUP1 interact physically and are localized to the periphery of the nucleus, suggesting that they are components of the TREX-2 mRNA export complex. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether mRNA export was compromised in plants with mutations in putative TREX-2 components by localizing poly(A) mRNA in young leaves using in situ hybridization. The poly(A) mRNA localization experiments suggested that both AtTHP1 and AtNUP1 are required for nuclear RNA export. As shown in Figure 1(k), poly(A) mRNA preferentially accumulated in the nuclei of the atthp1-3 mutant compared with wild-type (Figure 1j), suggesting a defect in export. Similarly, poly(A) mRNA localized in atnup1-1 mutant nuclei but not wild-type nuclei (Figure 3g,h). The findings that AtTHP1 and AtNUP1 are necessary for nuclear mRNA export provide support for the hypothesis that they are components of the putative Arabidopsis TREX-2 complex. Consistent with its mRNA export defect, atnup1-1, a knockdown line (Figure 3d), exhibited diverse developmental defects, including fewer rosette leaves, longer secondary branches and reduced fertility (Figure 3e). atnup1-2 is apparently a gametophytic-lethal or a homozygous sporophytic-lethal mutation, as over 300 progeny from heterozygous parent were genotyped and no homozygous insertion plants were found. By contrast, experiments with AtSAC3s suggest that they are not required for nuclear mRNA export. We identified T-DNA insertion mutations in each of the Arabidopsis SAC3 genes (Figure 4a) that all appeared to be null mutations (Figure 4b), and created all possible atsac3a, atsac3b and atsac3c double mutant combinations and a triple mutant. However, none of the single, double or triple atsac3 mutations showed defects in nuclear mRNA export (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, we did not observe any morphological mutant phenotype in the single, double or triple mutants. [[FIGURE]] Although the AtSAC3 subunits do not appear to be required for nuclear mRNA export, we obtained evidence of their functional interaction with Arabidopsis TREX-2 subunits. As shown in Figure 4(c), an atthp1 atsac3b double mutant was smaller in stature and exhibited a reduction in fertility compared with the single mutants. atthp1-3 atsac3b-1 is sterile, while atthp1-3 atsac3b-2 set a few seeds. We also investigated the effects of AtTHP1 and AtSAC3B on ethylene responses, because both have been implicated recently as playing similar roles to each other in the ethylene-signaling pathway (CITATION; McClellan et al., 2008, see http://www.arabidopsis.org– TAIR accession/publication number 501727765). We found that atthp1-3 and atsac3b-1 but not atsac3a and atsac3c single mutants exhibited enhanced sensitivity to ethylene (Figure 4d). However, the atthp1 atsac3b double mutant showed even greater sensitivity to ethylene (Figure 4d). The morphological analysis and ethylene response experiments suggest a synergistic interaction between AtTHP1 and AtSAC3B. An Arabidopsis homolog of DSS1, AtDSS1(V), was identified in the Y2H screen using AtTHP1 (Table 1). Consistent with this finding, the yeast homolog of DSS1, Sem1, has also been shown recently to be a functional component of the TREX-2 complex (CITATION; CITATION) and is required for nuclear RNA export (CITATION; CITATION). As shown in Figure 5(a), the interaction between AtDSS1(V) and AtTHP1 was confirmed in a Y2H assay. In addition, interaction of AtDSS1(V) with AtCEN2 was also observed (Figure 5a). We validated these interactions using the BiFC assay (Figure 5b,c). We did not detect interaction between AtTHP1 and a second Arabidopsis homolog, AtDSS1(I), in the Y2H assay (Table S1). [[FIGURE]] DSS1 is also a subunit of the 26S proteasome regulatory particle (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We used Y2H experiments to show that AtDSS1(V) and its paralog, AtDSS1(I), both interact with the 26S proteasome subunits RPN3A and RPN3B (Figure 5a), and confirmed these interactions using BiFC assays (Figure 5c–g). This result is consistent with those of CITATION, who demonstrated direct binding of DSS1s from diverse species, including AtDSS1(I), to the proteasome subunit RPN3. The BiFC signal patterns in Figure 5c–g indicating that the AtDSS1–RPN3 complexes are localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm are consistent with the subcellular localization of the Arabidopsis DSS1s (Figure S2) and proteasome subunits. In summary, our data show that Arabidopsis DSS1s are associated with both the TREX-2 complex and the proteasome.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thalianaT-DNA insertion lines for AtSAC3A, B, C, AtNUP1 and AtTHP1 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, and SK6095 was obtained from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (http://www.agr.gc.ca). For propagation, seeds were treated at 4°C in the dark for 3 days before moving them into the growth room. Plants were grown for 16 h in the light at 22°C/8 h in the dark at 18°C. For ethylene response tests, seeds were plated on MS agar plates with or without the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), incubated in the dark and photographed 4 days after germination. Genotypes of mutants were identified by PCR. For RT-PCR analysis, homozygous seeds were spotted on MS agar plates, vernalized, and grown at 22°C for 2 weeks. An appropriate amount (100 mg) of leaves was collected, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com/) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For genetic mapping of the essp1 mutation, mutant plants from the Col background were crossed with wild-type plants of the Ler ecotype. Homozygous essp1 mutants were selected from the F2 segregating population. Genomic DNA extracted from these seedlings was used for PCR-based mapping with simple sequence polymorphism markers, and the essp1 locus was mapped to approximately 37 kb on BAC F3P11. Sequencing of the genomic region revealed a mutation in At2g19560. For the complementation test, a cDNA clone was obtained from RIKEN (http://www.riken.go.jp), and inserted into the pCAMBIA 3300 vector. The resulting construct was introduced into essp1 plants. Over 100 T1 transgenic plants were obtained, and all showed complete rescue of the essp1 phenotype, i.e. wild-type morphology and no GUS activity in leaves. The histochemical GUS assay was performed as described previously (CITATION). Two-week-old wild-type Columbia leaves from plants growing on agar plates were used for cDNA library construction. The AtTHP1 coding sequence was amplified and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pGBKT7 (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/) and confirmed by sequencing. The self-activation test for AtTHP1, leaf cDNA library construction and screening were performed according to Clontech protocols PT3024-1 and PT3529-1. For co-transformation of the bait construct and prey vector harboring the cDNA library, yeast strain AH109 was used, with the LiAc transformation method. After transformation, cells were spread on SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His agar plates, and incubated at 30°C for 5 days and then room temperature for another 3 days. Colonies growing on the SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His plates were analyzed following the manufacturer’s protocol (Clontech). For the directed Y2H test, we constructed two Gateway-compatible vectors pGBKT7-DEST (bait) and pGADT7-DEST (prey) by modifying the pGKBT7 and pGADT7-Rec vectors. The attR1–attR2 cassette from pEarleygate101 (CITATION) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, http://www.promega.com/) followed by sequence confirmation. The plasmid was digested using NdeI and XhoI, and the attR1–attR2 cassette was ligated into pGBKT7 digested with NdeI and SalI, and pGADT7-Rec digested with NdeI and XhoI. A series of 5 μl aliquots of diluted AH109 culture co-transformed with bait and prey constructs was spotted onto /-Trp/-Leu and SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade. Plates were incubated at either 23 or 30°C for up to 5 days. As negative controls, the intact pGBKT7, pGADT7-Rec and newly developed pGBKT7-DEST and pGADT7-DEST vectors were used, but only the pGBKT7 and pGADT7 results are shown as there was no difference between them. All constructs were produced using full-length cDNAs, except AtNUP1, as shown in Figure 3, as the full-length version showed self-activation. Constructs were produced by cloning the target genes into pEarleygate 101 (CITATION). The primers used are the same as those used for Y2H and BiFC (Table S2). The constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis for stable transformation or epidermal Nicotiana benthamiana cell for transient assays. For AtNUP1, a native promoter-driven gene was cloned into pEarleygate301-YFP, which was made by transferring the NcoI–PacI fragment from pEarleygate101 to pEarleygate301. The primers used to amplify the AtNUP1 genomic region, npNupF and NupR, are listed in Table S2. New BiFC vectors pEarleyagte201-YN and pEarleygate202-YC were created based on the Gateway-compatible vectors pEarleygate201 and 202 (CITATION). The N-terminus (amino acids 1–174) and C-terminus (amino acids 175–239) of YFP from vector pEarleygate101 were PCR-amplified using the primers listed in Table S2, and cloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM-T Easy. The N- and C-terminal YFP fragments were then cut out and subcloned into pEarleyhgate201 and pEarleygate202, respectively, at the AvrII site. For infiltration of epidermal N. benthamiana cells, the OD600 of an Agrobacterium strain GV3101 overnight culture containing gene fused N- or C-terminally with YFP was measured, and brought to an optical density of 0.6–1.0. Equal volumes of each culture were mixed and used for infiltrating the epidermal N. benthamiana leaves as previously described (CITATION). The YFP signal was imaged 2–3 days after infiltration. For protein pairs showing a reconstituted YFP signal in the nuclei, the YFP signal and bright-field images were overlaid. For those showing YFP signal in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, only the YFP signal was imaged. The accumulation of mRNA in the wild-type (Col) and mutant nuclei were assayed by in situ hybridization using oligo(dT)50 as a probe as described by CITATION with minor modifications. Leaves from 10-day-old seedlings grown on MS agar plates were fixed in 5 ml fixation buffer (120 mm NaCl, 7 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 80 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% DMSO and 5% formaldehyde) under vacuum for 10 min, followed by adding an equal volume of heptane and gently shaking for 20 min. After 5 min washes, twice in methanol and three times in absolute ethanol, samples were incubated in 1:1 ethanol:xylene for 30 min. Leaves were then sequentially washed for 5 min twice with ethanol, once with methanol and once with 1:1 methanol:fixation buffer without formaldehyde, before being post-fixed using fixation buffer for an additional 30 min. Samples were then incubated for 5 min once with fixation buffer and twice with 1 × blocking buffer (Roche, http://www.roche.com) before being subjected to blocking for 1–2 h at 50°C. After blocking, oligo(dT)50 with a 5′ 6-fluorescein tag was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg ml−1, and incubated for more than 8 h at 50°C in the dark. After hybridization, leaves were washed once for 30 min with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once for 20 min with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C. The fluorescein signal was assayed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (http://www.leica.com/) with an argon excitation laser of 514 nm and fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. The amino acid sequence alignment and the subsequent unrooted dendrogram construction of the three Arabidopsis SCA3 family proteins identified in this study and other SAC3 proteins from Arabidopsis, yeast, human and rice were performed following the MEGA4.0.2 program package (http://www.megasoftware.net/index.html). The alignment was performed by ClustalW using a BLOSUM matrix with a gap opening penalty of 10 for both pairwise and multiple alignment, and gap extension penalties of 0.1 and 0.2 for pairwise and multiple alignment, respectively. The resulting alignment was then used to generate the unrooted dendrogram using the neighbor-joining Poisson correction with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The input order of the sequences was randomized. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers At2g19560 (THP1), At2g39340 (SAC3A), At3g06290(SAC3B), At3g54380 (SAC3C), At3g10650 (NUP1), At1g64750 [DSS1(I)], At5g45010 [DSS1(V)], At3g50360 (CEN1), At4g37010 (CEN2), At3g27100 (SUS1), At1g20200 (RPN3A), At1g75990 (RPN3B), At1g64520 (RPN12A), At5g42040 (RPN12B), NP_588432 (Sp Sac3), Q12049 (Sc Ypr045c), EDN60497 (Sc Sac3), NP_501328 (Ce Sac3), AAI04959 (Hs Sac3), NP_195051 (At eIF3K), NP_116710 (Sc RPN12), NP_037366 (Hs eIF3K), NP_001049175 (Os eIF3K), NP_002803 (Hs RPN12), NP_596750 (Sp RPN12) and NP_496489 (Ce RPN12).
