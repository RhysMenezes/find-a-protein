!~ABS~! Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-trigged immunity (PTI) is the first defensive line of plant innate immunity and is mediated by pattern recognition receptors. Here, we show that a mutation in BR-SIGNALING KINASE1 (BSK1), a substrate of the brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1, suppressed the powdery mildew resistance caused by a mutation in ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE2, which negatively regulates powdery mildew resistance and programmed cell death, in Arabidopsis thaliana. A loss-of-function bsk1 mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent pathogens, including Golovinomyces cichoracearum, Pseudomonas syringae, and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. The bsk1 mutant also accumulated lower levels of salicylic acid upon infection with G. cichoracearum and P. syringae. BSK1 belongs to a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase family and displays kinase activity in vitro; this kinase activity is required for its function. BSK1 physically associates with the PAMP receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 and is required for a subset of flg22-induced responses, including the reactive oxygen burst, but not for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our data demonstrate that BSK1 is involved in positive regulation of PTI. Together with previous findings, our work indicates that BSK1 represents a key component directly involved in both BR signaling and plant immunity.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis edr2 mutant displays enhanced disease resistance to the virulent powdery mildew strain G. cichoracearum UCSC1 (CITATION; CITATION). To identify components involved in edr2-mediated resistance, we conducted a mutant screen for edr2 suppressors (CITATION). In this screen, we identified a mutant that we named bsk1-1 based on subsequent characterization. Upon infection with G. cichoracearum, at 8 d after infection (DAI), the edr2 bsk1-1 mutant displayed a large number of conidia and lacked visible mildew-induced lesions. This is in contrast with edr2 leaves, which produced very few conidia and showed prominent cell death (Figures 1A and 1B). To further assess the edr2 bsk1-1 phenotype, we quantified fungal growth by counting the number of conidiophores (asexual reproductive structures) per colony in the wild type, edr2, and edr2 bsk1-1. The edr2 mutants showed significantly fewer conidiophores than the wild-type plants after infection with G. cichoracearum at 5 DAI; however, the number of conidiophores in the edr2 bsk1-1 plants was significantly more than in edr2 and wild-type plants (Figure 1C), indicating that the bsk1-1 mutation fully suppressed edr2-mediated resistance to powdery mildew. [[FIGURE]] Previously, it was shown that edr2 accumulates more hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) upon infection with G. cichoracearum (CITATION), and H2O2 accumulation appears to occur at the site of fungal infection (CITATION). To examine whether the bsk1-1 mutation affects H2O2 accumulation in edr2, we assessed H2O2 accumulation in wild-type, edr2, and edr2 bsk1-1 plants after infection with G. cichoracearum at 2 DAI. Consistent with previous findings, edr2 accumulated more H2O2 than the wild type at 2 DAI; however, this high level of H2O2 accumulation was suppressed by the bsk1-1 mutation (Figure 1D). In addition to the enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, the edr2 mutant displays increased ethylene-induced senescence phenotypes, indicating possible crosstalk between defense responses and senescence (CITATION; CITATION). To investigate whether bsk1-1 affects edr2-mediated ethylene-induced senescence, we treated edr2 bsk1-1 with ethylene for 3 d and assessed the leaf senescence. The enhanced ethylene-induced senescence phenotype in edr2 was also suppressed by the bsk1-1 mutation (Figures 1E and 1F). To gain insight into the molecular basis that underlies the suppression of edr2 phenotypes by bsk1-1, we examined the transcript levels of several defense-related genes in edr2 bsk1-1 plants at different time points after G. cichoracearum infection. Previously, it was shown that edr2-mediated resistance requires intact SA signaling; therefore, we selected several marker genes for the SA pathway, including PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE1 (PR1), PR2, FLAVIN-DEPENDENT MONOOXYGENASE1 (FMO1), PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4), and SID2, which are all widely used marker genes and are upregulated when defense responses are activated (CITATION; CITATION). All those defense-related genes were induced more strongly in edr2 than in wild-type plants at 3 DAI, and in edr2 bsk1-1, the levels of transcript of those genes were significantly lower than in edr2 (see Supplemental Figures 1A to 1E online), indicating that bsk1-1 suppressed upregulation of defense-related genes in edr2 during G. cichoracearum infection. In the bsk1-1 single mutant, the levels of transcript of those genes were similar to that in the wild type, only the PR2 transcript levels accumulated at significantly lower levels than in the wild type at 3 DAI upon G. cichoracearum infection (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). bsk1-1 is a recessive mutant, as the edr2/edr2 bsk1-1/BSK1 plants displayed edr2-like powdery mildew resistance phenotypes. To identify the bsk1-1 mutation, we performed a standard map-based cloning approach (Figure 1G) and identified a mutation (G→A) in At4g35230, which caused an amino acid change (R443Q) in the predicted open reading frame (Figure 1H). To confirm that At4g35230 is the responsible gene, we made a genomic clone construct for At4g35230 and transformed edr2 bsk1-1 with the construct. We inoculated multiple T1 plants with G. cichoracearum and found that the transgenic plants were all resistant to powdery mildew, a phenotype indistinguishable from the edr2 single mutant. Therefore, the At4g35230 genomic clone complemented the bsk1-1 phenotype (Figures 1A to 1C), indicating that the mutation identified in At4g35230 causes the bsk1-1 phenotype. At4g35230 was previously designated BR-SIGNALING KINASE1 (BSK1) (CITATION). BSK1 encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) belonging to the RLCK-XII phylogenetic clade, which comprises 12 proteins in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION). The BSK1 protein consists of an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. The TPR domain is thought to be involved in protein–protein interactions (CITATION). The bsk1-1 mutation (R443Q) is in the TPR domain and the Arg residue at position 443 in BSK1 is strictly conserved in the Arabidopsis BSK1 protein family (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). In addition, knockdown of BSK1 by RNA interference (RNAi) also suppressed edr2-mediated powdery mildew resistance, indicating that suppression of edr2 phenotypes in edr2 bsk1-1 was caused by loss of BSK1 function (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). The mutation in several BSK1-like genes, including BSK2, BSK3, BSK6, BSK8, and BSK12, did not suppress edr2-mediated powdery mildew resistance (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). To further investigate the role of BSK1 in powdery mildew resistance, we crossed bsk1-1 with several well-characterized resistant mutants, including edr1, mildew resistance locus O2 (mlo2), powdery mildew resistant4 (pmr4), and autophagy-related2 (atg2), which all show SA-dependent powdery mildew resistance, except for mlo2 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The edr1 bsk1-1, mLo2 bsk1-1, and pmr4 bsk1-1 plants were susceptible to G. cichoracearum, showing a large number of spores, indicating that bsk1-1 suppressed the edr1, mlo2, and pmr4-mediated powdery mildew resistance phenotypes (see Supplemental Figures 4A to 4C online). Previously, mlo2 was shown to display an early senescence phenotype, and this phenotype is SA dependent but jasmonic acid and ethylene independent (CITATION). The mlo2-mediated senescence was suppressed in the mlo2 bsk1-1 double mutant, indicating that this phenotype also requires BSK1 function (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). By contrast, the atg2 bsk1-1 plants displayed mildew-induced cell death phenotypes similar to atg2, indicating that bsk1-1 could not suppress the disease resistance and mildew-induced cell death phenotypes of atg2 (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). To further explore the role of BSK1 in defense responses, we first challenged the bsk1-1 single mutant with G. cichoracearum, followed by quantification of conidiophore formation. The bsk1-1 mutant was more susceptible and supported significantly more spores than wild-type plants (see Supplemental Figures 4A to 4C online), indicating that BSK1 is required for basal resistance to G. cichoracearum. To investigate whether BSK1 plays a role in resistance to other pathogens, we infected bsk1-1 with the virulent bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pto) DC3000 and the avirulent Pto DC3000 strains that carry the effector genes avrRpt2 or avrPphB. The effectors encoded by avrRpt2 and avrPphB are recognized by the coiled-coil-NBS-LRR resistance proteins RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE2 (RPS2) or RPS5, respectively. We found that the bsk1-1 mutant was more susceptible to the virulent and avirulent strains of Pto DC3000, as it supports significantly more growth of all the bacterial strains than the wild type 3 DAI (Figures 2A to 2C). In addition, bsk1-1 accumulated lower PR1 transcript levels than the wild type during infection with Pto DC3000 (Figure 3A). Similarly, the BSK1-RNAi plants also displayed enhanced susceptibility to Pto DC3000 (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). These data indicate that BSK1 plays an important role in resistance to both virulent and avirulent Pto DC3000 strains. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the role of BSK1 in defense responses, we infected bsk1-1 with H. arabidopsidis (H. a.) Noco2, a virulent oomycete pathogen that causes downy mildew disease in Arabidopsis. The bsk1-1 mutant was more susceptible than wild-type plants, supporting the growth of more H. a. Noco2 sporangiophores than the wild type (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 8 online), indicating that the disease resistance to downy mildew also requires BSK1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BSK1 plays an important role in resistance to a variety of pathogens. The bsk1-1 suppressed edr1, edr2, and pmr4-mediated resistance and showed enhanced susceptibility to several biotrophic pathogens, suggesting that bsk1-1 may have defects in SA accumulation. To investigate whether bsk1-1 affects SA production, we measured the SA levels in bsk1-1 before and after G. cichoracearum infection. We used pad4, an enhanced susceptibility mutant that accumulates lower levels of SA upon pathogen infection (CITATION) as a susceptible control. As shown in Figure 3B, edr2 accumulated much higher levels of SA than the wild type upon G. cichoracearum infection; however, bsk1-1 suppressed higher accumulation of SA levels in edr2. Also, SA levels were lower in the bsk1-1 mutant than the wild type at 3 DAI with G. cichoracearum. Similarly, the accumulation of SA in bsk1-1 was significantly lower than in the wild type after Pto DC3000 infection (Figure 3C). This observation indicates that the enhanced susceptibility to G. cichoracearum and Pto DC3000 may, at least partially, be caused by lower SA production in the bsk1-1 mutant. This may also partially explain why bsk1-1 suppresses edr2 resistance, as previously it was shown that the powdery mildew resistant phenotype in edr2 was suppressed by the sid2 and npr1 mutations, which cause defects in SA accumulation and signaling, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). Previously, it was shown that BSK1 localizes to the plasma membrane (CITATION). The BSK1 protein contains a myristoylation site at its N terminus, which is a potential membrane localization signal (CITATION). To examine whether the myristoylation site is critical for BSK1 membrane localization, we created a BSK1 mutant with a disrupted myristoylation site (G2A) and fused it to green fluorescent protein (GFP). We then transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts with the construct. The BSK1 G2A-GFP fusion protein did not exclusively localize to the cell periphery (Figure 4A). To further investigate the role of the myristoylation site in BSK1, we generated constructs to express BSK1-HA or the G2A mutant form of BSK1-HA (BSK1 G2A-HA) under the control of the BSK1 promoter and stably transformed edr2 bsk1-1 plants with the construct. Both the BSK1-HA and BSK1 G2A-HA transgenic plants expressed fusion proteins of the correct sizes, as detected by immunoblot analysis (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). We then performed immunoblots with total protein and soluble and membrane fractions from 4-week-old transgenic plants. Consistent with the confocal microscopy observations, BSK1-HA was detected in the membrane fraction, but not in the soluble fraction; by contrast, BSK1 G2A-HA was detected only in the soluble fraction (Figure 4B). We infected the transgenic plants with G. cichoracearum and examined whether BSK1-HA and BSK1 G2A-HA restored the edr2-like resistant phenotype in the edr2 bsk1-1 background; as shown in Figures 4C to 4E, transgenic edr2 bsk1-1 plants carrying BSK1-HA were indistinguishable from edr2 mutants in powdery mildew resistance, indicating that BSK1-HA is functional. However, by contrast, BSK1 G2A-HA was unable to complement the bsk1-1 phenotype (Figures 4C to 4E), strongly suggesting that membrane localization is essential for BSK1 function. [[FIGURE]] Previously, CITATION showed that amino acid Ser-230 in BSK1 is the major phosphorylation site for the BR receptor BRI1. To examine whether the phosphorylation of this amino acid is important for BSK1 function in disease resistance, we generated a mutant form of BSK1-HA that contained an S230A substitution and transformed edr2 bsk1-1 with BSK1 S230A. Interestingly, this construct was able to fully restore the edr2 resistant phenotypes in the edr2 bsk1-1 background (Figures 4C to 4E), indicating that the phosphorylation of this amino acid is not essential for BSK1 function in suppression of the edr2-mediated defense responses. To examine whether BSK1 has protein kinase activity, we produced BSK1 in Escherichia coli and performed in vitro kinase assays. BSK1 could autophosphorylate in vitro, and its kinase activity required Mn2+, instead of Mg2+, as a divalent cation cofactor (Figure 5A). To test whether the kinase activity is required for the BSK1 function, we generated and transformed edr2 bsk1-1 with a kinase-deficient form of BSK1 (K104E). We infected 4-week-old transgenic plants with G. cichoracearum. The kinase-deficient form of BSK1 failed to restore the edr2 resistant phenotypes in the edr2 bsk1-1 background (Figures 5B and 5C), indicating that kinase activity is required for BSK1 function. [[FIGURE]] Previously, BSK1 was shown to be involved in BR signaling as a substrate for the BR receptor BRI1 (CITATION). Also, the BR signaling component BAK1 was shown to play a role in basal defense; therefore, we investigated whether BAK1 and BSK1 share similar functions in plant immunity. However, the edr2 bak1-4 double mutant displayed edr2-like powdery mildew resistance phenotypes, indicating that edr2-activated disease resistance does not require BAK1 (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Previously, it was shown that BRI1 SUPPRESSOR1 (BSU1), an important player in BR signaling, interacts with BSK1 in vivo (CITATION). We also tested whether BSU1 and BSU-LIKE1 (BSL1) are required for edr2-mediated disease resistance. Neither bsu1 nor bsl1 mutations affected edr2-mediated powdery mildew resistance (see Supplemental Figure 10 online), indicating that edr2-activated defense signaling is independent of BSU1 and BSL1 function. The bsk1-1 mutants did not show obvious growth defects, but bsk1-1 leaves were slightly narrower than wild-type leaves, and this phenotype was complemented by a genomic BSK1 clone (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). The narrow leaf phenotype in bsk1-1 could be an indication of activation of BR signaling. To assess the BR responses in the bsk1-1 mutant, we treated the bsk1-1 seedlings with different concentrations of brassinolide (BL) for 7 d and measured the root lengths. The wild-type seedlings displayed typical BL responses, with much shorter roots than those of the bri1-9 mutant, which was consistent with previous observations (CITATION), while the bsk1-1 seedlings and BSK1 RNAi lines were very similar to the wild type, displaying inhibited root growth (see Supplemental Figure 12A online). In addition, to test the activity of BL signaling in the bsk1-1 mutant, we also performed hypocotyl elongation assays on etiolated seedlings in the presence or absence of brassinazole (BRZ), a BR biosynthesis inhibitor (CITATION). The bsk3-1 and bri1-9 mutants were more sensitive to BRZ than the wild type and showed lower relative hypocotyl lengths (CITATION); by contrast, the bsk1-1 mutant and BSK1 RNAi line were indistinguishable from the wild type in response to BRZ (see Supplemental Figure 12B online). In addition, the transcript accumulation of two BL-responsive genes, SAUR-AC and DWF4 in the bsk1-1 and BSK1 RNAi plants, was very similar to that of the wild type in the presence or absence of 100 nM BL (see Supplemental Figures 12C and 12D online). These data indicate that bsk1 displays wild-type phenotypes in response to BL treatment. Previously, BSK1 was identified as a possible component of an RPS2 protein complex, and the PAMP receptor FLS2 has also been shown to physically associate with RPS2 (CITATION). To investigate whether BSK1 forms a protein complex with FLS2, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays by transiently expressing BSK1-FLAG and FLS2-YFP-HA in N. benthamiana leaves. We expressed FLS2-YFP-HA alone as a negative control. BSK1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and in the precipitate, FLS2 was detected with anti-GFP antibody only from the leaves that coexpressed both BSK1-FLAG and FLS2-YFP-HA, not from the negative control leaves that only expressed FLS2-YFP-HA (Figure 6A). These observations indicate that BSK1 and FLS2 form a protein complex in N. benthamiana. Previously, it was shown that FLS2 and BAK1 form a complex in a ligand-dependent manner (CITATION). To validate the N. benthamiana system, we expressed both BAK1-FLAG and FLS2-YFP-HA in N. benthamiana leaves as a control; consistent with previous findings, BAK1 only associated with FLS2 upon flg22 treatment. This observation indicated that ectopic expression in the N. benthamiana system did not alter the behavior of the FLS2 and BAK1 proteins. However, the association of BSK1 and FLS2 occurs without flg22 treatment (Figure 6A), and it appears that there is less interaction in the presence of flg22 (Figure 6A). This observation was reproducible in four independent experiments. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the interaction of BSK1 and FLS2 in Arabidopsis, we performed a Co-IP assay by expressing BSK1-GFP and FLS2-FLAG in Arabidopsis protoplasts. We expressed FLS2-FLAG alone as a negative control. We extracted total protein from the protoplasts, immunoprecipitated BSK1 protein with GFP antibody, and then examined whether FLS2-FLAG coimmunoprecipitated with BSK1. FLS2 was detected with anti-FLAG antibody only from the protoplasts that coexpressed both BSK1-GFP and FLS2-FLAG, not from the negative control (Figure 6B), indicating that BSK1 and FLS2 form a protein complex in Arabidopsis. Similarly, we also expressed both BAK1-GFP and FLS2-FLAG in Arabidopsis protoplasts as controls and found that BAK1 only associates with FLS2 upon flg22 elicitation (Figure 6B), validating the protoplast system. To further confirm the physical association of BSK1 and FLS2, we performed Co-IP assays using stably transformed transgenic plants that express both BSK1pro:BSK1-Myc and 35Spro:FLS2-YFP-HA. Transgenic plants that express only 35Spro:FLS2-YFP-HA were used as a negative control. BSK1-Myc restored the phenotype of bsk1-1 mutants (see Supplemental Figures 13A and 13B online), and the 35Spro:FLS2-YFP-HA clone was able to complement the fls2 phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 13C online), indicating that the BSK1-Myc and FLS2-YFP-HA proteins are functional. We extracted total protein from the transgenic plants and immunoprecipitated the BSK1 protein with Myc antibody or with unrelated FLAG antibody as a negative control. We then examined whether FLS2 was in the precipitate by immunoblotting with HA antibody. The FLS2-YFP-HA protein was detected only in the sample immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody, not in the negative controls (Figure 6C). This observation indicated that BSK1-Myc physically associates with FLS2-YFP-HA in Arabidopsis. BSK1 is a receptor-like cytoplasmic protein kinase with an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal TPR domain. The TPR motif was originally identified in yeast as a protein–protein interaction domain (CITATION; CITATION). Many TPR-containing proteins serve as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, and the TPR motif facilitates specific interactions between partners (CITATION; CITATION). The bsk1-1 mutation causes a substitution of a strictly conserved residue (Arg-443) in the TPR motif (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). This mutation may disrupt BSK1 function by affecting interactions between BSK1 and its partner(s). To investigate whether this mutation affects the association of BSK1 and FLS2, we examined whether the mutated version of BSK1 forms a complex with FLS2. As shown in Figures 6D and 6E, the mutated version of BSK1 forms a complex with FLS2 in both N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis, which was similar to the wild-type BSK1 protein, indicating that the bsk1-1 mutation did not affect the association of BSK1 and FLS2. This observation suggests that the bsk1-1 phenotype is not caused by the defects of BSK1(R443) in association with FLS2. Since BSK1 physically associates with FLS2, we hypothesized that BSK1 may be involved in some flg22-induced responses mediated by FLS2. To test this hypothesis, we treated wild-type and bsk1-1 leaves with 100 nM flg22 and measured the ROS burst, a marker for early basal defense responses. The fls2 mutant was insensitive to flg22; upon flg22 treatment, ROS accumulated rapidly in the wild type, but not in the fls2 mutant. By contrast, the accumulation of ROS in bsk1-1 was partially impaired, indicating that bsk1-1 had defects in the flg22-induced ROS burst (Figures 7A and 7B). The defects of bsk1-1 in flg22-trigged ROS accumulation were complemented by a genomic BSK1 clone (Figures 7A and 7B). Similarly, the BSK1 RNAi plants also showed bsk1-1 like defects in ROS accumulation upon flg22 treatment (see Supplemental Figures 14A and 14B online). When treated with higher concentrations of flg22, bsk1-1 also showed similar defects in ROS accumulation (see Supplemental Figures 14C and 14D online). To examine whether bsk1-1 has a general defect in ROS accumulation, we examined ROS accumulation in bsk1-1 in response to elf18 (derived from bacterial PAMP elongation factor Tu), which is specifically recognized by EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) in Arabidopsis (CITATION). Consistent with previous findings, the efr-1 mutant was insensitive to elf18, but bsk1-1 rapidly accumulated large amounts of ROS upon elf18 treatment, which was very similar to the wild type (see Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B online). Although the effect of bsk1-1 mutation on elf18 responses needs to be further characterized, this observation suggests that bsk1-1 does not have a substantial defect in ROS accumulation triggered by elf18. Consistent with the role of BSK1 in flg22-induced responses, BSK1 transcript accumulation increased following flg22 treatment (Figure 7C). The level of flg22-induced PR1 expression was much lower in bsk1-1 than in the wild type (Figure 7D). By contrast, PR1 accumulation induced by elf18 was similar between bsk1-1 and the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 15C online). To further investigate the role of BSK1 in flg22-induced responses, we also examined the effects of bsk1-1 on the activation of MAPKs by flg22. In the wild type, MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 were rapidly activated, and the activation of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 was abolished in the fls2 mutant, which is consistent with previous findings (CITATION). However, MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 were strongly activated in bsk1-1, which was similar to the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 16A online). Similarly, under our experimental conditions, the induction of three flg22-induced genes, At1g51890, At2g17740, and At2g19190 (CITATION), was not significantly affected in bsk1-1 (see Supplemental Figures 16B to 16D online). To characterize the late responses of bsk1-1 to flg22, we treated bsk1-1 and wild-type seedlings with flg22 for 10 d and found that flg22 inhibited seedling growth in the wild type and bsk1-1, but not in the fls2 mutant (see Supplemental Figure 16E online). Taken together, these data suggest that the bsk1-1 mutant only compromises a subset of FLS2-mediated responses. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the reason we did not observe effects of bsk1-1 was due to a relatively high dose of flg22 (100 nM) used in the experiments. Such potential quantitative effects of flg22 treatment on bsk1-1–related phenotypes should be investigated in the future. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The edr2 bsk1-1 mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate–mutagenized edr2 population (CITATION). Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in the growth room at 20 to 22°C under a 9-h-light/15-h-dark cycle for phenotyping or a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle for seed set, as described previously (CITATION). Powdery mildew pathogen Golovinomyces cichoracearum strain UCSC1 was maintained on pad4-1 as described previously (CITATION). To achieve an even distribution of conidia, inoculations were performed as described (CITATION). To quantify fungal growth and conidiation, the number of conidiophores per colony was counted at 5 DAI as described by CITATION. To visualize fungal hyphae and dead cells, infected leaves were stained with trypan blue as described (CITATION). H2O2 accumulation was observed by 3,3′-diamino benzidine-HCl staining, and to visualize fungal structures, the infected leaves were further stained with trypan blue (CITATION). Pto DC3000 infection was performed as described (CITATION). Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (H. a.) Noco 2 infection was also performed as described previously (CITATION). Ethylene-induced senescence assays and measurement of the chlorophyll content were performed as previously described (CITATION). To create the mapping population, we crossed edr2 bsk1-1 (in Col-0 background) with ecotype Landsberg erecta. The F2 plants homozygous for edr2 were identified and inoculated with G. cichoracearum. Initially, we mapped bsk1-1 to chromosome 4 between markers M4I22 and nga1107. We then developed our own molecular markers at intervals between these two markers using Monsanto Col-0 and Landsberg erecta polymorphism data (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/browse/Cereon/index.jsp). We used ∼2500 plants from F3 families that were homozygous for edr2, but segregating for powdery mildew resistance. Ultimately, bsk1-1 was mapped to a 20-kb region between markers T12J5-AflII and F23E12-PstI. All five genes in the genetic interval were amplified and sequenced directly. To complement the edr2 bsk1-1 mutant, the genomic sequence including 1622 bp upstream of the ATG start codon and 1210 bp downstream of the stop codon of At4g35230 was cloned into binary vector pCambia1300 (http://www.cambia.org.au) for complementation analysis. The derived genomic construct was verified by sequencing and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. The edr2 bsk1-1 plants were transformed using the floral dip method (CITATION). Sequences of BSKs family members were identified by BLAST searches at http://www.Arabidopsis.org/Blast/index.jsp. Multiple sequence alignments were produced using ClustalW with default parameters (http://sci.cnb.uam.es/Services/MolBio/clustalw/). The multiple-alignment file was further analyzed with BoxShade online software (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The following T-DNA mutants were obtained from the ABRC (www.Arabidopsis.org): Salk_001600 (bsk2-3), Salk_096500C (bsk3-1) (CITATION), Salk_063711C (bsk6-1), Salk_077982C (bsk8-1), Salk_051462 (bsk12-1), Salk_079850C (mlo2-7), Salk_030721 (bsu1-1) (CITATION), and Salk_151344C (bsl1-2). To generate double mutants, the edr2 bsk1-1 mutant was crossed with edr1, pmr4-1, atg2-2, bak1-4, and the above T-DNA insertion mutants. All the plants mentioned above were in the ecotype Col-0 background. To visualize BSK1 subcellular localization, the 1.6-kb BSK1 promoter region and the full-length BSK1 coding sequence (CDS) without stop codon were amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA or cDNA. The BSK1pro:BSK1 CDS was cloned into the pEGAD vector between the PacI and AgeI multiple cloning sites to remove the 35S promoter from the vector with GFP in frame at the C terminus. Protoplasts isolated from 4-week-old Col-0 plants were transfected with the GFP constructs as described (CITATION). Twelve hours after transfection, GFP fluorescence was visualized using an Olympus FV500 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 505 to 550 nm. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed as described previously (CITATION). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA from 2 μg of total RNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green Premix Extaq (Takara) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The ACTIN2 gene was used as an internal control for normalizing the amount of cDNA. SA extraction and measurement were performed as previously described (CITATION). The full-length BSK1 CDS without stop codon was amplified by PCR from Col-0 cDNA or bsk1-1 mutant cDNA and inserted into the Gateway vector pDONR207 using a BP Clonase kit (Invitrogen) to create a pDONA207-BSK1 CDS or pDONA207-BSK1 CDSm entry clone. The inserts were next subcloned using an LR Clonase kit (Invitrogen) into the pEarleyGate 103 destination vector with 35S promoter and C-terminal GFP fusion (CITATION) or into the pGWB11 vector with C-terminal FLAG fusion (CITATION). FLS2 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA and subcloned into pEarleyGate 101 (C-terminal YFP-HA) through Gateway technology. BAK1 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA and subcloned into the pEarleyGate 103 vector. The FLS2pro:FLS2-FLAG and BAK1pro:BAK1-FLAG plasmids were kindly provided by Jian-Min Zhou (CITATION). To generate a BSK1 RNAi construct, a 418-bp fragment at the 3′-end was amplified by PCR. The PCR product was first cloned into pKANNIBAL (CITATION), resulting in an inverted repeat separated by an intron fragment. The derived construct was then digested with NotI and ligated to pART27 expression vector (CITATION). To produce a kinase-dead version of BSK1, a conserved Lys residue at position 104 in the ATP binding site was substituted with a Glu using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Both the genomic DNA and CDS of BSK1 were mutated. The K104E mutated genomic DNA was cloned into the binary vector pCambia1300 for complementation tests. The wild-type and mutant CDS were digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the pMAL-c2G expression vector for kinase activity assays. Similarly, BSK1 (G2A) and BSK1 (S230A) were also generated using site-directed mutagenesis as described above. The mutated fragments were subcloned into the pEGAD vector to create the BSK1pro:BSK1 CDS G2A-GFP vector for GFP observation in protoplasts. In addition, BSK1pro:BSK1 CDS, BSK1pro:BSK1 CDS G2A, and BSK1pro:BSK1 CDS S230A were PCR amplified and inserted into the Gateway vector pDONR207 and then cloned into the pEarleyGate 301 destination vector with C-terminal HA fusion. The BSK1pro:BSK1 CDS was also cloned into pEarleyGate 303 destination vector with C-terminal Myc fusion. ROS assay was performed as described previously (CITATION). Each data point consists of at least 12 replicates. Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized, rinsed in sterile water, and grown vertically on plates containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts plus 0.8% agar. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred into liquid half-strength MS (two seedlings per well of 24-well plate) with or without flg22 and incubated for 10 d. The fresh weight of seedlings was measured, and the relative growth was documented by comparing with the untreated control. Expression of the MBP-BSK1 fusion proteins in pMAL-c2G expression vector were induced by 0.3 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 28°C. The recombinant proteins were affinity purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described (CITATION). MAPK activation was performed as described (CITATION) with minor modifications. Fourteen-day-old seedlings in liquid half-strength MS media were treated with 100 nM flg22 for 0, 5, or 15 min. Seedlings were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted with MAPK extraction buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 20 min. Crude proteins were quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) using BSA as a standard. Equal amounts of proteins (200 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotting. Phosphorylated MAPKs were detected by incubation with anti-p42/44 MAPK antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) in 5% BSA in TBS-Tween overnight, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies for 1 h. Agrobacterium GV3101 carrying different plasmids were suspended in infiltration buffer as described (CITATION) to OD600 = 0.8. For coinfiltration, equal volumes of agrobacteria carrying different constructs were mixed prior to infiltration so that the concentration of each strain was OD600 = 0.4. Five-week-old N. benthamiana leaves were used for transient expression. Two days later, leaf samples were syringe infiltrated with or without 1 μM flg22 for 10 min before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Leaves were ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and extracted with 2 mL of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [v/v] IGEPAL CA-630 [Sigma-Aldrich], and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich])/g tissue powder. The samples were left on ice with gentle shaking for 1 h to solubilize membrane proteins and centrifuged at 16,000g at 4°C for 30 min. Supernatants (1 mL) were incubated with 3 μL α-HA or α-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation, and then 40 μL of 50% (v/v) protein G agarose beads (Millipore) slurry was added and incubated for another 4 h. Following incubation, the beads were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630 and once with PBS. After the last centrifugation, the PBS buffer was removed completely. Eighty microliters of PBS and 20 μL 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added, and the beads were boiled for 10 min. The presence of FLS2 or BSK1 protein was detected by α-HA or α-GFP (Roche) immunoblot. For Co-IP experiments in protoplasts, 1 mL of protoplasts was transfected with 200 μg plasmid DNA and incubated for 16 h before being treated with or without 1 μM flg22 for 10 min as described (CITATION). For Co-IP experiments in transgenic Arabidopsis, transgenic fls2 plants expressing 35Spro:FLS-YFP-HA were crossed with edr2 bsk1-1 transgenic plants expressing BSK1pro:BSK1-Myc. Total protein was extracted from 3-week-old F2 seedlings expressing both the FLS2-YFP-HA and BSK1-Myc proteins or from the fls2 transgenic seedlings expressing 35Spro:FLS-YFP-HA alone. Co-IP assay was performed as described above. Microsomal and soluble protein fractionations were prepared according to CITATION with minor modifications. Briefly, ∼100 mg of 14-d-old seedlings was ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted with cold Suc buffer as described (CITATION). Samples were centrifuged at 2000g at 4°C for 15 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatants were further ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C to separate soluble and microsomal fractions. Immunoblots were performed as described (CITATION). GAPDH and H+-ATPase were used as cytosolic marker or plasma membrane marker, detected by anti-GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-H+-ATPase (Agrisera), respectively.
