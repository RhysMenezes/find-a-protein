!~ABS~! An Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) multigene family (predicted to be more than 20 members) encodes plant C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatases that dephosphorylate Ser residues in tandem heptad repeat sequences of the RNA polymerase II C terminus. CTD phosphatase-like (CPL) isoforms 1 and 3 are regulators of osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Evidence presented herein indicates that CPL3 and CPL4 are homologs of a prototype CTD phosphatase, FCP1 (TFIIF-interacting CTD-phosphatase). CPL3 and CPL4 contain catalytic FCP1 homology and breast cancer 1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. Recombinant CPL3 and CPL4 interact with AtRAP74, an Arabidopsis ortholog of a FCP1-interacting TFIIF subunit. A CPL3 or CPL4 C-terminal fragment that contains the BRCT domain mediates molecular interaction with AtRAP74. Consistent with their predicted roles in transcriptional regulation, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins of CPL3, CPL4, and RAP74 all localize to the nucleus. cpl3 mutations that eliminate the BRCT or FCP1 homology domain cause ABA hyperactivation of the stress-inducible RD29a promoter, whereas RNAi suppression of CPL4 results in dwarfism and reduced seedling growth. These results indicate CPL3 and CPL4 are a paralogous pair of general transcription regulators with similar biochemical properties, but are required for the distinct developmental and environmental responses. CPL4 is necessary for normal plant growth and thus most orthologous to fungal and metazoan FCP1, whereas CPL3 is an isoform that specifically facilitates ABA signaling.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis genome contains two predicted open reading frames (ORFs), At2g33540 (CPL3) and At5g58000 (CPL4), which encode proteins with FCP1 domains. We determined previously that CPL3 encodes a functional phosphatase that regulates stress-responsive transcription and, to a lesser extent, plant growth and development (CITATION). Genome annotation (The Arabidopsis Information Resource [TAIR]) indicates that At5g58000 encodes CPL4; however, sequence analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) clone M74J20STM established that polyadenylation occurs at position 2,647 of At5g58000.1 (Fig. 1A ), upstream of the predicted phosphatase-coding sequence. The presence of several EST sequences corresponding to the phosphatase region (GenBank accession nos. BX831510, BX832589, BX832758, BX830307, and BX831690) indicates that CPL4 is transcribed from the second ORF separated from the upstream ORF encoding M74J20STM. [[FIGURE]] Analysis of 5′-RACE products identified the CPL4 transcription start site at base 23,497,005 of chromosome V. The CPL4 ORF encodes a 440-amino acid polypeptide that contains a catalytic FCPH domain and a BRCT domain (Fig. 1A). Sequence identities between CPL3 and CPL4 are 44.2% and 54.3% in the FCPH and BRCT domains, respectively. Rice (Oryza sativa) genes that encode homologs of CPL3 and CPL4 were identified also (Supplemental Fig. S1). OsCPL3 is 664 amino acids in length and lacks the long N terminus of AtCPL3. However, the overlapping sequences are 52.8% identical. Two rice genes encode CPL4. OsCPL4a and OsCPL4b are 536 and 420 amino acid residues, respectively, and have 41.4% and 37.9% amino acid identity to AtCPL4 polypeptide, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S1). The RAP74 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIF interacts and activates FCP1 family phosphatases (CITATION, CITATION). A single Arabidopsis gene (At4g12610) encodes a human RAP74 homolog based on BLAST analysis. A cDNA clone encoding AtRAP74 was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and the nucleotide sequence was identical to the sequence annotation NM_117331 in GenBank. The ORF of AtRAP74 encodes a 543-amino acid peptide (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Fig. S2). Two rice homologs, OsRAP74a and OsRAP74b, were identified (Supplemental Fig. S2). The AtRAP74 N terminus is not highly homologous to the corresponding regions in metazoan and fungal RAP74 orthologs. However, the central region (amino acids 231–370) of AtRAP74 is rich in acidic residues (65%), which is a common feature in other RAP74 proteins (Fig. 1C). The C-terminal 108 amino acids of AtRAP74 (position 466–543) has 22% sequence identity to human and Drosophila RAP74 C-terminal regions that interact with cognate FCP1 homologs (CITATION). CPL3, CPL4, and AtRAP74 were constitutively expressed in both shoots and roots (Fig. 2 ). CPL3 only was induced moderately by NaCl treatment, which may be linked to its role in stress-responsive signaling. CPL3, CPL4, and AtRAP74 green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins were localized exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. 3 ). The GFP signal was detected within 16 h and nuclear localization did not change throughout the duration of the experiment (3 d). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Only a T-DNA insertion in the CPL4 5′-untranslated region (cpl4-1: Salk_132900) could be identified and plants lacked any visible phenotypic abnormalities (data not shown). Therefore, RNAi suppression was used to generate CPL4 reduced expression lines. Fifty-five hygromycin-resistant plants were recovered from two independent transformation experiments and these exhibited a range of phenotypic abnormalities. Germination and seedling establishment comparisons were used to categorize the lines into two classes. Eight independent lines (class I) were normal, whereas the rest (class II) exhibited incomplete to no cotyledon expansion (Fig. 4A, b, c, and i–k ). Class II plants grew very slowly and the initial true leaves remained small, had short petioles, and curled downward after the subsequent growth (Fig. 4A, d–g). A group of class II plants (17 lines) subsequently produced leaves that had longer petioles (Fig. 4A, d and e), and developed similarly to wild type. Twenty lines from class II plants matured without recovery from the growth defects and produced small inflorescences (Fig. 4, A and B, f–h). Ten class II lines produced only three to four true leaves in 30 d and did not reach maturity (Fig. 4A, i–k). Hygromycin-resistant vector control lines (25 lines) did not exhibit any of these anomalies (Fig. 4, A and B, a). Cosegregation of the growth phenotype and hygromycin resistance in viable class II RNAi (CPL4) lines was confirmed at the T2 generation (Table I ). All T2 plants with class II phenotype exhibited hygromycin resistance, whereas all plants with wild-type phenotypes were hygromycin sensitive. These results established that class II growth and developmental phenotypes are linked to the RNAi (CPL4) transgene and make it likely that severe growth defects of some class II plants are due to greater suppression of CPL4 expression in these lines. [[FIGURE]] Segregation analysis of RNAi (CPL4) plants in T2 generation Approximately 100 T2 seeds/line were germinated on 1/4× Murashige and Skoog medium and scored for wild-type/class II phenotype. The seedlings were then transferred to 1/4× Murashige and Skoog medium containing 20 μg/mL hygromycin and scored for the hygromycin-resistant (HygR)/sensitive (HygS) phenotype. CPL3 and CPL4 are distinct CPL isoforms by the presence of the BRCT domain in the C terminus, which is an essential module of metazoan and fungal FCP1 orthologs and is required for catalytic activity of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Fcp1. This contrasts with the human small CTD phosphatase 1 (SCP1) family and Arabidopsis CPL1 and CPL2 that require only the FCPH domain for CTD phosphatase activity. To assess the in planta function of the BRCT domain in CPL3, the capacity of cpl3-3 or cpl3-4 to suppress the ABA hyperinduction of RD29a-luciferase (LUC) expression caused by cpl3-1 (CITATION) was assessed. The cpl3-1 T-DNA insertion disrupts the CPL3 catalytic domain. The T-DNA insertion in cpl3-3 is at position 3,808 from the ATG initiation codon of genomic sequence At2g33540 and the insertion in cpl3-4 is at position 4,345. cpl3-3 and cpl3-4 alleles resulted in the production of chimeric transcripts that could produce proteins that are truncated in the FCPH and BRCT domains, respectively (Fig. 1B). ABA-inducible expression of RD29a-LUC in F1 plants was determined by CCD image analysis (CITATION). As shown in Figure 5 , both alleles failed to complement the ABA hyperresponsiveness caused by cpl3-1 (i.e. all alleles are equally dysfunctional). Apparently, the 33-amino acid distal region of the BRCT domain is essential for full biological functionality of CPL3. The CPL3 BRCT domain does not include an evident nuclear localization sequence (NLS) as in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) FCP1 (CITATION); consequently, this domain in the plant protein apparently does not function to facilitate nuclear localization. [[FIGURE]] Yeast and human FCP1 contain a central acidic-hydrophobic region and the BRCT domain distal to the FCPH domain, and this peptide region overlaps with the RAP74-binding region (CITATION). CPL3 and CPL4 catalytic FCPH domains are located in close proximity to the C terminus and the BRCT domain in each protein can be identified on the distal side (Fig. 1). To determine whether the BRCT-containing C-terminal region of CPL3 or CPL4 mediates interaction between CPL and AtRAP74, an immobilized AtRAP74 C-terminal region (77 amino acids) and radiolabeled CPL3 and CPL4 peptide fragments were used to assess in vitro binding. The C-terminal BRCT domain of either CPL3 (amino acids 1,110–1,241) or CPL4 (amino acids 297–440) specifically interacted with immobilized glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RAP74466-543 (Fig. 6 ). A strong interaction is indicated because a significant portion of the labeled CPL peptides remained associated with RAP74 after elution with 0.2 m NaCl. These results establish that the C-terminal BRCT-containing region of CPL3 and CPL4 can associate with the AtRAP74 C-terminal region, which may mediate interaction between CPL and Pol II. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants for protoplast preparation were grown on agar plates containing 1/3× Murashige and Skoog salts and 0.5% Suc. The salt treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings was conducted as described (CITATION). The pENSOTG GFP fusion vector has been prepared previously (CITATION). pUCNLSDsRed was provided by Dr. I. Hwang (CITATION). Primer sequences used in this research are listed in Table II . Sequences of primers used in this study The transcription start site for CPL4 was determined by 5′-RACE analysis using the 5′-RACE full core set (TaKaRa). Full-length ORF sequences of CPL3, CPL4, and AtRAP74 cDNAs were amplified by PCR (for CPL3) or RT-PCR with primer sets CPL3F and CPL3R, CPL4F and CPL4R, and RAP74F and RAP74R, respectively, then cloned in pET44a between BamHI-NotI sites. For protoplast transformation, the SmaI-NotI fragment of CPL3, CPL4, and RAP74 was excised from pET44a-CPL and pETRAP74 plasmids and inserted in pENSOTG, resulting in pENCPL3, pENCPL4, and pENRAP74. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (CITATION) using primer sets CPL3RTF and CPL3RTR, CPL4RTF and CPL4RTR, and RAP74CF2 and RAP74CR2. RD29a and ACT2 primers were used as positive controls (CITATION). For analysis of truncated CPL3 transcripts in cpl3-3 and cpl3-4, RT-PCR was performed using primer pairs CPL3_614 and CPL3_886 for the intact 5′ region and CPL3_2603 and LBb1 for chimeric transcripts. Isolation and transformation of Arabidopsis protoplasts with pENCPL3, pENCPL4, and pENRAP74 plasmids were conducted as described (CITATION). Transformed protoplasts were incubated at 22°C in the dark. Expression of the fusion constructs was evaluated at 2 and 3 d after transformation as described (CITATION). The RNAi construct was prepared by inserting the CPL4 cDNA fragment (position 315–849 bp) into pFGC1008 (http://www.chromdb.org). Resulting pFGCCPL4 was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 and was used for flower transformation of Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants were selected on media containing 1/4× Murashige and Skoog salts and 20 μg/mL hygromycin B and 100 μg/mL cefotaxim. Cosegregation of the transgene and growth phenotype was performed using T2 progeny of viable RNAi (CPL4) lines. Six independent class II lines that contain single-copy T-DNA were used for the analysis. Approximately 100 seeds were grown on media containing 1/4× Murashige and Skoog salts and 0.8% agar for 1 week. The growth phenotype was scored for each plant and then the entire population was transferred to the same media containing 20 μg/mL hygromycin B. Resistance to hygromycin B was scored 5 d after the transfer. cpl3-3 and cpl3-4 stigmas were pollinated with cpl3-1pollens that contain the RD29a-LUC reporter gene along with a mutated CPL3 allele. ABA-inducible expression of the LUC reporter gene was analyzed in F1 plants as described (CITATION). A cDNA fragment encoding an AtRAP74 C-terminal fragment, RAP74466-543, was amplified by RT-PCR with primers RAP74CF1 and RAP74CR1 and was inserted into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare). Expression of GST fusion proteins or control GST protein in Escherichia coli was induced by 0.4 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside at 37°C for 4 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl) and disrupted by sonication. Crude lysate containing approximately 40 μg GST fusion protein was loaded onto a microspin GST column (Amersham) and unbound protein was removed by washing the beads in Tris-buffered saline. The beads were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in ACB buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) at 4°C for 1 h and washed with ACB wash buffer (ACB buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl; CITATION). Radiolabeled CPL peptides were prepared using the coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). cDNA fragments corresponding to the BRCT domain of CPL3 and CPL4 were amplified by two rounds of PCR (first round: M-CPL3, T7-CPL3; M-CPL4, T7-CPL4; second round: M-TAG, T7-TERM). The resulting PCR products contain a T7 promoter sequence and initiation codon followed by an M-tag (MEMMTMSSMM) at the 5′ end, and a T7 terminator sequence at the 3′ end of CPL BRCT domains. The M-tag sequence was used to increase the labeling efficiency by [S35]-Met. PCR products were purified from agarose gel and used as templates for in vitro transcription/translation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ten microliters of in vitro translation products were diluted with 40 μL of ACB buffer and added to the glutathione-agarose beads loaded with GST-RAP74 or GST by itself at 4°C for 30 min. After washing with ACB wash buffer (CITATION), bound peptides were eluted by 100 μL 0.2 m NaCl and then 10 mm reduced glutathione, resolved by 12% tricine SDS-PAGE (CITATION), and were detected by phosphor imager (Molecular Dynamics).
