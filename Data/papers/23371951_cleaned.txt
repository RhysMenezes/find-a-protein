!~ABS~! Phytochrome A (phyA) is the primary photoreceptor mediating deetiolation under far-red (FR) light, whereas phyB predominantly regulates light responses in red light. SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA1) forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), which is responsible for the degradation of various photomorphogenesis-promoting factors, resulting in desensitization to light signaling. However, the role of phyB in FR light signaling and the regulatory pathway from light-activated phytochromes to the COP1-SPA1 complex are largely unknown. Here, we confirm that PHYB overexpression causes an etiolation response with reduced ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) accumulation under FR light. Notably, phyB exerts its nuclear activities and promotes seedling etiolation in both the presence and absence of phyA in response to FR light. PhyB acts upstream of SPA1 and is functionally dependent on it in FR light signaling. PhyB interacts and forms a protein complex with SPA1, enhancing its nuclear accumulation under FR light. During the dark-to-FR transition, phyB is rapidly imported into the nucleus and facilitates nuclear SPA1 accumulation. These findings support the notion that phyB plays a role in repressing FR light signaling. Activity modulation of the COP1-SPA E3 complex by light-activated phytochromes is an effective and pivotal regulatory step in light signaling.
!~RES~! Previous studies have reported that overexpression of PHYB promotes seedling etiolation under FR light (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). However, the mechanisms behind these effects of phyB in FR light are largely unknown. To investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of Arabidopsis phyB in FR light signaling, we generated transgenic plants that overexpress the full-length PHYB gene fused with green fluorescent protein (PHYB-GFP) under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. This construct was introduced into the phyB-9 mutant, a nonsense allele of PHYB (CITATION). When first grown under R light for 5 d, the two PHYB-GFP transgenic lines possessed hypocotyls of similar lengths to those of wild-type control plants in the dark and showed enhanced seedling photomorphogenesis with short hypocotyls and large cotyledons, similar to 35S-PHYB-GFP (PBG) in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype (CITATION), suggesting that the PHYB-GFP transgene was biologically functional (see Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B online). Next, the PHYB-GFP transgenic lines were grown in FR light for 5 d to evaluate hypocotyl elongation (Figures 1A and 1B). Seedling hypocotyl lengths in the PHYB-GFP lines and PBG were all ∼1.5 times the length of wild-type seedlings (Columbia-0 [Col-0] and Ler, respectively), whereas the hypocotyl length in the phyB-9 mutant was only 86% that of the wild type. In previous studies, overexpression of PHYB caused an approximately twofold increase in hypocotyl elongation compared with the respective wild-type backgrounds under FRc light, whereas the phyB-5 mutation significantly inhibited hypocotyl elongation (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To provide further molecular and biochemical evidence for the involvement of phyB in FR light signaling, we measured CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS; required for anthocyanin accumulation) transcript abundance and anthocyanin accumulation in PHYB transgenic lines. In response to FR light, the CHS transcript level in phyB-9 mutant seedlings was 1.6-fold higher than in the Col-0 wild-type seedlings, whereas the CHS transcript levels in the PHYB-GFP or PBG seedlings were ∼60% of wild-type levels (Figure 1C). Consequently, seedlings of the phyB-9 mutant accumulated 2.6-fold more anthocyanin than did Col-0 wild-type seedlings, whereas the PHYB-GFP or PBG seedlings accumulated ∼80% as much anthocyanin as their respective wild types (Figure 1D). ABO (35S-PHYB in the Nossen [No-0] ecotype; CITATION) seedlings accumulate only 60% as much anthocyanin as the wild type under FRc light (CITATION). Collectively, these findings suggest that phyB is involved in repressing Arabidopsis photomorphogenesis under FR light, including promoting hypocotyl elongation, affecting CHS expression and repressing anthocyanin accumulation. The presence of sugar has been found to interfere with the inhibitory effect of phyB under FRc light (CITATION). Based upon that, we investigated the effects of no sugar, Suc concentration, FR light intensity, and growth period on phyB hypocotyl elongation in response to FR light. Our results suggest that phyB repression of deetiolation under FRc light occurs even in the absence of additional sugar, although the presence of sugar measurably enhances the inhibitory effect (see Supplemental Figures 2A to 2E online; see also CITATION; CITATION). We chose moderate growth conditions to perform most further experiments, including growth medium with 1% Suc, seedlings grown in FRc light for 4 to 5 d and FR light fluence rates of 2.5 and 18.1 µmol·m–2·s–1. Based on fluorescence observations of phyB-GFP and phyA-GFP, the nuclear import of phyB-GFP is regulated by R light, whereas that of phyA-GFP is controlled not only by FR light but also by R light with much faster kinetics (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). The high percentage of the active Pfr form of phyB in response to high steady state R light leads to large phyB-GFP nuclear bodies (NBs) (see Supplemental Figure 3A online; see also CITATION). To determine whether FR light can activate phyB, we first checked phyB-GFP fluorescence in response to FR light treatment. In dark-grown seedlings, phyB-GFP fluorescence was very weak; 1 h of FR light exposure produced diffuse nuclear fluorescence without any NBs (Figure 2A). Following 2 h of FR exposure, or in seedlings grown under FRc light for 4 d, phyB-GFP was seen in very small, dim NBs. To confirm whether phyA was required for the nuclear activities of phyB, we also checked phyB-GFP fluorescence in a phyA-211 mutant (a nonsense allele of PHYA; CITATION) background in response to both R and FR light treatment. Under Rc light, the phyB-GFP fluorescence exhibited large and bright NBs in both the Col-0 wild type and the phyA-211 mutant background (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). PhyB-GFP in the phyA-211 mutant background displayed almost identical fluorescence patterns to those in the wild-type background, whether in the dark or under FR light exposure. Note that the frequency of cells with small NBs in the phyA-211 mutant background was ∼25% higher than in the wild-type background when seedlings were grown under FR for 4 d (Figure 2B). [[FIGURE]] Although phyB-GFP fluorescence in dark-grown seedlings was too weak to be observed clearly, immunoblot analysis revealed a phyB-GFP signal in the nuclear fractions (see Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C online). The seedlings of PHYB-GFP or phyA-211 PHYB-GFP grown in Rc light accumulated much more nuclear phyB-GFP protein than those grown in the dark (see Supplemental Figure 3B online). To provide further evidence regarding whether the nuclear activities of phyB in response to FR light treatment required phyA, we compared nuclear accumulation of phyB-GFP in the phyA-211 mutant background with that in the wild-type background. Upon 1 h of FR light treatment, the nuclear import of phyB-GFP protein increased almost twofold compared with that in dark-grown seedlings. Unexpectedly, nuclear import of phyB-GFP protein in the phyA-211 mutant background was ∼150% higher than in the wild-type background in the dark or after FR light treatment. Over the same period, cytoplasmic levels of phyB-GFP in phyA-211 PHYB-GFP seedlings were lower than those in PHYB-GFP seedlings (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 3D online). Nuclear import of endogenous phyB in the phyA-211 mutant was notably higher than that in Col-0 in the dark or after FR light treatment (see Supplemental Figure 3F online). Thus, FR exposure promoted nuclear import of phyB even in the absence of phyA. PhyA is thought to be the only active photoreceptor that promotes seedling photomorphogenesis under FR light (CITATION; CITATION). The first step to investigate the roles of phyB in FR light signaling is to understand the relationship between phyB and phyA. In the phyB-9 mutant or PHYB-GFP transgenic line, the hypocotyls were 18% shorter or 25% longer, respectively, than the wild-type hypocotyls when grown under FR light (Figure 3A). Then, we compared the hypocotyl lengths of the phyA-211 phyB-9 and phyA-211 PHYB-GFP double mutants with that of the phyA-211 single mutant. Although phyA-211 exhibited a dominant effect on hypocotyl elongation, the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant seedlings had 11% less hypocotyl elongation compared with the phyA-211 single mutant grown under FR light for 5 d. By contrast, phyA-211 PHYB-GFP double mutant seedlings had 10% greater hypocotyl elongation compared with the phyA-211 single mutant. All differences in hypocotyl lengths between phyA-211 and phyA-211 phyB-9 or phyA-211 PHYB-GFP were significant as assessed by Student’s t test. [[FIGURE]] In previous studies, the phyA phyB double mutant conferred 18 to 27% less unhooking than the phyA mutant under FRc light (CITATION; CITATION). Next, we compared apical unhooking and cotyledon unfolding between the Col-0 wild type possessing phyB-9 or phyA-211 with the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant. Minor differences were observed in the apical unhooking angles of seedlings grown in continuous dark for 4 d; seedlings of the phyB-9 single mutant or phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant had larger apical unhooking angles compared with those of the Col-0 wild type or phyA-211 single mutants (Figure 3B). After growth in continuous dark for 4 d followed by high-intensity FR light (90.5 µmol·m–2·s–1) for 12 h, the Col-0 wild-type seedlings had a straight apical hook with unopened cotyledons, whereas the phyB-9 single mutant seedlings exhibited a cotyledon opening angle of 49.3 ± 6.9°. Although the cotyledons of the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant seedlings were unopened after 24 h of high-intensity FR treatment, their apical unhooking angles were 33% larger than those of phyA-211 single mutant seedlings. After growth in intense FRc light (90.5 µmol·m–2·s–1) for 5 d, the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant seedlings had open cotyledons (25.6 ± 4.1°), whereas those of the phyA-211 single mutant seedlings remained unopened. A previous study showed that the FR block of greening is phyA dependent (CITATION). When grown under FR light for 3 d and under W light for an additional 2 d, either PHYB-GFP or phyA-211 PHYB-GFP seedlings had ∼30% higher chlorophyll concentrations compared with those of Col-0 wild type or phyA-211 mutants (Figure 3C). This suggests that phyB inhibited the FR-induced block of greening in subsequent W light in both wild-type and phyA-211 backgrounds. From these observations, we conclude that phyB enhanced Arabidopsis etiolation under FRc light in both the presence and absence of phyA. The negative effect of SPA1 was previously shown to occur early in the phyA-specific signaling pathway (CITATION), which forms the E3 complex with COP1 to mediate the degradation of various photomorphogenesis-promoting factors (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). Another study showed that the spa1-2 phyB-1 double mutant and the spa1-2 single mutant (Rsch-0/RLD [RLD] ecotype) exhibit similar hypocotyl elongation under FRc light (CITATION). To confirm the epistatic relationship between SPA1 and phyB in FR light signaling, we introduced phyB-9 and the PHYB-GFP transgenic line into the spa1-100 mutant via genetic crosses, constructing phyB-9 spa1-100 and PHYB-GFP spa1-100 double mutants (Figure 4). Under different FR intensities, spa1-100 completely suppressed the deetiolation and etiolation phenotypes caused by phyB-9 and PHYB-GFP, suggesting not only that phyB acts upstream of SPA1 but also that its functions are dependent on SPA1 under FR light. [[FIGURE]] Overexpression of Arabidopsis SPA1 (Myc-SPA1, driven by the constitutive 35S promoter in the Col-0 background) results in a hyperetiolation phenotype under R, FR, and B light conditions (CITATION). To evaluate the effects of phyA and phyB on SPA1 function, we introduced the Myc-SPA1 transgene into the phyA-211 and phyB-9 single mutants and phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant to generate double or triple homozygous plants. Overexpression of Myc-SPA1 leads to a cotyledon size much smaller than that of the Col-0 wild-type (CITATION). In this study, the cotyledon size of the phyB-9 mutant was ∼1.89-fold that of Col-0 under FR illumination. In addition, the phyB-9 mutant rescued the small cotyledon size caused by Myc-SPA1 overexpression (Figure 5A). The phyA-211 Myc-SPA1 double mutant showed greater hypocotyl elongation than Myc-SPA1 (the parental line) under FR light; its hypocotyl length was 1.32-fold that of the parental line (Figure 5B). The hypocotyls of phyB-9 Myc-SPA1 double mutant seedlings were ∼30% shorter than those of the parental Myc-SPA1 line under high-FR light. Hypocotyl elongation of the phyA-211 phyB-9 Myc-SPA1 triple mutant resembled that of the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant, with visibly shorter hypocotyls compared with the phyA-211 single mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that both phyA and phyB are necessary for the proper functioning of SPA1 under FR light. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the role of light regulation in SPA1 activities, we determined Myc-SPA1 protein accumulation in the dark and under FR, R, B, and W light conditions. Figure 5C demonstrates that SPA1 protein levels, but not transcript abundance, were tightly controlled in the dark and under FR, R, B, and W light and that all light conditions led to greater Myc-SPA1 accumulation. Elevated SPA1 abundance has been reported under FRc and Rc light conditions (CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether phyA and phyB are involved in light-regulated SPA1 accumulation, Myc-SPA1 protein levels were compared in wild-type, phyA-211, phyB-9, and phyA-211 phyB-9 backgrounds under FR light. Myc-SPA1 transcript levels were comparable in the Col-0 wild type and phyA-211, phyB-9, and phyA-211 phyB-9 mutants under FR light (Figure 5D). Under FR light, Myc-SPA1 protein accumulation in the phyA-211 Myc-SPA1 or phyB-9 Myc-SPA1 double mutant seedlings was 170 or 36%, respectively, of that in seedlings of the parental line (Figure 5E; see Supplemental Figure 4 online). The Myc-SPA1 protein level in the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant background was intermediate to those in the phyA-211 and phyB-9 mutant backgrounds. Notably, Myc-SPA1 protein levels in the wild-type, phyA-211, phyB-9, and phyA-211 phyB-9 backgrounds were entirely consistent with their hypocotyl elongation under FR light. These data imply that both phyA and phyB play a pivotal role in the regulation of SPA1 abundance and that phyB enhances SPA1 accumulation in both the presence and absence of phyA. Since phyB was required for SPA1 activity under FR light, we determined whether a direct interaction between phyB and SPA1 was involved in their functional regulation. We first used yeast two-hybrid assays to determine their interaction and the domains responsible. PhyB-FL (amino acids 1 to 1172) alone activated reporter gene expression in our yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown), so phyB-CT548 (amino acids 626 to 1172) was used to test the interaction between phyB and SPA1. The full-length SPA1 protein as well as deletion derivatives, including SPA1-NT696, SPA1-CC, and SPA1-CT509, were capable of interacting with phyB-CT548. However, SPA1-NT545, SPA1-WD40, and SPA1-ΔCC were unable to interact with phyB-CT548 (Figure 6A). PhyB-NT651 (amino acids 1 to 651) and phyB-NT450 (amino acids 1 to 450) failed to interact with SPA1-FL or its deletion derivatives (data not shown). These observations suggest that the C-terminal domain of SPA1, including both coiled-coil and WD40 domains, is required for the phyB–SPA1 interaction. [[FIGURE]] Next, we employed an immunofluorescence assay using a PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 double-transgenic line to determine whether phyB and SPA1 colocalized in the nuclei of Arabidopsis cells. After growth in the dark or under R or FR light for 5 d, the PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 seedlings were harvested and fixed, and the GFP fluorescence of phyB-GFP or Myc immunofluorescence of Myc-SPA1 was observed. In the dark, the phyB-GFP and Myc-SPA1 proteins colocalized in the nucleus with diffuse fluorescence (Figure 6B, yellow nuclear fluorescence). Under R light, they colocalized in large and bright NBs (yellow dots). By contrast, phyB-GFP and Myc-SPA1 colocalized in both NBs and exhibited diffuse fluorescence under FR conditions (small yellow dots and yellow nuclear fluorescence). Although the phyB-GFP and Myc-SPA1 proteins colocalized in the nucleus under all light conditions, their different fluorescence patterns, diffuse fluorescence, small NBs, and large NBs imply that they exist as various active forms in the dark and under FR and R light conditions. To determine whether phyB and SPA1 colocalize in the same protein complex, we conducted in vivo coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (CITATION). Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains EHA105 carrying pCAMBIA1302-PHYB-CT548-GFP, 35S:p19 (CITATION), and pJIM19-Myc-SPA1 (CITATION) constructs were used to infect Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plants were grown under FR light for 3 d, after which native protein was extracted from the leaves and subjected to co-IP using antibodies against the Myc epitope. Myc-tagged full-length SPA1, SPA1-CT509, or SPA1-CC proteins copurified with GFP-tagged phyB-CT548 (Figures 6C to 6E). Neither SPA1-NT545 nor SPA1-WD40 copurified with phyB-CT548 (data not shown). To further investigate whether the colocalization of phyB and SPA1 in the same protein complex is light dependent, we compared the interaction between SPA1 and phyB by means of in vivo co-IP assays using PHYB-GFP transgenic line and PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 double transgenic line seedlings grown under FR or R light. The results suggested that phyB-GFP interacted with Myc-SPA1 under both FR and R light (Figure 6F). Taken together, these findings indicate not only that phyB and SPA1 colocalize in the same protein complex under FR light, but also that under FR light, the interaction between phyB and SPA1 is important for their activities. FR exposure effectively promoted nuclear accumulation of phyB (Figure 2), and phyB also enhanced SPA1 accumulation under FR light (Figure 5E; see Supplemental Figure 4 online). To test whether phyB directly promotes SPA1 nuclear transport in response to FR light, we compared the effect of different phyB levels, phyB-9, the wild type, and PHYB-GFP on nuclear transport of Myc-SPA1 during the transition from dark to FR light. In phyB-9 Myc-SPA1 double mutant seedlings, nuclear transport of Myc-SPA1 increased by 29 to 40% over that of dark-grown seedlings (Figure 7A; see Supplemental Figure 5A online). Relative nuclear Myc-SPA1 protein levels in Col-0 Myc-SPA1 seedlings were 124, 146, 202, 211, and 175% that of dark-grown phyB-9 Myc-SPA1 seedlings during the dark to FR light transition for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. Over the same time course, relative nuclear Myc-SPA1 protein levels in PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 seedlings were 170, 196, 215, 319, and 296% compared with those of dark-grown phyB-9 Myc-SPA1. Therefore, phyB facilitated the nuclear transport of SPA1 during the transition from dark to FR light. SPA1, which contains two putative nuclear localization sequences, strongly localizes to the nucleus in both dark- and light-treated cells (CITATION). Our data demonstrated that SPA1 was involved in feedback regulation of nuclear phyB accumulation under FR light and that phyB and SPA1 displayed nuclear cotransport during the transition from dark to FR light (Figure 7B; see Supplemental Text1 and Supplemental Figure 5B online). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether synchronous nuclear accumulation of both phyB and SPA1 is due to their direct interaction, we tested their binding during the dark to FR transition using an in vivo co-IP assay. At a comparable level of Myc-SPA1, the phyB-GFP levels evidently increased during the dark-to-FR transition compared with the dark control (Figure 7C). Note that nuclear accumulation of Myc-SPA1 was related to the amount bound to phyB-GFP during the dark-to-FR transition. Thus, we conclude that phyB promoted nuclear accumulation of SPA1 through their direct interaction in response to FR light. Arabidopsis COP1 acts as a repressor of seedling photomorphogenic development within the nucleus, and light inactivation of COP1 is accomplished by a reduction in its nuclear abundance (CITATION; CITATION). COP1 and SPA1 are functionally interdependent, and SPA1 enhances COP1 activation in the dark and under FR light (CITATION; CITATION). The enhanced etiolation phenotype conferred by a 35S promoter–driven GUS-COP1 transgene is largely suppressed by the spa1-3 mutation under FR light, but not in darkness (see Supplemental Figure 6A online; see also CITATION). To determine whether SPA1 is involved in the light-regulated nuclear accumulation of COP1, we compared the nuclear abundance of GUS-COP1 in the parental line (No-0 wild-type background; CITATION) and GUS-COP1 in the spa1-3 mutant background both in the dark and under FRc light. Histochemical staining revealed that GUS-COP1 was similarly enriched in the nuclei of hypocotyl cells in dark-grown seedlings of the parental line and in the spa1-3 mutant background (Figure 8A). However, after an overnight incubation in GUS staining solution, nuclear GUS-COP1 was clearly visible in the FR light–grown seedlings of the parental line but was barely detectable in seedlings with the spa1-3 mutant background (Figure 8A; see Supplemental Figure 6B online). Under FR light, the cell frequency with nuclear-enriched GUS staining in the No-0 wild-type seedlings was 6.4-fold higher than in the spa1-3 mutant seedlings, whereas no clear differences in the rate of nuclear-enriched GUS staining were observed between the seedlings of No-0 GUS-COP1 and spa1-3 GUS-COP1 in the dark (Figure 8B). Immunoblot analysis showed that the nuclear GUS-COP1 protein level in the No-0 wild-type background was ∼1.4- or 2.8-fold higher than in the spa1-3 mutant background in the dark or under FR light (Figure 8C; see Supplemental Figure 6C online). These results matched the hypocotyl elongation and GUS nuclear-enriched staining results of No-0 GUS-COP1 and spa1-3 GUS-COP1 under FR light. The apparent reduction in the nuclear abundance of GUS-COP1 was not due to reduced GUS-COP1 protein levels in the spa1-3 mutant background, as spa1-3 mutant seedlings showed stronger overall histochemical staining for GUS-COP1 and accumulated much more cytoplasmic GUS-COP1 protein than the parental plants (Figure 8D; see Supplemental Figures 6B and 6D online). Notably, GUS-COP1 transcript levels were comparable in the No-0 wild-type and spa1-3 mutant backgrounds both in darkness and under FR light (see Supplemental Figure 6E online). These observations suggest that nuclear accumulation of GUS-COP1 was impaired in the spa1-3 mutant background under FR light with a concomitant increase in its cytoplasmic accumulation. [[FIGURE]] After demonstrating the functional deficiency of SPA1 in the phyB-9 mutant in response to FR light (Figures 5B, 5E, and 7A), we tested whether PHYB overexpression enhanced the nuclear abundance of both SPA1 and COP1. Under FR light, seedlings of the PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 and PHYB-GFP GUS-COP1 double-transgenic lines accumulated ∼1.8- and 2.8-fold more nuclear phyB-GFP protein, respectively, compared with seedlings of their parental line (PHYB-GFP) (Figure 9A; see Supplemental Figure 7A online). The nuclear level of Myc-SPA1 in seedlings of the PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 double-transgenic line was more than two times higher than that in its parental line (Myc-SPA1) (Figure 9B; see Supplemental Figure 7B online). Additionally, the nuclear protein level of GUS-COP1 in seedlings of the PHYB-GFP GUS-COP1 double transgenic line was ∼59% higher than its parental line (GUS-COP1) (Figure 9C; see Supplemental Figure 7C online). [[FIGURE]] Although the hypocotyl lengths of Myc-SPA1 and No-0 GUS-COP1 transgenic plants were 5.2- and 1.9-times greater, respectively, than those of their wild types under FR light, the hypocotyl lengths of the PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 and PHYB-GFP GUS-COP1 double mutants remained 32 and 38% higher, respectively, than those of their parental lines (Myc-SPA1 and No-0 GUS-COP1) (Figure 9D). Additionally, phyB enhanced nuclear protein accumulation and hypocotyl elongation caused by Myc-SPA1 overexpression, even in the absence of additional sugar under FR light (see Supplemental Figures 8A and 8B online). Therefore, phyB promotes seedling etiolation through enhancement of nuclear abundance of the COP1-SPA1 E3 ligase complex under FR light. Previous studies have shown that SPA1 forms an E3 complex with COP1 to mediate degradation of nuclear HY5, a basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factor that acts downstream of light signaling to promote photomorphogenesis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Thus, HY5 abundance is correlated with not only the extent of photomorphogenic development but also the E3 activity of the COP1-SPA1 complex (CITATION; CITATION). In the dark, all Col-0, phyB-9, and PHYB-GFP seedlings accumulated only almost undetectable amounts of nuclear HY5 protein (Figure 9E; see Supplemental Figure 7E online). Under Rc light, phyB promotes seedling deetiolation; HY5 abundance in the nuclei of phyB-9 mutant and PHYB-GFP transgenic line seedlings was 71 and 224%, respectively, that of wild-type seedlings. Conversely, nuclear HY5 levels in phyB-9 mutant and PHYB-GFP transgenic line seedlings were 147 and 78%, respectively, compared with those of wild-type seedlings under FRc light. Therefore, we conclude that phyB enhances seedling etiolation under FR light via promoting E3 activity of the COP1-SPA1 complex in the nucleus.
!~MM~! The phyA-211 (CITATION), phyB-9 (CITATION; CITATION), and spa1-100 (CITATION) mutants and Myc-SPA1 (line B1-17) transgenic lines (CITATION) are of the Col-0 ecotype. PBG (CITATION), GUS-COP1 (CITATION), and spa1-3 (CITATION) are in the Ler ecotype, the No-0 ecotype, and the RLD ecotype background, respectively. Seeds were surface sterilized and spread on Murashige and Skoog agar plates (1× Murashige and Skoog salts, 1% Suc, and 0.9% agar; Sigma-Aldrich). Growth conditions for seedlings were as described previously (Yang et al., 2005a). FR and R light was supplied using light-emitting diode light sources (model E-30LEDL3; Percival Scientific), with irradiance fluence rates of ∼2.5 and 30.0 µmol·m–2·s–1, respectively, unless otherwise indicated (model ILT1400A with sensor model SEL-033/F/W; International Light Technologies). W light was supplied using cool-white fluorescent lamps. To erase postmaturation germination problems, seeds stored for 3 to 4 months at room temperature were used for seedling hypocotyl measurements. A full-length PHYB cDNA fragment was generated by RT-PCR using the primer pair PHYB-1NF (5′-accatgggcATGGTTTCCGGAGTCGGGGGT-3′) with a NcoI site (underlined) and PHYB-3516NR (5′-agctagcATATGGCATCATCAGCATCATG-3′) with an NheI site (underlined); the PCR products were cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa) to generate the pMD19-PHYB clone. Then, the NcoI restriction site in PHYB was erased in the correct clone without changing the coded amino acid using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with the primer pair PHYB-mF (5′-GAGCCGGAGTCAGCaATGGGAAACTGCGGA-3′) and PHYB-mR (5′-TCCGCAGTTTCCCATtGCTGACTCCGGCTC-3′). An NcoI-NheI fragment containing the full-length PHYB coding region from pMD19-PHYB was cloned into the NcoI-SpeI sites of the binary vector pCAMBIA1302 to generate pCAMBIA1302-PHYB. The pCAMBIA1302-PHYB binary construct was electroporated into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and then introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana via a floral dip method (CITATION). Transgenic plants were selected on germination plates containing 25 μg/mL hygromycin for PHYB-GFP. We selected ∼40 T1 transgenic lines and allowed them to self-produce T2 seeds. Phenotypic analyses were conducted using T2 plants with single T-DNA insertion and then confirmed in the T3 generation. For most experiments, homozygous T3 or T4 transgenic plants were used. The double mutants phyA-211 phyB-9, phyA-211 PHYB-GFP, phyB-9 spa1-100, PHYB-GFP spa1-100, phyA-211 Myc-SPA1, phyB-9 Myc-SPA1, phyA-211 phyB-9 Myc-SPA1, PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1, and PHYB-GFP GUS-COP1 were derived from genetic crosses of the two respective single parental mutants (or transgenic lines). Putative double or triple mutants were selected in the F2 generation and confirmed in the F3 generation based on the mutant phenotype, or antibiotic selection markers, immunoblot, and RT-PCR analysis. A previous double mutant was included in this study: spa1-3 GUS-COP1 (CITATION). The anthocyanin measurement method was modified from CITATION and CITATION. Briefly, 100 seedlings from each light treatment/genotype were incubated in 300 μL methanol acidified using 1% HCl overnight, with gentle shaking in the dark. Then, 250 μL distilled water and 500 μL chloroform were added, vortexed, and spun quickly to separate anthocyanin from chlorophyll. To 350 μL of supernatant, 650 μL HCl was added. Total anthocyanin was determined by measuring the A530 and A657 of the aqueous phase spectrophotometrically. The relative amount of anthocyanin was calculated as (A530 − 0.25 A657) per seedling. Chlorophyll measurement of seedlings was conducted according to CITATION. For RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown under different light conditions, as indicated in the text. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kits (Qiagen) and converted into cDNA by M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses for light-responsive gene expression (CHS) were performed in a total volume of 20 μL according to the manual for SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). Three replicates were performed per sample. Quantitative PCR was performed using the Chromo4 Quantitative PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative expression was determined after normalization against the reference gene ACTIN 2 using Opticon Monitor version 3.1 (Bio-Rad). Each column represents the mean relative expression of three biological repeats; error bars indicate the se. Primer pairs used for RT-PCR were the following: for PHYB, PHYB-3216F (5′-AAACGCGATTGTAAGTCAAGCG-3′) and PHYB-3682R (5′-CACTAGCAGTTGACAATGGTCG-3′); for CHS, CHS-F (5′-CTACTTCCG CATCACCAAC-3′) and CHS-R (5′-AGAGCAGACAACGAGGACAC-3′); for Myc-SPA1, Myc-F (5′-CGAATTCTGCAGATATCCATC-3′) and SPA1-5TR (5′-GAAGCTCAGCTCACAGGAATGTTG-3′); for Actin 2, ACT2-F (5′-GACCAGCTCTTCCATCGAGAA-3′) and ACT2-R (5′-CAAACGAGGGCTGGAACAAG-3′). Measurement of nuclear fractions was conducted using the modified method of CITATION and CITATION. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown under different light conditions for 4 d. Then, 1.5 g of fresh seedlings was homogenized quickly in 3 mL Honda buffer (2.5% Ficoll 400, 5% dextran T40, 0.4 M Suc, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× complete protease inhibitor cocktail; Honda et al., 1966) using an ice-cold mortar and pestle, then filtered through a 62-μm-pore nylon mesh. After adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%, the homogenate was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 1500g for 5 min. The supernatant fraction centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min and was saved as the nuclei-depleted soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended gently in 1 mL Honda buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 1500g for 5 min and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL Honda buffer, after which the preparation was centrifuged at 100g for 1 min and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μL of buffer G (1.7 M Suc, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15% Triton-X 100, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail) and transferred to the top of 300 μL buffer G in a new tube. The preparation was centrifuged at 16,000g for 1 h. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 μL Honda buffer and 100 μL 2× SDS loading buffer. Anti-Histone H3 (1:10,000, ab1791; Abcam) and anti-HSP90 (1:8000, at-115; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used to detect nuclear and cytosolic markers, respectively. For immunoblots of Arabidopsis plant extracts, the total protein fraction was extracted with the lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Specific anti-HY5 peptide antibodies were raised in rabbits and affinity purified against the peptides ETSGRESGSATGQE (amino acids 54 to 67) and GESQRKRGRTPAEK (amino acids 74 to 87). The specific anti-phyB peptide antibody was raised in rabbits and affinity purified against the peptide EQAQSSGTKSLRPR (phyB, amino acids 27 to 40) (HangZhou HuaAn Biotechnology). Myc-SPA1 and phyB-GFP proteins were detected with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody (clone 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-GFP polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (P30010; Shanghai Abmart Biotech), respectively. Proteins were visualized by incubating specimens with goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium as substrates. Quantification of immunoblots was conducted according to CITATION. Briefly, band intensities of Myc-SPA1, HSP90 (loading control for total lysates), or histone (loading control for nuclear fraction) were measured with ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Relative band intensities were then calculated using the ratio of Myc-SPA1/HSP90 or Myc-SPA1/histone for each immunoblot panel. All immunoblot experiments were repeated at least three times, essentially with the same conclusions, and representative results are shown. Histochemical GUS staining was used to examine GUS-COP1 localization, as described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The cells examined were from the hypocotyl region, approximately one-third of the distance from the hypocotyl/root junction to the base of the cotyledons. The seedlings were incubated in the GUS staining solution overnight. The stained seedlings were fixed for 30 min in 10% acetic acid, 3.7% formaldehyde, and 50% ethanol. Then, the seedlings were decolored through a graded ethanol series and mounted in 1 μg mL−1 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution before observation. GUS-COP1 localization was examined under a BX41 fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Representative images were photographed with a digital DP20 camera system (Olympus). All images were taken from the same hypocotyl region with identical exposures. To visualize the phyB-GFP fusion proteins, the PHYB-GFP transgenic line was mounted on slides and examined with a BX41 fluorescence microscope (Olympus). For each condition, at least 20 seedlings were observed; a representative image is presented. Representative images were prepared as GUS-COP1 localization mentioned above. To visualize immunofluorescence of Myc-SPA1 and PHYB-GFP, Myc-SPA1 seedlings were grown under R light (30.0 µmol·m–2·s–1) or FR light (2.5 µmol·m–2·s–1) for 5 d and harvested and fixed in fixation buffer (4% formaldehyde, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl) (CITATION) under R or FR light for 15 min. Then, nuclei were isolated using ice-cold Honda buffer (CITATION) (see also above), washed three times with PBS, and incubated with c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in PBS (1:250) at 4°C for 4 h. After five washings in PBS, nuclei were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) conjugated anti-mouse IgG (T5393, 1:200; Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 4 h, followed by a further five washings in PBS. The nuclei were then diluted in PBS with DAPI (1 µg/mL). Representative Myc-SPA1 immunofluorescence images were obtained as GUS-COP1 localization mentioned above. The assay system and all procedures were described by CITATION. The various LexA and GAD constructs of SPA1 and its domain deletions used in this study were as described previously (CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). The primer pair used to produce PHYB-CT548 was PHYB-CT548F (5′-ccaattgatgAACTCTAAAGTTGTG-3′) with a MfeI site (underlined) and PHYB-CT548R (5′-agtcgacCTAATATGGCATCATCAGCATCATG-3′), which contained a SalI site (underlined). For the in vivo co-IP assay, PHYB-CT548 cDNA was amplified with the primer pair AtB-1873NF (5′-CCATGGGCATGAACTCTAAAGTTGTGGATG-3′) and AtB-3516NR (5′-GCTAGCATATGGCATCATCAGCATCATG-3′) and cloned into the pCAMBIA1302 binary vector to generate pCAMBIA1302-CT548-GFP. Agrobacterium strain EHA105 carrying pCAMBIA1302-PHYB-CT548-GFP, pJIM19-Myc-SPA1 (CITATION), or 35S-p19 (CITATION) constructs were plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotics at 28°C. A single clone was grown in 5 mL of LB liquid selection medium for 24 h. Then, 500 μL of culture was transferred to new LB liquid selection medium with 10 mM MES, pH 5.6, and 40 μM acetosyringone and grown at 28°C in a shaker. When the bacterial growth reached an OD600 of ∼3.0, the culture was centrifuged at 2150g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM MES, 150 μM acetosyringone, and 10 mM MgCl2), and the bacteria were then incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The same volume of suspension carrying different constructs was coinfiltrated into a Nicotiana benthamiana leaf. After growth under FR light (2.5 µmol·m–2·s–1) for 3 d, the leaf was harvested and native extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-MES, pH 8.0, 0.5 M Suc, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail) was used to lyse the sample. Then, 250 μL of extract was incubated with 20 μL anti-Myc–conjugated agarose (M20012; Shanghai Abmart Biotech) under FR light (2.5 µmol·m–2·s–1) for 8 h at 4°C. The agarose was washed twice with 200 μL native extraction buffer. The pellet was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc and anti-GFP, as described above. PHYB-GFP or PHYB-GFP Myc-SPA1 double transgenic line seedlings were grown under FR (2.5 µmol·m–2·s–1) or R (30.0 µmol·m–2·s–1) light for 4 d. In vivo co-IP assays of phyB-GFP and Myc-SPA1 were performed as described above, except using the lysis buffer (see also above) instead of the native extraction buffer.
