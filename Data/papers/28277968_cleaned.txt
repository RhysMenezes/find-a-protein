!~ABS~! ABSTRACT VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER (VOZ)1/and VOZ2 have an ability to bind to the specific cis-element in the AVP1 promoter of Arabidopsis, which function on the PhyB-dependent flowering and possibly in various stress responses as potential transcription factors, although nuclear localization of VOZ proteins is still unclear. In this study, we found that VOZ2 is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions, whereas VOZ2 is transferred not only to the nucleus but also to the cytoplasmic foci under heat stress conditions. The VOZ2 foci predominantly co-localized with a marker of stress granules (SGs), which were cytoplasmic granular structures for mRNA storage and decay under abiotic stress conditions. We also demonstrated that GFP-VOZ2 with a nuclear localization signal was rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway under the heat stress conditions. Also, stress-related expression of DREB2A in the voz1voz2 mutant was significantly upregulated by heat stress as compared with that in the wild-type Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that VOZ2 is localized to SGs and nucleus under heat stress conditions, and functions as a transcriptional repressor of DREB2A in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! We previously reported that the voz1voz2 double mutant shows higher sensitivity to high-temperature conditions, suggesting that VOZ1 and VOZ2 are involved in heat stress responses. Since we previously reported that around 42°C is a critical temperature of thermotolerance of Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia-0), (CITATION) Nakai Y, Nakahira Y, Sumida H, Takebayashi K, Nagasawa Y, Yamasaki K, Akiyama M, Ohme-Takagi M, Fujiwara S, Shiina T, et al. Vascular plant one-zinc-finger protein 1/2 transcription factors regulate abiotic and biotic stress responses in Arabidopsis.

To explore the function of VOZs under heat stress conditions, we first examined the subcellular localization of VOZ2 by immunostaining with an anti-VOZ2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, VOZ2 was found to be dispersed throughout the cytosol under normal growth conditions, but VOZ2 localization was dramatically changed to both the nucleus and cytoplasmic granular structures after the seedlings were incubated at 42 °C for 2 h.  [[FIGURE]] Next, we observed the dynamics of the changes in the localization of VOZ2 under heat stress by means of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a translational fusion of VOZ2 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter or its promoter, and we found that the distribution of GFP-VOZ2 was changed to the cytosolic foci after 20 min of 42°C heat stress treatment. Then, the fluorescence of GFP-VOZ2 foci gradually decreased after 2- h of heat stress treatment at 42°C (Fig. 1B, C). The formation of GFP-VOZ2 foci was apparently delayed for 40 min at 40 °C or 120 min at 39°C (Fig. S1). We analyzed the degradation kinetics of VOZ2 by western blotting with the anti-VOZ2 antibody. Two-week-old WT seedlings were incubated at 42°C and then were collected at 4-time points (0, 1, 2, and 3 h), and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting with the anti-VOZ2 antibody. In line with the changes of GFP-VOZ2 fluorescence under the high-temperature conditions, VOZ2 was not degraded until 1 h of high-temperature incubation, but this protein was gradually degraded after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 2A).  [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated where the VOZ2 protein is mainly degraded in the cell under the high-temperature conditions using the plants expressing a fusion protein 35S::GFP-VOZ2 with either a nuclear export signal (NES) or a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Cytosol-resident VOZ2 (GFP-VOZ2-NES) was slightly degraded after 3 h of incubation at 42°C, whereas nucleus-localized VOZ2 (GFP-VOZ2-NLS) was rapidly degraded under the high-temperature conditions, and the protein almost disappeared after 3 h of incubation (Fig. 2B). The degradation of GFP-VOZ2-NLS was completely inhibited by the addition of a 26S proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the nucleus-localized VOZ protein is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system. Heat stress treatment induced granule structures of VOZ2 and GFP-VOZ2 in the cytosol (Fig. 1). In eukaryotic cells, granular structures that form in the cytosol are referred to as SGs or P-bodies. In plants, SGs and P-bodies are known to be formed under various stressful conditions including heat, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and translation inhibition.

Under normal temperature conditions, both tagRFP-PABP8 and GFP-VOZ2 were dispersed throughout the cytosol, whereas after the incubation at 42°C, the cytoplasmic granular structures of tagRFP-PABP8 and GFP-VOZ2 were formed after 20 min under the high-temperature condition, and the 2 types of granular structures merged completely (Fig. 3A, C). In contrast, GFP-VOZ2 foci were partially merged with the P-body marker tagRFP-DCP1 after the heat stress treatment (Fig. 3B). From these results, we concluded that the VOZ2 protein is associated mainly with SGs and partially with P-bodies under heat stress conditions.  [[FIGURE]] Next, to determine whether VOZ2 is one of the essential components of SG assembly or disassembly under heat stress, we analyzed changes in the number of tagRFP-PABP8 signals of Arabidopsis seedlings in the WT or voz1voz2 background. PABP8 foci were induced not only in WT but also in the voz1voz2 background under heat stress (Fig. 4A). No statistically significant differences in the formation rate and the number of the granule structures were observed between plants with the WT and voz1voz2 background (Fig. 4B). After 24 h recovery at 22°C from 30 min of the heat stress treatment, tagRFP-PABP8 foci were completely disappeared, and the tagRFP-PABP8 fluorescence were dispersed throughout the cytosol not only in WT but also in the voz1voz2 mutant background (Fig. 4C). From these results, we concluded that VOZ2 is not essential for processes of assembly or disassembly of SGs.  [[FIGURE]] To determine how high temperature affects the expression of VOZ proteins, we measured the levels of VOZ1 and VOZ2 expression in WT and voz1voz2 plants by real-time qRT-PCR. Both VOZ1 and VOZ2 expression levels were reduced dramatically under the high temperature conditions (Fig. 5A, B). In contrast, expression of a drought and heat stress responsive transcription factor, DREB2A, was significantly enhanced in voz1voz2 plants compared with the WT under the high-temperature conditions (Fig. 5C). Note that DREB2A expression was already suppressed even in the non-heat stress conditions (Fig. 5C inset). These results suggest that VOZ2 protein function as transcriptional repressors of DREB2A not only under heat stress but also non-heat stress conditions.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 was used as the wild-type plants in this study. The voz1voz2–2 mutant was generated by crossing voz1 (WISCDSLOX489–492O10) and voz2 (SALK_115813). Plants expressing 35S::GFP-VOZ2 were kindly provided by T. Kohchi. GFP-VOZ2 with NES or NLS was expressed by introducing the plasmid donated by Y. Yasui into the voz1voz2–2. All plants used in this study were grown on 1/2 Murashige-Skoog (MS) agar plates at 22°C under a 16-h light, 8-h dark photoperiod. Primer sequences are listed in Table S1. For expression of the N-terminal tagRFP fusion under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, PABP8 (At1g49760) or DCP1 (At1g08370) were amplified by PCR from a cDNA derived from seedlings of Arabidopsis. tagRFP fragment and either PABP8 or DCP1 were inserted into pENTR using In-Fusion Cloning. The tagRFP-PABP8 and tagRFP-DCP1 fragments were transferred into the pFAST-G01 vector by Gateway LR recombination reactions. To generate transgenic Arabidopsis expressing tagRFP-DCP1 or tagRFP-PABP8 and GFP-VOZ2, transgenic Arabidopsis expressing 35S::GFP-VOZ2 was transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation.

The sample ground with a mortar and pestle and dissolved in a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Then, 12.5 μg of the supernatant of samples was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using a 5,000-fold diluted anti-VOZ2 antibody (CITATION) Nakai Y, Nakahira Y, Sumida H, Takebayashi K, Nagasawa Y, Yamasaki K, Akiyama M, Ohme-Takagi M, Fujiwara S, Shiina T, et al.

For qRT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from WT and voz1voz2 double-mutant plants with the Nucleo Spin RNA kit (TaKaRa). cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA of each plant using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (TOYOBO). Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using the THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO) and Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina) according to the manual. The expression level was normalized to an internal control gene (UBQ10, At4g05320). The primers are listed in Table S1. Fourteen-day-old seedlings were transferred to a liquid half-strength MS medium supplemented (or not supplemented) with 50 μM MG132 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and incubated for 5-h, with 10 μM wortmannin (Wako, Japan), and for 24-h. Total protein was extracted and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by protein gel blotting using the anti-VOZ2 antibody. GFP and tagRFP fluorescent images were obtained using a confocal laser microscope (ECLIPSE E600; Nikon). The captured images were processed in the Nikon EZ-C1 software. The image analysis was done using the ImageJ software. SGs and P-bodies whose size was larger than 0.5 μm were scored as positive. The analyzed image data are presented as the box-and-whisker plots. Boxes and solid lines in the boxes show the upper (75th) and lower (25th) quartiles and median values, respectively. Whiskers indicate the 95% confidence intervals.
