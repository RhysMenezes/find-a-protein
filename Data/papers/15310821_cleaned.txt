!~ABS~! The ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family of proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana Heynh. have a LOV domain, an F-box motif, and a kelch repeat region. LKP2 is a member of this family and functions either within or very close to the circadian oscillator in Arabidopsis. Promoter–GUS fusion studies revealed that the LKP2 gene was highly active in rosette leaves. In CaMV 35S:LKP2-GFP plants, GFP-associated fluorescence was detected in nuclei, suggesting that LKP2 is a nuclear protein. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that LKP2 interacted with some Arabidopsis Skp1-like proteins (ASK), as do other ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family proteins, suggesting that LKP2 can form an SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) complex that functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. LKP2 interacted not only with itself but also with other members of the family, LKP1 and FKF1. The two-hybrid analysis also demonstrated that LKP2 interacted with TOC1, a clock component, but not with CCA1 or LHY, negative regulators of TOC1 gene expression. The LOV domain of LKP2 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with TOC1. An interaction between LKP2 and APRR5, a paralogue of TOC1, was also observed, but LKP2 did not interact with APRR3, APRR7, or APRR9, other paralogues of TOC1.
!~RES~! The organ-specific LKP2 mRNA level had been examined previously: mRNA for LKP2 accumulated in rosette leaves, flowers, and siliques, and small amounts of mRNA were detected in roots, stems, cauline leaves, and seeds (Schultz et al., 2001). To monitor the promoter activity of LKP2, transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing an LKP2 promoter:GUS construct (Fig. 1) were generated. GUS signals were detected in all parts of the seedlings, but they were restricted to rosette leaves and root tips in 2-week-old rosette plants. In flowers, GUS activity was detected in sepals. GUS signals were detected in young siliques, but they were undetectable in old siliques. These results agree with the LKP2 mRNA level detected by RT-PCR (Schultz et al., 2001), suggesting that the 1.6 kb promoter region has enough elements to regulate LKP2 expression. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To visualize the intracellular localization of LKP2, the CaMV 35S promoter-derived GFP–LKP2 fusion construct was introduced into Arabidopsis, and high-expression lines were selected by RNA gel blot analysis (data not shown). The transgenic plants showed elongated hypocotyl and late-flowering phenotype, as observed in 35S:LKP2 plants (Schultz et al., 2001), suggesting that the introduced LKP2-GFP protein functions in the transgenic plants (data not shown). In those lines, GFP-associated fluorescence was distributed in nuclei but not in nucleoli (Fig. 2H), and very strong GFP signals were detected throughout the cells of 35S:GFP plants (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that LKP2 is a nuclear protein. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In Arabidopsis, more than 700 F-box proteins have been identified by genome analysis (Gagne et al., 2002; Kuroda et al., 2002; Risseeuw et al., 2003). However, since these annotation data were mainly based on computer program analysis, proteins that have no F-box activity or have lost their activity during evolution may be included in these numbers. To examine whether LKP2 functions as an F-box protein, interaction tests were performed with Arabidopsis SKP1-like (ASK) proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3A). Among 19 ASK proteins (ASK1-5, ASK7-14, ASK16-19, ASK20A, and ASK20B) tested, LKP2 interacted with 9 (ASK1-5, ASK11, ASK14, ASK20A, and ASK20B). The interactions of LKP2 with ASK proteins were similar to those of the other two with the ASK proteins, except with ASK3-5, ASK20A, and ASK20B. Since amino acid sequences of F-box regions of LKP1, LKP2, and FKF1 are similar to each other (LKP1 versus LKP2, 68.1%; LKP2 versus LKP3, 63.8%; LKP1 versus LKP3, 66.0% identity), the ASK preference (ASK1, ASK2, ASK11, and ASK14) of these proteins is not surprising. Furthermore, ASK1, ASK2, and ASK11 interact with a wide range of F-box proteins in Arabidopsis (Gagne et al., 2002; Risseeuw et al., 2003). The F-box regions of LKP1, LKP2, and FKF1 are sufficient to bind to ASK proteins (Fig. 3B–D). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In fission yeasts and mammals, F-box proteins were reported to function as homo- and heterodimers (Kominami et al., 1998; Suzuki et al., 2000). Furthermore, self-dimerization of WC-1 protein, a LOV domain containing a Zn-finger transcription factor involved in blue light sensing in Neurospora, was reported (Ballario et al., 1998). Therefore, the interactions of LKP2 with ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family proteins were examined by using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions were observed between LKP2 and LKP1, LKP2 and LKP2, and LKP2 and FKF1, but none were detected between LKP1 and LKP1, or LKP1 and FKF1 by yeast growth tests on restricted medium (Fig. 4A). The interactions were also supported by the β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that LKP2 may function in combination with LKP family proteins. The effects of light quality on yeast growth on restricted medium under different light conditions (red, far-red, blue, green, or white) were examined, but no growth differences were observed (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] From the analysis using 35S:LKP2 plants, LKP2 was postulated to function either within or very close to the circadian oscillator (Schultz et al., 2001). Since LKP2 is a nuclear protein (Fig. 2), an interaction analysis of LKP2 was performed with nuclear-localized clock-associated factors. In the growth test on SD medium lacking Ade, His, Leu, and Trp, a strong interaction of LKP2 and TOC1 was detected, and a weak interaction of LKP1 and TOC1 was detected (Fig. 5A). These interactions were also observed when the bait/prey configuration was inverted (data not shown). No interaction between FKF1 and TOC1 was observed. No interaction of LKP2 with CCA1 or LHY was detected. LKP1 and FKF1 also did not interact with CCA1 or LHY. The β-galactosidase activities were tested to confirm these interactions. Strong galactosidase activities were detected in yeasts possessing LKP2 and TOC1 constructs, and weak activities were detected in yeasts possessing LKP1 and TOC1 constructs (Fig. 5B). No significant galactosidase activities were detected in yeasts possessing any other combination of constructs assayed. These results also suggest that TOC1 can interact with both LKP1 and LKP2, but not with FKF1. None of the interactions were affected by any light quality treatment that was performed (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The portion of the LKP2 polypeptide that binds to TOC1 was also localized by the yeast two-hybrid system. Six constructs that expressed either one or two domains of LKP2 were examined (Fig. 6). Interactions between the LOV domain-containing peptides and TOC1 were detected, but no interactions were detected between TOC1 and LKP2 peptides without the LOV domain in this two-hybrid system. These results indicate that the LOV domain of LKP2 is necessary and sufficient for the binding of TOC1. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] TOC1 is a component of a central oscillator in Arabidopsis, and forms a feedback loop with the myb-like DNA-binding proteins CCA1 and LHY. On the other hand, there are four TOC1 paralogues in Arabidopsis, namely, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9. To analyse the specificity of LKP2 binding, APRR family proteins were used for two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 7A, B). As in the case of TOC1, a strong interaction was detected between LKP2 and APRR5, and a weak interaction was detected between LKP1 and APRR5. These interactions were also observed when the bait/prey configuration was inverted (data not shown). No other interactions were detected between LKP family proteins and any other APRR family proteins. Light quality did not affect the interaction between LKP2 and APRR5 in those examined (data not shown). The portion of LKP2 polypeptide that binds to APRR5 was also determined by the yeast two-hybrid system. As in the case of TOC1, the LOV domain of LKP2 is necessary and sufficient for the binding of APRR5 (Fig. 8). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype) were sown axenically on germination medium (GM) (Valvekens et al., 1988) containing 0.8% agar and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 3 d to break dormancy, and then grown under long-day conditions of 16 h of light (c. 100 μmol m−2 s−1) and 8 h of dark at 22 °C. Plasmid DNA templates for sequencing were prepared in automatic plasmid isolation systems (models PI-200 and PI-50α, Kurabo, Osaka, Japan). DNA sequences were determined by the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing method on a DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The GENETYX (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan) and Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) software systems were used for the analysis of DNA sequences. A 1.6 kb 5′ non-coding region with a 20 bp overlap with the LKP2 coding sequence from the ATG initiation codon was PCR-amplified by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) from genomic DNA of Arabidopsis. The primers used were 5′-GAGAGCTAGCTCTCCGGCAAAGTCTCGACC-3′ and 5′-TCTCCCCGGGCACTCCATTTGATTTTGCAT-3′, which introduced an NheI site and an SmaI site, respectively, at each end. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), sequenced entirely to verify the sequence, and then ligated into a promoterless β-glucuronidase (GUS) expression vector, pBI101 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The resultant construct was sequenced to verify in-frame fusion of the first six amino acids of the LKP2 to GUS protein region. The S65T modification version of GFP (smRS-GFP) (Davis and Vierstra, 1996) was used to make a GFP–LKP2 construct. The GFP coding region was PCR-amplified from psmRS-GFP from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA) with the primers 5′-GAGATCTAGACAATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCTCAGGCCTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC-3′, which introduced an XbaI site and an StuI site, respectively, at each end. The LKP2 coding region was also PCR-amplified from the cDNA with the primers 5′-GAGAAGGCCTTATGCAAAATCAAATGGAGT-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGATCCGATCAAGTACTTGCAGTGGT-3′, which introduced an StuI site and a BamHI site, respectively, at each end. Both PCR fragments were subcloned, sequenced entirely to verify the sequence, ligated at the StuI site, and sequenced again. Then the GFP–LKP2 fragment was introduced into pBE2113, an expression vector that contains the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (Mitsuhara et al., 1996). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis plants was performed by a simplified in planta infiltration method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic lines were selected on GM agar that contained 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. Histochemical localization of GUS activity in the transgenic plants was performed as described previously (Nakashima et al., 1977). Optical images of GFP activity and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining were obtained by using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a fluorescent unit and suitable filter units. GFP fluorescence was also visualized by using a Leica TCS-E confocal laser scanning microscope with an air-cooled argon ion laser system (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Total RNA was isolated from whole plants as described earlier (Kiyosue et al., 1992), fractionated in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and blotted onto a nylon filter. A DIG-labelled RNA probe prepared from the coding region of LKP2 cDNA or GFP was used for the hybridizations according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Chemiluminescence signals were detected by a Light Capture system (model AE-6962; Atto, Tokyo, Japan). Columbia versions of full-length cDNAs for LKP1, LKP2, FKF1, ASK, TOC1, CCA1, LHY, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9 were obtained by cDNA library screening (Kiyosue and Wada, 2000; Schultz et al., 2001), by RT-PCR with ReverTra Dash (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), or from the RIKEN Bio Resource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). The clones were PCR-amplified to generate suitable restriction enzyme sites, subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), and sequenced entirely to verify the sequences. The primers used for PCR were the following: 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGAGTGGGACAGTGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTTACGTGAGATAGCTCGCTAGTG-3′ for LKP1; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGCAAATCAAATGGAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGATCCGATCAAGTACTTGCAGTGGT-3′ for LKP2; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGCGAGAGAACATGCGATC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTTTACAGATCCGAGTCTTGCCG-3′ for FKF1; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTGCGAAGAAGATTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTGGTTCT-3′ for ASK1, 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGACGGTGAGAAAAATC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAACGCCCACTGATTCT-3′for ASK2; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGCAGAAACGAAGAAGATG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCACTCGAACGCCCACCTGTTCT-3′ for ASK3; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGCAGAAACGAAGAAGATG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCACTCGAACGCCCACTTGTTCT-3′ for ASK4; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGACGAAGATCATGTGG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTGAAAAGCCCATTGATTCT-3′ for ASK5; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGACAAAAAAGATCATG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTTATTGT-3′ for ASK7; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGACGAAAAAGATCATG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTTATTCT-3′ for ASK8; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGACGAAGAAGATCATA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTTATTCT-3′ for ASK9; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGACGAAGAAGATCATA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAACCCCATTGATTCT-3′ for ASK10, 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTTCGAAGATGATCGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTGATTCT-3′ for ASK11; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTTCGAAGATGATCGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTGATTCT-3′ for ASK12; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCGAAGATGGTTATGTTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTGATTCT-3′ for ASK13; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTTCCAACAAGATTGTT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTATTCAAAAGCCCATGCGTTTT-3′ for ASK14; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTTCTAACAAGATTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTAGGGCTTTGGATCTTCGTGTT-3′ for ASK15; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTTCGAAGAAGATTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTTAATTGAAAGCCCATTCGTTCT-3′ for ASK17; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGCTTCTTCTTCCGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTTACTCATTAAAAGTCCAAGCAT-3′ for ASK18; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTCTTCGAAAAAGATTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTAGGGTTTTGGAACTTGTTGTT-3′ for ASK19; 5′-AAGATCTGTATGTCAGAAGGTGATTTGGCC-3′ and 5′-TAGATCTCAGCCTTGTGATCTGTGAAACAG-3′ for ASK20A; 5′-AAGATCTGTATGTCAGAAGGTGATTTGGCC-3′ and 5′-TAGATCTTGGAGATTGACCTGTATGCCGTC-3′ for ASK20B; 5′-AGAGCTCGTATGGATTTGAACGGTGAGTGT-3′ and 5′-AGAGCTCTCAAGTTCCCAAAGCATCATCCT-3′ for TOC1; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGAGACAAATTCGTCTGGA-3′ and 5′-ACGGATCCCTCATGTGGAAGCTTGAGTTTC-3′ for CCA1; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGATACTAATACATCTGGA-3′ and 5′-ACGGATCCTCATGTAGAAGCTTCTCCTTCC-3′ for LHY; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTGTTTTAATAACATTGAA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAATTGTCTTCACTTCCTGATT-3′ for APRR3; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTGGCAAACGTGGCCACGT-3′ and 5′-TGGATCCTATGGAGCTTGTGTGGATTGGAC-3′ for APRR5; 5′-ACCCGGGTATGAATGCTAATGAGGAGGGGG-3′ and 5′-ACCCGGGTTAGCTATCCTCAATGTTTTTTA-3′ for APRR7; and 5′-AGGATCCGTATGGGGGAGATTGTGGTTTTA-3′ and 5′-TGGATCCTCATGATTTTGTAGACGCGTCTG-3′ for APRR9. These PCR primers were also used for the RT-PCR. Each domain construct of LKP2 was also constructed by PCR, subcloned into pCR4-TOPO, and sequenced entirely to verify the sequences. The primers used for PCR were the following: 5′-AGGATCCGTATGCAAATCAAATGGAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-TGGATCCTTAGGGCCCAGGCCTTCTAGGAATTTCTTTTGC-3′ for the LOV domain (L) of LKP2; 5′-AGGATCCGTATATCTCGCTCATTTACTTCT-3′ and 5′-TGGATCCTTACCTTTTTGCACCGGGAACAC-3′ for the F-box region (F) of LKP2; 5′-AGGATCCGTATTGGTTGGGTGCGACTGGCC-3′ and 5′- TCTCGGATCCGATCAAGTACTTGCAGTGGT-3′ for the kelch repeat region (K) of LKP2; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGCAAATCAAATGGAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-TGGATCCTTACCTTTTTGCACCGGGAACAC-3′ for LF of LKP2; and 5′-AGGATCCGTATATCTCGCTCATTTACTTCT-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGATCCGATCAAGTACTTGCAGTGGT-3′ for FK of LKP2. For the LK (L+K) construct of LKP2, two PCR fragments were generated by using primer sets 5′-AGGATCCGTATGCAAATCAAATGGAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-AGATCTAGGCCTTCTAGGAATTTCTTTTGC-3′ for L, and 5′-AAGATCTATTGGTTGGGTGCGACTGGCCCG-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGATCCGATCAAGTACTTGCAGTGGT-3′ for K; subcloned into pCR4-TOPO; and sequenced entirely for verification. Then the L fragment was cut out by BamHI and BglII double digestion, and ligated into the BglII site of the pCR4-subcloned K fragment. The junction region was sequenced to confirm the in-frame ligation. The subcloned fragments were cut out with appropriate restriction enzymes and introduced into the multi-cloning sites of either pGADT7, which contains the GAL4 activation domain, or pGBKT7, which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Clontech). The ligated junction regions were sequenced to verify the in-frame ligation. Appropriate pairs of constructs were introduced into AH109 yeast cells. Transformants were grown on synthetic complete (SD) medium that lacked leucine and tryptophan, and were assayed on SD medium that lacked adenine (Ade), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), and tryptophan (Trp), but was supplemented with or without 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Interaction tests were performed as described in the Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 user's manual and the Yeast Protocols Handbook from Clontech by using at least three independent transformant colonies. In this system, the reporter genes ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1/lacZ are under the control of three completely heterologous, GAL4 upstream-activating sequences and TATA box elements. The HIS3 nutritional marker can be used for the identification of weak positive interactions, while the ADE2 marker is very stringent and reduces the incidence of false positives (James et al., 1996). Expression of the lacZ reporter further verifies the two-hybrid interactions and reduces the false positives. In the spot assay, overnight liquid cultures (OD600=1.5) in SD medium without Leu and Trp were spotted (5 μl) onto SD agar medium without Ade, His, Leu, and Trp, with or without 3-AT. Yeast colonies were cultured at 30 °C under red, far-red, blue, green, or white illumination (photon flux density 40 μmol m−2 s−1) (LED system: Sanyo, Osaka, Japan), or in the dark. For the β-galactosidase activity assay, the yeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation from each overnight culture, and permeabilized by three cycles of freeze–thawing. The crude extracts were incubated with O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside at 30 °C, and OD420 was recorded. The activities were expressed as Miller units. For immunoblot analysis, yeast cells were grown in 50 ml YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) medium for 4–8 h (OD600=0.6), pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were added to 400 μl extraction buffer (40 mM TRIS HCl pH 6.8, 8 M urea, 5% SDS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.4 mg ml−1 bromophenol blue, 0.8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 6.2 μg ml−1 pepstatin A, 1.86 μM leupeptin, 9.0 mM benzamidine, 23.0 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 0.77 mg ml−1 phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride), and homogenized. Crude cell extract (12 μl) was loaded onto each lane, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nylon membrane. Anti-myc or anti-HA antibodies was used to detect the proteins tested.
