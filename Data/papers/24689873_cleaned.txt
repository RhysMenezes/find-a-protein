!~ABS~! The cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80 have well-established roles in RNA metabolism and plant growth and development. Although these proteins are thought to be involved in the plant’s response to environmental stress, their functions in this process are unclear. Here we demonstrated that Arabidopsis cbp20 and cbp80 null mutants had abnormal leaves and flowers and exhibited increased sensitivity to salt stress. The aberrant phenotypes were more pronounced in the cbp20/80 double mutant. Quantification by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) identified 77 differentially expressed proteins in the cbp20 and cbp80 lines compared with the wild-type Col-0 under salt stress conditions. Most of these differentially expressed proteins were synergistically expressed in cbp20 and cbp80, suggesting that CBP20 and CBP80 have synergistic roles during the salt stress response. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that CBP20 and CBP80 physically interacted with each other. Further analysis revealed that CBP20/80 regulated the splicing of genes involved in proline and sugar metabolism and that the epigenetic and post-translational modifications of these genes were involved in salt stress tolerance. Our data suggest a link between CBP20/80-dependent protein ubiquitination/sumoylation and the salt stress response.
!~RES~! To establish the roles of CBP20 and CBP80, we first identified cbp20 (Salk-086644) and cbp80 (Salk-24285) T-DNA null mutants. As shown in Figure CITATIONA, CBP20 contains 8 exons and CBP80 contains 18. The exogenous T-DNA transporter inserted into the 5'-UTR region of CBP20 inactivated transcription in the cbp20 mutant, and the T-DNA inserted into the 13th exon of CBP80 inactivated transcription in the cbp80 mutant (Figure CITATIONA). Using primers designed to detect the T-DNA fragment (LB primer), the left region (F1, F2 primer), and the right region (R1, R2 primer) of CBP20/CBP80, we found that the F1/R1 and F2/R2 primer pairs successfully amplified bands in the wild-type (Col-0) lines but failed to amplify fragments in the cbp20 and cbp80 lines due to the T-DNA insertion. The LB/R1 and LB/R2 primer pairs amplified a band in cbp20 and cbp80, indicating that the T-DNA insertion is indeed present in the CBP20/CBP80 region (Figure CITATIONB). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the cbp20 and cbp80 lines had very low levels of CBP20 and CBP80 transcripts in comparison with the wild type Col-0 line. We also crossed the cbp20 and cbp80 lines to generate the cbp20/80 double mutant. Similarly, T-DNA insertions were confirmed by PCR-based genotyping and qRT-PCR analysis (Figure CITATIONB,C). We examined the localization of CBP20 and CBP80 in transgenic plants harboring GUS fusions of the CBP20 or CBP80 promoters. Analysis of GUS expression in ProCBP20:GUS and ProCBP80:GUS transgenic lines showed that CBP20 and CBP80 were both constitutively expressed. CBP20 and CBP80 expression was strong in the seeds, leaves, flowers, and roots (Supplemental Figure 1A,B in the CITATION), suggesting that CBP20 and CBP80 have ubiquitous roles in plant growth and development, which correlates with previous study.CITATION To determine the localization of CBP20 and CBP80 proteins, we fused CBP20 and CBP80 to the GFP gene and expressed these constructs under the constitutively active cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (named Pro35S:CBP20-GFP and Pro35S:CBP80-GFP, respectively). Then, we transiently expressed Pro35S:CBP20-GFP and Pro35S:CBP80-GFP in tobacco leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated injection or in Arabidopsis protoplasts. We observed strong GFP fluorescence in the nuclei of tobacco leaves (Supplemental Figure 2A,B in the CITATION) and Arabidopsis protoplasts (Supplemental Figure 2C,D in the CITATION), suggesting that CBP20 and CBP80 function in the nucleus. Such location also coincide with the functions of CBP20 and CBP80 of regulating gene transcription and epigenetic regulation in the nucleus. Given that CBP20 and CBP80 are involved in ABA signal transduction and drought stress,CITATION we wanted to investigate if they also function in salt stress. We thus examined their sensitivity to salt stress. When grown on vertical MS plates without salt stress, the root lengths of 2 week old cbp20 seedlings were similar to those of the wild type, whereas cbp80 and cbp20/80 root growth was more severely inhibited under salt stress (Figure CITATIONA). Exposure to an increasing gradient (25–100 mM) of salt (NaCl) resulted in a gradual reduction in root length of cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 plants. Furthermore, the cbp20/80 double mutant was more sensitive to high concentrations of salt than was either of the single mutants (Figure CITATIONA,B). Similarly, the cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 mutants were sensitive to salt stress when grown on soil irrigated with 100 mM salt (Figure CITATIONC), and the salt-sensitive phenotype of cbp20/80 was more pronounced than that of either of the single mutants. In addition, the biomass of 2 week old cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 plants grown in the salt-treated soil was lower than that of the wild type (Figure CITATIOND). To establish the underlying function of CBP20 and CBP80 in the salt stress response, we conducted an iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) proteome analysis of differential protein changes in wild type, cbp20, and cbp80 plants after 3 days of treatment with 100 mM NaCl. Total spectra were generated, and the data collected were analyzed using Mascot software. Using this approach, we identified 20 587 unique peptides and 3994 proteins. Over 67% of the proteins identified included at least two peptides. We determined the ratios of protein abundance for the following four groups: (1) cbp20 (control)/wild type (control), (2) cbp80 (control)/wild type (control), (3) cbp20 (salt stress)/wild type (salt), and (4) cbp80 (salt)/wild type (salt) for proteins affected by salt stress in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants. With a threshold of fold-change cutoff of >2-fold for increased expression and <0.6-fold for decreased expression, a total of 40 proteins differed significantly (p < 0.05) in the comparisons of WT, cbp20, and cbp80 without NaCl treatment (control experiments, Supplemental Table 3 in the CITATION). Some of these 40 proteins were associated with auxin signaling, such as AT2G44080 (ARGOS-like protein), AT2G46370 (auxin-responsive GH3 family protein), and AT5G56650 (IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like 1), suggesting a mechanism whereby CBP20/80 mediates auxin distribution or leaf shape development. Furthermore, some proteins related to epigenetic modification or RNA biogenesis, including microRNA biosynthesis, such as AT3G54560 (histone H2A 11), AT3G06400 (chromatin-remodeling protein 11), AT1G58470 (RNA-binding protein 1), and AT1G10930 (ATP-dependent DNA helicase), were also shown to be differentially expressed in the cbp20 or cbp80 mutants compared with the wild type in the absence of salt stress. These data support previous findings that CBP20/CBP80 regulates microRNA biosynthesis to modulate leaf development.CITATION Proteins involved in ubiquitination or SUMO modification, such as AT1G55860 (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UPL1), were also differentially expressed, suggesting that CBP20 and CBP80 are involved in post-transcriptional modification during plant growth and development. Our iTRAQ results showed that a total of 77 proteins had significant differences in expression (p < 0.05, increased >2-fold or decreased <0.6-fold) in the cbp20 or cbp80 mutant compared with the wild type (Table CITATION, Supplemental Tables 4 and 5 in the CITATION). Among these 77 proteins, 33 and 40 were up-regulated in cbp20 or cbp80, respectively, under salt stress compared with the wild type, and 44 and 37 proteins were down-regulated in cbp20 and cbp80, respectively, under saline stress compared with the wild type (Figure CITATIONA, Supplement Figure 3 in the CITATION). On the basis of Gene Ontology analysis (WEGO, http://wego.genomics.org.cn) and BLAST alignments, the proteins that exhibited significant changes under normal conditions and salt treatment were classified into eight functional categories, namely, energy and material metabolism, defense-response-related, ubiquitination and sumoylation modification, epigenetic modification, protein kinase and phosphatase, cell division and structure, hormone-related, and transcriptional factors (Figure CITATIONB). In particular, proteins involved in epigenetic modification, such as AT1G10930 (ATP-dependent DAN helicase), At2g25170 (encodes an SWI/SWF nuclear-localized chromatin remodeling factor of the CHD3 group), AT3G54610 (encodes a histone acetyltransferase), and AT5G03740 (HD2-type histone eactylase HDAC); involved in ubiquitination and sumoylation modification, such as AT1G55860 (E3 ubiquitin ligase family protein), AT2G36060 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1C), AT1G55860 (encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase), AT3G48340 (cysteine proteinases superfamily protein), and AT5G05080 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 22); and involved in defense responses, such as AT1G02920 (encodes glutathione transferase), AT4G18350 (encodes 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase), AT2G39800 (encodes a delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase), and AT5G44000 (glutathione S-transferase family protein) were coincidentally up-regulated or down-regulated after salt stress in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants, indicating that CBP20 and CBP80 coordinately modulate protein expression during the saline stress response (Table CITATION, Supplemental Figure 3 in the CITATION). It is reported that CBP20 interacts with CBP80 to participate in pre-mRNA alternative splicing to modulate gene expression,CITATION and thus it is possible that CBP80 functions coordinately with CBP20 to regulate differential protein accumulation by synergistically controlling the alternative splicing of genes under salt stress. To test this possibility, we examined the transcriptional products of several genes that encode proteins showing significant differential expression in our iTRAQ analysis (Figure CITATION). For instance, we examined the transcriptional products of AT2G33380, which encodes a calcium-binding protein and is induced by salt, ABA, and drought stress.CITATION The encoded protein was markedly down-regulated in cbp20 and cbp80 compared with the wild type after exposure to salt stress. RT-PCR analysis of cbp20 and cbp80 seedlings using primers specific to AT2G33380 revealed a prominent band and a slower moving minor band. Whereas the prominent band was also present in the wild type, the minor band was barely detectable. Further analysis using primers corresponding to the first and third exon confirmed that the larger band in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants resulted from the retention of the first and second introns. Salt stress increased the accumulation of the smaller band in wild-type seedlings but increased the abundance of the larger band in cbp20 and cbp80. The intensity of the larger band was greatest in the cbp20/cbp80 double mutant, suggesting that CBP20 and CBP80 act synergistically to direct the correct splicing of this gene (Figure CITATION). This gene could be modulated by histone methylation, and CBP20 and CBP80 CBC may modify the corresponding histones.CITATION Furthermore, AT3G07250 and AT5G03740 encode a putative RNA-binding protein and HD2-type histone deacetylase HDAC protein, respectively. These two proteins were down-regulated in cbp20 and cbp80 after exposure to saline stress compared with the wild type. RT-PCR of these two genes showed that a large minor band that was absent in the wild type appeared in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants before saline stress and that the intensity of this band increased after salt stress, becoming visible in the wild-type sample (Figure CITATION). It is possible that the aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of these two genes in cbp20 and cbp80 caused the down-regulation of the proteins encoded by AT3G07250 and AT5G03740. In line with this notion, these two proteins are involved in the response to abiotic stresses, such as ABA.CITATION AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 10 (ARF10, AT2G28350) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 17 (ARF17, AT1G77850) are two important auxin-responsible proteins involved in plant development and environmental stress responses. We found that these two proteins were down-regulated in cbp20 and cbp80 mutants in the presence or absence of saline stress. In agreement with our iTRAQ data, RT-PCR analysis of these two genes showed one larger band in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutant that was absent in the wild type (Figure CITATION), suggesting that incorrect splicing of ARF10 and ARF17 resulted in the down-regulation of the two encoded proteins, which may underlie the abnormal serrations in the leaves of cbp20 an cbp80. Because ARF10 and ARF17 are the targets of miR160CITATION and ARF17 expression may be regulated by AGO1,CITATION one component of the machinery that generates microRNA, it is possible that CBP20 and CBP80 affect the expression of ARF10 and ARF17 by regulating microRNA biogenesis. The reactive oxygen species burst and increase in antioxidant enzyme activity were characterized in plants subjected to abiotic stress, including saline stress.CITATION We found that the antioxidant enzyme gene AT5G44000, which encodes a glutathione S-transferase family protein, exhibited incorrect splicing in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants, and that salt stress increased the abundance of the incorrectly spliced band (Figure CITATION). This finding supports our iTRAQ data, which showed that the expression of both of these proteins was down-regulated in cbp20 and cbp80 before or after exposure to salt stress. These data indicate that CBP20 and CBP80 mediate many mechanisms during plant in response to saline stress, such as CBP20 and CBP80 mediating the gene splicing involved in the microRNA biogenesis (such as miR160 and its target genes ARF10 and ARF17) and epigenetic regulators (such as RNA-binding protein and HDAC protein), the calcium signal (such as calcium-binding protein), or the redox status (such as antioxidant enzyme and its target metabolites, for example, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide ions, etc.). Similarly, the degree of aberrant splicing of AT1G06850, which encodes a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor (b-ZIP), was also increased in cbp20 and cbp80 after exposure to salt stress, and this effect was enhanced in the cbp20/80 double mutant, suggesting the roles of CBP20/80-mediated splicing of transcriptional factors during saline stress. The amino acid proline accumulates in response to multiple forms of environmental stress, such as high temperature and cold.CITATION Salt stress also increases proline content in Arabidopsis. P5CS1 has a critical function in proline metabolism in plants. The alternative splicing of P5CS1 in different ecotypes of Arabidopsis resulted in differential responses to osmotic stress.CITATION Here we identified at least two types of P5CS1 pre-mRNA splicing variants in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants (Figure CITATIONA,B). In addition, the abundance of the aberrant splicing products increased after exposure to salt stress (Figure CITATIONB). This finding supported our iTRAQ data, which showed that the protein level of P5CS1 in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants was at 0.394 and 0.270 times less than that in the wild type under saline stress (Table CITATION). We used an anti-P5CS1 antibody to monitor P5CS1 accumulation in the cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 mutants after exposure to salt stress. P5CS1 levels showed a marked increase in the wild type after exposure to salt stress; however, the increase was limited in cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 (Figure CITATION). Consistent with this finding, the proline content rapidly increased in the wild type after 3 or 6 days of salt stress, reacted about 0.8 and 1 mg g–1 FW. Whereas a similar increase in proline content was observed in cbp20 and cbp80 lines exposed to salt stress, the increase was markedly less than that in the wild type, only about half of wild type after saline stress. These data suggest that CBP20/80 mediates the correct splicing of P5CS1 pre-mRNA, which is important for the salt stress-induced proline content increase and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. Starch, as a source of carbon, is involved in the plant’s response to environmental stress.CITATION The transcription factor IDD14 binds to the promoter region of Qua-Quine starch (QQS), which regulates starch degradation, to modulate its expression.CITATION Alternative gene splicing is involved in development and in stress responses.CITATION IDD14 has two different splicing variants; the larger variant is termed IDD14α, and the smaller variant, which lacks the first exon encoding the DNA-binding motif, is termed IDD14β (Figure CITATIONA). The IDD14β form of protein can compete with IDD14α homodimers to generate IDD14α-IDD14β heterodimers, which reduce binding to the promoter of QQS and thereby reduce starch degradation.CITATION In cold stress, the transcriptional increase in the IDD14b form reduced the ability of IDD14 to bind to the promoter region of QQS and thereby reduced QQS expression and prevented starch degradation.CITATION Here we examined the alternative splicing of IDD14 pre-mRNA using primers corresponding to the IDD14α and IDD14β form, respectively (Figure CITATIONA). We found that one spectra corresponding to the first exon of IDD14α sustained high levels in the cbp20 or cbp80 mutant after salt stress, while the expression level of this spectra was markedly reduced in the wild type (Table CITATION, Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 in the CITATION), indicating that expression of the IDD14α form was higher in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants than in the wild type. However, we noticed that the expression level of two other spectra, corresponding to the second and third exons, was increased in the wild-type lines (Table CITATION, Supplemental Tables 4 and 5 in the CITATION), suggesting that the IDD14β form was more abundant in the wild type after salt stress. These iTRAQ data suggest that differences in IDD14α and IDD14β expression were associated with the alternative splicing of IDD14 during salt stress. To test this notion, we used RT-PCR analysis to determine the abundance of IDD14α and IDD14β transcripts in cbp20, cbp80, and wild-type plants under salt stress. The mRNA variant encoding the IDD14α type showed a marked increase in expression in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants under salt stress compared with the wild type (Figure CITATIONB). In contrast, the IDD14β type increased in the wild type under salt stress compared with cbp20 and cbp80, which correlated with our iTRAQ data on the differential accumulation patterns of IDD14α and IDD14β in the cbp20, cbp80, and wild-type lines under salt stress. We also prepared a protein antibody corresponding to full-length IDD14. As shown in Figure CITATIONC, this antibody detected two separate bands, representing the IDD14α and IDD14β forms, in the cbp20, cbp80, and wild-type lines in the absence of salt stress. The larger band, corresponding to the IDD14α form, did not show obvious changes in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutant after 3 days of salt stress, but the abundance of the smaller band, corresponding to the IDD14β form, gradually increased in the wild-type line but not in the cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 double mutant during salt stress treatment. Consistent with the expression pattern of IDD14α and IDD14β after salt stress, we found that QQS expression increased in the cbp20 and cbp80 lines, and to a greater extent in the double mutant, after salt stress, compared with the wild type (Figure CITATIOND). The increase in the IDD14β form interfered with the binding of IDD14α to the promoter of QSS and thereby suppressed QSS transcription. It is possible that loss of CBP20 or CBP80 in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutant caused the incorrectly spliced variant of IDD14α to reduce the generation of IDD14β after exposure to salt stress, which caused an increase in the ratio of IDD14α to IDD14β, thus activating the transcription of QQS and causing increased starch degradation in cbp20 and cbp80. In contrast, the increase in IDD14β accumulation in the wild type resulted in efficient splicing of IDD14 and limited the binding of IDD14α to the promoter region of QQS, subsequently reducing QQS transcription. As a result, more starch accumulated in wild-type lines under salt stress, we found that the starch content in the wild type reached ∼0.7 and 0.9 mg g–1 FW after 3 or 6 days of saline stress, while such content in the cbp20 and cbp80 was reduced by ∼23% compared with wild type after saline stress (Figure CITATIONE). The iodine solution staining can be used to visualize the starch accumulation in the plant. In agreement with the previously described transcriptional results, our staining results using Lugol solution (containing aqueous potassium iodide and iodine) staining indicated more starch accumulation in the leaves of wild type after saline stress, while less starch accumulation was observed in the cbp20 or cbp80 mutants after saline stress. Previous study demonstrates that salt stress induces starch accumulation, which improves the plant’s defense response.CITATION Here we also found that salt stress increased starch content in wild-type plants and that this was accompanied by an increase in IDD14β transcription and a reduction in QQS expression. It is possible that the sensitivity of cbp20 and cbp80 to salt stress results from the incorrect splicing of IDD14, which reduces IDD14β accumulation. As a result, QQS transcription is maintained at high levels, which promotes starch degradation and possibly underlies the sensitivity of cbp20 and cbp80 to salt stress. Protein sumoylation modification is associated with RNA-level epigenetic regulation,CITATION and the CBC affects chromatin H2B ubiquitination by facilitating pre-mRNA splicing and histone H2B ubiquitination,CITATION and is involved in chromatin epigenetic modification.CITATION It is possible that CBP20 and CBP80 affect protein post-translation modification, such as ubiquitination or sumoylation modification. Our iTRAQ data showed that most ubiquitination- or sumoylation-related proteins, such as AT2G36060, which encodes ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1C, and AT5G60410, which encodes a plant small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, were markedly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the cbp20 or cbp80 mutant after salt stress compared with the wild-type line. It is possible that loss of CBP20 or CBP80 in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants affects the degree of ubiquitination or sumoylation and thereby modulates the salt stress response. To test this possibility, we examined the degree of ubiquitination and sumoylation in the wild-type line after various periods of salt stress using specific antiubi and antisumo antibodies. As shown in Figure CITATION, salt stress induced a marked increase in protein ubiquitination and sumoylation in the wild type; however, the degree of ubiquitination and sumoylation in the cbp20 and cbp80 mutants was reduced after salt stress, and this reduction was likely related to the increased sensitivity of the mutants to salt stress. Miller et al. reported that several factors, such as STA1 (AT4G03430), regulate mRNA splicing as dynamic targets of stress-induced sumoylation in Arabidopsis.CITATION For instance, STA1 interacts with CBP20/80 to mediate gene splicing or epigenetic modification,CITATION and the CBC facilitates SUS1 splicing by altering the H2B ubiquitination status.CITATION These lines of evidence indicate the association between CBP20/80-mediated gene splicing and protein sumoylation/ubiquitination status. It is possible that CBP20/80 modulates gene splicing under salt stress by altering the protein ubiquitination and sumoylation status of key target components involved in gene splicing or epigenetic processes.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype (Col-0) plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates at 22 ± 2 °C under 16 h light (100 μmol m–2s–1)/8 h dark conditions. The T-DNA insertion mutants cbp20 (Salk-086644) and cbp80 (Salk-24285) were obtained from ABRC (www.arabidopsis.org), verified using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 1 in the CITATION, and grown as previously described. For salt stress treatment, wild-type Col-0, cbp20, cbp80, and cbp20/80 double mutant seeds were sown on MS medium containing various concentrations of sodium chloride (25, 75, and 100 mM NaCl, respectively). After 1 week of growth, photographs were taken and root lengths were measured. For salt stress treatment in soil, the culture soil was prepared by mixing fertilizer, vermiculite, and perlite at a ratio of 3:1:1. Seedlings were first grown on MS medium for 2 weeks and then transferred to the prepared soil for growth under the same conditions as previously described. After 1 week of growth, the soil was irrigated with 100 mM NaCl solution once every other day. After 2 weeks of treatment, the plants were photographed and biomass was measured. Proline and starch content were measured as described.CITATION In brief, the treated seedlings were harvested, weighed, and extracted in 3% sulfosalicylic acid. An aliquot of each extract (2 mL) was incubated with 2 mL of ninhydrin reagent (2.5% [w/v] ninhydrin, 60% [v/v] glacial acetic acid, and 40% 6 M phosphoric acid) and 2 mL of glacial acetic acid at 100 °C for 40 min, and the reaction was terminated in an ice bath for 15 min. Toluene (5 mL) was added, followed by vortexing and incubation at 23 °C for 24 h. The absorbance was measured at 520 nm. Treated seedlings (1 g) were used to measure soluble sugar content using a Sugar Assay Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). After grinding the plants in liquid nitrogen, soluble sugars were extracted two times with 80% ethanol, and fractions were collected and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min. Ethanol was evaporated from the supernatant using a vacuum evaporator, and the volume of the solution was adjusted to 400 mL using triple-distilled water to measure the sugar content. The insoluble pellets were used to measure the starch content using the Starch Assay Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Megazyme). The starch content in the leaves was also indicated by iodine staining using the Lugol solution (containing aqueous potassium iodide plus iodine, cat. L6146, Sigma Chemical). After 3 days of growth on MS plates containing 100 mM NaCl, the seedlings were collected by liquid nitrogen freezing and proteins were extracted using a previously described phenol extraction procedure.CITATION In brief, ∼1 g of frozen seedlings was ground with a mortar in liquid nitrogen and 5 mL of extraction buffer containing 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 100 mM KCl, 50 mM l-ascorbic acid, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added. After centrifugation (12 000g; 15 min; 4 °C), the resulting suspension solution was transferred to a 20 mL tube, and Tris-phenol (2 volus; pH 8.0, Amersco, Canada) was added. The mixture was thoroughly vortexed before centrifuging at 12 000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper phenolic phases were transferred to a 50 mL tube, and then 5 volumes of 100 mM ammonium acetate/methanol were added. After careful mixing, the mixture was stored at −20 °C overnight. The supernatant was removed carefully after centrifugation at 13 000g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein pellets were used immediately or suspended in 25 mL of ice-cooled methanol for 2 h at −20 °C for further analysis. After three independent treatments, the seedlings were pooled to yield one biological replicate. Four biological replicates, each containing 75 mg protein, were prepared for iTRAQ labeling. Detailed information about sample labeling is provided in Supplemental Table 2 in the CITATION. The pellet protein was dissolved in 1% SDS, 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, followed by reduction, alkylation, trypsin digestion, and labeling using 8-plex iTRAQ reagent kits, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (AB Sciex, USA). Six groups of replicate sample, consisting of three groups of sample (i.e., col-0, cbp20, and cbp80) before saline treatment and three groups of sample (i.e., cbol-0, cbp20, and cbp80) after saline treatment were used, and every replicate group consisted of three samples. Thus, at least 18 samples were required for labeling. Information about sample labeling is provided in Supplemental Table 2 in the CITATION. After labeling, the samples were combined and lyophilized, and the peptide mixture was dissolved in strong cation exchange (SCX) solvent A (25% v/v acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 2.8). The peptides were fractionated on an Agilent HPLC system 1100 with a polysulfethyl A column (2.1 × 100 mm, 5 μm, 300 A, PolyLC, Columbia, MD). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 200 μL/min with a linear gradient of 0–20% solvent B (25% v/v acetonitrile, 500 mM ammonium formate) over 50 min, followed by ramping up to 100% solvent B in 5 min and holding for 10 min. The absorbance at 214 nm was monitored, and a total of 12 fractions were collected. Each SCX fraction was lyophilized and dissolved in solvent A (3% acetonitrile v/v, 0.1% formic acid v/v) and then was submitted to analyze with a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan Scientific, San Jose, CA). Samples were separated on Hypersile Gold C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid from 3 to 50% in 90 min at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. Peptides were then sprayed into the orifice of the Q-Exactive MS/MS system with a spray voltage of 2.2 kV. Full-scan mass spectra were performed over 200–1800 m/z at high resolution at 60 000. At least the four most intense precursor ions were selected for collision-induced fragmentation in the linear ion trap with 50–2000 m/z and 30–2000 ms at a resolution of 7500. Dynamic exclusion was employed within 40 s to prevent repetitive. The raw LC–MS/MS files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The software was connected to the Mascot Search Engine server, version 2.3 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). The spectra were searched against an A. thaliana database downloaded from TAIR10 version (TAIR10_pep_20110103_representative_gene_model) available at ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/Sequences/blast_datasets/OLD/ dated April 2012 with a total of 59 687 entries including 1413 small proteins and 45 common contaminants. Search parameters included iTRAQ 8-plex quantification, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification. Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme, and one missed cleavage was allowed. Peptide mass tolerance was set at10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.1 Da. An automatic decoy database search was performed as part of the search. False discovery rates (FDRs) for peptide identification of all searches were <1.0%. The data were prefiltered to exclude MS/MS spectra containing fewer than three peaks or with a total ion count below 50. Mascot results were filtered with the Mascot Percolator package to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of peptide identification. For differential analyses, all proteins identified and quantified with at least four independent peptides with a high degree of confidence (FDR 1%) were selected. The quantification was performed normalizing the results of all of the measured iTRAQ reported ratios value by Proteome Discoverer1.3 software. Only the significant ratios from the replicates were used to calculate the average ratio for the protein. It should be noted that each p value was generated based on quantitative information derived from at least three independent peptides in each replicate. Cut-offs of 2- or 0.6-fold were set to indicate up-regulation or down-regulation of proteins, and a p value of <0.05 was used to indicate significance. Total RNA was extracted from the whole young seedlings subjected to different treatments using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed to yield cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega).CITATION The alternatively spliced fragments were amplified from the cDNA using primers listed in Supplemental Table 1 in the CITATION. The amplification products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Proteins from seedlings subjected to different treatments were extracted in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF with vigorous vortexing. After centrifugation at 20 000g, 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatants were collected. The supernatant protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Quick Start Bradford Kit (cat. 500-0201), according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The extracted proteins (10 μg per sample) were separated on 12% SDS–PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Mini-PROTEAN system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% milk and washed at least three times with PBS buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST), each for 5 min. Primary antibodies were prepared in PBS buffer containing 1% BSA and then incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. After removing unbound antibodies by washing with PBST, the blots were incubated with rabbit antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase conjugates, Promega) in PBST buffer at a dilution of 1:10 000 and visualized using a chemiluminescent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The P5CS1 antibody (1:1000) was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with a synthesized peptide (MEELDRSRAFARDVK) corresponding to the N-terminal fragment of Arabidopsis P5CS1. Anti-SUMO (1:1000) and anti-Ubi (1:2000) antibody were purchased from Agrisera (Vannas, Sweden). The CBP20 and CBP80 promoters were PCR-amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA. The CBP20 promoter fragment was cloned into a modified pEGAD-GFP vector in which GFP was replaced with GUS to generate the ProCBP20::GUS construct, and the CBP80 promoter fragment was cloned into the pGREEN:GUSCITATION in which the GUS gene was inserted into the basic pGREEN vector to generate ProCBP80::GUS constructs. The primer sequences used for vector construction are listed in Supplemental Table 1 in the CITATION. The constructs were then transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101, and transgenic lines harboring ProCBP2::GUS and ProCBP80::GUS were obtained by floral dip and hygromycin screening.CITATION GUS staining was detected as reported previously.CITATION
