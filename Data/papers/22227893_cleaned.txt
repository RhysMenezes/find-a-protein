!~ABS~! Plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms to adapt to N starvation. NITRATE TRANSPORTER2.4 (NRT2.4) is one of seven NRT2 family genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, and NRT2.4 expression is induced under N starvation. Green fluorescent protein and β-glucuronidase reporter analyses revealed that NRT2.4 is a plasma membrane transporter expressed in the epidermis of lateral roots and in or close to the shoot phloem. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of NRT2.4 in roots is complementary with that of the major high-affinity nitrate transporter NTR2.1. Functional analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in planta showed that NRT2.4 is a nitrate transporter functioning in the high-affinity range. In N-starved nrt2.4 mutants, nitrate uptake under low external supply and nitrate content in shoot phloem exudates was decreased. In the absence of NRT2.1 and NRT2.2, loss of function of NRT2.4 (triple mutants) has an impact on biomass production under low nitrate supply. Together, our results demonstrate that NRT2.4 is a nitrate transporter that has a role in both roots and shoots under N starvation.
!~RES~! The expression of NRT2 genes in Arabidopsis is regulated by N availability (CITATION; CITATION). NRT2.4 and NRT2.1 expression patterns are different, with the NRT2.4 transcript level being highest under severe N starvation and repressed by resupply with a N source (CITATION). NRT2.1 expression increases only transiently after the onset of N starvation, and a resupply of NO3– induces NRT2.1 expression (CITATION). We analyzed the expression of NRT2.4 in comparison to NRT2.1 in response to N supply in our experimental system using young seedlings grown in 10 mM NO3– (full N) for 7 d and then transferred to different N sources (10 mM NO3– or 10 mM ammonium) or to medium without N for 3 d. Compared with the NO3–-replete control where NRT2.4 was expressed at low levels only in roots, NRT2.4 expression in roots increased 12-fold under N starvation and became detectable in shoots (Figure 1A). No induction of NRT2.4 expression was observed under phosphate- or sulfate-starved conditions, indicating that the expression is not responding to general nutrient deficiency stress (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). After transfer to ammonium (NH4+), NRT2.4 expression was decreased (Figure 1A). This expression profile was different from that of NRT2.1 (Figure 1B). NRT2.1 was also mainly expressed in roots (Figure 1B), but NRT2.1 expression was high on NO3–91% lower on NH4+, and not significantly changed under starvation conditions compared with NO3–. NRT2.4 expression decreased steadily with increased NO3– concentration in the medium (decreased 98% between 0 and 10 mM NO3–see Supplemental Figure 1A online), whereas NRT2.1 expression decreased only 70% between 0 and 10 mM NO3–was unchanged between 0.1 and 1 mM NO3– supplies (see Supplemental Figure 1C online). However, NH4+ repression of NRT2.4 and NRT2.1 occurred at a similar concentration for both genes (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1D online). [[FIGURE]] Given the increased expression of NRT2.4 in N-depleted roots, we followed the time course patterns of NRT2.4 and NRT2.1 expression during N starvation. Seven-day-old seedlings were transferred from full N medium to either N-free or full N medium, and samples were taken after 0, 1, 3, and 5 d of transfer for gene expression studies and NO3– measurements. NO3– content decreased rapidly after transfer to N free medium, attaining 15 and 53% in roots and shoots, respectively, after 24 h, and then dropped to barely detectable levels at 3 and 5 d, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). After transfer to N-free medium, NRT2.4 expression increased until day 3 and stayed high afterwards (Figure 1C). NRT2.1 expression increased at day 1 but decreased again and stayed at a slightly higher level than at day 0. The latter might be due to a general slight increase in NRT2.1 expression with developmental age as a similar time-dependent pattern was observed for expression of the same gene on full N medium. We also confirmed the induction of NRT2.4 expression by N starvation on older plants grown in hydroponic culture (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). Similar to the expression pattern in seedlings, the transfer of 35-d-old plants grown on 6 mM NO3– solution to a solution without N rapidly induced expression of NRT2.4, reaching a plateau after 2 d of starvation. In these hydroponically grown plants, we confirmed earlier data showing that NRT2.4 expression decreases when N was resupplied to N-starved plants (CITATION, see Supplemental Figure 3B online), which was opposite to the expression response of NRT2.1, whose expression was induced specifically by NO3– after starvation (CITATION; see Supplemental Figure 3B online). NRT2.4 expression was lower than that for NRT2.1 in all the tested conditions (at least 99% lower under ample NO3– nutrition and 80% lower even in N starvation; Figure 1). This very specific NRT2.4 expression profile might be an indication of a distinct but complementary function for NRT2.4 in comparison to NRT2.1. We further characterized the localization of NRT2.4 expression in comparison to NRT2.1 using fusions between either the NRT2.4 or the NRT2.1 promoter and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. These constructs were stably introduced into the Arabidopsis Columbia (Col-0) accession, and two individual transgenic lines were each studied. Figure 2 shows typical results of GFP fluorescence of one of these transformants growing either under N starvation or with full N supply. ProNRT2.4:GFP fluorescence was observed only under N starvation in laterals and in the younger parts of the primary root, but not in the older parts of the main root (Figures 2A to 2D). Under the same conditions ProNRT2.1:GFP fluorescence was observed in the older part of the main root of plants grown in full N and in the main root and at lower level in the laterals of N starved plants (Figures 2E to 2H). The preferential expression of NRT2.1 in older parts of the main root confirms previously reported results (CITATION). We also confirmed the above-described NO3– dose-dependent expression of NRT2.4 (see Supplemental Figure 1 online) using the ProNRT2.4:GFP construct (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). [[FIGURE]] Expression studies using quantitative RT-PCR showed very low NRT2.4 expression in shoots (Figure 1), but no ProNRT2.4:GFP fluorescence was observed in shoots. Therefore, we further characterized the expression of NRT2.4 using a fusion between the NRT2.4 promoter and the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, which is more sensitive than GFP (CITATION). This construct was again stably introduced into the Arabidopsis Col-0 plants, and two individual transgenic lines were studied. Figure 3 shows typical results from GUS staining of one of these transformants grown under N starvation. Confirming GFP results (Figure 2), GUS staining was observed chiefly in lateral roots (Figure 3A). In cross sections near the division zone (Figure 3B) and in longitudinal sections (Figure 3C), NRT2.4 promoter activity was observed mainly in the epidermis of lateral roots. In shoots, GUS staining was restricted to the vascular tissue. NRT2.4 promoter activity was observed mainly in the primary vein and sometimes in secondary veins (Figure 3D). The same localization was observed in flower stalks (Figure 3E). Staining cell walls with propidium iodide allowed the localization of GUS expression to or close to the phloem, probably to the phloem parenchyma (Figures 3F to 3I). [[FIGURE]] This expression pattern was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from veins and leaf blades of adult plants grown either under full N or in N starvation. Despite very low expression levels, a significant increase of NRT2.4 expression was observed in veins of N-starved plants compared with plants grown on full N (Figure 3J). The biological function of transporters depends highly on their subcellular localization. Therefore, a C-terminal translational fusion of GFP to NRT2.4 under the control of the NRT2.4 promoter (ProNRT2.4:NRT2.4-GFP) was introduced into Arabidopsis Col-0 plants, and confocal microscopy analyses were performed on homozygous lines. In the root epidermal cells under N deprivation, green fluorescence was detected in the plasma membrane (Figures 4A and 4D). This localization was confirmed by staining lipid membranes using the red fluorescent probe FM4-64 (Figures 4B and 4E) and by merging the two pictures (Figures 4C and 4F), indicating that NRT2.4 was located at the plasma membrane. The NRT2.4-GFP protein was predominantly found in the external (abaxial) membrane of the epidermal cells facing the nutrient solution. This polar localization was further visualized by a cross section (Figure 4G). [[FIGURE]] To evaluate the capacity of the NRT2.4 protein to transport NO3–we introduced the NRT2.4 cDNA driven by the root-specific RolD promoter (CITATION) into the nrt2.1-1 mutant background. The nrt2.1-1 mutant is largely defective for high-affinity NO3– uptake as both NRT2.1 and NRT2.2 are not functional in this mutant (CITATION). In addition, we used RolD:NRT2.1-overexpressing mutant lines as a control. Homozygous transgenic plants (two independent lines each) were grown for 6 weeks in a hydroponic system on 0.2 mM NO3–. Root NO3– influx was measured at an external concentration of 0.2 mM using 15NO3– (atom% 15N: 99%). At this concentration, the difference in the HATS activity between the wild type and the nrt2.1-1 mutant was largest (CITATION). The overexpression of the two genes (NRT2.4 or NRT2.1) was correlated with an increase in the root 15NO3– influx (Figure 5A). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed that this increase in NO3– influx in the overexpressors was not due to compensation by altered expression of other genes of the NRT1 or NRT2 family (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Increased NO3– acquisition in the nrt2.1-1 mutant plants complemented by either NRT2.1 or NRT2.4 can also be deduced from the increased NO3– content in shoots and the increased shoot biomass in these transgenic lines compared with the nrt2.1-1 mutant (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). [[FIGURE]] To confirm that NRT2.4 is able to transport NO3–we used a heterologous expression system. Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with either NRT2.4 mRNA or nuclease-free water. After 3 d, oocytes were incubated in a solution enriched with 0.2 mM Na15NO3–and the 15N enrichment of individual oocytes was measured after 16 h. These measurements showed that NRT2.4 mRNA–injected oocytes took up significantly more NO3– than water-injected controls (Figure 5B). In addition, as NRT2.1 transport activity was dependent on coexpression with NAR2.1 (CITATION), we tested NO3– uptake in oocytes by not only injecting NRT2.4 mRNA alone, but also together with NAR2.1 mRNA. NRT2.4-driven NO3– enrichment was independent of the presence of NAR2.1 (Figure 5B). To investigate the in planta function of NRT2.4, two knockout mutants were characterized. nrt2.4-1 corresponds to a T-DNA insertion line in the Col-0 background (MDL-ArBrAr-125; CITATION). The insertion of the T-DNA in the last exon of the NRT2.4 gene (position 2289 from the ATG) led to a deletion of 23 bp (cf. AJ506341 and AJ506342). nrt2.4-2 was obtained from the Syngenta Arabidopsis Insertion Library (SAIL) T-DNA insertion line collection (SAIL_205_F02, stock CS872100). T-DNA insertion occurred in the third exon. No expression of NRT2.4 could be detected by RT-PCR for either mutant (see Supplemental Figures 6A and 6B online). Neither mutant showed an obvious morphological or physiological phenotype in our growth conditions either under ample NO3– or under N starvation (see Supplemental Figures 6C and 6D online). We measured NO3– influx on nrt2.4-1 and nrt2.4-2 mutant seedlings that had been grown first for 7 d on full N medium and were then transferred for 5 d on medium without N. Under these conditions, NRT2.4 expression was maximal in the wild type (Figure 1C). We used 15NO3– concentrations from 6 to 0.01 mM and found no differences in NO3– influx between the wild type and mutants for 6, 0.5, and 0.2 mM NO3– (see Supplemental Figure 7A online). However, when supplying very low NO3– concentrations, a significant decrease in NO3– influx (up to 30% less influx) was observed at both 0.025 and 0.01 mM external NO3– in both mutant lines (Figure 6). Similar data have been obtained measuring NO3– depletion from the medium when plants were incubated for 2 h in 0.2 and 0.01 mM NO3– solution (see Supplemental Figure 7B online). [[FIGURE]] Our data show that N-starved nrt2.4 null mutants are impaired in NO3– uptake at very low NO3– concentrations, suggesting that NRT2.4 is a NO3– transporter operating in the very-high-affinity range. It has been shown previously that the influx capacity of the nrt2.1 nrt2.2 double mutants (called nrt2.1-1 in Wassilewskija [Ws] and nrt2.1-2 in Col-0) at low NO3– concentration was decreased, but not zero (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We therefore generated triple null mutants that are deficient for the three root high-affinity NO3– transporters NRT2.1, NRT2.2, and NRT2.4. We analyzed the fresh weight of the triple mutants nrt2.1-2 2.4-1 and nrt2.1-2 2.4-2 in comparison to the double mutant nrt2.1-2, the single mutants nrt2.4-1 and nrt2.4-2, and the wild type when grown on agar plates containing different KNO3 concentrations (0.5 and 0.05 mM). No difference in fresh weight was observed for the single mutants compared with the wild type. As expected, fresh weight of the double mutant nrt2.1-2 was lower than that of the wild type under all conditions tested. Comparing triple and double mutants, fresh weight was similar on 0.5 mM NO3– but significantly decreased for the triple mutants grown on 0.05 mM KNO3 agar plates (Figures 7A to 7C). [[FIGURE]] We then measured very-high-affinity NO3– influx on double and triple mutants that had been grown first for 8 d on full N medium and were then transferred for 5 d to medium without N. Indeed, NO3– influx was decreased in the triple mutants compared with the double mutant when measured in the presence of 0.025 or 0.01 mM external 15NO3– (Figure 7D), suggesting that the growth phenotype of triple mutant is attributed to reduced NO3– influx. Although only the triple knockout of NRT2.1, NRT2.2, and NRT2.4, but not the single mutant nrt2.4 (Figures 7A to 7C), revealed a growth phenotype on low external NO3–this result demonstrates a role of NRT2.4 in sustaining plant growth at low N availability. Since NRT2.4 is expressed in or close to the phloem of leaves, the amount of NO3– in the phloem sap in the wild type and the mutants was compared. Plants were grown on sand in short days for 6 weeks on full N and then N starved for a further 4 weeks. At that time, the plants had been severely starved but were not yet flowering. NO3– levels in the phloem exudates of mature leaves were decreased by 45 and 47% in the nrt2.4-1 and nrt2.4-2 mutants, respectively, compared with the wild type (Figure 8A). However, the levels of amino acids in the phloem exudates were similar between the wild type and mutants (Figure 8B), suggesting that the rate of exudation is comparable between the wild type and mutants and that the effect was specific to NO3–. Furthermore, whole-leaf NO3– levels were unchanged in the nrt2.4 mutants compared with the wild type (Figure 8C). The decrease in NO3– content in phloem exudate was only observed when plants were cultivated under N starvation conditions. Phloem exudate NO3– levels were similar for the wild type and mutants when plants were grown on ample NO3– (see Supplemental Figure 8 online). The expression of NRT1.7, the only other known NO3– transporter involved in shoot phloem NO3– content, was not changed between the wild type and mutants (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). [[FIGURE]] This result is in agreement with the expression of NRT2.4 in veins (Figure 3D to 3I) and suggests a high-affinity scavenging role for NRT2.4 in NO3– remobilization during N starvation, in contrast with NRT1.7, which is involved in NO3– remobilization in the low-affinity range (CITATION).
!~MM~! The SAIL line CS872100 (nrt2.4-2) was obtained from the ABRC and was derived from a T-DNA–mutagenized population of the Col-0 accession (CITATION), while the nrt2.4-1 line was derived from a T-DNA–mutagenized population of the Col-0 accession (CITATION). Homozygous mutant plants were isolated by PCR with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The nrt2.1 nrt2.2 double mutant (Col-0 accession, called nrt2.1-2) was obtained from the stock center (SALK_035429) and was characterized previously (CITATION; CITATION). Another nrt2.1 nrt2.2 double mutant (Ws accession, called nrt2.1-1) was obtained initially from the Versailles T-DNA insertion line collection (FLAG lines) and was characterized previously (CITATION). Triple null mutants were generated by crosses of the double mutant nrt2.1 nrt2.2 (nrt2.1-2) and the two nrt2.4 alleles (nrt2.4-1 and nrt2.4-2). The F1 seeds were grown and allowed to self-fertilize to produce a population of F2 plants. We determined the genotypes of the F2 plants by genomic PCR for NRT2.1, NRT2.2, and NRT2.4 (primers are given in Supplemental Table 2 online). For studies on seedlings, wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Col-0 or Ws) as well as mutants or transgenic plants were grown on Molecular Genetics Research Laboratory (University of Tokyo) growth medium (MGRL)–based vertical agar plates (Naito et al., 1994) containing 1% Suc in 100 μmol m−2 s−1 fluorescent light in a long-day condition (16 h light/8 h dark). The full N MGRL plate (full N plate) contained 10 mM NO3–and MGRL plates with other N contents are indicated in the figures. For N-limiting conditions, the ion equilibrium of the medium was ensured by replacing KNO3 and CaNO3 by CaCl2 and KCl. For GUS expression, seedlings were grown in vitro on a medium containing either 0 or 10 mM NO3– (CITATION). Adult plants were grown either under hydroponic conditions in a Sanyo growth chamber (SGC660/PL4) or on sand culture in a Seitha growth chamber with an 8-h-light/16-h-dark cycle at 21°C/17°C, respectively, 80% relative humidity, and 150 μmol m–2 s–1 irradiation. Seeds were stratified for 5 d at 4°C in the dark in a 0.15% agar solution in water and then sown and cultivated as already described (CITATION; CITATION). The nutrient solutions contained 6 mM NO3– as full N for hydroponic culture and 10 mM NO3– for full N for sand culture. For N starvation conditions, ion equilibrium of the medium was ensured by replacing KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 by KCl and CaSO4. RNA was extracted with the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA kit from Sigma-Aldrich, modified by adding a DNase step, which was performed with the Qiagen RNase-free DNase kit (according the protocols of the supplier), RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen), or Trizol method (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized according to CITATION using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15 primers (Promega) or using the SuperScript III Fast strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). PCR was performed on a LightCycler instrument (Roche), StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), or on a Realplex Mastercycler (Eppendorf) with the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche) or SYBR Premix ExTaq II (Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each reaction was performed on a 1:20 dilution of the first cDNA strands, synthesized as described above, in a total reaction of 20 μL. With this dilution, the SYBR green signal was linear. Specific primer sets are given in Supplemental Table 2 online. The full-length NRT2.4 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNAs extracted from Arabidopsis roots (accession Ws) using the start primer ATG-NRT2.4, the stop primer STOP-NRT2.4 (see Supplemental Table 2 online), and the high-fidelity Taq enzyme (Roche) and were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The nucleotide sequence of the insert was checked before transferring the cDNA first into the pRT103 vector (Töpfer et al., 1987) downstream from the RolD promoter, followed by cloning of this whole chimeric gene into a pGREEN vector (Hellens et al., 2000) already containing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S terminator. The full-length NRT2.1 cDNA was amplified from a cDNA clone (CITATION) using the start primer ATG-NRT2.1, the stop primer STOP-NRT2.1 (see Supplemental Table 2 online), and the subsequent procedures as for NRT2.4. Binary vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 (pMP90). The nrt2.1-1 mutant (CITATION) was transformed by the in planta method using the surfactant Silwet L-77. Transgenic plants were selected on Estelle and Sommerville media (CITATION) containing 20 μg L–1 of hygromycin B. Influx of 15NO3– was assayed as previously described (CITATION). The plants were transferred first to 0.1 mM CaSO4 for 1 min and then to complete nutrient solution containing 15NO3– (atom% 15N: 99%) at the indicated concentrations for 5 min and finally to 0.1 mM CaSO4 for 1 min The roots were dried for 72 h at 80°C and analyzed using the ANCA-MS system (PDZ Europa). Influx of 15NO3– was calculated from the total N and 15N content of the roots. NO3– depletion assays were conducted as by CITATION with some modifications. Wild-type (Col-0) and nrt2.4-2 seedlings were grown on MGRL plates containing 10 mM NH4NO3 for 7 d and then transferred to MGRL plates without a N source. On the fifth day, ~30 seedlings (0.2 g fresh weight) were washed twice with MGRL medium without N and suspended in 100 mL of MGRL solution with 0.2 mM NO3– or in 10 mL of MGRL solution with 0.01 mM NO3– in a flask. The flasks were rotated at 100 rpm under 100 μmol m–2 s–1 irradiation, and the assay media were collected at the indicated time points up to 2 h. The amount of NO3– left in the assay medium was determined by HPLC (Waters 2695 separation module and Waters 2996 photodiode array detector) using an anion exchange column (Waters Spherisorb S5 SAX). The mobile phase was pumped at a rate of 1 mL/min and consisted of 50 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 3.7. The pGEM-T Easy vector containing the full-length NRT2.4 cDNA was fully digested with NotI. The cDNA fragment was blunt-ended using the Klenow enzyme, dephosphorylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and then subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pT7TS expression vector containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus β-globin gene (Cleaver et al., 1996). For in vitro synthesis of mRNA, the pT7TS clone was linearized by digestion with XbaI for NRT2.4 or with BamHI for NAR2.1. Synthesis of capped full-length mRNAs and Xenopus oocyte preparation were performed as previously described (CITATION). Healthy oocytes at stage V or VI were injected with 50 nL of water (nuclease free), NRT2.4 mRNAs at 1 μg·μL–1, or a mixture of NAR2.1 (CITATION) and NRT2.4 mRNA at 1 μg·μL–1 each. After 3 d incubation at 18°C, 5 to 10 oocytes were incubated in 3 mL of ND96 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES), pH 6.5, enriched with 0.5 mM Na15NO3 (atom% 15N: 98%) during 16 h at 18°C. The oocytes were then thoroughly washed four times with ice-cooled 0.5 mM NaNO3 ND96 solution and dried at 60°C. The 15N/14N ratio of the single dried oocyte was measured as previously described (CITATION). The values are means ± sd of five replicates; results from a representative experiment are shown. Approximately 1.2 kb of DNA immediately 5′ of the ATG start codon of the NRT2.4 gene was amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene Europe) and gene-specific primers (5′ProNRT2.4 and 3′ProNRT2.4; see Supplemental Table 2 online). PCR products were cloned into pZeroblunt (Stratagene), sequenced, and subcloned into pBI101 (Clontech Laboratories). The binary vector was transformed into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 pMP90 via electroporation (CITATION). Transformants were selected on yeast extract and beef plates containing rifampicin (100 μg L–1), gentamycin (20 μg L–1), and kanamycin (50 μg L–1) and confirmed positive via restriction digest of the recovered plasmid. Arabidopsis was transformed using the floral dip method as described by CITATION. Transgenic seedlings were recovered on Murashige and Skoog plates containing 1% Suc and 50 μg L–1 kanamycin. Histochemical GUS staining was performed according to the method described by CITATION with some modifications. Plants were vacuum infiltrated for 5 min in a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (0.05% Triton, 2 mM ferro/ferricyanide, and 2 mM X-glucuronide). Subsequently, samples were incubated overnight in the dark at 37°C. Stained plants were cleared by incubation in an ethanol series (70 to 100% [v/v]) and then observed under a light microscope (Axioplan 2; Zeiss). For sections, tissue was fixed in formaldehyde (4%). After dehydration in an ethanol series, tissue was embedded in Historesine (Kit Technovit 7100; Labonord). Eight-micrometer cuts were produced with a microtome (EICA JUNG RM 2055). Propidium iodide staining was performed as by CITATION. The fluorescence was recorded at 600 nm (excitation 488 nm) for the propidium iodide staining of cell walls and the reflection between 485 and 491 nm visualized the GUS staining (confocal microscope; Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS) The NRT2.4 promoter (ProNRT2.4; 1886 bp upstream of the inferred initiation codon), NRT2.1 promoter (ProNRT2.1; 1974 bp upstream), and GFP fragments were amplified with KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) and specific primers (pNRT2.4-F and pNRT2.4-R for ProNRT2.4 and pNRT2.1-F and pNRT2.1-R for ProNRT2.1; see Supplemental Table 2 online), and assembled in the pBA002a binary vector (CITATION) to generate ProNRT2.4:GFP and ProNRT2.1:GFP. A genomic fragment encompassing NRT2.4 promoter and NRT2.4 coding region (without a stop codon) was amplified using PrimeStar GXL DNA polymerase and specific primers (pNRT2.4-F and NRT2.4-R; see Supplemental Table 2 online). The fragment was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced, then integrated into the Gateway binary vector pBA002a-GFP, which is a derivative of pBA002a (CITATION), to generate C-terminal GFP fusion construct (ProNRT2.4:NRT2.4-GFP), using LR clonase (Invitrogen). These constructs were transferred into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (pMP90), and positive colonies were confirmed by PCR. Wild-type (Col-0) plants were transformed with the floral dip method as described (CITATION), and transformants were selected on Murashige and Skoog plates (1% Suc) containing 10 μg L–1 bialaphos sodium salt. GFP fluorescence and chlorophyll autofluorescence were visualized using the FluorImager 595 (Molecular Dynamics). GFP signal was obtained under 488-nm excitation using a 530DF30 filter. Chlorophyll autofluorescence of plants was detected under 488-nm excitation using a 610RG filter. Transgenic seedlings grown on full N MGRL medium for 7 d and then transferred for 3 d on medium without N were observed with the Zeiss LSM510 META confocal imaging system. Cells in living roots were stained with 0.1 μg/mL of FM4-64 for 5 min before observation (Molecular Probes). The different fluorochromes were detected using laser lines 488 nm (Alexa 488, GFP, and FM4-64) and 543 nm (Alexa 568). The images were coded green (fluorescent isothiocyanate and GFP) and red (Alexa 568 and FM4-64), giving yellow colocalization in merged images. The samples were washed twice after staining before observation with the confocal microscope. Each image shown represents a single focal plane. Mature leaves of 10-week-old plants were cut at the base with a sharp razor blade at the petiole with a drop of overlaying solution to avoid allowing air to enter the vascular tissue. The petiole was recut, covered by the solution, and then four leaves were placed with the petiole in a tube containing 800 μL solution (5 mM EDTA, pH8.5). After 16 h in a water-saturated atmosphere, the phloem exudate–enriched solution was collected and the leaf fresh weight was measured. Free Glc content in the phloem exudates was below the detection limit (30 nmol/g fresh weight), indicating that contamination by damaged cell extract in the exudates was low. Leaves from independent plants were used for measuring total leaf NO3– content. NO3– content in plants grown on agar plates was measured as by CITATION with some modifications. Plants were separated into roots and shoots, weighed, and collected in tubes. One milliliter of milli-Q water was added to each tube, boiled for 20 min, and frozen at −80°C overnight. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to NO3– quantification by HPLC system as described in the method of NO3– depletion assay. The NO3– content for plants grown on soil or in hydroponic culture was measured in ethanolic extracts as by CITATION using Dionex HPLC measurement. N NO3– concentration in phloem exudates was measured using a modified Miranda method (CITATION; CITATION) using an appropriate EDTA concentration as blank. Glc and Suc content was measured using a standard NADPH-coupled assay for soluble sugar measurements (CITATION). Total amino acid content was measured using Ninhydrine methods as by CITATION. Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers for genes mentioned in this article are as follows: At5g60770 (NRT2.4), At1g08090 (NRT2.1), At1g08100 (NRT2.2), At5g60390 (EF1α), At1g12940 (NRT2.5), At3g45060 (NRT2.6), At5g14570 (NRT2.7), At1g12110 (NRT1.1), At1g69870 (NRT1.7), At5g50200 (NAR2.1); RolD (Agrobacterium rhizogenes) GenBank accession number X64255.1; Germplasm, SAIL_205_F02 line CS872100 (nrt2.4-2), MDL-ArBrAr-125 (nrt2.4-1), SALK_035429 (nrt2.1 nrt2.2 double mutant in Col-0), and FLAG line EDP03 (nrt2.1 nrt2.2 double mutant in Ws).
