!~ABS~! Flowering plant reproduction requires precise delivery of the sperm cells to the ovule by a pollen tube. Guidance signals from female cells are being identified; however, how pollen responds to those cues is largely unknown. Here, we show that two predicted cation/proton exchangers (CHX) in Arabidopsis thaliana, CHX21 and CHX23, are essential for pollen tube guidance. Male fertility was unchanged in single chx21 or chx23 mutants. However, fertility was impaired in chx21 chx23 double mutant pollen. Wild-type pistils pollinated with a limited number of single and double mutant pollen producing 62% fewer seeds than those pollinated with chx23 single mutant pollen, indicating that chx21 chx23 pollen is severely compromised. Double mutant pollen grains germinated and grew tubes down the transmitting tract, but the tubes failed to turn toward ovules. Furthermore, chx21 chx23 pollen tubes failed to enter the micropyle of excised ovules. Green fluorescent protein–tagged CHX23 driven by its native promoter was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of pollen tubes. CHX23 mediated K+ transport, as CHX23 expression in Escherichia coli increased K+ uptake and growth in a pH-dependent manner. We propose that by modifying localized cation balance and pH, these transporters could affect steps in signal reception and/or transduction that are critical to shifting the axis of polarity and directing pollen growth toward the ovule.
!~RES~! To test whether CHX genes expressed in pollen had a role in tube growth, homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants of CHX21 and CHX23 were first identified by PCR. Total RNA was extracted from pollen and seedlings and reverse transcribed. Using three sets of primer pairs (Figure 1A), CHX23 transcripts were detected specifically in pollen, but not in the seedlings of wild-type plants (Figure 1B). However, the chx23-4 mutant contained a truncated transcript corresponding to a sequence upstream of the T-DNA insertion. No transcripts were detected using primer pairs corresponding to regions spanning or downstream of the T-DNA insertion site (Figure 1B). The T-DNA is inserted in a region encoding transmembrane 9; thus, if transcribed, a protein lacking transmembrane span 10, 11, and 12 is probably not active. In wild-type plants, CHX21 transcripts were detected in RNA preparations of both seedlings and pollen. However, there were no full-length transcripts in seedlings or from pollen of either the chx21-2 (SALK) or chx21-s1 (SAIL) mutant (Figures 1B and 1C). Partial transcripts corresponding to a region upstream of the T-DNA were also detected for chx21-2 and chx21-s1. chx21-s1 is unlikely to produce a functional protein as the T-DNA interrupted a region upstream of transmembrane region 3. However, it is possible that protein produced from the chx21-2 allele could be active, as the 12 transmembrane regions would be intact. It is unclear whether a T-DNA insertion at the hydrophilic region at the C tail would interfere with CHX21-2 activity. Therefore, we conclude that chx21-s1 and chx23-4 are likely null alleles. Although the effect of the chx21-2 allele was less certain, subsequent analysis of mutants demonstrated that it is a null mutant. [[FIGURE]] We analyzed the segregation of progeny from self-fertilized chx21-s1+/− mutants, which harbored a BASTA resistance cassette in the T-DNA insertion. The progeny yielded BASTA-resistant to BASTA-sensitive seedlings at a predicted ratio of 3:1 (Table 1, experiment i). Self-fertilization of the plant chx23-4+/− produced seedlings with the following phenotype: 34 wild-type, 43 heterozygous, and 28 homozygous for chx23-4. This is near the expected ratio of 1:2:1 (Table 1, experiment i). These results indicated that pollen carrying a single mutation in either chx21-s1 or chx23-4 was functional and fertile. Furthermore, in vitro–germinated pollen from single mutant chx21-2 or chx23-4 showed tube lengths of 372 ± 7 or 364 ± 9 μm respectively, similar to the wild-type tube length of 350 ± 10 μm at 6 h. Thus, pollen carrying a mutation in either CHX21 or CHX23 showed no defect in male fertility. Disruption of Both CHX21 and CHX23 Genes Causes Defective Male-Specific Gene Transmission Bioinformatic analyses indicated that CHX21 and CHX23 resembled products of a gene duplication. The two genes are located on chromosomes I and II in regions that underwent segmental duplication (CITATION), and their coding sequences are interrupted by two introns located at identical (or conserved) sites of the coding region, although CHX23 has an extra intron (Figure 1A). The N-terminal region of both proteins is predicted to have 12 transmembrane spans, which share 70% identity (see Supplemental Figure 1 online), and the C-terminal hydrophilic regions are 68% identical. To test whether CHX21 and CHX23 are functionally redundant, we investigated gene segregation in double mutants. First, we identified plants that were chx21-2+/− chx23-4−/−then examined their descendants after self-fertilization. Instead of the expected population of CHX21+/+ chx23−/−, chx21+/− chx23−/−, and chx21−/− chx23−/− at a ratio of 1:2:1, the observed result was close to 1:1:0 (Table 1, experiment ii). Similarly, the progeny of self-fertilized chx21-2−/− chx23-4+/− showed segregation distortion. No double homozygous mutants were recovered in either experiment. The results indicated a defect in one or both gametophyte(s). To clarify whether the defect was due to male or female transmission, reciprocal crosses with the wild-type plant were made. When chx21-2−/− chx23-4+/− pistils were hand-pollinated with wild-type pollen, the progeny produced the genotypes chx21+/− CHX23+/+ and chx21+/− chx23+/− at a ratio of 1:1. However, when pistils of a male-sterile wild-type plant (designated as Wti) were pollinated with pollen from the chx21-2−/− chx23-4+/− mutant, nearly all of the progeny produced was the single heterozygous chx21-2 mutant (chx21-2+/- CHX23+/+). Mutant plants heterozygous for both genes (chx21+/− chx23+/−) were rarely encountered (0.8%) (Table 1, experiment iii-a). Wti flowers cannot self-fertilize as they are male impotent (CITATION). Similarly, when Wti pistils were pollinated with pollen from the mutant chx21+/− chx23-4−/−, 98% of the progeny were single heterozygous chx23-4 mutants (CHX21+/+ chx23-4+/−) (Table 1, experiment iii-b). Thus, gene transmission through double mutant pollen is severely compromised. As a mixture of single mutant and double mutant pollen are produced from either chx21-2−/− chx23-4+/− or chx21+/− chx23-4−/− plants, the genotypes of the surviving progeny indicated that pollen defective in either CHX21 or CHX23 is functional, while the pollen defective in both is not. Therefore, CHX21 and CHX23 have redundant but essential functions in pollen. We examined whether a wild-type copy of CHX23 could restore fertility to double mutant pollen. chx21-2+/− chx23-4−/− plants were transformed with a construct that included the native CHX23 promoter, and the CHX23 open reading frame (without the stop codon) fused at its 3′-end to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. T1 plants carrying the transgene were identified. In the T2 generation, 23 chx21−/− chx23−/− double homozygotes out of 114 total plants were obtained. Twenty-eight of the remaining T2 plants were wild type for CHX21, and 63 were heterozygous for CHX21. These results indicated that wild-type CHX23 alone was able to restore function to double mutant pollen (Table 1, experiment iv). We concluded that the distorted gene segregation was indeed caused by mutations in CHX21 and CHX23. To test whether a loss in male function in chx21 chx23 double mutant pollen could be due to defective pollen development, grains were examined by microscopy. Pollen grains were collected from stage 13 chx21-2+/− chx23−/− flowers. This plant is expected to produce equal numbers of single and double mutant pollen. All the pollen grains were comparable to wild-type grains, as they contained three nuclei, as shown by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (see Supplemental Figure 2A online), and the grains turned purple after Alexander staining (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). Thus, both single and double mutant pollen were viable and apparently had undergone normal pollen development. It is possible that the single mutant pollen (chx21-2 or chx23-4) would have a competitive advantage over double mutant pollen (chx21-2 chx23-4) in delivering the sperm to the ovule and that any growth of the double mutant pollen does not manifest due to excessive pollination. To test this possibility, one pistil of a Wti flower containing ~50 ovules was given a limited number (e.g., 35) of pollen grains. If chx21-2 chx23-4 double mutant pollen is retarded in growth but still fertilization competent, pollinating a Wti pistil with a mixture of chx21-2 single and chx21-2 chx23-4 double mutant pollen (Figure 2A, left) would yield a similar amount of seeds as Wti pistils pollinated by single mutant chx21-2 pollen alone (Figure 2A, right). Seven days after pollination, the seedpods were visibly long, and ~24 mature seeds per pod were recovered in flowers pollinated with single mutant pollen (Figures 2B to 2D). By contrast, seedpods were small and contained approximately nine seeds per pod when pistils were pollinated with the same limited number (35) of pollen grains containing a mixture of single and double mutants (Figures 2B to 2D). Despite ovules being in excess of pollen, a reduction of seed set using a mixture of single and double mutant pollen suggested that chx21-2 chx23-4 double mutant pollen was not merely slow or less competitive than single mutant pollen but that it was infertile. [[FIGURE]] We next tested if the double mutant pollen might be impaired in germination or tube growth in vivo. After limited pollination using 38 pollen grains, the length and number of pollen tubes within the transmitting tract were examined 6 h after pollination (HAP) with aniline blue staining. The number of pollen tubes at a position 0.6 mm below the stigma (top) was 21 or 20 in single mutant or a mixture of single and double mutant pollen, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Furthermore, the lengths of the pollen tubes were similar for the single and double mutant pollen based on the number of tubes (10) reaching the middle of the carpel 6 HAP. These results suggested that in vivo germination and tube elongation of chx21-2 chx23-4 double mutant pollen is comparable to that of single mutant pollen. A major challenge in studying the function of double mutant pollen from the chx21+/− chx23-4−/− parent is the inability to separate the mixed population of male gametophytes with two genotypes in vivo. To help distinguish the double mutant pollen from single mutant pollen, we generated a new mutant heterozygous for chx21-s1 and homozygous for chx23-4. chx21-s1 harbors a T-DNA that contains the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under the control of the pollen-specific LAT52 promoter (CITATION). Thus, pollen carrying chx21-s1 chx23-4 can be distinguished from CHX21 chx23-4 after staining for GUS activity (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). The mutant was generated by crossing homozygous chx21-s1 with homozygous chx23-4 plants. The F1 plant chx21-s1+/− chx23-4+/− was selfed, and chx21-s1+/− chx23-4−/− progeny were identified by BASTA resistance and PCR (see Supplemental Figure 4B online). chx21-s1 single mutant pollen and a mixture of chx21-s1 single and chx21-s1 chx23-4 double mutant pollen were then tested for in vivo tube growth in Wti pistils. At 6 or 24 HAP, the ovary was excised to remove the carpel wall and then stained for GUS activity (see Supplemental Figure 4C online). At 6 HAP, wild-type pollen from plants expressing Lat52 promoter:GUS (WtGUS) had extended tubes more than half way in the transmitting tract (Figure 3A, i). Furthermore, the ovules located in the top half of the ovary turned blue. This indicates that the soluble GUS protein had been discharged along with sperm cells by the pollen tube at the ovule (CITATION). Pollen from the chx21-s1 single mutant was similar (Figure 3A, ii) to that from WtGUS pollen. By 24 HAP, tubes had reached the bottom of the transmitting tract and all the ovules in the lower half of the carpel contained some blue coloring (Figure 3B, i and ii). The turning of both wild-type and chx21-s1 single mutant pollen tubes at the funiculus and the presence of GUS activity inside all of the ovules is striking, indicating the discharge of pollen content into the embryo sacs (Figure 3C, i and ii). Pistils that were not pollinated showed no GUS activity in the transmitting tract or the ovules (Figure 3, iv). [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, we observed that the tubes of chx21-s1 chx23-4 double mutant pollen, which stained blue, were inside the transmitting tract and were as long or longer as those of wild-type tubes at 6 HAP (Figure 3A, iii). This result confirms the previous finding (see Supplemental Figure 3 online) that double mutant pollen was competent in germination and tube extension in vivo. The tubes reached the bottom of the transmitting tract by 24 HAP (Figure 3B, iii). Yet, strikingly, none of the ovules showed GUS activity. The tubes stayed inside the transmitting tract and failed to reorient their growth to enter the funiculus, which leads to the ovule (Figure 3C, iii). Thus, male infertility in chx21 chx23 double mutant pollen is due to a failure to shift the direction of pollen tip growth at the funiculus and to target the ovule, suggesting a failure in pollen tube guidance. We reasoned that the failure of double mutant pollen tubes to enter ovules could be a secondary consequence of defects experienced by pollen tubes in the ovarian transmitting tract. We tested this possibility by allowing double mutant pollen tubes to directly interact with ovules in a semi–in vivo assay (CITATION; CITATION). In this assay, we deployed a homogeneous population of double mutant pollen obtained from a rare chx21-s1−/− chx23−/− double mutant plant. The mutant showed signs of sterility among the progeny of self-fertilized chx21-s1+/− chx23-4−/− (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). Vegetative growth, bolting, and the inflorescence in this mutant were indistinguishable from those of wild-type plants (see Supplemental Figure 5Ai online); however, the siliques were reduced in size (see Supplemental Figure 5Aii online). Over 90% of the pods were barren, and 8% of the pods contained a single fully developed seed (see Supplemental Figure 5Aiii online). These seeds germinated and the plants developed vegetative growth and flowers normally; however, like the parent, they produced only five to seven seeds per plant. Wti pistils were pollinated with WtGUS or chx21-s1 chx23-4 pollen, and then the ovary was severed at a site just below the junction between the style and the ovary and placed on pollen tube growth medium for 6 h. Wild-type tubes emerging from the cut end of the ovary continued to grow on the medium and were competent to orient their growth toward the ovule (Figure 4A, i and iii). In 10 experiments, we found that 215 out of 235 total ovules were targeted by a blue WtGUS pollen tube (Figure 4B). Discharge of GUS into the ovule could be observed sometimes. However, when chx21 chx23 double mutant pollen (Figure 4A, ii and iv) was used, only 21 out of 183 ovules were targeted by GUS-stained tubes (Figure 4B). In addition, we noticed that untargeted ovules would float away, while targeted ovules stayed tethered to the tubes during enzyme reaction and buffer washes. Apparently, there is a tight physical association between the targeted ovule and the pollen tube. Thus, the attraction of pollen tubes to guidance cues from isolated ovules also depends on a functional CHX21 or CHX23. [[FIGURE]] To understand the cellular role of the predicted CHX23 ion transporter, GFP-tagged CHX23 driven by the pollen-specific promoter LAT52 (CITATION) was expressed in tobacco pollen after bombardment. We compared the fluorescent patterns of various markers (Figures 5A to 5G; see Supplemental Movie 1 online) with that of CHX23-GFP (Figure 5H; see Supplemental Movie 2 online) and found that the CHX23-GFP signal was similar to that of an ER membrane–bound protein, SIP2.1-GFP (CITATION) (Figure 5E), and an ER lumen protein, GFP-HDEL (Figure 5F; see Supplemental Movie 1 online). To verify this possibility, tobacco pollen was cotransfected with CHX23-RFP and SIP2.1-GFP or GFP-HDEL. Merged signals from the GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP) overlapped well in confocal images (Figure 5I, 5I”, 5J, and 5J”; see Supplemental Movie 3 online). Moreover, pollen from transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing CHX23-GFP driven by the CHX23 native promoter also showed a similar reticulate pattern (Figure 5K; see Supplemental Movie 4 online). Thus, CHX23 appears to be localized to the ER membrane in both transiently transfected tobacco pollen and stably transformed Arabidopsis pollen. Although most of the CHX23-GFP signal corresponded to reticulate ER, the possibility that active CHX23 is localized to specific ER domains and to dynamic endomembranes that interact with the ER at the pollen tube tip remains to be examined. [[FIGURE]] To test the predicted cation transport activity, a cDNA encoding CHX23 was cloned. We were unable to clone a full-length CHX21 cDNA that was not mutated. CHX21 cDNAs consistently contained either a base deletion or substitution that would produce a truncated or an altered protein. CHX23 cDNA was expressed in an Escherichia coli mutant (LB2003) that grows poorly on low K+ medium due to defects in three K+ uptake systems (CITATION). CHX23 expression enhanced bacterial growth on yeast-tryptone-mannitol (YTM) medium containing 4 mM K+ (Figure 6A). CHX23 restored growth, similar to KAT1, which encodes an inward-rectifying K+ channel (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). These results supported the idea that CHX23 has a role in K+ transport. Using [86Rb] as a tracer for K+, we demonstrated that CHX23 mediated K+ uptake (Figure 6C). CHX23-dependent 86Rb uptake was reduced by increasing the concentration of monovalent cations (Figure 6D). Our results suggest that CHX23 is a monovalent cation transporter with a preference for Cs+, K+, and Rb+ relative to Na+ or Li+. Rb+ or K+ (3 mM) supplementation of medium containing 1 mM K+ supported CHX23-dependent E. coli growth; however, Cs+ or Na+ supplementation did not. Thus, Rb+ can partially substitute for K+, whereas Cs+ or Na+ cannot. Therefore, K+ is the physiological substrate of CHX23. Interestingly, CHX23-enhanced cell growth was better at pH 6.2 to 6.6 than at pH 5.6 or 7.0 (Figure 6B), indicating that the transporter is pH sensitive. Although the specific mode of K+ transport is unclear, the results point to a potential role for CHX23 in regulating homeostasis of K+, H+, or both. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia-0), mutants, and transgenic plants (see Supplemental Table 1 online) were grown in Miracle-Gro potting soil (Scotts) under well-controlled environmental conditions at 21°C, 150 μE m−2 s−1 illumination for a 16-h photoperiod at 55% humidity. For growth on plates, seeds were surface sterilized, vernalized at 4°C for 2 days, and germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium under the same growth conditions as described above. To genotype wild-type and mutant plants, genomic DNA was isolated from 2-week-old seedlings. Gene-specific (LP and RP) and T-DNA primers (LBa1 or pCSA110-LB3) were used to identify wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutants by PCR (see Supplemental Table 2 online for primers). Segregation analysis of SALK mutants (chx21-2 and chx23-4) (CITATION) or out-crosses was performed by PCR-based genotyping. Segregation of SAIL mutants (chx21-s1+/−) was scored as Basta resistance (CITATION). Sterilized seeds were germinated on half-strength MS plates containing Basta (50 mg/L) for 2 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from mature Arabidopsis pollen, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers CHX23Cf and CHX23Cr (see Supplemental Table 2 online) were used to amplify CHX23 cDNA. Gel-purified PCR product was cloned into Gateway pECHX23 after the BP reaction with the pDONR221 vector (Invitrogen). Resulting clones were verified by sequencing. Compared with the predicted full-length cDNA, the cloned coding sequence lacked 24 bases at the 3′-end. Genomic CHX23, including the promoter region and the open reading frame, was PCR amplified using primers CHX23GCf and CHX23GCr with BAC clone (F3F20_3) as template. Gel-purified PCR product was cloned into pECHX23G after the BP reaction between the PCR product and the pDONR221 vector. Resulting clones were verified by sequencing. To express CHX23-GFP under its native promoter, genomic CHX23 was cloned into pMDC107-X23 after the LR recombination reaction between pECHX23G and pMDC107, which has a hygromycin-resistant marker. To localize CHX23 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen, pECHX23 was recombined into a vector that contained pollen-specific LAT52 promoter and GFP. Primers Lat52 Pf and Lat52 Pr (see Supplemental Table 2 online) were used in a PCR reaction to amplify the promoter region of the pollen-specific LAT52 gene (CITATION). The forward and reverse primers contain SacI and SpeI sites, respectively. Gel-purified PCR product and the Gateway destination vectors p2GWF7 and p2GWR7 were digested with SacI and SpeI, gel purified, and ligated, resulting in new vectors, pLatGWF7 and pLatGWR7, respectively. Insertion of the LAT52 promoter into the new vectors was confirmed by sequencing. After the LR recombination reaction between pECHX23 and the newly constructed LAT52-driven vectors, CHX23 cDNA was cloned into new vectors that were named pLatGWF7-X23 and pLatGWR7-X23, respectively. RNA expression was determined by RT-PCR of total RNA. Total RNA was isolated from seedlings or pollen of Arabidopsis plants using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, 2-week-old seedlings grown on half-strength MS plates and pollen from 6-week-old plants (CITATION) were used. Isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers (see Supplemental Table 2) were used for a 30-cycle PCR. Actin 11 (At3g12110) was amplified using Actin-S and Actin-AS primers to verify equivalent loading and to detect for possible contamination of genomic DNA. Amplified products were visualized by ethidium bromide fluorescence after electrophoresis on an agarose gel. Tobacco pollen was transfected by bombardment (CITATION). pLatGWF-X23 and pLatGWR-X23 plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit. For each bombardment, 1.25 μg DNA and 7 mg tobacco pollen were used. Pollen was transfected with NtPLIM2b-GFP (CITATION), GFP-Rab2 (CITATION), GFP-Rab5, mito-GFP, GFP-HDEL (CITATION), SIP2.1-GFP (CITATION; A. Cheung and H. Wu, unpublished data), and LAT52:GFP (CITATION) to visualize actin filament, Golgi, endosome, mitochondria, ER, and cytosol, respectively. After bombardment, pollen grains were cultured on medium containing 1 mM KNO3, 1.6 mM H3BO3, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 3 mM Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, 8% sucrose, 0.7% agarose, and 10 mM MES, pH 6.0. After a 4-h incubation, pollen tubes were observed by microscopy. Arabidopsis plants were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens using the floral dip method (CITATION). Agrobacterium strain GV3101 was transformed with the binary vector pMDC107-X23 via electroporation, and transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani plates with gentamicin (50 μg/mL) and kanamycin (50 μg/mL). For the molecular complementation, chx21-2+/−chx23-4−/− plants were transformed with the construct gCHX23-GFP in the pMDC107-X23 vector. Sixteen T1 transformants were selected by resistance on half-strength MS plates containing hygromycin (30 μg/mL). Two-week-old hygromycin-resistant plants were genotyped by PCR methods using gene-specific primers. Three chx21+/−chx23−/− transformants were self-fertilized, and the T2 population was selected on hygromycin-containing plates and then tested by PCR for the segregation of the CHX21 gene only. The resulting chx21-2−/− plants were further tested with gene-specific primers of the CHX23, chx23-4, and CHX23-GFP transgenes (see Supplemental Table 2). Finally, it was confirmed that all of the chx21-2−/−chx23-4−/− plants carried the CHX23-GFP transgene. As the transgene in T1 is heterozygous, the expected genotype of the hygromycin-resistant T2 population of CHX21+/+, chx21+/−, and chx21−/− would be 3:5:2. To test pollen fertility, pollen from stage 13 flowers was collected and counted under a stereoscopic zoom microscope (Nikon SMZ1000). Then, grains were dabbed onto the stigma surface of Wti, a male-sterile line (CITATION) that has wild-type CHX21 and CHX23. Seven days after pollination, pods were examined by stereoscopic zoom microscopy. Seeds within pods were visible and scored after depigmentation by 70% ethanol. Pods were opened and imaged. To view pollen tubes growing inside transmitting tract, pistils were given limited pollen grains. Six hours later, the pistil was cut and fixed in 10% acetic acid overnight. Tissues were softened in 1 M NaOH overnight, washed with 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and stained in 0.01% aniline blue. Fluorescent images observed with a Nikon microscope (Eclipse E600) under UV light were recorded. To visualize pollen tubes carrying a GUS reporter, pistils were pollinated as above. After various times, pistils were dissected and the ovary wall was removed. Intact ovules were fixed in 80% acetone overnight, incubated overnight with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-GlcUA (X-Gluc), and examined by differential interference contrast microscopy. Semi–in vivo pollen tube guidance was assayed according to CITATION. After hand-pollination, pistils were cut at the shoulder region of the ovary. Cut pistils were incubated on pollen tube growth medium at 25°С for ~6 h. Pollen tubes were incubated for 30 min in GUS staining buffer at 37°С. Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Relative GUS activity in flowers, pistils, or pollen tubes was determined after incubating tissues in GUS reaction mixture at 37°C for various periods (30 min to overnight). The reaction consists of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 2 mM X-Gluc. Images were taken using a Nikon stereoscope (SMZ1000) or a Nikon microscope with differential interference contrast (Eclipse E600). Fluorescence images of tobacco pollen were taken using a Nikon E800 microscope linked to a CCD camera (Spot; Diagnostic Instruments). GFP signal was imaged using an excitation filter (460 to 500 nm; DM505) and emission filter for 510 to 560 nm. Confocal images of pollen were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Images of GFP and RFP were observed using multitrack excitation wavelengths of 488 and 543 nm, and emission at BP 505 to 530 nm and LP 560 nm, respectively. For stably transformed Arabidopsis plants, 10 independent T3 lines were examined. Single-channel GFP confocal images were taken using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and LP 505 nm, respectively. Arabidopsis CHX23 was PCR amplified with primers AtCHX23-BglII-SE and AtCHX23-XhoI-AN (see Supplemental Table 2 online) using pECHX23 as template. The PCR product was isolated from agarose gel using a PCR DNA purification kit (Illustra, GE Healthcare) and then inserted into the multiple cloning site of pPAB404 (CITATION). The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli XL10 Gold, and transformants were plated on Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin and incubated at 37°C overnight. To confirm the sequence, colony PCR and sequencing were performed. The resulting plasmid pPAB404-CHX23 was used to transform E. coli strain LB2003 (F-, thi, lacZ, gal, rha, ΔkdpFABC5, trkD1, ΔtrkA), which lacks three K+ uptake systems, Trk, Kup, and Kdp (CITATION). Growth of transformed strains was monitored by changes in cell density at OD600 using a microplate reader. Transformants were cultured in YTM medium supplemented with 30 mM KCl and 50 μg/mL ampicillin (CITATION; CITATION). Basal YTM medium consisted of 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 100 mM mannitol at pH 7.0. Cells were washed three times with basal YTM medium to reduce [K+] to ~4 mM and normalized to an A600 of 0.5. Cells (20 μL/well) were added to wells containing 180 μL of YTM with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 50 μg/mL ampicillin, and 10 mM MES, 10 mM MOPS adjusted to the desired pH with Tris base. The 96-well plate was placed in a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) plate reader at 30°C and shaken for 15 s, and absorbance was measured every 15 min for 18 h. Net growth (OD) was obtained by subtracting the OD of YTM medium alone at the corresponding pH and time. For CHX-dependent growth, the OD of cells harboring empty vector at a specified time was subtracted from the net OD. K+ uptake was measured using 86Rb as a tracer. Cells were grown overnight in synthetic SGM (synthetic-glycerol-mannitol) medium supplemented with 30 mM KCl, 5 mM NH4Cl, and 50 μg/mL ampicillin. Basal SGM consisted of 4 mM H3PO4, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 10 μM FeSO4.citrate, 1 mM thiamine-HCl, 80 mM glycerol, and 100 mM mannitol adjusted to pH 7.3 with Arg base. Four hours before performing the uptake assay, cells were pelleted and suspended in SGM with K+ and N supplement for 2 h at 30°C to induce log phase growth. Cells were washed five times and suspended in basal SGM medium plus 0.5 mM IPTG to induce expression and deplete K+ for 2 h. Cells were normalized to an OD600 of 5.3. For time-course studies, a 4-mL reaction contained cells (with a final OD600 of 0.5), 0.5 mM IPTG, and 1 mM KCl (86Rb) in SGM medium supplemented with 10 mM MES and 10 mM MOPS adjusted to pH 6.2 with Arg. Cells were mixed with the reaction mixture at room temperature for 10 min before carrier-free 86Rb in SGM media (0.5 μCi/mL) was added to start the reaction. At the indicated time, a 750-μL aliquot was removed, diluted into 3.5 mL washing buffer at room temperature, and filtered with 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN BA-85; Whatman). The filter was rinsed two more times with 3.5 mL buffer. Wash buffer consisted of SGM plus 1.75 mM RbCl, and 20 mM KCl adjusted to pH 6.2. Radioactivity on filters was counted. Assays were conducted with two independent transformants for each strain, and experiments were repeated at least twice. To test whether other cations blocked Rb transport, 86Rb+ uptake at 30 min was assayed in a 0.75-mL reaction mixture with or without alkali cations. The final assay mixture contained cells at an OD600 of 0.4, 1 mM RbCl (0.5 μCi/mL 86Rb), 0.5 mM IPTG in SGM, 10 mM MES, and 10 mM MOPS adjusted to pH 6.2 with Arg. Different concentrations of alkali cations were included, and mixtures were osmotically balanced with mannitol. To start, cell suspension was added 30 s before carrier-free 86Rb was introduced. Transport was stopped by adding 3.5 mL wash buffer to each tube followed by filtration and two additional rinses.
