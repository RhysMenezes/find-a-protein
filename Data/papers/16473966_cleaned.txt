!~ABS~! Arabidopsis thaliana SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (SERK1) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) involved in the acquisition of embryogenic competence and in male sporogenesis. To determine the composition of the SERK1 signaling complex in vivo, we generated plants expressing the SERK1 protein fused to cyan fluorescent protein under SERK1 promoter control. The membrane receptor complex was immunoprecipitated from seedlings, and the coimmunoprecipitating proteins were identified using liquid chromatography/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight/mass spectrometry of the trypsin-released peptides. This approach identified two other LRR-RLKs, the BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) receptor and its coreceptor, the SERK3 or BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein. In addition, KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, CDC48A, and 14-3-3ν were found. Finally, the MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, a member of the CONSTANS family, were identified as part of the SERK1 complex. Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that SERK1 and SERK3 are part of BRI1-containing multiple protein complexes with relative masses between 300 and 500 kD. The SERK1 mutant allele serk1-1 enhances the phenotype of the weak BRI1 allele bri1-119. Collectively, these results suggest that apart from SERK3, SERK1 is also involved in the brassinolide signaling pathway.
!~RES~! To purify and detect the SERK1 protein and its interacting partners directly from seedlings, C-terminal SERK1-CFP fusion proteins were stably expressed in Arabidopsis wild-type plants under the control of the SERK1 promoter as described (CITATION). The expression pattern of SERK1-CFP was identical to that of a previously characterized SERK1–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein (CITATION). Similar to SERK1-YFP–expressing plants, no unusual phenotype was observed, whereas introduction of the same SERK1 promoter-SERK1-CFP construct used here in the SERK1 knockout mutant background restored the male sterility phenotype of the double serk1-1 serk2-2 mutant (CITATION). This finding confirms that the fusion protein did not interfere with its endogenous counterpart and was fully functional. Total proteins extracted from 7-d-old SERK1-CFP–expressing seedlings were separated by SDS-PAGE, and after blotting on a membrane, the fusion proteins were detected with anti–green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (Figure 1, lane 1). The same protein extract was detected with anti-GST-SERK1 kinase antibodies, which recognize endogenous SERK1 as well as the SERK1-CFP fusion proteins, confirming the specificity of the anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 1, lane 2). After immunoprecipitation, an aliquot was analyzed with anti-GFP antibody to confirm that SERK1-CFP was indeed recovered in the immunoprecipitation. A band of 100 kD was recognized only in protein extracts of the transgenic line (Figure 1, lane 4) and not in extracts of wild-type seedlings (Figure 1, lane 3). [[FIGURE]] To identify proteins that bind to SERK1 as extracted from SERK1-CFP–expressing seedlings, we subjected the immunoprecipitated proteins (bound to the protein A–Sepharose beads) to trypsin digestion. To reduce the influence of ion-suppression effects in MALDI-TOF/MS measurements and obtain more peptide peaks, separation of the tryptic peptides by reverse-phase column chromatography was performed before subjection to MALDI-TOF/MS measurements. As a negative control, samples obtained from an immunoprecipitated protein extract from wild-type seedlings with anti-GFP antibody were analyzed in the same way by LC/MALDI-TOF/MS. A representative LC/MALDI-TOF/MS spectrum, recorded for fraction 9 from the 24 LC fractions obtained after trypsin digestion of the immunoprecipitated SERK1 complex, is shown in Figure 2A. In Figure 2B, a spectrum recorded for fraction 9 of the trypsin-digested immunoprecipitated negative control extract is shown. All mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values also present in the negative control (i.e., values belonging to protein A, GFP antibodies, and proteins aspecifically immunoprecipitated by the GFP antibodies) were removed from the m/z list. The remaining values were then compared with the predicted tryptic peptide masses for the Arabidopsis proteome as described in Methods. The top panels in Figures 2C to 2F show four representative spectra, expanded from the spectrum shown in Figure 2A, that led to the identification of the SERK1-interacting partner, 14-3-3ν. The peaks with m/z 1492.7 (Figure 2C) and 1611.8 (Figure 2E) are predicted with one phosphorylated residue present. The peak with m/z 1531.8 (Figure 2D) has the same predicted peptide sequence as that predicted for m/z 1611.8 (Figure 2E) but without phosphorylation of the Ser residue. The same peptide sequence, but now extended by two missed tryptic cleavage sites, is predicted for the peak with m/z 1716.8 (Figure 2F). The bottom panels in Figures 2C to 2F show the corresponding expanded spectra recorded for the negative control sample shown in Figure 2B. [[FIGURE]] The combined results of comparable analyses performed for the list of remaining m/z values (see supplemental material online) were used to compile the list of identified proteins; these are presented in Table 1. As expected, SERK1 was identified as part of the complex. This identification was based on 13 tryptic peptide matches and a Mascot score of 84. All of the peptides found covered the kinase domain of SERK1 and are located on the exterior of the protein, including the phosphorylated peptides, based on the structural model for SERK1 (CITATION). None of the peptides matched the sequence of the extracellular domain, which may be attributable to posttranslational modification by glycosylation (CITATION) or to the presence of two disulfide bounds between the four Cys residues present, making trypsin digestion more difficult. One peptide could be identified in which the oxidation of Met had occurred, whereas three other peptides were identified that were modified by phosphorylation. The second receptor in the SERK1 complex was identified as the SERK3 or BAK1 protein. LC/MALDI-TOF/MS fingerprint analysis revealed tryptic peptide m/z values from both SERK1 and SERK3, but because of the high homology in their protein sequences (78%), 8 of 13 of the predicted m/z values match with the sequences of both proteins. Five peptides unique for SERK3 were identified, three without and two with modification by phosphorylation. Based on inspection of the model of SERK1 structure, four of the five SERK3-specific peptides identified are from a region also yielding peptides used for the identification of SERK1. This finding corroborates the identification of SERK1 and SERK3. SERK1-Interacting Proteins Identified by MALDI-TOF/MS For SERK2, which is 90% homologous with SERK1 at the protein level, five m/z values are identical for both proteins. No m/z values unique for SERK2 were found. The third receptor found in the SERK1 complex was the BRI1 receptor (CITATION) identified on the basis of 17 peptides, most of them covering the kinase domain. Most of the peptides identified with phosphorylations were also found as nonphosphorylated or as oxidized peptides, which provides additional evidence for identification as the BRI1 protein (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Because SERK3 (BAK1) is reported to be the coreceptor of BRI1 (CITATION; CITATION), the presence of both of these receptors suggests that there is a direct link between SERK1 activity and brassinolide signaling. In addition to SERK1, SERK3, and BRI1, several other proteins were found that were previously reported to interact with SERK1 and therefore were expected to be present in the SERK1 immunoprecipitated complex. One of them is Arabidopsis KAPP, which was shown to interact only with a catalytically active kinase domain of SERK1, involving Thr-468 (CITATION). In a yeast two-hybrid screen, two other proteins were found to interact with the kinase domain of SERK1, CDC48A and 14-3-3λ (CITATION). MALDI-TOF/MS fingerprint analysis indeed revealed tryptic peptides derived from CDC48A (Table 1). In our search, 14-3-3ν, rather then 14-3-3λ, was identified with a high score after searching even with the complete m/z list. Apparently, only these two members of the large Arabidopsis family of 14-3-3 proteins can interact with the SERK1 receptor. Finally, two unexpected proteins were found. The first is the MADS box transcription factor AGL15 (CITATION), and the second is a putative CONSTANS (CO)-like B-box zinc finger protein (At2g33500). The zinc finger protein is annotated as one large 401–amino acid protein and also as a shorter protein of 186 amino acids. We only found peptides covering the shorter protein. To validate that the proteins described above indeed interacted with SERK1, we treated control samples with SDS or with 0.5 M NaCl before coimmunoprecipitation to destroy protein–protein interactions. The resulting list of m/z values revealed only the presence of the SERK1 protein (data not shown). Finally, we used our coimmunoprecipitation procedure with the GFP-tagged BRI1 receptor and the GFP-tagged integral membrane protein PIN1. For BRI1, the resulting m/z lists did not reveal the presence of any of the SERK1-interacting proteins listed in Table 1 (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the coimmunoprecipitation/LC/MALDI-TOF/MS procedure for identifying protein complexes in Arabidopsis presented here is reliable and identifies specific interacting partners. To confirm our results obtained by LC/MALDI-TOF/MS, we used coimmunoprecipitation and FLIM-based analysis to detect the interaction between SERK1 and its interacting partners in vivo. CFP-tagged SERK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies, and the precipitated proteins were detected using anti-BRI1 antibodies. A band with the expected mobility of BRI1 was visualized (Figure 3A, lane 1) that was absent in an immunoprecipitation of wild-type plants with the GFP antibody (Figure 3A, lane 2). BRI1 antibodies recognize endogenous BRI1 as well as BRI1-GFP fusion proteins and can precipitate BRI1 from a total plant protein extract (Figure 3B, lanes 1 to 3). The BRI1 antibodies are specific for BRI1 because they do not detect a band of the expected mobility for BRI1 in a protein extract from seedlings of the strong bri1-4 allele (data not shown). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation with anti-BRI1 antibodies revealed the presence of SERK1-CFP in the coimmunoprecipitated proteins (Figure 3C, lane 1). [[FIGURE]] Previously, we showed that FRET can be detected between CFP and YFP of SERK3 and BRI1 when transiently expressed in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) protoplasts. Coexpression of BRI1 and SERK3 results in a change of the steady state distribution of both receptors as a result of accelerated endocytosis (CITATION). To determine whether SERK1 can form heterodimers with either BRI1 or SERK3 in the plasma membrane, we used a similar transient assay in protoplasts to detect FRET by FLIM. In Figure 3D, we show the fluorescence intensity images of protoplasts transfected with SERK1-CFP alone (Figure 3D, I), SERK1-CFP together with BRI1-YFP (Figure 3D, II), and SERK1-YFP together with SERK3-CFP (Figure 3D, III). The corresponding fluorescence lifetime images are compared in panels IV to VI in Figure 3D. The results presented in Figure 3D (panel V) show that SERK1 and BRI1 heterodimerize in small patches in the plasma membrane, as indicated by the significant reduction in the average lifetime (τ) from 2.5 to 2.1 ns of the donor (SERK1-CFP) molecules in those areas indicated by the arrowhead. A similar phenomenon was described for the SERK3/BRI1 heterodimers (CITATION). SERK1-YFP also formed heterodimers with SERK3-CFP in the plasma membrane, as shown by the green plasma membrane in Figure 3D (panel VI) that corresponds to an average lifetime of 1.9 ns for the donor (SERK3-CFP) molecules. Thus, colocalization in the plasma membrane and the ability to form heterodimers in plant protoplasts strongly suggest that SERK1, SERK3, and BRI1 can be part of the same complex in intact plant membranes. To confirm the in vivo interaction of CDC48A with SERK1, we coimmunoprecipitated SERK1 from Arabidopsis tissue-cultured cells with anti-GST-SERK1 kinase antibodies (CITATION). The precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-CDC48 antibodies (CITATION). A band with the expected mobility for monomeric CDC48A was detected in the total protein extract (Figure 4A, lane 1) and in the immunoprecipitated sample (Figure 4A, lane 3), showing that Arabidopsis CDC48A indeed coimmunoprecipitates with SERK1. No CDC48A band was detected in the negative control using rabbit preimmune serum for immunoprecipitation (Figure 4A, lane 2). Similarly, the presence of a 14-3-3 protein in the complex with SERK1 in vivo was verified by coimmunoprecipitation with GFP antibodies of CFP-tagged SERK1 followed by immunodetection with anti–14-3-3 antibodies (Figure 4B, lane 1). No 14-3-3 band was detected in the negative control using wild-type seedlings for immunoprecipitation (Figure 4B, lane 2). The 14-3-3 antiserum can recognize in vitro–produced 14-3-3ν (data not shown) as well as 14-3-3λ, confirming that SERK1 can interact with both 14-3-3λ (CITATION) and 14-3-3ν isoforms. A summary of the experiments providing additional evidence for the presence of proteins in the SERK1 complex is shown in Table 1. [[FIGURE]] Analysis of the single T-DNA insertion mutant serk1-1, an allele that produces a kinase-dead receptor protein, did not reveal a morphological plant phenotype (CITATION). Therefore, we crossed the serk1-1 allele into the weak BRI1 mutant allele bri1-119. This allele contains the G644D missense mutation in the island domain of BRI1 (CITATION). At the seedling level, 7-d-old bri1-119 mutants exhibit mild morphological characteristics of the phenotype conferred by bri1, such as small seedlings, short petioles, and round, dark green, inwardly curved true leaves (Figure 5A). bri1-119 plants developed smaller, compact rosettes (Figure 5D) compared with wild-type plants. The weak bri1-119 allele is a semifertile dwarf that has less reduced stature (Figure 5D) compared with severe bri1 alleles (CITATION). The serk1-1 mutation clearly enhanced all BRI1-associated phenotypes, especially the length of the petioles and excessive inward curling, now seen in 7-d-old seedlings of the double mutant bri1-119 serk1-1 (Figure 5B), as well as a reduction in the size of the rosette (Figure 5E; see Supplemental Table 2 online). The inflorescence length of the double bri1-119 serk1-1 mutant was also reduced (Figure 5H; see Supplemental Table 2 online). For comparison, we also introduced the serk3 mutation (CITATION), an allele of the BAK1 coreceptor, into bri1-119. The resulting bri1-119 serk3 double mutant had even smaller rosettes (Figure 5F) and grew with a severely reduced stature (Figure 5I; see Supplemental Table 2 online) resembling strong bri1 alleles. This finding indicates that the serk3 mutation had an even stronger effect on bri1-119 than did serk1-1. To rule out the possibility that the observed modification of the phenotype conferred by bri1-119 by the serk1-1 allele is attributable to the introduction of the Columbia ecotype into the Enkheim-2 background, we also combined the serk2-2 mutant allele, which shows no morphological alterations from the wild type (CITATION), with bri1-119 (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The resulting bri1-119 serk2-2 double mutants were indistinguishable from bri1-119 in terms of inflorescence length and rosette width, demonstrating that there is no effect of the Columbia ecotype. These results provide genetic evidence that SERK1 is involved in BRI1 signaling and confirm the role of the SERK3 (BAK1) gene as a BRI1 coreceptor. [[FIGURE]] In previous studies, we showed that SERK1 is located at the membrane in protoplasts and in plants (CITATION; CITATION) and can directly interact in vitro and in vivo with KAPP and 14-3-3λ and in vitro with CDC48A (CITATION; CITATION). The results presented here confirm the previously observed interactions and show that SERK1 can be present in a complex with several other proteins. It is not clear whether the SERK1 complex harbors all of the proteins listed in Table 1 at the same time or that we immunoprecipitated multiple forms of the SERK1 complex. Different forms could exist in different cell types or in different subcellular locations, such as plasma membrane or after internalization (CITATION). To determine the size of the SERK1 complex in planta, microsomal preparations from SERK1-CFP– and BAK1-GFP–expressing seedlings and wild-type seedlings were solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to blue native (BN) PAGE. In this technique, Coomassie dyes and aminocaproic acid are used to induce a charge shift and improve the solubilization of membrane-associated proteins (CITATION). To detect SERK1 within the potential protein complex, single lanes of the BN-PAGE gel were cut and mounted on a denaturing SDS gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibody or anti-GST-SERK1 kinase antibody. Using mass standards, ∼85% of the protein complex containing SERK1 was determined to have a mean relative mass of 350 kD. The remaining 15% appears to exist as a complex with a mean mass of 450 kD. The maximum size is ∼500 kD (Figure 6A). This variability in protein complex size is also seen when the tagged SERK1-CFP complex is detected by anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 6B). Approximately 90% of the CFP-tagged complex has a mean mass of 400 kD and 10% has a mass of ∼500 kD. Although there is a clear difference in the mean size of the complex with and without the CFP tag, we cannot precisely estimate whether this difference is 25 kD (one molecule of CFP protein) or 50 kD (two molecules of CFP protein). [[FIGURE]] The results show that there is one abundant core complex for SERK1 of ∼350 kD. We first examined whether BRI1 was part of the core SERK1 complex. Therefore, a microsomal fraction prepared from SERK1-CFP transgenic plants was examined for the presence of BRI1 proteins. BRI1 was found in complex with the same size range of 400 to 500 kD (Figure 6C, panel 1) as the SERK1-CFP proteins. In contrast with SERK1, most of the BRI1 protein was found as probably a homodimeric form of ∼250 kD (Figure 6C, panel 2). The occurrence of potential BRI1 homodimers is consistent with our observation of BRI1 homodimerization in protoplast (CITATION) and was recently shown in plants (CITATION). The observed smaller and higher forms of BRI1 are probably attributable to the recognition of differentially processed forms (Figure 6C). The distribution of BAK1 in the microsomes prepared from BAK1-GFP transgenic plants was then studied by BN-PAGE. BAK1-GFP was found in complex(es) with the same size range as SERK1-CFP (Figure 6D). These data suggest that BRI1, SERK1, and SERK3 are indeed present in the main 350-kD core complex and are also present in complexes of higher molecular mass. No signal was detected when solubilized microsomes from wild-type seedlings were analyzed for the presence of GFP, confirming that the signals observed in Figures 6B and 6D are indeed derived from microsomal SERK1-CFP or BAK1-GFP (Figure 6E). Collectively, the results obtained from BN-PAGE suggest that the core SERK1 complex of ∼350 kD as well as the larger complexes consist of the membrane receptors SERK1, SERK3, and BRI1. Assuming that all proteins listed in Table 1 are present as monomers, a predicted size of ∼500 kD is obtained. Although this is about the maximum size of the SERK1 complex as estimated by BN-PAGE, it exceeds the size of the predominant complex of 350 kD. In summary, we propose that in Arabidopsis seedlings, a core SERK1 membrane complex consists of SERK1, BRI1, and SERK3. Collectively, this would amount to ∼270 kD when all proteins are present as monomers, or between 350 and 400 kD in a more conventional tetrameric arrangement. This is clearly in the range of the observed sizes on BN-PAGE gels. KAPP interacts only with the active SERK1 receptor (CITATION) and could represent one of the less abundant higher molecular mass forms.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used as the wild type. Seeds were surface-sterilized and sown on germination medium (half-strength Murashige and Skoog salt and vitamins medium [Duchefa] supplemented with 0.8% [w/v] agar [Daishin] and 2% [w/v] sucrose). Seeds were kept for 2 d at 4°C and then transferred to a growth chamber. Seedlings were grown at 22°C under 16-h light/8-h dark periods for 7 d. Arabidopsis plants expressing the SERK1 receptor fused to CFP under the control of its native promoter were similar to the SERK1-YFP–expressing plants described previously by CITATION. BRI1-GFP transgenic plants used for immunoprecipitation and BAK1-GFP plants used for BN-PAGE were described previously (CITATION; CITATION). The bri1-4 strong allele (No. 3953; obtained from Frans Tax via the Arabidopsis Stock Center) was described previously by CITATION. The bri1-119 mutant was obtained from the ABRC (Ohio State University; stock No. CS399, ecotype Enkheim-2) and was described previously by CITATION and CITATION. The SERK1 and SERK3 knockout lines, serk1-1 and serk3, were obtained from the SIGnAL TDNA-Express collection (CITATION) as insertion lines SALK_544330 and SALK_034523.56.00, respectively, and the serk2-2 insertion line (No. 119-G03) was from the Syngenta Arabidopsis insertion lines, described previously by CITATION, in the Columbia background. bri1-119 serk1-1 and bri1-119 serk2-2 were generated by crossing bri1-119 with serk1-1 or serk2-2, respectively; bri1-119 serk3 was generated by crossing bri1-119 with serk3. In each case, F1 plants were allowed to self-fertilize, and candidate double F2 plants were genotyped phenotypically and by PCR. The full-length SERK1, SERK3, and BRI1 CFP and YFP fusion constructs were described previously (CITATION; CITATION). FLIM was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP system in combination with a Nikon TE 300 inverted microscope as described (CITATION). From the intensity images obtained, complete fluorescence lifetime decays were calculated per pixel and fitted using a double exponential decay model. The fluorescence lifetime of one component was fixed to the value found for SERK1-CFP (2.5 ns). To prepare total protein extracts, plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen and thawed in extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor cocktail according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 200g (Beckman Microfuge 18 centrifuge) at 4°C for 3 min. The concentration of extracted proteins was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. After boiling 30 μg of total protein for 5 min in sample buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 100 mM DTT, the proteins were separated on 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (CITATION) and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by wet electroblotting (Mini-Protean II system; Bio-Rad). Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP (IgG fraction, 1500× dilution; Molecular Probes), and a polyclonal antibody was generated against the GST-SERK1 kinase domain fusion protein (3000× dilution) (CITATION). Anti-BRI1 specific antibodies were kindly provided by Joanne Chory (Salk Institute for Biological Studies; used at 1000× dilution), anti-CDC48A antibodies (CITATION) were kindly provided by Sebastian Bednarek (Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin; used at 1000× dilution), and-14-3-3 antibodies have been described previously (CITATION). Bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated IgG purified donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 10,000× dilution (Rockland Laboratories) or goat anti-chicken secondary antibody at 5000× dilution (Rockland Laboratories) and visualized using reagents for chemiluminescent detection (ECL Plus reagent; Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of microsomes and BN-PAGE were performed as described (CITATION). Microsomes from 7-d-old seedlings from wild-type plants or transgenic plants expressing the SERK1 promoter-SERK1-CFP construct were solubilized in extraction buffer supplemented with 750 mM aminocaproic acid and incubated for 30 min on ice. Aliquots of supernatants were incubated with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 and 5% (v/v) glycerol and loaded on the gel. BN-PAGE was then performed according to CITATION on a 5 to 15% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Albumin bovine monomer (66 kD), albumin bovine dimer (132 kD), urease trimer (272 kD), and urease hexamer (545 kD) from Sigma-Aldrich were used as marker proteins. Routinely, we used four plates (9 cm) with ∼400 7-d-old seedlings (100 per plate) to prepare a protein extract suitable for immunoprecipitation. Ten milliliters of total plant protein extract (1 mg/mL) in extraction buffer (isolated as described above) was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 100 μL of 50% (v/v) protein A–Sepharose CL-4B beads slurry (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. After centrifugation at 200g (Beckman Microfuge 18 centrifuge) for 2 min at 4°C, the supernatant was incubated with 7 μL of anti-GFP, anti-BRI1, anti–14-3-3, anti-CDC48A, or rabbit preimmune serum. After incubation with gentle mixing for 1 h at 4°C, 200 μL of fresh 50% slurry of protein A beads was added, and incubation was continued for 4 h. Protein A beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 200g for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed three times with 1 mL of wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl) and once with 10 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8. Before the last wash step, the beads together with the wash buffer were moved to a new tube. After centrifugation, the wash buffer was removed, and the beads were used in this form directly for digestion with trypsin and subsequent MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. For immunodetection, the proteins were eluted from the beads by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95°C. In the case of coimmunoprecipitation of SERK1-CFP with rabbit anti-GFP antibodies and detection with rabbit anti–14-3-3 antibodies, no DTT was included in the SDS sample buffer. This prevents separation of the heavy and light chains of the antibodies and improves the resolution of the blots, because the detection system also recognized IgGs whose light chains overlap with the 14-3-3 proteins. Proteins bound to protein A beads in 50 μL of 10 mM NH4HCO3 were incubated with 100 ng of trypsin (sequencing grade; Boehringer Mannheim). After overnight incubation with gentle shaking at room temperature, the pH was decreased to 2 by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water up to 0.4% (v/v). Fifty microliters of peptide sample was injected into a 100 × 0.25-mm Prontosil 3-μm C18H column (prepared in-house) and eluted at a flow rate of 4 μL/min with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% TFA. A gradient from 5 to 20% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% (v/v) TFA was applied in 90 s, followed by a slower linear increase to 40% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% (v/v) TFA in another 4 min (Alliance 2690 running at 0.25 mL/min equipped with a flow splitter; Waters). Samples were collected directly onto a sample plate (MTP AnchorChip 200/384; Bruker Daltonics) in fractions of 15 s, taking into account the system gradient delay time and column volume before starting collection. After air-drying, 1 μL of a 20× diluted α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid solution was added to each spot. This solution was prepared by diluting a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid solution (prepared in 50% [v/v] acetonitrile, 49% [v/v] water, and 1% [v/v] TFA) 20 times into the same solution. Sample spots were recrystallized by applying 1.5 μL of 60% (v/v) ethanol, 30% (v/v) acetone, 10% (v/v) water, and 0.1% (v/v) TFA to all samples and allowing them to air-dry. Mass spectra were measured with a Bruker Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/MS apparatus equipped with a reflectron (Bruker Daltonics) in positive mode with a high precision method. Spectra were measured after external quadratic calibration with a peptide standard mixture containing nine peptides in the mass range between 757 and 3146 D (Bruker Daltonics). In general, spectra were summed for ∼500 to 1000 laser pulses (20 Hz; nitrogen laser at 337 nm) and internally recalibrated with protein A–derived peptides and/or trypsin autolysis peaks when present. All m/z values also present in the control peptide sample were subsequently removed from the m/z list obtained for the immunoprecipitated SERK1 protein complex. Remaining m/z values were checked for sodium and/or potassium adducts (differences of 22.990 and 38.946 D, respectively). When found, these m/z values were deleted as well. For identification of SERK1, the program GPMAW (http://welcome.to/gpmaw/) was used to determine which m/z values corresponded to tryptic peptides from the predicted protein sequence of SERK1. These selected m/z values were used as inputs for the MASCOT program to search either the Arabidopsis database or all entries without selecting a taxonomy. The posttranslational modifications phosphorylation (of Ser, Thr, and Tyr) and oxidation of Met were allowed, and a peptide m/z tolerance of 100 ppm was used. After identification, the m/z values that matched the SERK1 protein were removed from the list before searching for other proteins. Alternatively, the searches were performed with the complete m/z list directly using the MASCOT search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com) (CITATION).
