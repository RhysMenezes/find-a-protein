!~ABS~! All plants flower late in their life cycle. For example, in Arabidopsis, the shoot undergoes a transition and produces reproductive flowers after the adult phase of vegetative growth. Much is known about genetic and environmental processes that control flowering time in mature plants. However, little is understood about the mechanisms that prevent plants from flowering much earlier during embryo and seedling development. Arabidopsis embryonic flower (emf1 and emf2) mutants flower soon after germination, suggesting that a floral repression mechanism is established in wild-type plants that prevents flowering until maturity. Here, we show that polycomb group proteins play a central role in repressing flowering early in the plant life cycle. We found that mutations in the Fertilization Independent Endosperm (FIE) polycomb gene caused the seedling shoot to produce flower-like structures and organs. Flower-like structures were also generated from the hypocotyl and root, organs not associated with reproduction. Expression of floral induction and homeotic genes was derepressed in mutant embryos and seedlings. These results suggest that FIE-mediated polycomb complexes are an essential component of a floral repression mechanism established early during plant development.
!~RES~! To understand FIE polycomb function, and to visualize the pattern of recombinant FIE protein accumulation, we generated Arabidopsis lines bearing a transgene, pFIE∷FIE-GFP, with 1,639 bp of FIE 5′-flanking sequences (pFIE), a modified FIE 5′-untranslated region, a sequence that encodes the full-length FIE protein (FIE), a linker sequence encoding six glycine amino acids, and then a sequence encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP; ref. CITATION). GFP fluorescence was detected in the progenitor of the endosperm, the central cell nucleus, before (Fig. FIG-REFA) and after (Fig. FIG-REFB) fertilization. By the eight-nuclei endosperm stage, GFP fluorescence was no longer detectable (Fig. FIG-REFC), and could not be detected at any later stage of plant development (data not shown). Nor could FIE-GFP RNA be detected in pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgenic seedlings when the endogenous FIE gene is expressed (Fig. FIG-REF). Thus, expression of the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene in the very early stages of seed development, observed in multiple independently transformed lines, was highly restricted when compared with the pattern of FIE RNA accumulation in the ovule, female gametophyte, embryo, endosperm, seedling (Fig. FIG-REF), leaf, stem, root, and flower (CITATION, CITATION). Although pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene expression did not recapitulate the wild-type pattern of FIE RNA accumulation, perhaps because of a requirement for additional regulatory sequences and/or the sensitivity of GFP fluorescence detection, it was able to complement the fie seed abortion phenotype. That is, self-pollinated heterozygous fie-1/FIE plants that are homozygous for the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene displayed siliques with no seed abortion (Fig. FIG-REFD). When germinated, we observed seedlings, all homozygous for the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene, with Mendelian 1:2:1 segregation (20:28:12, χ2 = 2.6, P = 0.35) of FIE/FIE:fie-1/FIE:fie-1/fie-1 genotypes. In contrast, siliques from control self-pollinated fie-1/FIE plants contain 50% nonviable seeds (Fig. FIG-REFE) and when germinated the seedlings segregate 1:1 for FIE/FIE:fie-1/FIE genotypes. Thus, expression of the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene in the central cell and early endosperm rescues embryo and seed abortion associated with inheritance of a maternal mutant fie-1 allele. This result shows that the FIE-GFP fusion protein is active and suggests that fie embryo and seed abortion may be due primarily to a defect in endosperm development.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Plants homozygous for the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene that were either homozygous for the wild-type FIE allele, or heterozygous fie-1/FIE, developed normally (Fig. FIG-REFA and data not shown). Thus, in the presence of a wild-type FIE allele, the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene caused no detectable alteration in plant development. However, none of the seedlings tested that were homozygous for the fie-1 allele and the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene developed normally. These seedlings were smaller (Fig. FIG-REFB) and did not produce normal rosettes. In some cases, highly disorganized structures emerged from the shoot apical meristem (Fig. FIG-REFC). Seedlings often produced sessile leaves (Fig. FIG-REFD) with trichomes (Fig. FIG-REF J and K) that resembled cauline leaves. We also observed white petal-like organs lacking trichomes (Fig. FIG-REFE). In some cases, floral buds emerged that were surrounded by sessile leaves (Fig. FIG-REF F and K). Within the floral buds, outer whorl sepals could be distinguished by the appearance of unbranched trichomes on their abaxial surfaces (Fig. FIG-REFK) and by their highly elongated cells (Fig. FIG-REFL). Inner whorl organs whose distinctive shapes resembled immature stamens and carpels were also observed (Fig. FIG-REFL). Finally, floral organs within flower buds often displayed proper floral crucifer phyllotaxy (Fig. FIG-REF F and L). The mutant phenotypes described above were observed in multiple independently isolated transgenic lines (data not shown) as well as in seedlings homozygous for the null fie-1 allele and for a FIEp∷FIE transgene that produces FIE protein without a GFP moiety (data not shown). Thus, the mutant phenotypes were not due to any effect of GFP on the structure or cellular location of FIE. Taken together, these results show that the transition from vegetative to inflorescence development has prematurely occurred in the shoot apical meristem of seedlings homozygous for the null fie-1 allele and the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. This result suggests that one of the functions of the FIE gene is to repress the transition to flowering in the seedling shoot apical meristem.  [[FIGURE]] Production of shoots and flower-like organs was not limited to the shoot apical meristem in seedlings homozygous for the fie-1 allele and the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. Shoots frequently emerged from the hypocotyl and roots of intact seedlings (Fig. FIG-REF G and H). Carpel-shaped organs with stigmatic papillae at their tips were present in such adventitious shoots (Fig. FIG-REFM). In addition, organs tipped with stigmatic papillae and with structures resembling ovule primordia on their edges were observed (Fig. FIG-REF N and O). In some cases, shoots with organs arranged in a floral crucifer phyllotaxy were observed (Fig. FIG-REFN). When roots were cultured in hormone-free media, many additional organs were produced with stigmatic papillae and structures resembling ovule primordia (Fig. FIG-REFI). These results show that ectopic shoots and organs resembling flowers were produced in seedlings homozygous for the fie-1 allele and the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. This result suggests that another function of the wild-type FIE allele is to repress the formation of shoots and floral organs outside of the seedling shoot apical meristem region. The mutant phenotypes described above were observed in transgenic pFIE∷FIE-GFP seedlings that were also homozygous for the null fie-1 allele, and were never observed when a wild-type FIE allele was present. Thus, the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgenic allele is recessive to the wild-type FIE allele. This fact, along with the restriction of pFIE∷FIE-GFP gene expression to very early seed development (Fig. FIG-REF A–C), suggests that loss of FIE activity is responsible for early flowering and ectopic shoot formation in seedlings that are homozygous for the null fie-1 allele and have a pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. From this result, we reasoned that expanding the period of FIE activity during embryogenesis and seedling development with a different transgene might result in plants that develop more normally. To test this hypothesis, we generated pCaMV∷FIE-GFP transgenic plants where transcription of FIE-GFP is under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (pCaMV) promoter (CITATION). In pCaMV∷FIE-GFP lines, we detected a broad pattern of GFP fluorescence throughout embryo development, including the later stages, that diminished in the germinating seedling (data not shown). Whereas pFIE∷FIE-GFP gene expression was not detected in seedlings, FIE-GFP RNA encoded by the pCaMV∷FIE-GFP gene was present (Fig. FIG-REF). By genetic crosses, we obtained plants that were homozygous for fie-1, pFIE∷FIE-GFP, and pCaMV∷FIE-GFP. These plants did not display any of the mutant phenotypes shown in Fig. FIG-REF and could not be distinguished from wild-type plants. They produced rosette leaves, followed by inflorescences, fertile flowers, and siliques with viable seed (data not shown). Thus, we were able to adjust the level of FIE activity with the two transgenes to recapitulate the wild-type flowering time phenotype. These results verify that early flowering and ectopic shoot and floral organ formation is due to a critical lack of FIE activity in seedlings homozygous for fie-1 and the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. To understand the molecular basis for the early flowering phenotypes, we measured the expression of meristem and floral organ identity genes in mutant and control seedlings. LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) encode transcription factors that promote floral meristem identity in Arabidopsis and, with the aid of other factors, activate transcription of floral meristem and organ identity genes such as AGAMOUS (AG), APETALA3 (AP3), and PISTILLATA (PI) (CITATION). As shown in Fig. FIG-REFA, LFY RNA was present at a low level, and AP1 RNA was not detected in wild-type 7-day and 14-day seedlings. The same result was observed in 7- and 14-day seedlings containing the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. However, in seedlings that were homozygous fie-1 with a pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene, LFY RNA concentration was significantly elevated in 7-day seedlings, and AP1 RNA concentration was increased in both 7-day and 14-day seedlings. No effect on the expression of other genes that accelerate flowering time, CONSTANS (CO; ref. CITATION) or FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT; refs. CITATION and CITATION), was observed (data not shown). Because ectopic expression of either LFY or AP1 is sufficient to convert the normally indeterminate shoot apex to a floral meristem that forms a terminal flower (CITATION, CITATION), it is likely that aspects of the fie early flowering phenotype are due to their ectopic expression. Floral organ identity gene expression was also affected by the level of FIE activity. Whereas AG and PI RNAs were not detected in control wild-type seedlings, or control seedlings with the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene, both RNAs accumulated in homozygous fie-1, pFIE∷FIE-GFP seedlings (Fig. FIG-REFA). Taken together, these results suggest that FIE-mediated polycomb complexes, either directly or indirectly, repress expression of both floral meristem identity genes and floral organ identity genes during seedling development.  [[FIGURE]] To investigate the spatial regulation of gene transcription by FIE-mediated polycomb complexes, we determined the activity of LFY, AG, and AP3 promoters ligated to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene (CITATION) in transgenic seedlings. As shown in Fig. FIG-REFB, LFY∷GUS transcription was restricted to the wild-type seedling shoot apical meristem, whereas there was no detectable transcription of the AG∷GUS or AP3∷GUS transgenes in wild-type seedlings. In contrast, homozygous fie-1 seedlings with the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene showed elevated LFY∷GUS, AG∷GUS, and AP3∷GUS transcription in the shoot apical meristem, cotyledon, and hypocotyl regions. These results show that FIE-mediated polycomb complexes, either directly or indirectly, repress transcription of floral meristem identity and floral organ identity genes in the aerial seedling. When does repression of flowering and floral-promoting gene transcription begin? One possibility is that aspects of floral repression initiate early in plant development during embryogenesis. To test this hypothesis, embryo RNA was isolated from self-pollinated plants heterozygous for fie-1/FIE and homozygous for the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene (Fig. FIG-REF, lane 2). Twenty-five percent of these embryos are homozygous for fie-1 and the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. Control wild-type embryo RNA was also isolated (Fig. FIG-REF, lane 1). Semiquantitative reverse transcription–PCR analysis indicated that the level of LFY, AG, and PI RNA was elevated in the population that included homozygous fie-1, pFIE∷FIE-GFP embryos. In this experiment, we could not detect AP1 embryo RNA in either embryo population, perhaps because a factor not regulated by FIE is required for AP1 expression in the embryo. Finally, expression of control genes PK and APG was the same in both embryo populations. These results suggest that FIE-mediated polycomb complexes function during embryogenesis, either directly or indirectly, to repress the expression of specific floral meristem and organ identity genes.

!~MM~! Seedlings were grown on hormone-free agar plates [0.5× MS salts (GIBCO/BRL)], 2% sucrose, Gamborg's B5 vitamins (GIBCO/BRL), and 0.8% agar (Difco). Plants were grown on soil under long day conditions (16 h light). LFY∷GUS (LFY promoter ligated to GUS cDNA) seed was provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (CS6297). AG∷GUS (AG promoter ligated to GUS cDNA; KB9) and AP3∷GUS (AP3 promoter ligated to GUS cDNA; 890-7) seed were provided by D. Weigel and T. Jack. To construct a FIE-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, the FIE cDNA was amplified with primers FIE-Sal (5′-ATGTCGACGAGAGTCAGACAGAGAGAGAG-3′) and FIE-NcoI (5′-CACCATGGCTCCGCCACCTCCGCCACCCTTGGTAATCACGTCCCAGCG-3′), digested with SalI and NcoI, and inserted into the CaMV35S-sGFPS65T-Nos vector (CITATION) to obtain the CaMV35S∷FIE-sGFPS65T-Nos plasmid. The GFP gene used in these experiments lacks subcellular localization sequences. To have transcription of the FIE-GFP fusion gene under the control of a FIE promoter, 1,639 base pairs of FIE 5′-flanking sequences were amplified with primers FIE-Sph (5′-TTCCTATAAGAGGCATGCGAGGAAGCGAGCAAGTACACA-3′) and FIE-SalRV (5′-TCTGACTCTCGTCGACTAATCTAAGCTCACAAGTCTCTCA-3′), digested with SalI and Sph, and inserted into the CaMV35S∷FIE-sGFPS65T-Nos plasmid to create the CaMV35S∷pFIE∷FIE-sGFPS65T-Nos plasmid. This plasmid was digested with PstI and HindIII to liberate the pFIE∷FIE-GFP (FIE promoter ligated to FIE and GFP cDNA sequences) transgene that was then inserted into pBI101.1 (CITATION), replacing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter, to create plasmid pBI(pFIE∷FIE-GFP) that was introduced into Agrobacterium GV3101. Arabidopsis plants (i.e., Columbia-0 ecotype) were transformed as described (CITATION). Transgenic plants were crossed with heterozygous fie-1/FIE plants, and F1 progeny were self-pollinated to generate plants heterozygous for fie-1/FIE and homozygous for pFIE∷FIE-GFP. Expression of pFIE∷FIE-GFP was highly restricted compared with previously reported constructs (CITATION), and this result may be due, at least in part, to the process of creating a SalI site in the FIE cDNA that changed nucleotides −38 to −36 (translation start site is position 1) in the 5′-untranslated region from GTG to CGA. To amplify endogenous FIE gene sequences we used primers 579dXba (5′-CATTACTGCCATTGGTGTATCTCTTATTATCTA-3′) and 48S4 (5′-CACTGTTGACGTCAATGACTCGG-3′). Because the 579dXBa primer is located in the first intron of the FIE gene, it does not amplify any sequences associated with the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene. We distinguished fie-1 and wild-type FIE alleles by digesting the amplified products with XbaI restriction endonuclease followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR amplified product from the wild-type FIE allele is digested, whereas the fie-1 allele is not. To amplify pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene sequences, we used a primer in the FIE cDNA region, FIE-RTf (5′-CTGTAATCAGGCAAACAGCC-3′) and a primer in the GFP cDNA region, GFP274r (5′-GCATGGCGGACTTGAAGA-3′). PCR reactions were performed as described (CITATION). Seedlings with the pFIE∷FIE-GFP transgene were identified by growth on agar plates with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. RNA (0.2 μg) was converted to cDNA as described (CITATION). Amplification of cDNA by PCR involved incubation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles except when indicated at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 10 s. Gene-specific primers were as follows: AP1 (AP1500f 5′-GATGATATAAGAACATCGAACATTTGCCA-3′ and AP1991r 5′-GATGATATAAGAACATCGAACATTTGCCA-3′), LFY (LFY4042f 5′-GCTAAAGACCGTGGCGAA-3′ and LFY5371r 5′-GCATCCACCACGTCCAGA-3′), AG (AG5523f 5′-GTTGATTTGCATAACGATAACCAGA-3′ and AG6116r 5′-TTCACTGATACAACATTCATGGGAT-3′), PI (PI1500f 5′-CACGCCATTGAACATGGCCT-3′ and PI2020r 5′-TCGATGATCAATCGATGACCAA-3′), actin (ACT.conf 5′-GATTTGGCATCACACTTTCTACAATG-3′ and ACT.conr 5′-GTTCCACCACTGAGCACAATG-3′), PK (PKf 5′-CTTCACCACATGGGTCACA-3′ and PKr2 5′-CTAAACCGGAAGGAATGGA-3′), APG (APGf 5′-CTTGTGTCTCTGGTTGATCA-3′ and APGr2 5′-CTCTGTGTTTGCTTGGAGGA-3′), FIE (FIE-RTr 5′-TCAAGGTCTCAGGGAGTAGCA-3′ and FIE-RTf), and FIE-GFP (FIE-RTf and GFP274r).
