!~ABS~! A group of nuclear transcription factors, the Whirly proteins, were recently shown to be targeted also to chloroplasts and mitochondria. In order to find out whether other proteins might share this feature, an in silico-based screening of transcription factors from Arabidopsis and rice was carried out with the aim of identifying putative N-terminal chloroplast and mitochondrial targeting sequences. For this, the individual predictions of several independent programs were combined to a consensus prediction using a naïve Bayes method. This consensus prediction shows a higher specificity at a given sensitivity value than each of the single programs. In both species, transcription factors from a variety of protein families that possess putative N-terminal plastid or mitochondrial target peptides as well as nuclear localization sequences, were found. A search for homologues within members of the AP2/EREBP protein family revealed that target peptide-containing proteins are conserved among monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Fusion of one of these proteins to GFP revealed, indeed, a dual targeting activity of this protein. We propose that dually targeted transcription factors might be involved in the communication between the nucleus and the organelles in plant cells. We further discuss how recent results on the physical interaction between the organelles and the nucleus could have significance for the regulation of the localization of these proteins.
!~RES~! For most of the annotated plant transcription factors no experimental data concerning their subcellular localization are available. Analyses of these proteins are complicated by the fact that they are often present in trace amounts only. Sensitive methods like mass spectrometric analysis of compartmental proteomes are prone to artifacts because of the danger of cross-contamination from other cell compartments. Optical in vivo techniques based on the fusion with fluorescent proteins such as GFP or immunological methods are more reliable but are only available for a few selected proteins. For the task of identifying potential candidates that are targeted to one of the organelles, a prediction method of the subcellular localization that picks up as many true positives for a given compartment while keeping the number of false positives or true negatives as low as possible is highly desired. Wagner and Pfannschmidt (CITATION) have recently listed 48 putatively plastid-targeted transcription factors from Arabidopsis based on the prediction with the program TargetP (Nielsen et al. CITATION). In contrast, we have chosen an approach where the results of several prediction programs were combined to a consensus prediction using a naïve Bayes method (see Materials and methods). In order to compare the performance of the consensus prediction to those of the individual single prediction programs that contribute to it, the specificities were calculated using sets of organellar test proteins consisting of >500 proteins from Arabidopsis and other species. For control, a test set of >600 proteins of confirmed non-organellar localization was used. We found that for both plastid and mitochondrial proteins, the consensus prediction method showed a higher specificity at a reference sensitivity of 0.7 than the single predictions which contribute to the consensus (Table 1). The vast majority of the organellar test set proteins achieved consensus score values of 10 and above (up to 21) (data not shown). When used on the experimental sets of DNA-binding SET domain proteins (Springer et al. CITATION) (Table 2) and transcription factors (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6), we found again that those proteins with a confirmed localization (ATXR5, AtWhy1-3) had values of above 10. Our algorithm predicted high scores of 19.2 (AtWhy1), 17.1 (AtWhy3), 16.3 (ATXR5) and 10.6 (AtWhy2) for these proteins, respectively (Tables 2, 3, 4). Two more SET domain proteins also received high scores for plastids (At1g26760) and mitochondria (At5g06620) (Table 2), whereas the remaining 34 SET domain proteins were not indicated as being organelle-targeted by the prediction method. This is consistent with their confirmed (At1g02580, Choi et al. CITATION) or presumed location according to the SUBA proteomic database (Heazlewood et al. CITATION). Based on these results we decided to use 10 as cutoff value. Below this value the risk of contamination by false positives was observed to increase.[[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]] The Arabidopsis transcription factor database currently lists 1,747 different proteins from 50 transcription factor families. A similar list containing currently 2,309 different loci grouped in 53 transcription factor families was compiled for rice by the Rice Transcription Factor Database. The protein sequences from these lists were subjected to a search for targeting sequences to plastids and mitochondria. Among the Arabidopsis transcription factors, we identified 78 proteins that possess putative plastid targeting sequences (cTPs) and 12 proteins with a putative mitochondrial presequence. Fifty-one of the proteins with a cTP possess an additional sequence (NLS) that can target the protein to the nucleus, while 27 proteins lack such a sequence (Fig. 1). Of the 12 putative mitochondrial proteins 7 possess no additional targeting sequences while 5 contain a NLS (Fig. 1). Most of the proteins without known nuclear localization sequences have a molecular weight below 40 kDa and might thus not necessarily need a NLS for nuclear import. In rice, 80 proteins with a cTP and 23 proteins with a mitochondrial presequence possess a NLS. Furthermore, 40 proteins exclusively possess a cTP while 15 proteins have only a mitochondrial presequence (Fig. 1). In Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 these proteins are listed according to their affiliation with the different transcription factor families. [[FIGURE]]  Of the 50 Arabidopsis transcription factor families and the 53 transcription factor families of rice, 23 and 33, respectively, possess members with putative organellar presequences. These include large families with numerous members such as the C2H2 and CH3 zinc finger domain protein families or the AP2/EREBP proteins. On the other hand also small protein families like the GeBP or Whirly transcription factor families are included (Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6). Apart from the three Whirly proteins of Arabidopsis (Krause et al. CITATION, see Introduction), only three proteins from the list of identified proteins (At1g47870 alias E2FC, the GeBP protein At4g00270 and the GRAS protein At3g54220 alias Scarecrow) were so far analyzed for their subcellular localization using fluorescence-based techniques (proteins marked with asterisks in Tables 3, 4). All three were reported to be in the nucleus (Curaba et al. CITATION; Heidstra et al. CITATION; Koroleva et al. CITATION). However, in the case of the YFP-At4g00270 fusion, the confocal images showed more than one fluorescent spot per cell. These spots were not seen with a nuclear control construct (Curaba et al. CITATION) and can thus not be assigned to a specific compartment. A dual localization of this protein was, therefore, not refuted. Three transcription factors were identified by different mass spectrometric approaches but no confirmation of these by other methods exists. Only one (At4g00870) was identified as a nuclear protein (Bae et al. CITATION), whereas the other two (At5g27070, At5g38560) were detected in a plasma membrane fraction (Nuhse et al. CITATION). The AP2/EREBP protein family is among the families with the most putative plastid or mitochondrial targeting sequences (see Tables 3, 4, 5, 6). This protein family is defined by the AP2/EREBP domain which consists of 60–70 amino acids and is involved in DNA binding (Weigel CITATION). Based on the number of AP2/EREBP domains and other conserved motifs, the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family is divided into four subfamilies, the ERF subfamily, the APETALA2 (AP2) subfamily, the RAV subfamily and the DREB subfamily (Sakuma et al. CITATION). ERF and DREB subfamilies are both characterized by the possession of a single AP2/ERF domain and are thus often regarded as one protein family (Nakano et al. CITATION; Shigyo et al. CITATION). To analyze the phylogenetic position of the putative organellar proteins among the AP2/EREBP proteins, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with all 149 AP2 domain-containing proteins of Arabidopsis (not shown). Of the twelve putative plastid proteins, nine were identified as members of the DREB subfamily (Table 7). DREB proteins are reportedly involved in drought and low temperature stress responses in plant cells (Hao et al. CITATION; Sakuma et al. CITATION). Two of the other putative plastid proteins are members of the AP2 subfamily and a third one belongs to the RAV subfamily, whereas both putative mitochondrial proteins belong to the ERF subfamily (Table 7).[[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] For phylogenetic comparison of the individual putative organellar AP2 proteins from Arabidopsis and rice, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using only the sequences of the putative organellar proteins from both species (Fig. 2). The proteins were designated using the nomenclature defined by Nakano et al. (CITATION), where DREB proteins are represented by ERF groups I to IV and ERF proteins in senso stricto are represented by groups V to X. The phylogenetic tree showed that most Arabidopsis genes contain one or more closely related orthologues in rice, the only exceptions being the four Arabidopsis proteins belonging to group II of the ERF proteins (Fig. 2). No Arabidopsis orthologues could be found for any of the rice proteins belonging to groups XI to XIV which is consistent with previous observations (Nakano et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  The existence of homologous pairs or groups of putative organellar proteins in Arabidopsis and rice prompted us to search for related proteins in other species. For the AP2 protein from Arabidopsis that gained the highest chloroplast score and that is encoded by the gene locus At2g44940, several homologous proteins from both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species could be identified. These include a protein from maize (ZmDBF2), one from Triticum monococcum (TmCbf7), one from barley (HvCbf7), a protein from Medicago trunculata (MtERF) and one from potato that was deduced from the fused amino acid sequences of two overlapping EST sequences (StPPCBR81) (Fig. 3). A similar number of homologues were found for the gene product of At5g11190 that is putatively targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 3). Table 8 shows that all proteins from these species are strongly predicted to be targeted to either the plastids or the mitochondria. [[FIGURE]] [[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] An alignment of six sequences homologous to the At2g44940 gene product revealed a high sequence identity within the AP2 domain and, beyond that, the existence of further domains that are highly conserved (Fig. 4). AP2 domains are characterized by several well-conserved amino acids that constitute a putative amphipathic α-helix and are generally divided into a DNA-binding and an oligomerization domain. These domains can be either adjacent to each other or separated by a few amino acids (Riechmann and Meyerowitz CITATION; Liu et al. CITATION). In the present case, the two parts of the AP2 domain are separated by a stretch of basic amino acids that constitute the nuclear localization sequence (Fig. 4). The N terminus of each protein, although being considerably variable, is extremely rich in hydroxylated amino acids and in alanine, leucine and arginine and thus fulfils the classical features of chloroplast-targeting sequences (Bruce CITATION). Taken together, these findings indicate that this group of proteins has evolved before the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants have split up. [[FIGURE]]  For the AP2 protein encoded by the At2g44940 gene, GFP fusion constructs of the entire gene product or the putative plastid target peptide sequence were used to examine the localization of this protein. Transient expression of these fusion proteins in protoplasts from a light-grown mesophyll cell suspension culture from Arabidopsis thaliana showed that the GFP fused to the entire At2g44940 gene product is indeed targeted to both compartments (Fig. 5a). The dual localization confirmed that both of the targeting signals, i.e. the N-terminal plastid target peptide and the NLS were correctly predicted. However, we observed that most of the recombinant protein was located inside the nucleus, whereas the chloroplasts showed only weak fluorescence. We therefore fused only the putative plastid target peptide to GFP and transformed protoplasts with this construct. As expected, the GFP fluorescence coincided only with the chlorophyll autofluorescence of the chloroplasts and no nuclear signal was observed (Fig. 5b). [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! Predicted putative transcription factor sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained from the Arabidopsis Transcription Factor Database (Davuluri et al. CITATION; http://www.arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtTFDB). The gene names follow the AGI locus identifier and the annotation is based on TAIR v.6 (http://www.arabidopsis.org). The different loci coding for putative transcription factors of rice (Oryza sativa) were obtained from the Rice Transcription Factor Database (http://www.ricetfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de). The rice genes were named according to the TIGR locus identifier and the annotation is based on TIGR v.4 (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1). All predictions were based on a consensus prediction using a naïve Bayes method. For this, individual predictions of chloroplast and mitochondrial target peptides were performed by several publicly available web services (Table 1). These individual predictions were combined mathematically to a consensus score. In detail, two complementary hypotheses for the location of a protein in the chloroplast (and two more for the location in the mitochondrion) were tested: the hypothesis that a protein is located and the hypothesis that a protein is not located there, given a positive prediction. For each prediction program the likelihoods, i.e. the probability of a positive prediction regarding one or the other hypothesis, were evaluated by considering its prediction data for sets of plant proteins with known subcellular localization. Plant proteins for these test sets were selected from the UniProt database (Schneider et al. CITATION) or the Arabidopsis Subcellular Proteomic Database (Heazlewood et al. CITATION) (see supplemental files 1–3). Redundancy within the protein sets was reduced in a way that no two proteins shared greater than 40% sequence identity.[[TABLE]]  [[TABLE]] To combine the different methods, it was assumed that their predictions are independent of each other. This naïve assumption allowed us to compute the likelihood of the parameters given several prediction data simply as product of the individual likelihoods. The ratio of the posterior probabilities of both hypotheses was computed by $$ \frac{{p(c|a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots,a_{n})}}{{p(\bar{c}|a_{1}, a_{2}, ...,a_{n})}}= \frac{{p(c){\prod\limits_{i = 1}^n {p(a_{i} |c)^{{w_{i}}}}}}}{{p(\bar{c}){\prod\limits_{i = 1}^n {p(a_{i} |\bar{c})^{{w_{i}}}}}}} $$where c is the location of a protein in the chloroplast or mitochondrion, respectively, (the negation of c is written \({\bar{c}}\)) and a 1 to a n are the individual positive predictions. Based on predictions for the whole genomes of A. thaliana and O. sativa (data not shown), the chloroplast-targeted and mitochondrion-targeted proteins were estimated to constitute 15% and 12% of all open reading frames. p(c) for chloroplast-targeting was set, accordingly, to 0.15 and p(c) for mitochondrion-targeting to 0.12. The weight w i is given by the score value of the corresponding prediction program and was normalized to a value between 0 and 1. Programs without scoring (IPsort, WoLF-PSort) can be viewed as a special case of weighting where weights are restricted to either 0 or 1. The logarithm in base 2 of the ratio that resulted from this calculation was used as consensus score value. To show an improvement of this consensus method over each of the individual methods that contribute to it, the specificities of all methods were compared by applying them to the plant protein test sets described earlier (suppl. files 1–3). The specificity (computed as 1—false positives/all negatives) depends on the score value threshold (above which the prediction is positive) chosen for an individual prediction program. In general, a higher threshold generates a higher specificity but sacrifices sensitivity (computed as true positives/all positives). Therefore, the comparison of the specificities was based on a common reference sensitivity value. The specificity was evaluated after trimming the method score threshold to a value that results in a reference sensitivity of 0.7. This reference sensitivity was used for all further calculations. Protein and translated EST databases were examined for sequences homologous to Arabidopsis transcription factors using the blastp and tblastn tools of the BLAST program (Altschul et al. CITATION). The sequences were aligned using the Clustal X program (Thompson et al. CITATION). The sequence alignments were subsequently inspected and edited by hand as recommended by Harrison and Langdale (CITATION) using the graphical multiple sequence alignment editor (BioEdit v.7.0.5.3) in order to obtain optimal alignment and eliminate gap-rich stretches. Nuclear localization sequences were identified with the programs PredictNLS (Cokol et al. CITATION) and PSORT (Nakai and Horton CITATION). Unrooted trees were prepared by the neighbor joining method (Saitou and Nei CITATION) using Clustal X (v1.81) and TreeView (v1.5.2) with 1,000 replicates performed for obtaining bootstrap confidence values. The measure for the distances between sequences was percent divergence. The entire cDNA sequence and the sequence corresponding only to the plastid target peptide, respectively, were amplified by PCR using isolated cDNA from Arabidopsis. The PCR products were subsequently cloned, sequenced and then inserted in-frame in front of the gfp coding sequence using the binary gateway vector pBatTL-B-GFP2 that contains a double 35S promoter. Protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana were produced from Arabidopsis light-grown suspension culture cells according to the protocol of Negrutiu et al. (CITATION). The recombinant plasmids with the GFP fusion constructs were introduced into the protoplasts using PEG-mediated transformation (Negrutiu et al. CITATION). Transiently transformed cells were analyzed for GFP fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope.
