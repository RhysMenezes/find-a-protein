!~ABS~! PCA22 negatively regulates the drought response through the modulation of osmolytic components and regulates pollen tube length in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! In order to determine the key genes involved in cellular Pro metabolism in Arabidopsis, pca mutants were generated and characterized under dehydration conditions. Because atrzf1 is known to hyperaccumulate Pro in response to water deficit conditions ([CIT0016]et al., 2013), the activation-tagged T1 population was screened for decreased Pro concentration to drought stress compared with the atrzf1 mutant. atrzf1 mutants were transformed with Agrobacterium harboring the binary vector pSKI015, which contained four copies of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S enhancer at the right border of the T-DNA and a BAR (Bialaphos resistance) gene as a selectable marker ([CIT0038]et al., 2000). Transformants were selected on soil sprayed with BASTA and subsequently screened under drought condition (see the Materials and methods). Approximately 26 000 activation-tagged atrzf1 transgenic lines were screened and nine mutants were selected during drought stress. One of the mutant lines, pca22, was analyzed for further physiological and molecular characterization. Pro accumulation in the pca22 mutant was found to be similar under water deficit conditions to that of the WT, while the Pro content of pca22 was significantly lower than that of the atrzf1 mutant ([F1]). These results suggest that pca22 participates in the suppression of Pro production in atrzf1 mutants under drought conditions. Proline content in the leaves of WT, atrzf1, and pca22 plants. Light-grown 5-week-old plants were grown for 7 d without watering. Leaf tissues were carefully excised after drought treatment, and their proline content was measured. Error bars represent the SD. Differences among WT, atrzf1, and pca22 plants grown under the same conditions are significant at 0.01<P<0.05 (*). [CIT0016]et al. (2013) demonstrated that AtRZF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the drought response. Because the pca22 mutant was obtained from activation-tagged atrzf1 transgenic lines, it is likely to be related to abiotic stress responses. To determine whether pca22 could be associated with abiotic stress responses, we examined cotyledon greening in WT, atrzf1, and pca22 seedlings in the presence of mannitol, PEG, or ABA. The germination rate among the WT, atrzf1, and pca22 was similar and not poor in MS medium ([F2]; Supplementary Fig. S3B). In addition, developmental processes were not affected in the pca22 mutant (data not shown). Comparison of the pca22 and atrzf1 mutants demonstrated that significantly fewer cotyledons expanded and turned green after 8 d germination when grown on MS medium containing 400 mM mannitol, 10% PEG, or 1 μM ABA, whereas the cotyledon greening rate was similar between WT and pca22 seedlings, except under the 10% PEG condition ([F2]). These results showed that the pca22 mutant was more likely to be sensitive to abiotic stresses than the atrzf1 mutant. To evaluate further the response to drought stress, cut rosette water loss rates of the plants were estimated. To assess water loss from leaves, leaves of similar size, age, and positions on the WT, atrzf1, and pca22 were detached and measured for decreases in fresh weight, as described previously ([CIT0026]et al., 2001). After detachment, leaves from the pca22 mutant exhibited higher loss of fresh weight than those from atrzf1 through an experimental time course, while the rate of water loss was similar in WT and pca22 plants (Supplementary Fig. S1). Effect of the pca22 mutant on sensitivity to dehydration stress and ABA sensitivity. Effect of osmotic stress and ABA on cotyledon greening. Seeds were sown on MS agar plates supplemented with mannitol, PEG, or ABA and permitted to grow for 8 d; seedlings with green cotyledons were then counted (triplicates, n=50 each). Error bars represent the SD. Differences among WT, atrzf1, and pca22 plants grown under the same conditions are significant at 0.01<P<0.05 (*) or P<0.01 (**). In order to investigate the molecular changes associated with dehydration stress, we evaluated four genes, Responsive to Desiccation 29B (RD29B), Responsive to ABA 18 (RAB18), Delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR), and Delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), which are induced by various abiotic stresses ([CIT0031]; [CIT0024]et al., 2011). The transcript levels of dehydration-inducible genes were more markedly reduced in pca22 and WT lines than in atrzf1 mutants following mannitol treatment; however, the expression of the four genes was similar in WT and pca22 plants (Supplementary Fig. S2A–D). These observations support the notion that PCA22 regulates the expression of AtRZF1-mediated stress marker genes under dehydration stress conditions. [CIT0028]et al. (2004) demonstrated that AtbZIP11, a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor, is involved in hypo-osmolarity- and Pro-responsive expression of Pro dehydrogenase (PDH). The AtMYB2 transcription factor participates in the up-regulation of P5CS1 transcription ([CIT0041]et al., 2005). As shown in Supplemetnary Fig. S2E and F, rehydration-induced expression of AtbZIP11 was significantly reduced in the atrzf1 mutant, in comparison with that in WT and pca22 plants under dehydration conditions; however, the transcript level of AtMYB2 increased more in atrzf1 than in WT and pca22 plants. These results indicate that molecular events associated with Pro content were reduced more in pca22 than in the atrzf1 mutant. To identify the position of the T-DNA insertion site and the activated gene, TAIL-PCR was performed on the pca22 mutant using primers from both ends of the LB and AD primers (Supplementary Table S1). The sequences flanking the LB region obtained from analysis of the TAIL-PCR products were subjected to a BLAST search, and a single insertion site was mapped in pca22. The T-DNA insertion in pca22 was located on the intergenic region between the two genes, At2g28625 and At2g28630, which encode an unknown protein and KCS12, respectively ([F3]). The T-DNA locus in pca22 was found close to At2g28625 ([F3]). To characterize further the T-DNA-associated DNA sequence, specific primers (F1 and R1) were designed (Supplementary Table S1) and used in combination with T-DNA-specific LB3 primers to confirm the insertion site within the WT, atrzf1, and pca22 genome ([F3], [F3]). To genotype the locus, PCR primers F1 and R1 were used to amplify the WT and atrzf1 sequences, while primers F1 and LB3 were used to detect the pca22 mutant. Using the F1–LB3 primer pair, only the pca22 mutant but not the WT or atrzf1 mutant could be amplified by PCR ([F3]). Furthermore, RT–PCR indicated that the AtRZF1 transcript accumulated in 10-day-old WT seedlings, but was not detectable in atrzf1 and pca22 mutant seedlings ([F3]). PCR-based genotyping analyses showed that the T-DNA insertion co-segregated with the pca22 phenotype. Identification of 35S enhancer elements containing the T-DNA insertion region in pca22. (A) A map of the T-DNA insertion of pca22 on chromosome 2. The structure of the activation-tagged locus of pca22 is shown in the flanking region containing At2g28625 and At2g28630. The arrows mark the positions of gene-specific primers and a T-DNA LB-specific primer used for PCR amplification. (B) T-DNA linkage analysis of the pca22 phenotype. Genomic PCR using the gene-specific primers F1 and R1 yielded a DNA band specific for the WT and atrzf1 lines at the PCA22 locus, whereas PCR using primers F1 and LB3 produced a pca22-specific band. (C) RT–PCR to compare the transcript levels of AtRZF1 and ACT1 control genes in WT, atrzf1, and pca22 mutants. (D) Expression of the three neighboring genes (At2g28620, At2g28625, and At2g28630) encoding a functional protein near the activation-tagged locus was analyzed in pca22 plants and compared with those in atrzf1 by RT–PCR. ACT1 was used as an internal control for RT–PCR. Because the original pca22 mutant was identified in the T1 generation, it was expected to be a gain-of-function mutant. Therefore, we examined which neighboring genes would be overexpressed owing to the four copies of the CaMV 35S enhancer elements in the activation tagging vector. In order to test the hypothesis, we used an RT–PCR approach. Through several approaches using different primer pairs in the RT–PCR analyses (Supplementary Table S1), we only detected the At2g28625 gene, which was up-regulated in the pca22 mutant among the three genes near to the T-DNA insertion site ([F3]). These results suggested that the activated At2g28625 gene was tightly linked with the pca22 mutant phenotype. The At2g28625 gene was therefore designated as PCA22. To gain insight into the function of the PCA22 gene, we attempted to isolate this gene in Arabidopsis. The isolated cDNA sequence comprised 297 bp and harbored one single ORF encoding a protein of 98 amino acids with a calculated mol. wt of 37.82 kDa, which displayed 80–89% identity with unknown proteins in Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, Brassica rapa, and Eutrema salsugineum ([F4], [F4]). BLAST analysis revealed the presence of only a single copy of the gene in the Arabidopsis (Col-0) genome. Based on its amino acid sequence, one highly conserved serine-rich domain in the central region was identified in the homologous proteins, although no function was assigned to this region ([F4]). Alignment of the full-length deduced amino acid sequences of PCA22 and PCA22 orthologs from different phylogenetic origins. (A) Shown are the sequences of PCA22 (At2g28625), Camelina sativa XP010510600, Camelina sativa XP010414496, Camelina sativa XP010470060, Capsella rubella XP006295935, Brassica rapa XP009140926, and Eutrema salsugineum XP006409894. Black and gray shading indicate identical and similar amino acids, respectively. Gaps were used to optimize the alignment. (B) Phylogenetic tree depicting homology relationships among Arabidopsis thaliana, C. sativa, C. rubella, B. rapa, and E. salsugineum PCA22 members. Numbers at branch points indicate bootstrap values after 1000 replications. (C) The structure of the conserved regions of the PCA22 protein. The primary structure contains a serine-rich box (9–70) within its central region, which is indicated by the gray box. To demonstrate that activated PCA22 is responsible for the pca22 mutant phenotype, PCA22 full-length cDNA under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter was transferred into the atrzf1 mutant. Fourteen homozygous lines (T3 generation) were obtained, and two lines (OE1/atrzf1 and OE2/atrzf1) exhibiting high levels of transgene expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A) were selected for phenotypic characterization. Comparison of the OE1/atrzf1 and OE2/atrzf1 transgenic plants with the atrzf1 mutant demonstrated significantly fewer expanded and green cotyledons 6, 7, 8, and 9 days after germination (DAG) when grown on MS medium containing 400 mM mannitol, 10% PEG, or 1 μM ABA. Conversely, the cotyledon greening rate was similar between pca22 and OE1/atrzf1 and OE2/atrzf1 transgenic plants ([F5]; Supplemetnary Fig. S3B). Taken together, our results demonstrated that overexpression of the PCA22 gene was able to suppress the dehydration- and ABA-insensitive phenotype of the atrzf1 mutant. We also examined the accumulation of Pro in complementation lines (OE1/atrzf1 and OE2/atrzf1) under 400 mM mannitol, 10% PEG, and drought conditions. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A, Pro accumulation in the complementation lines was similar under dehydration conditions compared with the WT and pca22, but was significantly lower compared with the atrzf1 mutant. The magnitude of Pro induction of drought conditions in atrzf1 was greater than that of mannitol and PEG conditions, while induction of Pro in response to mannitol was similar with that of PEG treatment. The complementation results demonstrate that the overexpression of PCA22 in the atrzf1 line is responsible for the dehydration and ABA sensitivity of the pca22 mutant. Mannitol, PEG, and ABA sensitivity as a result of PCA22 overexpression in atrzf1 mutants. (A–C) The effects of mannitol, PEG, and ABA treatment on cotyledon greening. Seeds were sown on MS agar plates supplemented with 400 mM mannitol (A), 10% PEG (B), or 1 μM ABA (C), and permitted to grow for 6, 7, 8, and 9 days after germination (DAG). Seedlings with green cotyledons were counted (triplicates, n=50 each). Error bars represent the SD. Differences between wild-type and transgenic plants grown under the same conditions are significant at 0.05>P>0.01 (*) or P<0.01 (**). Previous studies showed increases in the MDA content in plants subjected to drought stress ([CIT0037]et al., 2014; [CIT0043]). To investigate the effect of drought stress on lipid peroxidation, we measured the MDA content in WT, atrzf1, pca22, and complementation lines (OE1/atrzf1 and OE2/atrzf1). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4B, the MDA contents did not differ substantially among the WT, atrzf1, pca22, and complementation lines under normal conditions. The MDA content in all the plants was raised by drought stress. The MDA level in atrzf1 was lowerthan that in the WT, whereas pca22 and complementation lines displayed significantly higher MDA contents than the WT after drought stress (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Thus, PCA22 is involved in the production of lipid peroxidation by drought stress. To investigate the function of PCA22, we initially assessed its expression pattern. The results of qPCR experiments demonstrated that PCA22 was expressed relatively strongly in flowers, weakly in roots, and very weakly in rosette leaves and stems (Supplementary Fig. S5). Next, in an effort to determine the in vivo functions of PCA22, we assessed the accumulation of PCA22 RNA in Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to mannitol, PEG, drought, and ABA treatment using qPCR. As shown in [F6], PCA22 was reduced significantly in 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings within 6 h of mannitol, PEG, or ABA treatment. Samples subjected to drought stress also showed a significant reduction in PCA22 expression in whole plants of 26-day-old seedlings ([F6]). PCA22 expression was reduced under abiotic stress, in contrast to expression of the control RAB18 and RD29A genes ([CIT0031]), which was induced strongly ([F6]). PCA22 expression in Arabidopsis plants grown under abiotic stress conditions. (A–D) qPCR analyses showing the expression of PCA22, RAB18, and RD29A in response to abiotic stress conditions. All quantifications were made in three independent RNA samples obtained from plants treated with 400 mM mannitol (A), 10% PEG (B), drought (C), and 100 μM ABA (D) for the indicated times. Error bars indicate the SD of three independent biological samples. Differences among the expression of PCA22, RAB18, or RD29A in Arabidopsis seedlings with and without treatment with various abiotic stresses are significant at 0.05>P>0.01 (*) or P<0.01 (**). To assess the subcellular localization of PCA22, a CaMV 35S promoter (35S)-driven fusion gene (35S-PCA22–GFP) from PCA22 cDNA was constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis. Using phosphinothricin resistance segregation, we selected homozygous plants for 35S-PCA22–GFP. The fluorescence of the 35S-PCA22–GFP construct was found to be quite strong in the cytoplasm of the root cells in transgenic seedlings ([F7]). Cytoplasmic localization of PCA22. Five-day-old transgenic plants grown on half-strength MS agar medium were analyzed for GFP expression by confocal microscopy. The PCA22–GFP signal was mainly observed in the cytoplasm of the root cells. GFP, green fluorescent protein; B/W, black and white. Scale bars=100 μm. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.) To investigate the in vivo function of PCA22, PCA22 overexpression was induced in Arabidopsis under the control of the 35S promoter. Eleven homozygous lines (T3 generation) were obtained, and two lines (OX12 and OX16) exhibiting high levels of transgene expression (Supplementary Fig. S6A) were selected for phenotypic characterization. In an effort to evaluate further the functional consequence of the loss of PCA22, RNAi lines (pca22ri) were generated using full-length cDNA sequences. PCA22 expression was assessed by RT–PCR in two randomly selected independent pca22ri lines (ri14 and ri27). PCA22 expression was knocked down in the RNAi lines (Supplementary Fig. S6B), and the effects of mannitol, PEG, and ABA on cotyledon greening efficiency in the PCA22 transgenic lines were tested. Seeds of WT, pca22ri, and PCA22-overexpressing plants were grown on sterile medium containing 400 mM mannitol, 10% PEG, or 1 μM ABA. The percentage of germinated seeds was calculated from the number of seedlings with cotyledon greening 7, 8, and 9 DAG. WT, pca22ri, and PCA22-overexpressing seeds germinated almost evenly under normal conditions; however, in the presence of 400 mM mannitol, ~32.7% of the WT seeds and only 4.3% (range 2.4–6.1%) of the PCA22-overexpressing seeds germinated for 8 DAG ([F8]; Supplemetnary Fig. S6C). In contrast, ~54.3% (range 52.1–56.4%) of the pca22ri seeds germinated in the presence of mannitol. At 10% PEG, ~13% (range 10.1–15.8%) of PCA22-overexpressing seeds germinated for 8 DAG, while this increased to 39.3% and ~49.2% (range 47.1–51.3%) for WT and RNAi seeds, respectively ([F8]; Supplementary Fig. S6D). When permitted to grow for 8 DAG prior to the assessment of cotyledon greening rates in the PCA22-overexpressing plants in response to ABA, 44% of the WT leaves expanded and turned green, as compared with ~59.8% (range 56.7–62.9%) in the pca22ri lines (ri14 and ri27). Conversely, ~18% (range 12.7–23.3%) of two PCA22-overexpressing transgenic lines survived 8 DAG ([F8]; Supplementary Fig. S6E). These results show that pca22ri lines are more likely to be insensitive to dehydration and ABA stresses than the WT. However, the PCA22-overexpressing plants were shown to be more sensitive to dehydration stress and ABA than the WT and pca22ri plants. Abiotic stress sensitivity of PCA22 transgenic plants. (A–C) Effect of mannitol, PEG, and ABA treatment on cotyledon greening. Seeds were sown on MS agar plates supplemented with 400 mM mannitol (A), 10% PEG (B), or 1 μM ABA (C), and were permitted to grow for 7, 8, and 9 days after germination (DAG). Seedlings with green cotyledons were counted (triplicates; n=50 each). Error bars represent the SD. Differences between WT and transgenic plants grown under the same conditions are significant at 0.05>P>0.01 (*) or P<0.01 (**). Pro content in different lines was also determined. Under normal, unstressed conditions, the Pro content was similar in all lines (data not shown). During drought stress conditions, a significant increase in Pro content was observed in pca22ri lines (ri14 and ri27), but the decrease was more marked in PCA22-overexpressing transgenic lines (OX12 and OX16) than in the WT (Supplementnary Fig. S7). These results indicate that disruption of PCA22 expression promotes Pro accumulation. Because PCA22 transcripts accumulate at high levels, especially in flower organs (Supplementary Fig. S5), it would be interesting to evaluate whether PCA22 is associated with pollen tube growth. Several papers also reported that Pro is considered an important flowering signal during pollen tube germination and fertilization because it accumulates markedly in reproductive tissues ([CIT0029]et al., 1999; [CIT0009]et al., 2012). To determine whether PCA22 is associated with pollen tube growth, we measured pollen tubes in vitro after 12 h pollen germination. As shown in [F9] and Supplementary Fig. S8, pca22 pollen tubes were shorter than WT and atrzf1 pollen tubes. However, the average length of atrzf1 pollen tubes was longer than that of the WT pollen tubes ([F9]). The atrzf1 pollen tubes were similar in appearance to pca22ri (ri14 and ri27) pollen tubes. Quantification of the lengths of WT and PCA22-overexpressing (OX12 and OX16) pollen tubes revealed a significant difference in their length. Pollen from both PCA22-overexpressing lines formed relatively short pollen tubes ([F9]). From this, we concluded that PCA22 can regulate the length of pollen tubes. Length of in vitro grown WT, atrzf1, pca22, and PCA22 transgenic pollen tubes. After 12 h pollen germination, the lengths of 150 pollen tubes from each line were measured. pca22 and PCA22-overexpressing (OX12 and OX16) pollen tubes were significantly shorter than WT, atrzf1, and pca22ri (ri14 and ri27) pollen tubes. Error bars represent the SD. Differences among WT, atrzf1, pca22, PCA22-overexpressing (OX12, OX16), and pca22ri (ri14, ri27) lines grown under the same conditions are significant at 0.05>P>0.01 (*) or P<0.01 (**).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia (Col-0) and atrzf1 were used as the WT and background lines for suppressor screening, respectively. To observe phenotypic changes, the seeds were sown directly in pots containing a vermiculite:soil (1:2) mixture under growth room conditions (16 h light/8 h dark, 21 ± 2 °C, and 60 ± 5% relative humidity). Otherwise, the seeds were sown onto Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing 0.8% agar after sterilization with 75% ethanol containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 10 min. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were challenged with dehydration stress by submersion in a solution containing 10% PEG [electrical conductivity (EC)=63.8 μS cm−1 and ψs= −0.34 MPa] or 400 mM mannitol (EC=1.2 μS cm−1 and ψs= −1.2 MPa). Samples were collected following 0, 3, and 6 h dehydration stress. For ABA, 10-day-old seedlings were submerged in a solution containing 100 μM ABA as previously described ([CIT0045]et al., 2009) and sampled at 0, 3, and 6 h. For drought stress, seedlings were grown in pots subjected to normal watering every 4 d. After 10 d, the plants were divided into two groups for stress treatments. One group was subjected to drought stress (relative water content=69.34 ± 3.6%) by withholding water for 12 d, and a control group was watered normally. In each case, the retrieved seedlings were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. atrzf1 mutants were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 containing the pSKI015 plasmid ([CIT0038]et al., 2000) by the vacuum infiltration method ([CIT0002]). Seeds collected from infiltrated atrzf1 mutants were sterilized with sodium hypochlorite, stored at 4 °C for 2 d, and sown directly in soil. Activation-tagged transgenic atrzf1 mutants (T1 generation plants) were selected by spraying 0.5% BASTA (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) once every 3 d for 2 weeks, and were visually inspected to identify plants exhibiting WT-like morphology. We selected ~26 000 BASTA-resistant T1 generation lines. Because atrzf1 is known for the hyperaccumulation of Pro in response to water deficit conditions, the T1 population was screened for decreased Pro concentration to drought stress compared with the atrzf1 mutant. To isolate pca mutants, the pattern of Pro accumulation was initially assessed in excised leaves from 5-week-old T1 plants and atrzf1 mutants subjected to drought-induced Pro accumulation following 7 d drought. Nine putative suppressor mutants were identified in the first screen and were grown to produce seeds. BASTA resistance in T2 generation plants from selected suppressor mutants segregated as a single locus. Then, seeds of putative suppressors (T4) were sown on dehydration medium (400 mM mannitol and 10% PEG) to confirm the sensitive phenotype. After analyses, nine homozygous lines with suppressed atrzf1 insensitivity to dehydration conditions during cotyledon greening were isolated; one of these (pca22) is characterized in the present study. Pro contents were measured as previously described ([CIT0001]et al., 1973). Briefly, Pro was extracted from 100 mg of plant leaves by grinding in 1 ml of 3% sulfosalicylic acid. A 200 μl aliquot of extract was reacted with 100 μl of the ninhydrin reagent mixture (80% glacial acetic acid, 6.8% phosphoric acid, and 70.17 mM ninhydrin) for 60 min at 100 °C. An ice bath was used to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was extracted with 200 μl of toluene and vortexed. Absorbance of the toluene layer was read at 520 nm in a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The Pro concentration was extrapolated from a standard curve, and calculated on an FW basis as follows: [(ng proline ml–1×ml extraction buffer)/115.5 ng nmol] g–1 sample=nmol proline g–1 FW material. The level of membrane damage was determined by measuring MDA as an end-product of membrane lipid peroxidation as previously described ([CIT0013]et al., 1999; [CIT0044]et al., 2012). The samples were homogenized in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000 rpm and the supernatant was collected. A 1 ml aliquot of 10% (w/v) TCA containing 0.6% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid (TBA) was added to a 0.5 ml aliquot of the supernatant. The mixture was then maintained for 15 min in a boiling water bath and then quickly cooled on ice. The absorbance of the colored supernatant was measured at 532 nm (A532) and was corrected for non-specific absorbance at 450 nm (A450) and 600 nm (A600). The MDA content was calculated with the equation: MDA=6.45(A532−A600)−0.56×A450 ([CIT0013]et al., 1999; [CIT0044]et al., 2012). For relative water content values, detached rosette leaves were placed on open-lid Petri dishes at room temperature with 60% humidity under dim light. The weights of rosette leaves were measured at various times. Leaf water content was expressed as the percentage of initial fresh weight. For each comparison, seeds of all genotypes were planted in the same plate containing MS medium with or without mannitol (400 mM), PEG (10%), or ABA (1 μM). For each experiment, three technical replicates were performed. Seeds used for these experiments were harvested and stored. Cotyledon greening was recorded on days 9–12 after the seeds were sown, depending on the experiment. Cotyledon greening was defined as visible expansion and greening of the cotyledon. Each experiment included 50 seeds of each genotype. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen samples using the Plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). To remove any residual genomic DNA in the preparation, the RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). The concentration of RNA was quantified accurately via spectrophotometric measurements, and 5 μg of total RNA was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gels to determine the concentration and monitor the integrity. qPCR was carried out with a Rotor-Gene 6000 quantitative PCR apparatus (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia) and the results were analyzed using RG6000 1.7 software (Corbett Research). Total RNA was extracted from treated 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings using an RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). qPCR was carried out using the SensiMix One-Step kit (Quantance, London, UK). Arabidopsis Actin1 (ACT1) was used as the internal control. Quantitative analysis was carried out using the ΔΔ-CT method ([CIT0020]). Each sample was run in three independent experiments. The reaction primers utilized are shown in Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online. RT–PCR was employed to measure the levels of At2g28620, At2g28625 (PCA22), At2g28630 [Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase 12 (KCS12)], AtRZF1, and ACT1 expression in plants of each genotype. A 500 ng aliquot of total RNA was used in the RT–PCR, and the reaction primers utilized are shown in Supplementary Table S1. After 27 PCR amplification cycles, 20 µl of each RT–PCR product were loaded onto a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in order to visualize the amplified DNAs. Genomic DNA was isolated from pca22 mutants and thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR was performed using arbitrary degenerate (AD) and T-DNA left border (LB) end primers ([CIT0019]et al., 1995) (Supplementary Table S1). Purified fragments following tertiary TAIL-PCR were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for DNA sequence analysis, and the flanking sequences obtained were used to perform a BLAST search using the NCBI program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Finally, specific primers were designed (Supplementary Table S1) and used in combination with the T-DNA-LB primer to amplify specific fragments, which were subsequently sequenced to confirm the T-DNA insertion site. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis leaves using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To construct the PCA22 overexpression lines, the full-length PCA22 cDNA (At2g28625) was amplified using RT–PCR and the generated product was cloned into the pDONR/ZEO vector (Invitrogen) for DNA sequence analysis. The RT–PCR primers were as follows: forward 5'- GGGGACAAGTTT GTACAAAAAAGC AGGCTTCATGAACG AAGAGGAGAGAGTTGG-3' and reverse 5'- GGGGACCAC TTTGTACAAGA AAGCTGGGT CACAAAGGCAA CCACAACATCTCT-3'. Amplification proceeded for 35 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s; 57 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR-amplified products were then directionally cloned into the plant expression vector pGWB514. The resultant construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and the atrzf1 mutant for the complementation lines, and into Arabidopsis (Col-0) for overexpression lines, via in planta vacuum infiltration. T3 homozygous transgenic lines were selected for phenotypic characterization. Hygromycin B (A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA) resistance of the T2 generation from these selected lines segregated as a single locus. To generate the PCA22 RNAi lines, the gene-specific cDNA fragment of PCA22 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTT CATGAACGAAGAGGAGAGAGTTGG-3' and reverse primer 5'-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGG TCACAAAGGCAACCACAACATCTCT-3'. The PCR products were initially cloned into the entry vector pDONR/ZEO and confirmed by sequencing. Then, this RNAi PCA22 cDNA construct was subcloned into the destination vector pB7GWIWG2ii ([CIT0017]et al., 2002) under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. The construct was then transformed into Arabidopsis plants, and the resultant T3 homozygous transgenic PCA22 RNAi lines (ri14 and ri27) were evaluated for ABA and abiotic stress sensitivity. To analyze the subcellular localization of the PCA22 protein in transgenic Arabidopsis, the PCA22 cDNA fragment was amplified using the following primers: 5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAA GCAGGCTTCATGAACGAAGAGGAGAGAGTTGG-3' and 5'-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAC AAAGGCAACCACAACATCTCT-3' on the basis of the sequence information deposited in a cDNA database (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). PCR products were inserted into the pEarleyGate103 vector under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the new construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To determine the intracellular localization of PCA22–GFP fusion proteins in transgenic plants, root samples were mounted on microscope slides and observed using a FluoView1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Confocal images were obtained and processed using FV10-ASW 1.7A computer software (Olympus). Pollen germination in vitro followed a modified version of the protocol described by [CIT0018]et al. (1999). In brief, pollen harvested from newly fully opened flowers was placed on the surface of pollen germination medium [1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM boric acid, 0.5% (w/v) agarose, 18% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7] and incubated at 28 °C for 12 h. Pollen grains obtained from WT, atrzf1 mutant, pca22 mutant, and PCA22 transgenic plants were germinated for 12 h in vitro. Pollen tube length was determined from digital micrographs acquired via light microscopy. Three independent replicates were performed, and for each replicate at least 150 pollen tubes were assessed to obtain a mean value for subsequent statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel and SPSS (Ver. 21.0, IBM, USA). ANOVA was used to compare statistical differences based on the Student’s t-test, at a significant level of 0.01<P<0.05, or P<0.01.
