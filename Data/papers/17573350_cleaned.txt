!~ABS~! In Arabidopsis the NRT2.1 gene encodes a main component of the root high-affinity nitrate uptake system (HATS). Its regulation has been thoroughly studied showing a strong correlation between NRT2.1 expression and HATS activity. Despite its central role in plant nutrition, nothing is known concerning localization and regulation of NRT2.1 at the protein level. By combining a green fluorescent protein fusion strategy and an immunological approach, we show that NRT2.1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane of root cortical and epidermal cells, and that several forms of the protein seems to co-exist in cell membranes (the monomer and at least one higher molecular weight complex). The monomer is the most abundant form of NRT2.1, and seems to be the one involved in transport. It strictly requires the NAR2.1 protein to be expressed and addressed at the plasma membrane. No rapid changes in NRT2.1 abundance were observed in response to light, sucrose, or nitrogen treatments that strongly affect both NRT2.1 mRNA level and HATS activity. This suggests the occurrence of post-translational regulatory mechanisms. One such mechanism could correspond to the cleavage of NRT2.1 C terminus, which results in the presence of both intact and truncated proteins in the plasma membrane. 
!~RES~! Tissular and Subcellular Localization of NRT2.1—To investigate the localization of NRT2.1 in the roots, NRT2.1-GFP transgenic lines were generated by expressing a GFP-tagged NRT2.1 protein (C-terminal translational fusion) in the nrt2.1-1 knock-out mutant of NRT2.1. The GFP coding sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the NRT2.1 gene under the control of its own promoter. Two transgenic lines (GFP10 and GFP12) displayed both a correct regulation of the expression of the transgene and a functional complementation of the mutant phenotype (supplemental materials Fig. S1). In these lines, the expression of PNRT2.1-NRT2.1-GFP was induced by both light and sucrose in the roots, as it was the case for NRT2.1 in WT plants. The HATS activity, determined by root 15 influx assays (0.2 mm external 15 concentration), was also stimulated by the light/sucrose treatments in both GFP10 and GFP12 plants, and restored at higher values than those measured in the nrt2.1-1 mutant.   [[FIGURE]] Cell-type specific expression of NRT2.1-GFP was therefore studied by confocal microscopy in both GFP10 and GFP12 plants grown in vitro. In roots of GFP10 plants, GFP fluorescence was mainly localized in the cortical cells along the primary and secondary roots (Fig. 1, A and C), except in the apical part of these roots where GFP was not present (Fig. 1B). No fluorescence was detected in the stele of the roots (Fig. 1C), and in the leaves (results not shown). These results were confirmed using the GFP12 line (data not shown). In plants grown hydroponically, NRT2.1-GFP was also found in mature regions of the roots, where in addition to the cortex, it was also expressed in the epidermal cells, and in root hairs (Fig. 1D).  The subcellular localization of the NRT2.1-GFP protein was investigated in roots of plants grown in vitro, using specific markers for cellular membranes. The PM and the tonoplast were visualized after a short and a long incubation with the red fluorescent dye FM4-64, respectively (47). After a short incubation time (5 min), FM4-64 fluorescence co-localized with that recorded from NRT2.1-GFP, yielding a yellow staining of the PM in the overlaid image (Fig. 1, E-G). After a prolonged incubation time (16 h), FM4-64 fluorescence had entirely moved to the tonoplast and became clearly distinguishable from the GFP fluorescence in the overlaid image (Fig. 1, H-J). Finally, to test the presence of NRT2.1-GFP in the ER, plants were treated with the vital ER Tracker blue-white DPX. Images showed blue staining of the ER around the nucleus, which co-localized with NRT2.1-GFP fluorescence in the overlaid image (Fig. 1, K-M). Despite the fact that the spatial resolution of these images may not be sufficient to allocate NRT2.1 to one specific membrane, they do show that NRT2.1 is not in the tonoplast, and suggest that this protein is localized in both the PM and ER.  Immunochemical Characterization of NRT2.1 in Root Cell Membranes—To further investigate NRT2.1 at the protein level, two specific polyclonal antibodies, called anti-NRT2.1 19 and anti-NRT2.1 20, were raised in rabbit against specific peptidic sequences within, respectively, an internal loop and the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2A). The affinity-purified anti-NRT2.1 antibodies were tested on Western blots with total microsomal membranes purified from roots of hydroponically grown WT plants or nrt2.1-1 and nrt2.1-2 knock-out mutants (16, 18). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, both anti-NRT2.1 antibodies revealed several bands at ∼45, ∼75, and ∼100-120 kDa. An additional band at ∼60 kDa was found with the anti-NRT2.1 19 antibody, but not with the anti-NRT2.1 20 antibody. These bands were all specific for NRT2.1 because they were absent in the microsomes from the two nrt2.1 knock-out mutants. For all the bands, the anti-NRT2.1 20 antibody always gave the strongest signal and was thus preferentially used in most of the experiments. In PM-enriched fractions, only the bands at ∼45 and ∼100-120 kDa were visible (Fig. 2D). With both antibodies the strong band observed at ∼45 kDa was by far the most abundant form of NRT2.1 in both microsomes and PM because it could be readily observed after a few minutes of exposure to film. By contrast, several hours were required to get a visible signal for the other ones. It is likely that the band at ∼45 kDa corresponds to the monomeric isolated form of NRT2.1. The apparent size of ∼45 kDa differs from its theoretical molecular mass of 57 kDa. However, this may be due to the hydrophobic nature of the protein, as already seen with previously characterized sugar (48), ammonium (49), and nitrate transporters (50, 51), which all display in Western blots an apparent lower molecular mass than the theoretical one. The bands at ∼75 and ∼100-120 kDa may reveal higher molecular mass complexes incorporating NRT2.1. For simplicity, the highest molecular mass band is referred to as the ∼120-kDa complex in the following text, although its apparent size was found to vary between 100 and 150 kDa, depending on the blots.   [[FIGURE]] To make sure that the ∼45-kDa band, corresponding to the isolated form of NRT2.1, is actually present in the native PM, and is not a product resulting from the dissociation of the higher molecular mass complexes, we performed in vivo cross-linking to stabilize protein complexes before PM extraction. Cross-linking was induced by adding 1% formaldehyde to the nutrient solution 45 min prior to harvesting for PM extraction. This markedly improved the detection of the band at ∼120 kDa (Fig. 2E). However, this did not lead to the disappearance or a decrease in the intensity of the band at ∼45 kDa, which remained strongly predominant in PM from plants treated with formaldehyde. As a control for the efficiency of protein-protein cross-linking, the same blot was probed with an anti-PIP2 antibody (Fig. 2F). PIP2 is a plasma membrane aquaporin that assembles in membranes as tetramers (52). Without cross-linking, only a monomer at 26-29 kDa and a dimer at 52 kDa of PIP2 were immunodetected on SDS-PAGE gels (43). By contrast a trimer at 75 kDa and a tetramer at 100 kDa were clearly immunodetected upon in vivo cross-linking. This last result validates the efficiency of formaldehyde-induced cross-linking.  Role of NAR2.1 in the Expression and Localization of NRT2.1—It has been recently suggested that the HATS in Arabidopsis may actually be a dual component transport system, involving both NRT2.1 and NAR2.1 proteins (19, 24, 25). Thus, a possibility would be that the high molecular mass bands at ∼75 and ∼120 kDa correspond to NRT2.1/NAR2.1 complexes. To investigate this hypothesis, we used the nar2.1-1 knock-out mutant for NAR2.1 (19) (also named nrt3.1-2 in Ref. 25) to perform Western blots on microsomes in comparison with the wild-type Wassilewskija. Before extraction of microsomes, plants were treated with 1% formaldehyde during 45 min to induce in vivo protein cross-linking. The data obtained showed that the band at ∼120 kDa is only slightly affected in the mutant nar2.1-1 compared with the WT, whereas the band at ∼75 kDa, and surprisingly the major one at ∼45 kDa, disappeared completely in the mutant microsomes (Fig. 3, A and B). The absence of the major form of NRT2.1 in the nar2.1-1 mutant was also found using PM fractions (data not shown), and was not due to a defect in NRT2.1 gene expression because in our conditions, the NAR2.1 mutation did not affect NRT2.1 mRNA accumulation in the roots (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the analysis of transgenic lines expressing a P35S-GFP-NRT2.1 transgene either in a wild-type, or in a nar2.1-1 background confirmed this result because despite ectopic expression of the transgene, NAR2.1 mutation resulted in an almost complete loss of GFP fluorescence associated with the PM (Figs. 3, D-L).  Regulation of NRT2.1 Abundance by Light, Sugars, and Nitrogen—To determine whether the abundance of NRT2.1 is regulated like NRT2.1 expression and HATS activity, ELISA and Western blots were performed with PM or microsomes extracted from WT plants during a light/dark cycle and after various sugar or nitrogen treatments.  To study the regulation of NRT2.1 in response to light and sugars, PM were isolated from plants harvested at the end of a normal light period (5 p.m.), or after 4 h into the night (9 p.m.) with or without 1% sucrose supply (Fig. 4, A-C). These treatments strongly affect both NRT2.1 mRNA accumulation and HATS activity because both decreases more than 50% after 4 h of darkness, but remain high when sucrose is supplied after the light/dark transition (30, 32) (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, Western blots did not reveal any significant changes in the abundance of the main form of NRT2.1 (at ∼45 kDa) between the end of the light period and after 4 h in the dark with or without sucrose (Fig. 4A). Quantitative analysis by ELISA confirmed this result, showing that the total amount of NRT2.1 in the PM was not decreased after 4 h of darkness, and not increased by sugar supply in the dark (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, NRT2.1 abundance did not show any change at the beginning of the light period, when plants were illuminated for 4 h following the usual night period (Fig. 4, D and E). Sucrose supply also failed to increase the NRT2.1 level even during an extended 4-h dark period after the 16 h of normal night (Fig. 4, D and E). Concerning the band at ∼120 kDa, it was detected in almost all PM extracts from plants in light or darkness, with roughly the same intensity (Fig. 4, A and D). These results, obtained with both anti-NRT2.1 antibodies, are representative of several independent experiments, leading to the conclusion that the abundance of NRT2.1 (at ∼45 kDa) is neither regulated during the diurnal cycle, nor by short-term sucrose supply. Nevertheless, the amount of NRT2.1 in root PM did show a slight (but statistically significant) increase in response to light and sucrose supply following a 40-h prolonged period of darkness (supplemental materials Fig. S2). This increase remained, however, much lower than that observed at the mRNA level.   [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the changes in NRT2.1 abundance in response to long-term treatments down-regulating both NRT2.1 expression and HATS activity, we shifted to the study of the repressive effect of high nitrogen supply to the plants, because we found this more physiologically relevant than several days of extended darkness. Therefore, we compared hydroponically grown plants provided with 1 mm KNO3 as a nitrogen source, or transferred either to nonrepressive, moderately repressive, or highly repressive media (0.3 mm KNO3, 5 mm KNO3, or 10 mm NH4NO3, respectively). These treatments are known to strongly affect NRT2.1 mRNA accumulation within a few hours (11, 30, 33). A significant difference was observed in the abundance of both the main form of NRT2.1 at ∼45 kDa and the protein complex at ∼120 kDa in the root PM between plants supplied with 0.3 mm KNO3 or 10 mm NH4NO3 for 7 days (Fig. 5, C and D). Both bands were clearly more intense under 0.3 mm KNO3 conditions, suggesting regulation of the two forms of NRT2.1 by the nitrogen status of the plant. This result was confirmed by ELISA, indicating a 70% decrease in total NRT2.1 signal at 10 mm NH4NO3, compared with 0.3 mm KNO3 (Fig. 5E). Time course experiments, however, indicated that a significant decay of NRT2.1 in response to high nitrogen required several days of treatment. Indeed, transfer of the plants from 1 mm to 10 mm NH4NO3 for 8 h or 3 days resulted in a 20 and 60% decrease in the total amount of NRT2.1, respectively (Fig. 5A). This repressive effect of high nitrogen supply was apparently not specifically due to the presence of in the nutrient solution, because a moderate decrease of NRT2.1 abundance was also observed in response to the supply of 5 mm as the sole nitrogen source (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data indicate that, unlike NRT2.1 expression, NRT2.1 abundance is only slowly modified by light, sugar, or nitrogen treatments. This suggests that the NRT2.1 protein is relatively stable in the PM and remains abundant for hours or days after transcription of the gene has been down-regulated. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide has only a slow effect on NRT2.1 abundance in the PM, whereas it quickly reduced both NRT2.1 mRNA level and 15 influx (supplemental materials Fig. S3).   [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]] Cleavage of the C Terminus of NRT2.1—To validate by another independent approach the conclusion that NRT2.1 abundance on PM is not regulated during the day/night cycle, we used GFP10 transgenic plants to determine how the NRT2.1-GFP protein responds to light and sugar. GFP10 plants were grown for 14 days on modified MS medium containing 1 mm KNO3 with or without 3% sucrose. Plants were pre-treated for 24 h in the light or dark before confocal imaging. Under light conditions, GFP fluorescence was predominantly located in the PM and ER as described above, independently on the presence of sucrose (Fig. 6, A and B). Plants pre-treated for 24 h in the dark with or without sucrose also showed strong GFP fluorescence associated with PM/ER (Fig. 6, C and D). However, GFP fluorescence was also surprisingly strongly observed inside the cortical cells, filling a compartment, that most likely is the vacuole (Fig. 6, C and D). Time course studies indicated that when plants were transferred in the dark after 24 h of continuous light, accumulation of GFP in the vacuole was observed after at least 9 h of darkness (Fig. 6, E-G), and increased until 24 h of darkness (Fig. 6H). In the reverse experiment, where plants were transferred to the light after 24 h of darkness, GFP fluorescence, which was observed both inside the vacuole and in the PM/ER of cortical cells at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 6I), quickly disappeared from the inside of the cells after only 1 h 30 min of illumination (Fig. 6J), and stayed only visible in the PM/ER. The same results were found with GFP12 plants (results not shown).   [[FIGURE]] To explain this observation Western blots were performed with soluble proteins and PM fractions extracted from WT and GFP10 plants using both anti-NRT2.1 and anti-GFP antibodies. As expected for a membrane protein, no signal was detected with anti-NRT2.1 antibody on the Western blot performed with soluble proteins (data not shown). However, using the same extract, a strong band was detected with the anti-GFP antibody, specifically in the GFP10 plants, at ∼27-28 kDa (Fig. 7A), which fits exactly the molecular mass of free GFP. In agreement with the confocal microscopy data, the GFP band was only recorded at night, and quickly disappeared after only4hof light (Fig. 7A). This unexpected result suggests that the NRT2.1-GFP protein is cleaved, and that the GFP fluorescence seen inside the vacuole in the dark is due to free GFP generated by this cleavage. This conclusion is fully supported by Western blots performed with PM fractions of GFP10 plants using anti-NRT2.1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 7B, three specific bands were detected in the PM of GFP10 plants: a weak band at ∼120 kDa corresponding to the high molecular mass complex observed in the WT, a strong band at ∼65 kDa, specific for GFP10 plants, which approximately corresponds to the expected size of the NRT2.1-GFP fusion protein, and surprisingly a strong band at ∼45 kDa, i.e. at the size of the native NRT2.1 protein in the WT. This last result was totally unexpected because no native NRT2.1 protein should be found in the PM from GFP10 plants as this line was obtained after transformation of the nrt2.1-1 knock-out mutant (see Fig. 2, B and C). The simplest interpretation of these data is that the band found at ∼45 kDa in GFP10 PM is the portion of the NRT2.1-GFP protein that remains after GFP has been cleaved off. Interestingly, free GFP was not found in transgenic plants expressing a GFP-NRT2.1 protein with GFP fused at the N terminus of NRT2.1 (Fig. 7C), and accordingly, no GFP fluorescence was recorded inside the root cortical vacuoles when these plants were transferred for 24 h in the dark (Fig. 7, D and E). Furthermore, no GFP is observed in the root vacuoles of transgenic plants expressing GFP alone under the control of the 35S promoter (supplemental materials Fig. S4). 
!~MM~! Production of the PNRT2.1-NRT2.1-GFP Construct—Cloning of PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 (3114 bp, including the 1335-bp 5′ untranslated region and promoting sequence upstream the ATG) and fusion with GFP coding sequence at the 3′ end of NRT2.1 was performed using Gateway™ Technology, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gateway cloning manual, Invitrogen). The primers NRT2.1 GATE forward (CACCCACGTCAGCGAGATTGATCG) and NRT2.1 GATE reverse (AACATTGTTGGGTGTGTTCTCAGGC) were used to amplify the PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 complete DNA sequence from the bac clone T6D22 (ARBC, Columbus, OH). After gel purification of the PCR product with the Nucleo Spin® Extract Kit (Machery Nagel), PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 was cloned into the pENTR™/D-Topo vector (Invitrogen) to create an entry clone. After transformation of One Shot TOP10 thermocompetent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) the vector was sequenced. LR (Invitrogen) reaction was performed to transfer PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 from entry clone to the destination binary vector pGWB4 (no promoter, C-sGFP) obtained from Tsuyoshi Nakagawa (Research Institute of Molecular Genetics, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan). Following the LR reaction thermocompetent DH5α E. coli were transformed and positive clones were selected with hygromycin. Prior transformation of Agrobacterium, part of the expression construct was sequenced to verify the translational fusion of PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 with the GFP tag. In addition we used plants, called P43NRT2.1, transformed with NRT2.1 fused to GFP in N-terminal, under the control of the 35S promoter as described in Chopin et al. (38).  Plant Transformation—Binary vectors containing the GFP fusion construct were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GC3101. A. thaliana nrt2.1-1 mutant plants, ecotype Wassilewskija (18), were transformed by dipping the flowers in the presence of Silwet L77 (39). The transformants were selected on a medium containing 30 mg/liter of hygromycin. For further analyses, T1 segregation ratios were analyzed to select transformants with one T-DNA insertion and to isolate T3-homozygous plants.  Growth Conditions—For all experiments, except those devoted to confocal imaging, plants were grown hydroponically using the experimental set-up described previously (30). Briefly, seeds were sown directly on the surface of wet sand in modified 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, with the bottom replaced by a metal screen. The tubes supporting the seeds were placed on polystyrene floating rafts, on the surface of a 10-liter tank filled with tap water. The culture was then performed in a controlled growth chamber with 8 h/16 h day/night cycle at 24/20 °C. Light intensity during the light period was at 250 μmol m-2 s-1. One week after sowing, the tap water was replaced by nutrient solution until the age of 6-7 weeks depending on the size of the plants. The basal nutrient solutions supplied to the plants are those described by Gansel et al. (31) and contained either 0.3 mm, 1 mm, 5 mm, or 10 mm NH4NO3 as nitrogen source. The nutrient solution was replaced every week during this period and the day before the experiment.  For confocal imaging, plants were grown in sterile conditions in vertical agar plates (12 × 12 cm) on the same basal medium as used for hydroponic cultures plus 2.5 mm MES and 1.2% (w/v) agar type A (Sigma, product A4550). It contained 1 mm as nitrogen source and either 3% sucrose (w/v) or no sugar. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 with KOH. After sowing, the plates were transferred in a growth chamber with 16 h/8 h day/night cycle at 21/18 °C and 70% relative humidity. Light intensity during the light period was at 125 μmol m-2 s-1. Observations were performed after 14 days of growth.  In Vivo Protein Cross-linking—According to Rohila et al. (40) in vivo protein cross-linking was performed by adding formaldehyde to the nutrient solution of hydroponically grown plants to get a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Plants were treated during 45 min before harvesting the roots for plasma membrane (PM) extraction.  Confocal Microscopy—GFP images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 axiovert 200M inverted microscope. GFP (excitation/emission maxima ∼488/507 nm) was excited with the 488 nm line of an Argon laser and detected via a 505-530 nm bandpass filter (green). Autofluorescence was detected via a 650-nm long pass filter (red). Dichroic mirrors used were HFT 488 and NFT 545.  To visualize the different plant cell membranes, several stains were used. Images of the plasma membrane and the tonoplast were obtained after 5 min and at least 16 h of incubation with 8.2 μm of the endocytic tracer FM4-64 (Invitrogen, product F34653), respectively. The endoplasmic reticulum was visualized after 30 min staining with 5 μm endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Tracker (Blue-White DPX, Invitrogen). FM4-64 was visualized with the microscope used for GFP imaging. FM4-64 (excitation/emission maxima ∼515/640 nm) was excited with the 543-nm line and detected via LP 650 and LP 585, respectively. Dichroic mirrors used were HFT 488/543 and NFT 545. ER Tracker (excitation/emission maxima ∼347-640 nm) images were obtained with the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axioplan 2 microscope. ER Tracker was excited with the diode 405-nm laser for blue dye and detected via a 420-480 BP filter (blue). Dichroic mirrors used were HFT 405/488/543 and NFT 490.  NRT2.1 Immunodetection and Membrane Purification—Root total proteins were extracted as described by Santoni et al. (41). Microsomes were prepared as described by Giannini et al. (42) and plasma membrane vesicles were purified from microsomes by aqueous two-phase partitioning, as described by Santoni et al. (43).  Proteins were separated on denaturing SDS-PAGE followed by an electrotransfer at 4 °C onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). NRT2.1 was detected using two different anti-NRT2.1 antisera produced by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium) against either the synthetic peptide TLEKAGEVAKDKFGK (anti-NRT2.1 19) or CKNMHQGSLRFAENAK (anti-NRT2.1 20) (Fig. 2A). The two polyclonal anti-sera were affinity purified by Eurogentec. The immunodetection was performed with a chemiluminescent detection system kit (SuperSignal, Pierce).  For ELISA, serial 2-fold dilutions in a carbonate buffer (30 mm Na2CO3, 60 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.5) of 500 ng of PM proteins were loaded in duplicate on Maxisorb immunoplates (Nunc, Denmark) and left overnight at 4 °C. The immunodetection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary anti-NRT2.1 20 antibody (1:2500 dilution) and a secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody were successively applied for 2 h at 37 °C.A linear regression between the absorbance signal due to oxidized 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt, as read with a multiplate reader (Victor, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the amount of proteins was obtained for each sample and used for relative comparison between samples.  RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription—RNA extraction was performed on roots as described previously (44) using guanidine hydrochloride and lithium chloride. Subsequently 40 μg of RNA were treated with DNase (RNase Free DNase Kit, Qiagen) and purified (RNeasy MinElute™ Cleanup Kit, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The absence of genomic DNA was verified by PCR using specific primers spanning an intron in the gene APTR (At1g27450).  Reverse transcription was performed with 4 μg of purified RNA and oligo(dT)18 primers. The mixture was heated for 5 min at 72 °C and progressively (-1 °C per 10 s) cooled down to allow hybridization of the primers. The reaction was carried out in a volume of 20 μl in the presence of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C during 90 min. The quality of the cDNA was verified by PCR using the primers for the gene APTR.  Quantitative PCR—Real-time amplification was performed in a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) with the kit SYBR Green (LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green1, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 10 μl. The following conditions of amplifications were applied: 10 min at 95 °C; 45 cycles of 5 sat 95 °C; 7 sat 65 ° C; and 8 sat 72 °C. A melting curve was then performed to verify the specificity of the amplification. Successive dilutions of one sample were used as a standard curve. Amplification efficiency was around 1. All the results presented were standardized using the housekeeping gene Clathrin (At4g24550). The primers used were: NRT2.1 forward, AACAAGGGCTAACGTGGATG; NRT2.1 reverse, CTGCTTCTCCTGCTCATTCC; Clath forward, AGCATACACTGCGTGCAAAG; Clath reverse, TCGCCTGTGTCACATATCTC.  Root Influx Measurements—Root 15 influx was assayed as described by Dehlon et al. (45). Briefly, the plants were sequentially transferred to 0.1 mm CaSO4 for 1 min, to complete nutrient solution, pH 5.8, containing 0.2 mm15 (99 atom % excess 15N) for 5 min, and finally to 0.1 mm CaSO4 for 1 min. Roots were then separated from shoots, and the organs dried at 70 °C for 48 h. After determination of their dry weight, the samples were analyzed for total nitrogen and atom % 15N using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a C/N elemental analyzer (model ANCA-MS; PDZ Europa, Crewe, UK) as described in Clarkson et al. (46). Each influx value is the mean of 6 to 12 replicates.
