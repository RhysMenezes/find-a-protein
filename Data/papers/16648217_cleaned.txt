!~ABS~! The thylakoid proteome of chloroplasts contains multiple proteins involved in antioxidative defense, protein folding, and repair. To understand this functional protein network, we analyzed the quantitative response of the thylakoid-associated proteome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild type and the ascorbate-deficient mutant vtc2-2 after transition to high light (HL; 1,000 μmol photons m−2 s−1). The soluble thylakoid proteomes of wild type and vtc2-2 were compared after 0, 1, 3, and 5 d of HL using two-dimensional gels with three independent experiments, followed by a multivariant statistical analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. After 5 d of HL, both wild-type and vtc2-2 plants accumulated anthocyanins, increased their total ascorbate content, and lost 10% of photosystem II efficiency, but showed no bleaching. Anthocyanin and total ascorbate concentrations in vtc2-2 were respectively 34% and 20% of wild type, potentially leading to enhanced oxidative stress in vtc2-2. Forty-five protein spots significantly changed as a consequence of genotype, light treatment, or both. Independent confirmation was obtained from western blots. The most significant response was the up-regulation of thylakoid YCF37 likely involved in photosystem I assembly, and specific fibrillins, a flavin reductase-like protein, and an aldolase, each located in thylakoid-associated plastoglobules. Fe-superoxide dismutase was down-regulated in vtc2-2, while Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was up-regulated. vtc2-2 also showed a systematic up-regulation of a steroid dehydrogenase-like protein. A number of other stress-related proteins, several thylakoid proteases, and lumenal isomerases did not change, while PsbS increased in wild type upon light stress. These findings are discussed in terms of plastid metabolism and oxidative stress defense, and emphasize that understanding of the chloroplast stress-response network must include the enzymatic role of plastoglobules.
!~RES~! Wild-type and vtc2-2 plants were grown on soil under a short-day length at optimal light intensity (120 μmol photons m−2 s−1) for about 40 d to reach a fully developed rosette. Throughout the remainder of this article, we refer to the vtc2-2 line as vtc2. As expected, vtc2 plants were reduced in size and biomass as compared to wild type (Fig. 1A ). Light intensity was then increased to 1,000 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under otherwise identical conditions. Surprisingly, after 3 and 5 d of HL, vtc2 visibly accumulated less anthocyanins than wild type, in particular when viewing the adaxial side of the leaves (Fig. 1B). After 5 d of HL, wild type rosettes accumulated about 176 μg total monomeric anthocyanin per gram fresh weight, whereas vtc2 accumulated only 61 μg per gram fresh weight corresponding to 34% of wild-type levels (Fig. 2A ). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Total oxidized and reduced ascorbate concentrations in vtc2 leaves were about 20% of wild-type levels under the optimal light conditions. Total ascorbate concentrations nearly doubled after 5 d of HL in both genotypes (Fig. 2B). About 5% to 8% of the total ascorbate was oxidized in wild type under both light conditions, while 27% to 33% of total ascorbate was oxidized in vtc2 under both light conditions. Thus, the already smaller pool of ascorbate in vtc2 appeared more oxidized; we note that it is possible that this oxidation is somewhat overestimated due to some interference by oxidation of dithiothreitol used in the assay (CITATION). To monitor the efficiency of PSII, one of the prime targets for light-induced damage, we measured the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII in the dark-adapted state (Fv/Fm) ratio of dark-adapted leaves about 2 h into the light period. Fv/Fm ratios were 0.84 for both wild type and vtc2 prior to the HL treatment and decreased to about 0.75 and 0.72 after 5 d of HL in wild type and vtc2, respectively (Fig. 2C). These measurements showed that the HL-induced loss of PSII efficiency ranged from 11% to 14%, with no significant differences between wild type and vtc2. The phenotypic analysis above clearly showed a moderate light-induced oxidative stress (reduced Fv/Fm, doubling of ascorbate, and accumulation of anthocyanins) in both wild type and vtc2. To analyze the HL response of the peripheral, lumenal, and PG thylakoid proteomes in vtc2 and wild type, thylakoids were purified prior to the HL treatment (0 d) and after 1, 3, and 5 d of HL. After thylakoid purification, the peripheral and lumenal thylakoid and PG proteomes were extracted by sonication and analyzed by 2DE, using immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips in the first dimension (pI 4–7) and gradient SDS-PAGE (8%–16% acrylamide) in the second dimension. To allow statistical analysis of the differential expression of this extracted thylakoid proteome in response to light and ascorbate deficiency, the complete experiment was repeated three times, including plant growth, proteome purification, and 2DE. Throughout this manuscript, these three independent experiments are named biological replicates. To reduce gel-to-gel variation, each protein preparation was analyzed on at least three parallel 2DE gels. In total we generated and analyzed 72 2DE gels (two genotypes, three gel replicates, four time points, and three biological replicates). The gel images looked overall quite similar to each other, both when comparing wild type and vtc2 and when comparing different time points (Fig. 3, A and B ). This indicated that the thylakoid purifications, protein extractions, 2DE, and gel staining were reproducible. Spots were first automatically (using image analysis software) detected in all 72 gel images using the same parameters for all gels (e.g. sensitivity and background). Subsequently, a manual spot editing was carried out for each of the gel images to remove minor features resulting from, for example, Sypro Ruby precipitates, and to split major trains of spots into single spots. All spots were then quantified and normalized to their respective total gel spot volume. After this first-pass manual curation, gel images were matched to a reference gel (Supplemental Fig. 1). Spots not present on the reference gel were added if they were present on at least five gels; in total, 328 spots were assigned on this reference gel. Intensities of corresponding spots on the three technical gel replicates within a genotype-treatment combination were averaged. A total of 155 out of 328 spots had an averaged intensity for all 24 combinations (genotype-treatment-biological replicates) and are hereafter assigned as the complete data set (Supplemental Table I). This set was used for statistical analysis. [[FIGURE]] We tested the effect of the HL treatment and the genotype, as well as their interaction, on the complete data set using a multivariance analysis. At P < 0.01, we observed a significant genotype effect and significant treatment effect for 10 spots each and a significant genotype-treatment interaction (this means that the difference between the two genotypes changes significantly upon the treatment) for two spots, totaling 20 spots (Fig. 4 ). When the P value was increased to P < 0.05, 45 significant spots were detected (Fig. 4). All significant spots were analyzed by nano liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) and proteins could be identified in most spots. A number of spots contained more than one protein, and for some of them it was not possible to determine which one was the main component (data not shown). We will not discuss spots in which no proteins were identified nor spots that contained a mixture of proteins of quite equal abundance. In total, 19 spots and their protein identities will be discussed and are listed in Table I , together with a graphic display of the averaged relative spot intensities with sd for each genotype-treatment combination. A reference gel with these 19 significant protein spots is shown in Supplemental Figure 1 (spot numbers in blue). [[FIGURE]] Selected differentially accumulating protein spots and details of spot quantification, protein content, and MS-based identification The bar diagrams show the average of the spot intensities across the three independent experiments for wild type (white bars) and vtc2 (black bars) at 0, 1, 3, and 5 d of HL with sds. Statistical significance as determined by the multivariant analysis is indicated as: G, genotype effect; T, treatment effect; and I, genotype-treatment interaction, with indicated maximum P value. Experimental pI and molecular mass (MW) are listed. Protein(s) identified in the spots are listed with the Mascot MOWSE score (or scores if two matched spots were analyzed by MS successfully) as a measure of confidence for MS-based identification. The curated location for each protein is indicated. Asterisks (*) indicate modification from original MapMan Bin. Most of the spots that significantly responded to the light treatment were increasingly up-regulated with progressive days of light stress (spot nos. 149, 202, 261, 263, 271, 284, 421, 851, and 1,010; Table I). Spot 149 contained FIB2 (At2g35490) and spots 261, 263, 271, and 284 all contained FIB1a,1b (At4g04020 and At4g22240). Spots 261 and 271 also contained low levels of FIB4 (At3g23400) and FIB7a (At3g58010), respectively. These proteins are all members of the FIB family (Table I). A close up of the 2DE spots 263 and 271 is shown in Figure 3B. Spot 202 contained Fru biphosphate aldolase-1 (At2g21330) that was recently shown to accumulate in PGs, in addition to its abundant accumulation in the chloroplast stroma (CITATION; CITATION). Spot 421 contained a homolog to YCF37 in Synechocystis (At2g23670) and increased 2-fold over 5 d of light treatment. Spot 1,010 contained a flavin reductase-related protein (At1g32220) with background signals of Ser-type protease subunit ClpP4 (At5g45390) and an RNA-binding protein (CP29B′; At2g37220). CP29B′ was a minor contamination of an abundant neighboring spot. In contrast to the up-regulation in the spots above, spot 262, containing a putative glyoxylase (lactoylgluthathione lyase; At1g67280), was down-regulated 3-fold in wild type but not significantly effected in vtc2. Spot 851 contained the chaperones cpHSP70-1,2 (At4g24280 and At5g49910) and showed an increase in vtc2 after 3 and 5 d of HL, but no change in accumulation in the wild type. Spot 324 contained an OEC23-like protein and showed a small, but consistent increase in vtc2. Spot 351 was weak, containing a breakdown product of 2-Cys Prx A and increased slightly after 3 and 5 d HL. However, for spot 157 (see sections below) containing the mature 2-Cys Prx A, no significant change was observed; this was confirmed by western blotting (data not shown). Spot 377 also contained an OEC23-like protein (but different from spot 324) and was down-regulated upon light treatment. Spot 390 contained Cu,Zn SOD that was consistently more abundant in vtc2. Seven identified spots (262, 289, 314, 324, 390, 427, and 851) showed a significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) differential response to the genotype (wild type versus vtc2). Spot 289 contained a mix of 3-β-hydroxy-δ-steroid dehydrogenase (At2g37660) and the OEC33-like protein (At3g50820) with consistent up-regulation in vtc2. As mentioned above, spot 390 contained Cu,Zn-SOD and was consistently more abundant in vtc2. Spot 427 contained a breakdown product of one of the two plastocyanin homologs, PC-2 (At1g76100), and was also higher in vtc2. The response to the genotype of spots 262 and 851 was also significantly different for the HL treatment (at P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). As mentioned in the previous paragraph, spot 262 containing a glyoxylase I (also named lactoylgluthathione lyase) was down-regulated in wild type but not significantly affected in vtc2. Spot 851 contained the chaperones cpHSP70-1,2 (At4g24280 and At5g49910) and showed an increase in vtc2 in response to 3 and 5 d of HL but no change in accumulation in the wild type. Neighboring spot 314 contained Rib 5-P isomerase (At3g04790) and was consistently higher in vtc2 than in wild type. Two spots (285 and 964) showed only a significant (P < 0.05) genotype-treatment interaction and no effect of genotype or treatment alone. Spot 285 contained FIB1a (At4g22240) and FIB7a (At3g58010). The spot showed a higher accumulation at time point 0 in vtc2, but a higher accumulation at time point 5 d of HL in wild type. Spot 964 contained cpHSP70-2 and its closely related homolog cpHSP70-1 with lower MOWSE score. This spot is located close to spot 851 also containing these two HSP70 homologs, as discussed in the previous section. Spot 964 showed a small increase in cpHSP70 levels in vtc2 as compared to wild type at the later time points, consistent with the observations for spot 851. We confirmed the up-regulation of FIBs observed by 2DE using SDS-PAGE and western blots on total membrane protein extracts (Fig. 5A ). Prior to light stress, the FIBs could hardly be observed, but their intensity increased several fold after 1 and 3 d of light stress in both wild type and vtc2, with a slightly stronger response in vtc2 than in wild type, in agreement with the 2DE analysis. As also observed by 2DE, FIB accumulation did not increase from 3 to 5 d in vtc2, but did increase in this interval in wild type. To ensure that the observed increase was not related to binding and release of FIBs to the membrane, we also blotted the total soluble fraction (Fig. 5A). As expected, only a weak signal from FIB1a was observed. This is in agreement with our proteome analyses of chloroplast subfractions showing that FIBs typically associate with thylakoids. [[FIGURE]] We confirmed the up-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD in vtc2 as compared to wild type (spot 390) using one-dimensional gels and western blots on total soluble extracts (Fig. 5B). At each time point we observed an up-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD in vtc2 as compared to wild type. Since expression of Cu,Zn-SOD is antagonistic to expression of the three chloroplast-localized Fe-SODs in the chloroplast under copper deficiency (CITATION), we also determined total Fe-SOD accumulation levels in total soluble extracts (Fig. 5B). Indeed, the Fe-SODs were down-regulated in vtc2 as compared to wild type. In addition to the statistical analysis and identification of differentially expressed proteins, we also specifically looked at the accumulation patterns of known lumenal and peripheral thylakoid proteins that are associated with oxidative stress defense, redox regulation, proteolysis, and (un) folding. To facilitate this analysis, we identified the proteins in most of the spots on the 2DE gels by MS/MS. In total, 99 proteins were identified, of which 91% were chloroplast predicted by TargetP (see Supplemental Table II). This set included eight proteases, eight chaperones and isomerases, 13 stress-related proteins, eight RNA-binding and ribosomal proteins, 14 proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus, and many proteins without known function or with diverse functions in metabolism (Supplemental Table II). We extracted the spot quantifications and statistical analysis for the most relevant 13 spots in which only one protein (or one dominant protein) was identified. Details for those spots are listed in Table II (13 spots) and they are also marked (in black) on the reference gel (Supplemental Fig. 1). Examples were proteases DegP5 (spot 251), DegP8 (spot 181), DegP1 (abundant spots 957 and 203), and thioredoxin type m1 (major component in spots 424 and 428 and uniquely in spot 976). Also, the stromal 2-Cys Prx A in spot 157 did not change. Spot 381 contained peroxiredoxin II E, probably as a major component of the spot, and was not significantly changing either. We do point out however, that even though not significant at P < 0.05, some of these spots show a drop after 1 d of HL, followed by an increase in the following days (e.g. spots 424 and 381). Quantification of proteins involved in stress response and/or protein biogenesis and degradation in quantified and reproducible spots that do not show a significant response (at P < 0.05) to the HL treatment, the genotype, or the interaction Details of spot quantification, protein content, and MS-based identification are listed. The bar diagrams show the average of the spot intensities across the three independent experiments for wild type (white bars) and vtc2 (black bars) at 0, 1, 3, and 5 d of HL with sds. Protein(s) identified in the spots are listed with the Mascot MOWSE score as a measure of confidence for MS-based identification. The curated location for each protein is indicated. Asterisks (*) indicate modification from original MapMan Bin. Several integral thylakoid proteins have been associated with oxidative stress. We tested the accumulation of PsbS and thylakoid proteases and FtsH2 (also named VAR2), using western-blot analysis of total membrane proteins of leaves (Fig. 6 ). PsbS levels doubled during the HL treatment in wild type, without a significant increase in vtc2 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, FtsH2 level did not change significantly upon light stress and no differences were found between vtc2 and wild type (Fig. 6B). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild type (ecotype Columbia-0) and vtc2-2 were grown on soil in growth chambers (Conviron) under controlled conditions (70% relative humidity, 120 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 10 h photoperiod, and 22°C light/17°C dark). The vtc2-2 line was originally identified as described in CITATION and subsequent map-based cloning showed that the line has a missense mutation in At4g26850, leading to a Gly-to-Asp change in predicted exon 5 (CITATION). The vtc2-2 seeds were kindly provided by Dr. P. Conklin (in 2003). Approximately 40 d after sowing when plants had fully developed leaf rosettes, but were prior to bolting, the light intensity was increased to 1,000 μmol photons m−2 s−1 (HL) while maintaining the light-dark cycle. Complete rosettes were harvested after 0, 1, 3, and 5 d of the HL treatment. All plant material was collected after 2 h into the light period. Fv/Fm values (as a measure of PSII intactness) of attached leaves were determined during the first half of the light period after a 15 min dark adaptation period, using a pulse modulated fluorimeter (HansaTech, FMS2). For determination of ascorbate, 0.4 mg leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in 2% meta-phosphoric acid and 2 mm EDTA. Membranes were removed by centrifugation at 18,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The soluble extract was neutralized with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) to a final concentration of 0.1 m. Ascorbate and dehydro ascorbate were measured according to CITATION. Anthocyanins were extracted from 0.2 g of leaf tissue ground in liquid nitrogen, by addition of 1 mL water, and centrifugation at 18,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted with 0.4 m sodium acetate at pH 4.5 and 25 mm potassium chloride at pH 1.0, and then spun again. Total monomeric anthocyanins were measured by recording the A520 as outlined in CITATION. Intact thylakoid membranes were purified on Percoll gradients essentially as in CITATION. The soluble thylakoid proteome (lumen and peripherally attached proteins) were released by mild sonication (three times for 20 s at 10 W) with a Fisher Scientific membrane dismembrator (model 100) from a 3 mL thylakoid suspension at 1 mg chlorophyll mL−1. Soluble proteins were separated from the membrane fraction by centrifugation at 55,000g for 25 min at 4°C, and then precipitated in 80% acetone. The protein pellet was suspended in 9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method (CITATION). For isoelectric focusing, 2% IPG buffer pH 4 to 7 (Amersham) and 2 mm tri-butylphosphine were added to the protein samples. One-hundred micrograms of proteins were loaded on IPG strips pI 4 to 7 (11 cm; Pharmacia). Focusing, followed by reduction and alkylation were carried out as described earlier (CITATION). Precast Tris-HCl gels (8%–16% acrylamide; Bio-Rad) were used in the second dimension. Gels were stained for 12 h with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes). Gel images were taken with a Fluor-S imager (Bio-Rad) using several exposure times, ranging from 3 to 50 s. These images were evaluated for signal-to-noise ratio, sensitivity (number of detected spots), and number of saturated spots. Images with relatively low exposure times were chosen for analysis since they had the best signal-to-noise ratio (estimated as spot intensity over background), while allowing detection of low abundant spots (data not shown). The chosen gel images had maximally from five to nine saturated spots in particular containing plastocyanin, OEC23, OEC33, and CF1α. Spot 955 (CF1α) and spot 386 (plastocyanin) were the most frequently saturated (on 27 and 28 gels over 72). Image analysis was carried out using HT analyzer 2.1 (Genomic Solutions). Gels with extensive streaking or poor spot resolution were discarded and new gels were run with the same sample. In total, 72 gel images were used for the final data set (two genotypes [wild type and vtc2], four time points [0, 1, 3, and 5 d of HL], three gels for each sample, and three independent experiments). Spot detection was performed using the same settings for all the gel images. To clean the images from false spots (e.g. Sypro Ruby deposits, water bubbles, etc.), each gel was visually inspected and fictitious spots manually removed in HT analyzer. After background subtraction the spot intensity was normalized as percentage of the total spot intensity of the gel. One gel was chosen as a reference and corresponding spots on the 72 gels were matched to the reference gel. To minimize the contribution of gel-to-gel variation, three gels were run for each sample. The logarithm of intensity of correspondent spots on the three gels were averaged and considered as data points. The intensities of nondetected spots were treated as missing values rather than zeros, and did not contribute to the average intensity. A multivariance model was used to evaluate plant effect (due to wild-type and vtc2 genotypic backgrounds), treatment effect (due to the light stress observed at the four time points), and genotype-treatment interaction. The statistical model was applied to 155 spots with complete data. We then tested the effect of the HL treatment and the genotype, as well as their interaction using the following equation: variation = (genotype) + (treatment) + (genotype-treatment) + (residual error). The significance was measured by both the P value and the false-positive discovery rate, calculated as identified significant spots divided by expected number of false-positive spots. A randomization argument was used to adjust the obtained P values, according to the formula: p_adj = (rank of unadjusted p among 155 pseudo P value)/156. We will discuss two groups of spots that show differences with a probability P of error less than 0.01 and less than 0.05. Protein spots were excised from the gels and automatically (Progest, Genomic Solutions) or manually digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. After digestion, peptides were analyzed using a CapLC-ESI-MS/MS (Q-TOF1; Waters). Peptides were loaded on a μguard column (LC-packings; MGU-30-C18PM), followed by separation on a PepMap C18 Reverse Phase Nano column (LC Packings nan75-15–03-C18PM), using 45 min gradients with 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (solvent A), and 95% acetonitrile, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid (solvent B), and a flow rate of 0.2 μL/min. MS/MS spectra were processed using Mascot distiller (v2.1) and the proteins were identified by searching against the Arabidopsis database, ATH1.pep (v6.0), using in-house Mascot (Matrix Science). Mascot search criteria were as follows: maximal precursor ion and fragment ion errors 1.2 and 0.8 D, variable Met oxidation, maximally 1 missed cleavage, minimal significance for protein MOWSE score P < 0.01, and minimal ion score 20. These search results were further filtered (using an in-house routine; Q. Sun and K.J. van Wijk, unpublished data), to remove all protein identifications that needed peptides matched at rank 2 or higher to realize a significant MOWSE score (at P < 0.01). To ensure correct assignment of protein identity to weaker selected spots (intensity <0.2% of the total volume), differentially expressed spots were identified from two or more gels, and additional verification of spot matching. In a few cases we identified more than one protein in a particular spot (as indicated). Where possible, the protein with a significantly larger number of matching peptides and higher MOWSE score was assigned as the major contributor to the spot intensity. Identified proteins with MOWSE scores and matched peptide sequences can be found in the Plastid Proteome Database at http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu. For analysis of cellular proteins by western blots, wild type and vtc2 leaves were extracted by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and 10 mm Tris-HCL buffer pH 6.8, and 2 mm EDTA. The extracts were spun at 18,000g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and spun at 55 k rpm in TLA100.3. The resulting clear supernatant contained the total soluble proteins, which were precipitated in 10% TCA for 30 min on ice. The pellets were washed with Tris and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS, and 10% glycerol). The pellet from the 55 k spin was washed with tris-EDTA, spun again, and then resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Following solubilization, insoluble material was removed by a 5 min centrifugation at 18,000g and the supernatant was reduced and used for SDS-PAGE analysis on 12% acrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, incubated overnight with primary antisera (1:1,000–1:5,000) directly against Arabidopsis proteins (anti-Fe-SOD, anti-Cu,Zn-SOD, anti-FtsH2, and anti-PsbS), and a potato (Solanum tuberosum) anti-CDSP34 (CITATION) and then detected with a horseradish (Armoracia lapathifolia) peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Anti-Fe-SOD, anti-Cu,Zn-SOD, anti-FtsH2, anti-PsbS, and anti-CDSP34 were provided by P. Conklin, W. Sakamoto, K.K. Niyogi, and P. Rey, respectively.
