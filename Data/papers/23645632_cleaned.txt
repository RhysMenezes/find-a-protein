!~ABS~! Protein ubiquitination is involved in most cellular processes. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation regulates the stability of key components of the circadian clock feedback loops and the photoperiodic flowering pathway. Here, we identified two ubiquitin-specific proteases, UBP12 and UBP13, involved in circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering regulation. Double mutants of ubp12 and ubp13 display pleiotropic phenotypes, including early flowering and short periodicity of circadian rhythms. In ubp12 ubp13 double mutants, CONSTANS (CO) transcript rises earlier than that of wild-type plants during the day, which leads to increased expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T. This, and analysis of ubp12 co mutants, indicates that UBP12 and UBP13 regulate photoperiodic flowering through a CO-dependent pathway. In addition, UBP12 and UBP13 regulate the circadian rhythm of clock genes, including LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1, and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1. Furthermore, UBP12 and UBP13 are circadian controlled. Therefore, our work reveals a role for two deubiquitinases, UBP12 and UBP13, in the control of the circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering, which extends our understanding of ubiquitin in daylength measurement in higher plants.
!~RES~! UBP12 (At5g06600) and UBP13 (At3g11910) are two Arabidopsis homologs of human ubiquitin-specific protease USP7/HAUSP (first identified as a herpes virus-associated cellular factor; CITATION). UBP12 and UBP13 share high amino acid sequence similarity, with 91% sequence identity, suggesting that their function may be redundant. They also share 34% amino acid sequence identity with USP7 (Supplemental Fig. S1) and have the conserved Cys- and His-box signature motifs, indicating that they have potential deubiquitination activity. At the N termini, these three proteins contain a meprin and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor homology (MATH) domain, which is not found in other Arabidopsis UBP proteins (Fig. 1A). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether UBP12 and UBP13 have deubiquitination activity in vitro, we performed enzymatic activity assays using the hexameric polyubiquitin protein UBQ10 and ubiquitin extension protein UBQ1, which bears the 52 amino acid ribosomal protein appended to a single ubiquitin moiety as substrates. When wild-type UBP12 or UBP13 and their mutant forms UBP12C208S and UBP13C207S, in which conserved Cys of the enzymatic active sites were substituted by Ser, were coexpressed with UBQ10 and UBQ1 in Escherichia coli as described (CITATION), we can detect the cleaved products by immunoblotting analysis with ubiquitin antibody. The wild-type UBP12 and UBP13 were capable of cleaving ubiquitin from both UBQ10 and UBQ1 (Fig. 1B). However, neither of the mutants, UBP12C208S or UBP13C207S, showed any enzymatic activity, indicating that activities of UBP12 and UBP13 were dependent on the conserved Cys residue. This result is consistent with previous findings that UBP12 can remove ubiquitin from Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chain (CITATION). All of these results demonstrate that UBP12 and UBP13 are bona fide DUBs in Arabidopsis. To figure out the biological functions of UBP12 and UBP13 in plant development, we first determined UBP12 and UBP13 expression patterns by examining the GUS signal in transgenic plants with GUS expressed under the control of the UBP12 or UBP13 promoter. UBP12 and UBP13 were both expressed in the hypocotyl, cotyledon, leaf, root, and inflorescence, especially in the vascular part of these tissues (Fig. 2, A–H). However, a few differences were observed. First, UBP12 was expressed in hypocotyl and cotyledon of 4-d-old plants (Fig. 2B), whereas UBP13 was mainly expressed in hypocotyl, but not cotyledon, of 4-d-old seedlings (Fig. 2F). Second, in flowers, UBP12 was expressed in carpel, sepal, and pollen (Fig. 2D), whereas UBP13 was mainly expressed only in the pollen (Fig. 2H). The highly overlapping expression patterns of UBP12 and UBP13 in Arabidopsis suggest that they may be functionally redundant in regulating plant development. [[FIGURE]] To examine the subcellular localizations of UBP12 and UBP13 proteins, we generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged UBP12 and UBP13. In UBP12-GFP and UBP13-CFP transgenic plants, we observed that UBP12 and UBP13 were located in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2, K and L), which was similar to the GFP (Fig. 2I) and CFP (Fig. 2J) alone in 35S:GFP and 35S:CFP transgenic plants. Moreover, we detected the UBP12/UBP13 protein in separated cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions using UBP antibodies. Consistent with our observation in these transgenic plants, the UBP12/UBP13 can be detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus, though more UBP12/UBP13 can be detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2M). These results suggest that UBP12 and UBP13 might affect substrates in both the cytoplasmic and nucleic compartments. To investigate the biological functions of UBP12 and UBP13, we isolated mutants from transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion populations of Arabidopsis. Two insertional mutants of UBP12 were identified, and the alleles were named as ubp12-1 (GABI_244E11) and ubp12-2w (GABI_742C10; Fig. 3A, top); the alleles contain T-DNA insertions in exons 15 and 28, respectively. Three mutant alleles of UBP13 were identified and designated as ubp13-1 (SALK_128312), ubp13-2 (SALK_024054), and ubp13-3 (SALK_132368; Fig. 3A, bottom). T-DNAs were inserted in the fifth, 10th, and 21st exons of these three mutants, respectively. [[FIGURE]] By northern-blot analysis, no accumulation of full-length UBP12 mRNA was detected in ubp12-1 and ubp12-2w mutant plants, and no full-length UBP13 mRNA was detected in ubp13-1, ubp13-2, and ubp13-3 (Fig. 3B). However, one smaller segment was found in ubp12-2w and ubp13-3 mutant plants, suggesting that ubp12-2w and ubp13-3 are not null alleles for UBP12 or UBP13. In the ubp12-2w mutant, surprisingly, the mRNA level of UBP13 was also decreased (Fig. 3B), which might result from high transcription of the 3′ primer region of UBP12 in ubp12-2w causing suppression of UBP13 in trans (Supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that ubp12-2w is a weak double mutant, although there is only one T-DNA insertion in the genome (Supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, we named it as ubp12-2w. Different from other single mutants (Fig. 3, C, D, F, G, and H) with no obvious developmental phenotypes, the ubp12-2w exhibited distinct phenotypes, including small plants, round leaves, short petioles, dwarfism, and more branches after bolting (Fig. 3, E and N). The similar expression patterns of UBP12 and UBP13 (Fig. 2, A–H) indicate that they could have redundant biological functions in regulating plant development. To test this, we generated double mutants and obtained ubp12-2w ubp13-1 (Fig. 3, I and O), ubp12-2w ubp13-2 (Fig. 3, J and P), ubp12-2w ubp13-3 (Fig. 3, K and Q), and ubp12-1 ubp13-3 (Fig. 3, L and R). All these double mutants displayed similar but much more severe phenotypes than ubp12-2w (Fig. 3, E and N), including smaller plants, rounder leaves, shorter petioles at seedling stage, more severe dwarf statures, and more bushy plants at mature stage. Among these viable double mutants, ubp12-2w ubp13-3 showed weakest developmental phenotypes in every aspect we observed, which is consistent with the fact that partial transcripts can be detected in ubp12-2w or ubp13-3. Fertility of all these double mutants was dramatically decreased. Only ubp12-2w ubp13-3 set enough seeds for further research, whereas ubp12-1 ubp13-3 was completely infertile. The homozygous ubp12-1 ubp13-1 and ubp12-1 ubp13-2 double mutants could not be obtained, suggesting that these two genes are important for Arabidopsis embryo development and/or male/female gametophyte function. Taken together, we conclude that UBP12 and UBP13 are involved in diverse developmental processes. In addition to the developmental patterning defects of ubp12-2w and ubp12-2w ubp13-3, the single mutants of ubp12-1 and ubp12-2w and the double mutant ubp12-2w ubp13-3 also showed early-flowering phenotype under both long-day (LD; 16-h light/8-h dark; Fig. 3S) and short-day (SD; 8-h-light/16-h-dark) conditions (Fig. 3T) compared with wild-type plants. The phenotypes were profounder under SD. The ubp12-2w ubp13-3 mutant flowered after forming only about 10 leaves under SD, which is similar to the mutants under LD condition, indicating that the double mutant is insensitive to photoperiod. The ubp12-1 ubp13-3 double mutant also showed early flowering, if only according to leaf numbers (Supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). However, ubp12-1 ubp13-3 displayed drastic developmental retardation under LD and SD, suggesting that it is not reasonable for us to analyze the flowering time (Supplemental Fig. S4C). Taken together, these results indicate that DUBs UBP12 and UBP13 are involved in the photoperiodic floral transition pathway. In Arabidopsis, transcriptional regulation of CO is crucial for daylength measurement. CO is activated under proper daylength and subsequently up-regulates the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) to promote flowering. Changes in CO transcription are the key of many daylength-insensitive mutants (CITATION). To determine if the early-flowering phenotype caused by mutations of UBP12 and UBP13 depends on CO and FT, we measured CO and FT transcripts by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) at 4-h intervals for 24 h under both LD and SD conditions. In ubp12-2w and ubp12-2w ubp13-3 double mutants, the expression level of CO started to increase at 4 or 8 h after dawn, which was earlier than that in wild-type plants under both LD (Fig. 4A, left) and SD (Fig. 4B, left) conditions. This led to elevated CO expression during the day and then activated FT expression (Fig. 4A, right), which was more evident in the SD condition (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the transcription of FLC was not affected in ubp12 or ubp13 single and double mutants (Supplemental Fig. S5). These results indicate that UBP12 and UBP13 act in the photoperiodic flowering pathway by regulating CO and FT transcriptions. [[FIGURE]] Genetic analysis of ubp12-2w co double mutants further supported our results. Both the ubp12-2w co double mutants and co single mutants flowered after forming around 30 leaves, but the ubp12-2w mutant flowered with only around 10 leaves under LD condition (Fig. 4C; Supplemental Fig. S6). This indicates that UBP12 and UBP13 act upstream of CO. GI is an upstream regulator of CO and positively regulates CO transcription. So we also analyzed ubp12-2w gi-4 mutants and found that they flowered as late as gi-4 plants (Fig. 4C; Supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that GI is also downstream of UBP12 and UBP13 in regulating photoperiodic flowering. We also tested one MADS box protein involved in photoperiodic flowering regulation, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), which negatively regulates FT expression in a CO-independent manner (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). ubp12-2w svp32 and ubp12-2w ubp13-3 svp32 showed earlier flowering than svp32 and ubp12-2w or ubp12-2w ubp13-3 under LD condition (Fig. 4D), indicating that UBP12/UBP13 and SVP regulate photoperiodic flowering in parallel. These genetic interactions suggest that UBP12 and UBP13 regulate flowering time through GI and CO. In the photoperiodic flowering pathway, the circadian oscillators take part in the daylength measurement by regulating CO expression (CITATION). The plant circadian clock is composed of multiple feedback loops (CITATION). In Arabidopsis, two MYB transcription factors, CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), are expressed in the morning. They can bind to the promoter of the evening gene TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1) to repress its transcription (CITATION; CITATION). In turn, TOC1 regulates the expressions of CCA1 and LHY as a repressor (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We examined whether mutation of UBP12 and UBP13 affects circadian rhythm and the expression patterns of these core clock genes. The rhythmic accumulations of LHY and TOC1 were tested by qRT-PCR in ubp12-2w and ubp12-2w ubp13-3 mutants. Under constant white light (LL) free-running condition, the periods of LHY (Fig. 5A) and TOC1 (Fig. 5B) expression were shortened by 4 h in ubp12-2w and ubp12-2w ubp13-3 double mutants compared with that of wild-type plants. In addition, the transcription level of TOC1 was obviously increased in ubp12-2w and ubp12-2w ubp13-3 mutants (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the period of CCA1 promoter:LUCIFERASE (pCCA1:LUC) circadian rhythm was also shortened by 4 h in ubp12-2w (n = 23) and ubp12-2w ubp13-3 mutants (n = 7) compared with the wild type (Fig. 5, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that UBP12 and UBP13 function in the periodic control of the expression of core clock oscillators in Arabidopsis. Then we tested whether UBP12 and UBP13 are themselves circadianly regulated. mRNA levels of UBP12 and UBP13 oscillated under LL condition (Fig. 5E). The transcripts of UBP12 and UBP13 increased and reached their highest level at 4 h (Zeitgeber time [ZT] 28) and then decreased and reached their lowest level around 16 h (ZT 40). Accumulation of UBP12 and UBP13 proteins was also highest at 8 h (ZT 32) and lowest at 16 h (ZT 40), which is similar to their mRNA levels (Fig. 5F). These results demonstrate that UBP12 and UBP13 are under circadian control. Taken together, we show that UBP12 and UBP13 are essential for proper circadian rhythm. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia wild-type and mutant plants were grown on vermiculite saturated with water under either LD (16-h-light/8-h-dark) or SD (8-h-light/16-h-dark) conditions with an intensity of 80 to 120 μE m–2 s–1 of white light at 23°C as described previously (CITATION). ubp12-1 (GABI_244E11), ubp12-2w (GABI_742C10), ubp13-1 (SALK_128312), ubp13-2 (SALK_024054), ubp13-3 (SALK_132368), co (CITATION), gi-4, and svp32 (CITATION) were used for genetics analysis. The primers used for genotyping are listed in Supplemental Table S1. Amino acid sequences of UBP12, UBP13, and mammalian USP7 were aligned using Jalview software through ClustalW. The domains were analyzed by the Pfam protein families database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/). UBP12pro::GUS and UBP13pro::GUS transgenic (T3) lines were used to determine the expression pattern of UBP12/UBP13 via histochemical GUS staining as described (CITATION). The promoters of UBP12 and UBP13 were amplified by primers CX3019 and CX2973 and CX2971 and CX2972, respectively, and cloned into p1391Z (XF388) vector. The complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of UBP12 and UBP13 were amplified by primers CX2969 and CX2970 and CX2967 and CX2968, respectively, and cloned into vectors pCAMBIA1300-35S-GFP (XF215) or pCAMBIA1300-35S-CFP (XF953). The subcellular localization of UBP12 and UBP13 was performed by observing the roots of transgenic (T3) plants carrying C-terminal fusion of GFP to UBP12 and CFP to UBP13 driven by the 35S promoter and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5). The full-length UBP12 or UBP13 coding sequences were amplified by primers CX3090 and CX3092 or CX3090 and CX3091, respectively. Their mutant forms, UBP12C208S and UBP13C207S, were generated by QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) using primers CX3287 and CX3288 and CX3285 and CX3286, respectively. These products were cloned into MBP-LIC (XF510) vector and then coexpressed with the substrates UBQ1 and UBQ10 in Escherichia coli as described (CITATION). Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by immunoblot with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. The primers used for these constructions are listed in Supplemental Table S1. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), 10 d after germination from whole seedlings grown under the indicated conditions (LD, SD, and LL conditions) on Murashige and Skoog plates. RNA (20 µg per lane) was separated in an agarose gel containing 1% (v/v) formaldehyde, blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare), and probed with the PCR-amplified DNA fragments using specific primer pairs (CX3977 and CX3118 for UBP12 and CX3976 and CX3120 for UBP13). Total DNA was extracted using cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide reagent and digested by the restriction enzyme EcoRI or XhoI, and then digested DNA was separated in an agarose gel, blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane, and probed with the PCR-amplified 35S promoter using specific primer pairs CX2532 and CX2533. For qRT-PCR, 2.0 μg total RNA was treated with DNaseI (Ambion), and then the first-strand cDNA was synthesized by using a cDNA synthesis kit (Transgen). qRT-PCR was performed using a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Instrument (Bio-Rad) with the SYBR Green reaction mix (Kangwei S-7567). Primers for qRT-PCR can be found in Supplemental Table S1. For luciferase measurement, the pCCA1:LUC transgenic seedlings were entrained for 7 d or 15 d in 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycles at 22°C before transfer to continuous light. Since the first day in continuous light condition, seedlings were transferred to 96-well microplates (Perkin-Elmer) containing 200 μL Murashige and Skoog medium plus 2% (w/v) Suc and 30 μL 2.5 mm luciferin. The bioluminescence production was record with a Packard TopCount luminometer (CITATION). Data were assayed using the Biological Rhythms Analysis Software System 2.1.4, which integrates the fast Fourier transform nonlinear least squares analysis for circadian rhythms (CITATION). UBP12/UBP13-specific antibody was produced using a fragment of the N-terminal 315 amino acids of UBP13 expressed in E. coli. Polyclonal antisera was raised in mouse and affinity purified by UBP13 antigen. The specificity of UBP antibody was confirmed by Western blot using the wild type and the double mutant of ubp12-2wubp13-2. As showed in Supplemental Figure S7, the full-length band of UBP is present in the wild type but not in the double mutant, whereas the partial UBP12 is present in the mutant only. Total extracts were prepared from wild-type Columbia grown under LL condition every 4 h, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated as described (CITATION). Immunoblot assay was performed as described (CITATION). Histone H3 was used as control for loading and nuclear fraction. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was used as control for cytoplasmic fraction; antibodies included anti-H3:ab1791 (Abcam) and anti-PEPC:1004163 (Rockland). The double mutants were generated from the cross of homozygous mutants and identified from the F2 progeny grown on soil by comparing with their parental phenotypes and PCR-based characterization.
