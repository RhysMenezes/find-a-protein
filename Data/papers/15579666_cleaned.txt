!~ABS~! Ser acetyltransferase (SATase; EC 2.3.1.30) catalyzes the formation of O-acetyl-Ser from l-Ser and acetyl-CoA, leading to synthesis of Cys. According to its position at the decisive junction of the pathways of sulfur assimilation and amino acid metabolism, SATases are subject to regulatory mechanisms to control the flux of Cys synthesis. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) there are five genes encoding SATase-like proteins. Two isoforms, Serat3;1 and Serat3;2, were characterized with respect to their enzymatic properties, feedback inhibition by l-Cys, and subcellular localization. Functional identity of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 was established by complementation of a SATase-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli. Cytosolic localization of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 was confirmed by using fusion construct with the green fluorescent protein. Recombinant Serat3;1 was not inhibited by l-Cys, while Serat3;2 was a strongly feedback-inhibited isoform. Quantification of expression patterns indicated that Serat2;1 is the dominant form expressed in most tissues examined, followed by Serat1;1 and Serat2;2. Although Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 were expressed weakly in most tissues, Serat3;2 expression was significantly induced under sulfur deficiency and cadmium stress as well as during generative developmental stages, implying that Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 have specific roles when plants are subjected to distinct conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the green fluorescent protein under the control of the five promoters indicated that, in all Serat genes, the expression was predominantly localized in the vascular system, notably in the phloem. These results demonstrate that Arabidopsis employs a complex array of compartment-specific SATase isoforms with distinct enzymatic properties and expression patterns to ensure the provision of Cys in response to developmental and environmental changes.
!~RES~! The investigation of Arabidopsis Genome Initiative reveals the presence of five putative SATase-like genes. Each isoform localizes to one of the five chromosomes in the genome (CITATION). cDNAs of four SATase isoforms, SAT-c (CITATION; CITATION), SAT-p (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), SAT-m (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), and SAT-106 (CITATION), were cloned. The fifth gene (At4g35640) is the only family member that has not been verified functionally by complementation using a SAT-deficient cysE mutant of E. coli. Until now, no systematic nomenclature for SATase-like proteins in plants has been proposed. In particular, Arabidopsis SATase genes are referred to with several different names that would potentially lead to unnecessary confusion. The phylogenetic tree was calculated using the amino acid sequences of 18 members of the plant SATase-like gene family available in the databases (Fig. 1). SATase-like proteins are divided into at least three subfamilies assigned as groups 1, 2, and 3. We have designated the Arabidopsis SATase-like gene family gene as AtSerat (Arabidopsis thaliana serine acetyltransferase-like protein) with three subfamilies (Serat1∼3) according to the grouping of the phylogenic tree (Table I). The described five Arabidopsis isoforms within this nomenclature are: Serat1;1 (At5g56760, SAT-c), Serat2;1 (At1g55920, SAT-p), Serat2;2 (At3g13110, SAT-m), Serat3;1 (At2g17640, SAT-106), and Serat3;2 (At4g35640; Fig. 1). [[FIGURE]] Gene designation of SATases from higher plants The previously uncharacterized SATase-like cDNA-encoding Serat3;2 isoform was isolated based on the information of the Arabidopsis genome sequence using 3′-,5′-RACE PCR. In the database, two distinct sequences for Serat3;2 were found, CAB80280 (CITATION) and AF331847. The first 203 deduced amino acids in the sequence were conserved and only differed in the C-terminal region. For the deduced sequence of CAB80280 the last four amino acids were HGES, whereas in the AF331847 sequence the last four amino acids were ERRH. To clarify this discrepancy, several independent clones were sequenced and the correct C terminus agreed with the deduced sequence of AF331847. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,068 nucleotides, encoding for 355 amino acid residues. The first ATG triplet, which is 54 nucleotides away from the 5′-end of Serat3;2, was assigned as the translational start point because the sequence around the Met codon (TTTGGTCATGGC) matches the consensus sequence for the start codon of plant genes (CITATION). A 3′-untranslated region of 192 nucleotides downstream of the translation stop codon is present in the cDNA sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of Serat3;2 was aligned with other SATases from Arabidopsis. The homology with the other SATases is high throughout the central region. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) indicates that Serat3;2 is closely related to Serat3;1, and both are separated from other SATases forming a unique group different from those characterized previously. The functional identity of the isolated cDNA, Serat3;2, together with Serat3;1 was confirmed by successful complementation with an E. coli Cys-auxotrophic mutant lacking an endogenous SATase activity. Bacterial expression vectors, pSerat3;1 and pSerat3;2, carrying the coding regions of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 under the transcriptional control of a lacZ promoter of pTV118N were constructed. E. coli JM39/5 transformed with these vectors was able to grow on M9 minimal medium without Cys, in a similar manner as pSAT2 expressing watermelon SATase (CITATION), whereas E. coli transformed with an empty vector, pTV118N, could not grow without supplementation of Cys (Fig. 2). This indicates the authenticity of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 encoding the functional SATase. [[FIGURE]] Using purified recombinant proteins, the catalytic and regulatory properties of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 were investigated. The cDNAs were inserted in frame downstream from the malE gene of E. coli, which encodes a maltose-binding protein. With this system, the purified proteins of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 were obtained by the cleavage of the maltose-binding protein with factor Xa. The recombinant proteins were visualized on SDS-PAGE gel as the expected 35-kD (Serat3;1) and 38-kD (Serat3;2) recombinant proteins in the soluble fraction. The Km values for Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 were determined by OAS formation and detected by HPLC. The Km values of these two SATases for l-Ser and acetyl-CoA were much higher than those of the three previously reported isoforms (CITATION; Table II), indicating low catalytic efficiencies of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 for both substrates. Kinetic constants of recombinant Arabidopsis Serat proteins The feedback inhibition by l-Cys on SATase reaction was analyzed using purified recombinant proteins. The activity of Serat3;2 was inhibited by l-Cys in a non-competitive manner to l-Ser and in a competitive manner to acetyl-CoA, with Ki values of 17.3 μm and 2.5 μm, respectively. The concentration for 50% inhibition (IC50) was 0.8 μm, being similar to Serat1;1 (1.8 μm; CITATION), spinach SATase (7.6 μm; CITATION), and watermelon SATase (2.9 μm; CITATION). In contrast to Serat3;2, Serat3;1 was insensitive to feedback inhibition by l-Cys (Fig. 3). [[FIGURE]] The subcellular localization of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 was determined in Arabidopsis cells using fusion proteins of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the N-terminal peptides of these proteins. The N-terminal regions of Serat3;1 (Met-1 to His-100) and Serat3;2 (Met-1 to Leu-100) were translationally fused to GFP, respectively. These fusion genes were introduced into Arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment (Fig. 4). As controls, we used fusions to the N terminus of GFP with Serat1;1, the transit peptide of pea Rubisco small subunit and the transit peptide of Arabidopsis Ser hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) for cytosolic, plastidic, and mitochondrial localization, respectively. Results in Figure 4, E and F, indicated the cytosolic localization of the GFP fusion proteins with two proteins, indicating both Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 are localized in cytosol. These localizations were independently confirmed by particle bombardment of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] The cell type-specific expression of Serat genes was studied in transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with fusion gene constructs of the Serat gene promoters (2,500 bp) and GFP gene. For each construct, three to six independent transgenic lines were analyzed with fluorescent confocal microscopy. Figure 5 shows GFP expression in Arabidopsis lines transformed with the five Serat promoter-GFP constructs. GFP expression with all Serat genes was generally found in the vascular tissues of leaves and roots (Fig. 5, A, B, D, E, and H), preferentially in the phloem (Fig. 5, C and F). A relatively weak GFP expression was also observed in all photosynthetic tissues such as leaf mesophyll cells (Fig. 5, A and E). In addition, Serat1;1-GFP could be seen in the calyx of flowers and the cortex in transverse sections of mature root (data not shown). The expression of GFP in root epidermis and cotyledons, root hair, and the calyx of flowers was found with Serat2;1, Serat2;2, and Serat3;2 (data not shown). With Serat3;1, GFP fluorescence was visualized in nascent roots (Fig. 5G). [[FIGURE]] The mRNA abundance of the Serat genes was examined by northern blotting of RNA from 3-week-old leaves (data not shown). A high level of expression was observed for Serat1;1, Serat2;1, and Serat2;2. In contrast, the expression of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 was low, suggesting distinct expression patterns among the Serat genes. Because of the low expression of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2, further analysis was conducted with the more sensitive method of real-time quantitative PCR (Figs. 6 and 7). Serat1;1, Serat2;1, and Serat2;2 expressed higher amounts of mRNA (approximately 10-fold) compared with Serat3;1 and Serat3;2, consistent with the results of northern blotting. Among them, Serat2;1 was the dominant form in most tissues examined, followed by Serat1;1 and Serat2;2. Each gene exhibited distinct expression patterns during plant development (Fig. 6). Serat1;1 and Serat2;1 showed a similar pattern, with an increase in expression at the vegetative stage (up to 3 weeks). During the reproductive phase (after 4 weeks), the expression levels of both genes were significantly reduced. Serat2;2 showed a different pattern, in which the expression increased over the first 2 weeks of growth, then decreased after 4 weeks to a lower level than at the start of the experiment. Expression increased after 4 weeks and reached a maximum value after 5 weeks. Interestingly, Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 had similar expression patterns but were distinctly different from other genes, showing expression at low levels in young stages and increased expression at the late stage after 5 weeks. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Expression of each Serat gene was further analyzed under the stress conditions of sulfur nutritional deficiency and cadmium (Cd) exposure (Fig. 7). Remarkably, under sulfur-deficient conditions, the mRNA levels of the three genes, Serat1;1, Serat2;1, and Serat2;2, did not change in both roots and shoots. Serat3;1 expression increased 2-fold at 96 h only in the roots. In contrast, Serat3;2 expression increased at 12 h (6–7-fold) and 96 h (40–45-fold) in both the roots and shoots, indicating that Serat3;2 may play a specific role under conditions of sulfur deficiency. In the roots of plants treated with Cd (50 μm), expression of all the genes increased except for Serat3;1. Notably Serat3;2 expression was increased in the roots (4-fold after 12 h) and in the shoots (12-fold after 12 h) by Cd treatment. In contrast, expression of the other Serat genes did not increase in the shoots.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Columbia ecotype) plants were grown on germination medium agar medium (CITATION) at 22°C under 16-h-light (approximately 2,500 lux) and 8-h-dark cycles. After 3 to 5 weeks, the plants were used either for isolation of total RNA or for particle bombardment. For the isolation of Serat3;2 cDNA, the specific primers were designed based on the sequences reported in the database (GenBank accession nos. AF331847 and CAB80280) and used for 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR using a Smart RACE PCR cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Tokyo, Japan). The first and second primer sets used for the nested PCR were respectively: 5′-CTCCTCTTCTGCTTCAGGCTTAGCTTCT-3′ and 5′-CTACCTTGTTGGCAACTCAGGTTATGGA-3′; 5′-CAGTCATGCGACAAGATACTAGATACA-3′ and 5′-TGCAACGTTATGGTACATGACAGAGTA-3′. The RACE products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega, Tokyo, Japan). Sequencing of full length DNA was carried out on both strands. Functional complementation by Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 was carried out with a Cys-auxotrophic E. coli JM39/5 (F+, cysE51, recA56) lacking cysE locus encoding endogenous SATase. The primers for cDNA amplification were: AGAGCCATGGATGGCGATGAGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-CATGCCATGGTCATGATGTGCTGTTAGTG-3′ for Serat3;1; and 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACGTCATGGCTTGTATAAACGGCG-3′ and 5′-CAGTCAGGATCCCTTTTTAATGTCTCCTTTCC-3′ for Serat3;2. The amplified fragments were cloned into pTV118N for functional expression in E. coli. For genetic complementation of the Cys requirement, the transformed E. coli was cultured on M9 minimal medium (CITATION) containing 100 μg/mL amplicilin and 500 μm IPTG at 37°C for 1 week. As a positive control pSAT2 carrying SATase gene of watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris) and pTV118N vector as a negative control, respectively, were used. The NcoI sites were created on both ends of the coding region of Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 by PCR engineering using primers: Serat3;1, 5′-AGAGCCATGGATGGCGATGAGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-CATGCCATGGTCATGATGTGCTGTTAGTG-3′; and Serat3;2, 5′-CAGTCAGGATCCATGGCTTGTATAAACGGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACTTAATGTCTCCTTTCCCT-3′. The engineered cDNA fragments were inserted into the NcoI site of pMAL-2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The cloned Serat genes were overexpressed in E. coli NovaBlue (endA1 hsdR17 supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1 lac; Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The gene under the tac promoter was induced by isopropyl thio-β-d-galactosidase (IPTG). Overnight cultures of E. coli NovaBlue carrying the expression vector were diluted 100-fold in a rich medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 5 g Glc) containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL), and incubated at 37°C, until the culture reached A600 approximately 0.5 (approximately 3 h). Subsequently, protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG, followed by further 3 h incubation time at 37°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 mL column buffer containing 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 11.7 g NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA, and 0.7 mL β-mercaptoethanol, and then disrupted by sonication (30 times at 60 W for 15 s each, on ice). After a second centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on an amylose resin column for affinity purification. The fusion protein was cleaved on the column with a Factor Xa, and the completely purified protein was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm maltose. The SATase reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm acetyl-CoA, 10 mm l-Ser, and the purified protein in a final volume of 100 μL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of l-Ser and proceeded for 1 h incubation at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μL of 7.5% TCA. SATase activity was determined by the production of OAS, that was derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde and then determined in the reverse-phase HPLC system as described previously (CITATION). The first 300 bp of the ORFs were PCR amplified and cloned into the SacI/XbaI sites of pFF19-GFP (kindly provided by A. Wachter, Heidelberg Institute for Plant Sciences, Germany). In this vector the GUS gene of pFF19-GUS (CITATION) was replaced by EGFP. For the positive controls, the plasmid pFF19-GFP, without any fusion protein was used as a control for localization of GFP in cytosol and partly in nuclei. For mitochondrial localization the transit peptide (first 52 aa) of the Arabidopsis SHMT (At5g26789) was fused to GFP, and for plastidic localization the transit peptide sequence (first 36 aa) from the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit polypeptide of pea (Pisum sativum) was used (constructs provided by A. Wachter, Heidelberg Institute for Plant Sciences, Germany). These plasmids were used for subsequent particle bombardment of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS plates (CITATION). Transient transformation was carried out with 5 μg of plasmid DNA on 25 mg gold particles using a PDS-1000/HE system according to the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). After bombardment seedlings were incubated for 16 h under standard light/dark conditions and GFP localization then visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM510 META system, excitation at 488 nm, emission GFP: 510–525 nm, Chlorophyll: 645–700 nm). Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and sown on germination medium with 1% Suc and 0.7% washed agar. For sulfur starvation experiments, sulfate ions in the medium were replaced with chloride ions. For Cd treatment experiments, CdCl2 was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. Tissue samples were harvested every week for 5 weeks. Total RNA was isolated using 100 mg of plant material from stored and stratified seeds, cotyledons, leaves, stems, roots, siliques, and flower tissues. Stratified seeds were firstly sown on agar plates and incubated for 3 d at 4°C, and then released to 22°C under continuous light (approximately 2,500 lux). Five nanograms of total RNA were used for real-time quantitative PCR analysis. The N-terminal region unique to each Serat gene was amplified by PCR using two synthetic primers together with TaqMan probe specific to each amplified fragment. TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for amplification according to the protocols provided by the supplier. The real-time quantitative PCR analysis was standardized based on equal quantities of RNA sample, and respective linearized plasmid DNA of each gene was used to draw a standard curve. The sequences are: for Serat1;1, PCR primers: 5′-TGGACACAGATCAAGGCGG-3′, 5′-ATGAGAAAGAATCGTCGAATATAGATAGC-3′, TaqMan probe: 5′-ATGCTGAGGCGGAGCCAGCTTTAGC-3′; for Serat2;1, PCR primers: 5′-CACATGCCGAACCGGTAATAC-3′, 5′-GGTGAATCTTCCGGTTTACAGAGA-3′, TaqMan probe: 5′-TGATTCCCGGTTCTGTTGCATCAAGA-3′; for Serat2;2, PCR primers: 5′-AATGGAACCCAGACCAAAACC-3′, 5′-GCCCAAACATCATCGACTTCA-3′, TaqMan probe: 5′-TCCATACTCGTCCTTTGCTTGAAGATCTCG-3′; for Serat3;1, PCR primers: 5′-ACGCTAAGGGAACTCATAAGTCAGA-3′, 5′-TCTTCTCTTATAGCATCCCAAATAGGA-3′, TaqMan probe: 5′-TTGACTCGAATTTGCTTGATCCTCGTTCTG-3′; for Serat3;2, PCR primers: 5′-CTCTTCCAATGATTGTCTCCCG-3′, 5′-CCTCTCGAAAGGAAACTCGTCA-3′, TaqMan probe: 5′-ACTTTTCTGCCAGAGACGATGGAGAGACC-3′. Each promoter region of 2.5-kb length in Arabidopsis genome was amplified and cloned into pUC19 to verify the sequence. Subsequently, the promoter fragment was introduced into the modified pB101 carrying the GFP-reporter gene from sGFP (65T; CITATION) instead of uidA. Arabidopsis plants were transformed using flower dip method (CITATION) with Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 (GV3101) carrying the promoter-GFP constructs. The oligonucleotides used are: Serat1;1, 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACACTCAAACTCACCCGGTCTA-3′ and 5′-CAGTCAGGATCCATTAACGCGGCGATAAGATT-3′; Serat2;1, 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACAACCTTAGACCCATTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTCAGGATCCGGTTTATGATTTGGAAGAAG-3′; Serat2;2, 5′-CAGTCATCTAGAAACTGAAAGGAAACAAAATA-3′ and 5′-CAGTCACCATGGTTTTTTTTTTTCTCGGCCAA-3′; Serat3;1, 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACGATGATCTGGACGTGCTACA-3′ and 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACATCTCTCCAAGGAGACGATA-3′; and Serat3;2, 5′-CAGTCAGTCGACAAAATCTTTGGTCTTTGCGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTCAGGATCCGACCAAAAAGAGTGAAGCTA-3′. GFP fluorescence was observed as reported previously (CITATION).
