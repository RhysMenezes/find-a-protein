!~ABS~! Seventeen loci encode proteins of the preprotein and amino acid transporter family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Some of these genes have arisen from recent duplications and are not in annotated duplicated regions of the Arabidopsis genome. In comparison to a number of other eukaryotic organisms, this family of proteins has greatly expanded in plants, with 24 loci in rice (Oryza sativa). Most of the Arabidopsis and rice genes are orthologous, indicating expansion of this family before monocot and dicot divergence. In vitro protein uptake assays, in vivo green fluorescent protein tagging, and immunological analyses of selected proteins determined either mitochondrial or plastidic localization for 10 and six proteins, respectively. The protein encoded by At5g24650 is targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts and, to our knowledge, is the first membrane protein reported to be targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts. Three genes encoded translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM)17-like proteins, three TIM23-like proteins, and three outer envelope protein16-like proteins in Arabidopsis. The identity of Arabidopsis TIM22-like proteins is most likely a protein encoded by At3g10110/At1g18320, based on phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization, and complementation of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant and coexpression analysis. The lack of a preprotein and amino acid transporter domain in some proteins, localization in mitochondria, plastids, or both, variation in gene structure, and the differences in expression profiles indicate that the function of this family has diverged in plants beyond roles in protein translocation.
!~RES~! A query of the most recent genome annotation for Arabidopsis searched with the text term TIM17 yields 17 distinct loci (The Arabidopsis Information Resource [TAIR] 6; http://www.arabidopsis.org). This represents a large increase in family size in comparison to yeast, where single genes encode the TIM17, 22, and 23 proteins that define this family. The predicted proteins range in size from 133 in TIM17-3 (At5g11690) to 261 amino acids in the protein encoded by At3g49560 (Table I; Fig. 1 ). Transmembrane-spanning regions were analyzed using the Dense Alignment Surface transmembrane predictor (CITATION) and compared to previously defined transmembrane regions in yeast TIM17, 22, and 23 (CITATION) and the proposed transmembrane structure of pea OEP16 (CITATION). Although this family of proteins is defined as having four transmembrane regions, in the Aramemnon database four transmembrane regions were only predicted for five of the 17 proteins using the consensus prediction of nine predictors. Some of these proteins were not even defined as membrane proteins (CITATION). However, because many predictors also fail to predict four transmembrane regions in the corresponding yeast proteins and, even for OEP16, where detailed investigation strongly supports four transmembrane regions, only two or three are predicted; thus, it is likely that more than five of the proteins have four transmembrane regions. A PRAT domain, previously used to define this family, was present in seven of the 17 Arabidopsis predicted proteins, whereas four contained a degenerate PRAT domain, with one additional amino acid spacing or with one of the consensus amino acids missing (Fig. 1; Table I; CITATION). An examination of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome yields a similar picture, with 24 genes encoding proteins in this family (Supplemental Fig. S1). [[FIGURE]] Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted Arabidopsis proteins with yeast TIM17, 22, 23, and OEP16 from pea is shown in Figure 2A . Three genes previously designated as encoding TIM17 (AtTIM17-1 [At1g20350], AtTIM17-2 [At2g37410], and TIM17-3 [At5g11690]) form a distinct group, which is close to yeast TIM17, and range in size from 133 amino acids in TIM17-3 (At5g11690) to 243 amino acids in TIM17-2 (At2g37410; CITATION). A clearly distinct grouping, previously designated TIM23, can also be observed with yeast TIM23 (AtTIM23-1 [At1g17530], AtTIM23-2 [At1g72750], and TIM23-3 [At3g04800]; CITATION). Three predicted proteins (At2g28900, At3g62880, and At4g16160) branch with pea OEP16, with sequence identity varying from 21% to 52% (Fig. 2A; Supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). These three groupings are maintained if the rice sequences are included (Supplemental Fig. S2). The situation with TIM22 is not as clear; if only proteins of Arabidopsis are analyzed, TIM22 of yeast branches with three proteins, namely, At1g18320, At3g10110, and At2g42210, but this grouping is not supported by bootstrapping (Fig. 2A). If the 24-member family of proteins from rice is included in the analysis, yeast TIM22 clusters with the two proteins encoded by At1g18320 and At3g10110 and a rice protein (Os03g18500), with some bootstrap support (Supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, in Arabidopsis, TIM22 is probably represented by At1g18320 and At3g10110. It becomes apparent by the poor bootstrap support of the basal nodes of both trees that the relationship of the three defined groups mentioned above and the residual proteins cannot be resolved. [[FIGURE]] Some genes display very high protein sequence identity, indicating they have likely arisen from recent duplications. At1g18320 and At3g10110 encode predicted proteins with 100% identity, but are not located on segments of chromosomes previously annotated to be duplicated (CITATION). The coding, 5′-, and 3′-untranslated regions are identical and are approximately 500 bp upstream of the annotated transcriptional start site. This high level of nucleic acid sequence identity is maintained for approximately 2 kb, until At3g10113 (downstream of At3g10110) and At1g18330 (downstream of At1g18320; data not shown). At4g26670 and At5g55510 encode predicted proteins that display 79% sequence identity and At3g49560 and At5g24650 encode predicted proteins that display 83% sequence identity. The former pair, as well as At1g17350 (TIM23-1) and At1g72750 (TIM23-2), which display 83% protein identity, are located in previously annotated duplicated regions of the Arabidopsis genome (CITATION). Analysis of the gene structures reveals that the genes defined as TIM17 or TIM23 contain no introns in the coding regions, but, for the other members, the number of introns varies from one in the coding region (At2g42210) to six (At4g16160), leading to quite variable gene structures (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the expansion of this family of proteins is restricted to Arabidopsis, plants, or has taken place in other eukaryotic lineages, we examined the number of genes encoding mitochondrial protein import components in a variety of organisms. A bioinformatic approach was undertaken to identify homologs to the yeast protein import machinery in Arabidopsis, rice, Neurospora crassa, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. The results were entered into a relational database that can be accessed at http://www.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/MPRIC. Homologs to the majority of yeast import components were identified in all organisms, with the exception of TOM5 (found in yeast, Arabidopsis, and rice), TOM6 (found in yeast, Arabidopsis, and N. crassa), MDM10/TOB38/TIM12/HOT13p/SOM1/MBA1 (found only in yeast), TOM34 (found only in animals and N. crassa), TOM70/TOM72 (not found in plants), TIM18 and TIM54 (found only in yeast and N. crassa), PAM17 (found only in yeast, N. crassa, and C. elegans), and IMP1/IMP2 (not found in N. crassa). Whereas the genomes of yeast and N. crassa encode only a single isoform of each component (except for ERV1 and OXA1 in N. crassa, and mtHSP70 in yeast and N. crassa), plant and animal genomes often encode the import components in small multiple-gene families. This is particularly evident for TOM7/TOM20/TOM40/PAM18 (plants and animals), TIM8/TIM9 (animals), TIM17 (plants and animals), and TIM22/TIM23 (plants). Of particular interest is the large size of the TIM17/TIM22/TIM23 family in both Arabidopsis and rice and the relatively large number of genes encoding members of this family that cannot be assigned or whose function is unknown, indicating that these gene families have undergone extensive expansion in plants. Examination of the PRAT family of proteins in rice indicates that there are orthologous genes for all those found in Arabidopsis, indicating that this family of proteins diverged before the split of the monocot/dicot lineages (http://www.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/MPRIC; Supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The number of genes in each grouping differs, indicating duplication after lineage divergence, but strongly suggesting that the large size of this family of proteins is a general feature of angiosperms. Rice genes encoded by Os03g30220, Os03g30230, and Os04g30740 do not appear to have orthologs in Arabidopsis. Examination of the protein alignment (Supplemental Fig. S1) indicates that they are not highly conserved in the region containing the PRAT domain and thus they may represent pseudogenes or incorrect annotations. Because proteins encoded by different members of this family have been reported in chloroplasts and mitochondria (Table I), we determined the subcellular localization of all the encoded proteins in vitro using protein uptake assays into isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts, and in vivo using green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging. As controls, we used the small subunit of Rubisco (rbcS) for in vitro chloroplast import (CITATION) and the maize (Zea mays) phosphate translocator (ZmPic) and adenine nucleotide translocator (ZmANT) for in vitro mitochondrial import (CITATION; CITATION) because this family of proteins is imported via the carrier import pathway (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). For in vivo GFP localization, we used the red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to the targeting signal for mitochondrial alternative oxidase (Aox; Aox-RFP) or fused to the targeting signal of rbcS (rbcS-RFP). Arabidopsis suspension cells were transiently transformed with a PRAT protein fused to GFP and Aox-RFP or rbcS-RFP. Fluorescence was collected at the appropriate wavelength and images were merged to determine the location of the PRAT-GFP fusion protein. Mitochondrial localization was defined for the three proteins belonging to the TIM17 and TIM23 families using both in vitro uptake assays and in vivo GFP localization of proteins (Fig. 3 ). In vitro incubation of radiolabeled proteins with purified mitochondria resulted in a protease-protected band (Fig. 3, lane 3). This band was either abolished or diminished in intensity if the ionophore valinomycin was added to the import reaction prior to commencement (Fig. 3, lane 5). In yeast, TIM17, 22, and 23 are imported via the carrier import pathway, where stage II or IIIa intermediates are bound to the import receptor or translocated through the TOM40 pore, respectively. Such intermediates are resistant to protease digestion even in the absence of a membrane potential because they have not yet come into interaction with the inner membrane. Thus, to verify that the protease-protected protein is inserted into the inner membrane, we ruptured the outer membrane to allow access of added protease to the inner membrane. Inner membrane proteins are still protected from added protease, or produce inner membrane-protected fragments, whereas import intermediates are digested (CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). Treatment of outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria with protease resulted in a protease-protected band that was absent if valinomycin was present in the import assay (Fig. 3, lanes 7 versus 9). The exception was TIM17-3 (At5g11690), where a protease-protected band was only observed with intact mitochondria (Fig. 3, lane 3 versus lane 7). Because this protein contains only 133 amino acids, it is possible that the lack of protection in outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria is due to the fact that it does not have the four transmembrane-spanning regions typical of this family; the protein ends in the middle of the region where the fourth transmembrane region is predicted for yeast TIM17 (Fig. 1). Mitochondrial localization was confirmed for all TIM17 and TIM23 proteins because linking GFP to the C terminus yielded a mitochondrial pattern as determined by colocalization of the GFP signal with Aox-RFP. Some differences were observed with the GFP signal; whereas TIM17-3 (At5g11690) yielded a typical mitochondrial pattern of numerous small particles, the GFP pattern in other constructs, although concentrated in small particles, was more intense and appeared to encompass a greater surface area of the cell. This may be due to the fact that the GFP moiety may, in some cases, still remain outside the mitochondrion; as for TIM17-2 (At2g37410), the C terminus portion is in the outer membrane accessible by externally added protease (CITATION). Furthermore, the ability of GFP to dimerize may contribute to this altered mitochondrial pattern. However, in all cases, the GFP pattern overlapped with the Aox-RFP pattern. Furthermore, there was no evidence of import into purified chloroplasts, there were no protease-protected products detected, and binding appeared to be very low (Fig. 3). [[FIGURE]] Similar analysis was carried out with the proteins encoded by the 11 remaining genes (Fig. 4 ). Because At1g18320 and At3g10110 are 100% identical, only one cDNA was used in the analysis. Mitochondrial localization was defined for the proteins encoded by At1g18320/At3g10110, At2g42210, and At3g25120. All three proteins yielded a typical mitochondrial pattern when tagged with GFP and there was no protease protection upon incubation with chloroplasts. For At1g18320/At3g10110 and At3g25120, it was concluded that the proteins were located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, based on the fact that a distinct inner membrane protease-protected band was observed with outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria (Fig. 4, lane 7). At2g42210 displayed some unusual features upon import into mitochondria. Incubation of the 18-kD protein with mitochondria and protease treatment produced an additional product with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kD (Fig. 4, lane 3). An identical pattern was observed when valinomycin was present in the import assay and when the outer membrane was removed before protease treatment (Fig. 4, lanes 4–7). Notably, the addition of valinomycin and rupture of the outer membrane prior to protease treatment resulted in complete digestion (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and 9). Thus, the similarity in the protected fragments in the presence and absence of valinomycin may be due to the fact that, in the presence of valinomycin, insertion into the outer membrane results in the same region being protected as insertion into the inner membrane in the absence of valinomycin. [[FIGURE]] The OEP16-like proteins, encoded by At2g28900, At3g62880, and At4g16160, were designated as targeted to chloroplasts. This was based on the fact that the pattern of GFP observed was identical to rbcS-RFP (Fig. 4). In the case of At3g62880, plastidic targeting only took place when GFP was fused to the N-terminal region of the encoded protein. In comparison to the mitochondrial pattern, in these cells, the oval-shaped GFP fluorescence spots were larger (>2 μm) and fewer in number. Additionally, none of these proteins were imported into mitochondria, based on the observation that no protease-protected products were observed under any conditions. Import into isolated chloroplasts yielded protected products for At2g28900 and At4g16160; notably, the latter had an apparent molecular mass of 14 kD compared to the precursor protein of 22 kD (Fig. 4). The protein encoded by At3g62880 did not yield protease-protected products upon incubation with chloroplasts (Fig. 4). In fact, the protein did not even bind to chloroplasts. In vitro targeting assays did not yield definitive subcellular localization with the proteins encoded by At3g49560 and At5g24650. With isolated mitochondria, protease-protected products were consistently detected even in the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 4). Notably, both proteins are digested to completion upon protease treatment with outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria. This may indicate that the proteins were inserted into the outer membrane. On the other hand, incubation with isolated chloroplasts also resulted in protease protection, indicating successful import (either in the inner or outer membrane of the chloroplasts). However, for both organelles, it cannot be excluded that the observed protease protection results from unspecific binding of the proteins on the surface of the organelles. With GFP targeting, two patterns were evident; for At3g49560, clear plastidic localization was evident, whereas for At5g24650, mitochondrial localization was concluded based on colocalization with Aox-RFP. To verify the subcellular localization of the proteins encoded by At3g49560 and At5g24650, antibodies were raised against the overexpressed protein encoded by At3g49560. Because this protein and the protein encoded by At5g24650 display 83% identity, the antibody cross-reacts with both proteins, but not with a variety of other overexpressed PRAT proteins (Fig. 5, A and C ). The protein encoded by At5g24650 has a small, but detectable, higher apparent molecular mass than that encoded by At3g49560 (Fig. 5A). Western-blot analyses with antibodies raised against the protein encoded by At3g49560 detect a prominent band in chloroplasts and a weaker band with a slightly higher molecular mass (Fig. 5D). Probing mitochondria with this antibody only detects the higher band (i.e. the protein encoded by At5g24650). Probing the mitochondrial fraction with antibodies to other chloroplast proteins such as POR of chloroplasts and OEP37 reveals no cross-reaction, indicating no significant contamination of purified mitochondria with chloroplasts. Thus, given that only the upper band is detected and that there is no significant contamination, it was concluded that the protein encoded by At5g24650 was located in mitochondria and chloroplasts and the protein encoded by At3g49560 was located in chloroplasts. [[FIGURE]] Subcellular localization of the protein encoded by At4g26670 could not be defined by in vivo and in vitro targeting studies. C-terminal GFP tagging did not yield a pattern that corresponded to either mitochondrial or plastidic localization; N-terminal GFP tagging indicated nuclear localization, a pattern frequently observed with GFP if it is not targeted to any localization in the cell. Utilization of an RFP peroxisomal-targeted protein indicated that the protein was not targeted to peroxisomes (data not shown; CITATION). Western-blot analysis of isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria using an antibody raised against the At4g26670 protein yielded a strong band in the chloroplast fraction, strongly suggesting a chloroplastidic location for this protein (Fig. 5D). The antibody raised against At4g26670 did not recognize the protein encoded by At5g55510 (Fig. 5B), which encodes for a 79% identical protein. This protein, however, showed a clear plastidic pattern when tagged with C-terminal GFP (Fig. 4). Because TIM22 is an essential protein in yeast and the identity of the ortholog was unclear in Arabidopsis, the ability of various PRAT proteins imported into isolated mitochondria to complement a yeast mutant for lacking a functional TIM22 protein was tested (CITATION). The endogenous yeast TIM22 gene was placed under the Gal promoter so that its expression was dependent on the presence of Gal in the growth medium. The ability of three Arabidopsis genes to complement this strain was tested, At1g18320/At3g10110, At2g42210, and At3g25120. Culturing of yeast on Gal-free medium resulted in only At1g18320/At3g10110 supporting growth (Fig. 6 ). Thus, only At1g18320/At3g10110 could support a TIM22 function under the conditions tested. Previously, we have shown that the Arabidopsis orthologs for TIM17 and TIM23 can also complement yeast mutants (CITATION). Thus, it appears that the function of these translocases is well conserved across wide phylogenetic gaps and suggests that At2g42210 and At3g25120 may not play roles in protein transport. [[FIGURE]] Because this family of genes was initially defined in yeast as being essential for the process of protein import into mitochondria (CITATION), and OEP16 is proposed to be involved in the import of POR A into chloroplasts (CITATION, CITATION), we examined the transcript abundance of all members of this family in comparison to transcripts encoding components of the mitochondrial, chloroplast, and peroxisome protein import apparatus. We also included several other metabolic components whose subcellular localization has been defined (Supplemental Table S1). We used quantitative reverse transcription (QRT)-PCR analysis to examine transcript abundance over development in leaves from 0 weeks (just emerged) to 6 weeks (senescence) for 77 genes (CITATION; CITATION). A distinct pattern emerged when analyzed using self-organizing map analysis (Fig. 7 ; CITATION; CITATION). For a number of genes encoding components defined as being located in chloroplasts, transcript abundance was initially high, after which it declined steadily (Fig. 7; Supplemental Table S1). This pattern was also observed with genes encoding the P-subunit of Gly decarboxylase and hydroxypyruvate reductase, located in mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively, and playing a well-characterized role in the photorespiratory cycle (CITATION). Three genes of the PRAT family, At2g28900, At3g49560, and At4g26670, exhibited a similar pattern. For At2g28900 and At4g26670, this is in agreement with chloroplastidic location as defined above (Figs. 4 and 5). Also, for the protein encoded by At3g49560, a chloroplastidic expression pattern is consistent with immunological analysis (Fig. 5). Cluster groups 2 and 3 were dominated by genes encoding mitochondrial components and yet contained the gene At3g62880 of the PRAT family encoding a protein defined as having a chloroplast location. Notably, the undefined PRAT proteins encoded by At2g42210 and At3g25120, defined as mitochondrial by in vitro and in vivo targeting studies, displayed a pattern of expression consistent with mitochondrial location. So does the protein encoded by At5g24650; this further supports dual localization for the protein. According to available public microarray data (see below), At4g16160 is not expressed in rosette leaves; analysis of transcript abundance by QRT-PCR is in agreement with this, where expression was extremely low or not detectable (data not shown). Due to the 100% sequence identity between At1g18320 and At3g10110, it was not possible to determine the expression of either unambiguously. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! BLAST and PSI-BLAST algorithms were used to search protein databases for proteins displaying significant homology to import components characterized in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; CITATION). Hits from this search with expectation values ≤10−5 were then used to query yeast protein databases. If the hit with the greatest confidence in this search was the yeast import component sequence used in the initial search, the protein was termed a putative protein import component. Proteins were aligned using ClustalX (CITATION, CITATION). Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the program PAUP (CITATION). Only the conserved region of the proteins around the PRAT domain was used in the phylogenic analyses. Data were bootstrap resampled 100 times. Gene structures were obtained from TAIR 6 and three individual cDNA clones were sequenced. In vitro protein import assays into isolated mitochondria from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were carried out as previously described (CITATION). Outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria were prepared by osmotic shock (CITATION). In vitro protein import assays into isolated chloroplasts from pea (Pisum sativum) were carried out as previously outlined (CITATION). GFP targeting was carried out by cloning GFP in frame to the N or C terminus of the cDNA clone and transformation of Arabidopsis suspension cells by biolistic transformation (CITATION; CITATION). RFP was fused to the targeting signal of soybean (Glycine max) Aox-RFP and pea rbcS-RFP as mitochondrial and plastidic controls, respectively (CITATION). Fluorescence patterns were obtained 48 h after transformation by visualization under an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope and imaged using Cell imaging software. Antibodies were raised in rabbit against recombinant protein encoded by At4g26670 and At3g49560, respectively (Pineda Antikörper-Service). Proteins with a 6x-His tag located on the C terminus were expressed and purified on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Chloroplasts from 14-d-old Arabidopsis plants grown on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium were isolated as described by CITATION. Mitochondria from 4-week-old plants were isolated according to CITATION. Specificity of the antibodies was tested on different recombinant proteins of the PRAT protein family of Arabidopsis. The yeast strain expressing ScTIM22 under the control of the GAL promoter (GAL-TIM22) has been described previously (CITATION). Because TIM22 is a protein essential for yeast cell viability, this strain requires Gal in the medium for growth. For complementation analysis, Arabidopsis open reading frames At3g25120, At2g42210, and At1g18320/At3g10110 were cloned into the yeast vector pVT-U, which enables the expression of cloned genes under the constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (CITATION). Obtained plasmids were transformed into the GAL-TIM22 yeast strain using the lithium acetate method (CITATION). Empty plasmid and the plasmid containing ScTIM22 were transformed as controls. The ability of various proteins to substitute for ScTIM22 was assessed on the selective medium lacking or containing 0.5% (w/v) Gal (CITATION). Two independent transformants were analyzed for each transformation and gave identical results. QRT-PCR was carried out on RNA isolated from second rosette leaves at different times; the initial time point, labeled 0, was when leaves just emerged and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after this time. At 6 weeks, the leaves were pale green or yellowing and in an advanced stage of senescence. QRT-PCR was carried out as previously described with the gene listed (CITATION). The nucleic acid sequences for AtTIM23 and AtTIM17 have been deposited previously in GenBank with the accession numbers At1g20350:AY463969 (AtTIM17-1); At2g37410:AY463970 (AtTIM17-2); At5g11690:AY463971 (AtTIM17-3); At1g17350:AY463972 (AtTIM23-1); At1g72750:AY463973 (AtTIM23-1); and At3g04800:AY463974 (AtTIM23-3). The GenBank accession numbers for the remaining cDNA sequences used in this study are as follows: At1g18320: DQ405269; At3g10110: DQ405268; At2g28900 (OEP16-like): AAC79594; At2g42210: DQ386643; At3g25120: DQ405272; At3g49560: DQ405266; At3g62880 (OEP16-like): CAB83138; At4g16160 (OEP16-like): CAB10395; At4g26670: DQ405270; At5g24650: DQ405267; and At5g55510: DQ405271.
