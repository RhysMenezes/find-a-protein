!~ABS~! Nine genes that encode proteins of the MAP65 family have been identified in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. In this study, we reported that AtMAP65-2, a member of the AtMAP65 family, could strongly stabilize microtubules (MTs). Bacterially-expressed AtMAP65-2 fusion proteins induced the formation of large MT bundles in vitro. Although AtMAP65-2 showed little effect on MT assembly or nucleation, AtMAP65-2 greatly stabilized MTs that were subjected to low-temperature treatment in vitro. Analyses of truncated versions of AtMAP65-2 indicated that the region that encompassed amino acids 495–578, which formed a flexible extended loop, played a crucial role in the stabilization of MTs. Analysis of suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells that expressed the AtMAP65-2-GFP fusion protein showed that AtMAP65-2 co-localized with MTs throughout the cell cycle. Cortical MTs that were decorated with AtMAP65-2-GFP were more resistant to the MT-disrupting drug propyzamide and to ice treatment in vivo. The results of this study demonstrate that AtMAP65-2 strongly stabilizes MTs and is involved in the regulation of MT organization and dynamics.
!~RES~! The cDNA sequence for AtMAP65-2 was obtained by RT-PCR and introduced into the pET-30a(+) vector. The His-AtMAP65-2 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified for further analysis in vitro. SDS-PAGE showed that the purified His-AtMAP65-2 corresponded to a major band with a molecular weight of ~70 kD (Fig. 1a), which was recognized by the anti-polyhistidine antibody (Fig. 1b). Binding of AtMAP65-2 to MTs was detected, and quantified by co-sedimentation analysis. In the absence of MTs, AtMAP65-2 was found predominantly (~90%) in the supernatant (Fig. 1c, Lane 6) with a little (~10%) in the pellets (Fig. 1c, Lane 5). After the addition of Taxol-stabilized MTs, however, the amount of AtMAP65-2 in the pellets increased significantly and the amount in the supernatants decreased. When 5 μM AtMAP65-2 was incubated with 4 μM MTs, the amount in the pellets increased from 10%, in the absence of MTs, to 40% (Fig. 1c, Lane 3). Therefore, the AtMAP65-2 fusion protein bound to and co-sedimented with MTs in vitro. [[FIGURE]]  The effect of AtMAP65-2 on MT polymerization was measured by an assay that monitored the changes in turbidity of a tubulin suspension after the addition of the fusion protein. When 2 or 4 μM AtMAP65-2 was added, the absorbance at 350 nm, after tubulin polymerization had reached a steady state, increased seven- or 15-fold compared to that in the presence of tubulin alone (Fig. 2a). However, two possibilities could account for such results: (i) the total amount of MT polymers increased in the presence of AtMAP65-2; (ii) this phenomenon was produced by MT bundling. Therefore, we polymerized MTs in the presence of varying concentrations of AtMAP65-2, and detected the amount of tubulin in the pellets after co-sedimentation by SDS-PAGE and densitometry (Fig. 2b, c). Paclitaxel, which is able to promote tubulin assembly, was used as a positive control. The results showed that, with the addition of increasing concentrations of AtMAP65-2 (0–10 μM), the amount of AtMAP65-2 increased correspondingly, both in the pellets and supernatants (Fig. 2b, Lanes 2–8). However, the amount of tubulin in the pellets did not change significantly with the increasing amounts of AtMAP65-2 (Fig. 2b, Lanes 1–8). Paclitaxel promoted tubulin assembly strongly and increased the amount of tubulin in the pellet (Fig. 2b, Lane 9). This result indicated that AtMAP65-2 was capable of promoting MT bundling but did not promote tubulin assembly. [[FIGURE]]  The lag time of tubulin assembly, which is an indicator of the efficiency of MT nucleation, was also calculated from the turbidity curves that were obtained with varying concentrations of AtMAP65-2. The lag times were all ~3 min regardless of the concentration of AtMAP65-2 that was present (Fig. 2d, see arrow). Therefore, AtMAP65-2 did not affect the nucleation of tubulin polymerization. Furthermore, the MT-bundling effect of AtMAP65-2 was investigated by confocal and electron microscopy. Taxol-stabilized MTs, which had been polymerized from rhodamine-labeled tubulin, existed as single filaments in the absence of AtMAP65-2, as seen by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2e) or negative-staining electron microscopy (Fig. 2h). In the presence of AtMAP65-2, the formation of large MT bundles was induced (Fig. 2f, i). To confirm the effect of AtMAP65-2 on MT bundling, 200 mM NaCl was added to the solution to strip the AtMAP65-2 protein from the MTs. MT bundles whose formation had been induced by the presence of AtMAP65-2 were dispersed into single filaments after the addition of 200 mM NaCl (Fig. 2g). Therefore, we conclude that AtMAP65-2 is capable of bundling MTs. Due to the fact that AtMAP65-2 exhibited little effect on MT polymerization and nucleation but did promote MT bundling, we further examined whether AtMAP65-2 had the ability to stabilize MTs. Tubulin depolymerization that had been induced in vitro by cold treatment in the presence or absence of AtMAP65-2 was monitored (Fig. 3). Tubulin at a concentration of 20 μM was assembled into MTs for 30 min at 35°C. When 14 μM AtMAP65-2 protein was added, the absorbance, after tubulin polymerization had reached a steady state, increased more than 30-fold (Fig. 3), which was mainly due to MT bundling. The temperature was then dropped from 35 to 4°C and the absorbance was recorded for another 30 min. In the absence of AtMAP65-2, the MTs disassembled quickly after the temperature dropped to 4°C (Fig. 3, inset 1). However, in the presence of AtMAP65-2, the curve dropped much more slowly and gradually, which indicated that the MTs were more stable under cold treatment (Fig. 3, inset 2). [[FIGURE]]  It has been reported previously that AtMAP65-1 has some stabilizing effect on MTs at 10°C but does not significantly increase their stability at 1°C (Mao et al. CITATION; Smertenko et al. CITATION). Therefore, we tested the stabilizing effect of AtMAP65-2 on MTs during incubation on ice, and used AtMAP65-1 fusion protein as a control. AtMAP65-2 at a concentration of 5 μM or AtMAP65-1 at 10 μM was incubated with 20 μM rhodamine-labeled tubulin at 35°C for 30 min to allow tubulin polymerization. The solution was then placed on ice for 30 min before fixation. After fixation, the samples were observed by confocal microscopy. The results showed that single MT filaments (Fig. 4a) or MT bundles (Fig. 4b) that had been induced by AtMAP65-1 were fully disassembled after ice treatment (Fig. 4c, d). However, many of the MTs that had formed in the presence of AtMAP65-2 persisted after the ice treatment (Fig. 4e), even after the addition of 5 mM CaCl2, which accelerates MT depolymerization (Fig. 4f). Therefore, AtMAP65-2 was a stronger stabilizer of MTs than AtMAP65-1. [[FIGURE]]  Although AtMAP65-2 shares a high degree of amino acid identity with AtMAP65-1, the results of the above-described experiments showed that they exhibited different MT-stabilizing capacities, especially during ice treatment in vitro. Therefore, we asked which amino acids of AtMAP65-2 were responsible for this difference. A previous study has indicated that amino acids 340–494 of AtMAP65-1 form the region that is most highly conserved between the members of the AtMAP65 family (Smertenko et al. CITATION). After aligning the amino acids of AtMAP65-2 with those of AtMAP65-1, we found that, with the exception of the conserved MT-binding region (Table 1), the degree of identity between the N-terminal portions of the two proteins was ~83.78%, whereas that between the residual C-terminal portions was 59.14% (Supplementary Fig. 1). The most diverse region between the two proteins corresponded to amino acids 495–587 of AtMAP65-1 and 495–578 of AtMAP65-2. Amino acids 495–587 of AtMAP65-1 form a disordered loop (Li et al. CITATION). Therefore, bioinformatic analysis was employed to investigate the protein structure of AtMAP65-2. There is a high probability (0.6–0.8) that AtMAP65-2 contains three coiled-coil domains, which are formed by amino acids 19–86 (at the N terminus), 149–184, and 357–389 (Fig. 5a, b). An NORS between amino acids 481 and 578 of AtMAP65-2 was also predicted (Fig. 5b) according to the criteria of Liu and Rost (CITATION).[[TABLE]] [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]] In order to investigate whether the NORS in AtMAP65-2 is critical for its role in MT stabilization, truncated versions of AtMAP65-2 were created based on the alignment of all AtMAP65 amino acid sequences that were described by Smertenko (2004). Five truncated versions were generated: (i) the N-terminal portion of AtMAP65-2 (denoted as AtMAP65-2 1–339), which comprised amino acids 1–339 and was mainly α-helical; (ii) the C-terminal portion (denoted as AtMAP65-2 340–578), which comprised amino acids 340–578, and consisted of an α-helix and the NORS; (iii) amino acids 340–494, which corresponded to the MT-binding region, and is the domain that is most conserved between the members of the AtMAP65 family; (iv) amino acids 495–578 (denoted as AtMAP65-2 495–578), which corresponded to the NORS alone; and (v) amino acids 1–494 (denoted as AtMAP65-2 1–494), which comprised the remainder of the protein after the NORS had been deleted (Fig. 5c). Firstly, co-sedimentation experiments were performed to analyze the MT-binding activities of the five truncated proteins. The results showed that four of the truncated proteins, AtMAP65-2 340–578, AtMAP65-2 1–494, AtMAP65-2 340–494, and AtMAP65-2 495–578, could bind to MTs, whereas AtMAP65-2 1–339, which comprised the N-terminal half of the protein, did not bind to MTs (Supplementary Fig. 2, Fig. 5c). In order to identify the region of AtMAP65-2 that is crucial for the stabilization of MTs, the AtMAP65-2 340–578 and AtMAP65-2 1–494 truncated proteins were used for further biochemical analysis. The two truncated fusion proteins were co-incubated with rhodamine-labeled tubulin at 37°C for 30 min. The MTs that assembled in the absence of any AtMAP65-2 protein were present as single filaments (Fig. 5d). However, after the addition of 10 μM AtMAP65-2 340–578 or AtMAP65-2 1–494, large MT bundles formed (Fig. 5e, f). Then the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, after which they were fixed and examined by confocal microscopy. This revealed that the MTs were disassembled both in the presence or absence of AtMAP65-2 1–494 (Fig. 5h, j). However, AtMAP65-2 340–578 and full-length AtMAP65-2 were both capable of stabilizing the MTs (Fig. 5i, k). This result demonstrated that it is the disordered loop, and not the N-terminal portion, that is essential for the stabilization of MTs by AtMAP65-2 during ice treatment. Members of the AtMAP65 family exhibit different patterns of co-localization with MTs in vivo (Van Damme et al. CITATION). However, the cellular localization of AtMAP65-2 has not been reported. In order to investigate this localization, a construct was generated that encoded AtMAP65-2 with an N-terminal GFP tag. To confirm that the GFP tag did not disrupt the activity of AtMAP65-2, AtMAP65-2-GFP fusion protein was expressed and purified from E. coli. The results of co-sedimentation experiments with Taxol-stabilized MTs showed that more AtMAP65-2-GFP fusion protein was found in the pellets in the presence of MTs, as compared to in their absence (Fig. 6a). This result indicated that the GFP tag did not affect AtMAP65-2 binding to MTs in vivo. When 2 μM AtMAP65-2-GFP was incubated with 2 μM rhodamine-labeled, Taxol-stabilized MTs for 15 min, and the samples were observed under a confocal microscope, the results showed that the fluorescent signal from AtMAP65-2-GFP was distributed smoothly along the MT bundles. This indicated that the AtMAP65-2-GFP co-localized with and bundled the MTs (Fig. 6b–d). After the addition of 200 mM NaCl, the GFP signal could not be detected and the MT bundles were dispersed into single filaments (Fig. 6e–g). Based on these observations, we concluded that AtMAP65-2-GFP can bind to and bundle MTs. [[FIGURE]]  Therefore, the localization of AtMAP65-2 in cells was investigated by expressing the AtMAP65-2-GFP protein in suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells. In addition to the detection of the GFP signal from AtMAP65-2-GFP, the MTs were visualized by immunofluoresence microscopy. Dual fluorescence imaging of the MTs (red) and AtMAP65-2 (green) revealed that AtMAP65-2-GFP was evenly distributed along the cortical MTs (Fig. 7a–c). During M-phase, AtMAP65-2 was localized to the preprophase band (Fig. 7d–g). During cell division, AtMAP65-2 also decorated the entire mitotic spindle (Fig. 7h–k). However, during the anaphase to telophase transition, AtMAP65-2 was integrated and concentrated in the midline where oppositely oriented phragmoplast MTs overlapped (Fig. 7l–o). In the phragmoplast, AtMAP65-2 co-localized completely with the MTs (Fig. 7p–s). [[FIGURE]]  Due to the fact that we showed that MTs were stabilized in vitro at low temperatures by the presence of AtMAP65-2, we investigated whether AtMAP65-2 could exert this stabilizing effect in vivo. Suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells that stably expressed AtMAP65-2-GFP were treated on ice for 60 min, and then fixed before being examined by confocal microscopy. Dual fluorescence imaging of the MTs and AtMAP65-2-GFP was performed. Prior to low-temperature treatment, the control cells contained thin cortical MT bundles (Fig. 8a), whereas thicker bundles of cortical MTs that were labeled with AtMAP65-2-GFP were observed in cells that were expressing AtMAP65-2-GFP (Fig. 8d, g). After incubation on ice, the cortical MTs in the control cells were disassembled into small dispersed spots (Fig. 8b). However, most of the cortical MTs remained intact in the presence of AtMAP65-2-GFP (Fig. 8e, h). This observation indicated that AtMAP65-2 also stabilized MTs during cold treatment in vivo. [[FIGURE]]  Many members of the AtMAP65 family have been reported to protect MTs against the effects of MT-disrupting drugs, for example, AtMAP65-5 renders MTs resistant to oryzalin (Van Damme et al. CITATION). Therefore, we tested whether AtMAP65-2 also has this protecting ability, using the MT-disrupting drug propyzamide. In control cells, cortical MTs were disrupted within 60 min after the addition of 6 μM propyzamide (Fig. 8c). In contrast, many MTs in cells that were expressing AtMAP65-2-GFP remained intact even after treatment with 6 μM propyzamide for 2 h (Fig. 8f, i). Thus, the expression of AtMAP65-2-GFP increased the resistance of MTs to propyzamide.
!~MM~! The full-length cDNA sequence of AtMAP65-2 was amplified by RT-PCR. The known cDNA sequence (GenBank; Accession Number NM-118810) was used to design appropriate primers for the amplification: AtMAP65-2 forward: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCAGTGACAGAAGC-3′ (with the introduced BamHI site underlined), and AtMAP65-2 reverse: 5′-TTGCGGCCGCTCACGGTGAAGCCATCAC-3′ (with the introduced NotI site underlined). Amplified products were A-tailed, cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara Bio, China) at the BamHI and NotI sites, and verified by sequencing. Full-length cDNAs for AtMAP65-2 were subcloned into the vector pET30a at the BamHI and NotI sites. His-tagged fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Porcine brain tubulin was purified and labeled with 5-(and 6-)carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (NHS)-rhodamine as reported previously (Castoldia and Popov CITATION; Hyman CITATION). Analysis of the co-sedimentation of the fusion proteins with the MTs was carried out according to the previously published protocols (Mao et al. CITATION). For the NaCl treatment, rhodamine-labeled, Taxol-stabilized MTs were incubated with 5 μM AtMAP65-2 in PEM buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 100 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 6.9) at room temperature for 30 min. NaCl (200 mM) was then added and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, after incubation for 10 min. The samples were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Electron microscopy was performed as described previously (Mao et al. CITATION), using a Hitachi 7500 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). To express the GFP fusion protein stably in living cells, the full-length AtMAP65-2 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pBI221 vector. In addition, the cDNAs for AtMAP65-2 and GFP were amplified and introduced into the expression vector pCAMBIA1300, which contained a CaMV 35S promoter. Suspension-cultured Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia cells were transformed with the constructs as described previously (Geelen and Inze CITATION; Forreiter et al. CITATION). The samples were examined by confocal microscopy (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). AtMAP65-2 protein at a concentration of 14 μM was added to 20 μM tubulin in PEM buffer with 1 mM GTP. After the tubulin had assembled at 35°C for 30 min, the temperature was dropped immediately to 4°C, at which it was maintained for 30 min. The whole process was monitored turbidimetrically by measuring the absorbance at 350 nm using a 0.4-cm path quartz cell in a DU-640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). To visualize the MTs after the ice treatment, rhodamine-labeled tubulin was polymerized in PEM buffer that contained 1 mM GTP in the presence or absence of 5 μM AtMAP65-2 or the AtMAP65-2 truncation proteins at 35°C for 30 min. After incubation, the samples were transferred immediately to ice for 30 min. Then the samples were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for observation by confocal microscopy.
