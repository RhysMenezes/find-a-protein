!~ABS~! During plant reproduction, the central cell of the female gametophyte becomes fertilized to produce the endosperm, a storage tissue that nourishes the developing embryo within the seed. The molecular mechanisms controlling the specification and differentiation of the central cell are poorly understood. We identified a female gametophyte mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana, fem111, that is affected in central cell development. In fem111 female gametophytes, the central cell's nucleolus and vacuole fail to mature properly. In addition, endosperm development is not initiated after fertilization of fem111 female gametophytes. fem111 contains a T-DNA insertion in AGAMOUS-LIKE80 (AGL80). FEM111/AGL80 is a member of the MADS box family of genes that likely encode transcription factors. An AGL80–green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. Within the ovule and seed, FEM111/AGL80 is expressed exclusively in the central cell and uncellularized endosperm. FEM111/AGL80 expression is also detected in roots, leaves, floral stems, anthers, and young flowers by real-time RT-PCR. FEM111/AGL80 is required for the expression of two central cell–expressed genes, DEMETER and DD46, but not for a third central cell–expressed gene, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED2. Together, these data suggest that FEM111/AGL80 functions as a transcription factor within the central cell gene regulatory network and controls the expression of downstream genes required for central cell development and function.
!~RES~! We previously identified a large collection of female gametophyte mutants using the criteria of segregation distortion and reduced seed set (CITATION). One of these mutants, fem111, is described here. As summarized in Table 1 , fem111 exhibited segregation distortion in self-crosses (P < 0.001), suggesting that the gametophyte generation is affected. To determine whether the fem111 mutation affects the female gametophyte, we crossed fem111/FEM111 females with wild-type males and scored the number of fem111/FEM111 and FEM111/FEM111 progeny. As shown in Table 1, transmission of the fem111 mutation was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild-type allele (P < 0.001). In addition, siliques resulting from this cross exhibited reduced seed set (47% aborted ovules; n = 300) (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). These observations indicate that fem111 affects the female gametophyte. Segregation of the fem111 Mutation To determine whether the fem111 mutation also affects the male gametophyte, we crossed fem111/FEM111 males with wild-type females and scored the number of fem111/FEM111 and FEM111/FEM111 progeny. As shown in Table 1, transmission of the fem111 mutation through the male gametophyte was not significantly different from that of the wild-type allele (P > 0.5), indicating that the male gametophyte is not affected. As shown in Table 1, the penetrance of the fem111 mutation is 100% in the female gametophyte. As a consequence, we were not able to isolate homozygous mutants and, thus, were not able to evaluate whether this mutation affects the sporophyte generation. To determine whether fem111 affects megagametogenesis, we analyzed female gametophytes at the terminal developmental stage (stage FG7) using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) (CITATION). We emasculated flowers at stage 12c (CITATION), waited 24 h, and fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis. Wild-type female gametophytes at this stage have one egg cell, one central cell, and two synergid cells (Figures 1A and 1B); the three antipodal cells undergo cell death during the transition from stage FG6 to FG7 (CITATION). The nucleus and nucleolus of the central cell are larger than those of the other cells as a result of fusion of the two polar nuclei during central cell development (Figures 1A and 1B). In fem111 female gametophytes, all four cells were present (the antipodal cells degenerated normally), and the egg cell and synergid cells appeared indistinguishable from those of the wild type (Figures 1D and 1E). By contrast, the central cell in fem111 female gametophytes exhibited two defects: the nucleolus and vacuole both were smaller than those of the wild type (Figures 1D and 1E). We analyzed female gametophytes at earlier developmental stages to determine why the nucleolus and vacuole are small in fem111 central cells. We first analyzed these structures in the wild type. The central cell is first formed during stage FG5. During this stage, the central cell contains the two polar nuclei that fuse to form a single nucleus (secondary nucleus) and a large vacuole that occupies most of the volume of this cell. The central cell's nucleolus is relatively small just after fusion (stage FG6) and enlarges as the female gametophyte matures (stages FG6 and FG7), until it reaches a diameter of ∼6 μm at the terminal developmental stage (stage FG7) (Figure 2 ). During these stages, the vacuole continues to occupy most of the volume of the central cell (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To analyze the maturation of the central cell's nucleolus and vacuole in fem111, we used CLSM to observe the female gametophytes within fem111/FEM111 pistils from flower stage 12c, which contain female gametophytes at stages FG4 to FG6 (CITATION). Female gametophytes at stages FG4 and FG5 exhibited no phenotypic variation (n = 113 female gametophytes), indicating that migration and fusion of the polar nuclei occur normally in fem111 female gametophytes. By contrast, two distinct populations of female gametophytes were observed at stage FG6. One population (54%) was indistinguishable from the wild type in all features, including the sizes of the central cell's vacuole and nucleolus (Figure 2). In the second population (46%), the central cell's vacuole and nucleolus had reduced size (Figure 2). Together, these data indicate that the phenotype conferred by fem111 first becomes apparent soon after fusion of the polar nuclei and includes defects in nuclear maturation and the maintenance of vacuole size. In the wild type, the central cell becomes fertilized and gives rise to the seed's endosperm. To determine whether the central cell of fem111 female gametophytes is competent to give rise to endosperm, we emasculated fem111/FEM111 flowers at stage 12c (CITATION), waited 24 h, pollinated with wild-type pollen, waited 18 h, and fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis. In the wild type at 18 h after pollination, one of the synergid cells is degenerated and both the egg cell and the central cell have become fertilized. At this time point, the embryo is a single-celled zygote and the endosperm consists of four to eight nuclei (Figure 1C). As with the wild type, fem111 female gametophytes at 18 h after pollination contained a degenerated synergid cell and a single-celled zygote (Figure 1F). In the wild type, egg cells and zygotes are distinguished by several structural features (see the legends of Figures 1B and 1C) (CITATION). fem111 zygotes exhibited all of these structural features, strongly suggesting that fem111 egg cells become fertilized (Figure 1F). In contrast with the wild type, endosperm nuclei were not present (Figure 1F). Instead, the central cell cavity was filled with highly fluorescent material. Within the fluorescent material, the secondary nucleus and the nucleolus could sometimes be observed but were difficult to distinguish from the surrounding cytoplasm (Figure 1F). The absence of endosperm at 18 h after pollination could be attributable to either a failure to form endosperm or a delay in endosperm development. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed fem111 seeds at 40 h after pollination. In wild-type seeds at this time point, endosperm consists of >50 nuclei and the embryo is at the globular stage (Figure 1H). By contrast, in fem111/FEM111 siliques, 45% of seeds at this time point did not contain endosperm nuclei (n = 100 seeds). Of those seeds lacking endosperm, 76% had a zygote-like structure (Figure 1I); in the remaining 24%, it could not be determined whether a zygote-like structure was present because the embryo sacs were collapsed. This result suggests that the failure to form endosperm is not the result of a delay in endosperm development. The data presented above suggest that the structural changes associated with the central cell are induced by pollination. To explore this possibility further, we emasculated stage 12c flowers, waited 42 h (corresponds to 18 h after manual pollination), and fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis. The autofluorescence associated with the central cell in fertilized fem111 ovules was not observed in fem111 female gametophytes of unpollinated pistils at this time point (Figure 1G), indicating that these structural changes require pollination. Together, these observations indicate that the central cell in fem111 female gametophytes is not competent to give rise to endosperm, even when fertilized with wild-type pollen. The fem111 mutant was identified in a screen of T-DNA–mutagenized lines. To identify the affected gene, we used thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (CITATION) to determine the T-DNA insertion site in the fem111 mutant. The T-DNA in fem111 is inserted into gene At5g48670. To determine whether the female gametophyte defect is attributable to disruption of At5g48670, we introduced a wild-type copy of this gene into the fem111 mutant. We generated plants homozygous for both the fem111 allele and the rescue construct; these plants had full seed set, indicating that disruption of At5g48670 is responsible for the female gametophyte defect in fem111 mutants. This gene corresponds to AGL80, which encodes a type I MADS domain protein (CITATION) that likely functions as a transcription factor. To determine the structure of the AGL80 gene, we isolated a cDNA clone and compared its sequence with that of the genomic sequence. We also performed 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to characterize the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of this gene. As shown in Figure 3A , FEM111/AGL80 comprises a single exon that contains a 966-nucleotide open reading frame. As shown in Figure 3B, FEM111/AGL80 is predicted to encode a protein of 321 amino acids that contains a MADS domain near the N terminus of the protein and a His-rich region near the C terminus of the protein. [[FIGURE]] The T-DNA is inserted immediately after the second nucleotide in the predicted open reading frame and is associated with a 6-bp deletion in the coding sequence. This observation suggests that fem111 is a null allele. However, we were not able to confirm this prediction because we were unable to obtain a homozygous line (Table 1), which precluded the analysis of FEM111/AGL80 expression in fem111 mutants. To characterize the expression of FEM111/AGL80 during female gametophyte development, we analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing a protein fusion construct in which the FEM111/AGL80 promoter and the entire FEM111/AGL80 coding sequence were fused to green fluorescent protein (AGL80-GFP). This construct was sufficient to rescue the mutant phenotype in the fem111 background, suggesting that expression of this construct mimics that of the endogenous gene. As shown in Figure 4B , at the terminal developmental stage (stage FG7), AGL80-GFP expression was detected exclusively in the central cell. Figure 4B also shows that the AGL80-GFP fusion protein was localized to the nucleus, consistent with its predicted function as a transcriptional regulator. To determine whether FEM111/AGL80 is expressed at earlier developmental stages, we analyzed expression in flowers at stage 12c, which contain both uncellularized (stages FG4 and early FG5) and cellularized (late stage FG5 and stage FG6) female gametophytes (CITATION). Within flowers at this stage, we detected AGL80-GFP expression in the polar nuclei before fusion (late stage FG5) (Figure 4A). In all cases in which expression in the polar nuclei was detected, the two nuclei were immediately adjacent to one another. Expression was never observed in polar nuclei that were separated. Together, these data indicate that FEM111/AGL80 is expressed specifically in the central cell and that its expression is first detected in female gametophytes soon after cellularization and before the polar nuclei fuse (late stage FG5). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether FEM111/AGL80 is also expressed in developing seeds, we analyzed AGL80-GFP expression at 8 to 72 h after pollination. During this period, AGL80-GFP expression was detected exclusively in the endosperm (Figure 4C). During endosperm development, AGL80-GFP expression was strongest in young seeds and diminished gradually at progressively older stages; expression was not detected in seeds older than 3 d after pollination. In reciprocal crosses with plants homozygous for the AGL80-GFP construct and the wild type, expression was detected only when the reporter construct was present in the female parent. To analyze FEM111/AGL80 expression elsewhere in the plant, we performed real-time RT-PCR with RNA from various organs. Consistent with the expression of AGL80-GFP in the female gametophyte and endosperm, we detected FEM111/AGL80 expression in ovaries and young siliques (Figure 5 ). In addition, expression was detected in roots, leaves, stems, young flowers, and anthers (Figure 5). Our results are consistent with previous studies showing expression of AGL80 in leaves, stems, siliques, and anthers (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] The data presented above suggest that FEM111/AGL80 functions as a transcription factor within the central cell and controls the expression of downstream genes required for central cell development and function. To test this further, we analyzed the expression of the DME, FIS2, and DD46 central cell–expressed genes in fem111 mutants. We analyzed the expression of DME–β-glucuronidase (GUS), FIS2-GFP, and ProDD46:GFP in fem111/FEM111 and wild-type plants. In wild-type female gametophytes, DME-GUS (CITATION) and FIS2-GFP are expressed in the central cell (Figures 6A and 6B ). As shown in Figure 6E, the number of female gametophytes expressing DME-GUS in fem111/FEM111 plants was ∼50% that in wild-type plants. By contrast, the number of female gametophytes expressing FIS2-GFP was approximately equal in fem111/FEM111 and wild-type plants (Figure 6E). [[FIGURE]] In wild-type female gametophytes, ProDD46:GFP (DD46 corresponds to gene At1g22015) is expressed in both the central cell and the synergid cells (Figure 6C) (J.G. Steffen, J. Macfarlane, and G.N. Drews, unpublished data). By contrast, in fem111/FEM111 plants, the reporter was expressed in the synergid cells but not in the central cell (Figure 6D) in approximately half of the ovules (Figure 6E). Together, these data indicate that FEM111/AGL80 is required for the expression of DME and DD46 but not FIS2 during central cell development.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sterilized in chlorine gas and germinated on plates containing 0.5× Murashige and Skoog salts (Sigma-Aldrich M-9274), 0.05% MES, 0.5% sucrose, and 0.8% Phytagar (Life Technologies). Ten-day-old seedlings were transferred to Scott's Redi-Earth and grown under 24-h illumination. T-DNA constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by electroporation. Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia) were transformed using a modified floral dip procedure (CITATION). Transformed progeny were selected by germinating surface-sterilized T1 seeds on growth medium containing antibiotics. Resistant seedlings were transplanted to soil after 10 d of growth. For reciprocal cross analysis, fem111/FEM111 plants were crossed with wild-type plants as outlined in Table 1. F1 seeds were germinated on growth medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and the number of resistant and sensitive plants was scored. Resistant and sensitive plants were scored as genotypes fem111/FEM111 and FEM111/FEM111, respectively. Statistical analyses of these data were performed using the χ2 test. For self-cross analysis, fem111/FEM111 plants were allowed to self-pollinate, progeny seeds were collected, and the number of resistant and sensitive progeny was scored. Resistant progeny from the self-cross could be either heterozygous or homozygous for the fem111 T-DNA insertion. To distinguish between these possibilities, resistant plants were grown and seed set was scored; all resistant plants exhibited ∼50% seed set, indicating that they were heterozygous. Statistical analyses of these data were performed using the χ2 test. CLSM of ovules and seeds was performed as described previously (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION), with the modification that we used a Zeiss LSM510 microscope. Measurements of nucleoli diameter were obtained using the Zeiss LSM software package. Tissue from plants containing GFP constructs was analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. GFP was excited with an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was detected between 500 and 530 nm. For analysis of the terminal developmental stage, we emasculated flowers at stage 12c, waited 24 h, removed the flowers from the plants, removed the sepals, petals, and stamens, and dissected off the carpel walls using a 30-gauge syringe needle. The pistils were then mounted on a slide in 1× Murashige and Skoog salts, pH 7.0, for CLSM analysis. For analysis of different developmental stages, we used flowers of the appropriate stage (CITATION) and processed them as described above. The fem111 mutant was isolated in a screen of T-DNA–mutagenized lines generated with the pCGN1547 vector (CITATION). We used thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (CITATION) to identify the sequences flanking the T-DNA. We used primers oligo-L1 (5′-CTCAATGCAAAAGGGGAACG-3′) and FEM111CL1 (5′-AGCTACCGCAACAGAAGAAGAT-3′) to characterize the T-DNA insertion of the left border and primers RBMP2 (5′-GCGTTACCCAACTTAATCGC-3′) and FEM111CR1 (5′-ATCTTATAATACCAAATCCTACT-3′) to characterize the T-DNA insertion of the right border. The PCR products from these reactions were then sequenced to determine the nature of the insertion site. The T-DNA right border inserts between the first and second nucleotides of the open reading frame and faces the 5′ region of the gene. The T-DNA left border inserts after the seventh nucleotide of the open reading frame and faces the 3′ region of the gene. Molecular complementation was performed using a 2600-bp DNA fragment containing the FEM111/AGL80 genomic coding sequence (966 bp) along with 1332 bp of sequence upstream of the translational start codon and 366 bp of sequence downstream of the stop codon. This DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the primers FEM111-R2 (5′-AAGACGGATTTGGAGTG-3′) and FEM111F2 (5′-CAGCGTTGAGTATGACA-3′) and cloned into the TOPO II PCR cloning vector (Invitrogen) to generate clone FEM111-2.6/TOPO. The insert was released from clone FEM111-2.6/TOPO with BamHI and XhoI, and the fragment was subcloned into pCAMBIA1300 at BamHI and SalI, producing clone FEM111-2.6/pCAMBIA. FEM111-2.6/pCAMBIA was introduced into Arabidopsis plants heterozygous for the fem111 mutation as described above. The pCAMBIA1300 T-DNA contains a marker gene conferring resistance to hygromycin, and the pCGN1547 T-DNA contains a marker gene conferring resistance to kanamycin. Transformed plants were selected by germinating T1 seeds on growth medium containing 15 μg/mL hygromycin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin to select for plants containing both the rescue transgene and the fem111 mutation. The presence of the fem111 mutation was verified by PCR with primers oligo-L1 and FEM111CL1. Plants heterozygous for the fem111 allele and hemizygous for the rescue construct at a single locus were allowed to self-cross. The progeny seeds were germinated on growth medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and the number of resistant and sensitive plants was scored. We observed 77 kanamycin-resistant progeny and 43 kanamycin-sensitive progeny. Plants homozygous for the fem111 allele and homozygous for the rescue construct were identified by having progeny seeds that were 100% kanamycin-resistant and 100% hygromycin-resistant. These plants had seed set indistinguishable from the wild type. To amplify a cDNA encompassing the entire open reading frame of FEM111/AGL80, we performed RT-PCR on RNA extracted from pistils harvested from flowers at stage 13 (CITATION). RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (www.qiagen.com). Aliquots of RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed using the RETROscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with primers FEM111-cDNA-F (5′-CAATGACAAGAAAGAAAGTG-3′) and FEM111-cDNA-R (5′-ACCTAATGGAACCATGTTT-3′). The cDNA was cloned into the TOPO II PCR vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid pCRII-FEM111. We identified the 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences with RACE using the First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). For 5′ RACE, the gene-specific outer primer was 5′RACE-Outer#2 (5′-AAGAGCGAGAGTTCGTGTACCTTC-3′) and the gene-specific inner primer was 5′RACE-Inner#2 (5′-AAGAATCGTTGGAAATGTAAGCAAG-3′). For 3′ RACE, the gene-specific outer primer was AGLSEQp4 (5′-AGCGACAGAAACTTTGAGGAGA-3′) and the gene-specific inner primer was AGLSEQp6 (5′-TCGCAGGATTGAGATTTTAC-3′). This analysis showed that FEM111/AGL80 contains 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of 51 and 109 bp, respectively. We used pfam 17.0 (http://pfam.wustl.edu/hmmsearch.shtml) to identify the MADS domain. We used psort (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/form.html) to identify the putative nuclear localization signal. We identified the His-rich motif at the C terminus of the protein using prosite (http://ca.expasy.org/prosite/). The AGL80-GFP fusion construct has GFP inserted 33 bp upstream of the stop codon of the FEM111/AGL80 gene. As a first step in cloning this gene, we generated three PCR products. An upstream fragment was amplified using primers FEM111GFPF1 (5′-CTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATAGTAACAGGGATGATGCT-3′; contains 18 bp of sequence found in GFP) and FEM111GFPR1 (5′-ATTTAAATCAGAACTATAATC-3′; includes a native SwaI site). A downstream fragment was amplified using primers FEM111GFPF2 (5′-CCTCGAGCAGCGTTGAGTATGACAAAG-3′; contains an XhoI site) and FEM111GFPR2 (5′-ATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGAGTTCAAGTATTACCAAT-3′; contains 18 bp of sequence found in GFP). The GFP insert was amplified from pBI-GFP(S65T) (CITATION) using primers GFPfuseF1 (5′-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′) and GFPfuseR1 (5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′). The GFP fragment contained the entire GFP open reading frame, excluding the stop codon. The three PCR fragments were gel-purified using QIAquick spin columns and then used as the template for a PCR using primers FEM111GFPF2 and FEM111GFPR1, which resulted in a 1.2-kb fusion product containing GFP and FEM111 sequence. This product was TOPO-cloned and sequenced to verify that no PCR errors existed. The TOPO clone was then cut with SwaI and XhoI and inserted into FEM111-2.6/TOPO at XhoI/SwaI to create FEM111-GFP/TOPO. Finally, FEM111-GFP/TOPO was cut with BamHI and XhoI and was subcloned into pCAMBIA1300 at BamHI/SalI to create FEM111-GFP/pCAMBIA. This construct was introduced into Arabidopsis plants as described above, and transformed plants were selected by germinating seeds on growth medium containing 50 μg/mL hygromycin. The expression patterns reported in Results are derived from the analysis of 10 single-insert AGL80-GFP lines. Plants homozygous for both the AGL80-GFP construct and the fem111 T-DNA insert (as determined by kanamycin and hygromycin selection of progeny) had 100% seed set. Tissue was harvested from plants and placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. Ovaries were harvested from the oldest stage 12 flower (CITATION) on each plant as well as the next two older flowers from plants harboring the male sterile1 mutation (CITATION; CITATION) to prevent self-pollination. Floral cluster tissue includes the inflorescence meristem and flowers at stages 1 to 10 (CITATION). Silique tissue includes siliques at 1 to 2 d after pollination. Leaf tissue includes leaves of 5 to 12 mm. Roots were harvested from seedlings at 11 d after germination. Floral stem tissue includes internodes from 4-week-old plants. RNA was extracted from these tissues using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (www.qiagen.com). DNA contamination was removed from samples using the Ambion TURBO DNA-free DNase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNase treatment, RNA samples were repurified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed using the RETROscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For real-time RT-PCR, PCR was performed using the Roche FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I master mix (www.roche.com) in a volume of 10 μL on a Roche LightCycler system. The PCR mixture consisted of 0.5 μL of cDNA, 0.5 μM primers, and 1× master mix. In every real-time RT-PCR run, ACTIN2 was used as an internal control to normalize for variation in the amount of cDNA template. The PCR primers used were MP1-1F (5′-GACTCTTTGTGGCATCACTGC-3′) and MP1-1R (5′-CCTCAAAGTTTCTGTCGCTTTC-3′). The PCR program consisted of a first step of denaturation and Taq activation (95°C for 5 min) followed by 45 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 15 s), annealing (60°C for 15 s), and extension (72°C for 10 s). To determine the specificity of the PCR, the amplified products were subjected to melt curve analysis using the machine's standard method. The reported values are averages of four independent trials (two biological replicates and two technical replicates). We calculated relative expression levels as follows. We first normalized AGL80 transcript levels relative to a standard (ACTIN2) using the formula ΔCT = CT(AGL80) − CT(ACTIN2). We next calculated an average ΔCT value for each tissue. Anther, the tissue with the highest relative expression (lowest ΔCT value), was used as the standard for the comparison of expression levels. We then calculated relative expression levels using the equation 100 × 2−[average ΔCT (tissue) − average ΔCT (anther)]. The DME-GUS construct contains 2.3 kb of promoter and 1.9 kb of the DME gene (including a nuclear localization signal) fused to GUS (CITATION). The FIS2-GFP construct contains 2.5 kb of promoter and the entire genomic coding region fused to GFP. The ProDD46:GFP reporter construct contains 1 kb of 5′ flanking sequence of the gene At1g22015 fused to GFP in the vector pBI-GFP(S65T). To analyze promoter:reporter constructs in the fem111 mutant background, we crossed fem111/FEM111 plants as males with plants homozygous for the reporter construct. To identify F1 plants containing the fem111 T-DNA allele, PCR was performed with the primers RBMP2 (5′-GCGTTACCCAACTTAATCGC-3′) and FEMCR1 (5′-ATCTTATAATACCAAATCCTACT-3′). Plants heterozygous for the fem111 T-DNA insertion and hemizygous for the reporter construct were allowed to self-cross. Progeny from the self-cross were then scored for the fem111 T-DNA insertion by PCR, as described above. One-quarter of these plants should also be homozygous for the reporter construct. To identify these plants, we made use of the fact that all reporter constructs were inserted into vectors conferring kanamycin resistance. Offspring containing the fem111 T-DNA allele were then allowed to self-cross. Seeds from this cross were plated on medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and the ratio of kanamycin-sensitive to kanamycin-resistant seedlings was scored. Plants that produced 100% kanamycin-resistant progeny were determined to be homozygous for the promoter:reporter construct. Analysis of reporter expression was performed at stage FG7. Flowers were emasculated at stage 12c (CITATION), and pistils were collected at 24 h after emasculation. Pistils from plants containing DME-GUS were stained for GUS activity in a solution containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2.5 mM potassium ferricyanide, and 1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronic acid. Tissue was placed into this solution on ice, vacuum-infiltrated for 15 min, and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The ovules were then analyzed on a Zeiss Axioplan upright microscope with ×20 and ×40 objectives. Analysis of the GFP lines was performed as described above. The GenBank accession number for the AGL80 nucleotide sequence is DQ406752. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative number for the protein sequence of AGL80 is At5g48670.1. The following material is available in the online version of this article. Supplemental Figure 1. Silique Phenotype of fem111 Mutants.
