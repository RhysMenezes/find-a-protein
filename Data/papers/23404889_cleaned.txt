!~ABS~! The basic Leucine zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) is a key regulator of abscisic acid (ABA)–mediated seed germination and postgermination seedling growth. While a family of SUCROSE NONFERMENTING1-related protein kinase2s (SnRK2s) is responsible for ABA-induced phosphorylation and stabilization of ABI5, the phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylating ABI5 is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in FyPP1 (for Phytochrome-associated serine/threonine protein phosphatase1) and FyPP3, two homologous genes encoding the catalytic subunits of Ser/Thr PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE6 (PP6), cause an ABA hypersensitive phenotype in Arabidopsis thaliana, including ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth. Conversely, overexpression of FyPP causes reduced sensitivity to ABA. The ABA hypersensitive phenotype of FyPP loss-of-function mutants is ABI5 dependent, and the amount of phosphorylated and total ABI5 proteins inversely correlates with the levels of FyPP proteins. Moreover, FyPP proteins physically interact with ABI5 in vitro and in vivo, and the strength of the interaction depends on the ABI5 phosphorylation status. In vitro phosphorylation assays show that FyPP proteins directly dephosphorylate ABI5. Furthermore, genetic and biochemical assays show that FyPP proteins act antagonistically with SnRK2 kinases to regulate ABI5 phosphorylation and ABA responses. Thus, Arabidopsis PP6 phosphatase regulates ABA signaling through dephosphorylation and destabilization of ABI5.
!~RES~! FyPP1 and FyPP3, the catalytic subunits of Arabidopsis PP6 phosphatases (PP6c) in Arabidopsis, share high sequence homology (99% amino acid identity) (CITATION). Publically available data (http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi; CITATION) show that FyPP1 and FyPP3 expression is upregulated by imbibition during seed germination, which is opposite to that of ABI5 (see Supplemental Figure 1 online), suggesting the involvement of FyPP1 and FyPP3 in regulating seed germination. To test this, we first investigated the germination of Columbia (Col; the wild type), fypp1 (f1), and fypp3 (f3) seeds and seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants (f1 is heterozygous and f3 is homozygous) on germination medium (GM) plates containing various concentrations of ABA. We used seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants in these experiments because the f1 f3 homozygous double mutant plants are completely infertile (CITATION). The results showed that both f1 and f3 single homozygous mutants had similar germination and greening percentages as Col at the tested ABA concentrations, while the seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants had much lower germination and greening percentages than Col at the tested ABA concentrations (Figures 1A to 1C; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Genotyping analysis revealed that among the progeny of self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants incubated on 2.5 μM ABA plates, all geminated seeds were of the f3 genotype (n = 20 genotyped, 100%), while the nongermination seeds (n = 95 genotyped) consisted of three genotypes: f3 (12.6%), f1−/+ f3 (58%), and f1 f3 (29.4%). These observations indicate that seeds of the f1−/+ f3 and f1 f3 genotypes were hypersensitive to ABA. [[FIGURE]] We next investigated the root growth of f1 f3 single mutants and f1 f3 double mutants on GM plates containing 0 or 1 µM ABA. The f1 f3 double mutants have shorter roots and smaller/fused cotyledons than Col at the early seedling stage (CITATION; see Supplemental Figure 3 online), and we therefore chose f1 f3 seedlings for our stress experiment based on these phenotypes. We observed that the relative root growth of the f1 f3 mutants was much reduced compared with that of Col, whereas there were no obvious differences in the relative root growth of f1 or f3 single mutants and Col (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). Again, this observation indicates that the f1 f3 double mutants, but not the f1 or f3 single mutants, are hypersensitive to ABA. To confirm our observations, we investigated the ABA responses of ethanol-inducible F3Ri/f1 lines, which were generated by introducing the AlcA-AlcR:FyPP3RNAi expression cassette into the fypp1 (f1) single mutant background (CITATION). We chose two F3Ri/f1 lines (F3Ri/f1-3 and F3Ri/f1-21) for our experiments. The results showed that after ethanol induction, the seed germination and greening percentages of both F3Ri/f1 lines were reduced compared with Col at the tested ABA concentrations, with F3Ri/f1-3 showing a more severe phenotype than F3Ri/f1-21 (Figures 1D and 1E). Interestingly, there was no greening of F3Ri/f1-3 seeds after 5 d on GM plates containing ethanol but not ABA (Figure 1E). RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of FyPP3 was undetectable in F3Ri/f1-3 and dramatically reduced in F3Ri/f1-21, while ethanol itself had no effect on FyPP3 expression (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), indicating that the ABA hypersensitive phenotype of the F3Ri/f1 transgenic plants after ethanol induction is specifically due to the reduced expression of the FyPP3 gene. We also observed that the relative root growth of F3Ri/f1-21 on GM plates with ABA was much slower than that of Col after ethanol induction (see Supplemental Figure 4B online), further confirming that the F3Ri/f1 plants are hypersensitive to ABA. To further investigate the function of FyPP1 and FyPP3 in ABA signaling, we investigated the seed germination and greening percentages of FyPP overexpressing (F1OE and F3OE) and FyPP dominant-negative (F1DN and F3DN) transgenic lines (CITATION). The results showed that the F1DN and F3DN seeds had much lower germination percentages after 1, 2.5, or 5 µM ABA treatment compared with Col seeds, while the F1OE and F3OE seeds had significantly higher germination percentages with 2.5 µM ABA treatment compared with Col seeds (Figure 1F). Additionally, the greening percentages of F1DN and F3DN seedlings were much lower, while the greening percentages of F1OE and F3OE seedlings were much higher than that of Col when treated with 1 µM ABA (Figure 1G). Thus, F1DN and F3DN transgenic lines showed a similar seed germination phenotype as the seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants and the F3Ri/f1 transgenic lines, while the F1OE and F3OE transgenic plants displayed the opposite seed germination phenotype as seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants and F3Ri/f1 transgenic lines. Taken together, these observations suggest that Arabidopsis FyPP1 and FyPP3 play critical roles in ABA signaling and negatively regulate ABA responses. Since ABI5 is known as a key regulator of seed germination, we next tested the genetic interactions between FyPPs and ABI5. We introduced the f1 and f3 mutations into the abi5-1 mutant background (CITATION). We generated plants that were homozygous for f3 and abi5 but heterozygous for f1 (here referred to as f1−/+ f3 abi5-1) and obtained seeds from these self-pollinated plants in our germination assays. We observed that the seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 abi5-1 plants, self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants, and abi5-1 mutants, as well as the Col controls, all germinated and grew well on GM plates lacking ABA (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figure 6A online). Seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants were hypersensitive to 0.5 µM ABA as expected, whereas seeds from selfed f1−/+ f3 abi5-1 plants were insensitive to 0.5 µM ABA, similar to abi5-1 (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figures 6B and 6C online). [[FIGURE]] We next introduced the f1 and f3 mutations into transgenic plants overexpressing ABI5 (ABI5OE hereafter; CITATION). Similarly, we generated plants homozygous for f3 and ABI5OE but heterozygous for f1 (here referred to as f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE) and obtained seeds from these self-pollinated plants in our experiments. Without ABA treatment, seeds from both self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants and ABI5OE plants germinated and grew well (Figure 2B). Interestingly, we observed that 24.8% of seeds (n = 250) from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE plants did not germinate after 5 d on GM plates (Figure 2B), although they eventually germinated after a longer incubation period (more than 7 d). Genotyping showed that these seeds were all f1 f3 ABI5OE homozygotes. After treatment with 0.5 µM ABA, the ABI5OE seedlings underwent growth arrest after 5 d, although their germination percentages were comparable to those of the seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+f3 plants and Col controls at this stage, while the germination percentage of the seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE plants was much lower that of the ABI5OE seeds, and the growth of seedlings segregated from f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE was more severely inhibited compared with the ABI5OE seedlings (Figure 2B). Genotyping analysis showed that after ABA treatment, all of the germinated seeds (n = 15 genotyped) from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE plants were of the f3 ABI5 genotype, while the nongermination seeds (n = 85 genotyped) had three genotypes: f3 ABI5OE (20.5%), f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE (49%), and f1 f3 ABI5OE (30.5%). These observations indicate that the loss of FyPP1 and FyPP3 activity enhanced the sensitivity of ABI5OE seeds to ABA. We also crossed F3OE transgenic lines with ABI5OE plants. As shown in Figure 2C, without ABA treatment, Col, F3OE, ABI5OE, and F3OE ABI5OE double mutants germinated and grew well, while in the presence of 0.5 µM ABA, the growth of the ABI5OE seedlings was more severely inhibited than that of the F3OE ABI5OE double mutants, F3OE seeds, and Col wild-type controls. These results suggest that enhanced FyPP activity can largely overcome the effects of ABI5 overexpression in response to ABA. Taken together, these data suggest that FyPP1 and FyPP3 act through the ABI5 pathway to regulate ABA responses. We next performed a series of experiments to test whether ABI5 could serve as a substrate of FyPP proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays showed that both FyPP1 and FyPP3 specifically interacted with ABI5, but not with other key regulators of ABA signaling, including the ABA receptors (Pyr and Pyl1), the PP2C phosphatases (ABI1 and ABI2), the SnRK2 kinase (SnRK2.6/OST1), and the downstream transcription factors ABI3 and ABI4 (see Supplemental Figures 7 and 8 online). Domain deletion analysis showed that the N-terminal region of FyPP1 protein mediated the interaction between FyPP1 and ABI5 in yeast cells (Figures 3A and 3B; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). Moreover, luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assays (CITATION) showed that both cLUC-FyPP1 and cLUC-FyPP3 interacted with nLUC fusions of ABI5 and group I ABI5-like proteins (more similar to ABI5 protein, such as AREB3 and EEL), but not nLUC fusions of group II ABI5-like proteins (less similar to ABI5 protein, such as ABF2) (Figure 3C; see Supplemental Figure 9 online). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays showed that Myc-ABI5 coimmunoprecipitated with FyPP1-HA and FyPP3-3HA, but not with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-HA in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves (Figure 3D), further confirming the interaction between FyPPs and ABI5 in vivo. [[FIGURE]] To identify the subcellular localization of the interaction between FyPPs and ABI5, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. We observed strong yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) signals in the nuclei of onion cells bombarded with ABI5-YFPN (YFP N-terminal region) and FyPP3-YFPC (YFP C-terminal region) plasmids, but no YFP signal was detected in onion cells bombarded with the YFPN and YFPC control plasmids (Figure 3E). In Arabidopsis plants, the FyPP1 and FyPP3 proteins were detected in the nucleus, the plasma membranes, and the cytosol (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). These observations indicate that the interaction between ABI5 and FyPP3 occurs in the nucleus in planta. Taken together, these data indicate that there is a direct interaction between FyPPs and ABI5. Since FyPP1 and FyPP3 directly interacted with ABI5, we next tested whether FyPP1 and FyPP3 could directly dephosphorylate ABI5. A previous study reported that the Ser119-Gln190 ABI5 fragment (ABI5b) is phosphorylated by the SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6 kinases (CITATION). We therefore performed in vitro phosphorylation experiments using glutathione S-transferase (GST)–tagged ABI5b purified from Escherichia coli cells as the substrate and protein extracts prepared from Col, f1 f3, F1DN, F3DN, F1OE, and F3OE seedlings treated with ABA or with control solvent as the kinase sources. Equal amounts of protein extracts and substrates were coincubated in these assays. No phosphorylated GST-ABI5b was detected in any sample without ABA treatment (Figure 4A), indicating that phosphorylation of ABI5 is ABA dependent, which is consistent with previous reports (CITATION; CITATION). However, after ABA treatment, the amounts of phosphorylated GST-ABI5b were higher in samples incubated with protein extracts from f1 f3, F1DN, and F3DN transgenic seedlings, while the amounts of phosphorylated GST-ABI5b were slightly lower in samples incubated with protein extracts from F1OE and F3OE seedlings, compared with Col (Figure 4A). These data suggested that there is a correlation between FyPP1/3 activity and phosphorylation of GST-ABI5b. [[FIGURE]] To confirm this observation, we performed in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation assays. We incubated equal amounts of GST-ABI5b proteins and protein extracts from ABA-treated Col or f1 f3 seedlings. We added various amounts of purified wild-type PP6 phosphatase (GST-FyPP3) or PP6 null mutant (GST-FyPP3D81N; CITATION) to the samples mixed with protein extracts from f1 f3 seedlings and GST-ABI5b proteins. The results showed that the addition of exogenous GST-FyPP3, but not GST-FyPP3D81N, reduced the amounts of phosphorylated GST-ABI5b, and the more GST-FyPP3 protein added, the less phosphorylated GST-ABI5b detected (Figure 4B). Additionally, when we used mutant GST-ABI5b (ABI5bS145A or ABI5bm) as the substrate, we did not observe a phosphorylation band by the f1 f3 mutant extracts (Figure 4B). These data together suggest that FyPP1/3 proteins play a critical role in regulating the phosphorylation status of ABI5. It was reported that the Ser/Thr sites in the conserved (Leu)xArgxxSer/Thr motif of ABI5 are the targets of SnRK2 kinases, including SnRK2.2, 2.3, and 2.6 (CITATION; CITATION). To test whether these Ser/Thr sites mediate the interaction between ABI5 and FyPPs, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis and substituted these Ser/Thr sites with either Ala or Asp residues, thus generating the dephosphorylation mimic mutant (ABI5A4) or phosphorylation mimic mutant (ABI5D4) forms of ABI5 (Figure 4C). Y2H assays showed a stronger interaction between FyPP1 (F1NT) and ABI5D4 than the interaction between FyPP1 (F1NT) and wild-type ABI5 (Figure 4D; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). This observation suggests that phosphorylation of these Ser/Thr sites in the conserved (Leu)xArgxxSer/Thr motifs plays an important role in mediating the interaction between ABI5 and FyPP. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating protein stability (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We next tested whether FyPP1 and FyPP3 may also be involved in regulating ABI5 protein stability. We germinated Col, F1DN, F3DN, F1OE, and F3OE seeds and seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+f3 plants on GM plates containing 0 or 1 μM ABA. After varying incubation time (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 d) under continuous white light, we extracted their total RNAs and proteins. We used the anti-ABI5–specific antibodies in the immunoblot analysis. CITATION detected 52.5-, 51-, and 50-kD ABI5 bands with the 52.5- and 50-kD bands predominating in immunoblot assays using this α-ABI5 antibody, whereas we detected two bands in this study and in the previous report (Figures 5A and 5B; CITATION). The results showed that in the presence of ABA, ABI5 proteins were hyperaccumulated in the F1DN and F3DN seeds and seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants, but reduced in the F1OE and F3OE seeds, compared with Col (Figure 5A). Consistent with previous reports, ABI5 proteins were quickly degraded in germinated seeds due to diminished ABA levels (Figure 5A; CITATION). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that ABI5 expression was highly induced in all lines in response to ABA compared with the Col controls (see Supplemental Figure 11A online). These results suggest that the differential accumulation of ABI5 proteins in these plants is most likely due to posttranscriptional regulation. Consistent with this, seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants and F1DN and F3DN mutants had lower germination rates after ABA treatment, whereas F1OE and F3OE seeds had higher germination rates, compared with Col (see Supplemental Figures 2 and 12 online). [[FIGURE]] It was reported that ABI5 is highly induced and stabilized by ABA but is degraded rapidly after the removal of ABA (CITATION). To investigate how FyPPs function in this process, we treated Col, f1, F3Ri/f1-21, F1DN, F3DN, F1OE, and F3OE seeds with 5 µM ABA for 3 d and then removed the ABA and grew the seeds on GM plates. We harvested samples after various incubation time points (0, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h) for protein and RNA extraction. Immunoblot analysis showed that after the removal of ABA, ABI5 was more abundant in the FyPP loss-of-function mutants, such as F1DN, F3DN, and F3Ri/f1-21 seeds, after ethanol induction, but this protein was more rapidly degraded in the F1OE and F3OE seeds compared with Col (Figure 5B). Gene expression assays showed that ABI5 mRNA was inhibited to comparable levels in all seeds after removal of ABA (see Supplemental Figures 11B to 11E online). Together, these observations support the notion that FyPPs are essential for posttranscriptional regulation of ABI5 in response to ABA removal. We next investigated the effect of ABA on the expression of ABI5-regulated ABA-responsive genes in the FyPP loss-of-function mutants. Two RD genes, RD29A and RD29B, have ABREs in their promoters and are transactivated by ABI5 (CITATION). CITATION also showed dramatically reduced ABA inducibility of RD29B in abi5 seedlings. Our quantitative RT-PCR assays showed that the expression of both RD29A and RD29B was upregulated in Col, f1 f3, F1DN, and F3DN mutants after ABA treatment, with a hyperinduction of RD29A and RD29B in the FyPP loss-of-function mutants (Figure 5C). These observations suggest that the ABA hypersensitivity of FyPP loss-of-function mutants was due to the hyperaccumulation of ABI5 proteins, resulting in upregulation of downstream ABA-responsive gene expression. 'Because FyPP/PP6 phosphatases and SnRK2 kinases show antagonistic effects on ABA signaling, we were interested in understanding the genetic interactions between SnRK2 and FyPPs. OST1 (SnRK2.6) plays a critical role in mediating various ABA responses, and its loss-of-function mutant (ost1 or snrk2.6) displays a hypersensitive phenotype in response to drought stress and resistance to ABA during seed germination (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Additionally, the single mutants of snrk2.2 and snrk2.3 do not display obvious ABA-related phenotypes, whereas ost1 is more resistant to ABA during seed germination than the wild type (CITATION; CITATION). We therefore introduced the ost1 mutation into f1−/+ f3 and F3DN mutant backgrounds. We generated plants homozygous for f3 and ost1 but heterozygous for f1 (here referred to as f1−/+ f3 ost1) and obtained seeds from these self-pollinated plants for our germination/growth assays. Our results showed that seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants and F3DN mutants were sensitive to ABA as expected, while seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ost1 plants or the F3DN ost1 double mutants were more tolerant to ABA than their f1−/+ f3 or F3DN parental lines, respectively (Figures 6A and 6B). On the other hand, compared with the ost1 mutants, seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ost1 plants and the F3DN ost1 double mutants were still sensitive to ABA (Figures 6A to 6C). Consistent with this observation, the ABI5 protein levels in ABA-treated seeds of self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ost1 plants and F3DN ost1 double mutants were reduced compared with ABA-treated f1−/+ f3 or F3DN parental lines, respectively (Figure 6D). These results suggest that ost1 attenuates the ABA hypersensitivity of seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+f3 and F3DN and that FyPPs function antagonistically with OST1/SnRK2 kinases in mediating ABA signaling. [[FIGURE]] Since FyPP loss-of-function mutants are hypersensitive to ABA, we were interested in understanding how ABA regulates FyPP1 and FyPP3 protein stability. We treated 4-d-old F1OE and F3OE seedlings with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 15 h and then added ABA or the control solvent DMSO. We harvested the samples after different incubation time (0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 24 h) and performed immunoblot assays. The results showed that the YFP-FyPP1 protein levels in F1OE seedlings and the YFP-FyPP3 protein levels in F3OE seedlings decreased after treatment with ABA, but not after the addition of DMSO (Figures 7A to 7D). These observations suggest that ABA promotes degradation of FyPP proteins. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana lines fypp1 (f1), fypp3 (f3), f1−/+ f3, f1 f3, F3Ri/f1, F1OE, F3OE, F1DN, and F3DN lines were described previously (CITATION). The ost1 (or snrk2.6, SALK_008068; CITATION) mutant is in the Col background and was obtained from the SALK Institute. abi5-1 mutants and ABI5OE transgenic lines were reported previously (CITATION; CITATION). The F3Ri/f1 lines were generated by introducing an ethanol-inducible expression cassette AlcA-AlcR:FyPP3RNAi into fypp1 backgrounds as described previously (CITATION). More F3Ri/f1 lines were screened in this study based on the expression of FyPP3 after ethanol induction. Two types of F3Ri/f1 lines were identified by RT-PCR: FyPP3 undetectable (e.g., F3Ri/f1-3) and FyPP3 weakly expressed (e.g., F3Ri/f1-21). F3Ri/f1-3 and F3Ri/f1-21 were then used in this study. Because the f1 f3 double mutants have shorter roots and smaller/fused cotyledons (see Supplemental Figure 3 online; CITATION), we were able to choose f1 f3 plants for ABA treatment. Seeds were sterilized as described (CITATION). Arabidopsis seedlings were grown as previously described (CITATION). Specifically, for the assays shown in Supplemental Figure 4 online, seeds were germinated and grown vertically on GM (CITATION) plates (with 0.1% ethanol for Supplemental Figure 4B online) for 3 d under continuous white light at 22°C in a growth chamber after stratification for 4 d in darkness. The seedlings were transferred onto fresh GM plates (with 0.1% ethanol for Supplemental Figure 4B online) with 0 or 1 μM ABA. The positions of the primary root tips were marked. The seedlings were then grown vertically for four more days in the same growth chamber, and the additional root growth was measured with a ruler. The percentage of relative root elongation was calculated with three replicates based on control plants grown on unsupplemented media. To minimize the effect of harvesting time on seed germination, all seed batches compared in this study were harvested on the same day from plants grown in the same growth chamber with identical environmental conditions. Because f1 f3 homozygous plants are completely sterile (CITATION), seeds from self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants (f1 is heterozygous, and f3 is homozygous), f1−/+ f3 abi5-1 (homozygous for f3 and abi5 but heterozygous for f1), f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE (homozygous for f3 and ABI5OE but heterozygous for f1), and f1−/+ f3 ost1 (homozygous for f3 and ost1 but heterozygous for f1) were used for the seed germination assays (for Figures 1, 2, and 6; see Supplemental Figures 2 and 6 online), immunoblot assays (for Figures 5 and 6), and quantitative RT-PCR assay (for Supplemental Figure 11 online). The progeny produced from these selfed plants were of mixed genotypes, including the following: a mixture of f3, f1−/+ f3, and f1 f3, with a theoretical segregation ratio of 1:2:1 for self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 plants; a mixture of f3 abi5-1, f1−/+ f3 abi5-1, and f1 f3 abi5-1 genotypes, with a theoretical segregation ratio of 1:2:1 for self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 abi5-1 plants; a mixture of f3 ABI5OE, f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE, and f1 f3 ABI5OE genotypes, with a theoretical segregation ratio of 1:2:1 for self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ABI5OE plants; and a mixture of f3 ost1, f1−/+ f3 ost1, and f1 f3 ost1 genotypes, with a theoretical segregation ratio of 1:2:1 for self-pollinated f1−/+ f3 ost1 plants. For Y2H assays, full-length coding sequences (CDSs) of Pyr, Pyl1, ABI1, ABI2, ABI3, ABI4, ABI5, and OST1 were amplified by RT-PCR with primers Pyr-F/R, Pyl1-F/R, ABI1-F/R, ABI2-F/R, ABI3-F/R, ABI4-F/R, ABI5-F1/R1, and OST1-F/R, respectively; with EcoRI or XhoI sites at the end of F or R primers, respectively, for cloning Pyr, ABI2, ABI5, and OST1 fragments; EcoRI or SalI sites at the end of F or R primers, respectively, for cloning Pyl1; MfeI or XhoI sites at the end of F or R primers, respectively, for cloning ABI1; MfeI or SalI sites at the end of F or R primers, respectively, for cloning ABI3 and ABI4. EcoRI- and XhoI-digested Pyr, ABI2, ABI5, and OST1 fragments were then inserted into pEG and pJG vectors digested with the same enzymes to generate pEG-Pyr, pEG-ABI2, pEG-ABI5, pEG-OST1, pJG-Pyr, pJG-ABI2, pJG-ABI5, and pJG-OST1 plasmids. The Pyl1 fragment digested with EcoRI and SalI was inserted into pEG and pJG vectors digested with the same enzymes to generate pEG-Pyl1 and pJG-Pyl1 plasmids, respectively. The ABI1 fragment digested with MfeI and XhoI was inserted into the pEG and pJG vectors digested with the same enzymes to generate pEG-ABI1 and pJG-ABI1 plasmids, respectively. ABI3 and ABI4 fragments digested with MfeI and SalI were inserted into pEG and pJG vectors digested with the same enzymes to generate pEG-ABI3 and pEG-ABI4, and pJG-ABI3 and pJG-ABI4 plasmids, respectively. The ABI5A4 and ABI5D4 mutant genes were generated using the same strategy used to clone FyPP1D81N (CITATION). ABI5A4 and ABI5D4 fragments digested with EcoRI and XhoI were inserted into pEG and pJG vectors digested with the same enzymes to generate pEG-ABI5A4 and pEG-ABI5D4, and pJG-ABI5A4 and pJG-ABI5D4 plasmids, respectively. pEG-FyPP1, pEG-F1NT, pEG-F1CD, pEG-F1CT, pEG-FyPP3, pJG-FyPP1, pJG-F1NT, pJG-F1CD, pJG-F1CT, and pJG-FyPP3 plasmids were generated as described (CITATION). For LCI assays, the full-length CDSs of ABI5, AREB3, EEL, and ABF2 were amplified by PCR with the primer pairs ABI5-F1/R1, AREB3-F/R, EEL-F/R, and ABF2-F/R with KpnI or XhoI sites at the end of F or R primers for ABI5 and KpnI or SalI sites at the end of F or R primers for AREB3, EEL, and ABF2, respectively. ABI5 was digested with KpnI and XhoI and AREB3, EEL, and ABF2 were digested with KpnI and SalI and then inserted into the pCAMBIA1300-cLUC and -nLUC vectors (CITATION) to generate pCAMBIA-ABI5-nLUC, pCAMBIA-AREB3-nLUC, pCAMBIA-EEL-nLUC, pCAMBIA-ABF2-nLUC, pCAMBIA-cLUC-ABI5, pCAMBIA-cLUC-AREB3, pCAMBIA-cLUC-EEL, and pCAMBIA-cLUC-ABF2. pCAMBIA-FyPP1-nLUC, pCAMBIA-FyPP3-nLUC, pCAMBIA-cLUC-FyPP1, and pCAMBIA-cLUC-FyPP3 plasmids were generated as described previously (CITATION). For BiFC assays, the CDS of ABI5 was amplified by PCR with the primer pair ABI5-F3/R3 with SalI and BamHI sites at the end of F and R primers, respectively. ABI5 digested with SalI and BamHI was then cloned into the pY2N vector containing the C-terminal (156 to 239 amino acids) domain of the YFP fluorescent protein (YFPC) to generate the pY2N-ABI5 plasmid. The Y1C-FyPP3 plasmid was generated as described (CITATION). For Co-IP assays, ABI5 was amplified with ABI5-F2/R2 with BamHI and SpeI at the end of F and R primers, respectively. ABI5 digested with BamHI and SpeI was then inserted into the pCAMBIA-Myc vector (from Fang Chen, Yale University) digested with the same enzymes to generate pCAMBIA-Myc-ABI5. pCAMBIA-FyPP1-3HA and pCAMBIA-FyPP3-3HA were generated as described (CITATION). For in vitro protein expression, ABI5b fragment (ABI5 Ser119-Gln190; CITATION) was amplified by PCR with the primer pair ABI5b-F/R, with EcoRI and XhoI sites at the end of F and R primers, respectively. The ABI5bm (ABI5bS145A) mutant fragment was generated using the same strategy used to clone FyPP1D81N (CITATION). ABI5b and ABI5bm digested with EcoRI and XhoI was inserted into the pGEX-4T-1 vector digested with the same enzymes to generate pGEX-ABI5b and PGEX-ABI5bm. pGEX-FyPP3 and pGEX-FyPP3D81N plasmids were generated as described (CITATION). All genes/fragments were confirmed by sequencing. The primers used in PCR cloning are shown in Supplemental Table 1 online. The germination of Arabidopsis seeds was described previously (CITATION). Seed germination was determined based on the appearance of an embryonic axis (i.e., radicle) protrusion, as observed under a microscope. Seedling greening was determined based on the appearance of green cotyledons in a seedling. Y2H assays were conducted as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). The LCI assays were performed as described (CITATION; CITATION). The BiFC assays were described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Various plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260 as previously described (CITATION). Various bacterial strains were coinfiltrated into young tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves as previously described (CITATION) and grown for 3 d. Protein extraction and co-IP were performed as described (CITATION). Immunoprecipitation products were separated by electrophoresis using 10% acrylamide gels, and the target proteins were detected by protein gel blots using α-HA or α-Myc antibodies (Roche) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 5% milk. Plant proteins were isolated with extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 6 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% Nonidet P-40. For Figure 7, 4-d-old F1OE and F3OE seedlings were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 15 h, and then ABA (0.2 mM) or control solvent (DMSO) was added. Samples were then harvested after different incubation times. Yeast proteins were extracted using the Y-PER Yeast Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To determine the protein concentration, various amounts of BSA protein were added to 1× Bradford protein assay buffer (Bio-Rad) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before reading the A600 value. A standard curve of A600 versus concentration of BSA was then generated. The total protein concentrations were determined by extrapolating the A600 values of the sample proteins in 1× Bradford solution against the BSA standard curve. The extracts were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then separated on 10% SDS protein gels. The membrane transfer and immunoblot assays were performed as described previously (CITATION). For Figure 7, α-GFP antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at a dilution of 1:1000, and α-RPN6 (CITATION) antibodies were used at a 1:2000 dilution. For Figure 5, α-ABI5 antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution. α-RPT5 antibodies (CITATION) were used at a 1:1500 dilution. For Supplemental Figure 8 online, α-LexA (Abcam) and α-B42 (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were used at a 1:2000 dilution. GST and recombinant GST-FyPP3, GST-FyPP3D81N, and GST-ABI5b proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified as described previously (CITATION). Six-day-old seedlings were treated with 100 µM ABA or control solvent DMSO for 30 min. Samples were harvested into liquid nitrogen. Total proteins were extracted with 1× kinase/phosphatase buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM Zn2+), plus 1× protease inhibitor and 1 mM PMSF. In vitro kinase assays with plant extracts were performed essentially as described previously (CITATION; CITATION) with a few modifications. For Figures 4A and 4B, 2 µg of GST, GST-ABI5b, or GST-ABI5bm (ABI5b145A) proteins and 25 µg of plant seedling extracts were mixed in 1× kinase/phosphatase buffer, 1× protease inhibitor, 1 mM PMSF, and 1× ATP solution (100 μM ATP and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) in a total volume of 50 μL. Various amounts of exogenous GST-FyPP3 or GST-FyPP3D81N fusion proteins were added to the reactions shown in Figure 4B. The samples were incubated at 30°C for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 5× loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. The products were separated by electrophoresis using 12% acrylamide gels. The gels were stained, dried, and then visualized by exposure to x-ray films. Samples were harvested in liquid nitrogen. Total RNAs were isolated using RNeasy plant mini kits (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA of each sample was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s introductions. RT-PCR was performed as described (CITATION). For real-time PCR, 50 ng of cDNAs was used for each reaction using the SYBR Green kit according to the manufacturer’s introductions in an Applied Biosystems real-time PCR machine. Expression levels were normalized to that of an actin gene. All quantitative PCR experiments were independently performed in triplicate, and representative results were shown. The primers for RT-PCR and quantitative PCR are shown in Supplemental Table 1 online. For Supplemental Figure 10 online, seedlings were grown to 4 d old and the roots were then harvested for confocal observation. GFP fluorescence was observed with a Carl Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.
