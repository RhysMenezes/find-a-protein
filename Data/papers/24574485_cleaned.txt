!~ABS~! RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is essential for de novo DNA methylation in higher plants, and recent reports established novel elements of this silencing pathway in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. INVOLVED IN DE NOVO DNA METHYLATION 2 (IDN2) and the closely related FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION (FDM) are members of a plant-specific family of dsRNA-binding proteins characterized by conserved XH/XS domains and implicated in the regulation of RdDM at chromatin targets. Genetic analyses have suggested redundant as well as non-overlapping activities for different members of the gene family. However, detailed insights into the function of XH/XS-domain proteins are still elusive. By the generation and analysis of higher-order mutant combinations affected in IDN2 and further members of the gene family, we have provided additional evidence for their redundant activity. Distinct roles for members of the XH/XS-domain gene family were indicated by differences in their expression and subcellular localization. Fluorescent protein-tagged FDM genes were expressed either in nuclei or in the cytoplasm, suggestive of activities of XH/XS-domain proteins in association with chromatin as well as outside the nuclear compartment. In addition, we observed altered location of a functional FDM1–VENUS reporter from the nucleus into the cytoplasm under conditions when availability of further FDM proteins was limited. This is suggestive of a mechanism by which redistribution of XH/XS-domain proteins could compensate for the loss of closely related proteins.
!~RES~! For analysis of XH/XS-domain proteins, we first obtained potential loss-of-function mutants for all nine predicted members of the family, characterized by an XH and a closely related XS domain ([CIT0004]). We adopted the nomenclature introduced recently ([CIT0036]et al., 2012a ; [CIT0039]et al., 2012), and characterized T-DNA insertion mutants in FDM1–FDM5 and identified a potentially leaky T-DNA insertion line for IDN2/RDM12 with an insertion in the 5′ untranslated region (Supplementary Fig. S1; [CIT0036]et al., 2012a ). Moreover, we obtained insertion mutants for all three additional loci predicted to encode proteins with an XH and an XS domain but to lack a zf-XS domain. Phylogenetic analyses performed with the entire predicted coding region of these loci highlighted an overall similarity to XH/XS-domain genes (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We therefore termed these loci IDR1–IDR3 (for IDN2 RELATED; Supplementary Fig. S1). RT-PCR analysis of the insertion lines demonstrated defects in expression of full-length mRNAs for all lines except for IDR2, for which no transcript could be detected under our experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1B). With respect to idn2-3, we found defects in expression of its 5′ untranslated region (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Nevertheless, earlier analysis of this IDN2 allele suggested that it has retained some of its functionality ([CIT0036]et al., 2012a ) Taken together, analysis of T-DNA insertion lines suggested identification of loss-of-function mutants for the XH/XS-domain loci, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the idn2-3 and idr2-1 alleles do not represent null alleles but still exhibit some remaining activity. Analysis of idn2/rdm12 mutant lines revealed defects in RdDM that appeared weaker than those of mutants deficient in additional, characterized components of the RdDM pathway ([CIT0003]et al., 2009; [CIT0040]et al., 2010). This led to suggestions of partially redundant activities among XH/XS-domain proteins, corroborated further by analysis of fdm mutant combinations ([CIT0036]et al., 2012a ). However, recent reports indicated only limited functional redundancy within the gene family, substantiated by the finding that IDN2 and at least two of its paralogues form complexes in which they could exhibit discernible functions in the control of RdDM ([CIT0002]et al., 2012; [CIT0037]et al., 2012b ; [CIT0039]et al., 2012). Having identified potential loss-of-function lines for the Arabidopsis XH/XS-domain proteins, we determined their roles in DNA methylation at selected RdDM loci. Moreover, we obtained mutant combinations, which culminated in the generation of the idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 hextuple and the idr1-1 idr2-1 idr3-1 triple mutant. Loss-of-function mutants affected in IDN2 and FDM loci have been described to impact on DNA methylation of RdDM targets, and we therefore tested some of these loci ([CIT0040]et al., 2010). When probing methylation of the 5S rRNA gene by using restriction digests performed with HpaII (for methylation analysis in the CG and CHG context) and with HaeIII (for methylation analysis in the CHH context), a difference to that of the wild type was apparent in idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 DNA, indicative of weakly reduced CHG and CG methylation and a reduction in CHH methylation in the hextuple mutant ([F1]). Single mutants as well as the idr1-1 idr2-1 idr3-1 triple mutant combination exhibited no strong differences to wild-type DNA in comparison ([F1] and Supplementary Fig. S2A). A similar observation was made when analysing the AtMU1 locus in HaeIII-cut DNA samples, with a reduction in DNA methylation in the CHH context apparent specifically for idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 DNA, whereas less pronounced or no differences were observed for the other mutant lines under our experimental conditions ([F1] and Supplementary Fig. S2B). To further test the effects of XH/XS-domain proteins on methylation in the CG and CHG context, we analysed HpaII- and MspI-cut genomic DNA that was probed for MEA-ISR ([CIT0007]). This suggested reduced symmetric DNA methylation most apparent in the idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 hextuple mutant ([F1]). In contrast, we did not observe clear differences when analysing RdDM loci in idr single and idr1-1 idr2-1 idr3-1 triple mutant lines, indicating that these loci are not essential for DNA methylation of analysed targets (Supplementary Fig. S2C).

Standard deviations are indicated (n=4); the asterisk indicates a significant difference in reporter activity between TS-GUS and idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS (t-test, P<0.05). (E) TS-GUS reporter activity in 14-d-old TS-GUS (left) and idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS (right) plantlets. Blue staining indicates release of gene silencing. Apart from well-established RdDM targets, we also analysed expression of the TS-GUS reporter line, containing a transcriptionally silenced GUS transgene that exhibits reactivation in a range of Arabidopsis gene-silencing mutants ([CIT0024]et al., 2000; [CIT0012]et al., 2005). Within this context, limited TS-GUS reactivation has been described for Arabidopsis mutants affected in loci functionally connected to RdDM ([CIT0012]et al., 2005; [CIT0020]et al., 2010), and we asked whether or not XH/XS-domain proteins could be involved in the control of TS-GUS expression as well. idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS exhibited a reproducible, statistically significant increase in TS-GUS activity when compared with TS-GUS controls ([F1], [F1]). However, no prominent alterations in GUS activity were observed in any of the single mutants or in idr1-1 idr2-1 idr3-1. This indicated combinatorial activities of a subset of XH/XS-domain proteins in the regulation of TS-GUS. Taken together, analysis of single mutant lines suggested only a limited impact on DNA methylation at endogenous RdDM target sites and activation of TS-GUS. In the case of IDN2, this might be a consequence of using a leaky allele, which would explain discrepancies between our results and findings made with potentially more severe idn2 alleles ([CIT0003]et al., 2009; [CIT0013]et al., 2012; [CIT0039]et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the more pronounced alterations in DNA methylation that were observed in the idn2/fdm hextuple mutant indicated that these loci exhibit overlapping, redundant activities in the control of DNA methylation. This corroborates findings by [CIT0036]et al. (2012a ), who described additive effects on DNA methylation in fdm mutant combinations. To determine expression of XH/XS-domain genes, we generated cDNAs from different plant tissues and analysed transcript levels by RT-PCR after normalization to UBQ5 ([F2]). These experiments revealed expression of all loci except for IDR2, transcripts of which were not detectable under our conditions. No prominent differences in tissue specificity in gene expression were observed when analysing IDN2/RDM12 and FDM transcript levels in mRNA extracted from seedlings, roots, leaves, or flowers, whereas expression of IDR1 and IDR3 appeared most pronounced in floral organs ([F2]). Expression analysis of XH/XS-domain genes in Arabidopsis. (A) RT-PCR performed with cDNA generated from seedling (sdl.), root, true leaf (leaf), and flower mRNA. UQB5 transcript levels were used for standardization. (B–D) GUS staining of FDM1p::GUS (B), FDM2p::GUS (C), and FDM5p::GUS (D) in roots at 8 days after germination (DAG).

(H–K) GUS staining of FDM1p::GUS (H), FDM2p::GUS (J) and FDM5p::GUS (K) at 15 DAG. (L–N) GUS-stained flowers of FDM1p::GUS (L), FDM2p::GUS (M) and FDM5p::GUS (N) from 28-d-old plants. Bars, 75 μm (B, C); 5mm (E–G); 2.5mm (H–K); 1mm (L–N). To address gene expression in planta, we generated promoter–GUS reporter constructs of selected FDM genes. Specifically, we analysed FDM1, FDM2, and FDM5, which represent a distinct subclade in the phylogenetic tree of the protein family (Supplementary Fig. S1A), in order to determine overlaps and differences in gene expression of these closely related loci. In seedlings, FDM1p::GUS staining was detectable in distal portions of cotyledons, and weaker expression was observed in root tips, a pattern that remained essentially unaltered throughout vegetative development ([F2], [F2], [F2]). Additional FDM1p::GUS activity was observed in flowers, where it appeared to be restricted to the male gametophyte ([F2]). Only weak FDM1p::GUS activity was observed in root meristems, which differed from RT-PCR analyses and root expression of a VENUS-tagged FDM1 translational reporter line ([F2], [F2], and [F3]), suggesting that cis-acting elements required for FDM1 expression in root tissue are not fully active in FDM1p::GUS. FDM2p::GUS and FDM5p::GUS expression was stronger in comparison, exhibiting signals in roots, hypocotyls, and cotyledons of seedlings ([F2], [F2], [F2], [F2]), whereas true leaves showed strong expression only of FDM2p::GUS ([F2]). In flowers, FDM2p::GUS staining produced signals in the vasculature of sepals and petals as well as in anther filaments and parts of the style ([F2]), whereas FDM5p::GUS staining was visible in the anthers, including pollen as well as in the stigma ([F2]). In addition, FDM5p::GUS showed activity in the entire root, both at the seedling stage and in older plants ([F2], [F2]), whereas FDM2::GUS staining was essentially restricted to the root vasculature and emerging lateral roots ([F2]). Subcellular localization of FDM–VENUS reporters (green, yellow) in live Col-0 root meristems (top panels) and in root meristem epidermis cells at higher magnification (bottom panels). (A) FDM1p::FDM1:VENUS. (B) FDM5p::FDM5:VENUS. (C) FDM1p::FDM5:VENUS. (D) FDM5p::FDM1:VENUS. (E) RP40p::FDM1:VENUS. (F) RP40p::FDM5:VENUS. Roots were counterstained with propidium iodide (100 µg ml–1, red) to visualize cell boundaries. Bars, 50 μm (top panels); 10 μm (bottom panels). Taken together, the results obtained from gene expression and reporter analysis indicated distinct gene expression patterns, reflecting tissue specificity in activity of these closely related Arabidopsis XH/XS-domain genes. To determine the subcellular localization of FDM proteins, we generated FDM1:VENUS and FDM5:VENUS expression cassettes, in which the entire FDM-coding regions were fused to the VENUS fluorescent protein ([CIT0026]et al., 2002), and expressed under control of their endogenous promoters. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis revealed that both FDM1p::FDM1:VENUS and FDM5p::FDM5:VENUS expression could be observed in root meristems, but the signals differed in their subcellular localization. When expressed in Col-0, FMD1p::FDM1:VENUS lines accumulated signals in the nucleus, whereas FDM5p::FDM5:VENUS exhibited signals predominantly in the cytoplasm ([F3], [F3]). We then asked whether or not differences in FDM reporter localization could result from differences in expression levels, and fused both FDM–VENUS expression cassettes to the strong ribosomal protein RP40 promoter ([CIT0032]et al., 1997) and analysed expression of the resultant reporter constructs in wild-type Col-0. Ectopic overexpression of both transgenes confirmed the results obtained with endogenous reporters, with RP40p::FDM1:VENUS root meristems exhibiting signals in nuclei, whereas RP40p::FDM5:VENUS signals were most pronounced in the cytoplasm ([F3], [F3]). In additional experiments, we performed promoter swaps and expressed FDM1:VENUS under the control of the FDM5 promoter and vice versa, expressing FDM5:VENUS by the FDM1 promoter. These experiments demonstrated nuclear signals in FDM5p::FDM1:VENUS lines and cytoplasmic signals in FDM1p::FDM5:VENUS lines ([F3], [F3]). Collectively, our analyses indicated that neither variations in expression domains (promoter swaps) nor expression levels (overexpression) significantly affected the distinct subcellular distribution of the FDM1 and FDM5 reporter proteins. This is in agreement with roles for FDM proteins in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Differences in the subcellular distribution of closely related FDM proteins are suggestive of differing functions. We further addressed this issue, and first determined FDM reporter protein functionality in the idn2/fdm mutant background. To this end, we introduced RP40p::FDM1:VENUS and RP40p::FDM5:VENUS into idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 expressing the TS-GUS transgene. TS-GUS activity was increased in idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2, reflecting defects in controlling the silenced state of the transgene ([F1], [F1], and [F4], [F4], [F4]). This was different in idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS RP40p::FDM1:VENUS and idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS RP40p::FDM5:VENUS, which both exhibited reduced TS-GUS activity, a response that appeared more pronounced upon expression of the RP40p::FDM1:VENUS reporter construct ([F4], [F4], [F4]). These findings suggested that both FDM–VENUS reporter proteins are capable of rescuing defects in TS-GUS silencing ([F4], [F4]). Functional analysis of FDM–VENUS reporter proteins. (A–D) TS-GUS staining in 10-d-old TS-GUS (A), idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS (B), idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS RP40p::FDM1:VENUS (C), and idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 TS-GUS RP40p::FDM5:VENUS (D). (E) TS-GUS activity in 14-d-old plantlets as determined by a 4-MUG assay. Activities are plotted as fold induction of activity found in the TS-GUS controls (given a value of 1). Two independent experiments are shown and standard deviation is indicated. Asterisks and brackets highlight significant differences in TS-GUS activity between samples (t-test; P<0.05). Analysis of FDM–VENUS reporters in Col-0 revealed distinct FDM1–VENUS and FDM5–VENUS signals in root meristem cells ([F3]). On the other hand, both reporters rescued defects in TS-GUS expression control in idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 at least to some extent ([F4]), raising questions about the mechanisms involved. To address this issue, we assayed the FDM–VENUS reporter localization in the idn2/fdm mutant background. We first analysed RP40p::FDM1:VENUS and RP40p::FDM5:VENUS expression in the corresponding fdm1-1 and fdm5-2 single mutants. Similar to Col-0, we found FDM1:VENUS signals in the nucleus of fdm1-1 root meristem cells, whereas FDM5:VENUS was visible in the cytoplasm of fdm5-2 root meristem cells ([F5]). Identical results were obtained when analysing FDM1:VENUS distribution in fdm5-2 and FDM5:VENUS distribution in fdm1-1 ([F5]), suggesting that defects in endogenous FDM1 and FDM5 do not influence FDM–VENUS reporter distribution. Subcellular localization of FDM–VENUS reporter proteins (yellow) in fixed root meristem cells of idn2/fdm mutants. (A) RP40p::FDM1:VENUS (left panels) and RP40p::FDM5:VENUS (right panels) in fdm1-1. Note the accumulation of FDM1–VENUS reporter signals in the nucleolar cavity, whilst weak signals only are found in the surrounding dense fibrillar zone. (B) RP40p::FDM1:VENUS (left panels) and RP40p::FDM5:VENUS (right panels) in fdm5-2. (C) RP40p::FDM1:VENUS (left panels) and RP40p::FDM5:VENUS (right panels) in idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2. Seedlings were fixed in formaldehyde (3.7%, v/v) and counterstained with DAPI (0.5ng ml–1, blue) to visualize nuclei. Bars,10 μm. We then expressed RP40p::FDM1:VENUS and RP40p::FDM5:VENUS in the idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 hextuple mutant and determined reporter localization in root meristem cells. Subcellular distribution of FDM5:VENUS remained detectable predominantly in the cytoplasm ([F5]), but alterations were observed for RP40p::FDM1:VENUS. This reporter line exhibited signals in the nuclei and cytoplasm when expressed in idn2-3 fdm1-1 idp2-1 fdm3-2 fdm4-2 fdm5-2 ([F5]). Thus, unlike in Col-0, fdm1-1, or fdm5-2, in which FDM1:VENUS signals are restricted to the nucleus, a combinatorial loss of XH/XS-domain proteins coincided with a visibly altered subcellular localization of FDM1, no longer confined to the nuclear compartment. When taken together, analysis of FDM reporter lines indicated localization in the nucleus and cytoplasm and highlighted flexible subcellular FDM protein distribution under conditions when cytoplasmic FDM protein abundance appeared restricted.
!~MM~! Plants were grown on plant nutrient agar plates [5mM KNO3, 2mM MgSO4, 2mM Ca(NO3)2, 250mM KPO4, 70 μM H3BO3, 14 μM MnCl2, 500nM CuSO4, 1 μM ZnSO4, 200nM Na2MoO4, 10 μM NaCl, 10nM CoCl2, 50 μM FeSO4; pH adjusted to 5.7; supplemented with 1% (w/v) agar and 1% (w/v) sucrose; [CIT0017]] in a 16/8h light/dark regime at 21 °C. TS-GUS, containing a transcriptionally silenced β-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene, has been described elsewhere ([CIT0024]et al., 2000). All transgenic lines were generated in A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 using the floral dip method ([CIT0008]), unless indicated otherwise. The T-DNA insertion lines are displayed in Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online and were obtained from NASC (http://www.arabidopsis.info; [CIT0023]et al., 2001; [CIT0001]et al., 2003). Primers used for genotyping mutant lines are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online. For generation of mutant combinations, single mutants were crossed, and confirmed F1 individuals were then used for further crossing into additional mutant lines. Segregation of the TS-GUS transgene was confirmed by GUS staining as described previously ([CIT0020]et al., 2010). The idn2/fdm hextuple and idr triple mutants were confirmed by genotyping in at least two independent lines each. For generation of FDM1p::GUS, we used primers 5′-GGGTCGA CAATGGGAGGACGGTGCTC-3′ and 5′- GGGTCGACCATCCT ACCTGCTTTACCTGG-3′ to amplify an FDM1 promoter fragment (2001bp), which was subsequently cloned into pPZP-GUS ([CIT0010]et al., 2000). A similar strategy was employed for FDM2p::GUS (primers 5′-GGGTCGACGCTACGCTCAAGCCTAATC-3′ and 5′-GGGTC GACCATCGTACCTGCTTTACCT-3′ to give a fragment of 2061bp) and for FDM5p::GUS (primers 5′- GGGTCGACGACTT CCCTTACGTCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGGTCGACCATCCTAGTAGGT GGCCTGT-3′ to give a fragment of 1670bp). For the generation of FDM translational reporter constructs, we first amplified full-length cDNAs using primers 5′-GGCCCG GGGATGAGCATTTCTGATGAAGAG-3′ plus 5′-GGCCCGG GTCAGGTTCTTTTGCGTTTCAG-3′ for FDM1, and 5′-GGCC CGGGGATGGATAACAGTTCTGATG-3′ plus 5′-GGCCCGGG TTAGGCTCGTCTGCGTTTGAG-3′ for FDM5, and confirmed them by sequencing. Expression cassettes were cloned into a derivative of pPZP221 modified with the 35S terminator sequence ([CIT0016]et al., 1994; [CIT0021]et al., 2012). For FDM1– and FDM5–VENUS reporters, a VENUS cassette was fused to the 3′ end of the respective coding regions of cDNAs, and the resulting constructs were either expressed under the control of the RP40 promoter ([CIT0032]et al., 1997) or by endogenous FDM promoters (as was used for promoter–GUS constructs). For overexpression constructs, expression cassettes were cloned 3′ of an RP40 promoter fragment, which was generated by PCR with primers 5′-GGGAATTCCTGGAGATATATCGGGTAAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCTATCTCTCTTCTTCTTCTTCGCCGGGAA-3′. For analysis of transcript levels, poly-A+-enriched RNA was isolated from different tissues as described previously ([CIT0033]et al., 2003) and used for RT-PCR. GUS staining of FDM reporters and TS-GUS was performed as described previously ([CIT0020]et al., 2010). For determination of TS-GUS activity, we used established protocols ([CIT0024]et al., 2000; [CIT0034]et al., 2000). Briefly, soluble proteins from 12-d-old seedlings were extracted and incubated in 4-MUG assay buffer [50mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10mM EDTA, 0.1 % (w/v) SDS,0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1mM 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronic acid (4-MUG)] at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2M Na2CO3, and fluorescence was determined on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2000, excitation 365nm; emission 456nm). Emission values were normalized to the protein content of the samples. For visualization of FDM–VENUS reporter lines, we used an SP2 Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope. Seedlings were either viewed alive after brief staining in propidium iodide (100 µg ml–1) to visualize cell boundaries or fixed in 3.7 % (v/v) formaldehyde in microtubule stabilization buffer (MTSB: 50mM PIPES, 5mM EGTA, 5mM MgSO4) for 15min. After three washes in MTSB, seedlings were mounted in MTSB containing 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; 0.5ng ml–1) and viewed under the confocal laser-scanning microscope. For imaging, we used the following excitation conditions: 514nm (VENUS), 405nm (DAPI), and 561nm (propidium iodide). For comparative DNA methylation analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from 10-d-old seedlings ([CIT0009]et al., 1983). Digoxigenin-labelled probes were generated by PCR using primers 5′-GGATGCGATCATACCAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGGATGCAM CACSAG-3′ for the 5S rRNA gene or 5′-GTGGATATACCAAAAA CACAA-3′ and 5′-CTTAGCCTTCTTTTCAATCTCA-3′ for AtMu1 ([CIT0040]et al., 2010). Oligonucleotides 5′-AAACCTTTCGTAAGCT ACAGCCACTTTGTT-3′ and 5′-TCGGATTGGTTCTTCCTACC TCTTTACCTT-3′ were used for the generation of a MEA-ISR probe ([CIT0007]; [CIT0003]et al., 2009).
