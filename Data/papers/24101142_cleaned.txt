!~ABS~!  Plant auto-inhibited Ca2+-ATPases (ACA) are crucial in defining the shape of calcium transients and therefore in eliciting plant responses to various stimuli. Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes ten ACA isoforms that can be divided into four clusters based on gene structure and sequence homology. While isoforms from clusters 1, 2 and 4 have been characterized, virtually nothing is known about members of cluster 3 (ACA12 and ACA13). Here we show that a GFP-tagged ACA12 localizes at the plasma membrane and that expression of ACA12 rescues the phenotype of partial male sterility of a null mutant of the plasma membrane isoform ACA9, thus providing genetic evidence that ACA12 is a functional plasma membrane-resident Ca2+-ATPase. By ACA12 expression in yeast and purification by CaM-affinity chromatography, we show that, unlike other ACAs, the activity of ACA12 is not stimulated by CaM. Moreover, full length ACA12 is able to rescue a yeast mutant deficient in calcium pumps. Analysis of single point ACA12 mutants suggests that ACA12 loss of auto-inhibition can be ascribed to the lack of two acidic residues—highly conserved in other ACA isoforms—localized at the cytoplasmic edge of the second and third transmembrane segments. Together, these results support a model in which the calcium pump activity of ACA12 is primarily regulated by increasing or decreasing mRNA expression and/or protein translation and degradation.
!~RES~! To define the intracellular localization of ACA12, transgenic plants expressing GFP-fused ACA12 (ACA12-GFP) under the control of the 35S promoter were generated and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Figure 1 shows that GFP fluorescence localizes at the periphery of the cells, consistent with a PM localization of ACA12 (panels A, B, D, G). To confirm this indication, roots were briefly (5–10 min) exposed to the FM4-64 dye, which under these conditions selectively labels the PM (Bolte et al. CITATION): GFP and FM4-64 signals clearly co-localize at cell periphery (panels D–I). [[FIGURE]]  Based on these results we tested whether ACA12 was able to complement the pollen fertility phenotype of an aca9 null mutant. ACA9 is a PM localized isoform primarily expressed in pollen and its deletion has been shown to reduce growth of pollen tubes with high frequency of aborted fertilization leading to a threefold reduction in seed set (Schiøtt et al. CITATION). Results in Fig. 2 show that the expression of ACA12 rescues the aca9 mutant, while that of ACA2, which encodes for an ACA isoform localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (Hong et al. CITATION), is unable to complement the defect. Consistent with this difference in rescue potential, ACA12-YFP was observed to localize at the PM in pollen, whereas ACA2 was limited to the endomembranes (Online Resource 2). Together, these results indicate that ACA12 is a functional PM Ca2+ pump. [[FIGURE]]  To biochemically characterize ACA12, plasmids encoding ACA12 and ACA12-GFP (the latter contains also a 6His tag) under the control of the GAL1 promoter were used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K616, which lacks endogenous Ca2+-ATPases (Cunningham and Fink CITATION). After induction of the yeast strain carrying ACA12-GFP, microsomes were isolated and solubilized microsomal proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted and decorated with the HisProbe-HPR (Fig. 3). After standard induction conditions (24 h at 30 °C) the probe recognizes only a very faint band of the expected molecular mass (141 kDa). However, an increase in accumulation was observed if the temperature during induction was lowered to 20 °C. Nevertheless, even in this condition, ACA12-GFP expression levels were very low compared to that of another ACA isoform: the signal in the lane containing a His-tagged Δ109-ACA8 is much stronger than that of ACA12-GFP, although 100-fold more microsomal proteins were loaded in the latter case; moreover also under this conditions the HisProbe-HPR labels several smaller bands (the most prominent of about 70 kDa) indicative of ACA12-GFP degradation. Attempts to improve ACA12-GFP expression by further lowering the temperature of induction till 12 °C (Fig. 3), by lowering Ca2+ concentration in the medium during induction to possibly select cells efficiently expressing the heterologous Ca2+-ATPase (Cunningham and Fink CITATION), or by changing promoter were unsuccessful (data not shown). [[FIGURE]]  K616 yeast strain, being devoid of endogenous Ca2+-ATPases, is unable to grow in Ca2+-depleted media unless it expresses a deregulated form of ACA (Curran et al. CITATION; Bonza et al. CITATION; Baekgaard et al. CITATION). We checked whether at 20 °C ACA12-GFP allows K616 growth in a Ca2+-depleted medium: Fig. 4 shows that K616 yeast expressing ACA12-GFP grows in the presence of 5 mM EGTA nearly as well as that expressing the deregulated Δ74-ACA8 mutant, while that expressing WT ACA8 is unable to grow under these conditions (Bonza et al. CITATION). This result indicates that the yeast expressed ACA12-GFP protein is functional and not auto-inhibited. A rescue was also obtained by K616 transformation with an untagged ACA12, indicating that the WT protein is also expressed in a functional form and that the addition of the GFP did not somehow cause the tagged pump to become de-regulated. [[FIGURE]]  Given the low expression level of ACA12-GFP (and probably also of ACA12, see below) it is extremely unlikely that yeast growth under selective conditions is enabled by some ACA12 fragment which has lost the auto-inhibitory domain. However, to evaluate this possibility, we purified ACA12 from yeast using CaM-affinity chromatography (Bonza et al. CITATION, CITATION; Fusca et al. CITATION; Bonza and Luoni CITATION), and tested its biochemical properties.  Panel A in Fig. 5 shows the main fractions obtained from purification of ACA12-GFP, which can be easily monitored thanks to the His tag. Upon overnight incubation with CaM-Sepharose of the microsomal proteins solubilized from K616 cells expressing ACA12-GFP, a relevant portion of the protein remains associated to the resin (compare lane 1 with lane 2, on which comparable amounts of the solubilized microsomal fraction and of the unbound fraction were loaded). The intact ACA12-GFP protein (141 kDa) is eluted upon Ca2+-chelation with 2 mM EGTA (lane 3), while the His-tagged lower molecular weight bands are undetectable in the EGTA-eluted fraction. Moreover, the 141 kDa band is by far the most prominent after SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the EGTA-eluted fraction (lane 5), indicating that this procedure allows the recovery of quite pure ACA12-GFP protein, albeit in tiny amounts (ca. 1 μg protein per mg of microsomal protein). Upon application of the same purification procedure to microsomes from K616 cells expressing WT ACA12 (panel B in Fig. 5), a band of 113 kDa is prominent in the EGTA-eluted fraction (lane 3), indicating that CaM-affinity also allows purification of the untagged ACA12 protein, albeit still with low yield (ca. 1 μg ACA12 per mg of microsomal protein). [[FIGURE]]  The purified ACA12 protein has Ca2+-ATPase activity insensitive to CaM even when supplied at 10 μM concentration (Table 1). ACA12 activity is inhibited by vanadate, a well known inhibitor of P-type ATPases, but in contrast with other ACAs (Bonza and De Michelis CITATION and references therein) is virtually unable to use ITP as an alternative substrate (Table 1). As with other ACAs, ACA12 is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of eosin Y (Fig. 6), a fluorescein derivative which acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the nucleoside triphosphate substrate (De Michelis et al. CITATION); however, the effective concentrations are about 2 order of magnitude higher that those required to inhibit ACA8 (Bonza et al. CITATION).[[TABLE]] [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]] The specific activity of the purified ACA12 is low as compared to the CaM-stimulated activity of ACA8 purified under the same conditions which ranges between 2 and 3 μmol min−1mg−1 protein (Bonza and Luoni CITATION, unpublished data from the authors laboratory). This low activity is very unlikely to be an intrinsic characteristic of ACA12, since it is able to complement the K616 phenotype despite its very low expression level. Rather, it is probably due to protein damage during purification: indeed, the activity of purified ACA12 decreases by 50–80 % upon freezing and storage at −80 °C (data not shown) and can be preserved overnight only by maintaining the protein at 4 °C in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (100-fold molar excess). We tried to improve ACA12 activity by adding phospholipids during the solubilization and/or purification procedure, without success. The finding that the expression level of ACA12-GFP in mature leaves of transgenic plants expressing ACA12-GFP under the control of the 35S promoter is fairly low (data not shown) suggests that protein instability might be an intrinsic feature of ACA12. Alignment of ACA12 (Fig. 7) with the other ACAs of Arabidopsis shows that two residues crucial for auto-inhibition of type 2B Ca2+-ATPases and conserved in all members of the other three clusters, are variant in ACA12 and ACA13: ACA12 N211 aligns with an Asp, and R334 with a Glu in ACAs belonging to the other three clusters. In studies on other ACA isoforms as well as on a PMCA, single point mutations of each of these two acidic residues, respectively localized at the edge of TM2 and of TM3, generates constitutively active proteins, insensitive to CaM (Curran et al. CITATION; Bredeston and Adamo CITATION; Fusca et al. CITATION). We generated ACA12 mutants in which N211 was mutated to Asp and/or R334 to Glu: all mutants are expressed in K616 yeast at levels similar to that of the WT protein (Online Resource 3). While the N211D-ACA12 only partially impairs the ability of the construct to rescue the growth phenotype (Fig. 4), there was no rescue with a single substitution of R334E-ACA12 or a double N211D-R334E substitution. [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~!  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes WS or Columbia were used for all plant experiments. For testing the ability of an ACA12 (At3g63380) gene to rescue a loss of function of ACA9 (At3g21180), two WS ecotype-based T-DNA insertion alleles were used, aca9-1 and aca9-2 (Schiøtt et al. CITATION). For subcellular localization experiments, a transgene encoding an ACA12-GFP was transformed into A. thaliana ecotype Columbia. For growing plants, seeds were sown on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, pH 5.7 and stratified at 4 °C for 48 h. Seedlings were grown at room temperature (22 °C) under 24 h light for 7–10 days before being transplanted to soil. The soil used was Sunshine SMB-238 supplemented with 10-10-10 fertilizer (Hummert) and Marathon pesticide (Hummert) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants were grown until maturity in a green house (with light and temperature conditions varying by seasons), or in growth chambers with a photoperiod of 16 h of light at 20 °C and 8 h of dark at 18 °C. Plasmid construct 35S::ACA12-GFP (plasmid stock ps 391, see Online Resource 1), encodes an ACA12 with a C-terminal GFP followed by a 6His tag, downstream of a 35S promoter in a pBIN101.2 plant expression vector (Bevan CITATION), harboring a kanamycin (kanr) resistance marker for bacterial and plant selections. This ACA12 coding sequence was generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from A. thaliana (Columbia), and sub-cloning into a pBIN101.2 plant expression vector (Bevan CITATION). The ACA12 coding sequence begins with ATGAGGGACCTC and ends with CTCAAGAAACCT. The stop codon was removed to allow an in frame fusion with a GFP. The genomic sequence for ACA12 does not contain any intron. The absence of PCR mistakes was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid construct ACA9promoter::ACA12-TAP2(YFP) (ps 688, see Online Resource 1), encodes an ACA12 with a C-terminal YFP downstream of a promoter from a preferentially pollen expressed gene, ACA9 (Schiøtt et al. CITATION). This construct was based on a derivative of the pGreenII plant expression vector (Hellens et al. CITATION) [kanr in bacteria, hygromycin-resistance (hygr) in plants]. Plasmid construct ACA9promoter::ACA2-TAP2(GFP) (ps 585, see Online Resource 1), is similar to ps 688 except that it encodes an ER-localized ACA2 (Hong et al. CITATION) fused to GFP. For heterologous expression in yeast, ACA12 and ACA12-GFP coding sequences were amplified by PCR (Robocycler gradient 40, Stratagene) using ps 391 as template and cloned into the pYES2 vector (Online Resource 1). Generation of N211D and R334E mutants of ACA12-GFP was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, using WT ACA12-GFP full length cDNA inserted in the pYES2 as a template (Online Resource 1). Plants were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using the floral-dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION). For the pGreenII vector, the Agrobacterium also included a pSOUP helper plasmid with a tetracycline resistance gene (Hellens et al. CITATION). T1 seedlings were grown on 0.5× MS medium (pH 5.7) containing 1 % agar, 0.05 % MES, and 25 μg/ml hygromycin (pGreenII based constructs) or 50 μg/ml kanamycin (pBIN based vector) to identify stable transgenic lines. Root images of 7–10 day old dark-grown seedlings expressing ACA12-GFP under the control of the 35S promoter were collected using an Olympus IX81 FV1000 confocal microscope run by the Olympus FluoView 1.07.03.00 software package equipped with a 60× objective (numerical aperture 1.42) (Fig. 1A–C) or a confocal microscope Leica TCS SP2 AOBS with a 40× oil-immersion objective (Fig. 1D–I). For co-localization experiments seedlings were exposed for 5–10 min to 4 μM FM4-64 dye freshly prepared solution (Bolte et al. CITATION). Excitation at wavelengths of 488 nm was provided with an Argon-Ion laser. A spectral emission range of 500–600 nm was used for GFP imaging, while a 500–530 nm (GFP) and a 625–665 nm (FM4-64) range were used in co-localization experiments. cDNAs coding for ACA12, ACA12-GFP, and ACA12-GFP mutants were in pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Plasmids were used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K616 [MATa pmr1::HIS3 pmc1::TRP1 cnb1::LEU2, ade2, ura3 (Cunningham and Fink CITATION)] using a lithium acetate/single-stranded DNA/polyethylene glycol protocol and transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy by plating on complete synthetic medium lacking uracil (SC-URA) as described (Bonza et al. CITATION). To induce protein expression, the different yeast strains were grown in SC-URA medium containing 2 % (w/v) galactose, 1 % (w/v) raffinose, 50 mM succinic acid/Tris (pH 5.5), 0.7 % (w/v) yeast nitrogen base and 10 mM CaCl2, for 24 h at 20 °C. For complementation experiments, single colonies of the different strains were grown in a SC-URA medium containing 2 % (w/v) glucose, 50 mM succinic acid/Tris (pH 5.5), 0.7 % (w/v) yeast nitrogen base and 10 mM CaCl2; cultured cells were pelletted, washed and diluted with water to A600 = 1 − 0.3 − 0.1. Five μL of each dilution were spotted on solid SC-URA medium containing 2 % (w/v) galactose, 1 % (w/v) raffinose, 50 mM succinic acid/Tris (pH 5.5), 0.7 % (w/v) yeast nitrogen base supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EGTA. As controls, yeast strain K616 transformed with the pYES2 empty vector or expressing full length ACA8 or the Δ74-ACA8 truncated mutant were used (Bonza and Luoni CITATION). Growth was recorded after 3–8 days of incubation at 20 °C. Microsomal fraction was isolated as previously reported (Fusca et al. CITATION) except that yeast cells were lysed using a Cell Disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd) operating at 27 psi. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad) with γ-globulin as standard. CaM-affinity purification was performed as described (Fusca et al. CITATION) with slight modifications. Proteins (100 mg) from yeast microsomes expressing ACA12 or ACA12-GFP were incubated with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (4 mg detergent ml−1: 4 mg protein ml−1) at 25 °C for 30 min in a solubilization medium containing 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM p-aminobenzamidine, 2 mM DTT, 1.5 mM ATP, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 125 mM NaCl, supplemented with 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 5 μg ml−1 pepstatin, 5 μg ml−1 chymostatin immediately before use. The sample was then centrifuged 1 h at 110,000g at 4 °C; the supernatant recovered and incubated overnight under gentle rotation at 4 °C with 0.8 ml of CaM-Sepharose (GeHealthcare) previously equilibrated with solubilization medium supplemented with 37.5 μg ml−1 Brij 58. After removal of the unbound fraction, the resin was washed with 10 ml of washing medium containing 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM Mops-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM p-aminobenzamidine, 2 mM DTT, 0.25 mM NaBr, 37.5 μg ml−1 Brij 58, 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 5 μg ml−1 pepstatin, 5 μg ml−1 chymostatin, 100 μM CaCl2, 100 μM MgSO4; second and third washes were performed in the same medium but in the absence of CaCl2 and MgSO4 (Bonza et al. CITATION; Fusca et al. CITATION). CaM-bound proteins were eluted in 2.5 ml of 5 mM Mops-KOH, pH 7.5, 37.5 μg ml−1 Brij 58, 10 % (v/v) glycerol and 2 mM EGTA, followed by 1.5 ml of the same solution. The EGTA-eluted fractions were supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2, pooled and concentrated 10- to 20-fold on Vivaspin ultrafiltration spin columns, 30 kDa cut-off (Sartorius), to a final concentration of 250–600 μg ml−1. The EGTA-eluted fraction was immediately used for assay of Ca2+-ATPase activity or re-lipidated by overnight incubation at 4 °C under gentle rotation with soybean phosphatidylcoline (PC). PC, dissolved in 20 mg ml−1 Brij 58 and then diluted ten times in water to a final concentration of 8.5 mM, was supplied at 500 μM (Gourdon et al. CITATION). Re-lipidated ACA12 maintains the same Ca2+-ATPase activity of the freshly purified protein (data not shown). SDS–PAGE and western blotting were performed as previously described (Bonza et al. CITATION). ACA12-GFP decoration was performed incubating the nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 25 °C with the HisProbe-HRP, a nickel activated derivative of horseradish peroxidase (Thermo Scientific) which can bind to the His tag fused to the C-terminus of the protein. The probe was diluted 1:5,000 in 0.05 % (w/v) polyoxy-ethylene(20)sorbitan monolaurate, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4. ECL signal was acquired and quantified by the Fluor-Chem™SP Imaging System and AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech). Alternatively, gel was stained with silver impregnation (ProteoSilver™ Silver Stain Kit, Sigma Aldrich) or Coomassie blue staining method. Activity of purified ACA12 (400–600 ng for each sample) was measured as Ca2+-dependent Mg-ATP hydrolysis as previously described (Bonza and Luoni CITATION). Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was evaluated as the difference between activity measured in the presence of 40 μM free Ca2+ and that measured in the absence of Ca2+ in the assay medium. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 60 min, during which the reaction proceeds linearly. All the assays were performed at least three times, with three replicates.
