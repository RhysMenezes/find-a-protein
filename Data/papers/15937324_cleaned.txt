!~ABS~! LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) is an F-box protein that has been postulated to function centrally, or near to the circadian clock oscillator. As a first step to determine which proteins act as substrates of LKP2, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using LKP2 as bait, and two interaction factors, Di19 and COL1, were isolated. The transiently expressed Di19–GUS fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of Arabidopsis petiole cells. COL1 and other CO/COL family proteins could also interact with LKP1/ZTL, LKP2 or FKF1. The LKP2-binding site in CO or COL1 was near the center of each protein. The CCT motif in CO or COL1 was not sufficient for interaction with LKP2. LKP2 recognized CO with F-box and kelch repeat-containing regions, while it recognized COL1 with an LOV domain. When LKP2 was fused with cyan fluorescent proein (CFP) and transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells, CFP–LKP2 signals were localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Both yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–CO and YFP–COL1 were located in the nucleus, forming nuclear bodies when they were transiently expressed. However, co-expression of CFP–LKP2 with YFP fused to either CO or COL1 resulted in the recruitment of CFP–LKP2 in nuclear bodies. Furthermore, the CFP–LKP2 and YFP–CO signals co-localized with signals for pU2B′′–mRFP, which is a marker for Cajal bodies. These results suggest the possibility that LKP2 functions with CO/COL family proteins in the nuclear bodies.
!~RES~! We used yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate proteins that interact with LKP2. Yeast cells were co-transformed with the pGBKT7 vector carrying LKP2 full-length cDNA, and with a 2.5×105 clone cDNA library in the pGADT7 vector that had been prepared with RNA from Arabidopsis rosette leaves. Two hundred and twenty candidate clones were selected by complementation on SD medium amended with 5 mM 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) but lacking adenine, histidine, leucine and tryptophan. As a second screening, plasmids from candidate clones were isolated and re-co-transformed into yeast cells with pGBKT7-LKP2. Among the 220 plasmid pools isolated, 90 gave auxotrophic complementation, of which 48 colonies could grow in the presence of 5 mM 3-AT. Twenty of these colonies could grow at 10 mM 3-AT and 14 colonies could grow at 15 mM 3-AT. As a third screening, we sequenced all of the pGADT7-cDNA isolates from the 14 colonies that grew at 15 mM 3-AT. Most of the co-transformed clones isolated after three rounds of screening were rRNA, chloroplast or vacuole proteins, and out-of-frame clones. Clones for chloroplast and vacuole proteins were eliminated since LKP2 is thought to reside mainly in nuclei (Yasuhara et al. 2004). Other clones were a DnaJ-like protein, drought-induced unknown proteins (two clones of different size), a serine/threonine protein kinase and a zinc finger protein. As a fourth screening, we co-transformed yeast cells with each one of five pGADT7-cDNA plasmids and with pGBKT7 empty vector. As a result, two clones activated the two-hybrid system without pGBKT7-LKP2. Therefore, we concluded that the drought-induced unknown protein, Di19, and the zinc finger protein, COL1, could be LKP2-binding proteins. Di19 was initially isolated as a drought-inducible cDNA clone (Gosti et al. 1995), but there is no more information about this gene. Both of our Di19 clones were partial and corresponded to a truncated peptide either from amino acids 53–206 or 63–206, so we performed the two-hybrid assay with a full-length Di19 reverse transcription (RT)–PCR cDNA. Full-length Di19 interacted with LKP2 and other members of the LKP/ZTL protein family (Fig. 1). Interactions also occurred when the DNA-binding and activation domains of GAL4 were exchanged (data not shown). There were no effects of light on two-hybrid interactions in the red, far-red, blue, green or white light spectra at 40 µmol m–2 s–1 (data not shown). To visualize the intracellular localization of Di19, the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter-derived β-glucuronidase (GUS)–Di19 fusion protein construct and a vector control were introduced into Arabidopsis petiole cells by bombardment. Di19–GUS activity was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2A, B), but vector control GUS activity was not limited to any cellular region or organelle (Fig. 2C). Thus, subcellular Di19 co-locates with LKP2 (Yasuhara et al. 2004). COL1 is a member of the CO/COL1 family of proteins, and has two B-box-type zinc finger motifs and a CCT motif (Ledger et al. 2001). The CCT motif is conserved in all CO/COL and PRR/TOC1 family proteins, while some CO/COL proteins contain only one B-box motif. Since the COL1 cDNA isolated from yeast cells was truncated, we examined the molecular interactions between COL1 and LKP2 using a full-length COL1 cDNA and a series of deletions (Fig. 3A). Full-length COL1(1–355) activated the reporter genes in the absence of LKP2. An N-terminal deletion of COL1(145–355) could also activate the system without LKP2. However, both COL1(163–355) and COL1(195–355) could activate the reporter genes depending on the presence of LKP2. COL1(195–355) corresponded to the clone that had been isolated from two-hybrid screening. Neither COL1(228–355) nor COL1(286–327), having deletions that contained the CCT motif, could activate the reporter genes. These results suggested that the interaction between COL1 and LKP2 required the COL1 region containing amino acids 195–227. None of the interactions was affected by light at 40 µmol m–2 s–1 (data not shown). We also examined the two-hybrid interactions of LKP/ZTL family members with other CO/COL family members (Fig. 3B). Since the zinc finger-containing region of COL1 activated the reporter genes without a prey insert, we eliminated the zinc finger motif(s) from all tested CO/COL proteins. Vector pGBKT7, or pGADT7 for CO/COL proteins, was used to decrease background activation levels. As a result, CO and COL1-6, COL8 and COL13–15 interacted with LKP2, and some also interacted with LKP1/ZTL or FKF1. As in interactions with Di19, there was no observable effect of light on the two-hybrid interaction (data not shown). Interaction between CO and LKP2 was examined using a series of N- and C-terminal deletion derivatives (Fig. 3C). CO(1–373) and a series of N-terminal-deleted mutants, CO(106–373), CO(140–373) and CO(157–373), activated the reporter genes independently of LKP2. CO(175–373), CO(208–373) and CO(241–373) interacted significantly with LKP2 in this assay. As for the C-terminal domain deletion mutant series, CO(175–326) interacted with LKP2, while CO(175–305), CO(175–275), CO(175–239) and CO(175–206) gave activation in the absence of LKP2. The CCT motif of CO(306–348) did not interact with LKP2, as seen in COL1 CCT. The domains of LKP2 that are required for the interaction with CO or COL1 were investigated by the two-hybrid system (Fig. 3D). Either the F-box or kelch repeat-containing region was sufficient for interaction with CO, while the LOV domain-containing region was necessary and sufficient for interaction with COL1. CO was reported to be localized in the nucleus (Robson et al. 2001). CO is a transcription factor protein, and nuclear partitioning is thought to be important for its transcriptional activity (Robson et al. 2001). LKP2 was also reported to be localized in the nucleus (Yasuhara et al. 2004). To examine the subcellular co-localization of those proteins, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)–LKP2, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–CO and YFP–COL1 fusions were constructed. To confirm the reliability of our fluorescence detection system, we first bombarded YFP–CO alone and acquired an image through the CFP channel. The YFP signal of YFP–CO proteins was detected through the YFP channel in an exposure time of 200 ms (Supplementary Fig. S2D). However, YFP signals were not detected through the CFP channel in exposure times of 700 or 1,500 ms (Supplementary Fig. S2A, B). Even with an exposure time of 4000 ms, very faint YFP signals were detected through the CFP channel (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Therefore, we determined that the exposure time was <1,000 ms in this co-localization assay. Each fusion gene was put under control of the CaMV 35S promoter and bombarded into onion epidermal cells. YFP–CO and YFP–COL1 proteins were localized in the nucleus and formed nuclear bodies when they were co-expressed with CFP (Fig. 4G, 5G). CFP–LKP2 was observed in the nucleus and cytosol when it was co-expressed with YFP (Fig. 4B, 5B). When CFP–LKP2 and YFP–CO or YFP–COL1 were co-bombarded, the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning ratio of CFP-associated fluorescence increased, and CFP–LKP2 formed nuclear bodies (Fig. 4J, 5J). The position of CFP–LKP2 nuclear bodies was perfectly co-incident with YFP–CO or YFP–COL1 nuclear bodies (Fig. 4L, 5L). Co-localization of CFP–LKP2 and YFP–CO was also confirmed by three-dimensional image reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. S4). These co-localization patterns were not affected by incubation illumination conditions that we tested (data not shown). As for Di19, YFP–Di19 and CFP–LKP2 signals were also co-localized when they were co-expressed in onion cells. We examined 26 cells. In 21 cells, YFP–Di19 signals were detected only in nuclei while CFP–LKP2 signals were detected in nuclei and cytosol (Supplementary Fig. S3A). However, both CFP–LKP2 and YFP–Di19 signals were localized in nuclear bodies of five of the examined cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Two markers were employed to define further the nature of the nuclear bodies. One is U2B′′ [U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-specific B′′ protein], which is a molecular marker of Cajal bodies, and the other is SCL28 (SC35-like protein with an Mr of 28), which is a marker for spliceosomal speckles (Lorkovic et al. 2004, Shaw and Brown 2004). In onion cells, CFP–LKP2, YFP–CO and U2B′′–mRFP signals were co-localized, while SCL28–RFP signals were not coincident with those for CFP–LKP2 or YFP–CO (Fig. 6).
!~MM~! Plasmid DNA templates for sequencing were prepared and DNA sequences were determined as described previously (Yasuhara et al. 2004). The GENETYX (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan) and Sequencher (Gene Codes Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) software systems were used for the DNA sequence analysis. The two-hybrid assay was performed as described (Yasuhara et al. 2004). cDNA library construction and subsequent two-hybrid screening were according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MATCHMAKER Library Construction & Screening Kit, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with RNA isolated from rosette leaves of Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype), which had been grown under LD conditions of 16 h light and 8 h dark at 22°C, and harvested at 4 h intervals (0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 h) from the onset of illumination. A full-length LKP2 cDNA with the GAL4 activating domain was used as bait. Columbia versions of cDNA for Di19, CO, COL1-10 and COL13–16 were obtained by RT–PCR with ReverTra Dash (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) or from RIKEN Bio Resource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). Clones were PCR-amplified to generate suitable restriction enzyme sites, subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), verified by sequencing, and subcloned into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors. The primers used for PCR were the following: 5′-GGATCCGAATTCATGGACGCTGATTCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCGAATTCGACTTCATCGAAAATGGC-3′ for Di19; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTTGAAACAAGAGAGTAAC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAGAATGAAGGAACAATCCCAT-3′ for CO; 5′-AGGATCCTTATGTTGAAAGTAGAGAGTAAC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAGAATGATGGAACAATTCCAT-3′ for COL1; 5′-AGGATCCGTGAGTACCTTGATCTTGTGGAT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTTAGAAGGAAGGAACAATTCCAT-3′ for COL2; 5′-AGGATCCGTGAAATCACTAATTTGTTTTCC-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAGAAACTCGGAACAACACCGA-3′ for COL3; 5′-AAGATCTGTTCAGCTGAGGAAGTTCCGGGA-3′ and 5′-AAGATCTCTAAAATGTAGGTACAAGTCCGA-3′ for COL4; 5′-AGGATCCGTGGTTCTTCTGACTTTATGTTT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAGAACGTTGGTACGACACCGT-3′ for COL5; 5′-ATGATCAGAGATCAAGATGAAGGTGATGAG-3′ and 5′-AGAGCTCTTAGTGAGCAACACCAATTGAAG-3′ for COL6; 5′-AGGATCCGTAAGGAACCAAACGATGTTGGA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCACGTCAAAAGTGACGTCCTCT-3′ for COL7; 5′-AGGATCCGTTTGATGAGCTGCAAGAAAGAT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTAAGAGTCGATGGCTAAAGATC-3′ for COL8; 5′-AGGATCCGTATGTGTGAAGATGACTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-AGAGCTCTCAATAACTTCTGGTTGGGGTGA-3′ for COL9; 5′-AGGATCCGTGTATGTGAGGATGACTTCAAT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAGTAGCTTCTTGTTGGGCTCA-3′ for COL10; 5′-AGGATCCGTATCCGACAGCTCCGTGGACTA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCATGGATCTGCTGCCTTGGCGA-3′ for COL13; 5′-AGGATCCGGACTAATCATAGCACTGGCCAG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTAAGGATCTGTAGCTTTCACAA-3′ for COL14; 5′-AGGATCCGTACTACTACTAATCCTAGTGGT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTTAAGGGTAAGGAGCTTCACTAG-3′ for COL15; and 5′-AGGATCCGTGATGATGATCGAAAAGACGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCAGTAATTAACACCTAATGGTG-3′ for COL16. For COL1 deletions, each construct was PCR-amplified, subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), verified by sequencing, and ligated into two-hybrid vectors. The forward primers used for PCR were 5′-AGGATCCGTCCTAATTCAGGGAAAAACAGT-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTTTTCTGAACCTTGTTGATTAT-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTGGGGAAGATGGAGTTGTTCCA-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTGCTCTTCGAAGCTCCAATGGT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCGTAGAGAAGCTAGAGTCCTGAGA-3′; and the reverse primers were 5′-AGGATCCTCAGAATGATGGAACAATTCCAT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTTTGCAAACCGGCCCTTGATCC-3′. For CO deletions, each construct was PCR-amplified, subcloned, sequenced and ligated into two-hybrid vectors. The forward primers used for PCR were 5′-AGGATCCGTCTACCAATTTCTGGAAACTCT-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTGAAGGTGAAGAAGGTGATAAG-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTCCTAATTCAGACAAAAATAAC-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTGAGTATCTAAACCTTGTGGAT-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTTACGGGGGAGATAGAGTTGTT-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTTCAGGGACTCACTACAACGAC-3′, 5′-AGGATCCGTGAGTATCTAAACCTTGTGGAT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCGTAGAGAAGCCAGGGTCCTGAGA-3′, and the reverse primers were 5′-AGGATCCTCAGAATGAAGGAACAATCCCAA-3′ 5′-AGGATCCTATTGTCTTCTCAAATTTCCTTG-3′ 5′-AGGATCCGTCCATTGGACTGAGTTGTGTTA-3′ 5′-AGGATCCAGCTGTTGTGACACATGCTGTTG-3′ 5′-AGGATCCGCCATATTTGATATTGAACTGAA-3′ 5′-AGGATCCCGTCTGTGGTACGCTGCAGTTTT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCTCTCTTTGCGAACCGGCCATTGA-3′. For immunoblot analysis, yeast cells were grown in 50 ml of YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) medium for 4–8 h (OD600 = 0.6), pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were resuspended in 400 µl of extraction buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 8 M urea, 5% SDS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.4 mg ml–1 bromophenol blue, 0.8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 6.2 µg ml–1 pepstatin A, 1.86 µM leupeptin, 9.0 mM benzamidine, 23.0 µg ml–1 aprotinin, 0.77 mg ml–1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized. Crude cell extract (12 µl) was loaded onto each lane, and proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and electro-transferred onto nylon membranes. Proteins were detected by anti-cMyc or anti-hemagglutinin antibodies. Full-length Di19 cDNA was excised with BamHI and fused in-frame to a GUS reporter gene under control of the CaMV 35S promoter in the pBI221 binary vector (Clontech). A 1 µg aliquot of the resultant plasmid DNA was bombarded into Arabidopsis petioles with a PDS-1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System (BioRad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The bombarded petioles were maintained at 25°C for at least 12 h until they were observed microscopically for signs of successful transformation. As a control, pBI221 was also bombarded into petioles. GUS staining and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) observation were performed as described previously (Yasuhara et al. 2004). Transient expression vectors that carry CaMV 35S::CFP (pAVA574) and CaMV 35S::YFP (pAVA554) were used for co-bombardment experiments (von Arnim et al. 1998). Full-length LKP2, CO, COL1 and Di19 clones were cut with BamHI, end-filled with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into the blunted BglII site of pAVA574 or pAVA554 to form in-frame fusion genes, as verified by sequencing. pU2B′′–mRFP and pSCL28 were used as Cajal body and nuclear speckles markers, respectively (Lorkovic et al. 2004). A 1 µg aliquot of each plasmid DNA was bombarded into onion epidermal cells. CFP, YFP and RFP signals were detected with a BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a CCD camera, Retiga Exi fast-cooled Mono 12 bit (QimaginG, Burnaby, BC, Canada) and standard CFP or YFP filter (Olympus). The images were analyzed with MetaMorph Imaging Software Version 6.1 (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA, USA). Three-dimensional deconvoluted images were constructed using AutoDeblur/AutoVisualize (version 9.3) software (AutoQuant Imaging, New York, NY, USA).
