!~ABS~! The cell wall forms the first line of interaction between the plant and the external environment. Based on the observation that ascorbate‐deficient vtc mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana have increased cell wall peroxidase activity, the cell wall glycoproteome of vtc2‐2 was investigated. Glycoproteins were purified from fully expanded leaves by Concanavalin A affinity chromatography and analysed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry. This procedure identified 63 proteins with predicted glycosylation sites and cell wall localization. Of these, 11 proteins were differentially expressed between vtc2‐2 and wild type. In particular, PRX33/34 were identified as contributing to increased peroxidase activity in response to ascorbate deficiency. This is the same peroxidase previously shown to contribute to hydrogen peroxide generation and pathogen resistance. Three fasciclin‐like arabinogalactan proteins (FLA1, 2 and 8) had lower abundance in vtc2‐2. Inspection of published microarray data shows that these also have lower gene expression in vtc1 and vtc2‐1 and are decreased in expression by pathogen challenge and oxidative stresses. Ascorbate deficiency therefore impacts expression of cell wall proteins involved in pathogen responses and these presumably contribute to the increased resistance of vtc mutants to biotrophic pathogens. 
!~RES~! To extract samples enriched in ionically bound cell wall proteins, the pellet from homogenized leaves was eluted with CaCl2. This treatment displaces ionically (non‐covalently) bound proteins from the pellet producing a supernatant that is enriched in cell wall enzymes such as type III peroxidase (Colville & Smirnoff CITATION). Peroxidase activity using pyrogallol as substrate was significantly higher in vtc2‐1, vtc2‐2 and vtc3‐1 than wild type (Col‐0) when the plants were grown in low light (LL, Fig. 1). Activity was not significantly higher in vtc1‐1 in the current experiments although it has been previously reported to be higher in this mutant (Veljovic‐Jovanovic et al. CITATION; Colville & Smirnoff CITATION). Under these growth conditions, apoplastic ascorbate was significantly lower in vtc1, 2 and 3 (Supporting Information Fig. S3). Growth in high light (HL) increased peroxidase activity in all genotypes by approximately twofold and abolished differences between genotypes. Protein concentration of the ionically bound protein fraction did not differ between genotypes and was marginally greater in HL. Peroxidase activity is therefore higher in vtc mutants when grown under normal laboratory lighting but this effect is swamped under light intensities closer to the natural environment. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 73 type III peroxidases, which are largely predicted to be targeted to the apoplast or vacuole (Valério et al. CITATION). Therefore, a mass spectrometry‐based proteomics approach was taken to discover which of these proteins are responsible for the increased peroxidase activity in ascorbate‐deficient plants.  [[FIGURE]] Proteins were isolated from pellets of fully expanded rosette leaf homogenates by eluting with CaCl2 and LiCl followed by affinity purification of the eluate by ConA affinity chromatography. This method should provide a fraction enriched in glycoproteins that are ionically bound to the cell wall (Minic et al. CITATION). Approximately 5187 peptides were detected in Col‐0, vtc1 and vtc2‐2 after deconvolution by Progenesis LC‐MS (Supporting Information Table S1). Of these, 2430 provided MS/MS spectra for peptide identification from which a total of 128 unique proteins (including 19 intracellular, 27 undefined and 82 secreted proteins) represented by two or more peptides, were identified from Col‐0, vtc1 and vtc2‐2 grown under LL and HL (Table 1). Their predicted intracellular locations were determined and, overall, 67% were predicted to be extracellular, secreted or associated with the endomembrane system. Therefore, this method provides significant enrichment in cell wall proteins. The 63 glycoproteins identified are shown in Table 2 (and Supporting Information Table S1). The identified proteins are mostly predicted to be N‐glycoslyated and are dominated by hydrolases, proteases, peroxidases, lectins, FLAs and receptor‐like kinases.  A detailed quantitative proteomic investigation focused on a comparison of Col‐0 and vtc2‐2. The relative expression of identified peptides, based on their LC‐MS peak areas normalized to the median of all peptides was calculated using Progenesis LC‐MS software. Peptides were bundled into their cognate proteins and the sum of the peaks areas of unique peptides for each protein was used to calculate relative protein abundance. Overall, 937 (P < 0.05) and 403 (P < 0.01) peptides were significantly different across strain and light comparisons (Supporting Information Table S1). Twelve cell wall proteins were identified as being significantly different (P < 0.05) between Col‐0 and vtc2‐2 (Table 3; Supporting Information Table S2). Of these, five were consistently more abundant in vtc2‐2 than in Col‐0 in both LL and HL – a lectin (At5g03350), two type III peroxidases (PRX33/At3g49110 and PRX34/At3g4912), a cysteine‐rich receptor‐like kinase (CRRK, At5g48540) and an aspartyl protease (At1g03220). Among the proteins with lower abundance in vtc2‐2 were three FLAs, FLA1 (At5g55730), FLA2 (At4g12730) and FLA8 (At2g45470). A germin‐like protein (GLP1/At1g72610) was decreased in HL acclimated wild type and vtc2‐2 plants but was higher in the Col‐0 compared with vtc2 in L and HL. The abundance of individual peptides for the closely related PRX33 and PRX34 are shown in Table 4. Since only one peptide is specific to PRX33 and six peptides are common to both proteins, it is not possible to conclude which of these two are more affected in vtc2‐2 (Fig. 2).  [[FIGURE]] Many cell wall proteins contain hydroxyproline which provides a site for glycosylation (Basu et al. CITATION). Ascorbate is required for maintaining the activity of prolyl hydroxylases during post‐translational proline hydroxylation (De Tullio et al. CITATION), so it is possible that glycoprotein abundance is affected by a limitation on proline hydroxylation in the vtc mutants. To assess this possibility, proline and hydroxyproline were measured after hydrolysing crude cell wall preparations. 34–42% of proline residues were hydroxylated, reflecting the postulated large proportion of hydroxyproline‐rich proteins in the cell wall. There was no significant difference between strains (Table 5). 
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana vtc1‐1, vtc2‐1, vtc3‐1 and vtc2‐2 mutants were obtained from Patricia Conklin (State University of New York, Cortland) and all were in the Col‐0 background (Conklin et al. CITATION). Surface‐sterilized seeds were cold treated for 3 d at 4 °C and sown onto medium containing four parts Levington F2 compost (DeJex, Doncaster, UK) to one part vermiculite. Plants were grown in controlled environment growth rooms under short day conditions (8 h light, 16 h dark) at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 100 μmol m−2 s−1, 23 °C and 65% relative humidity for 7 weeks.  Cell wall proteins were extracted using a modified version of a previously published method (Feiz et al. CITATION). 1 g of leaf tissue was extracted with 5 mL 5 mm potassium acetate buffer pH 4.6 with 0.5 m sucrose + 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and one mini EDTA‐free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The homogenate was centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing soluble protein was discarded and the pellet was washed and centrifuged (13 000 g for 10 min) six times with 5 mL of 5 mm potassium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) to remove sucrose and protease inhibitor. The supernatant was discarded and the cell wall proteins were extracted with 2.5 mL 0.2 M CaCl2 followed by two extractions with 2.5 mL 2 M LiCl. Total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bradford CITATION) using a γ‐globulin standard.  The cell wall proteins prepared as described above were purified by affinity chromatography using Concanavalin A (ConA) to enrich for glycoproteins (Minic et al. CITATION). A 1 mL Supelclean™ LC‐NH2 SPE tube (SUPELCO, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was emptied of its original contents and then filled with 1 mL of ConA Sepharose slurry (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) and washed with 3 mL of washing buffer (20 mm Tris‐HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2). The ionically bound cell wall protein extracts (1 mL) were loaded onto the gel and then washed with 3 mL of washing buffer. The proteins were eluted with 3 mL of 0.2 m methyl‐α‐glucopyranoside in the same buffer. The elute was collected and concentrated by Spin‐X UF 500 concentrators with a 10 kDa molecular weight cut‐off (Corning, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).  10 μL of concentrated sample was mixed with 4 μL of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 2 μL of RapiGest MS‐compatible detergent (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), and incubated for 20 min at 50 °C. 4 μL of 50 mm iodoacetamide was then added to the same mixture followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min in the dark. Proteins were digested with 0.1 μg trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. 1 μL of 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction and the samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis.  Peptides were separated and detected by LC‐ESI‐QToF MS/MS and label free quantitative analysis was carried out using Progenesis LC‐MS software (Non Linear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). The trypsinized samples were analysed with an Agilent 6520 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) QToF MS coupled to an high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)‐Chip interface system and the samples were loaded onto a large‐capacity micro C18 reverse‐phase analytical column (Agilent Protein Identification Chip, Agilent Technologies) comprising of a 160 nL enrichment column, and a 150 mm × 75 μm analytical column packed with Zorbax 300SB‐C18 5 μm material. The enrichment column flow rate was 3 μL min−1 and the analytical column flow rate was 0.4 μL min−1. Mobile phase A was 2% methanol with 0.1% formic acid in water and B was 95% methanol with 0.1% formic acid in water. Peptides were eluted with the following gradient: 0 min – 5% B, 10 min – 10% B; 65 min – 30% B; 100 min – 60%; 120 min – 100% B; 122 min – 100% B; 123 min – 5% B with a re‐equilibration time of 9 min. The mass spectrometer conditions were as follows. For the electrospray ionization source, the nitrogen gas temperature was 300 °C and gas flow rate was 4 L min−1. The capillary voltage was 1850 V with all analyses being carried out in positive ion mode. The fragmentor voltage was 175 V and the skimmer 70 V. Scanning was performed using the auto‐MS/MS function at 5 scans s−1 with sloped collision energy of 3.7 V/100 Da and an offset of −2.5 V. The data were loaded directly into Progenesis LC‐MS software, which deconvoluted m/z‐retention time features (peptides), aligned them across all samples and normalized abundances in each sample to the median abundance of all features. MS/MS spectra of the deconvoluted peptides were exported to SpectrumMill MS Proteomics Workbench software (Agilent Technologies) or Mascot (http://www.matrixscience.com) for peptide identification. The following data extraction and peptide identification settings were used: two maximum missed cleavages; fixed modification carbamidomethylation (C); variable modifications acetylation (K), oxidized methionine (M), pyroglutamic acid (N‐term Q), deaminated (N), N‐acetylglucosamine (S); peptide precursor m/z 300–1600 and charge +2 to +15 (+8 with Mascot); minimum MS signal/noise ratio 25; precursor ion mass tolerance ±20 ppm, product ion mass tolerance ±50 ppm; minimum scored peak intensity 50%, peptide filter score 6 and % scored peak intensity > 60, protein filter score >11 (to remove false positives). Peptides were identified with the Arabidopsis proteome database (TAIR10 release, http://www.arabidopsis.org/). The information on identified peptides was re‐imported into Progenesis LC‐MS software where their relative normalized abundances in each sample were calculated. Peptides were bundled into proteins and the overall abundance of each protein calculated. Significantly different proteins were identified by two‐way analysis of variance (anova) across strains and treatments using Progenesis LC‐MS. Predicted subcellular localization of proteins was obtained from TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and UniProtKB (http://www.uniprot.org/) with additional information from Signal P (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/; Bendtsen et al. CITATION), Target P (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/; Emanuelsson et al. CITATION), DictyOGlyc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DictyOGlyc/; Gupta et al. CITATION), NetOGlyc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) and NetNGlyc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/).  Peroxidase activity was measured in an assay mixture consisted of 230 μL of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm pyrogallol and 10 μL of protein extract. The reaction was initiated with 5 μL of 150 mm H2O2. The oxidation of pyrogallol was followed in a 96‐well plate with a Tecan Infinite reader (Tecan, Reading, UK) at 430 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.953 mm−1.  Leaves (1 g fresh weight) were harvested from 6‐week‐old plants and washed thoroughly with deionized water. Tissue was homogenized in a pestle and mortar with 5 mL of 5 mm potassium acetate buffer pH 4.6 containing 0.4 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone was then added in a 1:10 ratio with plant material and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min and the pellet collected. The pellet was suspended in 5 mm potassium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. A total of five washes with acetate buffer were performed and the final pellet was carried forward. The crude cell wall material was suspended in 6 m HCl containing 10 mm phenol and sealed under nitrogen before being incubated at 110 °C for approximately 20 h to hydrolyse proteins. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature, centrifuged to remove insoluble material and the supernatant collected, dried under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 0.1 mL water. Proline and hydroxyproline were measured by LC‐ESI‐MS/MS. This was performed using an Agilent 6420B triple quadruple (QQQ) mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode coupled with an Agilent 1200 series Rapid Resolution HPLC system (Agilent Technologies). Chromatography was performed on a ZIC‐HILIC column (particle size 3.5 μm, porosity 100 Å, internal diameter, 2.1 mm, length, 150 mm; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 35 °C. 2 μL of hydrolysate was injected. Mobile phase A contained 95% acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid. Mobile phase B contained 5%acetonitrile, 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.25 mL min−1 with 5% B at 0 min, 50% B at 10 min, 90% B from 15–20 min and 5% B at 25 min. The QQQ was operated in positive ion mode and ESI source conditions were nitrogen gas temperature 350 °C, drying gas flow rate 9 L min−1, nebulizer pressure 35 psig and capillary voltage 4 kV. Data were acquired in MRM mode with a dwell time of 50 ms. For proline, the precursor ion m/z was 116.1, fragmentor voltage 66 V, collision energy 20 V and the product ion m/z was 86. For hydroxyproline, the precursor ion m/z was 132, fragmentor voltage 66 V, collision energy 13 V and the product ion m/z was 86. Quantification was by comparison of peak areas with standards.
