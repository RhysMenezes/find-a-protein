!~ABS~! Riboflavin serves as a precursor for flavocoenzymes (FMN and FAD) and is essential for all living organisms. The two committed enzymatic steps of riboflavin biosynthesis are performed in plants by bifunctional RIBA enzymes comprised of GTP cyclohydrolase II (GCHII) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS). Angiosperms share a small RIBA gene family consisting of three members. A reduction of AtRIBA1 expression in the Arabidopsis rfd1mutant and in RIBA1 antisense lines is not complemented by the simultaneously expressed isoforms AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3. The intensity of the bleaching leaf phenotype of RIBA1 deficient plants correlates with the inactivation of AtRIBA1 expression, while no significant effects on the mRNA abundance of AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 were observed. We examined reasons why both isoforms fail to sufficiently compensate for a lack of RIBA1 expression. All three RIBA isoforms are shown to be translocated into chloroplasts as GFP fusion proteins. Interestingly, both AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 have amino acid exchanges in conserved peptides domains that have been found to be essential for the two enzymatic functions. In vitro activity assays of GCHII and DHBPS with all of the three purified recombinant AtRIBA proteins and complementation of E. coli ribA and ribB mutants lacking DHBPS and GCHII expression, respectively, confirmed the loss of bifunctionality for AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3. Phylogenetic analyses imply that the monofunctional, bipartite RIBA3 proteins, which have lost DHBPS activity, evolved early in tracheophyte evolution.
!~RES~! To examine the metabolic impact of the three RIBA isoforms identified in A. thaliana, the relative transcript amounts of the three AtRIBA homologs were assessed using qRT-PCR analyses in different tissues and developmental stages of wild-type plants. Transcripts of the three RIBA homologs accumulate in all analyzed tissues, but transcript levels were different ([f2-ijms-13-14086]). The accumulation of AtRIBA1 mRNA exceeded the transcript levels of AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 in all organs and developmental stages analyzed. However, the widely parallel accumulation of AtRIBA transcripts does not indicate a strong tissue specificity of gene expression of single members of the AtRIBA gene family. A strong down-regulation of the AtRIBA1 gene expression in the Arabidopsis rfd1 mutant correlated with a bleached phenotype [[b18-ijms-13-14086]]. Seedlings were unable to grow photoautotrophically on soil and their growth was abandoned in sugar-supplemented media after several weeks. Interestingly, the bleaching phenotype of the seedlings is not counterbalanced by the simultaneous AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 expression, which remains at wild-type levels in rfd1[[b17-ijms-13-14086]]. For a gradual reduction of riboflavin biosynthesis, several transgenic lines with AtRIBA1 antisense RNA expression under control of the CaMV 35S promoter were generated ([f3-ijms-13-14086]). RIBA mRNA levels were determined in rosette leaves of two representative AtRIBA antisense lines (A1#2 and A1#5) displaying different degrees of pigment deficiency. While the intensity of the phenotype in the two selected lines correlates with reduced AtRIBA1 transcript levels, AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 are expressed at levels comparable to wild-type tissue ([f2-ijms-13-14086]). Hence, the expression of the latter isoforms does not prevent the deficiency in riboflavin biosynthesis and the decline of AtRIBA1 expression in Arabidopsis was not compensated for at the transcriptional level by modified activity of the homologous genes. The phenotypic alterations of individuals with a severe phenotype, including line A1#2, were compared between three leaf sections. While the leaf base (Sample I in [f3-ijms-13-14086]) was similar to a wild type, a progressive loss of pigmentation was observed towards the leaf tip (samples II and III). In these leaf sections, a gradual reduction of riboflavin ([f3-ijms-13-14086]) was observed. AtRIBA1 protein levels were strongly decreased in A1#2 leaves ([f3-ijms-13-14086]), agreeing with the observed reduction in mRNA amounts. Since all three AtRIBA genes are constantly expressed, the observed AtRIBA1 depletion phenotype of rfd1[[b18-ijms-13-14086]] and the antisense lines depicted in [f3-ijms-13-14086] could be explained by spatial separation of AtRIBA proteins in different subcellular compartments. To address the localization of the three AtRIBA proteins, iPSORT [[b19-ijms-13-14086]], TargetP [[b20-ijms-13-14086]] and Predotar [[b21-ijms-13-14086]] algorithm were used for targeting predictions of their subcellular localization ([f4-ijms-13-14086]). The prediction hinted at the existence of an N-terminal RIBA transit peptide and either a plastidic or mitochondrial localizations. We examined in situ targeting of the three RIBA homologs by CLSM-mediated visualization of transiently expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins after transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Based on predictions by TargetP, three different gene constructs encoding the putative transit peptides of AtRIBA1-3 were fused to 5′-end of the GFP-encoding sequence ([f4-ijms-13-14086]). The co-localization of chlorophyll and GFP fluorescence observed for all three RIBA-GFP fusions ([f4-ijms-13-14086]) clearly demonstrates that all AtRIBA N-termini contain plastid targeting signals. For detailed comparative characterization of AtRIBA enzymes in vitro, all three RIBA-encoding sequences were expressed in E. coli. The design of the artificial RIBA sequences included adaptation to E. coli codon usage and addition of an N-terminal His–tag ([s3-ijms-13-14086]). All RIBA proteins specified by newly generated plasmid constructs lacked the plant-specific N-terminal sequence including the transit peptide. Thus, in comparison to the wild-type protein precursor sequences the recombinant proteins lacked the first 127 (AtRIBA1), 105 (AtRIBA2) or 100 amino acids (AtRIBA3), respectively (cf. alignment in [s1-ijms-13-14086] in [[b17-ijms-13-14086]]). All three over-produced recombinant RIBA proteins were purified by FPLC using metal affinity chromatography. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified recombinant AtRIBA1-3 proteins confirmed the predicted molecular weights of 47.6, 42.3 and 46.5 kDa, respectively ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). The purified AtRIBA proteins were assayed for GCHII and DHBPS activity in vitro ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). A GCHII enzymatic function was clearly demonstrated for RIBA1 as well as for RIBA3, whereas RIBA2 did not display a detectable activity ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). A DHBPS activity was determined for RIBA1 and RIBA2. Here, RIBA3 did not display a measurable DHBPS enzymatic function ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). Taken together, the data obtained from in vitro assays clearly indicate that both recombinant AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 isoforms are able to carry out only one of two enzymatic activities of bifunctional RIBA proteins. In E. coli, ribA and ribB genes encode monofunctional GCHII and DHBPS enzymes, respectively. Corresponding E. coli mutant strains were employed to study complementation of respective enzymatic functions by RIBA1-3 in situ and corroborate the data obtained in vitro. AtRIBA sequences designed for expression in E. coli ([s3-ijms-13-14086]) were cloned into pACYC184 and transformed into E. coli ribA and ribB mutants, respectively. The vector pACYC184 was also used as blank control. We assayed the growth rate (OD600) of resulting E. coli transformants in M9 minimal medium liquid cultures ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). Since ribA and ribB are riboflavin auxotrophs, precultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.4 g/L riboflavin. At OD600 of 0.6, the cells were pelleted, washed and resuspended in M9 minimal medium (OD600 = 0.1) and grown at 37 °C for 24 h. Cultures of both E. coli mutants containing plasmid pACYC184 reached in M9 minimal medium a stationary phase at OD600 of approx. 0.2 ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). Cultures of the ribA mutant (deficiency in GCHII) revealed an enhanced growth rate when transformed with RIBA1 or RIBA3 constructs, while the growth rate of E. coli ribA cells transformed with pACYC-AtRIBA2 did not differ from the blank control strain ([f5-ijms-13-14086]). The culture of the DHBPS-deficient mutant strain ribB displayed an enhanced growth when transformed with either the RIBA1 or RIBA2 encoding plasmid. In contrast, pACYC-AtRIBA3 was not able to improve the growth rate in comparison to the empty control plasmid ([f5-ijms-13-14086]).
!~MM~! The AtRIBA1 coding region was amplified using primers 17 and 18 ([s4-ijms-13-14086]). The product was cut using SmaI and inserted into binary vector pGL1, which was derived from pGPTV-bar [[b30-ijms-13-14086]] by removing GUS and introducing a 35S CaMV promoter and a multiple cloning site. A. thaliana was transformed using standard procedures. Enzymatically essential RIBA regions were identified based on alignments with prokaryotic RibA and RibB ([[b17-ijms-13-14086]], therein [s1-ijms-13-14086]). Arabidopsis sequences were adapted to E. coli codon usage and N-terminal His-tags integrated ([s3-ijms-13-14086]). Sequences were provided as pUC57 subclones by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). NdeI/HindIII fragments were cloned into pET22b(+) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Expression in ArcticExpress™ (DE3) RIL Competent Cells (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 13 °C for 24 h. Soluble recombinant proteins were purified via FPLC using HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and dialyzed with SnakeSkinTM Pleated Dialysis Tubing (10,000 MWCO, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.4. The concentration of recombinant RIBA protein fractions was determined by comparison to Bovine Serum Albumin standards on Coomassie stained gels. The enzyme assays were performed according to [[b31-ijms-13-14086]] with minor modifications. For GCHII activity: Assay mixtures (100 μL) containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 100 μM GTP and either RibA from B. subtilis (0.5 mg/mL) or RIBA1-3 from A. thaliana (0.975, 0.15, 0.175 μg/μL) were incubated 1 h at 37 °C. After addition of EDTA (10 mM) and diacetyl (5 mM), the samples were incubated 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 100 μL of TCA (300 mM) were added and samples centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm and 10 °C. 20 μL from the supernatant were loaded on RP18 column (Lichrospher100 RP18, 5 μL, 250 × 4 mm, flow rate 1 mL min−1) and eluted isocratically with methanol/water (v/v 4:6). Effluent fluorescence of 6,7-dimethylpterin was monitored (λex 340 nm; λem 400 nm). For DHBPS activity: assay mixtures (100 μL) containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 100 μM d-ribose 5-phosphate, phosphoriboisomerase (0.5 U/mL), 100 μM, 5-diamino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H) pyrimidinedione, lumazine synthase of B. subtilis (0.5 U/mL) and either B. subtilis RibA (0.5 mg/mL) or A. thaliana RIBA1-3 (0.975, 0.15, 0.175 μg/μL) were incubated 2 h at 37 °C. 20 μL from the supernatant were loaded on RP18 column and eluted isocratically with methanol/water/formic acid (26:234:1). Effluent fluorescence of 6,7-dimethyl-8- ribityllumazine was monitored (λex 408 nm; λem 490 nm). Synthetic dimethylpterin and 6,7-dimethyl- 8-ribityllumazine have been used as calibration standards. RIBA1 and RIBA3 sequences were cut from pUC57 (see above) with Ecl136II/HincII (RIBA1) or Ecl136II/SmaI (RIBA3). For RIBA2, primers 1 and 2 ([s4-ijms-13-14086]) were applied using RIBA2 in pUC57 as template; the resulting product was cut with PsiI. All RIBA fragments were inserted into the EcoRV site of pACYC184 (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Constructs were transformed into E. coli knock-out strains BSV18 (ribA18::Tn5; CGSC# 6992) and BSV11 (ribB11::Tn5; CGSC# 6991) defective in RibA (GCHII) and RibB (DHBPS), respectively, [[b32-ijms-13-14086]] obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/). For growth assays, LB cultures with 0.4 g/L riboflavin were inoculated with an overnight culture and grown at 37 °C, 250 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6. The mutants require high concentrations of externally added flavins due to the lack of specific riboflavin import mechanisms in E. coli. Cells were pelleted and washed three times in M9 minimal medium containing 20% glucose [[b33-ijms-13-14086]]. M9 cultures containing antibiotics were inoculated with washed cells to give an initial OD600 of 0.1. Total RNA was isolated using innuPREP Plant RNA Kit (Analytic Jena, Jena, Germany). 0.4 μg of DNAseI-pretreated total RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo dT18 using RevertAid RT (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was amplified with SensiMix SYBR No-ROX kit (Bioline, London, UK) on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the oligonucleotides listed in [s4-ijms-13-14086]. Expression rates were calculated relative to SAND (At2g28390 [[b34-ijms-13-14086]]) according to the 2−ΔCT method [[b35-ijms-13-14086],[b36-ijms-13-14086]]. Plant material (0.1 g) harvested from rosette leaves of 8-week-old plants grown under short day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark) at 120 μmole photons m−2 s−1 was ground in liquid N2, resuspended in 0.5 mL of methanol/methylen chloride (9:10), incubated for 2 h under gentle agitation at 4 °C and centrifuged. Samples were analyzed on HPLC system 1100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a NovaPak C18 column (150 mm; 3.9 mm diameter; 4 μm particle size) and eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6) and methanol from 100% to 47% over 20 min at 0.8 mL/min. Riboflavin, FMN and FAD were detected by fluorescence (λex 265 nm, λem 530 nm) and confirmed using authentic standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). N-termini of RIBA proteins were amplified from cDNA using primers 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8 ([s4-ijms-13-14086]). Products were cut by SmaI (RIBA1) or KpnI/SmaI (RIBA2, RIBA3) restrictions and ligated into modified pCF203. [[b37-ijms-13-14086]] Resulting plasmids were transformed into A. tumefaciens pGV2260 and used to infiltrate Nicotiana benthamiana leaves [[b38-ijms-13-14086]]. Transient GFP expression was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (λex 488 nm, GFP λem 500–550 nm, chlorophyll λem 600–700nm). Proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels as described [[b39-ijms-13-14086]]. Immune-detection of AtRIBA used a polyclonal anti-RIBA1 antiserum (Biogenes, Berlin, Germany) which was affinity-purified on nitrocellulose-bound antigen. Immune-detection used HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and a Stella 3200 (raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany).
