!~ABS~! Three new nuclear genes ( sigD , sigE and sigF ) of Arabidopsis thaliana , encoding putative plastid RNA polymerase σ factors, were identified and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that higher plant σ factors fell into at least four distinct subgroups within a diverse protein family. In addition, Arabidopsis sig genes contained conserved chromosomal intron sites, indicating that these genes arose by DNA duplication events during plant evolution. Transcript analyses revealed two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from the sigD region, one of which is predicted to encode a σ protein lacking the carboxy-terminal regions 3 and 4. Finally, the amino-terminal sequence of the sigF gene product was shown to function as a plastid-targeting signal using green fluorescent protein fusions.
!~RES~! We have searched the data available from the Arabidopsis genome project, and found three new σ factor genes. (1) By a BLAST search, a genomic DNA region was obtained on a chromosome V (chr V) P1 clone, MSH12 (GenBank number AB006704 ), which showed similarity to sigB cDNA. (2) By a search on the Kazusa Arabidopsis data base accession site ( http://www.kazusa.or.jp/kaos/ ), an annotated open reading frame (ORF) was found on a chr V P1 clone, MLE8 ( AB010696 ), which was homologous to rpoD1 of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942. (3) By a keyword search for GenBank sequences, another potential gene was found within a chr II BAC, T1J8 ( AC006922 ). For the respective sequences, we predicted ORFs and intron by DNA sequence alignment and splice site prediction (NetPlantGene, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/netpgene/cbsnetpgene.html ). The isolated cDNAs for each gene encode polypeptides homologous to the E. coli σ 70 type-RNA polymerase σ factors, and contain the conserved regions 1.2–4.2, which are required for binding to the core RNA polymerase and recognition of the DNA promoter elements [BIB5 BIB26 BIB27] ( [FIG1] ). We designated them sigD for MSH12, sigE for MLE8, and sigF for T1J8, respectively. We noted that sigD and sigE are identical to the genes SIG4 ( AF101075 ) and sig5 ( Y18550 , discussed in [BIB28] ), and sigF may be identical to the partial sequence ( sig6 ) ( AJ250812 , discussed in [BIB28] ), all genes of which were independently registered by other groups. sigD , sigE and sigF genes were estimated to encode polypeptides of 419, 517 (or 543) and 553 amino acids, corresponding to molecular sizes of 47.2, 58.8 (or 61.6) and 62.5 kDa, respectively. Approximate locations of A. thaliana sig genes on chromosomes are shown in [FIG1] . Since sigE has two potential initiator methionine codons for the amino-terminus of its ORF, there are two possibilities for its calculated molecular weight. Interestingly, we also isolated two cDNA species of sigD , both of which would express a polypeptide translationally interrupted within region 2.4 (see [SEC3.4] ). To understand the relationship among plant σ factors, representative eubacterial group 1 and group 2 σ factors and known plastid σ factors were analyzed phylogenetically. The results showed that higher plant σ factors formed a monophyletic group ( [FIG2] ). However, probably because of lower conservation, branches of plastid and cyanobacterial group 2 σ factors were not clearly separated. Interestingly, many of the higher plant σ factors fell into four subgroups, each including either Arabidopsis SigA, SigB, SigC or SigF. In addition, at least SigA subgroup members were further divided into monocot and dicot groups. Higher plant σ factors appear to be classified into structurally conserved groups beyond plant species. In a comparison of the intron sites of Arabidopsis plastid sig genes, all three in sigD and four out of eight in sigF turned out to be identical to the corresponding intron sites of sigA , sigB and sigC ( [FIG1] ). Especially, intron sites of sigB , sigC and sigF corresponding to the conserved regions through 1.2–4.2 are completely identical. In contrast, none of the sigE intron sites appears to correspond to those in any of the other genes. These observations indicate that gene duplication events from one or a few origins and sequential insertion of intron may have led to multiple sig genes during plant evolution, and that higher plant σ factors may share a common origin(s). Northern blot analyses were performed to detect transcripts of sigD , sigE and sigF using total RNA of 12-day-old seedlings grown under continuous illumination ( [FIG3] ). Only one weak signal was observed for every sig gene. The estimated transcript sizes were 1.4 kb for sigD , 1.6 kb for sigE and 1.7 kb for sigF , and roughly corresponded to the isolated cDNA lengths. Transcript levels for sigD were the lowest among the three genes, whereas transcript levels for sigF were highest. We have isolated another sigD cDNA species that contains a 14-base upstream shift of the intron 2 splice donor site. Since this alternative cDNA species was frequently isolated from the library, we concluded that this transcript was generated by an alternative splicing mechanism. No other splicing pattern was found by RT-PCR analyses (data not shown). The transcript encoded a 29.8-kDa polypeptide lacking the carboxy-terminal region of the full-length sigD product (SigD) by a translational frameshifting. The 29.8-kDa polypeptide (SigD*) contains only 10 extended residues, -L-V-V-C-R-E-A-C-G-S, from the frameshifting site within region 2.4 ( [FIG1] ). Subsequently we investigated plant organ specificity of expression of the two alternatively spliced transcripts by RT-PCR using specific primer sets for each ( [FIG3] ), and both were detected in cotyledons, stems, cauline leaves and rosette leaves. However, relative amounts of the two transcripts appeared to differ in each organ. Although the amino-terminal regions of plastid σ factors revealed limited conservation, they are relatively rich in serine and threonine residues. Nuclear-encoded plastid protein precursors generally contain serine- and threonine-rich amino-terminal extensions that function as plastid-targeting signals [BIB29] . Therefore, we fused GFP [BIB14 BIB22] with the amino-terminal region of SigF, and co-introduced the corresponding constructs into tobacco leaf cells by the particle bombardment method. The fused GFP gene, which was controlled under the CaMV35S promoter, was expressed transiently and localized in chloroplasts, while non-fused GFP was observed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus ( [FIG4] ). Thus the amino-terminus of SigF was shown to function as a plastid-targeting signal. We could not confirm properties of the amino-terminal sequences of SigD and SigE by similar experiments (data not shown).
!~MM~! A. thaliana Columbia was grown on Jiffy-7 (AS Jiffy Products) or Murashige–Skoog agar medium [BIB20] at 22°C under continuous white light [BIB21] . Arabidopsis DNA and RNA were extracted by DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively. P1 clones were provided by Dr. Tabata. cDNAs of sigD , sigE and sigF were amplified by PCR from an Arabidopsis cDNA library [BIB12] . Two overlapping sigD cDNA fragments, one amplified between D4-N2 (5′-)GACCAAAAAGAAGATAGATAAC(-3′) and D4-TP-C TCTCCATGGACTGAATTCCCCATTTCTC, and the other between D4- Nde I CCCACATATGTCAGAAAAGAGAAGGAAGAG and D4- Bam HI GAGGATCCAATTTATTTGCTTTTTATTCAC, a sigE cDNA between D5-TP-N1 TGGGATCCAAGATTGTGATGGGAGTTGTG and D5- Bam HI3′ GGGGATCCAGTTCGGTTCGGTTTGGT, and a sigF cDNA between D6- Sal I CTTGTCGACTTTGGTGATTCTGTGAAATGG and D6- Eco RI TGAATTCAGAAACCAATATCTCCATGAGC, were each cloned into pBluescript vectors (Stratagene). RT-PCR was performed with RT-PCR kit (Toyobo, Japan). 5 μg of total RNA was used for each reaction. Oligonucleotides used were: D4#1-1 (for sigD ) 5′-AATCTAGACTTGTCAAATTGCCGGG, D4#1-2 (for sigD* ) AATCTAGACTTGTCAAATTGCCGCT and D4#2 CTTCAAACGACATAGGAGTCTCTC. To examine the subcellular localization of SigF, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a reporter [BIB14 BIB22] . A cDNA fragment corresponding to the amino-terminal 80 amino acids of SigF was amplified between D6- Sal I and D6- Nco I ACACCATGGATGTTCTATCGTCTCTTA, and introduced into Sal I– Nco I sites of CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-NOS vector [BIB14] (provided by Dr. Niwa) to yield pF-TP-GFP. Sigma factor sequences were obtained from GenBank database and CyanoBase ( http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/ ), and aligned with CLUSTAL W version 1.7 [BIB23] . Amino acid positions of ambiguous alignment were omitted from subsequent phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method [BIB24] with PHYLIP package version 3.5c (J. Felsenstein, University of Washington). Bootstrap analyses for 1000 replicates were performed to provide confidence estimates for tree topologies. The analyzed proteins are as follows: A. thaliana SigA ( D89993 ), SigB ( AB004293 ), SigC ( D89994 ), SigD ( AB021119 ), SigE ( AB021120 ), SigF ( AB029916 ); Sinapis alba Sig1 ( Y15899 ), Sig2 ( AJ276656 ), Sig3 ( AJ276657 ); Nicotiana tabacum SigA1 ( AB023571 ), SigA2 ( AB023572 ); Oryza sativa Os-SigA ( AB005290 ); Triticum aestivum SigA ( AJ132658 ); Zea mays Sig1 ( AF058708 [BIB17] ), Sig2 ( AF058709 [BIB17] ), Sig1 ( AF099110 [BIB19] ), Sig2 ( AF099111 [BIB19] ), Sig3 ( AF099112 [BIB19] ); Sorghum bicolor Sig1 ( Y14276 ); Cyanidium caldarium SigA ( D83179 ), SigB ( AB00679 8), SigC ( AB006799 ); Galdieria sulphuraria RpoD1 ( L42639 ), RpoD2 ( AF050634 ); Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 SigA ( U15574 ); Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 RpoD1 ( D10973 ), RpoD2 ( D78583 ), RpoD3 ( AB024709 ), RpoD4 ( AB024710 ); Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 Slr0653, Sll0306, Sll0184, Sll2012, Sll1689; and Escherichia coli RpoD ( J01687 ). Total RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose RNA gel, blotted onto nylon membrane (positively charged, Boehringer Mannheim), and hybridized with DIG-labelled antisense DNAs which had been prepared by PCR using DIG DNA labeling mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) and primer sets, D4#1-1 and D4#2 for sigD , D5#1 CAACTTCAAACTTCACTCGTGTC and D5#2 TGGATCCGACGATGTATTGACGAAGGTAAT) for sigE , and D6#1 CAAGTAAAGAGGAACTCGCTG and D6- Eco RI) for sigF , or ACT2-1 TAAGGTCGTTGCACCACCTG and ACT2-2 TAACATTGC AAAGAGTTTCAAGGT for act . Each primer set gave a specific DIG-labeled antisense DNA of about 400–500 nucleotides long. Actually no cross-hybridization was observed between any one of six authentic sig gene clones and these probes, except for the homologous combinations. For immunological detection, CSPD (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as a substrate for the chemiluminescence. The membrane filters were exposed to X-ray films (RX-U, Fuji) to obtain autoradiograms. Two plasmids, CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-NOS [BIB14] and pF-TP-GFP, were introduced into tobacco young leaf cells with a particle bombardment device (GIE-III, Tanaka) [BIB25] . Transformed cells were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TSC4D, Leica Microsystems). The fluorescent micrographs were taken with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm for GFP, and at 665 nm for chlorophyll. Incorporated images were processed using Adobe Photoshop.
