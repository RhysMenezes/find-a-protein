!~ABS~! The differentiation of hair (H) and non-hair (N) cells in the Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is dependent on positional relationships with underlying cortical cells. We previously found that histone acetylation relays positional information and that a mutant altered in the histone deacetylase gene family member HISTONE DEACETYLASE 18 (HDA18) exhibits altered H and N epidermal cell patterning. Here, we report that HDA18 has in vitro histone deacetylase activity and that both mutation and overexpression of HDA18 led to cells at the N position having H fate. The HDA18 protein physically interacted with histones related to a specific group of kinase genes, which are demonstrated in this study to be components of a positional information relay system. Both down- and upregulation of HDA18 increased transcription of the targeted kinase genes. Interestingly, the acetylation levels of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), histone 3 lysine 14 (H3K14) and histone 3 lysine 18 (H3K18) at the kinase genes were differentially affected by down- or upregulation of HDA18, which explains why the transcription levels of the four HDA18-target kinase genes increased in all lines with altered HDA18 expression. Our results reveal the surprisingly complex mechanism by which HDA18 affects cellular patterning in Arabidopsis root epidermis.
!~RES~! HDA18 is located on chromosome 5. The genomic sequence contains 3202 bp, and the coding sequence contains 2049 bp, including eight exons. Analysis of data at AREX (CITATION; CITATION; http://www.arexdb.org) indicated that HDA18 is expressed at low levels, with no tissue preference. These results are consistent with previous in situ hybridization observations (CITATION). Because of the similarity between the hda18 mutant phenotype and the effects of the HDAC inhibitor TSA on cellular patterning of the root epidermis, we tested recombinant HDA18 protein for HDAC activity. The recombinant protein had significant HDAC activity, which was concentration dependent and inhibited by TSA (Figures 1B and 1C; for detailed data, see Supplemental Figure 1 online). An in-gel assay, using hyperacetylated histones extracted from HeLa cells as substrates and commercially available histone-specific (but site nonspecific) antibodies as indicators, revealed that the recombinant protein deacetylated all four core histones (Figure 1C), suggesting that the HDAC domain of HDA18 does not have preferential activity on any of the core histones. Transient expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)–labeled HDA18 (see Supplemental Figure 2 online) in onion (Allium cepa) epidermis revealed that the HDA18 protein was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 1D), which is consistent with bioinformatic predictions (CITATION). This result was further verified by observation of EGFP localization in stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines containing the same construct for EGFP-labeled HDA18 (Figure 1E; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). To understand further the role of HDA18 in cellular patterning, we analyzed the phenotypes of a T-DNA insertion mutant (hda18-2), an RNA interference (RNAi) line (HDA18 RNAi), an overexpression (OE) line driven by the 35S promoter P35S:HDA18 (HDA18 OE/35S), and an OE line driven by the promoter of the WEREWOLF gene PWER:HDA18-GUS (HDA18 OE/WER; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The hda18-2 mutant and HDA18 RNAi line exhibited conversion of some cells at N positions to H fate, similar to the previously described hda18-1 mutant line (Salk_006938) (CITATION). Unexpectedly, however, the two HDA18 OE lines also displayed this phenotype (Figure 2A). The number of cells at N positions that were converted to H fate significantly increased in both mutants and overexpressing lines based on statistics analysis compared with wild-type plants (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Introduction of an N cell–specific reporter, the GL2 promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in the hda18-2 mutant, enabled us to identify cell fate patterns (Figure 2B, asterisk; see Supplemental Figure 3 online), further indicating the conversion of cells at the N position to H fate. [[FIGURE]] We attempted to rescue the mutant phenotype by complementation. However, possibly because of the low native expression level of HDA18, all transgenic lines were found to overexpress the gene and thus exhibited the corresponding phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 1 online). To test whether the effect of HDA18 could be enhanced by HDA5 and HDA15, single mutants that do not have altered cellular patterning in the root epidermis (CITATION), we introduced artificial microRNA constructs targeting HDA5 and HDA15 into the hda18-2 mutant. We also introduced artificial microRNA constructs targeting HDA5 and HDA18 into the hda15 mutant (Salk_004027). No enhanced phenotypes were observed in transgenic lines in which all three targeted genes were downregulated (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). These results suggest that the role of HDA18 in the production of the mutant phenotype is independent of HDA5 and HDA15, its two most closely related members of the Class II RPD3/HDA1 subfamily (CITATION). To test whether altered HDA18 expression affected the GL2-centered TFN, we examined the expression of five representative pattern genes (CPC, WER, GL2, TTG, and GL3) and related genes (EGL3, GEM, and SCM) in hda18-2, HDA18 RNAi, and HDA18 OE/35S. We did not further analyze hda18-1 or HDA18 OE/WER lines at the molecular level because the former is a weak allele and the latter has a similar phenotype to the HDA18 OE/35S line, with no obvious differential expression of HDA18 in the H and N position (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). We found that the expression of CPC was significantly downregulated in all three lines (Figure 3A). Expressions of TTG and GL3 were upregulated in the mutant line, while those of WER GL2, EGL3, GEM, and SCM were not changed significantly (Figure 3A). These results reveal that the pattern of gene expression was affected differentially by altered levels of HDA18 expression. [[FIGURE]] We previously determined that the histone acetylation status of pattern genes was altered upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor TSA (CITATION), and we confirmed here that HDA18 has in vitro HDAC activity. We therefore examined whether HDA18 expression affects the histone acetylation status of pattern genes. Using the previously identified DNA fragments that displayed altered levels of histone acetylation in response to TSA treatment (CITATION), we found that upon down- or upregulation of HDA18 expression, the acetylation levels of H3 and H4 increased to some extent in three representative pattern genes, CPC, WER, and GL2. The increases in acetylation of H3 at CPC and WER were statistically significant (P < 0.05) in the HDA18 RNAi line, while those of H3 and H4 at GL2 were statistically significant (P < 0.05) in hda18-2 and HDA18 OE/35S lines (Figures 3B and 3C). These data reveal that although the downregulation of HDA18 indeed increased histone acetylation, consistent with the previously observed TSA effects, the increased histone acetylation status of the HDA18 OE/35S line could not be directly explained by HDA18 functioning as an HDAC. To clarify further if HDA18 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of pattern genes, we examined whether the HDA18 protein directly binds to chromatin, thus altering pattern gene–related histone acetylation, using an antibody against HDA18 (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). Surprisingly, none of the DNA fragments tested were enriched in this chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment (Figure 3D). Because the primers used in the ChIP-PCR assay covered only limited areas of chromatin, we performed a ChIP-chip screen to search for possible binding sites at the genome level (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). Among the 286 enriched DNA fragments (representing putative HDA18 protein binding sites), none was related to any of the pattern genes (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). Taken together, we conclude that although altered HDA18 expression affects the cellular patterning of the root epidermis, this effect does not appear to be due to the direct transcriptional regulation of pattern genes. As HDA18 did not directly regulate the expression of pattern genes, we explored how altered expression of HDA18 was linked to cellular patterning. We searched among the 286 DNA fragments identified in the HDA18 ChIP-chip experiment for genes with annotated functions potentially related to cellular patterning of the root epidermis and found that 13 of these fragments encoded kinases, in addition to nine encoding transcription factors, eight encoding chromatin modification factors, four functioning in root development, and one encoding a phosphatase (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). These data suggest that HDA18 can directly bind to genes, as is common for HDAC proteins, and may affect cellular patterning via these target genes. Because both SCM and BRI1 are plasma membrane–localized receptor-like kinases, we reasoned that there must be some downstream components that transduce the positional information sensed by the receptors. The preferential enrichment of kinase genes in the HDA18 ChIP-chip data suggested that HDA18 might function in the relay of positional information by regulating the transcription of these kinase genes. To test this possibility, we first verified that HDA18 binds to the 20 candidate DNA fragments, including all 13 putative kinase genes, by performing ChIP-PCR. We found that 15 candidates were enriched, whereas five were not (Figure 4A). [[FIGURE]] To examine whether HDA18 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the targeted genes, we examined the expression of the verified HDA18-bound genes in hda18-2, HDA18 OE/35S, and TSA-treated wild-type plants. Among the 15 genes that were tested, two showed changes in expression that were correlated with HDA18 expression level (At1G19485 and At1G79000), five showed upregulation to various extents regardless of HDA18 expression levels in all lines (At3G27560, At4G26270, At4G31170, At4G31230, and At5G49470), and the remaining eight showed no significant changes in their expression levels that could be correlated with HDA18 expression (Figure 4B). We then analyzed the mutant phenotypes of all 15 HDA18-targeted genes (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). We found that mutations in eight of the 15 genes led to the conversion of some cells at the N position to H fate (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 online). Among these eight genes, six were kinases, one was a WD-40 gene, and one was a basic HELIX-LOOP-HELIX (bHLH) gene (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). Mutations in At5G49470 and At5G58520, both bound by HDA18 and annotated as kinase genes, did not induce cell fate conversion phenotypes in the root (see Supplemental Data Set 1 and Supplemental Table 3 online), indicating that these HDA18-targeted genes may either not be involved in the patterning process or may be involved in a redundant manner. [[FIGURE]] Although mutations of At1G18890 and At5G53890 produced the cellular patterning phenotype, the transcription levels of these genes were not significantly affected by that of HDA18. We therefore focused our further investigations on the remaining kinase genes (i.e., At3G27560, At4G26270, At4G31170, and At4G31230). First, we verified the phenotype by introducing the cell type–specific reporter PGL2:GFP into the corresponding mutants. We found that GFP expression patterns were altered in the kinase mutants (Figure 5B; see Supplemental Figure 6 online), consistent with the phenotypes revealed by paraffin sectioning (Figure 5A). We next examined the histone acetylation status of the four kinase genes in hda18-2, HDA18 RNAi, and HDA18 OE/35S at the verified HDA18 binding sites. The levels of H3 acetylation were significantly increased at At4G26270 in all three lines, at At4G31170 in HDA18 RNAi and HDA18 OE/35S, and at At4G31230 in hda18-2 and HDA18 RNAi (Figure 4C). H4 acetylation was significantly increased at At3G27560 in HDA18 RNAi and HDA18 OE/35S (Figure 4D). Taken together, these data indicate that HDA18 binds to and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of some genes, including At3G27560, At4G26270, At4G31170, and At4G31230. We next explored how the cell conversion phenotype could result from both the upregulation of target kinase genes (caused by altered HDA18 expression) and the downregulation of these same genes (caused by the loss-of-function mutations). We chose the straightforward approach of constructing OE transgenic lines for these kinase genes to determine whether increased expression of these genes might produce a similar phenotype as loss-of-function mutations. OE lines for each of the four HDA18-targeted kinase genes, At3G27560, At4G26270, At4G31170, and At4G31230 (see Supplemental Figure 6 and Supplemental Table 3 online), indeed caused some cells at the N position to convert to H fate (Figure 5). These results demonstrate that both down- and upregulation of kinase gene expression could result in this phenotype, indicating that homeostasis of expression of the kinase genes is required for cellular patterning in the Arabidopsis root epidermis and implicating these kinase genes as components relaying positional information during this process. It is intriguing that both the down- and upregulation of HDA18 resulted in the cell conversion phenotype (Figure 2A). To address the underlying mechanisms of this, we examined the efficiency of enrichment of the HDA18 protein on the kinase genes. Figure 6B shows that as expected, the enrichment of HDA18 protein on the DNA of all four kinase genes was significantly reduced in the lines with reduced expression of the HDA18 gene. However, unexpectedly, the HDA18 enrichment level was similar to that of the wild type in the lines with increased HDA18 expression. These observations suggest that the phenotype of the upregulated HDA18 expression lines cannot simply be explained by decreased target binding by the HDA18 protein. [[FIGURE]] Next, we analyzed the histone acetylation status of specific amino acid residues in the lines with altered HDA18 expression. As indicated in Figure 4, the overall histone acetylation at the kinase genes increased to various levels. As more significantly increased acetylation levels were observed in H3 than in H4, we chose H3 for further analysis. Among the seven known Lys residues available for acetylation in the H3 N-terminal tail, acetylated Lys-9, Lys-14, Lys-18, and Lys-23 are responsible for promoting transcription (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we examined the acetylation levels at Lys-9, Lys-14, Lys-18, and Lys-23 of H3 at the four kinase genes in the hda18-2 mutant, the RNAi line (HDA18 RNAi), and the OE line (HDA18 OE/35S). Figures 6C to 6F show that although there were some variations, the acetylation levels at the H3 Lys residues changed in similar patterns: Except for At4G31230, the acetylation levels of H3K9 at the kinase genes were significantly enhanced under reduced levels of HDA18 but were not significantly changed with increased HDA18 expression (Figure 6C). The acetylation levels of H3K14 in all four kinase genes were significantly enhanced under both reduced and increased HDA18 levels (Figure 6D). In contrast with H3K9, the acetylation levels of H3K18 in all four kinase genes were significantly enhanced under increased HDA18 levels but not under decreased HDA18 levels, except in At4G31170 (Figure 6E). The H3K23 acetylation levels were all enhanced to some extent whether HDA18 was down- or upregulated (Figure 6F). The above data suggest that the down- and upregulation of HDA18 expression (i.e., the reduced or increased levels of HDA18 protein) affect the acetylation of the four detected H3 Lys residues differentially.
!~MM~! All Arabidopsis thaliana kinase mutant seeds were obtained from the ABRC and are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. SALK mutant line CS847004 is designated as hda18-2 herein, whereas hda18-1 represents the previously described SALK_006938 mutant line (CITATION). The PGL2:GFP marker line was described previously (CITATION). Plants were grown under the same conditions described previously (CITATION). A recombinant HDA18 protein was constructed with the HDAC domain of the HDA18 sequence at the C terminus and a maltose binding protein tag at the N terminus (see Supplemental Figures 5 and 9 online). The in vitro HDAC activity assays were conducted according to CITATION and CITATION. TSA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog number T8552). HDA18 OE construct was produced by cloning HDA18 coding sequence into pCAMBIA binary vector, driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S) (HDA18 OE/35S) or 4-kb WER promoter fragment (CITATION; CITATION) (HDA18 OE/WER). HDA18 RNAi silencing was performed by cloning HDA18 coding region 1294 to 2026 into pCAMBIA vector in antisense/sense directions, respectively, to generate small hairpin RNA under the CaMV35S promoter. For HDA18 localization study, the HDA18 coding sequence was placed under the CaMV35S promoter and fused to 5′ and 3′ end of EGFP, respectively, to generate P35S:HDA18-EGFP and P35S:EGFP-HDA18 construct. In addition, the HDA18 promoter region, containing 529 bp 5′ upstream, 1st exon, and 1st intron, was cloned and placed before the EGFP coding region. To rescue HDA18 depletion, 3.8-kb genomic fragment from HDA18 was cloned into pDR vector and then transformed into hda18 (SALK_006938). For kinase OE analysis, kinase coding sequence was cloned into pDR binary vector, driven by the CaMV35S promoter or kinase genomic fragment from At3G27560 was cloned into pDR vector. All the primer pairs for plasmids construction are listed in Supplemental Data Set 2 online. Binary plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens stain GV3101 and transformed into plants using the floral dip method (CITATION). T1 seeds were harvested and screened by germinating on Murashige and Skoog solid medium with antibiotic or herbicide selection. The resistant seedlings were replanted on wet soil and verified by PCR to detect T-DNA insertion and gene expression. Thermal asymmetric interlaced–PCR was performed to identify T-DNA insertion location in selfed transgenic plants (CITATION). To ensure that the phenotypes of the transgenic plants did not result from the interruption of other genes due to T-DNA insertion, we examined the insertion sites of our transgenic plants (see Supplemental Table 5 online). After verification, seeds collected from T1 plants were cultivated and processed to paraffin section phenotype inspection and other experiments. Transient expression of HDA18 for subcellular localization in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells was conducted according to CITATION with a Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He biolistic particle delivery system and observed with a Leica TCS-SP confocal microsystem. Introduction of the PGL2:GFP marker to the hda18-2 and mutants of kinase genes was achieved by crossing (see Supplemental Figures 3 and 6 online). Design of artificial microRNAs was according to WMD3-Web MicroRNA Designer (http://wmd3.weigelworld.org) (CITATION). Epidermal cellular patterns were observed according to CITATION for paraffin sectioning and to CITATION for confocal microscopy. Examination of expression levels in root tips of plants with various genetic backgrounds was conducted with real-time PCR according to CITATION. ChIP was also conducted according to CITATION. The HDA18 antibody was raised in mouse (for detailed information, see Supplemental Figure 5 and Supplemental Table 6 online). Antibodies used for examining histone acetylation status by ChIP are listed in Supplemental Table 7 online. Primers used are listed in Supplemental Data Set 2 online. DNA fragments enriched by the HDA18 antibody were prepared as above. Hybridization of enriched DNA fragments with the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R array (catalog number AFFY-900594) was conducted by Beijing Capital Bio Corporation. Microarray data were analyzed by tiling analysis software supplied by Affymetrix. The final processed data are listed in Supplemental Data Set 1 online.
