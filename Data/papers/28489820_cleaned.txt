!~ABS~! Nutrient signalling integrates and coordinates gene expression, metabolism and growth. However, its primary molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood in plants and animals. Here we report unique Ca2+ signalling triggered by nitrate with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in Arabidopsis leaves and roots. A nitrate-sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen identifies subgroup III Ca2+-sensor protein kinases (CPKs) as master regulators that orchestrate primary nitrate responses. A chemical switch with the engineered mutant CPK10(M141G) circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional analyses of cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants to define comprehensive nitrate-associated regulatory and developmental programs. Nitrate-coupled CPK signalling phosphorylates conserved NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors to specify the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription factors, transporters, nitrogen assimilation, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, redox, signalling, hormones and proliferation. Conditional cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 and nlp7 mutants similarly impair nitrate-stimulated system-wide shoot growth and root establishment. The nutrient-coupled Ca2+ signalling network integrates transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot–root coordination and developmental plasticity in shaping organ biomass and architecture.
!~RES~! Nitrate is the primary nitrogen source for most plants and the limiting factor for growth in aerobic soil (CITATION) . Nitrate rapidly stimulates integrated nutrient transport and assimilation, as well as carbon/nitrogen metabolic and regulatory pathways that enable plant growth plasticity to respond and adapt to fluctuating environments. Genetic and genomic evidence suggest that nitrate drives rapid transcriptional regulation and that nitrate signalling is uncoupled from nitrate metabolism (CITATION) . Regulatory components in nitrate sensing and signalling, such as the NRT1.1 (also known as NPF6.3, CHL1 and NRG1) transceptor and associated calcineurin-B-like-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) and protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C, also known as ABI2), as well as nitrate-responsive cis-elements (NREs) and transcription factors, have been identified by molecular, genetic, genomic and systems analyses (CITATION) . Notably, Arabidopsis NLP6 and NLP7 have been implicated as key transcription factors of primary nitrate responses (CITATION) . Despite these advances, the molecular mechanism underlying primary nitrate signalling downstream of multiple sensors to integrated transcription, transport, metabolism and systemic growth programs (Fig. 1a) remains unclear (CITATION) . [[FIGURE]] Ca2+ is an evolutionarily conserved and versatile signalling modulator in diverse regulatory pathways, such as stress, immune and neuron signalling (CITATION) . Although a role for Ca2+ signalling in nitrate-responsive gene regulation has been implicated in maize leaves and Arabidopsis roots (CITATION) , many outstanding questions remain in both plants and animals, such as whether distinct Ca2+ signatures are involved in primary nutrient signalling with cell specificity, the specific patterns of Ca2+ dynamics, the identity of intracellular Ca2+ sensors, how Ca2+ sensors relay signalling specificity, and the downstream targets of Ca2+ signalling in the nutrient–growth regulatory networks.
!~MM~! The 1.3-kb GCaMP6 coding region was PCR amplified from the pGP-CMV-GCaMP6s plasmid (Addgene) (CITATION) . The amplified DNA was then inserted into the plant expression vector (the HBT-HA-NOS plasmid) (CITATION) to generate the HBT-GCaMP6-HA construct. The HBT-GCaMP6-HA construct was inserted into the binary vector pCB302 (ref. 46) to generate the HBT-GCaMP6-HA transgenic plants using the Agrobacterium (GV3101)-mediated floral-dip method (CITATION) . Transgenic plants were selected by spraying with the herbicide BASTA. The construct expressing HY5–mCherry was used as a control for protoplast co-transfection and nucleus labelling, and was obtained from J.-G. Chen (CITATION) . NLS-Td-Tomato was used as a control for protoplast co-transfection and nucleus labelling, and was obtained from X. Liu. NIR-LUC was constructed as described previously (CITATION) . UBQ10-GUS is a control for protoplast co-transfection and internal control; all HBT-CPKac-Flag-NOS expression plasmids have been described previously (CITATION) . To construct HBT-CPK-GFP-NOS, the coding regions of the CPK10, CPK30 and CPK32 cDNA were amplified and then cloned into the HBT-GFP-NOS plasmid (CITATION) . HBT-CPK10(M141G)-Flag was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the HBT-CPK10-Flag construct. To complement the cpk10 cpk30/+ mutant, a 5.5-kb DNA fragment including the promoter region (3 kb) and the coding region of CPK10 was amplified from genomic DNA, which was then cloned into the plasmid HBT-HA-NOS and mutagenized to generate pCPK10-CPK10(M141G)-HA-NOS. The pCPK10-CPK10(M141G)-HA-NOS construct was inserted into pCB302 and transformed into cpk10 cpk30/+ mutant plants using the Agrobacterium (GV3101)-mediated floral-dip method (CITATION) . At the T3 generation, homozygous single-copy insertion lines were screened for the cpk10 cpk30 double mutant carrying pCPK10-CPK10(M141G)-HA-NOS to obtain the 3MBiP-inducible icpk10,30 double mutant, which rescued the embryo lethality of the cpk10 cpk30 double mutant. The 3MBiP-inducible icpk10,30,32 triple mutant expressing CPK10(M141G)-HA (designated icpk) was generated by genetic cross to cpk32 and confirmed by molecular analyses. To construct 35SΩ-NLP6-MYC or 35SΩ-NLP7-MYC in the pCB302 binary plasmid with hygromycin B selection, the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in the 35SΩ-GUS plasmid (CITATION) was replaced with the DNA fragment encoding the full-length NLP6 or NLP7 fused to 6 copies of the MYC epitope tag in the HBT-NLP6-MYC or HBT-NLP7-MYC plasmid (CITATION) . The NLP6-MYC and NLP7-MYC transgenic plants were generated by Agrobacterium (GV3101)-mediated transformation by floral dip and hygromycin B resistance selection. To construct HBT-NLP7-HA and HBT-NLP7-GFP, the 2.9 kb coding region of the NLP7 cDNA was amplified and then cloned into the HBT-NOS plasmid. HBT-NLP7(S205A)-HA and HBT-NLP7(S205A)-GFP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. A 7.9-kb genomic DNA fragment of NLP7 was cloned into the pUC plasmid and fused with GFP at the C terminus to generate pNLP7-NLP7-GFP. The pNLP7-NLP7(S205A)-GFP construct was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. pNLP7-NLP7-GFP or pNLP7-NLP7(S205A)-GFP was then inserted into pCB302 and introduced into nlp7-1 mutant plants using the Agrobacterium (GV3101)-mediated floral-dip (CITATION) method for complementation analyses. To construct UBQ10-CPK10KM-YN and UBQ10-NLP7-YC, the coding regions of CPK10(KM), NLP7, YFP-N terminus and YFP-C terminus were amplified by PCR and cloned into the UBQ10-GUS plasmid. To construct pET14-NLP7-N(1-581)-HIS and pET14-NLP7-N(S205A)-HIS for protein expression, the N-terminal coding region of NLP7 and NLP7(S205A) were amplified from HBT-NLP7-HA and HBT-NLP7(S205A)-HA. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The primers used for plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as the wild type. The cpk mutants were obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre (ABRC) (CITATION) . Homozygous T-DNA lines were identified using CPK gene-specific primers and T-DNA left-border primers. The gene-specific primers used are listed in the Supplementary Table 4. Double mutants were obtained by genetic crosses between cpk10-1, cpk30-1 and cpk32-1, and confirmed by PCR. For RT–PCR analysis of cpk single mutants, around 30 plants were grown on the Petri dish (150 mm × 15 mm) containing 100 ml of 1/2 × MS medium salt, 0.1% MES, 0.5% sucrose, 0.7% phytoagar under constant light (150 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C for 7 days. Samples were collected for RT–PCR analysis. To generate icpk, cpk32-1 was crossed to icpk10,30. F2 plants were first screened for resistance to BASTA and then confirmed by genotyping (primers listed in Supplementary Table 4) for the homozygous cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants. The homozygous icpk plants were isolated with no segregation for BASTA resistance in F3 plants. To demonstrate embryo lethality in cpk10 cpk30 mutants, cpk10 cpk30/+ plants were grown at a photoperiod of 16 h (light)/8 h (dark) (100 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C/20 °C. Siliques were opened using forceps and needles under a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ 16F). Images were acquired and processed using IM software and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe). To obtain nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts, around 16–20 plants were grown on a Petri dish (150 mm × 15 mm) containing 100 ml of nitrogen-free 1 × MS medium salt, 0.1% MES, 1% sucrose, 0.7% phytoagar, 2.5 mM ammonium succinate and 0.5 mM glutamine, pH 6 under a photoperiod of 12 h (light)/12 h (dark) (75 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C/20 °C for 23–28 days. Mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from the second and the third pair of true leaves following the mesophyll protoplast isolation protocol (CITATION) . To monitor plant growth without exogenous nitrogen source after germination, 30 seedlings were germinated and grown on a basal medium (CITATION) (10 mM KH2PO4/KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM FeSO4-EDTA, 50 μM H3BO4, 12 μM MnSO4·H2O, 1 μM ZnCl2, 1 μM CuSO4·5H2O, 0.2 μM Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.1% MES and 0.5% sucrose, pH 5.8) with 1% phytoagar under constant light (150 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C for 4 days. Photos were taken at different days (days 1–4) using a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ 16F) with IM software. To analyse the specific plant growth programs in response to different exogenous nitrogen sources at different concentrations, seedlings were germinated and grown on basal medium for 4 days as described above, and then transferred to the basal medium with 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 or 10 mM KNO3, NH4Cl, glutamine or KCl for an additional 1–7 days. For gene expression analyses with RT–qPCR and RNA-seq, 10 seedlings were germinated in one well of the 6-well tissue culture plate (Falcon) with 1 ml of the basal medium supplemented with 2.5 mM ammonium succinate as the sole nitrogen source. Plates were sealed with parafilm and placed on the shaker at 70 r.p.m. under constant light (45 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C for 7 days. Before nitrate induction, seedlings were washed three times with 1 ml basal medium. Seedlings were treated in 1 ml of basal medium with KCl or KNO3 for 15 min. Seedlings were then harvested for RNA extraction with TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To block the kinase activity of CPK10(M141G), seedlings were pre-treated with 10 μM 3MBiP in the basal medium for 2 min, and then treated with KCl or KNO3 for 15 min. For Ca2+ channel blockers and Ca2+ sensor inhibitors assays, seedlings were pre-treated with 2 mM LaCl3, 2 mM GdCl3, 250 μM W5 or 250 μM W7 in 1 ml of basal medium for 20 min, and then induced by 0.5 mM KCl or KNO3 for 15 min. To monitor root morphology, seedlings were germinated and grown on a basal medium supplemented with 2.5 mM ammonium succinate and 1% phytoagar under constant light (150 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C for 3 days. Plants were then transferred to the basal medium supplemented with 1 μM 3MBiP and 5 mM KNO3, 2.5 mM ammonium succinate, 5 mM KCl or 1 mM glutamine and grown for 5–8 days. After seedling transfer, 1 ml of 1 μM 3MBiP was added to the medium every 2 days. To monitor lateral root developmental stages, seedlings were monitored using a microscope (Leica DM5000B) with a 20× objective lens according to the protocol described previously (CITATION) . To measure the primary and lateral root length, pictures were taken using a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ 16 F) with IM software and analysed by ImageJ. To compare the shoot phenotype, 8-day-old seedlings were cut above the root–shoot junction to measure the shoot fresh weight and acquire images. To analyse the cpk single-mutant phenotype, plants were germinated and grown on ammonium succinate medium for 3 days and then transferred to basal medium plates supplemented with 5 mM KNO3 for 6 days. To analyse double mutants in response to 3MBiP, plants were transferred to basal medium plates supplemented with 5 mM KNO3 and 1 μM 3MBiP for 6 days, and 3MBiP was reapplied every 2 days. Individual 9-day-old seedlings (n = 12) were collected to measure fresh weight and acquire images. To characterize the shoot phenotype of nlp7-1 and the complementation lines, around 20 seeds were germinated on the Petri dish (150 mm × 15 mm) containing 100 ml of nitrogen-free 1 × MS medium salt (Caisson), 0.1% MES, 1% sucrose, 0.7% phytoagar and 25 mM KNO3 medium pH 5.8 under a 16 h (light)/8 h (dark) photoperiod (100 μmol m−2 s−1) at 18 °C and grown for 21 days. The shoots were collected for measurement of fresh weight and acquisition of images. For analyses of the shoot phenotype in icpk, seeds were germinated and grown on the ammonium succinate basal medium plate for 3 days and then transferred to the same medium supplemented with 1 μM 3MBiP. The inhibitor 3MBiP (5 ml of 1 μM) was reapplied on the medium twice during the growth. Two transgenic seedlings expressing apoaequorin (CITATION) were germinated and grown in one well of a 12-well tissue culture plate (Falcon) with 0.5 ml of the basal medium supplemented with 2.5 mM ammonium succinate for 6 days. Individual plants were transferred to a luminometer cuvette filled with 100 μl of the reconstitution buffer (2 mM MES pH 5.7, 10 mM CaCl2, and 10 μM native coelenterazine from NanoLight Technology) and incubated at room temperature in the dark overnight. The emission of photons was detected every second using the luminometer BD Monolight 3010. The measurement was initiated by injection of 100 μl 20 mM KCl, 20 mM KNO3, 200 nM flg22 or ultrapure water into the cuvettes. Luminescence values were exported and processed using Microsoft Excel software. For Ca2+ imaging in protoplasts, mesophyll protoplasts (2 × 105) in 1 ml buffer were co-transfected with 70 μg HBT-GCaMP6 and 50 μg HBT-HY5-mCherry plasmid DNA. Transfected protoplasts were incubated in 5 ml of WI buffer (CITATION) for 4 h. Before time-lapse recording, a coverslip was placed on a 10-well chamber slide covering three-quarters of a well, and placed on the microscope stage. Mesophyll protoplasts co-expressing GCaMP6 and HY5–mCherry (2 × 104 protoplast cells) were spun down for 1 min at 100g. WI-Ca2+ buffer (WI buffer plus 4 mM CaCl2) (0.5 μl) with different stimuli (40 mM KCl, 40 mM KNO3 or 40 mM NH4Cl) or 80 mM Ca2+ chelator (EGTA) were added into 1.5 μl of concentrated mesophyll protoplasts in WI buffer. The final concentration of each stimulus was 10 mM KCl, 10 mM KNO3, 10 mM NH4Cl or 20 mM EGTA in the solution. The stimulated protoplasts were immediately loaded onto the slide and imaged via the Leica AF software on a Leica DM5000B microscope with the 20× objective lens. The exposure time for GCaMP6 was set at 1 s and recorded every 2 s to generate 199 frames. The exposure time was set at 45 ms for the bright field and 1 s for the mCherry signal. The fluorescence intensity was determined with the region of interest (ROI) function for each protoplast. The intensity data were exported and processed using Microsoft Excel software. The images were exported and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. To make a video, individual images were cropped using Adobe Photoshop software and saved in JPEG format. The videos were generated using ImageJ with the cropped images. For Ca2+ imaging with the GCaMP6 transgenic seedling cotyledons, 5 seedlings were germinated in 1 well of a 6-well tissue culture plate (Falcon) with 1 ml of the basal medium supplemented with 2.5 mM ammonium succinate for 7 days. A chamber was made on microscope slides between two strips of the invisible tape (0.5 cm × 3 cm) and filled with 150 μl of the basal medium. A cotyledon of the 7-day-old seedling was cut in half using a razor blade and embedded in the medium. A thin layer of cotton was placed on top of the cotyledon to prevent moving. The coverslip was placed on the sample and fixed by another two strips of the invisible tape. The cotyledon was allowed to recover on the slide for 10 min. Confocal imaging was acquired using the Leica laser scanning confocal system (Leica TCS NT confocal microscope, SP1). The mesophyll cells in the cotyledon were targeted for Ca2+ imaging at the focal point. Basal medium (200 μl) with 10 mM KCl, 10 mM KNO3 or 20 mM EGTA was loaded along one edge of the coverslip. A Kimwipes tissue on the opposite edge was used to draw the buffer into the chamber. To record fluorescence images, the excitation was provided at 488 nm and images were collected at emission 515–550 nm. The scanning resolution was set at 1,024 × 1,024 pixels. Images were captured every 10 s and averaged from two frames. In total, 80 images were collected and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. A video was generated with collected images using the method described above. For Ca2+ imaging with the GCaMP6 transgenic seedling at the root tip and the elongated region of roots (around the middle region of the root), 10 seedlings were germinated and grown on the tissue culture plate (Falcon) with the basal medium and 1% phytoagar under constant light (150 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C for 4 days. The images were obtained using Leica laser scanning confocal system as described above for cotyledon Ca2+ imaging. In total, 33 images were collected and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. A video was generated with collected images using the method described above. Time-course, specificity and dosage analyses of NIR-LUC activity in response to nitrate induction was carried out in mesophyll protoplasts (2 × 104 protoplasts in 100 μl) co-transfected with 10 μg NIR-LUC and 2 μg UBQ10-GUS (as the internal control) and incubated in WI buffer (CITATION) for 4 h, and then induced by 0.5 mM KCl, KNO3, NH4+ or Gln or different concentrations of KNO3 for 2 h. For time-course analysis, the fold change is calculated relative to the value of KCl treatment at each time point. For the nitrate-sensitized functional genomic screen, nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts (2 × 104 protoplasts in 100 μl) were co-transfected with 8 μg HBT-CPKac (constitutively active CPK) or a control vector, 10 μg NIR-LUC and 2 μg UBQ10-GUS plasmid DNA, and incubated for 4 h to allow CPKac protein expression. To investigate the functional relationship between CPK10ac and NLP7 in nitrate signalling, nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts (4 × 104 protoplasts in 200 μl) were co-transfected with 8 μg NIR-LUC and 2 μg UBQ10-GUS plasmid DNA, as well as 5 μg HBT-CPK10ac, HBT-CPK10ac(KM) or a control vector, or HBT-NLP7 or HBT-NLP7(S205A) in different combinations supplemented with 5 μg control vector to reach a total of 20 μg per transfection reaction, and incubated for 4 h for protein expression. Protoplasts were then induced with 0.5 mM KCl or KNO3 for 2 h. The luciferase and GUS assay were carried out as described before (CITATION) . The expression levels of NLP7–HA and CPK–Flag or CPK10ac–Flag in protoplasts were monitored by immunoblot with anti-HA-peroxidase (Roche, 11667475001; 1:2,000) and anti-Flag-HRP (Sigma, A8592; 1:2,000) antibodies, respectively. Expression vectors were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS Competent Cells (Novagen). Cells were induced by 1 mM of IPTG when OD600 nm reached 0.6, and proteins were expressed at 18 °C for 18 h. Affinity purification was carried out using HisTrap columns (GE Healthcare) and the ÄKTA FPLC system. Purified proteins were buffer exchanged into PBS using PD-10 Desalting Columns (GE Healthcare), and then concentrated by Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (EMD Millipore). Around 106 protoplasts were incubated in WI buffer (5 ml) in Petri dishes (9 × 9 cm) for 4 h before induction with 10 mM KCl or KNO3 for 10 min. Protoplasts were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete mini, Roche) and 1 mM DTT. The protein extract supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 18,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total proteins (20 μg) were loaded on 8% SDS–PAGE embedded with or without 0.5 mg ml−1 histone type III-S (Sigma) as a general CPK phosphorylation substrate (CITATION) . The gel was washed three times with washing buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mg ml−1 BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100), and incubated for 20 h with three changes in the renaturation buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM NaF and 0.1 mM Na3VO4) at 4 °C. The gel was then incubated in the reaction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 12 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM Na3VO4) with or without 20 mM EGTA at room temperature for 30 min. The kinase reaction was performed for 1 h in the reaction buffer supplemented with 25 μM cold ATP and 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP with or without 20 mM EGTA. The reaction was stopped by extensive washes in the washing buffer (5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate) for 6 h. The protein kinase activity was detected on the dried gel using the Typhoon imaging system (GE Healthcare). 1-Isopropyl-3-(3-methylbenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (3MBiP) was synthesized using the same procedures as those for a close structural analogue, 3MB-PP1 (ref. 39), with comparable yields, except that iso-propylhydrazine was substituted for tert-butylhydrazine. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.12 (s, 1H), 7.15 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.08 (s, 1H), 7.00 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H), 4.96 (p, J = 6.7 Hz, 1H), 4.31 (s, 2H), 2.24 (s, 3H), 1.44 (d, J = 6.7 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 158.41, 155.78, 153.69, 143.12, 139.56, 137.85, 129.51, 128.79, 127.30, 125.87, 98.92, 48.18, 40.10, 33.70, 22.23, 21.54. ESI–MS calculated for C16H20N5 [M + H]+ is 282.2, found 282.7. For in vitro kinase assay with CPK10(M141G)–Flag or CPK10–Flag, 4 × 104 protoplasts expressing CPK10(M141G)–Flag or CPK10–Flag were lysed in 200 μl immunoprecipitation buffer that contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete mini, Roche). Protein extracts were incubated with 0.5 μg anti-Flag antibody (Sigma, F1804) at 4 °C for 2 h and an additional 1 h with protein G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitated kinase protein was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM DTT). Kinase reactions were performed for 1 h in 25 μl kinase buffer containing 1 μg histone (Sigma H5505 or H4524), 50 μM cold ATP and 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. To block the CPK10(M141G)–Flag kinase activity, 1 μM 3MBiP or DMSO as a control was added in the 25 μl kinase buffer for 2 min before performing the kinase reaction. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS–PAGE loading buffer. After separation on a 12% SDS–PAGE gel, the protein kinase activity was detected on the dried gel using the Typhoon imaging system. For the in vitro kinase assay with CPK10(M141G)–HA isolated from icpk10,30 seedlings, 12 7-day-old seedlings grown in 2 wells of a 6-well-plate with 1 ml medium (0.5 × MS, 0.5% sucrose and 0.1% MES pH 5.7) were grounded in liquid nitrogen into powder and lysed in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. The CPK10(M141G)–HA protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody (Roche, 11666606001) and protein G Sepharose beads. In vitro kinase assay with CPK10(M141G)–HA proteins was carried out as described above. For the in vitro kinase assay with the subgroup III CPKs, Flag-tagged CPK7, CPK8, CPK10, CPK10(KM) (K92M, a kinase-dead mutation in the conserved ATP binding domain), CPK13, CPK30 and CPK32 were expressed in 105 protoplasts and purified with 1 μg anti-Flag antibody conjugated to protein G Sepharose beads as described above. CPK11–Flag from subgroup I was used as a negative control to demonstrate the specificity of NLP7 as a substrate for only subgroup III CPKs. NLP7–HIS (~1 μg) purified from Escherichia coli or histone type III-S (2 μg) was used as substrate in the in vitro kinase assay. Kinase reactions were performed for 1 h at 28 °C in 25 μl kinase buffer containing 5 μM cold ATP and 6 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, which greatly enhanced the CPK activity. To reduce the background caused by free [γ-32P]ATP in the gel, 50 μM cold ATP was added to the kinase reaction before sample loading in 10% (NLP7–HIS) or 12% (HIS) SDS–PAGE gel. To demonstrate that the kinase activities of CPK10, CPK30 and CPK32 were Ca2+-dependent, 4 × 104 (CPK10 or CPK10ac) or 105 (CPK30, CPK32, CPK30ac or CPK32ac) protoplasts expressing CPKs for 12 h instead of 6 h (to increase the yield of CPK proteins) were lysed in 200 μl (CPK10) or 400 μl (CPK30 or CPK32) of immunoprecipitation buffer. The CPK proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (0.5 μg for CPK10 or CPK10ac, and 2 μg for CPK30, CPK32, CPK30ac or CPK32ac) conjugated to protein G Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated CPKs were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with EGTA kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 15 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT). Kinase reactions were performed for 1 h at 28 °C in 25 μl kinase buffer or EGTA kinase buffer containing 5 μM cold ATP and 6 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and purified NLP7–HIS (~1 μg), NLP7-N (1–581 amino acids) (~0.8 μg), NLP7-N(S205A) (~0.8 μg), or histone type III-S (2 μg). After performing the kinase reaction, 50 μM cold ATP was added to reduce the background caused by free [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS–PAGE loading buffer. After separation on a 12% SDS–PAGE gel (histone type III-S) or 10% (NLP7–HIS or NLP7-N–HIS) SDS–PAGE gel, the protein kinase activity was detected on the dried gel using the Typhoon imaging system. Substrate was stained with InstantBlue Protein Stain (C.B.S. Scientific). The expression levels of CPK or CPKac proteins were monitored by immunoblot with anti-Flag-HRP (Sigma, A8592; 1:4,000) antibody. CPKac proteins without the Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains provided constitutive kinase activities that were insensitive to EGTA. The sensitivity of CPK10, CPK30 and CPK32 to EGTA in kinase assays demonstrated their functions as Ca2+ sensors in nitrate signalling, which was further supported by the lack of NLP7–HA phosphorylation and the nuclear retention of NLP7–GFP in icpk mutant cells. Importantly, NLP7(S205A) lost nitrate-induced phosphorylation, nuclear localization, NIR-LUC activation, and endogenous target gene activation in wild-type protoplasts and seedlings. RNA isolation, RT–PCR and RT–qPCR were carried out as described previously (CITATION) . The primers used for RT–PCR and RT–qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 5. TUB4 was used as a control in wild-type and cpk mutants. The relative gene expression was normalized to the expression of UBQ10. Triplicate biological samples were analysed with consistent results. We chose the early time point to minimize secondary target genes and the complexity that negative feedback would have introduced, including indirect effects from assimilation of nitrate and the subsequent activation of transcriptional repressors (CITATION) . Seven-day-old wild-type and icpk seedlings were pretreated with 10 μM 3MBiP for 2 min and then treated for 15 min with either 10 mM KCl or 10 mM KNO3. Total RNA (0.5 μg) was used for preparing the library with the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample Prep Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s guidelines with 9 different barcodes (triplicate biological samples). The libraries were sequenced for 50 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 rapid mode using two lanes of a flow cell. The sequencing was performed at MGH Next Generation Sequencing Core facility (Boston, USA). Fastq files, downloaded from the core facility, were used for data analysis. The quality of each sequencing library was assessed by examining fastq files with FastQC. Reads in the fastq file were first aligned to the Arabidopsis genome, TAIR10, using Tophat (CITATION) . HTSeq (CITATION) was used to determine the reads per gene. Finally, DESeq2 (ref. 53) analysis was performed to determine differential expression (CITATION) . For HTSeq-normalized counts in each sample, differentially expressed genes were determined for wild-type KNO3 versus wild-type KCl and icpk KNO3 versus wild-type KNO3. The differential expression analysis in DESeq2 uses a generalized linear model of the formwhere counts Kij for gene i, sample j are modelled using a negative binomial (NB) distribution with fitted mean μij and a gene-specific dispersion parameter αi. The fitted mean is composed of a sample-specific size factor sj and a parameter qij proportional to the expected true concentration of fragments for sample j. The coefficients βi give the log2 fold changes for gene i for each column of the model matrix X. Results were imported into Microsoft Excel for filtering. To generate a list to minimize false positives of primary nitrate-responsive genes in the wild type, we applied a relatively high stringency, q ≤ 0.05 cut-off, followed by a log2 ≤ −1 or ≥ 1 cut-off. To generate a heatmap, we performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering on genes with Gene Cluster 3.0 (ref. 55) using Correlation (uncentred) as the similarity metric and single linkage as the clustering method. Java Treeview (CITATION) was used to visualize the results of the clustering. To obtain a list of enriched gene functions, we used the Classification SuperViewer Tool on the BAR website (http://bar.utoronto.ca/ntools/cgi-bin/ntools_classification_superviewer.cgi) with the MapMan classification source option. Analyses of enriched functional categories with nitrate upregulated and downregulated genes were performed using the MapMan classification source option on the Classification SuperViewer Tool with manual annotation based on literature. The fold enrichment is calculated as follows: (number in classinput_set/number of totalinput_set)/ (number in classreference_set/ number of totalreference_set). The P value is calculated in Excel using a hypergeometric distribution test. The data in Extended Data Fig. 4c and d were sorted by fold enrichment with a P < 0.05 cut-off. For the biological duplicate RNA-seq experiments for identifying NLP7 target genes in the mesophyll protoplast transient expression system, 500 μg HBT-NLP7-HA, HBT-NLP7(S205A)-HA or control plasmid DNA was transfected into 106 protoplasts and incubated for 4.5 h. Total RNA (0.5 μg) was used to construct the libraries with six different barcodes (biological duplicate samples) as described above. The sequencing result was performed and analysed as described above. Differentially expressed genes were determined with DESeq2 on NLP7 versus Ctl (Control) and NLP7(S205A) versus Ctl. Results were imported into Microsoft Excel for filtering (log2 ≥ 1 cut-off) and generating heatmaps. Transgenic seedlings expressing NLP6–MYC or NLP7–MYC were germinated and grown in basal medium containing 0.5 mM ammonium succinate as a sole nitrogen source (0.01% MES-KOH, pH 5.7) for 4 days at 23 °C under continuous light (60 μmol m−2 s−1). After replacement with fresh medium supplemented with 10 mM KCl or KNO3, the seedlings were collected after incubation for 5, 10 or 30 min. To examine the effects of Ca2+ channel blockers and Ca2+ sensor inhibitors, the 4-day-old seedlings were placed in fresh basal medium supplemented with 2 mM LaCl3, 2 mM GdCl3, 250 μM W5 or 250 μM W7 for 20 min and induced by 10 mM KCl or KNO3. The seedlings were weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground using a Multibeads Shocker (Yasui Kikai). The ground samples were suspended in 20 volume of 1× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with twice the concentration of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and heated at 95 °C for 30 s. Samples were then spun down and the supernatant was subjected to SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-MYC (Millipore, 05-419; 1:1,000) and anti-histone H3 (Abcam, ab1791; 1:5,000) antibodies. For calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) treatment, proteins in 1.2-fold CIP buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM DTT, 2.4-fold concentration of EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) were mixed with CIP solution (New England Biolabs, M0290, 10 U μl−1) at a ratio of 5 (CIP buffer):1 (CIP solution) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Heat-inactivated CIP was mixed as a control treatment. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 30 s. To demonstrate that nitrate-induced NLP7 phosphorylation was abolished in icpk by protein mobility shift in SDS–PAGE, 4 × 104 protoplasts isolated from wild-type or icpk seedlings were transfected with 20 μg NLP7–HA or NLP7(S205A)–HA. To block CPK10(M141G) activity in icpk, 10 μM 3MBiP was added in the incubation buffer (WI) after transfection. After expressing protein for 4.5 h, protoplasts were induced by 10 mM KCl or KNO3 for 15 min. Protoplasts were spun down and re-suspended in 40 μl 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples (10 μl) were separated in a 6% SDS–PAGE resolving gel without a stacking gel layer. After transferring proteins to the PVDF membrane, the NLP7 (wild-type and S205A) proteins were detected with anti-HA-peroxidase (Roche, 11667475001; 1:2,000). RuBisCo was detected by an anti-rubisco antibody (Sigma, GW23153; 1:5,000) as a loading control. Transformation of T87 cell suspension culture derived from a seedling of A. thaliana L. (Heynh.) ecotype Columbia (CITATION) was conducted with the 35SΩ-NLP7-MYC construct in the pCB302 binary plasmid carrying the hygromycin B selection marker gene. Transformants mediated by Agrobacterium (GV3101) were selected on agar plates (JPL medium, 3 g l−1 gellun gum, 500 mg l−1 carbenicillin and 20 mg l−1 hygromycin), and the transformants were maintained in liquid JPL medium as described previously (CITATION) . T87 cells expressing NLP7–MYC were incubated in nitrogen-free JPL liquid medium for 2 days, and then 10 mM KNO3 was added into the medium. After 30 min treatment, the T87 cells (approximately 4 g frozen weight) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized with Multi-beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai) in 10 ml of the buffer that contained 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 1× PhosSTOP (Roche). Cell lysates obtained were incubated with anti-MYC antibodies crosslinked to Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Trapped proteins were eluted by 1× Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS–PAGE. Gel pieces containing NLP7–MYC were recovered and subjected to in-gel double digestion with trypsin (10 ng μl−1) and chymotrypsin (10 ng μl−1) (Promega). NanoLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed as described previously (CITATION) with minor modifications. To analyse NLP7 nuclear retention triggered by nitrate in protoplasts, nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts (4 × 104 protoplasts in 200 μl) were co-transfected with 20 μg NLP7–GFP or NLP7(S205A)–GFP and 10 μg HBT-HY5-mCherry plasmid DNA and incubated for 6 h. Mesophyll protoplasts were spun down for 1 min at 100g. WI buffer with 10 mM KCl or KNO3 was added into mesophyll protoplasts for 30 min. The treated protoplasts were loaded onto slides and imaged with the 20× objective lens on a Leica DM5000B microscope operated with the Leica AF software. The images were collected and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. To analyse NLP7–GFP nuclear retention triggered by nitrate in transgenic lines, NLP7–GFP/nlp7-1 and NLP7(S205A)–GFP/nlp7-1 seedlings were germinated and grown on the basal medium supplemented with 2.5 mM ammonium succinate and with 1% phytoagar under constant light (150 μmol m−2 s−1) at 23 °C for 5 days. Plants were placed on the slide as described above and stimulated by 10 mM KNO3. Confocal images were acquired as described for GCaMP6-based Ca2+ imaging in transgenic seedlings. To analyse CPK10, CPK30 and CPK32 nuclear localization in response to nitrate, nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts (4 × 104 protoplasts in 200 μl) were co-transfected with 20 μg CPK10–GFP, CPK30–GFP or CPK32–GFP and 10 μg HBT-HY5-mCherry plasmid DNA and incubated for 12 h. Protoplasts were then treated with 10 mM KNO3 for 5 min. Confocal imaging was acquired using the Leica Application Suite X software on a Leica TCS SP8 (Leica) confocal microscope with the 40× objective lens. To obtain fluorescence images, the excitation was set to 489 nm (GFP) and 587 nm (mCherry), and images at emissions 508 nm (GFP) and 610 nm (mCherry) were collected. The scanning resolution was set to 1,024 × 1,024 pixels. The images were collected and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. To analyse NLP7–GFP nuclear retention in wild-type and icpk seedlings, nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts (4 × 104 protoplasts in 200 μl) were co-transfected with 20 μg NLP7–GFP and 4 μg HBT-Td-Tomato plasmid DNA and incubated for 12–16 h. The transfected protoplasts were treated with inhibitor 10 μM 3MBiP 30 min before nitrate induction. Protoplasts were treated with 10 mM KNO3 for 15 min in the presence of 10 μM 3MBiP of WI buffer. The images were acquired as described above for the NLP7 nuclear retention in protoplasts. Nitrate-free mesophyll protoplasts (4 × 104 protoplasts in 200 μl) were co-transfected with 18 μg UBQ10-CPK10(KM)-YN, UBQ10-NLP7-YC, and 4 μg HBT-HY5-mCherry plasmid DNA, and incubated for 12–18 h. Protoplasts were then treated with 10 mM KNO3 for 2 h. Confocal images were acquired as described above for CPK localization in response to nitrate. The chosen sample sizes for all experiments were empirically determined by measuring the mean and s.d. for the sample population in pilot experiments, and then calculated (the 1-sample Z-test method, two-sided test) with the aim to obtain the expected mean of less than 25% significant difference with the alpha value ≤ 0.05 and the power of the test ≥ 0.80. For multiple comparisons, data were first subjected to one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test to determine statistical significance. To compare two groups, a Student’s t-test was used instead. To compare wild-type and icpk lateral root development, data were categorized into two groups, and then subjected to a chi-square test, as indicated in the figure legends. Experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
