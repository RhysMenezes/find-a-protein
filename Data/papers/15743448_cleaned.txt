!~ABS~! Vacuolar compartments associated with leaf senescence and the subcellular localization of the senescence-specific cysteine-protease SAG12 (senescence-associated gene 12) were studied using specific fluorescent markers, the expression of reporter genes, and the analysis of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples. Senescence-associated vacuoles (SAVs) with intense proteolytic activity develop in the peripheral cytoplasm of mesophyll and guard cells in Arabidopsis and soybean. The vacuolar identity of these compartments was confirmed by immunolabeling with specific antibody markers. SAVs and the central vacuole differ in their acidity and tonoplast composition: SAVs are more acidic than the central vacuole and, whereas the tonoplast of central vacuoles is highly enriched in γ-TIP (tonoplast intrinsic protein), the tonoplast of SAVs lacks this aquaporin. The expression of a SAG12-GFP fusion protein in transgenic Arabidopsis plants shows that SAG12 localizes to SAVs. The analysis of ProSAG12:GUS transgenic plants indicates that SAG12 expression in senescing leaves is restricted to SAV-containing cells, for example, mesophyll and guard cells. A homozygous sag12 Arabidopsis mutant develops SAVs and does not show any visually detectable phenotypical alteration during senescence, indicating that SAG12 is not required either for SAV formation or for progression of visual symptoms of senescence. The presence of two types of vacuoles in senescing leaves could provide different lytic compartments for the dismantling of specific cellular components. The possible origin and functions of SAVs during leaf senescence are discussed.

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotypes Columbia, Col, and Wassilewskija, Ws) was grown in soil with Arabidopsis controlled-release fertilizer (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA). Plants were grown at 23°C with an 11-h-light/13-h-dark cycle. Arabidopsis apg7mutant plants (CITATION), the sag12-2 T-DNA insertional mutant plants, and transgenic plants harboring the ProSAG12:SAG12-GFP construct were in Ws, whereas the ProSAG12:GUS construct (pSAG12P-1345) was expressed in Col (CITATION). Soybean (Glycine max) cv. Clark seeds were obtained from the USDA Northern Germoplasm Collection (Department of Agronomy, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA). Plants were grown in a chamber at 26°C day/21°C night, at 450 μm m−2 sec−1 irradiance, and with a 10-h-light/14-h-dark cycle. To make the ProSAG12:SAG12-GFP construct, 4.3 kb genomic DNA containing 2.8 kb 5′ upstream region and entire exon and intron sequence of SAG12 was amplified by PCR using 12GFP1 (5′-ACCCATGGCTCCTATAGTTGGGTAAGAAGCTTTCATGGC-3′) and 12GFP2 (5′-GCGAGCTCTCGACAAGCTATAGACCTCAAG-3′) as primers; restriction sites are shown in boldface, and sequences corresponding to the SAG12 region are underlined. The resulting PCR product was digested with SacI-NcoI and ligated to the SacI-NcoI-digested pAVA393 (CITATION), resulting in pNA127. In pNA127, SAG12 was translationally fused to GFP through a three-amino-acid linker (IAG), which was inserted in the place of the SAG12 stop codon and right before the start codon of GFP. 5.2 kb SacI-PstI fragment from pNA127 containing SAG12-GFP-terminator was subcloned into SacI-PstI-digested pPZP221, resulting in pNA128. Arabidopsis (ecotype Ws) plants were transformed with pNA128-containing Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI by infiltration (CITATION). Transgenic lines were selected on agar-solidified medium containing 0.65 g l−1 Peter's Excel 15-5-15 fertilizer (Scotts, Maysville, OH, USA) and 50 μg ml−1 gentamycin. sag12-2 was isolated from the Kan population of the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility (http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/) by a PCR-based reverse genetic approach (CITATION) using 12KO-1 (5′-GCAAAACATCATCAACACATATCCAACTTCG-3′) or 12KO-2 (5′-TTTTAGACATCAATCCCACACAAACATACAC-3′) as gene-specific primers and JL202 (5′-CATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3′) as a left border T-DNA-specific primer. A single T-DNA insertion in the second exon of SAG12 between sequences 5′-TGCGACACAA-3′ and 5′-ACGATTTTGG-3′ was confirmed by the single-gene segregation of kanamycin resistance and by the sequencing of the T-DNA borders. Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA gel blots, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis as described by CITATION. Full-length cDNA fragments were used as SAG12 and SAG13 probes. Chlorophyll content was estimated by taking measurements at the center of the leaves with a Minolta SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Osaka, Japan). Non-senescing and senescing leaves of A. thaliana and soybean were cut into small pieces with a razor blade and incubated in suspension buffer (0.6 m manitol, 0.1% w/v BSA, 20 mm MES pH 6) for 30 min, under vacuum and in darkness. The leaf pieces were then incubated in digestion buffer (1% cellulase, 0.3% pectinase, 0.3% driselase, 0.5 m manitol, 0.1% w/v BSA, 20 mm MES pH 5.8 for Arabidopsis and 1% pectinase, 0.5 m manitol, 0.1% w/v BSA, 20 mm MES pH 5.8 for soybean) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 2 h. Arabidopsis protoplasts and isolated leaf cells from soybean were separated from undigested tissue fragments by filtration through a 100-μm mesh and collected by centrifugation at 50 g for 15 min at room temperature. Protoplasts and isolated cells were gently resuspended in suspension buffer. Cellulase, pectinase and driselase were purchased from Sigma. Lysotracker Red DND-99, Lysosensor Yellow/Blue DND-160, and the Cys-protease substrate R-6502 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA) and Neutral Red from Sigma. Both Lysotracker Red DND-99 and Lysosensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 were kept as 1 mm stock solutions in DMSO. R-6502 was kept as a 5-mm stock solution in DMF. Protoplasts, isolated cells and leaf pieces were incubated with 1% Neutral Red (15 min), 5 μm Lysotracker Red (10 min), and 50 μm R-6502 (20 min) (Molecular Probes). After washing the excess of dye, samples were observed in a LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). GFP and R-6502 were excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser and the emission was monitored using a 505–550-nm bandpass filter. Lysotracker Red and Neutral Red were excited with the 543 nm helium-neon laser line and imaged through a 560–605 nm bandpass filter; whereas chlorophyll detection was achieved by using a 633-nm line for excitation and a 650-nm longpass filter for emission. Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM Image Examiner Version 2.30.011. Colocalization images were obtained using the same software after parallel confocal image acquisition. For further processing, images were imported as TIF files into Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1 (Mountain View, CA, USA). The pH calibration curve was obtained according to CITATION with modifications. Leaf protoplasts were incubated in 20 μm Lysosensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 [2-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-(2-dimethylaminoethylamino-carbamoyl)-methoxy)-phenyl-oxazole, Molecular Probes] for 1 h. The excess of dye was removed by washing protoplasts with 20 mm MES, 0.45 m betaine buffer (pH6). Then, protoplasts were treated with MES calibration buffers (10 mm MES, 0.45 m betaine), ranging from pH 4.5 to 6.5, and containing 10 μm nigericin (Sigma). Measurements were taken 5–10 min after addition of nigericin. Protoplasts were visualized in an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200, Tokyo, Japan) adapted for epifluorescence, excited at 340 and 380 nm, and the fluorescence emission intensity was recorded at 530 nm. The intensity ratio (I340/380) was calculated after subtracting the background signal. To determine the fluorescence emission of SAVs and central vacuoles, we obtained vacuoplasts and miniplasts from protoplasts of Arabidopsis senescing leaves according to CITATION with modifications. Protoplasts were layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of 2 ml of 60% Percoll (v/v) (Sigma) and 2.5 ml of 30% Percoll in 10 mm MES (pH 6), 0.5 m betaine, and 10 mm CaCl2. A 0.5 ml volume of the same solution with no Percoll was added on top of the Percoll suspension and the gradient was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h using a swing out rotor (MLS 50; Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Vacuoplasts and isolated central vacuoles were collected from the upper fraction whereas miniplasts (protoplasts with no central vacuole) were collected in the 60–30% Percoll interphase. Then, vacuoplasts and miniplasts were incubated in 20 μm Lysosensor Yellow/Blue for 1 h and the fluorescence emission intensity ratios (I340/380) were calculated separately for each of them in the same way as explained above for intact protoplasts, with the exception that samples were kept in 20 mm MES, 0.45 m betaine buffer (pH 6) and no nigericin was added. The fluorescence emission intensity ratios (I340/380) obtained from vacuoplasts and miniplasts were converted to absolute values of vacuolar pH by comparison with the calibration curve. Tukey's test was used to analyze ratiometric values and P < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. Histochemical staining for GUS activity was performed according to CITATION. Small pieces of senescing leaves from plants expressing the ProSAG12:GUS construct (pSAG12P-1345; CITATION) were vacuum-infiltrated and incubated with a solution containing 2 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma), 50 mm NaPO4 buffer (pH 7.2), 50 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 50 mm K4Fe(CN)6 at 37°C for 20 h. Then, samples were dehydrated, embedded in Paraplast (Oxford Labware, St Louis, MO, USA), and sectioned. Arabidopsis and soybean leaves were sectioned with a razor blade into small pieces and infiltrated with hexadecane. Leaf samples were then loaded in sample holders filled with hexadecene, frozen in a Baltec HPM 010 high-pressure freezer (Technotrade, Manchester, NH, USA), and transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage. Substitution was performed in 2% OsO4 in anhydrous acetone at −80°C for 72 h, and followed by slow warming to room temperature over a period of 2 days. After several acetone rinses, samples were teased from the holders and infiltrated in Epon resin (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA) following the schedule: 5% resin in acetone (4 h), 10% resin (12 h), 25% resin (12 h) 50, 75, and 100% (24 h each concentration). Polymerization was carried out at 60°C. Sections were stained with 2% uranyl actetate in 70% methanol for 10 min followed by Reynold's lead citrate (2.6% lead nitrate and 3.5% sodium citrate, pH 12) and observed in a Zeiss EM 109. For immunolabeling, some high-pressure frozen samples were substituted in 0.1% uranyl acetate plus 0.2% glutaraldehyde in acetone at −80°C for 72 h, and warmed to −50°C for 24 h. After several acetone rinses these samples were infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA, USA) for 72 h and polymerized at −50°C under UV light for 72 h. Sections were mounted on formvar-coated nickel grids and blocked for 20 min with a 5% (w/v) solution of non-fat milk in PBST (0.1% Tween-20). The antibodies anti-V-(H+)-pyrophosphatase, and anti-VM23 (CITATION) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were rinsed in a stream of PBST (0.5% Tween-20) and then transferred to the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG 1:50 in PBST) conjugated to 15 nm gold particles for 1 h. Controls were performed by omitting the primary antibody.
