!~ABS~! The epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat, which correspond to the second layer of the outer integument (oi2), contain large quantities of a pectic polysaccharide called mucilage within the apoplastic space beneath the outer periclinal cell wall. Immediately after seed imbibition, the mucilage is extruded and completely envelops the seed in a gel-like capsule. We found that a class III peroxidase family protein, PEROXIDASE36 (PER36), functions as a mucilage extrusion factor. Expression of PER36 occurred only in oi2 cells for a few days around the torpedo stage. A PER36–green fluorescent protein fusion was secreted into the outer cell wall in a polarized manner. per36 mutants were defective in mucilage extrusion after seed imbibition due to the failure of outer cell wall rupture, although the mutants exhibited normal monosaccharide composition of the mucilage. This abnormal phenotype of per36 was rescued by pectin solubilization, which promoted cell wall loosening. These results suggest that PER36 regulates the degradation of the outer cell wall. Taken together, this work indicates that polarized secretion of PER36 in a developmental stage-dependent manner plays a role in cell wall modification of oi2 cells.
!~RES~! Previously, we reported that the NAC transcription factors NAC-REGULATED SEED MOLPHOLOGY1 (NARS1) and NARS2 regulate seed coat formation (CITATION). Staining of seeds with ruthenium red to visualize pectic polysaccharides revealed that the nars1 nars2 double mutant fails to extrude mucilage (see Supplemental Figure 1A online), suggesting that NARS1 and NARS2 may regulate the expression of mucilage-related factors. The At3g50990 gene encoding PER36 was remarkably downregulated in the nars1 nars2 silique, which contains the developing seeds (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). These results suggested that PER36 is a mucilage-related factor. Expression of PER36 was restricted to the young silique containing the developing seeds (Figure 1A). AtGenExpress expression profile analysis indicated that PER36 expression occurred in developing seeds isolated from the silique (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). To determine where PER36 was expressed in the developing seed, RT-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from the embryo and from the remaining tissue consisting of endosperm and integument. The PER36 transcript was not detected in the embryo but was detected in the tissue comprising endosperm and integument (Figure 1B). The distribution pattern of transcripts of NARS1 and PROTODERMAL FACTOR1 (PDF1), which are markers of the outer integument and embryo, respectively (CITATION; CITATION), confirmed that the tissue had been prepared correctly (Figure 1B). These results indicate that PER36 is expressed in the endosperm and/or integument. [[FIGURE]] Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing ProPER36:sGFP-GUS, the synthetic green fluorescent protein–β-glucuronidase fusion under the control of the PER36 promoter, were generated to examine the expression pattern of PER36 in tissues of developing seeds. The GFP fluorescence signal was detected in the integument but not in the endosperm during the torpedo stage (Figure 1C). Higher magnification of the outer integument revealed that GFP fluorescence was restricted to oi2 cells, whereas the fluorescent dye FM4-64, a marker of the plasma membrane, was present in the inner cell layer of the integument including oi1 and oi2 cells (Figure 1D). The observed PER36 expression pattern indicates that PER36 is specifically localized to oi2 cells. The protein accumulation levels of PER36 during seed formation were investigated using ProPER36:PER36-GFPg4 transgenic plants (Figure 2A), which were generated to express the PER36-GFPg4 fusion protein under the control of the PER36 promoter in the per36-1 genetic background (described below). GFPg4 is a modified GFP in which four consecutive Gly residues are added to the C terminus to avoid mislocalization of the fusion protein to vacuoles (CITATION). The siliques of ProPER36:PER36-GFPg4 were harvested at different stages ranging from 1 d after pollination (DAP) to 15 DAP and subjected to immunoblot analysis. PER36-GFPg4 emerged at 5 DAP, and its accumulation reached a maximum at 6 DAP, which corresponded to the torpedo stage, followed by rapid degradation. Thus, PER36-GFPg4 was detected only for a few days during early seed formation, which is different from the accumulation pattern of δVPE. In previous work, we showed that δVPE accumulates until the middle stages of seed formation, despite programmed cell death of the inner integument at the end of early seed formation (CITATION). These results suggest that PER36 functions transiently in living oi2 cells around the torpedo stage. [[FIGURE]] The molecular mass of PER36-GFPg4 shifted from 68 to 65 kD during seed development (Figure 2A), suggesting that the 68-kD form is processed to yield the 65-kD form. Suborganellar fractionation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that the 68-kD form was present in the microsomal fraction (P100), whereas the 65-kD form was present in the soluble fraction (S100) (Figure 2B). The 65-kD form might be generated after removal of the C-terminal sequence of PER36-GFPg4. Similar processing of the GFP fusions on the secretory pathway was reported previously (CITATION). Because the high accumulation of PER36-GFPg4 is restricted to the torpedo stage (Figure 2A), its subcellular localization was examined in the oi2 cells of developing seeds at 6 and 7 DAP using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Figure 3A). sGFP-GUS, which is localized specifically to the cytosol, was used as a control (Figure 3B). At 6 DAP, PER36-GFPg4 fluorescence was detected in both the intra- and extracellular spaces of oi2 cells. Intracellular fluorescence was distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum network-like structures (Figure 3A; 6 DAP, horizon). Extracellular fluorescence was primarily localized to the outer periclinal cell wall, which is exposed to the external environment. No fluorescence was observed at the inner periclinal cell wall. These results suggest that PER36-GFPg4 secretion is highly regulated in a polarized manner. [[FIGURE]] Accumulating extracellular fluorescence was still observed at 7 DAP; however, intracellular fluorescence was no longer detected (Figure 3A; 7 DAP). Considering the developmental shift in the molecular mass of PER36-GFPg4 (Figure 2A), the extra- and intracellular fluorescent signals likely correspond to the 65- and 68-kD forms, respectively. Together, these results suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum–localized 68-kD protein is secreted into the outer cell wall of oi2 cells, where the processed 65-kD form accumulates. Next, two T-DNA insertion mutants of PER36, per36-1 and per36-2, were isolated (Figure 4A). Analysis of gene expression confirmed that per36-1 and per36-2 were knockdown mutants of PER36 (Figure 4B; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Toluidine blue staining of transverse sections cut from developing seeds showed normal accumulation of mucilage around the columella in the oi2 cells of per36 mutants, similar to that observed in wild-type seeds (Figure 4C). Scanning electron microscopy revealed no obvious differences in the surfaces of dry wild-type and per36 mutant seeds (Figure 4D). These results indicate that oi2 cells develop normally in per36 mutants. [[FIGURE]] Transmission electron micrographs of transverse sections of developing seeds at 9 DAP showed no differences in the outer cell wall of the oi2 cells of wild-type and per36 mutant seeds (Figure 4E). Higher magnification images of wild-type mucilage revealed the presence of a large number of highly electron-dense filaments that formed a meshwork within the mucilage (Figure 4F; the wild type). However, the per36 mutants showed a marked reduction in the number of filamentous structures, giving the meshwork a rough appearance in contrast with the fine appearance in the wild type (Figure 4F; per36-1 and per36-2). This abnormal phenotype of the per36-1 mutant was restored by expressing PER36-GFPg4 in oi2 cells (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). These results suggest that mucilage components are affected by downregulation of PER36. Because peroxidases are known to catalyze the cross-linking of cell wall components (CITATION), the filamentous structures might be formed by a cross-linking reaction between the mucilage components in a peroxidase-dependent manner (the peroxidative cycle; see Discussion). To examine mucilage extrusion from seed coat, dry seeds of the wild type and per36 mutants were directly shaken in ruthenium red solution, which stains pectic polysaccharides. Approximately 94.7% ± 2.1% of wild-type seeds were completely enrobed in mucilage gel matrix, whereas 4.7% ± 1.8% showed partial extrusion of mucilage from the seed coat (Figures 5A and 5C). By contrast, in per36 mutants, complete mucilage extrusion was rarely observed (<10%) and partial mucilage extrusion occurred in ∼90% of the seeds (Figures 5B and 5C). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the abnormal mucilage extrusion of per36 mutants correlated with PER36 downregulation, molecular complementation studies were conducted using two independent lines of ProPER36:PER36-GFPg4 transgenic plants. Immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antibody showed that the transgenic plants expressed PER36-GFPg4 in developing seeds at the torpedo stage, as observed by the detection of the 65- and 68-kD bands (Figure 5D). Expression of PER36-GFPg4 rescued the mucilage extrusion deficiency of per36-1 mutant seeds, and the mucilage gel matrix of the transgenic plants was indistinguishable from that of wild-type seeds (Figure 5E). Quantification of mucilage extrusion in seeds of the wild type, per36 mutants, and ProPER36:PER36-GFPg4 transgenic plants was achieved by staining seeds with ruthenium red solution without shaking (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). In this case, ∼30% of per36 mutant seeds showed complete or partial mucilage extrusion, whereas ∼60 to 80% of seeds of wild-type and transgenic plants showed normal or partial mucilage extrusion. Taken together, these results indicate that PER36 is involved in mucilage extrusion. The outer cell walls of wild-type and per36 mutant seeds were inspected under a light microscope after imbibition. Seed imbibition resulted in mucilage-mediated rupture of the outer cell wall in wild-type seeds (Figure 6A). By contrast, the outer cell wall of per36 mutant seeds formed dome-shaped structures that were detached from the columella; these structures appeared to be caused by mucilage expansion. No obvious differences were observed between the cell walls of wild-type and per36 mutant seeds incubated in ethanol, indicating that the dome-shaped walls observed on the per36 mutant seeds were formed due to imbibition. These dome-shaped outer cell walls were frequently peeled away as a large sheet by shaking the seeds (Figure 6B), possibly due to the mechanically induced collisions between the seeds. This peeling resulted in the partial extrusion of mucilage (Figures 5B and 5C). These results suggest that per36 mutants have rigid outer cell wall, compared with that of the wild type. [[FIGURE]] Finally, to examine the influence of pectin solubilization on mucilage extrusion in the per36 mutants, wild-type and per36 mutant seeds were shaken in a solution containing the chelating agent EDTA or the weak alkali Na2CO3 and then stained with ruthenium red. per36 mutant seeds showed normal mucilage extrusion, similar to wild-type seeds (Figure 7A). Quantification of ruthenium red staining demonstrated that treatment with EDTA and Na2CO3 significantly increased mucilage extrusion in per36 mutant seeds (Figure 7B). A similar result was reported for some mucilage extrusion-deficient mutants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Taken together, these results suggest that PER36 plays a role in mucilage extrusion by regulating the degradation of the outer cell wall of oi2 cells. [[FIGURE]] The PER36 sequence has both a catalytic and distal heme binding domain and a proximal heme binding domain that are conserved in peroxidase family proteins (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). This raised the question of whether PER36 actually functions as a peroxidase. To address it, we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed the PER36-GFPg4 protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the per36-1 background and isolated the PER36-GFPg4 protein from two independent transgenic lines by affinity chromatography with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 8A). The PER36-GFPg4 fraction showed peroxidase activity toward the typical peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Figure 8B). The activities of the PER36-GFPg4 fractions were significantly higher than those of the control fractions that were obtained from the transgenic line expressing free GFP and the per36-1 mutant line. It should be noted that similar levels of activity were found in the total extract fractions from the lines examined (Figure 8B). These results indicate that the PER36-GFPg4 protein had a peroxidase activity, suggesting that PER36 functions as a peroxidase in oi2 cells. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used as the wild type. The T-DNA insertion mutants SAIL_194_G03 (per36-1) and SALK_118195 (per36-2) were obtained from the ABRC at Ohio State University, and the T-DNA insertion sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The nars1, nars2, and nars1 nars2 double mutants were obtained as reported previously (CITATION). The transgenic Arabidopsis plant expressing sGFP-BE under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were described previously (CITATION). Surface-sterilized seeds were sown onto 0.8% agar in Murashige and Skoog medium containing B5 vitamins and 1% Suc and grown at 22°C under continuous light. Three-week-old plants were transferred onto soil and grown at 22°C under 16-h-light conditions. For generation of transgenic plants expressing sGFP-GUS or PER36-GFPg4 under the control of the PER36 promoter or the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, R4pGWB533/ProPER36:sGFP-GUS, R4pGWB501/ProPER36:PER36GFPg4, and pH2GW7/Pro35S:PER36GFPg4 vectors were constructed. This cloning information is shown in Supplemental Table 2 online. The vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation, and the transformed bacteria were then infiltrated into Arabidopsis plants (Columbia-0 or per36-1) by the floral dip method (CITATION). The sequences of the primers used are shown in Supplemental Table 3 online. Developing seeds were stained with 50 μM FM4-64 (Invitrogen) for 0.5 h. Seed coat mucilage was stained with 0.01% ruthenium red under appropriate conditions for each experiment. For details, see the corresponding figure legends. Fluorescent samples were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (model LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss) using the 488-nm line of a 40-mW Ar/Kr laser for GFP or the 544-nm line of a 1-mW He/Ne laser for FM4-64. The exported data were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems). For observation of extruded mucilage, the seeds were examined using a stereoscopic microscope (model MVX10; Olympus) or a light microscope (Axioskop 2 plus system; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (model VB-7010; Keyence). Developing seeds were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded as described previously (CITATION). For histological studies, thin sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined with a light microscope (Axioskop 2 plus system). For ultrastructural studies, the ultrathin sections were stained with 0.4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a transmission electron microscope (model H-7600; Hitachi High-Technologies) operated at 80 kV. The surface of dry seeds was observed with a scanning electron microscope (model Miniscope TM-1000; Hitachi High-Technologies) without fixation. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis tissues with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was used for the synthesis of cDNA with Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). PCR was performed with the cDNAs and ExTaq polymerase (Takara). The primer sets used are shown in Supplemental Table 3 online. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed essentially as described previously (CITATION) using the following gene-specific primer sets (Applied Biosystems): At02297801_g1 for PER36 and At02335270_gH for ACT2. The relative quantity of target mRNA was calculated using ACT2 as a standard. Developing seeds or siliques of ProPER36:PER36-GFPg4/per36-1 transgenic plants were harvested at the proper developmental stages for each experiment. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblot analysis. The following antibodies were used as primary and secondary antibodies: anti-GFP (JL-8) (Clontech; diluted 1:1000), anti-δVPE (1:5000) (CITATION), anti-VSR1 (1:5000) (CITATION), anti-ALEU (1:5000) (CITATION), horseradish peroxidase–conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences; diluted 1:2000), and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce; diluted 1:2000). The antibodies were detected using the ECL or ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Systems (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. Siliques with developing seeds at the torpedo-shaped embryo stage were homogenized in homogenizing buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.4 M Suc, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenate was filtered through a cell strainer (100-μm nylon; BD Biosciences) to remove cellular debris. The filtrate was centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C and separated into pellet (microsomal fraction) and supernatant (soluble fraction). Three-week-old plants (0.5 g) of sGFP-BE, Pro35:PER36-GFPg4/per36-1, and per36-1 were homogenized in three volumes of cold homogenizing buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected as total fractions. The total fractions were incubated with magnetic beads conjugated to an anti-GFP antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) on ice for 30 min and then applied to μColumns (Miltenyi Biotec) in a magnetic field. After extensive washing with the buffer, proteins bound to magnetic beads were collected. The total and bound fractions were subjected to enzyme assay and immunoblot analysis. Peroxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using 3,3′,5,5′-tetrametylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 0.5 mM TMB, 0.00525% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide, and the enzyme in a total volume of 200 μL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme, and the change in absorbance at 650 nm was monitored for 5 min with a spectrophotometer (model Infinite 200 PRO; TECAN). The extinction coefficient for TMB was 39.0 mM−1 cm−1 at 653 nm. Mucilage for high-performance anion exchange chromatography was prepared essentially as described by CITATION. Dry seeds (30 mg) were pretreated with 50 μL 1 M sodium carbonate for 30 min. After adding 1.2 mL of water, the samples were shaken for 2 h and then the extract was collected as a sodium carbonate fraction. The seeds were further shaken with 300 μL 4 M KOH containing 0.2% sodium borohydride for 1 h and then the extract was collected and neutralized with 75 μL of acetic acid. We repeated this treatment twice and collected the extract (total 1125 µL) as a KOH fraction. Either the sodium carbonate fraction or the KOH fraction was mixed with four volumes ethanol and then centrifuged. The precipitate mucilage was hydrolyzed with 2 n trifluoroacetic acid for 90 min at 120°C. The neutral and acidic monosaccharide sugars derived from the mucilage were analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (model ICS-5000; Dionex) with a CarboPac PA1 column (Dionex).
