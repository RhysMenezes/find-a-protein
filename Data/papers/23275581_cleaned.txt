!~ABS~! In a chemical genetics screen we identified the small-molecule [5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)furan-2-yl]-piperidine-1-ylmethanethione (DFPM) that triggers rapid inhibition of early abscisic acid signal transduction via PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4)- and ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1)-dependent immune signaling mechanisms. However, mechanisms upstream of EDS1 and PAD4 in DFPM-mediated signaling remain unknown. Here, we report that DFPM generates an Arabidopsis thaliana accession-specific root growth arrest in Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants. The genetic locus responsible for this natural variant, VICTR (VARIATION IN COMPOUND TRIGGERED ROOT growth response), encodes a TIR-NB-LRR (for Toll-Interleukin1 Receptor–nucleotide binding–Leucine-rich repeat) protein. Analyses of T-DNA insertion victr alleles showed that VICTR is necessary for DFPM-induced root growth arrest and inhibition of abscisic acid–induced stomatal closing. Transgenic expression of the Col-0 VICTR allele in DFPM-insensitive Arabidopsis accessions recapitulated the DFPM-induced root growth arrest. EDS1 and PAD4, both central regulators of basal resistance and effector-triggered immunity, as well as HSP90 chaperones and their cochaperones RAR1 and SGT1B, are required for the DFPM-induced root growth arrest. Salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathway components are dispensable. We further demonstrate that VICTR associates with EDS1 and PAD4 in a nuclear protein complex. These findings show a previously unexplored association between a TIR-NB-LRR protein and PAD4 and identify functions of plant immune signaling components in the regulation of root meristematic zone-targeted growth arrest.
!~RES~! The chemical compound DFPM (Figure 1A) was isolated from a chemical library of 9600 compounds by screening for physiologically active small molecules that inhibit ABA-induced gene expression and signal transduction (CITATION). An in-depth screen for additional visible phenotypic responses caused by DFPM application identified a rapid root growth inhibition after DFPM treatment. Intriguingly, this arrest was found to be specific for the Col-0 accession. DFPM did not affect root growth of the Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta (Ler) accession (Figure 1B). At a concentration of 5 μM DFPM, root growth of Col-0 was blocked (EC50 = 1.5 μM; Figure 1C). The seedling root growth of 50 other Arabidopsis accessions, including Ler, Kindalville-0 (Kin-0), Bayreuth-0 (Bay-0), and C24, were not affected by DFPM treatment (Figure 1D; see Supplemental Table 1 online). We concluded that the Col-0 accession contains unusual natural genetic variation that causes DFPM-induced root growth arrest. Based on the phenotype, we refer to this class of genes as VICTR. In response to DFPM, primary root growth of Col-0 was abrogated, but secondary lateral root growth was not (Figure 1B). [[FIGURE]] Chemical compounds structurally similar to DFPM (see Supplemental Figure 1A online) were analyzed to define critical structural motifs required for the triggering of the VICTR phenotype. These analyses showed that modifications in the structure of several DFPM-related compounds can reduce the potency of the DFPM response. Although the slightly modified molecules DFPM-1 and DFPM-2 exhibited biological activity similar to the original DFPM, a chlorine in the four position seemed to be critical for eliciting the VICTR phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Loss of activity was also caused by modifications of side groups as shown in DFPM-3. Whether DFPM or a breakdown product thereof is the active compound remains to be determined. The root growth response caused by DFPM was found to be time dependent. Only 8 h of DFPM treatment was sufficient to initiate the VICTR phenotype in an irreversible manner (see Supplemental Figure 2C online). Primary root growth did not recover even 6 d after seedlings were retransferred to standard growth media. Microscopy examination of the morphological changes of Col-0 roots treated with DFPM revealed a large reduction of the meristematic and elongation zones, whereas root differentiation, such as vascular and lateral root formation, did not show any observable differences, indicating that DFPM may target the primary root meristematic zone (Figure 1E). To investigate molecular changes in DFPM-treated primary root tips, the pattern of local auxin accumulation was examined using DR5 promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) lines (CITATION) in the Col-0 background (Figure 1F). DFPM treatment for 1 d did not change the pDR5:GFP activity at the columella at the root tip (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). After 4 d of DFPM treatment, no pDR5:GFP activity was visible at the columella of Col-0 (Figure 1F), consistent with the model that DFPM targets the primary root meristem. However, the pDR5:GFP construct has been reported to have certain limitations as an auxin reporter and to not necessarily correlate with other auxin-sensitive genes (CITATION). Therefore, to measure the effect of DFPM on auxin transporters in the primary root, pPIN1:PIN1-GFP and pPIN2:PIN2-GFP Col-0 lines were monitored as a function of time after DFPM exposure (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). After 18 h of DFPM treatment, both PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP signals became weaker. At 24 h, when DFPM-mediated root growth arrest becomes visible, both PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP levels decreased substantially. These results indicate that altered PIN1 or PIN2 activities and resulting changes in the auxin gradient, which is important to maintain meristematic cell divisions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), might contribute to DFPM-mediated root growth inhibition. SCARECROW (SCR) expression was analyzed as an endodermal and quiescent center marker gene (CITATION). SCR expression was disrupted after 4 d of DFPM treatment when DFPM had already produced obvious morphological differences (Figure 1F). However, SCR expression exhibited a normal pattern of expression after 1 d of DFPM treatment (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). Therefore, the disrupted SCR expression in Col-0 might be a secondary effect of the altered root morphology after DFPM treatment. Consistent with the deregulated DR5 and SCR expression patterns induced after 4 d by DFPM, cell cycle activity monitored by the Cyclin B1 promoter (CITATION) was disrupted by DFPM treatment (Figure 1F). Retention of the normal expression pattern of Cyclin B1 in secondary root meristems demonstrates the tissue specificity of the DFPM effect (Figure 1F). These marker line analyses suggesting that DFPM targets the primary root meristematic zone led us to further explore how DFPM mediates root growth arrest (described further below). To identify the genetic element(s) in Col-0 producing the VICTR phenotype, 100 Col × Ler recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (CITATION) that have been genotyped using microarrays (CITATION) were screened for the VICTR phenotype (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of the phenotypic scores and available genetic map information for these RILs suggested that a single locus in Col-0 positioned on the lower arm of chromosome 5 might determine DFPM-induced root arrest (Figure 2A). [[FIGURE]] F1 seedlings of Col-0 crosses to Ler produced the Col-0 VICTR phenotype upon DFPM treatment, indicating that heterozygous expression of the VICTRCol allele is sufficient to confer the DFPM response in the Ler background. Consistent with QTL analyses of the Col-0 × Ler RILs, F2 seedlings of a Col-0 cross to Ler segregated at a ratio of 3:1 (P value of χ2 test is 0.665, n = 178), indicating that a single locus mediates the VICTR phenotype. Using these segregating VICTR F2 plants, map-based cloning narrowed down the candidate VICTR locus to a 100-kb region (Figures 2A and 2B). Since VICTR is a natural variant present in Col-0, any polymorphic gene within the target region could encode VICTR. Because VICTRCol was necessary and sufficient for the DFPM response and was hypothesized to represent an active allele, T-DNA insertion mutants of genes located within the target region in Col-0 were examined. Among the T-DNA lines tested, only T-DNA insertion lines in gene At5g46520 displayed complete insensitivity in DFPM-mediated root growth arrest (Figures 2C and 2D). Five independent T-DNA insertion mutants in the Col-0 At5g46520 gene showed loss of DFPM-triggered root arrest. DFPM inhibits primary root growth in Col-0 but not in the victr mutants. To determine how DFPM mediates this effect, confocal images of Col-0, victr-1, and victr-2 primary roots were analyzed (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). While the quiescent center cells and cortical stem cells appeared unaffected by 24 h of DFPM treatment in all three genotypes, the division zone of the DFPM-treated Col-0 primary roots was smaller than that of the victr-1 and victr-2 primary roots. To further analyze this phenotype, we quantified the number of meristematic cells in the division zones of primary roots (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Our data indicate that when treated with DFPM for 24 h, Col-0 primary roots show a reduced number of meristem cells in the division zone of the primary root compared with victr-1 and victr-2. This shorter division zone and the reduced number of meristematic cells are consistent with the inhibition of primary root growth first observable after 24 h of DFPM treatment in Col-0 wild type and may represent the initial phase of DFPM-induced growth inhibition. The most similar gene to VICTR, VICTR Like1 (VICTL1; At5g46510), is located in tandem upstream of VICTR (Figure 2C; see Supplemental Figure 4B and Supplemental Data Set 1 online). A T-DNA mutant victl1-1 was not resistant to DFPM treatment in the root growth arrest response (see Supplemental Figure 4C online). This suggests that the VICTRCol (At5g46520) gene is required for the chemical DFPM response targeting primary root meristem activity. Chemical genetics can provide an approach for identifying phenotypes in potentially redundant signal transduction genes via small molecule targeting of specific proteins (CITATION). VICTR is predicted to encode a previously uncharacterized member of the NB-LRR family with a TIR motif (TIR-NB-LRR) at the N terminus (Figure 2E). TIR-NB-LRR family members can function as immune signaling proteins encoded by R genes responding to specific pathogen effectors in plants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Compared with characterized R proteins, the predicted VICTRCol protein shows high sequence similarity to that of At1g31540 (64.9% amino acid identity) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), the Col-0 allele of RAC1 from accession Ksk-1, which mediates PAD4-independent resistance to Albugo candida (CITATION). VICTRCol is in the same cluster of R genes as RPS6 (At5g46470; see Supplemental Figure 4B online) that specifies resistance to the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopA1 (CITATION). To determine whether VICTRCol contains unique polymorphism(s) that define the Col-0 sensitivity to DFPM, VICTR cDNA sequences from other accessions were reverse transcribed and compared with VICTRCol. The VICTR gene is highly diverged and possibly absent in Ler (CITATION) and also in Wassilewskija-0 (Ws-0) based on PCR analysis (see Supplemental Figure 4E online). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences in the VICTR-containing ecotypes, Bay-0 and Kin-0, shows that VICTRCol has multiple unique amino acid polymorphisms centered in the NB domain and the linker region between the NB and LRR domains (Figure 2E; see Supplemental Figure 5A and Supplemental Data Set 2 online). The promoter sequences of the VICTR genes are highly conserved (see Supplemental Figure 5B and Supplemental Data Set 2 online). To further establish whether DFPM-induced primary root growth inhibition in Col-0 is dependent on polymorphisms present in the coding region of VICTRCol, the VICTRCol gene expressed under the control of its natural Col-0 promoter was introduced into accessions insensitive to DFPM: Ler, C24, and Bay-0. The introduction of VICTRCol was sufficient to generate the DFPM response in primary roots of Ler, C24, and Bay-0, demonstrating that VICTRCol is the only missing component required for the DFPM-induced primary root growth arrest in these accessions (Figure 3A). As reported for other R proteins, ectopic 35S:VICTRCol expression in the Col-0 background caused stunted plant growth (see Supplemental Figure 1D online). [[FIGURE]] Resistance genes are generally expressed ubiquitously and at very low levels in unchallenged plants. Electronic Arabidopsis gene expression resources, including AtGenExpress and eFP Browser indicate that VICTR is expressed at a low level in many different tissue types (CITATION; CITATION). Interestingly, when treated with DFPM for 24 h, VICTR was highly induced (eightfold) in the Col-0 background (Figure 3B). Bay-0 and C24, which carry a polymorphic VICTR gene relative to VICTRCol but are not sensitive to DFPM, did not exhibit enhancement of VICTR expression in response to DFPM treatment (Figure 3B). More detailed analyses of VICTRCol promoter driven-GUS (for β-glucuronidase) reporter and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter lines showed dramatic DFPM-enhanced expression of the VICTR gene in the root meristematic zone (Figures 3C and 3D). These results suggest that the DFPM-induced root growth arrest may be caused by differential spatial upregulation of VICTR expression in the primary root tip region. Notably, induction of the VICTR gene by DFPM treatment requires functional VICTRCol because DFPM could not induce the VICTRCol promoter in the victr-1 mutant (Figure 3D, middle panels). On the other hand, the promoter of VICTRBay, whose sequence is highly similar to that of VICTRCol (see Supplemental Figure 5B and Supplemental Data Set 2 online), activated YFP expression by DFPM treatment when introduced into the Col-0 wild type (Figure 3D, bottom panels). Altogether, these results suggest that functional VICTR mediates DFPM-induced positive feedback regulation of VICTR expression and that amino acid polymorphism(s) in VICTRCol are responsible for the VICTR phenotype. Consistent with this, Bay-0 expressing VICTRCol under the VICTRCol promoter exhibited DFPM-mediated root growth arrest (Figure 3A) and also increased VICTR expression upon DFPM treatment (Figure 3B). Such positive feedback regulation has been observed for R genes and is part of the resistance response induced by corresponding avirulent pathogens (CITATION). The finding that VICTR encodes a TIR-NB-LRR family R-like protein and previous indications that DFPM induces defense-related gene expression (CITATION) raise the hypothesis that pathogen-triggered biotic stress signaling and/or salicylic acid (SA) signaling is responsible for generation of the VICTR root growth arrest phenotype. To test this hypothesis and to identify additional genetic components of the DFPM-mediated signaling pathway, pathogen mutants in Col-0 were analyzed to determine whether they exhibit altered root growth responses to DFPM. Among the mutants analyzed, eds1-2 (CITATION), eds1-23, and pad4-1 (CITATION) mutations disrupted the DFPM-induced root growth arrest, as did the eds1-2 pad4-1 double mutant (Figure 4A; see Supplemental Figure 4A online). No DFPM resistance was observed in eds5-1 and eds16-1. [[FIGURE]] EDS1 and PAD4 are also required for DFPM inhibition of ABA-induced stomatal closure (CITATION). Therefore, victr-1 and victr-2 mutants were analyzed for the ability of DFPM to impair ABA-induced stomatal closing in genotype blind assays. Both victr-1 and victr-2 plants showed impairment in DFPM inhibition of ABA-induced stomatal closing (Figure 4B). To investigate the subcellular localization of VICTR, YFP or GFP fluorophores were fused to either its N or C terminus. All constructs showed that VICTRCol localized to the nucleus with localization also in the cytoplasm as indicated by faint fluorescence in transient onion (Allium cepa) epidermis expression assays (see Supplemental Figure 4D online). Arabidopsis TIR-NB-LRR proteins, such as RPS4 and RPS6, also display nucleocytoplasmic distributions (CITATION; CITATION). In transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated overexpression and immunological detection of the VICTR constructs in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, VICTR fusion protein levels were low but detectable based on GFP fluorescence and immunoblots (Figure 5). In N. benthamiana expression analyses, we coexpressed red fluorescent protein (RFP) constructs, allowing us to clearly identify transformed cells, visualize nuclei, and perform colocalization analyses. The GFP-VICTR fusion protein was preferentially nuclear localized, and GFP-VICTR fluorescence merged with nuclear RFP (Figure 5A). Although >70% of cells showed RFP expression, GFP-VICTR was detected in only 15 to 20% of transformed cells. Immunoblot analyses identified GFP-VICTR fusions at the expected size (∼160 kD), suggesting that the detected fluorescence is not due to either GFP alone or GFP fused to truncated VICTR (Figure 5B). [[FIGURE]] The requirement for EDS1 and PAD4 in DFPM-dependent root inhibition prompted us to investigate in vivo protein complex associations of VICTR with these proteins. Recent studies have shown that the TIR-NB-LRR resistance proteins RPS4 and RPS6 coreside in protein complexes with EDS1 (CITATION; CITATION). Pathogen effectors that might signal VICTR-dependent primary root growth arrest are presently not known and effectors that cause root growth arrest have not yet been determined. Such putative effectors may also redundantly use the tandem repeat homolog VICTL1. Identification of molecular interactors of VICTR is relevant toward understanding VICTR protein functions. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), an efficient tool to study in vivo protein–protein interactions, can be used to identify molecular complexes of key innate immunity components (CITATION). An inherent feature of this assay is its irreversibility, allowing capture of transient interactions. Confocal microscopy analysis of transiently expressed BiFC fusion combinations of VICTR with PAD4 or EDS1 in N. benthamiana cells suggested nuclear complexes of VICTR with these two proteins (Figure 6). VICTR did not show associations with the reciprocal BiFC vectors expressing GUS that also accumulated inside nuclei (see Supplemental Figure 6A online). Heterodimers of EDS1-PAD4 display nucleocytoplasmic distributions (CITATION). However, our BiFC results cannot distinguish whether VICTR associates with EDS1-PAD4 heterodimer-including complexes or within protein complexes individually with EDS1 or PAD4 proteins, which warrants further investigations. Our results suggest cocomplex formation of a TIR-NB-LRR protein with the EDS1 signaling partner PAD4. This is in marked contrast with the TIR-NB-LRR R proteins RPS4 and RPS6, which did not show an interaction with PAD4 in transient expression assays (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] We independently investigated the above results by performing coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays on transiently transformed N. benthamiana cells (Figure 7A). N-terminally hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged VICTR (HA-VICTR) was coexpressed either with cMyc-tagged-EDS1, -PAD4 or -GUS. Because VICTR expression was enriched in the nucleus, we isolated purified nuclei from the infiltrated leaf tissues and performed nuclear co-IP assays. Both EDS1 and PAD4, but not GUS, coimmunoprecipitated with VICTR (Figure 7A and 7C). These results validated the associations of VICTR with EDS1 and PAD4 proteins in nuclei detected by BiFC (Figure 6). [[FIGURE]] Using a mutated EDS1, eds1L262P, that does not heterodimerize with PAD4 (CITATION), we tested whether VICTR associates with EDS1-PAD4 heterodimers or individually with EDS1. As expected, the eds1L262P mutant showed a strongly diminished interaction with PAD4 in transient N. benthamiana BiFC assays (Figure 7B). We then performed co-IP assays on transiently transformed N. benthamiana cells (Figure 7C). N-terminally HA epitope-tagged VICTR (HA-VICTR) was coexpressed either with cMyc-tagged PAD4, -EDS1, -eds1L262P, or -GUS. Purified nuclei from the infiltrated leaf tissues were isolated and nuclear co-IP assays performed. EDS1 wild-type, eds1L262P, and PAD4, but not GUS, coimmunoprecipitated with VICTR (Figure 7C), supporting that VICTR can form complexes with EDS1 and PAD4 inside nuclei. Senescence Associated Gene101 (SAG101) has also been shown to form a protein complex with EDS1 (CITATION; CITATION). As eds1-2 and pad4-1 loss-of-function mutants showed a strong DFPM insensitivity, we tested sag101-2 loss-of-function mutants (CITATION) for the DFPM-induced root growth arrest response. In contrast with eds1-2, pad4-1, and eds1-2 pad4-1, sag101-2 mutant plants behaved like Col-0 wild-type controls (Figure 8C). Thus, we propose that DFPM may trigger root growth inhibition by activating an SAG101-independent branch of EDS1-PAD4 signaling. [[FIGURE]] The HSP90 chaperones functionally stabilize and maintain R proteins in a signaling-competent state, and their activity is dependent on at least two different cochaperones, RAR1 and SGT1B (CITATION). In root assays, the single mutants rar1-21 (CITATION) and sgt1b/eta3 (CITATION) exhibited DFPM insensitivity (Figure 8A). Since the Arabidopsis genome contains four cytosolic HSP90 isoforms, with three located in close proximity within a 12-kb region on chromosome 5 (CITATION), the effect of the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GDA) on the DFPM response was analyzed. GDA inhibits cancer cell proliferation by irreversibly binding to the N terminus of HSP90 proteins (CITATION). A concentration of 5 µM GDA was sufficient to completely abolish Col-0 specific DFPM root growth inhibition (Figure 8B), consistent with the observed DFPM resistance of rar1-21 and sgt1b/eta3 (Figure 8A). This suggests that HSP90 cooperates with RAR1 and SGT1B to stabilize VICTR as a prerequisite for the DFPM root growth response. The eds5-1 mutant defective in SA biosynthesis (CITATION) and a SA-depleted 35S:nahG transgenic line (CITATION) were not affected in the DFPM-induced root growth response (Figure 4A). With the exception of the resistance signaling components described above, other known pathogen response loci were also not required for the DFPM-induced root growth arrest. These include the NB-LRR genes RPS2, RPM1, and RPS4, immune signaling and response components NPR1, NPR3-NPR4, PAD3, and PMR4, and a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptor, FLS2, as well as the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling components COI1 and JAI1/JIN1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) (Figure 8C). Although application of exogenous SA also caused root growth inhibition (see Supplemental Figure 7A online), detailed inspection showed that the SA effect on root growth inhibition is morphologically clearly distinct from the DFPM-induced root growth arrest in several respects. SA blocks general growth of Arabidopsis seedlings (CITATION), including root elongation, lateral root initiation, and root hair formation (see Supplemental Figure 7B online), in contrast with DFPM (e.g., Figure 4A; see Supplemental Figure 2B online). Also, the SA-induced root growth inhibition is not accession specific because the response to SA was equivalent in Col-0 and Ler.
!~MM~! DFPM (ID 6015316) was isolated from screening of 9600 compounds in ChemBridge’s DIVERSet E library. DFPM (ID 6015316), DFPM-1 (ID 5649754), DFPM-2 (ID 5872683), DFPM-3 (ID 6881095), DFPM-5 (ID 6017927), and DFPM-7 (ID 5143713) were purchased from ChemBridge. Transgenic reporter lines were in the Col-0 background or were crossed into the Col-0 background. Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA lines were obtained from the ABRC (Ohio State University). Arabidopsis ecotype set CS22660, victr-1 (Salk_123918), victr-2 (Salk_084068), victr-3 (Salk_072727), victr-4 (Salk_122941), victr-5 (Sail_394_F01), victl1-1 (Salk_097845), eds1-23 (Salk_057149), and Caroline Dean’s 100 Col × Ler RILs (CS1899) (CITATION; CITATION) were obtained from the ABRC (Ohio State University). The eds1-23 T-DNA mutant (Salk_057149) has a T-DNA insertion in At3g48090, one of a tandem pair of EDS1 homologs in accession Col-0. Another T-DNA insertion mutant (Salk_071051) in the same gene, denoted eds1-22, substantially rescues the growth phenotype of bon1-1 constitutive resistance plants (CITATION). pDR5:GFP, pPIN1:PIN1:GFP, and pPIN2:PIN2:GFP were kindly provided by Yunde Zhao (University of California at San Diego). pSCR:GFP and pCyclinB1:GUS were kindly provided by Jeff Long (Salk Institute) and Jeff Harper (Univ. of Nevada), respectively. Mutants eds1-2 (CITATION) and sag101-2 (CITATION), pad4-1 and pmr4-1 (CITATION), rar1-21 (CITATION), eta3/sgt1b (CITATION), fls2 (CITATION), eds5-1 (CITATION) 35S:nahG line (CITATION), and npr3-2npr4-2 (CITATION) were kindly provided by Jane Glazebrook (University of Minnesota), Jeff Dangl (University of North Carolina), William Gray (University of Minnesota), Shauna Somerville (University of California at Berkeley), Sheng Yang He (University of Michigan), Mary Wildermuth (University of California at Berkeley), and Xin Li (University of British Columbia, Canada), respectively. Sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on general growth medium (1% Suc, 0.5× Murashige and Skoog [MS] salts, 0.05% MES, and 0.8% plant agar, pH 5.8) after 2 d of stratification and vertically grown for 10 d before transfer to new plates containing the indicated chemicals. After transfer onto new plates, the end of each root was marked as a starting point, and root growth arrest was monitored after 6 d. Root morphology and GUS staining were examined by differential interference contrast microscopy (Leica DM5000B), and fluorescence reporter lines were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Nikon TE2000U) with propidium iodide staining. Col-0, PIN1:GFP, and PIN2:GFP plants were grown vertically in half-strength MS medium containing 1% Suc for 5 d and transferred to 10 μM DFPM half-strength MS medium. At the indicated time, primary roots were stained with propidium iodide and observed using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with spectral settings for excitation at 488 nm/emission at 493 to 555 nm for the GFP signal and excitation 514 nm and emission at 596 to 719 nm for propidium iodide. A constant gain value was used for each genotype. For root meristem cell quantification, Col-0, victr-1, and victr-2 plants were prepared as described above. Meristem cells in the division zone were counted using Image J (CITATION). A single file of cortex cells was analyzed in all roots. The division zone was defined as the region made up of isodiametric cells between the quiescent center up to the cell, which was twice the length of the cell immediately before it (CITATION). analysis of variance and Tukey test statistical analyses were conducted using the Origin-Pro version 8.6 package. Ten seedlings per genotype and treatment were analyzed. For initial mapping and QTL analyses, the DFPM-induced VICTR phenotype was scored on the 100 Col × Ler RILs. QTL analyses were performed using QTL package (version 1.11-12) that uses R software (version 2.81) based on the QTL package manual (CITATION). Parameters used for LOD estimation were step = 1 and error probability = 0.01. Haldane map function was used as a mapping algorithm. Genotyping information of each Col × Ler RILs was retrieved from the microarray-based physical genomic mapping data set (CITATION). For marker-based cloning of the VICTRCol locus, the recessive Ler root development phenotype was screened from a mapping population of ∼2000 F2 plants of Col crosses to Ler. The VICTRCol locus was mapped to an ∼5-centimorgan interval on the lower arm of chromosome 5 based on linkage to PCR-based markers 18.1 Mb (5′-GTCGTAGAAGTAGCAGCTTGTACGAAGT-3′/5′-TCTCAATCCAATGTTCAGGTGACACACT-3′) and 19.1 Mb (5′-GAATCTCTAACGATGCTAACACAAGGA-3′/5′-CTGCAATCACAGTTTAAGTCATGAACT-3′). Within the 100-kb region defined by markers 18.86 and 18.95 Mb, 21 T-DNA insertion lines targeting 14 genes among 18 predicted genes (At5g46490 to At5g46650) were analyzed for the root VICTR phenotype. Deletion of VICTR in certain ecotypes (see Supplemental Figure 4 online) was examined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA templates using LA Taq and Ex Taq polymerases (Takara Bio). Control primers are 5′-ATGGTTGCGATACCCAATATTAAGA-3′ and 5′-CTAAAGGATCTCTCCTTCCTCAAGATCGT-3′. Internal primers are 5′-CGGGTAGAAATATTGTACGCTCACAGT-3′ and 5′-CCAAATGGTTGAGAGTCAGATGTTC-3′. Note that internal primers anneal to both VICTR and VICTL1. External primers are 5′-GGACGCTTTGTTTCCAGCTTGTGGGGCATTAAATCGAG-3′ and 5′-CACTTCGTAGGGCGTTGGGGCAGACATTGCCTTCTC-3′. To generate VICTR promoter-driven reporter lines, a 2.5-kb fragment from the start codon of Col-0 and Bay-0 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using primers (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGAGAACCAGTACACAATGGCAGGTAAG-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGAAGCCATAGAGAGAGTTAGAAGGAGGA-3′) and cloned into pBGGUS and pHGY (vector plasmids were kindly provided by Taku Demura from RIKEN) (CITATION). The VICTRCol gene was PCR amplified using primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGCCCTGTGGTATCTGGTAATCAAAATTCTGT-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTGGCTACAAAGCAAGTCAGTCGTTCGTTG-3′. The VICTRCol coding region for the 35S promoter driven transgenic line was PCR amplified using primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCCTCCTTCTAACTCTCTCTATGGCTTC-3′/5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCATATGAAGTGGTGTAGCTGCAAAAG-3′. For recapitulation of the Col-0 VICTR phenotype in Ler and C24, the VICTRCol gene including the promoter and coding region was inserted into pHGY. For generation of 35S promoter–driven VICTRCol transgenic lines, the VICTRCol coding region, including introns, was cloned into pH35GS. Transformed lines with empty vector were used as controls for phenotypic analyses. For subcellular localization analysis in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells (see Supplemental Figure 4D online), full-length VICTRCol cDNA was inserted into pH35GY and pH35YG to construct plasmids encoding VICTR-YFP and YFP-VICTR, respectively. Transient expression by biolistic bombardment (using PDS-1000/He; Bio-Rad) was performed in onion epidermal cells. VICTR cDNA in the entry vector (pENTR-TOPO-VICTR) was transferred via Clonase LR recombination system (Invitrogen) into the Gateway-compatible destination vector pMDC43 (CITATION), resulting in a GFP-VICTR expression vector. The RFP vector used in colocalization analysis was described earlier (CITATION). N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with the indicated Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains at an OD600 of 0.3 for each strain. Two days after infiltration, tissue sections from the infiltrated patches were analyzed by a two-photon equipped Zeiss confocal microscope. Three 7-mm-diameter leaf punches were excised from the infiltrated tissues and ground in 100 μL of 8 M urea and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). The pENTR-TOPO-VICTR clone was recombined into the Gateway-compatible BiFC vectors pMDC-nVenus or pMDC-cCFP (CITATION) using the Clonase LR recombination system. BiFC vectors for EDS1, PAD4, and GUS expression were used as in previous studies (CITATION). Agroinfiltration and confocal microscopy analysis were performed as indicated earlier. For fusion protein detection, three 7-mm-diameter leaf discs were excised from the infiltrated patches, ground in 8 M urea and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HA-tagged VICTR was generated using pENTR-TOPO-VICTR and the destination vector HA-pBA (CITATION). Myc-tagged EDS1, PAD4, and GUS have been used before (CITATION). The eds1L262P mutant described by CITATION was generated by overlap PCR using the primers 5′-TTCCCTGAGCTAAGTCCTTATA-3′ and 5′-GCTCAGGGAAACTAGAAAGGGT-3′ and replacing the wild-type fragment in the entry clone of EDS1. Myc-eds1L262P was generated by Clonase recombining the entry clone into the Myc-pBA binary vector. Agrobacterium-infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves were processed for nuclear extracts as described by CITATION. The resulting nuclear lysates were centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min to remove nuclear debris. Immunoprecipitation was performed as published before (CITATION). The immunoprecipitates and the input fractions were analyzed with anti-HA (Roche) or anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Col-0, C24, Bay-0, and one line of Bay-0 expressing VICTRCol-0 were grown in half-strength MS media for 14 d and were transferred to half-strength MS containing 10 μM DFPM. After 24 h of DFPM treatment, total RNA was extracted, and real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantify the transcript levels of VICTR. Primers were designed with QuantPrime (CITATION): VICTR-qRT2-F, 5′-AGAGACCGGTTCATCAGCAGAG-3′;VICTR-qRT2-R, 5′-CCATATTGCCTTCTTCGGCTTGAG-3′. Amplified samples were normalized against PDF2 levels: PDF2_F, 5′-TAACGTGGCCAAAATGATGC-3′; PDF2_R, 5′-GTTCTCCACAACCGCTTGGT-3′. Stomatal aperture measurements were performed as described before (CITATION; CITATION). Student’s t tests were performed for n = 3 independent experiments with 42 to 50 stomata analyzed for each condition.
