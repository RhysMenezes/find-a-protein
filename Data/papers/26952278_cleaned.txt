!~ABS~! As the start of a new life cycle, activation of the first division of the zygote is a critical event in both plants and animals. Because the zygote in plants is difficult to access, our understanding of how this process is achieved remains poor. Here we report genetic and cell biological analyses of the zygote-arrest 1 (zyg1) mutant in Arabidopsis, which showed zygote-lethal and over-accumulation of cyclin B1 D-box-GUS in ovules. Map-based cloning showed that ZYG1 encodes the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) subunit 11 (APC11). Live-cell imaging studies showed that APC11 is expressed in both egg and sperm cells, in zygotes and during early embryogenesis. Using a GFP-APC11 fusion construct that fully complements zyg1, we showed that GFP-APC11 expression persisted throughout the mitotic cell cycle, and localized to cell plates during cytokinesis. Expression of non-degradable cyclin B1 in the zygote, or mutations of either APC1 or APC4, also led to a zyg1-like phenotype. Biochemical studies showed that APC11 has self-ubiquitination activity and is able to ubiquitinate cyclin B1 and promote degradation of cyclin B1. These results together suggest that APC/C-mediated degradation of cyclin B1 in Arabidopsis is critical for initiating the first division of the zygote.
!~RES~! Forty additional zygote-lethal mutants were identified by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy examination of embryo-lethal ovules from a population of approximately 5000 A. thaliana (Col-0) M2 plants mutagenized by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treatment as described in Xu et al. (CITATION). In these mutants at least a fraction of embryos were arrested at the single-cell zygote stage. Since homozygous ovules are lethal, all these mutants were maintained in a heterozygous state. After backcrossing to Col-0 for at least three generations, detailed phenotypic analyses were performed in these mutants. The zyg1 mutant was notable as it exhibited a cell cycle arrest phenotype (see below). In aborted zyg1 ovules, 46.0% showed developmental arrest of the embryo at the single-cell zygote stage (n = 463), while others continued to one to three cycles of cell division before abortion. These arrested zygotes were mostly elongated and had visible cell walls (Figure 1b; indicated by an open arrowhead). [[FIGURE]] Genetic analyses showed that 25.5% of the ovules (n = 353) in zyg1/+ siliques were aborted, suggesting that the zyg1 phenotype is caused by a single-gene recessive mutation, and the presence of either a maternal or a paternal ZYG1 allele is sufficient to initiate zygote division. Reciprocal crosses between zyg1/+ and Col-0 showed that transmission through the male was reduced slightly while through the female it was reduced significantly, especially in zyg1-2 (Table 1), indicating that ZYG1 plays a role in both microsporogenesis and megasporogenesis. The P-value represents the probabilities for unbiased 100% transmissions. P < 0.05 indicates that the transmission efficiency was compromised. To characterize the defects in zyg1, we introduced the CYCB1;1D-box-uidA [cyclin B1;1 destruction box (D-box) fused with a β-glucuronidase (GUS; gene uidA)] reporter construct (Colón-Carmona et al., CITATION) to zyg1/+ by crossing. As reported before, the CYCB1;1D-box-GUS fusion protein is subjected to degradation at the cell cycle transition from metaphase to anaphase, and thus cells with GUS staining are about to exit mitosis (Colón-Carmona et al., CITATION). The GUS activity in ovules excised from zyg1/+ plants carrying a homozygous CYCB1;1D-box-uidA transgene was assessed. Results showed that, in the wild-type plants, GUS staining was only observed in 1.8% of ovules (n > 200) collected when embryos were at the pre-globular stage. However, GUS staining was observed in 19.3% (n > 200) of arrested zyg1 ovules examined at the same stage (Figure 1c,d). In addition, GUS staining in arrested zyg1 ovules was more intense than in the wild type (Figure 1e,f). Such a CYCB1;1D-box-GUS over-accumulation phenotype was observed in aborted ovules from zyg1/+ (94.4%, n = 72; Figure 1f) but rarely in wild-type-looking ones in the same silique (2.5% n = 204; Figure 1e). These results suggest a cell cycle defect in defective zyg1 ovules. Using a population of approximately 2000 F2 plants obtained from a cross between zyg1/+ (Col-0) and a plant of the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype, ZYG1 was mapped to a 96-kb interval on chromosome 3. We screened T-DNA insertion lines of all 31 annotated genes in this region and found that Salk_019654, with a T-DNA inserted into the second intron of the annotated At3g05870 (Figure 2a), showed a similar zygote-lethal phenotype as zyg1. We sequenced the genomic region of the gene in zyg1/+ and identified a G to A point mutation that converted a highly conserved cysteine (C) residue to tyrosine (Y) (Figure 2b). Reciprocal crosses between zyg1/+ and Salk_019654 failed to complement the mutant phenotype in the F1 generation, indicating that these two mutations are allelic. Accordingly, zyg1 and Salk_019654 were re-named zyg1-1 and zyg1-2, respectively. [[FIGURE]] After sequencing the ZYG1 transcript from cDNA prepared from the wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, we found that the intron–exon structure prediction for APC11 in the TAIR and GenBank databases was inaccurate, with the presence of a single-nucleotide exon missing and the inclusion of a 9-bp intronic sequence in the cDNA (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information; Guo and Liu, CITATION). As illustrated in Figure 2(a), the corrected ZYG1 gene encodes a 252-bp transcript, producing an 84-amino-acid (aa) polypeptide that showed high sequence similarity to APC11 proteins from rice (OsAPC11), maize (ZmAPC11), Physcomitrella patens (PpAPC11), human (HsAPC11), zebrafish (DrAPC11) and Talaromyces marneffei (TmAPC11) (Capron et al., CITATION; Figure 2b). APC11 is a single gene in the Arabidopsis genome, which shares 36% sequence identity at the amino acid level with AtRBX1, a component in the Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) protein complex (Figure 2b; Gray et al., CITATION; Lechner et al., CITATION). To confirm if the mutation in APC11 is responsible for the zyg1 phenotype, we generated pAPC11:GFP-APC11:tAPC11 and pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 constructs, with the green fluorescence protein gene (GFP) inserted in-frame, respectively, to the N- or C-terminus of the APC11 coding region. The APC11 fragment used consists of 1506-bp 5′ upstream (pAPC11), 839-bp coding and 648-bp 3′ downstream sequences (tAPC11). These constructs were transformed to the wild-type A. thaliana (Col-0). Several single-insertion lines with detectable GFP expression were obtained and crossed to zyg1-1/+ plants. Among the F2 progenies obtained, we identified homozygous zyg1-1/zyg1-1 plants carrying either pAPC11:GFP-APC11:tAPC11 or pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11. Detailed examination of these plants revealed neither zygote- nor embryo-lethal phenotypes, suggesting that these fusion constructs are functional and able to complement the zyg1-1 phenotype. To access the expression of ZYG1, transgenic plants carrying either pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 or pAPC11:APC11-uidA:tAPC11 (made by replacing the GFP gene in pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 with uidA) were examined. As shown in Figure 3, ZYG1 expression was observed in embryos at all stages examined (Figure 3a–g), while uidA expression in the endosperm was restricted to early stage ovules and declined when embryos reached the torpedo stage (Figure 3e–g). During vegetative growth, uidA expression was observed in all meristematic tissues examined, in particular shoot and root apices (Figure 3h,i) and lateral root primordia (Figure 3j; indicated by an arrowhead). Confocal microscopic examination showed that in pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 transgenic plants GFP expression was observed in both embryo proper and suspensor cells (Figure 3a–d). Within these cells, the GFP signal was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 3a–d), as reported previously (Roodbarkelari et al., CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To define APC11 expression more accurately, we replaced the GFP in pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 with a nucleus-localized SV40-3×GFP, to produce pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11. Transformation and progeny analyses showed that the pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11 construct is also able to complement the zyg1-1 mutant, producing wild-type-appearing plants in the zyg1-1/zyg1-1 background. In these transgenic plants, GFP expression was detected from the tetrad stage to mature microspores during microsporogenesis (Figure 4a–e). In mature and germinating pollen, GFP expression was only observed in sperm cells (Figure 4d,e; indicated by red arrowheads) and barely in the vegetative nucleus (indicated by a white arrowhead). During megasporogenesis, GFP expression was continuously observed from megaspore mother cells to the mature embryo sac (Figure 4h–m). [[FIGURE]] To access the expression of APC11 during double fertilization, pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11 transgenic plants were used to pollinate transgenic plants carrying egg-cell-specific pEC1:H2B-RFP (Ingouff et al., CITATION). Under a confocal microscope, we observed the release of GFP-labeled sperm (Figure 4n–p; indicated with ‘s’) into the embryo sac at 5 h after pollination (HAP). At a slightly later stage (approximately 6 HAP), fusion of the red fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled egg cell with GFP-labeled sperm was observed, producing a zygote with both green and red fluorescence (Figure 4q–s; indicated with ‘z’). Concurrently, the fusion of non-labeled central nucleus with the other GFP-labeled sperm led to the formation of a nucleus with green fluorescence (Figure 4q–s; indicated with ‘c’). The Mendelian segregation of the recessive zyg1 phenotype suggests that both maternal and paternal APC11 alleles are active in zygotes. To confirm this at the transcriptional level, reciprocal crosses between homozygous pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11 and the wild-type (Col-0) plants showed that, indeed, GFP expression was observed in both the zygote and the central nucleus immediately after fertilization, no matter whether the transgenic plant was used as male or female parent (Figure 5a,d; endosperm nuclei, white arrowheads). When examined at about 8 HAP with pollens from pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11 plants, 78.6% (n = 94) zygotes showed GFP fluorescence. Similarly, when pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11 plants were pollinated with wild-type pollen and examined in the same manner, a similar ratio of GFP-positive zygotes (76.2%, n = 106) was observed. Considering the variations in fertilization time in different ovules and the detectability of the GFP signal, we believe that APC11 is expressed in zygotes immediately after fertilization. [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that several APC/C proteins exhibit dynamic changes in localization during the cell cycle (Blilou et al., CITATION; Capron et al., CITATION; Fülöp et al., CITATION; Pérez-Pérez et al., CITATION; Eloy et al., CITATION; Wang et al., CITATION). To find out if this is the case for APC11, we crossed mCherry-TUA5 transgenic plants (Gutierrez et al., CITATION) with pAPC11:GFP-APC11:tAPC11 plants. mCherry-TUA5 decorated cytoskeletal configurations (Figure 6a′–e′) such as cortical microtubules (Figure 6a′), pre-prophase band (Figure 6b′), mitotic spindle (Figure 6c′) and phragmoplast (Figure 6d′,e′) in root meristematic cells. We observed that in cells at the interphase (Figure 6a), prophase (Figure 6b) and metaphase (Figure 6c), GFP-APC11 fluorescence was distributed in both the cytosol and nucleus, as reported previously (Roodbarkelari et al., CITATION). However, during anaphase and telophase, in addition to the cytosolic localization, GFP-APC11 was observed in the mid-plane of the forming cell plate (Figure 6d,e; indicated by red arrowheads), indicating a role of APC11 in cytokinesis. [[FIGURE]] To address if APC11 has E3 ligase activity, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed. A glutathione S-transferase-tagged APC11 (GST-APC11) construct was made and transformed to Escherichia coli to purify the GST-APC11, and the GST without APC11 was produced and purified as a control. When GST-APC11 was incubated in vitro with His-tagged ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (His-E1) from wheat, His-tagged ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 (His-E2) from human and His-tagged ubiquitin 14 (His-Ub) from Arabidopsis (Zhao et al., CITATION), polyubiquitination of APC11 was observed after 30-min incubations and detected with either anti-His (Figure 7a) or anti-GST (Figure 7b) antibodies (right panels, indicated by arrowheads). Such a polyubiquitination was not observed in the control reaction with GST (Figure 7a,b; left panels). The polyubiquitination was saturated after 60 min, as the number and intensity of those ubiquitination bands did not increase further when the incubation time was extended (Figure 7a,b; right panels). These polyubiquitination bands were not observed when either His-E1, His-E2, His-Ub or GST-APC11 was omitted from the reaction (Figure 7c,d; indicated by arrowheads), no matter what anti-His (Figure 7c) or anti-GST antibodies (Figure 7d) were used. These results suggest that, in the presence of E1, E2 and ubiquitin, APC11 is able to execute self-polyubiquitination. [[FIGURE]] We next addressed whether the Arabidopsis APC11 is able to ubiquitinate and promote cyclin B1;1 degradation. A His-CYCB1;1-Myc construct was made, with the cyclin B1;1 cDNA from Arabidopsis fused with a N-terminal His-tag and a C-terminal 4×Myc-tag, and transformed to E. coli. A His-CYCB1;1-Myc fusion protein was purified using a Ni-agarose column. An in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed using His-E1, His-E2, His-Ub, His-CYCB1;1-Myc and GST-APC11. Polyubiquitination of the His-CYCB1;1-Myc was detected using an anti-Myc antibody after incubation for 90 min (Figure 7e; right panel), and the intensity of these polyubiquitination bands was increased when the incubation time was extended to 120 min, while no polyubiquitination was detected when GST-APC11 was replaced by GST (Figure 7e; left panel). These results suggest that APC11 is able to ubiquitinate cyclin B1;1. We then addressed whether APC11 promotes degradation of cyclin B1;1. Constructs of p35S:GFP-APC11 and p35S:CYCB1;1-Myc, expressed under the CaMV 35S promoter, were made and transformed individually to Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by infiltrations (Liu et al., CITATION). The GFP-APC11 and CYCB1;1-Myc proteins extracted from these leaves were mixed and the stability of CYCB1;1-Myc was monitored by Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody. We observed that, in the presence of ATP, the CYCB1;1-Myc protein (Figure 7f; indicated by an arrowhead) was rapidly degraded in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, when MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, was added, the CYCB1;1-Myc protein was much more stable (Figure 7f). Although such degradation was also observed in the control treatment when ATP was replaced by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), it was much slower than the reaction with ATP (Figure 7f). These results suggest that APC11 is able to ubiquitinate cyclin B1;1 to promote degradation of cyclin B1;1. To address whether the zygote-lethal phenotype in zyg1 was caused by over-accumulation of cyclin B1;1, we changed the D-box in cyclin B1;1 from RQVLGDIGN to AQVAGDIGN through PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to generate CYCB1;1▵D-box, with a uidA reporter gene fused to its C-terminus. It has been shown that cyclin B1 with a mutated D-box is much more stable (Weingartner et al., CITATION). The pDD45:CYCB1;1▵D-box-uidA fusion construct made using an embryo-specific promoter pDD45 that is active from the zygote stage onwards (Steffen et al., CITATION) was transformed to A. thaliana (Col-0) using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION). The pDD45:CYCB1;1-uidA construct with the native cyclin B1;1 was made and transformed to A. thaliana (Col-0) as a control. Phenotypic analyses of T1 transgenic plants carrying pDD45:CYCB1;1▵D-box-uidA showed that, among 22 lines examined, six displayed an embryo-lethal phenotype. Further analyses in one of these lines under a DIC microscope revealed that 26.6% of ovules (n > 200) in siliques carried embryos arrested at the zygote stage, and 38.3% were at the two- to eight-cell stages. The zygote-lethal phenotype, with zygote elongation, resembled the zyg1 mutant. As a control, no such phenotype was observed in any of these lines among the 33 independent transgenic lines carrying pDD45:CYCB1;1-uidA that were examined (Figure 8c). The GUS assay revealed that strong GUS signals were consistently observed in ovules from plants carrying pDD45:CYCB1;1▵D-box-uidA (n > 200; Figure 8b), while only weak GUS staining was occasionally observed in ovules from pDD45:CYCB1;1-uidA plants (Figure 8a). The strong GUS staining is mostly observed in those small ovules from pDD45:CYCB1;1▵D-box-uidA transgenic plants with a zygote-lethal phenotype (Figure 8b), suggesting that compromised degradation of CYCB1;1▵D-box-GUS may have caused the zygote-lethal phenotype. [[FIGURE]] To find out if the zygote-lethal phenotype in zyg1 was caused by a general defect in APC/C, we re-examined ovules from apc1-1/+ and apc4-3/+. These mutants have been reported previously with defective female gametogenesis and embryogenesis but not a zygote-lethal phenotype (Wang et al., CITATION, CITATION). When ovules (n = 306) from of apc1-1/+ were cleared and examined under a DIC microscope 24.8% showed a female gamete defect and 15.7% were embryo-lethal; among these 22.9% were aborted at the zygote stage (Figure 8f; Table S1). Similarly, 28.6% of ovules (n = 238) were aborted before fertilization and 17.2% showed embryo-lethality; of these 24.4% were arrested at the zygote stage (Figure 8g; Table S1). These zygote-lethal phenotypes were indistinguishable from that of zyg1.
!~MM~! Plants of A. thaliana, ecotypes Col-0 and Ler, were grown at 21°C in a growth room with 16-h light (100 μmol photons m−2 sec−1) per day. A T-DNA insertion line, Salk_019654 (Col-0), was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (http://arabidopsis.info/). For mutagenesis, Col-0 seeds were treated with EMS (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) and screened for putative zygote-lethal mutants in M2 plants as described (Xu et al., CITATION). zyg1-1/+ was backcrossed to Col-0 for three generations before further analyses were carried out. For transmission analyses, the number of zyg1-1/+ and wild-type progeny were counted in BC1 populations after reciprocal crosses. The transmission frequency was calculated as the number of heterozygous plants/50% (total number of BC1 plants). Map-based cloning was performed in 2000 F2 progeny from a cross between zyg1-1/+ and Ler. A point mutation was detected after sequencing candidate genes in a zyg1-1/+ plant. For complementation and expression analyses, three constructs, pAPC11:GFP-APC11:tAPC11, pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 and pAPC11:APC11-uidA:tAPC11, were made using the full-length APC11 genomic sequence consisting of 1506-bp 5′ upstream, 839-bp coding region and 648-bp 3′ downstream sequences, with a GFP and uidA in-frame fused to the N- or C-terminus of APC11, respectively. pAPC11:APC11-SV40-3×GFP:tAPC11 was made by replacing the GFP in pAPC11:APC11-GFP:tAPC11 with the SV40-3×GFP (De Rybel et al., CITATION). These constructs were introduced to Arabidopsis (Col-0) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, CITATION). For in vitro biochemical analyses, the full-length APC11 cDNA was amplified from Col-0 seedlings using RT-PCR, and ligated to pGEX-6P-1 (GE, http://www3.gehealthcare.com/) and pBI121-35S-nGFP to make p35S:GST-APC11 and p35S:GFP-APC11, respectively. The coding sequence of cyclin B1;1 was amplified from Col-0 seedlings using RT-PCR and introduced to pBI121-35S-6×cMyc to make p35S:CYCB1;1-Myc. CYCB1;1-4×Myc was amplified from pBI121-35S-CYCB1;1-6×cMyc and ligated to pET48b(+) (Novagen, http://www.merckmillipore.com/) to generate His-CYCB1;1-Myc with a 4×Myc tag. For phenotypic analyses of non-degradable CYCB1;1▵D-box transgenic plants, cyclin B1;1 was introduced into pEASY-Blunt (TransGen, http://www.transgenbiotech.com/), and then the D-box RQVLGDIGN in cyclin B1;1 was mutated to AQVAGDIGN by PCR to make pEASY-Blunt-CYCB1;1▵D-box. For embryo-specific expression (pDD45:CYCB1;1-uidA; pDD45:CYCB1;1▵D-box-uidA), the PCR products of the 1020-bp DD45 promoter and CYCB1;1 or CYCB1;1▵D-box were inserted into pGreen II, with uidA fused in-frame. The primers used are listed in Table S2. Ovules at different stages were cleared and observed as reported (Yu et al., CITATION). A confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000MPE, Olympus, http://www.olympus-ims.com/) was used to examine GFP and mCherry expression in transgenic plants, with 488-nm and 543-nm excitation lasers, respectively. The GUS assay was performed as described (Xu et al., CITATION). In vitro ubiquitination assay was performed in a reaction consisting of 50 mm 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (TRIS)/HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, a crude extract of recombinant 6×His-tagged wheat E1 (GI: 136632), 500 ng of purified 6×His-tagged human E2 (UBCh5b), 2 μg of 6×His-tagged ubiquitin and 0.5–1 μg purified APC11-GST as described (Zhao et al., CITATION). Divided mixtures were incubated at 24°C for 30, 60, 90 or 120 min, terminated by adding a loading buffer containing SDS, and boiled for 5 min before gel analysis. Proteins were detected by Western blot and visualized under the Chemiluminescent Imaging System (Tanon-5200, http://www.biotanon.com/). For in vitro protein degradation assays, A. tumefaciens strains carrying GFP-APC11, GFP or CYCB1;1-Myc constructs were infiltrated to N. benthamiana leaves individually with p19 at a 1:1 ratio (Voinnet et al., CITATION). Three days after infiltration, proteins were extracted using a native extraction buffer [50 mm TRIS-MES (pH 8.0), 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, http://www.roche.com/)] (Liu et al., CITATION). The CYCB1;1-Myc was mixed with GFP-APC11 or GFP in a volume ratio of 1:1. 10 μm ATP or 50 μm MG132 was added to the reaction mixture to promote or inhibit the 26S proteasome activity, respectively. DMSO at a final concentration of 50 μm was used as the negative control. These mixtures were incubated at room temperature (24°C) with gentle shaking at different time points for Western blot analyses.
