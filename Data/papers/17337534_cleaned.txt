!~ABS~! Guard cell movement is induced by environmental and hormonal signals that cause changes in turgor through changes in uptake or release of solutes and water. Several transporters mediating these fluxes at the plasma membrane have been characterized; however, less is known about transport at endomembranes. CHX20, a member of a poorly understood cation/H+ exchanger gene family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), is preferentially and highly expressed in guard cells as shown by promoter∷β-glucuronidase activity and by whole-genome microarray. Interestingly, three independent homozygous mutants carrying T-DNA insertions in CHX20 showed 35% reduction in light-induced stomatal opening compared to wild-type plants. To test the biochemical function of CHX20, cDNA was expressed in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant that lacks Na+(K+)/H+ antiporters (Δnhx1 Δnha1 Δkha1) and plasma membrane Na+ pumps (Δena1-4). Curiously, CHX20 did not enhance tolerance of mutants to moderate Na+ or high K+ stress. Instead, it restored growth of the mutant on medium with low K+ at slightly alkaline pH, but had no effect on growth at acidic pH. Green fluorescent protein-tagged CHX20 expressed in mesophyll protoplasts was localized mainly to membranes of the endosomal system. Furthermore, light-induced stomatal opening of the Arabidopsis mutants was insensitive to external pH and was impaired at high KCl. The results are consistent with the idea that, in exchanging K+ for H+, CHX20 maintains K+ homeostasis and influences pH under certain conditions. Together, these results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that one CHX protein plays a critical role in osmoregulation through K+ fluxes and possibly pH modulation of an active endomembrane system in guard cells.
!~RES~! To obtain CHX20 (At3g53720) cDNA, total RNA was extracted from rosette leaves of 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants and first-strand cDNA was used to amplify the coding sequence. The primers at the start and end of the open reading frame (ORF; X20Cf and X20Cr; Supplemental Table S1) were designed based on the genomic sequence. A 2.5-kb fragment was amplified and its sequence (AY926476) matched the coding sequence that is formed from five exons (Fig. 1A ). [[FIGURE]] The predicted CHX20 protein of 842 residues has two domains: (1) a hydrophobic domain (434 residues) with 10 to 12 transmembrane spans at the amino half; and (2) a large hydrophilic domain of 403 residues at the carboxylic end (Fig. 1B). The hydrophobic domain shows extensive similarity (56.5% similarity, 33.6% identity; E value of 1e-54) to the transmembrane domain of yeast ScKHA1 protein, although the long carboxylic tail of the two proteins did not align (10.6% identity; no E value; Supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that the transport activities of AtCHX20 and yeast ScKHA1 are similar. To test the transport function of CHX20, the coding sequence was cloned in pYES-DEST52 yeast expression vector under the Gal promoter. Yeast mutants with disrupted kha1 gene alone exhibited no obvious phenotype (CITATION), so we expressed CHX20 in a yeast mutant (KTA40-2). This strain lacks functional vacuolar and PM-localized Na+/H+ antiporters, PM Na+ pumps (Δnhx1 Δnha1 and Δena1-4), as well as the putative K+/H+ exchanger (Δkha1; CITATION). Strain KTA40-2 is highly sensitive to salt and to high K+, so the transformant (KTA40-2-CHX20) was tested for its ability to grow on moderate levels of Na+ and very high K+. Surprisingly, mutant yeast expressing AtCHX20 was consistently more sensitive on media containing 100 mm Na+ or 500 mm K+ at various pH (Fig. 2A ) than the mutant yeast harboring the vector alone. KTA40-2 mutants grew as well as CHX20 transformants on standard synthetic complete (SC) medium. These results suggest that CHX20 does not confer tolerance to salt stress. [[FIGURE]] Intriguingly, AtCHX20 enhanced KTA40-2 yeast mutant growth on slightly basic medium with no added K+. At an external pH of 4.5 to 7.0, mutants grew relatively well with no added K+. In fact, at acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.5, mutants grew consistently better than yeast transformants carrying CHX20. Curiously, growth of mutants carrying the vector alone was retarded at pHext 7.5, whereas transformants harboring CHX20 continued to grow as well as at pH 4.5 (Fig. 2B). Thus, strains carrying CHX20 had an advantage when the external pH was 7.5, suggesting that CHX20 conferred an ability to sustain growth at slightly basic pH. We tested the effect of external K+ concentration on yeast growth at pH 7.5. Transformants harboring CHX20 consistently grew better than KTA40-2 mutants as long as the K+ level was kept low, from approximately 0.4 to 3 mm (Fig. 2C). When no exogenous K+ was added, the agar medium contained about 0.4 mm K+. Increasing external KCl concentration beyond 25 mm decreased the beneficial effect of CHX20. Because K+ is required to sustain growth of all cells, the enhanced growth of transformants at low K+ levels would suggest that CHX20 has a role in acquiring K+ when the external pH is slightly alkaline or in maintaining suitable cellular homeostasis for growth. This idea is supported by nearly similar growth exhibited by yeast mutants carrying either vector alone or CHX20 when K+ is raised to 50 mm. Yeast KHA1 was shown before to confer tolerance to hygromycin (CITATION) as confirmed here in the AXT3 strain (Fig. 3A ). This strain has a functional wild-type KHA1 but lacks three Na transporters (ena1-4Δ nha1Δ nhx1Δ). However, although transformants expressing CHX20 grew well at pH 5.5, they showed no growth in the presence of 150 μm hygromycin B. CHX20 did promote growth of mutants grown on yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium at pH 7.5 similar to yeast KHA1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that CHX20 and KHA1 share similar, but not identical, activities. [[FIGURE]] Analyses of a guard cell transcriptome (CITATION; J. Kwak, N. Leonhardt, and J.I. Schroeder, unpublished data) revealed that only one member of the CHX gene family was highly expressed in guard cells. CHX20 showed little or no expression in mesophyll cells, whereas several other genes, such as CHX17, showed low to moderate expression (Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, CHX20 expression is particularly strong in guard cells as shown by the 2-fold increase in normalized relative expression of CHX20 compared to that of AtKAT1, a K+ channel preferentially expressed in guard cells (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To verify the microarray results, CHX20 promoter-driven GUS activity was determined. Arabidopsis (Columbia [Col]) plants were transformed with a construct containing a 2-kb region upstream of the CHX20 ORF transcriptionally fused to the GUS reporter gene. T2 seeds were collected from six independent transgenic lines and all six lines of CHX20∷GUS analyzed gave similar expression patterns. Striking GUS activity was observed in guard cells located in expanded cotyledons and in hypocotyls of 1-week-old seedlings (Fig. 4B, a). Three-week-old rosette leaves (Fig. 4B, d and e) and cauline leaves also showed very high GUS staining in guard cells. However, GUS staining was not detected in leaf pavement epidermal cells or in mesophyll cells. Interestingly, GUS activity was also detected in guard cells of floral organs, including the sepal, anther (Fig. 4B, b and c), and carpel (data not shown). GUS activity was not detected in the differentiated cells of roots, although CHX20 expression was only observed in the root cap of 1-week-old seedlings (Fig. 4B, f), consistent with the microarray results of root cap cells (P. Benfey, personal communication). Thus, analyses of both CHX20 promoter-GUS expression and guard cell-specific transcriptome data clearly indicate selective expression of CHX20 in guard cells. When transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, CHX20-GFP was visualized at the periphery of the nucleus and in the cytosol (Fig. 5A, f ), suggesting that it is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in endomembranes. The CHX20-GFP signal was compared with those from a soluble GFP, GFP tagged to an ER retention sequence (GFP-HDEL), or to markers such as sialyltransferase (ST)-GFP for trans-Golgi, GFP-CPK9 for PM, and GFP-δTIP for vacuolar membrane (Fig. 5A). Although CHX20-GFP appeared to be localized to endomembranes, its pattern did not coincide entirely with any of the markers tested. To determine its location more precisely, the CHX20-GFP and a Golgi marker, ST-red fluorescent protein constructs, were cotransfected into mesophyll protoplasts. Of the cells that coexpressed both probes, the pattern of green fluorescence-labeled structures for the most part did not overlap with that of the red fluorescence (data not shown), indicating that CHX20 is not restricted to the trans-Golgi membrane. [[FIGURE]] Stably transformed plants expressing cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-driven CHX20-GFP also showed perinuclear fluorescent signals in guard cells (Fig. 5C), whereas soluble free GFP appeared inside the nucleus. Strong fluorescent signals were also detected inside the cytoplasm of cells expressing CHX20-GFP relative to that expressing the free GFP control. Together, the results suggest that CHX20 is localized to a subpopulation of endomembranes, although the protein does not appear to be a fixed resident of either the ER, Golgi, vacuole, or PM. We postulated that CHX20 is associated with vesicles/membranes that traffic among various subcellular membranes (CITATION). To test this idea, we examined the distribution of an endosome marker, Ara6-GFP (CITATION), and of CHX20 at several focal planes. Fluorescent signals of these two proteins were strikingly similar in several independent experiments. At the medial plane, the signal was cytoplasmic and at or near the PM (Fig. 5B). At the submedial focal plane, fluorescent signals were mostly cytoplasmic surrounding the plastids (Fig. 5B, data not shown). At the peripheral focal plane, the CHX20-GFP signal included several punctate regions. The GFP-tagged CHX20 was functionally active as shown by its ability to restore growth of KTA40-2 yeast at alkaline pH (Fig. 3B). Ara6, a Rab5-related GTPase, is distributed on a subset of endosomes and is involved in regulating vesicular transport (CITATION). These results suggest that an active CHX20 protein is associated with endosomal membranes. To determine the in planta function of CHX20, we obtained three independent T-DNA insertional lines of Arabidopsis chx20. Two lines, chx20-1 and chx20-3, were identified in the SIGnAL database (CITATION), and one line, chx20-4, was obtained from Genoplante (France). To confirm the T-DNA insertion site and select homozygous lines, PCR-based screening was performed using CHX20-specific primers and T-DNA primers. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified fragments confirmed that a T-DNA insertion was located within exon 2 at coding sequence base 477 of the chx20-1 mutant, inside the third exon at the 1,299 coding sequence of chx20-3, and within the second intron of chx20-4 (Fig. 1A). We tested for CHX20 transcripts in leaves of all the mutants. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using CHX20 gene-specific primers located at either side of the T-DNA insertion using template cDNA reverse transcribed from total leaf RNA. No products were amplified, indicating an absence of messages in all three alleles (Fig. 6B ). The chx20 mutants showed no obvious morphological or growth differences compared to wild-type plants under standard growth conditions (Fig. 6A). Overall, the size and shape of the guard cells were indistinguishable between mutants and wild-type plants. [[FIGURE]] The highly specific expression of CHX20 in guard cells (Fig. 4) suggested that CHX20 plays a role in guard cell signaling and/or development. Because we did not notice any developmental defects in the chx20 knockout mutants, we tested whether the chx20 null mutants had any altered stomatal movement. We first compared light-induced stomatal opening in mutants and wild-type plants. Excised leaves of chx20-1, chx20-3, and chx20-4 mutants were first exposed to white light for 3 h in a solution containing 5 mm KCl and 10 mm MES at pH 6.15. In all three mutants, the stomata failed to open as widely as wild-type plants. The ratio of light-induced stomatal opening per guard cell length in wild-type plants and in mutants ranged from 0.072 to 0.076 and 0.042 to 0.047, respectively. Thus, stomatal opening was reduced by approximately 35% in chx20 mutants (Fig. 7A ). We reduced the external KCl concentration in the opening solution to 0.1 and 1.0 mm. The aperture size was reduced slightly in wild-type and mutant leaves exposed to 0.1 mm K+ (Fig. 7B), implying that guard cell movement is limited at low K+ concentration. However, chx20 mutants still showed approximately 35% reduction in light-induced stomatal opening regardless of the external K+ concentration, indicating that the defect is not due to limited K+ level alone. [[FIGURE]] Using isolated epidermis, we found that light-induced stomatal opening was maximal at pH 6.1 and 7. At basic pH 7.5 and 8.0, light-induced opening was decreased in wild-type plants (Fig. 7C) consistent with inactivation by basic pH of inward-rectifying K+ channels and activation of outward-rectifying K+ channels in Vicia fava guard cells (CITATION, CITATION). However, mutants appeared to be insensitive to an acidic apoplastic pH that stimulated stomatal opening of wild-type guard cells. Thus, the reduced stomatal aperture of chx20 mutants was particularly apparent at pH 6.1 and 7.0. At pH 7.5 and 8.0, mutants showed reduced stomatal aperture nearly similar to that of wild type. Thus, chx20 mutants appeared to be unresponsive to pH regulation of guard cell movement. To test whether stomatal closure was affected, isolated epidermis of wild-type and chx20 mutant leaves were first exposed to white light for 3 h to induce stomatal opening and then incubated in 1 μm ABA to induce closure. The decrease in stomatal aperture was measured at 30-min intervals for 3 h. Although the aperture size of wild-type plants was larger than that of mutants before ABA addition, the percentage of closure of wild type was higher than that of mutants at all times (Fig. 8 ). These results indicate that chx20 mutants were responsive to ABA; however, mutants were delayed in stomatal closure compared to wild-type plants (Fig. 8). Results would suggest that CHX20 might also participate in events leading to stomatal closure. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! All experiments were conducted with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Col-0. Wild-type, mutant, and transgenic plants were grown under the same conditions. Plants were grown in Miracle-Gro potting soil (Scotts). Seeds in soil were stratified at 4°C for 3 d and then plants were grown in controlled-environment chambers at 20°C under illumination of 150 μE m−2 s−1 with a 16-h photoperiod. Two weeks after germination, plants were given Miracle-Gro plant food at 20-d intervals. To test for promoter∷GUS expression, transgenic seeds were grown under light (150 μE m−2 s−1) at 20°C on plates containing 0.5× CITATION salts and 1.0% agar, pH 5.8. The AtCHX20 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the GUS gene. A 2-kb region upstream of CHX20 was amplified by PCR. Primers CHX20-PF and CHX20-PR have SalI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (see Supplemental Table S1 for all primers). The amplified products were digested and fused with GUS in pRITA I plasmid. Clones were confirmed by sequencing. The region containing the CHX20 promoter and GUS was subcloned into the binary vector pMLBart using NotI and named CHX20∷GUS (Supplemental Table S2). To isolate CHX20 cDNA, total RNA was isolated from leaves of wild-type Arabidopsis and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase. Primers X20Cf and X20Cr were used to amplify the cDNA by 25 cycles (94°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s, and 72°C 90 s). The forward and reverse primers contain attB1 and attB2 sequences (Supplemental Table S1) for Gateway recombination cloning. Gel-purified PCR products were recombined with pDONR221 using BP Clonase according to the manufacturer's method (Invitrogen). Resulting clones were sequenced using forward and reverse M13, S1, S2, and S3 primers. The correctly spliced clone with the longest ORF was named entry clone pECHX20. To make a CHX20-GFP fusion construct, the CHX20 coding sequence from pECHX20 was recombined to the binary vector pK7FWG2 (CITATION) using LR Clonase to give an in-frame fusion of enhanced GFP at the C tail of CHX20 or pDCHX20-GFP. For expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), CHX20 from pECHX20 was recombined into a yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pYES-DEST52, to yield pDYES-CHX20. The binary vectors with CHX20 promoter∷GUS or pDCHX20-GFP were introduced stably into Arabidopsis using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral dip (CITATION). Transformants were selected on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog plates containing kanamycin (50 μg mL−1) or on soil by spraying with BASTA. T2 plants were analyzed for GUS expression or CHX20-GFP fluorescence. pDCHX20-GFP or other GFP-tagged constructs (see Supplemental Materials and Methods S1; Supplemental Table S2) were transiently expressed in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cell or in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts (CITATION) and observed after 12 to 16 h. The cells or tissues from transient and stable transformants were imaged for GFP fluorescence using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 10× dry 0.8 numerical aperture lens and a 63× 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion lens (Zeiss). The filter settings are Ex 488 nm/Em BP 510 to 530 nm for GFP, and Ex 488 nm/Em LP 570 nm for chlorophyll. Sometimes optical sections of approximately 5-μm increments were made to visualize the signal patterns at the medial to the peripheral plane. Images were assembled in Photoshop (Adobe). At least six independent transgenic lines were tested for GUS activity. Tissues were incubated in a mixture containing 84 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1.5 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-GlcUA (X-Gluc) at 37° C for 2 h. Samples were then fixed in 70% ethanol overnight to clear chlorophyll. Photographs were taken under a Nikon stereoscopic zoom microscope SMZ1000 or with differential interference contrast using a Nikon E600 microscope. The ATH1 23K GeneChip experiment was performed with guard cell and mesophyll cell RNA extracted from wild-type plants using methods described for the 8K chip (CITATION; see Supplemental Materials and Methods S1). Overall intensity normalization for the entire probe set was performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0. Using the GeneChip Suite 5.0 default parameters, the detection P value and the signal value were calculated for each probe set from each independent guard cell and mesophyll cell hybridization. Yeast strains used in the study are (1) AXT3 (MATα his3-11 leu2-112 trp1-1 ade2-1 ura3-1 ena1Δ∷his3∷ena4Δ nha1Δ∷leu2 nhx1Δ∷trp1 in W303-1B); (2) KTA40-2 (MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 mall0 ena1Δ∷his3∷ena4Δ nha1Δ∷lew2 nhx1Δ∷trp1 kha1Δ∷kanMX); and (3) LMB 01 (MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 mall0 ena1Δ∷his3∷ena4Δ nha1Δ∷leu2 kha1Δ∷kanMX) (CITATION; CITATION). Yeast was transformed with plasmid DNA using the lithium acetate method (CITATION) and the resulting transformants were selected on SC medium minus Ura (0.67% YNB, 2% Glc, 2% drop-out mix, 2% agar). Fresh cells grown in liquid medium were washed and suspended in water and then adjusted to OD600 of 1.0 (1×). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the cells were prepared with sterile water and 5 μL of each dilution was spotted on plates containing appropriate SC minus Ura (0.67% YNB, 2% Glc or Gal, 2% drop-out mix minus Ura, 2% agar) or SDAP minus Ura and adjusted to the desired pH. To reduce K+ and NH4+, modified SDAP medium was used. SDAP minus Ura medium consisted of 10 mm Arg-HCl (or Arg base), 2% (w/v) Glc or Gal, 2% drop-out mix minus Ura, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.9 mm CaCl2, trace minerals, vitamins, and 2% agar. Medium containing Arg-HCl was adjusted to pH 4.5 with tartaric acid and to pH 5.5 to 6.0 with 10 mm HEPES and Tris. For pH 7.0 to 7.5, medium contained Arg base and 10 mm HEPES and was adjusted to desired pH with tartaric acid or Tris. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 2 d and the relative growth of yeast was recorded using a Nikon Coolpix995 digital camera. For some experiments, 3-d yeast cells were cultured in liquid YNB medium containing 0.67% YNB without amino acids, 2% Glc, 0.01% adenine, 0.01% Trp, and 10 mm MES adjusted to pH 5.5 with Arg base and grown for 18 h at 30°C. One-milliliter cultures were diluted to 6 mL with YNB medium without Glc and then starved for 18 h at 30°C. Starved cells were washed with 6 mL water, pelleted, and suspended in water. Cell density was normalized to OD600 of 0.2 and subjected to 10-fold serial dilution. Five-microliter aliquots were spotted on modified YNB plates at pH 7.5 or 5.5. The YNB medium also contained 2% agar, 0.02% bromocresol purple (catalog no. 860891; Sigma), and 20 mm MES adjusted to either pH 5.5 or 7.5 with Arg base. Hygromycin B, when added, was 150 μg/mL (catalog no. H7772; Sigma). Plates were incubated at 30°C for 2 to 4 d. T-DNA insertional mutants of chx20 (CITATION) were detected in the SALK database (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress). Homozygous mutants, SALK_031420 (chx20-1), and SALK_011726 (chx20-3) seeds were first identified by PCR using LBa1 primer and CHX20-specific primers: CHX20-1-LP, CHX20-1-RP, CHX20-3-LP, CHX20-3-RP, CHX20-4F-P1, and CHX20-4F-P2 (Supplemental Table S1). The site of insertion was verified by sequencing. To detect CHX20 transcript, total RNA isolated from chx20-1, chx20-3, and chx20-4 mutant and wild-type plants was reverse transcribed. Primer sets (Supplemental Table S1) F1 (from −15 to 30 bp) and R1 (1,300–1,252 bp); F2 (1,252–1,300 bp) and reverse primer R2 (3′-untranslated region); and F3 (1,506–1,541 bp) and R2 are expected to amplify products of 1,230, 1,413, and 1,158 bp in wild-type plants, respectively. To test light-induced stomatal opening (CITATION), leaves were excised from 3-week-old wild-type and chx20 mutants. Leaves were separated into two batches and placed in aluminum foil-covered containers in the opening solution (5 mm KCl and 10 mm MES-KOH at pH 6.15) for 3 h. The dark-adapted leaves were then exposed to white light (approximately 150 μE m−2 s−1) or dark for 3 h at 20°C. Leaves were blended and filtered through 200-μm nylon mesh. Isolated epidermis was observed under a microscope (Axiovert, 40 CFL; Zeiss), and 20 stomata were measured for each condition. To study the effect of KCl concentration, isolated epidermal cells from wild type or chx20-3 were incubated in 10 mm MES-Tris at pH 6.15 without K+ for 3 h in the dark and then KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.1, 1, and 10 mm before exposure to 3 h of light. To test pH, the pH 6.15 medium was buffered with 10 mm MES-Tris and that of pH 7.0 to 8.0 was adjusted with 10 mm HEPES-Tris. To test ABA-induced stomatal closure, isolated epidermal cells from wild type or chx20-3 were incubated in opening solution with light for 3 h, then ABA was added to 1 μm and stomatal pore size and guard cell length were measured at 30-min intervals using Scion image analysis. The stomatal aperture was measured as the maximal width between the inner cuticular lips.
