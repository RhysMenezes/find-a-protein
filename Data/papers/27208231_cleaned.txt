!~ABS~! VIP1 is a bZIP transcription factor in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). VIP1 transiently accumulates in the nucleus when cells are exposed to hypoosmotic conditions, but its physiological relevance is unclear. This is possibly because Arabidopsis has approximately 10 close homologs of VIP1 and they function redundantly. To examine their physiological roles, transgenic plants overexpressing a repression domain-fused form of VIP1 (VIP1-SRDXox plants), in which the gene activation mediated by VIP1 is expected to be repressed, were generated. Because hypoosmotic stress can mimic mechanical stimuli (e.g. touch), the touch-induced root-waving phenotypes and gene expression patterns in those transgenic plants were examined. VIP1-SRDXox plants exhibited more severe root waving and lower expression of putative VIP1 target genes. The expression of the VIP1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein partially suppressed the VIP1-SRDX-induced increase in root waving when expressed in the VIP1-SRDXox plants. These results suggest that VIP1 can suppress the touch-induced root waving. The VIP1-SRDX-induced increase in root waving was also suppressed when the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid or the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, which is known to activate auxin biosynthesis, was present in the growth medium. Root cap cells with the auxin marker DR5rev::GFP were more abundant in the VIP1-SRDXox background than in the wild-type background. Auxin is transported via the root cap, and the conditions of outermost root cap layers were abnormal in VIP1-SRDXox plants. These results raise the possibility that VIP1 influences structures of the root cap and thereby regulates the local auxin responses in roots.
!~RES~! In a previous study, VIP1 and two other Arabidopsis group I subgroup 1 bZIP proteins, PosF21 and bZIP29, exhibited a similar nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling pattern under a hypoosmotic condition (CITATION). Three more group I subgroup 1 bZIP proteins (i.e. bZIP52, bZIP69, and bZIP30) were expressed as GFP-fused proteins in Arabidopsis to study their subcellular localization. The bZIP52-GFP, bZIP69-GFP, and bZIP30-GFP signals, as well as the VIP1-GFP signal, were detected mainly in the cytosol 0 and 120 min after the plants were submerged in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The signals were observed in the nucleus 10 min after the plants were submerged in the same solution (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when a 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium was used instead of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (Supplemental Fig. S1). These proteins also were transiently expressed in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) epidermal cells, and the intensity of their signals in the nucleus increased after the cells were treated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (Supplemental Fig. S2). These results further support the idea that the nuclear localizations of the group I bZIP proteins is similarly enhanced by hypoosmotic stress. [[FIGURE]] CYP707A1 is one of the putative VIP1 target genes, and its promoter is bound by VIP1 (CITATION). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused forms of bZIP52 PosF21, bZIP69, bZIP29, and bZIP30, as well as VIP1, were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to a gel-shift assay with the CYP707A1 promoter fragment as the probe. The GST-bZIP52 and GST-bZIP30 proteins were not expressed in E. coli, but the others were expressed at detectable levels (Supplemental Fig. S3) and decreased the electrophoretic mobility of the probe in the gel-shift assay (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that these proteins can bind to the CYP707A1 promoter in vitro and raises the possibility that they share somewhat similar DNA-binding abilities. Hypoosmotic stress can induce responses similar to those induced by mechanical stimuli such as touch (CITATION). This led us to examine the roles of VIP1 and other group I bZIP proteins in regulating root waving, which is a touch-induced response. When plants are grown on tilted impenetrable agar medium, their root tips are in continuous contact with the surface of the medium, which induces root bending. On the other hand, roots influenced by gravity (i.e. gravitropism) tend to grow in the direction of the gravitational force. The touch-induced bending and the gravitropism cause the roots to have a wavy appearance (for review, see CITATION). The extent of root waving can be determined using the vertical growth index (VGI), which is calculated by dividing the length of the vertical projection of the primary root by the length of the primary root (CITATION). The VGIs of the vip1-1, bzip29-1, and vip1-1/bzip29-1 mutants were similar to those of the wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S4). This might be because the group I bZIP proteins have functional redundancies, which mask the effects of the T-DNA insertions in VIP1 and bZIP29. However, some of the VIP1-SRDXox lines, in which gene expression regulated by VIP1 and other group I bZIP proteins is expected to be disturbed, exhibited greater root waving than the wild-type plants (Fig. 2A). Eight (of 10) VIP1-SRDXox lines had lower root VGIs than the wild-type plants (Fig. 2B). The VIP1 expression level, which reflects the VIP1-SRDX expression level in a VIP1-SRDXox line, was highest in VIP1-SRDXox #6, which had the second lowest VGI, followed by #7, which had the lowest VGI (Fig. 2C). This result supports the idea that the root VGI and the VIP1-SRDX expression level are negatively correlated. The overexpression of VIP1 alone did not result in a decrease in the VGI (Fig. 2, B and C). No clear differences were observed between wild-type and VIP1-SRDXox plants regarding responses to either the stress-related phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) or the hyperosmotic stress induced by mannitol (Supplemental Fig. S5). [[FIGURE]] The expression levels of CYP707A1 (a putative VIP1 target gene), CYP707A3, MYB44, EXPANSIN-LIKE A1 (EXLA1), EXLA2, and XTH23 (putative VIP1 target genes up-regulated by hypoosmotic stress; CITATION; CITATION), TCH2 and TCH4 (touch-responsive genes; CITATION), and PDH1 (a hypoosmotic stress-responsive gene; CITATION) were examined in VIP1-SRDXox #7 and #4, the latter of which has a lower expression level of VIP1-SRDX (Fig. 2C; Supplemental Fig. S4) and a higher root VGI than #7 (Fig. 2B). Under unstressed conditions, the CYP707A1, CYP707A3, and EXLA2 expression levels were lower in both VIP1-SRDXox #4 and #7 than in wild-type plants, and the EXLA1 expression level was lower in VIP1-SRDXox #7 than in wild-type plants. Following incubation in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 30 min, the EXLA2 expression level was lower in both VIP1-SRDXox #4 and #7 than in wild-type plants, and the CYP707A1, CYP707A3, and EXLA1 expression levels were lower in VIP1-SRDXox #7 than in wild-type plants (Fig. 3). These results support the idea that VIP1-SRDX represses the expression of VIP1 target genes. [[FIGURE]] To further characterize the VIP1-SRDX-mediated decrease in the root VGI, the lines Gox/VRDox and VGox/VRDox, which express GFP and VIP1-GFP, respectively, in the VIP1-SRDXox #7 background, were generated by crossing VIP1-SRDXox #7 with either a line containing a 35S promoter-driven GFP (GFPox) or a line containing a 35S promoter-driven VIP1-GFP (VIP1-GFPox). The VGI of Gox/VRDox was higher than that of VIP1-SRDXox #7 but lower than that of GFPox. On the other hand, the VGI of VGox/VRDox was higher than that of VIP1-SRDXox #7 and as high as those of GFPox and VIP1-GFPox (Fig. 4A). The expression level of VIP1-SRDX was not lower in either Gox/VRDox or VGox/VRDox than in VIP1-SRDXox #7 (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when the line expressing the auxin marker DR5rev::GFP (CITATION) in the VIP1-SRDXox #7 background was used instead of Gox/VRDox (Supplemental Fig. S6). These results suggest that VIP1-GFP suppresses the VIP1-SRDX-mediated decrease in the root VGI. The VIP1-SRDX expression level was higher in Gox/VRDox than in VIP1-SRDXox #7, but the VGI of Gox/VRDox was higher than that of VIP1-SRDXox #7 (Fig. 4). GFP and/or some transgenes might somewhat inhibit VIP1-SRDX transcription or the functions of VIP1-SRDX. The GFP expression level was lower in Gox/VRDox than in GFPox, and the VIP1-GFP expression level was lower in VGox/VRDox than in VIP1-GFPox (Supplemental Fig. S7A). This may have been due to transgene silencing. Consistent with this result, western blotting revealed that the VIP1-GFP level was lower in VGox/VRDox than in VIP1-GFPox (Supplemental Fig. S7B). In the absence of hypoosmotic stress, the VIP1-GFP signals were detected in the cytosol but not in the nucleus of cells in wavy roots in either VIP1-GFPox or VGox/VRDox (Supplemental Fig. S7C, left), suggesting that the touch stress was insufficient to induce a detectable level of VIP1 nuclear localization. No differences were observed between VIP1-GFPox and VGox/VRDox in the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling pattern of VIP1-GFP under hypoosmotic conditions (Supplemental Fig. S7C), suggesting that VIP1-SRDX does not affect the subcellular localization of VIP1. [[FIGURE]] Ethylene can stimulate auxin biosynthesis and basipetal auxin transport in roots, both of which help regulate root tropisms (CITATION). The ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) can decrease the endogenous auxin level and auxin responses (CITATION). Consistent with these earlier findings, the root VGIs of wild-type and VIP1-SRDXox #4 plants were lower in the presence of AVG than in its absence, but the extent of the decrease in VGI was greater in VIP1-SRDXox #4 than in wild-type plants. The VGI of VIP1-SRDXox #7 was unaffected by AVG, but it was lower than that of wild-type or VIP1-SRDXox #4 plants regardless of the presence of AVG. This might be because the decrease in the VGI is saturated in VIP1-SRDXox #7, even in the absence of AVG. The VGIs of VIP1-SRDXox #4 and #7 were higher in the presence of either 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D; synthetic auxin) or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC; ethylene precursor) than their absence (Fig. 5). The responses of VIP1-SRDXox #10 and #11 to AVG, 2,4-D, and ACC were similar to those of VIP1-SRDXox #4 (Supplemental Fig. S8). Under these conditions, no clear difference was observed in root length between the wild-type and VIP-SRDXox plants (Supplemental Fig. S9). These results support the idea that auxin is involved in the VIP1-SRDX-dependent decrease in the root VGI. [[FIGURE]] To visualize the local auxin responses in VIP1-SRDXox roots, DR5rev::GFP was introduced into the VIP1-SRDXox #7 background. DR5rev::GFP labels cells exhibiting strong auxin responses (CITATION). The DR5rev::GFP signals were limited to the columella cells in the root cap in the wild-type background, but in the VIP1-SRDXox background, they were also detected in the lateral root cap cells (Fig. 6A). To visualize the PIN auxin transporters, PIN1::PIN1-GFP (CITATION), PIN2::PIN2-GFP (CITATION), PIN3::PIN3-GFP (CITATION), PIN4::PIN4-GFP (CITATION), and PIN7::PIN7-GFP (CITATION), which express the PIN proteins fused to GFP using their own promoters, were introduced into VIP1-SRDXox #7. No differences were observed between the wild-type background and the VIP1-SRDXox background regarding either the subcellular localization or the tissue specificity of the expression of the PIN-GFP fusion proteins. No differences were observed in the intensities of the PIN3-GFP, PIN4-GFP, and PIN7-GFP signals, either (Supplemental Fig. S10). However, the intensities of the PIN1-GFP and PIN2-GFP signals were lower and higher, respectively, in the VIP1-SRDXox background than in the wild-type background (Fig. 6, B and C). In qRT-PCR, no large differences were observed between wild-type and VIP1-SRDXox plants regarding the expression of either ethylene biosynthesis genes or auxin-related genes, including PIN1 and PIN2. No differences were observed in the expression of the genes encoding the GOLVEN (GLV) secretory peptides, which induce the accumulation of PIN2 and inhibit gravitropic root growth (CITATION; CITATION), either (Supplemental Table S1). These results suggest that those genes are not VIP1 target genes. [[FIGURE]] Starch grain accumulation in columella cells is necessary for full gravitropic responses of roots (CITATION), but no differences were observed between wild-type and VIP1-SRDXox plants regarding starch grain accumulation in columella cells (Supplemental Fig. S11A). The number of meristematic cells in the root cortex reflects the activity of the root apical meristem (CITATION), but no differences were observed in the abundance of such meristematic cells between wild-type and VIP1-SRDXox plants (Supplemental Fig. S11, B and C). These results suggest that VIP1-SRDX affects neither starch accumulation nor the meristem activity in roots. On the other hand, a closer examination of VIP1-SRDXox lines revealed that their outermost root cap layers were abnormal. In the wavy roots, the conditions of the outermost root cap layers were classified into the following three categories: I, the edges of the layer are being removed from the other root cap parts; II, the layer has ruptured in the middle; and III, the layer is completely attached to the inner root cap parts (Fig. 7A). Most of the outermost root cap layers in wild-type plants belonged to categories I and III, whereas most of the layers in VIP1-SRDXox plants belonged to categories II and III (Fig. 7B; Table I). This result supports the idea that VIP1-SRDX affects the adhesion of the cell layers and/or structures of the root cap. [[FIGURE]] #4, #7, and #10 are VIP1-SRDXox lines. Categories and genotypes were not independent, according to the χ2 test (P < 10−7).
!~MM~! To overexpress VIP1 and the VIP1-SRDX fusion protein in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGACTGGTACCCGGGTCGACTGACTAGTACGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CGTACTAGTCAGTCGACCCGGGTACCAGT-3′ (complementary sequences are underlined) were mixed. The resulting double-stranded DNA was cloned into the XbaI and SacI sites of pBI121-35SMCS-GFP (CITATION), which removed the GFP CDS to generate pBI121-35SMCS. The full-length VIP1 CDS was amplified by PCR using VIP1-containing pBS-35SMCS-GFP (CITATION) as the template and the following primer pair: 5′-CCCCACTAGTCATATGGAAGGAGGAGGAAGAGGACC-3′ and 5′-CCCCGTCGACAGCCTCTCTTGGTGAAATCC-3′ (SpeI, NdeI, and SalI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with SpeI and SalI and cloned into the XbaI and SalI sites of pBI121-35SMCS to generate pBI121-35S-VIP1. The oligonucleotides 5′-TCGACTCGACCTGGATCTTGAGCTAAGGTTGGGCTTCGCGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCGCGAAGCCCAACCTTAGCTCAAGATCCAGGTCGAG-3′ (complementary sequences are underlined) were mixed. The resulting double-stranded DNA was cloned into the SalI and SpeI sites of pBI121-35S-VIP1 to generate pBI121-35S-VIP1-SRDX. To express the bZIP52-GFP fusion protein, the bZIP52 CDS was amplified by PCR using bZIP52-containing pGADT7-Rec (CITATION) as the template and the following primer pair: 5′-CCCTCTAGAGAATTCCATGGAGAAATCAGATCCTCCACC-3′ and 5′-CCCGTCGACCATAGGCAGAGCTACTCTCACTAGC-3′ (XbaI, EcoRI, and SalI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with XbaI and SalI and cloned into the XbaI and SalI sites of pBI121-35SMCS-GFP to generate pBI121-35S-bZIP52-GFP. To express the bZIP69-GFP fusion protein, the bZIP69 CDS was amplified by PCR using bZIP69-containing pGADT7-Rec (CITATION) as the template and the following primer pair: 5′-CCCTCTAGAGGATCCATGGATAAGGAGAAATCTCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GAGGTCGACCGTCTTTTGTCAAGGGAGTTTCACG-3′ (XbaI, BamHI, and SalI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with XbaI and SalI and cloned into the XbaI and SalI sites of pBI121-35SMCS-GFP to generate pBI121-35S-bZIP69-GFP. To express the bZIP30-GFP fusion, the bZIP30 CDS was amplified by PCR using bZIP30-containing pGADT7-Rec (CITATION) as the template and the following primer pair: 5′-CCCTCTAGAGGATCCATGGGTGGTGGTGGTGATACAAC-3′ and 5′-CCCGTCGACCGTCGTTTGAAGTGTGCTTTGC-3′ (XbaI, BamHI, and SalI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with XbaI and SalI and cloned into the XbaI and SalI sites of pBI121-35SMCS-GFP to generate pBI121-35S-bZIP69-GFP. To express the GST-bZIP52 fusion protein in Escherichia coli, the bZIP52 CDS was obtained by digesting pBI121-35S-bZIP52-GFP with EcoRI and SalI. The purified fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-6P-3 (GE Healthcare) to generate pGEX-6P-bZIP52. To express the GST-bZIP69 and GST-bZIP30 fusion proteins in E. coli, the bZIP69 and bZIP30 CDSs were obtained by digesting pBI121-35S-bZIP69-GFP and pBI121-35S-bZIP30-GFP with BamHI and SalI. The purified fragments were cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-6P-3 to generate pGEX-6P-bZIP69 and pGEX-6P-bZIP30. To express the GST-PosF21 fusion protein in E. coli, the PosF21 CDS was amplified by PCR using PosF21-containing pGADT7-Rec (CITATION) as the template and the following primer pair: 5′-CCCGTCGACATGGATAAGGAGAAATCTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-GAGGTCGACGTTCTCTTTCTGGGCTTGTG-3′ (SalI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with SalI and cloned into the SalI site of pGEX-6P-3 to generate pGEX-6P-PosF21. To express the GST-bZIP29 fusion protein in E. coli, the bZIP29 CDS was amplified by PCR using bZIP29-containing pGADT7-Rec (CITATION) as the template and the following primer pair: 5′-GAGGTCGACATGGGTGATACAGAGAAGTGT-3′ and 5′-GGGGTCGACCTTCATTTGATTCAGATTTTGTTGCC-3′ (SalI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with SalI and cloned into the SalI site of pGEX-6P-3 to generate pGEX-6P-bZIP29. Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia-0 was used as the wild-type control for all experiments. Seeds of vip1-1 (SALK_001014C; CITATION) and bzip29-1 (SALK_065254C) mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (https://abrc.osu.edu/). The double mutant vip1-1/bzip29-1 was generated by crossing vip1-1 and bzip29-1 plants as the pollen and pod parents, respectively. The F2 plants generated from the cross were analyzed by genomic PCR (see “Genomic PCR” below), and homozygous lines with T-DNA insertions in VIP1 and bZIP29 were selected. The F3 seeds produced from the homozygous lines were used for subsequent analyses. Transgenic plants overexpressing VIP1 alone, VIP1-SRDX, or a GFP-fused form of bZIP52, bZIP69, or bZIP30 were generated with pBI121-35S-VIP1, pBI121-35S-VIP1-SRDX, pBI121-35S-bZIP52-GFP, pBI121-35S-bZIP69-GFP, or pBI121-35S-bZIP30-GFP, respectively, using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral dip method (CITATION). Transgenic lines with DR5rev::GFP (CITATION), PIN1::PIN1-GFP (CITATION), PIN2::PIN2-GFP (CITATION), and PIN7::PIN7-GFP (CITATION) were provided by Dr. Jiří Friml (Institute of Science and Technology). A transgenic line with PIN3::PIN3-GFP (CITATION) was provided by Dr. Miyo Terao Morita (Nagoya University). A transgenic line containing PIN4::PIN4-GFP (CITATION) was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (stock no. N9576; http://arabidopsis.info/). Transgenic plants overexpressing GFP and VIP1-GFP (CITATION) and transgenic plants with DR5rev::GFP and PIN::PIN-GFP (pod parents) were crossed with VIP1-SRDXox #7 (pollen parent) to introduce these transgenes into the VIP1-SRDXox background. The F2 generation plants were used for subsequent analyses. Genomic PCR analysis was performed to ensure that only data from individuals with the VIP1-SRDX transgene were used. Seeds were surface sterilized and sown on 1.5% (w/v) agar (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) containing 0.5× MS salts (Wako), 1% (w/v) Suc (Wako), and 0.5 g L−1 MES (Dojindo Laboratories), pH 5.8. Seeds were chilled at 4°C in darkness for 48 h and then germinated at 22°C. Plants were grown at 22°C under a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle (light intensity of 120 µmol m−2 s−1). To examine plant responses to either ABA or osmotic stress, the plants of those lines were grown for 3 weeks on the same MS agar medium supplemented with 0.5 μm ABA (Sigma-Aldrich) or 200 mm mannitol (Wako). To evaluate root waving and the removal of outermost layers of root caps, plants were grown for 1 week on MS agar medium that was tilted at a 45° angle. The plants were then photographed, and the lengths of the primary roots and the vertical projections from those roots were measured using ImageJ software (CITATION) to calculate the VGIs as described previously (CITATION). AVG (0.5 μm final concentration; Wako), 2,4-D (0.2 μm; Wako), and ACC (0.5 μm; Wako) also were added to the MS medium to assess their effects on VGIs. Plants were grown on the prepared media until their primary roots grew to approximately 1 to 1.5 cm. Box and whisker plots for VGIs are presented in Figures 2B, 4A, and 5 and Supplemental Figures S4C, S6A, and S8. Bar graphs for them are presented in Supplemental Figure S12. Starch grains in the root cap were observed and the number of meristematic cortex cells was counted essentially as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, to visualize starch granules in the root cap cells, 10-d-old plants grown on MS agar medium tilted at a 45° angle were incubated for 3 min at room temperature in Lugol solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The plants were then washed with distilled water and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in transparentizing solution (8 g of chloral hydrate dissolved in a mixture of 3 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of glycerol). Roots from the transparentized samples were then analyzed using a microscope (BX51; Olympus). To count the numbers of meristematic cortex cells, 10-d-old plants grown on MS agar medium tilted at a 45° angle were incubated in a 10 μm propidium iodide (Wako) solution for 5 min at room temperature. Root cells were then observed using an epifluorescence microscope (BX51 equipped with the mercury-vapor lamp USH-102D [Ushio], the fluorescence filter/mirror cube sets U-MNIBA3, U-MWIB3, and U-MWIG [Olympus], and the CCD camera DP73 [Olympus]). Microscope images were obtained using the cellSens software (Olympus). The region in the root tip where the length of a cell was greater than its width was regarded as the starting point of the elongation zone. The number of cells in a cortical layer between the quiescent center and the starting point of the root elongation zone was then counted. The numbers of plants used in these experiments are indicated in the legends for the relevant figures (Figs. 2B, 4A, and 5; Supplemental Figs. S3C, S5, S6A, S8, and S10) and Table I. Transgenic plants with DR5rev::GFP, PIN1::PIN1-GFP, PIN2::PIN2-GFP, PIN3::PIN3-GFP, PIN4::PIN4-GFP, and PIN7::PIN7-GFP were grown for 1 week on tilted MS agar medium, and the GFP signals in their roots were detected by epifluorescence microscopy. To assess the effects of hypoosmotic stress on the distribution of signals for GFP, VIP1-GFP, bZIP52-GFP, bZIP69-GFP, and bZIP30-GFP, approximately 1-week-old transgenic plants expressing these proteins were submerged in either 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, or a liquid medium containing 0.5× MS salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.5 g L−1 MES, pH 5.8 (i.e. hypotonic solution), and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy at the time points indicated in the relevant figures (Fig. 1A; Supplemental Figs. S1 and S7C). To transiently express GFP, VIP1-GFP, bZIP52-GFP, PosF21-GFP, bZIP69-GFP, and bZIP29-GFP in lettuce (Lactuca sativa), romaine lettuce leaf epidermal cells were transformed using an agroinfiltration method as described previously (CITATION). The transformed lettuce cells were incubated in darkness at room temperature for 48 h, submerged in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, incubated at room temperature for 0 or 20 min, and then analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. The resulting images were processed with the GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/), Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org), and ImageJ programs. To quantify the PIN1-GFP and PIN2-GFP signals, the corresponding microscopy images were converted to grayscale using ImageJ. The threshold value was then set to 30 for PIN1-GFP or 27 for PIN2-GFP, and the GFP signals were extracted using the Analyze Particles tool. The areas from which signals were extracted were totaled, and the resulting values were used as the PIN1-GFP and PIN2-GFP levels. For the western-blot analysis of GFP and VIP1-GFP, proteins were extracted from approximately 10-d-old GFP-overexpressing and VIP1-GFP-overexpressing plants (see “Plant Materials” above) using a chemical cell lysis method (CITATION). GFP in the proteins was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories) as described previously (CITATION). The numbers of plants and the numbers of replications used for these experiments are indicated in the legends for the relevant figures (Figs. 1A and 6; Supplemental Figs. S1, S7, B and C, and S9). To select the vip1-1/bzip29-1 double mutant, mature leaves (approximately 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) of F2 plants generated by the cross between vip1-1 and bzip29-1 (see “Plant Materials” above) were ground with a pestle in sample tubes containing 200 μL of extraction solution (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl [Wako], 25 mm EDTA [Wako], and 0.5% [w/v] SDS [Wako]). The solutions were centrifuged at 12,000g for 2 min to precipitate the plant debris. The supernatants were mixed with 150 μL of 2-propanol (Wako) and centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the precipitates were washed with 70% ethanol (Wako). The precipitates were then dried, dissolved in distilled water, and used as templates for genomic PCR. To examine whether the VIP1-SRDX CDS was present in transgenic plants, genomic DNA was extracted from the plants using a chemical cell lysis method (CITATION). The PCR was completed using the KOD FX Neo DNA polymerase (Toyobo) and the primers listed in Supplemental Table S2. Images were processed using Inkscape. The gel-shift assay was completed essentially as described previously (CITATION). Briefly, the pGEX constructs (see “Plasmid Construction” above) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Production of the GST-fused proteins was induced by culturing the transformed E. coli cells for 2 h at 28°C in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Wako). The proteins were then purified by affinity chromatography using Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe containing the CYP707A1 promoter sequence (approximately 250 bp) was generated as described previously (CITATION), mixed with the purified proteins, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA probe was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare), reacted with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Diagnostics), and detected using CDP-Star (Roche) as the chemiluminescent substrate for alkaline phosphatase. The experiments were completed three times, and similar results were obtained. Images were processed using Inkscape. To examine the expression of VIP1, VIP1-SRDX, and auxin-related genes, approximately 20 roots of 10-d-old plants were harvested for each genotype. To examine the expression of hypoosmotic stress-responsive genes, approximately 20 1-week-old plants of each genotype were submerged in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and incubated for 0, 30, or 60 min at room temperature. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted from the ground plant material using the Favor Prep Plant Total RNA Purification Mini Kit (Favorgen Biotech). cDNA was synthesized from approximately 1 μg of total RNA using the oligo(dT) primer and PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Bio-PCR), which was completed using the StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus; Takara Bio). Relative expression levels were calculated using the comparative CT method with UBQ5 as the internal control. Each experiment was conducted with three biological replicates. The sequences of the primers used for qRT-PCR are provided in Supplemental Table S3.
