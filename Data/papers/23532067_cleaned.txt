!~ABS~! Cell surface proteins play critical roles in the perception of environmental stimuli at the plasma membrane (PM) and ensuing signal transduction. Intracellular localization of such proteins must be strictly regulated, which requires elaborate integration of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways. Subcellular localization of Arabidopsis thaliana FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), a receptor that recognizes bacterial flagellin, also depends on membrane trafficking. However, our understanding about the mechanisms involved is still limited. In this study, we visualized ligand-induced endocytosis of FLS2 using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FLS2 expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Upon treatment with the flg22 peptide, internalized FLS2-GFP from the PM was transported to a compartment with properties intermediate between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the multivesicular endosome. This compartment gradually discarded the TGN characteristics as it continued along the trafficking pathway. We further found that FLS2 endocytosis involves distinct RABA/RAB11 subgroups at different steps. Moreover, we demonstrated that transport of de novo–synthesized FLS2 to the PM also involves a distinct RABA/RAB11 subgroup. Our results demonstrate the complex regulatory system for properly localizing FLS2 and functional differentiation in RABA members in endo- and exocytosis.
!~RES~! In this study, we used the transient expression system in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells by infiltration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which has been successfully used to observe intracellular trafficking of fluorescent protein–tagged proteins and simultaneous expression of multiple proteins (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). First, we confirmed localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged FLS2 on the PM in untreated N. benthamiana cells (Figure 1A), as reported in Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells (CITATION). Then we examined whether flg22-dependent internalization of FLS2-GFP is also observed in this system. Upon treatment with flg22, dot-like structures with FLS2-GFP appeared in the cytoplasm 90 and 120 min after flg22 application (Figures 1B and 1C). A lipophilic dye, FM4-64, was also internalized in a similar time frame in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Treatment with flg22A.tum, the inactive peptide derived from Agrobacterium flagellin (CITATION), did not result in accumulation of FLS2-GFP at the cytoplasmic organelles (Figure 1D), indicating that flg22 specifically triggers endocytosis of FLS2 in this system. To examine earlier events of endocytosis of FLS2 in this system, we then observed the behavior of FLS2-GFP using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy–related technique called variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy or variable incidence angle fluorescence microscopy, which enables selective visualization of sample surface regions (CITATION; CITATION). FLS2 signals were concentrated on the PM 40 min after applying flg22 (Figures 1E to 1G), and clear punctate signals, probably reflecting concentrated or internalized FLS2, were observed on or near the PM at 60 min (Figure 1H). [[FIGURE]] To investigate which organelles are involved in endocytosis of FLS2, we coexpressed FLS2-GFP with monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-SYP61 or VHA-a1-mRFP, markers of the TGN, or with TagRFP-ARA7 or TagRFP-VAMP727, markers for the MVE, because these organelles are known to act as endocytic compartments in plant cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). From 90 to 120 min after flg22 treatment, FLS2-GFP was observed overlapping or associated with mRFP-SYP61 (Figures 2A and 2B). By contrast, FLS2-GFP was not observed near the SYP61 compartments after 210 min (Figure 2C). For quantitative analysis of this observation, we extracted the dot-like signals of FLS2-GFP and mRFP-SYP61 and measured the distance from the center of a FLS2-GFP–positive dot to that of the nearest mRFP-SYP61 signal using a framework run on Metamorph software, which we previously developed (CITATION). The results were categorized into three groups by distances: (1) colocalized (≤0.24 μm; below the resolution limit of the objective lens used in this study); (2) associated (≤1 μm); and (3) independent (>1 μm). We compared results between two groups of samples; one was observed from 80 to 140 min after flg22 treatment (an early endocytic stage), and the other was observed from 140 to 200 min after flg22 application (a late endocytic stage). In the early stage, ∼27.6% ± 6.4% and 39.6% ± 6.5% of FLS2-positive compartments were colocalized and associated with SYP61-positive dots, respectively (Figure 2R). In the late endocytic stage, ratios of colocalized and associated groups were significantly decreased to 5.6% ± 3.9% and 19.3% ± 6.6%, respectively (n = 3 experiments, P < 0.01, Student’s t test) (Figure 2R). These results suggested that FLS2 that is internalized upon flg22 application transiently localizes at SYP61-positive compartments in the early stage. Intriguingly, an experiment using another TGN marker, VHA-a1, yielded a different result. When VHA-a1 and FLS2 were coexpressed and treated with flg22, we did not observe colocalization of these proteins at any time points after the flg22 treatment (Figures 2D to 2F). The quantitative analysis also supported this observation; only 1.0% ± 0.9% and 1.0% ± 1.7% of FLS2-positive compartments were categorized as colocalized in the early and late stages, respectively (Figure 2S). For further clarification of this result, we directly compared subcellular localization of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-SYP61 and VHA-a1-mRFP in cells expressing FLS2-GFP and in which flg22 treatment induced endocytosis. SYP61- and VHA-a1–positive dots were mostly overlapped; however, we found that the SYP61-positive compartments carrying FLS2-GFP did not harbor VHA-a1-mRFP (Figures 2M to 2P). We also confirmed that CFP-SYP61 and mRFP-SYP61 exhibited the same localization pattern (Figure 2Q), and mRFP-SYP61 and VHA-a1-mRFP exhibited similar distribution patterns in relation to the Golgi apparatus visualized with ST-Venus (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). These results clearly indicated that the compartment bearing SYP61 and FLS2 observed in this study has a characteristic distinct from the TGN in cells where endocytosis of FLS2 is not induced. [[FIGURE]] We next examined whether TagRFP-tagged ARA7 and VAMP727, an MVE-localizing RAB GTPase and R-SNARE, respectively, were colocalized with FLS2. These endosomal proteins were localized on FLS2-positive puncta observed in both early and late stages (Figures 2G to 2L, 2T, and 2U). To investigate the relationship between SYP61- and ARA7-positive compartments in flg22-induced endocytosis of FLS2, we then expressed FLS2-GFP, mRFP-SYP61, and TagRFP-ARA7 in the same cell and compared their subcellular localization after treatment with flg22. At the earlier stage (100 min after the treatment), both SYP61 and ARA7 were colocalized on the same FLS2-positive compartments (Figure 3A). However, after 140 min, most SYP61 localization did not overlap with FLS2 or ARA7 but occurred instead at the membrane domains in close proximity to (or associated with) the FLS2- and ARA7-positive domains (Figure 3B). After 200 min, we did not see colocalization or association of SYP61 with FLS2, while FLS2 still exhibited good colocalization with ARA7 (Figure 3C). These results indicated the existence of an endosomal compartment involved in flg22-triggered endocytosis of FLS2 that seemed to harbor an intermediate property between the TGN and MVE. Of interest, the colocalization of SYP61 and ARA7 was observed only at compartments carrying endocytosed FLS2-GFP. In Arabidopsis plants grown under normal laboratory conditions, we noted no significant colocalization between the MVE and TGN proteins thus far (CITATION, CITATION). Thus, such intermediate compartments might exist only when endocytosis is highly activated. [[FIGURE]] To verify this possibility, we compared localization of SYP61 and ARA7 after flg22 treatment between two samples: leaf epidermal cells expressing FLS2-GFP, mRFP-SYP61, and TagRFP-ARA7, and cells expressing mRFP-SYP61 and TagRFP-ARA7 but not FLS2-GFP. As observed above, 4.6% ± 2.0% of mRFP-SYP61–positive compartments bore TagRFP-ARA7 in FLS2-expressing cells at 100 min after application of flg22 (Figures 3D and 3E); this is significantly higher than the ratio (1.1% ± 0.5%) of mRFP-SYP61 compartments with TagRFP-ARA7 in cells not expressing FLS2 after treatment with flg22 (n = 3 experiments, P < 0.05, Student’s t test; Figures 3F and 3G, Table 1). These results suggested that the intermediate compartment identified in this study is a transient endosomal structure that is induced when endocytosis is highly activated. Under our experimental conditions, ∼20% of SYP61-positive compartments were classified as “associated” with ARA7-positive compartments, which indicated that the two compartments were not overlapped but in close proximity (<0.24 μm distance between two compartments ≤1 μm), regardless of combinations of coexpressed proteins and time points (Table 1). As described above, we found that compartments with intermediate properties between the TGN and MVE are involved in ligand-induced endocytosis of FLS2. To identify molecular machineries that control the trafficking pathway around this compartment, we focused our interest on the RABA family because some RABA members have been reported to act in membrane trafficking around the TGN (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), although involvement of this family in endocytosis remains unexplored. Because of the extreme expansion of RABA members in Arabidopsis (see Supplemental Table 2 online), it is not practical at present to test their involvement in endocytosis of FLS2 using classical mutant analyses. Thus we took advantage of the transient expression system in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells, which allowed us to monitor the effect of a dominant-negative mutant of a representative member of each RABA subgroup whose expression was conditionally induced in cells expressing FLS2-GFP and organelle markers. We created a nucleotide-free mutant of each member of the six subgroups of RABA (RABA1b, RABA2c, RABA3, RABA4c, RABA5c, and RABA6a) by replacing invariable Asn in the conserved GNKXD sequence with Ile (hereafter called the NI mutant) because these mutants have been successfully used as dominant-negative forms for functional analyses of RABA members in plants (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The expression of the NI mutants was controlled by an estradiol-inducible promoter (CITATION) to avoid undesirable effects of the mutant on transport of newly synthesized FLS2 to the PM. We examined the effects of these mutants on endocytic transport of FLS2-GFP, comparing FLS2-GFP subcellular localization with SYP61 and/or ARA7. For induction of mutant expression, 10 μM estradiol was infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves and incubated for 2 to 3 h, and then samples were treated with flg22. This condition is enough for accumulation of the mutant RABA members, as indicated by bright fluorescence from Venus fused to the mutant RABA members (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). We examined the effects of expression of wild-type and NI mutants for all six RABA subgroups, three of which (RABA2c, RABA3, and RABA5c) had no substantial effect on endocytic transport of FLS2-GFP; mutants of RABA3 and RABA5c did not exert significant effects on endocytosis of FLS2 (P > 0.05, Student’s t test), and the mutant of RABA2c had only a marginal effect on colocalization with SYP61 at the later stage (P = 0.0493, Student’s t test; see Supplemental Figures 4 to 6 online). However, expression of NI mutants of the other three RABA subgroups resulted in remarkable alteration in endocytic trafficking of FLS2-GFP. In RABA6aN126I-expressing cells, we found that FLS2 colocalized well with SYP61 even at the late stage, at which FLS2 was observed on membrane compartments independent of SYP61-domains in wild-type RABA6a-expressing cells (Figure 4A). Quantification further indicated that expression of RABA6aN126I increased colocalization of FLS2 with SYP61. We found that 41.2% ± 4.0% and 15.4 ± 3.5% of FLS2-positive compartments in early (80 to 140 min) and late (140 to 200 min) stages, respectively, also bore SYP61 in RABA6aN126I-expressing cells, which was significantly higher than that observed in wild-type RABA6a-expressing samples (21.6% ± 5.9% in the early stage and 5.2% ± 2.6% in the late stage, n = 3 experiments, P < 0.05, Student’s t test; Figure 4B). This result appeared to indicate that RABA6a acts in trafficking of FLS2 from SYP61-positive compartments. We then examined whether ARA7 also occurs on the FLS2-positive compartments in RABA6aN126I-expressing cells. We coexpressed TagRFP-ARA7 with FLS2-GFP and mutant or wild-type RABA6a to find that ARA7 also localized on FLS2-positive compartments in both cases (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). These results strongly suggested that RABA6aN126I did not impair formation of the hybrid compartment bearing SYP61 and ARA7 but did cause delay in transport or transition from the intermediate endosome to the SYP61-free late endosomal compartment, which resulted in increased colocalization of FLS2 and SYP61 in NI mutant–expressing cells. [[FIGURE]] Intriguingly, RABA4cN128I conferred an apparently opposite effect from RABA6aN126I. In cells expressing the RABA4cN128I mutant, the extent of colocalization between FLS2 and SYP61 in the early stage was significantly reduced (5.8% ± 3.9%) compared with the result from coexpression of wild-type RABA4c (26.7% ± 9.6%, n = 3 experiments, P < 0.05, Student’s t test; Figures 5A and 5B). This result appeared to indicate that internalized FLS2 was not transported to the SYP61 compartments in mutant-expressing cells. However, we found that ARA7 did colocalize with FLS2 in RABA4cN128I-expressing cells (see Supplemental Figure 8 online). Thus, there might be an alternative direct trafficking pathway from the PM to ARA7-positive MVEs without transit through SYP61-positive compartments. [[FIGURE]] These results clearly indicated that two distinct RABA subgroup members, RABA6a and RABA4c, regulate different steps in the endocytic pathway of FLS2. Furthermore, the specific effects of these RABA members also demonstrated that the inhibitory effects we observed in these experiments resulted from inhibition of the specific function of each RABA member in N. benthamiana, rather than reflecting the effect of titration of general RAB regulators such as RAB guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. This notion was also supported by the results of coexpression of wild-type RABA members with NI mutants. We coexpressed mRFP-tagged wild-type RABA members with Venus-RABA4cN128I or Venus-RABA6aN126I for suppression activities for transport defects of FLS2 in tobacco cells expressing FLS2-GFP and CFP-SYP61. The inhibitory effects of NI mutants were specifically rescued by coexpression of their wild-type versions but not by the other RABA members, which again indicated specific inhibition of the distinct trafficking event by each mutant RABA, as is the case for other plant RAB GTPases (Figures 4C and 5C; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We then examined the order of functions of two RABA members, RABA4c and RABA6a, in endocytic trafficking of FLS2 by double infiltration of their NI mutants. Simultaneous expression of RABA4cN128I and RABA6aN126I caused the same trafficking defect as RABA4cN128I (Figure 6). This result strongly suggested that RABA4c acts in an earlier step than RABA6a in endocytic trafficking of FLS2. [[FIGURE]] The NI mutant of RABA1b (RABA1bN126I) exerted another interesting effect. When expressed with this mutant, the distribution of mRFP-SYP61 and internalized FLS2-GFP was dramatically changed. mRFP-SYP61, which presented clear dot-shaped signals in wild-type RABA1b-expressing cells, was scattered to tiny dots throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 7). Regarding FLS2-GFP, for which flg22 treatment induced endocytosis, we observed no dot-like signals in the mutant-expressing cells, but only smear signals that largely overlapped with mRFP-SYP61 (Figure 7). These results indicated that RABA1bN126I did not block the internalization of FLS2 from the PM but that the morphology of compartments with SYP61 to which FLS2 was transported was severely affected. [[FIGURE]] These findings additionally suggested that expression of mutant RABA1b resulted in alteration of the morphology of the TGN. Because the TGN also plays fundamental roles in the secretory pathway, we then examined the effects of NI mutants of RABA1b and other RABA subgroups on the steady state localization of FLS2-GFP at the PM. For this purpose, chimeric genes composed of a 35S promoter, mutant cDNA for each RABA member, and a 35S terminator were introduced with FLS2-GFP into N. benthamiana cells. Among mutants of the six RABA members we examined, only RABA1bN126I caused substantial alteration in FLS2 distribution. In the RABA1bN126I-expressing cells, FLS2 was mainly observed as scattered tiny dots throughout the cytoplasm, and weak localization to the PM was also visible (Figure 8A). Moreover, constitutive expression of RABA1bN126I affected distribution of mRFP-SYP61; mRFP-SYP61 was also dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as observed in the induced-expression experiment (Figure 8B). These results indicated that transport of newly synthesized FLS2 to the PM was disturbed by defective trafficking around the SYP61-positive TGN in the mutant-expressing cells. [[FIGURE]] We also tested for an inhibitory effect of RABA1bN126I on transport of another PM protein, BOR1, a boron efflux carrier whose localization is regulated by external boron concentration (CITATION, CITATION). Steady state localization of BOR1 was slightly different from that of FLS2; BOR1-GFP was observed on punctate organelles in addition to the PM, probably reflecting its constitutive internalization (CITATION; Figure 9A). Coexpression of RABA1bN126I also resulted in alteration of this localization pattern; BOR1 predominantly localized in scattered small dots in the cytoplasm, and only weak PM localization was detected in cells expressing RABA1bN126I (Figure 9B). This result again suggested that RABA1b acts in the secretory pathway. By contrast, the NI mutants of RABA4c and RABA6a had no visible effect on presentation of FLS2-GFP and BOR1-GFP on the PM (Figures 8A, 9C, and 9D). In a similar manner, NI mutants of RABA2c, RABA3, and RABA5c caused no substantial change in the PM localization of FLS2 (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). The inhibitory effect of RABA1bN126I in secretory trafficking of FLS2 was attributable to specific inhibition of the RABA1 function because estradiol-induced coexpression of wild-type RABA1b, but not RABA4c or RABA6a, restored the PM localization of FLS2-GFP (Figure 8C). These results again support the specific and distinct functions of RABA subgroups in plant cells. [[FIGURE]] We next asked whether three RABA members with different functions, RABA1b, RABA4c, and RABA6a, reside on different subcellular compartments or on the same organelle. We thus directly compared the localization of these proteins using combinations of different fluorescent proteins. Expression of fluorescent protein–tagged RABA members was induced by incubation with 10 μM estradiol for 1 h. RABA1b, RABA4c, and RABA6a localized at various sizes of dot-like structures (Figure 10A). These RABA members exhibited good colocalization on comparatively large compartments; however, they did not overlap at small vesicular structures (Figure 10A). This different localization is not due to the difference in fused fluorescent proteins because RABA members tagged with different fluorescent proteins localized to the same compartments (Figure 10B). [[FIGURE]] In Arabidopsis root epidermal cells, comparatively large compartments bearing RABA1b partly overlap with the TGN marked by SYP43 or VHA-a1 (CITATION). Thus, we examined whether RABA members are also localized on the TGN in our experimental system. When coexpressed in FLS2-GFP–expressing N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells, Venus-tagged RABA members and mRFP-SYP61 frequently colocalized on larger particles, while mRFP-SYP61 did not target to RABA-positive smaller vesicles (Figure 10C). The colocalization of SYP61 and RABA1b was not affected by RABA4cN128I or RABA6aN126I, which exerted inhibitory effects on endocytic transport of FLS2 (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). These results indicated that three RABA members localize on different compartments with overlap on the TGN, which is consistent with their different functions in transport of FLS2.
!~MM~! We used 3- to 5-week-old N. benthamiana plants for agroinfiltration. Expression vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101:pMP90. A single colony of each transformant was cultured in 5 mL YEB medium (5 g beef extract, 1 g yeast extract, 5 g Suc, and 0.49 g MgSO4·7H2O dissolved in 1 liter of water) supplemented with 10 μg/mL rifampicin at 30°C overnight. The bacteria were collected and resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.15 mM acetosyringone, pH 5.5) at 0.02 (FLS2-GFP) or 0.1 (other constructs) OD600. The agrobacteria carrying p19 were resuspended together with all samples (CITATION). The resuspended agrobacteria were infiltrated into leaves of N. benthamiana with gentle pressure using syringes without needles. For coexpression of proteins, bacterial strains with different constructs were mixed before inoculation. Samples were observed within 48 h after infiltration. For induction of endocytosis of FLS2, 100 μM flg22 peptide was infiltrated into leaves expressing FLS2-GFP. For estradiol-dependent induction of gene expression, β-estradiol (10 μM) was applied for 1 to 3 h before treatment with flg22. FM4-64 (50 μM; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes; T13320) dissolved in distilled water was infiltrated to the leaf tissue of N. benthamiana from the abaxial surface. Samples were incubated at room temperature for indicated times and observed under the confocal laser scanning microscope. The plasmid containing pFLS2:FLS2-GFP was described previously (CITATION). For mRFP-SYP61, VHA-a1-mRFP, TagRFP-ARA7, and TagRFP-VAMP727 constructs, PCR-amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into pGWB1 containing the 35S promoter (CITATION). For RABA members (RABA1b, RABA2c, RABA3, RABA4c, RABA5c, and RABA6a), cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 3. Amplified wild-type and mutant cDNA fragments were conjugated with cDNA for fluorescent proteins and cloned into pMDC7 (CITATION) for estradiol-inducible expression. For constitutive expression, cDNA fragments of RABA were introduced into pB7WGY2 and pH7WGR2 containing YFP and RFP, respectively (CITATION). For single-color imaging, GFP was excited by a diode-pumped solid-state laser (Cobolt Blues) at 473 nm and observed under a microscope (BX51; Olympus) equipped with a confocal scanner unit (CSU10; Yokogawa Electric) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (ORCA-AG; Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were processed with IPLab software (BD Biosciences) and Photoshop CS5 (Adobe). Multicolor observation was performed using an LSM710 or LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) with the oil immersion lens (×63, numerical aperture = 1.40). Spectral unmixing (if necessary) and processing of obtained images were performed using ZEN 2008 or ZEN 2011 software (Carl Zeiss). For dual-color imaging, GFP and Venus were excited at 488 nm, and the emission was collected between 501 and 545 nm. mRFP and TagRFP were excited at 561 nm, and the emission was collected between 570 and 615 nm. For three-color imaging, samples expressing fluorescent proteins (combinations of three of four XFPs: GFP, Venus, mRFP, and TagRFP) were excited at 488 and 561 nm, and the emission was collected between 484 and 640 nm. For three- or four-color imaging using CFP, samples were excited at 405, 488, and 561 nm, and the emission was collected between 411 and 633 nm. The colocalization analysis was performed as described previously (CITATION) with Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). The leaves from infiltrated N. benthamiana were placed on a glass slide (76 × 26 mm; Matsunami) and covered with a cover slip 0.12- to 0.17-mm thick (24 × 60 mm; Matsunami), and epidermal cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E and a CFI Apo TIRF ×100 H/1.49–numerical aperture objective) equipped with a Nikon TIRF2 system. GFP was simultaneously excited with a 488-nm laser. All images were acquired with an Andor iXonEM electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera; each frame was exposed for 100 ms. The acquired images were prepared and analyzed using Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems) and NIS-Elements software (Nikon). The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers for the genes mentioned in this article are At5g46330 (FLS2), At1g28490 (SYP61), At2g28520 (VHA-a1), At4g19640 (ARA7), At3G54300 (VAMP727), At1g16920 (RABA1b), At3g46830 (RABA2c), At1g01200 (RABA3), At5g47960 (RABA4c), At2g43130 (RABA5c), and At1g73640 (RABA6a).
