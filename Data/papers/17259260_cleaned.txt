!~ABS~! Plants make full use of light signals to determine the timing of flowering. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a blue/UV-A photoreceptor, CRYPTOCHROME 2 (cry2), and a red/far-red photoreceptor, PHYTOCHROME B (phyB), are two major photoreceptors that control flowering. The light stimuli for the regulation of flowering are perceived by leaves. We have recently shown that phyB expression in mesophyll but not in vascular bundles suppresses the expression of a key flowering regulator, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), in vascular bundles. In this study, we asked where in the leaf cry2 perceives light stimuli to regulate flowering. To answer this question, we established transgenic Arabidopsis lines in which the cry2–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was expressed under the control of organ/tissue-specific promoters in a cry2-deficient mutant background. Analysis of these lines revealed that expression of cry2-GFP in vascular bundles, but not in epidermis or mesophyll, rescued the late flowering phenotype. We further confirmed that cry2-GFP expressed in vascular bundles increased FT expression only in vascular bundles. Hence, in striking contrast with phyB, cry2 most likely regulates FT expression in a cell-autonomous manner.
!~RES~! To determine the functional site of cry2 in leaves, we established transgenic lines that expressed cry2-GFP under the control of tissue-specific promoters on the cry2 mutant background. For this purpose, the CAB3 (for mesophyll) (CITATION), SUC2 (for vascular bundles) (CITATION), Sultr1;3 (for vascular bundles) (CITATION), At ML1 (for epidermis) (CITATION), and CER6 (for epidermis) (CITATION) promoters were employed. As negative controls, we expressed cry2-GFP under the control of the UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO) (for the shoot apex) (CITATION; CITATION) and the At3g25820/25830 (for roots) (CITATION) promoters. The CRY2-GFP gene was fused to these promoters and introduced into the cry2 mutant of Arabidopsis by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated method. As a control, the CRY2-GFP gene was expressed under the control of the authentic CRY2 promoter (CITATION). We established several homozygous lines for each construct. The lines with the CAB3, SUC2, Sultr1;3, At ML1, CER6, UFO, At3g25820/25830, and CRY2 promoters are referred to as pCAB-C2G, pSUC-C2G, pSultr-C2G, pML-C2G, pCER-C2G, pUFO-C2G, pAt3g-C2G, and pCRY-C2G lines, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis with an anti-GFP antibody revealed that a protein of the predicted size (96 kD) was expressed in all of the lines (Figure 1A ). [[FIGURE]] We first examined the expression levels of cry2-GFP protein in independent pCRY-C2G lines with an anti-cry2 antibody to choose a standard line in which cry2-GFP was expressed at the endogenous level (Figure 1B). Seedlings of this line were then observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Figures 2A , 2I, 3A , 3I, and 3Q). GFP fluorescence was observed exclusively in the nucleus, as has been reported previously (CITATION). cry2-GFP expression was detected in all three major organs, namely, cotyledons, the hypocotyl, and the root in pCRY-C2G. In these organs, cry2-GFP was expressed in every tissue, including epidermis, mesophyll, cortex, and vascular bundles, except the root tip. In addition, expression in the shoot apex was detected. These results were consistent with the previously reported patterns of authentic cry2 expression (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] In contrast with pCRY-C2G, other lines exhibited organ/tissue-specific expression patterns (Figures 2 and 3). In pCAB-C2G, expression was observed exclusively in the mesophyll of both cotyledons and young true leaves (Figures 2B, 2J, and 3B). Semiquantitative analysis of GFP fluorescence indicated that the expression level in pCAB-C2G mesophyll was ∼1.8 times higher than that in pCRY-C2G mesophyll. In addition, cry2-GFP was expressed in the cortex of hypocotyl at lower levels (Figure 3J). In pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G, GFP expression was observed only in vascular bundles in all organs (Figures 2C, 2D, 3K, 3L, 3S, and 3T). No expression was observed in the shoot apexes. Semiquantitative analysis indicated that GFP expression levels in pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G in cotyledonous vascular bundles were ∼1.5 and 2.7 times higher than that in pCRY-C2G, respectively. Expression was restricted to epidermis of the aerial part of the seedlings in pML-C2G and pCER-C2G (Figures 2M, 2N, 3M, and 3N). Expression levels in pML-C2G and pCER-C2G in cotyledons were ∼3.8 and 4.7 times higher, respectively, than in pCRY-C2G. We also confirmed that expression was restricted to the shoot apex in pUFO-C2G and to the root in pAt3g-C2G (Figures 2G and 3W). A late flowering phenotype is exhibited by cry2 mutants under long-day (LD) conditions in the presence of phyB (CITATION). We examined whether this phenotype was complemented in our transgenic lines (Figure 4A ). As expected, full complementation was observed in pCRY-C2G. The flowering time was neither advanced nor delayed compared with the wild type. In the pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G lines, which expressed cry2-GFP only in vascular bundles, the late flowering phenotype was also complemented. The other lines, pCAB-C2G (mesophyll), pML-C2G (epidermis), pCER-C2G (epidermis), pUFO-C2G (shoot apex), and pAt3g-C2G (root), did not complement and flowered as late as the parental cry2 mutant. Hence, cry2-GFP expression in vascular bundles, but not in other tissues, effectively accelerated the flowering in LD. [[FIGURE]] We then examined whether or not pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G responded normally to changes in daylength. In the short-day (SD) condition, flowering is not delayed in the cry2 mutant compared with the wild type (CITATION). As expected, pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G flowered as late as pCRY-C2G and the wild type (Figure 4B). Hence, cry2-GFP in pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G did not accelerate flowering in SD. Flowering times in other lines were not affected by the transgene and were the same as the control plants. The cry2 mutant exhibits long hypocotyl phenotype under blue light (CITATION). Hence, we checked whether this phenotype was complemented in the transgenic lines (Figure 4C). As expected, full complementation was observed in pCRY-C2G. However, in contrast with the flowering phenotype, none of the lines showed full complementation, although partial complementation was observed in pSUC-C2G, pML-C2G, and pCER-C2G. To confirm the tissue-specific expression of cry2-GFP in pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G, the CRY2-GFP mRNA levels in isolated vascular bundles and mesophyll protoplasts were quantified by RT-PCR (Figure 5 ). Mesophyll cells and vascular bundles were isolated from cotyledons as described (CITATION). We confirmed the purity of the samples by checking the expression levels of marker genes, Sultr and RbcS (data not shown) (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Consistent with microscopic observation (Figures 2 and 3), the CRY2-GFP mRNA levels in mesophyll cells were much higher in pCRY-C2G and pCAB-C2G than in other lines (Figure 5). Consistent with the semiquantification of the GFP fluorescence (see above), the level was higher in pCAB-C2G than in pCRY-C2G. Conversely, the CRY2-GFP mRNA was detected in vascular bundles in pSUC-C2G, pSultr-C2G, and pCRY-C2G (Figure 5). The levels were much lower in other lines, except pCAB-C2G. This might be due to the contamination of the vascular bundle samples with mesophyll cells. It should be noted that cry2-GFP in pCAB-C2G failed to affect flowering regardless of the high CRY2-GFP mRNA expression in the mesophyll (∼10 times higher than that in the vascular bundles of pCRY-C2G). To examine quantitative relationships between cry2-GFP expression in vascular bundles and flowering times, we examined several independent pSUC-C2G, pSultr-C2G, and pCRY-C2G lines under LD. The expression levels of CRY2-GFP mRNA in vascular bundles were determined by RT-PCR and plotted against flowering times (Figure 6 ). The expression level and the flowering time correlated well. All points were laid on a single curve containing the point for the wild-type plant. Flowering was advanced depending on the expression levels of CRY2-GFP up to about the endogenous level. The response was then more or less saturated. These results further supported that the flowering time was dependent on the expression of cry2-GFP in vascular bundles but not in other tissues. [[FIGURE]] cry2 advances flowering by inducing the expression of a key flowering regulator, FT (CITATION). FT expression in the wild type exhibits diurnal oscillation in LD (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, to confirm that cry2-GFP expressed in vascular bundles regulated flowering by increasing FT expression, we monitored the levels of FT expression during a 24-h period on day 10 in pCRY-C2G, pCAB-C2G, and pSUC-C2G. Total mRNA was extracted from cotyledons every 3 h and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. The FT expression patterns in pCRY-C2G and pSUC-C2G were almost identical to that in the wild type (Figure 7 ). The expression peaked at the end of the light period in these lines. Hence, the effects of cry2-GFP expressed in vascular bundles were indistinguishable from those of the endogenous cry2. By contrast, the levels of FT expression remained low in pCAB-C2G and the cry2 mutant. These results were fully consistent with the flowering phenotype (Figure 4A). [[FIGURE]] It has been shown that FT expression is restricted to vascular bundles in either the presence or absence of phyB (CITATION; CITATION). We examined whether this was true in pSUC-C2G and pSultr-C2G. Mesophyll cells and vascular bundles were isolated from cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and examined for FT mRNA expression by RT-PCR (Figure 8 ). As expected, induction of FT mRNA expression was observed only in vascular bundles. Although cyr2-GFP was expressed at a high level in mesophyll in pCAB-C2G (Figure 5), FT induction was not observed in either mesophyll or in vascular bundles in this line. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis thaliana cry2 mutant used for this report was cry2-2 (CITATION) on the Columbia (Col) ecotype background, in which the CRY2 gene is completely deleted. Seeds were surface-sterilized and sown on 0.6% agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog medium without sucrose. The plates were kept in the dark at 4°C for 24 h and then placed under LD for 10 d to obtain seedlings. Seeds were sown directly on rockwool for measurement of flowering times. Flowering times were scored by determining the number of rosette leaves when the first flower opened (CITATION). Plants grown in LD (16 h of white light at ∼35 μmol m−2 s−1 from white fluorescent light tubes [FLR40SW/M/36-B; Hitachi] and 8 h of darkness) and SD (8 h of white light at ∼70 μmol m−2 s−1 from white fluorescent light tubes and 16 h of darkness) received the same total fluence of light. For hypocotyl length measurements, plants were grown in continuous blue light (3 μmol m−2 s−1 from fluorescent light tubes [FL20S·B; Toshiba]) for 7 d. Hypocotyl lengths were measured by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The binary vector pPZP211/NP was derived from the binary plant transformation vector pPZP211 (CITATION). pPZP211/NP has a neomycin phosphotransferase II gene driven by the nopaline synthase promoter for selection of plants on kanamycin. The full-length CRY2 cDNA was PCR-amplified from a cDNA library using specific primers with XbaI-SpeI and ClaI tails. The GFP was PCR-amplified from the pPZP211/Bpro (CITATION) plasmid using specific primer sequences with ClaI and SacII tails. CRY2 and GFP were fused in the binary vector pPZP211/NP (pPZP211/NP/CRY2-GFP). Organ/tissue-specific promoters were inserted into pPZP211/NP/CRY2-GFP using the SalI, XbaI, or SpeI site. The CRY2 (∼1200 bp), CAB3 (∼1550 bp), SUC2 (∼3500 bp), Sultr1;3 (∼2700 bp), At ML1 (∼3700 bp), CER6 (∼3500 bp), UFO (∼3800 bp), and At3g25820/25830 (∼2450 bp) promoters were PCR-amplified from Col genomic DNA using specific primers with SalI, XbaI, or SpeI tails. Specific sequences for each primer pair were as follows: CRY2-cDNA-F, 5′-GCTCTAGAACTAGTATGAAGATGGACAAAAAGAC-3′; CRY2-cDNA-R, 5′-CCATCGATTTTGCAACCATTTTTTCCCAAACTTG-3′; CRY2-pro-F, 5′-ACTTGTCGACAATTGCAAAAAGAAATGCTACTC-3′; CRY2-pro-R, 5′-GCTCTAGAGTTATTATGATCACAGATGAATCAAAGAT-3′; CAB3-pro-F, 5′-CGTCTAGAAATCAAGAGAAAATGTGATTCTCGG-3′; CAB3-pro-R, 5′-GCACTAGTGAAACTTTTTGTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTG-3′; SUC2-pro-F, 5′-ACTTGTCGACTTTGTCATACATTTATTTGCCACAAG-3′; SUC2-pro-R, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTGACAAACCAAGAAAGTAAGAAAAAAA-3′; Sultr1;3-pro-F, 5′-CGTCTAGAGTTTTTCTTCATAGGTTTCGTGATAAT-3′; Sultr1;3-pro-R, 5′-GCTCTAGATGCTATGTGTGTTTTGTAGCAAAC-3′; At ML1-pro-F, 5′-ACTTGTCGACCAAGAGATATTGGGTTGCTACACAA-3′; At ML1-pro-R, 5′-GGACTAGTGATGATGATGGATGCCTATCAATTTTT-3′; CER6-pro-F, 5′-ACTTGTCGACAATGATGAGCAAAAGTGTTTGC-3′; CER6-pro-R, 5′-TGCTCTAGACGTCGGAGAGTTTTAATGTATAATTG-3′; UFO-pro-F, 5′-ACTTGTCGACGAATTCTCTGTTTTAATTGCCCCA-3′; UFO-pro-R, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTAGCTGAAAAATGAAAAGATTTGG-3′; At3g25820/25830-pro-F, 5′-CGTCTAGATGTCAATTTTCATGGCACATCGAG-3′; and At3g25820/25830-pro-R, 5′-GGACTAGTGATTTAGTAGACTATTCTCTTATTCGTGGC-3′. The Arabidopsis cry2 mutant was transformed with vectors described above by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated floral dip method (CITATION). Transformed plants were selected on agar medium containing 25 mg/L of kanamycin. cry2 and cry2-GFP proteins were detected by immunoblotting of protein extracts from seedlings. Protein extraction, SDS-PAGE, protein blotting, and immunodetection were performed as described by CITATION. Proteins were extracted from the seedlings at the end of the light period on day 10 and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-Arabidopsis cry2 antibody (CITATION) and anti-GFP antibody (Nacalai Tesque). Ten-day-old seedlings grown under LD were observed at around the end of the light period with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Seedlings were vacuum-infiltrated in water before observation. For shoot apex and hypocotyl observations, seedlings were embedded in 5% low melting point agarose to prepare longitudinal sections without fixation. Green fluorescence from GFP (observation, 500 to 530 nm; excitation, 488 nm) and red fluorescence from chlorophyll (observation, >560 nm; excitation, 543 nm) were overlaid electronically. To semiquantify the GFP fluorescence, the gain was set to 720 and the fluorescence intensity within the nuclear region was integrated for each nucleus. For each line, >20 nuclei from several samples were quantified and averaged. Mesophyll protoplasts and vascular bundles were isolated from the 10-d-old seedlings at around the end of the light period as described (CITATION). Total RNA was extracted from the whole seedlings using Sepazol super (Nacalai Tesque) following the manufacturer's instructions. For tissue specificity analysis, total RNA was extracted from 1 × 104 mesophyll protoplasts or from vascular bundles prepared from 20 cotyledons using the RNAqueous Micro isolation kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions (CITATION). The samples were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with the oligo(dT) primer using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TUB2/TUB3 genes, which are known to be expressed at similar levels in different tissues, were used as an internal control for normalization of the PCR reaction. Note that no CRY2 mRNA is expressed in the parental cry2-2 mutant because the CRY2 gene is deleted in this allele. Specific sequences for each primer pair were as follows: CRY2-RT-F, 5′-AATCCCGCGTTACAAGGC-3′; CRY2-RT-R, 5′-TTCCGAGTTCCACACCAG-3′; FT-RT-F, 5′-TATCTCCATTGGTTGGTGACTG-3′; FT-RT-R, 5′-GGGACTTGGATTTTCGTAACAC-3′; TUB2/3-RT-F, 5′-CCAGCTTTGGTGATTTGAAC-3′; and TUB2/3-RT-R, 5′-CAAGCTTTCGGAGGTCAGAG-3′. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in 200-μL tubes with a Rotor-Gene RG-3000A (Corbett Research) using SYBR green to monitor double-strand DNA synthesis. The reaction mixture contained 7.5 μL of Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen), 1 μL of cDNA, and 200 nM gene-specific primers in a final volume of 15 μL. The following thermal cycling profile was used for all PCRs: 95°C for 20 s, ∼55 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 20 s. Data were analyzed using Rotor-Gene 6.0.16 software (Corbett Research). Negative template controls were run in these experiments, and no signal was observed (data not shown).
