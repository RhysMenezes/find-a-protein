!~ABS~! Nudix (for nucleoside diphosphates linked to some moiety X) hydrolases act to hydrolyze ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, nucleotide sugars, coenzymes, or dinucleoside polyphosphates. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains 27 genes encoding Nudix hydrolase homologues (AtNUDX1 to -27) with a predicted distribution in the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Previously, cytosolic Nudix hydrolases (AtNUDX1 to -11 and -25) were characterized. Here, we conducted a characterization of organelle-type AtNUDX proteins (AtNUDX12 to -24, -26, and -27). AtNUDX14 showed pyrophosphohydrolase activity toward both ADP-ribose and ADP-glucose, although its Km value was approximately 100-fold lower for ADP-ribose (13.0 ± 0.7 μm) than for ADP-glucose (1,235 ± 65 μm). AtNUDX15 hydrolyzed not only reduced coenzyme A (118.7 ± 3.4 μm) but also a wide range of its derivatives. AtNUDX19 showed pyrophosphohydrolase activity toward both NADH (335.3 ± 5.4 μm) and NADPH (36.9 ± 3.5 μm). AtNUDX23 had flavin adenine dinucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase activity (9.1 ± 0.9 μm). Both AtNUDX26 and AtNUDX27 hydrolyzed diadenosine polyphosphates (n = 4–5). A confocal microscopic analysis using a green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed that AtNUDX15 is distributed in mitochondria and AtNUDX14 -19, -23, -26, and -27 are distributed in chloroplasts. These AtNUDX mRNAs were detected ubiquitously in various Arabidopsis tissues. The T-DNA insertion mutants of AtNUDX13, -14, -15, -19, -20, -21, -25, -26, and -27 did not exhibit any phenotypical differences under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that Nudix hydrolases in Arabidopsis control a variety of metabolites and are pertinent to a wide range of physiological processes.
!~RES~! Predictions of the existence of transit peptide and cleavage sites in the deduced amino acid sequences of all organelle-type AtNUDXs were made with the TargetP prediction program (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/; Supplemental Table S1). Consequently, it was predicted that AtNUDX12 to -18 are localized in mitochondria and AtNUDX19 to -24, -26, and -27 are localized in chloroplasts. Similar results were obtained by an analysis using the PSORT prediction program (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). Among the predicted organelle-type AtNUDXs, mitochondrial AtNUDX15 and chloroplastic AtNUDX22 contained the conserved motif LLTXR(SA)X3RX3GX3FPGG (designated UPF0035 in the PROSITE database), which is found upstream of the Nudix motif to hydrolyze CoA, like cytosolic AtNUDX11, human NUDT7, mouse NUDT7, yeast Pcd1, and C. elegans Y87G2A.14 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Fig. 1A). The deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to the mature AtNUDX15 shared high homology (73.8%) with that of AtNUDX22. [[FIGURE]] The sequence of chloroplastic AtNUDX19 retained the SQPWPFPxS motif with NADH pyrophosphohydrolases such as human NUDT12, E. coli Orf257, and yeast Npy1 proteins (CITATION; CITATION, CITATION; Fig. 1B). The sequences corresponding to the mature chloroplastic AtNUDX26 showed 57.7% homology with that of AtNUDX27. Both AtNUDX26 and AtNUDX27 shared high similarity (69.8% and 59.2%, respectively) to a Nudix hydrolase that acts on asymmetric diadenosine tetraphosphates (Ap4A) from Lupinus angustifolius (CITATION). The deduced amino acid sequences of other predicted organelle-type AtNUDXs showed no significant homology to any conserved motifs, except the Nudix motif, in Nudix hydrolases from various organisms. A Nudix hydrolase, E. coli MutT, has oxidized nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase activity, hydrolyzing all canonical nucleoside triphosphates but with a preference for 8-oxo-(d)GTP, the oxidized form of the free guanine nucleotide, by attacking ROS (CITATION; CITATION). These oxidized guanine nucleoside triphosphates would cause both replicational and transcriptional errors, since they pair with adenine and cytosine with almost the same efficiency (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, E. coli MutT functions in the prevention of mutagenic consequences. Recently, we demonstrated that one of the cytosolic AtNUDXs, AtNUDX1, acts on the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-(d)GTP and plays an important role in protection against oxidative DNA and RNA damage in plant cells (CITATION; CITATION). First, to identify an 8-oxo-(d)GTP pyrophosphohydrolase in the predicted organelle-type AtNUDXs, we examined the effect of the expression of these AtNUDXs on the rate of spontaneous mutation toward rifampicin resistance in the E. coli mutT− strain, CC101T, which was devoid of its own 8-oxo-(d)GTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity (CITATION). As shown in Supplemental Table S2, the mutation frequency of CC101T cells carrying the cDNAs for each mature AtNUDX protein in the absence of the predicted transit peptide cloned into the pTrc100 expression vector was almost the same as that of the cells transfected with an empty pTrc100. These results suggest that none of the mitochondrial and chloroplastic AtNUDXs contains the MutT-type 8-oxo-(d)GTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity, although it is possible that these AtNUDXs would be inactive following expression in E. coli. To characterize the recombinant forms of predicted organelle-type AtNUDXs, each recombinant form of the mature AtNUDX proteins in the absence of predicted mitochondrial or chloroplastic transit peptide at the N terminus was produced using E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and purified from the extract using a HiTrap chelating column. The hydrolytic activities of these enzymes for various types of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives were measured in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ by HPLC (Table I). Among the mitochondrial AtNUDXs, AtNUDX14 hydrolyzed ADP-Rib and ADP-Glc. A reaction product, AMP, was detected in the reaction mixture by HPLC analysis (data not shown), indicating that ADP-Rib and ADP-Glc are hydrolyzed by the enzyme to AMP and Rib 5-P and to AMP and Glc 1-P, respectively. The Km value for ADP-Rib (13.0 ± 0.7 μm) of AtNUDX14 was approximately 100-fold lower than that for ADP-Glc (1,235 ± 65 μm; Table II). On the other hand, the Vmax value for ADP-Glc (30.0 ± 1.40 μmol min−1 mg−1) was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that for ADP-Rib (12.5 ± 0.30 μmol min−1 mg−1). Mitochondrial AtNUDX15 hydrolyzed CoA similar to cytosolic AtNUDX11, as reported previously (Table I). A reaction product, 3′,5′-ADP, was detected (data not shown), indicating that CoAs are hydrolyzed by the enzyme to 3′,5′-ADP and 4′-phosphopantetheine. The enzyme showed high affinity for CoA (118.7 ± 3.4 μm) compared with the other CoA pyrophosphohydrolases, such as yeast Pcd1 (CITATION), mouse NUDT7 (CITATION), and C. elegans Y87G2A.15 (CITATION; Table III). No activity toward any other substrate tested here was detected in mitochondrial AtNUDX12, -13, -16, -17, and -18. Substrate specificity of the predicted organelle-type AtNUDXs The activities of the recombinant AtNUDX proteins (0.5–1 μg) were measured at 37°C with 5 mm Mg2+ in the absence or presence of 1 mm DTT, as described in “Materials and Methods.” All values for specific activity are in μmol min−1 mg−1. Data in parentheses are values in the presence of 1 mm DTT. Data are means of three independent determinations ± sd. n.d., Not detected. Comparison of kinetic parameters of ADP-sugar and FAD pyrophosphohydrolases in Arabidopsis, E. coli, human, M. jannaschii, Synechococcus PCC7002, P. thiaminolyticus, and T4 bacteriophage The standard assay was used with concentrations of 5 to 1,500 μm for ADP-Rib, ADP-Glu, and FAD at 37°C with 5 mm Mg2+ as described in “Materials and Methods.” Data are means of three independent determinations ± sd. –, Not determined. Comparison of kinetic parameters of CoA pyrophosphohydrolases in Arabidopsis, C. elegans, mouse, and yeast The standard assay was used with concentrations of 5 to 1,000 μm for CoA at 37°C with 5 mm Mg2+ as described in “Materials and Methods.” Data are means of three independent determinations ± sd. –, Not determined. Among chloroplastic AtNUDXs, AtNUDX19 showed NADH and NADPH pyrophosphohydrolase activities (Table I). A reaction product, AMP or 2′,5′-ADP, was detected by HPLC analysis (data not shown), indicating that NADH and NADPH are hydrolyzed to reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMNH) and AMP and to NMNH and 2′,5′-ADP, respectively. The Km value for NADH (335.3 ± 5.4 μm) of the enzyme was higher than that of other NADH pyrophosphohydrolases such as cytosolic AtNUDXs (CITATION), yeast Npy1 (CITATION), and human NUDT12 (CITATION; Table IV). AtNUDX19 showed high affinity for NADPH (36.9 ± 3.5 μm) compared with that for NADH. AtNUDX23 had pyrophosphohydrolase activity toward both FAD and ADP-Rib (Table I). Reaction product(s) FMN and/or AMP were detected (data not shown). The Km value for FAD (9.1 ± 0.9 μm) was markedly lower than that of Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus YZGD (Tirrel et al., 2006) and T4 bacteriophage nudE.1 (CITATION; Table II). On the other hand, the enzyme showed low affinity (386 ± 76 μm) for ADP-Rib. AtNUDX26 hydrolyzed Ap4A and Ap5A (Tables I and V). Ap4A and diadenosine triphosphates (Ap3A) were hydrolyzed to ATP and AMP and to ATP and ADP, respectively (data not shown). Although the enzyme also hydrolyzed 8-oxo-(d)GTP and deoxynucleoside triphosphates, these activities were much lower than those toward Ap4A and Ap5A (Table I). In fact, AtNUDX26 could not complement the mutator phenotype of the E. coli mutT− strain (Supplemental Table S2), indicating that the enzyme is not associated with the sanitization of nucleotide pools in vivo. AtNUDX27 hydrolyzed only Ap5A to ATP and ADP (Tables I and V). AtNUDX22 showed no activity toward CoA or any other substrates, although it had the conserved UPF0035 motif for CoA pyrophosphohydrolase (Fig. 1A). AtNUDX20, -21, and -24 also had no activity toward any other substrate tested here. Comparison of kinetic parameters of NAD(P)H pyrophosphohydrolases in Arabidopsis, yeast, and human The standard assay was used with concentrations of 5 to 1,000 μm NAD(P)H at 37°C with 5 mm Mg2+ as described in “Materials and Methods.” Data are means of three independent determinations ± sd. Comparison of kinetic parameters of ApnA pyrophosphohydrolases in Arabidopsis, L. angustifolius, and T. thermophilus The standard assay was used with concentrations of 5 to 1,000 μm ApnA at 37°C with 5 mm Mg2+ as described in “Materials and Methods.” Data are means of three independent determinations ± sd. –, Not determined. Recently, Olejnik et al. (2007) reported that AtNUDX13 had activities specific for long-chain ApnA under reducing conditions treated with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), suggesting that treatment with the reducing agent was required for the detection of the hydrolytic activity of Nudix hydrolases. Therefore, we assayed the hydrolytic activities in the reaction medium containing the reducing agent, 1 mm DTT, as shown in the parentheses in Table I. AtNUDX13 hydrolyzed Ap5A only under the reducing conditions. In addition, the activities of AtNUDX26 and -27 toward ApnA in the presence of 1 mm DTT were increased compared with those in the absence of the agent. On the other hand, the CoA pyrophosphohydrolase activity of AtNUDX15 was decreased to 33% (Table I). No activity was detected in AtNUDX12, -16, -17, -18, -20, -21, -22, and -24 toward any substrates tested under the reducing conditions (data not shown). Previously, we demonstrated that no activity toward any substrates tested was detected in the cytosolic AtNUDX4, -5, and -9 proteins (CITATION). So we assayed the hydrolytic activities of these enzymes under the reducing conditions treated with 1 mm DTT, but we could not detect the enzyme activities toward any substrates (data not shown). These findings suggest that treatment with DTT is essential for the ApnA pyrophosphohydrolases such as AtNUDX13, -26, and -27. CoA pyrophosphohydrolases, such as S. cerevisiae Pcd1, mouse NUDT7, and C. elegans Y87G2A.14, were active toward various CoA derivatives (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we examined the substrate specificity for various CoA derivatives of AtNUDXs with CoA pyrophosphohydrolase activity. Mitochondrial AtNUDX15 was highly active toward oxidized CoA the same as yeast Pcd1, while cytosolic AtNUDX11 hydrolyzed malonyl-CoA (Table VI). Interestingly, both enzymes showed high levels of activity toward medium- and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, including hexanoyl (C6:0)-CoA, lauroyl (C12:0)-CoA, myristoyl (C14:0)-CoA, and palmitoyl (C16:0)-CoA. Substrate specificity of CoA pyrophosphohydrolases Activity with CoA and CoA derivatives was measured at 37°C with 5 mm Mg2+ as described in “Materials and Methods.” Results are expressed as percentage of the degradation rate obtained with CoA. n.d., Not detected. –, Not determined. As the Nudix hydrolases require various divalent cations for their activities, we analyzed the effect of several divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+) on the activities of mitochondrial and chloroplastic AtNUDXs. Mg2+ (5 mm) was most effective for the AtNUDX14 activity toward ADP-Rib. The activity in the presence of 5 mm Mn2+ was approximately 10% of that in the presence of Mg2+. The activities of AtNUDX15 and -19 in the presence of 5 mm Mn2+ were 223% and 113%, respectively, of those in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+. Zn2+ was the most effective divalent ion for AtNUDX23 activity toward FAD. The presence of 5 mm Zn2+ resulted in 410% of the activity compared with that with 5 mm Mg2+. However, Mn2+ and Zn2+ concentrations of 5 mm are approximately 1,000-fold higher than typical levels in growing cells (CITATION). The activities of AtNUDX15, -19, and -23 in the presence of 5 μm Mn2+ or Zn2+ were not detected. Therefore, in most cases, Mg2+ is likely to be physically the most relevant divalent cation for all organelle-type AtNUDXs in vivo. The activities of AtNUDX12, -16, -17, -18, -20, -21, -22, and -24 toward any substrates were not observed even under the presence of several divalent cations. Next, we confirmed the subcellular distributions of predicted mitochondrial (AtNUDX14 and -15) and chloroplastic (AtNUDX19, -23, -26, and -27) AtNUDXs, having hydrolysis activities in vitro, in plant cells using their GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 2). The full-length AtNUDX cDNAs, including the transit peptides, were fused in frame with GFP at the C terminus and then transformed into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells or Arabidopsis T87 cultured cells. The fluorescence of the GFP fusion proteins in the transgenic cells was monitored using confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 2A, the fluorescence of the AtNUDX15-GFP fusion protein was colocalized with mitochondria stained by MitoTraker Orange in the tobacco BY-2 cells. On the other hand, the AtNUDX14-GFP fluorescence was not detected in mitochondria but was colocalized with chlorophyll autofluorescence in the Arabidopsis T87 cells (Fig. 2B), although it was predicted to be distributed in mitochondria based on its deduced amino acid sequence. The fluorescence of the AtNUDX19-GFP fusion protein was detected in both chloroplasts and cytosol, but it was mainly distributed in the chloroplasts. The fluorescence of AtNUDX23, -26, or -27-GFP fusion protein was colocalized with chlorophyll autofluorescence. [[FIGURE]] Semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed to determine the tissue-specific expression of predicted organelle-type AtNUDX mRNAs. As shown in Figure 3, almost all of the AtNUDX mRNAs were expressed ubiquitously in the rosette leaves, stems, cauline leaves, inflorescences, and roots. On the other hand, the level of AtNUDX18 mRNA was lowest in the rosette leaves and highest in the inflorescence among the various tissues. The AtNUDX20 mRNA was expressed specifically in the rosette and cauline leaves. The expression of AtNUDX24 mRNA was observed in the inflorescences and rosette and cauline leaves. These results suggest that the expression of AtNUDX18, -20, and -24 mRNAs is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, although their substrate specificities remain unclear. Similar expression patterns of the organelle-type AtNUDXs in the tissues are observed in the GENEVESTIGATOR Arabidopsis microarray database (CITATION). According to the detailed information about tissue-specific expression of the organelle-type AtNUDXs from the database, it is notable that AtNUDX12, -13, -15, -16, -21, and -22 are highly expressed in pollen and/or stamen, suggesting an involvement of the proteins in the male reproductive organs. [[FIGURE]] To assess the physiological relevance of the individual organelle-type AtNUDXs, we studied effects of the disruption of organelle-type AtNUDXs on the growth and morphology of Arabidopsis mutants. T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis mutants of AtNUDX13 (SALK_058284), -14 (SALK_087382), -15 (SAIL_1255_G04), -19 (SALK_115339 and SALK_135053), -20 (SALK_138802), -21 (SALK_055509), -23 (SAIL_539_H02), -25 (SALK_016093), -26 (SALK_040636), and -27 (SALK_139887) have been registered in the SIGnAL project (http://signal.salk.edu/tabout.html). A complete loss of mRNA expression caused by homozygous T-DNA insertion into the respective AtNUDXs, except for AtNUDX19 and -23, in each mutant was verified by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). In both T-DNA mutants of AtNUDX19 (SALK_115339 and SALK_135053), the T-DNA insertion locating in the fourth intron resulted in significant suppression (<50%) of the AtNUDX19 expression, indicating an inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing by the insertion. No T-DNA insertion was detected in the genome of the T-DNA mutant of AtNUDX23 (SAIL_539_H02); therefore, the level of AtNUDX23 mRNA was not altered in the mutant. Under long-day conditions (16 h of light [100 μmol m−2 s−1], 25°C/8 h of dark, 22°C), no difference between the wild-type plants and the T-DNA mutants (AtNUDX13, -14, -15, -19, -20, -21, -25, -26, and -27) was observed in growth and morphology throughout the cultivation period (data not shown).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) plants were grown on basic Murashige and Skoog medium in petri dishes containing 3% (w/v) Suc for 2 weeks and then grown on soil at 25°C under long-day conditions (16 h of light at 100 μE m−2 s−1/8 h of dark). The Escherichia coli strain CC101 and the mutT-deficient strain CC101T were gifts from Prof. H. Maki (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). The plasmid pTrc100 for the complementary assay was obtained from Prof. Y. Nakabeppu (Kyushu University). The 8-oxo-(d)GTP was purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa. All other materials and enzymes were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative codes for predicted organelle-type Nudix hydrolases in Arabidopsis are shown in Supplemental Table S1. Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 4-week-old wild-type plants (1.0 g fresh weight). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using ReverTra Ace reverse transcriptase (Toyobo) with an oligo(dT) primer. cDNA fragments encoding each mature AtNUDX protein except for predicted mitochondrial or chloroplastic transit peptides at the N terminus (Supplemental Table S1) were amplified by PCR using the specific primer sets (Supplemental Table S3). The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into pT7 Blue T vectors (Novagen). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain terminator method with an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 310; Applied Biosystems). The resulting construct was digested with each restriction enzyme and was ligated into the expression vector pTrc100, in which each AtNUDX cDNA was oriented in-frame with the ATG initiation codon immediately upstream of its cloning site. The complementation assay was carried out according to the method described by CITATION. The empty pTrc100 or vectors containing each AtNUDX cDNA were introduced into E. coli strain CC101 (wild type) or CC101T (mutT−). A single transformant was grown in 5 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg mL−1 ampicillin at 37°C overnight. The culture solution was diluted 1 × 106-fold, and 100 μL of each culture was grown in 6 mL of LB medium containing 1 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside for 14 to 16 h. The frequency of mutations leading toward rifampicin resistance was measured by plating aliquots of these cultures on LB medium with or without the antibiotic (100 μg mL−1). cDNA fragments encoding each mature AtNUDX except for predicted mitochondrial or chloroplastic transit peptides at the N terminus (Supplemental Table S1) were amplified by PCR from the first-strand cDNA synthesized from total RNA of Arabidopsis using the specific primer sets as shown in Supplemental Table S3. The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into pT7 Blue T vector, digested with the desired restriction enzymes, and recloned into the vector pCold II (TaKaRa). Recombinant forms of each AtNUDX were produced using E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (CITATION) and purified from the extract using a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein content was determined following the method of CITATION. Almost all of the recombinant forms of predicted organelle-type AtNUDXs were produced in E. coli with high efficiency in the soluble fraction. However, the recombinant AtNUDX17, -21, -22, and -24 proteins were detected only in the insoluble fraction, because of the formation of inclusion bodies. Therefore, we recloned these cDNAs into the vector pCold TF, which expresses Trigger Factor chaperone as a soluble tag. As a result, these recombinant proteins were observed in the soluble fraction. All of the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity using a HiTrap chelating HP column, as judged with SDS-PAGE (Supplemental Fig. S1). The molecular mass of each recombinant AtNUDX protein agreed with the predicted value, which was calculated from the amino acid sequence of the mature protein plus the hexahistidine tag (Supplemental Table S1; Supplemental Fig. S1). Hydrolytic activities of the recombinant forms of mitochondrial or chloroplastic AtNUDXs toward various types of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives were assayed according to a method described previously (CITATION). Sixty microliters of the reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 to 1,000 μm substrate, and 0.2 to 1.0 μg of the purified recombinant protein, was incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μL of 100 mm EDTA. In addition, the reaction was carried out under reducing conditions by 1 mm DTT according to CITATION. The mixture was then analyzed with HPLC using a COSMOSIL C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Nacalai Tesque) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1 for the mobile phase buffer, which contained 73 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium dihydrogenphosphate, and 15% to 30% methanol. The substrate and reaction product(s) (as shown in parentheses) were detected according to their UV absorbance, as follows: 8-oxo-(d)GTP (2-oxo-dGMP), 293 nm; dGTP (dGMP), 252 nm; dCTP (dCMP), 271 nm; dTTP (dTMP), 264 nm; ADP-Rib (AMP), NADH (AMP), FAD (FMN), CoA (3′,5′-ADP), ApnA (ATP, ADP, or AMP), UDP-Glc (AMP), and UDP-Gal (UMP), 260 nm. The vectors for the generation of the GFP fusion proteins were constructed using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). The cDNAs encoding the open reading frame of AtNUDXs were cloned into the donor vector, pDONR201, and then recloned into the destination vector, pGWB5, in which the AtNUDX proteins fused with GFP at their C termini was expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The specific primers with attB1 and attB2 sequences were as follows: attB1-AtNUDX14-cGFP (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTATTGATGGCTGGCTTTAC-3′), attB2-AtNUDX14-cGFP (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTAAGAGTTGGGTTTCAGTC-3′), attB1-AtNUDX15-cGFP (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTCCGCAAATCGGATTCATG-3′), attB2-AtNUDX15-cGFP (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTAAGGCATACAAGTATGTT-3′), attB1-AtNUDX19-cGFP (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTTCCGGTGCGTATAATGC-3′), attB2-AtNUDX19-cGFP (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTACGGTTGCAGATGGTAAT-3′), attB1-AtNUDX23-cGFP (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTTCCGGTGCGTATAATGC-3′), attB2-AtNUDX23-cGFP (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTACGGTTGCAGATGGTAAT-3′), attB1-AtNUDX26-cGFP (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTATGGCACTGTACCGACCC-3′), attB2-AtNUDX26-cGFP (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTACTGGAGATGAGAAGCGA-3′), attB1-AtNUDX27-cGFP (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGCGCCATGGCCGTGAAGG-3′), attB2-AtNUDX27-cGFP (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTAATCCTTAGACGAGTTCA-3′). PCR and in vitro BP and LR recombination reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58), which was transformed with the constructs obtained by electroporation, was used for the transformation of tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum ‘Bright Yellow-2’) and Arabidopsis T87 cells using a modification of the procedure reported by CITATION. The mitochondria were stained with a mitochondria-selective dye, MitoTracker Orange (Invitrogen). The fluorescence was observed with a Radiance 2100 confocal fluorescence microscope (Bio-Rad). Images were processed using LaserSharp2000 software (Carl Zeiss). Total RNA was isolated from various tissues (0.5 g fresh weight), rosette leaves, stems, cauline leaves, inflorescences, and roots, of 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants as described previously (CITATION). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) with an oligo(dT) primer as described above. cDNAs encoding each AtNUDX and Actin2 were semiquantitatively amplified by PCR using the primer sets shown in Supplemental Table S1. Equal loading of each amplified gene sequence was determined with the control Actin2 PCR product. The Arabidopsis T-DNA mutants of AtNUDX13, -14, -15, -19, -20, -21, -23, -25, -26, and -27 (obtained through the SIGnAL project; http://signal.salk.edu/tabout.html) were selfed to check for segregation and to obtain a purely homozygous line. Genomic DNA extracted from the leaves of the mutants was used for identification of the T-DNA insertion site by genomic PCR analysis. The cDNA pool was prepared from total RNA extracted from the leaves of 2-week-old Arabidopsis plants. The cDNAs encoding AtNUDX and Actin2 were semiquantitatively amplified by PCR using specific primers in a reaction involving 23 to 27 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, followed by 72°C for 10 min. Aliquots of the products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Equal loading of each amplified gene sequence was determined with the control Actin2 PCR product. The specific primers for the AtNUDX and Actin2 mRNAs are shown in Supplemental Table S3. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under the following accession numbers: AtNUDX12, At1g12880; AtNUDX13, At3g26690; AtNUDX14, At4g11980; AtNUDX15, At1g28960; AtNUDX16, At3g12600; AtNUDX17, At2g01670; AtNUDX18, At1g14860; AtNUDX19, At5g20070; AtNUDX20, At5g19460; AtNUDX21, At1g73540; AtNUDX22, At2g33980; AtNUDX23, At2g42070; AtNUDX24, At5g19470; AtNUDX26, At3g10620; AtNUDX27, At5g06340.
