!~ABS~! Histone acetylation is modulated through the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, which play key roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Previously, we have identified a yeast histone deacetylase REDUCED POTASSIUM DEPENDENCY3 (RPD3) homolog, HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) (AtRPD3A), in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report further study of the expression and function of HDA19. Analysis of Arabidopsis plants containing the HDA19:β-glucuronidase fusion gene revealed that HDA19 was expressed throughout the life of the plant and in most plant organs examined. In addition, the expression of HDA19 was induced by wounding, the pathogen Alternaria brassicicola, and the plant hormones jasmonic acid and ethylene. Using green fluorescent protein fusion, we demonstrated that HDA19 accumulated in the nuclei of Arabidopsis cells. Overexpression of HDA19 in 35S:HDA19 plants decreased histone acetylation levels, whereas downregulation of HDA19 in HDA19-RNA interference (RNAi) plants increased histone acetylation levels. In comparison with wild-type plants, 35S:HDA19 transgenic plants had increased expression of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 and were more resistant to the pathogen A. brassicicola. The expression of jasmonic acid and ethylene regulated PATHOGENESIS-RELATED genes, Basic Chitinase and β-1,3-Glucanase, was upregulated in 35S:HDA19 plants but downregulated in HDA19-RNAi plants. Our studies provide evidence that HDA19 may regulate gene expression involved in jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling of pathogen response in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! A 1.4-kb HDA19 promoter fragment was used to construct a GUS reporter gene fusion (HDA19:GUS) for stable transformation of Arabidopsis. In 2-week-old transgenic seedlings, high levels of GUS expression were observed in all parts of the seedlings (Figure 1A). In adult plants, GUS expression was detected in the mature leaves, stems, flowers, siliques, and seeds (Figures 1B to 1H). In developing or mature flowers, the GUS activity was detected in all parts of the flowers, including the sepal, style, and stamens (Figures 1D to 1F). [[FIGURE]] As shown in the Figure 1, the GUS reporter gene under the control of the HDA19 promoter was strongly induced by JA and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC; an ethylene precursor). Furthermore, infections with the necrotrophic pathogen, A. brassicicola, induced GUS expression at the sites of infection by the pathogen (Figure 1M). In many of the tissues shown in Figure 1, GUS expression was induced by wounding of the tissues at the sites of excision. This was examined more carefully as shown in Figure 1N. GUS driven by the HDA19 promoter was shown to be wound inducible and limited to the cells at the actual wound site. We further analyzed the expression of HDA19 by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 2, HDA19 mRNA accumulated in the presence of JA and ACC. In addition to HDA19, three other homologs of yeast RPD3 (i.e., HDA6, HDA7, and HDA9) were also identified in the Arabidopsis genome (CITATION; Plant Chromatin Database, http://chromdb.org). We compared the expression of HDA19 with other RPD3-type HDAC genes in Arabidopsis. Like HDA19, the expression of HDA6 can also be induced by ethylene and JA (Figure 2). The expression of HDA9, however, cannot be induced. We could not detect the expression of HDA7 by RT-PCR. These data suggest that there is differential expression among RPD3-type HDAC genes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the expression of members of HDA1-type HDACs, HDA5, HDA8, and HDA14, as well as an HD2-type HDAC, HD2A, cannot be induced by ethylene and JA (Figure 2). [[FIGURE]] To investigate the cellular distribution of HDA19, we performed an in vivo targeting experiment using green fluorescent protein (GFP). HDA19-GFP gene fusion was created and introduced into Arabidopsis under the 35S promoter to achieve high levels of constitutive expression. To confirm that the fusion protein entered the nucleus, we monitored the fluorescence of GFP at the cellular level. Protoplasts were isolated from seedlings of transgenic Arabidopsis, and localization of the fusion protein was determined by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 3, the HDA19-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of the Arabidopsis cells. [[FIGURE]] Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were developed that overexpressed HDA19 from the constitutive 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus. PCR and DNA gel blot analysis were performed to determine the integration of transgenes into the genome in transgenic plants (data not shown). The three 35S:HDA19 transgenic lines, G11-1, G11-2, and G11-3, showed significantly increased levels of HDA19 mRNA accumulation compared with wild-type plants (Figure 4A). Overexpression of HDA19 cDNA in Arabidopsis resulted in an assortment of pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, including aberrant cotyledons, abnormal leaves, delayed flowering, and reduced fertility (Figure 5). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We further analyzed two HDA19-RNAi lines, RNAi-1 and RNAi-2, generated by expressing a transgene that encodes double-stranded HDA19 RNA (Plant Chromatin Database, http://chromdb.org). RNA gel blots revealed significantly reduced HDA19 mRNA levels in the HDA19-RNAi plants relative to nontransgenic control plants (Figure 4A). HDA19-RNAi plants were vigorous and displayed phenotypes similar to the HDA19 antisense plants and T-DNA insertion plants described previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The levels of tetra-acetylated H3 in wild-type, 35S:HDA19, and HDA19-RNAi plants were analyzed by protein gel blot analysis. As shown in Figure 4B, there were obviously decreased levels of tetra-acetylated H3 in three 35S:HDA19 transgenic lines compared with the wild type. By comparison, the levels of tetra-acetylated H3 in two HDA19-RNAi lines were increased, suggesting that HDA19 transcript level affects histone acetylation levels globally. Our protein gel blot analysis indicated that the anti-tetra-acetylated H3 antibody was specific to the histone H3 because we were able to detect only one protein band with molecular mass of ∼17 kD corresponding to H3. Changed levels of tetra-acetylated H3 in 35S:HDA19 and HDA19-RNAi plants indicated that HDA19 has HDAC activity. The finding that HDA19 can be induced by JA and ethylene prompted us to test whether changed HDA19 expression levels could affect JA and ethylene-regulated gene expression. It has been demonstrated that JA and ethylene coregulate the expression of a subset of PR genes, such as Basic Chitinase (CHI-B) and β-1,3-glucanase (BGL) (CITATION). RT-PCR analyses indicated that the expression of CHI-B and BGL was increased in the 35S:HDA19 plants (Figure 6A). By contrast, the expression of CHI-B and BGL was decreased in the HDA19-RNAi plants. These data indicate that there is a correlation between HDA19 expression and the expression of these PR genes. Recent studies indicate that the transcriptional factor ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (ERF1) acts downstream of the interaction between the ethylene and JA pathways and is a key element in the integration of both signals for the regulation of defense response genes (CITATION). RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of ERF1 was upregulated in the 35S:HDA19 plants (Figure 6A), suggesting that overexpression of HDA19 induced ERF1 expression. [[FIGURE]] We also analyzed the expression of the marker genes of the wound response, VSP2 (COI1 dependent) and RNS1 (COI1 independent) (CITATION). As shown in Figure 6B, no difference was found in the expression of VSP2 and RNS1 in the 35S:HDA19 and HDA19-RNAi plants compared with the wild type, suggesting that HDA19 does not affect the expression of these wound-inducible genes. It has been demonstrated that JA induces two groups of genes regulated by different mechanisms (CITATION). The first group, including PR genes, which are involved in defense responses against pathogens, is activated by ERF1; the second group, including VSP2, integrated by genes involved in JA-mediated systemic responses to wounding, is activated by another transcriptional factor, AtMYC2 (CITATION). Our analyses indicate that HDA19 can modulate the expression of the first group of genes involved in defense response but may not affect the second group of genes involved in wound response. We further compared the susceptibility of wild-type, 35S:HDA19, and HDA19-RNAi transgenic plants to the necrotrophic pathogen A. brassicicola. Four-week-old plants grown in soil were challenged with a suspension containing 5 × 105 spores mL−1 of A. brassicicola, and the progress of the infection was followed. Compared with wild-type plants, 35S:HDA19 plants showed a clear reduction in the symptoms of infection, whereas HDA19-RNAi plants displayed an increase in symptoms (Figure 7). These results demonstrate that HDA19 is required for resistance to A. brassicicola and that overexpression of HDA19 is sufficient to increase resistance to this necrotrophic fungus. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in a growth chamber (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness at 23°C) after a 2- to 4-d vernalization period. For growth under sterile conditions, seeds were surface sterilized (15-min incubation in 5% [v/v] sodium hypochlorite and a three-time rinse in sterile distilled water) and sown on half-strength MS salts (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 1% sucrose, pH 5.7, and 0.8% (w/v) agar in Petri dishes. To generate the HDA19:GUS construct, a 1.4-kb promoter for HDA19 was PCR amplified using the primer pairs 5′-GGTAAAGCTTAAGATGGAAGCATGTGC-3′ and 5′-GTATCCATTACCTCTGCACGCACGCCGATC-3′. The resulting PCR product was then digested by HindIII and NcoI and subcloned into the pCAMBIA1300 binary vector (Cambia, Canberra, Australia). To generate the 35S:HDA19 construct, the GUS gene in the pBI221 was replaced with the HDA19 coding region. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the fragment containing the 35S promoter and the HDA19 cDNA was then subcloned into the multicloning sites of pCAMBIA2300 binary vector. To generate the 35S:HDA19-GFP construct, HDA19 cDNA was PCR amplified and subcloned in frame in front of the GFP of the pCAMBIA1302 vector. DNA and protein sequence analysis was performed using BLAST searches (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and the Vector NTI Suite program (InforMax, Bethesda, MD). Plant transformation plasmids were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 as described (CITATION). The Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis was performed as described (CITATION). T1 seeds were harvested, dried at 25°C, and germinated on sterile medium containing 40 μg/mL of kanamycin or hygromycin to select the transformants. Surviving T1 plantlets were transferred to soil to set seeds (T2). For fluorometric GUS assays (CITATION), 50 μL of the crude extract from Arabidopsis tissues was incubated at 37°C with 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide in 0.3 mL of GUS assay buffer (50 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol). After 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h of incubation, 0.1-mL aliquots were removed and added to 1.9 mL of 0.2 M Na2CO3 to end the reaction. GUS activity was expressed as picomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone per milligram of protein per hour. For histochemical GUS assay, Arabidopsis tissues were incubated in a 0.5-mg/mL solution of 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated at 37°C overnight, followed by washing with 70% ethanol to remove the chlorophyll. Protoplasts were isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings as described (CITATION). The fluorescence photographs of protoplasts were taken using an Olympus florescent microscope (Tokyo, Japan) fitted with fluorescein isothiocyanate filters (excitation filter, 450 to 490 nm; emission filter, 520 nm; and dichroic mirror, 510 nm). Total genomic DNA from Arabidopsis was extracted using Plant DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For DNA gel blots, Arabidopsis genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes (CITATION). For RNA gel blots, total RNA was isolated from 100 to 200 mg of Arabidopsis leaf tissues using Trizol reagent as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA gel blots were prepared by electrophoresis of 10- to 20-μg samples of total RNA through agarose gels in the presence of formaldehyde, followed by transfer to nylon membranes. DNA gel blots and RNA gel blots were probed with 32P-labeled probes. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65°C in 0.5 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA (CITATION). Filters were washed once for 15 min in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature, then twice for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The damp filters were autoradiographed at −80°C using two intensifying screens. Filters were stripped in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% SDS at 100°C for 2 min when reprobing was required. One microgram of total RNA was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis after incubation at 65°C for 10 min. cDNA was synthesized in a volume of 20 μL that contained Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 mM DTT, 1.5 μM poly(dT) primer, 0.5 mM dNTPs, and 2 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 37°C for 1 h. All PCR reactions were performed with 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD), the buffer provided by the supplier, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and a pair of primers (0.1 μM each) in a final volume of 20 μL. PCR reaction parameters differed for each gene: thermocycling conditions were 94°C for 2 min followed by 25 to 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55 to 68°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min, with a final polymerization step at 72°C for 10 min. The gene-specific primer pairs used for the RT-PCR are as follows: HDA19, 5′-ACAAGATGCCGGAGCATGAA-3′ and 5′-TTTAGGAGGAAACGCCTGCT-3′; HDA6, 5′-TAGAGCCGGACAACAAACTC-3′ and 5′-TTCACGTCTGGCTCTGGGTT-3′; HDA7, 5′-GGTGATCCGTTTGGTACATT-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTCCATGTCCACTTCC-3′; HDA9, 5′-TTACAGGAGGTGGAGGATAC-3′ and 5′-CGTTATCGTTGTCTCCATCG-3′; ERF1, 5′-TTCTATCGGATCTTCTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CGGTGATCAAAGTCACTATC-3′; CHI-B, 5′-GAAGAGGACCAATGCAACTG-3′ and 5′-AGGCCGTTAACGAAGGATCT-3′; BGL, 5′-TGTTGGGAACAATTTGCCTTC-3′ and 5′-TCATGCCGATGTTACGGTTG-3′; VSP2, 5′-GTACTGGTTGTGGTTAGGGAC-3′ and 5′-GAAGGTACGTAGTAGAGTGG-3′; RNS1, 5′-ATGGTCTTTGGCCTAACTAC-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGATCTCAGCTCCAC-3′. For nuclear isolation, 500 mg of Arabidopsis seedling tissues were homogenized in 1 mL of Honda buffer (2.5% Ficoll 400, 5% dextran T40, 0.4 M sucrose, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethenol, 100 μg/mL of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/mL of antipain, and 0.5 μg/mL of leupeptin) and filtered through a 62-μm nylon mesh (CITATION). Then, 0.5% Triton X-100 was added to the extract, which was incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 1500g for 5 min. The pellet was washed with Honda buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, gently resuspended in 1 mL of Honda buffer, and centrifuged at 100g for 5 min to pellet starch and cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1800g for 5 min to pellet the nuclear. The nuclear extract was suspended in 200 μL of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 12.5% 2-mercaptoethanol). The protein samples were loaded on 15% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 3% dry milk for 60 min and then incubated with 0.01 to 0.05 μg/mL of antiacetyl-histone H3 (catalog no. 06-599; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the primary antibody was detected with secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) at room temperature for 45 min. Visualization was achieved using the ECL system (Amersham). Alternaria brassicicola was cultured on malt media at 22°C for 7 d. Mycelia were ground with a sterile plastic pestle in sterile water. The resulting suspension was transferred onto V8 media and incubated for 7 d with constant light. Spores were harvested by brushing the surface with a sterile paintbrush. Concentration of spores was determined and adjusted to 5 × 105 spores mL−1. Plants were inoculated by placing one droplet of 10 μL of suspension onto the surface of the sixth through eleventh true leaves. Inoculated plants were kept at 100% relative humidity at 24°C.
