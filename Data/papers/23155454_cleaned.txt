!~ABS~! The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a unique, network-like morphology. The ER structures are composed of tubules, cisternae, and three-way junctions. This morphology is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but the molecular mechanism that maintains ER morphology has not yet been elucidated. In addition, certain Brassicaceae plants develop a unique ER-derived organelle called the ER body. This organelle accumulates large amounts of PYK10, a β-glucosidase, but its physiological functions are still obscure. We aimed to identify a novel factor required for maintaining the morphology of the ER, including ER bodies, and employed a forward-genetic approach using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (GFP-h) with fluorescently-labeled ER. We isolated and investigated a mutant (designated endoplasmic reticulum morphology3, ermo3) with huge aggregates and abnormal punctate structures of ER. ERMO3 encodes a GDSL-lipase/esterase family protein, also known as MVP1. Here, we showed that, although ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was expressed ubiquitously, the morphological defects of ermo3 were specifically seen in a certain type of cells where ER bodies developed. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis combined with mass spectrometry revealed that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 interacts with the PYK10 complex, a huge protein complex that is thought to be important for ER body-related defense systems. We also found that the depletion of transcription factor NAI1, a master regulator for ER body formation, suppressed the formation of ER-aggregates in ermo3 cells, suggesting that NAI1 expression plays an important role in the abnormal aggregation of ER. Our results suggest that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 is required for preventing ER and other organelles from abnormal aggregation and for maintaining proper ER morphology in a coordinated manner with NAI1.
!~RES~! We isolated a recessive mutant that had defective ER morphology from chemically mutagenized GFP-h and designated it the endoplasmic reticulum morphology3-1 (ermo3-1) mutant. This mutant developed a huge aggregate of ER and a number of punctate structures on the peripheral meshwork of cotyledon cells ([pone-0049103-g001]). This aggregation of ER was also seen in petioles, hypocotyls, roots, and root hairs ([pone-0049103-g001]). Electron microscopy revealed that the ER-aggregate in an ermo3-1 cell comprised a huge aggregate of cytoplasm. In wild type cells, most organelles are distributed in a thin layer between plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane ([pone-0049103-g001]). Mitochondria and peroxisomes were recognized as circular structures and plastids were found as large compartments with internal membranes and starch granules. Vacuoles were pushing cytoplasm towards plasma membrane and vacuolar lumens showed relatively less electron density. ER bodies, as described previously, were gray-colored and surrounded by ribosomes (arrowheads in an inset). In the enlarged view (bottom panel), ER and Golgi bodies were closely contacting each other. ER had a number of ribosomes on its cytosolic surface (arrowheads). In ermo3-1 cells, on the other hand, these organelles were engulfed into the aggregate of cytoplasm ([pone-0049103-g001]). It contained various organelles such as vacuoles, ER bodies, Golgi bodies, mitochondria, peroxisomes, nuclei, and plastids (left column). This result was consistent with results obtained by confocal microscopic analysis ([pone.0049103.s001]). In addition to the clearly identifiable organelles, the cytoplasm was also filled with abnormal structures. Enlarged views of these structures are shown in the right column of [pone-0049103-g001]. These abnormal structures had ca. 100 nm–200 nm thickness, which was thicker than typical ER cisternae (less than 100 nm). We found them surrounded by ribosomes (indicated by arrowheads) and occasionally connected to typical ER cisternae (insets), indicating that these abnormal structures were derived from ER. These results show that the isolated ermo3-1 mutant had morphological defects in the ER and aberrant intracellular distribution of not only ER but also most organelles. (A) Transgenic Arabidopsis (GFP-h) expressing SP-GFP-HDEL was observed under a confocal microscope (left panels, WT). ermo3-1 was isolated from chemically mutagenized GFP-h seeds and subjected to confocal microscopy (right panels). In GFP-h cells, the typical ER network (peripheral, inset) and ER bodies (medial, arrows) were seen. In ermo3-1 cells, punctate structures (peripheral, arrowheads in inset) and huge aggregates (medial, open arrows) were seen in addition to the typical network and ER bodies. Bars, 10 µm. (B) Epidermal cells of petioles, hypocotyls, roots, and root hairs from 7-day-old ermo3-1 developed ER-aggregates, as seen in cotyledons. Bars, 10 µm. (C) Transmission electron micrographs of GFP-h (a) and ermo3-1 (b) cells. ER was usually seen as a thin structure in the periphery surrounded by ribosomes (arrowheads). ER bodies were recognized as large and relatively electron-dense compartments (inset). The ermo3-1 aggregates appeared as huge structures consisting of various structures. Abnormal swollen structures were occasionally surrounded by ribosomes (arrowheads) and connected with ER cisternae (insets). Eb, ER body; V, vacuole; G, Golgi body; N, nucleus; Mt, mitochondrion; Per, peroxisome; Cw, cell wall; Pt, plastid. Bars, 1 µm (upper panel of [a] and left column of [b]) and 200 nm (lower panel of [a] and right column of [b]). To determine whether ermo3-1 had defects in the organization of actin filaments, we expressed tdTomato-ABD2, a fluorescent actin marker protein, in ermo3-1 and GFP-h plants ([pone-0049103-g002]). In GFP-h, typical actin networks, which are composed of a number of thin filaments and several thick bundles, were seen ([pone-0049103-g002], GFP-h). Similarly, ermo3-1 also developed typical actin networks, and the ER strands were aligned on thick actin bundles. The aggregate in ermo3-1 cells was caged and penetrated with actin filaments ([pone-0049103-g002], ermo3-1). Disruption of these “actin cages” by an actin polymerization inhibitor (latrunculin B, Lat B) did not suppress the formation of aggregates ([pone-0049103-g002], open arrows). This inhibitor treatment induced the collapse of the ER meshwork, and the formation of abnormal ER structures as was also seen in GFP-h ([pone-0049103-g002], arrowheads), but the inhibitor not affect the nature of ER-aggregates in ermo3-1 cells. Our findings are summarized as follows: 1) the actin network was properly organized in ermo3-1 cells, 2) ER interacted with actin filaments in ermo3-1 cells and in wild-type cells in a similar manner, and 3) the formation of ER-aggregates in ermo3-1 cells was independent of actin cages. These findings suggest that ermo3-1 had defects at either downstream of the actin-ER interaction or in another molecular mechanism independent of actin filaments. (A) Confocal images obtained from T1 plants of ermo3-1 transformed by tdTomato-ABD2. Panels in the middle row are enlarged views of top panels. The aggregates were surrounded by organized actin filaments. Bottom row images show that the peripheral actin network was properly organized. Bars, 10 µm. (B) Seedlings of GFP-h and ermo3-1 were treated with 100 µM of Latrunculin B (Lat B), an actin inhibitor, for 2 hours. Green arrowheads indicate Lat B-induced aggregates, which were derived from collapsed ER networks. In the presence of Lat B, ermo3 aggregates (open arrows) were still similar to those of non-treated cells. Bars, 10 µm. We examined the ermo3-1 genome and were able to identify a single base pair substitution at the At1g54030 locus ([pone-0049103-g003]). In the ermo3-1 genome, an adenine-guanine sequence at the splicing junction between the second intron and the third exon was substituted with an adenine-adenine sequence. This substitution caused a splicing defect in expression of this locus, as revealed by RT-PCR ([pone-0049103-g003]). The two most prominently transcribed mRNAs in ermo3-1 seedlings were sequenced ([pone-0049103-g003]). The shorter mRNA (ermo3-1 #1) was spliced using another adenine-guanine sequence (indicated by red characters in the wild-type nucleotide sequence), resulting in a 24 base-pair deletion. The protein translated from this mRNA has an eight-amino-acid deletion (indicated by blue characters in the wild-type protein sequence). On the other hand, the second intron was not spliced out in the longer mRNA (ermo3-1 #2), resulting in the translation of a 13 amino acid insertion followed by a stop codon (indicated by red characters in the ermo3-1 #2 protein sequence). We then isolated two T-DNA inserted lines (SALK_030621, also known as mvp1-2, and SALK_135215), and the expression levels of this locus were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; [pone-0049103-g003]). The results showed that mvp1-2 expressed little mRNA (3.0% of Col-0, with P-value of 0.000013), and SALK_135215 was an additional knock-out allele of this locus. Loss of mRNA expression in ermo3-2 was also seen both in roots and aerial tissues ([pone-0049103-g003]). We stably introduced the SP-GFP-HDEL protein into SALK_135215 and found that this line also contained ER-aggregates and ER-derived punctate structures, both of which were similar to those in ermo3-1 cells ([pone.0049103.s002]). We crossed ermo3-1 with mvp1-2, and the resulting F1 individuals also contained ER-aggregates and the punctate structures ([pone.0049103.s002]). Together, these results indicate that ERMO3 is located on At1g54030 and that the morphological defects observed in ermo3-1 was not specifically due to splicing defects of this locus. (A) Gene model and protein structure of At1g54030. Base-pair substitution found in ermo3-1 and T-DNA insertion sites of ermo3-2 (SALK_135215) and mvp1-2 (SALK_030621) are shown. Blue boxes and black lines indicate exons and introns, respectively. Conserved domains for catalytic triad and oxyanion holes are indicated by orange boxes. Φ indicates a putative glycosylation site.

(C) Sequencing results of mRNA transcribed in GFP-h and ermo3-1 around the substitution site. Predicted protein sequences are also shown. Numbers above sequences indicate positions in CDS. #1 and #2 of ermo3-1 correspond to shorter and longer mRNAs shown in (B), respectively. (D) Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using total RNA from 7-day-old seedlings of CS60000, ermo3-2, and mvp1-2. The amplified region is indicated by a red bar in (A). ERMO3 expression in ermo3-2 was not detected and little in mvp1-2 (*** P<0.0001). (E) Total RNA from seedlings (7-day-old), roots (2-week-old), and aerial tissues (2-week-old) of GFP-h and ermo3-2 were subjected to qPCR. ERMO3 expression was detected in all three tissues of Col-0, while none was detected in ermo3-2. * P<0.01, ** P<0.001, *** P<0.0001. ERMO3 is the same gene as the recently reported MODIFIED VACUOLE PHENOTYPE1 (MVP1[pone.0049103-Agee1]) and GOLD36 [pone.0049103-Marti1], which encode a GDSL-lipase/esterase family protein. The mvp1 and gold36 mutants were identified by the aberrant morphology of vacuolar membrane (GFP-deltaTIP) and Golgi bodies (ST-GFP), respectively, which is consistent with our observation that various organelles including vacuoles and Golgi bodies were engulfed in the ER-aggregates in ermo3. The molecular mechanism by which these aggregates were formed remained unsolved in the report by Agee et al [pone.0049103-Agee1]. Marti et al. concluded that the export of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 out of the ER was required for the maintenance of organelle organization [pone.0049103-Marti1]. To understand the molecular mechanism involved in maintaining ER morphology, we focused on the subcellular localization of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36. At first, this localization remained unclear. Marti et al. concluded that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was localized in the vacuole [pone.0049103-Marti1], while Agee et al. initially reported that this protein was localized at the ER, ER bodies, and tonoplast [pone.0049103-Agee1]. The results of Marti et al. were based on experiments using GOLD36-mRFP transgenic plants, while Agee et al. based their results on MVP1-GFP transient expression assay data. We used another fluorescent protein, tagRFP, in combination with our knock-out allele, ermo3-2, under the 35S constitutive-expression promoter ([pone.0049103.s003]). ERMO3-tagRFP labeled the vacuolar lumen and the ER, but not aggregates, indicating that this protein functioned well enough to suppress the formation of ER-aggregates. To reveal if labeling of the ER was an artificial effect of overexpression, we treated ERMO3-tagRFP expressing plants with a ribosome inhibitor (cycloheximide, CHX). After treatment for 2 hours, entire signals disappeared from the ER while the vacuolar lumen still fluoresced ([pone.0049103.s003], right panel). This suggests that ERMO3-tagRFP was translated in the ER and transported to the vacuolar lumen, further supporting the conclusion of Marti et al. ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 is a member of the GDSL-lipase/esterase family and appears to be a pseudoenzyme [pone.0049103-Agee1]. We generated a cDNA encoding ERMO3G59S with an artificially introduced catalytic-center residue ([pone.0049103.s003]). This protein was C-terminally fused with tagRFP and introduced into the ermo3-1 mutant under control of the 35S promoter ([pone.0049103.s003]). Confocal microscopy revealed that this fused protein was transported to the vacuole and complemented the ermo3-1 mutant, suggesting that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 can maintain ER morphology regardless of whether it has enzymatic activity. We concluded that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was transported to the vacuole, but the morphological defects exhibited by this mutant occurred in the ER (see [pone-0049103-g001]). Thus, we then examined the importance of vacuolar transport of ERMO3-tagRFP in the maintenance of ER morphology. To do this, we generated an ERMO3-Venus-HDEL construct. A protein that bears the HDEL sequence at the C-terminus will exit the ER, go to the Golgi bodies, and immediately return to the ER [pone.0049103-Lewis1], [pone.0049103-Napier1], resulting in predominant localization at the ER. We introduced this construct into either ermo3-2 or Col-0 and observed the ER morphology through the fluorescence of ERMO3-Venus-HDEL ([pone-0049103-g004]). Unexpectedly, the ER morphology in the transformants was not defective, and no aggregated ER nor ER-derived punctate structures were found, indicating that ERMO3-Venus-HDEL was functional enough to maintain ER morphology. This suggests that, although native ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 seemed to be transported to the vacuole, its role in maintaining ER morphology was exerted between the ER and Golgi bodies. However, since ER-retention by HDEL is not completely robust, we could not exclude the possibility that a part of ERMO3-Venus-HDEL was transported to vacuole via Golgi bodies and this amount of transport was still enough for ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 to maintain ER morphology (discussed below). ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 protein fused with Venus followed by the ER-retention signal sequence (His-Asp-Glu-Leu) in its C-terminus was stably expressed in Col-0 and in ermo3-2. In both lines, ERMO3-Venus-HDEL localized in the ER lumen and ER bodies. Notably, neither of these developed abnormal aggregates that were seen in ermo3 cells. To reveal the molecular function of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36, we next focused on its interaction partners. We employed coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis using a transgenic Arabidopsis line (designated ERMO3-HA) that stably expressed hemagglutinin- (HA-) tagged ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36. We confirmed the expression of the tagged proteins in seedlings, which we primarily used to observe ER morphology. Furthermore, to obtain comprehensive insights into the interactome of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36, we performed mass spectrometric (MS) analysis after the Co-IP analysis. When the cells were stained with FM4-64 for 3 hours, ERMO3-HA cells, like the non-transgenic control (NT, identical to Col-0), did not contain obvious aggregates, while ermo3-2 cells had fluorescent aggregates, confirming that the ERMO3-HA protein was functional ([pone-0049103-g005]). Immunoblot analyses using either the anti-HA or anti-BiP (ER-resident protein as a control) antibody, followed by CBB staining, confirmed that ERMO3-HA was efficiently concentrated in the bound fraction ([pone-0049103-g005]). (A) Seven-day-old seedlings of NT (non-transgenic, identical to Col-0), ermo3-2, and ERMO3-HA were stained with 25 µM FM4-64 for 3 hours. ERMO3-HA did not develop any aggregates, unlike ermo3-2 (open arrows). (B) to (D) Seven-day-old seedlings of NT and ERMO3-HA were subjected to a co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay using anti-HA antibodies. Total (T), unbound (U), and bound (B) fractions ([B] and [D]), or only the bound fraction (C) from NT and ERMO3-HA, were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by either immunoblot analysis (IB; top and middle panels in [B], and [D]), silver staining (C), or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining (bottom panel in [B]). Numbers shown in (B) and (D) indicate relative amounts of loaded fractions. Interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry are indicated in (C). GLLs, GDSL lipase-like proteins; JALs, jacalin-related lectins; MATHs, meprin and TRAF homology [MATH] domain-containing proteins. The bound fractions collected from each of the NT and ERMO3-HA were then separated by SDS-PAGE and silver stained ([pone-0049103-g005]). We found several proteins that were specifically located in the ERMO3-HA precipitate (indicated by asterisks). To comprehensively identify ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36-binding proteins, whole proteins were subjected to MS analysis. The identified proteins are listed in [pone.0049103.s005]. Seed-storage proteins contaminated the homogenate and were misidentified as ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36-binding proteins (shown in oblique letters), since we used young seedlings that occasionally still contained seed coats. In addition to the comprehensive assay, several major proteins seen in the ERMO3-HA precipitate were excised from the stained gel and individually subjected to MS analysis. Excised bands and the identified protein names are indicated in [pone-0049103-g005] and in [pone.0049103.s005] (bold oblique letters). Interestingly, most of the proteins identified with relatively high MASCOT scores were reported to be components of the PYK10 complex [pone.0049103-Nagano1]. Identified proteins that are known to comprise the PYK10 complex, along with their homologues, are listed in [pone-0049103-t001]. Among these proteins, interactions with either PYK10 or PBP1 were confirmed by immunoblot analysis ([pone-0049103-g005]). PYK10 is the primary component of ER bodies, as described above, and the formation of the PYK10 complex may play an important role in the ER body system. This led us to speculate that there is a relationship between ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 and ER bodies. Proteins with expression levels that are thought to be regulated by NAI1 are indicated by bold characters. The localizations of these proteins have been experimentally confirmed or suggested [pone.0049103-Agee1], [pone.0049103-Marti1], [pone.0049103-Matsushima3], [pone.0049103-Nagano2]. Correlation coefficients of expression patterns with NAI1 (ATTED-II, http://atted.jp/). Because ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was expressed ubiquitously (ATTED-II, http://atted.jp/; [pone.0049103-Agee1]; see [pone-0049103-g003]), we expected that ER-aggregates would be evident in whole tissues of ermo3 plants. Indeed, in 7-day-old seedlings, epidermal cells of petioles, hypocotyls, roots, and root hairs had ER-aggregates that were similar to those in cotyledonary cells (see [pone-0049103-g001]). In contrast, surprisingly, most of the cells in rosette leaves from 2-week-old plants did not show any defects in ER morphology ([pone-0049103-g006], right column). Importantly, several cells from young rosette leaves still contained ER-aggregates ([pone-0049103-g006], open arrows). We found that these cells contained ER bodies as well ([pone-0049103-g006], arrows), while the other cells did not ([pone-0049103-g006]). Observing peripheral punctate structures of ER body-developing cells, we noticed that some cells developed punctate structures and some did not ([pone-0049103-g006], right column). Furthermore, although the number was quite less, there were the cells with ER bodies but without ER-aggregates. To see the nature of punctate structures, we observed aged cotyledonary cells of 2-week-old plants and found that they had lost punctate structures from their ER network although they still develop the ER-aggregates ([pone-0049103-g006]). These results suggest that the punctate structures were gradually suppressed during cell growth and the ER-aggregates were then also suppressed during further cell development ([pone-0049103-g006]). Regardless of developmental stages of cells, our observation of rosette leaves at least indicates that the morphological defects in ermo3 occurred where ER bodies were present. (A) and (B) Z-projected images (A) or confocal micrographs (B) of rosette leaves from 2-week-old GFP-h and ermo3-2 plants. Enlarged views of boxed regions are shown in bottom panels (a) to (d). Arrows, open arrows, and arrowheads indicate ER bodies, ER-aggregate in ermo3, and aberrant punctate structures in ermo3, respectively. Bars, 50 µm (A) and 10 µm (B). (C) Z-projection (upper row; bars, 50 µm) or peripheral section (bottom row; bars, 10 µm) of cotyledon epidermal cells from 2-week-old GFP-h and ermo3-2 plants. (D) Summarized phenotypes of ermo3 cells during cell development. ER body formation is regulated by a transcription factor named NAI1 [pone.0049103-Matsushima2] and, in other words, the cells that develop ER bodies are the cells where NAI1 expresses. Presence of NAI1 promotes expression of various proteins including PYK10, NAI2, and other ER body-related proteins. ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 is also one of the proteins that previously reported as NAI1-regulated proteins [pone.0049103-Nagano1]. We tried to confirm this by qPCR ([pone.0049103.s004]). In all tissues investigated of nai1-1 mutant, ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 expression was partially reduced. The significant amount of remained expression indicates that regulation of its expression by NAI1 is limited, suggesting that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 is expressed both in the cells with and without ER bodies. It further suggests that the cells with ER bodies required ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 for the proper organization of ER, while the cells without ER bodies were able to maintain ER morphology in the absence of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 proteins. Since the biggest difference in molecular basis between these two types of cells was expression of NAI1, we then tried to examine the involvement of NAI1 in the aggregation of ER in ermo3 cells. We performed two experiments: 1) the induction of ER body formation in ermo3 rosette leaves by MeJA treatment, and 2) the depletion of NAI1 from ermo3 cells. As mentioned above, NAI1 expression and ER body formation can be induced by MeJA treatment in rosette leaves, where ER bodies are absent under normal conditions. Rosette leaves from 3-week-old plants were collected and incubated in MeJA-containing water ([pone-0049103-g007]). After 2–4 days of incubation, ER bodies were clearly induced in GFP-h rosette leaves ([pone-0049103-g007], GFP-h, indicated by arrows). ER bodies were also induced in 4-day-incubated ermo3-1 rosette leaves and, notably, large aggregates of ER were co-induced ([pone-0049103-g007], ermo3-1, indicated by open arrows), suggesting that there is a correlation between the formation of inducible ER bodies and ER-aggregates. In these cells, we often found tangled ER structures, which may act as “seeds” for ER-aggregation ([pone-0049103-g007], arrowheads). Since ER bodies that are on the way of formation are very small in size, we could not distinguish them from the ER-derived punctate structures. (A) Rosette leaves from 3-week-old plants were treated with 45 µM of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), or water as a solvent control, for the indicated number of days. 3D-reconstructed images are shown. MeJA treatment induced ER bodies in both GFP-h and ermo3-1 cells (arrows). Notably, MeJA treatment co-induced ER-aggregate formation in ermo3-1 cells (open arrows). (B) Higher magnification views of 4 day-treated ermo3-1 cells are shown. Arrowheads indicate tangled ER, which might act as a “seed” of the ER-aggregates. Bars, 50 µm. Because MeJA also activates the expression of various responsive genes as well as NAI1, we then tried to determine the precise role of NAI1 by depleting NAI1 from ermo3 cells ([pone-0049103-g008]). As previously reported, the nai1-1 cells developed neither ER bodies nor ER-aggregates ([pone-0049103-g008], nai1-1; [pone.0049103-Matsushima3]). To deplete NAI1 from ermo3 cells, we crossed ermo3-1 with nai1-1 and generated an ermo3-1 nai1-1 double mutant. In ermo3-1 nai1-1 cells, neither ER bodies nor obvious ER-aggregates were found, which was also the case with nai1-1 cells ([pone-0049103-g008], ermo3-1 nai1-1). This suppression was not observed when either NAI2 or PYK10 was depleted from ermo3-1 (Figures S4C and D); the expression of both of these proteins is positively regulated by NAI1 ([pone.0049103.s004]). Importantly, nai2-1 and ermo3-1 nai2-1 cells did not have ER bodies, while ermo3-1 nai2-1 obviously developed huge ER-aggregates identical to those seen in ermo3-1 single mutant cells. Depletion of NAI1 in ermo3-1 suppressed the formation of ER-aggregates. (A) Single optical sections of cotyledonary epidermal cells of indicated genotypes. Solid and open arrows indicate ER bodies and ER-aggregates, respectively. Bars, 10 µm. (B) 3D reconstructed images of cotyledon and hypocotyl. Bars, 100 µm. From our results, it was revealed that ER aggregation in ermo3 was correlated with NAI1 expression but not with the formation of ER bodies: If it correlated with ER body formation, depletion of NAI2 from ermo3 cells should have resulted in suppression of the morphological defects of ER. Our overall results clearly show that NAI1 expression in ermo3 cells led ER to be disorganized. Because NAI1 is a transcription factor, protein(s) expressed under the positive control of NAI1 might be crucial for ER disorganization in ermo3 cells. ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 may suppress this function in wild-type cells. Combined with our Co-IP results, these proteins are suggested to be PYK10 complex components. According to two previous reports [pone.0049103-Agee1], [pone.0049103-Marti1], ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 might be involved in protein trafficking, as ST-GFP, secRFP, and GFP-PIP2a were mislocalized to the ER from the Golgi body, apoplast, and plasma membrane, respectively. To reveal if ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was directly involved in protein transport, we fluorescently labeled Golgi bodies by crossing ermo3-2 with ST-GFP-expressing Col-0 ([pone-0049103-g009]). ST-GFP is a membrane protein localized to trans-Golgi cesiternae and known to be dispersed to ER membrane when ER-Golgi protein transport is inhibited [pone.0049103-Chen1], [pone.0049103-Marti1]. In the cotyledonary epidermal cells of Col-0, ST-GFP clearly labeled Golgi bodies. In ermo3-2 cells, as reported previously [pone.0049103-Marti1], ST-GFP labeled ER membranes as well as Golgi bodies, showing that ER-Golgi transport was inhibited in these cells ([pone-0049103-g009]). Next we observed 2-week-old rosette leaves of Col-0 and ermo3-2. In wild type cells, as in cotyledonary cells, ST-GFP labeled Golgi bodies ([pone-0049103-g009], ST-GFP). In ermo3-2 cells, ST-GFP clearly labeled ER network in the cell with aggregates (enlarged in inset), while it did not in the cell without aggregates ([pone-0049103-g009], ermo3-2, indicated by an asterisk). It indicates that the defects in ER-Golgi transport occurred only in the cells with the aggregates but not in the cells without aggregates. Combined with the suggestion that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 expressed both types of the cells, our results suggest that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was involved in endomembrane organization itself, and the defective protein transport was due to disorganized ER-Golgi interface. Cotyledons (A) and rosette leaves (B) from 10-day-old Col-0 and ermo3-2 plants expressing ST-GFP were observed under a confocal microscope. In wild type cells, ST-GFP clearly labeled Golgi bodies. In ermo3-2 cells, ST-GFP labeled ER network as well as Golgi bodies (insets). This labeling was detected in the cells with aggregates (an open arrow) but not in the cells without obvious aberrant structures (an asterisk). Bars, 10 µm.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia-0 and Landsberg erecta) was used as the wild type. Transgenic Arabidopsis GFP-h was generated as previously described [pone.0049103-Hayashi1]. Mutant lines ermo3-2 (SALK_135215) and mvp1-2 (SALK_030621) were provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) at Ohio State University. Surface-sterilized seeds were sown onto MS medium containing either 0.5% Gellan Gum (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or 1% agarose supplemented with myo-inositol and 1% sucrose. Plants were grown at 22°C under continuous light. Isolation of ermo3-1 and map-based cloning of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 were performed as previously described [pone.0049103-Nakano1]. CDSs encoding ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 were amplified from a GFP-h cDNA library using gene-specific primers. Amplified products were subcloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector using a Gateway TOPO Cloning kit (Invitrogen). The G59S mutation was introduced into ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 in pENTR/D-TOPO using site-directed mutagenesis. The subcloned DNA constructs were introduced into plant expression vectors (pGWB560 or pGWB514, donated from Dr. Nakagawa of Shimane University) for fusing with tagRFP or HA, respectively. To generate ERMO3-Venus-HDEL, we first cloned SP-Venus-HDEL into pENTR/D-TOPO. SP-Venus-STOMAGEN [pone.0049103-Sugano1] was used as the template. HDEL was added by primer sequences. A Gly-Gly-Ala linker sequence containing NcoI sites was added to the 5′-end of ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 CDS and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO. NotI and NcoI were used to combine ERMO3-GGA and Venus-HDEL. The resulting ERMO3-Venus-HDEL in pENTR/D-TOPO was introduced into pB2GW7. Primer sequences used in this study are shown in [pone.0049103.s006]. Each plant expression vector was introduced into Arabidopsis plants as previously described [pone.0049103-Nakano1], [pone.0049103-Clough1]. Transformants were selected on plant growth media described above that contained the appropriate antibiotics. Protein expression of fluorescently-tagged constructs was confirmed under a fluorescence microscope. To confirm ERMO3-HA expression in seedlings, crude extracts from 7-day-old T2 plants (mixture of 20 individuals) of each transformant were subjected to immunoblot analysis, as described below. The fluorescent images were obtained with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM780 META; Carl Zeiss) with either a 100×1.45 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective or a 40×0.95 numerical aperture dry objective. Images were analyzed with ZEN2010 software (Carl Zeiss) and processed with ImageJ (NIH). Seven-day-old seedlings of GFP-h and ermo3-1 were fixed for 2 hours with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Procedures for electron microscopy were essentially the same as those described previously [pone.0049103-Shimada1]. The ultrathin sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (model JEM-1011; JEOL) at 100 kV. RNA was isolated and cDNA was synthesized as previously described [pone.0049103-Nakano1]. Primer sets used in conventional RT-PCR are presented in [pone.0049103.s006]. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with gene-specific primer sets (ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36, At02212063_g1; PYK10, At02290764_gH; NAI2, At02252556_g1; ACT2, At02335270_gH; Applied Biosystems, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/) and a TaqMan gene expression assay kit (Applied Biosystems) in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantity of the target cDNA was calculated using Actin2 as a control. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (http://www.r-project.org). Parametric one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis's test was performed after Bartlett's test. Pair-wise comparisons were performed by Tukey's test. The coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed using a μMACS Epitope Tag Protein Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Six-day-old seedlings (1 g) of non-transgenic Col-0 and ERMO3-HA were homogenized on ice in 4 mL of homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 1% [v/v] Triton X-100, and Complete proteinase inhibitors [Roche, http://www.roche.com]). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the resulting supernatants were collected as total fractions. Total fractions were incubated with 150 µL of magnetic beads conjugated to an anti-HA antibody (Milenyi Biotec) on ice for 30 min and then applied to μ columns (Miltenyi Biotec) in a magnetic field. The unbound flow-through fractions were also collected. After extensive washing with homogenization buffer, magnetic beads were eluted by, and boiled in, SDS sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 4% [v/v] SDS, 20% [v/v] glycerol, 5% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol) at 99°C for 5 min. Magnetic beads were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 5 min at room temperature, and the supernatants were collected as bound fractions. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as previously described [pone.0049103-Shimada1]. Antibodies used and dilution ratios were follows: anti-PYK10(IM) [pone.0049103-Matsushima3], 1∶10,000; anti-NAI2/deltaSP [pone.0049103-Yamada1], 1∶2,000; anti-PBP1-C [pone.0049103-Nagano2], 1∶10,000; anti-Thio, 1∶10,000; anti-HA(16B12) (Funakoshi, Japan), 1∶1,000; and anti-BiP [pone.0049103-Hatano1], 1∶10,000. Silver staining was performed using a PlusOne Silver Staining Kit, Protein (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Individual protein bands in silver-stained gel were excised following in-gel digestion. For comprehensive protein identification, bound fractions were separated on a 3 cm SDS gel. Gels were separated into three fractions and subjected to in-gel digestion. Identified proteins from each fraction were merged and shown as a single result. For in-gel digestion, each excised gel fraction was treated twice with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile for 10 min followed by 100% (v/v) acetonitrile for 15 min and then dried in a vacuum concentrator. The dried gel was treated with 0.01 mg/mL trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37°C for 16 hours. The digested peptides were recovered twice with 20 µL of 5% (v/v) formic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. The extracted peptides were combined and then evaporated to 10 µL in a vacuum concentrator. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses were performed using the LTQ-Orbitrap XL-HTC-PAL system. Trypsin digests were loaded onto the column (100 mm internal diameter, 15 cm length; L-Column, CERI) using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC pump (Michrom BioResources) and an HTC-PAL Autosampler (CTC Analytics) and were eluted by a gradient of 5 to 45% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid for 26 min. The eluted peptides were introduced directly into an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo) with a flow rate of 200 nL/min and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The range of the MS scan was m/z 450 to 1500. The top three peaks were subjected to MS/MS analysis. MS/MS spectra were analyzed by the Mascot server (version 2.3) in house [pone.0049103-Perkins1] (http://www.matrixscience.com/) and compared against proteins registered in TAIR8. The Mascot search parameters were set as follows: threshold of the ion score cutoff, 0.05; peptide tolerance, 10 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.8 Da; and peptide charge, 2+ or 3+. The search was also set to allow one missed cleavage by trypsin, a carboxymethylation modification of Cys residues, and a variable oxidation modification of Met residues.
