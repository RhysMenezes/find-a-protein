!~ABS~! Cytokinesis in plants is achieved by the formation of the cell plate. A pathway that includes mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase and MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) plays a key role in the control of plant cytokinesis. We show here that a MAP kinase, MPK4, is required for the formation of the cell plate in Arabidopsis thaliana. Single mutations in MPK4 caused dwarfism and characteristic defects in cytokinesis, such as immature cell plates, which became much more prominent upon introduction of a mutation in MKK6/ANQ, the MAPKK for cytokinesis, into mpk4. MKK6/ANQ strongly activated MPK4 in protoplasts, and kinase activity of MPK4 was detected in wild-type tissues that contained dividing cells but not in mkk6/anq mutants. Fluorescent protein–fused MPK4 localized to the expanding cell plates in cells of root tips. Expansion of the cell plates in mpk4 root tips appeared to be retarded. The level of MPK11 transcripts was markedly elevated in mpk4 plants, and defects in the mpk4 mpk11 double mutant with respect to growth and cytokinesis were more severe than in the corresponding single mutants. These results indicate that MPK4 is the downstream target of MKK6/ANQ in the regulation of cytokinesis in Arabidopsis and that MPK11 is also involved in cytokinesis.
!~RES~! The mpk4-2 allele on the Columbia-0 (Col-0) background (SALK_056245) corresponds to the MPK4 gene with a T-DNA insert in the sixth exon (Figure 1E). The plant with this allele has been reported to be a null mutant (CITATION). In our laboratory, the mpk4-2 mutant that was provided by the stock center was backcrossed with the wild-type plant (Col-0) three times, and progeny plants were used in these experiments. A wild-type phenotype was restored by a transgene that contained the MPK4 genomic region (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). As described below (Figure 1F; see Supplemental Figure 6 online), we failed to detect the MPK4 transcript and MPK4 protein in the mpk4-2 mutant, an observation consistent with the previously reported observation (CITATION). Homozygous mpk4-2 mutant plants exhibited severe aboveground dwarfism (Figures 1A and 1C), retarded root growth (Figure 1C), and the protrusion of many epidermal cells from roots (Figures 1G and 1I). The mpk4-2 homozygous mutant set only a few flowers, and these flowers produced very few viable seeds or none at all. The roots (Figures 1K and 1M) and cotyledons (Figures 1O, 1P, 1S, and 1T) of the mpk4-2 mutant contained enlarged cells with incomplete cell walls and multiple nuclei, as also observed previously in the mkk6-1/anq-1 MAPKK mutant (CITATION). These results suggested that formation of the cell plate was severely impaired in dividing cells of the mpk4-2 mutant. [[FIGURE]] In this study, the mpk4-1 mutation on the Landsberg erecta (Ler) background was the result of an insertion of a Ds transposon in the first intron of the MPK4 gene (Figure 1E; CITATION). Although mpk4-1 plants also exhibited aboveground dwarfism, consistent with a previous observation (CITATION), the roots were relatively normal (Figures 1B and 1H), and no obvious cytokinetic defects were detected in cotyledons and roots (Figures 1L, 1Q, and 1R). We examined the splicing of the Ds-containing intron sequence in mRNA from this mutant by RT-PCR using a pair of primers that extended from the first exon to the second exon. We detected a transcript of the normal wild-type size, but the level of the transcript was very much lower than in the wild type (Figure 1F). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the transcript revealed that the first intron plus Ds had been appropriately excised in mpk4-1 plants. Thus, this allele seems to correspond to a weak mutation. By contrast, no corresponding band was detected in the analysis of the RNA from mpk4-2 plants under the same conditions, suggesting that the mpk4-2 mutation has a stronger effect than mpk4-1, an observation consistent with the phenotypic difference noted above. Since the mpk4-2 allele was on the Col-0 background, we transferred the mpk4-1 allele from the Ler background to the Col-0 background by outcrossing, and then we examined the resultant phenotypes. Figure 1D shows that the mpk4-1 allele on the Col-0 background resulted in more severe dwarfism than the same allele on the Ler background. The protrusion of root epidermal cells was also evident in the mpk4-1 plants as well as in the mpk4-2 plants with the Col-0 background (Figures 1I and 1J), even though no such protrusions were observed in the case of mpk4-1 roots with the Ler background (Figure 1H). To date, protrusions of this type have always been associated with defects in cytokinesis in mutants such as mkk6-1/anq-1 and hinkel/nack1 (CITATION). Examination of cross sections revealed that roots (Figure 1N) and cotyledons (Figures 1U and 1V) of mpk4-1 (Col-0) plants contained unusually large cells with incomplete cell walls and multiple nuclei. By contrast, cells of mpk4-1 (Ler) did not exhibit such abnormalities. Phenotypic analysis of double mutants demonstrated that mpk4-2 anq-2 exhibited more severe dwarfism than either single mutant (Figures 2A to 2D), confirming a role for MPK4 in cytokinesis. To examine the genetic interaction between mpk4-2 and anq-2 in more detail, we generated mpk4-2/+ anq-2/+ double heterozygotes and determined the genotypes of 197 self-pollinated progeny by examining the presence or the absence of the T-DNA that caused each respective mutation. As shown in Supplemental Table 1 online, the segregation ratios of the genotypes of the progeny deviated from the expected Mendelian frequencies. Segregation efficiencies of the genotypes MPK4/+ anq-2/- (line 3), mpk4-2/+ anq-2/- (line 6), and mpk4-2/- anq-2/- (line 9) were markedly lower than the expected values (see expected 1). In particular, the reduction in frequency of mpk4-2/+ anq-2/- (line 6) and mpk4-2/- anq-2/- (line 9) was greater than the reduction in frequency of MPK4/+ anq-2/- plants (line 3). These results showed that both the mpk4-2 and the anq-2 mutations negatively affected some or all of the following: the formation of gametes in the parent, fertilization, and the viability of progeny plants. [[FIGURE]] To examine the viability of mpk4-2 anq-2 gametes, we performed reciprocal crosses between an mpk4-2/+ anq-2/+ double heterozygote and a wild-type parent (Table 1). When we used mutant pollen from the mpk4-2/+ anq-2/+ parent for crosses with a wild-type female parent, mutant alleles were transmitted to ~50% of the offspring, as expected (Table 1), indicating that male gametophytes were viable. However, when we used pollen from the wild-type parent for crosses with the mpk4-2/+ anq-2/+ female parent, the mutant alleles mpk4-2, anq-2, or mpk4-2 plus anq-2 were transmitted to the offspring at much lower than expected frequencies (Table 1). We found that 7% of female gametophytes and/or embryos that harbored mpk4-2, 66% of those that harbored anq-2, and 89% of those that harbored both mpk4-2 and anq-2 were not viable. The lower segregation efficiencies of mutants with the anq-2/-, mpk4-2/+ anq-2/-, and mpk4-2 anq-2 alleles that are shown in Supplemental Table 1 online can be predicted from the viabilities summarized in Table 1. Results of Reciprocal Crosses between the mpk4-2/+ anq-2/+ Mutant and Wild-Type Plants To investigate the possible involvement in cytokinesis of other MAPKs in group B, we analyzed the expression of the MPK4, MPK5, MPK11, MPK12, MPK13, and MKK6/ANQ genes in wild-type plants as well as the phenotypes of the single mutants mpk11 and mpk13 and the double mutants mpk4 mpk11 and mpk4 mpk13. We prepared poly(A)+ RNAs from shoot apices, mature leaves, and flower buds of wild-type plants and quantified the transcripts of the various MAPK genes by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 2F). Levels of MPK13 transcripts in shoot apices, flower buds, and mature leaves did not differ significantly. Transcripts of other MAPK genes, including MPK4, were detected in tissues that contained dividing cells, but their levels were higher in mature leaves than in tissues with dividing cells (Figure 2F). In this study, the mpk11 mutant (Col-0 background) was backcrossed with the wild type (Col-0), and the mpk13 mutant (Wassilewskija background) was outcrossed with the wild type (Col-0) three times or more. The progeny of these crosses were used for analyses. The predicted amino acid sequence of MPK4 exhibits the strongest amino acid sequence similarity to that of MPK11 among members of the group B subfamily (88.3%; Figure 2E). A T-DNA insertion mutation in the MPK11 gene resulted in plants with normal morphology, which were indistinguishable from wild-type plants (Figures 2G and 2H). The dwarfism of mpk4-2 mpk11 double mutant plants was, however, more severe than that of the mpk4-2 single mutant, and the petioles of the double mutant were much shorter than mpk4-2 petioles (Figures 2I and 2J). The double mutant was unable to develop inflorescences. To quantify cytokinetic defects in mpk11 and mpk4-2 mpk11 plants, we counted the cells with incomplete cell walls in cotyledons of these mutants (Table 2). Although the cytokinetic defects in mpk4-2 and mpk4-2 mpk11 cotyledons were relatively weak compared with those in other organs, such as roots (Figure 1S; see Supplemental Figure 2 online), we chose to use cotyledons for quantitative analysis because of the small sizes of cells. We prepared series of transverse sections, starting from the middle, of the cotyledons of 9-d-old plants. There were no cell wall–defective cells in sections of mpk11 cotyledons. However, the percentage of cells with incomplete cell walls in the mpk4-2 mpk11 double mutant (3.6% ± 0.76% on average, n = 6) was significantly higher than in the mpk4-2 single mutant (1.9% ± 0.56% on average, n = 6). The Frequency of Cells with an Incomplete Cell Plate in Cotyledons We also examined a T-DNA insertion mutant of the MPK13 gene and the mpk4-2 mpk13 double mutant for possible cytokinetic defects since the amino acid sequence of MPK13 also resembles that of tobacco NRK1/NTF6 more closely than do those of other MAPKs (Figure 2E). As shown in Supplemental Figure 3 online, there were no apparent abnormalities in the mpk13 single mutant, and there was no significant phenotypic difference between the mpk4-2 single mutant and the mpk4-2 mpk13 double mutant. Supplemental Table 2 online shows that, on average, 2.5% ± 0.62% (n = 6) and 2.1% ± 0.61% (n = 6) of cells in the mpk4-2 and mpk4-2 mpk13 mutants had incomplete cell walls, respectively. We measured levels of MPK11 transcripts in mpk4-2 plants by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with poly(A)+ RNAs that had been prepared from shoot apices and cotyledons. In shoot apices, the level of MPK11 transcripts was 40-fold higher in the mpk4-2 mutant than in the wild type (Figure 3A). Levels of MPK11 transcripts were also 12-fold higher in the mutant cotyledons (Figure 3B). Similar increases were also observed in mpk4-1 leaves (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). However, levels of MPK5, MPK12, and MPK13 transcripts in the shoot apices of mpk4-2 were similar to those of in the shoot apices of wild-type plants. Levels of MPK11 transcripts were very similar in the shoot apices of mkk6-2/anq-2 and nack1-3 mutants, which have defects in cytokinesis. Thus, marked increases in levels of MPK11 transcripts appeared to be specific to plants with the mutation in the MPK4 gene. [[FIGURE]] We tested MAPKs for potential activation by MKK6/ANQ MAPKK using protoplasts of cells from Arabidopsis plants (Figure 4). Five cDNAs for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged group B MAPKs (MPK4, MPK5, MPK11, MPK12, and MPK13) were coexpressed, separately, with cDNAs for kinase-inactive (L; amino acid substitution in the ATP binding site of subdomain II), wild-type (W), and constitutively active (G; amino acid substitutions by Asp residues) forms, respectively, of Myc-tagged MKK6/ANQ (MKK6/ANQ-Myc). After immunoprecipitation of each HA-tagged MAPK, we determined their activities in kinase assays in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP) as an artificial substrate. MPK4, MPK5, and MPK13 were activated by the constitutively active MKK6/ANQ (Figure 4, G lanes). Activation of MPK13 by MKK6 was consistent with a previous observation by CITATION. MPK11 was only weakly activated. We also examined members of group C (MPK1, MPK2, MPK7, and MPK14), group A (MPK3 and MPK6), and group D (MPK8, MPK15, MPK16, MPK17, MPK18, and MPK19) for activation in similar assays. MPK1 activity was slightly increased by coexpression of constitutively active MKK6/ANQ-Myc, but other MAPKs that we tested were not activated (Figure 4; see Supplemental Figure 5 online). [[FIGURE]] We raised polyclonal MPK4-specific antibodies in rabbits, which were immunized with a synthetic oligopeptide that corresponded to amino acid residues 361 to 367 of MPK4. The antibodies recognized a single protein of 40 kD, which corresponds to the estimated molecular mass of MPK4, in a protein extract prepared from wild-type plants (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). The signal that corresponded to this protein was not detected in extracts prepared from the mpk4-2 mutant, demonstrating that mpk4-2 mutant plants failed to produce detectable amounts of MPK4. We prepared protein extracts from wild-type and mpk4-2 whole plants, developing first and second leaves, mature cotyledons, shoot apices, roots without tips, and root tips. Then, we performed immunocomplex kinase assays with the MPK4-specific antibodies and MBP as the artificial substrate. As shown in Figure 5A, we detected very weak activities of MPK4 protein kinase in protein extracts from whole wild-type and mpk4-2 plants, respectively. The activity of MPK4 was clearly detected in extracts of developing leaves, shoot apices, and root tips (Figure 5A, lanes 3, 5, and 7), all of which contain actively dividing cells, but no clear activity was detected in extracts of mature cotyledons (lane 4) and roots without tips (lane 6) under the same conditions. These results suggested that MPK4 might be activated in tissues that contain dividing cells. [[FIGURE]] We examined whether a mutation in the MKK6/ANQ gene for a MAPKK that was involved in the activation of MPK4 (Figure 5B) might affect the activity of MPK4 in planta. We prepared protein extracts from developing first and second leaves plus shoot apices of wild-type plants, of mpk4-2 mutant plants, and of mkk6-2/anq-2 mutant plants and performed immunocomplex kinase assays with the MPK4-specific antibodies. Although kinase activity was clearly detected in the immunocomplex from the wild-type extract, lower levels of activity were detected in immunocomplexes from mpk4-2 and mkk6-2/anq-2 extracts (Figure 5B). These results were consistent with the observation that MPK4 was activated in the presence of MKK6/ANQ in vivo (Figure 5B) and in vitro (CITATION). We generated transgenic mpk4-2 plants that expressed a fusion of the entire MPK4 locus with the cDNA construct for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at the C terminus (MPK4-YFP). In the transgenic plants, the mpk4 dwarf phenotype was reversed, suggesting that MPK4-YFP was functional. Upon further examination of these plants, we observed signals due to YFP in the root cells in the division zone. Confocal microscopy revealed that signals due to MPK4-YFP in most of the cells were localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Figures 6A and 6B), consistent with previous observations (CITATION). In a significant proportion of the cells, however, signals due to YFP were concentrated in the region that corresponded to the cell division plane, both at early stages, when the nuclei had not yet reformed (indicated by arrows in Figures 6C and 6D), and later, when the two daughter nuclei had reformed (indicated by arrowheads in Figure 6E). [[FIGURE]] We stained root tips of the transgenic wild-type plant that expressed MPK4-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) with FM4-64 to label cell plates and observed signals due to GFP and FM4-64 in cells of the division zone. As shown in Figures 6F to 6H, MPK4-GFP was localized to the cell plate. Time-lapse analyses with FM4-64 demonstrated that the cell plate in wild-type root cells extended toward the parental cell walls in 15 min (Figure 6I), which is consistent with the recently reported observation (CITATION). By contrast, cell plates in mpk4-2 root cells slightly or barely expanded over 24 min (Figures 6J and 6K).
!~MM~! The mpk4-1 (CITATION) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was obtained from the ABRC at http://abrc.osu.edu. The mpk4-2 (SALK_056245), mkk6-2/anq-2 (SALK_117230), and mpk11 (SALK_049352) mutants were identified in a population of T-DNA–tagged Arabidopsis plants generated at the Salk Institute (CITATION). We screened 133,440 T-DNA–tagged plants, generated at the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility of the University of Wisconsin (CITATION), for mpk13 mutations by PCR according to the instructions on the facility’s website (http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis). We backcrossed all the mutant lines with the wild-type plant (Col-0) three or more times and used progeny plants for experiments. We outcrossed mpk13 with Col-0 three times and used the progeny for experiments. Primers used to determine genotypes are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Plants were grown as described previously (CITATION). We used 23-d-old seedlings (harvested 23 d after transfer of seeds from 4°C in darkness to 22°C in 16 h light/8 h dark) for RT-PCR, and we used mature leaves and flower buds from 36-d-old plants, as well as the shoot apex and cotyledons from 9-d-old plants, for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from wild-type, mpk4-1, mpk4-2, mkk6-2/anq-2, and nack1-3 plants with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA with Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized with Ready-to-Go You Prime First-Strand Beads (GE Healthcare). Amplification by RT-PCR was performed as described elsewhere (CITATION). Quantitative PCR was performed in the presence of the double-stranded DNA-specific dye SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). Amplification was monitored in real time with a real-time PCR system (model 7500; Applied Biosystems). The results were normalized by reference to results for EF1-α or β-tubulin. Details of the method were described by CITATION. Primers used for the experiments are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Plant materials were prepared for sectioning as described by CITATION and CITATION. The open reading frames of genes for MPKs and MKK6/ANQ were cloned into the plant expression vector pRT100 (CITATION; CITATION) such that gene products were fused at their C-terminal ends either to a triple HA epitope (MPKs) or to a double c-myc epitope (MKK6/ANQ). Primers used for cloning are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Transient protein expression assays in Arabidopsis protoplasts were performed as described previously (CITATION). Protein extracts were prepared either from protoplasts as described previously (CITATION) or from frozen Arabidopsis plants in TG150 buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium-o-vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/mL each of leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin A, and antipain). Proteins in extracts from protoplasts and plants were quantified with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with BSA as the standard. Antibodies against MPK4 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide ELIYRETVKFNPQDSV (residues 361 to 376 of MPK4), which was synthesized by MBL. Antibodies were affinity purified with the immobilized antigen, which was prepared using the SulfoLink immobilization kit for peptides (Thermo Scientific). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously by CITATION. For detection of MPK4, we used specific affinity-purified antibodies at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. For detection of HA- and Myc-fusion proteins, we used HA-specific (clone 12CA5) and Myc-specific (clone 9E10) monoclonal antibodies, as described previously (CITATION). Immunocomplex kinase assays, using proteins extracted from protoplasts, were performed as described by CITATION. Immunocomplex kinase assays using proteins extracted from plants were performed as described by CITATION. In brief, protein extracts (250 μg of protein) were diluted to 200 μL with TG150 buffer (see above) and incubated with 1 μg of MPK4-specific antibodies at 25°C for 2 h. Then, they were incubated with 20 μL of a 50% slurry of rProtein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) at 4°C for 1 h. The resin was washed three times with TG150 buffer and twice with kinase buffer, which contained 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mM sodium-o-vanadate. The resin was resuspended in a reaction cocktail (20 μL) that included 5 μg of MBP, 50 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare) in kinase buffer and incubated at 25°C for 30 min. After addition of 20 μL of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and radioactivity was visualized with an imaging analyzer (BAS-1800; Fujifilm). The MPK4 locus upstream (2693 bp) and downstream (258 bp) of the termination codon was amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA with specific primers (see Supplemental Table 3 online). The open reading frame for YFP was amplified with the primer set YFP_F/YFP_R from pEXCS-GW-mYFP-nls (kindly provided by Jane Parker; see Supplemental Table 3 online). All PCR fragments were generated using iProof (Bio-Rad), ligated by T/A cloning in pGEMTeasy (Promega), and sequenced. Using appropriate restriction enzymes (see Supplemental Table 3 online), we reassembled the MPK4 locus in pGREEN0229 to generate pGREEN0229-MPK4L. Next, the BamHI-BglII DNA fragment encoding YFP was cloned at the unique compatible BamHI locus to generate pGREEN0229-MPK4L-YFP. The MPK4 locus that covered from the region upstream (2966 bp) of the termination codon to the codon before the termination codon was amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA with the primer set KK93/KK138 (see Supplemental Table 3 online). The PCR fragments were cloned into the pGWB4 vector (CITATION). Wild-type plants (Col-0) were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens by the floral dip method (CITATION). Basta-resistant plants were genotyped for the MPK4 locus with the primer sets K4WT_S/K4WT_R for amplification of the wild-type allele-specific fragment and LB6316/K4WT_R for amplification of the mpk4-2 allele-specific fragment, respectively. Signals due to YFP were monitored with a confocal microscope (TCS SP2-AOBS; Leica). Plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (half-strength MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.5% MES, pH 5.4; Agar Type E) for 4 d. Signals due to GFP and FM4-64 were monitored with a confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). FM4-64 (Invitrogen) was solubilized in DMSO to a concentration of 2 mM and diluted 1:200 in water, and the diluted solution was added to roots of 5-d-old plants placed on a Gellan gum plate and incubated for 10 min prior to observation. Live-cell imaging was performed using 3- to 4-d-old seedlings. The seedlings were stained with 6.4 mM FM4-64 (Invitrogen) in MS buffer for 10 min and put onto the chambered cover slides (Lab-Tek II; Thermo Scientific). The chambered cover slides were placed on the inverted platform of a fluorescence microscope (IX-81; Olympus) equipped with a CSUX-1 confocal laser scanner unit (Yokogawa Electronic) and a CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ2; Roper Scientific). Images were acquired with a ×40 objective lens (UPLFLN40, numerical aperture 1.3, oil immersion) using diode-pumped solid-state 561-nm lasers (Melles Griot). The time-lapse images were processed with Metamorph version 7.5 (Molecular Devices).
