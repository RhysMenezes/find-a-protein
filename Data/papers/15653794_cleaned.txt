!~ABS~! Cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) proteins belong to a family of heavy metal efflux transporters that might play an essential role in homeostasis and tolerance to metal ions. We investigated the subcellular localization of Arabidopsis thaliana AtMTP1, a member of the CDF family, and its physiological role in the tolerance to Zn using MTP1-deficient mutant plants. AtMTP1 was immunochemically detected as a 43 kDa protein in the vacuolar membrane fractioned by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The expression level of AtMTP1 in suspension-cultured cells was not affected by the Zn concentration in the medium. When AtMTP1 fused with green fluorescent protein was transiently expressed in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, green fluorescence was clearly observed in the vacuolar membrane. A T-DNA insertion mutant line for AtMTP1 displays enhanced sensitivity to high Zn concentrations ranging from 200 to 500 µM, but not to Zn-deficient conditions. Mesophyll cells of the mtp1-1 mutant plants grown in the presence of 500 µM Zn were degraded, suggesting that Zn at high concentrations causes serious damage to leaves and that AtMTP1 plays a crucial role in preventing this damage in plants. Thus we propose that AtMTP1 is localized in the vacuolar membrane and is involved in sequestration of excess Zn in the cytoplasm into vacuoles to maintain Zn homeostasis.
!~RES~! To determine the subcellular localization of AtMTP1 protein, we prepared an anti-peptide antibody against the N-terminal hydrophilic region of AtMTP1. The peptide sequence is characteristic of AtMTP1 compared with three other AtMTPs (Fig. 1A). The membrane topology of AtMTP1 predicted by the hydropathy analysis is shown in Fig. 1B. AtMTP1 shares a common sequence Gly–Phe–Ser–Asp with AtMTP3. However, the antibody against this peptide may not react with AtMTP3, because antibodies strictly recognize amino acid sequences with more than six residues. Furthermore, there was no identical peptide sequence in the total proteins of A. thaliana in the TAIR Blast 2.0 database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/Blast/). As shown in Fig. 1C, a 43 kDa protein was detected in an immunoblot with the anti-AtMTP1 antibody. The protein band at 43 kDa was not detected when a corresponding antigen peptide was added to the reaction medium. Although background levels were apparently different between lanes 1, 3 and 4, the bands that appeared in lanes 1 and 3 did not appear in lanes 2 and 4 even when the background levels were much higher. A fusion protein of AtMTP1 with the V5 epitope and His6 tag, which was expressed in yeast, was also detected by both anti-AtMTP1 (lane 3) and anti-His6 antibodies (lane 5), but not in yeast with the control vector (lanes 4 and 6). The crude membrane fraction prepared from the homogenate of root cells of A. thaliana cultured in a Murashige Skoog (MS) solution was subjected to equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2). AtMTP1 protein was recovered in fractions 9–13 together with the vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit a (VHA-a). VHA-a is mainly localized to vacuolar membranes, although a part of VHA-a protein was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other endomembranes (Sze et al. 1999). Plasma membrane H+-ATPase (AHA3) was recovered in fractions 18–21. Bip, an ER lumen marker protein, was also detected in the same fractions as AtMTP1 under the Mg2+-free condition (Fig. 2A). In the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2B), peak fractions of Bip were moved to the high-density fractions 17–20, but the sedimentation of AtMTP1 was not altered. The activity of Triton-stimulated inosine diphosphatase (IDPase), a marker for the Golgi apparatus (Lord 1987), was detected in fractions 11–13, which partially overlapped that of AtMTP1. Thus, these results suggest that AtMTP1 is localized to the vacuolar membrane or Golgi apparatus in part, but not to plasma membrane or ER membrane. It should be noted that the 43 kDa band of AtMTP1 was clearly detected in the vacuolar membrane that was highly purified from A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells (Fig. 2C). We also found a faint band with a smaller molecular size of 41 kDa in fractions 19–21. This band was different from the 43 kDa protein band detected in the vacuolar membrane fractions and the crude membranes prepared from A. thaliana ‘Deep’ cells (Fig. 2C). The 41 kDa band was not detected clearly in the crude membrane fractions from tissue homogenate and ‘Deep’ cells. Thus, a faint band of 41 kDa may be a non-specific band. To determine the subcellular localization of AtMTP1, we prepared a DNA construct of a fusion protein of AtMTP1 with GFP (AtMTP1–GFP) and expressed it transiently in A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the green fluorescence from GFP was clearly detected on the vacuolar membrane, whereas fluorescence of free GFP was dispersed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that GFP–AtMTP1, which contained GFP at the N-terminal end of AtMTP1, did not produce a clear fluorescent image. The N-terminal region of AtMTP1 may be critical for correct folding, and an additional GFP polypeptide might cause proteolytic degradation of the fusion protein. To examine whether the AtMTP1 protein level is altered by the Zn concentration in the medium, we immunochemically quantified AtMTP1 in suspension-cultured cells under various Zn concentrations. We used two types of A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells, ‘Deep’ and T87, which were cells developed from roots (Umeda et al. 1998) and whole seedlings (Axelos et al. 1992) of A. thaliana Columbia, respectively. When cells were cultured for 4 d in JPL medium, which contained 11 µM Zn, the AtMTP1 protein level was higher in ‘Deep’ cells rather than T87 cells (Fig. 4). Both cells seem to retain the memory of their original tissues. For example, T87 cells, but not ‘Deep’ cells, synthesize chlorophyll in the plastid and are green under the light. Micro array expression analysis (Wintz et al. 2003; Arabidopsis membrane protein library, http://www.cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis/) and the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/java.html) reported that the AtMTP1 mRNA level in roots is twice of that in shoots and leaves of A. thaliana. Therefore, the abundance of AtMTP1 in ‘Deep’ cells may be a reflection of its original tissue. Although the content was extremely low, AtMTP1 was clearly detected in T87 cells. The AtMTP1 level varied with the medium. The AtMTP1 level in ‘Deep’ cells cultured in MS medium containing 30 µM Zn was three times greater than that of the cells in the JPL medium. Then we examined the effect of the Zn concentration in the culture medium on the AtMTP1 level. The level slightly increased with the concentration of Zn, but the change was similar to that of the V-ATPase subunit a (Fig. 4A and B, right panels). These results indicate that Zn in the medium even at 100 µM may not up-regulate the transcription or translation of AtMTP1 in suspension-cultured cells. We analyzed a T-DNA insertion mutant of A. thaliana. The insertion site of T-DNA was determined to be the 3′-terminal coding region of AtMTP1 by DNA sequencing (Fig. 5A). The mtp1-1 mutant lacked an AtMTP1 transcription product, although the wild-type plant gave a band of 587 bp (Fig. 5B). AtMTP1 protein was not detected in the crude membrane fraction prepared from the mutant plant (data not shown). The mtp1-1 mutants were morphologically normal when grown in vitro and in the greenhouse under standard conditions. The wild-type and mutant plants were grown on MS medium for 2 weeks after germination, then transferred to the hydroponic medium containing 400 µM Zn for 2 d. Fig. 6 shows that the mtp1-1 (–/–) homozygous mutant was highly sensitive to 400 µM Zn. However, the heterozygote mtp1-1 (+/–) grew normally under the same conditions. The tolerance of the mutant plants to high concentrations of Zn was recovered when mtp1-1 was transformed with the AtMTP1 gene under the control of the 35S promoter, confirming that AtMTP1 is involved in the tolerance of A. thaliana to Zn. The mtp1-1 mutant plants grew normally in the MS medium like the wild-type plants. The MS medium contained 30 µM Zn. No difference in growth was observed between the mtp1-1 mutant and wild-type seedlings when cultivated in the medium containing 30 or 80 µM Zn (Fig. 7A). The mutant plants did not grow in the presence of high concentrations of Zn (200 and 500 µM) (Fig. 7A). At 200 and 500 µM Zn, the root length of the mutant seedlings decreased to 60 and 10%, respectively, of that of the control seedlings grown in MS medium (30 µM Zn). Two-week-old plants germinated in MS medium were transferred to a cultivation solution containing 0, 1, 200 and 500 µM ZnSO4 for 3 d (Fig. 7B). The mtp1-1 mutant plantlets grew normally in 0 and 1 µM Zn; however, they showed severe chlorosis of leaves and suppression of leaf development in 200 and 500 µM Zn (Fig. 7B). It should be noted that the medium may contain a trace amount of Zn even in the 0 µM Zn culture medium, since no special measures were taken to remove completely metal ions contaminating either purified water or other reagents. Thus we could not draw any conclusions on the effect of complete Zn deficiency on the growth of the mtp1-1 mutant. AtMTP1 has been determined to transport Cd although at only 1% of the Zn transport rate (Bloß et al. 2002). We examined the sensitivity of mtp1-1 mutants to other metals including Cd, by monitoring the root growth of germinating seedlings as shown in Fig. 7C. In the presence of 80 µM Co, 40 µM Cd or 40 µM Ni, the root length was 60–70% of that under control conditions (15 µM Zn). However, there was no difference between the wild type and the mutant plants. Manganese did not affect the growth even at 1.5 mM. These results suggest that AtMTP1 is highly specific to Zn at least at high concentrations of the metal. The negative effect of these metal ions at higher concentrations remains to be examined. In addition to the low growth rate of mtp1-1 mutant seedlings in high concentrations of Zn, we observed a change in cell morphology. Figure 8 shows the sections prepared from mutant plants grown in 500 µM ZnCl2. Plasmolysis tends to occur in cells of plants grown in the presence of high concentrations of Zn (Fig. 8B–E). As the major changes in the mtp1-1 mutant plant, a large part of the parenchyma tissues in leaves was broken down and most mesophyll cells disappeared (Fig. 8C), while the breakdown of cells was not observed in the wild-type plant (Fig. 8B). The damage in leaves was more severe than that in roots, which did not have any collapsed cells (Fig. 8E). The collapse of cells may be a cause of etiolation of leaves in the mutant plants as observed in Fig. 6 and 7.
!~MM~! Surface-sterilized seeds of A. thaliana (ecotypes, Col-0 and WS) were germinated on sterile MS-salt plates containing 2.3 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose for growing the roots with shaking in a rotary shaker (100 rpm). All plants were grown at 23°C under long-day conditions (light/dark regime of 16 h/8 h, cool-white lamp). A. thaliana (ecotype, Columbia) suspension-cultured cells (‘Deep’ cells; previous name, Col-0 cells), which originated from roots, were a kind gift from Dr. Masaaki Umeda of Tokyo University, and were cultured as described previously (Umeda et al. 1998). T87 cells, which were prepared from whole seedlings of A. thaliana (Axelos et al. 1992, Nakamichi et al. 2004), were also used. In some experiments, cells were cultured in JPL medium containing 19 mM KNO3, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.45 mM MgSO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 0.15 mM Na2HPO4, 30 µM H3BO3, 30 µM MnSO4, 11 µM ZnSO4, 1.6 µM KI, 0.3 µM Na2MoO4, 32 nM CoCl2, 3 nM CuSO4, 20 µM FeSO4 and 20 µM Na2-EDTA. The MS medium contained 19 mM KNO3, 3 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM H3BO3, 0.1 mM MnSO4, 30 µM ZnSO4, 5.2 µM KI, 1.0 µM Na2MoO4, 0.1 µM CoCl2, 0.1 µM CuSO4, 0.1 mM FeSO4, 0.1 mM Na2-EDTA, and 21 mM NH4NO3 as minerals. In experiments described in Fig. 6 and 7B, we used a cultivation solution, which contained 0.28 mM KH2PO4, 1.25 mM KNO3, 1.5 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 5 µM Fe(III)-EDTA, 25 µM H3BO3, 5 µM MnCl2, 0.5 µM CuSO4, 50 µM KCl and 0.1 µM Na2MoO4, buffered at pH 5.7 with 3 mM MES-KOH (pH 5.7). Roots of 30-day-old plants, in hydroponic culture, were homogenized in a homogenizing medium containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM sorbitol, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 100 µM p-(amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF). The homogenate was filtered through four layers of Miracloth (EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany), and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000×g for 30 min and then the precipitate was suspended in homogenizing medium. The suspension (crude membranes) was layered on sucrose density gradients (11 ml, 15–45%), centrifuged at 77,000×g for 17 h, and then fractionated into 0.5 ml fractions. Intact vacuoles were prepared from the protoplasts of A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells and then the highly purified preparation of vacuolar membranes was prepared from the isolated vacuoles as described previously (Shimaoka et al. 2004). For preparation of antibodies, a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of AtMTP1 (At2g46800, positions 37–50, CGFSDSKNASGDAHE) was synthesized, linked with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then injected into rabbits. The peptide-specific antibodies against the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (AHA3, At5g57350, positions 690–704, CTISKDRVKPSPTPDS; an additional cysteine is underlined), Bip (At5g42020, positions 285–298, SKDNKALGKLRREC) and subunit a of vacuolar H+-ATPase (AtVHA-a, At2g21410, positions 117–135, ELVEINANNDKLQRSYNELC) were also prepared by the same procedure. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, USA). After blocking with de-fatted milk, the membrane filter was incubated with primary antibody (2,000-fold dilution) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A. In control experiments, the corresponding antigen peptide was added to the first antibody solution before incubation with the blot membrane at a concentration of 1.5 µg ml–1. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 22°C and then used for immunoblotting. Chemiluminescent reagents ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and Super Signal (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, CA) were used for detection of antigens. For isolation of the AtMTP1 cDNA, total RNA was isolated from 3-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings, and converted to cDNAs using Superscript™ II RNase H–reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carisbad, USA) and an oligo(dT) adapter primer [5′-CGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGC(T)17–3′]. AtMTP1 cDNAs were then directly amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a pair of primers: 5′-CACCATGGAGTCTTCAAGTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCTCGATTTGTATCGTG-3′ (reverse). The cDNA was inserted into a Gateway entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), and then the AtMTP1 DNA was introduced into yeast expression vector pYES/DEST52 (Invitrogen) by the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The plasmid was transferred into yeast strain W303 (MATaleu2 ura3 his3 trp1 ade2 can1-100) by the LiOAc/PEG method (Gietz et al. 1995) and grown in SC minimal medium (Invitrogen). AtMTP1 was expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter in SC minimal galactose medium. Crude membranes were prepared from yeast cells cultured for 24 h at 30°C as described previously (Nakanishi et al. 2001). The AtMTP1 was detected by immunoblotting. Fusion proteins with GFP were produced by inserting the PCR products of AtMTP1 into a newly prepared Gateway vector New-pUGW5 (developed by Tsuyoshi Nakagawa) using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). It was transiently expressed in A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells as described previously (Ueda et al. 2001, Uemura et al. 2004) with a few modifications. Cultured cells were incubated in enzyme solution for 80 min at 30°C under gentle agitation to prepare protoplasts and then passed through a nylon mesh (41 µm pore). Protoplasts containing the plasmid were incubated with gentle agitation at 23°C for 12 h in the dark. Transformed cells were viewed using a confocal laser microscope (FV500, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (DP50, Olympus). The T-DNA insertion line in AtMTP1 (FLAG-539A04) was obtained from the source of Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines made by Laboratoire de Génétique et Amélioration des Plantes, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Versailles. A homozygous transgenic line was selected and the location of the T-DNA insertion in AtMTP1 was determined by PCR with an AtMTP1-specific (5′-GGGTGACTGTTACCACTCATCACCATC-3′) and T-DNA-specific Tag5 in the left border (5′-CTACAAATTGCCTTTTCTTATCGAC-3′) primers. For the mutant complementation, the MTP1 gene on the pENTR-MTP1 entry vector was cloned in pGWB2 binary vector with the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus, and introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101::PM90 strain and then used to transform mtp1-1 homozygous mutant plants by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent 1988). For transmission electron microscopy, 2-week-old rosette leaves or roots were cut into 1 mm wide pieces. Tissue was fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylic acid buffer, pH 7.4, and then washed four times for 15 min each in 0.1 M cacodylic acid buffer, pH 7.4, and post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 4 h. After three washes of 5 min each in 0.1 M cacodylic acid buffer, pH 7.4, tissue was dehydrated through an ethanol series (50–100%) for 20 min each at room temperature. The tissue was infiltrated with an epoxy resin (EPON812; TAAB Laboratories, Berkshire, UK) at 60°C for 2 d. Ultrathin sections were viewed counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) JEM2000 EX transmission electron microscope.
