!~ABS~! SNAREs (soluble N -ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) which locate on the specific organelle membrane assure the correct vesicular transport by mediating specific membrane fusions. SNAREs are referred to as R- or Q-SNAREs on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarities and specific conserved residues. All of the Arabidopsis R-SNAREs have a N-terminal domain, called the longin domain (LD). In this study, we investigated the vacuolar targeting mechanism of Arabidopsis R-SNAREs. The vacuolar localized AtVAMP711 was used as the mother protein of GFP-tagged chimeric proteins joined to several domains such as the LD, the SNARE motif (SNM) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) of other organelle-localized R-SNAREs. The results showed that, whereas the TMD is not relevant for the vacuolar targeting, a complete LD is essential for the vacuolar and subcellular targeting.
!~RES~! VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domains, the LD, SNM and the transmembrane domain (TMD). Amino acid sequence analysis showed that vacuolar localized VAMP711, AtVAMP712 and AtVAMP713 share over 90% similarities with each other, and ∼80% and ∼60% similarities with Golgi-localized VAMP714 and plasma membrane/endosome localized VAMP7 proteins, respectively. In spite of the high homology of the VAMP7s proteins, they showed different subcellular localizations [bib17] . To determine the roles played by the three different domains (LD, SNM and TMD) of VAMP7 proteins in vacuolar sorting, AtVAMP711 was used as a model of vacuolar localized protein ( [fig1] A). AtVAMP721, AtVAMP714 and AtVAMP727 were used as the PM-, Golgi-, and endosome-localized proteins, respectively ( [fig1] B, C and D). We have already shown that the dot structures of GFP-AtVAMP714 and GFP-VAMP727 were merged with the fluorescence of SYP31 (Golgi marker) and endocytic dye FM4-64 (endosome marker), respectively [bib17 bib21] . Chimeric proteins were generated by replacing the corresponding domains of these proteins with that of AtVAMP711. To examine whether the TMD is the determinant for the vacuolar targeting or not, the GFP tagged chimeric AtVAMP711 proteins replacing the C-terminal (CT) region with those of PM-localized AtVAMP721, were transiently expressed in the protoplast of Arabidopsis suspension cells. Two different CT fragment were used in the experiments: CT-s (short), including TMD and intravesicular tail, and CT-l (long), including further 13 residues from the coiled coil domain. GFP fluorescence of GFP-AtVAMP711/PM-type-CT-s and GFP-AtVAMP711/PM-type-CT-l was observed on the vacuolar membrane like wild type AtVAMP711 ( [fig2] A and B, compared with [fig1] A). GFP-AtVAMP721/Vac-type-CT-s and GFP-AtVAMP721/Vac-type-CT-l which contain the vacuolar-type of CT-s and CT-l, respectively, were appeared on the plasma membrane, but not on the vacuolar membrane ( [fig2] C and D). These results suggest that the CT containing TMD is not a vacuolar targeting determinant. GFP-tagged truncated AtVAMP711(GFP-AtVAMP711ΔNT-s), lacking the N-terminal short fragment (NT-s) which is corresponded to the truncated LD, lost the vacuolar-targeting ability and appeared on the plasma membrane and the small dot structures which are considered to be trans -Golgi network (TGN), or endosome ( [fig3] A, compared with [fig1] A). GFP-AtVAMP712ΔNT-s and GFP-AtVAMP713ΔNT-s, which were the NT-s-deleted proteins of other vacuolar-localized VAMP7 proteins, also lost their vacuolar-targeting properties and were localized on the plasma membrane and the TGN/endosome ( [fig3] B and C). These results imply that the LD may be important for the vacuolar targeting of the vacuolar-localized VAMPs (AtVAMP711, AtVAMP712 and AtVAMP713). However, a substitution of the NT-s of AtVAMP721 (PM) with that of AtVAMP711 (vacuolar NT-s) (GFP-tagged vacuolar-type-NT-s/VAMP721) did not affect the PM and the TGN/endosome localization, resulting in no vacuolar localization ( [fig4] A, compared with [fig1] A and B). Further addition of 15 amino acids to the NT-s (which is corresponded to the complete LD [bib10 bib13] in an additional chimera), GFP-vacuolar-type-LD/VAMP721 (containing of the LD of the vacuolar type and the SNM and the TMD of the PM type), successfully conferred the vacuolar targeting ( [fig4] B, compared with [fig1] A and B). The localization of this chimeric protein was not completely the same as that of AtVAMP711 ( [fig1 fig4] B) because the PM and the TGN/endosome targeting was also observed. Since the plasma membrane was proposed as the default destination of single-pass membrane proteins [bib22] , the plasma membrane localization of this chimeric protein might be caused by the default transport. Both the LD of the vacuolar type (AtvAMP711) were substituted for those of the Golgi type (AtVAMP714) and the endosome type (AtVAMP727). GFP-vacuolar-type-LD/VAMP714 and GFP-vacuolar-type-LD/VAMP727 were localized to the vacuolar membrane ( [fig4] C and D, compared with [fig1] C and D). Together with all of the data, we concluded that complete LD of AtVAMP711 play a key role for the vacuolar targeting. Is the LD capable of targeting plant VAMP7 also to organelle other than the vacuole? To answer this, PM-type LD, Golgi-type LD and endosome-type-LD were attached separately to the vacuolar-type SNM/TMD, and their subcellular localization were examined. GFP-tagged PM-type-LD/AtVAMP711 was observed to the plasma membrane and TGN/endosome like wild type AtVAMP721 ( [fig5] A, compare with [fig1] B), implying that PM-type-LD may play a role for the plasma membrane targeting. Moreover, Golgi-type-LD/AtVAMP711 and Endosome-type-LD/AtVAMP711 was also found on the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, respectively ( [fig5] B and C, compared with [fig1] C and D). However, interestingly, they also appeared on the vacuolar membrane. In the case of Golgi and endosome, the LD domain may not be sufficient for changing the subcellular localization completely. The SNM or TMD also might affect the subcellular localization.
!~MM~! The cDNAs for Arabidopsis VAMP7 proteins have been isolated by RT-PCR [bib17] . By using these cDNAs as templates, the cDNA fragment necessary for the chimeric recombination was amplified by using sequential PCR methods [bib18] . Open reading frames (ORFs) of the amplified chimeric cDNA were fused to the ORFs of sGFP (synthetic GFP) of the CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-NOS3′ vector (provided by Y. Niwa). For the C-terminal replacement study, cDNAs that corresponded to residues 176–219 (CT-l) and 189–219 (CT-s) of AtVAMP711 or residues 180–219 (CT-l) and 193–219 (CT-s) of AtVAMP721 were used. For the N-terminal deletion or replacement studies, cDNAs that corresponded to residues 1–111 (NT-s) and 1–126 (NT-l) of AtVAMP711, residues 1–111 (NT-s) of AtVAMP712, residues 1–112 (NT-s) of AtVAMP713, residues 1–127 (NT-l) of AtVAMP714, residues 1- 130 (NT-l) of AtVAMP721 or residues 1–149 (NT-s) of AtVAMP727 were used. The transient expression of the GFP-fused proteins in Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells was performed as described previously [bib19 bib20] . Briefly, 2 g of cultured cells was incubated in 25 ml of enzyme solution (0.4 M mannitol, 5 mM EGTA, 1% cellulase R-10 and 0.05% pectolyase Y-23) for 1–2 h at 30 °C and filtered with a nylon mesh (125 μm pore). The resultant protoplasts were washed twice with 25 ml of solution A (0.4 M mannitol, 70 mM CaCl 2 , and 5 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.7) and resuspended in 1 ml of the MaMg solution (0.4 M mannitol, 15 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.7). After the addition of 2 μg of plasmid and 50 μg of carrier DNA to 100 μl of the protoplast solution, 400 μl of DNA uptake solution (0.4 M mannnitol, 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 and 0.1 M Ca(NO 3 ) 2 ) was added. The protoplasts were incubated on ice for 20 min and then diluted with 10 ml of a dilution solution (0.4 M mannitol, 125 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose and 1.5 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.7). The collected protoplasts were resuspended in 4 ml of MS medium containing 0.4 M mannitol and incubated with gentle agitation at 23 °C for 16 h in the dark. Observations were done using a confocal laser scanning microscope, Zeiss LSM LSM5 PASCAL equipped with green HeNe and argon lasers.
