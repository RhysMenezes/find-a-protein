!~ABS~! Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases; apyrases) (EC 3.6.1.5) hydrolyze di- and triphosphate nucleotides, but not monophosphate nucleotides. They are categorized as E-type ATPases, have a broad divalent cation (Mg2+, Ca2+) requirement for activation and are insensitive to inhibitors of F-type, P-type and V-type ATPases. Among the seven NTPDases identified in Arabidopsis, only APYRASE 1 (AtAPY1) and APYRASE 2 (AtAPY2) have been previously characterized. In this work, either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 tagged with C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by their respective native promoter can rescue the apy1 apy2 double knockout (apy1 apy2 dKO) successfully, and confocal microscopy reveals that these two Arabidopsis apyrases reside in the Golgi apparatus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 can complement the Golgi-localized GDA1 mutant, rescuing its aberrant protein glycosylation phenotype. In Arabidopsis, microsomes of the wild type show higher substrate preferences toward UDP compared with other NDP substrates. Loss-of-function Arabidopsis AtAPY1 mutants exhibit reduced microsomal UDPase activity, and this activity is even more significantly reduced in the loss-of-function AtAPY2 mutant and in the AtAPY1/AtAPY2 RNA interference (RNAi) technology repressor lines. Microsomes from wild-type plants also have detectable GDPase activity, which is significantly reduced in apy2 but not apy1 mutants. The GFP-tagged AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 constructs in the apy1 apy2 dKO plants can restore microsomal UDP/GDPase activity, confirming that they both also have functional competency. The cell walls of apy1, apy2 and the RNAi-silenced lines all have an increased composition of galactose, but the transport efficiency of UDP-galactose across microsomal membranes was not altered. Taken together, these results reveal that AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 are Golgi-localized nucleotide diphosphatases and are likely to have roles in regulating UDP/GDP concentrations in the Golgi lumen.
!~RES~! Since NTPDases have been reported to have various localizations within the cell and play a variety of functional roles at these different locales, we investigated the subcellular localization of AtAPY1 and AtAPY2, using genomic clones with C-terminal GFP fusions. Previous reports had shown that pollen lacking both AtAPY1/AtAPY2 is infertile, thus apy1 apy2 dKO mutants cannot be obtained (CITATION). C-terminal GFP fusion constructs comprising either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 were stably transformed into either APY1apy1 apy2apy2 or apy1apy1 APY2apy2 plants. The rescued transformants were screened using 3′-untranslated region (UTR)-specific primer sets that can distinguish native AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 from the APY-GFP inserts (Fig. 1A, B; Supplementary Fig. S1). These T2 lines were initially screened for the presence of T-DNA insertions in both the AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 loci (data not shown). Thus, segregation of PROAPY1:APY1-GFP (or PROAPY2:APY2-GFP) transformants should follow a Mendelian inheritance and display a 2 : 1 segregation ratio between AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 and T-DNA inserts (apy1 or apy2) in the T2 generation (Fig. 1A, B). Native AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 mRNA could not be detected by reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) in the apy1 apy2 dKO rescue lines containing the APY-GFP constructs (Supplementary Fig. S2). No segregation of T-DNA alleles occurred in the T3 generations, providing further genetic evidence that the PROAPY1:AtAPY1-GFP or PROAPY2:AtAPY2-GFP fusion constructs can rescue the apy1 apy2 dKO plants through proper function and correct localization (Fig. 1C). The apy1 apy2 dKO seedlings expressing either PROAPY1:APY1-GFP or PROAPY2:APY2-GFP show no discernible phenotype, which is in agreement with the absence of a visual phenotype in the single apy1 or apy2 mutants and also supports the notion that AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 play redundant roles in Arabidopsis (Fig. 1D). Attempts to fuse GFP to the N-terminus of AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 failed to complement apy1 apy2 dKO lines, suggesting the importance of the N-terminal region for proper function/localization (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The apy1 apy2 dKO plants containing either PROAPY1:APY1-GFP or PROAPY2:APY2-GFP showed similar punctate structures (Fig. 2). The cis-Golgi marker Man49-mCherry (Fig. 2A, C) and the plasma membrane-specific marker aquaporin PIP2A-mCherry (Fig. 2B, D) were each stably transformed into both PROAPY:APY-GFP rescue lines to aid visualization and confirm the identity of these punctate structures (CITATION, CITATION). The signal from both AtAPY1–GFP and AtAPY2–GFP in the apy1 apy2 dKO background co-localized with the cis-Golgi marker, indicating their functional residency in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2A, C). Furthermore, we also examined the AtAPY1–GFP and AtAPY2–GFP signal in pollen tubes where AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 are abundantly expressed (Fig. 2E). The internal punctate signal is also observed. Unfortunately, the cis-Golgi marker Man49-mCherry and the plasma membrane-specific marker aquaporin PIP2A-mCherry are driven by the 35S promoter, which is only weakly expressed in the pollen tubes (CITATION). Several pollen tubes were examined, but no marker signals could be obtained to demonstrate marker co-localization. Confocal images obtained from both root and pollen tubes consistently showed internal punctuate structures, and no signal could be discerned to support the localization of AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, D).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Immunoblot analysis of complemented apy1 apy2 dKO lines with antibodies against GFP was undertaken to ensure the integrity of the AtAPY1–GFP and AtAPY2–GFP constructs in these lines and to confirm the Golgi-based GFP signal corresponded to the intact protein constructs (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S3). Both total protein and microsomal fractions from complemented plants were examined. Analysis of complemented lines resulted in a GFP-specific signal that coincided with the predicted molecular weight of the heterologous proteins, AtAPY1–GFP (predicted 78 kDa) and AtAPY2–GFP (predicted 78 kDa) (http://www.scripps.edu/∼cdputnam/protcalc.html). The analysis also indicated that AtAPY1 appears to undergo N-terminal processing (approximately 3 kDa) after localization to the microsomal fraction (Fig. 3).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The yeast apyrases GDA1 and YND1 are functionally characterized Golgi resident NDPases which exhibit protein glycosylation and cell wall phenotypes when disrupted. In order to investigate the functional roles of the AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 proteins in the Golgi apparatus, we undertook a complementation analysis of the yeast Δgda1 and Δynd1 mutants. Constructs containing either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 were transformed into both Δgda1 and Δynd1 yeast cells. The vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) with four N-linked carbohydrate chains is an excellent marker enzyme to assess N-glycosylation in yeast (CITATION). As previously demonstrated, CPY migrates faster in the Δgda1 background due to changes in N-glycosylation when compared with WT yeast (Fig. 4A). The expression of either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 in the Δgda1 background could successfully revert this increased mobility, suggesting that the Golgi-localized AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 can functionally replace the yeast GDA1 protein (Fig. 4A). A similar finding with only AtAPY1 was also recently observed using an identical approach (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, no mobility changes of CPY were observed in the Δynd1 yeast cells lacking the second yeast apyrase YND1 (a homolog of GDA1). To our knowledge, this finding has not been previously reported, even though this mutant is known to display a glycosylation phenotype (CITATION). Thus, in order to determine whether either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 was also able to replace YND1 function, we investigated their ability to rescue another characterized phenotype exhibited by Δynd1 cells. The Δynd1 mutation results in an increased sensitivity to the aminoglycoside hygromycin B due to reduced protein glycosylation or defective cell wall biosynthesis (CITATION). The sensitivity assay indicates that while Δynd1 cells are indeed sensitive to hygromycin B, neither the AtAPY1 nor the AtAPY2 gene products could restore hygromycin B tolerance (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results provide evidence that the Golgi-localized AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 are capable of functionally complementing the Golgi-localized yeast apyrase GDA1 but not the functionally similar yeast apyrase YND1. In an attempt to determine whether AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 function in the plant Golgi apparatus, we examined NDPase activity in the Arabidopsis apyrase mutant lines using various NDP substrates (ADP, UDP, CDP or GDP). Microsomes were isolated from 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings and NDPase activity was measured using the malachite green assay. Microsomal preparations of WT Arabidopsis Wassiewskija (Ws) show higher enzyme activity towards UDP when compared with the other NDP substrates (Fig. 5). The loss of either AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 resulted in a significant reduction in UDPase activity in microsomal membrane preparations. The loss of AtAPY2 seemed to have a greater impact on UDPase activity in comparison with the loss of AtAPY1 and it was equivalent to that measured in the RNAi suppressor line R2-4A (APY1-RNAi apy2). A lack of AtAPY1 in the single mutant did not significantly reduce GDPase activity compared with microsomes isolated from the WT, supporting the notion that AtAPY2 may have a substrate preference for GDP when compared with AtAPY1. The NDPase activities measured in the RNAi suppressor line R2-4A are similar to those measured in the apy2 mutant. This result probably reflects the fact that the RNAi only reduces AtAPY1 in the apy2 background and thus residual AtAPY1 protein may be present in microsomes from 7-day-old plants. Both the AtAPY1–GFP and AtAPY2–GFP lines can restore the UDPase/GDPase activities in the apy1 apy2 dKO mutant lines, and this result biochemically confirms the function of the fusion protein (Fig. 5). There was no measured difference in microsomal ADPase activity among the mutants examined (Fig. 5). Microsomes isolated from apy2 plants and the APY2-GFP line2 were also significantly reduced in CDPase activity. However, this has little physiological significance since as far as we are aware there is no CDP substrate in the Golgi lumen. Taken together, these data indicate that both AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 function as a UDPase/GDPase.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Given the complementation in yeast and reduction of UDPase/GDPase activities in APY mutants, it has been proposed that a reduction in NDP hydrolysis and the reduction of substrates for the nucleotide sugar exchange between the Golgi lumen and the cytosol could result in reduced glycosyltransferase activity and lead to cell wall defects (CITATION). We evaluated the monosaccharide composition of cell wall extracts from the three apyrase mutant lines (Supplementary Table S1). Overall, the monosaccharide content of cell wall extracts from the mutant lines was not altered, with the exception of galactose, which was significantly higher in all Arabidopsis apyrase mutant backgrounds (Fig. 6A). Consequently, we sought to investigate the UDP-galactose transport efficiency in Golgi-enriched membrane fractions of the RNAi suppression line R2-4A. This line exhibits a drastic growth phenotype due to the inhibition of both AtAPY1 and AtAPY2. Unexpectedly, UDP-galactose transporter rates in microsomes isolated from 2-week-old seedlings of the R2-4A line revealed that UDP-galactose transport was similar to that measured in the WT (Fig. 6B).

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Ws plants were used as the WT in this study. The Arabidopsis apy1, apy2 and apyrase RNAi lines (R2-4A) were developed previously (CITATION, CITATION). For matrix polysaccharide composition analysis, seeds were surface sterilized and planted on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium [4.3 g l−1 MS (Caisson), 0.5% (w/v) MES, 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8 or 1.0% (w/v) agar (Sigma), pH 5.7]. All plates contained 4 µM estradiol for RNAi induction in R2-4A plants. Plates were placed upright in a culture chamber and grown at 23°C under 24 h fluorescent light for 7 d. Whole seedlings were used for the analysis of monosaccharide composition. For isolation of microsomes, seeds were cultured in half-strength MS medium (Caisson) with 1 mM MES, 2% sucrose and 4 µM estradiol (pH 5.9) for 7 d. The cultures were maintained at 24°C under 24 h fluorescent light in an orbital shaker (120 r.p.m.). Whole seedlings were collected for the analysis. Binary vectors containing a C-terminal GFP fusion with the AtAPY1 (At3g04080) or AtAPY2 (At5g18280) promoter and coding sequences were produced using Gateway technology (CITATION). The Arabidopsis AtAPY1 genomic region was cloned from –1,118 bp upstream of the translation initiation site to the final codon (excluding STOP) by PCR using DNA isolated from Arabidopsis [bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) T6K12] with primers ApyraseI-5′pt (5′-TCAAAGGCAAAAGTTGTGGA-3′) and ApyraseI-3′4002 (5′-TGGTGAGGATACTGCTTCTAGT-3′). The Apyrase 2 genomic region was cloned using the same approach, from –1,008 bp upstream of the translation initiation site with primers ApyraseII-5′pt (5′-CAAATTCACTCTCGTCCGGTTGAGTAGTAT-3′) and ApyraseII-3′-TGA (5′-CGGTGAGGATACGGCCTCGATGGCGC-3′) from Arabidopsis (BAC MGR7). All the amplifications were performed using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the amplified fragments were cloned (TA cloning) in the entry vector PC8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen). The constructs were introduced into the pMDC107 vector using the Gateway® LR reaction (Invitrogen). Since apy1 apy2 dKO pollen cannot germinate (CITATION), the heterozygous mutant of APY1apy1 apy2apy2 or apy1apy1 APY2apy2 was transformed with the vector pMDC107 containing PROAPY1:APY1-GFP or PROAPY2:APY2-GFP, respectively, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) via floral dip (CITATION). All T1 plants were selected with 25 mg l−1 hygromycin on germination media. Plants with resistance were selected and transplanted to the soil. T2 seeds from individual T1 lines were screened for complementation. For identification of apy1apy1 apy2apy2- or APY1apy1 apy2apy2-containing PROAPY1:APY1-GFP and identification of apy1apy1 apy2apy2- or apy1apy1 APY2apy2-containing PROAPY2:APY2-GFP, they were first screened with previously described primer sets (CITATION). After the background heterozygosity of APY1apy1 apy2apy2 was confirmed, the transgenic APY1-GFP signal could be distinguished from the native AtAPY1 by a specific set of primers: Apy1F-1457 (5′-GTTCCTTTGGAGAATGAGCTCGAG-3′) and Apy1R-4011 (5′-CCCAAAATTGCCTTCCTCATGGTGAGGATA-3′). The apy1apy1 APY2apy2-APY2GFP was screened using the above procedure but using the primer set: Apy2F-3427 (5′-TAAAGCCCCTGCTTCACAAT-3′) and Apy2R-4262 (5′-GCTTTGGCAGAAATCAAAAGA-3′). The genetic background of T3 was also examined using the primer sets from CITATION. The rescued apy1 apy2 dKO mutant lines containing PROAPY1:APY1-GFP or PROAPY2:APY2-GFP were transformed with mCherry-tagged organelle markers for the cis-Golgi and plasma membrane (CITATION). The transformants were screened with Basta® (120 mg l−1) in the soil. T2 seeds were collected for visualization by confocal microscopy. The pollen germination method followed exactly the protocol published by CITATION. The pollen was germinated on the media for 4 to 6 h before imaging by microscopy. Images were collected using a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm for GFP and at 543 nm for mCherry. Emission was collected at 500–534 nm (GFP) and 600–679 nm (mCherry). All images were obtained with ×10 ocular and ×63 objective magnifications (oil). The pinhole diameter was set at 1 airy unit. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). The S. cerevisiae strains BY4741 (WT: MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0), Δgda1 (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, gda1Δ0) and Δynd1 (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, ynd1Δ0) were obtained from Open Biosystem (Thermo Scientific). The AtAPY1/AtAPY2 cDNA sequence from the start codon to the termination codon before the TGA was cloned using the following primers APY1-For (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGACGGCGAAGCGAGCGATC-3′)/APY1-Rev (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGGTGAGGATACTGCTTCTAT-3′) and APY2-For (5′- GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGACGGCGAAGCGTGGGATTGG-3′)/APY2-Rev (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCGGTGAGGATACGGCCTCGAT-3′. The PCR products were recombined into pDONR-F1-Zeo (CITATION) according to instructions (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The AtAPY1/AtAPY2 pDONR-F1-Zeo constructs were recombined into a Gateway®-modified pDR-Leu vector generated by transferring the pPMA-GW-tADH expression cassette from pDRf1-GW (CITATION) into the YEplac181 shuttle vector (CITATION) for use in complementation analysis. Yeast were transformed with the different plasmids using the lithium acetate transformation method (CITATION) and selected on solid medium containing Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) without amino acids (Difco 291940; Difco) supplemented with 3% glucose and 1× dropout-leucine (CSM-ura; Sunrise Science Products). Total protein was isolated from S. cerevisiae as described previously (CITATION). The protein was quantified by Bradford assay (Thermo Scientific) (CITATION). A total of 5 µg of soluble protein was mixed with 0.2 M Tris–HCl, pH 6.5, 8% (w/v) SDS, 8% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 40% (v/v) glycerol and 0.04% (w/v) bromophenol blue, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS–PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. An antibody against CPY (Abcam: ab34636) was used at 1 : 5,000 for assessment of differential glycosylation in S. cerevisiae. Heterologously expressed AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 were detected using the Universal antibody (UNI) against the Gateway® attB2 site (Invitrogen), used at 1 : 20,000 (CITATION), followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1 : 20,000) (KPL Inc.) for 1 h. The detection was by chemiluminescence using the KPL Protein Detector LumiGLO Reserve Western Blotting Kit (#54-13-50) (KPL Inc.). Arabidopsis total protein was isolated from 0.3 g of 7-day-old seedlings. Tissues were ground in 1 ml of extraction buffer: 0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.01 M MG132, 0.2 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1× proteinase inhibitors (Roche, complete mini, #11836170001), and boiled for 5 min. A total of 20 µg of microsomal protein was mixed with 2× Laemmli Sample Buffer (Biorad #161-0737EDU). All the samples were run on an 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. An antibody against GFP (Abcam: ab290) was used at 1 : 5,000. The single colonies of each mutant were isolated and cultured in minimal liquid medium (described in the previous section) overnight. Then the liquid cultures were serially diluted and spotted on the YPD or the YPD solid medium with 50 µg hygromycin B (Calbiochem). The plant microsomal isolation procedure was slightly modified from previous methods (Rautengarten et al. 2011). Seven-day-old liquid cultured seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and then were re-suspended in extraction buffer (5 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 400 mM sucrose and 1 mM DTT). To remove plant debris, the lysate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 3,000×g at 4°C. The supernatant was taken and centrifuged at 50,000×g at 4°C for 1 h. The resulting pellet was washed with the extraction buffer and centrifuged at 50,000×g at 4°C for another 1 h. The final membrane pellet was re-suspended in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for the NDPase assay. A total of 20 µg of microsomal protein was incubated in 1 ml of reaction buffer [3 mM NDP (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 mM MnSO4, 30 mM Tris-MES, pH 6.5, and 0.03% (v/v) Triton X] for 1 h at room temperature. The released phosphate was measured using the malachite green phosphate assay kit (ScienCell) with slight modifications, which is that 100 µl of malachite green reagent A and B were added to the 50 µl solution. The incubation time used was as described in the kit instructions. Alcohol-insoluble residues were prepared from 7-day-old seedlings according to previous procedures (Smith-Moritz et al. 2012). The samples were analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) (Dionex) using a CarboPac PA20 column based on previous established protocols (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants were grown for 15 d in liquid culture in the presence of 4 µM estradiol. The plants were then homogenized using a razor blade in 5 ml of 0.5 M sucrose, 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 6.65), 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT (freshly prepared). Membranes were separated following the procedure described by CITATION. Briefly, the homogenate was filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 3,000×g for 3 min. The supernatant was then layered on 5 ml of a 1.3 M sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 108,000×g for 90 min. The upper phase was removed without disturbing the interface fraction, and sucrose layers of 1.1, 0.7 and 0.25 M were overlaid on the membrane pad. The discontinuous sucrose gradient was then centrifuged at 108,000×g for 90 min. The 0.7/1.1 M interface enriched in Golgi apparatus membranes was collected, diluted and centrifuged separately at 108,000×g for 50 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of 0.5 M sucrose, 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 6.65) and 5 mM MgCl2 and stored at –80°C until use. Golgi-enriched membranes, obtained as described above, were used to perform [3H]UDP-galactose uptake assays, based on a filtration method previously described (CITATION). A 50 µg aliquot of protein from the Golgi apparatus-enriched membrane fraction was resuspended in a buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0). The reaction was initiated by adding 100 µl of 100 µM [3H]UDP-galactose (approximately 20 nCi), to reach 1 ml, final volume. Aliquots were taken at different times and filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose–ester filters (Millipore), previously treated with 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0) and 1 mM UDP-galactose. The reaction was stopped by filtering and immediately washed using 5 ml of ice-cold 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0) and 1 mM UDP-galactose. The filters were air-dried and the remaining radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The uptake of [3H]UDP-galactose is reported as c.p.m. of [3H]UDP-galactose. Supplementary data are available at PCP online.
