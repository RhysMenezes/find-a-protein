!~RES~! In order to identify EHs involved in cutin biosynthesis, we mined publicly available transcriptome data to identify putative EH genes co‐expressed with cutin‐related P450 genes using the CYPEDIA platform (http://www-ibmp.u-strasbg.fr/~CYPedia; Ehlting et al., CITATION). Through this approach, we found the A. thaliana gene At3g05600 (AtEH1), which was coexpressed in the ‘organ and tissue’ data set with CYP77A4, a known FA epoxygenase (Sauveplane et al., CITATION), and CYP86A8, which is involved in cutin synthesis (Wellesen et al., CITATION). The catalytic amino acids identified in various characterized EHs are conserved in AtEH1 (Fig. 1), in particular Asp 105 and His 303, which correspond to Asp 333 and His 523 from mouse EH that are implicated in hydrolysis of the epoxide during catalysis (Pinot et al., CITATION). Thus, protein sequence analysis supported the hypothesis that AtEH1 is an EH. It is noteworthy that AtEH1 is missing the N‐terminal domain of mammalian enzymes, resulting in a fairly small protein (331 aa) with a calculated mass of 37.2 kDa and a pI of 5.44.  [[FIGURE]] As already mentioned, mammalian EHs are both cytosolic and microsomal (ER membrane‐bound proteins) (Morisseau, CITATION). Much less information is available concerning plant EHs, but both localizations have been reported based on enzymatic activity (Blée & Schuber, CITATION; Pinot et al., CITATION; Sauveplane et al., CITATION). To determine if AtEH1 was cytosolic or membrane‐bound, subcellular localization of the protein was explored via transient expression of N‐terminally or C‐terminally EGFP‐tagged AtEH1 proteins in N. benthamiana leaves. As presented in Fig. 2, confocal observations showed that AtEH1 behaved as a typical cytosolic protein when compared with control soluble mRFP (lanes a and b) and EGFP (lane c) and behaved differently from the ER membrane‐bound CYP51 anchor (lanes d and e). This result was consistent regardless of the position of the EGFP tag. This finding was confirmed by subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis, showing that AtEH1 occurrence is restricted to the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3, lane 1).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To assess the EH capabilities of AtEH1, we first incubated radiolabeled 9,10‐epoxystearic acid (Fig. 4e) with cytosol of yeast expressing AtEH1, and the reaction products were resolved by thin‐layer radiochromatography (Fig. 4). Incubation was performed with the cytosolic fraction of yeast expressing AtEH1 (Fig. 4a), or with the cytosolic fraction of yeast transformed with an empty vector (Fig. 4b). After 20 min, a single major metabolite was formed (Fig. 4a, peak 1). It was not formed in an incubation with cytosol from yeast transformed with a void plasmid (Fig. 4b). Taken together, these results suggest that formation of the metabolite from peak 1 is attributable to the catalytic activity of AtEH1. Metabolite from this peak was purified, derivatized and subjected to GC/MS analysis (see the Materials and Methods section). The mass spectrum of the derivatized metabolite 1 showed an ion at m/z (relative intensity; %) values of 73 (100%) ((CH3)3Si+), 75 (24%) ((CH3)3Si+ = O), 443 (M‐31) (loss of OCH3 from methyl ester), 259 (65%) and 215 (66%) resulting from cleavage between two hydroxyls carrying the trimethylsilyl group generated after hydrolysis by the enzyme. This fragmentation pattern is characteristic of the derivative of 9,10‐dihydroxystearic acid (M = 474). When the carboxyl function of 9,10‐epoxystearic acid was blocked by a methyl, AtEH1 was unable to catalyze the transformation of the epoxide to the corresponding diol (not shown). As shown in Fig. 4(c), a major polar metabolite (peak 2) was produced after incubation of 12,13‐epoxyoctadec‐9‐enoic acid (Fig. 4e), which is a product of a reaction catalyzed by CYP77A4 (Sauveplane et al., CITATION). This major polar metabolite was not produced with the cytosolic fraction of yeast transformed with an empty vector (Fig. 4d). The mass spectrum of this derivatized metabolite showed ions at m/z (relative intensity; %) values of 73 (100%) ((CH3)3Si+) and 75 (28%) ((CH3)3Si+ = O). The mass spectrum also showed ions at 173 (60%) and 299 (22%) resulting from cleavage between two hydroxyls carrying the trimethylsilyl. This fragmentation pattern is characteristic of the derivative of 12,13‐dihydroxyoctadec‐9‐enoic acid (M = 472). These data thus demonstrate that EH1 is an EH acting on 9,10‐epoxystearic acid and on 12,13‐epoxyoctadec‐9‐enoic acid.  [[FIGURE]] No enzymatic activity was detected when incubations were performed with microsomes from transformed yeast, confirming the cytosolic localization of AtEH1 determined by confocal microscopy. Viability of microsomes was checked by measuring palmitic acid metabolism in microsomes of yeast transformed in parallel with a construct coding for CYP94C1 (Fig. S3).  In order to investigate the involvement of AtEH1 in cutin synthesis, we isolated T‐DNA mutant lines homozygous for an insertion in AtEH1 (Fig. S2a). In the insertional mutant lines Ateh1‐1 and Ateh1‐2, transcripts were not detected when analyzed by RT‐PCR (Fig. S2b), which confirmed that they were ko lines. The spatiotemporal pattern of AtEH1 expression investigated by RT‐PCR revealed very low expression in all the organs tested (Fig. S4). Publicly available A. thaliana transcriptome data sets (bar.utoronto.ca) showed higher expression of AtEH1 in seeds (both seed coat and embryos) and to a lesser extent in some parts of flowers, which was corroborated by data from Genevestigator (Hruz et al., CITATION). We therefore first analyzed the composition and content of polyesters in whole mature seeds of these ko lines by GC‐MS. The only significant difference between ko and WT lines in the seed FA cutin monomers was a 20% reduction in 9,10,18‐trihydroxy‐octadecenoic acid in ko (Figs 5a, S5). Because small amounts of a putative epoxy FA could be detected on the GC chromatogram of ko, we decided to set up a more sensitive method based on LC‐MS/MS to analyze the monomer extracts (see the Materials and Methods section). Analysis by this method revealed in ko a striking increase in the expected derivative for a C18:1 hydroxy‐epoxy FA (Fig. 5b). In order to obtain information on the position of the epoxy group in this monomer, free fatty monomers with unopened epoxy rings were prepared from cell walls of WT and ko seeds digested with cutinase from F. solani, and were analyzed by LC‐MS/MS. Based on exact mass, one C18:1 hydroxy‐epoxy free FA monomer abundant in ko could be detected (Fig. S6). Its fragmentation pattern was consistent with an 18‐hydroxy‐9,10‐epoxyoctadecenoic acid, the expected precursor for a 9,10,18‐trihydroxy‐octadecenoic acid.  [[FIGURE]] Analysis of leaf cutin monomers by LC‐MS/MS allowed us to show that disruption of the gene coding for AtEH1 led to an almost complete disappearance of 9,10,18‐trihydroxy‐octadecenoic acid and to a concomitant strong accumulation of the peak identified in seeds as 18‐hydroxy‐9,10‐epoxyoctadecenoic acid (Fig. 5c). A 80% decrease in the other minor leaf monomer 9,10,18‐trihydroxy‐octadecadienoic acid with an accumulation of the corresponding 18‐hydroxy‐9,10‐epoxyoctadecadienoic acid was also noted.  To investigate the function of AtEH1 in seed physiology, we analyzed seed germination rates under standard and hyperosmotic conditions. Seeds of Ateh1 were sown on MS medium in the absence or presence of mannitol (500 mM). On standard MS medium, seeds of Ateh1 and WT lines both germinated at the same rate (Fig. 6a). Under stress conditions, germination of Ateh1 seeds was delayed compared with WT seeds: after 2.5 d on MS, only 50% of Ateh1 seeds had germinated when practically all WT seeds had germinated (Fig. 6b). This delay was not more visible after 5.5 d (Fig. 6b). To investigate the impact of AtEH1 gene disruption on seed coat properties, the permeability of the seed coat of the mutants was studied using tetrazolium salt. As shown in Fig. 7, after staining for 24 h, Ateh1‐1 and Ateh1‐2 seed coats were significantly more permeable (Fig. 7b,c) to dye than were WT seed coats (Fig. 7a).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] EHs are widely distributed proteins, found in all kingdoms (Morisseau, CITATION). We endeavored to reconstruct their evolutionary history in embryophytes to determine whether family diversification occurred in the course of land colonization. A set of 132 sequences derived from 43 land plant species, from bryophytes to angiosperms, were retrieved from genome and transcriptome databases based on their homology to the AtEH1 protein. Already characterized EH sequences from mouse, human and rat were used as an outgroup to polarize the evolutionary scenario. The EH phylogeny overall matched systematics but also uncovered family diversification in recent phylogenetic groups (Fig. 8). Seven genes potentially encoding EHs are, for instance, present in A. thaliana (angiosperms) while only a single gene was found in the fully sequenced Picea abies genome (gymnosperms). Tree structure, however, suggests that an early duplication arose in the ancestor of seed plants, but one duplicate was lost in gymnosperms while being retained in angiosperms (the AtEH6 clade). In the early‐diverging land plants bryophytes and lycophytes, EH was typically present as a single‐copy gene, as observed in the Physcomitrella patens, Marchantia polymorpha and Selaginella moellendorffii genomes (Fig. 8). Taken together, these observations indicate that EH proteins were conserved across land plant evolution and diversified in angiosperms, probably in support of the increased complexity of reproductive tissues.

!~MM~! Radiolabeled [1‐14C]oleic acid (50 Ci mol−1) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham, MA, USA). [1‐14C]9,10‐epoxystearic acid was produced by epoxidation of [1‐14C]oleic acid with 3‐chloroperbenzoic acid (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). [1‐14C]12,13‐epoxyoctadec‐9‐enoic was enzymatically synthesized by incubating linoleic acid with recombinant CYP77A4 as described in Sauveplane et al. (CITATION). The silylating reagent N,O‐bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMS) was obtained from Pierce (Rockfold, IL, USA). NADPH was obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA). Thin layer plates (Silica Gel G60 F254; 0.25 mm) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).  The coding sequence of AtEH1 (At3g05600) was cloned by PCR from cDNA derived from Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype (L.) Heynh. Columbia‐0 flowers. AtEH1 cDNA was amplified with Phusion High‐Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France) using the following conditions: initial denaturation for 30 s at 98°C, 30 thermal cycles (15 s at 98°C, 15 s at 61°C, and 1 min 45 s at 72°C), and final extension for 5 min at 72°C. The PCR product was cloned into the pYeDP60 vector (Pompon et al., CITATION) using BamHI and KpnI restriction sites.  For translational fusion of AtEH1 with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) protein, the coding sequence was PCR‐amplified (Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix) using the following conditions: initial denaturation for 30 s at 95°C, 30 thermal cycles (15 s at 95°C, 15 s at 58°C, and 1 min 45 s at 72°C), and final extension for 5 min at 72°C with the attB‐containing primers attB1‐EH1:GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGTGGACACTAGCTTAAC and attB‐EH1:GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAATAAAAGATAAATACACTCACA; it was then cloned into the pDONR207 vector by BP clonase reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting pENTR vector was used to shuttle the AtEH1 coding sequence into the pB7WGF2 and pK7WGF3 vectors by LR clonase reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific), generating the p35S:EH1:EGFP and p35S:EGFP:EH1 expression vectors, respectively.  For expression of the full‐length AtEH1 protein, we used a yeast expression system originally developed for the expression of P450 enzymes and consisting of plasmid pYeDP60 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain WAT11 (Pompon et al., CITATION). Yeast cultures were grown and AtEH1 expression was induced as described in Pompon et al. (CITATION) from one isolated transformed colony. After growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation and manually broken with glass beads (0.45 mm diameter) in 50 mM Tris‐HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 600 mM sorbitol. The volume of buffer was proportional to the weight of the yeast pellet: 6 g was homogenized in c. 30 ml of buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10 000 g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100 000 g. Before storing at −30°C, glycerol (30%) was added to the supernatant. All procedures for cytosolic fraction preparation were carried out at between 0 and 4°C. The pellet consisting of microsomal membranes was resuspended in 50 mM Tris‐HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA and 30% (v/v) glycerol with a Potter−Elvehjem homogenizer and stored at −30°C. The volume of resuspension buffer was proportional to the weight of the yeast pellet: microsomes extracted from 6 g of yeast were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer. All procedures for microsomal preparation were carried out at between 0 and 4°C. As a positive control for microsome viability, these procedures were also performed after transformation of yeast with pYeDP60 carrying the coding sequence of CYP94C1 (Kandel et al., CITATION).  Agroinfiltrated leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana were harvested and 2 g of each sample was ground in liquid nitrogen. The resulting powder was added to 6 ml of buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris‐HCl buffer, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM ascorbic acid and 2 mM dithiothreitol) and homogenized before filtration through Miracloth (Merck, Basel, Switzerland). The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10 000 g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100 000 g. Before storing at −30°C, glycerol (30%) was added to the supernatant. The remaining microsomal pellet was resuspended in 140 μl of buffer B (250 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris‐HCl buffer, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA and 30% glycerol). All procedures for cytosolic and microsomal fraction preparation were carried out at between 0 and 4°C.  Incubations were performed in 5‐ml glass tubes (VSM, Andeville, France). Radiolabeled substrate dissolved in ethanol (10 μl of 1 mM solution) was added to the tube and then ethanol was evaporated. Resolubilization of the substrate was confirmed by measuring the radioactivity of the incubation media. Enzymatic activity of yeast‐expressed AtEH1 proteins was determined by following the formation rate of metabolites. The standard assay (0.1 ml) contained 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and radiolabeled substrate (100 μM). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the cytosolic fraction from yeast expressing AtEH1 (0.4 mg of protein) and was stopped after 10 min by the addition of 20 μl of acetonitrile (containing 0.2% acetic acid). The reaction products were resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Silica Gel G60 F254; 0.25 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as described in the next section.  Incubation medium was directly spotted on TLC plates. For separation of metabolites from residual substrate, TLC plates were developed with a mixture of diethyl ether : light petroleum (boiling point 40–60°C) : formic acid (50 : 50 : 1, v/v/v). The plates were scanned with a radioactivity detector (Raytest Rita Star, Straubenhardt, Germany). The silica corresponding to the radiolabeled metabolites were scraped with a razor blade into counting vials and quantified by liquid scintillation (Minaxi Tri‐carb 4000; Packard Instrument Co. Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA), or metabolites were eluted from the silica with 10 ml of diethyl ether, which was removed by evaporation, methylated with diazomethane, trimethylsilylated with BSTFA containing 1% (v/v) TMS (1 : 1, v/v) and subjected to GC‐MS analysis.  GC‐MS analysis was carried out on a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 Series, Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a 30‐m capillary column with an internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a film thickness of 0.25 μm (HP‐5MS). The gas chromatograph was coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973N). Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV and analyzed as previously described (Eglinton et al., CITATION).  Arabidopsis thaliana wild‐type (WT) and transgenic lines described here derive from the Columbia‐0 ecotype. Ateh1‐1 (SALK‐053239) and Ateh1‐2 (SAIL‐549A04) T‐DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Fig. S2). Plants were grown in a controlled growth chamber in standard horticultural soil with a 16 h : 8 h, light : dark regime at 19–21°C and at a relative humidity of 60–80%. For axenic cultures of A. thaliana, seeds were wetted with 70% ethanol, surface‐sterilized with a 25% commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite, rinsed three times with sterile water, and sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt medium (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) containing 1% sucrose. Plates were stored for 48 h at 4°C in the dark for stratification and then transferred to a controlled growth chamber with a 16 h 23°C : 8 h 21°C, light : dark regime.  To screen for homozygous ko (knock‐out) mutants, seeds from Ateh1‐1 and Ateh1‐2 were grown to rosette stage. Genomic DNA was extracted from rosette leaves of between 20 and 30 individual plants, and PCR was carried out to confirm homozygous plants (using primer pairs SALK‐LBb1/RT‐EH‐R and RT‐EH‐F/RT‐EH‐R and Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix in the following conditions: initial denaturation for 30 s at 95°C, 30 thermal cycles (15 s at 95°C, 15 s at 72°C, and 1 min 45 s at 72°C), and final extension for 5 min at 72°C. In order to confirm knock‐out of gene expression, 1 μg of total RNA was extracted from the homozygous plants for cDNA synthesis. Subsequently, reverse transcription−polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) (initial denaturation for 5 min at 70°C with oligo dT followed by Superscript III, and then 5 min at 25°C, 60 min at 42°C, and 15 min at 72°C) was performed to amplify the full‐length coding region of AtEH1 (primer pairs RT‐EH‐F/RT‐EH‐R; RT‐EH‐F: ATGCATGCACACAATCGCAACTA; RT‐EH‐R: CTAAAAGCTTTTGTTGTTGTCCCGAAGCTT).  To evaluate the tolerance of the Ateh1 and WT lines to osmotic stress during seed germination, seeds were sown on MS medium supplemented with 1% sucrose and 1% agar, in the absence or presence of 500 mM mannitol. The cumulative germination rate of seeds was analyzed. Three biological replicates were grown to measure percentage germination. Between 200 and 300 seeds for each replicate were examined under a microscope (Motic SMZ‐168 Series; Motic, Hong‐Kong, China).  For seed coat permeability tests, tetrazolium red dye assays were performed: dry A. thaliana seeds were incubated in an aqueous solution of 1% (w/v) tetrazolium red (2,3,5‐triphynyltetrazolium) at 30°C for 4–48 h. Seeds were rinsed in water before imaging.  For the transient overexpression of EGFP fusion proteins, expression vectors p35S:EH1:EGFP and p35S:EGFP:EH1 described earlier (in cloning procedures) were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LB4404 Hv before agroinfiltration of 4‐wk‐old N. benthamiana leaves as described previously (Bassard et al., CITATION). Constructs carrying the soluble mRFP1 marker and the viral silencing suppressor p19 (Shamloul et al., CITATION) were concurrently introduced into N. benthamiana leaves. The plasmid carrying a construct coding for the CYP51G1 40 N‐terminal amino acids (membrane anchoring sequence plus hinge linking to globular part) fused to mRFP was used as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker (Bassard et al., CITATION). Leaf disks were excised 3 d post‐infiltration for confocal observation. Live imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM780 laser scanning confocal microscope. Single section images were recorded using a Plan‐Apochromat 40×/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective lens (Bioaxial, Paris, France). EGFP and mRFP1 fluorescence was sequentially recorded using the excitation/emission wavelengths 488/495–555 nm and 561/565–615 nm, respectively.  For Western blots, proteins from the N. benthamiana cytosol or microsomes, corresponding to 25 mg fresh weight, were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) and transferred onto a PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. The unreacted sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 2 h at room temperature, then the membrane was incubated with anti‐GFP JL8 (1 : 10 000; Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), anti‐RFP 6G6 (1 : 5000; ChromoTek, Planegg, Germany) or anti‐UGPase (1 : 10 000; Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) for 2 h and with an HRP‐conjugated (horseradish peroxidase) goat secondary antibody (1 : 10 000; IBMP, Strasbourg, France) for 1 h.  Analysis of cutin monomers was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) as described previously (Jakobson et al., CITATION). Briefly, after delipidation of tissues, acid‐catalyzed transmethylation was performed and the FA methyl esters were extracted, acetylated, dried, redissolved in heptane : toluene (1 : 1, v/v) and analyzed by GC‐MS. In order to quantify cutin monomers originally containing epoxy groups, derivatized cutin monomer samples were also analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) as follows. Dried derivatized monomers were redissolved in acetonitrile : isopropanol : 10 mM ammonium formate (65 : 30 : 5, v/v/v) and separated on an Ultimate RS 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on which was mounted a Phenomenex (Atlanta, GA, USA) C18 Kinetex column (2.1 × 150 mm; 1.7 μm) and which was connected to a quadrupole‐time‐of‐flight (QTOF) 5600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a duo‐spray ion source. A binary gradient system of acetonitrile−water (60 : 40, v/v) and isopropanol−acetonitrile (90 : 10, v/v), both containing 10 mM ammonium formate, was used as eluents A and B, respectively. The elution was performed with a gradient; eluent B was increased from 7% to 97% in 26 min then maintained for 5 min; solvent B was decreased to 7% and then maintained for another 7 min for column re‐equilibration. The flow rate was 0.3 ml min−1. The column oven temperature was set at 45°C. The ion source was operated in positive mode. Epoxy monomers were identified based on mass accuracy peaks compared with theoretical masses and on the MS/MS fragment ions. Relative quantification was achieved with Multiquant software (AB Sciex) on the basis of intensity values of the ammonium adducts of the different epoxy monomers. For identification of the position of the epoxy group, delipidated cell walls obtained from 25 mg of mature seeds were incubated overnight at 25°C with 1 mg of Fusarium solani cutinase (Petersen et al., CITATION) in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and 100 mM Tris‐HCl, pH 8. The mixture was then adjusted to pH 5 and free FAs were extracted with dichloromethane, dried and redissolved in acetonitrile : isopropanol : ammonium formate 10 mM (65 : 30 : 5, v/v/v). The free FA monomers were analyzed by LC‐MS/MS in negative mode using the same LC conditions except that water–methanol (95 : 5, v/v) and methanol‐isopropanol (95 : 5, v/v), both containing ammonium formate at a final concentration of 10 mM, were used as eluents A and B, respectively.  AtEH1 homologous sequences were retrieved by BLASTp search in the Phytozome database (www.phytozome.net). Transcriptome data from the 1kP project (www.onekp.com) was also mined through tBlastn. The EH data set contains 135 sequences derived from 46 plant species. Protein sequences were handled with the Seaview 4 software (Gouy et al., CITATION) and aligned using the embedded Muscle algorithm (Edgar, CITATION). Ambiguous sites of the alignment were masked with Gblocks (Castresana, CITATION) before phylogeny reconstruction. EH trees were built with a maximum likelihood approach implemented with the PhyML3.0 software (Guindon et al., CITATION) and using the LG model (Le & Gascuel, CITATION). Both nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) and subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) methods (Hordijk & Gascuel, CITATION) were used. We tested tree branch support by running an approximate‐likelihood test (Anisimova & Gascuel, CITATION).
