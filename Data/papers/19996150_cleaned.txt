!~ABS~! Cutinase is an esterase that degrades the polyester cutin, a major component of the plant cuticle. Although cutinase activity has been detected in pollen, the genes encoding this enzyme have not been identified. Here, we report the identification and characterization of Arabidopsis CDEF1 (cuticle destructing factor 1), a novel candidate gene encoding cutinase. CDEF1 encodes a member of the GDSL lipase/esterase family of proteins, although fungal and bacterial cutinases belong to the α/β hydrolase superfamily which is different from the GDSL lipase/esterase family. According to the AtGenExpress microarray data, CDEF1 is predominantly expressed in pollen. The ectopic expression of CDEF1 driven by the 35S promoter caused fusion of organs, including leaves, stems and flowers, and increased surface permeability. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the cuticle of the transgenic plants was often disrupted and became discontinuous. Subcellular analysis with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged CDEF1 showed that the protein is secreted to the extracellular space in leaves. The recombinant CDEF1 protein has esterase activity. These results are consistent with cutinase being secreted from cells and directly degrading the polyester in the cuticle. CDEF1 promoter activity was detected in mature pollen and pollen tubes, suggesting that CDEF1 is involved in the penetration of the stigma by pollen tubes. Additionally, we found CDEF1 expression at the zone of lateral root emergence, which suggests that CDEF1 degrades cell wall components to facilitate the emergence of the lateral roots. Our findings suggest that CDEF1 is a candidate gene for the unidentified plant cutinase.
!~RES~! Expression of a fungal cutinase in A. thaliana disrupted the cuticle of the plant, leading to the fusion of various organs. (Sieber et al. CITATION). This observation suggests that the expression of cutinase in aerial parts of a plant may abolish normal cuticular development. Additionally, endogenous cutinase activity in plants has been reported only in pollen (Shayk and Kolattukudy CITATION, Maiti et al. CITATION, Hiscock et al. CITATION). These results imply that plant cutinase genes are expressed specifically in restricted plant tissues, such as pollen. To identify plant cutinases, we examined two gene families, the α/β hydrolase superfamily and the GDSL lipase/esterase family. Arabidopsis contains 327 genes of the α/β hydrolase superfamily and 111 genes of the GDSL lipase/esterase family. We constructed a heat map of gene expression profiles of the α/β hydrolase superfamily using developmental data from AtGenExpress (Schmid et al. CITATION) (Supplementary Fig. S1) and selected four genes (At2g05850, At3g52000, At3g54240 and At3g55180) that are specifically expressed in mature pollen. We also generated a heat map of gene expression profiles of the GDSL lipase/esterase family (Supplementary Fig. S2) and identified two genes (At2g19050 and At4g30140) that are specifically expressed in mature pollen. We hypothesized that the ectopic expression of a plant cutinase would cause cuticular defects, similar to those observed upon expression of the Fusarium cutinase (Sieber et al. CITATION). We cloned a cDNA for each of the candidate genes from Arabidopsis flowers, ectopically expressed the proteins in vegetative organs, and established multiple lines for each transgenic plant. We examined cuticular function using a toluidine blue (TB) test. Plants with an abnormal cuticle are readily stained with TB, because of the increased permeability of their surface (Tanaka et al. CITATION). Transgenic plants expressing At2g05850, At2g19050, At3g52000, At3g54240 or At3g55180 were not stained with TB. In contrast, transgenic plants with 35S::At4g30140 were stained strongly with TB (Fig. 1A, right): we established seven independent lines carrying 35S::At4g30140, and all these transgenic plants were stained with TB (Supplementary Fig. S3). This result suggests that these transgenic plants have a defect in the cuticle. We named At4g30140 cuticle destructing factor 1 (CDEF1) and further characterized the protein. To confirm the expression of the CDEF1 gene in leaves of the transgenic 35S::CDEF1 plant, we performed a reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) analysis. The CDEF1 gene was expressed in leaves of transgenic 35S::CDEF1 plants, but not in those of wild-type plants (Fig. 1B). We found that transgenic 35S::CDEF1 plants occasionally exhibited organ fusions (Fig. 1C, D), while wild-type plants never had fused organs (Fig. 1C). This phenotype is strongly correlated with the structural abnormalities of the cuticle (Sieber et al. CITATION, Chen et al. CITATION, Kurdyukov et al. CITATION). The organ fusions occurred in various organs, including leaves (Fig. 1E), stems (Fig. 1F) and flowers (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the cuticular structure was disordered in the organs of the transgenic 35S::CDEF1 plants. Fusions of the organs of flowers prevented normal flower development and such a fused flower did not normally develop a silique, resulting in the reduction of fertility. A similar phenotype was observed in the case of ectopic expression of Fusarium cutinase (Sieber et al. CITATION). Overall, these results suggest that the ectopic expression of CDEF1 causes the loss of cuticular integrity in vegetative organs, such as leaves, stems and flowers.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To examine the integrity of the cuticle, leaf epidermal cells of transgenic plants were examined by electron microscopy. In this analysis, we used transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)–CDEF1 fusion protein that caused cuticular defects similar to those seen in plants constitutively overexpressing CDEF1 (see Fig. 3B, C). The cuticle of wild-type plants appeared to be a smooth and continuous layer with a high electron density (Fig. 2A, B). In contrast, the cuticle of transgenic plants was often disrupted and became discontinuous. The appearance of the deformed cuticle varied among the specimens examined. The cuticle often disappeared (Fig. 2C, D). In some areas, the cuticle was torn (Fig. 2C, E–G) and cell wall materials were deposited between the torn cuticular layers (Fig. 2F, G). These observations suggest that ectopic expression of the CDEF1 gene causes disruption of the cuticle.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] A hydropathy plot analysis revealed the existence of a possible signal peptide (SP), which could sort this protein into the secretory pathway, at the N-terminus of the CDEF1 protein (Fig. 3A). To investigate the subcellular localization of CDEF1 by monitoring GFP fluorescence, the SP-GFP-CDEF1 fusion gene was expressed in Arabidopsis. The transgenic plants stained readily with TB and occasionally exhibited an organ fusion phenotype (Fig. 3B, C), indicating that GFP did not affect the localization or activity of CDEF1. GFP signals in the leaves of 14-day-old transgenic plants were detected in the extracellular space (Fig. 3D, E). This result indicates that CDEF1 is secreted and accumulates in the extracellular space. Cutinases are esterases that cleave various mono- and polyesters, including synthetic esters, and native cutin. Fig. 4 shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of CDEF1 and GLIP1, a GDSL lipase/esterase protein from Arabidopsis, which was previously reported to exhibit esterase activity (Oh et al. CITATION). This alignment revealed that CDEF1 has conserved motifs typical of the GDSL lipase/esterase family of proteins and contains the invariant residues that form the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole (Fig. 4). This result implies that CDEF1 has esterase activity.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To verify the enzymatic activity of the protein, we expressed Arabidopsis CDEF1 in suspension cultures of BY-2 tobacco cells and examined the enzymatic activity. The recombinant CDEF1 protein with a 6 × His tag at its C-terminus was efficiently expressed in BY-2 cells and secreted into the culture medium. Recombinant CDEF1 was purified with an Ni2+ affinity column and appeared as a single band on a Coomassie-stained SDS–polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5A). Purified CDEF1 exhibited esterase activity towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) (Fig. 5B) and this activity was reduced to <10% of the maximum activity by heating for 10 min at 99°C (Fig. 5B). The optimum pH of this enzyme was broad, in the range of pH 7.0–9.0, and activity slightly decreased at acidic pH values (Fig. 5C). The specific activity was determined to be 45.0 μmol min−1 mg−1 CDEF1 protein.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To analyze the expression pattern of CDEF1, we performed a promoter analysis using the GFP–CDEF1 fusion protein as a reporter. In this analysis, we used a 1,903 bp region upstream of ATG as a promoter and a 237 bp region downstream of the stop codon as a terminator. GFP signals were detected in mature pollen grains within non-dehiscent anthers (Fig. 6A–C) and in pollen tubes that were germinating on the stigma (Fig. 6D–F). Interestingly, a GFP signal was detected as a patchy pattern in primary roots (Fig. 6G–I) and in restricted regions of the primary root periderm, where lateral roots were emerging (Fig. 6J–L). These expression patterns may be correlated with the emergence of lateral roots. These results were consistent with the AtGENExpress developmental data, which showed that the CDEF1 gene is highly expressed in mature pollen and is expressed at low levels in roots (Supplementary Fig. S4).

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants were used as the wild-type plants and parent lines for all the transgenic plants established in this study. Seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol and then sown onto 0.5% (w/v) Gellan Gum or 0.9% (w/v) agar plates containing 1 × Murashige–Skoog (MS) salts, 1% sucrose, and 0.5% (w/v) MES-KOH buffer (pH 5.7). Seeds were germinated and grown at 22°C under continuous light (100 μE m−2 s−1) in a growth chamber. When necessary, the seedlings were transferred onto vermiculite for subsequent growth before the floral stem appeared. For vector construction, we sequenced at least eight independent clones of each amplified fragment. We finally picked up one clone that has the same sequence as the genome database. The coding regions of At2g05850, At2g19050, At3g52000, At3g54240, At3g55180 and At4g30140 were amplified by PCR with cDNA from flowers of Col-0 plants. The following primers were used for cloning of each gene: for At2g05850, 5′-caccatggg aaaacaacaagattggtccgt-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcagggtgtttgaggga gaggagtg-3′ (reverse); for At2g19050, 5′-caccatggccgaggcaatatt caa-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctataatcttgcaagccaag-3′ (reverse); for At3g52000, 5′-caccatgggaaaacgacaagattggtctgt-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcaggctgtttgagggagtggagtg-3′ (reverse); for At3g54240, 5′-caccatgaagaaatggttaataacaggagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttaagat gattgaggaataggcaagag-3′ (reverse); for At3g55180, 5′-caccatggtta tgtacaaagaggattatgt-3′ and 5′-tcatttttgcatagaaaaaccatcatctac-3′ (reverse); for At4g30140 (CDEF1), 5′-caccatggtcgagggagagtccaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttaattcactaactgggatatgttgaacgg-3′ (reverse). The fragment encoding SP-GFP-(ΔSP)At4g30140 was generated by overlapping PCR, as follows. In the first PCR, two fragments encoding SP-GFP and At4g30140 without the SP [(ΔSP) At4g30140] were amplified separately. These fragments were then fused in a second PCR. The following primers were used for the overlapping PCR: for SP-GFP, 5′-caccatggccagactcacaa gcat-3′ (forward) and 5′-gcgtttgctgtccgccaccgagatctccct-3′ (reverse); for (ΔSP)At4g30140, 5′-cggtggcggacagcaaacgccgtgtt actt-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttaattcactaactgggatatgttgaacgg-3′ (reverse); for the second PCR, 5′-caccatggccagactcacaagcat-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttaattcactaactgggatatgttgaacgg-3′ (reverse). The amplified fragments were inserted into pENTER/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to produce the entry clones. We performed L/R recombination reactions to transfer the fragments of the entry clones into the destination vector pH2GW7 or pB2GW7 (Karimi et al. CITATION) for expression driven by the 35S promoter. The At4g30140 promoter (−1,903 to −1 bp upstream of At4g30140) and terminator (+1 to +237 bp downstream of At4g30140) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Col-0 plants. We performed overlapping PCRs to generate the fragment encoding At4g30140 promoter::SP-GFP-(ΔSP)At4g30140:At4g30140 terminator. The At4g30140 promoter, SP-GFP-(ΔSP)At4g30140 fragment and At4g30140 terminator were amplified in the first PCR. Then, the three PCR products were fused in a second PCR. The following primers were used for the overlapping PCR: for At4g30140 promoter, 5′-ccggaattcccaccctttcaagttccaaaattgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtctggccattccctcg accatttttcgca-3′ (reverse); for SP-GFP-(ΔSP)At4g30140, 5′-ggtcga gggaatggccagactcacaagcat-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttaattcactaactgg gatatgttgaacgg-3′ (reverse); for At4g30140 terminator, 5′-aatta gggctctattccattg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ccggaattccaactttgtatatagaatcggcaag-3′ (reverse); for the second PCR, 5′-ccggaattcccaccctttcaagttccaaaattgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ccggaattccaactttgtatatagaatcggcaag-3′ (reverse). The amplified fragment and pENTER 1A (Invitrogen) were digested at the EcoRI site and ligated using a DNA Ligation Kit ver. 2 (TAKARA BIO INC., Shiga, Japan) to produce an entry clone. The entry clone fragment was transferred into the destination vector pHGW (Karimi et al. CITATION) by the L/R reaction. The expression vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101) by electroporation. Wild-type plants were transformed with the A. tumefaciens by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION). T1 seeds were selected in a medium containing 25 mg l−1 hygromycin (for T1 seeds carrying pHGW or pH2GW7) or 15 mg l−1 BASTA (for T1 seeds carrying pB2GW7) to establish independent transgenic lines. The deduced coding sequence of each gene and the promoter sequence of At4g30140 were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). The lists of annotated genes from the α/β hydrolase superfamily (SUPERFAMILY: SSF53474) and GDSL lipase/esterase family (Pfam: PF00657) were obtained using the Bulk Data Retrieval tool in TAIR. We used the developmental data of AtGenExpress (Schmid et al. CITATION) to analyze the tissue specificity of gene expression. Heat maps of the expression patterns were made using the TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer (MEV) v3.1. Aerial parts of plants were stained at room temperature for 30 s in 0.05% TB solution (Tanaka et al. CITATION). The samples were rinsed with water before being photographed. To observe GFP fluorescence and chloroplast autofluorescence, we used a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 543 nm, emitted from a 40 mW Ar/Kr laser, and the appropriate emission filters (BP 505–530 and LP 505). We used an oil-immersion objective [Plan-Neofluar 100 × 1.3 numerical aperture (NA)] and dry objectives (40 × 0.95 NA, 20 × 0.80 NA, 10 × 0.50 NA) to view the samples. Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 21-day-old plants or flowers using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Contaminating genomic DNA was digested by incubation with DNase I at 30°C for 15 min. DNase I was inactivated by the addition of EDTA and by incubation at 65°C for 30 min. A 200 ng aliquot of total RNA was subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan) with an oligo(dT)12–18 primer. PCR was performed using the cDNAs and ExTaq polymerase (TAKARA BIO INC.). The following primers were used for PCR: for CDEF1, 5′-atggtcgagggagagtccaaggc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gacgacgagctag agtaggaggcg-3′ (reverse); for ACTIN, 5′-ggcgatgaagctcaatccaaa cg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggtcacgaccagcaagatcaagacg-3′ (reverse). Recombinant CDEF1 was expressed using the tomato mosaic virus infection system, essentially according to previous reports (Dohi et al. CITATION, Dohi et al. CITATION). Briefly, a saturated transgenic BY2 tobacco cell culture was diluted 1 : 100 in fresh medium, and β-estradiol was added to the culture to a final concentration of 10 μM at 2 d post-subculture. After a further 3 d incubation period, the cell culture was centrifuged for 3 min at 800 r.p.m. and the supernatant, containing secreted recombinant protein, was collected. The recombinant protein was purified and concentrated on an Ni2+ affinity column. The imidazole was then removed by dialysis. Leaves of wild-type and transgenic 35S::SP-GFP-CDEF1 plants were vacuum infiltrated with a fixative for 1 h, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and were examined with a transmission electron microscope (model 1200EX, JEOL). Esterase activity was determined in a continuous spectrophotometric assay, using pNPB as a substrate. The activity was measured in a solution (200 μl) containing appropriate buffers (50 mM), pNPB (1 mM) and the enzyme (31.5 ng) at 30°C. The buffers used for each pH were Na-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5), HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5, 8.0) and Tricine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0, 8.5, 9.0). The hydrolysis of pNPB was spectrophotometrically monitored for the formation of p-nitrophenol at 405 nm. We obtained a T-DNA insertion line (SALK_014093) which carries a T-DNA insertion in the coding region of CDEF1 from the ABRC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) at Ohio State University. We isolated a homozygous mutant line by genotyping and designated it as cdef1. The following primers were used for PCR-based genotyping: for detection of the intact CDEF1 gene, 5′-ttgttttggatcggattcaag-3′ (forward) and 5′-aaattacatgacaattcttcagcttaac-3′ (reverse); and for detection of the T-DNA insertion in the CDEF1 gene, 5′-tggttcacgtagt gggccatcg-3′ (forward) and 5′-aaattacatgacaattcttcagcttaac-3′ (reverse).
