!~ABS~! This study of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) nitrate transporters NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 reveals how the interplay between xylem and phloem transport of nitrate ensures optimal nitrate distribution in leaves for plant growth. Functional analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that both NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are low-affinity nitrate transporters. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis showed higher expression of these two genes in larger expanded leaves. Green fluorescent protein and β-glucuronidase reporter analyses indicated that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are plasma membrane transporters expressed in the companion cells of the major vein. In nrt1.11 nrt1.12 double mutants, more root-fed 15NO3− was translocated to mature and larger expanded leaves but less to the youngest tissues, suggesting that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are required for transferring root-derived nitrate into phloem in the major veins of mature and larger expanded leaves for redistributing to the youngest tissues. Distinct from the wild type, nrt1.11 nrt1.12 double mutants show no increase of plant growth at high nitrate supply. These data suggested that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer for redistributing nitrate into developing leaves, and such nitrate redistribution is a critical step for optimal plant growth enhanced by increasing external nitrate.
!~RES~! NRT1.11 and NRT1.12, similar to NRT1.6, NRT1.7, and NRT1.9, are in subgroup IV of the Arabidopsis NRT1/PTR family (CITATION). NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 share 78.7% amino acid sequence identity. Nitrate transporters characterized in the NRT1/PTR family are low-affinity nitrate transporters, except CHL1, which is a dual-affinity nitrate transporter. The high- and low-affinity nitrate uptake activities of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 were assessed by analyzing 15NO3− uptake activity of complementary RNA (cRNA)-injected oocytes at 10 mm and 250 μm, respectively. Compared with the water-injected control, CHL1 cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes showed enhanced 15NO3− uptake activities at both 10 mm and 250 μm, while NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 cRNA-injected oocytes only exhibited enhanced uptake at 10 mm but not at 250 μm (Fig. 1). As expected for proton-coupled transporters, 10 mm nitrate uptake activities of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 cRNA-injected oocytes at pH 7.4 were 54% and 48% lower than those at pH 5.5, respectively (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are low-affinity nitrate transporters and that nitrate transport is pH dependent. [[FIGURE]] Nitrate transport activities of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 were further confirmed by electrophysiological analysis of cRNA-injected oocytes. As shown in Figure 2A, inward currents were elicited by 10 mm nitrate in both NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 cRNA-injected oocytes, suggesting that they are electrogenic transporters. Some members of the NRT1/PTR family could transport dipeptides/tripeptides (CITATION; CITATION). To test whether NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 could transport dipeptides, electrophysiological analyses of cRNA-injected oocytes exposed to Gly-Gly and Leu-Leu were performed. No significant current differences were detected among NRT1.11-, NRT1.12-, and water-injected oocytes when incubated with Gly-Gly and Leu-Leu. These results suggest that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are nitrate transporters but not dipeptide transporters. [[FIGURE]] To determine the affinity of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 for nitrate, current elicited by different concentrations of nitrate was recorded and calculated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Km values of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are approximately 7.2 and 9.2 mm, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C), confirming that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are low-affinity nitrate transporters. Expression levels of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 in 9-d-old seedlings grown with different nitrogen sources, such as potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, or ammonium succinate, were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 3, A and B, NRT1.11 was mainly expressed in the shoot, while NRT1.12 was expressed in both shoot and root. In the shoot, the expression levels of NRT1.11 were about 4-fold higher than in NRT1.12. The expression levels of these two genes showed no significant difference in three different nitrogen-supplemented media, suggesting that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 expression is not affected by nitrogen sources. [[FIGURE]] Since the dominant gene, NRT1.11, is mainly expressed in shoot, the expression of these two genes in different leaves of 21-d-old plants was further analyzed. NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 expression was developmentally regulated, with the transcript level increasing from leaf 1 to leaf 5, reaching the maximal level in leaf 5 or 6, and then declining in younger leaves (Fig. 3C). The expression levels of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 in different leaves were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Consistently, the NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 protein levels in 21-d-old plants were higher in leaf 5 and leaf 6 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 expression levels are more abundant in larger expanded leaves. To find out where NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 were expressed in actively growing leaves, the 1.6-kb upstream region of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 was used to drive the expression of the GUS reporter gene and transformed into wild-type Columbia (Col-0) plants. In five independent transgenic lines for each gene, GUS staining in shoot was mainly found in major veins (a representative line is shown in Fig. 4, A and B). This tissue-specific expression pattern was identical in plants grown at different nitrate concentrations (Supplemental Fig. S1A). This expression pattern was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the petiole, midrib, and lamina. As shown in Supplemental Figure S2, the expression levels in the petiole and the midrib were approximately 30 times higher for NRT1.11 and four times higher for NRT1.12 than their respective levels in lamina. After bolting, in addition to the major vein of rosette leaves, the expression of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 could also be found in the major vein of cauline leaves, the junction of silique and pedicel, and the apex of silique (Supplemental Fig. S1B). [[FIGURE]] Cross sections of GUS-stained petiole revealed that GUS signals were restricted to the phloem side of the vascular tissues (Fig. 4, C and D). To confirm the expression of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 in phloem, transgenic plants expressing fusion protein NRT1.11-GFP or NRT1.12-GFP driven by their native promoters were generated. As shown in Figure 4, E and F, consistent with the GUS staining pattern, NRT1.11-GFP and NRT1.12-GFP were located in the phloem of the major vein. In Figure 4, G and H, when sieve plates were revealed by aniline blue staining, the sieve elements can be recognized by the presence of sieve plates, and NRT1.11-GFP and NRT1.12-GFP signals were detected in the cells next to sieve elements and with similar end positions to the sieve elements, suggesting that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 were expressed in companion cells. To investigate the subcellular localization of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12, NRT1.11-GFP and NRT1.12-GFP driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast. The NRT1.11-GFP and NRT1.12-GFP signals were found to be confined to a ring external to the chloroplasts (Fig. 5, A, B, D, and E), while the GFP control was seen in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, G and H). These results suggest that both NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are localized in the plasma membrane. [[FIGURE]] To determine the in vivo functions of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12, two independent transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants in the Col-0 ecotype were isolated for each gene (Fig. 6A). In the nrt1.11-1 and nrt1.11-2 mutants, the T-DNA was inserted in the fourth exon and the second intron of NRT1.11, respectively. In the nrt1.12-1 and nrt1.12-2 mutants, the T-DNA was inserted in the second intron of NRT1.12. The T-DNA insertion was confirmed by genomic DNA PCR. Moreover, NRT1.11 or NRT1.12 protein could not be detected in the mutants by immunoblot analysis using NRT1.11- or NRT1.12-specific antibody (Fig. 6B), suggesting that they are null mutants. In addition, nrt1.11-1 nrt1.12-1 and nrt1.11-2 nrt1.12-2 double mutants were generated by crossing single mutants. [[FIGURE]] For the 15NO3− allocation assay, 15NO3− was fed to the root of wild-type (Col-0) and mutant plants for 30 min, and then the 15N enrichment in individual leaves was analyzed. Compared with the wild type, no significant differences of the 15N enrichment were found in nrt1.11 and nrt1.12 single mutants (Supplemental Fig. S3). However, as shown in Figure 7A, 15N enrichment was higher in leaves 1 to 7 of nrt1.11-1 nrt1.12-1 double mutants than in wild-type plants. Despite no statistical significance, 15N enrichment in leaf 8 and the shoot apical meristem, including emerging leaves and leaf primordium, of nrt1.11-1 nrt1.12-1 double mutants was slightly lower than in the wild type. To further elucidate the relative amount of 15N transported to larger expanded leaves versus the youngest tissues, the 15N enrichment ratios of leaf 8 and shoot apical meristem to leaf 6 were calculated and are shown in Figure 7B. In the nrt1.11-1 nrt1.12-1 double mutant, the ratios were lower than in the wild type. Similar results were found in another double mutant, nrt1.11-2 nrt1.12-2 (Fig. 7, C and D). When the data for the 15N enrichment presented in Figure 7, A and C, were recalculated and converted, absolute value (μmol g−1 tissue; Supplemental Fig. S4, A and B) or relative 15N distribution in different leaves (Supplemental Fig. S4, C and D) showed a similar pattern of higher values in the mature leaves of the double mutants but lower values in the younger tissues of the double mutants. The nitrate uptake activity and shoot-to-root 15N ratio between the wild type and nrt1.11 nrt1.12 double mutants showed no significant differences (Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that the increases of 15N in the mature leaves are not due to the enhanced uptake or the increased nitrate transport to shoot in the nrt1.11 nrt1.12 double mutant. These results supported the functional redundancy between NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 and showed that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 work together to reduce the amount of nitrate transported to mature and larger expanded leaves but enhance the amount of nitrate allocated to the youngest tissues. [[FIGURE]] To further confirm the contribution of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 in regulating nitrate allocation into the youngest leaf, nitrate content analysis was performed. In this experiment, residual nitrate in the leaves was first depleted by growing plants in the nitrate-free medium for 3 d. In addition, the nitrate reductase inhibitor tungstate was added to repress the rapid nitrate reduction in the leaf. As shown in Figure 8, nitrate concentration change in the youngest leaf of the nrt1.11 nrt1.12 double mutant after shifting to nitrate-containing medium for 2 h was lower than in the wild type. This result together with the 15N distribution experiments supported that NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 are involved in nitrate allocation to the youngest leaf. [[FIGURE]] We next examined whether the loss of NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 has any effect on leaf growth by measuring the dry weights of individual true leaves in double mutants. As shown in Figure 9A, increases of nitrate concentration from 0.2 mm to 1 or 5 mm were associated with increased growth in the wild type, particularly in younger leaves, leaf 4 and up. However, in nrt1.11 nrt1.12 double mutants, no increase of the growth of younger leaves was observed when the nitrate concentrations were increased (Fig. 9, B and C). These results suggest that nitrate redistribution mediated by NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 is important for enhancing the growth of younger leaves at high nitrate concentrations. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! NRT1.11 or NRT1.12 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primer pairs NRT1.11 forward (5′-cccggatccATGGAGAACCCTCCCAATGAAAC-3′) with BamHI site and NRT1.11 reverse (5′-ccccccgggCAAGCTTGCAAGACCTATTGTTCC-3′) with XmaI site or NRT1.12 forward (5′-cccggatccATGGAGACCCTCCGGA-3′) with BamHI site and NRT1.12 reverse (5′-cccggatccCCTAAGAAAATCCAAATCCATGA-3′) with BamHI site, respectively. Lowercase letters indicate nonspecific nucleotides, and underlined letters indicate where restriction sites were created. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). After sequencing, NRT1.11 and NRT1.12 cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the oocyte expression vector pGEM-HE (CITATION), respectively. The pGEM-HE NRT1.11 and pGEM-HE NRT1.12 plasmids were linearized using NheI, and capped mRNA was transcribed in vitro by using mMESSAGE mMACHINE kits (Ambion). Oocytes were isolated and injected with 100 ng of NRT1.11 or NRT1.12 cRNA in 50 nL of water, as described previously (CITATION), except that the Barth solution was replaced with ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After 2 d of incubation in the ND96 solution containing 0.005% (w/v) gentamycin, nitrate uptake assays using [15N]nitrate were performed as described previously using a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a carbon nitrogen elemental analyzer (ANCA-GSL MS; PDZ Europa; CITATION; CITATION). CHL1 cRNA and water-injected oocytes were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Electrophysiological analyses of injected oocytes were performed as described previously (CITATION), except that the CsNO3 was replaced with HNO3. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild-type control. The Arabidopsis T-DNA mutants nrt1.11-1 (SALK_099498), nrt1.11-2 (SALK_065633), nrt1.12-1 (SALK_013091), and nrt1.12-2 (SAIL_270_A08) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://abrc.osu.edu/; CITATION; CITATION). The T-DNA insertions were confirmed by genomic PCR using left border primers LBa1 (5′-TCAAACAGGATTTTCGCCTGC-3′) for SALK lines or LB3 (5′-TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCGATACAC-3′) for the SAIL line and paired with gene-specific primers as follows: nrt1.11-1 (forward, 5′-TCTGAAATCAAAGCTCCAAGTCAAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTTAATAACACCACACACCAATGCAATA-5′); nrt1.11-2 (forward, 5′-ACTTCCTCTTCTTCTTCCTCTTCCTTTTT-3′; reverse, 5′-AAAACCTCGTACCACCATCCTTCA-3′); nrt1.12-1 and nrt1.12-2 (forward, 5′-ATGGAGAACCCTCCGGATCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGTAGATGTCTTCCAAAAAAAG-3′). The nrt1.11-1 nrt1.12-1 and nrt1.11-2 nrt1.12-2 double mutants were generated by crossing the indicated single mutants. For analyzing gene expression in three different nitrogen-containing media, Col-0 plants were grown under continuous light conditions on a vertical plate containing 10 mm KNO3, 5 mm NH4NO3, or 5 mm (NH4)2-succinate with 10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, basal nutrient (2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm FeSO4-EDTA, 50 μm H3BO3, 12 μm MnSO4·2H2O, 1 μm ZnCl2, 1 μm CuSO4·5H2O, and 0.2 μm NaMoO4·2H2O), 0.1% (w/v) MES, 0.5% (w/v) Suc, and 0.45% (w/v) agarose, at pH 5.5 (adjusted with KOH). The nutrient solutions used for hydroponic cultivation contained different concentrations of KNO3 or NH4NO3 with 1 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, the basal nutrient indicated above, and 0.1% (w/v) MES, at pH 5.5 (adjusted with KOH). Seeds were germinated on rockwool in one-tenth-diluted nutrient solution under long-day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of dark, 65 µmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetic photon flux density) at 23°C using an Araponics growing system. After 3 d, full-strength nutrient solution was applied and renewed twice per week. The light intensity was measured using an LI-250A light meter with an LI-190SA quantum sensor (LI-COR). Total RNA was extracted from roots, shoots, or different leaves using TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega). Primers specific for the NRT1.11, NRT1.12, or UBQ10 gene were designed by Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed with the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) programmed for 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The primers used were as follows: NRT1.11 (forward, 5′-TACTCGCGATAATGAGCTTCATCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCTCTCACACCATTAACCCTACCA-3′), NRT1.12 (forward, 5′-TATGCACAACGGACCAAGTTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGTTCTGGCTAACGTTTATCGACA-3′), and UBQ10 (forward, 5′-AGAAGTTCAATGTTTCGTTTCATGTAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAACGGAAACATAGTAGAACACTTATTCA-3′). The relative amount of gene expression was determined by the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method using UBQ10 as an internal control. The mean values were averages of 2−ΔCt × 100 (ΔCT = CT, gene of interest − CT, UBQ10) from three biological repeats. The anti-NRT1.11 and anti-NRT1.12 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated and purified using synthetic peptide NETEAKQIQTNEGKKTKC for NRT1.11 or DQTESKETLQQPITRRRTKC for NRT1.12 by LTK BioLaboratories (http://www.ltk.com.tw). Underlined amino acids are specific epitopes corresponding to residues 6 to 22 for NRT1.11 and residues 6 to 24 for NRT1.12. The Cys residue at the C terminus was added to facilitate antibody purification. To isolate total protein, tissues were homogenized in ice-cold extraction buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000g for 15 min, and the supernatant, the total protein, was collected in a chilled tube. The concentration of total protein was determined by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). For immunoblot analysis, 30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Detections were performed using the Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare). Anti-NRT1.11, anti-NRT1.12, anti-histone H3 (ab1791; Abcam), and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (NA934; GE Healthcare) were used at dilutions of 1:1,000, 1:1,000, 1:2,000, and 1:5,000, respectively. Signals were detected by Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) and quantified by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). A 1.56-kb genomic fragment of the NRT1.11 promoter (−1,566 to −1 bp) or a 1.59-kb genomic fragment of the NRT1.12 promoter (−1,593 to −1 bp) was generated by PCR using the primers NRT1.11 forward (5′-aagtccATACAGTTAATCGACAATGT-3′) with HindIII site and NRT1.11 reverse (5′-ggatccTGTTGAATGTGATTTGATCA-3′) with BamHI site or NRT1.12 forward (5′-ggatccAGCCTGTAGGATATAGAATCACAAA-3′) with BamHI site and NRT1.12 reverse (5′-ggatccTGTTGTTACCTTTCAAGCTTCGA-3′) with BamHI site. Lowercase letters indicate nonspecific nucleotides, and underlined letters indicate where restriction sites were created. After sequencing, the fragments were cloned in front of the uidA (GUS) gene in the binary vector pBI101.1. The binary vectors were introduced into wild-type (Col-0) plants using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101)-mediated floral dip method (CITATION). Putative transformants were selected on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog plates containing 0.005% (w/v) kanamycin. GUS staining was performed using the protocol described by CITATION with some modification. The 21-d-old homozygous transgenic plants (T3), cultivated hydroponically with 1 mm NH4NO3 as described previously, were vacuum infiltrated in prefix solution (0.5% [v/v] formaldehyde, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and incubated in prefix solution at room temperature for 1.5 h. After three rinses with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, the NRT1.11pro-GUS transgenic plants and the NRT1.12pro-GUS transgenic plants were incubated for 2.5 and 4.5 h, respectively, at 37°C in X-Gluc staining solution (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100, 1 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-glucuronide). After three washes with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, the seedlings were fixed in 2% (v/v) formaldehyde, 0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at room temperature overnight. Tissues were cleared through a graded ethanol serious in order to remove pigments. The whole-seedling images were taken by a Nikon D80 digital camera with a Sigma 18- to 50-mm F2.8 EX DC Macro lens. For sections, the stained petioles were further dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol washes and embedded in LR White medium-grade acrylic resin (London Resin). Then, 6-μm semifine sections were cut, mounted on glass slides, and visualized on an AxioImager-Z1 (Zeiss). A 6.06-kb genomic fragment of NRT1.11, including the 2.06-kb upstream region of the translation start site and 4.00 kb of the coding region, or a 5.48-kb genomic fragment of NRT1.12, including the 2.02-kb upstream region of the translation start site and 3.48 kb of the coding region, was amplified from wild-type (Col-0) genomic DNA by PCR using the NRT1.11 forward primer 5′-ggtaccGAGCTATGCATTTTCTTGTGATATT-3′ with KpnI site and the NRT1.11 reverse primer 5′-ggtaccATTGGTTTTAACAACTGGACTTAGAT-3′ with KpnI site or the NRT1.12 forward primer 5′-ggtaccCATCATTATGGCTTTTTATTCACTT-3′ with KpnI site and the NRT1.12 reverse primer 5′-ggtaccGTTTAATTTAATAACTTCCTCTTCTTCTTT-3′ with KpnI site. Lowercase letters indicate nonspecific nucleotides, and underlined letters indicate where restriction sites were created. After sequencing, the NRT1.11pro:NRT1.11-GFP fragment or the NRT1.12pro:NRT1.12-GFP fragment was cloned in frame with GFP in the binary vector pMDC107 (CITATION) at the KpnI site in the right orientation. The pMDC107 NRT1.11pro:NRT1.11-GFP plasmids and the pMDC107 NRT1.12pro:NRT1.12-GFP plasmids were introduced into nrt1.11-1 and nrt1.12-1 mutant plants, respectively, using the A. tumefaciens (strain GV3101)-mediated floral dip method (CITATION). Putative transformants were selected on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog plates containing 0.0025% (w/v) hygromycin B using the methods described previously (CITATION). For NRT1.11-GFP and NRT1.12-GFP protein observation, the leaf 5 or 6 petioles of 21-d-old plants grown hydroponically with 1 mm NH4NO3 as described previously were embedded in 5% (w/v) agarose dissolved in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and cut into 120-μm sections with a Vibratome Series 1000 (Technical Products International). Sieve plates were stained with 0.05% aniline blue in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 5 to 10 min. The slices of agarose were mounted on slides before observation using a confocal Zeiss LSM780 microscope. Green fluorescence was visualized with excitation at 488 nm and a band-pass filter of 480 to 540 nm. Aniline blue fluorescence was visualized with excitation at 405 nm and a band-pass filter of 490 to 570 nm. NRT1.11 or NRT1.12 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the NRT1.11 forward primer 5′-ggatccATGGAGAACCCTCCCAA-3′ with BamHI site and the NRT1.11 reverse primer 5′-ggatccAATTGGTTTTAACAACTGGA-3′ with BamHI site or the NRT1.12 forward primer 5′-ggatccATGGAGAACCCTCCGGATCA-3′ with BamHI site and the NRT1.12 reverse primer 5′-ggatccAGTTTAATTTAATAACTTCCTCT-3′ with BamHI site. Lowercase letters indicate nonspecific nucleotides, and underlined letters indicate where restriction sites were created. The amplified fragments were then cloned in frame with GFP in the vector 326-GFP (CITATION) at the BamHI site, resulting in the NRT1.11-GFP or NRT1.12-GFP construct under the control of the 35S promoter. The fusion construct or the vector 326-GFP was then transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Arabidopsis protoplast transformation was performed following the protocol described by CITATION. Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated from leaf tissues of 3- to 4-week-old plants grown on soil. GFP-fused plasmids isolated by the Qiagen plasmid kit were transformed into protoplasts. After incubation in W5 solution under light for 16 to 24 h, fluorescent cells were imaged as described by CITATION. Plants were grown hydroponically with 1 mm NH4NO3 for 21 d. At 8 h into the photoperiod, plants were transferred to 5 mm KNO3 hydroponic medium containing a 9.8% excess of 15N for 30 min, and then individual leaves were collected. 15N abundance in each leaf was analyzed as described previously using a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a carbon nitrogen elemental analyzer (ANCA-GSL MS; PDZ Europa; CITATION). The 15N abundance was calculated as atom percent and defined as (15N)⁄(15N + 14N) × 100%. The 15N enrichment was calculated as 15N abundance in labeled leaf minus 15N abundance in nonlabeled leaf. Leaves were frozen in liquid N2 and dried by lyophilization. After measuring the dry weight, nitrate in the leaves was extracted by boiling in distilled water for 30 min. Nitrate concentration was then determined by HPLC (CITATION) using a PARTISIL 10 strong anion exchanger column (Whatman), with 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 3.0, as the mobile phase. Leaf phloem exudates were collected from excised leaves using procedures modified from a protocol described previously (CITATION). Cut leaves were immediately recut at the tip of the petiole under exudate buffer (2.5 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.5, osmotically adjusted to 230 mosmol with sorbitol) with fresh razor blades without wounding. The cut leaves were rinsed once in the fresh exudation buffer to remove contaminants and then placed in 200 μL of new exudate buffer. During phloem sap exudation, the leaves were illuminated (30 μE) and incubated in a humid and CO2-saturated box. After 2 h of bleeding, the buffer solution containing phloem exudates was analyzed for nitrate and sugar content as described (CITATION). The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative numbers for the genes mentioned in this article are as follows: NRT1.11 (At1g52190), NRT1.12 (At3g16180), CHL1 (At1g12110), NRT1.2 (At1g69850), NRT1.5 (At1g32450), NRT1.6 (At1g27080), NRT1.7 (At1g69870), NRT1.8 (At4g21680), NRT1.9 (At1g18880), NRT2.1 (At1g08090), NRT2.2 (At1g08100), NRT2.4 (At5g60770), SLAC1 (At1g12480), CLCa (At5g40890), AAP2 (At5g09220), NIP6;1 (At1g80760), and UBQ10 (At4g05320).
