!~ABS~! We investigated the fourth subgroup of Arabidopsis aquaporin, small and basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs). When they were expressed in yeast, SIP1;1 and SIP1;2, but not SIP2;1, gave water-channel activity. The transient expression of SIPs linked with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells and the subcellular fractionation of the tissue homogenate showed their ER localization. The SIP proteins were detected in all of the tissues, except for dry seeds. Histochemical analysis of promoter-β-glucuronidase fusions revealed the cell-specific expression of SIPs. SIP1;1 and SIP1;2 may function as water channels in the ER, while SIP2;1 might act as an ER channel for other small molecules or ions.
!~RES~! Arabidopsis SIP1;1, SIP1;2 and SIP2;1 have 240, 243 and 237 amino acid residues, respectively. SIP1;1 and SIP1;2 share 69.6% identity. SIP1;1 and SIP2;1, and SIP1;2 and SIP2;1 are 25.7% and 25.3% identical, respectively. To express SIP aquaporins in yeast, we prepared three constructs ( [fig1] A) and transformed them into S. cerevisiae strain BJ5458, which lacks endogenous functional aquaporin [bib25] . To detect the translation products in the yeast transformants, we prepared antibodies against an internal segment of SIP1;1 and the C-terminal region of SIP2;1. Antibody to SIP1;1 recognized both SIP1;1 and SIP1;2, and was named anti-SIP1s. Anti-SIP2;1 recognizes its own antigen but not SIP1s (data not shown). Each SIP protein was detected as a band of around 27 kDa in yeast crude membrane fractions ( [fig1] B). Immunocompetition with the corresponding peptide confirmed the specificity of the antibodies. The SIP proteins were examined in a large-scale preparation of yeast membranes ( [fig2] A). Two immunostained bands corresponding to the monomeric (30 kDa) and dimeric (55 kDa) forms of radish aquaporin RsPIP2;2 were seen after SDS–PAGE despite the presence of detergent; however, SIP1s and SIP2;1 gave only single monomer bands. The empty vector gave no reactive band. Membrane vesicles prepared from the yeast cells expressing SIPs were assayed for osmotic water channels by stopped-flow light-scattering spectrophotometry. The swelling rate of vesicles in the hypotonic solution was monitored by the decrease in light scattering. The vector control showed a slow influx of water into the membrane vesicles ( [fig2] B and C). SIP1;1 and SIP1;2 enhanced the permeability by 170% and 200%, respectively, while radish aquaporin RsPIP2;2 showed the highest activity [bib25] . By contrast, SIP2;1 did not enhance the permeability. This effect was not due to the absence of SIP2;1 in the membranes, as its presence was confirmed by immunoblotting ( [fig2] A). In order to determine their subcellular location, we prepared six fusion constructs of the SIPs with GFP ( [fig3] ). These constructs were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, because they are efficiently transformed by the polyethylene glycol method [bib26] . With both the GFP–SIP1;1 and SIP1;1–GFP constructs ( [fig3] A and B), the green fluorescence pattern had a tubular/reticular shape in the cells, whereas the fluorescence of free GFP was dispersed throughout the cytosol ( [fig3] I). The fluorescence patterns of SIP1;2 and SIP2;1 tagged with GFP at both the N- or C-termini also had tubular/reticular/sheet shapes ( [fig3] C–F). This shape is typical of the plant ER, especially in suspension-cultured cells [bib27] . In a similar experimental system, AtSec22 and AtSYP81 were shown to be localized to the ER membrane [bib26] ; the fluorescence patterns of the GFP-tagged SIPs were identical to those of AtSec22 and AtSYP81 ( [fig3] G and H). The present results therefore strongly suggest that the three SIP isoforms are located in the ER membrane. To examine the subcellular location of SIP proteins without tags, crude membrane fractions were prepared from homogenates of the stems of 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants and subjected to equilibrium sucrose-density gradient centrifugation ( [fig4] ). Plasma-membrane H + -ATPase (AHA3) was recovered in fractions 15–17. The subunit-a of vacuolar H + -ATPase (VHA-a) was detected in fractions 3–8. In the presence of Mg 2+ ( [fig4] A), SIP1 and SIP2;1 were recovered in fractions 11–16, together with the ER luminal protein BiP. When the membrane-bound ribosomes were removed from the rough ER by treatment with EDTA ( [fig4] B), the SIP peak moved to lower-density fractions 4–10, as did the BiP peak. The release of ribosomal proteins, such as L13 and S13, by the treatment with EDTA was confirmed by immunoblotting with their antibodies (data not shown). These results support the ER localization of the SIP proteins. We quantified the relative amounts of SIP proteins in various organs immunochemically, as shown in [fig5] . Both SIP1;1 and SIP1;2 were detected in all of the organs, except for in dry seeds. Substantial levels of SIP2;1 protein were present in the membranes of 2-week-old roots and in the flowers. Germinating seedlings contained SIP1s and SIP2;1, but no signal for the SIPs was detected in the dry seeds. The levels of PIP1 and TIP1 in the various organs were similar to those in the radish plant [bib22] . It should be noted that the suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells (Deep cells), which were used for expression of GFP–SIP fusion proteins, accumulated SIPs and SIP2;1, but not PIP1s or TIP1;1. We performed promoter-GUS analysis of the three SIP genes in order to examine their tissue-specific expression. Constructs containing the putative promoter regions (about 2 kb in length) were fused in-frame with the GUS gene. Arabidopsis plants were grown for 2 weeks and stained for GUS. The pattern of GUS staining varied with the isogenes. There was strong GUS activity from the SIP1;1 construct in the roots and rosette leaves ( [fig6] A). Within the latter, activity was especially high in trichome cells ( [fig6] B and C). GUS activity from SIP1;2 was observed particularly in the cotyledons ( [fig6] H), as well as in the minor veins and hydathode cells of the rosette leaves ( [fig6] I and J). Strong staining was also observed in the cotyledons of plantlets expressing the SIP2;1::GUS construct ( [fig6] O). In contrast to SIP1;2, this construct gave rise to strong activity in the main veins of the rosette leaves ( [fig6] P). For roots, GUS activity was especially high in the dividing cells and elongating regions of the root tips ( [fig6] D, K and Q), and in the emerging lateral roots ( [fig6] R). GUS activity was, in all cases, detected in the stele, which is the central vascular cylinder of the roots (for example, see [fig6] R). GUS activities in the flowers and siliques prepared from 7-week-old plants are also shown. For SIP1;1 ( [fig6] E and F), strong GUS activity was detected in the vascular tissues of the flower petal, stigma, stamens (anthers and filaments) and pollen. In the siliques, the top and bottom (receptacle) were also strongly stained ( [fig6] G). For SIP2;1 ( [fig6] S–U), the same tissues were stained, although the intensity was weaker than for SIP1;1. In contrast to these two genes, weak GUS activity from SIP1;2 was detected in the filaments of the stamens, the upper part of the styles, the vascular tissue of the petals, and the receptacles of the siliques, but not in the anthers or pollen ( [fig6] L–N).
!~MM~! Seeds of Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia 0 were germinated on sterile MS-salt plates and grown at 22 °C under continuous light. In some cases, plants germinated on agar plates were grown in vermiculite pots under continuous light. Arabidopsis (Columbia 0) suspension-cultured cells (also known as ‘Deep’ cells) were a kind gift from Dr. Masaaki Umeda of Tokyo University, Japan. The cells were cultured at 22 °C in Murashige-Skoog medium under dark conditions [bib21] . The stems of 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants were used to prepare membrane fractions. The tissues were homogenized in a medium containing 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 250 mM sorbitol, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 20 μM p -(amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. The homogenate was filtered and centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 30 min and the pellet was suspended in Tricine-KOH (pH 7.5), 5% (w/w) sucrose, 1 mM EGTA and 2 mM EDTA. The crude membrane suspension (5 mg, 0.30 ml) was layered on a sucrose-density gradient (10.4 ml, 15–45%), centrifuged at 77 000 × g for 19 h in a swing rotor, and collected in 0.45-ml fractions. The sucrose solution consisted of 10 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mM EGTA, and 2 mM EDTA. For antibody production, we synthesized peptides corresponding to an internal region of Arabidopsis SIP1;1 (positions 109–122, MEFIPEKYKHMIGG) and the C-terminal region of SIP2;1 (positions 223–237, KPLTEEQEKPKAKSE). These peptides were linked with carrier protein and injected into rabbits. Antibody to Arabidopsis γ-TIP (TIP1;1) was prepared by injecting an authentic peptide (the 20 N-terminal residues) into a rabbit. The peptides and antibodies were prepared by Operon Biotechnology (Tokyo, Japan). The anti-peptide antibodies to RsPIP1 (sequence of the antigen peptide, GKEEDVRVGANKFPERQPIGTSA) and RsPIP2;1 (MAKDVEAVSGEGFQTRDYQDP) were prepared as described previously [bib22] . Anti-peptide antibodies to plasma membrane H + -ATPase (AHA3, TISKDRVKPSPTPDS), subunit-a of vacuolar H + -ATPase (VHA-a, ELVEINANNDKLQRSYNEL) and the ER luminal binding protein (BiP, SKDNKALGKLRRE) of Arabidopsis have been described elsewhere [bib21] . Protein samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting. The blots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A and Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Kpn I– Sal I and Eco RI– Sal I fragments of aquaporin cDNA (SIP1;1, Kpn I– Sal I; SIP1;2 and SIP2;1, Eco RI– Sal I) were inserted into the yeast expression vector pKT10 [bib23 bib24] . The resulting plasmids were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ5458 ( Mat a , ura3-52 , trp1 , lys2-801 , leu2 Δ 1 , his3 Δ 200 , pep4::HIS3 , prb Δ 1.6R can1 and GAL ), which is deficient in the major vacuolar proteases. Ura + colonies were selected and crude membranes were prepared from yeast cultured for 16 h at 30 °C [bib25] . They were suspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 M sorbitol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml peptstatin, and used for testing antibody specificity. Yeast cells expressing Arabidopsis aquaporin were cultured for 14 h at 30 °C and collected by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 5 min. Crude membrane fraction was prepared from yeast and suspended in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.2), 450 mM mannitol, 90 mM KCl and 1 mM EDTA as described previously [bib24 bib25] . The osmotic water permeability of membranes was measured with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Model SX18MV, Applied Photophysics) at 20 °C, as described previously [bib25] . Yeast membrane vesicles (0.5 mg/ml) in the 0.45 M mannitol buffer were mixed rapidly with an equal volume of 0.1 M mannitol solution in the same buffer. Initial rate constants in the first 20 ms were calculated from more than nine independent experiments. In order to prepare GFP fusions, SIP cDNAs were generated by PCR using KOD plus DNA polymerase and a pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). An artificial sequence, CACC, was added to the 5′terminuses of the SIP cDNAs. The DNA constructs obtained were inserted into a Gateway vector, New-pUGW5 (developed by Dr. Tsuyoshi Nakagawa), which contains GFP DNA, using the pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). These plasmids were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells as described previously [bib26] . Cells cultured for 5 days were incubated in enzyme solution for 80 min at 30 °C with gentle agitation to prepare the protoplasts and then passed through a nylon mesh (pore size, 41 μm). Protoplasts containing the plasmid were incubated at 23 °C for 16 h in the dark. Transformed cells were viewed using a confocal laser microscope (LSM510 META, Zeiss) [bib26] . Genomic sequences for SIP1;1 (−2012 to +18 from the fist ATG), SIP1;2 (−1997 to +12) and SIP2;1 (−1937 to +12) were isolated from genomic DNA by PCR using KOD plus. The resulting fragments were digested with Xba I and ligated into the Xba I– Sma I site of the binary vector pGWB203 (developed by Dr. Tsuyoshi Nakagawa), which contains the DNA sequence for β-glucuronidase (GUS), in order to produce a translational fusion product. The chimeric constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101::PM90 by electroporation and used to transform Arabidopsis plants. Transformants were selected on plates containing 40 μg/ml Benlate (Sumitomo Chemical Co.), 0.20 μg/ml Cefotax (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.), 20 μg/ml hygromycin, and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. T 1 plants were used for the GUS analysis. Plant tissues were incubated in 1.92 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β- d -glucuronide, 0.5 mM K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , 0.5 mM K 4 Re(CN) 6 and 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100 at 37 °C until blue histochemical staining was confirmed (6–24 h). The stained tissues were incubated sequentially in 30, 50 and 70% ethanol for 1 h, followed by further incubation in 99.5% ethanol for 24 h. In some experiments, thin sections of the stained tissues were cut.
