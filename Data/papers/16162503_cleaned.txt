!~ABS~! Cyanobacterial and plant genomes encode proteins with some similarity to the folate and biopterin transporters of the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania. The Synechocystis slr0642 gene product and its closest Arabidopsis homolog, the At2g32040 gene product, are representative examples. Both have 12 probable transmembrane domains, and the At2g32040 protein has a predicted chloroplast transit peptide. When expressed in Escherichia coli pabA pabB or folE, mutants, which are unable to produce or take up folates, the slr0642 protein and a modified At2g32040 protein (truncated and fused to the N terminus of slr0642) enabled growth on 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or folic acid but not on 5-formyltetrahydrofolate triglutamate, demonstrating that both proteins mediate folate monoglutamate transport. Both proteins also mediate transport of the antifolate analogs methotrexate and aminopterin, as evidenced by their ability to greatly increase the sensitivity of E. coli to these inhibitors. The full-length At2g32040 polypeptide was translocated into isolated pea chloroplasts and, when fused to green fluorescent protein, directed the passenger protein to the envelope of Arabidopsis chloroplasts in transient expression experiments. At2g32040 transcripts were present at similar levels in roots and aerial organs, indicating that the protein occurs in non-green plastids as well as chloroplasts. Insertional inactivation of At2g32040 significantly raised the total folate content of chloroplasts and lowered the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate but did not discernibly affect growth. These findings establish conservation of function among folate and biopterin transporter family proteins from three kingdoms of life. 
!~RES~! FBT Family Genes in Cyanobacteria and Plants—Blast searches of GenBank™ confirmed and extended the delineation of the FBT family given in the Pfam data base. Homologs of the Leishmania FT and BT1 transporters were found only in trypanosomatids, apicomplexans, Cyanobacteria, and plants. Cyanobacterial genomes have a single FBT gene specifying a highly conserved (≥56% identity) protein. In contrast, plant genomes encode several diverse FBT proteins, there being nine in Arabidopsis. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that one of these, At2g32040, clustered with Cyanobacteria, whereas the others fell into two groups of four each (see Supplemental Fig. 1, A and C). The At2g32040 protein shares 52-54% identity with the cyanobacterial proteins but differs in having an ∼90-residue N-terminal extension with the features of a plastid targeting peptide (CITATION) (see Supplemental Fig. 1C). The cyanobacterial and plant proteins have 12 predicted transmembrane α-helices, as illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1B for the Synechocystis slr0642 protein.  Because trypanosomatids and apicomplexans have apparently acquired numerous genes from photosynthetic organisms (CITATION, CITATION) and plants acquired many genes from Cyanobacteria (CITATION), the cyanobacterial protein is potentially the archetype of the FBT family. We accordingly chose a representative cyanobacterial FBT protein, Synechocystis slr0642 (henceforth slr0642) for further study along with its close plant relative, Arabidopsis At2g32040 (henceforth At2g32040).    [[FIGURE]] Folate Uptake by E. coli Expressing slr0642 or At2g32040—Folates cannot normally cross the inner membrane of E. coli cells, preventing rescue of folate synthesis mutants by supplied folates (CITATION). We, therefore, evaluated folate transport activity by expressing FBT constructs in a pabA pabB mutant, which is auxotrophic for pABA, and testing for growth on minimal medium with or without 5-CHO-THF or folic acid (the two most stable folates) in place of pABA. The mutant also harbored a plasmid bearing genes for three rare E. coli tRNAs (argU, ileY, leuW, corresponding to AT-rich codons); this plasmid was found to be needed to express At2g32040 constructs. The N-terminal extension that contains the predicted targeting peptide was removed from At2g32040 constructs, basing the truncation point (after residue 88) on alignments with slr0642 (see Supplemental Fig. 1C) and with orthologous plant sequences derived from ESTs (not shown). Because the truncated At2g32040 protein had a more hydrophilic N-terminal region than slr0642 and this region may affect membrane targeting or translation in E. coli (CITATION), we also constructed a chimeric version in which residues 1-40 of the truncated protein were replaced by residues 1-37 of slr0642.  After two passages on minimal medium plus or minus folate, the growth of mutant cells harboring the empty pLOI707HE vector ceased (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells expressing slr0642 continued to grow when given folates (Fig. 2A), showing that the latter are transported. The truncated At2g32040 did not confer the ability to grow on folates, but the chimeric version was effective (Fig. 2A). Cells expressing slr0642 or chimeric At2g32040 did not grow when 5-CHO-THF triglutamate replaced the monoglutamyl form (not shown), indicating that both transporters, like most other folate carriers, prefer monoglutamates (note, however, that the triglutamate approaches in size the exclusion limit of the outer membrane porins of E. coli, which may also have impeded uptake). Cells cured of their plasmids were not rescued by folates, confirming that the transport trait is plasmid-encoded.    [[FIGURE]] Although 5-CHO-THF and folic acid are relatively stable, some spontaneous breakdown is inevitable, releasing pABA-Glu. To rule out the possibility that the growth seen on folates was due to such release, we confirmed that pABA-Glu did not support growth of mutant cells expressing slr0642 or chimeric At2g32040 (not shown). Because E. coli cannot normally take up pABA-Glu but can utilize it once absorbed (CITATION), this result further shows that neither protein is able to transport pABA-Glu.  The results from the pabA pabB mutant were corroborated using a second mutant, a folE deletant, which lacks the first enzyme of the pteridine branch of folate synthesis (GTP cyclohydrolase I). This deletant could grow on rich medium supplemented with 5-CHO-THF when expressing slr0642 or chimeric At2g32040 but not when harboring the empty vector (Fig. 2B). The folE deletant could not be used to test slr0642 or At2g32040 for transport of dihydropteroate or dihydropterins (hydroxymethyldihydropterin, dihydropterin-6-aldehyde) as these compounds supported growth of deletant cells harboring the empty vector (not shown).    [[FIGURE]] Antifolate Uptake—The antifolates aminopterin and methotrexate are close structural analogs of folic acid, differing only in one and two groups, respectively (Fig. 1A). E. coli normally has little capacity to take up these compounds, and they are inhibitory only at high concentrations (CITATION, CITATION). Therefore, we tested antifolate transport activity by evaluating growth of cells exposed to antifolate gradients on plates (Fig. 3A) or to various levels of antifolates in liquid medium (Fig. 3, B and C). Expression of slr0642 or the chimeric At2g32040 construct imparted large increases in sensitivity that were qualitatively obvious on plates and were quantified as 30-100-fold in liquid culture. The truncated At2g32040 protein was again ineffective.  Subcellular Localization of At2g32040—This was investigated first by transient expression of an At2g32040::GFP fusion construct in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Consistent with the presence of a putative plastid targeting peptide, expression of the fusion protein resulted in green fluorescence that colocalized with the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll; the green fluorescence was strongest at the chloroplast margins, suggesting that the protein is concentrated in the envelope (Fig. 4A). Expression of GFP alone gave green fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A).  Import assays with isolated pea chloroplasts substantiated these results (Fig. 4B). After the import reaction with the full-length protein, chloroplasts contained a labeled product that was smaller than the full-length protein and was protected from attack by thermolysin, as expected for a translocated protein. In contrast, a truncated version lacking the predicted targeting peptide was not processed and was thermolysin-sensitive, indicating that it had not been taken up. The latter protein (calculated molecular mass 51 kDa) behaved in SDS-PAGE as a 51-kDa species as expected, but the full-length protein (calculated mass 61 kDa) migrated as a 72-kDa species (Fig. 4B)). Other FBT family proteins likewise migrate anomalously (CITATION). Thus, although the migration of the imported protein as a 67-kDa band (Fig. 4B) implies that the point we chose to truncate At2g32040 is not identical to the normal processing site, electrophoretic anomalies preclude quantifying the discrepancy.    [[FIGURE]] Expression of At2g32040 in Arabidopsis Organs—Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the At2g32040 gene is constitutively expressed throughout the plant at a low level (sequencing of the RT-PCR product obtained from root and young leaf RNA confirmed that it corresponded to At2g32040 mRNA). Thus, the abundance of At2g32040 transcripts varied rather little among major organs, from 5 to 14 × 104 copies/250 ng of total RNA (Fig. 5A), which corresponds to a frequency between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 60,000 mRNAs (assuming that mRNA is 1% of total RNA and has an average size of 1.5 kb). Ubiquitous, low level expression is also reported for At2g32040 in the GENEVESTIGATOR Arabidopsis microarray data base (CITATION). The presence of At2g32040 transcripts in roots as well as aerial organs implies that the protein is expressed in non-green plastids as well as chloroplasts.    [[FIGURE]] Identification and Analysis of a T-DNA Insertion Mutant—To explore the function of At2g32040 in vivo,an Arabidopsis line bearing a T-DNA insertion in the coding region of the gene was identified in the Salk collection (CITATION). This mutant has a single T-DNA insertion in exon 1 at codon 24 (Fig. 5, B and C), as determined from the flanking DNA sequence and co-segregation of kanamycin resistance with the T-DNA. The insertion creates at least two in-frame stop codons and, therefore, is predicted to result in a complete knock-out.  Homozygous mutant plants did not differ noticeably from their wild type siblings in growth rate, morphology, leaf color, or fertility. Because At2g32040 is located in the plastid (Fig. 4), we compared the folate profiles of chloroplasts from wild type and mutant plants (Fig. 6). As in pea (CITATION-CITATION), total folate levels in wild type chloroplasts were low, about 50 pmol/mg of protein or 150 pmol/mg of chlorophyll, which is equivalent to a stromal concentration of ∼2 μm (taking stromal volume as 66 μl/mg chlorophyll (CITATION)). The most prominent folate forms were 5-methyl- and 5,10-methenyl-THF (the acidic HPLC mobile phase used in the analysis converts 10-formyl-THF to 5,10-methenyl-THF, so that the 5,10-methenyl-THF measured includes 10-formyl-THF plus any preexisting 5,10-methenyl-THF). Relative to wild type, mutant chloroplasts contained significantly (p < 0.05) more 5,10-methenyl-THF and total folate per unit protein (Fig. 6A) and, when data were expressed on a percent basis, a significantly lower proportion of 5-methyl-THF (Fig. 6B). 
!~MM~! Chemicals and Reagents—Folates and pteridines were from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). p-Aminobenzoylglutamate (pABA-Glu) was HPLC-purified before use. Percoll and [5,6-3H]UTP (35 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]Leucine (59 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.  E. coli Strains—Strain BN1163 (pabA1, pabB::Kan, rpsL704, ilvG-, rfb-50, rph-1) was supplied by B. Nichols (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), and strain NM1200 was supplied by N. Majdalani (NCBI, Bethesda, MD). The NM1200 strain was constructed by P1 transduction of the Mini-λ CmR prophage carrying the Red gam, beta, and exo genes under the PL promoter (CITATION) in MG1655 (E. coli K12, E. coli Genetic Stock Center). The folE gene was deleted by targeted homologous recombination using electroporated linear DNA and strain NM1200 as described (CITATION). Briefly, the kanamycin cassette was amplified from plasmid pUC4K with primers FolE-5′ and FolE-3′ (see Supplemental Table I), which respectively included the start and stop codon of folE and 47-bp 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. After inducing the recombination system at 42 °C for 15 min, strain NM1200 was transformed with the PCR product. Clones with the desired replacement of the folE gene were selected on LB plates containing 300 μm thymidine and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The kanamycin resistance locus was then transferred by P1 transduction to strain K12, to give strain P1-7B. Deletion of the folE gene was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. P1-7B was maintained on LB medium containing 300 μm thymidine and 30 μg/ml kanamycin.    [[FIGURE]] Plants and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown at 23-28 °C in 12-h days (photosynthetic photon flux density 80 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) in potting soil irrigated with water. When roots were required, plants were grown hydroponically (CITATION).  Expression Constructs—Synechocystis slr0642 and Arabidopsis At2g32040 amplicons preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence were cloned between the NotI and SstI sites of pLOI707HE (CITATION), which contains the tac promoter, the lacIq repressor gene, and the tet marker. Templates were Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genomic DNA (from W. Vermaas, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ) and an At2g32040 cDNA (GenBank™ BT003363, from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center). The following PCR primers were used (see Supplemental Table I): for Synechocystis slr0642, Slr1-5′ and Slr1-3′; for the mature At2g32040 construct, At-t1-5′ and At-t1-3′; for the chimeric At2g32040 construct (with codons 1-128 replaced by codons 1-37 of slr0642), Slr1-5′ and Slr-c1-3′ to amplify the slr0642 fragment, At-c1-5′ and At-t1-3′ to amplify the At2g32040 fragment, and Slr1-5′ and At-t1-3′ to splice the fragments. The complete slr0642 amplicon was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega), excised with NotI and SstI, and then cloned into pLOI707HE; other amplicons were cut with NotI and SstI and cloned straight into pLOI707HE. For the vector minus insert control, pLOI707HE was digested with NotI and SstI, end-polished with T4 polymerase, and religated. Constructs were made in E. coli strain DH5α, sequence-verified, then introduced into E. coli strains BN1163 and P1-7B, both harboring pACYC-RIL (Stratagene), which contains three rare E. coli tRNA genes and the cat marker. Transformants were grown on LB plates containing tetracycline 10 μg/ml, kanamycin 30-50 μg/ml, chloramphenicol 20 μg/ml and (for P1-7B only) thymidine 300 μm.  Folate Uptake Tests—BN1163 cells harboring pACYC-RIL and a pLOI707HE construct were streaked on minimal medium plates containing M9 salts (CITATION), 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, trace elements (CITATION), and 0.4% (w/v) glucose supplemented with antibiotics as above and 0.5 mm IPTG. To this medium was added 3.6 μm pABA or 11 μm (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF (5-CHO-THF), folic acid, or (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF triglutamate. P1-7B cells harboring pACYC-RIL and a pLOI707HE construct were streaked on LB medium containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium ascorbate and 1 mm dithiothreitol, appropriate antibiotics and IPTG minus or plus 11 μm 5-CHO-THF, dihydropteroate, hydroxymethyldihydropterin, or dihydropterin-6-aldehyde. Tests with the two latter compounds were made in a 10-l vessel flushed with N2 at 25 ml/h.  Antifolate Uptake Tests—Solid or liquid minimal media were supplemented with antibiotics, IPTG, and pABA as described above. For tests on solid medium, cells were streaked on plates containing a central 1-cm disk of Whatman No. 1 paper soaked with 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide alone or containing 100 mm methotrexate or 80 mm aminopterin. For tests in liquid medium, cells from an overnight culture were inoculated to give an A600 reading of 0.05 in 1.5 ml of fresh medium supplemented with various amounts of methotrexate or aminopterin. Growth was evaluated by measuring A600 after incubating at 37 °C for 9.5 h with shaking at 220 rpm.  Transient Expression of Green Fluorescent Fusion Protein in Arabidopsis Protoplasts—The entire At2g32040 sequence was amplified using primers At-gfp-5′ and At-gfp-3′, digested with SalI and NcoI, and cloned in-frame upstream of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in pTH2 (CITATION). Protoplasts were prepared from cell cultures, transformed, and cultured as described at 22 °C for up to 48 h (CITATION, CITATION). Transformation efficiencies were typically 5-20%. Samples were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy as described (CITATION).  Chloroplast Import Assays—The full-length At2g32040 sequence and a version lacking the first 88 residues were, respectively, amplified using forward primer At-ifl-5′ or At-it-5′ and reverse primer At-i-3′. The amplicons were cloned as EcoRI-HindIII fragments into pGEM®-4Z (Promega). Coupled in vitro transcription-translation was performed using a wheat germ TnT® kit (Promega) and [3H]leucine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Translation product import into pea chloroplasts was assayed as described (CITATION). Briefly, translation product (50 μl) was added to 50 μl of 2× import buffer (CITATION) containing 100 mm unlabeled leucine; 100 μl of 1× import buffer containing 30 mm Mg2+-ATP and 200 μl of purified chloroplasts (0.2 mg chlorophyll) were added, and samples were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the light. Chloroplasts were re-purified as described (CITATION), resuspended in SDS loading buffer containing 4 m urea, and held for 10 min at 37 °C before loading.  Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kits (Qiagen) and treated with DNase (DNA-free™ kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). RT-PCR was performed on 250 ng of RNA in 25-μl reactions using Taq-Man One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix reagents and a GeneAmp 5700 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers (At-rt-5′, At-rt-3′) and Taq-Man probe (At-rt-probe) were designed with Applied Biosystems Primer Express software. The amplicon length was 74 bp. Primer At-rt-5′ spanned two exons to avoid amplifying contaminating genomic DNA, and controls without reverse transcriptase were run to verify that no such amplification occurred. RT-PCR conditions were 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. An At2g32040 RNA standard was synthesized from a cDNA template using primers At-SP6std-5′ and At-std-3′ and labeled using [5,6-3H]UTP as described (CITATION). An internal standard RNA was added to each sample before RT-PCR to estimate recoveries, which were 34-100%. Data were corrected for recovery.  Insertional Mutant—An At2g32040 mutant (Salk 109024) was identified in the Salk Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) T-DNA insertion collection (CITATION). Wild type or homozygous mutant segregants were identified by PCR using gene-specific primers located 5′ or 3′ of the T-DNA insertion (At-s-5′ and At-s-3′, respectively) and the T-DNA-specific primer SalkLBb1. Genomic DNA was extracted as described (CITATION). The insertion site was confirmed by sequencing the amplicon from mutant homozygotes. Homozygous mutant and wild type segregants were selfed, and their progeny were used for experiments. Kanamycin resistance was shown to co-segregate with the At2g32040 mutation, indicating the absence of T-DNA insertions at other loci.  Chloroplast Folate Analyses—Chloroplasts were prepared from the leaves of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants as described (CITATION, CITATION). Folates were extracted from samples (∼1 mg of chlorophyll), deglutamylated, affinity-purified, and determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection as described (CITATION).
