!~ABS~! The biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs takes place in both the cytoplasm where Sm core proteins are added and snRNAs are modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini and in the nucleus where snRNP-specific proteins associate. U1 snRNP consists of U1 snRNA, seven Sm proteins and three snRNP-specific proteins, U1-70K, U1A, and U1C. It has been shown previously that after import to the nucleus U2 and U4/U6 snRNP-specific proteins first appear in Cajal bodies (CB) and then in splicing speckles. In addition, in cells grown under normal conditions U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs/snRNPs are abundant in CBs. Therefore, it has been proposed that the final assembly of these spliceosomal snRNPs takes place in this nuclear compartment. In contrast, U1 snRNA in both animal and plant cells has rarely been found in this nuclear compartment. Here, we analysed the subnuclear distribution of Arabidopsis U1 snRNP-specific proteins fused to GFP or mRFP in transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts. Irrespective of the tag used, U1-70K was exclusively found in the nucleus, whereas U1A and U1C were equally distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus all three proteins localised to CBs and nucleoli although to different extent. Interestingly, we also found that the appearance of the three proteins in nuclear speckles differ significantly. U1-70K was mostly found in speckles whereas U1A and U1C in ∼90% of cells showed diffuse nucleoplasmic in combination with CBs and nucleolar localisation. Our data indicate that CBs and nucleolus are involved in the maturation of U1 snRNP. Differences in nuclear accumulation and distribution between U1-70K and U1A and U1C proteins may indicate that either U1-70K or U1A and U1C associate with, or is/are involved, in other nuclear processes apart from pre-mRNA splicing.
!~RES~! We could previously show that transient expression of U2 snRNP-specific proteins in Arabidopsis protoplasts results in their correct localisation in the nucleus. In particular, it has been shown that U2B″ and U2A′ proteins localise in a diffuse/speckled nucleoplasmic pattern, with the majority of cells also showing localisation in CBs and to a lesser extent in nucleoli [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1]. Therefore, we used this experimental system combined with confocal microscopy to analyse the localisation of Arabidopsis U1 snRNP- specific proteins, U1-70K, U1A and U1C. As can be seen from the [pone-0003989-g001] all three proteins localised to the nucleus. However, U1-70K was exclusively found in the nucleus whereas U1A and U1C were found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm in virtually all cells. As GFP is a rather large tag, it could possibly influence the import of small proteins (U1A and U1C) into the nucleus. Therefore, biochemical fractionation of protoplasts expressing GFP and HA-tagged proteins into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was performed. These experiments revealed that 24 hours after transformation approximately 50% of U1A and U1C proteins remained cytoplasmic irrespective of the tag used ([pone-0003989-g001]). In contrast, U1-70K could not be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction ([pone-0003989-g001]). Analysis of the distribution of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins RBP45 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBP) indicated that fractionation procedure was specific ([pone-0003989-g001]). We also compared the expression levels of proteins as this might influence nuclear import. However, analysis of GFP-tagged proteins revealed similar expression levels for all three proteins analysed ([pone-0003989-g001]; see also [pone-0003989-g001]). Control western analysis with antibody against the tubulin revealed that equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane ([pone-0003989-g001]). Finally, no major degradation products were observed for any of the three proteins ([pone-0003989-g001]). Thus, the cytoplasmic localisation of U1A and U1C proteins is not due to their higher expression levels or protein degradation. (A) Single confocal sections of protoplasts expressing U1-70K, U1A, and U1C proteins fused to GFP. Corresponding differential interference contrast (DIC) image of a cell expressing U1-70K is also shown. Arrows, broken arrow and arrowheads point to nuclei, nucleoli and CBs, respectively. Scale bars, 15 µm. (B) Cellular localisation of GFP- (left panel) or HA-tagged (right panel) U1 snRNP-specific proteins studied by cellular fractionation. Cell extracts were fractionated as described [pone.0003989-Lambermon1]. Lanes T, C, and N; total cellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear protein fractions, respectively. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting, using mouse anti-GFP and rat anti-HA mAb. Molecular mass standards in kDa are indicated on the left. To control the quality of the fractionation procedure the same blots were probed with antibodies against nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins RBP45 [pone.0003989-Lorkovic5] and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBP), respectively (two bottom panels). (C) Immunodetection of U1-70K, U1A and U1C GFP fusion proteins in protein extract from transformed protoplasts. Total protein extracts were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody. Molecular mass standards in kDa are indicated on the left. Western blotting of the same protein extracts with anti-tubulin antibodies was performed as a loading control (bottom panel). Transient expression of HA and GFP-tagged U2A′, U2B″ and U1-70K in Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts resulted in their correct assembly into mature snRNPs [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1], [pone.0003989-Lorkovic2]. To find out whether transiently expressed U1A and U1C proteins associate with U1 snRNP, immunoprecipitations with anti-m3G antibody which recognizes the trimethylguanosine Cap structure at the 5′ end of U snRNAs [pone.0003989-Lhrmann1] were performed. [pone-0003989-g002] demonstrates that GFP- and HA-tagged U1A and U1C proteins were efficiently precipitated with anti-m3G antibody ([pone-0003989-g002]), indicating association with the mature snRNP. To further support this observation protein extracts form protoplasts expressing GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies ([pone-0003989-g002]) followed by RNA extraction. Analysis of immunoprecipitates for the presence of snRNAs by [32P]-pCp labelling revealed efficient co-precipitation of U1 snRNA with both proteins ([pone-0003989-g002]), but not of other spliceosomal snRNAs. Immunoprecipitation performed with anti-GFP antibody and protein extracts from non-transformed cells indicated that the procedure was specific. [pone-0003989-g002] (lane 1 in right panel) shows that no appreciable amounts of U1 snRNA were precipitated. From the immunoprecipitation data shown in [pone-0003989-g002] and from our previous data [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1], [pone.0003989-Lorkovic2] we conclude that transient expression of U1 snRNP-specific proteins in Arabidopsis protoplasts results in efficient incorporation into mature U1 snRNPs.

Lanes 4 and 7, RNA co-precipitated with U1A-GFP and U1C-GFP, respectively. From the images shown in [pone-0003989-g001] it is obvious that the three U1 snRNP-specific proteins show different localisation patterns in the nucleus. As we observed that the frequencies of the identified nuclear patterns differed between U1-70K and U1A/U1C proteins we performed quantitative analysis. To do so, three independent transformations of Arabidopsis protoplasts were performed and nuclear localisation patterns for the three U1 snRNP-specific proteins were scored by counting 100 cells for each protein. The most common patterns observed with U1-70K, U1A, and U1C proteins are shown in [pone-0003989-g003], respectively. In general, we can say that all three proteins show: (i) diffuse nucleoplasmic staining with or without CBs localisation: (ii) diffuse nucleoplasmic staining with nucleolar localisation; (iii) diffuse nucleoplasmic staining with nucleolar and CBs localisation; (iv) speckled nucleoplasmic localisation with or without nucleolar and CBs staining. However, it is important to note that most cells showing speckled localisation did not show localisation in nucleoli and CBs and that in the majority of cells nucleolar staining was restricted to the nucleolar cavity. Next, we compared the percentages of cells showing speckled and diffuse nucleoplasmic localisation. From three independent transformations it became clear that U1-70K localises into speckles in 57.5% of analysed cells, whereas U1A and U1C showed speckled pattern only in 13 and 7% of analysed cells, respectively ([pone-0003989-g004]). Quantification of cells with nucleolar and CB localisation revealed further differences between U1-70K and U1A/U1C proteins ([pone-0003989-g004]). U1-70K localised in CBs and in nucleoli in 42.5 and 16% of cells, respectively, whereas these numbers for U1A and U1C were 87 and 95% for CBs, and 67 and 60% for nucleoli. The total number of cells showing both nucleolar and CB localisation in combination with either speckled or diffuse nucleoplasmic staining was also dramatically different, being only 6.5% for U1-70K and 66 and 58% for U1A and U1C, respectively ([pone-0003989-g004]). Percentages of cells showing diffuse nucleoplasmic and CB localisation were similar for all three proteins: 28.5% for U1-70K, 21% for U1A, and 37% for U1C ([pone-0003989-g004]). A low percentage (7.5%) of cells expressing U1-70K also showed a speckled pattern in combination with CB localisation ([pone-0003989-g004]). Finally, U1A and U1C were found in speckles in combination with CB localisation (see [pone-0003989-g003], U1C-GFP) with frequencies less then 1%, whereby the intensity of speckle fluorescence was significantly lower compared to that of U1-70K. Representative images of nuclear patterns observed in protoplasts expressing U1-70K (A), U1A (B), and U1C (C) GFP-tagged proteins. Single confocal sections are shown. Arrows, arrowheads, and asterisks point to nucleoli, CBs, and nucleolar cavities, respectively. Scale bars, 8 µm. Transformations with GFP tagged proteins were performed independently three times, and each time 100 randomly chosen cells were analysed. (A) Speckled and diffuse nucleoplasmic staining patterns were scored and percentages are indicated inside the bars. (B) CB and nucleolar localisation as well as combinations of different patterns as indicated on X-axis were scored. The Y-axis represents the percentage of cells showing specific pattern(s). Taken together, these results suggest that CBs and nucleoli are involved in U1 snRNP maturation. Furthermore, it is obvious that higher proportion of U1-70K accumulates in speckles compared to CBs and nucleoli, whereas U1A and U1C are most abundant in these two nuclear compartments and are rarely found in speckles. Having established that transiently expressed U1 snRNP-specific proteins assemble correctly into mature snRNP, we asked next whether they co-localise when co-expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. This was particularly interesting as we observed that U1-70K and U1A/U1C proteins showed strikingly different nuclear localisation patterns. As U1A and U1C showed the same frequencies for all nuclear localisation patterns observed we first asked whether they co-localise in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Cells co-expressing U1C-mRFP and U1A-GFP showed perfect co-localisation of proteins in CBs, nucleoli, and nucleoplasm ([pone-0003989-g005]). In addition, co-expression of U1A-GFP and U1C-GFP with U2B″-mRFP (an established marker for CBs in plant cells) [pone.0003989-Boudonck1], [pone.0003989-Beven1], [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1] resulted in co-localisation of the two protein pairs in CBs and nucleoplasm ([pone-0003989-g005]). This is in agreement with the fact that at the steady-state in both, plant and animal cells, U2 snRNP accumulates in CBs [pone.0003989-Boudonck1], [pone.0003989-Beven1]–[pone.0003989-Tanackovic1] and further support our observation that CBs are sites of U1 snRNP biogenesis. (A) Co-localisation of U1A-GFP and U1C-mRFP. (B) Co-localisation of U1C-GFP and U2B″-mRFP. (C) Co-localisation of U170K-GFP and U1C-mRFP. Arrows, arrowheads, and asterisks point to nucleoli, CBs, and nucleolar cavities, respectively. All images are single confocal sections. Scale bars, 8 µm. U1-70K was shown to localise primarily in a speckled pattern in the nucleoplasm, although localisation in CBs and nucleoli was also observed ([pone-0003989-g003] and [pone-0003989-g004]). This was quite different from the localisation pattern frequencies observed with U1A and U1C proteins. Co-expression of GFP-tagged U1-70K with U1C-mRFP resulted in co-localisation of the two proteins in the diffuse nucleoplasmic pool. Co-localisation was also observed in CBs, but only in cells where U1-70K did not show a speckled pattern ([pone-0003989-g005]). However, fluorescence intensities of U1-70K in CBs were much lower compared to that of U1C ([pone-0003989-g005]). Consistent with the fact that U1-70K did not strongly accumulate in nucleoli, very little co-localisation between these two proteins was observed in this compartment ([pone-0003989-g005]). Finally, in cells showing a speckled localisation pattern for U1-70K, co-localisation with U1C was not observed in CBs, and very little in speckles ([pone-0003989-g005]). This is consistent with the frequencies of different patterns occurring in cells expressing U1-70K and U1C alone ([pone-0003989-g003] and [pone-0003989-g004]). Also, this indicated that co-expression of two proteins does not influence localisation of each other. Taken together, our localisation and co-localisation data indicate that the assembly of U1-70K and U1A/U1C proteins into mature U1 snRNP are either following different pathways or different kinetics. U1-70K protein might largely localise directly to speckles, without passage through CBs and nucleoli, which may indicate an additional role for this protein apart from being a U1 snRNP component involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
!~MM~! Plasmids expressing U1 70K-GFP, U1-70K-HA, U2B″-mRFP and SRp34-GFP have been described [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1]. Plasmids expressing U1A-GFP, U1A-HA, U1C-HA U11-35K-GFP and U11-35K-RFP have been described [pone.0003989-Lorkovic2]. To generate plant expression plasmids encoding GFP and mRFP tagged U1C protein, the coding region of U1C was amplified by using oligonucleotides: U1C 5′ primer GATCGGTCGAC AATAAACCATGCCGAGGTATTACTGTG and 3′ primer AGCATGGATCCTTTCTTGGCATACGTGATG, which introduce a SalI (bold) site and a plant translation consensus sequence (italics) in front of the ATG codon and a BamHI site in place of the stop codon, respectively. The PCR products were cut with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the plant expression vectors pDEDH-GFP and pDEDH-mRFP [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1], resulting in pU1C-GFP and pU1C-mRFP, respectively. Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts were isolated and transformed as described [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1]. Transformed protoplasts were collected twenty four hours after transformation and stored at −80°C or were analysed by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica). Protoplasts were collected by centrifugation twenty four hours after transformation (15 min, 70×g), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended in protoplast extraction buffer (PEB400; 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 400 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100), supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and further processed as described in Lorkovic et al. [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1], [pone.0003989-Lorkovic3]. After 15 min centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed at 4°C, the supernatant was mixed with PEB without KCl to adjust KCl concentration to 250 mM (PEB250). Immunoprecipitations and 32P-[pCp] labelling of snRNAs were performed as described in Lorkovic et al. [pone.0003989-Lorkovic1], [pone.0003989-Lorkovic3]. Cellular fractionation of transformed protoplasts into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was performed as described by Lambermon et al. [pone.0003989-Lambermon1]. Images were obtained with a TCS-SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg). GFP and RFP were excited with an ArKr laser at 476 and 568 nm, respectively. GFP was detected at 510 nm to 550 nm, and RFP and mRFP were detected at 630 nm to 680 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop software and prepared for presentation. 12% SDS-PAGE was done according to standard procedure. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore) and Western blotting was performed according to standard procedure. Rat anti-HA (3F10, Roche) and mouse anti-GFP (Roche) monoclonal antibodies were used at 1∶1,000 dilution. Mouse anti-RBP45 [pone.0003989-Lorkovic5] monoclonal and rabbit anti-cFBP (Agrisera) polyclonal antibodies were used at 1∶200 and 1∶5,000 dilutions, respectively. Secondary antibodies, goat anti-rat (Sigma), goat anti-mouse (Biorad) IgGs, and goat-anti rabbit (Biorad) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used at 1∶10,000 dilutions. The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (AmershamPharmacia Biotech).
