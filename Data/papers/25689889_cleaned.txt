!~ABS~!  AtSFT12, an Arabidopsis Qc-SNARE protein, is localized to Golgi organelles and is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses via accumulation of Na + in vacuoles.  To reduce the detrimental effects of environmental stresses, plants have evolved many defense mechanisms. Here, we identified an Arabidopsis Qc-SNARE gene, AtSFT12, involved in salt and osmotic stress responses using an activation-tagging method. Both activation-tagged plants and overexpressing transgenic plants (OXs) of the AtSFT12 gene were tolerant to high concentrations of NaCl, LiCl, and mannitol, whereas loss-of-function mutants were sensitive to NaCl, LiCl, and mannitol. AtSFT12 transcription increased under NaCl, ABA, cold, and mannitol stresses but not MV treatment. GFP-fusion AtSFT12 protein was juxtaposed with Golgi marker, implying that its function is associated with Golgi-mediated transport. Quantitative measurement of Na+ using induced coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy revealed that AtSFT12 OXs accumulated significantly more Na+ than WT plants. In addition, Na+-dependent fluorescence analysis of Sodium Green showed comparatively higher Na+ accumulation in vacuoles of AtSFT12 OX cells than in those of WT plant cells after salt treatments. Taken together, our findings suggest that AtSTF12, a Golgi Qc-SNARE protein, plays an important role in salt and osmotic stress responses and functions in the salt stress response via sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles.
!~RES~! To isolate salt stress-responsive genes, we screened T 1 activation-tagging lines of Arabidopsis harboring pFGL942, an activation-tagging vector (Fig. 1a), as previously described by Lee et al. (CITATION), and isolated AT1362 line plants showing a salt tolerance phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S1). We confirmed that T3 seedlings of the AT1362 line were tolerant to 140, 150, or 160 mM NaCl with higher fresh weight than WT plants (Fig. 1b, c). To identify the T-DNA insertion site in AT1362, we isolated genomic DNA from AT1362 plants and performed TAIL-PCR. The amplified PCR fragments were subjected to sequencing analysis, and the results reveal that CaMV 35S enhancers were inserted between At1g29060 and At1g29070 on chromosome 1 (Fig. 1d). At1g29060 encodes AtSFT12, a Qc-SNARE protein, whereas At1g29070 encodes a ribosomal protein. To identify genes activated by CaMV 35S enhancer in AT1362, we analyzed transcription levels of At1g29060 (AtSFT12) and At29070 (ribosomal protein gene) in T2 plants of AT1362 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In our results, AtSFT12 expression was elevated in AT1362 line plants compared to WT plants (Fig. 1e). [[FIGURE]]  We searched AtSFT12 homologs using SNARE motif of AtSFT12 by BlastP program and found 69 proteins showing high similarity with AtSFT12, including AtSFT11 which is a paralog of AtSFT12 in Arabidopsis (data not shown). Interestingly, all of those 69 proteins were plant proteins, indicating that the SNARE motif of AtSFT12 is well conserved only in plants. It has been reported that AtSFT12 is one of the 12 total Qc-SNAREs in Arabidopsis (Lipka et al. CITATION). Phylogenetic analysis of these 12 Arabidopsis Qc-SNAREs found that AtSFT12 and AtSFT11, which belong to the SFT1 subfamily, were the most closely related to the USE1 subfamily of Qc-SNAREs that include AtUSE11 and AtUSE12 (Supplementary Fig. S2a). Multiple alignment analysis showed that the Qc-SNAREs of Arabidopsis share specific conserved Qc-SNARE domains ranging in length from 54 to 59 aa, mostly having Q residue as the 0-layer residue in center of SNARE motif (Supplementary Fig. S2b). To confirm the role of AtSFT12 in the abiotic stress response, we generated AtSFT12 OXs overexpressing AtSFT12 under control of the CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. 2a). We selected three independent T 1 lines of AtSFT12 OXs by semi-quantitative RT-PCR for further study (Fig. 2b). Similar to AT1362 line plants, AtSFT12 OXs showed higher tolerance to 150 or 160 mM NaCl than WT plants (Fig. 2c, d). AtSFT12 OXs were also more tolerant to 15, 20, or 25 mM LiCl than WT plants (Fig. 2e, f). Additionally, AtSFT12 OXs were resistant to 400, 450, or 500 mM mannitol (Fig. 2g, h). However, AtSFT12 OXs did not show significant difference compared to WT plants upon MV treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3a, b). We then measured water-loss rates in AtSFT12 OXs and WT plants under dehydration conditions to further confirm tolerance of AtSFT12 OXs to osmotic stress. Water loss was significantly slower in AtSFT12 OXs than in WT plants (Fig. 2i). All of the three independent T 1 lines of AtSFT12 OXs showed similar results. These results indicate that AtSFT12 is involved in the responses to salt and osmotic stresses, and overexpression of AtSFT12 confers tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses. [[FIGURE]]  Since AT1362 line plants and AtSFT12 OXs showed tolerant phenotypes to salt and osmotic stresses, we investigated the response of AtSFT12 mutants to salt and osmotic stresses. Two T-DNA-inserted mutants of AtSFT12, Salk_141347C (AtSFT12-1) in which T-DNA was inserted in the 5′ untranslated region of AtSFT12 and Salk_054695C (AtSFT12-2) in which T-DNA was inserted in the third exon of AtSFT12, were obtained from the SIGnAL Collection at the Salk Institute (Alonso et al. CITATION) (Fig. 3a). We first selected homozygous mutants of AtSFT12-2 and then confirmed down-regulation of AtSFT12 expression using semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3b). We then investigated the response of AtSFT12-2 mutants to salt and osmotic stresses and found that AtSFT12-2 mutants displayed greater sensitivity to 130 or 140 mM NaCl (Fig. 3c, d) as well as 15 or 17.5 mM LiCl (Fig. 3e, f). In addition, AtSFT12-2 mutants were more sensitive to 350 or 400 mM mannitol (Fig. 3g, h). However, AtSFT12-2 mutants did not show any significant difference compared to WT plants upon MV treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3c, d). We then measured water-loss rates in AtSFT12-2 mutants as well as WT plants under dehydration conditions. Water loss was significantly faster in AtSFT12-2 mutants compared to WT plants (Fig. 3i). Combined with the AtSFT12 OX results, this finding indicates that AtSFT12 is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses. On the other hand, similar to AtSFT12-2 mutants, AtSFT12-1 mutants also showed more sensitivity to salt stress compared to WT plants (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that the phenotype of AtSFT12-2 mutants can be attributed to down-regulation of AtSFT12 expression. [[FIGURE]]  The tolerance of AtSFT12 OXs and sensitivity of AtSFT12 mutants to salt and osmotic stresses suggests that AtSFT12 is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. Thus, we further investigated expression patterns of AtSFT12 under abiotic stress conditions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis using 10-day-old WT seedlings showed that AtSFT12 transcription was highly elevated by NaCl, cold, and ABA treatments (Fig. 4a–c) and slightly increased upon mannitol treatment (Fig. 4d), suggesting that AtSFT12 is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses. However, AtSFT12 transcription was slightly reduced or unchanged upon MV treatment (Fig. 4e). Combined with the phenotypic analysis of AtSFT12 OXs and AtSFT12 mutants upon MV treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3), this result suggests that AtSFT12 might not be involved in the oxidative stress response. OsSFT12, a rice ortholog of AtSFT12, also showed no change in transcription under oxidative stress conditions (Bao et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed very similar results to those of quantitative RT-PCR, in which transcription level of AtSFT12 was significantly elevated by NaCl, cold, and ABA treatments, slightly increased by mannitol, and reduced or unaltered by MV treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). We also investigated the spatial and temporal expression patterns of AtSFT12 in Arabidopsis by quantitative RT-PCR. AtSFT12 showed almost constitutive transcription as plants developed, with higher expression at 7 DAG (Fig. 5a). In mature plants, AtSFT12 transcription was strongly detected in rosette leaves compared to other organs (Fig. 5b), suggesting that AtSFT12 plays an important role in rosette leaves. It has also been reported that OsSFT12 is expressed in vegetative tissues such as clums and leaves, but almost no expression was observed in reproductive tissues such as flowering spikes (Bao et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  To investigate the subcellular localization of AtSFT12, Arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed with AtSFT12–sGFP or sGFP–AtSFT12 fusion vector (Fig. 6a). Signals of both AtSFT12 constructs were either overlapped or juxtaposed with Golgi signal although fluorescence intensity of sGFP–AtSFT12 was weaker than that of AtSFT12–sGFP (Fig. 6b), indicating that AtSFT12 plays a role in the Golgi-mediated transport. It was reported that Sft1p, a putative ortholog of AtSFT12 in yeast, is localized to the Golgi compartment and required for vesicle transport from intra-Golgi compartments (Banfield et al. CITATION; Kloepper et al. CITATION), suggesting that AtSFT12 might also be involved in vesicle transport via the Golgi. [[FIGURE]]  Ion accumulation in vacuoles is important for countering salt stress and mediated by membrane transporters such as Na+/H+ antiporters in the vacuolar membrane (Blumwald CITATION; Blumwald and Poole CITATION). It has been also reported that the SNARE complex plays an important role in the membrane fusion process (Lipka et al. CITATION), and SNARE proteins are involved in the control of ion transport (Leyman et al. CITATION). To determine whether or not the salt tolerance of AtSFT12 OXs is due to increased ion accumulation inside cells, we quantitatively measured the content of Na+ in WT plants, AtSFT12 OXs, and AtSFT12-2 mutants using ICP-AES. Na+ content in AtSFT12 OXs was significantly higher than in WT plants and AtSFT12-2 mutants after 150 mM NaCl treatment (Fig. 7a). This result suggests that AtSFT12 is involved in Na+ accumulation of Arabidopsis cells. [[FIGURE]]  To investigate the impact of AtSFT12 on subcellular localization of Na+ accumulation under salt stress condition, we monitored the distribution of Na+ in root cells after 100 mM NaCl treatment for 12 h using Na+-dependent fluorescence of Sodium Green, a cell-permeable sodium indicator. Sodium Green is not fluorescent in the apoplast but becomes fluorescent after entering the cell and binding to Na+ (Szmacinski and Lakowicz CITATION), and it has been used as a fluorescent indicator of Na+ in root vacuoles of Arabidopsis and wheat (Cuin et al. CITATION; Hamaji et al. CITATION; Mazel et al. CITATION). In response to 100 mM NaCl, Na+ accumulation in vacuoles of AtSFT12 OX cells was significantly higher than that in vacuoles of WT plant cells, whereas Na+ accumulation in vacuoles of AtSFT12-2 mutant cells was similar to that in vacuoles of WT plant cells (Fig. 7b). These results indicate that AtSFT12 is involved in accumulation of Na+ in vacuoles, conferring salt tolerance to Arabidopsis under salt stress conditions. It was reported that after high concentration of NaCl treatment, the vacuole markedly increases in volume without an increase in overall cell volume or cell division and vacuole occupies most of cell (Hamaji et al. CITATION). In addition, intracellular compartmentation of Na+ within vacuoles was found to have a decisive effect on plant salt tolerance (Apse et al. CITATION; Xiong et al. CITATION). Taken together, our results suggest that AtSTF12, a Golgi Qc-SNARE protein, is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses and functions in the salt stress response via the accumulation of Na+ in vacuoles.

!~MM~! All Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants used in this study were Columbia ecotype. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized, placed in the dark for 2 days at 4 °C, and germinated on agar plates as previously described (Park et al. CITATION). Seedlings were grown under short-day (SD) conditions (8-h light/16-h dark cycles) or long-day (LD) conditions (16-h light/8-h dark cycles) at 22 °C. To generate AtSFT12 overexpression vector, we amplified the entire ORF of AtSFT12 by PCR, followed by cloning into pFGL571 harboring a modified cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (Park et al. CITATION). The resulting plasmid pFGL1351 was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by the freeze–thaw method (Hofgen and Willmitzer CITATION), after which Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral-dipping method (Clough and Bent CITATION). Overexpressing transgenic plants (OXs) of AtSFT12 were selected on MS medium containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin. T3 or T4 homozygous plants were used for the phenotypic investigation. To generate synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP)-fusion constructs, the entire ORF of AtSFT12 was cloned into sGFP-containing vector driven by a modified CaMV 35S promoter in frame with sGFP (Park et al. CITATION). Rosette leaves of plants grown on soil for 4 weeks were ground with liquid nitrogen. Total genomic DNA was isolated by CTAB methods (Murray and Thomson CITATION). To isolate flanking sequences around the T-DNA insertion site in AT1362, modified thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) was performed (Liu et al. CITATION). T-DNA border-specific primer (LB) and a pool of four arbitrary degenerate primers (ADs) were used for TAIL-PCR (Supplementary Table S1). First round of TAIL-PCR was performed in 20 μl of solution with 1 μl of Arabidopsis genomic DNA, 25 pmol each of LB1 and AD primers, 0.5 mM dNTP, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Solgent, Korea), and 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer. Second-round TAIL-PCR was performed in 50 μl of solution containing 1 μl of the first-round TAIL-PCR product, 25 pmol each of LB2 and AD primers, 0.5 mM dNTP, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Solgent, Korea), and 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer. The PCR products were isolated and purified by gel extractions kit (COSMO, Korea) and sequenced. For NaCl treatment, 7-day-old seedlings were grown under SD conditions and then transferred to MS agar medium with 0, 130, 140, 150, or 160 mM NaCl. For LiCl treatment, 7-day-old seedlings were transferred onto MS agar plates supplemented with 0, 15, 17.5, 20, or 25 mM LiCl. For mannitol treatment, 7-day-old seedlings were transferred to MS agar medium supplemented with 0, 350, 400, 450, or 500 mM mannitol. For MV treatment, 7-day-old seedlings were transferred onto MS agar plates containing 1, 1.5, 2, or 2.5 μM MV. Responses to NaCl, LiCl, mannitol, and MV were estimated by measuring the fresh weight (FW) of seedlings after 14 days of treatment. For water loss measurements, shoots of 4-week-old plants were detached from their roots and weighed immediately. Each shoot was then placed on a plate on a laboratory bench and weighed at designated time intervals. For stress treatments prior to quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses, 10-day-old WT seedlings on MS plates were transferred onto filter papers saturated with 300 mM NaCl, followed by incubation for 0, 2, 4, or 8 h. For cold treatment, 10-day-old WT seedlings were kept at 4 °C for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. For abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, 10-day-old WT seedlings were transferred onto filter papers saturated with 100 μM ABA, followed by incubation for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. For mannitol treatment, 10-day-old seedlings were transferred onto filter papers saturated with 400 mM mannitol for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. For MV treatment, 10-day-old WT seedlings were transferred onto filter papers saturated with 10 μM MV, followed by incubation for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center). cDNA synthesis as well as quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were performed as previously described (Park et al. CITATION). The primers used for PCRs are shown in Supplementary Table S1. To investigate the subcellular localization of AtSFT12 in Arabidopsis protoplasts, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protoplast transformations were performed according to the method described by Sheen (CITATION). CD3-968 (TAIR stock number) harboring 1–49 aa of soybean α-1,2-mannosidase I (GmMan1) fused to mCherry was used as a Golgi marker (Nelson et al. CITATION; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al. CITATION). Ten-day-old plants grown on MS media under SD conditions were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 2 days, dried at 100 °C for 2 h, and then powdered to determine dry weights of the samples. The samples were prepared by dissolving in mixed acid. After filtration, sample solutions were diluted appropriately with deionized water for ICP-AES measurement. Analytical measurement of Na+ content was performed using an ICP-AES (ACTIVA-S, HORIBA Jobin–Yvon, France) at the Busan branch of the Korea Basic Science Institute. For detection of Na+ in cells, 2 mM stock solution of Sodium Green™ tetraacetate (Invitrogen, USA) was prepared with 10 % (w/v) solution of Pluronic F-127 in DMSO and diluted into loading buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, 85 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0). Eight-day-old plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl for 12 h and then transferred onto filter papers saturated with 2 μM Sodium Green loading buffer solution for 30 min. The specimens were then examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510NLO, CarlZeiss, Germany). Excitation wavelength of 507 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm were used to visualize signals of Sodium Green staining.
