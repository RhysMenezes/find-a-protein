!~ABS~! Previously, a dysfunction of the SMALL ACIDIC PROTEIN1 (SMAP1) gene was identified as the cause of the anti-auxin resistant1 (aar1) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). SMAP1 is involved in the response pathway of synthetic auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and functions upstream of the auxin/indole-3-acetic acid protein degradation step in auxin signaling. However, the exact mechanism by which SMAP1 functions in auxin signaling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SMAP1 is required for normal plant growth and development and the root response to indole-3-acetic acid or methyl jasmonate in the auxin resistant1 (axr1) mutation background. Deletion analysis and green fluorescent protein/glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that SMAP1 physically interacts with the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC9 SIGNALOSOME (CSN) via the SMAP1 F/D region. The extremely dwarf phenotype of the aar1-1 csn5a-1 double mutant confirms the functional role of SMAP1 in plant growth and development under limiting CSN functionality. Our findings suggest that SMAP1 is involved in the auxin response and possibly in other cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase-regulated signaling processes via its interaction with components associated with RELATED TO UBIQUITIN modification.
!~RES~! To investigate the relationship between aar1 and other known auxin mutants, we crossed the aar1-1 mutant with various mutants in the auxin signaling pathway: tir1-1, a mutant of an auxin receptor (CITATION); ecr1-1, a mutant of a subunit of the RUB-activating enzyme E1 (CITATION); axr1-12, a mutant of another subunit of the RUB-activating enzyme E1 (CITATION); and aar3-2, a mutant of a DCN1-like gene (CITATION). Then we attempted to establish double mutants. aar1-1 tir1-1, aar1-1 ecr1-1, and aar1-1 aar3-2 double mutants were successfully obtained. However, the axr1-12 aar1-1 mutant showed severe morphological defects; nearly one-quarter of the offspring from the AXR1/axr1-12 aar1-1 parents did not germinate or died at the early seedling stage without developing roots (Figs. 1, A–F, and 2, A and B). Genotyping with PCR markers confirmed that the rootless siblings were axr1-12 aar1-1 double mutants (data not shown). In normal embryos, the hypophysis divides asymmetrically and forms a quiescent center in the root meristem. Formation of an auxin gradient is required for this process, which can be readily visualized by the authentic auxin reporter DR5rev:GFP (CITATION). However, in the abnormal embryos, neither the formation of a quiescent center nor GFP expression was observed at the position where descendants of hypophyseal cells should be located (Fig. 1, B–E), suggesting that axr1-12 aar1-1 lacks normal auxin response. The axr1-12 aar1-1 double mutant also showed severe morphological defects in the aerial parts. For example, venation was poorly developed compared with that in axr1-12 (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the effect of the aar1 mutation is substantial in the axr1-12 background. Similar abnormal seedlings or ungerminated seeds were observed in the descendants of AXR1/axr1-3 aar1-1 or AXR1-12/axr1-12 aar1-2 parental lines (Fig. 2, C–F), suggesting that the abnormal phenotype in double mutants is not allele dependent. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The aar1-1 mutation has an approximately 44-kb deletion in chromosome 4; this deleted region contains at least 10 open reading frames, including SMAP1 (CITATION). Therefore, the abnormal phenotype could be caused by the lack of other genes rather than SMAP1. To eliminate this possibility, we crossed axr1-12 with two independent transgenic lines harboring a 3.7-kp BamHI/SacI genomic DNA fragment containing the SMAP1 open reading frame (gSMAP1). As shown in Figures 1A and 2, G to I, the seedling population AXR1/axr1-12 aar1-1 gSMAP1 lines showed no rootless offspring, in contrast to the line harboring the control genomic fragment (X/B). In reverse, the homozygous offspring of the AXR1/axr1-12 heterozygous parental lines harboring the SMAP1 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were rootless (Fig. 2, J–N). Taken together, these results suggest that SMAP1 is necessary for root meristem formation and normal embryo development in the axr1 background. We successfully obtained the double mutants aar1-1 tir1-1, aar1-1 ecr1-1, and aar1-1 aar3-2. Most of these double mutants did not show any severe morphological defects compared with their parental lines (data not shown). However, approximately 10% of seedlings from the aar1-1 ecr1-1 parent showed a rootless phenotype similar to that of the axr1 aar1 double mutants (Fig. 2Z). The root elongation assay against 2,4-D revealed that the double mutants aar1-1 tir1-1, aar1-1 ecr1-1, and aar1-1 aar3-2 are more resistant compared with their corresponding single mutants, suggesting an additive relationship between the aar1-1 mutation and the auxin-related mutations tir1-1, ecr1-1, and aar3-2 for regulating the root auxin response (Fig. 1G). SMAP1 was fused to GFP and expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (35S:SMAP1-GFP or 35S:GFP-SMAP1) in aar1-1 plants. The expression of fusion proteins in the transgenic lines restored wild-type sensitivity to PCIB and 2,4-D in the aar1-1 roots, suggesting that the SMAP1-GFP and GFP-SMAP1 fusion proteins are functionally active (Supplemental Fig. S1). The mature 35S:SMAP1-GFP or 35S:GFP-SMAP1 (collectively designated as 35S:SMAP1∼GFP) transgenic Arabidopsis plants were morphologically indistinguishable from nontransgenic plants in either the wild-type or aar1-1 background (data not shown). When 35S:SMAP1∼GFP was introduced into the axr1-12 background (35S:SMAP1-GFP/axr1-12 or 35S:GFP-SMAP1/axr1-12), morphological phenotypes of axr1-12 such as dwarfism, reduced apical dominance, protruding pistils, and low fertility (CITATION) were partially alleviated (Fig. 3A). In a root growth assay, the axr1-12 mutant is strongly resistant to auxin and other plant hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA; CITATION; CITATION). The introduction of 35S:SMAP1∼GFP also partially restored the 2,4-D sensitivity of axr1-12 roots (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, although the aar1 mutant is reported to be a 2,4-D-specific response mutant (CITATION), the sensitivity of 35S:SMAP1∼GFP/axr1-12 to IAA (Fig. 3C) and methyl jasmonate (Fig. 3D) was intermediate between that of the wild type and axr1-12, suggesting that in the absence of functional AXR1, SMAP1 function is required for normal IAA and JA responses. [[FIGURE]] Unexpectedly, unlike the SMAP1 genomic fragment, SMAP1∼GFP fusion constructs expressed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter did not effectively recover the rootless phenotype of the axr1 aar1 double mutant (Fig. 2, O–W). Although we established homozygous axr1-12 aar1-1 35S:SMAP1-GFP (line 1H) and axr1-12 aar1-1 35S:GFP-SMAP1 (line 2B) lines by crossing, many seeds from these lines did not germinate, and most of those that did germinate were rootless (Fig. 2, Q and S). This may be due to the low expression level of SMAP1-GFP at the early stage of embryo development, which could not complement the loss of the SMAP1 gene from hypophyseal initial cells. GFP expression was hardly detected in the globular embryos of the two 35S:SMAP1-GFP lines (Supplemental Fig. S2). The transgene of SMAP1-GFP under the control of the SMAP1 promoter (SMAP:SMAP1-GFP line 1D) that was strongly expressed (as observed by GFP fluorescence) in the lower part of the globular embryo (Supplemental Fig. S2) effectively rescued the morphological defects in the axr1-12 aar1-1 double mutants (Fig. 2X). Another independent line of SMAP1:SMAP1-GFP (line 1B) that showed low-level GFP expression in the globular embryo did not recover the root development in axr1-12 aar1-1 double mutant background (Fig. 2Y; Supplemental Fig. S2). This suggests that strong SMAP1 expression in the globular stage embryo is required to establish root initial organization in the axr1-12 background. To investigate the functional aspects of the SMAP1 protein, we constructed several versions of SMAP1 derivatives, including those with deleted versions of the conserved F/D region, fused to GFP, under the control of the SMAP1 promoter (approximately 5 kb; Fig. 4A). These constructs were transformed into the aar1-1 mutant, and their ability to complement the aar1 mutation was investigated (Fig. 4, B–D). The GFP fluorescence of the fusion proteins was detected in both nuclei and the cytosol (Supplemental Fig. S3). [[FIGURE]] The aar1 mutant is resistant to the anti-auxin PCIB and the synthetic auxin 2,4-D and exhibits long hypocotyl when grown in the light (CITATION). As shown in Figure 4, B to D, independent transgenic lines harboring SMAP1-GFP in the aar1 background recovered sensitivities to PCIB (Fig. 4B) and 2,4-D (Fig. 4C) and showed similar hypocotyl length to that of the wild type (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the SMAP1-GFP fusion protein is functional. The construct SMAP1ΔF/D-GFP, which contained a deleted version of the F/D-rich region, did not complement the aar1 mutation, although the fusion protein was expressed in the transgenic lines as confirmed by GFP fluorescence. This finding implies that the F/D region is necessary for SMAP1 function. The N-terminal deletion construct D1, in which one-third of the N-terminal amino acids were deleted, was still able to complement the aar1 phenotype. However, the D2 and D3 constructs, which consisted of 26 and 18 C-terminal amino acids, respectively, did not complement the aar1 phenotype, suggesting that the F/D-rich region alone is not sufficient for SMAP1 function. Using the transgenic plants described above, we next attempted to identify SMAP1-interacting proteins in Arabidopsis extracts. Total proteins were extracted from SMAP1-GFP, SMAP1ΔF/D-GFP, and GFP lines using a nondenaturing extraction buffer and subjected to pull-down assays using anti-GFP microbeads. The purified GFP- and/or SMAP1-binding proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to silver staining and western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 5A). Silver staining revealed that seven distinct bands are present in the SMAP1-GFP extract but absent in the SMAP1ΔF/D-GFP extract, suggesting that the proteins present in these bands are possibly SMAP1-interacting proteins (Fig. 5A). These proteins were digested by trypsin, eluted from the gel, and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A Mascot database search of the resulting MS/MS spectra identified the proteins as CSN1, CSN2, CSN3, CSN4, CYTOSOLIC GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE2 (GAPC2), CSN5A, and CSN8 (Fig. 5A; Table I). Of all the identified proteins, six out of seven were subunits of the large CSN complex (approximately 321.3 kD) that typically consists of eight subunits (CITATION). Taken together, these results suggest that SMAP1 physically interacts with CSN in Arabidopsis extracts and that this interaction requires the presence of the F/D region. [[FIGURE]] To further elucidate the interaction between SMAP1 and CSN, we established an in vitro binding assay with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 5B). The GST-tagged SMAP1 protein and its derivatives (GST-SMAP1, GST-SMAP1ΔF/D, GST-F/D, and GST) extracted from E. coli were immobilized to glutathione columns. Total proteins extracted from the Arabidopsis aar1-1 mutant were added to these columns. Candidate interacting proteins as well as the GST fusion proteins themselves were eluted from the columns by SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Coomassie blue staining and western-blot analysis with an anti-CSN4 antibody (Fig. 5B). The results showed that GST-SMAP1 and GST-F/D but not GST-SMAP1ΔF/D or GFP pulled down CSN4 protein from the aar1-1 extracts, suggesting that the F/D region of SMAP1 is necessary and sufficient for the interaction between SMAP1 and CSN. CSN was originally identified through the biochemical characterization of the COP9 protein complex (CITATION; CITATION), which plays a significant role in regulating photomorphogenesis and postembryo development in Arabidopsis (CITATION). Furthermore, auxin responses are partially impaired in csn mutants (CITATION). To investigate the interaction between SMAP1 and CSN at the genetic level, we crossed the aar1-1 mutant with the weak csn mutant csn5a-1 and established a line harboring homozygous aar1-1 and heterozygous csn5a-1 (aar1-1 CSN5A/csn5a-1). In the seedling population from the aar1-1 CSN5A/csn5a-1 parental line, both in light- and dark-grown conditions, we observed distinct segregation of dwarf seedlings readily distinguishable from either aar1-1 or csn5a-1 seedlings (70 dwarf seedlings out of 363 light-grown seedlings; χ2 = 6.33, P > 0.01; Fig. 6, A and B; Supplemental Fig. S4B). Genotyping analyses confirmed that these dwarf plants are the aar1-1 csn5a-1 double mutant (data not shown). The longer hypocotyl phenotype of aar1 was suppressed by the csn5a mutation. In fact, the double mutant showed an extreme short hypocotyl phenotype. Similarly, a slower root growth phenotype was found in the double mutant, although the growth of the roots of aar1-1 and csn5a-1 is comparable to the wild type (Fig. 6A; Supplemental Fig. S4A). In addition, the double mutant showed 2,4-D resistance for root growth like its parental lines (Fig. 6C). The aar1-1 csn5a-1 plants at the rosette stage also showed an extremely small seedling phenotype (Fig. 6D), and most of the plants died before producing seeds (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] When the 35S:SMAP1-GFP (line 1H) gene was introduced into the aar1-1 csn5a-1 background (35S:SMAP1-GFP/aar1-1csn5a-1) by crossing, normal hypocotyl length was restored (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that the lack of the SMAP1 gene is associated with the extreme dwarf hypocotyl phenotype of the aar1-1 csn5a-1 double mutant. When the seedlings were transferred from agar plates and further grown on soil, the morphology of the 35S:SMAP1-GFP/aar1-1csn5a-1 plant was intermediate between that of the wild type and the csn5a-1 mutant (Fig. 6E; Supplemental Fig. S4C), suggesting that the ectopic expression of the SMAP1 gene not only complemented the aar1-1 phenotype but also partially compensated the morphological abnormalities of the csn5a-1 mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that SMAP1 is required for the normal development of seedlings under limiting CSN activity. The results from two independent experimental approaches implied that SMAP1 interacts with the RUB modification-related factors AXR1 and CSN. Thus, we next examined the RUB modification status of the CUL1 protein, which is a core subunit of SCF E3 ligase and one of the most characterized RUB-modified proteins, in the double mutants and transgenic lines by western blotting using anti-CUL1 antibody (Fig. 7). As previously published, the ratio of RUB-modified and unmodified CUL1 is lower in axr1-12 and higher in csn5a-1 compared with that in the wild type (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). No significant difference was observed in RUB modification depending on the presence or absence of the SMAP1 gene, except that a slight increase in RUB-modified CUL1 ratio was detected in the flower extracts of transgenics harboring 35S:SMAP1∼GFP in the axr1-12 background (Fig. 7B). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) lines aar1-1 and aar1-2 (CITATION), aar3-2 (CITATION), axr1-3 and axr1-12 (CITATION), tir1-1 (CITATION), ecr1-1 (CITATION), csn5a-1 (CITATION), and DR5rev:GFP (CITATION) were described previously. The SMAP1 RNAi lines (520i), the transgenic lines transformed with the 3.7-kb SMAP1 genomic fragment (B/S; described as gSMAP1 in this report) in the aar1-1 background, and its control line (X/B) were described by CITATION. 35S:SMAP1-GFP/aar1-1, 35S:GFP-SMAP1/aar1-1, SMAP1:SMAP1-GFP/aar1-1, and their derivative lines were generated in this work as described below. All transgenic and mutant lines were derived from the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis except for aar1-2, which is in the Wassilewskija background. The AAR1 locus was genotyped by PCR using primers T6G15 9538F and T6G15 53634R to detect the DNA deletion in the aar1-1 genome and primers T6G15 24488F and AT4G1 3490F2 to detect the presence of the corresponding wild-type DNA. For aar1-2, the mutant locus was tracked by the kanamycin-resistant phenotype resulting from the NPTII gene in the transgene construct (CITATION). The aar3-2 mutation was genotyped using the primers K5K13 F38890 and K5K13 R39225 to detect the wild-type gene and primers K5K13 F38890 and LB1 to detect the T-DNA. The tir1-1 mutation was detected by PCR amplification using the primers TIR1gF547 and TIR1gR913, and the amplified product was digested with DpnII, which cuts mutant but not wild-type products. The axr1-12 mutation was detected by PCR with the primers AXR1-12F and AXR1-12R, and the amplified product was digested with DraI, which cuts mutant but not wild-type products. For csn5a-1, the primers CSN5A-1F and CSN5A-1R2 were used to detect the wild-type locus and the primers CSN5A-1F and LBb1 were used to detect the mutation. The primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1. The ecr1-1 and axr1-3 mutations were detected by derived cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence analysis as described by CITATION. Seed sterilization and plant growth conditions were as described by CITATION. Briefly, seeds were plated on germination medium (GM; one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts, 1% [w/v] Suc, and 0.5 g L–1 MES, pH 5.8, containing 1× B5 vitamins and 0.8% [w/v] Bacto agar) in rectangular plates, unless otherwise mentioned. For synchronous germination, the seeds were kept in the dark for 2 d at 4°C, and then the plates were transferred to a growth chamber at 23°C. For the hypocotyl and root growth assays, the plants were grown vertically on square culture plates under continuous white light (20–30 µmol m–2 s–1). For transfer assays, seedlings were first grown on GM without plant growth regulators and then transferred after 4 to 5 d to fresh GM containing plant growth regulators. For the IAA root inhibition assay, seedlings were transferred onto GM 1.2 (the same as GM except that the agar concentration is 1.2% to prevent roots from penetrating into the agar). The hypocotyl and root lengths were analyzed using the NIH ImageJ software package (National Institutes of Health) after the plants were photographed with a DP50 digital camera (Olympus). The percentage of root growth inhibition was calculated relative to root growth on medium without growth regulators. To observe the morphology of plants grown on soil, the seedlings were grown in a growth chamber (Biotron; LH-200-RDS, NK system) under a 16-h-light (100–130 µE m–2 s–1)/8-h-dark photoperiod at 23°C. All plasmids were constructed using standard recombinant DNA techniques, and their authenticity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SMAP1 DNA fragment was amplified from Arabidopsis bacterial artificial chromosome clone T6G15. The SMAP1:SMAP1-GFP fusion construct and its deleted versions were made by inserting appropriate DNA fragments into the binary vector pEGAD containing GFP and the nos terminator (CITATION). The 35S promoter was removed from pEGAD by digestion with SacI and AgeI, then an approximately 5-kb region of the SMAP1 promoter and the full or deleted version of SMAP1 coding sequences were inserted into the restriction enzyme sites. To generate 35S:SMAP1-GFP and 35S:GFP-SMAP1, SMAP1 coding sequences without or with the stop codon were amplified with the primer sets 13520ATG-topo/13520-TAA and 13520ATG-topo/13520R+TAA (Supplemental Table S1), respectively, and cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids, 13520-TAA ENTR or 13520+TAA ENTR, were assembled into the Gateway binary vector pK7FWG2 to generate 35S:SMAP1-GFP or into pK7WGF2 to generate 35S:GFP-SMAP1, respectively, by a site-specific recombination reaction between attL and attR sites (CITATION). For the in vitro pull-down assay, GST-SMAP1 and its derivatives were constructed with the pGEX4T-2 expression vector (GE Healthcare). Full details of plasmid construction are available on request. The resulting constructs in binary vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation and used to transform Arabidopsis Columbia with the floral-dip method (CITATION). T1 seeds obtained from infected plants were germinated and selected on GM containing the appropriate antibiotic for selection of the marker gene in the vectors. In the T2 generation, T1 lines that showed a segregation ratio of 1:3 for antibiotic sensitive/antibiotic resistant were selected, and antibiotic-resistant T2 seedlings were grown to harvest T3 seeds. T3 plants were expected to be offspring of T2 plants that were heterozygous or homozygous for the inserted gene. Therefore, T2 lines that gave rise to only antibiotic-resistant T3 plants were selected as homozygous lines. For observations of embryo morphology, siliques at different developmental stages were harvested, dissected using a stereoscope, and cleared in a derivative of Hoyer’s solution (chloral hydrate:glycerol:water, 8:1:2). Cleared ovules were removed from their siliques in a drop of the same clearing solution, mounted whole, and observed with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with Nomarski optics. Digital images were captured using an Olympus DP-50 digital camera. To detect GFP accumulation, embryos were dissected in 7% Glc, mounted whole, and then fluorescent signals in roots and embryos were detected using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000 with digital imaging processing) with a 515- ± 10-nm band-pass filter. For signal localization in embryos, images of GFP and transmitted light channels were electronically overlaid and further processed with Photoshop software (Adobe Systems). To detect SMAP1-GFP-binding proteins, we used a µMACS GFP isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Seven-day-old plants grown under continuous light were ground in liquid nitrogen and then ground in ice-cold elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and Protease Inhibitor Complete Mini [Roche Diagnostics]). The extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000g, and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe-driven filter unit with 0.45-µm pore size (Millipore). The solution containing 1 mg of total protein was mixed with magnetic anti-GFP microbeads and then incubated overnight to allow GFP to bind to anti-GFP microbeads. The mixture was transferred to a prewashed column containing magnetic beads, and then the column was washed four times with wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and once with wash buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to flush unbound proteins and excess salt. GFP and proteins bound to it were eluted with 50 µL of SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were heat denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel. The protein spots on the silver-stained gel were cut out and digested with trypsin (Promega). The digested peptides were analyzed by an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), and MS/MS spectra were compared against The Arabidopsis Information Resource 8 Arabidopsis genome annotation data using the Mascot server (Matrix Science). For the GST pull-down assay, Escherichia coli lines harboring the constructs were grown to an optical density at 595 nm of 0.5 to 0.6, and then the expression of fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.1 mm for 2 h. Extraction of fusion proteins and their immobilization to the glutathione column were performed using a GST-Spin Trap Purification Module kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The columns containing immobilized GST-SMAP1 fusion protein were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then flushed with ice-cold plant GST extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Protease Inhibitor Complete Mini [Roche Diagnostics]). Total protein was prepared from 7-d-old aar1-1 plants as described above for the GFP pull-down assay, except that plant GST extraction buffer was used, and applied to the columns. The columns were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and washed five times with 600 µL of plant GST extraction buffer. The GST and proteins bound to it were eluted with GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 10 mm glutathione), and 10 µg of the eluted protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. We used antibodies against GFP (1181446001; Roche Diagnostics) and CSN4 (PW8360; Enzo Life Sciences). For the Arabidopsis CUL1 antibody, the N-terminal region of CUL1 protein (380 amino acid residues of the N terminus of CUL1) was inserted into the pET16b vector (Novagen) and expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The insoluble protein fraction was solubilized in His-binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 6 m guanidine-HCl), bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, and 6 m guanidine-HCl), and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 6 m guanidine-HCl). The eluted protein was precipitated by the addition of 80% cold acetone, and then proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and purified by electroelution from the gel. The anti-CUL1 antibody was prepared from a rabbit injected with the purified CUL1 protein. For RUB modification analysis of CUL1, Arabidopsis seedlings or flowers were ground in lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaS2O3, 1% SDS, and 10% glycerol). The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant diluted 1:9 with water was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, run on SDS-PAGE gels, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (A3687; Sigma-Aldrich) as secondary antibody and nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Roche Diagnostics) were used. For densitometry analyses, the digital images of the blots were acquired by scanning the blots, and the peak intensity of the bands was determined by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The values of the ratio of RUB-modified CUL1 to total CUL1 (RUB-modified plus unmodified CUL1) were analyzed by Fisher’s lsd test in KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software).
