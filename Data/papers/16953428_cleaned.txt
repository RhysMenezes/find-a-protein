!~ABS~! The exon junction complex (EJC) plays an important role in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Mago nashi (Mago) and Y14 are core EJC proteins that operate as a functional unit in animal cells, and the Mago-Y14 heterodimer interacts with other EJC core and peripheral proteins. Little is known about the biochemical and cellular characteristics of the EJC and its orthologs in plants. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 form a ternary complex with PYM, an RNA-binding protein that was previously shown to interact with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer in Drosophila. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 are localized primarily in the nucleus, whereas PYM is mostly cytoplasmic. In vitro pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that the amino-terminal region of the Arabidopsis PYM interacts with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer, a similar observation to that previously reported for the animal versions of these proteins. However, we demonstrated also that Arabidopsis PYM has the ability to interact with monomeric Mago and monomeric Y14. Immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification from whole cell extracts detected a subtle interaction between the Arabidopsis Mago-Y14 heterodimer and PYM in flowers, indicating that the ternary complex is not abundant in plant cells. The regions of the polypeptide responsible for nuclear import and export were defined using protein truncations and site-directed mutagenesis. This study identifies unique characteristics of Arabidopsis Mago, Y14 and PYM compared to those observed in animal cells. These are predicted to have important functional implications associated with post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plant cells.
!~RES~! To determine if the Arabidopsis orthologs of Y14 and Mago (AtY14 and AtMago, Fig. 1) have the ability to form a heterodimer, as was observed for the animal versions of these proteins (Fribourg et al. CITATION), we carried out in vitro GST pull-down assays using purified recombinant GST-AtY14 chimeric protein and His-tagged AtMago (His-AtMago). GST alone did not bind to His-AtMago, however, a GST-AtY14/His-AtMago interaction was evident (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that the Mago-Y14 interaction is conserved in plant cells. Previous studies demonstrated that the human Mago-Y14 heterodimer interaction was disrupted by an arginine to leucine substitution (L118R, Fig. 1) in Y14 that lies within the region that interacts with Mago (Fribourg et al. CITATION). We designed a similar point mutation at the corresponding leucine of recombinant AtY14 (L140R, Fig. 1). A GST pull-down experiment using this mutated AtY14 indicated that the amino acid substitution did not prevent the formation of the AtY14-AtMago heterodimer in binding assays (Fig. 2a). The reduced amount of AtMago observed in the AtY14(L140R) pull-down product compared to the unmodified AtY14 (Fig. 2a) was due to a reduced amount of AtY14(L140R) ligand rather than a lower affinity binding of the mutated AtY14 protein to AtMago (Supplementary Fig. 1). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  To characterize the subcellular localization of AtY14 and AtMago, we co-expressed these proteins in onion epidermal cells as chimeras with intrinsically fluorescent proteins. Biolistic bombardment experiments using DNA constructs encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-AtMago chimera and a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-AtY14 chimera demonstrated that these two proteins co-localize within the cell. The fluorescence labeling of both fusion proteins was localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 2b). Close observation of the nuclear fluorescence attributable to GFP-AtMago and RFP-AtY14 showed that these proteins often appeared concentrated as puncta that were visible above background nucleoplasmic fluorescence. Co-expression of GFP-AtMago with the nuclear speckle marker SRp34 fused to RFP (SR-RFP, Lorkovic et al. CITATION) indicated that the nuclear puncta observed in GFP-AtMago expressing cells are associated with nuclear speckles (Fig. 2c). When the GFP-AtMago and GFP-AtY14 constructs were expressed in epidermal cells of fava bean (Vicia faba), the fluorescence pattern was consistent with that observed in onion epidermal cells (data not shown). The structure of the Mago-Y14 heterodimer surface is highly conserved among species, and serves as a binding site for PYM in animal cells (Fribourg et al. CITATION; Bono et al. CITATION). Using in vitro pull-down experiments we demonstrated that AtPYM interacts with the AtMago-AtY14 heterodimer (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2). Surprisingly, GST-AtPYM also interacted with monomeric AtMago and monomeric AtY14 (Fig. 3a), an interaction that was not observed for the animal versions of these proteins (Bono et al. CITATION). [[FIGURE]]  To gain insight into the specific regions of the AtPYM polypeptide that are important in its interaction with the AtMago-AtY14 heterodimer, we used a series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of AtPYM in pull-down assays with the heterodimer (Fig. 3b). For this experiment, bacterial cell cultures expressing His-AtMago and His-AtY14 were first incubated at 4°C to allow the heterodimer to form. Bacterial extracts expressing the various GST-PYM fusion proteins were then independently incubated with this mixture, and complexes were pulled-down using glutathione-agarose beads. Similar to the results presented in Fig. 3a, the full-length PYM protein bound avidly to the AtY14-AtMago heterodimer (Fig. 3c). The smallest of the truncated PYM polypeptides that bound to the Y14-Mago heterodimer was the 71 amino acid PYM polypeptide located at the amino-terminus of AtPYM (i.e., GST-AtPYM1). Other truncated versions of the protein that contained this region (i.e., AtPYM2 and AtPYM3) also bound to the AtY14-AtMago heterodimer (Fig. 3c). These results are similar to those described for the Y14-Mago binding region of Drosophila PYM, as a polypeptide consisting of the first 58 amino-terminal residues of PYM was shown to interact with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer in vitro (Bono et al. CITATION). We then conducted additional pull-down experiments to determine if any of the truncated AtPYM polypeptides could bind monomeric AtY14 and monomeric AtMago. When the purified GST-AtPYM truncated proteins were incubated with purified monomeric AtY14, those truncated proteins possessing the amino-terminal region of AtPYM (i.e., AtPYM1, 2 and 3) interacted with monomeric AtY14 (Fig. 3d). In addition, there was a small amount of AtY14 bound to AtPYM8, a polypeptide that contained the carboxyl-terminal region of PYM. When the various AtPYM truncations were incubated with monomeric AtMago (Fig. 3e), the observed binding patterns of these truncated proteins showed clear differences compared to pattern observed with the AtMago-AtY14 heterodimer (Fig. 3c). The truncated AtPYM polypeptide containing the amino-terminal 71 amino acids of AtPYM (AtPYM1) did not interact with AtMago monomer, whereas polypeptides AtPYM2 through AtPYM6 bound avidly, as did AtPYM8 (Fig. 3e). The central and carboxyl-terminal regions of AtPYM, therefore, appear to have affinity for monomeric AtMago, but not for the AtY14-AtMago heterodimer. The corresponding Coomassie blue stained gels of these pull-down experiments are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. We next determined the subcellular localization of AtPYM using immunofluorescence labeling and transient expression of a GFP-AtPYM fusion protein. When Arabidopsis suspension cells were incubated with antisera raised against AtPYM and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, the observed fluorescence signal was primarily cytosolic (Fig. 4a). In contrast, cells probed with antisera raised against AtY14 showed strong nuclear fluorescence, however, some cytosolic labeling was also apparent at levels that were above background (Fig. 4b). This was similar to the localization pattern of the RFP-AtY14 fusion protein in transformed onion epidermal cells (Fig. 2b). The cytosolic localization of AtPYM was apparent also in onion epidermal cells expressing a GFP-AtPYM fusion protein (Fig. 4c). When onion epidermal cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of CRM-1 mediated nuclear export (Strom and Weis CITATION); GFP-AtPYM accumulated within the nucleoplasm and was concentrated in the nucleolus (Fig. 4c). These observations indicate that AtPYM can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a net accumulation of protein in the cytoplasm. [[FIGURE]]  The shuttling of AtPYM between the cytosol and nucleus implies that AtPYM possesses regions that function in nuclear import and export, although a nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) has not been identified. In an effort to identify these regions, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncations of AtPYM described in the pull-down assays (Fig. 3b) were expressed in onion epidermal cells as fusions to the carboxyl-terminal end of RFP (Fig. 5a). LMB was applied to cells expressing these protein fusions as a means to block nuclear export in order to more accurately define these regions. RFP alone was distributed diffusely in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and showed a similar localization pattern after LMB treatment (Fig. 5b). RFP-AtPYM showed a similar cytosolic localization and LMB effect as cells shown in Fig. 4c, however, the other fusion proteins showed variable localization patterns (summarized in Fig. 5a). The results of these deletion experiments suggested that AtPYM1 (1–71) and AtPYM4 (72–120) are impaired in their nuclear import, as these proteins were enriched in the cytosol and did not accumulate extensively in the nucleus upon LMB treatment. Compared to the full-length RFP-AtPYM, the somewhat higher amount of nuclear localization of these proteins in cells that were not treated with LMB may be the result of an increased diffusion of this protein into the nucleus due to their smaller size. AtPYM6, AtPYM7 and AtPYM8 appeared also to demonstrate a reduced level of import, as LMB had some effect on export from the nucleus, however, a substantial amount of protein remained in the cytosol after LMB treatment. In contrast, the deletions in AtPYM2, AtPYM3, and AtPYM5 appear disrupted in a region containing a NES, as these proteins accumulated in the nucleus in cells that were not treated with LMB. This indicated that the PYM NES is located within the carboxyl-terminus of the protein, between amino acids 171 and 205. [[FIGURE]]  Along with these deletion mapping data, we used a web-based search tool to further assist in pinpointing the NLS and NES. PredictNLS (http://www.cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictNLS/) identified a bipartite NLS that was located between amino acids 81 and 98 (Fig. 1). This region was not present in AtPYM1 (1–71), a truncated polypeptide that was impaired in its nuclear localization when fused to RFP (Fig. 5b). To determine if this putative NLS is essential for AtPYM import into the nucleus, point mutations were introduced into this region to produce two mutated versions of the RFP-AtPYM expression vector. The first possessed a substitution of two proximal lysine residues (i.e., K81 and K83) with alanine residues, and the second resulted in the substitution of two distal lysine residues (i.e., K93 and K94) with alanine residues (Fig. 1). These mutated expression vectors were then bombarded individually into onion epidermal cells. Surprisingly, neither of these mutations blocked the import of these proteins into the nucleus, as LMB treatment resulted in the accumulation of protein in the nucleus (data not shown). When all four point mutations were introduced together into the AtPYM coding region (i.e., K81, K83, K93, K94), this protein also had the ability to localize to the nucleus, as demonstrated by LMB treatment (Fig. 5c). Together, these results indicate that this predicted NLS sequence is not necessary, or has minimal influence, on the import of PYM into the nucleus, and that there are other regions within the AtPYM polypeptide that are important for nuclear import. Next we attempted to more clearly define the AtPYM NES. The web-based NES predictor NetNES (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNES/) identified two potential NES sequences in the PYM polypeptide. Both are located near the carboxyl-terminus (i.e., amino acids 159–165 and 195–200, Fig. 1), however, only the more distal sequence resides within the NES region mapped in the deletion experiments (Fig. 5b). Site directed mutagenesis of the two putative NES region generated two amino acid substitutions in each region (Fig. 1). Mutations in the more proximal region (L159A and K160A) did not prevent RFP-AtPYM from exiting the nucleus. However, mutations in the distal region (L196A and L199A) resulted in an accumulation of RFP-AtPYM in the nucleus in the absence of LMB treatment (Fig. 5c). This demonstrates that the distal region (amino acids 195–200) contains a functional NES sequence. Two approaches were used to determine if the AtMago-AtY14-AtPYM ternary complex is detectable in plant protein extracts. The first utilized transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed AtMago fused downstream of the TAP tag (Rohila et al. CITATION). The TAP-tag consisted of a cleavable protein-A domain and a calmodulin-binding domain. The TAP method has been successfully used to purify protein complexes from several species (Rigaut et al. CITATION; Rohila et al. CITATION). The second approach involved immunoprecipitation of AtY14 and AtPYM from leaf extracts using antibodies raised against these proteins. TAP purified protein fractions from TAP-AtMago transgenic leaves contained TAP-AtMago as well as AtY14 (Fig. 6a). However, there was no evidence that AtPYM was present in these fractions as determined by immunoblot analysis. This observation was corroborated by immunoprecipitation of endogenous AtY14 and AtPYM and their associated proteins from wild type Arabidopsis leaf extracts. Protein fractions immunoprecipitated with anti-AtY14 antibodies contained both AtMago and AtY14, but not AtPYM (Fig. 6b). Conversely, proteins immunoprecipitated with AtPYM antibodies contained AtPYM, but not AtMago or AtY14 (Fig. 6b). Identical immunoprecipitation results were observed using protein extracts from Arabidopsis cell suspensions (data not shown). [[FIGURE]]  The absence of a detectable AtPYM interaction with the AtMago-AtY14 heterodimer in leaf tissue and cell suspension prompted us to examine whether this interaction was evident in another tissue type. A search of the on-line Arabidopsis microarray expression data (Genvestigator, Zimmermann et al. CITATION) indicated that AtPYM mRNA is most abundant in pollen. We then conducted an immunoprecipitation experiment using protein extract from Arabidopsis flowers that contained mature anthers. When the AtPYM antibody was used in these pull-down experiments, a small amount of AtY14 protein was consistently detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, we were unable to detect AtPYM protein in the reciprocal immunoprecipitation eluent produced using AtY14 antibody-coated beads (Fig. 6c). These data demonstrate that the AtMago-AtY14-AtPYM ternary complex does indeed exist in plant cells, but to a limited and perhaps tissue specific extent. The absence of AtY14 in the AtPYM antibody precipitate is surprising, but could be explained by the fact that the floral AtPYM mRNA abundance is lower on a molar basis than AtY14 and AtMago mRNA (Genvestigator, Zimmermann et al. CITATION). Therefore, a larger proportion of the total AtPYM protein pool might be a component of the AtMago-AtY14-AtPYM ternary complex than that of the total AtY14 protein pool.
!~MM~! PCR was used to generate full-length or truncated versions of Arabidopsis Mago, Y14 and PYM coding regions (AtMago, AtY14 and AtPYM, Genbank accessions AY065157, NM_104029 and BT004216, respectively, provided by RIKEN BRC)(Seki et al. CITATION, CITATION). These PCR products were used for the production of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) or histidine tag (6×-His) protein fusions in E. coli, and for the transient expression of GFP or RFP fusions in plant cells. To construct the GST and 6×-His fusions to AtMago, AtY14 and AtPYM, the PCR products were cloned into pGEX5X-1 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) or pQE30 (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), respectively, and expressed in E. coli strains BL21 or DH5α. The AtY14 amino acid substitution, L140R, was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following primers were used in the PCR reactions: AtMago-BamHI, TCACACGGATCCCTGCCGCGGAAGAAGCGACG; AtMago-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACCTAGATAGGCTTGATTTTGAA; AtY14-BamHI, TCACACGGATCCCTGCGAACATAGAATCAGAA; AtY14-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCAGTAACGTCTTCTCGGACT; AtPYM-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTGGAAGCAGAAGCGGAGAA; AtPYM1-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCTAGATTAAGGCCCTTGTGAGGCCAT; AtPYM2-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTCCAGGTTATGAACCTGAT; AtPYM3-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCTAGATTACACCGATTGGGATCCATT; AtPYM4-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTAATGTATTGGCTTCTGAA; AtPYM5-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCTAGATTACTGTTGAGCTTCTGTGAG; AtPYM6-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTCAGAAGACTGCTTCCCGA; AtPYM-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTTAAGCCGCCTTATC. The primers were used to amplify coding regions for the full-length AtMago (AtMago-BamHI and AtMago-SalI), AtY14 (AtY14-BamHI and AtY14-SalI), AtPYM (AtPYM-BglII and AtPYM-SalI), and the truncations AtPYM1 (AtPYM-BglII and AtPYM1-SalI), AtPYM2 (AtPYM-BglII and AtPYM3-SalI), AtPYM3 (AtPYM-BglII and AtPYM5-SalI), AtPYM4 (AtPYM2-BglII and AtPYM3-SalI), AtPYM5 (AtPYM2-BglII and AtPYM5-SalI), AtPYM6 (AtPYM2-BglII and AtPYM-SalI), AtPYM7 (AtPYM4-BglII and AtPYM5-SalI), AtPYM8 (AtPYM4-BglII and AtPYM–SalI) and AtPYM9 (AtPYM2-BglII and AtPYM-SalI). AtMago-BamHI, TCACACGGATCCCTGCCGCGGAAGAAGCGACG; AtMago-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACCTAGATAGGCTTGATTTTGAA; AtY14-BamHI, TCACACGGATCCCTGCGAACATAGAATCAGAA; AtY14-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCAGTAACGTCTTCTCGGACT; AtPYM-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTGGAAGCAGAAGCGGAGAA; AtPYM1-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCTAGATTAAGGCCCTTGTGAGGCCAT; AtPYM2-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTCCAGGTTATGAACCTGAT; AtPYM3-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCTAGATTACACCGATTGGGATCCATT; AtPYM4-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTAATGTATTGGCTTCTGAA; AtPYM5-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTCTAGATTACTGTTGAGCTTCTGTGAG; AtPYM6-BglII, TCACACAGATCTCTCAGAAGACTGCTTCCCGA; AtPYM-SalI, AGAGCGGTCGACTTAAGCCGCCTTATC. For the production of GFP-AtMago, RFP-AtY14 and RFP-AtPYM that were used in the plant cell transient expression assays, the following primers were used in the PCR reactions: AtMago5′-XbaI TCACACTCTAGAGCCGCGGAAGAAGCGACG AtMago3′-XbaI AGAGCGTCTAGACTAGATAGGCTTGATTTTGAA AtY14-BglII TCACACAGATCTGCGAACATAGAATCAGAAGCA AtY14-XbaI AGAGCGTCTAGATTAGTAACGTCTTCTCGGACT AtPYM-BglII TCACACAGATCTCTGGAAGCAGAAGCGGAGAA AtPYM-XbaI AGAGCGTCTAGATTAAGCCGCCTTATC. These primers were used to amplify the coding regions of AtMago (AtMago5′-XbaI and AtMago3′-XbaI), AtY14 (AtY14-BglII and AtY14-XbaI), and AtPYM (AtPYM-BglII and AtPYM-XbaI). The AtMago PCR product was cloned into XbaI site of pRTL2ΔNS/GFP (Chuong et al. CITATION), and the AtY14 and AtPYM PCR products were cloned into the BglII and XbaI sites of pRTL2ΔNS/RFP (McCartney et al. CITATION). Both the pRTL2ΔNS/GFP and pRTL2ΔNS/RFP expression vectors contain the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and nopaline synthase terminator sequences. The amino acid substitutions in RFP-PYM used to characterize the nuclear localization and export signals were produced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). AtMago5′-XbaI TCACACTCTAGAGCCGCGGAAGAAGCGACG AtMago3′-XbaI AGAGCGTCTAGACTAGATAGGCTTGATTTTGAA AtY14-BglII TCACACAGATCTGCGAACATAGAATCAGAAGCA AtY14-XbaI AGAGCGTCTAGATTAGTAACGTCTTCTCGGACT AtPYM-BglII TCACACAGATCTCTGGAAGCAGAAGCGGAGAA AtPYM-XbaI AGAGCGTCTAGATTAAGCCGCCTTATC. The GST and 6×-His fusion protein constructs were expressed in E. coli by induction with 0.2 mM IPTG for 4 h at 37°C. Recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) or Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For GST pull-down assays, 5 μg of purified GST-tagged recombinant protein (either AtY14 or AtPYM) was incubated with 5 μg of His-tagged protein in binding buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol) for 3 h at 4°C. Alternatively, crude extracts (in binding buffer) from bacterial cells expressing His-AtMago and His-AtPYM were mixed and incubated at 4°C for one hr to allow AtMago-AtY14 heterodimers to form. To the mixture was added extract from cells expressing full-length or truncated GST-AtPYM, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h. For protein complex pull-downs, glutathione-sepharose beads were added to the protein mixtures, followed by incubation for one hr at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by separation on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie blue staining, and the presence or absence of 6×-His-tagged proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-His-tag antibodies (Qiagen). Each of the immunoprecipitation experiments was repeated at least once. Transient expression of GFP and RFP fusion proteins was performed by biolistic bombardment into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells as described previously (Chuong et al. CITATION; Scott et al. CITATION). The plant nuclear speckle marker SRp34 (SR-RFP) (Lorkovic et al. CITATION) and nucleolar marker RFP-PRH75 (Lorkovic and Barta CITATION) were also used in bombardment experiments. For drug treatment, leptomycin B (LMB; LC laboratories, Woburn, MA) was dissolved in ethanol and applied to onion epidermal peels at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml in Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (pH 5.8). Subcellular localization determination of truncated versions of RFP-AtPYM was based on the observation of at least ten cells from two separate bombardment experiments for each of the RFP constructions. Peeled epidermal cell layers were mounted on a microscope slide in MS media or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), covered with a coverglass, and observed using either a Plan Fluotar 20× objective lens or a Plan Apo 63× oil immersion objective lens attached to an epifluorescence microscope (DMR; Leica, Germany). Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 1350 EX; QImaging, Burnaby, BC, Canada) through the FITC or rhodamine filter sets. Image capture, enhancement and deconvolution were performed using Openlab software (Version 3.0, Improvision, Lexington, MA), and the images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop software (Version 8.0, Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA).  Arabidopsis suspension cells were used for immunolocalization studies 3 days after the subculturing. Cell fixation and antibody incubation were performed as described previously (Chuong et al. CITATION). Anti-AtY14 and anti-AtPYM antisera were used at a dilution of 1:500. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used at a dilution of 1:300. Labeled cells suspended in PBS were observed by epifluorescence microscopy using the FITC filter set. Tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Mago expression constructs for transformation of Arabidopsis plants were produced using the following procedure. The Mago coding region was PCR amplified using 5′ and 3′ primers containing attL1 and attL2 recombination sites, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the resulting plasmid was used in a recombination reaction involving NTAP (Rohila et al. CITATION). NTAP is a pPZP200-based binary Agrobacterium vector that produces an amino-terminal TAP-tag fused to the coding region of interest, and uses the CaMV 35S promoter to drive expression of the insert (Rohila et al. CITATION). The resulting binary vector was introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation, and Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype C24) plants were transformed by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION). Plants were grown in growth chamber under 16 h light (24°C) and 8 h dark (20°C) periods for 8 weeks. Independent T1 transgenic lines were selected on 0.5 × MS medium (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Oakville, Canada) containing 1% sucrose and glufosinate ammonium (15 μg/ml), and self-pollinated to obtain homozygous lines. Protein extracts from transgenic Arabidopsis leaves expressing TAP fusion proteins were prepared by grinding leaf tissue in protein extraction buffer [20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL, 2.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μM leupeptin, 2 μg/mL aprotinin, 1 μM E-64 protease inhibitor (EMD, Biosciences, San Diego, CA)]. After centrifugation (17,000 rpm, 30 min, 4°C), the supernatant was incubated in a closed polyprep column (BioRad) with 100 μl IgG sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4°C for 2 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed with extraction buffer lacking protease inhibitors and equilibrated with TEV protease cleavage buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). The TAP-tagged proteins were released from the IgG beads by enzymatic cleavage with 50 units of rTEV protease (Invitrogen) at 16°C for 2 h. The eluant was diluted with calmodulin binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Mg-acetate, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1 mM DTT) and incubated with 50 μl calmodulin affinity beads (Stratagene) for 2 h at 4°C, with gentle rotation. The proteins that bound to calmodulin beads were released by batch elution with cleavage buffer containing 20 mM EGTA. The eluant was precipitated with TCA and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (BioRad). For immunoprecipitation experiments, crude protein extract was isolated from wild type Arabidopsis leaf tissue, cell suspension and flowers. One hundred μl of protein A-sepharose beads (Sigma) were washed with PBS, and 500 μl of crude antiserum was added to the beads and mixed for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed with 0.2 M sodium borate (pH 9.0) and mixed with 20 mM dimethyl pimelidate (DMP) for 2 h at room temperature. Following this incubation period, the beads were washed with 0.2 M Tris (pH 8.0) overnight at 4°C, followed by three washes with PBS. The beads were stored at 4°C in PBS containing 0.02% of sodium azide. Total protein was extracted from 20 g of Arabidopsis leaf tissue or 70 g of Arabidopsis suspension cells. Protein from suspension cells was isolated in extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 200 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μM leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) using a French press. Leaf tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a pestle and morter, and then further ground in extraction buffer. The lysates were filtered with miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 1500× g for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the clarified extract was pre-cleared with 50 μl protein A-sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of antibody-coated beads overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation. The beads were washed five times with extraction buffer and eluted with two−50 μl volumes of 100 mM glycine (pH 2.5). After elution, the solution was neutralized with 10 μl of 1 M Tris (pH 9.0) and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE using standard immunoblot methods. Each of the TAP purification and immunoprecipitation experiments was repeated at least once.
