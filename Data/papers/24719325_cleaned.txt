!~ABS~! Mutations in HTRA2/Omi/PARK13 have been implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). PARK13 is a neuroprotective serine protease; however, little is known about how PARK13 confers stress protection and which protein targets are directly affected by PARK13. We have reported that Arabidopsis thaliana represents a complementary PD model, and here we demonstrate that AtPARK13, similar to human PARK13 (hPARK13), is a mitochondrial protease. We show that the expression/accumulation of AtPARK13 transcripts are induced by heat stress but not by other stress conditions, including oxidative stress and metals. Our data show that elevated levels of AtPARK13 confer thermotolerance in A. thaliana. Increased temperatures accelerate protein unfolding, and we demonstrate that although AtPARK13 can act on native protein substrates, unfolded proteins represent better AtPARK13 substrates. The results further show that AtPARK13 and hPARK13 can degrade the PD proteins α-synuclein (SNCA) and DJ-1/PARK7 directly, without autophagy involvement, and that misfolded SNCA and DJ-1 represent better substrates than their native counterparts. Comparative proteomic profiling revealed AtPARK13-mediated proteome changes, and we identified four proteins that show altered abundance in response to AtPARK13 overexpression and elevated temperatures. Our study not only suggests that AtPARK13 confers thermotolerance by degrading misfolded protein targets, but it also provides new insight into possible roles of this protease in neurodegeneration. 
!~RES~! To investigate the conservation of PARK13 across species, we performed prediction analysis suggesting that the Arabidopsis endopeptidase NM122648 (at5g27660) is similar to the human PARK13/HTRA2 (CITATION). Multiple sequence alignment analyses revealed, however, low sequence conservation beyond amino acid residue 411 within the conserved NM122648 PDZ domain. We cloned the at5g27660 cDNA (AtPARK13), revealing an extension of exon 10, by 18 nucleotides, and a shift in the reading frame leading to the conversion of intron 11 into an exonic sequence, effectively fusing exons 11 and 12. The cloned, full-length AtPARK13 is ∼40% similar to PARK13 from humans, Drosophila, and zebrafish, showing high similarity within the protease and PDZ domains (Fig. 1A).  [[FIGURE]] To address the subcellular localization of AtPARK13, we transfected an AtPARK13-YFP transgene into tobacco leaves by particle bombardment. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, with a CoxIV-CFP transgene as a mitochondrial marker, we found that AtPARK13, like its human counterpart, localizes to mitochondria (Fig. 1B).  To gain insight into the expression dynamics of AtPARK13, we performed several expression analyses. Spatial expression patterns of AtPARK13 were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR in different plant tissues. We found that AtPARK13 expression levels were significantly higher in aerial parts of the plant, including flowers, stems, and leaves as compared with roots (Fig. 2A). To further analyze possible stress-induced regulation of AtPARK13, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR on WT plants exposed to elevated temperatures. From this analysis, we found that AtPARK13 transcript levels are significantly up-regulated when plants are shifted from 21 to 37 °C for 5 h (Fig. 2B). To test whether AtPARK13 levels were induced by other stress conditions, we exposed 2-week-old WT plants to 10 μm H2O2, CuSO4, and methyl viologen/Paraquat. No increase in AtPARK13 levels, above baseline, was observed in response to these stress treatments (Fig. 2B). Additionally, combining H2O2 and heat stress (37 °C) had no additive effect on AtPARK13 expression levels (Fig. 2B).  [[FIGURE]] The kinetics of AtPARK13 expression was also analyzed, showing a rapid ∼20-fold increase in transcript levels after exposure to 37 °C for only 1 h (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, after 2 h at 37 °C, AtPARK13 transcript levels decreased to ∼10-fold above baseline levels with a further reduction after 5 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). AtPARK13 transcript levels were not affected by exposure to 42 °C (Fig. 1E).  PARK13 knock-out mice show a Parkinsonian phenotype, whereas overexpression confers neuroprotection (CITATION, CITATION). We initially attempted to characterize two AtPARK13 T-DNA mutant lines (SAIL536 having a T-DNA insertion in the 3′-UTR and SAIL905 having a T-DNA insertion in the coding region); however, no homozygous lines could be recovered (data not shown). We then generated gain-of-function AtPARK13 lines using the CaMV35S promoter (pBA002) (CITATION) and the β-estradiol XVE-inducible promoter (pER10) (CITATION). Two independent lines from each construct were selected, showing high levels of AtPARK13 expression (Fig. 3, A and D). To investigate potential protective roles of AtPARK13, two pBA002-AtPARK13 overexpression lines were subjected to heat stress and compared with transgenic lines containing the empty pBA002 vector and WT plants. We initially tested the effect on survival in AtPARK13-overexpressing plants in response to 37 °C exposure for 12 days. After 6 and 8 days at 37 °C, transgenic plants containing the empty vector (pBA002, line 1) showed clear bleaching, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing AtPARK13 (pBA002/AtPARK13, line 1) showed thermotolerance (Fig. 3B).  [[FIGURE]] We then analyzed the phenotypes of the same transgenic plants in response to 42 °C. After 12 h of exposure to 42 °C, WT plants exhibited bleaching and cell death as compared with plants overexpressing AtPARK13 (Fig. 3C). Further, after 21 and 24 h of exposure to 42 °C, WT plants were completely bleached, whereas AtPARK13-overexpressing plants showed clear cell survival (Fig. 3C).  Because the transgenic pER10-AtPARK13 lines selected exhibited higher AtPARK13 levels (Fig. 3D) compared with the CaMV35S/AtPARK13 transgenic lines analyzed (Fig. 3A), we tested whether the observed thermotolerance was dependent on AtPARK13 levels. As for the pBA002-AtPARK13 transgenic plants (Fig. 3, B and C), we observed clear thermotolerance in the pER10/AtPARK13 transgenic lines as compared with empty vector pER10 plants (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the degree of thermotolerance appeared higher in the pER10/AtPARK13 transgenic plants (Fig. 3E) compared with the pBA002/AtPARK13 plants (Fig. 3C), suggesting a possible dose-dependent effect.  To analyze the AtPARK13 enzymatic activity, we expressed AtPARK13 (pET28a-AtPARK13) in E. coli and purified the protein under denaturing conditions using affinity chromatography (Fig. 4A). Following refolding by stepwise dialysis, protease activity assays, using casein as a generic substrate, demonstrated that AtPARK13 is indeed a protease when compared with fractions purified from E. coli expressing pET28a alone (Fig. 4B). Previous studies have shown that PARK13 activity increases with increasing temperature (CITATION); however, AtPARK13 showed no significant increase in activity at 42 °C as compared with 37 °C (Fig. 4B). Because proteases often recognize unfolded/misfolded proteins, we then addressed whether denatured casein represented a better AtPARK13 substrate as compared with native casein. We found a significant increase in protease activity toward denatured casein as compared with non-denatured casein substrate (Fig. 4C). This suggests that AtPARK13 preferentially acts on misfolded/unassembled proteins. We also analyzed the Vmax and Km in response to misfolded casein was obtained as 0.2 pmol−1 and 62 μm, respectively.  [[FIGURE]] To test whether the AtPARK13 protease could degrade known PD-associated proteins, we exposed purified native SNCA to purified AtPARK13. We found that AtPARK13 could degrade native SNCA, as observed for casein (Fig. 5A). We further observed that misfolded SNCA represents a better target for AtPARK13, showing a ∼2-fold reduction in SNCA levels (Fig. 5A). Because human PARK13 is synthesized as a precursor that becomes processed into a mature cytosolic form (lacking the signal peptide and the trans-membrane domain) in response to apoptotic stimuli (CITATION), we tested whether a mature form of AtPARK13 showed altered protease activity. To this end, we expressed and purified a truncated mature-mimicked version of AtPARK13 (mAtPARK13; amino acids 122–436, lacking the signal peptide and the predicted trans-membrane domain) under denaturing conditions and the mature form of hPARK13 (mhPARK13) under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 5B). Following refolding by stepwise dialysis, casein degradation assays showed no significant difference in mAtPARK13 activity as compared with full-length AtPARK13 (data not shown). As expected, mhPARK13 was able to degrade casein (data not shown). We then analyzed whether mhPARK13 could degrade SNCA. We observed a ∼2-fold reduction in both folded and unfolded SNCA in response to mhPARK13, similar to the observations with AtPARK13 (Fig. 5, A and C).  [[FIGURE]] Because the AtPARK13 protein used for this study was purified from the insoluble fraction followed by refolding, we sought to verify our findings using AtPARK13 purified from the soluble fraction in its native state. Soluble AtPARK13 was expressed and purified under native conditions in E. coli alongside an empty vector control showing a molecular weight reminiscent of the processed mature form (Fig. 6A). We next tested whether this mature form of AtPARK13 could act on casein as a generic substrate. We found, as for full-length AtPARK13 (Fig. 4C), that native, processed mAtPARK13 showed clear protease activity against non-denatured and denatured casein (Fig. 6B). We also tested whether the native mAtPARK13 could act on SNCA, and as with full-length AtPARK13 (Fig. 5A), we observed a clear reduction in SNCA (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] We also sought to analyze whether DJ-1/PARK7 could act as a substrate for AtPARK13. To this end, we exposed purified WT DJ-1/PARK7 to purified mAtPARK13. From this analysis, we found that DJ-1/PARK7 levels were reduced by ∼40% when incubated with AtPARK13, suggesting that DJ-1/PARK7 is an AtPARK13 substrate in vitro (Fig. 5C). As with SNCA, denatured DJ-1/PARK7 appears to be a better substrate for mAtPARK13 (Fig. 6C). To further analyze this finding, we also exposed the DJ-1/PARK7 A107P mutated variant to AtPARK13. The DJ-1/PARK7 A107P mutation is presumed to render DJ-1/PARK7 less stable by conformationally altering the three-dimensional structure of the protein. From this analysis, we observed a similar reduction in DJ-1/PARK7 A107P as for WT DJ-1/PARK7 (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, denatured DJ-1/PARK7 A107P did not appear to act as a better substrate for mAtPARK13 (Fig. 6D).  Because the mature form of hPARK13 was able to degrade SNCA, we also tested whether mhPARK13 could also act on WT DJ-1/PARK13 and DJ-1/PARK7 A107P. From these experiments, we found that mhPARK13 could act on both WT DJ-1/PARK7 (Fig. 6E) and on the DJ-1/PARK7 A107P variant (Fig. 6F) but with no significant difference between the native and the denatured forms.  Comparative two-dimensional PAGE was performed on extracts from transgenic plants expressing the vectors pBA002 and pER10 alone and on plants overexpressing pBA002-AtPARK13 (Fig. 3A, Line 1) and pER10-AtPARK13 (Fig. 3B, Line 2) at 21 and 37 °C (Fig. 7). Three biological replicates were used, and proteins showing differential abundance were identified. The three biological replicas comprised extracts from transgenic plants containing the pBA002 and the pER10 vectors. From this analysis, we identified four proteins that showed differential abundance that were then identified by MALDI-linear ion trap peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry (Table 1). The number of unique peptides and percentage coverage for the four proteins are shown in Table 2 and in supplemental Fig. 1. Three proteins showed decreased abundance in response to AtPARK13 expression, whereas one protein showed increased abundance (Table 1).  [[FIGURE]] Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP20-3 was identified as a moderately down-regulated protein in AtPARK13-overexpressing plants (Table 1, spot 2). AtPARK13 overexpression also resulted in down-regulation of photosystem II subunit P-1 (Table 1, spot 1) and germin-like protein (Table 1, spot 3). In response to AtPARK13 accumulation, we identified glutathione transferase (Table 1, spot 4) as being up-regulated.  [[TABLE]] [[TABLE]]
!~MM~! Wild type (WT) A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia), mutant lines (SAIL903 and SAIL536), and overexpressing lines were initially grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (MP Biomedicals) with 1% (w/v) sucrose and transferred to soil after 1 week at 21 °C under long day conditions (16-h light/8-h dark) in plant chambers (Sanyo). For the heat stress treatments, plants were grown at 21, 37, and 42 °C for 1, 2, and 5 h. 10 μm H2O2 (J. T. Baker), 10 μm CuSO4 (Sigma), and 10 μm methyl viologen (Paraquat) (Sigma) were applied to plants for 5 h after 2 weeks at 21 °C for the oxidative stress and metal treatments.  The amino acid sequences of human PARK13, zebrafish PARK13, Drosophila PARK13, and Arabidopsis PARK13 (At5g27660) were obtained from NCBI and aligned using Geneious R6 software (Biomatters Ltd.). Total RNA obtained was using the SurePrep plant/fungi RNA isolation kit (Fisher) from wild type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings. RNA obtained was treated with 1 unit of DNase I (Thermo Scientific) per μg of RNA in the company-specified buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation at 65 °C with 50 mm EDTA. The DNase I-treated RNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using the RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). The cDNA obtained was used to perform preparative RT-PCR using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) (35 cycles) with AtPARK13 forward primer (5′-ATGGCGCGCCATGATGAATTTTCTGAGAAGAGC-3′) (AscI underlined) and reverse primer (5′-ATTTAATTAATCACATGTCTGGATTAGCC-3′) (PacI underlined) (Sigma-Aldrich). The PCR product was subjected to 1% agarose (Fisher) gel electrophoresis. For spatial and stress-induced AtPARK13 transcript analysis, RNA isolation and first strand cDNA synthesis were performed as described. For semiquantitative RT-PCR (25 cycles), TopTaq MasterMix (Qiagen) was used in all cases with AtPARK13 forward and reverse primers. Actin was used as a control in all cases and was amplified using actin forward primer (5′-TGCCAATCTACGAGGGTTTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GAACCACCGATCCAGACACT-3′) (Sigma-Aldrich). In all experiments, the PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.  Cloning was carried out using standard techniques. AtPARK13 was cloned into pJET1.2/blunt using the CloneJET PCR cloning kit (Thermo Scientific), binary vectors pBA002 (CITATION) and pER10 (CITATION) at AscI/PacI (Thermo Scientific) restriction sites, YFP fusion vector pWEN18 (CITATION) at the KpnI restriction site, and protein expression vector pET28a(+) (Novagen) at SacI/NotI restriction sites, followed by DNA sequencing (Yale DNA Sequencing Facility). Mature AtPARK13 was designed based on the cleavage sites of hPARK13 and was cloned into protein expression vector pET28a(+) along with mature hPARK13. Primers used for cloning included the following: pBA002-AtPARK13, ATGGCGCGCCATGATGAATTTTCTGAGAAGAGC (AscI underlined) and ATTTAATTAATCACATGTCTGGATTAGCC (PacI underlined); pER10-AtPARK13, ATGGCGCGCCATGATGAATTTTCTGAGAAGAGC (AscI underlined) and ATTTAATTAATCACATGTCTGGATTAGCC (PacI underlined); pWEN18-AtPARK13, ATGGTACCATGATGAATTTTCTGAGAAGAGC (KpnI underlined) and ATGGTACCCATGTCTGGATTAGCCTCC (KpnI underlined); pET28a(+)-AtPARK13, ATGAGCTCATGATGAATTTTCTGAGAAGAGC (SacI underlined) and ATGCGGCCGCCATGTCTGGATTAGCCTCC (NotI underlined); pET28a(+)-mature AtPARK13, ATGAGCTCGCTGCTAGAATTGGACCAGC (SacI underlined) and ATGCGGCCGCTCACATGTCTGGATTAGC (NotI underlined); and pET28a(+)-mature hPARK13, ATGCGGCCGCATGGGCGGGGGTCGGGGTCCTCCG (NotI underlined) and ATCTCGAGTCATTCTGTGACCTCAGGGG (XhoI underlined).  For subcellular localization studies, pWEN18-AtPARK13-YFP and pCoxIV-ECFP (CITATION) were cotransfected into tobacco leaf cells by particle bombardment and analyzed after 24–48 h using a Nikon A1R confocal laser microscope. pCoxIV-ECFP, harboring the transit sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase IV (coxIV) from yeast fused to ECFP, was used as a marker for mitochondria (CITATION).  pBA002-AtPARK13 and pER10-AtPARK13 were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (ABI strain) for Arabidopsis transformation by electroporation transformation by the floral dip method (CITATION). Floral dip transformation was performed in the presence of 5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.04% (v/v) Silwet L-77 (Lehle seeds). pBA002 and pER10 transgenic plants were selected on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.5% (w/v) BASTA (PlantMedia) and 50 mg/ml kanamycin (Acros), respectively. Selected lines were transferred to half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium without antibiotic and grown for 1 week and then transferred to soil. RNA was isolated from the leaf tissue from the transgenic plants to perform RT-PCR using TopTaq MasterMix with AtPARK13 forward and reverse primers. Two lines with maximum expression of AtPARK13 in pBA002 were selected, seeds were harvested, and the T2 generation of both of the lines was subjected to heat stress at 37 and 42 °C along with controls (both WT and pBA002 vector-only plants) for 12 days and 24 h, respectively. Images were taken at regular intervals to note the phenotypic changes in the AtPARK13-overexpressing plants as compared with the controls.  pET28a(+)-AtPARK13 full-length, pET28a(+)-mature AtPARK13, and pET28a(+)-mature hPARK13 were purified using standard protocols in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen). Purification of mature hPARK13 was performed from the soluble fraction, and full-length and mature AtPARK13 were purified from the insoluble fractions using a His-tagged cobalt-agarose beads affinity column (Goldbio Technology). The purified proteins were analyzed on 12% acrylamide (Bio-World). Full-length AtPARK13 and mature AtPARK13 were refolded by stepwise dialysis from 6 m urea to 0 m urea using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce), and the concentrations of the proteins were calculated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and used for the protease assay. The protease assays were performed using the Pierce colorimetric protease assay kit (Pierce) using 83 μm casein as a generic substrate following the manufacturer's protocol. For investigating the effect of ions on the protease activity, 10 mm of Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Na+, and K+ were used in the assay. Vmax and Km were determined by determining the initial reaction rates (Vo) based on product released at different substrate concentrations as a function of time in a double-reciprocal plot.  Soluble AtPARK13, WT DJ-1, and A107P recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) following standard protocols using 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A595 reached 0.6–0.7. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and soluble proteins were extracted using three freeze-thaw cycles. Viscosity was reduced by sonication on ice, and insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a Sorvall Discovery 90SE Ultracentrifuge, 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography using standard methods followed by anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) chromatography. Prior to analysis, proteins were buffer-exchanged using PD-10 spun column chromatography into 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3.  Reaction mixtures for full-length AtPARK13, mature AtPARK13, and mature hPARK13 digestion were made up in a 50-μl final volume with WT SNCA, WT DJ-1, and mutant DJ-1/A107P proteins. Reaction mixtures containing 20 nm SNCA (native or misfolded) or 25 nm DJ-1 proteins (native or misfolded) were initiated by the addition of 4 μm AtPARK13 or 2 μm mature hPARK13. All unfolded substrates were denatured by boiling for 5 min. Reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min and then stopped by the addition of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (CITATION) and boiling for 5 min. Three independent experiments were performed for SNCA, and five independent experiments were performed for DJ-1.  All samples were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with running buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris base, and 2% (w/v) SDS) at 50 V for 15 min, followed by 75 V for 100 min using a mini-PROTEAN Tetra system (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Rad PowerPac Basic. Gels were transferred to an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore) using transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris base, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.005% (w/v) SDS) at 200 mm for 2 h. For blocking, the membrane was incubated with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in TBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 15.4 mm Trizma (Tris base) HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature. Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SNCA antibody (Abcam) at a 1:1000 dilution or a mouse monoclonal anti-DJ-1 antibody (ENZO life sciences) at 0.5 μg/ml in 2.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the membrane was washed with TBS-T three times for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation at 1:10,000 dilution with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce) for SNCA and with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce) for DJ-1 in 2.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times for 10 min at room temperature and was developed using Pierce ECL Western blot substrate (Thermo Scientific). The signals were recorded using the Molecular Imager Chemi Doc XRS+ imaging system (Bio-Rad).  Total Arabidopsis protein extracts were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE, and protein spots were analyzed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum version 7 (GE Healthcare) followed by peptide mass fingerprinting and data-dependent sequencing, as described previously (CITATION).  Arabidopsis plant seedlings were homogenized with liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Approximately 1 g of the tissue powder was suspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer (0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm phenyl thiourea, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and sonicated using a Polytron® PT-2500E homogenizer (KINEMATICA). After sonication, the extract was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected for further proteomic analysis.  The supernatant fractions were concentrated using Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filters (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 30–60 s, depending on the degree of concentration required, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. BSA was used as a standard.  Protein samples for separation were precipitated using a standard deoxycholate/trichloroacetic acid/acetone precipitation method (final concentrations: DOC, 0.0175% (w/v); TCA, 6% (w/v)), and the pellets were washed with acetone. These were then mixed with a rehydration solution containing 8 m urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 15 mm DTT, 30 mm thiourea, and 2% IPG buffer, pH 3–10, and traces of bromphenol blue and dissolved on a shaker overnight. The dissolved protein was then applied to ImmobilineTM DryStrip (7 cm, pH 3–10) (GE Healthcare) for overnight rehydration. The isoelectrofocusing was conducted according to conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, proteins in the gel were reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide using standard methods. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was then run on 12% SDS-PAGE at 100 V. Gels were stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250.  The stained gels were scanned using EPSON Scan Perfection V750 PRO software (Digital ICE Technologies). The two-dimensional gels were scanned in professional mode at 600 dpi and in 16-bit grayscale. Image analysis software ImageMaster 2D platinum version 7 (GE Healthcare) was used to carry out the spot detection, the background subtraction, and the two-dimensional correction, to determine the differences between protein spots. Spot analysis was carried out by importing all gel images into ImageMasterTM 2D Platinum software version 7.0 (GE Healthcare). In brief, spots were detected automatically with the parameters of smooth = 2, minimal area = 5, and saliency = 10. The patterns of protein spots on each gel were aligned using a landmark spot and matched with the reference gel automatically. Spot normalization was based on relative volume (% volume), which is the volume of each spot divided by the total volume of all spots in the gel. Protein abundance changes were based on the ratio of differences between the vector and overexpressed AtPARK13 as reported by the software.  The differentially expressed protein spots were excised, cut into small pieces, and placed in 0.6-ml Eppendorf tubes. The gel pieces were destained by incubating in 200 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) with shaking. When fully destained, the gel fragments were dehydrated with two washes of 100 μl of 100% acetonitrile and were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge (SpeedVac) for 5 min. The protein was then cleaved enzymatically into peptides. For this, trypsin solution (2 μl, 0.02 μg/μl) was added to wet the gel pieces, and incubation was carried out for 4 h at room temperature. Thirty μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to the gel pieces, and they were left overnight at room temperature to allow for diffusion of the peptides from the gel. The digested proteins were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.  After digestion, POROS 20 R2 resin (Applied Biosystems) was added into the digested gel samples with 5% formic acid and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid for extraction at 4 °C for 4 h on a shaker. Prior to MALDI-MS analysis, the peptide digests were further desalted using ZipTip C18 (Millipore). The ZipTips were conditioned with 10 μl of 0.1% (v/v) TFA twice, 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) TFA twice and 10 μl of 0.1% (v/v) TFA twice. The sample containing the digests and bead mixture was transferred to the ZipTips and bound to the C18 resin. The loaded tips were then washed with 10 μl of 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The peptide digests were eluted by placing 2 μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution in 0.003% (v/v) TFA, 13% (v/v) ethanol, and 84% (v/v) ACN onto the top of the ZipTips and slowly dispensing onto the MALDI plate. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by a Thermo LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a vacuum MALDI source after the solvent evaporated at room temperature, and the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was crystallized with peptides on the MALDI plate. A data-dependent acquisition was performed using Xcalibur software, in which the 40 most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (mass range 700–3500 Da) were chosen, and MS/MS acquisition was triggered to fragment them by collision-induced dissociation. The normalized collision energy was 50%, and the isolation width was 3 Da. The raw files from the LTQ mass spectrometer were analyzed using Mascot Distiller version 2.3.2 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) for protein identification. Peptide masses were matched against the taxonomy A. thaliana in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information non-redundant (NCBInr) database. One missed trypsin cleavage per peptide was allowed, and an initial mass tolerance of 0.3 Da was used in all searches. Complete carboxyamidation of cysteine sulfhydryls and partial oxidation of methionine were assumed.  ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and ImageQuant TL version 8.1 software (GE Healthcare) were used for quantification, values are means ± S.E., and Student's t test was utilized. p < 0.05 is denoted as significant.
