!~ABS~! Peptidoglycans (PGNs) are immunogenic bacterial surface patterns that trigger immune activation in metazoans and plants. It is generally unknown how complex bacterial structures such as PGNs are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition of bacterial matrices and generation of soluble PRR ligands. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana, upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns, produces a metazoan lysozyme-like hydrolase (lysozyme 1, LYS1). LYS1 activity releases soluble PGN fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity. Importantly, LYS1 mutant genotypes exhibit super-susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to that observed on PGN receptor mutants. We propose that plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial structures, and that soluble pattern generation might aid PRR-mediated immune activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites.

!~RES~! Soluble oligomeric PGN fragments have previously been shown to stimulate plant immune responses in Arabidopsis ([bib33]; [bib26]; [bib86]). As some metazoan PGRPs harbor PGN-degrading enzyme activities ([bib30]; [bib85]; [bib4]; [bib25]; [bib46]), we tested whether recombinant Arabidopsis PGN binding proteins LYM1 and LYM3 were able to catalyze PGN degradation. For this, we have employed a standard lysozyme assay ([bib62]) that is based on reduced turbidity in suspensions of Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus cell wall preparations due to PGN degradation. PGN-degrading activity of hen egg-white lysozyme served as a positive control in these assays. As shown in [fig1], lysozyme, but not recombinant LYM1 or LYM3, displayed cell wall-degrading lytic activity, suggesting that the latter are unable to release PGN fragments from bacterial cell walls. This is in agreement with a lack of sequence similarities between LYM1 or LYM3 and known metazoan PGN hydrolytic activities. We therefore conclude that LYM1 and LYM3 constitute plant PGN sensors that appear to be functionally related to non-enzymatic mammalian or Drosophila PGRPs ([bib16]; [bib4]; [bib25]; [bib46]).10.7554/eLife.01990.003Figure 1.The Arabidopsis lysozyme 1 (LYS1) gene is transcriptionally activated upon pathogen-infection.(A) LYM1 and LYM3 do not possess peptidoglycan (PGN) hydrolytic activity.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.003 Lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17) hydrolyze β(1,4) linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in PGNs and between N-acetylglucosamine residues in chitodextrins (http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/3.2.1.17). Plant genomes do not encode lysozyme-like proteins, but many plant species produce lysozyme-like enzyme activities such as chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) ([bib2]; [bib69]). Plant chitinases fall into five classes (I–V, [fig1]) ([bib63]) and are grouped into structurally unrelated families 18 and 19 of glycosyl hydrolases, respectively ([bib34]). Chitinases belonging to family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases are ubiquitously found in all organisms whereas chitinases of glycosyl hydrolase family 19 are found almost exclusively in plants. Class III chitinases (glycosyl hydrolase family 18) represent bifunctional plant enzymes with lysozyme-like activities. One such enzyme, hevamine from the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis ([bib3]), has been shown to hydrolyze PGN and the structurally closely related β(1,4)-linked GlcNAc homopolymer chitin in vitro ([bib5]). To explore host-mediated PGN degradation and its possible implication in plant immune activation, we have addressed the only class III chitinase (which we named LYS1, At5g24090) encoded by the Arabidopsis genome ([bib63]; [fig1]). Bacterial infection of Arabidopsis plants stably expressing a pLYS1::GUS construct revealed that LYS1 gene expression is enhanced upon infection with host non-adapted Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph) or disarmed host adapted P. syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 hrcC−. Likewise, expression of the immune response marker pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) was enhanced by the same treatment ([fig1]). Failure to detect LYS1 expression in plants infected with virulent host adapted Pto DC3000 suggests bacterial effector-mediated suppression that is reminiscent of that observed for PGN receptor proteins LYM1 and LYM3 ([bib86]) as well as numerous other immunity-associated genes ([bib43]; [bib65]). LYS1 gene expression is not only triggered upon bacterial infection, but was also observed upon treatment with different MAMPs including bacterial flagellin, LPS, or PGN preparations ([fig1]), similar to the immune marker gene Flagellin-responsive kinase 1 (FRK1). Altogether, infection-induced LYS1 transcriptional activation suggests that the LYS1 protein is implicated in immunity to bacterial infection. To analyze the enzymatic properties of LYS1, recombinant protein production was attempted. Overexpression in Escherichia coli failed to produce active enzyme and LYS1 production in eukaryotic Pichia pastoris entirely failed to produce recombinant protein (not shown). Therefore, we resorted to generate p35S::LYS1-GFP-overexpressing (LYS1OE) plants ([fig2]). Notably, LYS1-GFP was glycosylated ([fig2]), possibly explaining the failure to produce enzymatically active LYS1 protein in E. coli. Expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in Arabidopsis plants was accompanied by substantial proteolytic cleavage resulting in the predominant release of a protein with an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa, most likely representing untagged LYS1 ([fig2]). Analysis of this major cleavage product by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after tryptic in-gel digestion and by peptide mass fingerprint not only confirmed the identity of LYS1 in this band but also yielded peptides spanning the whole protein sequence, except for the first 53 amino acids (data not shown), thus indicating cleavage of the LYS1-GFP fusion protein between LYS1 and GFP.10.7554/eLife.01990.004Figure 2.Analysis of LYS1 overexpression lines.(A) RT-qPCR analyses of transcript levels in mature leaves of two independent transgenic lines expressing p35S::LYS1-GFP (LYS1OE-1, LYS1OE-2) relative to expression levels in wild-type.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.004 Three mutant lines with T-DNA insertions in the LYS1 gene were available from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. However, neither the insertion in the 5' untranslated region nor the insertions in the first intron and at the end of the last exon of the coding region abolished formation of the LYS1 transcript ([fig3s1]). As an alternative to knock-out lines, LYS1 knock-down lines (LYS1KD) were produced by artificial micro RNA technology ([bib72]; [fig3]). As proven by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we obtained two genetically independent LYS1KD lines with residual transcript levels not exceeding 10% of those detected in wild-type plants ([fig3]). In contrast, the transcription of potential off-target genes was not affected ([fig3]). Protein extracts derived from transgenic plants were tested for chitinolytic activity by employing 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-N, N′, N″-triacetylchitotriose (4-MUCT) as substrate. Leaf protein extracts from LYS1OE plants exhibited significant chitinase activity when compared with a Streptomyces griseus chitinase control ([fig4]). In contrast, wild-type and LYS1KD plants exhibited only marginal chitinase activities. Likewise, using 4-MUCT in a gel electrophoretic separation-based chitinase assay produced a zymogram in which enzyme activity was solely detectable in protein extracts obtained from LYS1OE plants, but not in those from control plants expressing secreted GFP (secGFP) ([fig4]). Thus, LYS1 indeed harbors the predicted chitinase activity. As 4-MUCT is also a typical substrate for lysozymes ([bib12]), this was the first indication that LYS1 might also harbor lysozyme activity. Next, leaf protein extracts from LYS1OE plants were tested for their ability to solubilize complex PGN presented by intact Gram-positive M. luteus cells and to cleave preparations of complex, insoluble Bacillus subtilis PGN. Again, protein extracts from LYS1OE plants exhibited significant PGN-degrading activity whereas wild-type and LYS1KD plants showed basal activity levels only ([fig4]). Likewise, PGN-solubilizing activity profiles of protoplast suspensions derived from these transgenics confirmed significant PGN-degrading activity of LYS1OE plants ([fig4]).10.7554/eLife.01990.005Figure 3.Analysis of LYS1 amiRNA lines.(A) Predicted LYS1 gene structure (exons, black bars; introns, black lines; untranslated regions, gray).

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.009 To determine specific enzyme activities, untagged LYS1 was purified from LYS1OE Arabidopsis lines by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and used for enzyme assays. The 4-MUCT assay yielded a Michaelis constant (Km) of 70 ± 14 µM and a Vmax of 378 ± 42 µM min−1 mg−1 for LYS1, and a Km of 53 ± 27 µM and a Vmax of 397 ± 145 µM min−1 mg−1 for commercial S. griseus chitinase. Using the turbidity assay with M. luteus cell wall preparations, a Km of 18.2 ± 2.5 mg/ml and Vmax of 4.4 ± 0.6 mg mg−1 min−1 were obtained for LYS1, and a Km of 8.4 ± 0.8 mg/ml and Vmax of 192 ± 120 mg mg−1 min−1 for commercial hen egg-white lysozyme. The Km values for LYS1 are thus comparable to the commercial enzymes. As shown in [fig4], the majority of LYS1 activity was found in the supernatant of the protoplasts, suggesting an apoplastic localization of LYS1. To confirm this localization we prepared apoplastic washes from LYS1OE Arabidopsis lines. Both the LYS1-GFP fusion protein as well as free LYS1 was detectable in concentrated apoplastic fluids whereas the cytoplasmic mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK3 was only present in the total leaf protein samples ([fig4s1]). Moreover, transient expression in the heterologous plant system Nicotiana benthamiana of the p35S::LYS1-GFP construct resulted in labeling of the cell periphery, whereas expression of a construct lacking the LYS1 signal peptide-encoding sequence yielded labeling of intracellular structures ([fig4s1]). Use of the fluorescent dye FM4-64, a plasma membrane and early endosome marker ([bib7]), revealed that LYS1 signals co-localized to a large extent with the plasma membrane ([fig4s1]). Thus, LYS1 likely operates in close vicinity of the plant surface. Indeed, previous identification within the Arabidopsis cell wall proteome ([bib48]) suggests that LYS1 acts in the plant apoplast. Since the plant apoplast is an acidic compartment (pH 5–6) ([bib71]), we investigated whether LYS1 is active at physiologically relevant pH conditions. For this, the M. luteus cell wall-degrading activity of an LYS1OE leaf extract was determined at different pH values. Although active at pH values ranging from 3.2 to 7.2, a pronounced maximum of LYS1 activity was detected around pH 6 which coincided with the apoplastic pH of plant cells ([fig4]). To further confirm LYS1 glucan hydrolytic activity, an epitope-tagged LYS1 fusion construct was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana ([fig5]). Similar to the Arabidopsis LYS1OE leaf extracts, extracts from p35S::LYS1-myc expressing N. benthamiana leaves also displayed in-gel chitinolytic activity ([fig5]) compared with extracts from control leaves expressing the viral silencing suppressor p19 only. Likewise, N. benthamiana protein extracts containing LYS1-myc were able to cleave preparations of complex insoluble B. subtilis PGN ([fig5]).10.7554/eLife.01990.010Figure 5.LYS1 transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana possesses hydrolytic activity.(A) Protein extracts from N. benthamiana leaves expressing LYS1 fused to the myc-epitope tag under control of the p35S promoter were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by western blot using antibodies raised against the myc-epitope tag.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.010 In sum, we provide biochemical evidence that LYS1 harbors hydrolytic activity for chitin as well as for PGN of the lysine-type (M. luteus) and diaminopimelic acid-type (B. subtilis). Importantly, LYS1 failed to exhibit activity on cellobiose as a substrate, indicating it might have no cellulose activity ([fig4s2]). Thus, LYS1 resembles enzymatic activities reported for metazoan lysozymes and should be classified as lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17) instead of chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). To analyze immunogenic activities of PGN cleavage products generated by LYS1, untagged LYS1 was purified from LYS1OE Arabidopsis lines by FPLC and used for degradation of B. subtilis PGN. Solubilized PGN fragments found in the supernatant of LYS1-digested PGN were subsequently analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ([fig6]). Only a few peaks could be detected in the supernatant of PGN incubated with a buffer control or with heat-inactivated LYS1. In contrast, PGN digests produced by native LYS1 yielded several characteristic peaks that were also detectable in the supernatants of PGN preparations treated with mutanolysin, which has been shown to cleave O-glycosidic bonds between GlcNAc and MurNAc residues in complex PGN ([bib89]). LYS1-generated PGN fragments were subsequently tested for their ability to trigger plant immunity-associated responses ([fig6]). First, supernatants of PGN preparations treated with either native or heat-denatured LYS1 were used to trigger immune marker gene FRK1 expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. Importantly, only supernatants from PGN digests produced by native LYS1 or mutanolysin induced FRK1 expression whereas buffer controls or digests produced by heat-inactivated LYS1 did not release immunogenic soluble fragments from complex PGNs ([fig6]). Notably, activation of immune responses by LYS1-generated PGN fragments was dependent on Arabidopsis PGN receptor complex components LYM1, LYM3, and CERK1 as the respective mutant genotypes failed to respond to immunogenic PGN fragments ([fig6]). Second, we tested whether LYS1-generated PGN fragments were able to trigger an immunity-associated response, medium alkalinization, in rice cell suspensions. This plant was chosen for testing as a PGN receptor system very similar to that in Arabidopsis has recently been reported ([bib50]). As shown in [fig6], LYS1-released PGN fragments triggered medium alkalinization in cultured rice cells, suggesting that immune defense stimulation by soluble PGN fragments is not restricted to Arabidopsis only.10.7554/eLife.01990.011Figure 6.Purified LYS1 generates immunogenic peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments.LYS1 was purified from 5-week-old LYS1OE plants and used for PGN digestion.

All experiments shown were repeated at least once. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.011 We further investigated the kinetics of PGN fragment release from complex PGNs. As shown in [fig6], release of immunogenic PGN fragments into solution occurred rapidly within 10 min of incubation with native LYS1. Incubation of complex PGNs with LYS1 yielded the highest immunogenic activity of the digest supernatant after 30 min, suggesting that at that time point the maximum amount of immunogenic PGN fragments was generated. However, prolonged incubation with LYS1 again resulted in a loss of activity with overnight digestion completely abolishing stimulatory activity of the PGN digest. We assume that LYS1 is capable of releasing immunogenic fragments from complex PGNs, but extensive or complete digest into PGN monomers or small PGN fragments appears to abolish the immunogenic activity of PGN fragments. This result is in accordance with our previous observations that prolonged digestion of PGN with mutanolysin diminishes its defense-inducing activity ([bib33]). To examine the physiological role of LYS1 in plant immunity, LYS1OE and LYS1KD lines were subjected to infection with various phytopathogens. As LYS1 harbors chitinase activity ([fig4 fig5]) and as LYS1 transcripts accumulate upon fungal infection ([bib69a]), we first analyzed the role of LYS1 in immunity towards fungal infection. Leaves of transgenic LYS1OE or LYS1KD lines and wild-type plants were infected with the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and disease symptoms were monitored 2–3 days post infection. Fungal hyphal growth and necrotic leaf lesions at infection sites were detectable in all plant lines tested and hyphal outgrowth or cell death lesion sizes revealed no differences between wild-type, LYS1OE or LYS1KD lines ([fig7]). Likewise, infection with the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola resulted in indistinguishable necrotic lesions in LYS1OE and LYS1KD transgenics compared to those observed in wild-type control plants ([fig8]). Trypan blue staining and microscopic analysis of the infection sites did not reveal major differences in fungal hyphal growth among all lines tested ([fig8]). Although disease indices at day 11 after infection were slightly increased in LYS1KD lines ([fig8]), such subtle differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we failed to detect a role for LYS1 in immunity to fungal infection with B. cinerea and A. brassicicola under our experimental conditions. However, these results cannot be generalized and LYS1 might still have a role under infection regimes other than the ones used here or it might be important for defense against other fungal pathogens.10.7554/eLife.01990.012Figure 7.LYS1 lines are not impaired in resistance towards infection with Botrytis cinerea.Five-week-old plants were infected with the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. 5 μl spore suspension of 5 × 105 spores/ml was drop-inoculated on one half of the leaf; two leaves per plant were infected.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.013 To examine the role of LYS1 in immunity to bacterial infection, we infected wild-type plants or LYS1KD and LYS1OE lines with virulent Pto DC3000. Two independent LYS1KD lines exhibited hypersusceptibility to bacterial infection ([fig9]), suggesting that lack of PGN-degrading activity results in reduced plant immunity. Likewise, immunity to hypovirulent Pto DC3000 ΔAvrPto/PtoB was compromised in these lines ([fig9]). Moreover, expression of the immune marker gene FRK1 upon administration of complex PGNs was greatly impaired in the LYS1KD mutants ([fig9]). These findings suggest that the enzymatic activity of LYS1 on PGN contributes substantially to plant immunity against bacterial infection.10.7554/eLife.01990.014Figure 9.Manipulation of LYS1 levels causes hypersusceptibility towards bacterial infection and loss of peptidoglycan (PGN)-triggered immune responses.(A and B) Transgenic LYS1 plants are hypersusceptible to bacterial infection.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.015 Unexpectedly, bacterial growth on LYS1OE lines was also significantly enhanced compared with that observed on wild-type plants ([fig9]). FRK1 transcript accumulation upon administration of complex PGN was also strongly reduced in LYS1 overexpressors ([fig9]). To exclude a direct effect of LYS1 overexpression on PGN receptor abundance, we examined transcript levels of LYM1, LYM3, and CERK1 but found no effect on the transcription of these receptor genes in the LYS1OE lines ([fig9s1]). Also, CERK1 protein levels were unaltered in the LYS1OE lines, whereas there was no CERK1 protein detectable in the cerk1-2 mutant ([fig9s1]). Moreover, we included the LYS1OE-3 line with only moderately increased LYS1 transcript and protein levels in mature leaves ([fig9s1]). Susceptibility to Pseudomonas infection in the LYS1OE-3 line was only slightly but not significantly increased (p=0.064, Student’s t test). These results indicate that lowering LYS1 expression levels, accompanied by lower LYS1 hydrolytic activity on PGN, brings down these lines close to wild-type. Thus, massive LYS1 overexpression and loss-of-function mutations are phenocopies of each other, irrespective of the fact that LYS1KD and LYS1OE lines show dramatic differences in LYS1 enzymatic activities ([fig4]). Altogether, we propose that LYS1 contributes to plant immunity to bacterial infection by decomposition of bacterial PGNs and generation of soluble PGN-derived patterns that trigger immune activation in a LYM1-LYM3-CERK1 receptor-complex-dependent manner.
!~MM~! A. thaliana Columbia-0 wild-type and N. benthamiana plants were grown on soil as previously described ([bib10]). T-DNA insertion lines for LYS1 (lys1-1, WiscDsLox387C11; lys1-2, SALK_095362; lys1-3, CSHL_ET14179) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The transgenic pPR1::GUS and secGFP lines and the lym1 lym3 and cerk1-2 mutants have been described previously ([bib75]; [bib81]; [bib86]). Rice (Oryza sativa) suspension cell cultures were grown in MS-medium (4.41 g/l MS salt, 6% [wt/vol] sucrose, 50 mg/l MES, 2 mg/l 2,4-D) at 150 rpm and sub-cultured every week. Bacterial strains P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 or Pto DC3000 ΔAvrPto/AvrPto, A. brassicicola isolate MUCL 20297, and B. cinerea isolate BO5-10 were grown and used for infection assays on Arabidopsis leaves of 4–5-week-old plants as described previously ([bib49]; [bib43]). To visualize plant cell death and fungal growth on a cellular level, infected plants were stained with Trypan blue in lactophenol and ethanol as described elsewhere ([bib43]). Flg22 peptide has been described previously ([bib27]). The purification of P. syringae pv. tomato PGN was performed as described previously ([bib86]). M. luteus cell wall preparations and B. subtilis PGN were purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, California, United States), Cecolabs (Tübingen, Germany), and Sigma-Aldrich (Hamburg, Germany). PGNs and LPS (from P. aeruginosa, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in water at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and stored at −20°C. Mutanolysin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant His6-LYM1 and His6-LYM3 were expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described ([bib86]). As negative control, a protein purification using non-induced cultures harboring the His6-LYM3 construct was performed. For the p35S::LYS1 fusion constructs, a 903 bp fragment of the LYS1 coding sequence without STOP codon was cloned using the primers At5g24090gatF and At5g24090gatR ([tbl1]). In a second PCR, the recombination sites of the inserts were completed using the Gateway adaptor primers attB1 and attB2 (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). The resulting fragments were then subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) by using the BP clonase reaction according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) and inserted into the binary expression vectors pK7FWG2.0 (C-terminal GFP-tag) ([bib42], [bib41]) or pGWB17 (C-terminal myc-tag) ([bib57]) by using the LR clonase reaction following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). For the pLYS1::GUS reporter construct, a 1948 bp fragment of the LYS1 promoter sequence was amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA using the primers At5g24090gatF2 and At5g24090gatR2 ([tbl1]), extended in a second PCR with Gateway adaptor primers attB1 and attB2 and subcloned into pDONR207 (Invitrogen) before being inserted into the binary expression vector pBGWFS7 ([bib42], [bib41]).10.7554/eLife.01990.016Table 1.Primers used in this studyDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.016AGIPrimer nameSequence 5′ → 3′At5g24090 (LYS1)At5g24090F1CCAGAGGTGGCATAGCCATCAt5g24090R1CATCTGGTGGGATATAGCCACAt5g24090FATGACCAACATGACTCTTCGAt5g24090RTCACACACTAGCCAATATAGAt5g24090RP2TGATGCCACGAGACTGACLP_N853931TGACGAACCATGATAAATGGGRP_N853931CATAACCTCACACTGTGCTCGLP_N595362TAGTGCATGCATGTTAAACCGRP_N595362AGCTCCTCAATGTCCATTTCCSalk-LbaTGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCGDs5-1GAAACGGTCGGGAAACTAGCTCTACWisc-Lba (p745)AACGTCCGCAATGTGTTATTAAGTTGTCAt5g24090FqCACTTGCACCCATTTTGGCAt5g24090RqCCTCGACCCAATCGAGTAAt5g24090miR-sGATTTGACGTAAGCATACCGCCCTCTCTCTTTTGTATTCCAt5g24090miR-aGAGGGCGGTATGCTTACGTCAAATCAAAGAGAATCAATGAAt5g24090miR*sGAGGACGGTATGCTTTCGTCAATTCACAGGTCGTGATATGAt5g24090miR*sGAATTGACGAAAGCATACCGTCCTCTACATATATATTCCTAt5g24090gatFAAAAAGCAGGCTACATGACCAACATGACTCTTCGAt5g24090gatRAGAAAGCTGGGTACACACTAGCCAATATAGATGAt5g24090gatR-STOPAGAAAGCTGGGTATCACACACTAGCCAATATAGAt5g24090gatF2AAAAAGCAGGCTATGCCGTAGGCGAGTGTTTCAt5g24090gatR2AGAAAGCTGGGTGTTTTTGGTTAAAGATGTTTGAt1g07920/30/40(EF1α)Ef1α-100-fGAGGCAGACTGTTGCAGTCGEf1α-100-rTCACTTCGCACCCTTCTTGAAt2g19190 (FRK1)FRK1-FAAGAGTTTCGAGCAGAGGTTGACFRK1-RCCAACAAGAGAAGTCAGGTTCGTGAt4g02540At4g02540-qf1GTACCACGCCTATCTATTAt4g02540-qr1CTCATAGAAGAAACCAGCAAt1g05615At1g05615-qf1GGATTCCTATCTCTACCTAt1g05615-qr1TTCTTTACCCTCATCAACCAt5g58780At5g58780-qf1CTCTCTTCTCTTTTATCTCTCCAt5g58780-qr1CTCCTCCACTCCTACCACAAt3g51010At3g51010-qf1GCGTCGTGCTTTTATACTGAt3g51010-qr1TTCTTCCTCTTCGCCTCTAt1g21880 (LYM1)Lym1-100-fTACAACGGTATAGCCAACGGCACTLym1-100-rGTGGAGCTAGAAGCGGCGCAAt1g77630 (LYM3)Lym3-100-fACTTCGCAGCAGAGTAGCTCLym3-100-rAGCGGTGCTAATTGTTGCGGAt3g21630 (CERK1)CERK1-100-fGGGCAAGGTGGTTTTGGGGCTCERK1-100-rCCGCCAAGAACTGTTTCGATGCCattB1GGGGACAACTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTattB2GGGGACCACTTTGTAC AAGAAAGCTGGGT Primers used in this study DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.016 For the generation of pLYS1::GUS and p35S::LYS1-GFP overexpression lines (LYS1OE), wild-type Col-0 plants were transformed. Stable transgenic lines were generated using standard Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer by the floral dip procedure ([bib18]). Expression of GFP fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody (Acris Antibodies GmbH) and anti-tobacco class III chitinase antibody (kindly provided by Michel Legrand, IBMP Strasbourg, France). The histochemical detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme activity in whole leaves of pLYS1::GUS or pPR-1::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis ([bib75]) was determined as described earlier ([bib33]). Artificial microRNA-mediated gene silencing was used to specifically knock down LYS1 in the Col-0 background as mutant lines carrying T-DNA insertions in the LYS1 gene were unavailable. The Web microRNA Designer (WMD; http://wmd.weigelworld.org) was used to select the primers At5g24090miR-s, At5g24090miR-a, At5g24090miR*s, and At5g24090miR*s ([tbl1]) for the generation of an artificial 21mer microRNA ([bib73]). The LYS1-specific amiRNA was then introduced into the vector miR319a pBSK (pRS300) by directed mutagenesis. Knock-down of the LYS1 transcript level in stably transformed Col-0 plants (LYS1 knock-down line, LYS1KD) was determined by RT-qPCR using primers At5g24090Fq and At5g24090Rq listed in [tbl1]. Off-target genes were identified using the Web microRNA Designer and transcript levels of the four top hits were determined by RT-qPCR using primers listed in [tbl1]. A. tumefaciens-mediated transient transformation of N. benthamiana was performed as described previously ([bib10]). The leaves were examined for expression of tagged fusion proteins 3–4 days post infection. Expression of fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-myc antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) and localization studies of GFP fusion proteins were carried out using a confocal laser-scanning microscope, as described elsewhere ([bib86]). From 5-week-old LYS1OE Arabidopsis plants, 100 g leaf tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to fine powder. After addition of buffer A (20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.01% [vol/vol] β-mercaptoethanol), the extract was incubated on ice overnight. After filtration through four layers of cheesecloth, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on a cation exchange column (SP Sepharose, GE Healthcare, München, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and proteins were eluted with a 0 to 1 M NaCl gradient in buffer A. The elution fractions were monitored for LYS1 activity with the 4-MUCT assay and protein purification was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE. 4-MUCT-active fractions were pooled and exchanged to buffer A using Vivaspin 3 kDa columns (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. For LC-MS analysis, the Coomassie Blue-stained band of the major cleavage product of the purified LYS1-GFP sample was cut and in-gel digested with trypsin, as described elsewhere ([bib8]). LC-MS analyses of the peptides were done on an EasyLC nano-HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as described elsewhere ([bib19]). MS data were processed using the software suite MaxQuant, version 1.2.2.9 ([bib20]) and searched using Andromeda search engine ([bib21]) against a target-decoy A. thaliana database containing 33,351 forward protein sequences, the sequence of the LYS1-GFP fusion protein, and 248 frequently observed protein contaminants. MS data were processed twice, once considering only fully tryptic peptides and once considering only semi-tryptic peptides. In each case, two missed cleavage sites were allowed, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the fixed modification, and N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. Mass tolerance was set to 6 parts per million (ppm) at the precursor ion and 20 ppm at the fragment ion level. Identified peptide spectrum matches (PSM) were statistically scored by MaxQuant software by calculation of posterior error probabilities (PEP) ([bib40]) for each PSM. All PSMs having a PEP below 0.01 were considered as valid. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), protein digestion was performed as described elsewhere ([bib53]; [bib1]). Briefly, the Coomassie Blue-stained band of the major cleavage product of the FPLC-purified LYS1-GFP sample was cut from the gel and destained with 30% (vol/vol) acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Disulfide bonds were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mM iodoacetamide was used to alkylate the cysteines followed by overnight protein digestion with mass spectrometry grade trypsin (Promega, Manheim, Germany) at 37°C. The digests were acidified by the addition of trifluoric acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 0.5%. Extracted peptides were desalted and mixed with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid for Reflex-IV MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) measurements. Each spectrum was processed internally for trypsin autolysis before database search. The identity of protein was annotated using the SwissProt database (542782 sequences; 193019802 residues). To achieve the best possible results, the search parameters were as follows: one miscleavage was set for trypsin specificity and carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were selected as fixed and optional modifications, respectively. At a mass tolerance of 5 ppm, only protein scores greater than 70 (p<0.05) were assigned significant with an expected value of 10−7. Apoplastic washes were obtained from mature leaves of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants by vacuum-infiltrating complete rosettes with 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Afterwards, leaf tissue was dipped dry on paper towels, placed in 50 ml Falcon tubes and spun at 1000× g for 5 min at 4°C. Collected fluids were concentrated tenfold using Vivaspin 500 columns with a 3 kDa cut-off (GE Healthcare). Isolation of mesophyll protoplasts from leaves of 4–5-week-old Arabidopsis plants was performed according to a protocol described previously ([bib90]). Isolated protoplasts were resuspended in W5 solution (2 mM MES, pH 5.7, 154 mM sodium chloride, 125 mM calcium chloride, 5 mM potassium chloride) and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark (2 × 105 protoplasts in 1 ml W5 solution). Subsequently, protoplasts were removed by centrifugation (20 s, 800 rpm, 4°C) and secreted proteins in the medium were concentrated using Vivaspin 2 columns with a 10 kDa cut-off (GE Healthcare). Total protein extracts from the harvested protoplast pellet of 4–5-week-old leaves of A. thaliana or N. benthamiana were prepared using 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, supplemented with 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Approximately 40–60 µg total protein of the leaf extracts or 15 µg of the protoplast samples were added to the enzyme assays. For all in-tube enzyme assays described in the supplemental information, the reaction mix was incubated with shaking at 37°C in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The 4-MUCT chitinase assay was performed as described ([bib12]). Briefly, the hydrolytic activity towards 4-MUCT (Sigma-Aldrich) was measured for 30 min and compared with that of 2 µg S. griseus chitinase (Sigma-Aldrich). After enzyme incubation in 250 µl final volume of 0.05% (wt/vol) 4-MUCT, 20 µl of the reaction mixture were removed and added to 980 µl 0.2 M sodium carbonate solution. Free 4-MU (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for the generation of a standard curve. The intensity of the fluorescence was monitored with an MWG Sirius HT fluorescence microplate reader. For the zymogram, discontinuous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using a 12% separating gel (43 mM potassium hydroxide [KOH], 280 mM acetic acid, pH 4.0, 12% [vol/vol] acrylamide bisacrylamide 37.5:1, 8% [vol/vol] glycerol, 1.3% ammonium persulphate and 0.16% N, N, N, N-tetramethylethylene diamine [TEMED]) overlaid by a 4% stacking gel (64 mM KOH, 94 mM acetic acid, pH 5.1, 4% acrylamide, 1.25% ammonium persulphate and 0.125% TEMED). Prior to loading, the gel was pre-run using anode buffer (40 mM beta-alanine, 70 mM acetic acid, 0.1% CTAB, pH 4.0) and cathode buffer (50 mM KOH, 56 mM acetic acid, pH 5.7, 0.1% CTAB) for 1 hr at 250 Volts. Crude protein extracts were mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer (5 M urea, 25 mM potassium acetate, pH 6.8, methylene blue) and separated for 2 hr at 150 Volts and 4°C. After electrophoresis the CTAB gel was washed with 20 mM sodium acetate, then sprayed with 0.00625% (wt/vol) 4-MUCT in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Fluorescent bands were documented under UV light using the Infinity-3026WL/26MX gel imaging system (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). The turbidity assay was done as described previously ([bib62]). Lytic activity towards M. luteus cell wall preparations or B. subtilis peptidoglycan (Invivogen, Cecolabs) was measured for 4 hr and compared with that of 1 µg hen egg-white lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich). 1 ml 0.02% (wt/vol) M. luteus cells or PGN suspension were incubated together with the enzyme and the decrease in absorbance at 570 nm of the suspension was measured with a spectrophotometer over time. The 4-MUC cellulase assay was performed using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-cellobioside (4-MUC; Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate. 1 mM 4-MUC was incubated in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2) at 37°C for 1 hr in a 96 well plate with either 40 µg purified LYS1 or cellulase (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) in a total volume of 100 µl. The reaction was stopped with 0.2 M sodium carbonate and the intensity of the fluorescence was monitored with an MWG Sirius HT fluorescence microplate reader using excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 455 nm, respectively. 500 µg/ml B. subtilis PGN was incubated with 140 µg LYS1 purified from LYS1OE plants or controls in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at 37°C with shaking for 7 hr. After stopping the reaction by heating at 100°C for 10 min, the reaction was centrifuged and the supernatant analyzed by HPLC. The analyses were done by Cecolabs on an Agilent 1200 system with a Prontosil C18-RP column (Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). The mobile phase was (A) 100 mM sodium phosphate, 5% (vol/vol) methanol and (B) 100 mM sodium phosphate, 30% (vol/vol) methanol. RNA isolation, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and RT-qPCR analysis were performed as described previously ([bib43]; [bib86]). For RT-qPCR, all quantifications were made in duplicate on RNA samples obtained from three independent experiments, each performed with a pool of 3–5 seedlings or two leaves. EF1α transcripts served normalization; corresponding water controls were set to 1. The sequences of the primers used for PCR amplifications are given in [tbl1]. The histochemical detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme activity in whole leaves of pLYS1::GUS or pPR-1::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis ([bib75]) was determined as described earlier ([bib33]). For the measurement of extracellular pH, 300 µl of cultured rice cells were transferred to 48 well plates and equilibrated at 150 rpm for 30 min. After addition of elicitors, the pH in the cell culture was monitored with an InLab Micro electrode (Mettler Toledo, Gießen, Germany). For assays with LYS1-digested PGN, 100 µg/ml B. subtilis PGN was incubated with 40 µg LYS1 purified from LYS1OE plants or controls in 2.5 mM MES, pH 5.2, at 37°C with shaking for 4 hr. After stopping the reaction by heating at 100°C for 10 min, the reaction was centrifuged and the supernatant used for triggering immune responses. Statistical significance between two groups has been checked using the Student’s t test. Asterisks represent significant differences (*p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for multiple comparisons combined with Duncan’s multiple range test indicating significant differences with different letters (p<0.05).
