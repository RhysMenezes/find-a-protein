!~ABS~! The last steps of the Leu biosynthetic pathway and the Met chain elongation cycle for glucosinolate formation share identical reaction types suggesting a close evolutionary relationship of these pathways. Both pathways involve the condensation of acetyl-CoA and a 2-oxo acid, isomerization of the resulting 2-malate derivative to form a 3-malate derivative, the oxidation-decarboxylation of the 3-malate derivative to give an elongated 2-oxo acid, and transamination to generate the corresponding amino acid. We have now analyzed the genes encoding the isomerization reaction, the second step of this sequence, in Arabidopsis thaliana. One gene encodes the large subunit and three encode small subunits of this enzyme, referred to as isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI) with respect to the Leu pathway. Metabolic profiling of large subunit mutants revealed accumulation of intermediates of both Leu biosynthesis and Met chain elongation, and an altered composition of aliphatic glucosinolates demonstrating the function of this gene in both pathways. In contrast, the small subunits appear to be specialized to either Leu biosynthesis or Met chain elongation. Green fluorescent protein tagging experiments confirms the import of one of the IPMI small subunits into the chloroplast, the localization of the Met chain elongation pathway in these organelles. These results suggest the presence of different heterodimeric IPMIs in Arabidopsis chloroplasts with distinct substrate specificities for Leu or glucosinolate metabolism determined by the nature of the different small subunit.

!~RES~! Isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI) in bacteria is present as a dimer, whose subunits are distinct and vary almost twofold in size (Gruer et al. [CR14]; Kohlhaw [CR18]). The Arabidopsis IPMI has a similar structure. The genome contains a single gene for the large subunit (At4g13430, IPMI LSU1) and three genes for the small subunits of this enzyme (At2g43090 (IPMI SSU1), At2g43100 (IPMI SSU2), and At3g58990 (IPMI SSU3))(Schuster et al. [CR25]; Binder et al. [CR2]) whose sequences align closely with the respective sequences from E. coli (leuC and leuD) and an isopropylmalate isomerase of the single subunit type found in fungi (Gruer et al. [CR14]; Kohlhaw [CR18]) (Supplemental Fig. S1). The proteins from Arabidopsis have 34% identity at the amino acid level to their counterparts from E. coli. The Arabidopsis large subunit also aligns well to the N-terminal part of the single subunit type of IPMI from Candida albicans (LEU1), and the small subunit aligns well with the C-terminal part. The alignments of both the Arabidopsis large and small subunits to their respective microorganism counterparts also revealed N-terminal extensions which might function as plastid targeting signals. To obtain information about the function of the large subunit of the isopropylmalate isomerase in vivo, we investigated three independent T-DNA insertion mutants obtained from the SALK, SAIL and GABI-Kat collections (Sessions et al. [CR26]; Alonso et al. [CR1]; Rosso et al. [CR21]) Genotyping of respective plants and sequencing of the T-DNA flanking sequences identified the T-DNAs within the 5′ UTR of the gene either about 50 (SALK 029510 and SAIL 369G04) or eleven nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon (GABI Kat 452D03, Fig. [Fig2] and Supplemental Fig. S2). These T-DNA alleles were designated ipmi lsu1-1 (SALK 029510), ipmi lsu1-2 (SAIL 369G04) and ipmi lsu1-3 (GABI Kat 452D03).Fig. 2Characterization of three independent IPMI LSU1 mutants: The gene encoding the large subunit of isopropylmalate isomerase1 (IPMI LSU1, At4g13430) contains 15 exons (black boxes). The first three exons (E1 to E3) are enlarged and the approximate localizations of the T-DNA insertions of three independent lines and of the oligonucleotides (vertical arrows) used for genotyping are given. Further details are given in Supplemental Fig. S2 Characterization of three independent IPMI LSU1 mutants: The gene encoding the large subunit of isopropylmalate isomerase1 (IPMI LSU1, At4g13430) contains 15 exons (black boxes). The first three exons (E1 to E3) are enlarged and the approximate localizations of the T-DNA insertions of three independent lines and of the oligonucleotides (vertical arrows) used for genotyping are given. Further details are given in Supplemental Fig. S2 Transcript analysis of homozygous ipmi lsu1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 plants by RT-PCRs covering the complete reading frame detected correctly spliced IPMI LSU1 mRNA suggesting that the T-DNA insertions in the 5′ region do not yield knockouts (data not shown). But the fact that the T-DNA insertions in these lines are located just downstream of the transcription initiation site imply that their presence might influence transcription of the IPMI LSU1 gene in these mutants. As expected, quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR revealed that the steady state levels of the IPMI LSU1 transcripts in these mutants are substantially reduced in seedlings and 3 week-old rosette leaves (Fig. [Fig3]). In the ipmi lsu1-2 mutant mRNA levels are reduced to 65 and 50% of the wild-type standard in seedlings and rosette leaves, respectively, while IPMI LSU1 transcript levels are reduced to 40 and 27% of wild type in these tissues of ipmi lsu1-1 plants. Strongest reduction is seen in ipmi lsu1-3 seedlings (21% of wild type), while the IPMI LSU1 mRNA level in ipmi lsu1-3 reaches about 29% of the wild-type level in leaves. Thus all insertions cause a reduced IPMI LSU1 steady-state transcript level, which is most severe in the ipmi lsu1-3 mutant. Further cDNA analysis revealed that transcription of IPMI LSU1 gene in ipmi lsu1-1 and 1-3 plants starts within the T-DNA insertion (data not shown). While the insertion in ipmi lsu1-1 has no effect on the IPMI LSU1 reading frame, the insertion 11 nucleotides upstream of the ATG in the ipmi lsu1-3 mutant introduces another in frame ATG and thus extends the reading frame at the N-terminus (Supplemental Fig S2B). Moreover the insertion in this plant line promotes a severe delay in development, which is not observed for the ipmi lsu1-1 and -2 mutants (Supplemental Fig. S3, data not shown).Fig. 3The T-DNA insertions in the 5′ UTR of the IPMI LSU1 gene change transcript levels in different tissues. Real-Time quantitative RT-PCR was performed three times on total RNA obtained from seedlings, flowers and rosette leaves of 3 week-old ipmi lsu1-1, ipmi lsu1-2ipmi lsu1-3 and wild-type plants. Transcript levels in these mutants (ipmi lsu1-1: dark gray column; ipmi lsu1-2: light grey column, ipmi lsu1-3: white column) are given relative to the mRNA levels measured in wild type (black column) The T-DNA insertions in the 5′ UTR of the IPMI LSU1 gene change transcript levels in different tissues. Real-Time quantitative RT-PCR was performed three times on total RNA obtained from seedlings, flowers and rosette leaves of 3 week-old ipmi lsu1-1, ipmi lsu1-2ipmi lsu1-3 and wild-type plants. Transcript levels in these mutants (ipmi lsu1-1: dark gray column; ipmi lsu1-2: light grey column, ipmi lsu1-3: white column) are given relative to the mRNA levels measured in wild type (black column) To investigate the function of the IPMI LSU1 gene in vivo, the levels of free amino acids were determined in 3 week-old plants and seeds of the three homozygous ipmi lsu1 mutants and wild-type controls. In leaves, ipmi lsu1-2 plants exhibit the weakest chemical phenotype with only two significant changes in comparison to wild type (Supplemental Table S3). In contrast, many more changes were seen between the ipmi lsu1-1 and 1-3 plants and wild type. Most striking is the accumulation of S-methylmethionine (SMM) in rosette leaves of both mutants (0.19 ± 0 and 0.26 ± 0.05 nmol/mg dry weight, respectively). This is accompanied by twofold increased levels of Met (0.41 ± 0.07 in ipmi lsu1-1 vs. 0.19 ± 0 in wild type and 0.39 ± 0.07 in ipmi lsu1-3 vs. 0.18 ± 0.06 nmol/mg dry weight in wild type). Of the branched-chain amino acids, only Val is significantly elevated in the ipmi lsu1-3 mutant (1.27 ± 0.08 in ipmi lsu1-3 vs. 0.84 ± 0.14 nmol/mg dry weight in wild type), whereas no alterations were detected in Leu as well as Ile levels. Apart from that other amino acids show almost exclusively minor alterations. In seeds, many significant but mostly moderate changes were found when comparing among the mutants and wild type (Supplemental Table S4). These alterations do not reveal any clear pattern, except that SMM was found in the ipmi lsu1-1 and 1-3 mutants, while this transport or storage form of Met is barely detectable in ipmi lsu1-2, and is not observed in wild-type seeds (ipmi lsu1-1: 0.42 ± 0.31; ipmi lsu1-2: 0.04 ± 0.03; ipmi lsu1-3: 1.33 ± 0.75 nmol/mg seeds). The observed variations in the amino acid and glucosinolate contents (Tables [Tab1], [Tab2]) among the different wild-type lines are likely due to the fact that not all plants were grown at the same time. Even very minor variations in the experimental growth conditions can lead to alterations in metabolites, such as glucosinolates or amino acids. However, all mutants and their corresponding wild-type lines were always grown together and analyzed in parallel, which allows unambiguous conclusions about the effect of the gene knockout.Table 1Glucosinolate content in leaves [μmol/g dry weight]GS typeipmi lsu1-1Col-0 wild typeaipmi lsu1-2Col-0 wild typebipmi lsu1-3Col-0 wild typecTotal48.16 ± 3.4947.16 ± 3.0420.70 ± 2.8221.83 ± 2.2320.19 ± 1.16*17.67 ± 1.43Total Met GS38.51 ± 2.9440.85 ± 2.9516.02 ± 1.8117.62 ± 1.9616.05 ± 1.0415.17 ± 1.323MSOP23.08 ± 1.89*3.51 ± 0.327.29 ± 0.94*1.67 ± 0.2012.39 ± 0.84*1.36 ± 0.134MTB0.59 ± 0.06*2.47 ± 0.260.19 ± 0.040.23 ± 0.070.09 ± 0.01*0.33 ± 0.044MSOB14.26 ± 1.12*29.64 ± 2.228.10 ± 0.90*13.80 ± 1.583.57 ± 0.23*11.43 ± 0.995MSOP0.29 ± 0.03*1.04 ± 0.08n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.7MSOH0.15 ± 0.02*0.58 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.03*0.30 ± 0.050.01 ± 0.00*0.28 ± 0.038MSOO0.05 ± 0.02*3.54 ± 0.240.21 ± 0.03*1.61 ± 0.370.00 ± 0.00*1.76 ± 0.18I3M6.65 ± 0.47*4.11 ± 0.272.88 ± 0.722.76 ± 0.503.13 ± 0.13*1.89 ± 0.151MOI3M2.24 ± 0.601.50 ± 0.591.36 ± 0.701.08 ± 0.540.61 ± 0.14*0.31 ± 0.054MOI3M0.76 ± 0.060.70 ± 0.050.38 ± 0.050.34 ± 0.050.39 ± 0.04*0.29 ± 0.034OHI3M0.08 ± 0.060.06 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.00GS, glucosinolates; Total Met GS, total Met-derived glucosinolates; 3 MSOP, 3-methylsulfinylpropylglucosinolate; 4MTB, 4-methylthiobutylglucosinolate; 4MSOB, 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate; 5MSOP, 5-methylsulfinylpentylglucosinolate; 7MSOH, 7-methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate; 8MSOO, 8-methylsulfinyloctylglucosinolate; I3M, indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate; 1MOI3M, 1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate; 4MOI3M, 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate. 4OHI3M, 4-Hydroxy-indol-3ylmethylglucosinolateWild types used in these experiments are selected from the seed probe provided by SALKa and GABI Katc, respectively, or from other Col-0 wild-typeb seeds* According to t tests the contents of these glucosinolate species are significantly different (P < 0.01)Table 2Glucosinolate content in seeds [μmol/g seeds]GS typeipmi lsu1-1Col-0 wild typeaipmi lsu1-2Col-0 wild typebipmi lsu1-3Col-0 wild typecTotal160.33 ± 13.15*134.19 ± 22.1484.03 ± 5.2085.52 ± 2.5672.47 ± 19.5168.76 ± 7.99Total Met GS153.51 ± 12.41128.61 ± 21.7481.04 ± 4.9381.72 ± 2.3870.47 ± 18.7365.97 ± 8.143OHP30.05 ± 3.15*2.57 ± 0.5012.29 ± 1.36*1.01 ± 0.1317.75 ± 4.03*0.79 ± 0.223MTP9.58 ± 2.75*0.07 ± 0.052.51 ± 1.42*0.00 ± 0.007.81 ± 5.78*0.00 ± 0.003BZO48.25 ± 3.74*8.06 ± 1.1724.35 ± 2.47*5.05 ± 0.3121.58 ± 3.47*4.32 ± 0.613MSOP2.71 ± 1.25*0.01 ± 0.021.67 ± 1.09*0.10 ± 0.065.20 ± 4.22*0.10 ± 0.074OHB6.46 ± 0.96*9.50 ± 1.715.21 ± 0.67*4.17 ± 0.281.78 ± 0.48*4.35 ± 0.814MTB41.31 ± 4.8853.91 ± 12.0722.19 ± 3.74*29.37 ± 3.2511.53 ± 3.85*19.49 ± 4.234BZO6.82 ± 0.93*22.71 ± 1.367.65 ± 2.52*15.44 ± 0.722.27 ± 1.36*18.50 ± 1.624MSOB3.61 ± 1.172.63 ± 0.452.10 ± 0.541.56 ± 0.242.55 ± 0.63*1.08 ± 0.215MTP3.16 ± 1.00*4.93 ± 0.930.95 ± 0.11*2.97 ± 0.260.00 ± 0.00*2.37 ± 0.297MTH0.85 ± 0.10*5.22 ± 1.031.13 ± 0.36*5.95 ± 0.800.00 ± 0.00*4.03 ± 0.877MSOH0.35 ± 0.06*1.20 ± 0.320.24 ± 0.021.16 ± 0.160.00 ± 0.00*0.64 ± 0.188MTO0.10 ± 0.06*7.67 ± 1.500.30 ± 0.05*7.23 ± 0.640.00 ± 0.00*5.00 ± 1.058MSOO0.26 ± 0.06*10.14 ± 2.100.43 ± 0.06*7.71 ± 0.740.00 ± 0.00*5.31 ± 1.15I3M6.63 ± 0.855.44 ± 2.152.99 ± 0.703.81 ± 0.272.00 ± 1.272.79 ± 0.873OHP, 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate; 3MTP, 3-methylthiopropylglucosinolate; 3BZO, 3-benzoyloxypropylglucosinolate; 4OHB, hydroxybutylglucosinolate; 4BZO, 4-benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate; 5MTP, 5-methylthiopentylglucosinolate; 7MTH, 7-methylthioheptylglucosinolate; 8MTO, 8-methylthiooctylglucosinolate.

Comparison of the ipmi lsu1-3 chromatogram with that obtained from wild-type leaf extracts revealed two extra peaks in the mutant corresponding to molecular masses of 176 (compound 1) and 238 (compound 2). The metabolite with a molecular mass of 176 was identified to be the enzyme substrate, 2-isopropylmalate (2-IPM, Fig. [Fig4]) by similarity of retention time and MS fragmentation to those of authentic 2-IPM. A quantitative analysis of all three IPMI LSU1 mutants revealed an average 2-IPM content of 0.42 and 0.02 mg/g dry weight in leaves of ipmi lsu1-3 and ipmi lsu1-1 mutants, respectively, while this metabolite was undetectable in the ipmi lsu1-2 plants.Fig. 4Structures of 2-isopropylmalate (1) and of 2-(3′-methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (2) Structures of 2-isopropylmalate (1) and of 2-(3′-methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (2) Compound 2 was identified by spectroscopic methods as 2-(3′-methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (Fig. [Fig4], for details see Material and Methods), an oxidation product of 2-(3′-methylthio)propylmalate, an intermediate in the second round of Met chain elongation (Fig. [Fig1]). This compound is formed by condensation of 5-methylthio-2-oxopentanoate (5MTOP) and acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by a methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM1 or MAM3). In contrast to 2-IPM, this metabolite accumulates in all three mutants, while it is not seen in wild type. Relative levels of 2-(3′-methylsulfinyl)propylmalate are 10/1/14 in ipmi lsu1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 plants. In summary the accumulation of 2-IPM and 2-(3′-methylsulfinyl)propylmalate in the ipmi lsu1 mutants indicates a function of IPMI LSU1 in both the biosynthesis of Leu and in the Met chain elongation pathway of glucosinolate formation. To gain more information on the role of IPMI LSU1 in glucosinolate biosynthesis, the profiles of aliphatic glucosinolates in ipmi lsu1 mutants and wild-type lines were compared in leaves of 3 week-old plants and in seeds. The mutants exhibited a strong trend towards increases in short-chain glucosinolates accompanied by reductions in long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates (Tables [Tab1], [Tab2]). In both leaves and seeds, all C3 glucosinolates were amply increased, while all C7 and C8 glucosinolate species are strongly reduced. In seeds also 5-methylthiopentylglucosinolate (5MTP) is reduced, while the decrease of 5-methylsulfinylpentylglucosinolate (5MSOP) has only been measured in ipmi lsu1-1. This redistribution of glucosinolate chain length is particularly strong in the ipmi lsu1-3 mutant, where all C5, C7 and C8 glucosinolates are reduced to undetectable amounts in both seeds and leaves. The C4 glucosinolates can be either increased or decreased depending on the compound and mutant. In summary, these metabolite profiles, along with the accumulation of SMM, constitute strong evidence for the participation of the IPMI LSU1 gene in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates. In our study of the IPMI SSU genes, we investigated two mutants for IPMI SSU1 (SALK 115589, here called ipmi ssu1-1, and SALK 111666, here ipmi ssu1-2), and one mutant each for IPMI SSU2 (SALK 548320, ipmi ssu2-1) and IPMI SSU3 (FLAG 149F10, ipmi ssu3-1). For IPMI SSU1, no plants homozygous for the T-DNA allele could be obtained in either analyzed line. When siliques from heterozygous plants were inspected, they exhibited abnormalities in seed maturation. In line SALK 115589 seed development seems to be aborted at a very early stage, while seed maturation is interrupted at a later phase in SALK 111666 (Supplemental Fig S4). Since in both independent lines the number of mature seeds is substantially reduced and no homozygous mutants could be obtained, an intact IPMI SSU1 gene seems to be crucial for the development of mature viable seeds. In contrast, homozygous ipmi ssu2-1 and 3-1 mutants could be established and the presence of the T-DNA insertion was confirmed near the center and the beginning of the reading frames, respectively (Fig. [Fig5]a, c). Northern analysis of ipmi ssu2-1 (Fig. [Fig5]b) and RT-PCR assays of ipmi ssu3-1 plants (Fig. [Fig5]d) revealed the absence of mature mRNAs in the homozygous plants and the knockout of these genes by the T-DNAs. Both lines, which did not show any macroscopic phenotype, were then cultivated for metabolite analyses.Fig. 5Characterization of ipmi ssu2-1 and ipmi ssu3-1 mutants. T-DNA insertions were confirmed in line SALK 048320 near the center of the IPMI SSU2 gene a and in line FLAG 149F10 within the ATG of the IPMI SSU3c reading frame (black boxes).

A control RT-PCR (UBQ10) was performed as described in legend of Fig. [Fig2] The free amino acid content of the leaves and seeds of ipmi ssu2-1 plants was not substantially different from that of the wild type (Supplemental Tables S5 and S6). The statistically significant changes were only 1.1- to 1.3-fold. No significant alterations were seen for Leu, while Ile was slightly decreased in leaves and very moderately elevated in seeds, and Val was found to be 1.2-fold enriched in seeds. Met levels, often changed in mutants compromised in other steps of the Met chain elongation pathway, were unaffected. In addition, SMM, which usually accumulates in Met chain elongation mutants, was not detectable in the ipmi ssu2-1 mutant. The profile of the methionine-derived glucosinolates in leaves of ipmi ssu2-1 also did not show substantial variations from that of wild-type plants (Supplemental Table S7). Only an increase in 7MSOH and decreases in 8MSOO and I3M are observed. In contrast, seeds exhibited clear elevations of total glucosinolate content as well as total methionine-derived glucosinolate content (between 1.3- and 2.4-fold, Supplemental Table S8). Apart from 4-benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate (4BZO, 92%) all C3 and C4 glucosinolates are elevated (1.5- to 1.7-fold) in the mutant. In terms of absolute values, the most prominent increase was observed for 4MTB, the main glucosinolate species in seeds of Arabidopsis accession Columbia (Col). The increase of these short-chain glucosinolates is by trend similar to the elevated levels of these glucosinolate species in the ipmi lsu1 mutants. In contrast to the latter long-chain glucosinolates are either increased (C7) or decreased (C8). In leaves and seeds of the ipmi ssu3-1 mutant (which has a Wassilewskija genetic background) there were also few significant changes in amino acid content (Supplemental Table S9 and S10). In leaves, reductions were found for Gln (85% of wild-type level) and Gly (52%), which help account for the reduction of the total amount of free amino acids (88% of wild-type level). In seeds, moderate increases were measured for Asn, Ile, Leu and Ser (between 1.2- and 1.4-fold). As in ipmi ssu2-1, Met levels were unchanged in ipmi ssu3-1 and SMM could not be detected. Profiling of glucosinolates in both leaves and seeds also did not reveal any substantial changes from wild-type levels (Supplemental Tables S11 and S12). Both the biosynthesis of Leu and the Met chain elongation pathway are known to occur in chloroplasts (Falk et al. [CR9]; Binder et al. [CR2]; Textor et al. [CR31]; Knill et al. [CR17]) suggesting that the IPMI subunits must be imported into these organelles. Consistent with this suggestion, all four IPMI subunits of Arabidopsis are predicted to have chloroplast targeting sequences by amino acid sequence alignments and an in silico analysis of subcellular sorting by two prediction servers (Predotar: http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar and TargetP: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP) (data not shown). To experimentally verify these predictions, the full length reading frame of one of the small subunit genes (IPMI SSU2, At2g43100) was fused in frame to the 5′ end of the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the vector psmGFP4 (Davis and Vierstra [CR6]). This construct was transiently expressed in tobacco protoplasts and stably transformed into Arabidopsis plants. Transformed protoplasts from tobacco and protoplasts released from leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis plants were then inspected by fluorescence microscopy. The patterns of GFP fluorescence and autofluorescence were identical demonstrating an import of the IPMI SSU2:GFP fusion protein into chloroplasts (Fig. [Fig6]). This indicates that the native IPMI SSU2 protein is also imported into chloroplasts in vivo.Fig. 6Subcellular localization of the small subunit of isopropylmalate isomerase encoded by At2g43100. The full length reading frame of IPMI SSU2 was fused in frame 5′ to the GFP gene (bottom part). The fusion protein was transiently expressed in tobacco protoplasts (N.t., middle part) and in stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants (A.t., top part). Bars = 20 μm.

!~MM~! Plants used for amino acid and glucosinolate analyses were cultivated as reported before (Knill et al. [CR17]). The contents of amino acids and glucosinolates were measured in approximately 3 week-old rosette leaves and seeds according to methods described previously (Roth [CR22]; Sarwar and Botting [CR24]; Brown et al. [CR3]; de Kraker et al. [CR7]; Knill et al. [CR17]). Between 5 and 15 replicates were analyzed for the individual lines. Plant material was obtained from a single cultivation per line. Details are given in Supplemental Table S1. Additionally, the flow-through fractions of the anion exchange chromatography performed in the course of glucosinolate analysis of leaf extracts of mutant and wild-type plants were compared by LC-MS using a Bruker Esquire 6,000 ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) operated in negative ion mode in the range m/z 50–1,000 (Skimmer voltage, −40 eV; capillary exit voltage, −104.1 eV; capillary voltage, 4,000 V; nebulizer pressure, 40 psi; drying gas, 11 l min−1; gas temperature, 330°C) coupled to an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Elution was accomplished using a Nucleodur Sphinx RP column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Mobile phases were 0.2% formic acid (v:v) (A) and acetonitrile (B), starting with 100% A for 5 min, followed by a gradient to 75% B in 25 min. The subtraction of the mass spectrometer total ion chromatogram of wild-type plants from that of the mutants (using the software package Metabolite Detect 1.1, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) identified two additional peaks in ipmi lsu1-3 extracts not found in wild-type extracts corresponding to molecular masses of 176 (compound 1) and 238 (compound 2). The former was unambiguously identified as 2-isopropylmalate (2-IPM) by identical retention times with an authentic 2-IPM standard (Aldrich) in HPLC and identical fragmentation patterns in MS2 experiments in the negative ionization mode as described above. 2-(3′-Methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (compound 2) was isolated from aqueous leaf extracts from ipmi lsu1-3 plants by preparative HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described above, both positive and negative ionization modes were employed. High resolution electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker microTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 500 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a CryoPlatform. 1H NMR, 1H–1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra were recorded using a 5 mm TCI CryoProbe. The operating frequencies were 500.130 MHz for acquisition of 1H and 125.758 MHz for 13C spectra. Samples were measured at 293 K in methanol-d4. Chemical shifts are given in ppm, referenced to the remaining solvent signals (3.31 ppm for 1H signals and 49.05 ppm for 13C signals). 2-(3′-Methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (2), 1H and 13C NMR (see Supplemental Table S2) Low resolution ESI-MS: m/z 238.9 [M + H]+ and m/z 237.0 [M−H]− MS2 experiments with LRESIMS resulted in following fragments: fragments of m/z 238.9 [M + H]+: 193.0 [M−CO2H2]+ 31.8%, 174.9 [M–CH3–SHO]+ 38.3%, 129.0 [M–CO2H2–CH3–SHO]+ 6.7%; fragments of m/z 237.0 [M−H]−: 221.8 [M−CH3]− 7.5%, 176.9 [M–CH3–CO2H]− 28.9%, 172.9 [M–CH3–SHO]− 33.9%. The molecular formula of compound 2 was determined to be C8H14O6S (calculated monoisotopic mass 238.0511) from the [M−H]− ion peak at m/z 237.0427 in high resolution ESI-MS. NMR spectroscopy (1H, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) revealed 8 carbon signals of which two low field resonances at 180.3 and 175.6 ppm indicated the carboxylic functions of the substituted malate, followed by another quaternary carbon resonance at 75.5 ppm (position 2 of the malate). In the proton spectrum only the signal at 2.70 ppm is well resolved (doublet of doublets, H-3a/b). All other proton resonances are higher order multiplets. The connectivity was deduced from prominent resonances in the HMBC spectrum for H-3a/b and the S-methyl singlet, as well as by COSY cross peaks (Supplemental Table S2). Total DNA and RNA, respectively, were isolated as described previously (Forner et al. [CR11]). PCR, RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization were done following established protocols (Sambrook and Russel [CR23]). Oligonucleotide sequences are available on request. Real-Time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis and Light-Cycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Kits on a Light-Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR System according to instruction given by the manufacturer (Roche). Data of three samples were evaluated using the Light-Cycler 480 software (1.5). Relative transcript levels were measured with respect to validated reference genes encoding ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9, At4g27960) and protein phosphatase 2A subunit 3 (PP2A, At1g13320) with established primer pairs (Czechowski et al. [CR4]). Oligonucleotides for the IPMI LSU1 expression analysis were selected using the primer design tool at the NCBI home page (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC = BlastHomeAd). Standard methods of molecular biology were done as described (Sambrook and Russel [CR23]). GFP tagging experiments were performed following established procedures (Koop et al. [CR19]; Däschner et al. [CR5]). DNA, cDNA and proteins sequences were investigated using the blast tools and Clustal W.
