!~ABS~! Proteins containing the evolutionarily conserved SET domain are involved in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and chromatin structure through their histone lysine methyltransferase (HMTase) activity. The Drosophila SU(VAR)3-9 protein and related proteins of other organisms have been associated with gene repression and heterochromatinization. In Arabidopsis there are 10 SUVH and 5 SUVR genes encoding proteins similar to SU(VAR)3-9, and 4 SUVH proteins have been shown to control heterochromatic silencing by its HMTase activity and by directing DNA methylation. The SUVR proteins differ from the SUVH proteins in their domain structure, and we show that the closely related SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 proteins contain a novel domain at their N-terminus, and a SUVR specific region preceding the SET domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusions of these SUVR proteins preferably localize to the nucleolus, suggesting involvement in regulation of rRNA expression, in contrast to other SET-domain proteins studied so far. A novel HMTase specificity was demonstrated for SUVR4, in that monomethylated histone H3K9 is its preferred substrate in vitro.
!~RES~! The SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 genes were originally identified using BLAST searches with SET-domain sequences from Drosophila proteins against the Arabidopsis genomic database ([b9]). To investigate their expression patterns more in detail, RT–PCR was performed using RNA from young roots, seedlings, rosette leaves, inflorescences and green full-grown siliques. This analysis demonstrated highly similar expression patterns for the three genes, with expression in all tissues examined; strongest in inflorescences, weakest in leaves and relatively weaker expression in roots than in seedling ([fig1]). The ubiquitous expression pattern suggests that these SUVR genes are of importance during the whole life cycle of the plant. RT–PCR, cloning of long cDNA sequences using primers designed for the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (5′- and 3′-UTRs), and additional available GenBank sequences revealed that there for all three genes were transcripts with alternative splicing at the N-terminus ([fig1]). The SUVR1 gene expressed two splice variants in flowers and buds with alternative start codons. The SUVR1a transcript consisted of 11 exons, with the putative start codon in exon 1, giving rise to an open reading frame (ORF) of 2064 bp (688 amino acids, [fig1]). The SUVR1b transcript contained an alternative GT donor site in the first intron, resulting in a 39 bp longer first exon. In addition, the second intron, which has a stop codon in the last triplet in frame with the rest of the ORF, was retained in this transcript. If the SUVR1b transcript is to be translated into a SET-domain containing protein, an alternative start codon in exon 4 must be used, giving an ORF size of 1884 bp (628 amino acids, [fig1]). This splice variant was found in five independent clones amplified from first strand cDNA generated by Reverse transcriptase primed with oligo dT. Thus, it was unlikely that these clones represented an incompletely processed transcript. We identified three SUVR2 transcripts ([fig1]): SUVR2a contained 11 exons with an ORF of 2151 bp (717 amino acids). A splice variant with an alternative GT donor site reduced the length of exon 5 by 60 bp, resulting in the SUVR2b transcript with an ORF of 2091 bp (697 amino acids, [fig1]). A third transcript (SUVR1c) revealed an alternative AG acceptor site in the first intron which extended the second exon by 74 bp, and would add 23 residues to the N-terminus of the translation product compared to the other splice variants. For the SUVR4 gene at least two different transcripts were expressed ([fig1]). SUVR4a contained 9 exons with an ORF of 1395 bp (465 amino acids, [fig1]). An alternative splice variant, SUVR4b, had retained the 81 bp second intron, which can be translated in frame without disrupting the ORF, thereby resulting in an ORF of 1476 bp (492 amino acids). To identify the subcellular localization of the SUVR proteins and the effect of ectopic SUVR expression, Arabidopsis plants were transformed with glucocorticoid-inducible SUVR-smRSGFP (SUVR-GFP) fusion constructs (see Materials and Methods). After induction with dexamethasone, plants expressing the SUVR-GFP fusion proteins were inspected by fluorescence microscopy. No GFP was detected in any non-induced plants, and induced plants with high SUVR-GFP expression did not display any visible aberrant morphological phenotype. For each fusion construct the same subnuclear localization was seen in aboveground tissues and in roots. The localization was documented in roots ([fig2]) as visualization of the GFP signal was better in cells without chlorophyll. Plants expressing the SUVR1a-GFP splice variant showed a strong GFP signal in the nucleolus and a very weak signal in the nucleoplasm ([fig2]). In DAPI-stained nuclei, the nucleolus appears as a black hole ([fig2], left, arrow). FISH, performed with a probe against the 18S rDNA repeats, was used as a control to confirm the specific localization to the nucleolus. This clearly demonstrated that the SUVR1a-GFP protein (green) associated with the nucleolus and did not overlap with the heterochromatic nucleolus organizing regions (NOR) detected by the 18S rDNA probe (red) ([fig2], insert). In plants transformed with the SUVR1b-GFP construct, strong GFP expression was in contrast detected in the nucleoplasm, and the protein was excluded from the nucleolus and the densely DAPI-stained heterochromatin ([fig2]). The differences in subnuclear localization between the two splice variants indicate that SUVR1 distribution is regulated by alternative splicing. SUVR2a-GFP expression was mainly seen in subdomains associated with or within the nucleolus, and a weaker signal was present in the nucleoplasm ([fig2]). Additionally, a variable number of nuclear bodies of unequal size were observed in SUVR2a-GFP expressing cells, suggesting specific association with subnuclear regions. Notably, these nuclear bodies showed weaker DAPI staining than the rest of the nucleoplasm, and did not overlap with the DAPI-stained chromocenters. Like SUVR1a-GFP, SUVR4a-GFP displayed a very specific localization, with uniform expression in the whole nucleolus in most of the nuclei investigated and much weaker expression in the nucleoplasm ([fig2]). However, in some nucleoli the GFP signal was not covering the whole nucleolus, but seen as a smaller spot inside the nucleolus (data not shown), while for other nuclei the signal was an intermediate of the two preceding situations. In these nuclei, GFP was observed in the whole nucleolus, with a stronger signal in a spot at the edge of the nucleolus ([fig2]). Putative NLS were predicted to be present in both the SUVR1 and SUVR4 proteins by the PredictNLS server. The SUVR4a protein has a potential NLS with 21 residues at the C-terminus, while the SUVR1a sequence contains two putative NLS, a 17 amino acid long motif in position 16 (NLS1), and a short signal (NLS2) with 7 residues in position 66 ([fig1]). The SUVR1b splice variant contains only NLS2. The difference in subnuclear localization between SUVR1a and SUVR1b suggested that the longer N-terminal fragment (58 residues) of SUVR1a containing NLS1 was responsible for the nucleolar targeting. Interestingly, NLS1 with flanking residues has 37% sequence identity to the predicted NLS motif of the SUVR4 protein ([fig3]), which also has nucleolar localization. To test whether these NLS motifs with associated residues were involved in targeting SUVR1a and SUVR4a to the nucleolus, 35S::GFP-fusion constructs were made containing, (i) the first 176 amino acids of SUVR1 including both NLS1 and NLS2 (pK7WGF2-S1-295), (ii) the first 40 amino acids of SUVR1 including NLS1 (pK7WGF2-S1-187), (iii) the last 27 amino acids of SUVR4 including the NLS (pK7WGF2-S4-NLS) and (iv) SUVR4 without the terminal NLS (pK7WGF2-S4-1535) (cfr. [fig1]). Roots from Arabidopsis plants transformed with these constructs were inspected for subcellular and subnuclear localization of the GFP signal. GFP was not found in the cytoplasm for any of the constructs. The 176 amino acid fragment (data not shown) and also the 40 amino acid fragment of SUVR1a could direct GFP to the nucleolus ([fig2]), confirming that the difference in subnuclear localization between the SUVR1a and SUVR1b proteins was due to sequences in the unique N-terminus of the SUVR1a splice variant. NLS2, on the other hand, is not involved in nucleolar targeting. The SUVR4 27 amino acid peptide did also direct GFP to the nucleolus, but the GFP signal was in addition seen in the nucleoplasm ([fig2]). In the nucleolus a stronger signal was usually present in a distinct spot, as also seen in some nuclei expressing the SUVR4a-GFP fusion protein ([fig2]). The signal from GFP-SUVR4 devoid of the terminal NLS was also found localized in such spots, however also in distinct spots in the nucleoplasm ([fig2]). Thus, this NLS plays a role in the subnuclear localization of SUVR4, although other parts of the SUVR protein seem to be needed to accomplish a wild-type subnuclear localization pattern. We have previously reported that the SUVR subgroup contains no other domains than the SET domain and the associated cysteine-rich regions ([b9]), but the increased number of sequenced genomes and est sequences warranted a renewed search. We used an N-terminal sequence of SUVR4a extending to the first amino acid in the pre-SET domain (119 amino acids) in BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST searches against nr and est databases of GenBank. Protein sequences or translated est sequences that showed significant sequence similarity to the SUVR4 sequence were aligned ([fig3]). A conserved region (residues 21–77 in SUVR4) was identified, and named the WIYLD domain based on conserved residues. This domain, which according to PHDsec and JPRED secondary structure prediction consists of three alpha helices, was only found in plant sequences, and so far only in proteins that possess a SET domain or are without other known domains. The latter situation could, however, be due to the fact that most of the sequences found to contain this domain were translations of partial CDS. Putative homologues of the Arabidopsis SUVR1, 2 and 4 proteins were identified in rice, tomato and wheat (Supplementary Figure 1). The SUVR proteins belong to the SU(VAR)3-9 subgroup of SET-domain proteins ([b9]), but alignment of these proteins to other proteins in this subgroup revealed a number of SUVR specific characteristics. The SET domains with their pre- and post-SET domains, and SET-I region (amino acid 319–349 in the SUVR4a sequence) were highly conserved within the SUVR group (Supplementary Figure 1), but differ from other SET domain proteins at sites known to be of functional importance ([b28],[b29]). The pre-SET domains are extended with a small insertion that contains three additional conserved cysteine residues (SUVR pre-SET, [fig1] and Supplementary Figure 1). The SUVR group has the aa DAN instead of the common aa PNL or PNV just C-terminal to the catalytic core (NHRC), and a tryptophan (W) in the motif ELx[FYW]DY ([fig1], arrowhead and Supplementary Figure 1, arrow). The domain composition, the SUVR specific pre-SET domain and particularities of the SUVR SET domain, substantiate that SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 are members of a particular subgroup of SET-domain proteins, which seems to be plant specific. Since the SET domains of SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 proteins show high sequence similarity with the SET domains of known HMTases (Supplementary Figure 1) we tested whether these proteins had HMTase activity in vitro. The SUVR1 and SUVR2 C-terminal fragments encompassing the pre-SET, SET and post-SET region (SACSET constructs, see Materials and Methods) did not methylate calf thymus histones ([fig4]). The full-length GST-SUVR4a protein was, however, able to methylate calf thymus histone H3, but no methylation was seen when using recombinant full-length H3 as substrate ([fig4]). The same results were seen for a 374 amino acid C-terminal fragment (data not shown). These results indicated that posttranslational modification of H3 ([b30],[b31]) was necessary for SUVR4 activity. In an initial approach, variously methylated histone H3 peptides were tested as substrates. As expected, the SUVR4 protein, showed very low HMTase activity against the unmethylated H3 1–20 peptide, again suggesting that unmethylated histone H3 is a poor substrate ([fig4]). SUVR4 was also unable to methylate H3 1–20 peptides monomethylated at K4 (data not shown) or dimethylated at K9 ([fig4]). In contrast, the H3 1–20 peptide monomethylated at K9 was significantly methylated by SUVR4 ([fig4]). Using antibodies against dimethylated H3K9 on methylated peptide products from the HMTase assay, it was evident that monomethylated histone H3K9 became dimethylated at this position when incubated with active SUVR4 protein ([fig4]). SUVR4 was also able to methylate histone H3 peptides of variable size when monomethylated at K9, but not when monomethylated at K4 or dimethylated on K9 (data not shown). The smallest peptide methylated, residues 5–11 mono-methylated at K9, contains only the lysine in position 9. Together these data demonstrate that SUVR4 specifically methylates histone H3 position K9, and has a substrate preference for monomethylated H3K9. This was supported by the lack of SUVR4 HMTase activity when using a histone H3 peptide (residues 23–34) monomethylated at K27 as a substrate (Supplementary Figure 2A). As the fourth residue of the ELx[FYW]DY motif has been shown to determine product specificity, i.e. the number methyl groups added to the acceptor lysine ([b20],[b32]), the tryptophan (W405) of SUVR4 was mutated into phenylalanine and tyrosine. GST-fusion proteins with these mutant versions of SUVR4 (S4W405F and S4W405Y) were used in the HMTase assay against recombinant H3 and methylated H3 peptides. However, none of these modified proteins showed any HMTase activity (Supplementary Figure 2B), demonstrating that the tryptophan residue is absolutely necessary for the HMTase activity of SUVR4 in vitro. Some proteins require certain histone tail modifications to bind histones ([b33],[b34]). To investigate whether posttranslational modifications were required for targeting and binding of SUVR4, a pull-down experiment was performed. In this in vitro binding assay the GST-SUVR4 full-length protein was able to bind recombinant histone H3 which is devoid of posttranslational modifications ([fig5]). In addition, we tested binding to calf thymus histones ([fig5]), and by using antibodies against dimethylated histone H3K9 ([fig5]) we could show that SUVR4 also bound histone H3 with this modification ([fig5]), although dimethylated H3K9 is not a substrate for SUVR4 ([fig4]). A 374 amino acid C-terminal SUVR4 fragment lacking the WIYLD domain pulled down calf thymus histone H3 equally well as the full-length GST-SUVR4 protein (data not shown). In conclusion, these pull-down experiments demonstrate that SUVR4 binds histone H3 irrespective of the methylation status of lysine 9.
!~MM~! Database searches were performed using BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST against the nr and est databases at GenBank, or the est database at TIGR. Protein sequences or translated coding sequences (CDS) were aligned with the ClustalX program () and manually adjusted with GeneDoc (). The proteins or translated CDS were analysed for known motifs and domains with the InterProScan () and MotifScan () tools. Putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) were identified by using the PredictNLS tool (). Nucleic acids were isolated from wild-type (wt) Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia. The AquaPure genomic DNA isolation kit (BioRad) was used for DNA isolation. Using 1 μg total RNA extracted from 100 mg plant tissue with the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen), first strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT primers and used for RT–PCR. Control reactions were run without Reverse Transcriptase. A fragment containing the C.1 Gateway cassette (Invitrogen) and the smRS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was isolated from the pKGAW-smRSGFP vector ([b21]), and ligated into the XhoI digested and blunted glucocorticoid-inducible pTA7002 vector ([b22]) to create the pTA7002GWsmRSGFP vector. The SUVR CDS were amplified from mRNA from flowers and buds, with the following Gateway primers: splice variant SUVR1a—5′-attB1-ATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-CTTTGTTCAAAATCTGCATGG (SUVR1 GAW R); splice variant SUVR1b—5′-attB1-ATATGGATGAAGATGAATTTCCATTG and SUVR1 GAW R; splice variant SUVR4a—5′-attB1-ACGACGCAGTGAAACAGAGA and 5′-attB2-ATTTGCGCTTTTTAGACACCTC; and splice variant SUVR2a—5′-attB1-AATTTCACCTGGCACTGTCC and 5′-attB2-ATGCTCGCTTCTTCACATTC. The CDS were recombined by Gateway technology first into pDONR207, and then into pTA7002GWsmRSGFP to give the pTA7002-SUVR1a-GFP, pTA7002-SUVR1b-GFP, pTA7002-SUVR4a-GFP and pTA7002-SUVR2a-GFP constructs, respectively. SUVR fragments generated to identify nucleolar localization signals were PCR amplified from sequenced full-length clones using the following Gateway primers: S1-187—5′-attB1-AATCTAGAATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-TTATGCTACACTTTCCTCTGGACTTC; S1-295—5′-attB1-AATCTAGAATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-TTATCCACGTCTACTGCGCAAC; S4-1535—5′-attB1-GTATGATCAGTCTCTCCGGACT and 5′-attB2-TTAGCCTTGAGATCCTTTTATTTTTCTG; and S4-NLS—5′-attB1-TCATTTGCGCTTTTTAGACACCTC and 5′-attB2-CTCAAGGCAAGTCTATAG. The PCR products were recombined into pDONR/Zeo and subsequently in frame with an N-terminal EGFP gene in the Gateway destination vector pK7WGF2 ([b23]). HMTase and GST pull-down constructs were generated as follows: the SUVR1 SACSET sequence, which include the pre-SET, SET and post-SET domains, was PCR amplified with Pfx (Invitrogen) from cDNA using the primers 5′-GGATCCGAAAGTGGTGCAGTTGGCATT and 5′-CTCGAGTAGCCTCTCATGCTTTGTTCA where the underlined sequences represent the restriction endonuclease sites for BamHI and XhoI, resulting in a 1077 bp fragment encoding residues 332 to 688 in the SUVR1 protein. The SUVR2 SACSET fragment was made by PCR amplification of a 1054 bp cDNA sequence representing residues 348 to 697 of SUVR2 using the primers 5′-GGATCCGTTGGTGATTCCATGGCTTT and 5′-CTCGAGCTCATGCTCGCTTCTTCACA. The SUVR1 SACSET and SUVR2 SACSET PCR products were digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into pGEX-AB. The SUVR4 CDS without the small first exon was PCR amplified with Pfu using the Gateway primers 5′-attB1-GTATGATCAGTCTCTCCGGACT and 5′-attB2-ATTTGCGCTTTTTAGACACCTC and recombined into pDONR/Zeo creating the pDONR/Zeo-S4-5UTR construct. This construct was recombined into pGEX-AB GAW creating the clone pGEX-S4-5UTR. Mutated versions of pGEX-S4-5UTR, pGEX-S4W405Y and pGEX-S4W405F, were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primers 5′-GGCCATGGATGAGTTGACATTCGATTACATGATAGACTTCAATG and 5′-CATTGAAGTCTATCATGTAATCGAATGTCAACTCATCCATGGCC; and 5′-GGCCATGGATGAGTTGACATACGATTACATGATAGACTTCAATG and 5′-CATTGAAGTCTATCATGTAATCGTATGTCAACTCATCCATGGCC, respectively. Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia, were grown under long day greenhouse conditions at 20°C. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated by the floral dip method ([b24]), using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 pCV2260. Transgenic plants containing glucocorticoid inducible pTA7002-SUVR-smRSGFP constructs were selected on MS-2 medium (1× Murashige and Skoog salts, 0.05% 2-N-morpholino/ethanesulfonic acid, 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar) containing 15 μg/ml hygromycin. SUVR-GFP expression was induced by growing transgenic plants on agar plates containing 5 μM dexamethasone ([b22]). Plants containing the pK7WGF2 constructs were selected on MS-2 containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Roots of transgenic plants that expressed GFP-fusion proteins were chopped and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on a glass slide, covered with cover slip and squashed. After freezing in liquid N2, the cover slip was removed, and the glass slide was transferred to PBS. FISH was performed as described previously ([b25]) on young rosette leaves expressing SUVR1-GFP. The 18S rDNA probe was PCR amplified using the primers 5′-CTGCCCGTTGCTCTGATGATTCATG and 5′-CAATAAAGACCAGGAGCGTATCG and then subcloned into the pGEM vector. The probe was then DIG labelled by PCR with the DIG labelling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim). A total of 2 μl of the PCR was added to 30 μl hybridization mix [50% formamide, 2× SSC, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10% dextran sulphate, 5 μg salmon-sperm DNA] and hybridized in a wet chamber for ∼14 h. The DIG labelled probe was detected with sheep anti-DIG (1:50 in 4 M buffer, Roche Diagnostics) followed by a rhodamine conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody (1:100, Abcam). Immunodetection of GFP was done as described ([b18]) using a mouse-anti-GFP antibody (1:50, Molecular Probes) followed by an Alexa 488 conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes). All preparations were counterstained in DAPI (2 μg/ml) and inspected with a Zeiss Axiovision2 microscope equipped with epifluorescence attachment. For histone methyltransferase assays and GST pull-down, recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 cells, solubilized in modified RIPA buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 7.7), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 Protease Cocktail EDTA-free (Pierce) and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme] and immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads (Amersham). GST pull-down was done according to ([b26]) and the in vitro HMTase assay essentially performed as described in ([b19],[b27]) using 10 μg of matrix-bound GST-SUVR proteins and 5–10 μg of histones from calf thymus (Roche), recombinant histone H3 (Upstate) and methylated histone H3 peptides mono- or dimethylated at K4, K9 or K27 (Upstate or Abcam). The presence of bound core histones in the pull-down assay was confirmed by Coomassie staining or western blotting using antibodies against dimethylated histone H3K9 (1:1000, Upstate #07-212). Peptides from the in vitro HMTase assay were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunodetected with α-dimethyl-H3K9 (1:1000, from Thomas Jenuwein's lab) to confirm specificity of the SUVR4 activity. Detection of primary antibody was performed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000, Abcam) using the ECL kit (Amersham). The SUVR1 (At1g04050) gene has two different splice variants: SUVR1a (AF394239, 2506 bp) and SUVR1b (2629 bp). In addition, there is a predicted splice variant that when translated contains the WIYLD domain in the N-terminus (AAD10665). SUVR2 (At5g43990) has three different splice variants SUVR2a (AY045576, 2568 bp), SUVR2b (2508 bp) and SUVR2c (NM_203151, 2595 bp). SUVR4 (At3g04380) has two splice variants SUVR4a (2004 bp) and SUVR4b (AF408062, 2085 bp). The sequences used in the alignments (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1) have the following accession numbers referring to the GenBank protein database at NCBI (): SUVR1 (AAD10665), SUVR2 (AAK92218), SUVR4 (NP_974217), SUVH4 (Q8GZB6), SUVH6 (AAK28971), SUVR2_Os (XP_466798), G9a_Hs (Q96KQ7). The TC170256_Ta sequence in Figure 3B, and the TC166832_Le and TC206578_Ta sequences in Supplementary Figure 1, refer to the assembled est sequences at TIGR (). The accession numbers in Figure 3B refer to the GenBank nucleotide database.
