!~ABS~! Fatty acid desaturation of membrane lipids is a strategy for plants to survive chilling or freezing temperature. To further characterize enzymes involved in this stress response pathway, ACYL-LIPID DESATURASE2 (ADS2; Enzyme Commission 1.14.99) was studied using genetic, cell, and biochemical approaches. ads2 mutant plants appear similar to the wild type under standard growth conditions but display a dwarf and sterile phenotype when grown at 6°C and also show increased sensitivity to freezing temperature. Fatty acid composition analysis demonstrated that ads2 mutant plants at 6°C have reduced levels of 16:1, 16:2, 16:3, and 18:3 and higher levels of 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids compared with the wild type. Lipid profiling revealed that 34C species of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) content in ads2 mutants were lower and phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine were higher than the wild type. Subcellular localization of C- and N-terminal enhanced fluorescence fusion proteins indicated that ADS2 localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum, although signal was also confirmed in Golgi and plastids. A double mutation with a putative plastid ADS3 paralog exacerbates the growth defects of ads2 mutant plants under low temperature. These observations suggest that ADS2 encodes a 16:0 desaturase of MGDG and PG. We hypothesize that a low temperature–induced shift from the plastid to endoplasmic reticulum pathway for membrane lipid biosynthesis is required for the cold stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana, and ADS2 is essential to adjust the acyl composition of organelle membrane lipid composition in response to cold stress.
!~RES~! Acyl-lipid desaturases are defined as any desaturases that used acyl-lipid as substrate. Based on this definition, the previously characterized FATTY ACID DESATURASE family (FAD2, FAD3, FAD4, FAD6,, FAD7,, and FAD8) can also be considered as acyl-lipid desaturases, since they all use acyl-lipid as substrate instead of acyl-CoA. Furthermore, nine additional genes in the Arabidopsis genome were cataloged as acyl-lipid desaturases based on sequence similarity with cyanobacterial acyl-lipid desaturases and mammalian acyl-CoA desaturases. These nine members are At1g06080 (ADS1), At1g06090, At1g06100, At1g06120, At1g06350, At1g06360, At2g31360 (ADS2), At3g15850 (ADS3), and At3g15870 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). ADS1 forms a tightly linked gene cluster with At1g06090, At1g06100, and At1g06120 and another pair of genes (At1g06350 and At1g06360) on chromosome I. ADS3 is linked with At3g15870 on chromosome III (CITATION). Phylogenic analysis revealed a close relationship among different members. ADS1 and ADS2 form their own clade (see Supplemental Figure 1A and Supplemental Data Set 1 online), suggesting their common origin through gene duplication during evolutionary history. At the amino acid level, ADS2 shares a higher similarity with ADS1 (75%) compared with other members (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). Sequence alignment indicates that ADS3 and At3g15870 have an extra 64 amino acids at their N termini compared with other members (see Supplemental Figure 1B online), suggesting that duplicated genes could be differentially targeted at the subcellular level, indicative of subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization. Previous experiments have established that ADS3 (FAD5) is responsible for the Δ7 desaturation of 16:0 on MGDG at the sn-2 position in plastids (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). ADS2 was originally projected to be a Δ9 acyl-lipid desaturase homolog in Arabidopsis based on its sequence similarity with a Δ9 desaturase from rose petals (Rosa hybrida cv Kardinal) (CITATION; CITATION). Biochemical analysis of yeast and Arabidopsis seeds indicated that ADS2 operates on either galactolipids or phospholipids (such as PC), but the regiospecificity is different depending on the headgroup (CITATION). However, assignments of protein function based solely on heterologous expression should be viewed with caution since substrate availability or protein subcellular localization in planta might affect preference and, hence, biological function (CITATION). Therefore, we decided to take a genetic approach to understand the biochemical and physiological function of ADS2 in planta. Seven individual T-DNA insertion lines (CS873338, SALK_079963C, SALK_016783C, CS817934, SALK_056540, CS879863, and CS849116) were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource. Using PCR, we could not detect T-DNA insertions in CS879863 and CS849116, although the other five lines were confirmed and homozygous lines were obtained (Figure 1A). RT-PCR was then used to determine ADS2 gene expression. We found that the expression of ADS2 was highly reduced in SALK_079963C, SALK_016783C, CS817934, CS873338, and not affected in SALK_056540 (Figure 1B). Based on this result, for convenience, we renamed SALK_079963C, SALK_016783C, CS817934, and CS873338 as ads2-1, ads2-2, ads2-3, and ads2-4 mutants, respectively. [[FIGURE]] ADS2 expression is quickly induced when plants are shifted from 22 to 10°C (CITATION; CITATION), suggesting ADS2 is involved in cold acclimation or chilling tolerance. To test this hypothesis, wild-type, ads2-1, ads2-2, ads2-3, and ads2-4 mutants were grown at 23 and 6°C. At 23°C, all four ads2 mutant lines grew normally and there were no visible growth defects compared with the wild type (Figures 2A to 2E). At 6°C, wild-type Arabidopsis plants were not injured by cold exposure and continued to grow and develop during prolonged incubation, although the growth rate was significantly reduced relative to at 23°C. However, the growth rate of ads2 mutants was significantly lower than the wild type at 6°C (Figures 2F to 2J). The retarded growth phenotype became severe with prolonged exposure to low temperature, especially after reproductive transition (Figures 2K to 2O). ads2 mutants began bolting at a similar time to that of the wild type, but all four ads2 mutants were sterile, while the wild type produced abundant, viable seeds at 6°C (Figure 3A). In the wild type, anther opening follows flower opening such that pollen grains are not prematurely released (Figure 3B). In ads2 mutant plants, the anther failed to open after flowering (Figure 3C), which might be one of the factors contributing to the sterile phenotype. When flowering ads2 mutants were moved from 6°C to room temperature, the phenotype (dwarf and sterility) was partially suppressed (Figure 3D). The ads2 mutant plants eventually produced viable seeds several weeks after the temperature shift, indicating that the low growth temperature is one of the main factors responsible for these developmental defects. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Since ads2 mutant plants had reduced cold tolerance, we then tested their sensitivity to freezing temperature using a previously established protocol (CITATION). Wild-type, ads2, and fad5-1 mutant plants were grown side by side for 10 d at 23°C, and then one group of plants was moved to 6°C and grown an additional 5 d before being exposed to a gradient of freezing temperatures. Another group of plants was directly used for freezing treatment without cold acclimation. The nonacclimated plants showed a tolerance to a narrow range of freezing temperatures (−4 to −7°C); ∼80% of plants were killed when temperature was shifted from −4 to −5°C. Without acclimation, the temperature for 50% survival is essentially the same for wild-type, ads2, and fad5-1 mutant plants (Figure 4, left). After acclimation, wild-type and mutant plants can survive through a much lower freezing temperature (Figure 4, right). ads2 and fad5-1 mutant plants had a lower survival rate than the wild type between −7 and −12°C, and the temperatures that resulted in 50% survival were −10.0, −8.0, −7.9, and −7.8°C for the wild type, ads2-2, ads2-3, and fad5-1, respectively (Figure 4, right). Since cold-acclimated ads2 and fad5-1 mutant plants can tolerate lower freezing temperatures compared with respective nonacclimated control plants, this observation suggests that ads2 mutant plants still retain the capacity to acclimate to low, nonfreezing temperatures, although not as efficiently as the wild type. [[FIGURE]] To understand the biochemical basis for reduced cold and freezing tolerance of ads2 mutants, leaf FA composition was analyzed from two independent knockdown lines (ads2-2 and ads2-3). When grown at 23°C, the two ads2 mutants did not have significant differences in FA composition compared with the wild type. By contrast, fad5-1 mutant plants had significantly lower levels of 16:1, 16:2, and 16:3 and a higher level of 16:0 than the wild type (Table 1), in agreement with ADS3 encoding a palmitoyl-Δ7-desaturase (CITATION; CITATION). When grown at 6°C, 16:2 and 16:3 levels were 26 and 27-35% lower than wild-type levels under the same conditions, respectively, in the ads2-2 and ads2-3 mutant plants, while 16:0 content was 26 to 30% greater than wild-type levels in the same two independent ads2 mutant lines (Table 1). These results indicate that ADS2 also encodes a palmitic acid desaturase. Even though the leaf FA profile of ads2 mutant plants shares many similarities with fad5-1 mutant plants (e.g., reduced 16:2 and 16:3 and increased 16:0) when plants were grown at 6°C, differences emerged regarding 18C FAs. Under 6°C, the 18:0 content in ads2 mutant plants increased 74 to 90% and 18:1 content increased 87 to 110%, while 18:3 content decreased 10 to 11% relative to the wild type. The changes in these 18C FAs were less dramatic in fad5-1 mutant plants relative to the wild type under 6°C (Table 1). The varying patterns regarding 18C FAs between ads2 and ads3 mutants suggests that ADS2 is also involved in desaturation of 18C FAs. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis demonstrated that ADS2 desaturates palmitic acid, and possibly stearic acid (Table 1), but did not identify which lipid species were the substrates for ADS2 desaturation. Thus, lipidomic analysis was conducted to identify the lipid species that were specifically reduced by ADS2 mutations. Wild-type, ads2, and fad5-1 plants were grown at 23 or 6°C respectively, and leaf lipids were isolated for lipidomic analysis (see Supplemental Table 1 online). At 23°C, although the FA composition in ads2 mutant and wild-type plants was similar (Table 1), several lipid species showed small but statistically significant changes. For example, total PI, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), PC, and phosphatidylserine (PS) content was significantly higher, and total PG and MGDG content was lower in ads2 mutant plants than in the wild type (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Table 1 online). At 23°C, there was no difference regarding the content of total phosphatidic acid (PA), PE, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and DGDG between the ads2 mutant plants and the wild type; however, upon exposure to low temperature, ads2 mutant plants showed more dramatic changes in their leaf lipid profile, with total PA, PI, PE, LPE, PC, LPC, and PS content being significantly higher, while total PG, MGDG and DGDG decreased substantially compared with the wild type (Figure 5B; see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). [[FIGURE]] Next, we examined which lipid species subpools contribute to the reduction of total PG at lower growth temperature. In Arabidopsis leaf, total PG is mainly composed of four subpools: 16\16 PG [PG(32)], 16\18 PG and 18\16 PG [PG(34)], and 18\18 PG [PG(36)]. At 23°C, total leaf PG contained 94% PG(34), 4.4% PG(32), and 1.6% PG(36) (mol %) in wild-type plants (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). The reduction of total PG in ads2 mutant plants exclusively contributed to the decrease in PG(34) pools, including 34:1, 34:2, 34:3, and 34:4, (Figure 5C, left; see Supplemental Data Set 2 online); this was also the case with plants grown at 6°C (Figure 5C, right). We also observed that the reduction in the PG(34) pool in ads2 mutant plants compared with the wild type was greater at 6°C than 23°C. These data suggest that PG(34:0) is a substrate for ADS2 desaturation. Unlike ads2 mutant plants, fad5-1 mutant plants have increased content of total PG primarily due to increased levels of PG(34:3 and 34:4) (Figure 5C; see Supplemental Data Set 2 online), suggesting that ADS3 does not desaturate PG(34). We then examined which lipid species subpools contribute to the reduction of the total MGDG pool size. In wild-type Arabidopsis leaves, the total MGDG pool is primarily composed of three different lipids; MGDG(34) and MGDG(36) account for 74 and 26% (mol %), respectively, of the total MGDG pool, whereas MGDG(38) is only a minor species (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). The content of MGDG(34) in two ads2 mutant lines was always lower than the wild type control regardless of growth temperature and contributed exclusively to the reduced content of the total MGDG pool (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D; see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). We then checked which MGDG(34) molecular species was significantly reduced. In Arabidopsis leaves, MGDG(34) has different unsaturation states, including MGDG(34:1), MGDG(34:2), MGDG(34:3), MGDG(34:4), MGDG(34:5), and MGDG(34:6). At 23°C, MGDG(34:5) and MGDG(34:6) were significantly reduced in ads2-2, and MGDG(34:2), MGDG(34:3), MGDG(34:4), and MGDG(34:5) were significantly lower in ads2-3 mutant plants compared with the wild type (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). At 6°C, MGDG(34:2), MGDG(34:4), MGDG(34:5), and MGDG(34:6) content in both ads2 mutant plants was significantly lower than that of the wild type (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). These data support the notion that ADS2 also desaturates MGDG(34:1) to MGDG(34:2) in planta. The MGDG(34) content in the fad5-1 mutant was reduced a great degree compared with ads2 mutant plants, coinciding with concomitantly higher levels of MGDG(36) (Figure 5D). The data suggest that ADS3 desaturates palmitic MGDG in the plastid, since galactolipids are found predominantly in the chloroplast. Our observation also supports the notion that suppressing the prokaryotic pathway leads to enhanced MGDG biosynthesis through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The fact that MGDG(34:1) and MGDG(34:3) increased with a concomitant reduction in MGDG(34:2) and MGDG(34:4, 34:5, and 34:6) in fad5-1 mutant plants (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online) suggests that ADS3 converts MGDG(34:1) to MGDG(34:2) as well as MGDG(34:3) to MGDG(34:4). Since total DGDG content in ads2 mutant plants is significantly lower than the wild type when plants were grown at 6°C, we examined the changes in the subpool size of DGDG. In wild-type Arabidopsis leaves, the total DGDG pool is primarily composed of three different lipids; DGDG(34) and DGDG(36) account for 26.3 and 72.8% (mol %), respectively, of the total DGDG pool, whereas DGDG(38) accounts for <1% (mol %) (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). At 23°C, the DGDG(34) and DGDG(36) subpool size in two ads2 mutant plants showed small changes (Figure 6, left), but the statistical significance cannot be confirmed for the total DGDG pool (Figure 5A); at 6°C, the DGDG(34) and DGDG(36) subpool size in two ads2 mutant lines displayed a significant reduction compared with the wild type (Figure 6, right). The reduction in the DGDG(34) subpool mainly results from the reduced content in DGDG(34:3), DGDG(34:5), and DGDG(34:6); similarly, the reduced content in DGDG(36:5) and DGDG(36:6) contributes to most of the reduction in the DGDG(36) subpool in ads2 mutant plants (see Supplemental Data Set 2 online). Since MGDG serves as precursor for DGDG biosynthesis, the reduced MGDG(34) content in ads2 mutant plants could result in a reduction of DGDG(34), but the mechanisms leading to the DGDG(36) reduction in ads2 mutants remain unclear, since MGDG(36) was not significantly affected (Figure 5D, right). [[FIGURE]] A comparison of eight subcellular prediction algorithms produced mixed results for ADS2. While SubLoc and WoLFPSORT predicted cytoplasmic localization, iPSORT, MitoPred, MitoProt2, MultiLoc, PeroxP, Predotar, and TargetP algorithms did not offer a conclusive answer. To experimentally determine the subcellular localization of ADS2, enhanced yellow fluorescence tag protein (EYFP) was fused in frame with ADS2 at its C terminus, and the fused protein was stably expressed in Arabidopsis. Protoplasts were prepared from stable transgenic plants, and subcellular localization was observed by fluorescence microscopy. The EYFP vector control signal was detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 7A, top panel). When EYFP was fused to the C terminus of ADS2, the EYFP signal appeared primarily in reticulate structures (Figure 7A, middle panel). Closer examination revealed that punctate spots were within the reticular network (Figure 7A, middle panel). A relatively weak EYFP signal also colocalized with chloroplasts as evidenced from the change from red (autofluorescence) to orange in the color overlay (Figure 7A, middle panel). These observations suggested ADS2 may have multiple subcellular destinations. To investigate if the distribution pattern of ADS2 was specific for the C-terminal fusion, we then examined other transgenic plants in which EYFP was fused in frame with ADS2 at the N terminus. The EYFP signal was also present in a visible reticulate pattern, and this focal position also revealed details of the punctate spots, which were mainly located at the reticular node (Figure 7A, bottom panel). Again, a relatively weak EYFP signal was also detected in chloroplasts (Figure 7A, bottom panel). These observations demonstrated that the EYFP signal pattern is similar regardless of N- or C-terminal fusions. However, the punctate spots were brighter when EYFP was fused at the N terminus of ADS2 than at the C terminus (Figure 7A). However, this could be due to the higher expression level of ADS2 in the N-terminal fusion transgenic plants that we chose for protoplast preparation. [[FIGURE]] To confirm the subcellular compartment of the punctate spots, ADS2-EYFP was transiently coexpressed with ER, Golgi, or plastid organelle markers in tobacco leaves. Coexpression of ADS2-EYFP and ER marker CD3-953 revealed partial overlapping signal within the reticular ER networks (Figure 7B, top panel). Coexpression of ADS2-EYFP with Golgi marker (CD3-961) revealed that the punctate EYFP spots colocalize with the Golgi cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) marker (Figure 7B, bottom panel). When coexpressing ADS2-EYFP with chloroplast marker CD3-993, a weak signal was observed for both EYFP and CFP channels when adjusting the focal plane to the palisade mesophyll cell layer to detect plastids (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Although the fluorescent signals overlapped, the low intensity necessitated an orthogonal approach to confirm plastid localization. Subcellular fractionation of leaf homogenates followed by immunoblotting confirmed ADS2 presence within the 5000× RCF (5000g) plastid fraction at a comparable level to plastid PDC E1α (Figure 7C). A comparison with the ER marker, luminal binding protein (BIP), also confirmed ADS2 is enriched within the microsomal membrane fraction, confirming dual localization within both plastids and microsomes. A mutation in ADS3 has been reported to affect chloroplast biogenesis and plant growth under low temperature (CITATION). To test a possible genetic interaction between ADS2 and ADS3, ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutants were constructed, and their growth performance was evaluated at both 23 and 6°C. When grown at 23°C, there was essentially no difference among wild-type, ads2-1, fad5-1, and ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutant plants (Figure 8, top panel). However, when grown at 6°C, reduced stature phenotypes were observed for ads2-1, fad5-1,, and ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutants depending on the developmental stage for cold treatment and the duration of low-temperature exposure. When 9-d-old seedlings were used for cold treatment and kept in the cold for a long period (81 d), ads2-1 mutant plants showed much smaller stature than the wild type and fad5-1 mutants and the leaves remained dark green. By contrast, the growth rate of fad5-1 was only slightly affected; the leaves that developed during cold exposure were chlorotic (Figure 8A, middle panel). The ads2-1 fad5-1double mutant plants were smaller than ads2-1 single mutant plants and the leaves were also chlorotic, like fad5-1 (Figure 8A, middle panel). [[FIGURE]] If plants grew at 23°C for a long period (21 d) and were then subjected to cold treatment (5 d of growth at 6°C), there was no apparent difference among wild-type, single mutant, or double mutant plants. However, 14 d later at 6°C, ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutant plants were smaller than the parentals, and the chlorotic leaf phenotype was accentuated, with part of the leaf area being bleached (Figure 8A, bottom panel). These observations suggest that ADS2 and ADS3 have additive effects on chilling tolerance, since a mutation in ADS3 enhanced ads2 growth defects under low temperature. To give a quantitative overview of the mutant phenotype and its association with FA unsaturation, leaf FA composition in wild-type, ads2-1, fad5-1, and ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutant plants was measured immediately before cold treatment and after cold exposure for 5 and 14 d. When plants were grown at 23°C for 21 d, the leaf FA composition in ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutants was similar to the fad5-1 single mutant, including higher content of 16:0 and much lower content of 16:2 and 16:3. The 18:2 and 18:3 content in the double mutant was higher than in the wild type and fad5-1 (Figure 8B, top panel). After cold treatment at 6°C for 5 d, leaf FA composition in ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutants was still similar to that of fad5-1 (Figure 8B, middle panel). Although the 16:1 content in the ads2-1 single mutant was slightly lower than the wild type, 16:2, 16:3, and 16:0 content was not significantly altered compared with the wild type (Figure 8B, middle panel). After 14 d of cold treatment, higher 16:0 content and lower 16:2 and 16:3 content in ads2-1 was observed (Figure 8B, bottom panel). ads2-1 and fad5-1 showed lower and higher 18:3 contents than the wild type, respectively. Accordingly, 18:3 content in ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutant plants was similar to the wild type (Figure 8B, bottom). Both ads2-1 and fad5-1 had a higher 16:0 content than the wild type, and the 16:0 content in the double mutant was even higher than in the parental lines (Figure 8B, bottom). Thus, we concluded that ADS2 and ADS3 have additive effects on 16:0 and 18:3 accumulation.
!~MM~! T-DNA insertion lines and fad5-1 were ordered from the ABRC. Seeds were sown in a 1:1 mixture of water-saturated vermiculite and peat moss–enriched soil and grown in a growth chamber under long-day conditions (14-h-light/10-h-dark cycle, 23°C day/20°C night, 50% humidity, and light intensity of 200 µmol m−2 s−1] or continuous white light (40 µmol m−2 s−1). For the chilling tolerance assay, wild-type and mutant seeds were first germinated in potting soil at 23°C under long-day conditions and then moved to a 6°C growth chamber under continuous light conditions (40 µmol m−2 s−1). The freezing tolerance assay was performed using a modified method from CITATION. Sterilized Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (60 to 120 seeds per line) were sown on Petri dishes containing 0.43% Murashige and Skoog salt, 0.05% MES, 0.011% vitamin B5 mix, and 0.8% agar and were stratified at 6°C in a dark room for 2 d. Seeds were germinated at 25°C under 40 µmol quanta m−2 s−1 continuous white light for 10 d, and then plants were divided into two groups: One group of plants was transferred to a 6°C growth chamber and grown under continuous white light for an additional 5 d for cold acclimation, while another group of plants was used for freezing treatment without prior cold acclimation. Petri dishes with plants were placed on trays filled with ice chips and were moved to a dark growth chamber (Percival) with a temperature setting of −1°C for at least 24 h to equilibrate the temperature evenly. A thermocoupler (Omega) was used to monitor medium temperature. The chamber was cooled at 4°C per h, and dishes of plants were removed at the desired temperature (−4 to −14°C), and kept in a 6°C cold room in the dark for 18 h and then returned to the original growth conditions. Viable plants were counted 2 d later. Lipid extraction and quantitative profiling were performed according to CITATION. Unfractionated lipid extracts in chloroform containing appropriate amounts of internal standards were introduced by continuous infusion into the electrospray ionization source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems API 4000) with an autosampler (LC Mini PAL; CTC Analytics). The internal standards used for quantification include the following: lysoPG 14:0, lysoPG 18:0, di 14:0 PG, di Phy (20:0)PG, lysoPE 14:0, lysoPE 18:0, di 12:0 PE, di 23:0 PE, lysoPC 13:0, lysoPC 19:0, di 12:0 PC, di 24:1 PC, di14:0 PA, di Phy (20:0)PA, di 14:0 PS, di Phy PS, PI 16:0-18:0, PI di 18:0, DGDG 34:0, DGDG 36:0, MGDG 34:0, and MGDG 36:0. The analyses of MGDG and DGDG were performed in the same solvent mixture as that used for the phospholipid analysis and with different scan parameters for galactolipids. Neutral loss scans in positive ion mode were used to detect the [M + NH4]+ ions of MGDG (NL179.06) and DGDG (NL 341.11). Collision energies, using nitrogen as the collision gas (gas pressure set at 2 arbitrary units) were 21 V for MGDG and 24 V for DGDG. Declustering potentials were 90 V, entrance potentials 10 V, and exit potentials 23 V for both MGDG and DGDG. Data processing was performed in a Lipidome DB Data Calculation Environment (http://lipidome.bcf.ku.edu:9000/Lipidomics) with normalization to internal standards (CITATION). For FAME analysis, lipids were hydrolyzed and trimethylsilylated. Hydrolysis was performed with 0.5 mL of 1.25 M HCl in methanol and 0.8 mL chloroform at 50°C for 5 h. Following hydrolysis, solvents and HCl were evaporated under nitrogen. Samples were then resuspended in 80 μL pyridine and 20 μL N-methyl-N-TMS-trifluoroacetamide and 1% (w/v) chlorotrimethylsilane and incubated for 1 h at 50°C to produce FAMEs. FAME mixtures were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and 7683 series injector (Agilent). Samples (1 µL) were injected with a split ratio of 30:1 and resolved on a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25-µm DB-23 column (Agilent). Injection temperature was 150°C, the interface was set to 250°C, and the ion source was adjusted to 200°C. The helium flow rate was 1 mL min−1. After a 5-min solvent delay at 150°C, the oven temperature was increased at 2°C min−1 to 200°C and then held at 200°C for 5 min. Data processing was performed using Chemstation software (Agilent). ADS2 cDNA was PCR amplified from a cDNA library by a pair of gene-specific primers; BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme cutting sites were added to forward and reverse primers, respectively. The primer sequences are 5′-CGGGATCCATGTCGGTGACATCAACGGTG-3′ and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCACGAACTATAGCCATACGACG-3′. The PCR products were digested by BamHI and NotI and then inserted into entry vectors PE6c and PE6n, such that an EYFP fluorescence tag was in frame with ADS2 at the C terminus and N terminus, respectively (CITATION). The cassette was then moved into binary vector pSITE-0B by Gateway LR clonase (CITATION). The constructs were transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated floral dip method (CITATION). T1 seeds were grown on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin, and the viable green seedlings were further examined under a Leica MZFL III stereomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence excitation and Chroma HiQ ET YFP filters for the detection of EYFP signal. Lines with positive EYFP signal were transferred into soil. Protoplasts were isolated from the leaves of ADS2 transgenic plants by following the method developed by CITATION. Protoplasts were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX61), and the EYFP signal was captured using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter with an excitation wavelength of between 470 and 490 nm and emission wavelength of between 500 and 540 nm; the chloroplast autofluorescence signal was captured using a Cy5 filter with an excitation wavelength of between 600 and 700 nm and emission wavelength of between 650 and 700 nm. The automatic filter switch, sequential image capture, and overlay were controlled by MicroSuit Basic Edition software. For the colocalization assay, ER (CD3-953 and CD3-954), Golgi (CD3-961 and CD3-962), and plastid (CD3-993 and CD3-994) CFP fusion binary plasmids were ordered from the ABRC (CITATION). The ADS2-EYFP C-terminal fusion construct was mixed with organelle markers individually and cotransformed into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. Transformation was performed by following the procedure described by CITATION. An Olympus IX70 microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software for image capture (version 6.3 v6; Molecular Devices), and Chroma filters 49001 and 49003 were used for the CFP and EYFP channels, respectively. For subcellular fractionation, ads1 fad5-1 double mutant leaves were harvested and homogenized, and subcellular protein fractions were prepared as described by CITATION. Protein from each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for antibody probing. The ADS1 peptide that we used to produce anti-ADS1 antibody is 80% identical to the ADS2 sequence, and initial experiments demonstrated that polyclonal ADS1 peptide antibody cross-reacts with ADS2 (CITATION) since the ads1 mutant is a complete knockout (see Supplemental Figure 3A online), but a proper size band is still detected with ADS1 antibody (see Supplemental Figure 3B online). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to plastid PDC E1α was used to assay plastid enrichment, and a mouse monoclonal antibody to the ER protein BiP was used to determine ER enrichment (Stressgen). The dilution factors for ADS1, PDC E1α, and BiP antibody are 1000, 2000, and 2000, respectively. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase antibodies were diluted at 30,000× (Sigma-Aldrich). To construct the double mutant of ads2 and fad5-1, the ads2-1 mutant was crossed with fad5-1 (CS206). F1 seeds were germinated and self-pollinated, and the resultant F2 seeds were grown on soil. Individual plants were first genotyped by PCR to identify homozygous mutants for ads2-1, and then one leaf was excised for FAME analysis by gas chromatography (CITATION). Plants with extremely low levels of 16:1Δ7, 16:2, and 16:3 FAs were regarded as ads2-1 fad5-1 double mutant plants.
