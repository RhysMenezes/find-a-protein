!~ABS~! The myristoylated calcium sensor SOS3 and its interacting protein kinase, SOS2, play critical regulatory roles in salt tolerance. Mutations in either of these proteins render Arabidopsis thaliana plants hypersensitive to salt stress. We report here the isolation and characterization of a mutant called enh1-1 that enhances the salt sensitivity of sos3-1 and also causes increased salt sensitivity by itself. ENH1 encodes a chloroplast-localized protein with a PDZ domain at the N-terminal region and a rubredoxin domain in the C-terminal part. Rubredoxins are known to be involved in the reduction of superoxide in some anaerobic bacteria. The enh1-1 mutation causes enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly under salt stress. ROS also accumulate to higher levels in sos2-1 but not in sos3-1 mutants. The enh1-1 mutation does not enhance sos2-1 phenotypes. Also, enh1-1 and sos2-1 mutants, but not sos3-1 mutants, show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. These results indicate that ENH1 functions in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species resulting from salt stress by participating in a new salt tolerance pathway that may involve SOS2 but not SOS3. 
!~RES~! Identification of enh1-1 mutant.T2 seedlings from 65,000 individual T-DNA insertion lines in the sos3-1 genetic background were screened for suppressors and enhancers of sos3-1 hypersensitivity to NaCl. The enh1-1 mutant was identified as conferring increased sensitivity of sos3-1 to as little as 40 mM NaCl (Fig. 1A to C). The sos3-1 enh1-1 double mutant grows slightly slower than sos3-1 in medium without added NaCl (Fig. 1A). The severely sensitive phenotype of the sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant to NaCl indicates that it even may be sensitive to salts or other aspects of the normal growth environment that affect ROS production. However, lowering the concentrations of MS salts or sucrose in the medium did not affect the growth of sos3-1 enh1-1 relative to the other genotypes (Fig. 1B).  [[FIGURE]] The sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant plants were backcrossed with sos3-1 plants. All resulting F1 plants (21 of 21) exhibited a sos3-1-like phenotype in the presence of 60 mM NaCl. F2 progeny from the self-crossed F1 segregated 391:128 (sos3-1:sos3-1 enh1-1), which indicates that enh1-1 is a monogenic recessive mutation in a nuclear gene.  The sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant plants also displayed significantly increased sensitivity to NaCl treatment in soil compared to sos3-1 (Fig. 1D). The double mutant gained much less fresh weight during 18 days of NaCl treatment compared to sos3-1 plants (Fig. 1E). The salt-hypersensitive phenotype of sos3-1 was not evident until more severe stress was applied (data not shown).  The enh1-1 mutation enhances the K+-deficient phenotype of the sos3-1 mutant.Seedlings of the sos3-1 mutant have impaired growth on medium containing low levels of K+ (CITATION) and require 10 mM K+ for optimal root growth (Fig. 2A). Root elongation of sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant seedlings was substantially less than that of sos3-1 in medium with low K+. The enhancement of the K+ deficiency phenotype of sos3-1 by the enh1-1 mutation indicates that ENH1 is involved in controlling K+ nutrition separately from SOS3 (Fig. 2A) and appears to function in a separate signal pathway that mediates stress tolerance.  [[FIGURE]] External Ca2+ fails to improve the salt tolerance of the sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant.High levels of external Ca2+can ameliorate sos3-1 sensitivity to NaCl stress, at least in part through improved K+/Na+ selectivity (CITATION). Without added Ca2+, the root growth of both sos3-1 and sos3-1 enh1-1 plants is arrested at 50 mM NaCl. Increasing the Ca2+ concentration to 0.5 mM or higher greatly improves the salt tolerance of sos3-1 plants, but not the tolerance of sos3-1 enh1-1 plants (Fig. 2B). These results further substantiate that ENH1 mediates salt tolerance by a new pathway, independent of SOS3.  The increased salt sensitivity of sos3-1 enh1-1 involves imbalanced ion homeostasis.Without stress, both sos3-1 enh1-1 and sos3-1 plants accumulated slightly higher levels of Na+ and K+ compared to wild-type plants (Fig. 3A and B). When treated with 100 mM NaCl, sos3-1 enh1-1 plants accumulated the highest amount of Na+ but the lowest K+ among the genotypes tested (Fig. 3A and B). Consequently, the ratio of K+ to Na+ in the sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant plants is the lowest, with or without NaCl stress (Fig. 3C and D). We isolated the enh1-1 single mutant from the F2 plants from a cross between the wild type and the sos3-1 enh1-1 double mutant. The levels of Na+ in enh1 single mutants under NaCl stress were elevated compared to wild-type plants, whereas enh1 mutants accumulated less K+ than the wild type (Fig. 3E and F). Under normal conditions, the levels of K+ and Na+ accumulation as well as the ratios of K+ to Na+ in the enh1 mutants are essentially the same as wild type. However, when treated with NaCl, the ratios of K+ to Na+ in the enh1 mutants are significantly lower than wild type (Fig. 3H).  [[FIGURE]] The enh1-1 mutation does not enhance the salt sensitivity of sos2-1 mutant plants.In the absence of NaCl, the growth of sos2-1 enh1-1 is similar to that of sos2-1 (data not shown). The growth response of sos2-1 enh1-1 to NaCl is similar to that of sos2-1 over various concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 4E). The inability of the enh1-1 mutation to affect the salt sensitivity of sos2-1 plants indicates that SOS2 and ENH1 may function in a common pathway controlling salt tolerance.  [[FIGURE]] ENH1 encodes a PDZ domain containing rubredoxin-like protein.We isolated the genomic DNA fragment flanking the left border of a T-DNA insertion in sos3-1 enh1-1 by TAIL-PCR. Sequence analysis indicated that the T-DNA was located 636 bp upstream of the start codon of an open reading frame for At5g17170/MKP11.2 (Fig. 5A). Constitutive expression of the ENH1 coding sequence under control of the CaMV 35S promoter in sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant plants reversed the effect of the enh1-1 mutation (Fig. 4A and C).  [[FIGURE]] The ENH1 gene encodes a polypeptide containing two interesting domains, a putative PDZ domain in the N-terminal region that is potentially involved in protein-protein interactions and a domain at the C-terminal part resembling rubredoxin. ENH1 shows highest sequence similarity in the rubredoxin domain with rubredoxin proteins from Pyrococcus furiosus (CITATION) and Chlorobaculum tepidum (CITATION) (Fig. 5B). ENH1 also shares high sequence similarity in the PDZ domain with the human PDZ domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor I (Fig. 5C).  Expression of ENH1 and localization of ENH1-GFP.ENH1 is constitutively expressed in wild-type plants, and its expression is abolished in sos3-1 enh1-1, enh1-1, and enh1-2 mutant plants (Fig. 5E and G). The transcript of ENH1 is more abundant in the shoot than root (Fig. 5F). Interestingly, we observed that ENH1 expression was also reduced in the sos1-1 mutant under salt stress (Fig. 5G), indicating that SOS1 is a positive regulator of ENH1 transcript accumulation. We also produced Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing an ENH1 promoter-GUS fusion gene. The expression of ENH1::GUS was observed in all tissues of seedlings, with weaker expression in the root tips (Fig. 5H). Strong GUS expression was also detected in the anther (Fig. 5H). The subcellular localization of ENH1 was determined by a transient expression assay of the ENH1-GFP fusion protein, which revealed that ENH1 accumulates in the chloroplast (Fig. 5D).  enh1 single mutations also confer reduced tolerance to salt.The enh1-1 single mutant seedlings are more sensitive to NaCl than the wild type (Fig. 4B and D). This result indicates that ENH1 is required for normal salt tolerance. A T-DNA insertion line (SALK_018190, referred to as enh1-2 hereafter), which has a T-DNA insertion in the At5g17170 gene (Fig. 5A), is more sensitive to NaCl than its wild-type background (Col-0) (Fig. 4B and D). Consistent with their allelic nature, F1 plants (18 of 18) from a cross between enh1-1 and enh1-2 showed a level of sensitivity to 100 mM NaCl that was similar to the parental plants. Both enh1-1 and enh1-2 seedlings grew nearly normally compared to their wild types in control medium without stress (Fig. 4B).  ENH1 and SOS2 are involved in the control of ROS detoxification.Rubredoxins are known to act as electron carriers for various enzymes. Reports have described the involvement of rubredoxins in oxidative stress protection in Desulfovibrio gigas, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and Treponema pallidum (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). ENH1 encodes a chloroplast protein with a putative rubredoxin domain that may also function as an electron carrier. We assayed ENH1 recombinant protein for possible rubredoxin activity and found that it does not appear to act as an electron donor or acceptor in a superoxide reductase reaction system from Pyrococcus furiosus (CITATION) (data not shown).  Nevertheless, an analysis of the ROS levels in sos3-1 enh1-1 and enh1-1 plants revealed that the mutants accumulate higher amounts of ROS as detected by CM-H2DCFDA staining followed by confocal imaging (Fig. 6A). Stress treatment with 100 mM NaCl for 12 h stimulated the accumulation of ROS in wild type, sos3-1, sos3-1 enh1-1, and enh1-1 plants. However, sos3-1 enh1-1 and enh1-1 plants accumulated ROS to much higher levels (Fig. 6A). Staining with nitroblue tetrazolium specifically detects superoxide radicals. As shown in Fig. 6B, under normal growth conditions, sos3-1 enh1-1 and enh1-1 plants have slightly more superoxide accumulation than sos3-1 or wild-type plants. However, after treatment with 80 mM NaCl for 1 day, sos3-1 enh1-1 and enh1-1 plants accumulated much more superoxide than sos3-1 plants or wild-type plants, indicating that hyperaccumulation of superoxide resulting from the enh1-1 mutation is independent of sos3-1 (Fig. 6B). Without stress, enh1 plants displayed a low level of H2O2 similar to that in the wild type (Fig. 6C). When treated with 100 mM NaCl for 12 h, sos3-1 enh1-1 and enh1-1 plants all accumulated substantially higher levels of H2O2 than sos3-1 or wild-type plants (Fig. 6C). Interestingly sos2-1 mutant plants also accumulated more ROS than wild-type or sos3-1 plants with or without NaCl stress (Fig. 6). However, the enh1-1 mutation has no additive effect with the sos2-1 mutation (Fig. 6), which indicates that genetically, ENH1 and SOS2 may function in a common pathway controlling ROS detoxification in response to NaCl stress.  [[FIGURE]] SOS2 and ENH1 mediate tolerance to general oxidative stress.We examined the tolerance of enh1 mutants to oxidative stress caused by conditions other than NaCl stress. Wild-type, Col-0, and sos3-1 plants can tolerate 0.5 and 1.0 μM methyl viologen treatment as indicated by their abilities to maintain chlorophyll in leaves (Fig. 7A and B). The enh1-1 mutation enhances the sensitivity of sos3-1 to both 0.5 and 1.0 μM methyl viologen (Fig. 7A and B). The enh1-1, enh1-2, and sos2-1 mutant plants all showed a hypersensitive response to these stress conditions (Fig. 7A and B). In addition, the germination and postgermination growth and development of sos3-1 enh1-1 and enh1-1 mutant plants are more inhibited by H2O2 compared to sos3-1 or wild-type control plants (Fig. 7C and D).

!~MM~! Isolation of the enh1-1 mutant.Arabidopsis (ecotype Col gl1) salt overly sensitive 3 (sos3-1) (CITATION) mutant plants were mutagenized with Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transferred DNA (T-DNA) transformation (strain GV3101) with the activation tagging vector pSKI015 (CITATION). Seeds from T2 plants were screened for mutants that exhibited increased sensitivity to 75 mM NaCl. Four-day-old seedlings grown on cellophane membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) placed over germination medium (1× Murashige and Skoog [MS] salts [CITATION], 2% sucrose, 1.2% agar, pH 5.7) were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 75 mM NaCl. When appropriate, seedlings were transferred to soil and grown to maturity (CITATION).  Ion content measurements.One-week-old seedlings (n = 40 to 60) grown on germination medium were transferred to a 250-ml flask containing 60 ml half-strength MS salts and 2% sucrose (pH 5.7). The flasks were shaken at 100 rpm under cool fluorescent light (16-h light, 8-h dark) at 22 ± 1°C. After 1 week, NaCl was added to give the desired final NaCl concentrations, and the seedlings were allowed to grow for an additional 2 days. The seedlings were then harvested, rinsed with an excess amount of deionized H2O, dried in an oven at 65°C for 48 h, and weighed. Ground tissues were then extracted with 0.1 M nitric acid for 4 h and filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper. Na+ or K+ content was determined by use of an atomic absorption spectrometer (model SpectrAA-10; Varian, Springvale, Australia).  Cloning of the ENH1 gene.Genomic DNA flanking the left border of the inserted T-DNA in sos3-1 enh1-1 plants was isolated by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) and subcloned into cloning vector pBluescript SK(+) as described elsewhere (CITATION). The entire isolated fragment was sequenced. The primers used in the TAIL-PCR were as described previously (CITATION). We also designed the following primer pair to examine whether the T-DNA insert is homozygous or heterozygous on chromosome 5 of plants that are homozygous for the sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant: forward, 5′-ACTCACACATTTTCGTCAATTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAGTAGTGTGATGTGTGCGTTAG-3′. We have used the primers enh1-2LP, 5′-TTTTTAACTCTTGCTGCTGCAC-3′, and enh1-2RP, 5′-TTTCCTTTGAATCCTGTGCAC-3′, to identify the mutation in the enh1-2 (SALK_018190) allele.  RT-PCR and complementation of the sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant.Total RNA was extracted from different wild-type (Col-0) plant tissues with the RNeasy plant mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and 3 μg of total RNA was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis with the thermoscript reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Gene-specific primers for ENH1 were 5′-CAAAGCTTCTTCGTTCGATCACACTAG-3′ and 5′-GGTTTGCAATTACAAAGCGGACTTG-3′. The RT-PCR product amplified from nontreated wild-type plant tissues was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), resulting in the clone ENH1-4, and the identity of the insert was confirmed by sequencing.  The coding region of ENH1 was amplified by PCR using ENH1-4 as a template with the primers 5′-AGCTGAGCTCATGGCAACGTCTGGTGCG-3′ and 5′-AGTCTCTAGATTATTGAAGACCATAGACAAGC-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned into the binary vector 99-1 (CITATION) under the control of the CAM 35S promoter, and the identity of the cloned insert was confirmed by sequencing. The construct was introduced into sos3-1 enh1-1 mutant plants through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated (strain GV3101) T-DNA transformation.  ENH1 promoter::GUS construct.A genomic fragment promoter including 2,014 bp 5′ to the ATG start codon of the ENH1 gene was amplified by PCR with the wild-type genomic DNA with the primer pair 5′-AGTCGGATCCGTCTCCAAAACCACACCATTGTC-3′ and 5′-AGTCCTGCAGCTTTCTTTCTAGTGTGATCGAACG-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1381Z between the BamHI and PstI sites, and the identity of the clone insert was confirmed by sequencing. The construct was introduced into Arabidopsis wild-type plants (ecotype Columbia) through an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated (strain GV3101) T-DNA transformation. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) staining was performed on tissues or organs from transgenic plants in 1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide (Rose Scientific Ltd., Cincinnati, OH) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with 0.1% Triton X-100 (CITATION). Chlorophyll was removed with 70% ethanol.  ENH1-GFP construct.The ENH1-coding region was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-AGTCTCTAGAATGGCAACGTCTGGTGCG-3′ and 5′-AGTCGAATCCGTTGAAGACCATAGACAAGC-3′, with ENH1-4 used as a template. The PCR product was cloned into vector 326-SGFP between XbaI and BamHI sites, and the entire insert and the conjunction regions were sequenced. The resulting construct was then transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts, and expression of the fusion constructs was monitored as described elsewhere (CITATION).  GST-ENH1 recombinant protein construct.To produce Escherichia coli-expressed GST-ENH1 recombinant protein, the coding region of ENH1 was cloned in frame between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pGEX-4T-1. The resulting construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to obtain the GST-ENH1 fusion protein. Rubredoxin activity assays were performed as described previously (CITATION).  ROS detection.One-week-old seedlings were used to determine the generation of ROS in the root as described elsewhere (CITATION). For salt treatment, the seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 mM NaCl and allowed to grow for 12 h. The untreated and treated seedlings were incubated with 50 μM 5- (and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) for 30 min. All fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Mannheim, Germany).  Quantitative measurement of H2O2 production was performed with 1-week-old seedlings with an Amplex red hydrogen/peroxidase assay kit (Molecular Probes) as described elsewhere (CITATION). For salt treatment, the seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 mM NaCl and allowed to grow for an additional 12 h.  The detection of superoxide was performed essentially as described previously (CITATION) with modifications. One-week-old seedlings germinated on germination medium were transferred to medium containing 0 mM or 80 mM NaCl. These seedlings were allowed to grow for one additional day and vacuum infiltrated with 0.1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma) in 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6). In a control treatment, 10 mM MnCl2 and 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase were added to the buffer. Samples were incubated at room temperature in darkness for 2 h. Chlorophyll was removed with 70% ethanol.  Quantification of chlorophyll.Frozen seedlings were ground and extracted with 80% (vol/vol) acetone. Chlorophyll was quantified photometrically as described elsewhere (CITATION).  Northern hybridization.Two-week-old seedlings grown on germination medium (1× MS salts, 2% sucrose, 0.6% agar, pH 5.7) were untreated or treated with NaCl (200 mM; 12 h). Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was then separated on a formaldehyde-containing agarose (1.2% [wt/vol]) gel, transferred to a nylon transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) overnight and cross-linked. Blots were hybridized overnight (0.5 M phosphate buffer [pH 7.2], 7% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM bovine serum albumin) with 32P-labeled probe at 60°C. Washes, 20 min each at 60°C, were performed first in 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, then in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and finally in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The 26S rRNA gene was used as a loading control.
