!~ABS~! Arabidopsis exocyst subunit SEC3A has been reported to participate in embryo development. Here we report that SEC3A is involved during pollen germination. A T-DNA insertion in SEC3A leads to an absolute, male-specific transmission defect that can be complemented by the expression of SEC3A coding sequence from the LAT52 promoter or SEC3A genomic DNA. No obvious abnormalities in the microgametogenesis are observed in the sec3a/SEC3A mutant, however, in vitro and in vivo pollen germination are defective. Further studies reveal that the callose, pectin, and cellulose are apparently not deposited at the germination site during pollen germination. SEC3A is expressed ubiquitously, including in pollen grains and pollen tubes. Notably, SEC3A-GFP fusion proteins are specifically recruited to the future pollen germination site. This particular localization pattern is independent of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5P2), although SEC3-HIS fusion proteins are able to bind to several phosphoinositols in vitro. These results suggest that SEC3A plays an important role in the establishment of the polar site for pollen germination.
!~RES~! The time and location of gene expression often implies its function. To investigate the expression pattern of SEC3A in detail, a 1024 bp promoter region upstream from the ATG start codon was fused with a GUS reporter gene and introduced into wild type Arabidopsis plants. Fifteen independent pSEC3A:GUS transgenic plants were obtained and six of them were chosen randomly and examined further. Strong GUS activities were detected in flowers ([f1]), mature pollen ([f1]) and pollen tubes ([f1]). Notably, SEC3A started its expression only in pollen from the bicellular stage ([f1]), which corresponded to the stage 11 flower onwards[b29] ([f1]). In addition, SEC3A expression was detected in seedlings, root columella cells, vascular bundles of root maturation zone, and embryos ([S1]), suggesting a role of SEC3A in sporophytic development as well. In Arabidopsis, SEC3B shares 96.6% sequence identity to SEC3A in the coding region, and the two genes are arranged in tandem. It is therefore very important to explore the expression pattern of SEC3B to predict whether they are functionally redundant in a particular tissue. In four pSEC3B:GUS lines obtained, the GUS staining of SEC3B looked much weaker than that of SEC3A which is consistent with the RT-PCR results generated with gene-specific primers ([S1], [S1]). SEC3B expression was not detected in the pollen and pollen tube, although it was noticed in tissues such as the cotyledon, the root vascular bundles, and the mature leaves ([S1]). Furthermore, homozygotes obtained from the progeny of two sec3b/SEC3B mutants (SALK_071060, SALK_124458) showed no observable phenotype. These results indicate that SEC3A is the major SEC3 paralog in pollen. SEC3A gene contains 25 exons and 24 introns. One T-DNA line of the SEC3A gene (sec3a/SEC3A, GK_652H12) was obtained where the insertion was in the last exon ([f1]). PCR-based genotyping revealed that no homozygous sec3a mutant plants could be identified (n > 180) ([f1]). The progeny from the self-pollinated sec3a/SEC3A plants segregated in a ratio of roughly 1:1 (n = 243) instead of the expected 3:1 ([t1]), indicating a disorder in gametophytic transmission rather than a zygotic lethality of the mutation. To investigate if the mutation in SEC3A affected male or female gametophytic development, the sec3a/SEC3A plants were used as male or female donors to cross with the wild type. When the sec3a/SEC3A plants were crossed as female parents, approximately 49% (n = 271) of the resulting F1 progenies were heterozygotes as expected for normal transmission. In contrast, when pollen grains from the sec3a/SEC3A were pollinated to wild type plants, none (n = 224) of the F1 seedlings were heterozygous plants ([t1]). These results indicated that genetic transmission of sec3a mutation through the male was abolished in the mutant, while female gametophytic transmission was normal. Male gametophytic lethal might be due to two possible defects. One is that haploid cells inherited the mutant allele after meiosis do not develop into mature pollen, or they developed normally, but are defective during pollen germination and/or tube growth, or later stages of double fertilization. To address these two possibilities, sec3a was introgressed into the quartet 1 (qrt1) mutant background where four microspores from a microsporocyte fail to separate after meiosis, but their functions are virtually unaffected[b30][b31]. Within a quartet, two microspores are mutant (sec3a) and the other two are wild type (SEC3A). Pollen grain development was examined using the quartets from sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 plants. No difference in nuclear composition was observed in quartets at the unicellular, bicellular and tricellular stages using DAPI staining ([f2]). In addition, sec3a pollen grains were morphologically comparable to wild type under the scanning electron microscope ([f2]), and they are viable as revealed by the Alexander staining ([f2]). Together, these results indicated that the mutation in SEC3A did not affect pollen development. Pollen germination in vitro and in vivo were carried out with quartets of sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 ([f2]). Due to the 2:2 ratio of the wild type versus mutant within a quartet from a heterozygote, germination of three or four pollen grains in the quartet requires the germination of one or both mutant pollen grains. Therefore, a relative low percentage of quartets with three or four grains germinated would indicate a pollen germination defect. When cultured on a solid medium, approximately 31.7% (n = 600) of quartets from qrt1/qrt1 plants had three or four pollen grains germinated ([f2]), while no quartet from sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 (n = 600) plants could do the same ([f2]). In vivo pollination assay was carried out using male-sterile plants (ms1) as pollen recipient to avoid the potentially complicating effects of stigma maturity and emasculation stresses[b32]. While approximately 47% (n = 108) of qrt1/qrt1 quartet could germinate three or four pollen tubes into the pistil as revealed by aniline blue staining ([f2]), none of the sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 (n = 60) quartets was able to do that ([f2]). These results suggested that sec3a mutation significantly inhibited pollen germination in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate that the mutant phenotype is caused by the disruption of SEC3A gene, sec3a/SEC3A plants were transformed with SEC3A coding sequence driven by the pollen-specific LAT52 promoter[b33] in a vector that confers resistance to hygromycin. Transgenic plants hemizygous for pLAT52:SEC3A (20 lines) and pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP (12 lines) loci in sec3a/SEC3A mutant were obtained, and several lines of each genotype were chosen randomly for further characterization. The male transmission defects were complemented, with sec3a/sec3a, sec3a/SEC3A and wild type progeny appearing at the expected Mendelian ratio ([t2]). Moreover, sec3a homozygotes, named as PRsec3a (Pollen-Rescued sec3a: sec3a/sec3a pLAT52:SEC3A/pLAT52:SEC3A), were identified using PCR-based genotyping with progeny lines in which all seedlings showed hygromycin resistant (pLAT52:SEC3A transgene selection marker) ([f3]). RT-PCR analysis of PRsec3a mutants indicated that the transcripts spanning (P5 + P7) or behind (P6 + P7) the T-DNA insertion sites were not expressed, while the transcript (P3 + P4) before the insertion was detected ([f1] and [f3]). However, it should be unstable due to the lack of Poly(A) tail. Similarly, PRsec3a-GFP lines (sec3a/sec3a pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP/pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP) were obtained ([t2], [S1]). Furthermore, twelve sec3a/SEC3A lines bearing hemizygous SEC3A genomic DNA were generated ([S1]). In two randomly selected lines, the male transmission efficiency increased to approximately 2:1, indicating a complete complementation ([S1]). In vitro pollen germination of two randomly selected PRsec3a lines were evaluated on the solid media. Under the same conditions, 78% of wild type pollen grains (n = 672) and 41% (n = 638) of that from sec3a/SEC3A plants were able to germinate ([f3]). Remarkably, in PRsec3a mutant, the ratio was restored to that of the wild type (73%, n = 683) ([f3]). These date demonstrated that the male gametophytic defects were indeed due to T-DNA insertion in the SEC3A gene. To analyze the role of SEC3A more precisely, the dynamic localization of SEC3A in the germinating pollen grains were explored. Our studies showed that the male transmission was restored to normal in sec3a/SEC3A mutant with hemizygous pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP ([t2]), and PRsec3a-GFP lines could be identified ([S1]). These results indicated that the SEC3A-GFP protein is functional in pollen, and therefore should display its correct subcellular localization. In pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP transgenic plants, SEC3A proteins appeared from the binucleated pollen stage onwards ([S1]), consistent with the GUS analysis results ([f1]). In mature pollen prior to activation, SEC3A-GFP was dispersed in the cytoplasm ([f4]). Interestingly, after being placed in liquid germination medium for 30 min, SEC3A-GFP was shift to the cortex of the future germination site before any visible change of pollen morphology was noticed ([f4], [S1]), and the signals oscillated at this position throughout the tube emerging process ([S1] and [S1]). In yeast, Sec3p directly interacted with PI-4,5P2 and marked the exocytic site at the bud[b34]. To test whether SEC3A could bind to PIPs directly in vitro, SEC3A was fused to HIS and expressed in E. Coli. Purified proteins were used in PIPs strip overlay assays. As shown in [f4], SEC3A bound to several membrane phosphoinositides including PI-4,5P2, while the control with BSA alone could not ([f4]). In plants, PI-4,5P2 could be generated through the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K)[b35][b36]. In pip5k4 mutant, the production of PI-4,5P2 and the membrane recycling was decreased in pollen tubes[b37][b38]. pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP was introduced into the pip5k4 homozygous mutant (SALK_001138, [S1]), and its localization was examined. Interestingly, SEC3A proteins still accumulated at the bulge of the germinating pip5k4 pollen grain with bright fluorescent labeling ([f4]), just as in the wild type ([f4]), indicating that the localization of SEC3A in pollen was not dependent on PI-4,5P2. Pollen germination started with hydration, which might act as a triggering signal. Following hydration, plaque formation starts and is completed within 1 h, by then the pollen tube has emerged[b39]. Polar deposition of callose, cellulose and pectin is observed in the incipient bulge of germinating pollen grains[b5][b7][b40]. The phenotypes of sec3 mutant and the localization pattern of SEC3A prompted us to look into the cell wall deposition at the germination site. Pollen grains from sec3a mutant hemizygous for pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP were used since mutant pollen (sec3a) can easily distinguished from the complemented one (sec3a pLAT52:SEC3A-GFP) by the absence or presence of the GFP signal. Calcofluor white which labels cellulose and callose[b41], appeared at the germination site in the complemented pollen grain, colocalized with the SEC3A-GFP signals ([f5]). Similarly, antibodies against callose (anti-callose, [f5]), low methylestified pectins (JIM 5, [f5]), and high methylestified pectins (JIM7, [f5]) labeled the germination plaques in the complemented pollen grains, respectively. In contrast, mutant pollen exhibited an even staining of the cell wall with no sign of germination ([f5]). In addition, qrt1/qrt1 and sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 quartets were stained with ruthenium red, which labels a broad range of methylesterified pectins. Ruthenium red strongly labeled the germination plaques of all four pollen grains of qrt1/qrt1 ([f5]) while only two pollen grains of sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 quartet could be labeled ([f5]). Even after 6 h of germination when a quartet from qrt1/qrt1 plant produced four pollen tubes ([f5]), sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 quartet still had two non-germinated pollen grains that show no sign of polar pectin deposition ([f5]). Thus pectin distribution revealed by ruthenium red is consistent with the JIM5 and JIM7 staining ([f5]). Together, these data demonstrated that polar accumulation of several types of cell wall materials was not observed in the germinating sec3a pollen.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) was used as the wild type. T-DNA insertion lines of SEC3A (GK_652H12) and PIP5K4 (SALK_001138) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (NASC) and Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC), respectively. Seeds were surface sterilized and plated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.8% agar, imbibed at 4 °C for 3 days, and then placed in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle. Seven-day-old seedlings were then transferred to soil and maintained under the same condition. For GUS staining, different tissues of transgenic Arabidopsis plants were vacuum infiltrated for 15 min in GUS staining solution of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM [K3Fe(CN)6], 0.5 mM [K4Fe(CN)6], 10 mM EDTA and 0.5 mg ml−1 bromochloroindoyl-β-glucuronide (X-Gluc). Samples were then incubated overnight at 37 °C and cleared in acetic acid:ethanol (1:3 v/v). To determine different pollen development stages, pollen grains were stained in a DAPI solution (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 μg ml−1 DAPI) for 15 min before observation. The viability of pollen grains was assessed using Alexander staining[b52]. For SEM, mature pollen grains were coated directly with gold particles (EIKO IB-3) and observed on HITACHI S-3000N scanning electron microscope. In vitro pollen germination was conducted essentially according to described previously[b53]. Pollen harvested from newly fully opened flowers was placed onto pollen germination medium (PGM) consisting of 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.01% (w/v) H3BO3, 18% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.0, which was solidified with 0.8% (w/v) agar, and grown in a growth chamber in the dark at 22 °C. For in vivo pollen germination assay, mature pistils of the male-sterile mutant ms1[b32] were pollinated with a limited number (3–5) of quartets from sec3a/SEC3A qrt1/qrt1 and qrt1/qrt1 plants. The pollen tubes in the pistils were stained with aniline blue and viewed with a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM710 system. For the pollen-rescue experiment, the LAT52 promoter and the coding sequence (CDS) of SEC3A were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs LAT52-S (SacI)/LAT52-A (KpnI) and SEC3A1-S (BamHI)/SEC3A1-A (NheI), respectively ([S1]). The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector (CAMBIA, http://www.cambia.org) and sequencing validated. For genomic DNA complementation experiment, about 1.1 kb promoter region along with 8230 bp genomic sequence of SEC3A was PCR-amplified using the primer pair SEC3A2-S/SEC3A2-A ([S1]). The amplified fragment was cloned into the vector pCAMBIA1300221 (CAMBIA, http://www.cambia.org) using in-fusion HD cloning kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). The above constructs were introduced into the sec3a/SEC3A plants using the Agrobacterium (strain EHA105)-mediated infiltration method[b54], followed by hygromycin selection. Confocal images of pollen grains or pollen tubes were collected by UltraView spinning-disc confocal scanner unit (Perkin Elmer). The wavelength was 488 nm for GFP excitation and 505–530 nm for detection. The excitation and detection wavelengths for DAPI and Calcofluor white were 359 nm and 385–405 nm for excitation, 461 nm and 437–445 nm for detection, For the PIP strip binding assays, phospholipid membranes (Echelon) were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T (0.1% v/v Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. After that, membranes were incubated in a buffer with or without SEC3A-HIS fusion proteins (0.5 μg ml−1) in 3% BSA/PBS-T for another hour. Unbound protein was washed away with PBST for three times, 10 min each. The membranes were then incubated with anti-HIS antibodies to detect the bound proteins. Pollen grains were adhered to poly-L-lysine-covered glass slides after germination in liquid PGM for 30 min. Samples were fixed in 4% (w/v) polyformaldehyde in PIPES buffer (50 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% TritonX-100, pH 7) for 1 h. After washing with PBS (100 mM potassium phosphate, 138 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.3), samples were incubated in the blocking buffer (0.8% BSA, 0.1% gelatin, and 2 mM NaN3 in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min and then incubated with the primary antibodies (1:200 diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 h. Pectins with low and high degrees of methylesterification were labeled with JIM5 and JIM7[b55][b56], respectively (Plant Probes). Callose was labeled with anti-callose[b57] (Biosupplies Australia Pty Ltd.). The pollen grains were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer). The samples were washed for five times with PBS before analysis using an UltraView spinning-disc confocal scanner unit (Perkin Elmer). For cytochemical staining, the pollen tubes were stained without fixation after germination in liquid PGM. Calcofluor white (0.001%, w/v) and ruthenium red (0.01%, w/v) in PGM were used to stain β-glucans (both cellulose and callose) and pectins, respectively. Chemicals used are from Sigma-Aldrich.
