!~ABS~! The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential role in plant development and during the response of the plant to abiotic stress. In this study, we report that the R2R3-type transcription factor MYB30 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling. Arabidopsis mutants lacking MYB30 are hypersensitive to ABA during germination and seedling growth. A K283R substitution in MYB30 blocks its SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1-mediated sumoylation in Arabidopsis protoplasts, indicating that MYB30 is sumoylated by SIZ1 and that K283 is the principal site for small ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation. Expression of MYB30K283R in myb30 partially rescues the mutant ABA-hypersensitive phenotype, but expression of wild-type MYB30 complements the mutant phenotype. Overexpression of MYB30 in wild-type results in an ABA-insensitive phenotype, whereas overexpression of MYB30 in the siz1 mutant does not alter siz1 hypersensitivity to ABA. The siz1-2 myb30-2 double-mutant exhibits greater ABA sensitivity than either single mutant, but a mutation in the SIZ1-sumoylated ABI5 transcription factor suppresses the ABA hypersensitivity of myb30-2 to wild-type levels. Our results suggest that coordination of ABI5 and MYB30 sumoylation by SIZ1 may balance gene expression, which is required for regulation of ABA signaling during seed germination.
!~RES~! To identify components of ABA signaling in Arabidopsis, we screened a T-DNA (Agrobacterium-transferred DNA) insertion pool (Col-0 background) for changes in seed germination in the presence of exogenous ABA and identified the 1303H mutant, which was hypersensitive to ABA (FIG-REF). Insertion of the T-DNA fragment in the mutant was detected (TAIL-PCR) in exon one of At3g28910, which encodes the MYB30 transcription factor that has previously been shown to be involved in plant defense responses (CITATION⇓⇓⇓⇓–CITATION) (FIG-REF). As a result, 1303H was renamed as myb30-2. The phenotype of myb30-1 (SALK_122884), an allelic mutant obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC), was similar to that of myb30-2 (FIG-REF and Fig. S1). The expression of MYB30 was abolished in both myb30-1 and myb30-2 (FIG-REF). Germination and primary root growth of the myb30 mutants was hypersensitive to ABA (0.1–0.5 μM), compared with these processes in wild-type (FIG-REF and Fig. S1). Cotyledon greenness of the myb30 mutants was also sensitive to mannitol. Because there was no significant difference in seedling growth and leaf water loss under osmotic/drought stress between the mutant and wild-type (Fig. S1), mutant sensitivity to mannitol postgermination provides additional evidence that MYB30 mainly functions in regulation of seed germination and very early seedling development. [[FIGURE]] To determine if MYB30 functions in previously identified ABA signaling pathways, we crossed myb30-2 to abi1-3, abi2-2, abi3, abi4, and abi5-8 (all in Col-0) (CITATION⇓⇓⇓–CITATION). Double-mutants of abi1-3 myb30-2 and abi2-2 myb30-2 exhibited enhanced ABA sensitivity relative to their single mutants, suggesting that MYB30 functions in parallel pathways with ABI1 or ABI2 during ABA signaling (Fig. S2). Double-mutants of abi3 myb30-2 and abi4 myb30-2 exhibited an ABA-insensitive phenotype similar to abi3 and abi4 single mutants (Fig. S2), suggesting that abi3 and abi4 are epistatic to myb30. However, double-mutants of abi5-8 myb30-2 exhibited a wild-type–like phenotype during seed germination (FIG-REF), suggesting that ABI5 and MYB30 may function in parallel pathways to coordinately regulate ABA signaling. [[FIGURE]] MYB30 has been shown to regulate defense and brassinosteroid (BR) responses by mediating the expression of genes involved in very long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and the BES1 (bri1-Ethylmethane Sulphonate suppressor1) transcriptional activator in BR signaling, respectively (CITATION, CITATION). To determine if MYB30 also regulates ABI5 target genes in response to ABA, expression of EM1, EM6, RAB18, ADH, and RD29 was examined in myb-30 mutants; no significant difference was observed between wild-type and myb30. Consistent with these results, the expression of ABI5 did not change in myb30, and expression of MYB30 was not affected by the abi5 mutation (FIG-REF). These results suggest that ABI5 and MYB30 regulate different sets of genes and that ABI5 and MYB30 do not regulate each other. The expression of MYB30 was reduced by ABA treatment (FIG-REF). ABA induces the expression of many plant genes associated with germination and dehydration responses (CITATION). To identify ABA-responsive genes regulated by MYB30, wild-type and myb30-2 mutant seedlings were treated with 100 μM ABA for 3 h, and ABA-responsive gene expression was examined by Solexa mRNA sequencing analysis. The expression of 120 vs. 41 genes was induced and reduced 1.5-fold in myb30-2 compared with expression in wild-type (Table S1). Expression differences of four stress-responsive genes, COR413, COR15B, LOX3, and BGL2, were confirmed by real-time PCR (FIG-REF). In the myb30-2 mutant, the induction of COR413 and COR15B was substantially lower and the induction of LOX3 and BGL2 was significantly higher than their expression in wild-type. The expression of COR15B, LOX3, and BGL2 was regulated in the opposite manner by ABA in the abi5-8 and myb30-2 mutants (FIG-REF). Consistent with the seed-germination phenotype in single and double myb30 and abi5 plants, the expression of COR413, COR15B, LOX3, and BGL2 in response to ABA in the abi5-8 myb30-2 double-mutant was similar to that in wild-type, suggesting that MYB30 and ABI5 may work in parallel to regulate the balance of gene expression during ABA signaling (FIG-REF). Okada et al. (CITATION) used SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes to reconstitute the Arabidopsis sumoylation cascade in Escherichia coli and showed that the K283 of MYB30 was the major sumoylation site (FIG-REF). To determine if MYB30 is sumoylated in Arabidopsis, and if the target is K283, we generated 35S:Myc-SUMO1, 35S:Flag-MYB30, 35S:Flag-MYB30K283R, 35S:Flag-MYB30K232R, and 35S:Flag-MYB30K250R constructs. Myc-SUMO1 plasmid was cotransformed with these Flag-MYB30 plasmids individually into wild-type protoplasts. SUMO1 conjugation of MYB30 (FIG-REF) was detected in protein extracts isolated from MYB30, MYB30K232R, and MYB30K250R, but not in MYB30K283R. These results indicate that the sumoylation of MYB30 occurs in Arabidopsis at residue K283. [[FIGURE]] To examine if sumoylation of MYB30 is required for its function in ABA signaling, we transferred 35S:Flag-MYB30 or 35S:Flag-MYB30K283R plasmids into myb30-2 plants. Two transgenic lines with equivalent expression of MYB30K283R or MYB30 (Fig. S3) were tested for ABA sensitivity. Expression of MYB30 rescued the myb30-2 ABA-sensitive phenotype; however, expression of an equivalent amount of MYB30K283R only partially reduced myb30-2 ABA sensitivity (FIG-REF), suggesting that sumoylation of K283 is critical for MYB30 function during ABA signaling. SIZ1 is a SUMO E3 ligase identified in Arabidopsis and shown to play an important role in responses to ABA through sumoylation of ABI5 (CITATION). Our results showing that MYB30 is sumoylated in Arabidopsis and works in parallel with ABI5 suggested that MYB30 may also be a target for SIZ1. To test this hypothesis, 35S:Myc-SUMO1 and 35S:Flag-MYB30 or 35S:Flag-MYB30K283R were transferred into either wild-type or siz1-2 protoplasts, and the sumoylation of MYB30 was monitored. Sumoylation was detected in wild-type but not in the siz1-2 mutant, demonstrating that SIZ1 modulates the sumoylation of MYB30 (FIG-REF). [[FIGURE]] To determine if SIZ1-dependent sumoylation of MYB30 is critical for the response of the plant to ABA, we generated the siz1-2 myb30-2 double-mutant and expressed Flag-MYB30 in wild-type and siz1-2 plants. The double mutant exhibited enhanced ABA sensitivity compared with either single mutant (FIG-REF and Fig. S3). Overexpression of MYB30 in wild-type resulted in transgenic plants that were insensitive to ABA during germination (FIG-REF); however, overexpression of MYB30 at a similar level in siz1-2 (Fig. S3) did not affect the ABA-sensitive phenotype of the mutant (FIG-REF). The ABA-sensitive phenotype of the siz1 mutant may be because of the activation of ABI5 and inactivation of MYB30. In the siz1-2 myb30-2 double-mutant, MBY30 is absent and ABI5 is activated; therefore, the double-mutant would be expected to be more sensitive to ABA than either single mutant. Sumoylation plays a role in protein–protein interaction, protein subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and stability. To determine the biological function of MYB30 sumoylation, we expressed 35S:MYB30-GFP or 35S:MYB30K283R-GFP in wild-type protoplasts. Both MYB30-GFP and MYB30K283R-GFP localized to the nucleus (Fig. S4A). To examine if sumoylation changes MYB30 transcriptional activity, the Arabidopsis proteins were expressed in yeast, as previously reported (CITATION). The MYB30K283R mutation did not significantly affect MYB30 transcriptional activity in yeast (Fig. S4B). The 35S:Flag-MYB30 transgenic wild-type and siz1-2 lines were then used to determine if sumoylation affects the stability of MYB30. The sumoylation of MYB30 was not significantly affected by ABA treatment (FIG-REF); however, in the presence of ABA, MYB30 was less abundant in the siz1-2 seedlings than in the wild-type seedlings (FIG-REF). These data suggest that sumoylation by SIZ1 stabilizes MYB30. The expression of the TAT3, LOX3, BGL2, bHLH, COR15b, and COR413 ABA responsive genes was rescued by expression MYB30 but not by MYB30K283R (FIG-REF). These data, together with the results showing that MYB30K283R partially reduced myb30-2 ABA sensitivity, suggest that sumoylation of MYB30 by SIZ1 may also affect its transcriptional activity.

!~MM~! Arabidopsis seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 0.3% agar, kept in the dark for 3 d at 4 °C to break dormancy, and then grown in a growth chamber at 23 °C in constant light. To monitor ABA sensitivity, seeds were sown on MS medium or MS medium containing the indicated concentrations of ABA (Sigma). Germination frequencies were obtained by scoring green cotyledons for an average of 100 seeds from three independent experiments ± SE. Stable WT::MYB30 and siz1-2::MYB30 T4 lines were used to monitor ABA-induced MYB30 degradation. Eight-day-old seedlings were treated with water (0 h) or ABA for 12 or 24 h. Seedlings were homogenized on ices in extraction buffer [10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% (vol/vol) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)]. Extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatant was used to detect MYB30 levels in wild-type or siz1-2 seedlings by immunoblot analysis. The Arabidopsis siz1-2 mutant was kindly provided by Paul M. Hasegawa (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). The myb30-1 (SALK_122884), abi1-3 (SALK_076309), abi2-2 (SALK_015166), abi3 (SALK_138922), abi4 (SALK_080095), and abi5-8 (SALK_013163) mutants were obtained from the ABRC. The MYB30 or MYB30K283R coding region was cloned into the pCAMBIA1307-Flag binary vector driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. MYB30 or MYB30 (K283R) overexpressing transgenic plants (in the Col-0, myb30-2 or siz1-2 backgrounds) were generated using Agrobacterium-mediated floral transformation. RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis were used to detect the abundance of the transgenes and proteins. Stable WT::MYB30, siz1-2::MYB30, myb30-2::MYB30 and myb30-2::MYB30K283R T4 lines were used for phenotypic analyses. Seven-day-old seedlings grown on MS plates were used for ABA treatments. The seedlings were harvested for RNA extraction after treatment with 100 μM ABA for 3 h. Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR amplification were as described (CITATION, CITATION). The primer pairs used are shown in Table S2. The value of wild-type without ABA treatment (0 h) was normalized to 1 with differences calculated as relative expression. For transient expression of MYB30 and SUMO1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts, the SUMO1 coding region was amplified and inserted into the pCAMBIA1205-Myc plasmid to produce the Myc-SUMO1 fusion protein. The 35S:Flag-MYB30 and 35S:Myc-SUMO1 were coexpressed in wild-type or siz1-2 protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation (CITATION). After a 20-h incubation at 23 °C, the protoplasts were harvested and lysed in 1 mL extraction buffer. For ABA treatment, protoplasts were incubated with ABA (at a final concentration of 40 μM) at 23 °C for 1 h (CITATION). Fifteen microliters of anti-Flag agarose conjugate (Sigma) were incubated with the extract supernatant for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing five times in 1 mL of extraction buffer, proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis (CITATION). Anti-Myc (Sigma) antibody was used to detect the Flag-MYB30-Myc-SUMO1 conjugation. Anti-Flag (Sigma) antibody was used to detect the abundance of Flag-MYB30 as a control.
