!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis thaliana pho2 mutant, which is defective in a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, displays inorganic phosphate (Pi) toxicity as a result of enhanced uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of Pi. To elucidate downstream components of the PHO2-dependent regulatory pathway, we identified two pho2 suppressors as carrying missense mutations in PHO1, which has been implicated in Pi loading to the xylem. In support of the genetic interaction between PHO1 and PHO2, we found that the protein level of PHO1 is increased in pho2, whereas such accumulation is ameliorated in both pho2 suppressors. Results from cycloheximide and endosomal Cys protease inhibitor E-64d treatments further suggest that PHO1 degradation is PHO2 dependent and involves multivesicular body–mediated vacuolar proteolysis. Using the transient expression system of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves, we demonstrated that PHO1 and PHO2 are partially colocalized and physically interact in the endomembranes, where the ubiquitin conjugase activity of PHO2 is required for PHO1 degradation. In addition, reduced PHO1 expression caused by PHO1 mutations impede Pi uptake, indicating a functional association between xylem loading and acquisition of Pi. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal molecular mechanism by which PHO2 modulates the degradation of PHO1 in the endomembranes to maintain Pi homeostasis in plants.
!~RES~! The genetic screening for the pho2 suppressor was performed using ethyl methanesulfonate–induced mutagenesis. From the M2 population of ∼13,000 plants grown in fertilized soils mixed with 1 mM KH2PO4, we identified two suppressors, s1 and s80, which did not display the Pi toxicity phenotype of pho2 but showed improved growth (Figure 1A). By measuring the shoot Pi concentration of s1 and s80 M3 plants and verifying that the pho2 point mutation remained in the mutants, we confirmed that both are indeed pho2 suppressors. Compared with pho2 grown under Pi-sufficient conditions (+Pi; 250 μM KH2PO4), s1 and s80 seedlings had lower shoot Pi concentrations yet higher root Pi concentrations (Figure 1B). In addition, while pho2 exhibited a higher shoot-to-root ratio of total Pi distribution than the wild-type controls under +Pi conditions, the tendency was ameliorated in s1 and s80 (Figure 1C). Notably, when s1 was grown hydroponically to an adult stage under +Pi conditions, the shoot Pi concentration of s1 was nearly as low as that of the wild type under –Pi conditions (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). However, s1 did not show the characteristic symptoms of shoot Pi deficiency, such as anthocyanin accumulation (Figure 1A). By contrast, the adult s80 grown hydroponically under +Pi conditions was slightly smaller than the wild type and had an intermediate shoot Pi concentration between that of pho2 and the wild type (Figure 1A; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). [[FIGURE]] As the pho1-2 pho2 double mutant has been shown to display the pho1-2–like phenotype, pho1-2 was suggested to be epistatic to pho2 (CITATION). It is tempting to suspect that disruption of PHO1 in the pho2 mutant may disrupt an inevitable step of Pi accumulation, the root-to-shoot translocation of Pi, thereby rendering the phenotype of pho1-2 pho2 similar to that of pho1-2 (Figures 1A and 1B). Considering that mutations in PHO1 may hamper Pi accumulation in the shoot of pho2 through a similar mechanism as assumed in pho1-2 pho2, we then sequenced the coding sequence of PHO1 in s1 and s80 before proceeding with the map-based cloning. Intriguingly, the point mutations G43A and G934A of PHO1 were identified in s1 and s80, respectively. Both mutations reside in the SPX domain of PHO1, causing substitution of two amino acid residues conserved among the Arabidopsis PHO1 family: Glu for Lys at position 15 (E15K) in s1 and Ala for Thr at position 312 (A312T) in s80 (Figures 2A and 2B). [[FIGURE]] To determine the genetic inheritance of s1, we backcrossed s1 to pho2. By examining the distribution and range of shoot Pi concentrations among the F2 progeny, we ensured that the pho2 suppressor phenotype was segregated in the F2 population as a single locus (see Supplemental Figure 2A online). Interestingly, we found that one peak representing the s1-like population within the range of wild-type controls was followed by two close pho2-like peaks (see Supplemental Figure 2B online), indicating that s1 is not a simple recessive mutation. Next, we introduced the genomic fragment encompassing the PHO1 coding region, spanning from 3587 bp upstream of the start codon to 523 bp downstream of the stop codon, to complement s1 and s80. Because the exogenous expression of wild-type PHO1 restored the capacity of both pho2 suppressors to accumulate more Pi in the shoot (see Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B online), we inferred that the missense mutations of PHO1 in s1 and s80 would contribute to the suppression of Pi accumulation. In fact, these complemented lines accumulated more shoot Pi than pho2 due to the overexpression of PHO1 (see below). Four PHO1 alleles with point mutations have been previously isolated (pho1-1 to pho1-4), presumably leading to the synthesis of truncated PHO1 proteins (CITATION). Here, with the identification of s1 and s80, we isolated two additional PHO1 alleles designated pho1-5 and pho1-6, respectively (Figure 2A), and therefore used pho1-5 pho2 and pho1-6 pho2 designations, respectively, for s1 and s80 in the following text. [[FIGURE]] To further explore the genetic inheritance of pho1-5 and pho1-6 mutations, we grew the F1 progeny of pho1-5 pho2 × pho2 and pho1-6 pho2 × pho2 in hydroponic culture to an adult stage. Interestingly, the pho1-5 and pho1-6 heterozygotes in the pho2 background (pho1-5/+; pho2/pho2 and pho1-6/+; pho2/pho2) showed intermediate shoot Pi concentrations between their respective parents (Figure 3), suggesting that one copy of the pho1-5 or pho1-6 allele is sufficient to partially suppress the Pi toxicity of pho2. These results also confirmed our speculation that the two close pho2-like peaks in the F2 segregation analysis of s1 (pho1-5 pho2) × pho2 represented the pho1-5 heterozygotes and pho2, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 2B online). In a similar fashion, the pho2 mutants harboring one copy of the pho1-2 allele (pho1-2/+; pho2/pho2) also displayed intermediate shoot Pi concentrations between pho2 and pho1-2 pho2 (Figure 3). Because these observations appeared contradictory to the earlier report showing that pho1-2 is a recessive allele (CITATION), we thus reexamined the shoot Pi concentration of pho1-2/+ in the wild-type background. The shoot Pi level of pho1-2/+ was only slightly but significantly lower than that of wild-type plants (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Apparently, the effects of the pho1-2 alleles on the suppression of shoot Pi accumulation are more prominent in the pho2 background than in the wild-type background. [[FIGURE]] Next, we obtained the pho1-5 and pho1-6 homozygotes (pho1-5/pho1-5 and pho1-6/pho1-6) to explore how pho1-5 and pho1-6 would affect Pi homeostasis in the wild-type background. Under +Pi conditions, pho1-5 and pho1-6 exhibited reduced shoot Pi concentrations and shoot-to-root ratios of total Pi distribution compared with the wild-type plants (Figures 1B and 1C). These results suggest that both pho1-5 and pho1-6 are weak PHO1 alleles with putative roles in Pi translocation from root to shoot, resulting in minor growth retardation (Figure 1A). Since both enhanced Pi acquisition and root-to-shoot translocation of Pi account for Pi overaccumulation in pho2, we wondered whether the Pi uptake activity of these pho2 suppressors was also affected. Under +Pi conditions, both pho1-5 pho2 and pho1-6 pho2 exhibited reduced Pi uptake activity compared with pho2 (Figure 4). Furthermore, we found that the Pi uptake activity of pho1-2, pho1-5, and pho1-6 mutants was reduced compared with that of the wild type (Figure 4). Similar to the magnitude of shoot Pi concentrations in these mutants, the order of the mutants regarding their respective aberrant Pi uptake activity was as follows: pho2 > pho1-6 pho2 > pho1-5 pho2 > pho1-2 pho2 in the pho2 background; wild type > pho1-6 > pho1-5 > pho1-2 in the wild-type background (Figure 4). Overall, pho1-2, pho1-5, and pho1-6 alleles impair not only Pi translocation from roots to shoots, as expected on the basis of the role of PHO1 in xylem loading, but also the process of Pi acquisition. To identify the role of PHO1 downstream of the PHO2 regulatory pathway, we were prompted to check whether PHO1 is upregulated in pho2. A specific polyclonal antibody against PHO1 was raised and able to detect a band in the wild type at ∼68 kD that was absent in the pho1-2 mutant, likely corresponding to PHO1, despite its predicted molecular mass of 90 kD (Figure 5A). The relatively fast mobility of PHO1 in SDS-PAGE, a common observation for hydrophobic membrane proteins, probably resulted from incomplete unfolding or binding of more SDS per mass unit protein. Strikingly, we found that more PHO1 protein accumulated in the +Pi root of pho2 compared with the wild type (Figure 5A), which was apparently not attributed to a change in transcript abundance (CITATION; Figure 5B). Next, we compared the protein level of PHO1 between the wild type and pho2 following Pi recovery. While Pi deficiency-induced accumulation of PHO1 gradually decreased in the wild type over the first 48 h of Pi resupply, the level of PHO1 in pho2 declined in the first 8 h and then remained unchanged until the 72-h time point (Figure 5C). These results suggest that PHO2 is required for downregulation of PHO1 in response to Pi availability. [[FIGURE]] Since PHO2 is assumed to participate in protein modification due to its putative role as a UBC enzyme, we then evaluated whether downregulation of PHO1 by PHO2 is at the posttranslational level. Under +Pi conditions, PHO1 rapidly declined in the wild type in a time course–dependent manner in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), with a half-life calculated to be 21.7 min (Figures 6A and 6B). By contrast, the degradation rate of PHO1 in pho2 was slower than in the wild type (Figures 6A and 6B), suggesting that PHO2 mediates the downregulation of PHO1 at the posttranslational level. [[FIGURE]] As one copy of the pho1-5 or pho1-6 allele is sufficient to reduce the shoot Pi accumulation of pho2 (Figure 3), we speculated that the reduced abundance of PHO1 variants in pho1-5 pho2 and pho1-6 pho2 would contribute to suppression of shoot Pi accumulation. Indeed, the level of PHO1 variants was remarkably decreased in both pho2 suppressors compared with the level of wild-type PHO1 in pho2 (Figure 7A). However, the transcript level of PHO1 was unchanged in pho1-5 pho2 but slightly decreased in pho1-6 pho2 (P < 0.05) compared with that of pho2 (Figure 7B), suggesting that the decreased protein level of PHO1A312T would have resulted, in part, from the reduced expression of transcript. To gain insight into the mechanism behind the reduced steady state level of PHO1 variants in the pho2 suppressors, we also examined the stability of PHO1E15K and PHO1A312T by application of CHX. We found that PHO1E15K is more susceptible to degradation than PHO1WT in the pho2 background, indicative of the PHO2-independent intrinsic instability of PHO1E15K (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). By contrast, the protein stability of PHO1A312T was not affected compared with that of PHO1WT in the pho2 background (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). To our surprise, the protein but not the transcript level of PHO1 variants was increased in the +Pi root of pho1-5 and pho1-6 compared with that of the wild type (Figures 7A and 7B), hinting at different factors involved in regulating the expression of PHO1E15K and PHO1A312T in the wild type and pho2. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether PHO2 is an intrinsic UBC enzyme involved in PHO1 degradation, we generated a mutant construct in which the conserved catalytic active residue Cys-748 of PHO2 was replaced with Ala. As expected, the expression of wild-type PHO2, but not of the PHO2C748A mutant variant, driven by the 35S promoter, was able to rescue the phenotype of pho2 in terms of the reduction in shoot Pi concentrations (see Supplemental Figure 6A online). Accordingly, when PHO1 and wild-type PHO2 were transiently coexpressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves, the expression of PHO1 was strikingly reduced in a PHO2 dosage-dependent manner (Figure 8A). By contrast, the level of PHO1 remained relatively constant when it was coexpressed with the PHO2C748A mutant variant (Figure 8A). The unstable nature of PHO1 when it was coexpressed with the catalytically active PHO2 suggests that PHO2 acts as a bona fide UBC enzyme sufficient for downregulation of PHO1 in planta. [[FIGURE]] To determine which part of PHO1 is subject to PHO2-dependent degradation, we further generated two truncated variants of PHO1 on the basis of the membrane topology predicted by the ConPred II algorithm (CITATION). These variants consisted of the N-terminal cytosolic region of PHO1 (PHO1-N381) and the C-terminal transmembrane domain region of PHO1 (PHO1-C399). While there was a negative correlation between the expression level of PHO1-N381 and PHO2, the expression level of PHO1-C399 remained unchanged when it was coexpressed with increasing amounts of PHO2 (Figure 8B). These results demonstrated that the N-terminal part of PHO1 is required for the recognition and/or interaction by PHO2. It has been shown that PHO1 and PHO2 are both expressed in the vascular tissue of the roots, hinting at their potential for direct interaction (CITATION; CITATION). We then examined the respective subcellular localizations of fluorescent protein–tagged PHO1 and PHO2. When transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts, PHO1-YFP (for yellow fluorescent protein) was detected in both reticular and punctate patterns (Figure 9A). The fluorescence signals were mainly colocalized with the ER and Golgi but were occasionally colocalized with the endosomal markers, suggesting that PHO1-YFP was widely distributed in the EMs (Figure 9A). Consistent with these observations, the functional PHO1-YFP under its native promoter, which rescued the pho1-2 phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 6B online), primarily displayed a dotted pattern in the root pericycle cells of the Arabidopsis transgenic lines (Figure 9B). Moreover, results from the membrane fractionation of the native PHO1 in both the wild type and pho2 reinforced that PHO1 resided predominantly in the EM rather than the PM (Figure 9C). By comparison, the functional C-terminal fluorescent protein fusion of PHO2 (see Supplemental Figure 7 online) colocalized mainly with the ER and Golgi but rarely with the endosomal markers (Figure 10A). Of note, in contrast with the punctate pattern of PHO1-YFP when expressed alone in the adjacent cell (Figure 10B, magenta arrowhead), coexpression of PHO1-YFP and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-PHO2 in tobacco leaves gave rise to ER-like signals in the EM (Figure 10B, white arrowhead), indicating that the subcellular distribution of PHO1 was altered in the presence of PHO2. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Next, we tested whether PHO2 directly interacts with PHO1 using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in tobacco leaves and split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assays. In the BiFC assay, while the empty vector controls did not produce any detectable fluorescence signal, coexpression of PHO2C748A-nYFP and PHO1-cYFP or PHO1-nYFP and cYFP-PHO2C748A gave rise to intracellular signals (Figure 11A). Results from the yeast two-hybrid system further showed the interaction between the N-terminal portion of PHO1 and full-length PHO2 (Figure 11B), supporting our previous conclusion that the N-terminal region of PHO1 is required for PHO2-mediated degradation of PHO1 (Figure 8B). Taken together, these data suggest that PHO1 and PHO2 physically interact in the EM. [[FIGURE]] Turnover of membrane proteins relies on vacuolar proteolysis- or 26S proteasome–mediated degradation pathways. While mono- or diubiquitination has been reported to serve as signals for endocytosis of PM proteins and sorting of membrane proteins to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs), polyubiquitination has been mainly associated with the targeting of substrates to the 26S proteasome (CITATION). As PHO1 is a potential substrate for PHO2-dependent ubiquitin modification, we intended to determine which protein degradation pathway is involved in the PHO2-mediated downregulation of PHO1. It has been shown that the endosomal protease inhibitor E-64d can prevent degradation of the Arabidopsis root PM proteins by attenuating the final step of the endocytic pathway (i.e., the fusion of the late endosomes/MVB with vacuoles) (CITATION). Interestingly, the E-64d (50 µM) treatment of the wild type alleviated the downregulation of PHO1 upon Pi resupply and resulted in an increase in the expression of PHO1 after 24 h of Pi recovery, whereas the expression level of PHO1 in the roots of E-64d–treated pho2 was only slightly affected (Figures 12A and 12B). In accordance with these results, accumulation of PHO1 under +Pi conditions was increased in the 24-h E-64d–treated wild type in a dosage-dependent manner but not in pho2 (see Supplemental Figure 8A online). By contrast, the expression of PHO1 in wild-type seedlings treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 µM) was gradually decreased in a Pi recovery time-dependent manner, as the DMSO controls (see Supplemental Figure 8B online), suggesting that downregulation of PHO1 was not blocked by inhibition of 26S proteasome activity. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that PHO2 is required for MVB-mediated vacuolar degradation of PHO1 when Pi is adequate. [[FIGURE]] As the genomic PHO1 construct we used for complementation of pho1-5 pho2 and pho1-6 pho2 unexpectedly resulted in tissue-specific overexpression of PHO1 (see Supplemental Figure 3 online), we attempted to bring this construct into the wild type and pho2 background. Interestingly, although the abundance of PHO1 was elevated to the same extent in the PHO1-overexpressing lines as in pho2 (Figure 13A), the shoot Pi concentrations were increased by 40 to 55% at most compared with the wild-type control and did not reach the levels seen in pho2 (Figure 13B). By comparison, overexpression of PHO1 in the pho2 background aggravated Pi toxicity (Figures 13A and 13B), often resulting in the failure of seed development under +Pi conditions. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Seeds of the Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia-0), pho1-2 (CITATION), and pho2 (CITATION) mutants used in this study were obtained from the ABRC. The s1 and s80 mutants were backcrossed to pho2 one time to clean genetic backgrounds after mutagenesis. Seeds were surface sterilized and germinated on agar plates with one-half modified Hoagland nutrient solution containing 250 μM KH2PO4, 1% Suc, and 1% Bactoagar (CITATION). The Pi-sufficient (+Pi) and Pi-deficient (−Pi) media were supplemented with 250 μM and 10 µM KH2PO4, respectively, unless specified otherwise. For hydroponic growth, the medium was prepared without supplement of Suc. All the insert fragments of interest were amplified and cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) for sequencing and then recombined into the desired Gateway destination vectors via LR Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic active residue of PHO2 was performed according to the instructions of the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo). All primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. For unknown reasons, cloning of the full-length cDNA of PHO1 in Escherichia coli was unsuccessful. Therefore, all the constructs for expression of the full-length PHO1 protein were obtained by cloning the genomic sequences. For Arabidopsis complementation and overexpression experiments, a 10-kb genomic fragment of DNA containing the coding region of PHO1 was cloned and recombined into the Gateway destination vector pMDC100 (CITATION), designated as PHO1pro:PHO1. For Arabidopsis PHO1pro:gPHO1insYFP transgenic lines, an 8-kb genomic fragment encoding the PHO1 coding region, spanning from 2.1 kb upstream of the start codon to 0.5 kb downstream of the stop codon, was cloned. The C-terminal YFP fusion of PHO1 was constructed with YFP inserted at nine amino acids from the C terminus of PHO1. pKGW was used as the Gateway destination vector (CITATION). For transient expression of PHO1-YFP (35S:gPHO1insYFP) in Arabidopsis protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana tobacco leaves, the genomic PHO1 sequence with the C-terminal YFP fusion was amplified using PHO1pro:gPHO1insYFP as template and introduced into pMDC32 Gateway destination vector (CITATION). For transient expression of PHO2-CFP (35S:PHO2-CFP) in Arabidopsis protoplasts, the expression constructs were generated using p2CWG7 as the Gateway destination vectors (CITATION). For the PHO1 degradation assay in tobacco leaves, the PHO1 genomic construct containing the coding region of PHO1 (35S:gPHO1), the N- and C-terminal truncated PHO1 hemagglutinin-tagged constructs expressing the partial coding sequences of PHO1-N381 (35S:PHO1N318-HA) and PHO1-C399 (35S:PHO1C399-HA), and the full-length PHO2 coding sequence constructs expressing the wild-type PHO2 (35S:PHO2) and the mutant variant PHO2C748A (35S:PHO2C748A), were generated using pMDC32 as the Gateway destination vector (CITATION). For colocalization of PHO1-YFP (35S:gPHO1insYFP) and CFP-PHO2 in tobacco leaves, the CFP-PHO2 constructs (35S:CFP-PHO2) were generated using pK7WGC2 as the Gateway destination vector (CITATION). For BiFC analysis, the full-length PHO2 coding sequence encoding the mutant variant PHO2C748A was recombined into pUBN-cYFP (UBQ10:cYFP-PHO2C748A) or pUBC-nYFP (UBQ10:PHO2C748A-nYFP). The genomic PHO1 sequence was recombined into pUBC-nYFP (UBQ10:gPHO1-nYFP) or pUBC-cYFP (UBQ10:gPHO1-cYFP) (CITATION). Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assay was performed according to the instructions provided with the DUALmembrane kit (Dualsystems Biotech). The N-terminal 1416-bp fragment of the PHO1 coding sequence corresponding to the first N-terminal 472 amino acids encompassing one putative transmembrane domain was cloned into the XbaI and StuI sites of the bait vector pAMBV4. The full-length PHO2 coding sequence was cloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of the prey vector pDL-Nx. Yeast strain DSY-1 cells were cotransformed with the resulting constructs and plated onto synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His. The specificity of protein–protein interactions was confirmed by chloroform overlay β-galactosidase plate assay as described by CITATION. Transformation of Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts for transient expression of fluorescence fusion proteins was performed as described previously (CITATION). For subcellular colocalization experiments, the fluorescent markers N-ST-RFP (for red fluorescent protein) and RFP-ARA6 used have been previously reported (CITATION). ARA7-RFP and VTI12-TFP (for teal fluorescent protein) constructs were derived from WAVE lines (CITATION) obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. AtWAK2-mCherry and GmMAN1-mCherry constructs were derived from the multicolored organelle marker set (CITATION) obtained from the ABRC. The Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in tobacco leaves was conducted as described at http://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/research/baulcombe/induction.html, with minor modifications. A preculture of the Agrobacterium EHA105 strain harboring the constructs of genes of interest or p19 (CITATION) was prepared in Luria-Bertani medium with the proper antibiotics and incubated overnight with shaking at 28°C. A 1-mL aliquot of preculture was used to inoculate 50 mL of Luria-Bertani medium with the appropriate antibiotics, 10 mM MES, and 20 µM acetosyringone, and the bacteria were allowed to grow overnight. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, the cell pellet was resuspended in the infiltration medium (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, and 100 µM acetosyringone) to an OD600 of 1.0. The cell suspension was then left standing at room temperature for 2 to 3 h before infiltration of N. benthamiana tobacco leaves. A mix of cells containing the genes of interest and p19 was then prepared to infiltrate the second or third true leaves of 3-week-old tobacco plants. Infiltrated tobacco plants were grown for another 3 d before sample collection. Pi concentration and uptake activity were determined as described (CITATION). To assay Pi uptake, the seedlings grown under +Pi conditions (i.e., 250 μM KH2PO4) were transferred to medium containing 250 μM [33P] KH2PO4 for the measurement of Pi uptake. Total RNA from samples was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by treatment with DNase I (Ambion) before quantitative RT-PCR to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 to 1 μg total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primer. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems) on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative expression levels were normalized to that of an internal control, UBQ10. For extraction of total root protein, the roots of wild-type and mutant seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and dissolved in protein lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5% glycerol, 0.13 mM EDTA, and 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche). Total root protein (50 to 80 µg) of each sample was loaded onto 4 to 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (NuPAGE System) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in 1× PBS solution with 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST), pH 7.2) at room temperature for more than 30 min and hybridized with primary antibody in 1× PBST for 1 to 2 h. The membrane was washed three times with 1× PBST for 5 min followed by hybridization with the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody in 1× PBST for 1 h. After three washes in 1× PBST for 5 min and a rinse with distilled water, chemiluminescent substrates for signal detection were applied. Polyclonal rabbit PHO1 antibody was raised against an N-terminal fragment of PHO1 corresponding to the amino acid residues 28 to 46 (KQIKKIKTSRKPKPASHYP) and affinity purified. Polyclonal rabbit antibody against PIP1;1/2/3 was purchased from Agrisera. The protein transferred onto membranes was visualized with naphthol blue black staining solution (0.1% naphthol blue black, 10% methanol, and 2% acetic acid). Confocal microscopy images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO DuoScan with objectives LCI Plan-Neofluar ×63/1.3 Imm and Plan-Apochromat ×100/1.4 oil. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 458 nm/465 to 510 nm for CFP and TFP, 514 nm/520 to 550 nm for YFP, 514 nm/630 to 700 nm for propidium iodide, and 561 nm/575 to 630 nm for RFP and mCherry. The cell wall was stained with propidium iodide (1 µg/mL). CHX (200 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), MG132 (50 mM; Calbiochem), and E-64d (50 mM; Cayman) stock solutions were prepared in DMSO. The final working concentration used in liquid +Pi medium was specified according to the experiment. For control experiments, a 0.1% DMSO solution was used.
