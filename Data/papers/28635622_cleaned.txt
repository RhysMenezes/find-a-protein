!~ABS~! Genes essential for gametophyte development and fertilization have been identified and studied in detail; however, genes that fine-tune these processes are largely unknown. Here, we characterized an unknown Arabidopsis gene, GTP-BINDING PROTEIN RELATED1 (GPR1). GPR1 is specifically expressed in ovule, pollen, and pollen tube. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged GPR1 localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm, and it also presents in punctate and ring-like structures. gpr1 mutants exhibit no defect in gametogenesis and seed setting, except that their pollen grains are pale in color. Scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed a normal patterned but thinner exine on gpr1 pollen surface. This may explain why gpr1 pollen grains are pale. We next examined whether GPR1 mutation affects post gametogenesis processes including pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and ovule senescence. We found that gpr1 pollen grains germinated earlier, and their pollen tubes elongated faster. Emasculation assay revealed that unfertilized gpr1 pistil expressed the senescence marker PBFN1:GUS (GUS: a reporter gene that encodes β-glucuronidase) one-day earlier than the wild type pistil. Consistently, ovules and pollen grains of gpr1 mutants showed lower viability than those of the wild type at 4 to 5 days post anthesis. Together, these data suggest that GPR1 functions as a negative regulator of pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and gametophyte senescence to fine-tune the fertilization process.
!~RES~! GPR1 shares high similarity to the tobacco sperm-cell-expressed transcript NtS2. Therefore, we investigated whether GPR1 gene is also specifically expressed in pollen grains. RT-PCR analysis revealed that GPR1 transcript was strongly accumulated in flower buds, flowers, and young siliques, but was barely detectable in seedlings, rosette and cauline leaves, and stems ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). Our results are very similar to the publicly available expression profile of the GPR1 gene based on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). To investigate the expression of GPR1 in detail, we generated ProGPR1:GUS transgenic lines expressing GUS reporter gene under control of the GPR1 promoter. Consistent with the above results, GUS staining was only detected in flowers at developmental stages 9 to 13 and one day post anthesis, and the GUS signal was restricted to anthers and ovules ([ijms-18-01303-f001]A,B; [app1-ijms-18-01303]). In anthers, GUS signal was specifically detected in tapetum and developing pollen ([ijms-18-01303-f001]C,D). In vitro and in vivo pollen germination analysis showed that ProGPR1:GUS was also expressed in pollen tubes at high levels ([ijms-18-01303-f001]E,F). In ovules, ProGPR1:GUS was expressed specifically in the embryo sac through stage FG3 to the mature stage of FG7, and its expression was still detectable one day post anthesis ([ijms-18-01303-f002]). To explore the subcellular localization of GPR1 protein, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing either a C-terminal fusion of GPR1 and ENHANCED GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (EGFP) under control of the GPR1 promoter (ProGPR1:GPR1-EGFP), or a N-terminal fusion of GPR1 and EGFP under control of the 35S promoter (Pro35S:EGFP-GPR1). Consistent with the ProGPR1: GUS expression patterns, ProGPR1:GPR1-EGFP was only expressed in tapetum, developing pollen and ovule ([app1-ijms-18-01303]; [ijms-18-01303-f003] and [ijms-18-01303-f004]). During pollen development, GPR1-EGFP signal was undetectable in pollen mother cell ([ijms-18-01303-f003]A), then was detected in nucleus and cytoplasm of tetrad, microspore, polarized microspore, and bicellular pollen ([ijms-18-01303-f003]B–E; [app1-ijms-18-01303]). Furthermore, in bicellular pollen, GPR1-EGFP signal was strong in the vegetative cell nucleus but was undetectable in the germ cell nuclei ([ijms-18-01303-f003]E; [app1-ijms-18-01303]). In mature pollen, the GPR1-EGFP signal was decreased to below detectable level ([ijms-18-01303-f003]F). In in vitro germinated pollen tubes, GPR1-EGFP signal was also undetectable (Data not shown). ProGPR1: GUS showed strong expression in mature pollen and pollen tube. Therefore, to determine the localization of GPR1-EGFP in mature pollen and pollen tube, we generated transgenic lines expressing ProLAT52:GPR1-EGFP (ProLAT52 is a strong pollen-specific promoter). In mature pollen, ProLAT52:GPR1-EGFP signal was detected in nucleus and cytoplasm of the vegetative cell, but was undetectable in the germ cell nuclei ([ijms-18-01303-f003]G–I). This is consistent with the expression pattern of ProGPR1:GPR1-EGFP in bicellular pollen ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). In pollen tube, GPR1-EGFP was also only detected in the vegetative nucleus and cytoplasm ([ijms-18-01303-f003]J–L). Furthermore, the GPR1-EGFP localized to some punctate and ring-like structures in the cytosol of the vegetative cell ([ijms-18-01303-f003]G,J). During ovule development, GPR1-EGFP signal was undetectable at developmental stage 2-III ([ijms-18-01303-f004]A), then was first detected in megaspore mother cell at stage 3-I ([ijms-18-01303-f004]B), and maintains in functional megaspore, coenocytic female gametophyte and mature embryo sac, and also resided in nucleus and cytoplasm ([ijms-18-01303-f004]C–G). GPR1-EGFP labeled punctate structures was also observed in cytoplasm of female gametophyte ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). We also examined the EGFP-GPR1 signals in root tips of the Pro35S: EGFP-GPR1 transgenic plants. We found that EGFP-GPR1 also localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm of root cells, and also resided in punctate and ring-like structures ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). The identity of these structures remains to be elucidated. GPR1 was reported to be the orthologous of the tobacco sperm-cell-expressed protein NtS2 [[B21-ijms-18-01303]]. However, unlike NtS2, GPR1 was not detectable in sperm cell nuclei ([ijms-18-01303-f003]E,G–L; [app1-ijms-18-01303]). Therefore, we did amino acid sequence alignment of NtS2 and GPR1. To our surprise, these two proteins only share 20% sequence similarity ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). We then searched the Arabidopsis database using NtS2 amino acid sequence, and found that it shares 64% similarity with the putative protein At3g23870 ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). To understand the function of Arabidopsis GPR1, we obtained T-DNA insertion mutant gpr1-1 (SALKseq_034266) and Ds transposon insertion mutant gpr1-2 (CSHL_GT24095) ([ijms-18-01303-f005]A). RT-PCR analyses revealed that no GPR1 transcripts were detectable in the inflorescence of homozygous gpr1-1 and gpr1-2 mutants ([ijms-18-01303-f005]B). There was no observable difference in vegetative growth between gpr1 mutants and wild-type plants ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). Although GPR1 was strongly expressed during pollen and ovule development ([ijms-18-01303-f001], [ijms-18-01303-f002], [ijms-18-01303-f003] and [ijms-18-01303-f004]), gpr1 mutant showed no defect in pollen viability, pollen development, or seed set under standard growth conditions ([app1-ijms-18-01303]), except for its pollen grains exhibiting a pale yellow color compared with wild type ([ijms-18-01303-f006]). To elucidate why gpr1 pollen grains exhibited pale color, we examined pollen surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). gpr1 pollen grains displayed a normal patterned but thinner exine surface with thinner muri and larger lacunae compared with wild type ([ijms-18-01303-f007]; [app1-ijms-18-01303]). These results indicate that the gametophyte-specific GPR1 is not required for pollen viability and seed set, but may play roles in post gametogenesis process such as pollen coat formation. To determine whether GPR1 mutation affects post gametogenesis process, we examined pollen germination in in vitro and in vivo environments. When cultured on pollen germination medium for 8 hours, gpr1 pollen germinated as efficiently as wild-type pollen ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). However, gpr1 pollen tubes were significantly longer than that of wild-type ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). To analyze the growth of pollen tubes in vivo, we pollinated wild-type pistils with pollen grains from the gpr1 mutants or wild-type plant. At 6 h after pollination (HAP), wild-type (Col and Ler) pollen tubes had just reached the top of the transmitting tract ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). By contrast, gpr1 pollen tubes had penetrated into the upper part of the transmitting tract ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). At 8 HAP, majority of wild-type pollen tubes were still in the upper part of the transmitting tract, only a few pollen tubes turned toward ovules ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). By contrast, gpr1 pollen tubes reached more than half of the transmitting tract and most pollen tubes grew to entering the ovules ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). Longer pollen tubes suggesting hyperactive germination or faster growth velocity. To determine the growth dynamics of gpr1 pollen tubes, we germinated pollen grains of wild type and gpr1 plants in vitro for a series of time from 0 to 2 h. Pollen grains of the gpr1 mutants exhibited hyperactive germination ([ijms-18-01303-f008]A,B). For example, at 0 h, approximately 3% of gpr1-1 and 1% of gpr1-2 pollen grains already exhibited pollen tube protrusion, which was undetectable in wild-type pollen grains (n = 1233, 1239, 1286, and 1946 for Col, gpr1-1, Ler, and gpr1-2, respectively; [ijms-18-01303-f008]B). At 0.5 h, approximately 8% of gpr1-1 and 20% of gpr1-2 pollen grains had germinated (n = 1036 for gpr1-1, and 2004 for gpr1-2; [ijms-18-01303-f008]B). By contrast, only approximately 2% of Col pollen grains and 1% of Ler pollen grains germinated (n = 519 for Col, and 2108 for Ler; [ijms-18-01303-f008]B). Although precocious pollen germination was not observed inside the dehiscing gpr1 anthers in the morning (Data not shown), in the afternoon, long pollen tubes can be observed inside dehiscing gpr1 anthers ([ijms-18-01303-f008]D). This phenomenon was not observed in the wild-type anther ([ijms-18-01303-f008]C). We further recorded the in vitro pollen tube elongation by intervals of 5 min, and quantified its growth rate. The results showed that pollen tubes of the gpr1 mutants elongated faster than those of the wild type ([ijms-18-01303-f009]). Taken together, these results indicate that GPR1 functions as a negative regulator of pollen germination and pollen tube growth. When observing the expressions of ProGPR1:GUS and ProGPR1:GPR1-EGFP, we noticed strong GUS and GPR1-EGFP signals in aborted ovules ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). We then examined the expression of ProGPR1:GUS in unfertilized pistils after emasculation. GUS activity was detected specifically in the embryo sac at 0 day post emasculation (DPE); then GUS signal was observed in the whole ovule at 1 to 3 DPE; at 4 DPE, GUS signal was absent in ovules located in the base of the pistil; at 5 DPE some apical ovules also lost the GUS signal ([app1-ijms-18-01303]). This expression pattern of ProGPR1:GUS in unfertilized pistil is opposite to that of senescence markers like SAG12:GUS and PBFN1:GUS [[B19-ijms-18-01303],[B20-ijms-18-01303],[B22-ijms-18-01303]]. To determine whether GPR1 mutation affect ovule senescence, we crossed PBFN1:GUS (in Col background) into both of the gpr1 mutants and the Ler wild-type plant (to eliminate background influence). Then we examined PBFN1:GUS expression in unfertilized pistils of wild-type and gpr1 mutants. In unfertilized Ler wild-type pistils, PBFN1:GUS expression was first observed in the transmitting tract of the 2 DPE pistils; then it was detected in the ovules located in the base of the pistil at 3 DPE; finally, GUS staining was detected in all ovules of pistil at 4 DPE ([ijms-18-01303-f010]A). Whereas pistil of the gpr1-2 mutant exhibited GUS staining one-day earlier than pistil of the Ler wild type ([ijms-18-01303-f010]B). Similar trend was observed for gpr1-1 mutant (Data not shown). The above findings suggest that GPR1 may have a role in ovule senescence. To test this, we compared the seed set ability between gpr1 and wild type after emasculation for 1 to 5 days. When pollinated at 1 to 3 DPE, wild type and gpr1 pistils produced comparable number of seeds ([ijms-18-01303-f011]A,B). However, gpr1 pistils produced significantly less seeds than wild-type pistils when pollinated at 4 to 5 DPE ([ijms-18-01303-f011]A,B). These results indicate that gpr1 ovule has a shorter lifespan than that of wild-type plant. To examine whether GPR1 mutation also affect pollen longevity, we compared the fertilization efficiency of gpr1 pollen grain with that of wild type after storage at 4 °C for a series of time of 1 to 5 days. The results showed that pollinations using gpr1 pollen grains produced less seeds than the ones using wild-type pollen grains ([ijms-18-01303-f011]C,D). After stored for 4 to 5 days, the difference between wild-type and gpr1 pollen grains were significant ([ijms-18-01303-f011]C,D). These results suggest that gpr1 pollen grains are less viable than that of the wild type after long time storage.
!~MM~! T-DNA insertion mutant SALKseq_034266 (gpr1-1) is in Col-0 background; and transposon insertion mutant CSHL_GT24095 (gpr1-2) is in Ler background. These mutants were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) (Leicestershire, England, UK) and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) (Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA) genetrap collection, respectively. T-DNA or transposon insertion was confirmed by PCR-based genotyping. Primers used are listed in [app1-ijms-18-01303]. Plants were cultured under controlled environments at 22 ± 1 °C, 70% relative humidity with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. To create the ProGPR1:GUS construct, 2567 bp sequence upstream of the GPR1 gene start codon were PCR-amplified. The resulting fragment was inserted upstream of the GUS reporter gene in the pGreenII0229-GUS vector via XhoI and SpeI sites [[B39-ijms-18-01303]]. Then, 419 bp of sequence downstream the GPR1 stop codon (3′ regulating sequence of the GPR1 gene) was amplified and cloned into the vector downstream of the GUS gene. To generate the ProGPR1:GPR1-EGFP translational fusion construct, the GPR1 promoter and full-length coding sequence (nucleotides −2567 to 690 from ATG) was amplified and inserted into the pGreenII0229-EGFP plasmid in frame with the EGFP gene [[B40-ijms-18-01303]]. Then, the 3′ regulating sequence of the GPR1 gene (419 bp) was cloned into the above constructed vector at downstream of the EGFP gene. To generate the ProLAT52:GPR1-EGFP construct, the 666 bp promoter fragment of the LAT52 gene was amplified from Solanum lycopersicum and cloned into the pGreenII0229-GPR1-EGFP vector upstream of the GPR1 coding sequence. To construct the p35S:EGFP-GPR1 plasmid, the EGFP fragment was cut from the pGreenII0229-EGFP plasmid using XhoI and SacI enzymes, then inserted into the pBA002 vector (with CaMV 35S promoter; from Nam-Hai Chua) using the same sites; then GPR1 full-length cDNA was cloned into the pBA002-EGFP vector at downstream of the EGFP gene and in frame with EGFP. All constructed vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 (pMP90/pJIC Sa-Rep) and transformed into wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants by floral dip method [[B41-ijms-18-01303]]. Seeds harvested from the transformed plants were sowed in soil and screened by spraying 10 mg L−1 Basta (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Basta resistant plants were verified by PCR. Homozygous lines (T3 generation) were obtained from several independent transformants to perform analyses. All primers used are listed in [app1-ijms-18-01303]. RT-PCR was performed to test the transcription levels of the GPR1 gene in mutant or wild-type plants. Total RNA was extracted from inflorescences of 5-week-old plants using Trizol reagent. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using EasyScript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The APT1 gene was used as an internal control for equal loading. The primer sequences are listed in [app1-ijms-18-01303]. For GUS staining, various tissues of ProGPR1:GUS transgenic plants were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in GUS staining buffer as previously described [[B40-ijms-18-01303]]. After staining, the tissue was cleared in chloral hydrate:distilled water:glycerol (8:3:1, w:v:v). Inflorescences were examined using a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope. Developing ovules were dissected and observed under an Olympus BX63 microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) optics. Ovule developmental stages were determined as described previously [[B42-ijms-18-01303]]. For scanning electron microscopy, flowers from wild-type, gpr1-1 and gpr1-2 plants were dissected; pollen grains were subjected to freeze drying, then mounted for coating with gold and observed on a QUANTA 200 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) scanning electron microscope. For observation expression pattern of GPR1-EGFP in ovules and anthers, flowers were dissected at different developmental stages and mounted in an 8% glycerol solution. Fluorescent signals were detected by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Leica TCS SP5, Wetzlar, Germany). To assay pollen viability, Alexander staining was carried out as described [[B43-ijms-18-01303]], and then cleared in Herr’s solution [[B44-ijms-18-01303]] for 2 h. For DAPI and callose staining, flowers were fixed in ethanol:acetic acid (3:1) solution for 2 h, and treated with 2 N NaOH for 10 min. After washing with 50 mmol·L−1 K2HPO4-KOH buffer (pH 7.5) for three times, pollen grains were immersed with 1 g·L−1 DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) for staining DNA. The stained nuclei were detected using a Leica DM2500 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a UV filter. To visualize the in vivo geminated pollen tubes, aniline blue staining was performed as described previously [[B45-ijms-18-01303]]. Emasculated wild-type flowers were pollinated either with wild type or gpr1 pollen grains. Six or eight hour after pollination, the pistils were fixed in acetic acid:chloroform:ethanol (1:3:6) for 2 h. Then, the pistils were washed in distilled H2O, and softened overnight in 8 N NaOH. After the softening step, the pistils were washed three times with distilled H2O, and then stained with aniline blue solution (0.05% aniline blue in 0.1 mol·L−1 potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) for 3 h by avoiding light. After staining, pistils were washed with 0.1 mol·L−1 potassium phosphate buffer, and mounted on a microscope slide, and gently squashed under a cover slip. The pistils were observed using a Leica DM2500 microscope with a UV filter. In vitro pollen germination was performed according to previously published methods [[B46-ijms-18-01303]]. Briefly, pollen grains collected from newly opened flowers were placed on pollen germination medium [1 mmol·L−1 CaCl2, 1 mmol·L−1 Ca(NO3)2, 1 mmol·L−1 MgSO4, 0.01% (w/v) H3BO3, and 18% (w/v) sucrose, solidified with 0.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.0]. The plates were cultured at 28 °C under moist conditions. After 8 h incubation, digital images were collected with a Leica DFC420 CCD camera equipped on a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Pollen germination percentage and the length of the pollen tubes were measured using ImageJ software. Protrusion from the aperture was regarded as positive germination [[B47-ijms-18-01303]]. To test the longevity of ovules, flowers one day before anthesis from gpr1 mutant and wild type were emasculated, then the pistils were hand pollinated with freshly harvested wild-type pollen grains at 1 to 5 days post emasculation. Ten days after pollination, siliques were harvested and seeds were counted. For pollen lifespan analysis, mature pollen grains were harvested from opening flowers of gpr1 mutants and wild type, and were stored at 4 °C for 1 to 5 days before pollinated to pistils of freshly emasculated wild type flowers. Ten days after pollination, siliques were harvested and seeds were counted.
