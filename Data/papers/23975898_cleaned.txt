!~ABS~! Fertilization in flowering plants requires the temporal and spatial coordination of many developmental processes, including pollen production, anther dehiscence, ovule production, and pollen tube elongation. However, it remains elusive as to how this coordination occurs during reproduction. Here, we present evidence that endocytosis, involving heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), plays a crucial role in fertilization. An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant ap2m displays multiple defects in pollen production and viability, as well as elongation of staminal filaments and pollen tubes, all of which are pivotal processes needed for fertilization. Of these abnormalities, the defects in elongation of staminal filaments and pollen tubes were partially rescued by exogenous auxin. Moreover, DR5rev:GFP (for green fluorescent protein) expression was greatly reduced in filaments and anthers in ap2m mutant plants. At the cellular level, ap2m mutants displayed defects in both endocytosis of N-(3-triethylammonium-propyl)-4-(4-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide, a lypophilic dye used as an endocytosis marker, and polar localization of auxin-efflux carrier PIN FORMED2 (PIN2) in the stamen filaments. Moreover, these defects were phenocopied by treatment with Tyrphostin A23, an inhibitor of endocytosis. Based on these results, we propose that AP-2–dependent endocytosis plays a crucial role in coordinating the multiple developmental aspects of male reproductive organs by modulating cellular auxin level through the regulation of the amount and polarity of PINs.
!~RES~! To gain insight into the physiological role of AP-2–mediated endocytosis in plants, we initially identified the components of AP-2 and their localization. In animals, the endocytic adaptor AP-2 complex is formed by assembly of four distinct types of subunits, α-adaptin, β-adaptin, μ-adaptin, and σ-adaptin (CITATION). The Arabidopsis genome contains two genes, named AP2A1 and AP2A2, which show high sequence homology and structural similarity to animal α-adaptins (CITATION). To test whether these two proteins are α-adaptin of AP-2 in plants, we tagged AP2A1 with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at the C terminus and examined its localization. Previously, the C-terminally YFP-tagged α-adaptin, α-adaptin:YFP, localized to the PM and cytosol in animals (CITATION). We generated the transgenic plants expressing AP2A1:YFP from the native promoter or cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and confirmed that AP2A1:YFP was detected with both anti–green fluorescent protein (GFP) and anti-AP2A antibodies at 143 kD, at the expected size (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Moreover, the immunocomplex obtained with anti-GFP antibody was recognized by anti-AP2A antibody (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Next, we examined the localization of AP2A1:YFP expressed from the native promoter in root tissues. Similar to the localization pattern of AP-2 in animals, AP2A1:YFP was localized to the PM in addition to the cytosol (Figure 1A). These results indicate that AP2A1 is the α-adaptin subunit of AP-2 in Arabidopsis. Moreover, the PM-localized AP2A1:YFP signals disappeared when root tissues were treated with Tyrphostin A23, an endocytosis inhibitor that prevents interaction between the YXXΦ motif of a cargo protein and μ-adaptin (CITATION) but not with Tyrphostin A51 used as a control (Figure 1A). In addition, the PM localization of AP2A1:YFP was also affected by Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase known to inhibit endocytosis (CITATION). These results indicate that the interaction of AP-2 with its cargo is critical for localization of AP-2 to the PM. [[FIGURE]] Next, we identified μ-adaptin of AP-2. The Arabidopsis genome contains five μ-adaptin homologs. Recently, it has been shown that muB1 (AP1M1) and muB2 (AP1M2) are μ-adaptin subunits of AP-1 and μD is the μ-adaptin subunit of AP-3 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Sequence homology analysis revealed that AP2M (aka muA) displayed the highest sequence homology to the animal μ2 of AP-2 (see Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B online), raising the possibility that AP2M is the μ-adaptin subunit of AP-2 in Arabidopsis. To test this idea, we generated transgenic plants expressing AP2M:Mycx3 or AP1M2:HAx3, and protein extracts from these plants were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies. The precipitates were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti-AP2A (α-adaptin) or anti-AP1G (γ-adaptin) antibodies. AP2A but not AP1G was coprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, whereas AP1G but not AP2A was coprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (Figure 1B), indicating that AP2M is μ-adaptin of plant AP-2. To examine the subcellular distribution of AP2M, protein extracts from transgenic plants expressing AP2M:Mycx3 were separated into soluble and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation, and these fractions were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti-Myc antibody. AP2M was detected in both fractions, with 40% in the soluble fraction and 60% in the membrane fraction (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that AP2M exists as soluble and membrane-associated forms. AP-2 is the adaptor of clathrin for clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To test this in plants, we examined the interaction of AP-2 with clathrin by coimmunoprecipitation. Protein extracts from transgenic plants expressing AP2M:Mycx3 were used for coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody, and the precipitates were probed with anti–clathrin heavy chain (CHC) antibody. CHC was detected in the precipitates of anti-Myc antibody (Figure 2A), indicating that AP-2 interacts with clathrin. Next, we examined the place where this interaction occurs by in vivo imaging using AP2A1:YFP and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)–tagged clathrin light chain (CLC:CFP) after Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration-mediated transient expression of AP2A1:YFP in CLC:CFP transgenic plants. Indeed, both proteins localized to the PM in leaf and root hair cells (Figure 2B). To quantify their colocalization, we used the linear Pearson moment-product correlation coefficient (rp) and the nonlinear Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs) (CITATION). AP2A1:YFP closely colocalized with CLC:YFP in both cells (Figure 2B; rp/rs = 0.73/0.70 for leaf cells and rp/rs = 0.85/0.83 for root hair cells). Taken together, these data suggest that AP-2 is involved in CCV formation at the PM. [[FIGURE]] The physiological role of AP-2 in plants was examined genetically using knockout mutants or RNA interference (RNAi) plants of AP-2 components. First, we identified two independent mutant alleles, ap2m-1 and ap2m-2, which had a T-DNA insertion in exons 4 and 7 of AP2M, respectively (see Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B online). The absence of AP2M transcripts was confirmed by RT-PCR (see Supplemental Figure 3C online). Next, we examined the morphology of plants bearing the two alleles, ap2m-1 and ap2m-2. Both of them had more branches and produced small siliques (Figures 3A and 3B). When quantified, these small siliques in ap2m plants contained only 100 to 200 seeds compared with 3100 seeds per primary inflorescence in the wild type (Figure 3C). These results suggest that AP2M has a crucial role in fertilization. [[FIGURE]] In addition to this, ap2m-1 mutants showed many developmental defects, including abnormal phyllotaxis, an increase in the number of shoots and branches, smaller leaves, an increase in the leaf number, and shorter root hairs (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). To confirm that these phenotypes were caused by the mutation in AP2M, we examined whether AP2M:Mycx3 complements these phenotypes of the ap2m-1 plants. Expression of AP2M:Mycx3 under the native promoter in the background of ap2m-1 rescued all of these phenotypes, confirming that these developmental defects are caused by the mutation in AP2M (Figure 3). The genotype and expression of AP2M:Mycx3 in the complemented plants were confirmed by PCR (see Supplemental Figure 3D online). Since AP-2 is a heterotetrameric complex, we tested whether mutation in AP2A encoding α-adaptin, the largest subunit of AP-2, exhibits the same phenotype. We employed the RNAi approach to knockdown expression of AP2A using an AP2A1 RNAi construct that targeted both AP2A genes, AP2A1 and AP2A2, because AP2A1 and AP2A2 are tandemly repeated next to each other on the same chromosome, which makes it very difficult to obtain a double knockout mutant of AP2A1 and AP2A2 (see Supplemental Figure 5A online). The AP2A levels in AP2A1 RNAi plants were examined by protein gel blot analysis using anti-AP2A antibody. Multiple AP2A1 RNAi transgenic lines showed significantly reduced AP2A protein levels (see Supplemental Figure 5B online). As a negative control, we examined the AP1G level using anti-AP1G antibody and found that the AP1G levels in the RNAi plants were the same as those in the wild-type plants, confirming the specificity of the AP2A1 RNAi construct. These AP2A1 RNAi plants exhibited the same phenotype as ap2m mutants, namely, small siliques with only few seeds and abnormal phyllotaxis (see Supplemental Figure 5C online). These results confirm that AP-2 plays an essential role in fertilization. Of multiple abnormalities in ap2m mutants, we focused on defects in fertilization. Fertilization involves many complex developmental processes, such as pollen biogenesis in anthers, the proper elongation of staminal filaments, pollen tube elongation, and the fertilization of the egg cells by sperm cells (CITATION; CITATION). To gain insights into the role(s) of AP2M in fertilization, we examined which of these processes is affected in ap2m plants. The amount of pollen produced in the anthers appeared to be greatly reduced in ap2m plants. To look for defects in pollen quality, the viability of pollen grains was tested using propidium iodide and fluorescein diacetate (FDA), which stain dead and live pollen, respectively (CITATION) (Figure 4A). Dead pollen grains amounted to 42% in ap2m-1 plants, compared with only 15% in the wild type (Figure 4B). Consistent with this finding, pollination of wild-type plants with ap2m-1 pollen produced only a few seeds, as observed in ap2m-1 plants (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Interestingly, the plant growth conditions affected the degree of defects in pollen viability; the defect was much more severe in plants grown in a rooftop greenhouse than in those grown in an indoor greenhouse (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). Previous studies have shown that growth conditions such as relative humidity affect pollen viability (CITATION). In plants, pollen biogenesis occurs through a lengthy pollen developmental process in the anther and can be divided into 13 different stages (CITATION). To define the exact step at which AP2M is involved during pollen biogenesis, ultrathin sections of anthers prepared at various developmental stages were examined by electron microscopy. Until stage 10, the ap2m-1 mutant plants did not display any noticeable difference to the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 8 online). However, the most prominent difference was detected at stage 13 when the central vacuole (CV) undergoes degeneration (CITATION; CITATION). In wild-type pollen grains, the CV was fragmented into numerous small vacuoles <0.3 μm in diameter and uniformly distributed in the entire cellular space. In ap2m-1 pollen grains, the CV was also fragmented into small vacuoles. However, some of them were still as large as 1 μm in diameter, and often the smaller vacuoles were attached to each other (Figure 4C), indicating that AP2M plays a role in pollen biogenesis via degeneration of the CV. Thus, it is possible that incomplete degeneration of the CV may lead to dead pollen. However, this defect in pollen biogenesis may not account fully for the severe reduction in seed production, since 58% of ap2m-1 pollen was still alive according to FDA staining. To identify additional defects, we examined pollen tube growth in vitro. Indeed, ap2m-1 pollen exhibited a severe defect in tube growth ex planta: The average length of a pollen tube was 200 μm with ap2m-1 pollen, compared with 500 μm with wild-type pollen, indicating that AP2M also plays a crucial role in pollen tube elongation (Figures 4D and 4E). [[FIGURE]] Another noticeable abnormality was the shorter length of the staminal filaments; in ap2m-1 plants, the length of stamen filaments was shorter than those of wild-type plants so that pollen grains cannot be easily delivered from the anther to the stigma (Figures 4F and 4G). To determine the underlying cause of the shorter filament phenotype, we examined the size of individual cells in the filaments. The length of individual cells was shorter in ap2m-1 plants than in wild-type plants (Figures 4H and 4I), indicating that AP2M plays a role in cell elongation in the staminal filaments. Taken together, these results suggest that ap2m-1 plants have defects in at least three different developmental processes, including pollen biogenesis, pollen tube elongation, and elongation of staminal filaments, which contribute collectively to the phenotype of severe reduction in seed production. Consistent with this notion, AP2M was expressed at high levels in anthers, filaments, and pollen tubes, as determined by β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining from transgenic plants harboring the AP2Mp:GUS construct (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). The phenotypes of ap2m-1 plants, in particular, the defects in pollen production and filament elongation, were reminiscent of the phenotypes of yuc2 yuc6, tir1 afb2 afb3, tir1 abf1 abf2 abf3, and arf6 arf8, all of which have a defect in auxin biosynthesis or signaling (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), raising the possibility that ap2m mutants may also have a defect in maintaining auxin levels. To test whether the failure of pollen elongation is also caused by low levels of auxin, we examined the effect of exogenous auxin application on pollen tube elongation. Indeed, pollen germination and tube growth were restored upon application of auxin (Figures 5A and 5B). These results suggest that AP2M is involved in maintaining auxin levels in anthers and during the growth of staminal filaments and pollen tube elongation. [[FIGURE]] To further test this hypothesis, we examined whether the ap2m-1 mutant plants had any alteration in cellular auxin levels. As a control, we included a pin2 mutant, ethylene insensitive root1-4 (eir1-4), that had a T-DNA insertion in PIN2 (CITATION). eir1-4 plants also showed the shorter filament phenotype in 30% of flowers, thus at a lesser degree compared with the ap2m-1 plants, which had defective flowers at 90% (Figures 6A and 6B). Next, to confirm this finding, we examined the expression of auxin-inducible genes in anthers and filaments. The expression of GFP under the control of DR5rev, an auxin-inducible promoter (CITATION), was greatly reduced in anthers and filaments of ap2m-1 plants compared with wild-type plants (Figures 6C and 6D). In both ap2m-1 and eir1-4 plants, the GFP signals expressed from DR5rev:GFP in anthers and basal sides of the filaments were dramatically reduced to 20%and 65%, respectively, compared with the wild-type plants (Figures 6C and 6D), indicating that auxin levels are altered in both ap2m-1 and eir1-4 mutants, albeit to a lesser degree in eir1-4 plants (Figure 6D). To further confirm that the reduced expression of DR5rev:GFP in ap2m-1 and eir1-4 plants is caused by a defect in auxin distribution, we tested whether application of exogenous auxin can restore the expression of DR5rev:GFP in these mutants. Indeed, the treatment of 1 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for 6 h restored the expression of DR5rev:GFP partially in ap2m-1 plants and almost completely in eir1-4 plants (Figures 6C and 6D), confirming that ap2m-1 plants have a defect in auxin distribution. The difference in severity of defects between the ap2m-1 and eir1-4 mutants raises the possibility that auxin levels are also modulated by other PIN proteins in addition to PIN2 in stamens. [[FIGURE]] In addition, transcript levels of endogenous TIR1 and ARF6 were significantly reduced (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). By contrast, two gibberellin- and two jasmonate-inducible genes used as controls showed only slight or no reduction in their expression (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Intriguingly, the reduced length of ap2m-1 filaments was partially recovered by treatment with IAA, indicating that the ap2m-1 mutant was defective in endogenous auxin levels (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). Since AP-2 is an adaptor protein complex for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CITATION; CITATION), we monitored endocytosis in the filaments of ap2m-1 plants using a lipophilic dye, N-(3-triethylammonium-propyl)-4-(4-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (FM4-64) (CITATION). As observed in the root cells of wild-type plants (CITATION; CITATION), FM4-64 rapidly enters endosomes as early as 30 min after its application to the cells and accumulates in endosomes with almost no signal remaining at the PM (Figure 7A). By contrast, in ap2m-1 plants, FM4-64 was almost exclusively restricted to the PM even 30 min after application (Figure 7A), indicating that endocytosis is impaired in the ap2m-1 plants. Moreover, Tyrphostin A23 nearly completely inhibited endocytosis of FM4-64 in wild-type filaments as observed in ap2m-1 plants (Figure 7A), supporting the idea that AP-2 plays an important role in endocytosis in filaments. [[FIGURE]] Endocytosis plays an important role in polar localization of the auxin efflux transporters of the PIN family (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, it is possible that the level and/or localization of PINs are affected in staminal filaments and pollen tubes of ap2m-1 plants. According to publicly available microarray data, PIN8 showed the highest expression in pollen and filaments, whereas the expression levels of PIN2 and PIN1 are moderate or barely detectable, respectively. However, PIN8 is reported to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (CITATION). Accordingly, to reveal a possible relationship to AP2M function in filament growth, we initially examined localization of GFP-tagged PIN2 in the filaments. In wild-type plants, PIN2:GFP localized to the PM. Interestingly, PIN2:GFP showed polarity in its distribution with strong basal signals in 28% of the cells (Figures 7B and 7C). However, in ap2m-1 filaments, PIN2:GFP showed a striking alteration in its localization, thus revealing a punctate staining pattern along the PM (Figure 7B). These results indicate that AP2M plays a crucial role in polar localization of PIN2 at the PM of the filaments. This is similar to the case with cells in the root cortex, which also show a basal distribution in the PM (CITATION). To confirm that the PIN2:GFP localization pattern in ap2m-1 plants is caused by a defect in endocytosis, wild-type filaments were treated with Tyrphostin A23, or Tyrphostin A51 as a control, and the localization of PIN2:GFP was examined after briefly staining with FM4-64 to visualize the PM. As observed in ap2m-1 plants, Tyrphostin A23 but not Tyrphostin A51 treatment induced a punctate staining pattern of PIN2:GFP along the PM. To test whether PIN2:GFP punctate stains localize at the PM, we compared its localization with FM4-64. PIN2:GFP-positive punctate stains closely overlapped with FM4-64. To quantify the colocalization, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient value and confirmed their close colocalization (rp = 0.84 and 0.86 for ap2m-1 and wild type/A23, respectively; Figure 7D), which in turn confirmed the localization of PIN2:GFP at the PM. These results suggest that AP-2–mediated endocytosis plays a crucial role in the proper distribution of PIN2 in the filaments. These results suggested that internalization of PIN2:GFP from the PM is defective in ap2m-1 mutant plants. Furthermore, the punctate stains on the PM raised the possibility that PIN2:GFP accumulates at certain sites on the PM but cannot be internalized. Moreover, this localization pattern confirms the idea that PIN2:GFP accumulates at specific site on the PM in the intact filaments. To confirm that PIN2 is internalized by endocytosis involving AP-2, we examined the interaction of PIN2 with AP-2 by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-AP2A (α-adaptin) antibody. PIN2 was detected in the immunocomplexes obtained with the anti-AP2A antibody (Figure 7C), confirming that AP-2 interacts with PIN2.
!~MM~! Wild-type and ap2m mutant Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia-0) plants were grown under a 16-h/8-h photoperiod at 22°C in rooftop (40% relative humidity) or indoor (70% relative humidity) greenhouses. The AP2M knockout mutant ap2m-1 (SALK_083693) and ap2m-2 (CS807972) were obtained from Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (http://signal.Salk.edu/). To generate the AP2A1Pro:AP2A1:YFP and AP2A1:YFP construct, the promoter region and the AP2A1 cDNA were amplified by PCR (Bioneer) using specific primers AP2A1Pro(Bam HI)-5′ and AP2A1Pro(Spe I)-3′, and AP2A1(Xba I)-5′ and AP2A1(Sal I)-3′, respectively. The products were inserted into the vector PCAMBIA3301 (Invitrogen) using BamHI and SpeI, XbaI and SalI, respectively. The AP2M cDNA was isolated by PCR using the gene-specific primers AP2M-5′ and AP2M-3′ (see Supplemental Table 1 online). To generate the complementation line of ap2m-1 mutants, the Myc epitope was added right behind to the N-terminal spanning domain of AP2M by overlapping PCR using the primers AP2M-5′, AP2M-3′, AP2M:Mycx3-5′, and AP2M:Mycx3-3′ in such a way that the first-round PCR was performed using the primers AP2M-5′ and AP2M:Mycx3-3′ for the 5′ fragment, and AP2M:Mycx3-5′ and AP2M-3′ for the 3′ fragment. Subsequently, PCR products were ligated by the second-round PCR using primers AP2M-5′ and AP2M-3′. The products were inserted to PCAMBIA3301 (Invitrogen) and 326-sGFP (CITATION) using XbaI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. To obtain the promoter region of AP2M, PCR was performed using primers AP2Mpro(SpeI)-5′ and AP2Mpro(SpeI)-3′ with genomic DNA as template, and the PCR product was inserted into the upstream of AP2M:Mycx3 using the SpeI restriction site. To generate the AP2M promoter (AP2Mp):GUS construct, a genomic DNA fragment containing a 2.4-kb AP2M promoter region (−2400 to −1 positions) was amplified by PCR using specific primers AP2Mpro(BamHI):GUS-5′ and AP2Mpro(NcoI):GUS-3′, and the PCR product was inserted into the vector PCAMBIA3301 using BamHI and NcoI restriction sites. The AP2A1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (see Supplemental Table 1 online). The PCR product was ligated 326-YFP using XbaI and SalI restriction sites. To generate transgenic plants with suppression of both AP2A1 (At5g22770) and AP2A2 (At5g22780) that encode α-adaptin simultaneously, an RNAi construct was designed using a DNA fragment from nucleotide positions 150 to 699 of AP2A1 that shows identical sequence to the corresponding region of AP2A2. The DNA fragment was isolated by PCR using primers AP2ARNAi-5′ and AP2ARNAi-3′ and inserted into pENTER vector using XhoI and Acc65I restriction sites. Subsequently, the AP2A1 RNAi construct in the pENTER vector was transferred to pHellgate8 with LR clonase (Invitrogen) to generate the pHellsgate-AP2A1 RNAi construct. The generation of the AP1M2:HAx3 construct was performed as described (CITATION). The amino acid sequences were aligned using the program ClustalW2. Protein sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. Sequence alignments data are provided in Supplemental Figure 2 online. The binary vectors were used to transform wild-type and ap2m heterozygote plants, according to a published protocol (CITATION). Transgenic plants were screened on Murashige and Skoog plates supplemented with hygromycin (25 mg/L) or phosphinothricin (25 mg/L). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (CITATION) with some modification. Protein extracts were prepared in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1% [v/v] Triton X-100) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and incubated with 4 µg of Myc antibody (Cell Signaling) and AP2A (α-adaptin) antibody for 4 h at 4°C. For coimmunoprecipitation experiment, anti-AP2A antibody (4 μg) was used as bait. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by incubating them with Protein A agarose beads for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, suspended in homogenization buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-AP2A (CITATION), anti-AP1G, anti-PIN2 (Agrisera), or anti-CHC antibodies, respectively (CITATION). Protein extracts in sonication buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 150 mM NaCl) were separated into soluble and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 1 h. Soluble and pellet fractions were collected separately and placed in denaturation buffer supplemented with 2.5% SDS and 2% β-mercaptoethanol. These fractions were analyzed by protein gel blotting using Myc antibody. AALP (CITATION) and VSR (CITATION) antibodies were used to detect soluble or membrane fractions, respectively. Agrobacteria harboring the AP2A1:YFP construct were grown overnight at 28°C in 5 mL Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. The overnight culture was inoculated into fresh Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and Agrobacteria were grown to OD 1 to 2 at 600 nm. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g and resuspended in new medium (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, pH 5.6, and 150 μM acetosyringone) to OD 0.5 at 600 nm and then incubated at 28°C for 4 h (CITATION). For infiltration of Agrobacterium into CLC:CFP transgenic plant leaves, the culture was injected into leaves using a 1-mL syringe without a needle (CITATION). Agrobacterium-infiltrated plants were kept in the dark for 1 d, and infected leaves were observed 3 d after infiltration using a confocal laser scanning microscope. For agroinfiltration into root hair cells, the Agrobacterium culture solution was applied twice to the root tissues under vacuum (10 mmHg) for 1 min. Excess infiltration medium was removed, and the plates were incubated in a culture room for 3 d (CITATION). For chemical treatments, FM4-64 (Invitrogen), Tyrphostin A23 (MP-Biomedical), Tyrphostin A51 (MP-Biomedical), and Wortmannin (Enzo Life Science) were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and added to half-strength Murashige and Skoog liquid medium to give the final concentration of 4 μM FM4-64, 30 μM Tyrphostin A23, 30 μM Tyrphostin A51, and 33 μM Wortmannin. Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope. The combinations of excitation wavelength/emission filter were 488 nm (argon-ion laser)/515 to 530 band-pass for GFP; 458 nm (argon-ion laser)/475 to 525 band-pass for CFP; 514 nm (argon-ion laser)/530 to 560 band-pass for YFP; 543 nm (HeNe laser)/560 to 615 band-pass for monomeric RFP and FM4-64. In addition, images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. The images were processed using the LSM 5 image browser and Adobe Photoshop 7 and presented as pseudo images. The overlap of images was analyzed using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients colocalization plug-in of the ImageJ analysis program (CITATION). A threshold level of 10 was set, under which pixel values were considered noised and not included in the statistical analysis. To detect expression of GUS from AP2Mpro:GUS in transgenic plants, T2 plants from 10 independent transgenic lines were stained with X-GLUC as described (CITATION). Whole plants were soaked in X-GLUC solution at 37°C for 3 h. For pollen germination and pollen tube growth, wild-type and ap2m mutant plants were grown with a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle at 22°C in a rooftop greenhouse. Open flowers were obtained from wild-type plants 2 weeks after bolting and dehydrated for 1 h at room temperature. Pollen grains were transferred by brushing the flowers onto an germination agar plate [18% Suc, 0.01% boric acid, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, and 1% low-melting agarose, pH 7.0] (CITATION). Pollen grains were germinated at 28°C for 5 h, examined with a light microscope, and photographed (Axioskop 2) with a charge-coupled device camera (Axio Cam; Carl Zeiss). Pollen tube length was measured from photographs using the Interactive Measurement software package AxioVision 3.0.6 (Carl Zeiss). To test viability of pollen, grains were released from anthers and soaked in a staining solution containing 1 µg/mL propidium iodide and 0.5 µg/mL FDA, and pollen grains were observed under an epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2; Carl Zeiss). Anthers from wild-type and ap2m-1 knockout mutant plants were fixed with solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4°C for 4 h, rinsed with the phosphate buffer, and fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide for another 4 h at 4°C. The samples were dehydrated in an alcohol series and embedded in LR White resin (London Resin Company). For light or transmission electron microscopy, 1-μm or 40- to 50-nm sections were obtained using an ultramicrotome (Bromma 2088; LKB), respectively. The sections were collected on a nickel grid (1-GN, 150 mesh) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For electron microscopy, a JEM-100CX-1 transmission electron microscope was used. The PIN2 polarity in filaments was observed using a super-resolution structured illumination microscope (SIM; Nikon N-SIM). The raw images were reconstructed to 3D-SIM image using NIS-E software (Nikon). Images were taken with an Eclipse Ti-E research inverted microscope with Nikon's CFI Apo TIRF ×100 oil objective lens (numerical aperture of 1.49) and 512 × 512 pixel resolution with an iXon DU-897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology). Multicolor fluorescence was acquired using a diode laser (488 and 561 nm). The excised filaments or total tissues from wild-type plants and ap2m-1 mutant plants were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit (Ambion) and digested with TURBO DNase (Ambion). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems), and 50 ng of cDNA was used to detect transcript levels of marker genes by quantitative RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems) using a SYBR Green Kit (Applied Biosystems). ACT2 was used as an internal control. Primer sequences were as follows (Supplemental Table 1 online): ACT2-5′ and ACT2-3′ for ACT2, AP2MqRT-5′ and AP2MqRT-3′ for AP2M, ARF6-5′ and ARF6-3′ for ARF6, ARF8-5′ and ARF8-3′ for ARF8, AFB2-5′ and AFB2-3′ for AFB2, AFB3-5′ and AFB3-3′ for AFB3, TIR1-5′ and TIR1-3′ for TIR1, MYB21-5′ and MYB21-3′ for MYB21, MYB24-5′ and MYB24-3′ for MYB24, MYB57-5′ and MYB57-3′ for MYB57, and RGA-5′ and RGA-3′ for RGA.
