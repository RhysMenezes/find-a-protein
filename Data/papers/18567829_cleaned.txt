!~ABS~! Ca2+ is required for protein processing, sorting, and secretion in eukaryotic cells, although the particular roles of the transporters involved in the secretory system of plants are obscure. One endomembrane-type Ca-ATPase from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), AtECA3, diverges from AtECA1, AtECA2, and AtECA4 in protein sequence; yet, AtECA3 appears similar in transport activity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound AtECA1. Expression of AtECA3 in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant defective in its endogenous Ca2+ pumps conferred the ability to grow on Ca2+-depleted medium and tolerance to toxic levels of Mn2+. A green fluorescent protein-tagged AtECA3 was functionally competent and localized to intracellular membranes of yeast, suggesting that Ca2+ and Mn2+ loading into internal compartment(s) enhanced yeast proliferation. In mesophyll protoplasts, AtECA3-green fluorescent protein associated with a subpopulation of endosome/prevacuolar compartments based on partial colocalization with the Ara7 marker. Interestingly, three independent eca3 T-DNA disruption mutants showed severe reduction in root growth normally stimulated by 3 mm Ca2+, indicating that AtECA3 function cannot be replaced by an ER-associated AtECA1. Furthermore, root growth of mutants is sensitive to 50 μm Mn2+, indicating that AtECA3 is also important for the detoxification of excess Mn2+. Curiously, Ateca3 mutant roots produced 65% more apoplastic protein than wild-type roots, as monitored by peroxidase activity, suggesting that the secretory process was altered. Together, these results demonstrate that the role of AtECA3 is distinct from that of the more abundant ER AtECA1. AtECA3 supports Ca2+-stimulated root growth and the detoxification of high Mn2+, possibly through activities mediated by post-Golgi compartments that coordinate membrane traffic and sorting of materials to the vacuole and the cell wall.
!~RES~! Several ECAs from Arabidopsis, rice, and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) clustered on a phylogenetic tree with mammalian sarcoplasmic/ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA; Fig. 1A ); however, only AtECA3 and OsECA3 shared higher identity (53%) with mammalian SERCA1a than with other members of the ECA subfamily (44.6%–45.1%). Intriguingly, none of the plant ECAs grouped with SPCA or secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases (CITATION; CITATION), which are represented by yeast Pmr1 and human SPCA (Fig. 1A). [[FIGURE]] Sequence alignments revealed further insights. AtECA3 shared considerable amino acid sequence identity with transmembrane 3 (TM3), TM5, and TM7 of mammalian SERCA. The α-helices of TM3, TM5, and TM7 form the cavity that binds thapsigargin in the E2 conformation state of rabbit skeletal muscle SERCA (CITATION). Interestingly, among the hydrophobic residues that face thapsigargin, Val-263, Val-773, and Phe-834 of rabbit OcSERCA (P04191) and human HsSERCA1 (O14983) are conserved and identical in the plant ECA3 from Arabidopsis and rice (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, these residues are not found in yeast Pmr1p (SPCA) or AtECA1 (Fig. 1B), both of which are insensitive to thapsigargin (CITATION). In addition, an extra tripeptide sequence, Q/HEA, corresponding to residues 240 and 241 of OcSERCA1, was present in most plant ECAs but not in ECA3. This analysis suggests that AtECA3 is distinct from other Arabidopsis ECAs and that plant ECA3-like proteins are structurally the most similar to animal ERCAs. To determine the transport function of AtECA3 (or ECA3 for simplicity), a cDNA containing the complete open reading frame (ORF; AY650902) was cloned (see “Materials and Methods”) and expressed in yeast strain K616. The complete ORF of 2,994 bases encoded a protein of 997 residues. K616 is incapable of loading Ca2+ and Mn2+ into specific endomembrane compartments with high affinity (CITATION), as it lacks a functional Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+ pump (Pmr1p) and a vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase (Pmc1), respectively. Therefore, growth of K616 is retarded or arrested when the culture medium contains submicromolar Ca2+ or toxic levels of Mn2+. However, the strain proliferates on medium containing high Ca2+ (0.1–1 mm) using Vcx1p, a vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger that sequesters Ca2+ into endomembrane compartments (CITATION). The K616 strain expressing AtECA3 grew slower than yeast expressing the empty p426 vector in synthetic complete (SC) medium containing no EGTA (Fig. 2A ). However, when free Ca2+ was reduced to approximately 0.8 μm by 5 mm EGTA (CITATION), growth of the K616 strain was severely curtailed. AtECA3 partially restored yeast K616 growth on Ca2+-depleted medium relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). Curiously, under the same Gal1 promoter, AtECA3 was less effective than ECA1 (Fig. 2B) and AtECA4 (data not shown) in restoring mutant growth on Ca2+-depleted medium. AtECA1 rescued K616 growth in medium containing 10 mm EGTA, as shown before (CITATION), while AtECA3 did not (data not shown). However, AtECA3 effectively restored mutant growth on medium containing 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 3 ), indicating that the two ECAs, although similar in transport activity, might differ in their kinetic properties, membrane localization, or expression level, as suggested below. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We tested whether AtECA3 might support yeast growth at high Mn2+. AtECA3 expression under the Gal1 promoter on vector p426 failed to suppress the Mn2+ sensitivity of strain K616 (data not shown). Consequently, AtECA3 was expressed using pDR196, which contains a very strong constitutive promoter of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase1 (PMA1; CITATION). Under the PMA1 promoter, AtECA3 expression improved K616 growth on medium containing 1 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 2C). This observation suggested that AtECA3 can also function as a Mn2+ pump to remove excess Mn2+ from the cytosol, similar to the ER-bound AtECA1 (CITATION). To localize AtECA3 protein in yeast, a construct was made to generate a GFP fusion to the C terminus of AtECA3. Unlike other AtECAs, AtECA3 lacks a typical ER-retention motif, KxKxx, at its extreme C terminus, although it is rich in basic amino acid residues (KDRRDK). AtECA3-GFP fluorescence was observed in intracellular tubular and granular structures (Supplemental Fig. S2) that resembled the distribution of Pmr1p-GFP, a yeast Ca2+ pump localized to the ER and Golgi (CITATION). The GFP-tagged protein restored the growth of K616 transformants on medium containing 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the functionally active ECA3-GFP is localized to endomembranes in yeast. To test the biological function of AtECA3 in planta, several T-DNA insertional lines (3-1, 3-4, and 3-5) were identified from the Salk collection (CITATION) and from Syngenta (CITATION). Homozygous lines of each allele were obtained and their genotypes confirmed by PCR. Left border sequencing of the T-DNA was conducted to verify the insertion site of each allele (Fig. 4A ). Mutants Ateca3-5 and Ateca3-1b hosted T-DNA insertions in intron 11 and intron 12, respectively, while Ateca3-4 had an insertion in exon 18. [[FIGURE]] To test for AtECA3 transcript, total RNA was extracted from 2-week-old wild-type and mutant plants grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Fig. 4B) and reverse transcribed. Primers were designed to amplify any transcript upstream or downstream of the insertion site. Primers flanking the T-DNA insertion site and primer set E3′F and E3′R failed to amplify any product from all three mutants. Nevertheless, primers E5′F and E5′R amplified a product of 638 bp upstream of the insertion site in all three mutant alleles, indicating the presence of a truncated mRNA. Although the length of these transcripts is unclear, any potential translated protein would likely include only four TM regions (Lys-293) out of eight to 10 TM found in P-type 2A ATPases. A protein lacking a complete hydrophilic domain and TM5 to TM8 is unlikely to have any catalytic activity. These T-DNA insertional lines were used in phenotypic analyses as nonfunctional Ateca3 mutants. Siblings without T-DNA insertions from the same segregating population were used as wild-type controls. All three homozygous mutant lines were viable and completed their life cycle under normal conditions. No obvious growth or developmental defects were observed in the vegetative plants grown on soil. Our results suggested that calcium pump ECA3 also catalyzes the transport of Mn2+ into endomembrane compartments, as its expression in the yeast mutant K616 conferred tolerance to toxic levels of Mn2+ (1 mm; Fig. 2). So we examined the effect of Mn2+ levels on root growth. Plants were first grown in quarter-strength Hoagland nutrient medium containing from 3 to 100 μm Mn2+. The root length of mutants was similar to that of wild-type plants in medium containing Mn2+ at 3.5 (Fig. 5A ), 10, or 20 μm (data not shown). But root growth of eca3-4 was clearly reduced compared with that of wild-type plants when Mn2+ was elevated to 50 μm. Moreover, mutants manifested little or no lateral roots after 3 d of growth, suggesting inhibition of lateral root initiation. The compromised root growth also caused changes in shoot growth, such as reduced leaf expansion and rosette size (data not shown). Therefore, as in yeast, AtECA3 conferred tolerance to high Mn2+ in plants. [[FIGURE]] Similar results were obtained when plants were nourished by half-strength MS medium, which contains 50 μm Mn2+. Primary roots of wild-type plants grew, but eca3-4 mutant growth was inhibited (Fig. 5B). Wild-type plants also became sensitive when Mn2+ was increased to 100 μm (Fig. 5B). It is noted that a concentration of 50 μm Mn2+ in half-strength MS medium is considered unusually high compared with a recommended Mn2+ of less than 10 μm in Hoagland's nutrient medium (CITATION). Therefore, 50 μm probably imposes a Mn2+ stress that is tolerated by the wild type but not by mutant seedlings. In contrast, increasing Cu2+ inhibited the root growth of both wild-type and eca3-4 plants similarly (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that AtECA3 could alleviate Mn2+ toxicity through a mechanism distinct from that which guards against Cu2+ toxicity, another essential yet potentially toxic divalent heavy metal. These results are consistent with the notion that AtECA3 transports Mn2+ but is not involved in transporting Cu2+. Ca2+ at a few millimolar concentration is required for root growth (CITATION), so we tested the effect of Ca2+ on root growth in mutant lines containing a T-DNA insertion in the AtECA3 gene. The effect of external Ca2+ on root growth in wild-type seedlings was first tested using half-strength MS medium in which the Ca2+ concentration was specifically varied. Calcium at 3 mm stimulated root growth (Fig. 6B ), as shown before (CITATION). Reduced root length at 0.1 mm or less Ca2+ confirmed that this level of Ca2+ limited growth. Similarly, root growth at 20 mm Ca2+ was decreased, demonstrating that excess Ca2+ was stressful to the seedling (Fig. 6B). [[FIGURE]] Intriguingly, the 3 mm Ca2+-stimulated root growth was not observed in eca3-1b or eca3-4 mutants (Fig. 6B), indicating that mutants were nearly insensitive to the beneficial effects of Ca2+. Similar results were observed in the eca3-5 mutant (Fig. 6C). At 3 mm Ca2+, root lengths of eca3-1b and eca3-4 mutants were reduced by 33% and 34%, respectively, compared with wild-type controls. With 3 mm external Ca2+, it is reasonable to assume that Ca2+ entry pathways via cation-permeable channels are functional in eca3 mutants. Thus, the results indicate that reduced growth is due to defective sorting of cytosolic Ca2+ into one or more intracellular compartments or organelles. The tissue-specific pattern of expression for AtECA3 was examined by GUS reporter activity driven by a 5-kb intergenic region upstream of the ORF. In vegetative tissues, AtECA3 promoter∷GUS activity was enriched in vascular tissues of primary roots (Fig. 7A ), lateral roots (Fig. 7B), and young expanding leaves (Fig. 7E). At the root tip, GUS activity first appeared in the elongation and differentiation zones (Fig. 7, A and B) but was not detectable in the cell division zone under the conditions tested. GUS activity was not detected in the shoot apex (Fig. 7, C and D) or in fully expanded cotyledons (Fig. 7D). Promoter activity was also detected in vascular tissues of floral pedicels and of the style (Fig. 7, F–H). Expression of AtECA3 in other cell types is not excluded by this analysis, as the GUS gene was transcriptionally fused to the 5′ regulatory region only, so that any transcriptional regulation by cis-acting elements within introns would be missed, as would 3′ or chromosomal positional effects. RT-PCR of total RNA verified the presence of AtECA3 transcripts in root and leaf (CITATION). Using a smaller 1.5-kb promoter fragment upstream of AtECA3, CITATION showed that expression in vascular tissues was enriched in xylem parenchyma and the pericyle. In addition, GUS activity was detected in root caps, hydathodes, and guard cells (CITATION). Thus, although minor differences exist in the two studies, the results using either a 1.5- or 5-kb promoter show similarities that are supported in general by whole genome ATH1 chip data (http://www.geneinvestigator.ethz.ch). [[FIGURE]] The AtECA3 promoter activity appeared to be lower than that of AtECA1 or AtECA4 based on 2 d of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-glucuronide (X-Gluc) staining required to visualize GUS activity. In contrast, AtECA1 promoter∷GUS activity was detected after 3 h of incubation in X-Gluc in roots and leaves, including the root tip, lateral roots, vascular tissues, ground tissues, and guard cells (Supplemental Fig. S3). The higher expression of AtECA1 relative to AtECA3 is supported by the root expression map from the Benfey laboratory (Supplemental Fig. S4). Together, these results confirm that AtECA3 is expressed in all cell types found in roots but that its expression is consistently much lower than that of AtECA1. Although functional studies from yeast and plants suggest that AtECA3 is localized to endomembrane compartments, the identity of the compartment is unclear. We determined the membrane location of AtECA3 after transient expression using the S35 cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts (CITATION; CITATION). We first demonstrated that the AtECA3 fused at the C terminus to GFP retained native activity, judging by its ability to restore yeast mutant growth on Ca2+-depleted medium or medium containing toxic levels of Mn2+ (Fig. 3). Cells expressing ECA3-GFP alone (Fig. 8Ae ) had small punctate fluorescence that resembled the puncta seen in Golgi or post-Golgi compartment markers (Fig. 8A, f–h), including sialyl transferase, Syp41, or Ara7 (CITATION; CITATION). The puncta from ECA3-GFP were dissimilar from those emitted from the ER or a vacuolar marker (Syp22). A GFP tag at the C terminus apparently did not interfere with potential retention signals for another calcium pump, as AtECA1 tagged with GFP at the C terminus gave a reticulate fluorescent pattern characteristic of ER when it was transiently expressed in protoplasts (Fig. 8Aa). AtECA1 was previously localized to the ER by cell fractionation and immunostaining (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To clarify the membrane location, ECA3-GFP was coexpressed with markers tagged with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) in protoplasts. The fluorescence signals were carefully collected with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using different emission wavelengths. ECA3-GFP did not colocalize with ST-RFP or with RFP-Syp41 (Fig. 8B), which are markers for the trans-Golgi or the trans-Golgi network, respectively (CITATION, CITATION). ECA3-GFP colocalized in part with RFP-Ara7, an endosome/PVC marker (CITATION; CITATION), as indicated by the extent of yellow fluorescence in merged images (Fig. 8Bc″). These results suggest that ECA3-GFP is localized to a subpopulation of post-Golgi compartments, including endosomes and PVCs. Because plant post-Golgi compartments are involved in the processing, sorting, and exocytosis of proteins, we wondered whether secretory activities might be compromised in eca3 mutants. The activities of secreted apoplastic peroxidases (APXs) were examined in roots from hydroponically grown plants. Apoplastic washing fluid (AWF) was extracted from roots by first vacuum infiltrating the tissue with buffer and then collecting the fluid by centrifugation. Guaiacol-dependent peroxidase activity was then monitored spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of guaiacol by hydrogen peroxide to form tetraguaiacol. We first established that the enzyme reaction, monitored by the appearance of tetraguaiacol, was linear for 2 min (Fig. 9A ). The initial rate of the reaction was then estimated from the slope. Increasing aliquots of AWF from wild-type roots produced an enhanced rate of guaiacol oxidation, indicating that Arabidopsis roots contained extracellular peroxidase activity (Fig. 9B). Based on four independent experiments, the extracellular peroxidase activity of wild-type roots was estimated to be 79 nmol min−1 g−1 fresh weight of root. When AWF of mutants was analyzed, an increase in APX was consistently observed when activity was expressed per gram fresh weight of roots. The APX activity of eca3-4 mutants was approximately 147 nmol min−1 g−1 fresh weight of root. [[FIGURE]] In three independent experiments, the activity of the mutants was 80%, 86%, and 86% higher than that of wild-type controls (Fig. 10 ). The increase in activity was accompanied by an increased amount of apoplastic protein by the mutants. eca3-4 mutant roots produced 39%, 60%, and 95% (in three separate experiments) more protein per gram fresh weight of tissue than did wild-type roots. Similar results were obtained with the eca3-5 mutant, which produced 2-fold more apoplastic protein than did wild-type roots (data not shown). Thus, the specific activity of peroxidase (nanomoles per minute per microgram of protein) was relatively unchanged in the apoplastic fluid between the wild type and mutants. Interestingly, the increase in both activity and protein in the mutants was still detected when they were based on milliliters of AWF (Fig. 10). These results indicate that the concentration of protein and peroxidase was increased in the extracellular fluid of mutants. The volume of fluid collected per gram fresh weight of tissue was quite similar, although slightly more (19%) was recovered from the mutant than from the wild type. Together, these results suggest that the secretory process of the eca3 mutant is altered, causing an increase in total apoplastic protein and a proportional increase in the activity of secreted peroxidase activity. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Wild-type and eca3 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants (Columbia [Col] ecotype) were used in this study. Homozygous seed stocks for eca3-1b, eca3-4, and eca3-5 correspond to SAIL_557_C07, SALK_032802, and SALK_045567 lines, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). For growth on plates, Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized by soaking in 20% (v/v) Clorox and 0.05% Tween 20 for 10 min followed by five rinses in sterile water. The seeds were placed on half-strength MS medium (CITATION) containing 0.8% agar and 2.5 mm MES-K at pH 5.7, followed by stratification at 4°C for 3 d in the dark. The plates were then positioned vertically in Conviron ATC60 growth chambers with a photoperiod of 16 h of light under an illumination of 120 to 180 μE m−2 s−1 and 8 h of dark. The temperature was set at 22°C in the day and 20°C at night. For soil-grown plants, Arabidopsis seeds were planted on synthetic soil mixture containing Miracle-Gro potting mix and perlite, followed by 3 d at 4°C in the dark, before being taken to growth chambers with a photoperiod of 16 h of light of 120 to 180 μE m−2 s−1 at 22°C and 8 h of dark at 20°C and 60% relative humidity, or with a short-day photoperiod of 10 to 12 h of light of 120 μE m−2 s−1. Plants were watered twice per week or as needed. Wild-type and mutant plants were always grown side by side in the same tray and growth chamber for consistency. Three days after germination on square plates containing standard half-strength MS medium, the seedlings were transferred onto half-strength MS medium plates containing different Mn2+ concentrations as specified in “Results.” The plates were then positioned in an inverted orientation for another few days before photographs were taken by scanning the plates using a Umax Astra 1200S scanner. Root measurement was conducted using ScionImage software (Scion). The wild-type and mutant plants were treated with the same conditions by placing them side by side on the same plate. Arabidopsis seeds were dispersed on quarter-strength Hoagland medium (CITATION) solidified with 0.5% agar on the bottom of a 1-mL tip box (approximately 0.5 cm depth). After germination, the tip boxes were floated on quarter-strength Hoagland medium (pH 5.5, 10 mm MES-K) aerated by a fish tank air pump. Medium was replaced twice per week to prevent algal contamination. Roots penetrating the medium were excised after 3 to 4 weeks. ECA3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from first-strand cDNA. The template was reverse transcribed from total RNA of 3-week-old rosette leaves using primers ECA3-f and ECA3-r (Supplemental Table S1). Proofreading High-Fidelity Taq DNA Polymerase Deep Vent (New England Biolabs) was used to amplify the DNA. The PCR product was purified by gel extraction and ligated to an EcoRV-linearized vector pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The cloned sequence was verified by sequencing (GenBank accession no. AY650902) and used for subsequent cDNA subcloning. Genomic DNA was isolated from 4-week-old plants using the cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide method (CITATION). Based on the annotation of bacterial artificial chromosome clone T27I1 (AC004122), the region between the AtECA3 start codon and its immediate upstream ORF (AK230347) was taken as the ECA3 promoter. This region was amplified using primer sequences with appended restriction enzyme sites, ECA3-pf and ECA3-pr (Supplemental Table S1). The PCR-amplified product of 5.2 kb was digested with XhoI and NcoI and cloned into a GUS ORF-containing vector pRITA to make a promoter∷GUS construct, ECA3-RITA. The construct was verified by sequencing. The NotI-NotI fragment of ECA-RITA was ligated to the binary vector pMLBART. The resulting pECA3-GUS-MLBART construct was introduced into plants by the floral dip method (CITATION), and plants homozygous for a Basta resistance marker were analyzed for promoter∷GUS activity. Transgenic plants containing ECA1 promoter∷GUS were obtained using a similar method. Primers ECA1-pf and ECA1-pr (Supplemental Table S1) were used to amplify a 3.1-kb fragment upstream of the ECA1 ORF. Conventional cloning and Gateway cloning methods were used to obtain GFP-tagged AtECA3. For conventional cloning, AtECA3 cDNA was amplified by PCR using platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the primer pair ECA3-GFPf and ECA3-GFPr (Supplemental Table S1). The resultant PCR-amplified product for the C-tail-fused GFP was digested with BspHI and ligated to the NcoI-cut vector pAVA393 (CITATION). The resultant construct, ECA3-GFP-393, was verified by sequencing of the AtECA3 coding region and contains a CaMV 35S promoter. For Gateway cloning, the AtECA3 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers ECA3-Gf and ECA3-Gr. The PCR-amplified fragment of AtECA3 (stop codon removed) was cloned into the Gateway vector pDONR221 (Invitrogen) to produce an entry clone, ECA3-DONR221, using BP recombination cloning strategy. The sequence of the AtECA3 insert was verified. The clone ECA3-DONR221 was then cloned into the Gateway destination binary vector pK7FWG2 by LR recombination (CITATION). The resultant construct, ECA3-FWG, contains an expression cassette of CaMV P35S-ECA3-eGFP-T35S. Both conventional clones and Gateway clones were used in localization experiments. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 was transformed with the binary vectors via electroporation and transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani plates with gentamicin and spectinomycin. Arabidopsis ecotype Col plants were transformed with Agrobacterium using the floral dip method (CITATION). Plant transformants were selected on plates containing Basta (50 mg L−1 glufosinate ammonium [Crescent Chemical]) or 50 μg mL−1 kanamycin. At least five T3 lines were checked for a consistent GUS staining pattern (CITATION). Samples at various stages were harvested in 90% acetone, rinsed once with staining buffer containing 50 mm Na+ phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.5 mM K4Fe[CN]6, and 0.5 mm K3Fe[CN]6, and then incubated for 48 h at 37°C in buffer containing 1 mm X-Gluc. The reaction was stopped in 70% ethanol, and chlorophyll was cleared in 95% ethanol. GUS activity was visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with differential interference contrast (Nikon Instruments), and images were recorded using a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains used were W303-1A (MATa, ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1), K616 (Pmr1∷HIS3 pmc1∷TRP1 cnb1∷LEU2), and K667 (cnb1∷LEU2 pmc1∷TRP vcx1Δ; CITATION, CITATION). Yeast was transformed with AtECA3 constructs by the lithium acetate method (CITATION). AtECA3 cDNA was initially subcloned into the yeast expression vector p426 (CITATION) by ternary ligation of three fragments: 1.2-kb fragment of a KpnI/HindIII-digested ECA3-BSK clone, 1.6-kb fragment of a SpeI/KpnI-digested ECA3-BSK, and 6.3-kb fragment of a SpeI/HindIII-digested p426. This strategy was taken due to limited restriction enzyme sites in the p426 vector and an internal KpnI site in AtECA3. The final vector, p426-ECA3, contains a GAL1 promoter∷AtECA3 expression cassette and was verified by enzyme digestion. For Gateway cloning, ECA3-DONR221 was recombined with three destination vectors, pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen), pYESDR196, and pGWFDR196 (Supplemental Materials and Methods S1). The first two cassettes drive strong expression of ECA3 under the GAL1 promoter (GAL1∷ECA3) and the PMA1 promoter (PMA1∷ECA3). In pYESDR196, the GAL1 promoter was replaced by the PMA1 promoter (Supplemental Materials and Methods S1). The pGWDR196 vector uses the PMA1 promoter to drive the expression of ECA3 fused at its C-terminal tail to GFP. At least three independent transformants from each construct were inoculated in synthetic complete medium with Glc but no uracil (SC-URA/glu). An overnight culture (5–10 mL) was diluted to an A600 of 0.5, washed twice, and suspended in sterile water. A six-step serial dilution of 5-fold was prepared in sterile water for each culture. Five microliters of each was spotted onto the SC-URA plates (with Glc or Gal) supplemented with different ions or EGTA. The pH of the medium was maintained with 10 mm MES-KOH at pH 5.5 or 6.4. Growth at 30°C was recorded at varying times. Transient expression was conducted according to published protocols with modifications (CITATION; CITATION; Uemura et al., 2004; CITATION). Arabidopsis leaves from approximately 3-week-old plants grown under continuous low light (40–50 μE m−2 s−1) and constant temperature (21°C) were cut into small strips and digested in 2.5 mL of enzyme solution for 3 h. The digestion solution consisted of 1.3% cellulose R10, 0.25% macerozyme R100 (Yakult), 0.4 m mannitol, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm MES at pH 5.7, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1% fetal bovine serum (Sigma; no. F6178), and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protoplasts were filtered through 70-μm nylon mesh and centrifuged at 100g for 2 min. The pellets were washed twice in W5 solution containing 0.35 m mannitol, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm Glc, and 2 mm MES at pH 5.7 by centrifugation at 100g for 1 min. Protoplasts were resuspended in MMg solution (0.4 m mannitol, 15 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm MES at pH 5.7) prior to transfection. Plasmids were purified by Miniprep kit (QIAGEN; no. 27160) or Plasmid Midi kit (QIAGEN; no. 12143) and resuspended in 0.4 m mannitol. For each transfection, 10 μL of protoplast suspension (1–2 × 104 cells) was added to a mixture of 40 μL of plasmids (5–10 μg per plasmid), 5 μL of M10Mg solution (0.4 m mannitol, 150 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm MES), and 55 μL of PEG-Ca solution (40% PEG4000 [Fluka; no. 81240], 0.2 m mannitol, and 100 mm CaNO3). After incubation at room temperature for 20 to 30 min, the transfection mixture was diluted with 700 μL of W5 solution and centrifuged at 100g for 45 s. After supernatant removal, protoplasts were resuspended in 300 μL of WI solution (0.5 m mannitol, 8 mm K2HPO4, and 2 mm MES) and 400 μL of MS solution (0.45 m mannitol, 1× MS salt mixture [GIBCO; no. 11117-058], 1× Gamborg's vitamin solution [Sigma; no. G1019], 2% Suc, 2 mm MES, and 100 μg/mL ampicillin). Transfected protoplasts were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 18 to 24 h before microscopy. In general, the efficiency of a single transfection of marker proteins is 50% or more; however, the efficiency is lower in cotransfections due to differences in fluorescent signals and the expression level of each gene. Fluorescent signals in protoplasts were examined on the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss), usually 18 to 24 h after transfection. The filter sets used for excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) are as follows: GFP, 488 nm (Ex)/BP505 to 530 nm (Em); RFP, 543 nm (Ex)/BP560 to 615 nm (Em); chlorophyll, 543 nm (Ex)/LP650 nm (Em); bright field, 633 nm. Signals were captured in multichannel mode. Images were analyzed and processed in the Zeiss LSM image browser (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). To examine yeast cells expressing GFP, liquid cultures grown overnight in SC-URA Glc medium with A600 of 0.2 to 0.4 were used. AWF was prepared from roots of Arabidopsis grown hydroponically in modified quarter-strength Hoagland medium (5 mm MES-K, pH 5.7; CITATION). The method was modified from that used to extract apoplastic wall fluid from leaves (CITATION; CITATION). Arabidopsis roots (0.1–0.5 g fresh weight) were rinsed in DI water and then excised into 10 mm Na phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Excised roots were submerged in 10 mL of buffer and subjected to vacuum infiltration (<−35 kPa) for 5 min. The roots were then carefully blotted dry on filter paper, weighed, and put into a 5-mL syringe barrel. The barrel was placed in a 15-mL Falcon tube, and the whole ensemble was centrifuged at 3,000g for 20 min. The AWF (approximately 30–200 μL) was collected from the bottom of the Falcon tube. The relative recovery of apoplastic fluid volume from wild-type (ecotype Col) or mutant tissue was similar when the fresh weight of the tissue was similar. Therefore, the fresh weight of mutant and wild-type tissue for each independent experiment was kept nearly equivalent. The total protein in the extracted AWF was estimated using a Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (CITATION). Peroxidase activity of the AWF fraction was determined from the rate of oxidation of guaiacol to tetraguaiacol (CITATION; CITATION). In the presence of peroxidases, the artificial substrate guaiacol (Kasei Kogyo) was oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to tetraguaiacol, which was monitored as an increase in A470. Briefly, 10-, 20-, and 30-μL AWF samples containing 0.1 to 2 μg of total protein were added to a 1-mL reaction mixture containing 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% (v/v) guaiacol in 10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.0. The reaction was started by adding guaiacol, and the increase in A470 was recorded for an initial 2 min using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The rate of A470 change was expressed as nanomoles per minute per gram of tissue (fresh weight) using a molecular extinction coefficient of 26.6 mm−1 cm−1. At least three independent experiments were conducted for each set of wild-type and mutant plants.
