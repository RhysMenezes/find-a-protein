!~ABS~! Chloroplasts are a significant site for reactive oxygen species production under illumination and, thus, possess a well-organized antioxidant system involving ascorbate. Ascorbate recycling occurs in different manners in this system, including a dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) reaction. We herein investigated the physiological significance of DHAR3 in photo-oxidative stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. GFP-fused DHAR3 protein was targeted to chloroplasts in Arabidopsis leaves. A DHAR3 knockout mutant exhibited sensitivity to high light (HL). Under HL, the ascorbate redox states were similar in mutant and wild-type plants, while total ascorbate content was significantly lower in the mutant, suggesting that DHAR3 contributes, at least to some extent, to ascorbate recycling. Activation of monodehydroascorbate reductase occurred in dhar3 mutant, which might compensate for the lack of DHAR3. Interestingly, glutathione oxidation was consistently inhibited in dhar3 mutant. These findings indicate that DHAR3 regulates both ascorbate and glutathione redox states to acclimate to HL.
!~RES~! DHAR3 has been suggested to be a chloroplastic isoform in Arabidopsis because it has an N-terminal extension sequence similar to a chloroplast-targeting signal, which is absent in DHAR1 and 2 (Supplemental Fig. 1). We predicted the sub-cellular localization of DHAR3 using iPSORT (CITATION) Bannai H, Tamada Y, Maruyama O, et al. Extensive feature detection of N-terminal protein sorting signals. Bioinformatics. 2002;18:298–305.10.1093/bioinformatics/18.2.298 Bannai H, Tamada Y, Maruyama O, et al. Views: fundamental building blocks in the process of knowledge discovery.

As a consequence, all programs tested successfully predicted that DHAR3 is a chloroplastic protein. This was supported by a previous proteome analysis using chloroplasts isolated from Arabidopsis leaves. (CITATION) Peltier JB, Cai Y, Sun Q, et al. The oligomeric stromal proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006;5:114–133. Behrens C, Blume C, Senkler M, et al. The ‘protein complex proteome’ of chloroplasts in Arabidopsis thaliana. J. Proteomics. 2013;91:73–83.10.1016/j.jprot.2013.07.001 ) In order to confirm this in more detail, cDNA was cloned into the pGWB505 vector for the expression of DHAR3-cGFP fusion proteins. When the fusion proteins were transiently expressed in the leaves of 4-week-old wild-type Arabidopsis plants, GFP fluorescence clearly overlapped with the red fluorescence derived from chloroplasts (Fig. 1). In contrast, the GFP protein alone was distributed in the cytosol and nucleus. These results demonstrate the chloroplastic localization of DHAR3. [[FIGURE]] For reverse genetic approach, a T-DNA insertion line (dhar3; SAIL_435_A09) of this gene was obtained. A T-DNA insertion occurred in the third intron of the DHAR3 gene (Fig. 2(A)). A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the line was a null mutant (Fig. 2(B)). Furthermore, total DHAR activity in dhar3 leaves was approximately 74% in wild-type leaves (Fig. 2(C)). In an attempt to understand the physiological significance of DHAR3 in photo-oxidative stress tolerance, 2-week-old wild-type and dhar3 plants were subjected to eHL at 1500 μmol m−2 s−1 for 15 h. As shown in Fig. 3, both plants suffered visible damage from this strong stress; however, dhar3 plants were more bleached than the wild-type plants. We then examined the effects of DHAR3 knockout on the redox states of ascorbate. Before eHL irradiation, the dhar3 mutation had no significant effect on the levels or redox states (reduced ascorbate/total) of ascorbate (Fig. 3(C) and (D)). While the eHL exposure for 3 h did not induce visible damage in both wild type and dhar3, this treatment enhanced ascorbate oxidation especially in the mutant (Fig. 3(D)). Furthermore, the lack of DHAR3 inhibited the eHL-induced accumulation of ascorbate (Fig. 3(C)). These findings suggested that chloroplastic DHAR is required for photo-protection through ascorbate recycling in plants under strong photo-oxidative stress conditions. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The eHL exposure easily induced visible damage on leaves under the present experimental conditions, making it difficult to understand the cause-and-effect relationship between the ascorbate redox states and dhar3 phenotype. To obtain more detailed data, we used HL at 1000 μmol photons m−2 s−1 in subsequent analyses therefore. We confirmed that dhar3 mutant had lower DHAR activity even under HL (Fig. 4(A)). No visible oxidative damage was observed in wild type and dhar3 when subjected to this stress for 12 h (data not shown). We evaluated oxidative stress damage in the mutant by measuring Fv/Fm, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II. The parameter was decreased by HL irradiation in wild-type and dhar3 plants, but was more prominent in the mutant at 6 h (Fig. 5(A)). Furthermore, this decrease was accompanied by an increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid oxidation (Fig. 5(B)). These findings indicated that the dhar3 mutant was more sensitive to this HL than wild type. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Although the HL-induced accumulation of ascorbate was slightly but significantly suppressed in the dhar3 mutant, the loss of DHAR3 had no detectable effect on the redox states of ascorbate under the stress conditions (Fig. 6). At present, we do not have any robust explanation for this discrepancy. One plausible explanation might be that the loss of DHAR3 actually had an impact on the redox states of ascorbate within chloroplasts. We might not be able to detect the impact because of use of whole leaf cells for the ascorbate measurement. We also found that the dhar3 mutation actually facilitated an increase in total MDAR activity under HL (Fig. 4(B)). These findings suggest that DHAR3 contributed, at least to some extent, to ascorbate recycling under HL, although the lack of DHAR3 could be compensated by other mechanisms, including MDAR. [[FIGURE]] As described above, ascorbate is required for the xanthophyll cycle, which is one of the important processes for light acclimation. We measured NPQ to indicate the activity of the cycle in wild type and dhar3 under HL. However, there was no significant difference in this parameter between genotypes before and after HL (Supplemental Fig. 2). This result was probably because of the small difference in ascorbate content between wild type and dhar3, and suggested that DHAR3 does not contribute to the induction of NPQ at least under our experimental conditions. Since DHAR catalyzes the reduction of DHA using GSH as an electron donor, it is possible that DHAR contributes to redox regulation of glutathione through its oxidation. In spite of its negligible effect on ascorbate redox states, the lack of DHAR3 markedly affected the redox states of glutathione. Even in the absence of HL, the redox states of glutathione were more reduced in dhar3 mutant plants than in wild-type plants (Fig. 7(B)). Furthermore, redox states were decreased in response to HL in wild-type plants, but this decrease was significantly mitigated in dhar3 mutant plants (Fig. 7(B)). No significant difference was observed in GR activity between wild-type and dhar3 mutant plants (Fig. 4(C)), suggesting that the high-reduction states of glutathione in the dhar3 mutant were not associated with GR activity. These findings indicate that DHAR3 strongly contributes to the glutathione oxidation event in illuminated leaves. Furthermore, the dhar3 mutation facilitated an increase in the total glutathione content under HL (Fig. 7(A)). The accumulation of glutathione is a general marker of oxidative stress. We previously found that the lack of chloroplastic APX isoenzymes have the similar impact on glutathione levels under excess light. (CITATION) Maruta T, Tanouchi A, Tamoi M, et al. Arabidopsis chloroplastic ascorbate peroxidase isoenzymes play a dual role in photoprotection and gene regulation under photooxidative stress.

Plant Cell Environ. 2012;35:454–484.10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02400.x ) the fact that the lack of DHAR3 affected only the glutathione redox states under normal light might indicate that the oxidation of glutathione by DHAR3 is an important process for plant tolerance to photo-oxidative stress.

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as the wild-type plant. A T-DNA insertion line for DHAR3 in the Col-0 background, SAIL_435_A09 (dhar3), was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The surface-sterilized seeds of the wild-type and mutant plants were cold treated at 4 °C for 2–3 days before germination. Plants were grown on half-strength Murashige & Skoog medium containing 1% sucrose under 23 °C during 16 h of light (100 μmol photons m−2 s−1) and at 20 °C during 8 h of darkness. Two-week-old plants were exposed to excess light. To avoid complexity, the terms of “high light (HL)” and “extreme high light (eHL)” were used to indicate 1000 and 1500 μmol photons m−2 s−1, respectively, in this study. The collection of control (non-stressed) samples and application of stress were performed 4 h after illumination. Total RNA was isolated from the leaves of Arabidopsis plants using Sepasol-RNA I super G (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In order to eliminate any contamination of DNA, 50 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I (Takara, Shiga, Japan). First strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (ReverTra Ace; Toyobo) with an oligo dT primer. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed according to Ogawa et al.

Primer sequences were as follows: DHAR3-attB1 (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTATGATAAGCCTTAGGTTTCAACCAAGC-3′) and DHAR3-cGFP-attB2 (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTACCCATAACCTTTGGTCTCCAACC-3′). Italics indicate attB1/B2 sequences. In order to transiently express the fusion protein and GFP alone, pGWB505/DHAR3 and pGWB506 (empty vector) were absorbed onto tungsten particles (1.0 μm in diameter) following the manufacturer’s instructions (Tanaka, Sapporo, Japan). Rosette leaves were harvested from 4-week-old Arabidopsis wild-type plants grown on soil under growth conditions, and then placed onto a 2% (w/v) agar plate. In each bombardment, the leaves were bombarded with 4 μL of DNA-coated tungsten particles (1 μg of DNA) placed onto the plastic holder using a GIE-III IDERA particle gun (Tanaka) at a helium pressure of 4 kgf cm−2 under a vacuum of 600 mm Hg. Following bombardment, the agar plate was filled with water to prevent desiccation. After being incubated overnight at 22 °C in the dark, the leaves were viewed with a TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using a HCX PL APO CS 63.0 9 1.20 WATER UV objective lens. The fluorescence of GFP and chlorophyll was detected at 500–530 and 680–700 nm, respectively. Ascorbate was measured as described previously. (CITATION) Maruta T, Noshi M, Tanouchi A, et al.

Arabidopsis leaves (0.2 g) frozen in liquid N2 were grounded using a mortar and pestle with 2.5 mL of 6% (v/v) HClO4 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. In order to measure AsA, a 100-μL aliquot of the obtained leaf extract was added directly to 900 μL of a 200 mM succinate buffer (pH 12.7, adjusted with NaOH) in the spectrophotometer. The final pH was very close to 6.0. AsA was determined by a change in absorbance at 265 nm following the addition of 5 units of AsA oxidase. In order to determine total ascorbate, 700 μL of the leaf extract was adjusted to pH 6.0 with K2CO3, followed by the addition of dithiothreitol, dissolved in 50 mM HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.5), to a final concentration of 10 mM. The resulting solution was incubated in darkness at 25 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g (4 °C), the supernatant was assayed as described above. The amount of DHA was determined as the difference between these 2 assays. Glutathione was measured according to Shigeoka et al. (CITATION) Shigeoka S, Onishi T, Nakano Y, et al.

The supernatants were mixed with the double equivalent of n-butanol and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The content of malondialdehyde was estimated by measuring the absorbance of the n-butanol layers from 532 to 600 nm.

Fluorescence parameter was calculated as follows: Fv/Fm = (Fm−F0)/Fm; non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) = (Fm−Fm′)/Fm′. Chlorophyll fluorescence in Arabidopsis leaves was measured at 23 °C with a Closed FluorCam 800MF (Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic). More than 20 independent wild-type and mutant plants were used in this experiment. The statistical analysis of data was based on Student’s t-tests. Calculations were performed on more than 3 independent biological replicates. In all experiments, except for the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence, leaves (from >20 seedlings) were pooled and used for 1 biological replicate.
