!~ABS~! Glutathione is involved in thiol redox signaling and acts as a major redox buffer against reactive oxygen species, helping to maintain a reducing environment in vivo. Glutathione reductase (GR) catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) into reduced glutathione (GSH). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes two GRs: GR1 and GR2. Whereas the cytosolic/peroxisomal GR1 is not crucial for plant development, we show here that the plastid-localized GR2 is essential for root growth and root apical meristem (RAM) maintenance. We identify a GR2 mutant, miao, that displays strong inhibition of root growth and severe defects in the RAM, with GR activity being reduced to ∼50%. miao accumulates high levels of GSSG and exhibits increased glutathione oxidation. The exogenous application of GSH or the thiol-reducing agent DTT can rescue the root phenotype of miao, demonstrating that the RAM defects in miao are triggered by glutathione oxidation. Our in silico analysis of public microarray data shows that auxin and glutathione redox signaling generally act independently at the transcriptional level. We propose that glutathione redox status is essential for RAM maintenance through both auxin/PLETHORA (PLT)-dependent and auxin/PLT-independent redox signaling pathways.
!~RES~! In an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis screen of Arabidopsis Columbia-0 (Col-0), we isolated miao, a mutant displaying a short primary root (Figures 1A and 1L; see Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B online). After germination, the primary root growth of miao was strongly inhibited (Figure 1L), but adventitious roots emerged at 7 to 8 d after germination (DAG). In vitro–grown miao seedlings had dark-green cotyledons (Figure 1A), whereas soil-grown miao plants were smaller and dwarfed (see Supplemental Figures 1D, 1E, 1G, and 1H online). All F1 plants from the cross of miao with Col-0 exhibited the Col-0 phenotype, and in the F2 population, the miao phenotype segregated at a ratio of ∼3:1 (Col-0: miao, 201:72), indicating that miao corresponded to a single, recessive locus. Homozygous miao plants were further backcrossed with Col-0 to eliminate background mutations. [[FIGURE]] The remarkable root growth inhibition phenotype of miao prompted us to examine its RAM architecture. Based on the RAM boundary, where the first cells in the cortex file are typically elongated (CITATION; CITATION), the modified pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide (mPS-PI) staining and Nomarski images showed that the RAM length (in micrometers) and cell number of the cortex cell file of miao were decreased to ∼27 and ∼15%, respectively, compared with Col-0 (Figures 1B, 1C, 1M, 1N, and 2B). The RAM of miao completely collapsed 7 to 8 DAG (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). In line with the reduced RAM length of miao, the expression of CYCLIN B1;1 (CycB1;1)pro:GUS (for β-glucuronidase), a reporter for the G2/mitotic phase of the cell cycle (CITATION), was restricted to a small number of proximal meristem cells (Figures 1D and 1E). However, the expression level of CycB1;1pro:GUS in the RAM of miao was not remarkably altered when considering the decreased length of the RAM (Figures 1D and 1E), indicating repressed mitosis and/or enhanced endocycle at the transition from cell proliferation to elongation in the root of miao. [[FIGURE]] We next examined whether the RAM defects in miao were associated with changes in quiescent center (QC) properties and stem cell formation. After staining starch granules with Lugol’s solution, we observed that starch granules accumulated in the QC and neighboring distal stem cells (DSCs), indicating the differentiation status of these cells (Figures 1F and 1G). This observation was further resolved using a modification of mPS-PI staining, which showed starch granules in both the QC and DSC in miao (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Using the QC identity markers QC25:GUS (CITATION) and WUSCHEL-related homeobox5 (WOX5)pro:GFP (for green fluorescent protein) (CITATION), we observed that QC25:GUS expression was strongly reduced and that WOX5pro:GFP expression was only slightly reduced in miao (Figures 1H to 1K), indicating a partial loss of QC identity. We used map-based cloning to identify the mutated MIAO gene. Initial mapping localized MIAO to the right arm of chromosome III, between the molecular markers ciw4 and nga6. Subsequent fine-scale mapping using PCR-based molecular markers narrowed MIAO to an ∼19-kb region, between positions 951 and 28,593 bp in BAC T5N23 (Figure 2A). All genes in this region of the miao genome were sequenced and compared with the gene sequences of Col-0. One cytosine-to-thymine mutation at the 449th nucleotide of the At3g54660 coding region was detected. At the protein level, this base change translates to a replacement of Ser-150 by Phe (Figure 2A). Annotated by TAIR as GR2, At3g54660 is one of two genes encoding GR in the Arabidopsis genome. GR belongs to the pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase family. GR2 contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The full-length open reading frame is 1698 bp long and encodes a 565–amino acid protein. GR2 shows 47.8% identity to GR1. The Conserved Domain Database (CITATION) reveals that GR2 contains one pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain from amino acid 431 to 540 and one Rossmann-fold NAD(P)(+) binding domain between residues 262 and 334. In addition, the sequence contains a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain from residue 132 to 142, where Cys-135 and Cys-140 can form the active disulfide bonds (http://prosite.expasy.org/). [[FIGURE]] Homozygous miao plants were transformed with a binary vector containing a 5617-bp genomic GR2 DNA fragment from Col-0, which included the 2745-bp genomic coding region, as well as the 2215-bp upstream and 657-bp downstream flanking sequences. This DNA fragment rescued the short-root and RAM defects, as well as the dwarf phenotype, of miao (Figure 2B; see Supplemental Figure 1 online), confirming that the GR2 mutation is responsible for the miao phenotype. GR2pro:GR2-Venus and GR2pro:GR2-GUS also completely rescued the miao phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 4 online); hence, these constructs were used for further GR2 localization (see below). To determine the effect of the GR2 mutation on GR activity, we assayed total GR activity in vivo. Total protein was extracted from the whole seedlings of Col-0 and miao lines, and GR activities were measured using 1.0 mM GSSG as the substrate and 0.2 mM NADPH as the reducing power. As shown in Figure 2C, the total GR activity at 3, 5, and 7 DAG decreased to 43, 52, and 59% of that of Col-0, respectively, in miao extracts. It was previously reported that GR1 accounts for 40 to 65% of the total GR activity in Arabidopsis leaf tissue (CITATION; CITATION), suggesting that the activity of GR2 in miao is seriously impaired. Histochemical staining of GR2pro:GR2-GUS transgenic plants showed that GR2 was expressed throughout the whole seedling (Figure 3A). Strong GR2pro:GR2-GUS and GR2pro:GR2-Venus expression was observed in the RAM (Figures 3B and 3C), in line with the RAM defects and root growth inhibition of the GR2 mutant miao (Figure 1; see Supplemental Figures 2 and 3 online). In addition, GR2pro:GR2-GUS was widely expressed in various organs and tissues (e.g., the stele of the mature root zone and the lateral roots, leaves, mature flowers, and siliques) (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), suggesting that GR2 is involved in pleiotropic developmental processes. In contrast with the cytosol and peroxisome localization of GR1 (CITATION; CITATION), GR2 is predicted to be a plastidic protein by TAIR and Predotar (http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html) (CITATION). Moreover, ChloroP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) reveals that the first 73 N-terminal amino acids of GR2 constitute the plastid/chloroplast localization signal. However, previous fluorescence microscopy studies on transiently transformed soybean (Glycine max) suspension cells claimed that GR2 could localize to both plastids and mitochondria (CITATION). To further define the subcellular localization of GR2, GR2pro:GR2-Venus transgenic plants were crossed with either a plastid-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) marker line, Pt-CB, or a mitochondria-CFP marker line, Mt-CB. Pt-CB and Mt-CB marker lines were generated by plant transformation with binary vectors, Pt-CB or Mt-CB, which were constructed by the fusion of the CFP with the chloroplast targeting signal of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit and the mitochondria targeting signal of Saccharomyces cerevisiae COX4, respectively (CITATION). The confocal microscopy images revealed that GR2pro:GR2-Venus colocalized with Pt-CB but not with Mt-CB in the root and hypocotyl cells (Figures 3D and 3E), demonstrating the plastid localization of GR2. In addition, our coexpression of 35Spro:GR2-Venus and Pt-CB or Mt-CB in two transient transformation systems (i.e., protoplast transformation mediated by polyethylene glycol [PEG] and seedling transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens; see Supplemental Figure 6 online) confirmed the plastid localization of GR2. Abundant plastids in RAM were shown by the plastid marker Pt-CB (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). The high density of plastids in the RAM probably reflects the high activity of these cells, considering that many crucial housekeeping metabolic reactions, for example, glycolysis (CITATION) and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (CITATION), occur in plastids. However, other subcellular localizations resulting from alternative splicing or translation initiation in different temporal and spatial contexts could not be excluded. To test the importance of the subcellular localization of GR2 to root growth and RAM maintenance, we generated GR2pro:ΔGR2-Venus by truncating the first 73 amino acids of the N-terminal region of GR2, which were a predicted plastid localization signal. The plastid targeting signal from the tobacco Rubisco small subunit and the mitochondria targeting signal from S. cerevisiae COX4 were inserted into the N terminus of GR2pro:ΔGR2-Venus, giving rise to GR2pro:Pt-ΔGR2-Venus and GR2pro:Mt-ΔGR2-Venus, respectively. These vectors were then transformed into miao plants. For each transformation, at least 15 independent lines were identified, all showing similar phenotypes. The transformations of both GR2pro:ΔGR2-Venus and GR2pro:Mt-ΔGR2-Venus failed to rescue the root defects, but GR2pro:Pt-ΔGR2-Venus conferred partial recovery of the root phenotype of miao (Figures 3F to 3J; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). The only partial recovery was likely due to the lower expression of GR2pro:Pt-ΔGR2-Venus, compared with that of GR2pro:GR2-Venus, in the RAM (see Supplemental Figure 9 online), the result of an unknown mechanism caused by the truncation of 219 bp (encoding 73 amino acids) and/or insertion of 237 bp (encoding 79 amino acids) at the 5′ end of GR2. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that GR2 is localized to plastids and that its plastid localization is essential to root growth and RAM maintenance. Given that GR regulates the GSH:GSSG ratio by catalyzing the reduction of GSSG, we measured the GSH:GSSG ratio in the miao mutant. Glutathione and its precursor, γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-EC), were extracted from whole seedlings of Col-0 and miao and quantified by reverse-phase HPLC (CITATION; CITATION). GSH and γ-EC levels were slightly higher in miao (Figures 4A and 4C). Notably, miao had a steep increase in GSSG (3.4-fold in 3-d-old seedlings and 4.1-fold in 6-d-old seedlings) (Figure 4B). Hence, the GSH:GSSG ratios of 3- and 6-d-old miao dropped to ∼35 and ∼31%, respectively, of those of Col-0. GRX1-reduction oxidation sensitive GFP (GRX1-roGFP2) was developed as an indicator of glutathione redox status (CITATION; CITATION). GRX1-roGFP2 can be excited at 405 and 488 nm in its oxidized and reduced states, respectively; thus, the 405:488 ratio reflects the glutathione redox status in vivo. To restrict this measurement to plastids, we fused a chloroplast-targeting signal of the tobacco Rubisco small subunit (CITATION) to the N terminus of GRX1-roGFP2, giving rise to Pt-GRX1-roGFP2. Ratiometric imaging showed that in both Col-0 and miao, treatment with H2O2 increased the 405:488 ratio, whereas treatment with the thiol-reducing agent DTT decreased the 405:488 ratio (Figures 4D to 4O). Consistent with the lower ratio of GSH:GSSG in miao, a higher 405:488 ratio was observed with both GRX1-roGFP2 and Pt-GRX1-roGFP2 markers in the root tip of miao (Figures 4D, 4G, 4J, and 4M), indicating an oxidized glutathione status. Notably, in the defective RAM of miao, glutathione appeared to be more oxidized as indicated by Pt-GRX1-roGFP2 than by GRX1-roGFP2 (Figures 4G and 4M), corroborating the plastid localization of GR2. [[FIGURE]] The increased oxidation of glutathione in miao prompted us to test whether exogenous thiol-reducing agents were able to rescue the root phenotype. The seedlings of Col-0 and miao were germinated and grown on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with GSH, GSSG, or DTT. At 6 DAG, GSH significantly enhanced the root and RAM lengths of miao in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5), whereas the oxidized form of GSH, GSSG, had no effect on miao roots (Figure 5). Moreover, treatments of miao with 0.2 and 1.0 mM DTT also caused root length to increase by 2.2 and 5.2 times and the RAM length to increase by 1.5 and 4.3 times, respectively (Figure 5). These results confirm that the RAM defects and root growth inhibition in miao are triggered by glutathione oxidation. [[FIGURE]] Glutathione redox status is affected by both the GSH:GSSG ratio and the total glutathione level. To elucidate the possible genetic interactions between glutathione biosynthesis and reduction, we crossed miao with a weak GSH1 mutant allele, cad2-1, which has only 15 to 35% of the glutathione found in the wild type and shows cadmium sensitivity but displays nearly normal seedling development under control conditions (CITATION; CITATION). From the F2 generation, mutants homozygous for miao, but heterozygous for cad2-1, were selected and self-pollinated. In the F3 population, the phenotypes segregated, with ∼75% of the seedlings exhibiting the miao phenotype and the others showing cotyledon bleaching (Figures 6A to 6E), a characteristic feature of oxidative-stress sensitivity. The seedlings with cotyledon bleaching exhibited more severe QC/DSC differentiation and more disorganized columella-cell tiering than miao (Figures 6H and 6I). The development of these seedlings was arrested at ∼10 DAG, and the double homozygous plants for both miao and cad2-1 were not found in the next generation. Taken together, miao cad2-1 double mutants displayed RAM defects and postembryonic lethality, probably caused by oxidative stress, suggesting that the combination of these two plastidic proteins, GR2 and γ-ECS, plays a critical role in plant development by regulating glutathione redox status. [[FIGURE]] In addition, the miao gr1-2 double mutant showed the same phenotype as miao at different development stages, and no additive effects were observed (see Supplemental Figure 10A online). However, our glutathione measurement showed that miao gr1-2 had remarkably higher GSSG levels and lower GSH:GSSG ratios than the miao or gr1-2 single mutants (see Supplemental Figure 10B online). These results, together with the known differences in subcellular localization, suggest that the functions of GR2 and GR1, in terms of GSSG reduction, are not redundant. We also observed that GSH content was increased by ∼20% in the miao gr1-2 seedlings compared with the miao or the gr1-2 seedlings (see Supplemental Figure 10B online); this increase was likely a result of the redox regulation of γ-ECS activity (CITATION; CITATION). Auxin is well known as a crucial regulator of plant development (CITATION). In an attempt to disclose the relationship between glutathione-dependent redox and auxin signaling, we performed a comparative in silico analysis of gene expression in whole seedlings under BSO-mediated glutathione oxidation and auxin treatments, using publicly available data from Arabidopsis seedlings (CITATION; CITATION). To select genes that were differentially regulated by BSO, we used a false discovery rate of q < 0.05 and a 1.5-fold change cutoff and identified 425 upregulated and 170 downregulated genes. Of the 425 upregulated genes, 47 were upregulated under at least one of the conditions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) application (see Supplemental Figure 11 and Supplemental References 1 online). By contrast, only three of these genes were upregulated by auxin under three or more conditions of auxin application, indicating their robust auxin response. None of the 47 upregulated genes belongs to a classical auxin-responsive family (e.g., Auxin/IAA, Gretchen Hagen3, or SMALL AUXIN UPREGULATED RNA [SAUR]). Of these 47 genes, 21 were upregulated only under extremely high levels of IAA application (10 µM), indicating that this gene group is more closely linked with stress responses than with specific features of auxin signaling. This finding was confirmed by an analysis of the promoter sequences of this group of IAA-induced genes, whose promoters lacked the auxin-responsive element (P = 0.946). The W-box promoter (P < 0.00001) and DEHYDRATION RESPONSE ELEMENT B1A/C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR3 (P < 0.001) cis-elements were overrepresented in this group of genes, which again strongly indicates a link to stress responses. Of the 170 genes downregulated by BSO, 18 were upregulated under at least one selected auxin application condition. Of these 18 genes, only five could be considered truly robust auxin-responsive genes because they were upregulated under at least five of seven selected conditions of auxin application (see Supplemental Figure 12 online). Among the five genes, we selected IAA29 and SAUR23, the classic auxin-responsive genes for investigating gene expression in miao by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). However, miao and Col-0 seedlings had similar expression levels of IAA29 and SAUR23 (see Supplemental Figure 13 online). This discrepancy may result from the differences in the extent of GSH oxidation and/or the means by which glutathione oxidation occurs (i.e., total glutathione decrease and GSSG accumulation). Nevertheless, because the node of genes with overlapping expression under IAA treatment and glutathione oxidation mediated by BSO is small, we conclude that glutathione-dependent redox and auxin signaling act nearly independently in whole seedlings at the transcriptional level. Notably, one of the PLT genes, PLT1, was weakly downregulated (fold change 0.83, q = 0.029) after 6 d of treatment with 1.25 mM BSO. PLT is a crucial regulator in root development (CITATION; CITATION). Auxin can induce the expression of PLT (CITATION); conversely, PLT regulates PIN, which stabilizes the auxin gradient by PAT (CITATION; CITATION). This prompted us to investigate the potential interaction between glutathione-dependent redox signaling and the auxin/PLT pathway (see below). We first found that levels of free IAA were slightly but significantly (Student’s t test, P < 0.05, n = 4) lower (by ∼10%) in 6-d-old miao seedlings (9.7 ng/g fresh weight [FW]) than in wild-type seedlings (10.7 ng/g FW). YUCCA-dependent auxin biosynthesis may account for the lower auxin levels in miao, as the expression of YUCCA3 and YUCCA4 in miao seedlings was decreased to 22 and 68% of wild-type levels, respectively, according to our qRT-PCR results (see Supplemental Figure 14 online). By contrast, the expression of several other auxin biosynthesis–related genes, such as TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS1 (TAA1), NITRILASE1 (NIT1) and NIT2, was unchanged in miao (see Supplemental Figure 14 online). The slightly lower IAA content in miao is different from the strong decrease (threefold reduction) observed in ntra ntrb cad2-1 (CITATION), while the auxin level was not significantly affected in the ntra ntrb and cad2-1 mutants (CITATION). These results suggest that severe glutathione oxidation by GR2 mutation could trigger a slight decrease in auxin levels and that the combination of NGS- and NTS-dependent redox signaling is necessary for auxin homeostasis. The auxin maximum indicated by DR5:GUS and DR5rev:GFP in QC was considerably lower in miao than in Col-0 (Figures 7A to 7D). Moreover, the auxin maximum in miao was localized to the first tier of columella cells, rather than to the QC, as observed in Col-0 (Figures 7B and 7D), suggesting that the auxin response and/or gradient in the stem cell niche was strongly perturbed. This auxin perturbation may have been responsible for the alteration of QC differentiation and the partial loss of QC identity (Figures 1F to 1K) (CITATION; CITATION). PIN-mediated PAT establishes and substantiates auxin gradients, thereby regulating root patterning and growth (CITATION). The expression levels of PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP, PIN2pro:PIN2-GFP, PIN3pro:PIN3-GFP, PIN4pro:PIN4-GFP, and PIN7pro:PIN7-GFP were severely reduced in the RAM of miao (Figures 7E to 7N). Lower expression of PIN2pro:GUS, PIN4pro:GUS, and PIN7pro:GUS was also observed in miao (see Supplemental Figure 15 online). The qRT-PCR results confirmed that the mRNA levels of these PINs in the root tips of miao were decreased (Figure 7S). These findings indicate that PIN expression is under transcriptional regulation by glutathione oxidation. Our results are in agreement with the previously observed reductions in PIN expression following application of the glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor BSO (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] The expression of PLT1 and PLT2 was estimated by investigating the PLT1pro:CFP and PLT2pro:CFP marker lines. In the Col-0 background, the expression of PLT1pro:CFP and PLT2pro:CFP was high in the stem cell niche, reached an intermediate level in rapidly dividing cells, and was low in the elongated cells (Figures 7O and 7Q), consistent with previous observations (CITATION). The overall expression levels of PLT1pro:CFP and PLT2pro:CFP were decreased in the miao roots, and the PLT1 and PLT2 expression domains were restricted to the stem cell niche, the columella, and the proximate meristem cells (Figures 7P and 7R), corresponding to the reduced RAM of miao. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the transcriptional expression of PLT1 and PLT2 in the root tips of miao was decreased to 21 and 33% of wild-type values, respectively (Figure 7S). The perturbed DR5, PIN, and PLT expression indicates the impairment of the auxin/PLT pathway in the oxidized glutathione environment of the miao RAM. To elucidate the potential interaction between glutathione-dependent redox signaling and auxin/PLT signaling, the PLT double mutant plt1-4 plt2-2, which shows strong defects in the RAM and stem cell niche (CITATION; CITATION), was crossed with miao. The plt1-4 plt2-2 miao triple mutant exhibited smaller seedling size, serious RAM defects, and more disorganized columella cells than plt1-4 plt2-2 or miao (Figures 8A to 8E; see Supplemental Figure 16 online). The additive phenotype of miao plt1-4 plt2-2 suggests that auxin/PLT and glutathione-dependent redox signaling represent different pathways in RAM maintenance (Figure 8G). Next, we introduced the dexamethasone (DEX)–inducible PLT2 overproduction transgenic line, 35Spro:PLT2-Glucocorticoid Receptor (GLR), into the miao background. Similar to a previous report (CITATION), PLT2 overproduction induced by DEX significantly (Student’s t test, P < 0.01) increased RAM length by 45% in the 35Spro:PLT2-GLR wild-type background, while PLT2 overproduction conferred no increase in RAM length in the miao background (Figure 8F; see Supplemental Figure 17 online). However, 35Spro:PLT2-GLR/miao did exhibit RAM expansion of 13 and 36% in response to DEX in the medium supplemented with 1.0 and 2.0 mM GSH, respectively. Moreover, the RAM expansion induced by DEX in the 35Spro:PLT2-GLR wild-type background was slightly inhibited by treatment with 0.5 mM BSO and more strongly inhibited by treatment with 1.0 mM BSO (Figure 8F; see Supplemental Figure 17 online). These results indicate that the oxidized glutathione environment disrupts auxin/PLT downstream effectors. In other words, a reduced glutathione environment is required for the auxin/PLT pathway to function in RAM maintenance. [[FIGURE]] Glutathione measurement with reverse-phase HPLC showed no significant differences in GSH and GSSG between the plt1-4 plt2-2 double mutant and the wild-type line (Wassilewskija [Ws] ecotype) (GSH and GSSG: 1048.1 + 72.2 nmol/g FW and 20.8 + 1.4 nmol/g FW in Ws; 902.5 + 24.3 nmol/g FW and 17.6 + 0.3 nmol/g FW in plt1-4 plt2-2, means + sd, n = 3, Student’s t test, P < 0.05), indicating that glutathione oxidation is not increased in the defective RAM of the PLT loss-of-function mutants. Furthermore, the application of 1.0 mM GSH, which was sufficient to rescue RAM defects in miao (Figure 5), did not rescue the defective RAM in plt1-4 plt2-2 (see Supplemental Figure 18 online), substantiating that the glutathione oxidization is not a mechanism of the RAM defects in the loss of function of PLT.
!~MM~! The marker lines and mutants used in this work have been described previously. CYCLIN B1;1pro:GUS (CITATION), QC25:GUS (CITATION), WOX5pro:GFP (CITATION), GRX1-roGFP2 (CITATION; CITATION), cad2-1 (CITATION; CITATION), gr1-2 (CITATION), DR5:GUS (CITATION), DR5rev:GFP (CITATION), PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP (CITATION), PIN2pro:PIN2-eGFP (CITATION), PIN3pro:PIN3-GFP (CITATION), PIN4pro:PIN4-GFP (CITATION), PIN7pro:PIN7-GFP (CITATION), PIN2pro:GUS (CITATION), PIN4pro:GUS (CITATION; CITATION), PIN7pro:GUS (CITATION), PLT1pro:CFP (CITATION), PLT2pro:CFP (CITATION), and 35Spro:PLT2-GLR (CITATION) mutants are ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0), while the plt1-4 plt2-2 mutant (CITATION) is ecotype Wassilewskija. Surface-sterilized seeds were imbibed on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) and 1.2% agar medium supplemented with 1% Suc at 4°C in the dark for 2 d and grown at 22°C with a 16-h-light (∼100 µmol m−2 s−1)/8-h-dark cycle. Seedlings were transferred to soil between 8 and 12 DAG and grown under the described conditions in a phytochamber. For glutathione treatment experiments, filter-sterilized GSH or GSSG stock solution (100 mM) was freshly prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 5.6 with 1 M potassium hydroxide (CITATION). For BSO treatment experiments, filter-sterilized BSO stock solution (100 mM) was freshly prepared. For positional cloning of the mutated gene, miao (Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 background) was crossed with Landsberg erecta to generate a large F2 mapping population. Cloning was performed according to published procedures (CITATION). Based on bulked segregant analysis, the mutated site was localized to a region between molecular markers ciw4 and nga6. For fine-scale mapping, simple allele-discriminating PCR (CITATION) and derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers (CITATION) were selected based on sequence polymorphisms between Col-0 and Landsberg erecta that were predicted by the Monsanto Arabidopsis Polymorphism and Ler Sequence Collection (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/browse/Cereon/index.jsp). The mutated site of miao was finally narrowed to a region between 951 and 28,593 bp of BAC-T5N23 by two markers, T5N23.951 (simple allele-discriminating PCR) and T5N23.28593 (derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence). The sequence information for the primers used for these two markers is shown in Supplemental Table 1 online. The sequence information for primers used to construct vectors is shown in Supplemental Table 2 online. GR2 genomic DNA containing the 2745-bp genomic coding region, as well as the 2215-bp upstream– and 657-bp downstream– flanking sequences, was amplified by PCR from the Col-0 genome. AscI and PacI sites were introduced using primer pair p353/p354, and the amplicon was cloned into the binary vector pMDC99, generating pMDC99-GR2pro:gGR2. GR2 cDNA with 5′-AscI was amplified, with primer pair p355/p405, by RT-PCR from the total RNA of Col-0; Venus with 3′-PacI was amplified with primer pair p406/p404 from the Venus/pCS2 vector. The GR2-Venus (with 10☓Ala as a linker) fragment was fused by overlapping PCR and then introduced into the AscI and PacI sites on the pMDC32 vector, giving rise to pMDC32-35Spro:GR2-Venus. To generate pMDC99-GR2pro:GR2-Venus, the GR2 promoter with 5′-AscI from −2215 to +26 bp of the coding region was amplified from pMDC99-GR2pro:gGR2, using primer pair p353/p432; the GR2-Venus-NOS-terminator fragment with 3′-EcoRI was amplified from 35Spro:GR2-Venus with primer pair p433/p422; their overlapping PCR-derived product was then cloned into the AscI and EcoRI sites of pMDC99, resulting in pMDC99-GR2pro:GR2-Venus. The GR2-GUS (with 10☓Ala as a linker) fragment was derived from the fusion of GR2 cDNA and GUS, which was amplified from pMDC162 with primer pair p426/p388. Next, the GR2 promoter with 5′-AscI, GR2-GUS, and the NOS terminator with 3′-EcoRI (amplified from 35Spro:GR2-Venus with primer pair p386/p422) were fused by overlapping PCR, and the product was cloned into the AscI and EcoRI sites of pMDC99, generating pMDC99-GR2pro:GR2-GUS. For pMDC99-GR2pro:ΔGR2-Venus, the ΔGR2-Venus fragment with 3′-EcoRI was amplified from GR2pro:GR2-Venus with primer pair p648/p422 and then fused with the GR2 promoter with 5′-AscI by primer pair p353/p647. To construct pMDC99-GR2pro:Mt-ΔGR2-Venus and pMDC99-GR2pro:Pt-ΔGR2-Venus, the pMDC99-GR2pro vector was first constructed via the insertion of the GR2 promoter fragment, which was amplified with primer pair p353/657, into the AscI and EcoRI sites of pMDC99. The Mt-ΔGR2-Venus-NOS-terminator fragment was amplified from 35Spro:GR2-Venus with primer pair p658/p422 and was then inserted in the EcoRI site of pMDC99-GR2pro, generating pMDC99-GR2pro:Mt-ΔGR2-Venus. Here, the mitochondrial targeting signal from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) COX4 (CITATION) was introduced in the 5′-p658 site (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The plastid targeting signal from the Rubisco small subunit of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was amplified from the Pt-CB vector (CITATION) with primer pair p665/666, and the ΔGR2-Venus-NOS-terminator fragment was amplified with primer pair p667/422. The two fragments were fused by overlapping PCR, and the product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pMDC99-GR2pro, generating GR2pro:Pt-ΔGR2-Venus vectors. To construct Pt-GRX-RoGFP2, a fragment of GRX-RoGFP2 with 5′-BamHI and 3′-XmaI sites was amplified from the genome of GRX-RoGFP2 seedlings (CITATION), using p447/p448, and cloned into the downstream region of the plastid-targeting signal of Pt-CB by replacing the original CFP cassette (CITATION). Plant transformation via floral dip, mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101, was performed according to CITATION. Seedlings were scanned and root lengths were measured using Image J (National Institutes of Health; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). For Nomarski imaging of roots, seedlings were fixed and mounted in chloral hydrate solution (chloral hydrate:water:glycerol = 4:3:1). Images were recorded with an AxioVision microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). RAM size was quantified with Image J, based on the region between the QC and the first elongating cell in the cortex cell file (CITATION; CITATION). mPS-PI staining of roots was performed essentially according to CITATION, but with major modifications. In brief, seedlings were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 30 min and incubated in methanol for 15 min at room temperature. Seedlings were then rinsed with water and incubated in 1% periodic acid (H5IO6) at room temperature for 30 min; subsequently, the seedlings were rinsed with water and incubated in a reagent containing 100 mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15 M hydrochloric acid with 5 µg/mL propidium iodide (PI) for 15 to 30 min, until the roots were visibly stained. The samples were rinsed in water, incubated in chloral hydrate solution for 5 min, and mounted in chloral hydrate solution for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis. For Lugol’s staining, seedlings were incubated in Lugol’s solution (5 g iodide + 10 g potassium iodide in 85 mL of water) in the dark for 15 to 25 min and mounted in chloral hydrate solution for imaging (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). GR activity was measured essentially following the established procedure (CITATION; CITATION). Crude enzyme preparations were extracted from whole seedlings of Col-0 and miao (∼80 mg). After homogenization and centrifugation, the crude enzymes were extracted in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton, 2% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and 1 mM ascorbic acid. The assay mixture contained 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.2 mM β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and 1.0 mM GSSG. The rate of NADPH oxidation was measured by the decreased in OD340 at 25°C. Total protein was quantified using a Bradford assay. The in vivo glutathione and γ-glutamylcysteine level was quantified by reverse-phase HPLC after derivatization with monobromobimane, according to established procedures (CITATION; CITATION). Approximately 100 mg of fresh material from 3- and/or 6-d-old whole seedlings was used for the measurement. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast isolation and transformation, mediated by PEG, were performed as previously described (CITATION). The transient transformation of Arabidopsis seedlings using Agrobacterium GV3101 was performed according to CITATION; however, in our experiment, we used 20% PEG-4000 and 200 µM acetosyringone, instead of MgCl2 or Suc, as described in the original report, as the infiltration medium. With this minor modification, we achieved high transformation efficiencies in the hypocotyls and cotyledons. The fluorescent protein signals were recorded by CLSM. Histochemical GUS assays were performed as previously described (CITATION). Plant samples were fixed in cold 90% acetone for 15 min. The samples were subsequently incubated with the staining solution (100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mg/L 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronic acid, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM K3Fe[CN]6, and 0.5 mM K4Fe[CN]6) at 37°C for a period ranging from 20 min to 4 h. After staining, the samples were washed several times with 95% ethanol and were then incubated in water and mounted in chloral hydrate solution (chloral hydrate:water:glycerol = 4:3:1). The stained tissues were photographed with either an AxioVision microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) for high magnification or an AxioVision stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) coupled to an AxioCam MRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) for low magnification. GFP, yellow fluorescent protein, CFP and PI fluorescence were photographed under a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). For GFP/eGFP, Venus, CFP, and PI, the 488-, 514-, 458-, and 561-nm lines of the laser were used for excitation, and emission was detected at 505 to 530, 530 to 600, 465 to 520, and 590 to 635 nm, respectively. Zen2009 (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) was used to process and extract the images. For analyzing reduction oxidation-sensitive GFP, wavelengths of 405 and 488 nm were used for excitation, respectively, and emission was detected at 505 to 530 nm. The ratiometric image of 405/488 nm, which represents GSH redox status, was processed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) following previous procedures (CITATION; CITATION). The effect of BSO on the whole transcriptomic response in seedlings was analyzed using data from CITATION. We used a log2 scale robust multiarray average procedure for background correction and normalization (CITATION). An Empirical Bayes approach was applied using the Limma R package. A false discovery rate of q < 0.05 and a 1.5-fold change cutoff were used to select differentially regulated genes. The selected genes regulated by BSO were then compared with the differentially regulated genes from five data sets obtained by the application of IAA to the seedlings, as documented by CITATION. Athena (http://www.bioinformatics2.wsu.edu/cgi-bin/Athena/cgi/home.pl) (CITATION) was used to analyze cis-regulatory elements in the 1000-bp upstream promoter sequences of differentially expressed genes. Six-day-old wild-type and miao seedlings (∼60 mg FW) were used for IAA measurements. IAA extraction and measurements, using an Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (Waters) and a triple quadruple tandem mass spectrometer (Quattro Premier XE; Waters), were performed according to published methods (CITATION; CITATION). Gene expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA from 2-mm root tips of 6-d-old seedlings was extracted using the innuPREP Plant RNA kit (Analyticjena). The remaining DNA was digested by DNase I (Thermo Scientific) at 37°C for 30 min followed by the inactivation of DNase I with 5 mM EDTA at 65°C for 10 min. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 µg of total RNA and RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed with Maxima SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Thermo Scientific) on an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The thermocycle program was as follows: 10 min of preincubation at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 15 s at 56°C, and 30 s at 72°C. The gene-specific primers for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. UBIQUITIN10 was used as a reference gene. The relative gene expression was analyzed using the Δ-Δ cycle threshold method. Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were used to evaluate gene expression.
